And who can tell which is the most important?”\r\n\r\n                                 ROBERT HAVEN SCHAUFFLER, from\r\n                                 _The Creative Listener_ (a revision) in\r\n                                 _The Musical Amateur_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE AUTHORS’ GREETINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEAR YOUNG READERS FROM NINE TO NINETY:\r\n\r\nIn writing this book we have not tried to write a history but rather\r\nhave attempted to follow a lane parallel to the road along which music\r\nhas marched down to us through the ages.\r\n\r\nFor this reason you will find what may seem upon first glance peculiar\r\nomissions, but which to us were prayerfully and carefully relinquished,\r\nlest the book become an encyclopedia and lest our kind publisher look\r\nupon us ungraciously and our readers despair.\r\n\r\nAmong the omissions which may be regarded as serious is a chapter on the\r\nsingers, those who have delighted and thrilled the public through the\r\nyears, but the nature of this book, in the minds of its authors,\r\nprecludes details of the executive side of music, adhering as closely as\r\npossible to the actual creators.\r\n\r\nIn our experience every history of music, and we have read scores of\r\nthem, leaves out many things, so our “lane” touches things in passing,\r\nonly, owing to mechanical as well as willful reasons.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we have enlarged greatly on many topics. This we have\r\ndone when we have considered a subject particularly picturesque in order\r\nto attract and stimulate the novice reading about music, perhaps, for\r\nthe first time!\r\n\r\nLastly we have tried to explain as simply as possible, without becoming\r\ninfantile, the varying steps in Music’s growth. Therefore, the book has\r\nassumed larger proportions than if we had been able to use scientific\r\nterms and cut the Gordian knot of explanation with one swiftly aimed\r\nblow, rather than three or four.\r\n\r\nSo, with the sincere hope that our book will help you to love music\r\nbetter, because you will have seen its struggle with politics, religion\r\nand its critics, we leave you to read it—from cover to cover—we hope!\r\n\r\n                                          MARION BAUER AND ETHEL PEYSER.\r\n\r\n    PARIS AND\r\n  NEW YORK CITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur book has had friends other than its authors. It has, in fact, had\r\nmakers as well as authors, so it cannot go out into the world without\r\nproclaiming its “thank-yous.” First it would thank Flora Bernstein, its\r\nindefatigable and patient typist, editor and general adviser, who worked\r\nnight and day for many moons; second, it must thank Dorothy Lawton of\r\nthe Music Library of the City of New York for her graceful but poignant\r\ncriticism, and third it must thank Grace Bliss Stewart, who did some\r\nresearch and anything needed.\r\n\r\n                                            _How Music Grew_\r\n                                                        and the\r\n                                                                AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one questions the need of histories of music. Few, however, define\r\nthe need. It seems to be generally agreed that people ought to know\r\nsomething about the history of the principal arts. Who designed St.\r\nPeter’s, who painted the _Descent from the Cross_, who wrote _The Faerie\r\nQueen_ and who composed the _Ninth Symphony_. These are things one ought\r\nto know. The reasons why one ought to know them are seldom made clear.\r\nBut just at this time, when the word “appreciation” is so active in the\r\nworld’s conversation, there should be little difficulty in separating\r\nfrom the mass of unformed comment at least one reason for acquaintance\r\nwith the history of music.\r\n\r\nNo one can “appreciate” an art work without knowing its period, the\r\nstate of the art in that period, the ideals and purposes of composers,\r\nthe capacity of their public and the particular gifts and aims of the\r\nwriter of the work under consideration. It is extremely difficult for\r\nany person to begin the study of “appreciation” after he is old enough\r\nto have acquired a stock of prejudices and burdened his mind with a\r\nheavy load of misconceptions. It is better to absorb good art, music or\r\nother, in the early years and to grow up with it than to try at 18 or 20\r\nto put away childish things and understand Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bauer and Miss Peyser have written a history of music for young\r\npeople. It is not for the kindergarten class and yet it is not out of\r\nthe reach of mere children. It is not for the seniors in a university\r\nand yet they might profit by examining it. The authors have surveyed the\r\nentire field. They have touched ancient music and the music of nations\r\nnot usually considered in some more pretentious histories. They have\r\napparently tried to give a bird’s-eye view of the art as practiced by\r\nall the civilized and some of the uncivilized races of the earth. With\r\nthis in mind they have shown how the supreme art forms and the greatest\r\nart works developed among the western European peoples, who, it is\r\ninteresting to note, produced also the metaphysical and philosophical\r\nbases of the world’s scientific thought, the mightiest inventions, and\r\nwith all regard for Buddhistic poetry and speculation, the highest\r\nachievements in literature.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that they have made a history of music singularly well\r\nadapted to young minds. They do not treat their readers as if they were\r\ninfants—which might offend them—nor as college professors, which would\r\ncertainly bore them. The book will undoubtedly have a large audience,\r\nfor teachers of young music students, of whom there are legions, will\r\nsurely exclaim: “This is just what we have needed.”\r\n\r\n                                                        W.

There were\r\nno churches then, no homes nor cities, no railroads, no roads in fact,\r\nand the oldest and wisest man knew less than a little child of today.\r\n\r\nStep by step men fought their way to find means of speaking to each\r\nother, to make roads to travel on, houses to live in, fire to cook with,\r\nclothes to wear, and ways to amuse themselves.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, over one hundred thousand years ago, called\r\n“prehistoric” because it was before events were recorded, men had to\r\nstruggle with things that no longer bother us.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourselves this era when people lived out-of-doors, in mounds\r\nand caves surrounded by wild beasts which though dangerous, were not\r\nmuch more so than their human neighbors. Remember, too, that these\r\npeople did not know that light followed darkness as the day the night;\r\nsummer followed winter as the seasons come and go; that trees lost their\r\nleaves only to bear new ones in the spring, and that lightning and\r\nthunder were natural happenings; and so on through the long list of\r\nthings that we think today perfectly simple, and not in the least\r\nfrightening.\r\n\r\nBecause they did not understand these natural things, they thought that\r\ntrees, sun, rain, animals, birds, fire, birth, death, marriage, the\r\nhunt, caves and everything else had good and bad gods in them. In order\r\nto please these gods they made prayers to them quite different from our\r\nprayers, as they danced, sang and acted the things they wanted to have\r\nhappen. When a savage wanted sun or wind or rain, he called his tribe\r\ntogether and danced a sun dance, or a wind dance, or a rain dance. When\r\nhe wanted food, he did not pray for it, but he acted out the hunt in a\r\nbear dance. As the centuries went by they continued to use these dances\r\nas prayers, and later they became what we call religious rites and\r\nfestivals. So here you see actually the beginning of what we know as\r\nEaster festivals, Christmas with its Christmas tree and mistletoe,\r\nspring festivals and Maypole dances with the Queen of the May,\r\nHallowe’en and many other holiday celebrations.\r\n\r\nThis is how music, dancing, poetry, painting and drama were born. They\r\nwere the means by which primitive men talked to their gods. This they\r\ndid, to be sure, very simply, by hand-clapping and foot-stamping, by\r\nswaying their bodies to and fro, by shouting, shrieking, grunting,\r\ncrying and sobbing, and as soon as they knew enough, used language, and\r\nrepeated the same word over and over again. These movements and sounds\r\nwere the two roots from which music grew.\r\n\r\nIf you can call these queer grunts and yells singing, the men of those\r\nfar-off days must have sung even before they had a language, in fact, it\r\nmust have been difficult to know whether they were singing or talking.\r\nIn these cries of joy, sorrow, pain, rage, fear, or revenge, we find\r\nanother very important reason for the growth of music. These\r\nexclamations, however barbaric and rough, were man’s first attempt at\r\nexpressing his feelings.\r\n\r\nWe still look upon music as one of the most satisfying ways to show our\r\nemotions, and the whole story of music from prehistoric times to the\r\npresent day is a record of human feelings expressed in rhythm and\r\nmelody.\r\n\r\nGradually these early men learned to make not only musical instruments,\r\nbut also the knife for hunting and utensils for cooking. The first step\r\ntowards a musical instrument was doubtless the striking together of two\r\npieces of wood or stone in repeated beats. The next step was the\r\nstretching of the skin of an animal over a hollowed-out stone or tree\r\ntrunk forming the first drum. Another simple and very useful instrument\r\nwas made of a gourd (the dried hollow rind of a melon-like fruit) filled\r\nwith pebbles and shaken like a baby’s rattle.\r\n\r\nAs early in the story of mankind as this, the love of decoration and\r\nneed of beauty were so natural that they decorated their bodies, the\r\nwalls of their caves, and their everyday tools with designs in carving,\r\nand in colors made from earth and plants. You can see some of these\r\nutensils and knives, even bits of wall pictures, in many of the museums\r\nin collections made by men who dig up old cities and sections of the\r\ncountries where prehistoric peoples lived. These men are called\r\narchaeologists, and devote their lives to this work so that we may know\r\nwhat happened before history began.\r\n\r\nA few years ago tools of flint, utensils made of bone, and skeletons of\r\nhuge animals, that no longer exist, were found in a sulphur spring in\r\nOklahoma; pottery and tools of stone, wood, and shell were dug up in\r\nArizona; carvings, spear heads, arrow points, polished stone hatchets\r\nand articles of stone and ivory in Georgia, Pennsylvania and the Potomac\r\nValley. This shows that this continent also had been inhabited by\r\nprehistoric people.\r\n\r\nEven as we see prehistoric man using the things of nature for his tools,\r\nsuch as elephant tusks, flint, and wood; and as we see him making paint\r\nfrom earth and plants, we also see him getting music from nature. It\r\nwould have been impossible for these early men and children to have\r\nlived out-of-doors and not to have listened to the songs of the birds,\r\nthe sound of wind through the trees, the waves against the rocks, the\r\ntrickling water of brooks, the beat of the rain, the crashing of thunder\r\nand the cries and roars of animals. All of these sounds of nature they\r\nimitated in their songs and also the motions and play of animals in\r\ntheir dances.\r\n\r\nIn Kamchatka, the peninsula across the Behring Strait from Alaska, there\r\nstill live natives who sing songs named for and mimicking the cries of\r\ntheir wild ducks.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Australia, which is the home of the amusing-looking\r\nkangaroo, have a dance in which they imitate the peculiar leaps and\r\nmotions of this animal. When you recall its funny long hind legs and\r\nshort forelegs, you can imagine how entertaining it would be to imitate\r\nits motions. The natives also try to make the same sounds with their\r\nvoices, as the kangaroo. The women accompany these dances by singing a\r\nsimple tune of four tones over and over, knocking two pieces of wood\r\ntogether to keep time. If ever you go to the Australian bush (woods or\r\nforests) you will see this kangaroo dance. This is different, isn’t it,\r\nfrom sitting in a concert hall and listening to some great musician who\r\nhas spent his life in hard work and study so that he may play or sing\r\nfor you?\r\n\r\nWe can learn much about the beginnings of music from tribes of men who,\r\nalthough living today, are very near the birthday of the world, so far\r\nas their knowledge and habits are concerned.\r\n\r\nPrimitive men love play; they love to jump, to yell, to fling their arms\r\nand legs about, and to make up stories which they act out, as children\r\ndo who “make believe.”\r\n\r\nThis love of mankind for make believe, and his desire to be amused,\r\nalong with his natural instinct to express what he feels, are the roots\r\nfrom which music has grown. But, of course, in prehistoric times, men\r\ndid not know that they were making an art, for they were only uttering\r\nin sound and movement their wants, their needs, in fact, only expressing\r\ntheir daily life and their belief in God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                       The Savage Makes His Music\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately for our story there live groups of people today still in the\r\nearly stages of civilization who show us the manners and customs of\r\nprimitive man, because they are primitive men themselves.\r\n\r\nWe are going to learn how music grew from the American Indian and the\r\nAfrican. We are using these two as examples for two reasons: because\r\nthey are close enough to us to have influenced our own American music,\r\nand because all savage music has similar traits. The American Indian and\r\nthe African show us the steps from the primitive state of music to the\r\nbeginning of music as an art. In other words, these people are a bridge\r\nbetween prehistoric music and that of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter I about prehistoric man, we spoke of the two roots of\r\nmusic—movement and sound. Hereafter when we speak of rhythm it will mean\r\nmovement either in tones or in gestures. Rhythm expressed in tones makes\r\nmusic; rhythm expressed in gestures makes the dance. The reason we like\r\ndance music and marches is that we feel the rhythm, the thing that makes\r\nus want to mark the beat of the music with our feet, or hands, or with\r\nhead bobbings. This love of the beat is strong in the savage, and upon\r\nthis he builds his music.\r\n\r\nOur American Jazz is the result of our desire for strong rhythms and\r\nshows that we, for all our culture, have something in us of the savage’s\r\nfeeling for movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AMERICAN INDIANS\r\n\r\nWe have a name for everything, but the American Indian has a name and a\r\nsong for everything. He has a song for his moccasins, for his head-gear,\r\nfor his teepee, the fire in it, the forest around him, the lakes and\r\nrivers in which he fishes and paddles, for his canoe, for the fish he\r\ncatches, for his gods, his friends, his family, his enemies, the animal\r\nhe hunts, the maiden he woos, the stars, the sun, and the moon, in fact\r\nfor everything imaginable. The following little story will explain the\r\nIndians’ idea of the use of their songs:\r\n\r\nAn American visitor who was making a collection of Indian songs, asked\r\nan old Ojibway song-leader to sing a hunting song. The old Indian looked\r\nat him in surprise and left him. A little later the son-in-law of the\r\nIndian appeared and with apologies told the American that “the old\r\ngentleman” could not sing a hunting song because it was not the hunting\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe next time the old Indian came, the American asked him for a love\r\nsong, but he politely refused, saying that it was not dignified for a\r\nman of his age to sing love songs. However, the old warrior suddenly\r\ndecided that as he was making a call, it was quite proper for him to\r\nsing Visiting Songs, which he did, to his host’s delight.\r\n\r\nThis old man had been taught to sing when he was a very little boy, as\r\nthe Indian boy learns the history of his tribe through the songs. He is\r\ncarefully trained by the old men and women so that no song of the tribe\r\nor family should be forgotten. These songs are handed down from one\r\nfamily to another, and no one knows how many hundreds of years old they\r\nmay be. So, you see, these songs become history and the young Indians\r\nlearn their history this way, not as we do, from text books.\r\n\r\n“What new songs did you learn?” is the question that one Indian will ask\r\nof another who has been away on a visit, and like the announcer at the\r\nradio broadcasting station, the Indian answers:\r\n\r\n“My friends, I will now sing you a song of—” and he fully describes the\r\nsong. Then he sings it. After he finishes, he says, “My friends, I have\r\nsung you the song of—” and repeats the name of the song!\r\n\r\nSo great a part of an Indian’s life is music, that he has no word\r\nmeaning poetry in his language. Poetry to the Indian is always song. In\r\nfact an Indian puts new words to an old tune and thinks he has invented\r\na new song.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WHAT IS INDIAN MUSIC?\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian sings, he starts on the highest tone he can reach and\r\ngradually drops to the lowest, so that many of his songs cover almost\r\ntwo octaves. He does not know that he sings in a scale of five tones.\r\nFor some reason which we cannot explain, most primitive races have used\r\nthis same scale. It is like our five black keys on the piano, starting\r\nwith F sharp. This is called the pentatonic scale, (penta, Greek word\r\nfor five, tonic meaning tones). This scale is a most amazing traveler,\r\nfor we meet it in our musical journeys in China, Japan, Arabia,\r\nScotland, Africa, Ireland, ancient Peru and Mexico, Greece and many\r\nother places. The reason we find these five tones popular must be\r\nbecause they are natural for the human throat. At any rate we know that\r\nit is difficult for the Indian to sing our scale. He does not seem to\r\nwant the two notes that we use between the two groups of black keys\r\nwhich make our familiar major scale.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to put down an Indian song in our musical writing,\r\nbecause, the Indians sing in a natural scale that has not been changed\r\nby centuries of musical learning. They sing in a rhythm that seems\r\ncomplicated to our ears in spite of all our musical knowledge, and this,\r\ntoo, is difficult to write down. Another thing which makes it hard to\r\nset down and to imitate Indian music, is that they beat the drum in\r\ndifferent time from the song which they sing. They seldom strike the\r\ndrum and sing a tone at the same time. In fact, the drum and the voice\r\nseem to race with each other. At the beginning of a song, for example,\r\nthe drum beat is slower than the voice. Gradually the drum catches up\r\nwith the voice and for a few measures they run along together. The drum\r\ngains and wins the race, because it is played faster than the voice\r\nsings. The curious part of it is, that this is not an accident, but\r\nevery time they sing the same song, the race is run the same way. We are\r\ntrained to count the beats and sing beat for beat, measure for measure\r\nwith the drum. Try to beat on a drum and sing, and see how hard it is\r\nnot to keep time with it.\r\n\r\nThe Indian slides from tone to tone; he scoops with his voice, somewhat\r\nlike the jazz trombone player.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INDIAN INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nThe Indian’s orchestra is made up of the rattle and the drum. The white\r\nman cannot understand the Indian’s love of his drum. However, when he\r\nlives among them he also learns to love it. When Indians travel, they\r\ncarry with them a drum which is hidden from the eyes of the strange\r\nwhite man. When night comes, they have song contests accompanied by the\r\ndrum which is taken out of its hiding place.\r\n\r\nThese contests are very real to the Indians and they are similar to the\r\ntournaments held in Germany in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe drummer, who is also the singer, is called the leading voice and is\r\nso important that he ranks next to the chief. His rank is high, because\r\nthrough knowing the songs he is the historian of his tribe.\r\n\r\nThe drum is made of a wooden frame across which is stretched the skin of\r\nan animal, usually a deer. Sometimes it is only a few inches across, and\r\nsometimes it is two feet in diameter. When it has two surfaces of skins,\r\nthey are separated four to six inches from each other. It is held in the\r\nleft hand by a leather strap attached to the drum frame, and beaten with\r\na short stick. (Figure 1.)\r\n\r\nThe Sioux Indian sets his drum on the ground; it is about the size of a\r\nwash tub and has only one surface. Two or more players pound this drum\r\nat the same time and the noise is often deafening. The Ojibway drum\r\nalways has two surfaces and is usually decorated with gay designs in\r\ncolor. (Sioux drum, Figure 2.)\r\n\r\nThe drum makes a good weather bureau! The Indian often forecasts the\r\nweather by the way his drum answers to his pounding. If the sound is\r\ndull, he knows there is rain in the air, if it is clear and sharp and\r\nthe skin is tight, he can have out-door dances without fear of a\r\nwetting. You could almost become a weather prophet yourself by watching\r\nthe strings of your tennis racket, which act very much like the drum\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nAnother instrument beloved of all Indians is the rattle. There are many\r\ndifferent sizes and shapes of rattles made of gourds, horns of animals\r\nand tiny drums filled with pebbles and shot. Some of them are carved out\r\nof wood in the shape of birds and animal heads. (Figure 3.)\r\n\r\nThe Indians also have the flute, and although there is no special music\r\nfor it, it is of great importance in their lives. No two flutes are made\r\nto play exactly the same tones, that is, they are not drawn to scale.\r\nThey are like home-whittled whistles made of wood in which holes are\r\nburned. (Figure 4.)\r\n\r\nThe flute is never used in the festivals or in the dance but it is the\r\nlover’s instrument. A young man who is too bashful to ask his sweetheart\r\nto marry him, hides among the bushes near her teepee, close to the\r\nspring where she goes every morning for water. When he sees her, he\r\nplays a little tune that he makes up just for her. Being a well brought\r\nup little Indian maid, she pretends not to notice it, but very soon\r\ntries to find out who played to her. If she likes him, she gives him a\r\nsign and he comes out of his hiding place, but if she does not wish to\r\nmarry him, she lets him go on playing every morning until he gets tired\r\nand discouraged and returns no more to the loved spring near her teepee\r\nin the early morning.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the reason the Indian love songs so often refer to sunrise,\r\nspring and fountains, and why we use the melancholy flute when we write\r\nIndian love songs.\r\n\r\nBecause of the ceaseless beating of the drum, the constant repetition of\r\ntheir scale of five tones, and the rambling effect of the music like\r\nunpunctuated sentences, we find the Indian music very monotonous. But\r\nthey return the compliment and find our music monotonous, probably,\r\nbecause it is too well punctuated. Mr. Frederick Burton in his book on\r\nPrimitive American Music, tells of having given to two Indian friends\r\ntickets for a recital in Carnegie Hall, in New York City, where they\r\nheard songs by Schubert and Schumann. When he asked them how they\r\nenjoyed the music they politely said, “It is undoubtedly very fine, it\r\nwas a beautiful hall and the man had a great voice, but it seemed to us\r\nas though he sang the song over, over and over again, only sometimes he\r\nmade it long and sometimes short.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            INDIAN SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nThe Indian is a great club man; every Indian belongs to some society.\r\nThe society which he joins is decided by what he dreams. If he dreams of\r\na bear, he joins the Bear Society; if he dreams of a Buffalo, he joins\r\nthe Buffalo Society. Other names of clubs are: Thunder-bird, Elks and\r\nWolves.\r\n\r\nDreams play a great part in the Indian’s life. If he dreams of a small\r\nround stone, a sacred thing to him, he is supposed to have the power to\r\ncure sickness, to foretell future events, to tell where objects are\r\nwhich cannot be seen.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the societies or clubs has its own special songs. The\r\nIndians also have songs of games, dances, songs of war and of the hunt,\r\nsongs celebrating the deeds of chiefs, conquering warriors, war-path and\r\ncouncil songs.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter we spoke of primitive man imitating animals and\r\nhere we find that the Indians, in their societies named for animals,\r\nimitate the acts of the clubs’ namesakes.\r\n\r\nThey have a dance called the grass dance, in which they decorate their\r\nbelts with long tufts of grass, a reminder of the days when they wore\r\nscalps on their belts after they had been on the “war-path.” In this\r\ndance they imitate the motions of the eagle and other birds. Even the\r\nfeathers used in their head-dress is a part of their custom of imitating\r\nanimals and birds. Some of these head-dresses are like the comb, and the\r\nIndian who wears this will imitate the cries of the bird to which the\r\ncomb belongs. His actions always correspond with his costume.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have lullabies and children’s game-songs,—the moccasin game,\r\nin which they search for sticks hidden in a moccasin. Then too, there is\r\nthe Rain Dance of the Junis and the Snake Dance of the Hopis, in which\r\nthey carry rattlesnakes, sometimes holding them between the teeth.\r\n\r\nDance often means a ceremony lasting several days. The Indians are\r\nworshippers of the Sun, and have a festival, which lasts several days,\r\ncalled the Sun Dance. This festival took place particularly among the\r\nIndians of the plains: the Cheyennes, the Chippewas and others. The last\r\nSun Dance took place in 1882. In this the Indian offered to the “Great\r\nSpirit” what was strongest in his nature and training,—the ability to\r\nstand pain. Self inflicted pain was a part of the ceremony and seemed\r\nnoble to the Indian, but to the white man it was barbarous and\r\nheathenish and he put a stop to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MEDICINE MAN\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard of the medicine man? He is doctor, lawyer, priest,\r\nphilosopher, botanist, and musician all in one. The society of “Grand\r\nMedicine” is the religion of the Chippewas. It teaches that one must be\r\ngood to live long. The chief aims of the society are to bring good\r\nhealth and long life to its followers, and music is as important in the\r\nhealing as medicine.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the society carries a bag of herbs, the use of which he\r\nhas learned, and if called upon to heal the sick, he works the cure by\r\nsinging the right song before giving the medicine. The medicine is not\r\nusually swallowed in proper fashion as a child takes a dose, but it is\r\ncarried by the sick person, or is placed among his belongings, or a\r\nlittle wooden figure is carved roughly by the Medicine Man and must be\r\ncarried around with the herbs to heal the patient. But the song, and it\r\nmust be the right song for the occasion, counts as much as the medicine.\r\nWouldn’t you like to be an Indian?\r\n\r\nOften the Medicine Man is called upon for a love-charm, for which there\r\nis a song. There are also songs of cursing which are supposed to work an\r\nevil charm when used with a certain kind of cursing herbs.\r\n\r\nBoth men and women may become members of the Great Medicine Society, and\r\nthey must go through eight degrees or stages in which they are taught\r\nthe use of the medicines and the songs. Each member of the society has\r\nhis own set of songs, some of which he has composed himself and others\r\nhe has had to buy for large sums of money or goods. No man is allowed to\r\nsing another man’s song unless he has bought the right to it. With the\r\nsale of a song goes the herb to be used with that particular song. The\r\nceremony is very elaborate. It lasts for several days, and sounds very\r\nmuch like a story book.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewa Indians have had a written picture language by means of\r\nwhich they read the different songs. These pictures were usually drawn\r\non white birch-bark. Here are a few samples:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN SONG PICTURE\r\n\r\n  In form like a bird it appears.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN SONG PICTURE\r\n\r\n  On my arm behold my pan of food.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN SONG PICTURE\r\n\r\n  Wavy lines indicate “the song.”\r\n\r\n  Straight lines indicate “strength.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN SONG PICTURE\r\n\r\n  I have shot straight.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN SONG PICTURE\r\n\r\n  The sound of flowing water comes toward my home.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen we tell you about American music we will speak again of the Indian\r\nand how we have used in our own music what he has given us.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE NEGRO AND HIS MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe place of the negro in the world of music has been the cause of many\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\nIs his music that of a primitive man?\r\n\r\nIs it American?\r\n\r\nIs it American Folk Music?\r\n\r\nAs we tell you the story of music we shall have to speak of the negro\r\nmusic from all these different sides. But, for you to understand why\r\nthere is a question about it, we must tell you where the negro came from\r\nand what he brought from his primitive home.\r\n\r\nWhen the English first came to Virginia and founded Jamestown in 1607\r\nthey started to grow tobacco on great plantations, and for this they\r\nneeded cheap labor. They tried to use Indians, but as the work killed so\r\nmany of them, they had negroes sent over from Africa to do it. A year\r\nbefore the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620, negroes were\r\nalready being sold as slaves in Virginia. Until 1808 these negroes were\r\nbrought over from Africa; they were not all of one tribe, nor were they\r\nof one race. There were Malays from Madagascar, Movis from northern\r\nAfrica, red skins and yellow skins as well as black.\r\n\r\nThese people were primitive and they all used song and dance in their\r\nreligion, their work and their games. They brought from Africa a great\r\nlove for music and ears that heard and remembered more than many a\r\ntrained musician. A well-known writer has said that wherever the African\r\nnegro has gone, he has left traces in the music of that country. The\r\nSpanish Habanera, which we have danced by the name of Tango came from\r\nAfrica; even the name is African, “tangara,” and was a vulgar dance\r\nunfit for civilized people. The rhythm of the African dance and of our\r\ntango is the same.\r\n\r\nLike other savages, the African negro loved rhythm better than melody.\r\nHis songs were monotonous and were made up of a few tones and short\r\nrepeated phrases. They used the scale, of five tones (called\r\npentatonic), the same as the Indian’s.\r\n\r\nThe African negro was a master at drumming. The Indian drumming was\r\nregular like the clock or pulse, but the negro played most difficult and\r\ncomplicated rhythms, almost impossible for a trained musician, to\r\nimitate. He had drums of all sizes and kinds.\r\n\r\nThese savages sang groups of tones which we call chords, which were not\r\nused by any of the ancient civilized people. By means of different\r\nrhythms they had hundreds of ways of combining the three tones of a\r\nchord as C-E-G. It is curious that these primitive people should have\r\nused methods more like our own than many of the races that had reached a\r\nmuch higher degree of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe Africans had an original telegraph system in which they did not use\r\nthe Morse code, but sent their messages by means of drums that were\r\nheard many miles away. They had a special drum language which the\r\nnatives understood; and the American Indians flashed _their_ messages\r\nover long distances by means of the reflection of the sun on metal.\r\n\r\nIt is only a little more than a hundred years ago since we stopped\r\nbringing these primitive people into America and making slaves of them.\r\nTheir children have become thoroughly Americanized now, from having\r\nlived alongside of the white people all this time and some have\r\nforgotten their African forefathers. But in the same way that the\r\nchildren of Italian, German, French or Russian parents remember the\r\nsongs of their forefathers and often show traces of these songs in the\r\nmusic they make, so the negro without knowing it has kept some of the\r\nprimitive traits of African music.\r\n\r\nLater, we will tell you how this grew into two kinds of music, the\r\nbeautiful religious song called the Negro Spiritual, and the dance which\r\nhas grown into our popular ragtime and jazz.\r\n\r\nIf we were to study in detail the music of many savage tribes of\r\ndifferent periods from prehistoric day to the uncivilized people living\r\ntoday, we should find certain points in common. They all have festival\r\nsongs, songs for religious ceremonials, for games, work songs, war\r\nsongs, hunting songs and love songs. In fact it is a beautiful habit for\r\nprimitive people to put into song everything they do and everything they\r\nwish to remember. With them music has not been a frill or a luxury, but\r\na daily need and a natural means for expressing themselves.\r\n\r\nAnother thing alike among these early peoples, is that all of them had\r\ndrums and rattles of some kind and a roughly made instrument that\r\nresembles our pipes. But they had no stringed instruments and for their\r\nbeginnings you will have to journey on with us in this,—your book.\r\n\r\nSince giving this book to the public, we have come in direct contact\r\nwith some remarkable songs of the Nootka (Canadian) Indians and of the\r\nEskimos. Juliette Gaultier de la Verendry, a young French Canadian, has\r\nsung them in New York in the original dialect. They have been given to\r\nher by D. Jenness, an anthropologist who lived among the Eskimos for\r\nseveral years, studying their traits and at the same time he took the\r\nopportunity of writing down their songs. They are truly savage music and\r\nhave the characteristics of which we have spoken in the use of\r\nintervals, drums, and in the type of songs, such as weather and healing\r\nincantations (medicine songs), work songs, and dances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n  The Ancient Nations Made Their Music—Egyptian, Assyrian, and Hebrew\r\n\r\n\r\nThree thousand years before Jesus was born, a corner of southwestern\r\nAsia and northeastern Africa was the home of people who had reached a\r\nvery high degree of civilization. They were the first to pass the stage\r\nof primitive man, and to make for themselves beautiful buildings,\r\nbeautiful cities, monuments, decorations and music. Among these ancient,\r\ncivilized people were the Egyptians, the Assyrians and the Hebrews. We\r\nwill talk first about the Egyptians because they had the greatest\r\ninfluence not only on the Assyrian and Hebrew music, but also on the\r\nGreeks who went to Egypt. So, in European music we can trace the\r\nEgyptian influence through the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were very fond of building and they decorated what they\r\nbuilt with pictures in vivid colorings called hieroglyphics\r\n(heiro—sacred, glyphics—writings). As they had neither newspapers nor\r\nradio sets, they carved or painted the records of their daily lives,\r\ntheir festivals, battles, entertainments, and even marketing journeys on\r\nthe walls and on the columns of the temples, on the obelisks, and in the\r\ntombs, some of which were the pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe climate saved these records from destruction, and the archaeologists\r\nre-discovered them for us in the tombs full of Egyptian treasure and the\r\ntemples and lost cities, buried for thousands of years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 1._\r\n\r\n  _Drums and Sticks._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 2._\r\n\r\n  _Sioux Drum._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 3._\r\n\r\n  _A Pipe and Rattles from Alaska._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 4._\r\n\r\n  _Bone Flutes._\r\n]\r\n\r\n       (_Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York._)\r\n\r\n               _Some Instruments of the American Indian._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the Egyptian Collection in the Louvre, Paris._\r\n\r\n  _Hieroglyphics on an Egyptian Tablet._\r\n  (_Telling a story of a Prince._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians built to inspire feelings of awe, mystery and grandeur.\r\nYou probably remember pictures of obelisks, temples, pyramids, tombs and\r\nsphinxes, alongside of which a man looks but a few inches high.\r\n\r\nThey were very young as the world goes, and built huge structures\r\nbecause they were still filled with wonder at the immensity and power of\r\nthe things they saw in Nature,—the Nile; the great desert which seemed\r\nvaster to them because they had only slow-moving camels, elephants and\r\nhorses to take them about; they saw very long rainy seasons and the Nile\r\noverflowing its banks yearly, long dry seasons and the terrible wind and\r\nsand storms; the great heat of the sun, and the glory of their huge\r\nflowers, such as the lotus.\r\n\r\nJust as primitive people did, they personified Nature in the gods. They\r\nhad Osiris—god of Light, Health and Agriculture; Isis—goddess of the\r\nArts and Agriculture; Horus (hawk-headed), the Sun god; Phtah, first\r\ndivine King of Memphis, and many others. Again like primitive people,\r\nthey had music for their gods, for their temple services, for their\r\nstate ceremonies, festivals, martial celebrations and amusements.\r\n\r\nPrimitive music, we saw, had no laws to bind it, but was guided by the\r\nsavage’s natural feeling and he could make up anything he wished. In\r\nEgypt, because of state law which prevented it from changing, music was\r\nheld down to the same system for three thousand years. New music was\r\nforbidden, and much of the old was considered sacred and so closely\r\nconnected with religious ceremonies that it was allowed to be used only\r\nin the temples.\r\n\r\nThe priests lived in these magnificent temples and were the\r\nphilosophers, artists and musicians, very like the medicine men of the\r\nIndians, but much more advanced in learning.\r\n\r\nLike the American Indians, too, the profession of music was handed down\r\nfrom father to son, and only the children of singers, whether they had\r\ngood voices or not, could sing in the temples.\r\n\r\nOn the monuments we see these singers followed by players of\r\ninstruments. The singers were of the highest caste, or Priest caste; the\r\nplayers were usually of the lower classes, or the Slave caste, although\r\nas pictured on the tombs of Rameses, one of Egypt’s greatest rulers and\r\nbuilders, we see the priests dressed in splendid robes and playing large\r\nharps.\r\n\r\nThe temples of Egypt were so huge that the music had to be on a large\r\nscale. They thought nothing of an orchestra of six hundred players of\r\nharps, lyres, lutes, flutes and sistrums (bell rattles), whereas we\r\ntoday advertise in large type the fact of one hundred men in one\r\norchestra! We see no trumpets in the picture writings of the Egyptian\r\norchestra, for these were only used in war, and we find them only in\r\ntheir pictures of war and triumphal marches; nor do we see large drums,\r\nbecause the Egyptians clapped their hands to mark rhythm. However, the\r\nmilitary instruments in the hands of players pictured on the monuments,\r\nshow that they used trumpets and tambourines in the army.\r\n\r\nFrom the names we find in the tombs—“Singers of the King” and “Singers\r\nof the Master of the World,” we know that the Kings had musicians of\r\nhigh rank in their courts. The paintings on the walls and columns of the\r\nruins of the temple Karnak, show funeral services with kneeling singers,\r\nplaying harps of seven strings and other instruments.\r\n\r\nPtolemy Soter II, another famous Egyptian ruler, gave a fête in which\r\nwere heard a chorus of twelve hundred voices, accompanied by three\r\nhundred Greek _kitharas_ and many flutes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a fairy tale that we can bring back the manners and\r\ncustoms of three thousand years ago through studying the writings in\r\nstone called hieroglyphics, and by examining the things used every day,\r\nthat were found in the excavations. For a long time the hieroglyphics\r\nwere unsolved riddles until the discovery in 1799 A.D. of the Rosetta\r\nstone, on which was an inscription in hieroglyphics with its Greek\r\ntranslation. Although ancient Greek is called a dead language, it still\r\nhas enough life in it to bring back the history and records of\r\nantiquity. Through this knowledge of Greek, the Egyptian inscriptions\r\nspeak to us and tell us marvelous stories of ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn one of the tombs at Thebes, was a harp with strings of catgut, which\r\nwhen plucked, still gave out sounds although the harp had probably not\r\nbeen played upon in three thousand years!\r\n\r\nGoing once more to our ancient stone library—or collections of monuments\r\nin our museums or in Egypt—we see many pictures of dancers. The\r\nEgyptians danced in religious ceremonies as well as in private\r\nentertainments. They loved lively dances, and the men did all sorts of\r\nacrobatic steps and even toe-dancing like our Pavlowa, while the women\r\ndid the slow, languorous dances.\r\n\r\nEgyptian music was greatest as far back as 3000 B.C.! After that it grew\r\npoorer until 525 B.C. when Egypt was conquered by Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE EGYPTIAN SCALE\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians must have used a musical scale of whole steps and half\r\nsteps, covering several octaves, not unlike ours. Think of the piano\r\nkeyboard with its black and its white keys and you will get an idea of\r\nthe Egyptian scale. We learned this through the discovery of a flute\r\nthat played a scale of half steps from _a_ below middle _c_ to _d_ above\r\nthe staff with only a few tones missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ASSYRIAN MUSIC\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum in London and in the Louvre in Paris, you can see\r\nancient records which archaeologists unearthed from three mounds near\r\nthe River Tigris in Asiatic Turkey. These mounds were the remains of the\r\nAssyrian cities of Nimroud (Babylon), Khorsabad, and probably the famous\r\nNineveh, and date from 3000 to 1300 B.C.\r\n\r\nDid Assyria influence Egypt or was it the other way around? The\r\nEgyptians excelled in making mechanical things such as instruments,\r\nutensils, tools, and in building temples and pyramids; while the\r\nAssyrians were sculptors, workers in metals and enamel, and knew the\r\nsecret of dyeing and weaving stuffs, and of making beautiful pottery.\r\nBut whose music was the better, the Egyptians or the Assyrians, is\r\nimpossible to say. We do know, however, that the Assyrians, as well as\r\nthe Egyptians and Hebrews, had perfected music far beyond the standard\r\nreached by many nations of our own time.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrians had the same families of instruments that we have,—the\r\npercussion (or drums), wind, and strings; and they used different\r\ncombinations of instruments in concerts, either in instrumental\r\nperformances or for accompanying vocal music. Everything that we know\r\nabout them shows that the Assyrians were greater noisemakers than the\r\nEgyptians, for they not only had drums and trumpets, but they also\r\nmarked rhythm by stamping their feet instead of clapping their hands.\r\n\r\nThe instruments pictured on the monuments, probably existed many\r\ncenturies before the building of these monuments, which would make them\r\nvery old indeed. In fact, almost all of them are still in use in the\r\nOrient today and are played in the same way. The monuments also prove\r\nthat some of the special ceremonies in which music was used are still in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBoth the Assyrians and the Egyptians had flutes, and double flutes which\r\nwere actually two flutes connected by one mouthpiece and looked like the\r\nletter v. The Assyrians also had harps that varied in size from some\r\nthat could be carried in the hand, to some that stood seven feet high\r\nand had as many as twenty-two strings. The dulcimer, an instrument\r\nsomething like a zither, was very popular and was made so that it could\r\nbe played standing upright or lying flat. They also had drums,\r\ncastanets, cymbals, tambours or tambourines, and lyres, all of which\r\ncould be easily carried.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrians being a warlike nation made their instruments so that they\r\ncould be strapped to their bodies. So it seems that people in 3000 B.C.\r\nwere practical.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrians were so fond of music that when their war-prisoners were\r\nmusicians they were not put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HEBREW MUSIC\r\n\r\nWe get our knowledge of the Hebrew music not from stone monuments and\r\nwall pictures, but from Biblical writings and other ancient Hebrew\r\nrecords. In the Second Commandment, God forbids the Hebrews to make\r\nimages:\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of\r\nanything that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the\r\nwaters under the earth.” (Exodus XXI: 4.) With so strict a commandment,\r\nyou can understand why there are no pictures of singers and of\r\ninstruments, and that we have to go to the greatest literary gift to the\r\nworld,—the Old Testament, to find out about their music.\r\n\r\nThe first musician mentioned in the Bible is Jubal. It says in Genesis\r\nIV: 21, “he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe (or\r\norgan).” From an old Spanish book found in the early 18th century in a\r\nMexican monastery, comes the story that Jubal was listening to\r\nTubal-Cain’s forge, and noticed the difference in pitch of the sounds\r\nmade by the strokes on the anvil. Some tones were high, some low, and\r\nsome were medium. He compared this to the human voice, and tried to\r\nimitate the sounds, high, low and medium, of the forge. Thus he became\r\nthe first singer of the Hebrews. Jubal invented a flute and a little\r\nthree-cornered harp called the _kinnor_. These small instruments were\r\nmost convenient to carry about, for at this time the Hebrews were\r\nshepherd tribes wandering from place to place. Their music was simple as\r\nis the music of all primitive peoples.\r\n\r\nWe know from the Biblical story that the Children of Israel were sold\r\ninto captivity and remained many centuries in Egypt; that Moses was\r\nfound in the bulrushes by Pharoah’s daughter, and was educated as an\r\nEgyptian boy and “was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.”\r\nTherefore, he must have learned music from the priests. It is natural\r\nthen, that the Hebrews must have borrowed the music and instruments of\r\ntheir adopted country in the making of their own.\r\n\r\nAfter Moses had been commanded by the Lord to lead the children of\r\nIsrael out of the land of captivity, and after the Red Sea had divided\r\nto allow them to pass through, we read the great song of triumph sung by\r\nMoses:\r\n\r\n“Then sang Moses and the Children of Israel: ‘I will sing unto Jehovah,\r\nfor he hath triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown\r\ninto the sea, Jehovah is my strength and my song and he is become my\r\nsalvation.’” etc.—(Exodus XV: 1–2).\r\n\r\nAnd “Miriam, the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her\r\nhand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with\r\ndances.” (The timbrel is a small tambourine-like instrument.)\r\n\r\nThis story, like others in the Old Testament, is full of the accounts of\r\nmusical instruments, singing and dancing, and shows us that the ancient\r\nHebrews used music and the dance for nearly every event. If you read\r\ncarefully you will get the musical history of this poetic people.\r\n\r\nWhile the Children of Israel were in the wilderness, Moses received from\r\nJehovah the command: (Numbers X.)\r\n\r\n“Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make\r\nthem; that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for\r\nthe journeyings of the camp.”\r\n\r\nThen follow directions as to the meaning of the blowing of the trumpets.\r\nOne trumpet alone called the princes; two trumpets called the entire\r\ntribe together; an “alarm” gave the signal for the camps to go forward,\r\nand so on. So, you see the ancient Hebrews used trumpets much as we\r\ntoday use the army bugle. The trumpets mentioned as one of the earliest\r\nof all instruments called the people to religious ceremonies too; it\r\nannounced festivals, the declaration of a war, the crowning of a king,\r\nproclaimed the jubilee year, and gave warning of the anger of God.\r\n\r\nOne instrument has come down to our times and is still used in the\r\nHebrew temple services. This is called the _shofar_ and is usually a\r\nram’s horn on which two tones may be blown. Probably, as the ram was one\r\nof the animals of sacrifice, they used its horn as a sacred instrument.\r\nThis shofar is 5,000 years old, at least. It is sounded in all the\r\nsynagogues of the world on the Jewish New Year and on the Day of\r\nAtonement in memory of the wanderings of the Children of Israel.\r\n\r\nWhen the twelve tribes, after their wanderings in the wilderness, had\r\nsettled down in Palestine, they gave music a most important place in\r\ntheir daily life. Samuel, the last and most respected of the judges,\r\nbuilt a school of prophecy and music. Here it was that young David hid\r\nhimself to escape the persecutions of Saul. You remember that David is\r\ncalled the Great Musician and he gave us many of the Psalms, the most\r\nbeautiful religious verse in the world. How much it would mean to us if\r\nwe knew the music David sang to these songs! In spite of the fact that\r\nthe music in which they were originally sung has been lost, the Psalms\r\nhave been an inspiration to all composers of religious music throughout\r\nthe ages. David learned so much at Samuel’s school that he created a\r\nmost beautiful musical service for the temple, which is the basis of the\r\none used today in Jewish synagogues (temples).\r\n\r\nThe number that were instructed in the songs of the Lord was two\r\nhundred, four score and eight (288). There were in all four thousand,\r\nincluding assistants, students, players of instruments and the two\r\nhundred and eighty-eight professional singers.\r\n\r\nAll of these people did not perform at one time; for the ordinary\r\nservices they used twelve male singers, twelve players on\r\ninstruments,—nine harps, and two players of the psaltery and one of\r\ncymbals. Women were not allowed to sing in the temples but they were a\r\npart of the court and sang at funerals and at public festivities and\r\nbanquets.\r\n\r\nThe great Jewish historian, Josephus, tells us that Solomon had two\r\nhundred thousand singers, forty thousand harpists, forty thousand\r\nsistrum players and two hundred thousand trumpeters. This is hard to\r\nbelieve, but as everything belonged to the kings in bygone days,\r\nprobably this was only Solomon’s musical directory.\r\n\r\nThe psaltery was an instrument something like our zither, with thirteen\r\nstrings on a flat wooden sounding board, rectangular in shape. The\r\nsistrum was a metal rattle which made a very sweet sound.\r\n\r\nIt isn’t easy to describe the instruments used thousands of years ago,\r\nfor the names have become changed through the ages, and we find the same\r\ntype of instruments called by different names in different countries and\r\nperiods. For example, the psaltery is much the same instrument as the\r\n_dulcimer_, the Arab’s _kanoun_ and the Persian _santir_. We find the\r\nsame psaltery in Chaucer’s “Miller’s Tale” as _sautrie_. By the addition\r\nof a keyboard this Biblical instrument became the _spinet_, which you\r\nwill meet again in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 13th century, in\r\nItaly, we find a kind of psaltery hung around the neck and called\r\n“Istroménto di porco” because it looked like the head of a pig.\r\n\r\nNot all the songs of the Bible are religious. The Song of Solomon, a\r\nmost beautiful poem of marriage, gives us a vivid picture of luxury and\r\nmagnificence, as well as showing us that music was used for other than\r\nreligious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Solomon, the music in the temple lost its splendor\r\nand again the Children of Israel were made captive. When one hundred\r\nyears later Nebuchadnezzar (586 B.C.) the King of Babylon, destroyed\r\ntheir temple, the song of the Hebrews became sad and mournful, as you\r\ncan read in the Book of Lamentations and in this beautiful song of\r\ngrief, the 137th Psalm:\r\n\r\n\r\n            SORROWS OF THE EXILES IN BABYLON\r\n\r\n        By the rivers of Babylon\r\n        There we sat down, yea, we wept,\r\n        When we remembered Zion.\r\n\r\n        Upon the willows in the midst thereof\r\n        We hanged up our harps.\r\n\r\n        For there they that led us captive required of us songs,\r\n        And our tormentors required of us mirth, saying:\r\n        “Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.”\r\n\r\n        How shall we sing Jehovah’s song\r\n        In a foreign land?\r\n\r\n        If I forget thee, Oh Jerusalem,\r\n        Let my right hand forget her skill.\r\n\r\n        Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth\r\n        If I remember thee not;\r\n        If I prefer not Jerusalem,\r\n        Above my chief joy.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few centuries the Hebrews became scattered over the\r\nworld, carrying with them their reverence for God, their love of poetry\r\nand song, and their religious customs. These qualities have persisted\r\nthroughout the centuries, and some of the greatest musicians in the\r\nworld have been of Hebrew origin.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the old music has passed away, there is still enough of\r\nits spirit left in their temple services to give some idea of the\r\nancient Hebrew music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a panel in a Museum (delle Terme) in Rome._\r\n\r\n  _Greek Girl Playing a Double Flute (auloi)._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a frieze in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts._\r\n\r\n  _Greek Boy Playing the Lyre._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n      The Greeks Lived Their Music—The Romans Used Greek Patterns\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks “dwelt with beauty” and believed it to be a part of being\r\ngood, and they strove to make everything beautiful. Beauty to the Greeks\r\nwas a religion. Had this not been so, we would not have the Venus de\r\nMilo, the Parthenon in Athens, the Hermes, the Winged Victory (Niké of\r\nSamothrace) and all the other Greek masterpieces which no modern\r\nsculptor or builder has surpassed.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see a nation 400 years before the time of Christ\r\nand even earlier, making glorious art works in stone, and writing the\r\ngreatest plays the world has ever had, being more grown up than modern\r\nnations, and yet as far as we know an infant in the art of music. We\r\nhave only the slightest idea of how their music sounded as they had no\r\naccurate way of writing it, and had only very primitive instruments.\r\nAlthough when compared to their other arts their music was not great,\r\nstill it was very important to them and they used it constantly with\r\npoetry, dancing, and in the drama.\r\n\r\nThe word music was first used by the Greeks and has been carried into\r\nnearly every language; we find _musique_ in French, _Musik_ in German,\r\n_musica_ in Italian, and so on.\r\n\r\nMusic, according to the Greeks, was an art which combined not only the\r\nplaying of instruments, singing and dancing, but also all the arts and\r\nsciences, including mathematics and everything in the universe. It took\r\nits name from the Muses, and they believed that it led to the beautiful\r\naccord and harmony of the world.\r\n\r\nThe nine Muses were daughters of Jupiter, and each presided over some\r\nparticular department of literature, art and science.\r\n\r\nClio: Muse of History and Epic Poetry. She is shown in statues and\r\npictures holding a half open scroll.\r\n\r\nThalia: Muse of Joy and Comedy (drama) with a comic mask in one hand and\r\na crooked staff in the other.\r\n\r\nErato: Muse of Lyric Poetry, inspired those who wrote of love. She plays\r\non a nine-stringed lyre.\r\n\r\nEuterpe: Muse of Lyric Song, patroness of music especially of flute\r\nplayers. She holds two flutes (_auloi_).\r\n\r\nPolyhymnia: Muse of Sacred Song. She holds her forefinger to her lips or\r\ncarries a scroll.\r\n\r\nCalliope: Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry, holds a roll of parchment,\r\nor a trumpet.\r\n\r\nTerpsichore: Muse of the Dance, presiding over choral, dance and song.\r\nShe appears dancing with a seven-stringed lyre.\r\n\r\nUrania: Muse of Astronomy, holds the globe and traces mathematical\r\nfigures with a wand.\r\n\r\nMelpomene: Muse of Tragedy (drama), leans on a club and holds a tragic\r\nmask.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MYTHS AND LEGENDS\r\n\r\nThe myths and legends of the ancient Greeks read like fairy tales, but\r\nto the Greeks they were what our Bible stories are to us. In their rich\r\nmythology we find many stories about the beginnings of music.\r\n\r\nTo Pan, the god of woods and fields, of flocks and shepherds, is given\r\nthe credit of inventing the shepherd’s pipe, or Pan’s Pipes. He lived in\r\ngrottoes, wandered on the mountains and in the valleys, and amused\r\nhimself hunting, leading the dances of the nymphs, and playing on his\r\npipes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PAN’S PIPES\r\n\r\nA beautiful nymph named Syrinx was loved by Pan, but every time that he\r\ntried to tell her of his love, she became frightened and ran away, for\r\nPan was a funny looking lover with goat’s legs, a man’s body, and long\r\npointed ears. One day he chased her through the woods to the bank of a\r\nriver; she called out in fright, and was suddenly changed by her friends\r\nthe Water Nymphs, into a clump of tall reeds. When he reached out to\r\nembrace her, instead of Syrinx, he had the clump of reeds in his arms!\r\nAs he sighed in disappointment, his breath passing through the reeds,\r\nproduced a sad wail. Pan, hearing in it a plaintive song, broke off the\r\nreeds in unequal lengths, bound them together, and made the first\r\nmusical instrument, which he called a syrinx in memory of his lost\r\nsweetheart. These pipes comforted Pan, and he played many tender\r\nmelodies, and often without being seen, was known to be near by his\r\nlovely music.\r\n\r\nPan, although adored, was feared. At one time, Brennus, a warrior, with\r\na company of Gauls (a tribe from ancient France), attacked the Temple of\r\nDelphi (in Greece), and was about to destroy it, when suddenly they\r\nturned and fled in fear although no one pursued them. Their terror was\r\nsupposed to have been of Pan’s making, and to this day we use the word\r\n“panic” (Pan-ic) for all sudden overpowering fright.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 APOLLO\r\n\r\nPan is supposed to have taught music to Apollo, the god of Music and of\r\nthe Sun. You have seen statues of him with a lyre in his hands. As Pan’s\r\npupil he learned to play the syrinx so beautifully that he won a prize\r\nin a contest with Marsyas, a mortal who played the flute invented\r\n(according to the Greek legend), by Pallas Athene. This goddess was\r\nsometimes known as Musica or Musician. When Cupid saw her play the flute\r\nhe laughed at her because she made such queer faces. This angered her,\r\nand she flung her flute away. It fell down from Mt. Olympus to the\r\nearth, and Marsyas picked it up and became such a skilful player that he\r\nchallenged the god Apollo to a contest for flute championship of the\r\nworld! The day came and Apollo won the prize, but put Marsyas to death\r\nfor daring to challenge him—a god. Apollo afterwards was very sorry and\r\nbroke all the strings of his lyre and placed it with his flutes in a\r\nhaunt of Dionysus (god of Wine), to whom he consecrated these\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThese stories are not only a part of the ancient Greek religion but they\r\nhave become, on account of their beauty, a rich source of plot and story\r\nfor the works of musicians, artists and writers from the days of\r\nantiquity to our own time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ORPHEUS\r\n\r\nOne of the favorite Greek stories has been that of Orpheus, who went\r\ndown to Hades to bring his dead wife whom he adored, back to earth, and\r\nabout whom Peri, Gluck, and others wrote operas. He was son of Apollo\r\nand of Calliope, the Muse of Epic Poetry, and became such a fine\r\nperformer on all instruments, that he charmed all things animate and\r\ninanimate. He tamed wild birds and beasts, and even the trees and rocks\r\nfollowed him as he played, the winds and the waves obeyed him, and he\r\nsoothed and made the Dragon, who guarded the Golden Fleece, gentle and\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nOn the cruise of the _Argo_ in search of the Golden Fleece, Orpheus not\r\nonly succeeded in launching the boat when the strength of the heroes had\r\nfailed in the task, but when they were passing the islands of the\r\nSirens, he sang so loudly and so sweetly that the Sirens’ songs could\r\nnot be heard and the crew were saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MUSIC IN THEIR DAILY LIFE\r\n\r\nWhen a people have legends about music you may know that they love it.\r\nSuch was the case with the Greeks. They did not call their schools high\r\nschools and colleges but Music schools, and everything that we call\r\nlearning they included under the name of music. Every morning the little\r\nGreek boy was sent to the Music school where he was taught the things\r\nthat were considered necessary for a citizen to know. Here he learned\r\ngymnastics, poetry, and music. At home too, music was quite as important\r\nas in school, and we know that they had folk songs which had to do with\r\nthe deeds of ordinary life, such as farming and winemaking and\r\ngrape-picking, and the effect and beauty of the seasons of the year.\r\n(See Chap. IX.) They can well be divided into songs of joy and songs of\r\nsorrow, and seem to have existed even before Homer the Blind Bard. If\r\nyou ever have tried to dance or do your daily dozen without music, you\r\nwill understand at once how much help music always has been to people as\r\nthey worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HARVEST SONGS\r\n\r\nAll harvest songs in Greece had the name of Lytiersis. Lytiersis was the\r\nson of King Midas, known as the richest king in the world. Lytiersis was\r\na king himself but also a mighty reaper, and according to Countess\r\nMartinengo-Cesaresco who has written a book called _Essays in the Study\r\nof Folk-Songs_ it was his “habit to indulge in trials of strength with\r\nhis companions and with strangers who were passing by. He tied the\r\nvanquished up in sheaves and beat them. One day he defied an unknown\r\nstranger, who proved too strong for him and by whom he was slain.” The\r\nfirst harvest song was composed to console King Midas for the death of\r\nhis son. We can make a fable from this story which means that Nature and\r\nMan are always struggling against each other.\r\n\r\nThe harvest festivals founded in Greece led to others in Brittany,\r\nFrance, North Germany and England. So does the deed of one race affect\r\nother races.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE LITURGIES\r\n\r\nAmong the taxes, or five special liturgies, that the Greeks had to pay,\r\nwas the obligation for certain rich citizens to supply the Greek\r\ntragedies with the chorus. Every Greek play had its chorus and every\r\nchorus had to have its structures; a choregic monument to celebrate it;\r\none or more flute players, costumes, crowns, decorations, teachers for\r\nthe chorus and everything else to make it succeed. This cost, which\r\nwould equal many thousands of dollars, was undertaken as a duty quite as\r\neasily as our men of wealth pay their income taxes. You can see a\r\ngreatly enlarged copy of a choregic monument, the Soldiers’ and Sailors’\r\nmonument at 89th Street and Riverside Drive, in New York City, and also\r\none at the Metropolitan Museum.\r\n\r\nIn old Greece the musicians were also poets. Homer, Hesiod, Pindar,\r\nÆschylus, Sophocles, Sappho, Euripides, Plato, not only wrote their\r\ndramas but knew what music should be played with them. In fact no play\r\nwas complete without its chorus and its music and its flute-player. You\r\nhave heard of the Greek chorus. Don’t for a moment think it was like our\r\nchorus. It consisted of a group of masked actors (all actors in those\r\ndays wore masks), who appeared between the acts and intoned (chanted)\r\nthe meaning of the play and subsequent events. In fact the chorus took\r\nthe place of a libretto,—“words and music of the opera,” for it\r\nexplained to the audience what it should expect. It spoke and sang some\r\nof the most important lines of the play and danced in appropriate\r\nrhythms. So it brought together word, action and music, and was a remote\r\nancestor of opera, oratorio and ballet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FESTIVALS\r\n\r\nBesides the occupational songs and those for the drama festivals, the\r\nGreeks had the great game festivals where in some, not only competitions\r\nin sports took place but also flute playing and singing. The oldest of\r\nthese festivals was the Olympic games, first held in 776 B.C. and every\r\nfour years thereafter. These games played so important a part in the\r\nlives of the Greeks that their calendar was divided into Olympiads\r\ninstead of years. While music was evident in the Olympic games, music\r\nand poetry were never among the competitions.\r\n\r\nThe Pythian games were chiefly musical and poetic contests and were\r\nstarted in Delphi, 586 B.C., where they were held every nine years in\r\nhonor of the Delphian Apollo whose shrine was at Delphi. The Isthmian\r\nand Nemean games were also based on poetic and musical contests.\r\nWarriors, statesmen, philosophers, artists and writers went to these\r\ngames and took part in them. Maybe some time we will realize the power\r\nof music as did the Greeks nearly one thousand years before the birth of\r\nJesus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GREEK SCALES\r\n\r\nWhile, as we said before, we know very little about the melodies of the\r\nGreeks, we do know something about their scales, upon which the church\r\nmusic of the Middle Ages was based, as are our own major and minor\r\nscales. In fact the most important contribution Greece made to our music\r\nwas the scale. They had a very complicated system and no one is quite\r\nsure how it worked.\r\n\r\nWe have the two modes or kinds of scales, major and minor, which we use\r\nin different keys, but the Greeks had at least seven different modes\r\nused in many different ways. They used one mode for martial or military\r\nmusic, another for funeral ceremonies, another for their temple music,\r\nand curiously enough, our own C major scale they used for their popular\r\nmusic, for drinking songs, and light festivities.\r\n\r\nThe Greek scales were based on _tetrachords_, from the Greek words\r\ntetra-four, chord-string that is, a group of four strings. If you play\r\non the piano B C D E and C D E F and D E F G you will find the three\r\ntetrachords that formed the _primary modes_ of the Greeks:—Dorian,\r\nPhrygian and Lydian.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have heard in Greek architecture of the Doric column which\r\ncame from Doria, a province in Greece, and the Ionic column, from Ionia,\r\nand so on. In the same way the scales were named for sections of the\r\ncountry from which they first came, Dorian mode, Ionian, Æolian,\r\nPhrygian, Lydian, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Greek tetrachord was formed on the interval of a fourth, for example\r\nfrom E to A—these were called _standing tones_, because the intervals\r\nbetween the two standing tones or permanent tones could be changed but\r\nthe first and the fourth always remained the same—\r\n\r\n             Dorian, ⏜E F⏜ G A: Phrygian, E ⏜F G⏜ A ⏜G# A⏜\r\n                       ½                      ½       ½\r\n                     step                   step     step\r\n\r\nBy putting two tetrachords together all the other Greek scales were\r\nformed. These fell into two classes, and according to Cecil Forsyth in\r\nhis _History of Music_ these classes were called the _join_ and the\r\n_break_. When the second tetrachord began on the fourth tone of the\r\nfirst tetrachord, Mr. Forsyth calls it the _joining_ method, thus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ⎴E͡FGA⎴——⎴A͡B♭CD⎴]\r\n\r\nWhen the second tetrachord began on the tone above the fourth tone of\r\nthe first tetrachord, he calls it the _breaking_ method, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ⎴E͡FGA⎴ ⎴B͡CDE⎴]\r\n\r\nBy using the _join_ and the _break_ with each of the three modes,\r\nDorian, Phrygian and Lydian, you can see to what a great variety of\r\nscales and names this would lead. The Greeks spoke of their scales from\r\nthe top note down, instead of from the lowest note up, as we do.\r\n\r\nThe first _kithara_ was supposed to have been an instrument of four\r\nstrings that could be tuned in any of these different ways, with the\r\nhalf-step either between the first and second strings, or between the\r\nsecond and third, or between the third and fourth. Two instruments tuned\r\ndifferently formed the complete scale, but it did not take long to add\r\nstrings to their lyres and kitharas so that they could play an entire\r\nscale on one instrument.\r\n\r\nThe little Greek boy was taught in school to tune the scale according to\r\nthe fourth string of his lyre, which was the _home tone_ or what we\r\nshould call _tonic_. Our tonic falls on the first degree of the scale,\r\nbut in the _primary modes_ of the Greeks, the tonic fell on the fourth\r\ndegree, and was called the _final_. When the final was on pitch all the\r\nother strings had to be tuned to it.\r\n\r\nThese tetrachords are supposed to have been perfected by Terpander, in\r\nthe six hundreds before Christ. His melodies were called _nomes_ and\r\nwere supposed to have had a fine moral effect on the Spartan youth in\r\ngiving him spirit and courage. The Greeks thought that all music and\r\nthat every one of their modes had a special effect on conduct and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAfter the Messenian war, Sparta was in such a state of upheaval that the\r\nDelphian oracle was consulted. The answer was:\r\n\r\n                  “When Terpander’s Cithar shall sound\r\n                  Contention in Sparta shall cease.”\r\n\r\nSo the Spartans called upon Terpander to help them, and through the\r\npower of his song all was peace again.\r\n\r\nTerpander collected Asiatic, Egyptian, Æolian and Bœotian melodies all\r\nof which are unfortunately lost; he invented a new notation and enlarged\r\nthe kithara from four strings to seven. Arion, Alcæus and the great\r\npoetess Sappho were his pupils, and Sappho is often shown in statues\r\nwith a six stringed kithara.\r\n\r\nMost of these poet singers were called “lyric poets” because they sang\r\nto the accompaniment of the lyre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PYTHAGORAS\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were the first to write down their music, or to make a\r\nmusical notation whereby the singers and players knew what tones to use.\r\nTheir system was their alphabet with certain alterations. They had names\r\ndescribing each tone not unlike our use of the word _tonic_ for the\r\nfirst degree of the scale, and _dominant_ for the fifth and so on.\r\n\r\nOf course they did not have the _staff_ and _treble_ and _bass clefs_ as\r\nwe have, but they were groping for some way of recording music in those\r\nfar away days.\r\n\r\nPythagoras as far back as 584–504 B.C., not only influenced the music in\r\nthe classical Greek period (400 B.C.), but down to and throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages to the Renaissance (1500s). To this day music is based on\r\nhis mathematical discovery. He worked out a theory of numbers based on\r\nthe idea that all nature was governed by the law of numbers and modern\r\nscientists have proven that he was correct in many of his ideas. In fact\r\nour orchestras and pianos are tuned in accordance with his theories.\r\n\r\nHe invented an instrument called the monochord which consisted of a\r\nhollow wooden box with one string and movable fret. He discovered that\r\nwhen he divided the string exactly in half by means of the fret, the\r\ntone produced was an octave higher than the tone given out by striking\r\nthe entire string; one-third of the string produced the interval of a\r\nfifth above the octave; one-fourth the length of the string produced a\r\nfourth above the fifth; one-fifth produced a third (large or major)\r\nabove the fourth; one-sixth produced a third (small or minor);\r\none-seventh produced a slightly smaller third and one-eighth produced a\r\nlarge second, three octaves above the sound of the entire string:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (FUNDAMENTAL TONE)]\r\n\r\nThe truth of Pythagoras’ theory of tone relationship has been proven by\r\nan experiment in physics showing that all of the above tones belong to\r\nthe same tone family. An amusing experiment can be made by pressing\r\nsilently any one of the tones marked 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8, and striking\r\nthe fundamental tone sharply, the key you are pressing silently will\r\nsound so that you can distinctly hear its pitch.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks seem to have had no harmony (that is, combining of two or\r\nmore tones in chords) outside of the natural result of men’s voices and\r\nwomen’s singing together. But they had groups of singers answering each\r\nother in what is called _antiphony_ (anti-against, phony-sound). Even\r\nour American Indians have their song leader and chorus answering each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nGreek rhythm followed the rhythm of the spoken word and was considered a\r\npart of their poetic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GREEK INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the _syrinx_, Pan’s Pipes, the instrument of\r\nPan, the satyrs and of the shepherds; the _monochord_, Pythagoras’\r\ninvention; the _lyre_ and _kithara_; and the flute or _aulos_.\r\n\r\nThe lyre, of the family of stringed instruments, was the Greek national\r\ninstrument. It was the first to be used in their musical competitions,\r\nand helped in the forming of the Greek modes. These were of two types,\r\nthe lyre and the kithara. The first lyres which came down from the age\r\nof myths and fables were originally made of the shell of a tortoise and\r\nhad four strings (the tetrachord) and later seven and even more strings.\r\nThis form of the lyre was called _chelys_, or the tortoise, and was used\r\nfor accompanying drinking songs and popular love songs.\r\n\r\nThe _kithara_ was also called lyre, but was not made of the body of the\r\ntortoise, and it became the Greek concert instrument, and was only used\r\nby professionals, while the _chelys_ was used in the home. It came\r\noriginally from Asia Minor and Egypt. It had four strings at first but\r\nthese were gradually added to, until there were fifteen and eighteen\r\nstrings. It was sometimes small and sometimes large, and was held to the\r\nbody by means of a sling and was played with a plectrum or pick.\r\n\r\nThe Greek flute or _aulos_ was a wood-wind instrument more like our oboe\r\nthan our flute. It was usually played in pairs, that is, one person\r\nplayed two flutes or _auloi_ of different sizes at one time, and they\r\nwere V shaped. There was a group of _auloi_ differing in range like the\r\nhuman voice differs, and covering three octaves from the bass _aulos_ to\r\nthe soprano.\r\n\r\nThe _aulos_ was first a single wooden pipe with three or four finger\r\nholes which later were increased to fifteen or sixteen so that the three\r\nmodes Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian, could be played on one pair of\r\n_auloi_. About six centuries before the Christian era, the double flute\r\nbecame the instrument of the Delphian and Pythian musical competitions.\r\n\r\nIn the chorus too, we read that for each drama there was a special\r\n_aulos_ soloist who always played the double flute.\r\n\r\nThere were other type instruments such as the war trumpets, trumpets\r\nused in the temple services, and harps (_magadis_) that were brought\r\nfrom Egypt, but the real instruments of the Greeks pictured in their\r\nsculpture and on their vases and urns, and spoken of in their\r\nliterature, are the lyres and auloi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ROMAN MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe Romans, law givers, world conquerors and road builders, gave little\r\nnew to music, for they did not show a great talent for art. They were\r\ninfluenced by Greek ideals and Greek methods. They were warlike by\r\nnature, and from defenders of their state they became conquerors. As\r\nthey grew nationally stronger and more secure, they learned music,\r\noratory, architecture and sculpture from Greek teachers. Many Romans\r\nwell known in history were singers and gifted players on the Greek\r\nkithara, lyre, and flute (aulos).\r\n\r\nThe Romans seemed to have cared more about the performing of music than\r\nfor the composing of it, and “offered prizes to those who had the\r\ngreatest dexterity, could blow the loudest or play the fastest.”\r\n(Familiar Talks on History of Music.—Gantvoort.)\r\n\r\nAs they come to America today the musicians of other lands flocked to\r\nRome, especially those who played or sang, because they were received\r\nwith honor and were richly paid.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, among them Boethius (6th century B.C.), wrote treatises on\r\nthe Greek modes, were very much interested in the theory of music, and\r\nbuilt their scales like the Greeks. To each of the seven tones within an\r\noctave they gave the name of a planet, and to every fourth tone which\r\nwas the beginning of a new tetrachord, the name of a day of the week\r\nwhich is named for the planet.\r\n\r\n           B        C        D      E      F        G       A\r\n        Saturn   Jupiter  Mars    Sun    Venus  Mercury   Moon\r\n        Saturday                  Sunday                  Monday\r\n\r\n           B        C        D      E      F        G       A\r\n        Saturn   Jupiter  Mars    Sun    Venus  Mercury   Moon\r\n                          Tuesday               Wednesday\r\n\r\n           B        C        D      E      F        G       A\r\n        Saturn   Jupiter  Mars    Sun    Venus  Mercury   Moon\r\n                 Thursday                Friday\r\n\r\nThe days of the week in French show much more clearly than in English\r\nthe names of the planets, in the case of Tuesday—mardi, (Mars);\r\nWednesday—mercredi (Mercury); Thursday—jeudi, (Jupiter);\r\nFriday—vendredi, (Venus).\r\n\r\nThe Greeks brought their instrument, the _kithara_, to Rome, and with it\r\na style of song called a _kitharoedic chant_, which was usually a hymn\r\nsung to some god or goddess. The words, until three hundred years after\r\nthe birth of Jesus, were in the Greek language; the Latin kitharoedic\r\nsongs like those of the poets Horace and Catullus were sung at banquets\r\nand private parties, Cicero too, was musical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art._\r\n\r\n  _Chinese Instruments._\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 5.—Trumpets._\r\n  _Fig. 6.—Te’ch’ing—sonorous stone._\r\n  _Fig. 7.—Yang-Ch’in or Dulcimer._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fiddles from Arabia (Fig. 8, Rebab); Japan (Fig. 9, Kokin); Corea\r\n    (Fig. 10, Haggrine) and Siam (Fig. 11, See Saw Duang)._\r\n]\r\n\r\nEdward MacDowell in _Critical and Historical Essays_, says that\r\ninstrumental music was no longer used merely to accompany voices and had\r\nbecome quite independent. The flute (aulos) players performed better\r\nthan the lyre and kithara players and were liked better. They played\r\n“dressed in long feminine, saffron (yellow)-colored robes, with veiled\r\nfaces, and straps around their cheeks to support the muscles of the\r\nmouth.” They played with an astonishing amount of technical skill. “Even\r\nwomen became flute players, although this was considered disgraceful.”\r\nThe prices paid to these flute players were higher than the amounts\r\nreceived by our opera singers.\r\n\r\nThe Roman theatre, unlike the Greek, was not a place to honor their\r\ngods. Greek plays, both tragedy and comedy, were replaced with\r\npantomime, usually accompanied by orchestra and singing. The orchestra\r\nwas made up of “cymbals, gongs, castanets, foot castanets, rattles,\r\nflutes, bagpipes, gigantic lyres, and a kind of shell or crockery\r\ncymbals, which were clashed together.”\r\n\r\nThe Roman _tibia_ or bagpipe is still popular today with the peasants of\r\nItaly. Although the bagpipe is first mentioned in Rome, there are some\r\nPersian terra cotta figures made before the Roman era, showing players\r\nof the bagpipes. It is always said that Nero played the fiddle while\r\nRome burned and even our motion pictures show him playing the violin to\r\nthe accompaniment of flames. How could he have played on a violin when\r\nit had not as yet been invented? If he played any instrument while Rome\r\nburned, it was probably the tibia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\nThe Orientals Make Their Music—Chinese, Japanese, Siamese, Burmese, and\r\n                                Javanese\r\n\r\n\r\nTo hear two Chinamen exchanging greetings on a street corner, you would\r\nthink they were singing or rather chanting, not because their tones are\r\nparticularly pleasant for they are high and nasal and hard, but because\r\nthey are talking in their own peculiar way. The Chinese have what is\r\ncalled an inflected language in which they use many tones. For example\r\nthe syllable “hi” in one tone will mean one thing and it will mean\r\nsomething else entirely in each different inflection. Here again is a\r\ncase where it is hard to say where speech ends and song begins. Another\r\namusing thing about the Chinese is the way, according to our ideas, they\r\nseem to twist every thing around, so that what we call high tones they\r\ncall low tones; they wear white for mourning and we wear black; their\r\nguests of honor sit at the left of the host and ours sit at the right;\r\nthey consider taking off the hat very bad manners and of course we\r\nconsider it bad manners for a man to keep it on in the house or when\r\ntalking to a lady.\r\n\r\nThey never used their music as a way of expressing beauty as other\r\nnations have done, but treated it as we would a problem in arithmetic or\r\na cross-word puzzle, and they loved to write articles on the subject\r\nthat would seem long and dull to us. However, as far back as 2255 B.C.\r\nTa Shao composed a piece of music which Confucius, 1600 years later,\r\nsaid, “enchanted him to such an extent that he did not know the taste of\r\nfood for months.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After a print by Gakutei—about 1840._\r\n\r\n  _The Koto-Player._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After print by Kuniyasu—about 1830._\r\n\r\n  _The Wandering Samisen-Player._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SCALES\r\n\r\nTheir scale was the pentatonic and they had the queerest names for their\r\ndegrees or steps.\r\n\r\n           F the first degree was called       Emperor\r\n           G  „   2d     „     „    „      Prime Minister\r\n           A  „   3d     „     „    „      Loyal Subjects\r\n           C  „   4th    „     „    „     Affairs of State\r\n           D  „   5th    „     „    „    Mirror of the World\r\n\r\nThis shows that music must have been limited to a very few subjects.\r\n\r\nWhen the scale of five steps was changed into a scale of seven steps\r\nabout 600 B.C., every one thought that the end of music had come.\r\nHowever these two new notes B and E which formed half steps in the scale\r\nwere given very interesting names: Leader and Mediator. We, today, call\r\nB the leading tone, and E the mediant, so in this case, the Chinese were\r\nnot quite so topsy-turvy as usual. But in true Chinese fashion they\r\nthought that a mythical bird Fung-Woang and his mate had invented the\r\nsteps and the half steps. The whole steps to them stood for perfect and\r\nindependent things such as heaven, sun and man; the half steps stood for\r\ndependent things such as earth, moon and woman.\r\n\r\nThey had 84 scales! Think of that and be happy! For we have only two\r\nmodes, major and minor, and twelve different sounding scales in each.\r\n\r\nWe get very little pleasure out of Chinese melodies for they seem to\r\nwander about aimlessly and do not end comfortably, nor do they seem to\r\nbegin anywhere! The best melodies are found among the oldest sacred\r\nmusic and among the songs of the sailors and mountaineers. The sacred\r\nhymns and the songs of the people have come down unchanged from earliest\r\ntimes. The music of their theatres we like least of all as it is\r\nsing-sing, shrill and nerve racking.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of an ancient hymn in the pentatonic scale:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHINESE SACRIFICIAL HYMN TO THE IMPERIAL ANCESTORS\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nHow the Chinese like noise! Their orchestras are seventy-five percent\r\nnoise makers: drums of all kinds and sizes, bells, stones beaten with\r\nmallets, cymbals, wooden clappers, a row of tuned stones and copper\r\nplates strung up to be hammered, and wooden tubs beaten sometimes from\r\nthe inside and sometimes from the outside. They also have wind\r\ninstruments of clay and flutes of bamboo and metal. The _cheng_, their\r\nmost pleasing wind instrument, is made of a hollow gourd with bamboo\r\ntubes of different lengths inserted. Their most popular stringed\r\ninstruments are the _kin_, a primitive guitar, and the _cha_, a sort of\r\nlarge zither with twenty-five strings. These instruments date back to\r\nbarbaric times.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious that we have come across is the _king_ which is\r\nsupposed to have been invented by _Quei_, a mythical youth like the\r\nGreek Orpheus. It is a rack hung with two rows of sixteen different\r\nsized stones, which are struck with a wooden mallet. This instrument\r\ngoes back to 2300 B.C. It seemed so important to the Chinese that they\r\nhave a special kind of _king_ called the _nio-king_ upon which only the\r\nEmperor could play. Another little instrument almost as queer as the\r\n_king_, made of slats of wood tied together and shaped like a fan, used\r\nto beat time, was called the _tchoung-tou_. It was held in one hand and\r\nstruck against the palm of the other much as one would play with a fan.\r\n\r\nIn making their instruments, the Chinese used eight different sounds in\r\nnature which they found musical—the sound of skin (drums), stone (_king_\r\nand _nio-king_), metal (flutes, bells, gongs, cymbals and trumpets),\r\nclay (instrument like an ocarina moulded into fantastic animal shapes),\r\nwood (drums and boxes), bamboo (flutes and parts of the _cheng_), silk\r\n(strings on the _che_ and _king_ and other stringed instruments), gourds\r\n(sound boards which held the tubes of the _cheng_, one of the ancestors\r\nof the modern organ).\r\n\r\nAs early as the 5th century B.C., one of the first books on music in the\r\nworld was written by a friend of Confucius, the great teacher and\r\nphilosopher. We know about the ancient Chinese music, not from\r\nhieroglyphics and parchments, but from the music they use today, which\r\nis the same as that of barbaric times. The law against new things\r\nprevailed there as it did in Egypt, and where the government controls\r\nart, there can be little progress.\r\n\r\nHowever we might have known much more about music had not Emperor She\r\nHuang-Ti “the book destroyer” ordered all musical instruments and books\r\nto be destroyed (246 B.C.) except those about medicine, agriculture and\r\nmagic. For generations after, the people heard little music but the\r\nnoise of tumbling bells and dancers’ drums.\r\n\r\nTheir popular music has always been very poor with no particular form or\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JAPANESE MUSIC\r\n\r\nFrom the many Japanese prints, and cups and bowls decorated with\r\nfascinating pictures of the dainty little men and women playing the\r\n_samisen_ and _koto_, we feel as if we had met these far away people\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe _koto_ and the _samisen_ have remained unchanged for hundreds of\r\nyears. It is said that the _koto_ was first made of several hunting bows\r\nplaced side by side and that later they were joined together as one long\r\nsounding board across which the strings were drawn. In the prints we see\r\nthe long zither-like instruments lying flat on the floor and the dainty\r\nlittle players in fancy kimonos beside them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the same print a companion will be seen playing a _samisen_,\r\na long necked instrument whose strings are plucked with a pick or\r\nplectrum, such as we use for the mandolin. Whether these prints are a\r\nhundred years old or the work of an artist today, makes little\r\ndifference, for we find the instrument unchanged and the little player\r\nin the same lovely kimono. These instruments have been in use in Japan\r\nfor hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nThe music and instruments of the Japanese are very like those of the\r\nChinese, not only because they are of like race, but because the\r\nJapanese are great imitators and have borrowed from China not only music\r\nbut art. The Japanese love music for itself, not as the Chinese love it\r\nas subject for debate, but they have not written any better music than\r\ntheir neighbors on the mainland.\r\n\r\nIf you have listened to the music of _Madame Butterfly_, an opera by\r\nGiacomo Puccini, you will have heard a number of Japanese melodies, some\r\nof which are real. The composers of Europe and America love to imitate\r\nthe oriental music because it gives them a chance to make effects quite\r\ndifferent from those possible in our own music. Besides, the oriental\r\npeople seem very picturesque to us and stir our imagination. Henry\r\nEichheim of Boston has written Chinese and Japanese Impressions in which\r\nhe has used many of the native instruments,—bells, rattles and drums.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have great love of beauty which shows itself in their\r\nfestivals, held in the spring when the cherry trees blossom and azaleas\r\nbloom. Then, too, their Geisha dances are full of grace and have the\r\nmost winning names, such as, Leaf of Gold and the Butterfly dance. At\r\nthe time of the festivals bands of musicians and dancers rove from place\r\nto place in gay costumes and add greatly to the fun. The Geisha girls\r\nare trained to sing and dance to the accompaniment of the _koto_ and\r\n_samisen_ to amuse the people.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese and Chinese are Buddhists, or worshippers of the prophet\r\nBuddha. In their temples they chant the whole service on one note\r\naccompanied by the sound of cymbals and the tolling of a deep rich gong.\r\nWe know these gongs for we have often been called to dinner by them in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 years ago a musician named Yatsubashi, the father of Japanese\r\nnational music, invented a way of writing down music for the _koto_.\r\nEach string has a number and this number is set down and is read from\r\ntop to bottom instead of from left to right on the staff, as we read\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nOf late years Japan has been interested in European customs and has\r\nadopted so many of them that they are called the “Frenchmen of the\r\nEast.” Among other things that they imitate is our musical system. So\r\ntoday they have symphony concerts and piano and song recitals in which\r\nthey hear European artists and they themselves perform music of our\r\ncomposers. They send many of their young people to Europe and America to\r\nstudy music. This may lead to discarding their own music in time even as\r\nthey are giving up the kimono, for our less picturesque costume.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SIAMESE, BURMESE AND JAVANESE\r\n\r\nThe yellow races seem to like the same kind of music and use almost the\r\nsame instruments. Nevertheless each nation has its own special\r\ninstruments. For example, the Burmese have a drum organ made of\r\ntwenty-one drums of different sizes, hung inside of a great hoop; they\r\nalso have a gong organ in which fifteen or more gongs of different sizes\r\nand tones are strung inside a hoop. The player sits or stands inside the\r\nhoop and plays the surrounding gongs. Sometimes it looks very funny to\r\nsee a procession in which this instrument is carried by two men while a\r\nthird walks along inside a hoop, striking the gongs not only at the side\r\nand in front of him but also behind him. (Figure 14.)\r\n\r\nThis instrument is a very important part of the Javanese orchestra\r\ncalled the _gamelon_ in Java. Their particular musical possession is the\r\n_anklong_, a set of bamboo tubes sounded by striking them. We have heard\r\nsome Javanese songs sung by Eva Gauthier and we found great beauty in\r\nthem. Many of these songs are centuries old.\r\n\r\nIn these countries the people are very fond of making musical\r\ninstruments which look like animals and the things they see around them,\r\nas for instance, the Burmese _soung_, a thirteen stringed harp, with a\r\nboat shaped body and a prettily curved neck. Think, too, of playing as\r\nthey do in Burma and Siam on a harp or zither shaped like a crocodile!\r\n(Figures 12 and 13.)\r\n\r\nThe Siamese use more wind instruments than the people of other Oriental\r\nlands. When Edward MacDowell, our famous composer, heard the Siamese\r\nRoyal Orchestra in London, he decided that each musician made up his\r\npart as he went along, the only rule being to keep up with each other\r\nand to finish together. The fact that they thought they were doing a\r\nreally lovely thing made the concert seem very comical. But the\r\nOrientals can return the compliment. A few years ago the Chinese\r\ngovernment sent some students to study in Berlin but after a month’s\r\ntime they asked to be called home because, “It would be folly,” they\r\nsaid, “to remain in a barbarous country where even the most elementary\r\nprinciples of music had not been grasped.” (From _Critical and\r\nHistorical Essays_ of Edward MacDowell.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City._\r\n\r\n  _Instruments of Burmah and Siam._\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 12.—Soung—boat-shaped harp._\r\n  _Fig. 13.—Megyoung—crocodile harp._\r\n  _Fig. 14.—Kyll Weing—gong organ._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City._\r\n\r\n  _A Burmese Musicale._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            INCAS AND AZTECS\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Orientals, we want to cross the bridge with you\r\nbetween the Orient (East) and the Occident (West). Sometimes we find the\r\nsame customs and ways of doing things in places very far apart.\r\nSometimes this likeness will appear in a religious ceremony, a dance or\r\nsong, a piece of pottery, or in a musical instrument. To find these\r\nsimilarities makes one believe that at sometime in the world’s history,\r\nthese people so far away from each other, must have been closely\r\nrelated. Such a likeness can be traced in the music of the ancient\r\nChinese and the Aztecs of Mexico, and the Incas of Peru, some of which\r\nhas been sung to us by Marguerite d’Alvarez, from Peru. The Peruvians\r\nplayed pipes and had music in the same rhythm as the sacred chants of\r\nthe Chinese. The Mexicans had all kinds of drums, rattles, stones,\r\ngongs, bells and cymbals which resemble the Chinese instruments. On the\r\nother hand we read in Prescott’s _Conquest of Peru_ of a Sun Festival\r\nwhich recalls the Sun Dance of our own American Indian. The Inca or the\r\nruler of Peru, his court and the entire population of the city met at\r\ndawn in June and with the first rays of the sun, thousands of wind\r\ninstruments broke forth into “a majestic song of adoration” accompanied\r\nby thousands of shouting voices.\r\n\r\nFrom the kind of instruments that the Aztecs in Mexico used, we know\r\nthat their music was more barbaric than that of the Peruvians. A curious\r\ncombination of love for music and barbarism is shown in the custom they\r\nhad of appointing each year a youth to act as the God of music, whose\r\nname _Tezcatlipoca_, he was given. He was presented with a beautiful\r\nbride and for the one year he lived like a prince in the greatest\r\nluxury. He learned to play the flute and whenever the people heard it,\r\nthey fell down and worshipped him! But this wonderful life was not all\r\nit seemed, for at the end of the year the beautiful youth was offered as\r\na living sacrifice to the blood-thirsty God of Music whom he was\r\nimpersonating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n       The Arab Spreads Culture—The Gods Give Music to the Hindus\r\n\r\n\r\nArabia is the southwestern peninsula of Asia and is bounded by the Red\r\nSea, Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. It was well situated to come in\r\ncontact with the ancient nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThis story of Arabia and its music will include all those peoples to\r\nwhom the Arabs gave of their learning. Saracen, Mussulman, Mohammedan\r\nand Islamite are different names for the same people, but they are all\r\nArabs, even though they are not Arabians living in Arabia.\r\n\r\nArab music fills in the gaps between the ancient civilizations, the\r\nbeginnings of early Christian music and the time of the Minnesingers and\r\nthe Troubadours.\r\n\r\nDuring the years we call the Dark Ages (500 to 1300 A.D.), Europe was in\r\na semi-barbarous state and there was little learning outside of the\r\nmonasteries. All the culture and advances made by the Greeks and Romans\r\nseemed in danger of perishing in the raids and attacks of barbarous\r\ntribes, and wars among the early European peoples. But the Arabs, on\r\nwhom we look today as almost barbarians, were the highly cultured race\r\nof that far-off time.\r\n\r\nThey were great mathematicians and from them we have Algebra and our\r\nArabic numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. From them we have the arabesques, or\r\nthe intricate geometric designs in carvings and traceries, seen on\r\nbuildings in the countries where the Arabs built, lived, roamed or\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nLong before the Christian era there were very wonderful Arabian\r\nuniversities in Bagdad and Damascus, so famous that they attracted many\r\nGreek and Hebrew scholars to learn from the Arabian philosophers and\r\nwise men.\r\n\r\nMohammed, their greatest prophet, who was born in 570 A.D., wrote their\r\nholy book called the _Koran_. While he lived the Arabs were at the\r\nheight of their power.\r\n\r\nBecause they had studied the learning of the past, and had invaded and\r\nconquered parts of Europe, the Arabs brought to Europe their arts and\r\nsciences and the learning of the ancient nations. Through their\r\nconquests they also carried their ways of living into the countries of\r\nthe barbarians. For example, in 711, they drove the Goths out from Spain\r\nand set up their own caliphs (rulers) in that country, so that at this\r\ntime they had two capitals—the original Bagdad and one at Cordova. From\r\nthese Arabs, who came from Mauretania in Africa to Spain, descended the\r\npeople we call Moors. It is for this reason that we have traces of Arab\r\nmusic and the Moorish architecture or Arab-like buildings of which the\r\nAlhambra is best known, in Spain. In Cordova, grew up a center of\r\nlearning, far greater than any in the surrounding countries. At the\r\nuniversity was a library of over 600,000 manuscripts not yet in book\r\nform, for printing had not been invented. Here, too, great chemists\r\nstudied and discovered alcohol, sulphuric and nitric acids. The clock\r\nalso was invented by the Arabs, and the game of chess was first thought\r\nout when the Chinese were already playing Mah Jong! They were\r\nresponsible, too, for trigonometry as well as algebra, and they knew how\r\nto make cotton goods, and were famous for the Damascus steel out of\r\nwhich the swords of the heroes for many generations were forged. Even\r\ntoday Damascus steel is looked upon as excellent.\r\n\r\nAs they were worshippers of Mohammed, they were not permitted to make\r\nportraits of human beings in stone or on parchments for they believed\r\nthat they would be deprived of their souls at the day of judgment should\r\nthey reproduce the human form. So they put their artistic efforts into\r\ncolor and design.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with their conquest of the Goths, they decided to enter\r\nFrance, but were kept out by Emperor Charlemagne who thought\r\ndifferently, and stopped them. It was due to this conflict that the\r\ngreat epic _La Chanson de Roland_ (The Song of Roland) was written.\r\n\r\nThen came the Crusades, the expeditions which went on for many years to\r\nwrest the shrine of the Saviour from the hand of the Mussulman. These\r\nwars continued so long, that nearly every European group of people came\r\nin contact with the Arab, and in so doing, learned much from him.\r\n\r\nThe Arab was a courageous, loyal person, proud and ready to die for his\r\nown ideas; he was courtly, yet careful in all business dealings and many\r\nof his traits were passed on to his descendants. Very rapidly the rough\r\nwarrior of the desert was transformed into a luxury-loving, cultured\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians seemed to be great musical blotters; because they blotted\r\nup or absorbed music wherever they went and made it theirs! But they\r\nwere unlike blotters for loving it; they made a science of it and passed\r\nit on to other nations and thence to us.\r\n\r\nSo much of the Persian music was absorbed by the Arab that it would be\r\ndifficult to separate them in our story. The Arabs took the very\r\nloosely-put-together music of Persia and made it over into better form.\r\nEven before the Mohammedan conquests (700–800 A.D.), Arab music was well\r\nplanned, and as they spread later to North Africa, Egypt, Morocco,\r\nGreece, Italy, and Spain, they left some traces of their own music and\r\ntook something of the music of the natives. Furthermore, they adopted\r\nmany of the instruments that they found and they became the ancestors of\r\nsome of our own.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Arabs did not write down their music, but handed it on from\r\nmusician to musician, gaining and losing very little from the many hands\r\nthrough which it passed. They have none of what we call harmony or\r\naccompaniment, as in their orchestras all the instruments except the\r\ndrums play the same tune; the drums mark the time and often play very\r\ncomplicated rhythms. This makes their music sound confused to us, but by\r\nhearing it often you learn in what an orderly way it is done, and you\r\nwill see why many people like it.\r\n\r\nThe caliphs (rulers) had court musicians and probably more music was\r\nplayed and more scientific treatises on music were written by these\r\npeople than by any other mediæval or ancient race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE ARAB SCALES\r\n\r\nThere has been much argument about Arab music as to whether the scale\r\nwas divided into seventeen steps or eight, as is our scale. Some people\r\nthink they hear it as seventeen tones divided into one-third steps, but\r\nBaron d’Erlanger, a great authority on ancient Arab music, says that\r\nthere are two distinct musical systems still in use. One comes from\r\ntheir ancient home in Asia, and the other from the Pharaohs of Egypt.\r\nAnd the fact that these two systems have been mixed in using them leads\r\nto the question of what the real scale is. Baron d’Erlanger finds, as\r\nthe result of his experiments, that if we could lower, ever so slightly,\r\nthe third and seventh tones of our scale, we would have the old Pharaoh\r\nscale in its simplest form. The other scales can be played on stringed\r\ninstruments on which there are no fixed tones as there are on a keyboard\r\ninstrument like a piano, and can therefore play the intervals that do\r\nnot exist on the piano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Laura Williams, American Singer of Arab Songs, in Native Costume,\r\n    Accompanying Herself on El oud (the Lute)._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say how many scales or modes the Arabs use, because\r\neach change of the tiniest part of a step creates a new mode, and there\r\nare many combinations possible. Some say that there are thirty-four\r\nmodes; another says that there are twenty-four, one for each hour of the\r\nday. There are also modes for the four elements—fire, water, earth, and\r\nair; for the twelve signs of the zodiac, and for the seven planets.\r\n\r\nEach mode has a name, called after all sorts of things like cities or\r\ntribes or ornaments, in fact, anything familiar to the people.\r\n\r\nThe weird effects made by the _Gloss_ or musical ornaments like the\r\ntrill, grace notes and slidings give the music a dreamy fascinating\r\ncharacter, the charm of which is increased by its frequent changes from\r\ndouble to triple time, or from triple to double.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nIt is through the instruments that we can trace the Arab influence in\r\nour own music. When we come to the story of the Troubadours, you will\r\nsee them using the lute, the principal instrument of the Middle Ages.\r\nThis was called _el oud_, which gradually became _lute_, because the\r\nEuropeans heard the words that way.\r\n\r\nSo you can see here, how art travels through the chances and changes of\r\nwars, wanderings, conquests and political shiftings of power among the\r\ndifferent nations.\r\n\r\nMost of the Arab instruments are of Persian, Egyptian and Greek origin,\r\nbut as we said above, the Arab became so mixed with other peoples of the\r\nworld, that in wandering about, what is really theirs in music or\r\ninstruments, or what was borrowed from others, is difficult to tell. But\r\nwe can tell you that the popular music of the Arab, as you hear it\r\ntoday, in bazaars and cafés of Northern Africa and in parts of Asia\r\nwhere Arabs are still to be found, has remained practically unchanged\r\nthroughout the centuries. Even the instruments are the same.\r\n\r\n_El oud_ still remains the popular instrument and shares its popularity\r\nwith the _kanoun_, which is probably of Persian origin. This _kanoun_ is\r\nlike a zither, and is specially tuned for every scale. It is said that\r\nthe Arab spends three-quarters of his life tuning his instruments.\r\n\r\nBaron Rodolphe d’Erlanger, an Englishman living in Tunis, has spent\r\ntwelve years studying the ancient Arabian music in order to preserve it,\r\nfor it is dying out through the arrival of modern European civilization\r\naccompanied by phonographs, jazz and radios.\r\n\r\nTheir viols are of real interest because it is claimed that they are the\r\nancestors of the great violin family. These ancestors are of different\r\nstyles and are called the _rebab_ and _kemangeh_, sometimes played with\r\nthe bow and sometimes without. They have _kissars_ and _lyres_ and\r\nvarious forms of zithers, besides the _kanoun_. The Arabs’ fondness for\r\nstrings is proof that they were indeed sensitive and fine, while most of\r\ntheir neighbors liked the drums and brasses much more, showing a lower\r\ngrade of civilization. By this we do not mean that the Arabs were not\r\nfond of their drums, because the drum was one of the chief features of\r\ntheir music. Indeed they had many kinds—the _atambal_ which looks like\r\ntwo kettle-drums hitched together; the _derbouka_ which is really a vase\r\nwith a skin stretched over the base; the _taar_ like our tambourine; the\r\n_bendaair_, an open faced shallow drum, with snares (cords) stretched\r\nacross inside the head somewhat like our own snare drum; and the _dof_,\r\na squarish drum played with the hands and knuckles like the _taar_, but\r\nwith the snares. The Hebrews had an instrument like this called the\r\n_tof_ or _toph_ and the Persians also had the _dof_ or _duff_. So, here\r\nagain, you see how one nation affects the other. (Figure 8.)\r\n\r\nThen they had flutes called the _ijaouak_ and _gosba_ with three or more\r\nholes, which they used for sad tunes.\r\n\r\nEvery visitor to a Mohammedan country is introduced to Arab religious\r\nmusic at day-break, noon and sun-down, by the muezzin (priest) who calls\r\nthe faithful of Mohammed to prayer, from an opening in the tower of a\r\nmosque. This call has been handed down to the Mohammedans from a time\r\neven before the coming of Mohammed (6th century A.D.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MOHAMMEDAN CALL TO PRAYER\r\n\r\n          [Music:\r\n          Al-la-ho ak-bar\r\n          Al-la-ho a-kbar ach ha-dou en-nâ la e-lah ell Al-lah\r\n          Ach ha-dou en-nâ.\r\n          Mo-hammed ra-soul Al-lah\r\n          Al-la-ho-ak-bar lâ e-lah ell-Allah\r\n\r\n          From ‘THE ART OF MUSIC’\r\n          ]\r\n\r\nTHE GODS GIVE MUSIC TO THE HINDUS\r\n\r\nThere had been so much conquest and battling in India, that although we\r\nknow much about Hindu music it is very difficult to tell what really\r\nbelonged to the Hindus and what was brought to them.\r\n\r\nThe native legends tell us that the gods gave music to the people and\r\nall through the music there are signs to show their power and influence.\r\nThe literature of India can be traced back many centuries and through it\r\nwe see what an important place song held. There were minstrels in the\r\nancient courts whose duty it was to chant songs in praise of their royal\r\nmasters. In their religious ceremonies, too, music held a high place.\r\nOne of their holy books says: “Indra (their chief god) rejects the\r\noffering made without music.” The Hindu people are divided into many\r\nclasses, which they call castes, and in ancient times the singers were\r\nmembers of the priest caste. The Hindus love music and have always used\r\nit for all festivities, in the drama, and in the temples.\r\n\r\nThe singing of poems from ancient time has always been popular and\r\ndancing too, and here, as among the Japanese, have grown up trained\r\ndancers called the Bayaderes or Nautch girls. (Chapter V).\r\n\r\nMusic is still used in India to appease and please the gods and to plead\r\nfor rain or sunshine.\r\n\r\nTravelers to India relate that they have heard the beating of drums,\r\naccompanied by solo voice or by a chorus, continued for several days at\r\na time. When there has been a drought, and rain is needed, this long\r\ndrawn out music is used as a means to ask the god to bring rain.\r\n\r\nIn the Temple of the Sacred Tooth in Ceylon (India) on each night of the\r\nfull moon, the sacred books are chanted by relays of yellow-robed\r\npriests, following each other every two hours from dark to dawn. They\r\nchant in deep resounding voices without a pause. The Buddhist priests\r\nhave repeated these sacred texts on every night of the full moon for\r\ntwenty-eight centuries!\r\n\r\nIn India they have made a deep study of color and sound and things we\r\nknow very little about, and to which we attach very little importance.\r\nThrough their study of the laws of sound and color, the Hindus feel sure\r\nthat they are related. Edward Maryon in “Marcotone” says: “Chemistry and\r\nMathematics prove that the Natural Scales of Light and Sound in\r\nPrinciple are one, and therefore the Primary Colors of the Solar\r\nSpectrum, and the Primary Tones of the Musical Scale have the same\r\n_ratio_ of speed vibrations. Therefore both _Tone_ and _Color_ can be\r\nscaled so that a given number of Lightspeeds (Colors), will equal a\r\ngiven number of Soundwaves (Tones).”\r\n\r\nWhen Edward Maryon was in India he visited one of the temples and in\r\nwatching the prayer wheels, noticed that a certain wheel moving at a\r\ncertain speed produced a certain sound and a certain color, while\r\nanother wheel moving at a different speed produced a different tone and\r\na different color. It interested him so much that he learned from a\r\nHindu priest about the relation of light and sound. This led to very\r\ninteresting experiments and results which he has used in teaching music.\r\nThe color red is supposed to correspond with the musical sound middle C,\r\norange with D, yellow with E, green with F, blue with G, indigo with A,\r\nand violet with B. And recently in America we have been interested in\r\nseeing a color organ, the “Clavilux” invented by Thomas Wilfred which\r\nplays tones of colors instead of tones of sound.\r\n\r\nThis is a direct twentieth century result of the so-called “magic” of\r\nprimitive times. From this you can see how the magic of ancient days is\r\nexplained by modern science.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HINDU RAGS\r\n\r\nThe Hindu songs presided over by special gods were called _rags_, but of\r\ncourse, the name has no relationship whatever to our _ragtime_.\r\n\r\nIt seems that religious feeling has dominated everything in the Orient;\r\nfor this reason every idea connected with music has a corresponding idea\r\nin Hindu mythology. The _rags_ were all named after the gods who brought\r\nmusic down from heaven to comfort man. The character of each god or\r\ngoddess was supposed to be reflected in the _rag_, and it was not the\r\nresult of scientific study as were, for instance, the scales of the\r\nChinese. Our knowledge of the _rag_ has come down to us from what\r\nSanskrit writers on Indian music have said, and what is practised today\r\nby the modern Hindu. No doubt Arabia and Persia once had a music system\r\nvery much like this one of the Hindus.\r\n\r\n_Rags_, _ragas_, or _raginis_ were neither airs nor modes in our sense\r\nof the words, but something like the modes of the Arab songs, they were\r\nmelodic forms, or themes, on which musicians either improvised or\r\ncomposed new songs, by using them in rhythms of endless variety.\r\n\r\nThere were many many _rags_, and they were under the guidance of the\r\ngods of the rainy season, the cold season, the mild, the hot, etc., and\r\ncould only be sung during their special seasons. It was thought that\r\nthese songs sung at the wrong time would bring down calamity. Again, as\r\nwith the American Indian (Chapter II), we find tribes who are most\r\ncareful to sing certain music at certain times.\r\n\r\nIt is told that a Hindu nobleman, long ago, tried to sing a night song\r\nin the daytime and darkness covered all things within the sound of his\r\nvoice!\r\n\r\nAs important as was the song from the earliest time, instrumental music\r\nheld almost an equal place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ORCHESTRA\r\n\r\nThe Hindu orchestra is sometimes large and sometimes small. Its dances\r\nare lively and vigorous, and very seldom slow and romantic. Nevertheless\r\nthey have many kinds of songs, some lively and some not, such as: songs\r\nin honor of Krishna (one of their principal gods), official odes, war\r\nhymns, love songs, evening songs, wedding songs, cradle and patriotic\r\nsongs. In some, the Arab seems to have influenced the Hindu music,\r\nbecause they have the lively rhythm and the variety of the Arab music,\r\nyet it is difficult to know which one influenced the other. The Arab\r\nmusic has the variety and luxurious soft beauty in popular dances equal\r\nto anything our modern musicians or poets have composed.\r\n\r\nThe playing of instruments, accompanying songs with Sanskrit texts, was\r\nsupposed to give energy, develop heroism, make a peaceful heart, and\r\ndrive away harm and impurity.\r\n\r\nThe members of the different castes or sects had and still have meetings\r\nheld sometimes in private houses and sometimes in the temples, when they\r\nsang religious hymns. Among the higher classes, they went to the expense\r\nof having good musicians and of giving artistic performances, but among\r\nthe common people, their idea was that the greater the noise the more\r\nthey showed their devotion, so they sang, beat drums and blew whistles\r\nwithout any regard for time or melody, and you can imagine the effect\r\nwas pandemonium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NOTATION\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to write the Hindu music in European notation, because\r\ninstead of dividing the scale into semi-tones or half-steps, they use\r\nquarter tones.\r\n\r\nMargaret Glyn, in her book, _Evolution of Musical Form_, writes:\r\n\r\n“In the East notation is in an elementary condition, the staff being\r\nunknown. The Hindus, Chinese, and Abyssinians have ancient note-signs,\r\nconsisting of a kind of letter to which some indication of time is\r\nadded, but in this respect the Chinese system is wanting, having\r\npractically no time-notation. Probably note-signs existed in Persia and\r\nArabia, but these do not appear to have survived. The modern Arabic\r\nnotation is but three hundred years old, and is said to have been\r\ninvented by one Demetrius de Cantemir who adapted the letters of the\r\nTurkish alphabet for the purpose. This has eighteen tones to the octave\r\n(we have twelve), and is used in Turkey and other countries of the near\r\nEast.”\r\n\r\nThe Hindus seem to like both triple (3 beats) and duple (2 or 4 beats)\r\nrhythm. The scheme changes according to the poetry of the song, and the\r\npitch and the length of tones are shown by Sanskrit characters and\r\nspecial signs or words.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nThe Hindus have spent much time in studying music and the instruments of\r\nwhich they have many kinds. There are the strings, there are skins\r\nsounded by beating, instruments struck together in pairs, and those that\r\nare blown. They like the strings best. The characteristic instrument is\r\nthe _vina_, usually of wood or bamboo strengthened by one to three\r\ngourds as sounding boards, and having five or seven wire strings played\r\nsomething like the zither, but sometimes with a bow. (Figure 16.) There\r\nare many varieties of the _sitar_, an instrument like a lute, and many\r\nviols of which the _sarinda sarunja_ is typical and is played with a\r\nbow. (Figure 17.)\r\n\r\nAmong the percussion instruments are tambourines, castanets and cymbals;\r\nthey had wind instruments such as flutes (seldom transverse or blown in\r\nfrom the side, and often played by blowing on them through the\r\nnostrils), trumpets, horns, bagpipes and oboes. Certain instruments were\r\nused only by the priests, others by beggars, and others by dancing\r\ngirls. Imagine how weird a story could be told in music if a modern\r\nsymphony orchestra played a piece of music telling of life among the\r\nHindus. Maybe some of the readers of this book will get an idea for a\r\nHindu tone poem, who knows?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City._\r\n\r\n  _Hindu Instruments._\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 15.—Tabla—drum._\r\n  _Fig. 16.—Kinnari—Vina, a stringed instrument._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 17._\r\n\r\n  _Sitar (Strings) Trumpet._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 18._\r\n\r\n  _Hindu Instruments._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Childhood of Music\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                 What Church Music Imported from Greece\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the centuries when the Eastern nations were powerful the European\r\ncontinent was inhabited by primitive men, who had gradually formed\r\ntribes. They had rude songs, dances, and crude instruments. They used\r\ntheir music in religious ceremonies, to celebrate war victories and\r\nsuccessful hunting expeditions, to sing to their sweethearts, and to\r\naccompany their work in the fields and homes, much as the American\r\nIndian did. Many manners and customs of the Anglo-Saxon (English),\r\nTeutonic (German), Norse (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian), Celtic (Irish)\r\nand Gallic (French) races may be traced back to these barbaric days, and\r\neven the beginning of national schools of music may be found.\r\n\r\nAlthough a thousand years passed between the Greek musical era and the\r\n“Golden Age” of Christian Church music, much that happened in that time\r\nis hidden in darkness. The nations and tribes were fighting for\r\nexistence and were developing into the nations which we know today.\r\n\r\nIslam or the Mohammedan religion, and not Christianity, was the great\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar (100–44 B.C.), the great Roman General, conquered Gallia\r\n(France), then invaded the land of the Teutons (Germany) and even\r\nreached England. In parts of northern Europe, one still sees the remains\r\nof great roadways, aqueducts or water works, and bridges, that the\r\nRomans built during their invasions.\r\n\r\nIn the Cluny Museum in Paris is a great hall built as a bath by the\r\nRomans. In Bath, England, the city was named for the ancient Roman baths\r\nstill existing, and you can see the pipe lines which carried the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DARK AGES\r\n\r\nThe world at that time was not a happy place in which to live. There was\r\nconstant warfare between the once powerful Roman Empire and these\r\nbarbaric tribes. The poorest people were oppressed and many were slaves,\r\nbought and sold by the rich land owners and army leaders.\r\n\r\nInto such a world was the child, Jesus, born—a world with little love\r\nfor humanity, little unselfishness, little sympathy for the down-trodden\r\nand unhappy, few kind words for the poor or the sick, little justice and\r\nless mercy. No wonder that His teachings brought new life and gave hope\r\nto the people!\r\n\r\nFor several centuries following the birth of Christ, the world went\r\nthrough a period called the Dark Ages. Rome, the city of glorious\r\nvictories and brilliant culture became the prey of the barbaric\r\ntribes—Huns, Goths, Visigoths, Vandals, Franks, Saxons, and Slavs,—until\r\nit seemed that civilization would be wiped out and people would become\r\nprimitive again.\r\n\r\nMusic was saved during the Dark Ages through a small band of faithful\r\nfollowers of Jesus Christ, who founded a church in His name. That their\r\nmusic should have been made up of existing tunes and words is very\r\nnatural. Jesus, himself, brought up in the religion of the Hebrews,\r\noften sang the Psalms of David. The beautiful traditional music of the\r\nJewish synagogues found its way into the services of the early Christian\r\nChurch, because many of the believers were Hebrews. Soon the Hebrew\r\nBible texts were translated into Latin—the everyday language of the\r\nRomans, and as most of these early Christians lived in Rome, they\r\nfollowed the rules of music the Romans learned from the Greeks. So, our\r\nChurch music was influenced both by the Hebrews and Greeks.\r\n\r\nFor about three hundred years the early Christians had to hold their\r\nservices in secret, as they were punished even by death when caught, for\r\nnot worshipping Jupiter and the Roman gods. They were not rich and\r\ninfluential, but just humble folk to whom the teachings of Jesus came as\r\na joyous comfort. They had no beautiful palaces where they could hold\r\nservices, and at the same time hide from the Roman centurions, so they\r\nworshipped in dark and secret places and could not have much music as it\r\nwould have attracted the attention of their enemies. The early\r\nChristians shunned music, too, because it had been used for the wild\r\ndances and festivals of their pagan oppressors. As they were poor and\r\nuneducated, they had had little training and lacked money to buy\r\ninstruments, so all in all music had a hard time to keep alive.\r\n\r\nFrom what we can gather, they chanted their Psalms much as did the\r\nHebrews and had responses which sounded like soft and monotonous\r\ndroning.\r\n\r\nAs time went on emperors like Constantine, began to take away the death\r\npenalty from those believing in Christ and gradually as the Romans saw\r\nthe beauty of His teachings they became Christians in increasing\r\nnumbers. Many of these Romans came from the upper classes, and as Greek\r\nwas the language of culture they had had a thorough Greek education and\r\nowned many instruments, so they brought their Greek musical inheritance\r\nto the growing band.\r\n\r\nThus, the chants composed in Rome for the _kithara_ were the direct\r\nancestors of our Christian hymns. These early hymns were also a bridge\r\nbetween the single melody line of the Orient and Greece and Rome, and\r\nthe many melody lines, called polyphonic music, of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 325 A.D., Emperor Constantine made Christianity the national religion\r\nof Rome. He also founded the Christian Church in Byzantium, later called\r\nConstantinople, and all through the Dark Ages, in many parts of Europe,\r\nthe cathedrals and church schools were the only gleam of learning in a\r\ntime of darkness and struggle.\r\n\r\nAfter the Roman Empire reached its greatest height, in the 2nd century,\r\nit gradually grew weaker and during the 4th and 5th centuries, the\r\nGoths, Vandals and Huns drove the government from Rome to\r\nConstantinople. In the 7th century Mohammedanism rose and swept over\r\nSyria, Egypt and North Africa, and reached Spain in the 8th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANSWERING MUSIC\r\n\r\nIt is related that St. Ignatius (49–107 A.D.) one of the early Christian\r\nfathers, had a vision in which he heard the Heavenly choirs praising the\r\nHoly Trinity, in alternating chants, and he was so impressed by it, that\r\nhe introduced into the Church the idea of two choirs of singers\r\nanswering each other.\r\n\r\nIn singing the Psalms of David, the Hebrews used this idea of antiphonal\r\nmusic. (Anti—against, phonal—sounding: antiphonal—sounding against each\r\nother.) We see it too in the Greek choruses, in the Roman kitharoedic\r\nchants (chants accompanied by the _kithara_), and now in the early\r\nChristian hymns. From this antiphonal music to the later polyphony\r\n(poly—many, phony—sounds: many voices or parts) is a natural step. Here\r\nagain is an instance of the influence of one nation on another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PATRON SAINT OF MUSIC\r\n\r\nAmong the martyrs to the cause of the Christian faith, was St. Cecilia,\r\na member of a noble Roman family, who was put to death for becoming a\r\nChristian about 177 A.D. She is believed to be buried in the Roman\r\ncatacombs (underground burial chambers) and is the patron saint of\r\nmusic, and she is supposed to have invented the organ.\r\n\r\nIt was St. Ambrose (333–397 A.D.) who worked out the first system for\r\nchurch music and put it on a foundation that lasted for two hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GREEK MODES AS MODELS\r\n\r\nSt. Ambrose built scales modeled on the old Greek modes and they were\r\ngiven Greek names, but somehow the names became mixed so that the mode\r\ncalled by Ambrose, Dorian (from D to D on the white keys of the piano)\r\nwas the Greek Phrygian; and the Phrygian (E to E) of Ambrose was called\r\nDorian by the Greeks; F to F is the Lydian mode; G to G, the Mixolydian.\r\nThese were the four authentic _Ecclesiastical_ or _Church Modes_.\r\n\r\nSt. Ambrose felt it his duty to make over the church music because\r\npopular street songs had crept in with the Hebrew Psalms and Greek and\r\nRoman chants! It was much the same effect as if you entered a church and\r\nheard the organ and choir performing “Yes, We Have No Bananas.” This is\r\na funny comparison because it is said that a part of “Yes, We Have No\r\nBananas” is stolen from Handel’s great “Hallelujah” Chorus from the\r\noratorio _The Messiah_.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, schools were formed to train singers in these new hymns\r\nand church services, and a way to write down the music composed by St.\r\nAmbrose and his followers was needed. The Greek letters had been used in\r\nRome, but now a new system called _neumes_ appeared; this word comes\r\nfrom the Greek and means “breath” and the neumes simply marked where one\r\nshould breathe in chanting the hymns. There were eight signs with Latin\r\nnames which gave full directions when to raise and lower the voice.\r\n\r\nThe system of Neumes notation looks like our present day shorthand and\r\nwas a help, though, should we use it now we would think it anything but\r\na help.\r\n\r\nWhile the Neumes writing showed how to mark the time, it had a serious\r\nshortcoming, because it did not outline the melody exactly. It indicated\r\nwhether the melody rose or fell, but just how much was a question not\r\ndefinitely shown. An unfamiliar chant could not be sung until the\r\nnotation had been worked out. It took five years for a choir singer to\r\nbe able to sing the music!\r\n\r\nWhen the singers sang solos, they ornamented the songs and sang anything\r\nthey pleased! This made variety but it must also have caused much\r\nconfusion! The people may have learned this ornamental singing of the\r\nArab, from _The Gloss_. (Page 59.)\r\n\r\nThe next step was the Gregorian chant which even today is sung in the\r\nRoman Catholic Churches.\r\n\r\nTo the four authentic scales of St. Ambrose, St. Gregory who was Pope\r\nfrom 590 to 604 added four more called _plagal_. He did not invent these\r\nscales but based them on the old Greek and Ambrosian modes. To each\r\nauthentic scale, he added a plagal scale starting four tones below it,\r\nand to the name of the authentic mode is added the prefix _hypo_.\r\n\r\nEach authentic mode and its _hypo_ are related.\r\n\r\nHere is a table of these related modes, and their names:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After a painting by Garofalo, National Gallery at Rome._\r\n\r\n  _Saint Cecilia—Patron Saint of Music._\r\n  (_Holding a portative organ._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After a painting by Maxence, in Paris._\r\n\r\n  _Book of Peace._\r\n]\r\n\r\n      AUTHENTIC SCALES OR MODES            PLAGAL SCALES OR MODES\r\n       (St. Ambrose’s Scales)              (St. Gregory’s Scales)\r\n\r\n    I.

Hypo-Mixo-Lydian:\r\n         g a bc͡ d ef͡ g                       d ef͡ g a bc͡ d\r\n\r\nWe have marked the half-steps _bc͡_ and _ef͡_, and in every mode they\r\nfall on different degrees of the scale. This shifting of the half-steps\r\ntells us the name of the mode.\r\n\r\nIn order to try to give you a definite idea of how the church modes\r\nworked, we have written the familiar national hymn _America_ in each\r\nmode (see page 74). Play them, and you will see how one differs from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nKatherine Ruth Heyman has used a similar idea in her little book _The\r\nRelation of Ultramodern to Archaic Music_ in explaining Greek Modes.\r\n\r\nIt took many years to establish this music and it was not until the time\r\nof Charlemagne (742–814) that it became a real system called Plain Chant\r\nor Plain-song (from the Latin, _cantus planus_).\r\n\r\nPope Gregory founded the _Schola Cantorum_, school of singers, at Rome,\r\nand with these trained people he tried to establish for all Christian\r\nchurches, a way to sing systematically and well. They studied nine\r\nyears, and everything had to be memorized, for only the leader had a\r\nsong book. Books were written by hand and were hard to get. The teacher\r\nhad a monochord, the instrument invented by Pythagoras, to give the\r\npitch, for all the singing was done without accompaniment. The singing\r\nmust have improved greatly after Gregory became Pope, for before his\r\nreform, music had become a stunt with no solemnity, and people in the\r\nchurches waved handkerchiefs if the stunt pleased them!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICA]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A LONG JOURNEY\r\n\r\nAt any rate the Gregorian chant flourished and was so loved that\r\nBenedict Biscop, and other monks interested in music, came from far-off\r\nEngland to learn the chant invented by St. Gregory. A long journey! In\r\n675 Biscop sent to Rome for singers and built monasteries very close to\r\na pagan temple, where the Anglo-Saxons still worshipped the Roman Sun\r\ngod, Apollo, also god of music. These he filled with beautiful relics,\r\npaintings and stained glass windows, Bibles and service books\r\nilluminated in gold and color, which he brought from Rome.\r\n\r\nBringing things from Rome may sound easy to you, but fancy the travel\r\nand inconvenience when there were no steamships, no railroads, no\r\naeroplanes, but only Roman roads, which however marvelous, were long and\r\nwearisome by foot or by horse, or mule and rude wagons. This shows how\r\nmuch the people of Britain desired music and beauty in their church\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VENERABLE BEDE\r\n\r\nAbout this time, there lived a man in England so loved and respected\r\nthat he was called the Venerable Bede. Although music had no such\r\nvariety, melody and richness as today, just see what the Venerable Bede\r\nsays about it: “Music is the most worthy, courteous, pleasant, joyous\r\nand lovely of all knowledge; it makes a man gentlemanly in his demeanor,\r\npleasant, courteous, joyous, lovely, for it acts upon his feelings.\r\nMusic encourages us to bear the heaviest afflictions, administers\r\nconsolation in every difficulty, refreshes the broken spirit, removes\r\nheadache and cures crossness and melancholy.”\r\n\r\nIsn’t it remarkable for a man to have said this so long ago, when\r\nscientists, today, have just _begun_ to think that music may have a\r\npower of healing ills of the mind and of the body! Truly—“there is\r\nnothing new under the sun!”\r\n\r\nSo Bede used the plain chant of Gregory and through his influence,\r\nspread this dignified music throughout England, and wherever a monastery\r\nwas founded, a music school was started.\r\n\r\nThe Venerable Bede writes that Ethelbert of Kent, King of Britain, was a\r\nworshipper of Odin and Thor, Norse gods, but he married a French\r\nPrincess who was a Christian. One day, writes the Venerable Bede, forty\r\nmonks led in solemn procession by St. Augustine, passed before the king\r\nsinging a chant. After hearing this marvelous hymn, he became a\r\nChristian and gave permission to the English to become worshippers of\r\nChrist instead of Norse and Druid gods. This hymn which converted\r\nEthelbert in 597 A.D. was sung thirteen hundred years later (1897) in\r\nthe same place, Canterbury, by another group of Benedictine monks!\r\n\r\nAt first the songs were sung unaccompanied, but later as in the time of\r\nDavid, the Church allowed instruments. The lyre and the harp were used\r\nfirst but the cymbals and the dulcimer, somewhat like our zither, were\r\nconsidered too noisy.\r\n\r\nThe Venerable Bede called music made by instruments _artificial_ music,\r\nand that of the human voice, _natural_ music. Whether at that time the\r\nviol, the drum, the organ or the psaltery (an instrument like the\r\ndulcimer) were used in the Church, is not known positively.\r\n\r\nAfter Bede’s death, Alcuin, a monk and musician, continued his work. He\r\nwas appointed by Charlemagne, Emperor of France, to teach music in the\r\nschools of Germany and France to spread the use of the Gregorian chant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A CURIOUS MUSIC SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn 900 A.D. an important thing happened, by which the reading and\r\nlearning of music was much simplified. A red line was drawn straight\r\nacross the page and this line represented “F” the tone on the fourth\r\nline of the bass staff. The _neumes_ written on this red line were “F”\r\nand the others above or below, were of higher or lower pitch. This\r\nworked so well, that they placed a yellow line above the red line and\r\nthis they called “C.” These two lines were the beginnings of our five\r\nline staff, but much happened between the two-line days and the five.\r\n\r\nAt this time people did not sing in parts, known as they are to\r\nus—soprano, alto, tenor, bass, but everybody sang the same tune, that\r\nis, sang in unison, and when men and women or men and boys sang\r\ntogether, the men’s voices sounded an octave lower than the women’s and\r\nthe boy’s. Some voices have naturally a high range and others low, and\r\nno doubt in these plain chant melodies the singers who could not reach\r\nall the tones comfortably, dropped unconsciously to a lower pitch, and\r\nin that way, made a second part. Soon the composers made this melody in\r\nthe medium range of the voice a part of their pieces instead of trusting\r\nthe singers to make it up as they went along. The principal tune sung or\r\ncarried by most of the singers was given the name _tenor_ (from the\r\nLatin _teneo_, to hold or carry). We use the same word to indicate the\r\nman’s voice of high range.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HUCBALD AND ORGANUM\r\n\r\nHucbald (840–930), a Flemish monk, first wrote a second part, always a\r\nfifth above or a fourth below the tenor or “subject.” (The Latin name\r\nfor the subject is _cantus firmus_—fixed song.) Hucbald probably used\r\nthe fifth and fourth because they were perfect intervals, and all others\r\nexcept the octave, were imperfect. There were often four parts including\r\nthe _cantus firmus_, for two parts were doubled. This succession of\r\nfourths and fifths sounds very crude and ugly (just try the example),\r\nbut these people of the Middle Ages must have liked it, for it lasted\r\nseveral centuries and was an attempt at making chords. This music was\r\ncalled _organum_ or _diaphony_ (dia-two, phony-sound: two sounds). As\r\nearly as 1100, singers tried out new effects with the added parts and\r\nintroduced a few imperfect intervals, thirds and sixths, and tried\r\nsinging occasionally in contrary motion to the subject,—this was called\r\n_discant_ from a Greek word meaning discord. Maybe at first it sounded\r\ndiscordant but soon it came to mean any part outside of the _cantus\r\nfirmus_ or subject. (See musical illustrations.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Organum (IXth and Xth Centuries)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diaphony]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Discant (XIIth Century)\r\n\r\n  Example of Organum, Diaphony, Discant\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere was also a kind of diaphony in which a third voice was written as\r\na bass, a fifth below the _cantus firmus_, but it was actually sung an\r\noctave higher than it was written and sounded much better that way. As\r\nit was not a bass at all it received the name of false bass or _faux\r\nbourdon_. This was the beginning of chords such as we use.\r\n\r\nSo, Hucbald started the science of harmony,—the study of chords. Hucbald\r\ncalled this _ars organum_—the art of organating or organizing.\r\n\r\nHucbald also invented a system of writing music on a staff. It was not a\r\nstaff such as we use today for he wrote in the spaces the initials T and\r\nS. T meant that the singer was to sing a whole tone, S, a semitone or\r\nhalf-step. He used a six line staff and wrote words in script instead of\r\nnotes like this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Staff]\r\n\r\n\r\n               GUIDO D’AREZZO AND HIS ADDITIONS TO MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe next great name in music history is Guido d’Arezzo, a Benedictine\r\nmonk (995–1050), famous for his valuable additions to music.\r\n\r\nHe invented the four-line staff, using both lines and spaces and giving\r\na definite place on the staff to each sound:\r\n\r\n                       Yellow line C————————————\r\n                       Black line  .............\r\n                       Red line    F————————————\r\n                       Black line  .............\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, the men did most of the singing so the music was\r\nwritten in a range to suit their voices. C is middle C, and F the bass\r\nclef.\r\n\r\nAll music had to be written by hand and the monks made wonderful\r\nparchment copies of works composed for the church services. They soon\r\ngrew careless about the yellow lines and red lines, so Guido placed the\r\nletters C and F at the beginning of the lines instead of using the\r\ncolored lines.\r\n\r\nSometimes there were three lines to a staff, sometimes four, five, and\r\neven eleven! The use of clefs showing which line was C or F, made\r\nreading of music much easier. At the end of the 16th century the\r\nquestion of the number of lines to the staff was definitely decided,\r\nthen they used four lines for the plain chant and five for all secular\r\nmusic. By calling the fifth line of the eleven, middle C, two staffs of\r\nfive lines resulted—the grand staff of today.\r\n\r\nHere is a table to show you how clefs grew:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (from Vincent d’Indy’s “Cours de Composition Musicale”)]\r\n\r\nHucbald built his scales in groups of four tones like the Greek\r\ntetrachords but Guido extended this tetrachord to a hexachord or\r\nsix-toned scale, and by overlapping the hexachords, he built a series of\r\nscales to which he gave the name, _gamut_, because it started on the G\r\nwhich is the first note of our grand staff (lowest line, bass clef) and\r\nthe Greek word for G is “Gamma.”\r\n\r\n                     F G ab͡♭ c d }\r\n                           ½ step }\r\n               C D EF͡ G a        }  This was repeated starting\r\n                    ½ step        }     an octave higher.\r\n         G A BC͡ D E              }\r\n              ½ step              }\r\n                         (Read from lowest line up.)\r\n\r\nIn the lowest hexachord, the B is natural, in the second hexachord there\r\nis no B and in the third hexachord, the B is flattened. Our sign (♭) for\r\nflat comes from the fact that this B was called a round B and the sign\r\n(♮) for natural was called a square B. The sharp (♯) came from the\r\nnatural and both meant at first raising the tone a half-step.\r\n\r\nGuido once heard the monks in the monastery of Arezzo singing a hymn in\r\nhonor of St. John the Baptist. He noticed that each line of the Latin\r\npoem began on ascending notes of the scale,—the first line on C, the\r\nsecond on D, and so on up to the sixth on A. It gave him the idea to\r\ncall each degree of the hexachord by the first syllable of the line of\r\nthe Latin hymn, thus:\r\n\r\n                           _Ut_queant laxis,\r\n                           _Re_sonare fibris,\r\n                           _Mi_ra gestorum,\r\n                           _Fam_uli tuorum,\r\n                           _Sol_ve polluti,\r\n                           _Lab_ia reatum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HYMN TO ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _UT que-ant la-xis RE-so ne-re fi-bris, MI ra ges-to-rum\r\nFA-mu-li tu o rum, SOL ve pol-lu ti LA bi a re a tumB͡C, Sancte\r\nIo-es-nes_]\r\n\r\nHere is a translation:\r\n\r\n              Grant that the unworthy lips of Thy servant\r\n              May be gifted with due harmony,\r\n              Let the tones of my voice\r\n              Sing the praises of Thy wonders.\r\n\r\nWe still call our scale degrees _ut_ (frequently changed to _do_), _re_,\r\n_mi_, _fa_, _sol_, _la_. The French today use these syllables instead of\r\nthe letters of the alphabet, and Guido is known as the man who\r\noriginated this solmization (the word taken from the syllables _sol_ and\r\n_mi_).\r\n\r\nWhere did the syllable _si_, the seventh degree of the scale, come from?\r\nThis hymn was written to St. John and in Latin his name is _Sancte\r\nIoannes_, the initials of which form the syllable _si_ which came into\r\nuse long after Guido’s time.\r\n\r\nThis system was very difficult for the singers to learn as it was quite\r\nnew to them, so Guido used his hand as a guide to the singers. Each\r\njoint represented a different syllable and tone, and a new scale began\r\non every fourth tone. Look at the Guidonian hand on the next page.\r\n\r\nGuido was so great a teacher and musician that he was given credit for\r\ninventing much that already existed. He gathered all the knowledge he\r\ncould find into a book, that was sent to the monasteries and music\r\nschools. He put in much that never before had been written down,\r\nexplained many things that had never been clear, and added much that was\r\nnew and useful.\r\n\r\nSometimes his name was written Gui or Guion. When he lived people had no\r\nlast names but were called by the name of their native towns; as Guido\r\nwas born in Arezzo, a town of Tuscany, he was called Guido d’Arezzo;\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, the great painter, was born in the village of Vinci;\r\nand the great Italian composer Pierluigi da Palestrina came from\r\nPalestrina.\r\n\r\nGuido’s work was considered revolutionary and not in accord with the old\r\nways which the church fathers reverenced. Because of plots against him,\r\nhe was cast into prison. But the Pope, realizing his greatness and\r\nvalue, saved him. The inventors of new ideas always suffer!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MENSURAL MUSIC OR TIMED MUSIC\r\n\r\nBefore Guido invented it, there had been no system of counting time.\r\n\r\nIf you are studying music, you know all about time signatures and what\r\nmetre a piece is in, from the ¾, ⁶⁄₈, ⁹⁄₈, ²⁄₄, ⁴⁄₄ or sign Ⅽ at the\r\nbeginning of the composition, but you probably do not know how or when\r\nthese signs came into use. In the Gregorian plain song and in Organum,\r\nthere was practically no variety of rhythm and no need for showing time\r\nor marking off the music into measures. The accents fell quite naturally\r\naccording to the words that were sung, much as you would recite poetry.\r\nBut as music grew up and became more difficult, it was necessary for a\r\nchorus singing in three or four different parts, to sing in time as well\r\nas in tune, in order, at least, to start and finish together!\r\n\r\nThe first metre that was used was triple (three beats to the measure).\r\nIt was called perfect and was indicated by a perfect circle, ○, the\r\nsymbol of the Holy Trinity and of perfection. Duple metre (two beats to\r\nthe measure) was imperfect and was indicated by an incomplete circle, Ϲ.\r\nOur sign for common time (four beats to the measure), Ϲ comes from this\r\nincomplete circle. ⁹⁄₈ was written ☉; ¾ was ○; ⁶⁄₈ was Ͼ; and ⁴⁄₄ was Ϲ.\r\n\r\nA monk named Franco, from Cologne, on the Rhine, early in the twelfth\r\ncentury, invented these time signatures, and notes which in themselves\r\nindicated different time values. Hucbald’s neumes were no longer suited\r\nto the new music, and besides time signatures it became necessary to\r\nhave a music language showing very clearly and definitely the composer’s\r\nrhythm.\r\n\r\n            FRANCO’S NOTATION                 OUR NOTATION\r\n\r\n             ▬         (maxima)      =      ⬭       (whole note)\r\n             ▜         (longa)       =      ᑯ       (half note)\r\n             ◼         (brevis)      =      ♩       (quarter note)\r\n             ◆         (semi-brevis) =      ♪       (eighth note)\r\n\r\nFranco used four kinds of notes. Here they are translated into the time\r\nvalues of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ORGANS\r\n\r\nIn the 10th century, organs came into use in the churches, but they were\r\nungainly and crude, sounding only a few tones, and were probably only\r\nused to keep the singers on pitch. The organ had been invented long\r\nbefore this, and had been used in Greece and Egypt. It was built on the\r\nprinciple of Pan’s Pipes and was very simple. There were many portable\r\norgans, called portatives, small enough to be carried about.\r\n\r\nOne organ (not a portative!) at Winchester, England, had four hundred\r\npipes and twenty-six pairs of bellows. It took seventy men to pump air\r\ninto it and two men to play it by pounding on a key with their fists or\r\nelbows. The tone was so loud that it could be heard all over the town.\r\nFancy that!\r\n\r\nDuring these centuries, music was growing slowly but surely. Out of\r\n_organum_ and _discant_ and _faux bourdon_, arose a style called\r\ncounterpoint, in which three, four or more melodies were sung at the\r\nsame time. The writing of _counterpoint_, or line over line, is like a\r\nbasket weave for the different melodies weave in and out like pieces of\r\nwillow or raffia forming the basket. Later will come the _chorale_,\r\nwritten in chords or up and down music like a colonnade or series of\r\ncolumns. Keep this picture in mind. (St. Nicolas Tune, Chapter XI.) The\r\nword _point_ means _note_ so _counterpoint_ means _note against note_.\r\nThe word was first applied in the 13th century to very crude and\r\ndiscordant part-writing. But, little by little the monks learned how to\r\ncombine melodies beautifully and harmoniously and we still use many of\r\ntheir rules.\r\n\r\nGradually great schools of church music flourished in France, Germany,\r\nSpain, England, Italy and the Netherlands in the 14th, 15th and 16th\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nBit by bit this vast musical structure was built. It did not grow\r\nquickly; each new idea took centuries to become a part of music, and as\r\noften the idea was not good, it took a long time to replace it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n     Troubadours and Minnesingers Brought Music to Kings and People\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for the first few chapters in this book, we have told you of\r\nmusic made by men who wanted to improve it. You have seen how the\r\nfathers of the Church first reformed music, and gave it a shorthand\r\ncalled neumes; before that, the music laws of the Egyptians, the scales\r\nand modes of the Arab, the Greek scales which the churchmen used in the\r\nAmbrosian and the Gregorian modes. Then came the two-lined staff, and\r\nthe beginnings of mensural or measured music by which they kept time.\r\nThen you saw how two melodies were fitted together and how they grew\r\ninto four parts. All this we might call “on purpose” music. At the same\r\ntime, in all the world, in every country, there was Song ... and never\r\nhave the world and the common people (called so because they are neither\r\nof the nobility nor of the church) been without folk song which has come\r\nfrom the folks of the world, the farmers, the weavers, and the laborers.\r\n\r\nThe best of these songs have what the great composers try to put into\r\ntheir music—a feeling of fresh free melody, design, balance, and climax,\r\nbut more of this in the chapter on Folk Song.\r\n\r\nThis chapter is to be about Troubadours, Trouvères, and Minnesingers,\r\nwho have left over two thousand songs. In most of these, they made up\r\nboth words and music, but sometimes they used new words made up for folk\r\ntunes that everyone knew, or for melodies from the plain-chants which\r\nthey had heard in church; sometimes they used the same melody for\r\nseveral different poems, and often they set the same words to several\r\nmelodies. Many of these troubadour songs and _minnelieder_ became the\r\npeople’s own folk songs.\r\n\r\nBut now you must hear of the folk who lived hundreds of years before\r\nthese poet singers. Unknowingly, out of the heart and soul and soil of\r\ntheir native lands, they made songs and sang poetry and played sometimes\r\nother peoples’ song, scattering their own wherever they went.\r\n\r\nFrom these traveling singers and players, in all countries, came the\r\nprofessional musicians who were minstrels, bards, troubadours, etc.,\r\naccording to when, where and how they lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE WHY OF THE MINSTREL\r\n\r\nThe people sang and played not only because they wanted to, or because\r\nthey loved it, but because they were the newspaper and the radio of\r\ntheir time, singing the news and doings of the day. These minstrels who\r\ntraveled from place to place “broadcasted” the events. No music was\r\nwritten down and no words were fastened by writing to any special piece.\r\nThe singer would learn a tune and when he sang a long story (an epic) he\r\nwould repeat the tune many times so it was necessary to find a pleasing\r\nmelody, or singers would not have been very welcome in the courts and\r\nmarket places. These musical news columns entertained the people who had\r\nfew amusements. The wandering minstrels with their harps or _crwth_\r\n(Welsh harps), or whatever instrument they might have used in their\r\nparticular country, were welcomed with open arms and hearts.\r\n\r\nThis sounds as if these singers and players traveled, and indeed they\r\ndid! They sprang up from all parts of Europe and had different names in\r\ndifferent places. There were bards from Britain and Ireland, skalds from\r\nthe Norse lands, minstrels from “Merrie England,” troubadours from the\r\nsouth of France, trouvères from the north of France, jongleurs from both\r\nnorth and south who danced and juggled for the joy of all who saw them,\r\nand minnesingers and meistersingers in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DRUIDS AND BARDS\r\n\r\nCenturies before this, Homer the great Greek poet was called the Blind\r\nBard and he chanted his poems, the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, to the\r\naccompaniment of the lyre, the favorite instrument of the Greeks. But\r\nwhen we speak of bards in this chapter we mean the poets and musicians\r\nof ancient Britain, when that island was inhabited and ruled by the\r\nDruids, 1000 B.C. We do not know when the bards first began to make\r\nmusic or when they were first called bards, but it is certain that for\r\nmany centuries before the Christian era, these rude, barbarous people of\r\nthe countries we know as Wales, England, Ireland and Scotland, had many\r\nsongs, dances and musical instruments.\r\n\r\nLook at a map of France, and see how much like a teapot it is shaped.\r\nThe western part, the spout, is Brittany! As its name shows, this part\r\nof France was inhabited by the same race of people as were in Britain,\r\nthey spoke the same language, had the same religion and made the same\r\nmusic. These people were Celts and their priests were called Druids.\r\nMuch we said about primitive people is true of these early Britons. They\r\nexpressed their feelings, and tried to protect themselves from Nature\r\nand human foes by means of religious rites and ceremonies in which music\r\nand dancing played the leading part.\r\n\r\nThey had no churches, but held religious services in the open under the\r\noak trees. They piled boulders on top of each other to form altars, or\r\nbuilt large circular enclosures of huge flat rocks, inside of which they\r\ngathered for worship, or to assist at some ceremonial in which\r\nsacrifices of animals and occasionally of human beings were made. These\r\nhuman sacrifices occurred once a year at the Spring Festival which was\r\ncelebrated in much the same fashion as in Greece. These masses of stone\r\nare found not only in the British Isles, the most famous of which is\r\nStonehenge (which was recently bought by an American), but there are\r\nalso many of these so-called _cromlechs_ and _menhirs_ in Brittany.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how often men and women do the same things at times and\r\nplaces so completely separated that they could not have been influenced\r\nby each other, but did what was natural for them. It seems that between\r\nthe state of being primitive or savage and of being cultured, mankind\r\nmust pass through certain states of mind and certain bodily actions\r\ncommon to all men. In tracing the growth of any habits and actions of\r\npeople,—in government, religion, amusements, art, music, manners and\r\ncustoms, and language, we find the same customs constantly repeated\r\namong different races. If you remember this point, you will be\r\ninterested to watch, in this book, the difference between these\r\nexperiences common to all mankind and those which later on, were caused\r\nby the influence that one race had on another through meeting, through\r\nconquest and through neighborly contact.\r\n\r\nThe bards belonged to the priesthood and were Druids. They sang in verse\r\nthe brave deeds of their countrymen, praises of the gods and heroes, and\r\nlegends of war and adventure, accompanying themselves on primitive\r\nharps, or on an instrument something like the violin without a neck,\r\ncalled a _crwth_. They wore long robes and when they were acting as\r\npriests, these were covered with white surplices somewhat like the gowns\r\nof our own clergy. From a bit of information handed down by the bards,\r\nwe learn that in Ireland, the graduate bard wore six colors in his\r\nrobes, said to be the origin of the plaid of the Scotch Highlanders; the\r\nking wore seven colors; lords and ladies, five; governors of fortresses,\r\nfour; officers and gentlemen, three; soldiers, two, and the people were\r\nallowed to wear only one. Even their dress seemed important and marked\r\nthe rank!\r\n\r\nThere were three kinds of bards: priestly bards who took part in the\r\nreligious rituals and were also the historians, domestic bards who made\r\nmusic in honor of their masters, and heraldic bards whose duties were to\r\narouse patriotism through songs in praise of their national heroes. They\r\nhad to pass examinations to become bards, and the lower ranks were\r\ntested for knowledge and ability before being promoted to the higher\r\nranks. Recently there has been a revival in Wales of the _Eisteddfod_,\r\nor song contests of the Druids.\r\n\r\n“Minstrelsy,” or singing to the _crwth_ or harp, lived on long after\r\nDruidism had been replaced by the Christian faith. Did you ever wonder\r\nwhere the custom came from of mistletoe at Christmas time? Or of dancing\r\naround a Maypole? Or building bonfires for May-day and St. John’s eve?\r\nCelebrating All-Hallowe’en with pumpkins and black cats? And of having\r\nChristmas trees? Well, these customs are all relics of Druidism of 2000\r\nor more years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SKALDS\r\n\r\nIn the land of the fierce Vikings or Norsemen, who inhabited\r\nScandinavia, Iceland and Finland before and during the Middle Ages,\r\nthere were bards called Skalds or Sagamen. They recited and sang stories\r\ntelling of their Norse gods, goddesses and heroes, Woden, Thor, Odin,\r\nFreya, Brynnhild, and of the abode of the gods, Walhalla. These ballads\r\nformed the national epics called _sagas_ and _eddas_, from which Richard\r\nWagner drew the story for his immortal music dramas, the Nibelungenlied.\r\n\r\nOdin, who was considered a Norse god, probably was a Saxon prince who\r\nlived in the 3rd century, A.D. He revived the Norse mythology and rites\r\nwith the aid of minstrels, seers, and priests. His teachings lasted\r\nuntil the reign of Charlemagne, a devout Christian, who put an end to\r\npagan rites.\r\n\r\nIn the 5th century came the Saxons, Hengist and Horsa, descendants of\r\nOdin, and much of Britain fell under their rule; with them, came the\r\nskalds whose duty it was to celebrate the deeds of their lords. They\r\nappeared at the great state banquets, and also on the battle fields,\r\nencouraging the warriors with their songs of heroism, and comforting the\r\nwounded soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Danes, the Angles and the Jutes came to Britain in this same\r\ncentury, the country was called England or Angle-land. Harpers and\r\ngleemen followed in the footsteps of the Scandinavian skalds. These\r\nmusician-singers went as honored guests from court to court, and\r\nreceived valuable presents. A popular gleeman was given the title of\r\npoet-laureate, and crowned with a laurel wreath.\r\n\r\nThe songs were taught orally and learned by heart, as there was no\r\nnotation at this early date (500 A.D.). They accompanied themselves on\r\nsmall harps which could be carried easily. The harp was handed around\r\nthe banquet table so that each guest in turn might sing a song as his\r\nshare of the entertainment. Singing and composing poetry were a\r\nnecessary part of a gentleman’s education.\r\n\r\nThe “Venerable” Bede (Chapter VII) wrote that “Cædmon the poet (600\r\nA.D.) never could compose any trivial or vain songs, but only such as\r\nbelonged to a serious and sacred vein of thought ... he was not\r\npractised in the art of verse. So, oft, in an entertainment, where for\r\nthe sake of merriment it had been agreed that each in turn should sing\r\nand harp, as the dreaded instrument was seen approaching, he arose in\r\nshame from the supper table and went home to his house.” However, we\r\nlearn that Cædmon who was a serving man, had a vision in which an angel\r\nasked him to “sing the beginning of creatures,” and when the vision had\r\npassed, he remembered the heavenly song, and thus Cædmon ceased to be\r\nshy, became the first great poet of England and was permitted to be a\r\nmonk.\r\n\r\nAs the gleemen and harpers were not fighting men, they had many\r\nprivileges not granted to the warriors. They passed, unchallenged,\r\nthrough the fighting camps, and we have any number of stories of kings\r\nand warriors disguising themselves as harpers in order to get\r\ninformation about their enemies. A secret service system of the Middle\r\nAges!\r\n\r\nIn 878, Alfred the Great had been robbed of power and authority by the\r\nDanes, so disguised as a gleeman and armed only with a harp, he went\r\ninto the Danish encampment. The royal minstrel was received cordially,\r\nand while the Danish king was listening to the songs, the harper\r\n(Alfred) was getting the information he needed, and soon made a surprise\r\nattack with his troops and was victorious. This is spying with musical\r\naccompaniment!\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Hastings (1066) caused great changes not only in learning,\r\ncustoms, language, music, other arts and politics, but in life itself.\r\nThe French who, under William of Normandy conquered Britain, were\r\nleaders in composing poetry and song, and they brought over to Britain\r\nall their talents. Now romance began and with it the art of glorifying\r\nin song and verse, deeds of valor and the charms of lovely ladies. And\r\nhere the troubadours and trouvères make their entrance into our story.\r\n\r\nFrance had had songs of deeds and action called _Chansons de Geste_,\r\nwhich were tales of the brave Charlemagne, celebrating his victory over\r\nthe invading Moors from Spain. One of the greatest of these was the\r\n_Chanson de Roland_. Other songs or ballads on religious, historical,\r\nchivalric, or political subjects took the place of our modern newspapers\r\nand were powerful at the courts and among the people in the towns. When\r\na man in court circles did anything that some one objected to, one of\r\nthe minstrel-poets was hired to make up a song about it, which was sung\r\neverywhere until the news was well circulated, and the person punished,\r\noften undeservedly. However it made the men of those days think twice\r\nbefore doing things against the rights of others, for they were really\r\nafraid of these songs that were spread among their friends and enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the Battle of Hastings, Taillefer, a famous soldier-minstrel, led the\r\nattack of the Normans, singing songs of Roland and of Charlemagne. He\r\nstruck the first blow in the fight, and was the first one killed, but he\r\nwent to his death singing. Tales of our own soldiers in the great war\r\ntell us the same about the need and love of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHANSON DE ROLAND\r\n\r\nThe _Chanson de Roland_ is the national epic poem of France, and dates\r\nback to this Norman period. It celebrates the death at Roncevals, of\r\nRoland, Count of the “Marsh” of Bretagne, in Charlemagne’s expedition\r\nagainst Spain in 778. The work is divided into three parts. The first\r\ntells of the fight between the French (Christians) and the Saracens\r\n(Spanish Arabs), of the valor of Oliver and of Roland, of the latter’s\r\ndeath, of Charlemagne’s miraculous victory over the Saracens. The second\r\npart is a poem not based on fact, in which Charlemagne fights Baligant,\r\nthe chief of all the pagans of the Orient; the western chief is\r\nvictorious over the pagan chief, who is utterly defeated and killed.\r\nThis poem pictures the victory of Christianity over Paganism. In the\r\nthird part, the revenge is carried further, by Charlemagne’s taking the\r\nSaracen city Saragosse, and bringing back with him to France another of\r\nthe leaders, Ganelon, who was tried and condemned to death.\r\n\r\nThis is the leading French work of the Middle Ages, as it sums up the\r\ngreatest idealism, and brings to us that which they considered most\r\nvital—the call of patriotism, of honor and of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GREAT CATHEDRALS AND FEUDAL CASTLES\r\n\r\nAbout this time began the building of the great Gothic churches in\r\nFrance, England, and Germany. Rome had fallen, paganism had gone, and\r\nthe spirit of Christianity was taking great hold of the people’s hearts.\r\nAs a result of this feeling to praise God suitably the great churches\r\nwhich we copy even today were built.\r\n\r\nIf “architecture is frozen music,” you can understand why music and\r\narchitecture developed at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis was also the age of Feudalism, when the noblemen lived in castles\r\nwith moats and drawbridges, and owned vast tracts of land and whole\r\nvillages. People were retainers, vassals and serfs, with no freedom and\r\nno property rights except what the lords gave them. They even had to\r\ngive their masters much of the produce of the lands which they\r\ncultivated. Of course, these feudal lords besides having to be fed and\r\nguarded had to be entertained, and had to know what was going on in the\r\noutside world. So, the minstrels and bards were cordially welcomed, and\r\nwandered from castle to castle, receiving presents of money or clothes,\r\njewelry, horses, and sometimes even houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n               WHAT TROUBADOURS LEARNED THROUGH CRUSADES\r\n\r\nEvery year during the early centuries of the Christian era, hundreds of\r\npilgrims journeyed to the Holy Land undergoing much hardship on the way.\r\nThey thought through this pilgrimage to be forgiven for their sins, and\r\nwin the approval of the Church, then far more powerful than the kings.\r\nToward the end of the 11th century, Mohammedans had seized Palestine,\r\nand prevented the Christian pilgrims from doing penance or worshipping\r\nat the Holy Sepulchre. This led to a series of expeditions against the\r\nMohammedans in Palestine in which all the Christian countries of Europe\r\nunited. These expeditions were called the Crusades (1095–1271), and they\r\nhave been celebrated in story and song ever since. The Crusades gave the\r\nrough uncultured men of the Western world the chance to hear the poetry\r\nand the songs of the Arabs (Chapter VI), who at that time were the most\r\nadvanced in culture and arts. Although the Oriental music with its\r\ncomplicated rhythms must have been hard to learn, the Crusaders brought\r\nback much of real value and beauty,—a new way of singing, new subjects\r\nfor poems, and two new instruments, a kind of guitar and _el oud_, in\r\nEurope called lute. The lute had a strong influence on popular music,\r\nfor it was the most commonly used instrument for centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ROMANCE LANGUAGES\r\n\r\nLatin had been the language of France because the Romans lived there so\r\nlong, but later it became mixed with the rough dialect and speech of the\r\nFranks and other Gothic barbarous tribes and was much changed. From this\r\nmixture came rustic Latin, or _Romanse rustique_, and modern French,\r\nSpanish, Italian and Portuguese are still called Romance languages. A\r\nnew poetry was born in Provence, the south of France, and in Normandy in\r\nthe north, written in this _Romanse rustique_, and the oldest French\r\nsongs were called _lais_, lay or ballad. The great ruler Charlemagne\r\ncollected these _lais_ of barbarian period and the trouvères and\r\ntroubadours had wonderful old songs of heroism to choose from.\r\n\r\nIn Provence they said “oc” for “yes” and in Normandy, “oui.” So, the\r\nlanguage of the south of France was called “langue d’oc” and of the\r\nnorth “langue d’oui.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TROUBADOURS, TROUVÈRES, JONGLEURS\r\n\r\nThe troubadours, whose very name brings to mind a charming picture of\r\nromance, chivalry and adventure, were the poet-composers of Provence a\r\nland of sunshine where men were brave and courteous, and women beautiful\r\nand gracious. The words _troubadour_ and _trouvères_, come from\r\n_trobar_, _trouver_, meaning to find or to invent, for these troubadours\r\nand trouvères were the inventors or composers of poems which they set to\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nThey wrote their songs on the four-lined staff in square notes, without\r\nwritten accompaniment. The accompaniments played on the lute, the\r\nguitar, the vielle, or sometimes the harp, were probably made up by the\r\n_jongleur_, (_joglar_, _jouglar_, in English,—juggler) who sang the\r\nsongs, had trained bears, danced and played tricks. Then as now there\r\nwere composers and performers. The troubadours and trouvères were as a\r\nrule, nobles and even royalty. Five kings belonged to their number, the\r\ngreatest of them were Richard Cœur de Lion, William Count of Poitiers,\r\nAlfonso, Thibaut de Champagne, and King of Navarre.\r\n\r\nThe troubadour seldom sang his own songs, as this was the jongleur’s\r\nduty. There were many more jongleurs than troubadours, and they belonged\r\nto a much lower grade of society. The jongleurs traveled from place to\r\nplace, from castle to castle, with their instruments slung across their\r\nbacks, and their songs in a little bag at their side. They were heartily\r\nwelcomed wherever they went, but if they found the doors of the castles\r\nclosed to them, they soon gathered a crowd in the public squares, where\r\nthey performed to the joy of the townspeople.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine the pleasure these strolling entertainers gave to the\r\npeople who did not have motors, movies, radios, gramophones and theatres\r\nfor their amusement? How happy the custodian of the castle must have\r\nbeen when he looked across the moat and lowered the drawbridge for the\r\nwelcome minstrels!\r\n\r\nThe jongleurs grew so numerous, and their music became so poor that they\r\nwere nuisances, little better than outlaws and beggars. How easily a\r\ngood thing can be overdone!\r\n\r\nIn the 14th century they banded together in perhaps the first musical\r\nunion on record. They appointed leaders, called kings of the minstrels\r\nor jugglers. At first they were hired by nobles and troubadours as\r\nentertainers with the rank of servants. Even the monasteries received\r\nthem with joy during the early days; later they were denounced by the\r\nChurch, and forbidden to enter the monasteries, for they had sung of\r\nevil things instead of lovely things and had acted unseemly. During\r\nLent, they were forbidden to appear in public, so they wisely used that\r\ntime to go to schools of minstrelsy, where they learned new songs, and\r\ntried their skill at composing. In these schools they were also taught\r\nto play their instruments. Sometimes we hear of women minstrels, who\r\nsang, played the flute, danced, and performed tricks to the endless\r\ndelight of the audience. (See lining of the cover of this book.)\r\n\r\nThe jongleurs, at their best, seem to have “gotten in” everywhere,—at\r\nthe courts of kings, in all the tournaments, festivals, pilgrimages, and\r\nweddings. A wedding wasn’t complete without them! At the knightly\r\ntournaments and jousts, the minstrel was a most necessary person, for,\r\ndid he not take the place of newspapers, and give accounts to a waiting\r\nworld of the results of the exciting tournaments?\r\n\r\nMassenet, the French composer, wrote a lovely opera called _The Juggler\r\nof Notre Dame_, from one of the old miracle tales of a young juggler\r\nsheltered by the monks of Notre Dame. Everyone brought rich gifts to\r\nplace at the feet of the Virgin Mary, but being a pauper, he had nothing\r\nbut his songs, dances and tricks, which he offered the Virgin by going\r\nthrough them as best he could in front of the shrine. So shocked were\r\nthe monks by his seeming lack of respect, that they wanted to drive him\r\nout! At this moment the miracle took place. The image of the Virgin came\r\nto life and stretched forth her arms protectingly to the young juggler,\r\nshowing that she accepted his offering given in all sincerity and\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nAs all the countries of Europe took part in the Crusades, the\r\ntroubadours’ songs were heard by others than the French, and their music\r\nspread rapidly. Richard, the Lion-Hearted, King of England, was a famous\r\nCrusader and a troubadour of skill. He invited jongleurs over from\r\nFrance, one of whom, Blondel de Nesle, became his devoted companion\r\nduring the Crusade of 1193, and saved Richard’s life. Richard was taken\r\ncaptive by Leopold, Duke of Austria, and was cast into a dungeon. The\r\nEnglish did not know where to look for their monarch, but Blondel\r\nundertook the search, going from place to place, singing songs which he\r\nand the king had written together. One day as he sang, from the tower of\r\na castle came a voice which he recognized as Richard’s, singing the same\r\nsong! And soon the royal troubadour was released.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TROUBADOURS\r\n\r\nThis new art of poetry and song was called “The gay science of chivalry\r\nand love-service.” Indeed many of the poems about knightly adventure\r\nwere addressed to some fair lady, real or imaginary, known or unknown.\r\nCurious as it may seem, the names of most of these songs came from the\r\nArabian, because the Europeans met them during the crusades and during\r\nthe Arabs’ conquests and roamings in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe names tell you what the songs were about. _Chanson_ and _canzo_ both\r\nmean song, and we see these names today on our concert programs. There\r\nwere story telling songs called the _chansons de toile_, songs of linen,\r\nwhich told of the lovely damsels at work weaving, of their beauty, and\r\nof their thoughts, for the women of castle and cottage alike wove the\r\ncloth out of which the clothes were made. Then, they had dramatic songs\r\nand dancing songs called _estampies_ (from which comes our word\r\nstamping); the _reverdies_, or spring songs, to celebrate the Spring\r\nfestivals; the _pastorelles_ in which the heroine was always a charming\r\nshepherdess; the _sera_ or _serenade_, an evening song; the _nocturne_,\r\na night song, and love songs were often sung under the beloved ladies’\r\nwindows! The _alba_ was a morning song. The _sirvantes_, or songs of\r\nservice, sung in praise of princes or nobles, or telling of public\r\nhappenings were important. These were often accompanied by drums, bells,\r\npipes and trumpets.\r\n\r\nWe have debating societies in our schools and colleges, and questions of\r\nthe day are discussed in the newspapers, but in the troubadours’ day,\r\ndebates were made into songs, sung by two people, and were called\r\n_tensons_. Many curious and rather foolish questions were made the\r\nsubjects of these songs.\r\n\r\nSometimes these popular songs found their way into the Church, and were\r\nmade into fine church music, and sometimes a bit of melody from the\r\nChurch went through the hands of a troubadour poet and was turned into a\r\n_rounde_, _ballata_, _sera_, or _pastorella_.\r\n\r\nThis poetry and song of Provence lasted until the middle of the 14th\r\ncentury, for in the twelve hundreds the revolts against the abuses of\r\nthe Church rose to such seriousness that massacres took place, towns\r\nwere destroyed and many nobles and troubadours lost their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TROUVÈRES\r\n\r\nShortly after the troubadours began to compose, in the north of France\r\ncame the trouvères who profited much from the music and poetry of their\r\nsouthern brothers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the trouvères did not have the warm, lovely dialect of the\r\nsouthern troubadours. As they were closer to the Church, their songs\r\nwere more religious, had less variety of subjects, and the melodies were\r\nlike Church music.\r\n\r\nAlthough the troubadours did much to shape the rhyming stanzas in\r\npoetry, the trouvères helped in the gradual forming of the later French\r\nand Flemish schools of music, as you will see.\r\n\r\nThe jongleurs played on an instrument called the _vielee_ which was\r\ngreat-grandfather to our violin. The short pieces played before the\r\nsongs and accompanied by dances, were the first pieces of instrumental\r\nmusic in the Middle Ages. The combination of song, instrument and dance\r\nwas called _balerie_ or _ballada_ from which comes our dance _ballet_.\r\nThere was also a piece called _rounde_, _rota_, or _rondo_, composed so\r\nthat different voices and the instrument came in at different points,\r\neach singing or playing the same tune, but arranged so that the parts\r\nsounded well together. Perhaps you know _Frère Jacques_ or _Scotland’s\r\nBurning_ or _Three Blind Mice_. These are rounds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful rounds in existence is an English song which\r\ndates from 1250, the period of all this “gay science,” and it is looked\r\nupon as a masterpiece. It is supposed to have been written either by\r\nJohn Forsete, a monk, or by Walter Odington. It was written in the old\r\nsquare neumes on a six line staff. The name of this “Six Men’s Song” or\r\nround for six voices, is _Summer is icumen In_.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known trouvères was Adam de la Hale who wrote _Robin et\r\nMarion_, said to be the very first comic opera. It was performed at the\r\ncourt of Naples in 1285.\r\n\r\nThe trouvères collected tales of Normandy, Brittany, and of\r\nCharlemagne’s reign, and so preserved valuable musical and literary\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nSo these troubadours and trouvères made the age of Chivalry romantic and\r\nbeautiful to us who came long after them, in spite of much\r\nunpleasantness, prejudice, war, massacre and hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MINNESINGERS\r\n\r\nAlong the river Rhine in Germany near that part of France where the\r\ntrouvères sang, lived the Minnesingers. They sang love songs,—_minne_\r\nwas the old German word for love. Like the troubadours the minnesingers\r\nwere of the nobility, but they rarely hired jongleurs or anybody to\r\nperform their songs; they sang them themselves, playing their own\r\naccompaniments on lutes or viels (viols).\r\n\r\nMany songs expressed adoration of the Virgin, and others praised deeds\r\nof chivalry. Differing from other minstrels, they made songs about\r\nNature and Religion full of feeling, fancy and humor, but the minnesongs\r\nwere not so light-hearted or fanciful as those of their French\r\nneighbors. They had marked rhythm, beauty of form and simplicity, and\r\nwere more dramatic, telling the exploits of the Norse heroes in many a\r\nglorious story.\r\n\r\nTheir story was far more important to them than the music which for a\r\nlong time was like the stern plain song of the Church. “We should be\r\nglad they were what they were, for they seem to have paved the way for\r\nthe great Protestant music of the 16th century,” says Waldo Selden Pratt\r\nin his _History of Music_.\r\n\r\nYou can get an excellent idea of the minnesong in Wolfram von\r\nEschenbach’s _Oh Thou Sublime Sweet Evening Star_, which Wagner wrote in\r\nthe spirit of the ancient minnesingers in the opera _Tannhäuser_.\r\nTannhäuser was a real minnesinger, taking part in a real song contest,\r\nheld by the Landgraf (Count) of Thuringia, 1206–7, who offered his\r\ndaughter Elizabeth’s hand to the winner, whatever his rank. We find\r\nElizabeth also in Wagner’s _Tannhäuser_, so when you hear it you will\r\nknow that it is history as well as beautiful music! How remarkable that,\r\nin the days of feudalism, when the nobles practically owned the\r\nso-called common people, talent for music and verse stood even above\r\nrank! After all there is no nobility like that of talent. Even in the\r\n13th century this was understood, and to either commoner or peer winning\r\nthe song tournament, the lady of rank was given in marriage.\r\n\r\nWolfram von Eschenbach, the minnesinger, visited the courts and sang in\r\nmany tournaments. Giving Wagner a character for the opera _Tannhäuser_\r\nwas not all he did as Eschenbach wrote a poem from which Wagner drew the\r\nstory for his _Parsifal_.\r\n\r\nWalther von der Vogelweide, one of the most famous minnesingers, was so\r\nfond of birds, that when dying he asked for food and drink to be placed\r\non his tomb every day for the birds. There are four holes carved in the\r\ntombstone; and pilgrims today, when they visit this singer’s grave,\r\nstill scatter crumbs for them, who probably in their bird histories\r\nrecord that Walther loved song even as they!\r\n\r\nPrince Conrad, Konradin he was called, son of the last Swabian King, was\r\nthe last famous minnesinger. Everyone battled for other people’s\r\ncountries and lands then, and so Conrad, heir to the crown, joined a\r\nSicilian rebellion against France, and was killed by a troubadour, the\r\nDuke of Anjou.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MASTERSINGERS\r\n\r\nAfter poor Conrad’s time, the art of minnesinging declined, but as\r\npeople must have music, a new activity sprang up among the people or\r\n“folk” instead of among the gentry and knights. The folk who took part\r\nin this were called the Meistersingers or mastersingers and their story\r\nis very thrilling and picturesque.\r\n\r\nThis was the day of the Robber Baron, when Germany was broken up into\r\nlittle kingdoms and principalities. Any rich and powerful noble could\r\nstart a war to steal away the rights of another ruler, and become ruler\r\nhimself. This was no pleasant state of affairs for the people, for they\r\nwere in constant terror of death, of the destruction of their crops, or\r\nnew taxes. Life became so perilous that people left the farms and went\r\nto the cities for protection. The feudal system began to fail, for the\r\npeople would no longer be slaves, and gradually took up trades and\r\nformed themselves into guilds. The warring nobles had neglected music\r\nfor conquest, so these workers and artisans, hungry for it, formed music\r\nguilds as well as trade guilds, drew up rules for making music and\r\npoetry, and held prize competitions. In these music guilds there were\r\nsix grades of membership: first, member; second, scholar or apprentice;\r\nthen, friends of the school; singer, poet, and finally mastersinger or\r\n_Meistersinger_. You can get a real picture of their day in the greatest\r\ncomic opera ever written, Wagner’s _Die Meistersinger_, and you can make\r\nthe acquaintance of Hans Sachs, the most famous Meistersinger\r\n(1494–1576).\r\n\r\nHeinrich von Meissen, known as _Frauenlob_ (Praise of Women), is said to\r\nhave founded the Meistersinger movement over a hundred years before Hans\r\nSachs’ time.\r\n\r\nTil Eulenspiegel, whose merry pranks have been delightfully told in\r\nmusic by Richard Strauss, a present day composer, was also a\r\nMeistersinger.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name “Meistersinger” is disputed. One historian tells\r\nus that it was given to every minnesinger who was not a noble,—in other\r\nwords, a burgher-minstrel. The other historian claims that the title\r\n_Meister_ or master was given to any one who excelled in any act or\r\ntrade, and afterwards came to mean all the guild members.\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th century to the 16th, hardly a town in Germany was without\r\nmusic guilds and Meistersingers. Although they lost power then, the last\r\nguilds did not disappear until 1830, and the last member died in 1876.\r\nThey must have passed the long winter evenings pleasantly for they met,\r\nand read or sang poems of the minnesingers or new ones composed by the\r\nmembers themselves. These guilds must have been great fun, for they had\r\nbadges and initiation ceremonies and the kind of celebrations one loves\r\nin a club.\r\n\r\nThey had complicated, narrow-minded rules called _Tablatur_ which today\r\nseem quite ridiculous, so much has music matured and thrown off the\r\nchains which once bound it!\r\n\r\nWhen the guilds grew too large to be held in the different homes, the\r\nchurches became the meeting places for practise and for the contests.\r\n\r\nThe highest praise we can give the Meistersingers is that they carried\r\nthe love of music and song into every German home and made it a pastime\r\nof domestic life. Their influence spread not only through Germany, but\r\nthroughout all lands. The composers who followed were glad to have their\r\nsongs from which to draw inspiration for the popular religious songs at\r\nthe time of the Protestant Reformation. Even though they did not make up\r\nany very great words or music, they spread a love for it and made people\r\nfeel that the following of music as a career was worthy and dignified.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know before we close this chapter, that the\r\nEnglish, well into the 16th century, after the passing of the\r\ntroubadours, trouvères, minnesingers and mastersingers, still celebrated\r\nthe exploits of the day in ballads called the Percy Reliques.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VIELLE OR HURDY-GURDY\r\n\r\nIf you had lived in the Middle Ages you would have seen the strolling\r\nplayers traveling around with a queer looking instrument known by many\r\ndifferent names,—_vielle_, _organistrum_, _Bauernleier_ (peasant lyre),\r\n_Bettlerleier_ (beggar’s lyre) or _hurdy-gurdy_. This was a country\r\ninstrument, not often seen in cities, and was shaped like the body of a\r\nlute without a long neck. It had wire strings, sometimes gut, and a set\r\nof keys; the sound was made by turning a little crank at the bottom. The\r\n_vielle_ or _hurdy-gurdy_ is a cross between the bowed and the keyed\r\ninstruments. In the 12th century it was called the _organistrum_, a\r\nlarge instrument which took two men to play. It flourished in the 18th\r\ncentury throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd so, now on to folk songs, although we would like to linger in this\r\nromantic period of wandering minstrels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                       The People Dance and Sing\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOLK MUSIC\r\n                   ALL THE WORLD HAS DANCED AND SUNG\r\n\r\nWe have watched the human race grow out of its state of primitive yells\r\nand grunts, or babyhood, telling its stories and expressing its feelings\r\nin crude music. We have seen it sing and dance its way through the ages\r\nduring which its men were semi-barbarians, like the Franks, Gauls,\r\nGoths, Huns, Saxons, Celts, and Angles into the period when these same\r\ntribes became the French, German, Belgian and English nations.\r\n\r\nMusic was not a thing of learning as it is today, it was merely a way of\r\ntalking, of enjoying life, and of passing on to others deeds and doings\r\nof the time. Early people said in poetry and song what was in their\r\nhearts. They knew nothing of musical rules and regulations and passed\r\ntheir songs along from father to son through the long years when the\r\nworld was young, and their best songs have in them the seed of musical\r\nart! A modern Greek folk singer said: “As I don’t know how to read, I\r\nhave made this story into a song, so as not to forget it.”\r\n\r\nThis music of the people, by the people and for the people is Folk Music\r\nand we shall see how these simple, tuneful bits have influenced the\r\nworld of music because, as H. E. Krehbiel said, “they are the heartbeats\r\nof the ... folk and in them are preserved feelings, beliefs and habits\r\nof vast antiquity.” Don’t you believe that studying history through folk\r\ntunes would be fascinating? People today have found out much about the\r\ndifferent races and tribal events through them.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to find out who wrote the five thousand folk songs of\r\nEngland and the more than five thousand of Russia and of Ireland and all\r\nthe others, for it was not until the 19th century that folk songs and\r\ndances became a serious study. The fact is, that a true folk song\r\ndoesn’t want to find its composer for it loses its rank as a folk song\r\nif its maker should turn up! Isn’t that curious? But it is not quite\r\nfair, for surely we should accept as folk songs those which have sprung\r\nup among them, or have become a part of their lives through expressing\r\ntheir thoughts and feelings, even though the composer’s name has not\r\nbeen lost. We divide folk songs into two classes,—Class A, the\r\ncomposerless songs, and Class B, those tagged with a name.\r\n\r\nIsn’t it exciting to think that folk songs and dances of the ancient\r\nGreeks, the Aztecs of Peru, the Chinese, the Irish and Russian peasants\r\nand our American negroes have things in common? It seems as if they\r\nmight have had a world congress in primitive times and agreed on certain\r\nkinds of songs, for every nation has\r\n\r\n  1. Songs of childhood, games, and cradle songs.\r\n\r\n  2. Songs for religious ceremonies, festivals, holidays, and Christmas\r\n       Carols.\r\n\r\n  3. Love songs and songs for marriage fêtes, and weddings.\r\n\r\n  4. War songs, patriotic songs and army songs.\r\n\r\n  5. Songs of work and labor and trades.\r\n\r\n  6. Drinking songs, comical, political and satirical.\r\n\r\n  7. Songs for dancing, rounds, etc.\r\n\r\n  8. Funeral songs and songs for mourning.\r\n\r\n  9. Narratives, ballads and legends.\r\n\r\nSo it comes to pass, that many a time when nations, due to wars and\r\nwanderings and vast passings of time, have forgotten their origins, the\r\nsinging of a song will bring back the fact of some far distant\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nOne day a party of Bretons, in 1758 (long after the Welsh and Bretons\r\nhad forgotten they were of the same race), were marching to give battle\r\nto some Welsh troops that had descended upon the French coast. As the\r\nWelsh soldiers marched forward, the Bretons were amazed to hear their\r\nenemies singing one of their own national songs! They were so surprised\r\nand so overcome with sympathy that the Bretons joined in and sang with\r\nthe Welsh. Both commanders, speaking the same language, gave the order\r\n“Fire!” But neither side would or could fire. Instead, the soldiers\r\ndropped their weapons, broke ranks and in wild enthusiasm greeted each\r\nother as long lost friends. The song they sang is probably seven hundred\r\nyears old or older.\r\n\r\n\r\n             (1) SONGS OF CHILDHOOD, GAMES AND CRADLE SONGS\r\n\r\nFrom the day of the obelisk to the day of the radio, every baby that has\r\never been born has been put to sleep to the soothing sound of the\r\nmother’s song. The Greek mother sang to her baby,\r\n\r\n Come, Sleep! come, Sleep! Take him away.\r\n Come, Sleep, and make him slumber.\r\n Carry him to the vineyard of the Aga,\r\n To the Garden of the Aga,\r\n The Aga will give him grapes; his wife, roses; his servant, pancakes.\r\n\r\nMany early lullabies were sung in honor of the infant Jesus, which\r\nreally gives them a very blesséd beginning. It is related by a Sicilian\r\npoet “When the Madunazza (mother) was mending St. Joseph’s clothes, the\r\nBambineddu (Bambino—the Infant Jesus) cried in his cradle, because no\r\none was attending to Him. So the Archangel Raphael came and rocked Him\r\nand said these sweet little words to Him, ‘Lullaby, Jesus, Son of\r\nMary.’”\r\n\r\nThe Indians, too, sang lullabies, for you know the squaw is a gentle\r\nsoul and takes beautiful care of her papoose. The Chippewas think of\r\nsleep as a big insect and they have named him Weeng. Weeng comes down\r\nfrom the top of a tree where he is busy making a buzzing noise with his\r\nwings and puts you to sleep by sending many little fairies to you who\r\nbeat your head with tiny clubs!\r\n\r\nWe all know our own _Bye, Baby Bunting_, _Father’s Gone a Hunting_,\r\netc., and _Rockabye Baby on the Tree Top_.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, whose children songs and lullabies are so lovely, have the\r\nfamiliar _Schlaf, Kindlein, Schlaf!_ It is a sweet name the Italians\r\ngive their lullaby, the _ninne-nanne_! And the mothers in Lyons, France,\r\ncall sleep _souin-souin_ and have a charming little song:\r\n\r\n                   Le Poupon voudrait bien do(r)mir;\r\n                   Le souin-souin ne peu pas venir.\r\n                   Souin-souin, vené, vené, vené;\r\n                   Souin-souin, vené, vené, vené!\r\n\r\n                   The infant wants to go to sleep;\r\n                   Sleep does not wish to come.\r\n                   Sleep come, come, come;\r\n                   Sleep come, come, come!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GAMES\r\n\r\nWe all have sung _The Farmer in the Dell_, _London Bridge is Falling\r\nDown_, _Ring Around the Rosy_ and many other game-songs. We have told\r\nyou of the Indian moccasin game, and we know that in all the other\r\nnations the children have had their game-songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (2) SONGS FOR RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES, HOLIDAYS, AND CHRISTMAS CAROLS,\r\n                  ETC., MAY SONGS AND SPRING FESTIVALS\r\n\r\nSpring is so full of the beginnings of life, and people can see the\r\nflowers begin to bloom and take on color and glory. Even as you and I,\r\nthey have never been able to see them without rejoicing and every one’s\r\nrejoicing sooner or later is a cause for music. In many countries this\r\nrenewal of life is celebrated by rites and ceremonies that have been the\r\nsource of much folk-lore and music.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, as early as the 6th Century B.C., celebrated the coming of\r\nthe spring with a religious festival named after the god Dionysus. Many\r\nsongs and dances accompanied these festivals. On the evening before the\r\nfestival, which lasted five days, there was an impressive procession by\r\ntorch-light in which an image of the god Dionysus was carried to the\r\ntheatre where the festival was held, accompanied by many handsome youths\r\nand a very splendid bull which was sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIn the excavations of Crete this ancient hymn has been found,—a spring\r\nsong and a young man-song in one:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ho! Kouros (young man), most Great, I give thee hail, Lord of all that\r\n  is wet and gleaming; thou art come at the head of thy Daemones. To\r\n  Dickte for the year, Oh, march and rejoice in the dance and song.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Germany, it was thought that on Walpurgis-nacht (May night) witches\r\nrode on the tails of magpies and danced away the winter snows on the\r\nBrocken, one of the highest peaks of the Hartz Mountains. In Germany\r\ntoo, it was the custom for children to set May-flies (Maikäfer) free and\r\nto sing this song:\r\n\r\n                     Maikäferchen fliege,\r\n                     Dein Vater ist in Kriege\r\n                     Dein Mutter ist in Pommerland\r\n                     Pommerland ist abgebrannt\r\n                     Maikäferchen fliege.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n                     May-fly, fly away,\r\n                     Your father is at war,\r\n                     Your mother is in Pommerland.\r\n                     Pommerland is all burned up!\r\n                     May-fly, fly away.\r\n\r\nDon’t you think it is like our rhyme?\r\n\r\n                        Lady-bug, lady-bug,\r\n                        Fly away home.\r\n                        Your house is on fire\r\n                        Your children will burn.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the French:\r\n\r\n                      Avril, tu t’en vas!\r\n                      Car Mai vient la-bas\r\n                      Pour balayer ta figure\r\n                      De pluie, aussi de froidure.\r\n                      Hanneton, vole!\r\n                      Hanneton, vole!\r\n\r\n                      Au firmament bleu,\r\n                      Ton nid est en feu,\r\n                      Les Turcs avec leur èpée\r\n                      Viennent tuer ta couvée.\r\n                      Hanneton, vole!\r\n                      Hanneton, vole!\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n                      April, away!\r\n                      For here cometh May\r\n                      With sunshine again\r\n                      To banish the rain.\r\n                      May-beetle, fly!\r\n                      May-beetle, fly!\r\n\r\n                      Afar in the sky,\r\n                      With flames leaping high,\r\n                      The Turks with swords rude\r\n                      Have slaughtered your brood.\r\n                      May-beetle, fly!\r\n                      May-beetle, fly!\r\n\r\nThe first comic opera, a _pastourale_ six hundred years old, _Le Jeu de\r\nRobin et de Marion_ by Adam de la Hale, is full of May songs.\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen of the May and May Pole dancers and the English\r\nJack-in-the-Green, the Thuringian Little Leaf Man and the Russian tree\r\ndressed up are only a few of the many examples of the rites of spring.\r\nAnd we have seen how the Druids and the Aztecs celebrated spring.\r\n\r\nOne of the most modern composers, Igor Stravinsky, has written a ballet\r\ncalled _Le Sacre du Printemps_ (Rites of Spring) in which he has used\r\nthe ancient Russian pagan rites of celebrating the spring. The music is\r\nwild and the rhythms primitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES\r\n\r\nFrom legends, we know that songs and dances of the Polish people\r\naccompanied their religious ceremonies before Christianity. When they\r\nexchanged their pagan gods for the teachings of the early Christian\r\nfathers, many of these songs were lost, but some of them were handed\r\ndown merely by changing the pagan name to the Christian. These songs\r\nhave been traced by the fact that many of them are based on the old\r\npentatonic scale. The Slavs, the Lithuanians and the Germanic races have\r\nkept this scale in Eastern and Middle Europe, and the Greeks, the\r\nancient Italians and the Celts brought it into Western and Southern\r\nEurope. These scales are supposed to have come from Indo-China, for it\r\nmust not be forgotten that the Polish along with all Slavs migrated from\r\nAsia, the cradle of the human race.\r\n\r\nTwo festivals,—St. John’s Eve and Christmas, came down from the pagan\r\nera in Poland and the manner of celebration has changed little\r\nthroughout the centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHRISTMAS CAROLS\r\n\r\nThe Polish Christmas Carol was also handed down from the days before\r\nChrist. The word “carol” comes from the old French _carole_ which was a\r\ndance, and gave its name to the song by which it was accompanied. In the\r\npagan time there were summer carols, winter carols, Easter carols and\r\ncarols that celebrated a religious winter festival. As the winter\r\nfestival occurred about the same time of the year as the Nativity or\r\nbirthday of the Saviour, it was celebrated in the Christian Church as\r\nChristmas. In England, the old Yule-tide of the Druids has influenced\r\nthe present celebration of Christmas with its fun, festivities and\r\nChristmas trees!\r\n\r\nThroughout Germany, Christmas Carols are still sung early every\r\nChristmas morning, and many of the old hymns have thus been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas Carol in France is called _Noël_ and the old English word\r\nwas _Nowell_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (3) LOVE SONGS\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that there are more love songs than any other kind of\r\nfolk music, and among them is some of the most beautiful music in the\r\nworld. You will find charming folk love songs of every nationality on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nDifferent countries have different marriage customs which give an\r\nintimate picture of the life in different periods, of countries and\r\ntribes far apart. Again we can trace forgotten relationships in like\r\ncustoms of bygone days. Singing and dancing are very important in all\r\nmarriage celebrations, and some wedding music is of great age.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, for example, the marriage customs and wedding music are very\r\nbeautiful and impressive. At the same time no folk dancing is wilder or\r\ngayer than that celebrating a peasant marriage.\r\n\r\nBefore going to a wedding ceremony, the Polish bride sings one\r\nparticular song built on the pentatonic scale, that has probably been\r\nsung for more than two thousand years! There are other wedding ceremony\r\nsongs that can be traced back almost as far.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany, during the 11th and 12th centuries, the priest demanded a\r\n“nuptial song” from the newly-weds on the Sunday following the wedding,\r\nas a wedding tax!\r\n\r\nIn another place the feudal lord demanded that every new bride should\r\ndance and sing before him and in return he decorated her with a bonnet\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\nYou haven’t forgotten the Indian and his love music played on the flute,\r\nhave you?\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (4) PATRIOTIC SONGS\r\n\r\nIn the recent World War, we had examples of how folk songs were made.\r\nThere were popular songs like _Over There_ (George Cohan), _The Long,\r\nLong Trail_ (by Zo Elliot), _Tipperary_, _Madelon_, that were sung by\r\nmillions. They were songs of the people, by the people and for the\r\npeople, and no one cared who wrote them.\r\n\r\nMost of the national hymns and patriotic songs were born in a time of\r\nstorm and stress. Words inspired by some special happening were written\r\non the spur of the moment, and often set to some familiar tune.\r\n_America_ was first sung to the tune of _God Save the King_ on July 4,\r\n1832. The words of _Star Spangled Banner_ were written by Francis Scott\r\nKey during the War of 1812 as he watched the bombardment of Fort McHenry\r\nin Chesapeake Bay, and was set to an English drinking song, _Anacreon in\r\nHeaven_. _Yankee Doodle_, a song first sung to make fun of the young\r\ncolonists, became the patriotic hymn of the Revolution! Where the tune\r\ncame from is a mystery, but it shows a family likeness to a little Dutch\r\nnursery song, a German street song, an old English country dance, a folk\r\ntune from the Pyrenees and one from Hungary! But we love our old _Yankee\r\nDoodle_ anyhow! _Hail Columbia_ was adapted to a tune, _The President’s\r\nMarch_, which had accompanied Washington when he was inaugurated, in New\r\nYork, as our first president.\r\n\r\nEngland’s _God Save the King_ was composed, words and music, by Henry\r\nCarey, and it was used first in 1743 during the Jacobite uprising. It\r\nhas since served America, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland. _Auld Lang\r\nSyne_ of Scotland was written by “Bobby” Burns and set to an old Scotch\r\ntune. _St. Patrick’s Day_ was originally a jig, and _The Wearing of the\r\nGreen_ was a street ballad of the Irish rebellion of 1798 mourning the\r\nfact that the Irish were forbidden to wear their national emblem, the\r\nshamrock. The Welsh song _Men of Harlech_, a stirring tune, dates from\r\n1468.\r\n\r\nThe French have several thrilling national songs. If you heard _Malbrouk\r\ns’en va-t-en guerre_ (Malbrouk to war is going) you would say, “Why!\r\nthat’s _For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow_.” So it is, and it has had a long\r\nand chequered career. It is supposed to have been brought into Europe by\r\none of the Crusaders, and was lost for five centuries; it cropped up\r\nagain in 1781 when Marie Antoinette sang it to put the little Dauphin\r\n(the French prince) to sleep. Paris picked up the tune and it was heard\r\nin every café and on every street corner. Napoleon who had no ear for\r\nmusic hummed it. It crossed the English channel. Even the Arabs sing a\r\npopular song like it which they call _Mabrooka_. Beethoven used the air\r\nin a Battle Symphony (1813).\r\n\r\nThe stirring hymn of France, is the _Marseillaise_ written by Rouget de\r\nl’Isle (1792) on the eve of the Revolution. It became the marching song\r\nof the French Army and was sung during the attack on the Tuileries\r\n(Paris), the king’s palace. It has always been the Republican song of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn almost every book you read about the French Revolution, _La\r\nCarmagnole_ and _Ça Ira_ are mentioned. They accompanied thousands of\r\nvictims to the guillotine. _Ça Ira_ (It will go!) was a popular dance\r\nwhich Marie Antoinette played on her _clavecin_. Little did she know\r\nthat the same tune would be shouted by the infuriated mobs as she was\r\ndriven through the streets of Paris in the tumbril to the guillotine!\r\n\r\nThe Italians show their natural love for opera by the fact that their\r\nnational hymn is adopted from Bellini’s opera _Somnambula_.\r\n\r\nThe _Rakoczy March_ of which you will hear later in the chapter is the\r\nHungarian national hymn.\r\n\r\nWe could write an entire book on this subject, but this is only to give\r\nyou a suggestion of how these songs grew and where they came from.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 (5) SONGS OF WORK AND LABOR AND TRADES\r\n\r\nWe have shown you the American Indians singing their songs as they fish\r\nand pound the corn; the boatmen rowing to the rhythm of their songs; and\r\nwe have tried to show you that everybody loved songs as much when they\r\nworked as when they danced. Haven’t you, too, hummed or sung while\r\nworking? People who accompany dish cloths and dusters with songs work\r\nbetter!\r\n\r\nAmerican negroes have used song to ease their work in the hot sunny\r\nfields. They not only sang, but men were hired to sing and act as song\r\nleaders in the slave days, to set the pace for workers, for more work\r\nwas done when the slaves moved to the rhythm of music. In modern\r\nfactories today, music is used to relieve the drudgery.\r\n\r\nIn Southern States the stevedores sing as they unload and load ships.\r\nAnd haven’t you often heard a rhythmic sound uttered by men hauling\r\nropes on ships or buildings?\r\n\r\nThe world over, sailors have their songs and dances, farmers their\r\nreaping and planting songs, spinners and weavers their songs, boatmen\r\nsongs like those on the Nile and the Volga boat song.\r\n\r\nWhile few Greek folk songs have come down to our time, we know that they\r\nhad songs for reaping the harvest, for grinding the barley, for\r\nthreshing the wheat, for pressing the grapes, for spinning wool, and for\r\nweaving. They also had the songs of the shoemaker, the dyer, of the\r\nbath-master, the water carrier, of the shepherd, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable spinning songs of all nationalities, and\r\nshepherds’ songs,—you probably know the French _Il etait une Bergère_.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, we hear that the workers when cleaning rice were led by\r\nsingers, who clapped their hands and stamped their feet to accompany the\r\nsong. One man reports that he heard the negro women singing a national\r\nsong in chorus, while pounding wheat always in time with the music.\r\n\r\nCharles Peabody tells of a leader in a band of slaves in America who was\r\nbesought by his companions not to sing a certain song because it made\r\nthem work too hard!\r\n\r\nThe difference between the negro songs and the labor songs of other\r\npeoples and places is, that the negroes had no special labor songs but\r\nsang their religious songs, which they adapted to all purposes and\r\noccasions, while the true labor song was composed to fit the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn old England we hear of the “Labor-lilts” which were all work songs of\r\nspinners, milk-maids and shepherds. And we must not neglect the old\r\nnight-watchman whom we meet in Wagner’s _Die Meistersinger_. Neither can\r\nwe let go by unnoticed the “town-crier” who told the news, good and bad.\r\nThe street calls and cries of the Middle Ages were labor songs, later,\r\nin England and in France made into real compositions.\r\n\r\nWe, in America, have the old Cow-boy songs, the Mining songs of\r\nCalifornia, and the Lumberjack songs of Maine. These are not exactly\r\nlabor songs but are first cousins to them.\r\n\r\nThe stage coach _postillons_ with their fascinating horn calls are\r\nreally music of trades or occupations, too. Isn’t it too bad that the\r\ninartistic jangle of the tram-car and the “honk-honk” of the automobile\r\ntear our ears instead of the tuneful hunting horns and postillon horns\r\nwhich are still occasionally heard in European forests!\r\n\r\nThe world’s workers sing to make work slip along easily, so you see song\r\nis a great lubricant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (6) DRINKING SONGS\r\n\r\nIn the great dining halls of the Middle Ages, when hunting parties\r\ngathered, and guests were received from near and far, or at Christmas\r\ntime, when in old Britain the Wassail-bowl flowed freely, drinking songs\r\nwere an important part of the banquet. At the splendid feasts in Rome,\r\ndrinking songs were popular. In fact, all over the world there are\r\nthousands of this kind of folk song.\r\n\r\nThe name Wassail dates back to the day when Vortigern, King of the\r\nBritons, visited Hengist, the Saxon. Rowena, Hengist’s daughter greeted\r\nhim with, “Was hail hla, ond cyning!” which mean in plain English, “Be\r\nof health, Lord King!” to which the king replied, “Drink heil” (Drink\r\nhealth).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE WORD VAUDEVILLE\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 15th century, two men named Basselin and Jean\r\nde Houx wrote many drinking songs. As they lived in the little valleys\r\n(in French called _vaux_) near Vire in Normandy, drinking songs came to\r\nbe called _vaux-de-vire_. At the same time, songs that were sung in the\r\nstreets, in fact, any folk songs with gay melodies and light words, were\r\ncalled _voix-de-ville_, (or voices of the city). So, in some way, these\r\ntwo terms became mixed, and the familiar word, _vaudeville_ is the\r\nresult!\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (7) DANCING SONGS\r\n\r\nIn the folk dance, man shows the feelings and dispositions of his race.\r\nFrom this dance of the people, all music gradually took a measured form,\r\na rhythmic thing that is lacking in the song of primitive people. In\r\nprimitive times, all dances were sung, particularly was this the case\r\nwith the Slav race. As instruments were perfected, they took the place\r\nof primitive drums and singing as accompaniment to the dance.\r\n\r\nThe plain chant, and in fact all music of the church, lacked the element\r\nwe call rhythm. It followed a metre or measure needed by the words, but\r\nthis was much more like talking than like singing. Even the ornamented\r\nchant of the soloists in the churches had no definiteness of time or of\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\nRhythm as we feel it today, occurs in two ways,—through the singing of\r\nverses and through dancing. We must not forget that early peoples were\r\nmuch like children, and took pleasure in jingles, and in moving their\r\nfeet and bodies in repeated motions which became dances.\r\n\r\nIt is most fascinating to see that the people who have the saddest\r\nsongs, have the gayest and wildest dances! Maybe it is because the\r\nsadder the nation the more need it has for some gay way of forgetting\r\nits woes. The Russians, the Poles, the Norwegians and the people of all\r\nnorth countries where the songs are minor and tragic, have the wildest\r\ndances. The clothes, too, of the folk in these countries are decked in\r\ncolored embroideries, and the decorations of the houses giddy and jolly.\r\nWhen the Russians get together they forget their sorrows in wild and\r\nalmost frenzied dances, and directly after they will sing songs of\r\ndeepest gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             POLISH DANCES\r\n\r\nThe Poles have several folk dances that are easily recognized by their\r\nrhythm and style. The great Polish composer Chopin used these folk\r\ndances in some of the loveliest piano music ever written. For more than\r\nsix centuries they have been used by Polish composers, yet there are\r\npeople who say that folk song has no influence on musical art.\r\n\r\nThe Polonaise, in ¾ time, a stately dance of the aristocracy and nobles\r\nrather than of the people, began as a folk dance, and is supposed to\r\nhave come from the Christmas Carol. The rhythm of the Polonaise, is\r\neasily recognized and followed. In the early times, these polonaises had\r\nno composer’s tag, but were often named for some Polish hero, and thus\r\nshow the date in which they were born.\r\n\r\nOne Polish writer dates the “courtly” polonaise from 1573. The year\r\nfollowing the election of Henry III of Anjou, a great reception took\r\nplace at Cracow, in which all the ladies of high rank marched in\r\nprocession past the throne to the sound of a stately dance. This was the\r\nbeginning of the stately polonaise, in which old and young took part,\r\nmarching all through the great drawing rooms and gardens.\r\n\r\nThe Mazurka, another very popular Polish dance, is also in ¾ time, but\r\nfaster than the polonaise, and slower than the waltz. It is performed by\r\na few couples at a time, two to eight but rarely more. The accent of the\r\nmeasure falls on the third beat, which distinguishes it from a waltz.\r\n\r\nOther well known Polish dances are the _Krakowiak_ in ²⁄₄ time, the\r\n_Kujawiak_ in ¾ time, the _Obertass_ in ¾ time, the dance of the\r\nmountaineers, called the _Kolomyjka_ in ²⁄₄ time, and the _Kosah_ in ²⁄₄\r\ntime. All these dances are fast, and all of them come directly from folk\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPANISH DANCE-SONGS\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to tell which of the Spanish folk pieces are dances and\r\nwhich at first were songs, because the favorite songs of Spain are\r\nnearly all sung as accompaniments to dancing. Spain had almost as rich\r\ntroubadour music as France, because the influence of the troubadours and\r\nof the jongleurs was very strong, Provence being Spain’s neighbor. In\r\nCatalonia the Provençal language has been used since the 9th century,\r\nand the folk music differs from that of other parts of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe songs of Spain divide themselves into four groups. The Basque, the\r\nmusic of Biscay and Navarre, unlike any music of which we have told you,\r\nis irregular in rhythm, melody, and scale, and the _jota_ is one of its\r\ncharacteristic dances. Galicia and Castile have gay, bright, strong\r\nmarked dance rhythms as may be seen from their characteristic _boleros_\r\nand _seguidillas_. Andalusian music and that of Southern Spain is\r\nperhaps the most beautiful of all, for here we find the influence of the\r\nOriental music to a marked degree, in the use of the scale, in florid\r\nornament, and in the richness of the rhythm; the dances _fandangos_,\r\n_rondeñas_ and _malagueñas_ are thought to be finer than the songs. The\r\nguitar is the king of instruments in Andalusia and how Spanish it is!\r\nThe fourth group of songs is from Catalonia of French influence and less\r\nSpanish than the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE BALLAD AND THE BALLET\r\n\r\nIn the English language we have the word _ballad_, which means a long\r\npoem in which a story is told. We also use the French word _ballet_, for\r\na dance on the stage. These two words come from the same root, and show\r\nthat at one time ballads and dance tunes were practically the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nThe English dance song, the “round” or the same dance in France called\r\nthe _ronde_, was a popular dance for many centuries, some of which are\r\nmost amusing and curious. One dance tune from the 12th century has Latin\r\nwords; there is also a well known tune, Sellenger’s Round, from the\r\ncollection called the _Fitzwilliam Virginal Book_. Another famous ballad\r\n(dance) was _Trenchmore_, a good sample of English folk dance at the end\r\nof the 16th century:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRENCHMORE]\r\n\r\nAn English writer (how childlike was his fun!) in 1621 says of\r\n_Trenchmore_, “Who can withstand it? be we young or old, though our\r\nteeth shake in our heads like virginal jacks (see page 310), or stand\r\nparallel asunder like the arches of a bridge, there is no remedy; we\r\nmust dance Trenchmore over tables, chairs, and stools!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MORRIS DANCE\r\n\r\nThe English Morris Dance is a sort of pageant accompanied by dancing. It\r\nmay have come from the _Morisco_, a Moorish dance popular in Spain and\r\nFrance, or perhaps from the Matassins, also called Buffoons, who did a\r\ndance in armor, which may have come from the Arabs. This dance of the\r\nBuffoons, popular in France during the 16th and 17th centuries, was\r\nperformed by four men with swords, and bells attached to their costumes,\r\nused also in the Morris Dance. It may have come into England at the end\r\nof the 14th century, but in the 15th it was flourishing. First it was\r\ngiven as a part of the May festival and the characters who took part in\r\nit were a Lady of the May, a Fool, a Piper, and two or more dancers. The\r\ndance then became a part of the _Robin Hood_ pageant, and the dancers\r\nwere called after the characters of the Robin Hood ballad: Robin Hood,\r\nFriar Tuck, Little John, and Maid Marian. Later, a hobby-horse, a\r\ndragon, four marshals, and other characters were added. The Puritans\r\nstopped the Morris Dance as they thought it too frivolous, and it was\r\nnever so popular again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CUSHION DANCE\r\n\r\nIn the _Story of Minstrelsy_ is quoted a description of the Cushion\r\nDance from _The Dancing Master_ (1686):\r\n\r\n“This dance is begun by a single person (either a man or woman), who,\r\ntaking a cushion in hand, dances about the room, and at the end of the\r\ntune stops and sings, ‘This dance it will no further go.’ The musician\r\nanswers, ‘I pray you, good sir, why say you so?’ Man: ‘Because Joan\r\nSanderson will not come too.’ Musician: ‘She must come too, and she\r\nshall come too, and she must come whether she will or no.’ Then he lays\r\ndown the cushion before the woman, on which she kneels, and he kisses\r\nher, singing, ‘Welcome, Joan Sanderson, welcome, welcome.’ Then she\r\nrises, takes up the cushion, and both dance, singing, ‘Prinkum-prankum\r\nis a fine dance!’” Why not try it?\r\n\r\nThomas Morley (1597) wrote of a kind of dance-part-song called\r\n_vilanelle_ or _ballete_. “These and all other kinds of light musick,\r\nsaving the madrigal, are by a general name called _aires_. There be also\r\nanother kind of ballets commonly called _Fa-la’s_....”\r\n\r\nWhen printing was invented these ballads (or ballets) appeared in such\r\nquantities, that they became a nuisance. Any subject or event was made\r\ninto a ballad. They were usually printed on single sheets so that an\r\ninstrument like the viol could play the air, and were carried around in\r\nbaskets and sold for a trifle. Ballad-singing in the streets took the\r\nplace of the older minstrels, but the newer fashion never reached the\r\ndignity of the bards. These ballads were used as dances.\r\n\r\nBoth Henry VIII and Queen Mary issued edicts forbidding the printing of\r\nbooks, ballads, and rhymes, probably because many were political ballads\r\nuncomplimentary to them. In Elizabeth’s reign the edict was removed, and\r\nmany of these dance-songs are found in the plays of Shakespeare and are\r\nsung today in concerts as examples of English folk music.\r\n\r\nMany of the better ones have been preserved for us in the _Fitzwilliam\r\nVirginal Book_, which is often wrongly called _Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nVirginal Book_, and in Playford’s _English Dancing Master_ in which\r\nthere are ninety-five songs used for dancing; they are also to be heard\r\nin the _Beggar’s Opera_ which contains sixty-nine airs, among which may\r\nbe mentioned _Sally in our Alley_, _Bonny Dundee_, _Green Sleeves_,\r\n_Lilliburlero_, _Over the Hills and Far Away_, etc. John Gay gathered\r\nthese folk songs and dances into _The Beggar’s Opera_ in 1727, and it\r\nwas recently (1920) revived with great success in London and New York.\r\n\r\nTiersot (an authority on French folk music) has shown that Adam de la\r\nHale probably wrote the play of _Le Jeu de Robin et de Marion_ and then\r\nstrung together a number of popular tunes, many of far older date, to\r\nsuit his words. So this pastoral-comedy may be the oldest collection of\r\nFrench folk tunes in existence.\r\n\r\nIn France, when a dance-air became popular, the rhymers made up words to\r\nfit the music; this was called _parodying_ it. Our use of the word\r\n“parody” means to make fun of something, but at that time, the word\r\nmeant to adapt words to a melody. One of the early French writers\r\ntranslated the Psalms for use in the Church, and these very Psalms which\r\nwere dedicated to François I, the King, were “parodied,” so that the\r\npeople sang them to their favorite dance tunes,—_courantes_,\r\n_sarabandes_ and _bourrées_. This happened at a time when church music\r\nwas being popularized, and one hears queer tales of the use of popular\r\nsongs in the masses and motets of the 14th and 15th centuries. It sounds\r\nsacrilegious to us, doesn’t it?\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the mixing-up of tunes and words, the French folk dances\r\nbesides being very charming and winning were the parents of a most\r\nimportant kind of musical composition. Just to keep you from being too\r\ncurious, the name of this important musical composition is the Suite—but\r\nwait!\r\n\r\n\r\n                (8) FUNERAL SONGS AND SONGS FOR MOURNING\r\n\r\nAll people from the savage state to the most civilized have had their\r\nfuneral songs and songs for mourning which have been characteristic of\r\nthe day and age to which they belonged and revealed many tribal and\r\nracial beliefs, superstitions and customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  (9) NARRATIVES, BALLADS AND LEGENDS\r\n\r\nWe shall not tarry long on this subject for it has been covered in the\r\nchapter on Troubadours and Minnesingers.\r\n\r\nAll primitive races used this means of teaching and preserving their\r\ntribal history, legends, etc., of telling the news of the day and of\r\npraising their over-lords. Many hundreds of volumes of ballads of all\r\ncountries are to be found and are most useful as well as entertaining in\r\nthe story of mankind.\r\n\r\nAmong the most famous narratives known to us are: the _Sagas_ and\r\n_Eddas_ and _Runes_ of the Northlands; the _Kalevala_ of Finland; the\r\n_Percy Reliques_ of Britain; the _Odyssey_ and _Iliad_ of ancient\r\nGreece; the _Song of Roland_ of France, _Beowulf_ of the Anglo-Saxons,\r\nand others, many of which have been translated and simplified for young\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                    National Portraits in Folk Music\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one particularly lovely thing about folk songs and dances and\r\nthat is the natural labels which they bear, marking them as belonging to\r\nFrance, Spain, Germany, Russia and so on. As with people, they all have\r\nsimilarities and yet no two are the same in looks or in actions. It\r\nwould not take you long to know whether you were hearing a Spanish folk\r\ndance, an Irish Jig, a Russian Hopak, a Norwegian Halling or an American\r\nFoxtrot, because each has its own kind of rhythm and melody.\r\n\r\nSome nations have gay, bright folk music, and others have sad, mournful\r\nmusic. In northern countries where living is hard on account of the\r\nlong, dark, cold winters, and the people are forced to spend much time\r\nindoors and away from neighbors, where money and food are scarce, they\r\nare likely to be sad and lonely. In the centuries gone by they made up\r\nsongs that pictured their lives and their surroundings. On the other\r\nhand, in countries where the sun shines most of the time, where people\r\nlive out of doors, are happy, and have many friends and much fun, the\r\nmusic is gayer and usually lighter. This is why the music of Finland,\r\nSweden, Norway and northern Russia is so much in the minor key, and\r\nseems grey, and why the music of Italy Spain, France and other southern\r\ncountries is in the major key and seems rosier in color and happier in\r\nmood. Other reasons, too, for sad folk music is oppression, harsh rulers\r\nand harsh laws. So the Finns and Russians, the American negroes and the\r\nHebrew tribes sang sad songs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _“The Music Making Boys,” by Frans Hals, from the Kassel Gallery,\r\n    Germany._\r\n\r\n  _Boys with a Lute._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After a painting by Teniers, in the gallery at Munich._\r\n\r\n  _A Peasant Wedding._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RUSSIAN FOLK MUSIC\r\n\r\nAgain you see history in the songs, particularly in the Russian folk\r\nmusic, which shows us in musical portraits, the tragedy of their lives\r\nunder cruel czars and serfdom. They sang in ancient scales which make\r\nthe music all the more mournful to our ears.\r\n\r\nThe rhythms in these songs are different from those of romance languages\r\nor those derived from Latin, for the Russians have a language of Slavic\r\nbirth. The Russians have some Oriental blood from the Tartars who\r\ninvaded Russia and who were descended from Tartar, a Mogul or Mongol\r\nfrom Asia. When you hear Russian songs that sound Oriental, you will\r\nagree with Rimsky-Korsakov, the Russian composer, that the Russian, deep\r\ndown below the skin is an Oriental even though he has been living in\r\nEurope for many centuries.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, from the Baltic Sea on the north to the Caucasus Mountains on\r\nthe south, from the sunny slopes of the Ural Mountains on the west, to\r\nthe bleak desert wastes of Kirghiz on the east, these mixed races have a\r\ncommon tie in their love for folk story and folk music.\r\n\r\nMarvelous tales have been handed down by word of mouth about the river\r\ngods and the wood-sprites, about the animals who talked like men, and\r\nthe ugly old witch, Baba-Yaga, whose name alone was enough to quiet the\r\nnaughtiest child! Through these folk tales you can follow the Russians\r\nfrom the time they were primitive men and pagans through all their\r\nbattles and the invasions of barbarous tribes, to the time when they\r\nbecame Christians and had to struggle against the Tartars, the Turks and\r\nthe Poles. All these happenings were put into songs and are the epic, or\r\ntale-telling folk music of the Russians.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most interesting things, we think, in all the growing of\r\nmusic into maturity, is that Russia never had anything but folk music\r\nuntil the 19th century! Music always belonged to the people, and there\r\nwere no musical scholars making it the possession of the educated\r\nclasses only.\r\n\r\nTchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and other Russians took the folk song from\r\nits humble surroundings and used it in their compositions, for they\r\nrealized its beauty and its richness.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have instruments brought down from very early times, which\r\nare found today in no other country. Perhaps you may have heard a\r\nRussian _balalaika_ orchestra. The _balalaika_ is a stringed instrument,\r\nwith a triangular body and long neck, having three or sometimes four\r\nstrings, which are plucked and sound something like a guitar. It dates\r\nback to the end of the 13th century. They also have an instrument like a\r\nmandolin, with three strings, that dates from the 13th century also. It\r\ncame from Asia at the time of the Mongolian invasion.\r\n\r\nAnother instrument, a descendant of the Greek _psalterion_ and known to\r\nhave been in Russia since the 9th century, is the _gusslee_. It is\r\nsomething like a zither, and is composed of a hollow box, strung with\r\nany number from seven to thirteen up to twenty-four strings. It is held\r\non the lap, and the strings are plucked with the fingers.\r\n\r\nThere is also a sort of lute or _bandoura_ with many strings, dating\r\nfrom the 16th century, played principally by the blind who belong to\r\ngroups of minstrels. There is also a wooden clarinet, on which one scale\r\ncan be played. Its special purpose was for use at funerals, and its\r\nname, which comes from a word meaning tomb, is _jaleika_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FINNISH SONGS\r\n\r\nThe Finns, a northern people, although often dominated either by Sweden\r\nor Russia, have their own songs and peculiar rhythms. The _Kalevala_ is\r\ntheir great epic poem, like the _Iliad_ of Greece, _Beowulf_ of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, and the _Eddas_ of Iceland. From this narrative poem or\r\nepic, have come many a folk-tune. Besides, they sing of their beautiful\r\ncountry, often called the country of lakes.\r\n\r\nThe typical rhythm of Finland is the ⁵⁄₄ time which sounds most\r\nattractive. They have the _kantele_, a plucked string instrument, and\r\nthey glory in their folk music which they use as an everyday joy and do\r\nnot “turn it on” only for “hey-days and holidays.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             POLAND’S MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe Polish people have loved music as the Russians love it, and although\r\nPoland has been reconquered, divided and redivided among the surrounding\r\nkingdoms of Europe, it has always kept its own music. So we have another\r\nset of Slav songs but with certain rhythmical differences, not found in\r\nthe music of other nations. (Chapter IX.)\r\n\r\nThere is an Oriental strain in this music, too, and it must be very\r\nancient indeed, for Oriental tribes have not lived in this country for\r\nages.\r\n\r\nIn addition to an instrument like the Russian _gusslee_, and a violin\r\nlike the Arabian _rebab_, the Polish have a clarinet made of wood,\r\ncalled by its old name of _chalumeau_, the lute, and an instrument\r\ncalled the _kobza_, belonging to the bagpipe family. This is of great\r\nage, but is still in use among the mountaineers of Carpathia, and is\r\nmade of goat skin with three pipe attachments. The _kobza_ can replace\r\nan entire orchestra!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GYPSIES\r\n\r\nGypsies! The name fires our imagination and brings up pictures of\r\ndark-skinned, black-eyed people with glossy black hair, dressed in gay\r\ncolored shawls, with bright kerchiefs wound around their heads. We think\r\nof them as being on “one grand picnic,” living out of doors, cooking\r\ntheir meals over bonfires in the open, sleeping in their covered wagons\r\nor tents, or under the stars, always gay, care-free and dirty! Then,\r\nthink of the Gypsy music,—the dances, the songs, and the wonderful\r\nviolin playing! So wild, so weird, so out-of-doors is it, that we are\r\nthrilled by the very thought of it.\r\n\r\nWhere did these folk come from? Who are they? What are they? They have\r\nspread over most of Europe, and are found in Hungary, Bohemia, Roumania,\r\nItaly, Spain, Germany, Russia, England, Turkey, and even America. They\r\nare a race and they have a language of their own. Theirs is a mixture of\r\nthe ancient _Prakrit_ or Indian, with the different languages with which\r\nthey have come in contact in the course of many centuries. Men who make\r\na study of the history of languages say, that in their idioms, they show\r\ntraces of roving for many centuries in Asiatic countries, before\r\nreaching Europe in or before the 15th century. They are often called\r\n“Bohemians” because Bohemia (Czecho-Slovakia) seems to have been their\r\nmain European camping-ground. It is generally agreed that they came from\r\nIndia and that they are Asiatic, but they got their name _Gypsy_, a\r\ncontraction of the word Egyptian, because people at first thought that\r\nthey came from Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Gypsies have an extraordinary gift for music. They do not study it\r\nas an art, as we do, and cannot even read musical notes, but they\r\nimitate and memorize, and reach a high degree of skill in playing,\r\nparticularly the violin. They have such great power of imitation, that\r\nthey rapidly learn to play the instruments, and accustom themselves to\r\nthe folk music they find wherever they wander. However, they always keep\r\nsomething of their own sadness and wildness. In Spain, they accompany\r\nthemselves on the guitar, and mark the rhythm with castanets, as do the\r\nSpaniards themselves, borrowing the Spanish folk songs which they sing\r\nin their own way. In Russia, England, Turkey and everywhere they do the\r\nsame with the folk music of those countries.\r\n\r\nThe special traits, then, of the music of the Gypsies, are found rather\r\nin the way they play, interpret and express the music of others, than as\r\ncomposers of their own music. Yet they use strongly marked rhythms,\r\nflorid ornamentation, and scales that are Oriental, which show us from\r\nwhere they came. Here is one of their most used scales:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scales]\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of scales among the Gypsies,—a mixture of the\r\nOriental scale with the pentatonic, and with the European major and\r\nminor.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian Gypsy has made more music than any other branch of the\r\nGypsy people. In fact, when we hear music that makes us exclaim, “Oh,\r\nthat is real Gypsy music!” it is almost always Hungarian. At least one\r\nquarter of the inhabitants of Hungary, a name which comes from the\r\nbarbarian tribe of Huns, are Magyars, descendants of Tartars and\r\nMongolians of Asia, who settled in the land of the Huns in the 9th\r\ncentury. In the national music of Hungary, we find it hard to tell just\r\nwhat is Magyar, and what is Gypsy, because the two have intermingled for\r\nso long.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is that this Magyar-Gypsy folk music has been the\r\ninspiration of hundreds of trained composers, like Haydn (see the Gypsy\r\nRondo from his piano trio, also arranged for piano alone), Franz Liszt\r\nwho wrote many famous Hungarian Rhapsodies, Hector Berlioz who made the\r\nHungarian Rakoczy March famous, Johannes Brahms who used many folk songs\r\nin his compositions and wrote a set of Hungarian Dances. Even Bach,\r\nperhaps the greatest of all composers, seems to have been influenced by\r\nthe Gypsy music as played on the Hungarian _cembalo_.\r\n\r\nNo Hungarian Gypsy orchestra is complete without a cembalo, which looks\r\nsomething like an old-fashioned square piano with the top off. This is\r\nstrung with metal strings covering a range of four octaves, and is\r\nplayed with two small limber hammers. The cembalo players perform with\r\ngreat rapidity and agility; they are able to play scales, arpeggios,\r\ntrills, and the tricks of Gypsy music with great skill and ease. It is\r\nnot known just when this instrument came into use, but it is a\r\ndescendant of the _dulcimer_ and _psaltery_, instruments we hear of in\r\nthe Bible, and in Arabia and Persia, probably brought into Europe during\r\nthe Crusades.\r\n\r\nThe _czardas_ (pronounced chardas) is an old Hungarian dance in which\r\nare all the national characteristics of this folk music, well marked in\r\nsyncopated rhythms (rhythms out of focus, page 144, Chapter X), strong\r\naccents, many ornaments. The Gypsies dance the czardas every time they\r\nget a chance, for they love it. It has two contrasting parts, one is\r\ncalled _lassan_ which is very slow and sad, and the other called\r\n_friska_ which is very fast and fiery.\r\n\r\nPanna Czinka, a Gypsy Queen, who lived in the 18th century was the\r\ndaughter of the chief of a band of Gypsies and she inherited his title\r\nwhen she was very young. She married a ’cellist of her tribe and went\r\nall through Hungary, Poland and Roumania playing on a wonderful Amati\r\nviolin, in a very wonderful way. She brought the _Rakoczy March_ to the\r\npeople, although it is not known whether or not she composed it. She\r\nalways wore men’s clothes of most picturesque type and when she died she\r\nrequested to have her beloved violin buried with her! Long after her\r\ndeath she was still an inspiration to young Gypsy fiddlers, who all\r\nlonged to play as beautifully as Panna Czinka.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BOHEMIAN FOLK SONG\r\n\r\nBohemia is rich in folk dances, most of which are named for places where\r\nthey originated or the occasions for which they were used, or from songs\r\nby which they are accompanied.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemians have a bagpipe called the _Dudelsack_ and the player is\r\ncalled a _Dudelsackpfeiffer_!\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE FOLK MUSIC\r\n\r\nTo the outsider, there is a national color, rhythm, and charm in Spanish\r\nmusic that is unmistakable. We recognize it immediately as Spanish, but\r\nthe Spaniard will be able to tell you the province from which it came,\r\nfor there is as much difference between a Castilian song and a Basque,\r\nas we find between the speech of a Virginian and a Vermontian! (Chapter\r\nIX.)\r\n\r\nPortugal, although Spain’s next door neighbor, has quite a different\r\nmusic; it is peaceful, tranquil and thoughtful, but doesn’t thrill you\r\nas does the Spanish music. The Portuguese are calmer and less excitable\r\nthan the Spaniards, so here again you see the character and qualities of\r\npeople coming out in the music or what we like to call the musical\r\nportrait of a nation. There are no exaggerated rhythms but instead a\r\nsteady melancholy flow of melody.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FRENCH FOLK MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe portrait of France that we get from her folk music is much like the\r\none we find in songs of her troubadours and trouvères. In southern\r\nFrance, the folk songs are gay and filled with poetic sentiment and\r\nreligious feeling; from Burgundy come some of her loveliest Noëls\r\n(Christmas songs) and also the drinking songs. From Normandy, come songs\r\nof ordinary everyday doings; their mill songs, when sung out in the open\r\non a summer night by the peasants are very beautiful and often show\r\nstrong religious feeling. Brittany whose inhabitants were originally\r\nCelts have a music not unlike the Welsh, Scotch and Irish. Long ago, the\r\nfamous French writer and musician of the 18th century, Jean Jacques\r\nRousseau, said of it, “The airs are not snappy, they have, I know not\r\nwhat of an antique and sweet mood which touches the heart. They are\r\nsimple, naïve and often sad—at any rate they are pleasing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GERMAN FOLK MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe _Volkslieder_ or folk songs of the Germans are the backbone of the\r\ngreat classical and romantic periods of the 18th and 19th centuries\r\nwhich made Bach, Mozart, Schubert and Schumann, Wagner and Brahms the\r\nmusic masters of the world.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 14th century collections of these songs had been made,\r\nthe subjects of which were mostly historical. By the 16th century music\r\nhad grown so much that every sentiment of the human heart and every\r\noccupation of life had its own song: students, soldiers, pedlars,\r\napprentices all had their songs. These are folk songs of Class A,\r\nbecause their composers forgot to leave their names and no musical\r\narchæologist has been able to dig them up. (Page 108. Chapter IX.)\r\n\r\nThese songs became melodies independent of the accompaniment. They also\r\nput the major scale on a firm basis which took the place of the church\r\nmodes. Their spirit and power were felt in every branch of music, and\r\nthey supplied melodies for the chorales or hymns, for the lute players\r\nand organists in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.\r\n\r\nEvery town had its own band called the _Stadt Pfeifferei_ (town pipers).\r\nThe peasant boys played the fiddle, and the shepherds the _schalmey_, (a\r\nkind of oboe). Every festivity was accompanied by song and dance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            IRISH FOLK SONGS\r\n\r\nNo people in the world have more fancy and imagination, a keener sense\r\nof humor, are more fun-loving and more superstitious than the Irish. All\r\nthese qualities come out in their vast treasure of folk music, which is\r\nconsidered the most beautiful and the most varied of all the music that\r\nhas come from peasant folk. The subjects cover practically every phase\r\nof life from the castle to the cot, and songs of every heading we have\r\nincluded in the last chapter. There are reels, jigs, marches,\r\nspinning-tunes, nurse-tunes, planxties (Irish or Welsh melodies for the\r\nharp in the nature of a lament), plough-songs and whistles. The Irish\r\nfolk songs are rich historically as well as beautiful musically.\r\n\r\nThe form of the Irish folk music is perfect, and is a model of what\r\nsimple song form has been for several centuries. In fact, all large\r\nforms have been built on just such principles of balance and contrast as\r\nare found in an Irish folk song called _The Flight of the Earls_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SCOTCH AND WELSH TUNES\r\n\r\nThe Scotch and Welsh also have a very rich store of folk song and\r\nballads. Along with the Irish they are children of the early Celts and\r\nhave brought down to us the music of early times. In all this music we\r\nfind the pentatonic scale, and a rhythm of this character ♩♩ ♩♩ a dotted\r\nnote followed by a note of shorter value, which gives a real lilt to\r\nIrish, Welsh and Scotch music. We told you about the Welsh bards and\r\ntheir queer violin without a neck, called a _crwth_, and their little\r\nharp that was handed around their banquet tables from guest to guest.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic music, or that of the Scotch Highlands, dates back to\r\nprehistoric times. You have seen a Scotch Highlander in his plaid and\r\nkilties playing on his bagpipe, and it has a special kind of scale (two\r\npentatonic scales put together) like this:\r\n\r\n                          G A B    D E    G\r\n                            A B C♯   E F♯   A\r\n\r\nand a drone bass (one tone that does not change and is played all\r\nthrough the piece) which makes it hard to get the same effect on the\r\npiano. Scotch bagpipes are heard in districts where the milk-maids and\r\nserving folk get together in the “ingle,” and still “lilt” in the good\r\nold-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nThe thing that makes us know Scotch music from any other is a queer\r\nlittle trick of the rhythm called the _snap_ in which a note of short\r\nvalue is followed by a dotted note of longer value, instead of the other\r\nway around which is more commonly found. Thus: ♩♩ ♩♩ but the two ways\r\nare always combined, thus: ♩♩ ♩♩|♩♩ ♩♩ ♩♩|♩♩ and so on. If you want to\r\nmake up a real Scotch tune yourself, just play this rhythm up and down\r\nthe black keys of the piano from F# to the next F#!\r\n\r\nMany of the lovely poems of Robert Burns have been set to old Scotch\r\nairs. He saved many of the old songs, for he gathered the remains of\r\nunpublished old ballads and songs, and snatches of popular melodies, and\r\nwith genius gave life to the fragments he found. In his own words, “I\r\nhave collected, begged, borrowed and stolen all the songs I could meet\r\nwith.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CANADIAN FOLK SONGS\r\n\r\nCanada has the folk songs of the _habitant_ which are French in\r\ncharacter. They are very beautiful and full of romance and many of them\r\ncan be traced back to France. Many, however, were born in Canada and\r\nreveal the hearts of people who lived in the great lonely spaces of a\r\nnew country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ENGLISH FOLK SONGS\r\n\r\nMost of the English folk songs are very practical accounts of the doings\r\nof the people. The English seemed more interested in human beings than\r\nin Nature, like the Scotch and Irish, or in romantic love songs like the\r\nLatin races in Spain, France and Italy. The English had to be practical\r\nfor they were always leaders and at the head of things, while the Scots\r\nand Irish were further away from the center and rush of life and so went\r\nto Nature for their subjects.\r\n\r\nThere are about five thousand English folk songs which sing of the\r\nEnglish milk-maid and her work, the carpenter, the hunter and his\r\nhounds, and hunting calls. They have the Morris Dance tunes, the May-day\r\nsongs, the sailor’s chanties, they even sing of criminals famous in\r\nhistory and always very definitely tell the full name and whereabouts of\r\na character in a song. They also have songs of poachers (those who hunt\r\non land forbidden them), of murderers and hangmen as well as shepherds\r\nand sailors. But England’s finest songs are the Christmas carols which\r\nsing of the birth of Jesus. So, if they sang little of Nature they did\r\nsing of man and God and have given us much that is beautiful and worth\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OLD ENGLISH CAROL\r\n                 FROM THE TIME OF HENRY IV, OR EARLIER\r\n\r\n        Lullay! lullay! lytel child, myn owyn dere fode,\r\n        How xalt thou sufferin be nayled on the rode.\r\n              So blyssid be the tyme!\r\n\r\n        Lullay! lullay! lytel child, myn owyn dere smerte,\r\n        How xalt thou sufferin the sharp spere to Thi herte?\r\n              So blyssid be the tyme!\r\n\r\n        Lullay! lullay! lytel child, I synge all for Thi sake,\r\n        Many on is the scharpe schour to This body is schape.\r\n              So blyssid be the tyme!\r\n\r\n        Lullay! lullay! lytel child, fayre happis the befalle,\r\n        How xalt thou sufferin to drynke ezyl and galle?\r\n              So blyssid be the tyme!\r\n\r\n        Lullay! lullay! lytel child, I synge al beforn,\r\n        How xalt thou sufferin the scharp garlong of thorn?\r\n              So blyssid be the tyme!\r\n\r\n        Lullay! lullay! lytel child, gwy wepy Thou so sore,\r\n        Thou art bothin God and man, gwat woldyst Thou be more?\r\n              So blyssid be the tyme!\r\n\r\n (From the Sloane MSS. Quoted from _The Study of Folk Songs_, by Countess\r\n    Martinengo-Cesaresco).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AMERICAN FOLK MUSIC\r\n\r\nWe come now to a question that has been the subject of many arguments\r\nand debates. Many claim that we have no folk music in the United States,\r\nand others claim that we have. It would take a whole volume to present\r\nboth sides and we must reduce it to a sugar-coated capsule.\r\n\r\nAlthough we know that Stephen Foster wrote _Old Folks at Home_, _The Old\r\nKentucky Home_, _Uncle Ned_, _Massa’s in the Cold_, _Cold Ground_, and\r\n_Old Black Joe_, they express so perfectly the mood and spirit of the\r\npeople that they are true folk songs. Harold Vincent Milligan in his\r\nbook on Stephen Foster says: “Every folk-song is first born in the heart\r\nand brain of some one person, whose spirit is so finely attuned to the\r\nvoice of that inward struggle which is the history of the soul of man,\r\nthat when he seeks for his own self-expression he at the same time gives\r\na voice to that vast ‘mute multitude who die and give no sign.’”\r\n\r\nAnd again speaking of Stephen Foster, Mr. Milligan says: “Although\r\npurists may question their right to the title ‘folk songs’ his melodies\r\nare truly the songs of the American people.”\r\n\r\nThe folk music of which we have told you has been the music portraits of\r\ndifferent peoples such as the Russian, the Polish, the French, the\r\nGerman, the English, the Irish and so on. If there has been a mixture of\r\npeoples or tribes as in England where there were Britons, Danes, Angles,\r\nSaxons and Normans, it happened so long ago that they have become molded\r\ninto one race. We are all Americans but we are not of one race, and we\r\nare still in the process of being molded into one type.\r\n\r\nWe unite people of all nations under one flag and one government, but we\r\nhave been sung to sleep and amused as children by the folk songs of the\r\nEuropean nations to which our parents and grandparents belonged! And so\r\nwe have heard from childhood _Sur le Pont d’Avignon_, _Schlaf Kindlein\r\nSchlaf_, _Wurmland_, _The Volga Boat Song_, _Sally in our Alley_, or\r\n_The Wearing of the Green_, none of which is American.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these obstacles to the growth of a folk music in\r\nAmerica, we have several sources from which they have come.\r\n\r\nAs our earliest settlers in Virginia and New England were English, they\r\nbrought with them many of their folk songs and some of these have\r\nremained unchanged in the districts where people of other nations have\r\nnot penetrated. _The Lonesome Tunes_ of the Kentucky mountains, also of\r\nTennessee, the Carolinas and Vermont are examples of this kind of\r\nEnglish folk song in America.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana which was settled by the French, we find a type of folk\r\nsong that is very charming. It is a combination of old French folk song\r\nwith negro spiritual, and is brought to us by the Creoles.\r\n\r\nIn California there is a strong Spanish flavor in some of the old\r\nballads that date from the time of the Spanish Missions. There are also\r\nmining songs of the “days of ’49,” including _Oh Susannah_, by Stephen\r\nFoster, and we defy you to get rid of the tune if once it “gets you!”\r\n\r\nThen there are cow-boy songs of the Plains, _The Texas Rangers_, _The\r\nShip that Never Returned_, _The Cow-boy’s Lament_ and _Bury Me Not on\r\nthe Lone Prairie_; the Lumberjack songs of Maine; the well known air of\r\nthe _Arkansas Traveller_, which was a funny little sketch for theatre of\r\na conversation between the Arkansas traveller and a squatter which is\r\ninterrupted by snatches of a tune; and in addition a whole book full of\r\nsongs sung in the backwoods settlements, hunting cabins and lumber camps\r\nin northern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSo if you seek, you can find a large number of folk songs without going\r\nto the Indian or the Negro.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War brought out a number of new national songs among them\r\n_Glory Hallelujah_ and _Dixie_. _Dixie_ was written in 1859 as a song\r\nand “walk-around” by the famous minstrel Dan Emmett, and became a war\r\nsong by accident. It had dash and a care-free spirit, and the rollicking\r\nway it pictured plantation life attracted the soldiers of the South when\r\nthey were in the cold winter camps in the North. Its rhythm is so\r\nirresistible that it makes your hands and feet go in spite of yourself.\r\nBesides these two the soldiers of the Civil War marched to _Rally Round\r\nthe Flag, Boys_, _Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching_, _Home,\r\nSweet Home_, _Lily Dale_, _The Girl I Left Behind Me_, _Hail Columbia_\r\nand _The Star Spangled Banner_.\r\n\r\nWe have told you so much about the Indian and his song that it is\r\nunnecessary now to dwell at length on his music. Of course some American\r\ncomposers have used Indian folk legend and music, but after all it\r\nremains the musical portrait of the Red Man and has not become the heart\r\nlanguage of the white man.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, a real folk-expression that has had a great deal of\r\ninfluence on our popular music and will probably help to create a\r\nserious music to which we can attach the label “Made in America,” and\r\nthat is the music of the American Negro.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II we showed you what the Negro had brought from his native\r\nAfrica, and also that he had been influenced by his contact with the\r\nwhite race. His music is not the result of conscious art and of study\r\nbut is a natural outburst in which he expresses his joys and sorrows,\r\nhis tragedies and racial oppression. Also we find rhythms, melody and\r\nform that have grown as a wild flower grows, and are different from any\r\nwe have met heretofore.\r\n\r\nMr. Krehbiel in his book _Afro-American Folksongs_ says of the Negro\r\nslave songs: “They contain idioms which were transplanted hither from\r\nAfrica, but as song they are the product of American institutions; of\r\nthe social, political and geographical environment within which their\r\ncreators were placed in America, of the influences to which they were\r\nsubjected in America, of the joys, sorrows and experiences which fell to\r\ntheir lot in America.”\r\n\r\nThe Negro has cultivated, like all races, songs and dances. As we said\r\nof the Russian, his song is sad and full of tragedy, but the dance is\r\ngay, wild and primitive. From the dance of the Negro we borrowed the\r\nrhythm formerly called ragtime, which is now jazz. The principle of the\r\nNegro rhythm is syncopation, that is, the accent is shifted to the\r\nunaccented part of a measure or of a beat, like this,—♩♩♩, ♩♩♩, ♩♩♩. All\r\nsorts of combinations are possible in this rhythm, and it is this\r\nvariety that is fascinating in a good jazz tune.\r\n\r\nThe banjo is the instrument of the southern plantation Negro, and when a\r\ncrowd gathers for a “sing” or a dance, the hands and feet take the place\r\nof drums and keep time to the syncopated tune and is called, “patting\r\nJuba.”\r\n\r\nA curious dance was the “shout” which flourished in slave days. It took\r\nplace on Sunday or on prayer meeting nights and was accompanied by hymn\r\nsinging and shouting that sounded from a distance like a melancholy\r\nwail. After the meeting the benches were pushed back, old and young, men\r\nand women, stood in the middle of the floor and when the “sperichel” (or\r\nspiritual) was started they shuffled around in a ring. Sometimes the\r\ndancers sang the “sperichel” or they sang only the chorus, and for a\r\ndistance of half a mile from the praise house the endless thud, thud of\r\nthe feet was heard.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful Spiritual, the song of the Negro, we see also the\r\nsyncopated rhythm. The religious song is practically the only song he\r\nhas, and he sings it at work, at play, at prayer, when he is sick and\r\nhis friends sing it after he is dead. To our ears the words are crude\r\nand homely, but always reveal a fervent religious nature as well as a\r\nchildlike faith.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you have heard _Nobody Knows the Trouble I See_, _Deep River_,\r\n_Swing Low Sweet Chariot_, _Go Down Moses_, _Weeping Mary_ and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nSuch a wealth of feeling and beauty could not fail to leave its mark in\r\nthe land where it was born.\r\n\r\nJust how it will bear fruit we cannot say, but it is making its appeal\r\nmore and more, not only to the American, but to the foreign composers as\r\nwell, and they believe that this music,—the syncopated rhythm that the\r\nAmerican is at last developing in his own way—in spite of its humble\r\norigin, is the one new thing that America has given to the growth of\r\nmusic, and they envy us that wealth of rhythm that seems to be born in\r\nthe American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Music Becomes a Youth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n Makers of Motets and Madrigals—Rise of Schools 15th and 16th Centuries\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t you think it strange that we have not told you of any pieces\r\nwritten for the lute alone, or for the viol or any other instrument? The\r\nreason is that until 1700, there was little music for a solo instrument,\r\nbut only for voices alone or for voice and instrument together.\r\n\r\nThe main sport of composers of this time, was to take a popular tune and\r\nwrite music around it. The popular tune was called the _cantus firmus_\r\n(subject or fixed song) and the composer who did the fanciest things\r\nwith the tune was hailed as great. So instead of wanting to make up\r\ntunes as we do, they were anxious to see what they could do with old\r\ntunes. Times change, don’t they?\r\n\r\n“Like children who break their toys to see how they work, they learned\r\nto break up the musical phrases into little bits which they repeated,\r\nwhich they moved from one part to another; in this way the dividing of\r\nthemes (tunes) came, which led them to the use of imitation and of\r\ncanon; these early and innocent gardeners finally learned how to make\r\nthe trees of the enchanted garden of music bear fruit. Still timid, they\r\nkept the custom for three centuries of making all their pieces from\r\nparts of plain-song or of a popular song, instead of inventing subjects\r\nfor themselves; thus, what is prized today above every thing else—the\r\nmaking of original melodies—was secondary in the minds of the musicians,\r\nso busy were they trying to organize their art, so earnestly were they\r\ntrying to learn the use of their tools.” (Translated from the French\r\nfrom _Palestrina_, by Michel Brenet).\r\n\r\nBy spending their time this way, they added much to the science of\r\nmusic. If it was not pretty, at least it was full of interesting\r\ndiscoveries which composers used later, as we shall see, in fugues,\r\ncanons, suites and many other forms.\r\n\r\nThe most popular forms of composition during these two centuries (the\r\n15th and the 16th) were the motet for Church and the madrigal for\r\noutside the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WHAT A MOTET IS\r\n\r\nThe _motet_ probably gets its name from a kind of profane song (not\r\nsacred) that was called in Italian _mottetto_, and translated into\r\nFrench _bon mot_, means a jest. It dates back to the 13th century, and\r\nwas disliked by the Church. The first motets used in the Church in the\r\nearly 14th century are very crude to our ears, but interesting\r\nhistorically. The composers of the different schools of this period\r\nwrote many of them. Motets were usually those parts of the church ritual\r\nwhich depended on the day or season. They were not the regular unaltered\r\nparts like the mass itself.\r\n\r\nThis motet, or part-song, used as its central theme a tune already\r\nfamiliar to its hearers; this tune, the _cantus firmus_ was sometimes a\r\nbit from a Gregorian chant or from a mass, but more often it was a\r\nsnatch from a dance song or a folk song with very vulgar words, or it\r\nmay have been a troubadour love song with anything but the right kind of\r\nwords for the Church. The words for one part were often from the Bible\r\nand for other parts very coarse words from popular tunes. Imagine\r\nsinging them at the same time! Still funnier, the words of the sacred\r\nsong were sung in Latin and the popular song was sung in whatever\r\nlanguage it happened to be written! Can you think of anything more\r\nridiculous? The masses came to be known by the names from which the tune\r\nwas taken and nearly every composer including the great Palestrina wrote\r\nmasses on a popular tune of the day, _L’homme armé_ (The Man in Armor).\r\nYet they were all quite different, so varied had become the science of\r\nwriting counterpoint.\r\n\r\nJosquin des Près (1450–1521) the Flemish composer wrote a motet,\r\n_Victimae Paschali_, which is written around an old Gregorian\r\nplainchant, interwoven with two popular _rondelli_ (in French _roundel_\r\nfrom which comes our terms _roundelay_ and _rondo_) and a _Stabat Mater_\r\nof his. The _cantus firmus_, or subject of this motet is another secular\r\nor popular air.\r\n\r\nThe popular composers returned the compliment and took themes or tunes\r\nfrom church music and put secular words to them. History repeats itself,\r\nfor we today take a tune from Handel’s _Messiah_ and use it in _Yes, We\r\nHave No Bananas_ and we jazz the beautiful and noble music of Chopin,\r\nBeethoven, Schubert and many others.\r\n\r\nYet this music,—the child we are watching grow up—because of mixing up\r\nsacred and profane music soon gets a big reprimand.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of France seems to have been the birthplace of the\r\nmotet; a little later it found its way into Italy where some of the\r\nfinest music of the period was written, and the Italian influence\r\nreached into Spain in the middle of the 15th century; at the end of the\r\ncentury the Venetian school had spread its work into Germany. In the\r\n17th century the name _motet_ was given to a kind of composition between\r\na cantata and an oratorio, but it had nothing to do with the famous\r\nmotet of the 15th and 16th centuries which we are discussing.\r\n\r\nTo show you how clever the men were in these days, one composer wrote a\r\nmotet in thirty-six parts!\r\n\r\nIn the Library of the Sistine Chapel in Rome are volumes containing the\r\nmotets of the 14th century, copied, of course, by hand in notes large\r\nenough to be seen and read by the whole choir! These books are\r\nbeautifully decorated in gold and lovely colors, or illuminated, and are\r\nof great value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MADRIGALS OR POPULAR MOTETS\r\n\r\nAll music of this period not composed for the Church had the general\r\nname of Madrigal, but a real madrigal was a vocal composition for from\r\nthree to six parts written on a secular subject, which often gave to the\r\nwork a grace and lightness not in the motet. The vocal madrigals were to\r\nthe music lovers of that day what chamber music is today, for\r\ninstruments were not yet used without singing. Later, the lute played\r\nthe chief melody with the voice, and it was only a step to have other\r\ninstruments play the other parts of the madrigal. The instruments played\r\na section of the composition alone while waiting for a solo singer to\r\nappear. He sang a part of the madrigal that was later called the air and\r\nthe instrumental part was called the _ritournelle_, which literally\r\nmeant that in this section of the work, the singer returned from\r\n“off-stage” where he had awaited his turn. By the end of the 16th\r\ncentury it had become the custom for motets as well as madrigals to have\r\na solo air or aria, and an instrumental _ritournelle_, and this was the\r\nbeginning of chamber music,—a very great oak which grew from a very\r\nlittle acorn.\r\n\r\nIn the first printed music books are many of the madrigals of the early\r\nperiod. We will tell you of the composers of this period separately, but\r\nremember that they all wrote practically the same kind of music,—masses,\r\nmotets, and madrigals, but all with the subject borrowed from something\r\nthey knew and with many parts for the voices. Often, too, the same tunes\r\nwere used for Church and outside the Church. For this reason much music\r\nwas published without the words, so that the singers could use sacred or\r\nprofane words as they wished.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, it was the folk songs and ballads and not the\r\n_learned_ church music, that had originality and came freely and\r\nsincerely from the hearts of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SONGS IN DANCE FORM\r\n\r\nBecause these contrapuntal writings were heavy (can you imagine dancing\r\nto a canon?) a new kind influenced by folk music grew up among these\r\npeople who were naturally gay and jolly and wished to be entertained.\r\nSongs for three and four parts appeared, more popular in style and\r\nsimpler in form than the church motet and were the descendants of the\r\nmusic of the troubadours. These were in dance form, such as the French\r\n_chanson_, the _vilanelle_, the Italian _canzona_, _canzonetta_ or\r\nlittle canzona, _frottola_, _strambottes_ and the German _lied_. Many of\r\nthese songs in dance form later inspired composers to write music for\r\ninstruments alone, so that people danced to music without singing. These\r\ndance songs were called _branles_, _pavanes_, _gaillardes_, _courantes_,\r\n_forlanes_, _rigaudons_ _sarabandes_, _gigues_, _gavottes_ and many\r\nother names.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE LUTE\r\n\r\nThe favorite instrument of the 15th and 16th centuries was the lute. It\r\nfought for first place with the vielle, the viole, the harp, the\r\npsalterion and the portative organ, but won the fight and took its place\r\nbeside the most famous singers of the day, sometimes for accompanying\r\nand again reaching the dignity of soloist, as we told you above. In the\r\n15th century it took the form, which we see most often represented in\r\npictures and in museums, with its six strings, graceful round body, and\r\nlong neck bent back as you can see in plate opposite page 127 already\r\ndescribed. As time went on this lute was made larger and strings were\r\nadded until at the beginning of the 17th century, it was replaced by an\r\ninstrument called the arch-lute or theorbo, which had twenty-four\r\nstrings, a double neck, and two sets of tuning pins.\r\n\r\nThe spinets or virginals, the great-aunts of our pianofortes first came\r\ninto vogue in the 15th and 16th centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLATURE\r\n\r\nThere was a notation called Tablature used in the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies to write down the music for lute and other stringed\r\ninstruments such as the viol, cittern, theorbo. You will find, in\r\npictures of Tablature, lines which look like our staff, but they do not\r\nform a staff, but simply represent the _strings_ of the instrument.\r\nThese lines vary according to the number of strings, from four for the\r\ncittern to six for the lute. The notation showed, not the position and\r\nfingering as we write music, but the position and fingering of frets and\r\nstrings. Instead of _neumes_ or notes you will find the alphabet up to\r\nthe letter _j_, figures and queer dots and lines and slurs, but each\r\nsign had its own meaning and was important to the lutenist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RISE OF SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nAs music outgrows childhood, Schools of Music are started. But these are\r\nnot like the schools to which we go every day, but are rather music\r\ngroups or centers. Suppose you were a composer and lived in New York and\r\nknew a dozen or so musicians who were writing the same kind of music as\r\nyou; the music, if good enough to be known and played, would be called\r\nthe New York School, or it might be called the 1925 School! Or, if you\r\nwere important enough to be imitated by your followers, it would be\r\ncalled the Smith School, if that happened to be your name, just as those\r\nwho imitate Wagner are said to be the Wagner School, and so it goes. Not\r\na school to go to, but a school to belong to!\r\n\r\n“What makes these schools start?” we can hear you ask. Many things.\r\nSometimes people are oppressed by their rulers and in trying to forget\r\ntheir troubles, they naturally want to express themselves in the art\r\nthey know, and in this way groups get together and a school grows.\r\nSometimes the Church is the cause of schools of music, literature, and\r\nart, and we shall see in this chapter how the Church influenced the\r\nschools of music of this time and made it one of the most important\r\nperiods in this story. Sometimes, too, the climate has caused the\r\ndevelopment of different styles as we told you in the chapter on folk\r\nmusic. It often happens too, that a great man or a great school in one\r\ncountry affects other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FRANCO-FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe first real group of composers to be called a “School” lived in the\r\npart of Europe that today covers the north of France, Belgium and the\r\nNetherlands. The composers who were born from 1400 to about 1530, in the\r\nso-called Low Countries belonged to this school. Some writers claim that\r\nthere were three schools, and that the Franco-Flemish (Gallo-Belgic) is\r\na bridge between the Paris school of the 14th century and the\r\nNetherlands school of the 16th. But it would be impossible to say when\r\none school began and another ended, as they all wrote the same kind of\r\nmusic. As the older composers were the teachers of the younger, the\r\ninteresting thing to know is that many of these masters of the north of\r\nEurope went to Italy, Spain, France, and to Germany, and spread the\r\nknowledge of the “new art” of counterpoint and vocal poly-melody (many\r\nmelodies) and filled positions of importance in the churches. They were\r\nconsidered such splendid teachers, that many of the young students of\r\nother nationalities went to Holland and Belgium to be taught.\r\n\r\nZeelandia, a Hollander, an important master in this new school, tried to\r\nget rid of the awkward intervals, fourths and fifths, which were used in\r\norganum (see Chapter VII), and was the first composer to give the\r\nsubject or _cantus firmus_ to the soprano voice instead of the tenor.\r\nDoesn’t it seem strange that it took so long to let the soprano have the\r\nmain tune?\r\n\r\nBut the most important composer of his period (1400–1474) was Guillaume\r\nDufay, from Flanders, who was a chorister in the Papal choir (choir of\r\nthe Pope) in Rome. He made the rules and imitation for the canon (a\r\ngrown up round) and he was the first composer to use the folk song\r\n_L’homme armé_ (The Man in Armor) in a mass.\r\n\r\nThe next important name is Jan Okeghem (1430–1495), a Hollander, who\r\nimproved the science of counterpoint and of fugue writing. We have\r\nalready mentioned his canon for thirty-six voices (page 149), and he\r\nwrote some puzzle canons, for use in secret guilds. No one could solve\r\nthese without the key and they were much harder than the world’s best\r\ncross-word puzzles. He tried to make music express the beauty he felt,\r\nand not merely be mathematical problems in tone, as was much of the\r\nmusic of his day. He was the teacher of several famous musicians among\r\nwhom were Hobrecht (who became the teacher of Erasmus, the learned Dutch\r\nreligious reformer), Tinctoris, Josquin des Près, Loyset Compère, and\r\nAgricola who spent most of his life in Spain and Portugal. In fact,\r\nOkeghem taught so many, that the art of counterpoint was taken into all\r\ncountries by his pupils, so he can be called the founder of all music\r\nschools from his own day to the present. He was chaplain at the French\r\ncourt and, during forty years there, served three Kings of France!\r\n\r\nTinctoris, a Belgian (1446–1511), founded the first school of music in\r\nItaly at Naples, and wrote a dictionary of musical terms.\r\n\r\nBut the “Prince” of musicians of the 15th century, was Josquin des Près,\r\nor de Près (1455–1525). He was a pupil of Okeghem, and although born in\r\nFlanders, spent much of his life away from his home; he was a member of\r\nthe Papal choir in Rome and afterwards lived at the court of Louis XII\r\nin France. He also wrote a mass on the theme of _L’homme armé_, and many\r\nother masses, motets, and madrigals. Luther said of him,—“Josquin des\r\nPrès is a master of the notes. They do as he wills. Other composers must\r\ndo as the notes will. His compositions are joyous, gentle and lovely;\r\nnot forced, not constrained, nor slavishly tied to the rules, but free\r\nas the song of a finch.”\r\n\r\nJosquin des Près had many pupils, and among them were many who became\r\nfamous. Clement Janequin, or Jannequin, is one of the best known from\r\nhis music, and least known from the facts of his life. Most of his works\r\nare of a secular nature and are original and amusing, and so perfect\r\nthat some people thought him as good as his popular teacher. He was one\r\nof the first serious composers to imitate the sounds of Nature in music!\r\n\r\nOne of his famous madrigals is the _Chant des Oiseaux_ (Song of the\r\nBirds) in which he tries to represent the sounds of birds of all kinds.\r\nIn the middle of the piece is heard the hoot of an owl; the birds get\r\ntogether and chase away the poor hated owl, calling him a traitor, then\r\nall is quiet again. Another of his pieces is named _The Cackle of\r\nWomen!_ Another famous one still frequently sung is the _Battle of\r\nMarignan_ (1515), a lively piece in varied rhythm, which was one of the\r\nmost popular army songs of the 16th century. The words and music\r\nimitate, first the tools of war, then the noise of the cannons and the\r\ncrackling of the guns, the joy of victory for the French, and the\r\nretreat of the Swiss.\r\n\r\nAnother eminent pupil of Josquin des Près was Nicolas Gombert, of\r\nBruges. Like Jannequin, he was a Nature lover, and many of his madrigals\r\nimitate its sounds. Secular music was now popular, and his works show\r\nthat a composer was allowed to give expression to his feelings and\r\nideas, for the prejudices of the earlier church music had disappeared.\r\n\r\nJean Mouton, a native of Metz, was in the chapel of Louis XII and of\r\nFrançois I, King of France. His style was like his master’s and some of\r\nhis works were supposed to have been composed by Josquin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WILLAERT FOUNDS THE VENETIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\nWillaert was a pupil of both Josquin and Mouton. He was chapel master at\r\nSt. Mark’s in Venice, and was so famous as a teacher that he attracted\r\nmany good musicians, and became the founder of the famous Venetian\r\nschool of composers. He wrote many madrigals, some of them on verses of\r\nPetrarch, the Italian poet. This work was accomplished after he was\r\nsixty years old!\r\n\r\nWillaert was the first organist to use two and sometimes three choirs,\r\neach singing in four parts. Sometimes they sang in combination and\r\nsometimes answered each other antiphonally. According to Clarence G.\r\nHamilton in his book _Outlines of Music History_, the idea of these\r\nchoirs was probably suggested to Willaert because there were in St.\r\nMark’s two very fine organs. In this you see the influence instruments\r\nhave on the growth of musical compositions.\r\n\r\nWillaert made use too, of the idea that the different parts could be\r\nsounded together to form chords, instead of individual melodies as was\r\nthe case in poly-melody (polyphony or in the contrapuntal style). This\r\nwas a new idea, for up to this time the musicians had been writing\r\nhorizontal music, the melodic line looking something like this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S A T B]\r\n\r\nWillaert’s idea, which probably came from folk-song and from some of the\r\nhymns that Luther created, was colonnade-like (see Chapter VII) or\r\nperpendicular music, which we might illustrate like this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ||||||| or]\r\n\r\n                  ST. NICHOLAS TUNE BY ORLANDUS LASSUS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nin which each line represents a chord, with the melody at the top. This\r\nis how Harmony, or the science of chords, came into use as we know it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAmong Willaert’s pupils were Cyprian de Rore of Antwerp, who succeeded\r\nhis master at St. Mark’s, and most of his works were madrigals which\r\ngained him much fame in Italy. He was one of the first to use the\r\nchromatic scale (scale in semi-tones like black and white keys on the\r\npiano).\r\n\r\nAn Italian, Zarlino, pupil of Willaert, must be mentioned here, not as a\r\nwriter of music but as the author of three most important books on\r\nharmony and theory. These books seem to have been very much needed for\r\nthey were reprinted many times. Another Italian pupil of Willaert was\r\nAndrea Gabrieli, like his master, also an organist at St. Mark’s.\r\n\r\nThe greatest contribution from this Venetian school was its important\r\nuse of instrumental music as an independent art, thus giving music a\r\ngreat push forward.\r\n\r\nA composer whose motets and madrigals we still hear frequently is Jacob\r\nArcadelt, a Netherlander, who spent most of his life in Italy, and\r\nshared with Willaert the glory of being one of the founders of the\r\nVenetian school. He was a singer at the court of Florence, singing\r\nmaster to the choir boys at St. Peter’s in Rome, and then he became a\r\nmember of the Papal choir.\r\n\r\nThe life of Claude Goudimel seems, from the little we know, to have been\r\ndramatic. He is supposed to have been in Rome where he taught\r\nPalestrina, the greatest composer of the age. One writer says that he\r\nnever was in Rome and was not the teacher of Palestrina! Even his\r\nbirthplace is disputed. What is certain, however, is that he met his\r\ndeath in the massacre of the Huguenots (Protestants) at Lyons in 1572.\r\nHe wrote many settings of Calvinist Psalms by Clement Marot which work\r\nled to his being a victim of the massacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SWEELINCK FOUNDS 17TH CENTURY ORGAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\nOne of the last of the Netherland school was Jan Sweelinck (1562–1621),\r\nthe greatest organist of his time. He had so many pupils from every\r\ncountry in Europe, that he became the founder of a very famous school of\r\norganists. Among them were Scheidt, Reinken of whom the story is told\r\nthat Bach as a young boy walked miles to hear him play, and Buxtehude, a\r\nDane, who was one of the greatest of the time of Bach. Sweelinck\r\nperfected the Organ Fugue which Bach later made more beautiful than any\r\nother composer. Sweelinck’s talent and work were so deeply appreciated\r\nin his home, Amsterdam, that the merchants of that city gave him a\r\ngenerous income for his old age. A splendid thing to have done!\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GREAT LASSUS\r\n\r\nThe greatest composer of this Netherland school was Orlandus Lassus, or\r\nOrlando di Lasso, or Roland de Lattre, take your choice! He was born in\r\nMons, Belgium, some time between 1520 and 1532. When he was a child he\r\nhad such a beautiful voice that he was kidnapped three times from the\r\nschool where he lived with the other choristers. The third time he\r\nstayed with the Governor of Sicily, Ferdinand Gonzague, and went from\r\nSicily to Milan, then to Naples and then to Rome where he became\r\ndirector of the choir of one of the most celebrated churches. After this\r\nhe went to England and to France and finally returned to Antwerp. In\r\n1557 he was invited to the court of the Duke of Bavaria in Munich to\r\ndirect the chamber music. There he married a lady of the court and had\r\ntwo daughters and four sons, who were musicians. Later he was made\r\nmaster of the chapel, and the men who lived at that time said he was an\r\ninspiring choir director, a great composer, and was deeply reverenced\r\nand loved. The Duke was a splendid helper and patron of music, and\r\nencouraged him to make their choir of ninety men one of the finest in\r\nthe world. Their lives were made so pleasant that a book, published in\r\n1568, says, “had the Heavenly Choir been suddenly dismissed, it would\r\nstraightway have made for the court of Munich, there to find peace and\r\nretirement!”\r\n\r\nLassus used wind and brass instruments to accompany the voices which\r\nwere kept quite separate from the strings. At a banquet, the wind\r\ninstruments were heard during the early courses, then the strings\r\ndirected by someone else, then, during the dessert, Lassus would direct\r\nthe singing of the choir. So “chamber music” appears at this point in\r\nthe growth of music.\r\n\r\nAt the Duke’s suggestion, Lassus wrote music for seven _Penitential\r\nPsalms_ which were sung to the unhappy King, Charles IX, after the\r\nmassacre of the Huguenots on St. Bartholomew’s eve.\r\n\r\nHe wrote secular music as well as sacred and showed a keen sense of\r\nhumor in several of his secular pieces.\r\n\r\nSoon after 1574, he wrote a set of twenty-four pieces for two parts:\r\ntwelve have words and are vocal duets, and the other twelve are without\r\nwords, to be played on instruments. The two groups are exactly alike in\r\nform which shows that many of the motets and madrigals for voices were\r\noften played on instruments alone.\r\n\r\nThe Hymn to St. John from which Guido d’Arezzo took the names of the\r\nscale degrees, was made into a beautiful composition by Lassus; the\r\ntenor sings a _cantus firmus_ of the tones of the scales, around which\r\nare woven many parts in counterpoint.\r\n\r\nOne festival day there was a violent storm in Munich, and orders were\r\ngiven that the usual procession from the Church through the town should\r\nnot take place, but should be held inside the Church. As the head of the\r\nprocession reached the porch of the Church, and the choir started a\r\nmotet by Lassus, the sun suddenly came out and the procession went on as\r\nusual through the town. This was looked upon as a miracle, and whenever\r\nfine weather was wanted very much, this motet was chosen! This story\r\ndoes not tell whether the miracle always worked!\r\n\r\nIn Lassus’ later church music, he simplified the complicated\r\ncontrapuntal style, perhaps because he lived in the country where Luther\r\nhad introduced the chorale. (Page 166.) Even though Lassus wrote masses\r\nand motets for the Catholic Church, he must have heard these new hymns,\r\nand was unknowingly influenced by them.\r\n\r\nA complete edition of all his works would fill almost sixty volumes. If\r\nyou can realize the huge task all this must have been, you will not be\r\nsurprised that his over-tired brain finally gave out and during the last\r\nfive years of his life he did no more composing. He died in 1594.\r\n\r\nOrlandus Lassus was the last and one of the greatest of this Netherland,\r\nor Franco-Flemish school, that for two hundred years had led the world\r\nof music. Music had changed from a cocoon, gradually developing into a\r\nradiant butterfly, or, in our book, we should say that music had left\r\nchildhood and was becoming a stalwart lad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RONSARD—FRENCH POET\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of these northern madrigal writers, we must\r\ntell you about the famous French poet, Pierre de Ronsard, who was born\r\njust four hundred years ago (1525). He supplied more composers with\r\nwords for their madrigals than any other poet of his age, and he also\r\nsang some of his poems put to music. He said that without music poetry\r\nwas almost without grace, and that music without the melody of verse was\r\nlifeless. Of course, today the poetry and music have become so\r\nindependent of each other, that many poets object to having verse made a\r\nservant of music, and many musicians think that music without words,\r\nthat is, instrumental music, is the highest type of musical art.\r\n\r\nIn 1552, Ronsard asked four of the leading composers to set some of his\r\nsonnets to music. Jannequin, Pierre Certon, Claude Goudimel and Muret\r\naccepted, each composing music for the same ten sonnets. This experiment\r\nwas so successful, that it was the talk of the entire court, and Ronsard\r\npublished all the songs in his first volume of poetry. About the time\r\nthat Shakespeare was born, in England, but long before he had said,\r\n\r\n               The man that hath no music in his soul\r\n               Is fit for treason, stratagem and spoils,\r\n\r\nRonsard wrote a preface to a collection of songs dedicated to King\r\nCharles IX, in which he says: “How could one get along with a man who\r\ninnately hated music? He who does not honor music, is not worthy to see\r\nthe soft light of the sun.”\r\n\r\nBesides the four musicians who set the sonnets, others who used Ronsard\r\npoems as texts for songs and madrigals were Philip de Monte (or Mons),\r\nG. Costeley, organist to Charles IX, de la Grotte, organist to Henri\r\nIII, and Orlandus Lassus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n   Music Gets a Reprimand—Reformation and Rebirth of Learning—How the\r\n                           Reforms Came to Be\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a little reminder of how music grew:\r\n\r\nA scale came into use in Greece about 700 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt was separated into modes by the Greeks about 400 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt was adopted by the Romans and by the early Christians and was used\r\nuntil the 10th century A.D. with little change.\r\n\r\n450 years before the Christian era was the Golden Age of Pericles in\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n450 years after the Christian era was the beginning of the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nHarmony was first attempted in 900 A.D.\r\n\r\nBetween 900 A.D. and 1400, music made little headway.\r\n\r\nMusic has travelled along two roads,—the Church road and the People’s\r\nroad; they often crossed each other and became very much mixed up. You\r\nremember how popular songs had found their way into church music at the\r\ntime of St. Gregory, and how the people took melodies from the masses,\r\nput profane words to them, and sang them in the taverns, at the street\r\ncorners, in the tournaments and at work.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 15th century folk songs had again invaded the Church to the\r\npoint that masses were known by the names of the folk songs from which\r\nthey were taken. This led to a very important reform, as a result of\r\nwhich Palestrina, the greatest composer of the “Golden Age of Catholic\r\nChurch Music,” wrote his beautiful masses and motets, and Luther, the\r\nfounder of the Protestant faith, made up hymns that are still sung and\r\nloved throughout Christendom.\r\n\r\nMany things happened between 1400 and 1600, the period called the\r\nRenaissance, or rebirth of the ancient Greek and Roman learning. At this\r\ntime the people in Italy (later in Spain, France, England and Germany),\r\nawakened to study after the Dark Ages of war and conquest. Now the\r\npeople tried to bring back the literature, drama, music, and sculpture\r\nof the Greeks and Romans. Read this list of men whose genius developed\r\nthrough the new learning: Hans Memling, the Flemish painter; Albrecht\r\nDürer, the German painter and wood and copper engraver; Hans Holbein,\r\nthe German painter; Leonardo da Vinci, Italian artist, engineer and\r\nscientist, probably the most gifted man of all time; Michael Angelo, the\r\nItalian sculptor and poet; Raphael, Correggio and Titian, Italian\r\npainters; Cervantes, the Spanish dramatist, author of _Don Quixote_;\r\nEdmund Spenser of England, who wrote _The Faery Queen_; Copernicus, the\r\nastronomer and Christopher Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         INVENTION OF PRINTING\r\n\r\nBut the greatest event of this time was Gutenberg’s invention of\r\nprinting (1455) which has spread learning over the face of the earth.\r\nSoon people were able to get books cheaper than the hand written\r\nscrolls. Until this great moment the monks had been writing by hand all\r\nbooks and music scores. Only the great and wealthy owned them, and very\r\nfew could read or write, for what would be the sense of learning to read\r\nif one had nothing to read? So the invention of printing awakened the\r\ndesire to know how to read books and to learn poetry, which sharpened\r\npeople’s minds and enlightened them. 12,000 volumes were printed from\r\n1463 to 1471 where perhaps a hundred had been written before.\r\n\r\nThe first press (wooden type) was set up by Charles VII (1459) in the\r\nSorbonne in Paris, one of the greatest institutions of learning in the\r\nworld which still attracts students from all countries. The first music\r\nwas printed (1501 or 1502) by Ottaviano dei Petrucci in Venice, and were\r\nthree or four books of motets by Italian, French, Flemish and German\r\ncomposers. Music was benefited by being printed clearly and many changes\r\nwere made to make it easier to read. Up to this time it was worse than\r\ncross-word puzzles! It seemed to be the object of the composers before\r\nthe Renaissance to make music look just as difficult as it possibly\r\ncould, and there are many examples of enigmatical canons which were used\r\nin the spirit of games and could be solved only by those having the key\r\nto the puzzles.\r\n\r\nBut now the printers who were learned men in those days, simplified the\r\nnotation, and did away with many useless signs. People began to read it\r\nmore easily, and music became more popular. After Ottaviano died,\r\nAntonio Gardane and his sons founded a publishing house in Venice, which\r\nwas most useful to composers. Then Paris and Antwerp began to have fine\r\nprinters, and in 1542 Ballard was made sole printer of music to the King\r\nand nearly all the music through Louis XIV’s time (1638–1715) was\r\nprinted by his descendants. Late in the 17th century the measures were\r\nseparated by bars as they are today, and when metal was used for type\r\ninstead of wood, the old square note became oval like ours.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Renaissance Church music was again mixed with\r\nthe most vulgar words from popular songs. “The bowsprit got mixed with\r\nthe rudder sometimes”—as in _The Hunting of the Snark_.\r\n\r\nAt this time the people were beginning to think and read for themselves,\r\nand to question whether the Church had the right to dictate to and\r\ncontrol them as it had been doing. They thought, too, that many of the\r\nchurch officers were not good enough, and by degrees the people\r\nprotesting, broke away from the Roman Church and formed others. Through\r\nthis protest the Protestant church won its name; this is known as the\r\nReformation. With the new church came the need for new services, new\r\nmusic and new ways of singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MARTIN LUTHER, THE REFORMER\r\n\r\n“Truth to Nature” was the _slogan_ of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nIn 1453, the Mohammedans captured Constantinople, and the Christian\r\nChurch which had been there since the end of the 4th century, was driven\r\nout. Many of the learned Christians fled to Central Europe and brought\r\nwith them a knowledge of Greek literature and art which they taught to\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nChristopher Columbus, in his search for a passage to India, found a new\r\ncontinent, and in the same way these seekers for “Truth to Nature,”\r\nalthough they may not have found exactly what they were looking for,\r\ncertainly opened gates that swept men and women towards knowledge,\r\nappreciation, refinement and culture.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding person in the Reformation of the Church was Martin\r\nLuther (1483–1546) who interests us specially for what he did for the\r\ngrowth of music. Luther was a priest of the Catholic Church, but he was\r\nalso a German; he believed in a national life free from Church\r\ngovernment, and in singing hymns in the language of the people instead\r\nof in Latin, in order that the words could be understood. He spoke and\r\nwrote openly against certain actions of the Church and for this he was\r\nput out of the Church of Rome. But, very soon, he had enough followers\r\nto start a church of his own, and one of the first things he did was to\r\nmake a new music for it. Up to this time the only music in Germany had\r\nbeen some hymns translated from the Latin into the “vernacular,” the\r\nlanguage of the people, the songs of the Minnesingers and\r\nMeistersingers, and a rich crop of folksongs that had appeared in the\r\n14th century. There were also a few composers who had learned to write\r\ncounterpoint in the Netherlands, Heinrich Isaak, Ludwig Senfl and\r\nHeinrich Fink, and they, too, influenced the music of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nLuther, a musician himself, knew the love that his countrymen had for\r\ntheir hymns translated into German and for the folksongs, and realized\r\nthat singing in which the congregation took part would be a power in the\r\nchurch. He had to gather material for new hymns simple enough for the\r\npeople to sing, and besides he needed new music to replace the Mass. The\r\nresult of his work is the _chorale_, the foundation of the great German\r\nschool of music of the 18th and 19th centuries. He was helped in the\r\nwork of creating these hymns by Johann Walther and Conrad Rupf. The\r\nfirst hymnal (1524) was selected from some of the finest Catholic hymns,\r\nGregorian and Ambrosian melodies, dignified folk-melodies, and some\r\noriginal chorales by Luther himself.\r\n\r\nHe played the tunes of his chorales on a flute, and Walther wrote them\r\ndown. He wrote to a friend, “I wish after the example of the Prophets\r\nand ancient Fathers of the Church, to make German Psalms for the people,\r\nand that is to say, sacred hymns, so that the word of God may dwell\r\namong the people by means of song also.” The strength and beauty of\r\nthese hymns can be seen in _Ein’ Feste Burg ist unser Gott_ (A Mighty\r\nFortress is Our God).\r\n\r\nThe hymns were harmonized in four parts. They were usually sung in\r\nunison (all singing the same thing) with the accompaniment of the organ\r\nor a group of instruments. This great change, or revolt, broke the\r\nbackbone of polyphonic music, freed the spirit of the people, and first\r\nbrought into use modern scales (major and minor, as we know them).\r\nCuriously enough, this Reformed Church Music also brought about the\r\n“Golden Age of Catholic Music” with Palestrina as its leading composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PALESTRINA—PRINCE OF MUSIC\r\n\r\nMartin Luther had hoped to reform the Church but instead founded a new\r\none (another example of Columbus seeking a passage to India). But this\r\naction of Luther’s was a challenge to the Mother-Church, and steps were\r\ntaken to reform many customs and practices in the Church itself. As we\r\nhave pointed out many times, popular tunes with vulgar words had crept\r\ninto the Church services. These works composed for the Church were used\r\nto show the skill of the composer rather than to express the love of\r\nGod. Questions dealing with the reforms for purifying the services of\r\nthe Church were taken up by the Council of Trent, a gathering of the\r\nlearned Church men and the Catholic kings. The council lasted for twenty\r\nyears (1542 or 3–1562). Fancy that for a club meeting! Towards the end\r\nof its long session, the council decided that all music in the “impure\r\nmode” (in popular style), should be banished from the Church. They\r\ndecided, and we cannot see why they waited so long, that the Mass with\r\npopular airs and words not approved by the Church fathers should be\r\nprohibited. Palestrina had both the genius and the understanding to meet\r\nthe requirements, and his compositions for the Church are the highest\r\nachievement of the 16th century.\r\n\r\nYou will read in many histories of music that Palestrina was asked to\r\nwrite three masses to be sung before a group of Cardinals, in order to\r\nfind out whether or not any composer could write music fit for the\r\nChurch. These three masses were considered so fine, that he was claimed\r\nas the one who saved Church music. This would have been a great honor,\r\nbut it did not happen, and was only a legend to show Palestrina’s\r\ngreatness. No doubt Palestrina wrote more carefully and beautifully on\r\naccount of the decision of the Council of Trent, and was so great a\r\ncomposer that all vocal polyphonic music of the 16th century is said to\r\nbe in the “Palestrinian” style.\r\n\r\nNow this Palestrina was Giovanni Pierluigi, born in a humble home at\r\nPalestrina, a suburb of Rome. In English his name would be John\r\nPierluigi of Palestrina. The year of his birth was about 1525 or 1526.\r\nHe probably was a choir boy and was trained in music in one of the\r\nchurches of Rome. You may hear that the Chapel master of Santa Marie\r\nMaggiore heard him singing on the road and picked him out for his music\r\nschool, but this may be only one of many legends told of him. Even the\r\nname of his teacher is uncertain, some say that it was Goudimel, others\r\nthat it was Gaudio or Claudio Mell, and still others that it was\r\nCimello. However, his teacher’s name seems to have had the letters “mel”\r\nin it, and all the rest is guess work. Before he was twenty, he played\r\nthe organ in a church at Palestrina, sang in the daily service, taught\r\nsinging and music, and shortly after was married.\r\n\r\nIn 1551 he became chapel master in the Capella Giulia (Julia Chapel) in\r\nthe Vatican. His first published volume of five masses (1554) he\r\ndedicated to the Pope, Julius III. There had been many volumes of sacred\r\nmusic dedicated to the popes, but they had always been the work of\r\nmusicians of the northern school, Hollanders or Belgians. This volume of\r\nPalestrina’s was the first by an Italian composer to be written for a\r\npope. As a reward, the Pope made him one of the twenty-four singers of\r\nhis private chapel, but not having a good voice, and not being a priest,\r\nthe next Pope dismissed him. But in 1571 he was again made chapel master\r\nin the Vatican.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in those days for musicians to dedicate works not only\r\nto popes, but to rich and powerful nobles, monarchs, or other church\r\nofficials. These attentions were often rewarded with gifts of money,\r\npositions at court or in the chapels. This “patronage,” as it was\r\ncalled, made it possible for composers to do their best work. This was\r\nnot only the case in music, but in poetry, painting and sculpture.\r\nPalestrina was kept busy dedicating his music to popes, for he lived\r\nduring the reigns of at least twelve.\r\n\r\nAfter the Council of Trent, one of his masses was recommended as a\r\nmodel, so it is said, of what church music should be. He was again\r\ngranted the pay of singer in the Pontifical Choir, as he had been years\r\nbefore, but this time, due to his well-known skill, he did not lose his\r\npost when other popes succeeded in office. Many of his masses in\r\nmanuscript are now in the Vatican library.\r\n\r\nIn 1575, fifteen hundred singers from Palestrina,—priests, laymen, boys\r\nand women, marched into Rome singing Giovanni Pierluigi’s music, with\r\nthe great composer leading them. This shows, that he was appreciated.\r\n\r\nHe was asked to revise some of the old church music and while he tried,\r\nhe so hated to change the work of other composers whom he respected,\r\nthat he never finished the task. It was like asking Stravinsky to put\r\nup-to-date harmonies into Beethoven.\r\n\r\nA list of his compositions published by Breitkopf and Haertel include 93\r\nMasses, 179 Motets, and 45 Hymns for the year, 68 Offertories, 3 books\r\nof Lamentations, 3 books of Litanies, 2 books of Magnificats, 4 books of\r\nMadrigals. A big list, isn’t it? But his activities covered a long\r\nperiod, and he composed to the time of his death (1594).\r\n\r\nHe had very few pupils whose names have come down to us.\r\n\r\nPalestrina never had great wealth, and some biographers make him seem\r\npoverty-stricken and suffering. At any rate, he was granted his heart’s\r\ndesire, to compose as much as he wanted to, and even if he was poor, he\r\nhad the joy of success and the glory of being recognized as the greatest\r\ncomposer of his time in Italy. His works have outlived many other\r\nschools of composition, and today are looked upon as models of beauty\r\nand of masterly workmanship.\r\n\r\nPalestrina was honored by burial in St. Peter’s, and on his tombstone\r\nare the words “Princeps Musicæ” (Prince of Music).\r\n\r\nYou must not think that Palestrina was the only famous Italian composer\r\nof the 16th century, for Constanza Festa who died before Palestrina did\r\nhis important work is called the first Italian master of the polyphonic\r\nschool. There were also Animuccia, Andrea Gabrieli, and Andrea’s nephew\r\nGiovanni Gabrieli. Giovanni was a Venetian, and the Venetians loved rich\r\ncoloring in everything, even in their music. Gabrieli tried to get it by\r\nusing cornets, trombones and violins with the organ, which at that time\r\ncould not make a _crescendo_, that is, its volume could not be\r\nincreased, but as these instruments could all be played soft or loud\r\nwith _crescendo_ effects, he created a color or quality that never had\r\nbeen before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n         Birth of Oratorio and Opera—Monteverde and Heart Music\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BIRTH OF ORATORIO AND OPERA\r\n\r\nA friend of Palestrina, Saint Filippo Neri, was the founder of Oratorio.\r\nIn 1558, Father Neri started daily religious meetings to which all sorts\r\nof people came. These were held in a side room of the Church called the\r\nOratory (chapel for private prayer), and in addition to his\r\ntalks,—hymns, litanies and motets were sung, and scenes from the Bible\r\nwere performed somewhat like opera. The name “Oratorio” was soon used,\r\nnot only in Rome, but throughout all of Europe, wherever there were\r\nsacred dramas with music. Palestrina arranged and wrote some of the\r\nmusic for Father Neri.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BIBLE STORIES ACTED\r\n\r\nThe acted stories of the Bible can be traced back into the Middle Ages,\r\nand probably descended from the Greek and Roman theatre, for many early\r\nChristians were Greeks and Romans and had a natural love for drama. The\r\nChurch understood this and saw in it a way to teach the history of the\r\nScriptures. You know yourselves how much better you remember historical\r\nevents when you have seen them in moving pictures! This natural love of\r\nplay-acting in mankind goes back to primitive man who acted out his\r\nprayers in his religious rites. These theatrical performances were\r\ncalled “moralities,” “mysteries,” or “miracle-plays,” and a very\r\nbeautiful example is _Everyman_, which was revived in England and\r\nAmerica a few years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the 8th century, Charlemagne’s time, people gathered in the public\r\nmarkets, and the merchants entertained them by shows in which were\r\nsinging and dancing. The priests forbade these performances because they\r\nwere coarse and vulgar, but realizing how successful and how much loved\r\nthey were, they themselves turned actors, built stages in many of the\r\nchurches, turned the Bible stories into little plays, and added music.\r\nSometimes when there were not enough priests to take part, dolls or\r\npuppets were used as in _Punch and Judy_ shows. Isn’t it interesting to\r\nthink that operas and plays began in the Church?\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous of the church plays was the _Feast of Asses_ in\r\nthe 11th century.\r\n\r\nThe people did not have means of entertaining themselves as we have, and\r\nthe Church was the place to which every one went for amusement as well\r\nas religion. In the 14th century some plays given in England were: _Fall\r\nof Lucifer_, _Creation_, _Deluge_, _Abraham_, _Salutation and Nativity_,\r\n_Three Kings_, _Last Supper_, _Resurrection_. The clergy hired minstrels\r\nduring this period to supply the music.\r\n\r\nIn the 15th century there were also elaborate pageants.\r\n\r\nThe clergy soon saw that the people wanted to take part in the plays, so\r\nsocieties were formed in Paris, Rome, and in England for the people. In\r\nEngland, like in Germany in the 16th century, the guilds (trade-unions)\r\nperformed plays that were based on religious subjects, although more or\r\nless comic. The trade-guild of water-drawers, who delivered water from\r\ndoor to door, liked to give the _Deluge_! The story goes: Mrs. Noah\r\nobjected to going aboard the ark with her husband and children, because\r\nshe did not want to leave her friends, “the gossips”; she even tells\r\nNoah to get himself another wife, but her son, Shem, forces her into the\r\nark, and when she finally enters, she slaps Noah’s face!\r\n\r\nThe subjects were not always comical, some were beautiful and inspiring,\r\nlike the _Passion Play_ still given in Oberammergau, Germany, every ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MASQUES\r\n\r\nDuring Henry VII’s reign (1485–1509), which began the Tudor period, the\r\nmoralities and religious pageantry were at their best, and the Masques\r\nbegan. Nobles, who appeared at balls in gorgeous costumes with masked\r\nfaces, danced, had a jolly time, and usually surprised the guests with\r\nan elaborate entertainment in pantomime with much music and dancing.\r\nThis became more and more important until it combined poetry,\r\ninstrumental and vocal music, scenery, dancing, machinery, splendid\r\ncostumes, and decorations in the Masque.\r\n\r\nThe greatest masques were written in the reigns of the Stuarts (17th\r\ncentury), by Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and John Milton. _Comus_\r\nand Shakespeare’s _Tempest_ were set to music in this form. While the\r\nItalians were experimenting with _Dramma per Musica_ (drama with music),\r\nEngland was finding a new musical entertainment in the masque, and opera\r\nwas its direct descendant.\r\n\r\nThe custom of masking for the ball came from Italy, and before that, the\r\nactors in the Greek drama (400 B.C.) wore masks, and that is why the\r\nmask is used in art to represent the theatre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ITALIAN OPERA’S BEGINNINGS\r\n\r\nIn Italy during the second half of the 16th century, a group of people\r\ntried to combine music and drama to fit the new ideas of art. The\r\nRenaissance had influenced poetry, sculpture, painting, architecture,\r\nand now it was music’s turn to profit by the return to Greek ideals. The\r\nFlorentines and the Venetians felt that the madrigal was not the best\r\nform to express the feelings and emotions of the subjects of their\r\nplays. In the Middle Ages, the subjects were always Biblical, but now,\r\nas a result of the new learning they were chosen from Greek mythology\r\nand history. From the first operas at the close of the 16th century, to\r\nthose of Gluck in the 18th, the names of Greek gods and heroes are used\r\nas the titles of operas: _Orpheus_, _Euridice_, _Daphne_, _Apollo_ and\r\n_Bacchus_. These first operas were a combination of early _ballets_, and\r\na sort of play called a _pastorale_.\r\n\r\nTorquato Tasso, the Italian poet of the 16th century, wrote several\r\n_pastorales_, and was interested in music with drama. Like Ronsard in\r\nFrance, Tasso wrote beautiful poems for madrigals, which were set to\r\nmusic by the composers. He was a friend of Palestrina and of Don\r\nGesualdo, Prince of Venosa, a famous patron of art, particularly of\r\nmusic. In the Prince’s palace at Naples, a group of men met to spread\r\nand improve the taste for music. They also wished to create music that\r\nwould fit the stage-plays better than the polyphonic or poly-melodic\r\nstyle imported from the Northern countries. They wanted melody and they\r\nwanted it sung by one voice alone, as were their popular songs,\r\naccompanied by the lute, called _frottoli_, _vilanelles_, etc. Tasso, no\r\ndoubt, talked over his ideas with composers from Florence who had formed\r\na club, and who were directly responsible for the first opera in Italy,\r\n_Daphne_ by Jacobo Perti.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE CAMERATA\r\n\r\nThis Florentine club was called the “Camerata”; it met at the home of\r\nCount Bardi, himself a poet, and among its members were Vincenzo\r\nGalilei, an amateur musician and father of the famous astronomer; Emilio\r\ndel Cavalieri, a composer and inventor of _ballets_; Laura Guidiccioni,\r\na woman poet; Giulio Caccini, a singer and composer; Ottavio Rinuccini\r\nand Strozzi, poets; and Peri, a composer and singer. They must have had\r\nwild times at their club meetings, for the musicians who were not\r\namateurs did not want the popular song with lute accompaniment to\r\nreplace polyphonic music, which was the “high-brow” art of that time.\r\nBut the poets and singers and less cultured musicians won the day.\r\nPretending to return to Greek music drama of which they knew less than\r\nnothing, they made a series of experiments which led to the invention of\r\nthe artsong, or homophonic style (one voice, or melody, instead of\r\npolyphonic—many voices), which seemed to satisfy the Italian’s natural\r\nlove for melody.\r\n\r\nGalilei set a scene from Dante’s _Inferno_, for solo and _viola da\r\ngamba_, an instrument of the violoncello type. Following this, Peri\r\ninvented the “speaking style” of singing now called _recitative_. This\r\nwas a very important step in the making of opera and oratorio, for it\r\ndid away with spoken words, and instead, the conversation was sung, or\r\nintoned, to satisfy the poets who wanted the meaning of their words made\r\nvery clear. It was accompanied by simple chords on the lute, and later,\r\nthe harpsichord.\r\n\r\nHere were all the parts needed for a real opera,—the solo song, or aria;\r\nthe recitative, or story telling part; the chorus or ensemble, which was\r\nthe old madrigal used in a new way; and the accompanying instruments\r\nwhich grew into the orchestra. Peri was the first to put all these parts\r\ntogether in an opera for which Rinuccini wrote a real play based on the\r\nGreek story of Daphne. Caccini and his daughter Francesca sang it, and\r\nno doubt made many suggestions as to how it should be done. Its first\r\nprivate performance (1597) was an important event for the closing of an\r\nimportant century. The audience thought that it was listening to a\r\nrevival of Greek music drama, but we know that it was another case of\r\nColumbus’s passage to India! Although the Greek drama was not like this,\r\nafter 2000 years it helped to create modern music.\r\n\r\nIts success led to an invitation in 1600 for Peri and Rinuccini to write\r\nan opera, _Euridice_, for the marriage festivities of Henry IV of France\r\nand Marie de’ Medici. Several noblemen, probably members of the\r\n“Camerata,” took part in the first performance; one played the\r\nharpsichord, and three others played on the chitarrone (a large guitar),\r\na viol da gamba, and a theorbo (double lute). The orchestra was\r\ncompleted by three flutes. This orchestral score was notated in a sort\r\nof musical shorthand called figured bass which shows the chords to be\r\nused as accompaniment to a melody by means of a bass note with a figure\r\nabove it. Peri and his colleagues seem to have been the first to use\r\nthis, but it was adopted by all composers into the 18th century,\r\nincluding Bach and Handel. It was called _basso continuo_ or figured\r\nbass or thorough-bass.\r\n\r\nCaccini also wrote an opera which he called _Euridice_, but it was in\r\nthe style of a pastoral ballet with songs, dances, and recitatives. This\r\nwork was probably the result of his having helped Peri in working out\r\nhis ideas at the meetings of the “Camerata.” This same year, 1600, which\r\nfinished the 16th century, saw the presentation of Emilio del\r\nCavalieri’s mystery play, or oratorio, _La Rappresentazióne di ‘Anima e\r\ndi Córpo_ (Representation of the spirit and body), for which Laura\r\nGiudiccioni wrote the text. This oratorio, with very elaborate\r\ndecorations, was sung and danced in the oratory of a church. It must\r\nhave been very like the operas except that it was based on a religious\r\nidea, and was performed in a church, while the opera by Peri was\r\nperformed at the Pitti Palace and was from Greek mythology. The\r\norchestra was composed of a double lyre, a harpsichord, a double guitar,\r\nand a theorbo or double lute.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BAIF’S CLUB IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nWhile the Italians were trying to find the old Greek and Latin methods\r\nof combining drama and music, there was a movement in France to write\r\npoetry in classical verse. Following Ronsard’s example, Baif influenced\r\nthe composers to write music that should express the feeling of poetry,\r\nand also imitate its rhythm. They also tried writing madrigals arranged\r\nfor a single voice with accompanying instrument, or group of\r\ninstruments. While the Italians invented the recitative, the French\r\ndeveloped a rich fluent rhythmic song form, _musique mesurée à\r\nl’antique_, or, music in the ancient metre.\r\n\r\nBaif formed a club or an Academy of poets and musicians much like\r\nBardi’s “Camerata” in Florence. They worked hard to perfect mensural or\r\nmeasured music, and opened the way for the use of measures and bars,\r\nwhich in the 16th century were unknown. We are so accustomed to music\r\ndivided into measures by means of bars, that it is hard to realize what\r\na great step forward was made by Baif’s Academy. They were struggling to\r\nget rid of the plainchant which lacked rhythm as we know it, and which\r\nfor centuries had used “perfect” or “imperfect” time.\r\n\r\nTwo prominent composers of this group were Jacques Mauduit (1557–1627),\r\nalso a famous lute player, and Claude Le Jeune (1530–1600), who worked\r\nwith Baif to bring “measured” music into favor, composer of many\r\n_chansons_ and of a Psalm-book used by all the Calvinist churches\r\n(Calvin was a church reformer in Switzerland) in Europe except in\r\nSwitzerland! It went through more editions than any other musical work\r\nsince the invention of printing. Le Jeune was a Huguenot, and on St.\r\nBartholomew’s eve (1588), he tried to escape from the Catholic soldiers\r\ncarrying with him many unpublished manuscripts. They would have been\r\nburned, had it not been for his Catholic friend and fellow-composer,\r\nMauduit, who rescued the books, and saved his life. The title appears\r\nfor the first time in history on one of his pieces, “Composer of Music\r\nfor the King.” (_Compositeur de la musique de la chambre du roy._)\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, in spite of serious\r\npolitical and religious troubles, the most popular form of entertainment\r\nat the French court was the very gorgeous ballet. No expense was\r\nconsidered too great, and no decoration too splendid for these ballets\r\nin which nobles and even the kings and their families appeared “in\r\nperson.” They were like the English Masques, and were the parents of the\r\n_French opera_. Baif, Mauduit and Le Jeune, together composed (1581) _Le\r\nBallet comique de la Reine_ (Queen’s Comedy-Ballet) which was produced\r\nat the Palace of the Louvre in Paris.\r\n\r\nBeaulieu and Salmon are often named as the composers of this ballet\r\nbecause in those days, one composer wrote the parts for voices, and\r\nanother for instruments, so probably the musicians worked with the poets\r\nand dramatists to produce it. The characters in this musical drama were\r\nCirce and other Greek gods and demi-gods.\r\n\r\nWith Marie de Medici and Cardinal Mazarin from Italy, Italian opera came\r\ninto France. But this did not happen until the 17th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MONTEVERDE AND HEART MUSIC\r\n\r\nWouldn’t you be proud if you could compose a whole book of music at the\r\nage of sixteen? Monteverde did and besides he made music grow by\r\ncomposing things that had never been done before.\r\n\r\nClaudio Monteverde (1567–1643) was born in Cremona, a town made famous\r\nby the great makers of violins. Monteverde was one of the first great\r\ninnovators in music, and he brought new ideas and vast changes into\r\nmusic as an art. His teacher, Marc Antonio Ingegneri, Chapel Master at\r\nthe Cathedral, taught young Monteverde all the tricks of counterpoint\r\nand of the great polyphonic masters, and also gave him lessons on the\r\norgan and the viol. He must have been a very talented pupil, for he\r\ncould play any instrument, and at the age of sixteen, published his\r\nfirst book of madrigals,—_Canzonette a tre voci_ (Little Songs in Three\r\nVoices). The last song in this book has these charming words: “Now, dear\r\nSongs, go in peace singing joyously, always thanking those who listen to\r\nyou and kissing their hands, without speaking.” Evidently, little\r\nItalian boys were brought up to say nice things!\r\n\r\nEven in this first book of madrigals and the four books that followed,\r\nMonteverde tried experiments in harmony and wrote music that sounded\r\nharsh to 16th century ears. He was trying to create a style that would\r\ncombine the best points of the old school of polyphony (many voices)\r\nwith the new school of monody (one melody), and this is why he is called\r\nthe originator of the modern style of composition, which is, melody and\r\naccompaniment. Since his time there have been many originators of new\r\nstyles in music, and when first heard they have usually been received\r\nwith harsh words by the many and liked by the few. Monteverde was\r\nseverely criticized in a book that appeared in Venice, in 1600, on the\r\nshort-comings of modern music, (and they are still writing “on the\r\nshort-comings of modern music” today!). The book was written by the\r\nmonk, Artusi, who liked the old-fashioned music and believed that\r\nMonteverde’s work was against all natural musical laws. But if we search\r\nwe will find that music grows through experiments that are made by the\r\ncomposers, who “go against natural laws,” then after the natural laws\r\nare broken, comes a learned theorist who shows that no law was broken at\r\nall, and so we go on stretching the boundaries of “natural law,” and\r\nmusic goes on changing all the time. This is what we mean by the growth\r\nof music.\r\n\r\nIn 1590, Monteverde became viol player and singer to Vincenzo di\r\nGonzaga, Duke of Mantua, a patron of arts and letters. At one time he\r\ntook the poet Tasso from an insane asylum; he was patron of Galileo, the\r\nastronomer, who was considered to be a heretic because he said that the\r\nearth revolved around the sun, contrary to the teachings of the Bible;\r\nhe also invited the great Flemish painter Rubens, to visit his court;\r\nand probably influenced Monteverde to write operas. The Duke engaged\r\nmany musicians at his court, who formed a little orchestra to play dance\r\nmusic, solos, or parts in the madrigals. These were no longer sung\r\nalone, but were accompanied by instruments, or sometimes played by the\r\ninstruments without voices, (see how music grows up!) because in Italy,\r\nthe composers had not yet begun to write special music for instruments\r\nas they had in France.\r\n\r\nThe composer went with the Duke on many travels, even into battle, and\r\nin the evenings between military encounters, they sang madrigals and\r\nplayed on instruments!\r\n\r\nThe next trip with the Duke was pleasanter, for it gave Monteverde the\r\nchance to visit Flanders, where he heard the beautiful “new music” of\r\nClaude Le Jeune, Mauduit, and others. It impressed him so deeply that he\r\nbegan to write heart-music instead of head-music. He was one of the most\r\nsuccessful in breaking down old rules and traditions and was enough of a\r\ngenius to replace them with new things that were to point the way for\r\nall the opera writers and most of the composers that came after him.\r\n\r\nMonteverde must have heard the music composed by the members of the\r\n“Camerata,” but he was too much of a musician to brush aside all\r\npolyphonic writing and to value words above music. However, their work\r\nopened the way for his. Up to 1607, he had written everything in the\r\nform of vocal madrigals, but his last book seems to have been composed\r\nfor string instruments instead of being madrigals for voices. These\r\nsounded as though composed for viols and lutes and not for voices, and\r\nwere dramatic and full of deep feeling as if written for an opera! No\r\nwonder they sounded strange to the audience—even as Stravinsky,\r\nSchoenberg and Milhaud do to most people today.\r\n\r\nUntil Monteverde was forty years old he had never written an opera, the\r\ngreatest work of his life! He probably would not have done so then had\r\nit not been at the command of his patron, Vincenzo di Gonzaga. His first\r\nand second operas, _Orfeo_ and _Arianna_, followed each other quickly\r\nand were epoch making. Without the work of the “Camerata,” they might\r\nnever have been written, but they were much better than the best work of\r\nthe “Camerata” (Peri, Caccini, and Cavalieri). Monteverde was wise\r\nenough to adopt their melodramatic form which he improved by his use of\r\nthe devices of the Italian madrigalists and organ composers, and the\r\n_airs de cour_ (songs of the court) and the ballets of the French\r\ncomposers.\r\n\r\nAlso, following the French ideas, Monteverde used a large orchestra of\r\nforty pieces, including two clavichords; two little organs called\r\n_organi di legno_, which sounded like flutes; a regal, also a kind of\r\nsmall organ; a bass viol; a _viol da gamba_; two very tiny violins\r\ncalled _pochettes_, because they could be carried in the pockets of the\r\nFrench dancing-masters; ten _violes da bracchia_ or tenor viols;\r\nordinary violins, two _chitarroni_ or large lutes, and the usual\r\ntrumpets, cornets, flutes and oboes. In this Monteverde was a pioneer\r\nfor he had no other works to guide him, and had to find out for himself\r\nthe effects of combining different instruments. Today many of his\r\nmusical effects sound crude to us, but he had no symphony concerts, at\r\nwhich to hear an orchestra, for such a thing did not exist. Neither were\r\norchestral scores written out, but only indicated, and when instruments\r\nwere used, their parts were made up at the moment and played, according\r\nto the “figured bass.”\r\n\r\nDuring the 16th century, the musicians had learned that trombones and\r\ncornets made a wonderful effect in scenes of the underworld (Hades,\r\nInferno, Hell), of which there were many. They discovered, too, that\r\ntrumpets and drums made battle scenes and war songs real; that flutes,\r\noboes and bassoons gave a pastoral, or shepherd-like effect; that viols\r\nwere for scenes of love and of sadness; and that to represent Heaven,\r\nthey needed harps, lutes and regals. Monteverde brought them all\r\ntogether, and studied how to simplify the orchestra to give it a better\r\nbalance in tone and variety. It must have been a wonderful time to live\r\nin this “young manhood” day of music.\r\n\r\nThe opera _Arianna_ was written a year after _Orfeo_, to celebrate the\r\nwedding of the Duke’s son. It must have been a sad task for Monteverde,\r\nas he had just lost his wife to whom he was very devoted. Ottavio\r\nRinuccini, poet of the “Camerata”, was his librettist (the writer of the\r\nwords), and a famous Italian architect, Vianini, built an immense\r\ntheatre in the castle for the first performance in 1608. Six thousand\r\npeople assembled, the largest audience that had ever heard an opera!\r\nNothing remains of the opera today, but the text, or words, some\r\npublished accounts of the performances, and a very touching and\r\nbeautiful _Lamentation_ in which Arianna expresses her grief at being\r\nleft by Theseus. This one piece is enough to show Monteverde’s genius,\r\nalso how freely he expressed human feelings in music. Not a house in\r\nItaly with either a clavichord or a theorbo was without a copy of the\r\n_Lamentation_!\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Monteverde wrote a prologue for a comedy composed by\r\nfive other musicians of the court, all well-known composers of their\r\nday, Rossi, Gastoldi, Gagliano, Giulio Monteverde, and Birt.\r\n\r\nIn 1613, a year after the death of the Duke, Vincenzo di Gonzaga,\r\nMonteverde was made Chapel master of St. Mark’s in Venice, which had\r\nlong been famous for its fine music, where Adrian Willaert, Cyprian de\r\nRore and Zarlino had been Chapel masters in the time of the “Golden Age\r\nof Polyphony.” Monteverde had much to live up to! But, after his hard\r\nwork at the court of Mantua, he found his position very agreeable, and\r\nhe gave his time now to composing music for the Church, madrigals,\r\nintermezzos, and a new form of music called “cantata.” His church music\r\ncan be divided into works written in the old polyphonic style of\r\nPalestrina, and those written in the modern style of his day. So, when\r\nhe did not write in the older church style, it was not because he did\r\nnot know counterpoint, but because he wanted to make music express\r\nfeelings through harmony and not through polyphony. He was able to do\r\nthis as no one else had! His church music is not published for the parts\r\nhave been so scattered, that a bass will be found in one collection and\r\nan instrumental part in another, and perhaps a soprano in still a third.\r\nSo it would be very much like a jig-saw puzzle to find them all and put\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\nThe Gonzaga family tried to persuade him to return to their court, but\r\nhe refused, although he often wrote special operas for them or short\r\ndramatic spectacles which were called intermezzos. Of these, sad to say,\r\nalmost nothing remains.\r\n\r\nThe recitative style invented by the “Camerata” had by this time taken\r\nsuch a firm hold upon the people, that it spread even to the music of\r\nthe Church and to the madrigals. All the Italian composers began to\r\nwrite _recitative_ for solo voices and accompaniment which they called\r\n_canzoni_ (songs), _canzonetti_ (little songs), and _arie_ (melodies).\r\n\r\nMonteverde was one of the first to turn the madrigal into a _cantata da\r\ncamera_ which means the recitation to music of a short drama or story in\r\nverse, by one person, accompanied by one instrument. But, as things\r\nimprove or die out, very soon another voice and several instruments were\r\nadded. This composition is a musical milestone of the 17th century as\r\nthe madrigal had been of the 15th and 16th. The cantata for more than\r\none voice forms a little chamber music opera without any acting. Some of\r\nthe best known cantata writers were Ferrari, Carissimi, Rossi,\r\nGasparini, Marcello, and Alessandro Scarlatti. At the age of seventy,\r\nMonteverde took up this new style of composition with all the enthusiasm\r\nand freshness of a young composer! He was not the inventor of the\r\n_cantata da camera_, as is so often claimed for him, as no one man was\r\nits inventor. It was the result of the constant search of the composers\r\nof that day, who followed along the same path, and worked together to\r\nperfect a new form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NEW FEELINGS EXPRESSED\r\n\r\nOne of Monteverde’s most important works in this style is the _Combat of\r\nTancredi and Clorinda (Combattimento di Tancredi e di Clorinda)_ a poem\r\nby Tasso, which is noteworthy for several new things. In the preface of\r\nthe published edition, Monteverde says that he had long tried to invent\r\na style _concitato_, or agitated, that he had been struck by the fact\r\nthat musicians had never tried to express anger or the fury of battle,\r\nbut had expressed only tenderness and sweetness, sadness or gayety.\r\n(Perhaps he did not know Jannequin’s _Battle of Marignan_.) So he wrote\r\nbattle music.\r\n\r\nThe second innovation was the tremolo, which, however familiar to us\r\ntoday, he used for the first time to express agitation, anger and fear,\r\nand the musicians were so surprised to see something that they had never\r\nseen before, that they refused to play it! This was neither the first\r\nnor the last time that musicians balked at something new.\r\n\r\nThe third innovation was that he wrote independent parts for the\r\norchestra, and for the first time the instruments did not “copy” the\r\nvoice, but had notes all to themselves to play.\r\n\r\nIn 1630 there was a terrible epidemic in Venice, the “Black Plague”\r\nwhich lasted a year and took off one-third of her population! In\r\ngratitude for having been spared, Monteverde became a priest in the\r\nChurch. This did not seem to interfere with his composing secular works,\r\nfor after this, he wrote several operas.\r\n\r\nVenice was the home of the first public opera house in the world! It was\r\nopened (1637) in the San Cassiano theatre by Benedetto Ferrari and\r\nFrancesco Manelli, and for this in these last years of his life,\r\nMonteverde wrote some of his most important operas. Monteverde’s operas\r\nof this time were a combination of the Roman _opera-cantate_, then in\r\nstyle, and his first operas, _Orfeo_ and _Arianna_, written thirty-five\r\nyears before. He had great enough genius to fit his work to the\r\nconditions that he found in the opera house, so that when they had to\r\nreduce expenses, Monteverde cut down the size of his orchestra to just a\r\nclavichord, a few theorbos, a bass viol and a few violins and viols, and\r\nwrote works without choruses! He was agreeable, wasn’t he? A thing which\r\npeople of “near” greatness rarely are!\r\n\r\nThe last work he composed at the age of 74 is one of his best! Is it not\r\nwonderful to think that he had not lost inspiration and enthusiasm after\r\na long life of hard work? The Italian name for his last opera is\r\n_Incoronazione di Poppea_, or the “Coronation of Poppea.” It is a story\r\nof the court of Nero, and Monteverde has sketched his characters in\r\nvivid music, and has made them seem true to life. Henry Prunières, who\r\nhas made an earnest study of Monteverde says in his book, _Monteverde_,\r\n“Monteverde saw Imperial Rome with eyes of genius and knew how to make\r\nit live again for us. No book, no historical account could picture Nero\r\nand Poppea as vigorously as this opera.” It is the greatest opera of the\r\n17th century, and actually created the school of Italian grand opera.\r\nWith it, mythological characters gave way to the historical in opera,\r\nwhich enlarged the field of drama with music.\r\n\r\nSo Monteverde, the great innovator, died in Venice in 1643 and was given\r\nby the citizens of Venice a funeral worthy of his greatness.\r\n\r\nHe dug new paths on which all modern composers travel and throughout his\r\nlife he followed his ideal, which was to translate into the language of\r\nmusic, human feelings and ideas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After a painting by Molenaer in the Rijks Museum, Amsterdam._\r\n\r\n  _A Lady at the Clavier (Clavichord)._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After the painting by Terborch._\r\n\r\n  _A Lady Playing the Theorbo (luth)._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                       Musicke in Merrie England\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will recall how far away England was in the 16th century from Rome,\r\nthe Pope, and the other nations. Not that it has been pushed any nearer\r\nnow, but the radio, the aeroplane and the steamship have made it seem\r\ncloser. In the 16th century it took a long time to reach the people of\r\nthe continent, and for this reason England seemed to many to have little\r\nmusical influence, but in reality it had much for it was forced to\r\ndevelop what it found at home.\r\n\r\nAbout 1420, John Dunstable wrote beautiful motets, canzonas and other\r\nsecular music in the contrapuntal style of his period. He is supposed to\r\nhave held a post in the Chapel Royal, founded during the reign of Henry\r\nIV, and to have taken part in the musical services held to celebrate\r\nHenry’s victories in France.\r\n\r\nThen came the War of the Roses between the Houses of York and Lancaster,\r\nand musical composition in England was checked for the sake of\r\nwar-making. Yet, the Chapel Royal was maintained and the universities\r\ngave degrees to students of music. Judging from the number of singing\r\nguilds and cathedral choirs, and from the amount of singing and organ\r\nplaying, music, even in spite of war, seemed to have its innings.\r\n\r\nIn the 16th century England made such strides forward that she holds a\r\nhigh place in the growth of music. England loved the keyboard\r\ninstruments such as the virginal, and in this century, developed her own\r\nway of making a delightful combination of polyphony and harmony with the\r\nnew music for the Protestant Church service.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BLUFF PRINCE HAL\r\n\r\nRight here came the Reformation of the English Church under Henry VIII\r\nof the six wives. In 1535 he wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine\r\nof Aragon, to marry Anne Boleyn, her lady in waiting, which the Pope\r\nwould not permit him to do, as the Roman Catholic Church prohibits\r\ndivorce. So, like Germany and Switzerland, England cut herself off from\r\nthe Pope and founded the English or Anglican Church with the King as its\r\nhead. You can imagine the excitement this caused, can’t you? People lost\r\ntheir heads in very truth, for what they thought right and religious,\r\nsome of the rulers called sacrilegious and heretical.\r\n\r\nBreaking away from the Church of Rome gave English music a great push\r\nforward, for, the Mass (the musical setting of the main part of the\r\nservice), the motet (the particular lines of the particular day) and the\r\nplain song (which ministers intoned), were discontinued, and for these\r\nwere substituted, after Henry VIII’s reign, the Church “Services”\r\nfounded on the Elizabethan Prayer book. On this book, still in use, the\r\nnew music was written and included such compositions as would fit this\r\nLiturgy (prayers), the Litany, Creed, Psalms, Canticles (line verses),\r\nand the Communion, the Plain Song, Versicles and Responses. Then, too,\r\ncame hymn tunes and anthems. Among the composers of these in the\r\nElizabethan reign were John Shepherd, John Marbeck, Robert Whyte,\r\nRichard Farrant, William Byrd and John Bull.\r\n\r\nBut let us go back to Bluff Prince Hal (Henry VIII), who was good to\r\nmusic. Not only did he love it, but he played and composed himself. One\r\nof his pieces is called _The King’s Balade_, or _Passetyme with Goode\r\nCompanie_ and the pastimes of this monarch were many. Read this list,\r\nset down by one who knew him: “He spent his time in shooting, singing,\r\ndancing, wrestling, casting of the bar, playing at the recorders (a reed\r\ninstrument), flute, virginals (the English spinet) in setting songs and\r\nmaking ballads.” So with eating and sleeping and attending to affairs of\r\nstate and to his many wives as they came along, he must have had plenty\r\nto do! How many kings and governors today write music as a “passetyme”?\r\n\r\nIn 1526 he had a band of players, says Edmundstoune Duncan in his _Story\r\nof Minstrelsy_, “composed of fifteen trumpets, three lutes, three\r\nrebecks, one harp, two viols, ten sackbuts, a fife, and four\r\ndrumslades”; a few years later a trumpet, a lute, three minstrels, and a\r\nplayer of the virginals were added. (A rebeck is an early form of\r\nviolin; a sackbut is a reed instrument with a sliding piece such as we\r\nhave today in the trombone; the drumslade is an old word for drum.)\r\n\r\nAnne Boleyn, second of King Henry’s many wives, loved music and dancing,\r\nand she too tried her hand at composing, to which fact her _O death,\r\nrocke me on slepe_ is proof. It is said that “she doated on the\r\ncompositions of Josquin and Mouton,” and that she made collections of\r\nthem for herself and her companions.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there was no English Bible and only Latin and Greek\r\nversions were used. The Church did not consider it proper for the common\r\npeople to read the Scriptures. The Priests wanted to read and interpret\r\nit to them instead. You remember, too, one of the reasons that the\r\nReformation took place in Germany was because Luther wanted to let the\r\npeople think for themselves, read their Bible, and choose their own ways\r\nof worshipping and interpreting it. The same feeling crept into England,\r\nand William Tyndale made the first English Translation of the New\r\nTestament (1538). Soon the Psalms were translated and set to music to\r\nany air from a jig to a French dance tune! The gayer the air the more\r\npopular the Psalm!\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAINED LIBRARIES\r\n\r\nBecause the Protestants did not want anything left that had been part of\r\nthe old religion in England, a rather dreadful thing happened. The\r\nmonasteries were either destroyed or their libraries and organizations\r\nwere discontinued. On account of this, many fine manuscripts of music\r\nand poetry were lost, for as you know, the monks copied out, with much\r\neffort, the literature of their day, and these painstaking glorious bits\r\nof hand work were kept in the monasteries.\r\n\r\nThere are today four chained libraries in England, two of which are at\r\nHereford, the old city that holds yearly musical festivals of the “Three\r\nChoirs.” The books are on the old chains and may be taken down and read\r\non the desk below the shelves, as they were hundreds of years ago! Here\r\nthey are, in the cloisters, a great collection of treasures beyond\r\nprice, just as the medieval scholars read them in days when books were\r\nthe costliest of luxuries, three hundred volumes dating back to the 12th\r\ncentury. The earliest manuscript is the _Anglo Saxon Gospels_ which was\r\nwritten about 800 A.D. One of the greatest treasures is a Breviary\r\n(prayer book) with music (1280)—the plain-song notation as clear and as\r\neasy to read as modern print.\r\n\r\nAs something had to take the place of monasteries, the universities\r\nbecame the centers for study and the cultivation of music. As far back\r\nas 866, King Alfred founded the first chair of music at Oxford! Do you\r\nremember that this was the time of the bards and minstrels? We do not\r\nseem very old in America, when we think of a college with a chair of\r\nmusic eleven hundred years ago!\r\n\r\nBefore the printers were expelled from England, Wynken de Worde, printed\r\nthe first song book (1530) which contained pieces by men important at\r\nthe time: Cornyshe, Pygot, Gwinneth, Robert Jones, Dr. Cooper, and\r\nFayrfax.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MUSIC FOR THE NEW CHURCH\r\n\r\nAs the kingdom changed its king at the death of each monarch, the\r\ncountry swayed from Catholicism to Protestantism and back again, and\r\nmany a poet and musician lost his head or was burnt at the stake because\r\nhe wrote for the Protestant Church. In the case of Marbeck who had made\r\nmusic for the _Book of Common Prayer_, he just escaped death for the\r\ncrime of writing a _Bible_ concordance (an index)!\r\n\r\nBefore Wynken de Worde’s song book came out, William Caxton, the great\r\nprinter, published a book called _Polychronicon_ by Higden. In this, was\r\nan account of Pythagoras and his discovery of tone relations (Chapter\r\nIV); this proves the great interest in England for the science, as well\r\nas the art, of music.\r\n\r\nIn Frederick J. Crowest’s book, _The Story of the Art of Music_, he\r\ntells very simply the state of music in England at this time:\r\n\r\n“When the adventurous Henry VIII plunged into and consummated\r\n(completed) the reformation scheme, it was at the expense of\r\nconsiderable inconvenience to musicians obliged, perforce, to change\r\ntheir musical manners as well as their faith. In double quick time the\r\nold ecclesiastical (church) music had to be cast aside, and new church\r\nmusic substituted.... This meant pangs and hardships to the musicians,\r\npossibly not too industrious, accustomed to the old state of things.\r\nSimplicity, too, was the order, a change that must have made musicians\r\nshudder when they, like others before them, from the time of Okeghem,\r\nhad regarded the Mass as the natural and orthodox (correct) vehicle for\r\nthe display of the contrapuntal miracles they wrought.”\r\n\r\nNow the Mass became the “Service,” and the motet was turned into the\r\n“Anthem,” which we still use in our churches. Most of the famous\r\ncomposers of the 16th and 17th centuries in England wrote for the new\r\nAnglican or Protestant Church, and made the new music lovely indeed.\r\nMany of them were organists or singers in the Chapel Royal, so they had\r\nbeen well prepared for their work.\r\n\r\nTo make this new music different from the old, the writers were ordered\r\nto fit every syllable with a chord (in the harmonic style). In the old\r\ncounterpoint, of course, the words were somewhat blurred. These\r\nexperiments with chords did much to free music for all time.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of the church composers is Thomas Tallis (about\r\n1520–1585), a “Gentleman of the Chapel Royal” and father of English\r\ncathedral music. Through his long career, Tallis followed the different\r\nreligions of the rulers from Henry VIII to Elizabeth, writing Catholic\r\nmusic or Protestant as was needed. You see he liked his head, so he\r\nchanged his music with each new monarch. He, like some of the composers\r\nof the Netherlands school, wrote a motet for forty voices.\r\n\r\nHe shared with his pupil, William Byrd, the post of organist of the\r\nChapel Royal, and together they opened a shop “to print and sell music,\r\nalso to rule, print and sell music paper for twenty-one years” under a\r\npatent granted by Queen Elizabeth to them only. How successful the two\r\ncomposers were in the publishing business is not stated, but at least\r\nthey could publish as many of their own works as they cared to! After\r\nTallis’ death, in 1585, for a while Byrd ran the shop alone, and\r\npublished a collection of _Psalms, Sonets, and Songs of Sadness and\r\nPietie_. In this was written “Eight reasons briefly set down by the\r\nAuthor (Byrd) to persuade every one to learn to sing” to which he added:\r\n\r\n                  Since singing is so goode a thing\r\n                  I wish all men would learne to sing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FAMOUS OLD MUSIC COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nEngland was the land of famous music collections in the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies. The first of these by Byrd was a book of Italian Madrigals\r\nwith English words, _Musica Transalpina_, (Music from across the Alps).\r\nThe entire title was (Don’t laugh!): “_Musica Transalpina_; Madrigals\r\ntranslated of foure, five, and sixe parts, chosen out of diuers\r\nexcellent Authors, with the first and second part of _La Virginella_,\r\nmade by Maister Byrd vpon two Stanz’s of Ariosto and brought to speak\r\nEnglish with the rest. Published by N. Yonge, in fauer of such as take\r\npleasure in Musick of voices. Imprinted at London by Thomas Easy, the\r\nassigne of William Byrd, 1588. _Cum Privilegio Regise Maiestatis_ (With\r\npermission of her Royal Majesty).” A long title and one that would not\r\nmake a book a “bestseller” today! Do notice how they mixed u’s and v’s\r\nand put in e’s where you least expect them!\r\n\r\nThere were fifty-seven madrigals in the long titled collection including\r\nthe two by “Maister Byrd”; the others were by the Italian and Netherland\r\nmadrigal writers, such as Palestrina, Orlandus Lassus and Ferabosco, a\r\ncomposer of masques and madrigals, who lived for years in England.\r\n\r\nByrd’s compositions in this work mark the beginning of the great English\r\nschool of madrigals, which were so lovely that this period (1560 to\r\n1650) was called the “Golden Age.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE GOLDEN AGE OF MADRIGALS\r\n\r\nNow the madrigal becomes the great English contribution to music. It was\r\na part-song in free contrapuntal style and the music was made to fit the\r\nwords. For the first time, secular music was held in great honor, and\r\nprepared the way for arias, dramatic solos and original melodies.\r\n\r\nAfter Byrd and Edwards, came other madrigal writers: Thomas Morley, John\r\nDowland, George Kirby, Thomas Ford, Thomas Ravenscroft, Orlando Gibbons\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nWhile the madrigal was being written in England and elsewhere, the\r\npart-song was being written in Germany. It was the companion of the\r\nchorale, as the madrigal was the secular partner of the motet. The\r\nchorale was written for part singing, had a continuous melody and the\r\nsame air was used for all stanzas. In this the church modes were never\r\nused, yet, it is baffling sometimes to tell a madrigal from a part-song.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the _villanella_, or _villota_ is a part-song. In France it was\r\nthe _chanson_, in England it was the madrigal or the _glee_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “THE TRIUMPHS OF ORIANA”\r\n\r\nMonarchs, besides ruling the country, inspired poets and composers from\r\nearliest times, and Queen Elizabeth was no exception. _The Triumphs of\r\nOriana_ is a collection of madrigals by many English composers in praise\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, made by Thomas Morley. Because William Byrd does not\r\nappear in it, it looks as if this collection had been published to show\r\nByrd that the English could write good madrigals, too. Anyhow, it\r\ndefinitely proves that the English madrigals are as charming as the\r\nFrench, Italian or Flemish. There is a copy of the original edition in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MAISTER BYRD GIVES ADVICE\r\n\r\nIn 1611, an important work of Byrd’s appeared called _Psalms, Songs and\r\nSonets: some solemne, others joyfull, framed to the life of the words:\r\nFit for Voyces or Viols_. In the dedication, the composer gives this\r\ngood advice: “Onely this I desire; that you will be but as carefull to\r\nheare them well expressed, as I have beene both in the composing and\r\ncorrecting of them. Otherwise the best Song that euer was made will\r\nseeme harsh and vnpleasant.... Besides a song that is well and\r\nartificially made cannot be well perceived nor vnderstood at the first\r\nhearing, but the oftner you shall heare it, the better cause of liking\r\nit you will discouer; and commonly the Song is best esteemed with which\r\nour eares are best acquainted.”\r\n\r\nOver the door of the music hall in Oxford University, is a canon (or\r\nround) for three voices, said to have been written by William Byrd. Some\r\nday, if you have not already seen it, you will have the thrilling\r\nexperience of visiting the venerable college, and you may remember to\r\nlook for this canon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LADIES OF THE REALM PLAY VIRGINALS\r\n\r\nAs today we consider no home complete without a piano (or pianoforte\r\nwhich is its real name), so in the 16th and 17th centuries we would have\r\nfound a little key board instrument so small that it could easily be\r\nswallowed whole by one of our grand pianos, and you would never know\r\nwhere it had disappeared! It was known by several names,—spinet,\r\nclavecin, and virginal or virginals. Another instrument belonging to the\r\nsame family and period is the harpsichord, which is more like our grand\r\npiano in shape. But later we will tell you more of the pianoforte’s\r\nfamily tree, and of its tiny but important grand-parent.\r\n\r\nIt was quite the proper thing for all the ladies of the realm to play\r\nthe virginals, and the Queens, Mary, Elizabeth, and Mary, Queen of\r\nScots, were excellent performers.\r\n\r\nThe very first music printed for the virginals in England was called\r\n_Parthenia_ (from the Greek word Parthenos, meaning unmarried woman or\r\nvirgin). The printed title also tells us that it was “composed by three\r\nfamous masters, William Byrd, Dr. John Bull and Orlando Gibbons\r\nGentilmen of his Majesties most illustrious Chappell.” There are\r\ntwenty-one pieces from the old dances which formed the Suites, of which\r\nyou will soon hear,—Preludiums, Pavanes, Galiardes, a Fantasia, and one\r\n_The Queene’s Command_. It was published in 1611, on staves of six\r\nlines, instead of five, as we use, and it was the first musical work\r\nengraved on copper plates!\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MORE FAMOUS COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nAnother most valuable collection was for many years called _Queen\r\nElizabeth’s Virginal Book_, but is now the _Fitzwilliam Virginal Book_,\r\nand the original manuscript is in the Fitzwilliam museum at Cambridge.\r\nIt was supposed to have been “Good Queen Bess’” book, but it was not, as\r\nsome of its compositions were composed after her death. It is not known\r\nwho copied 220 pages of music, but it may have been a wealthy Roman\r\nCatholic, Francis Tregian, who spent twenty-four years in prison on\r\naccount of his religious faith. This name, abbreviated or in initials,\r\nis found in several places in the manuscript. An edition in our notation\r\nhas been made by J. A. Fuller Maitland and W. Barclay Squire. Many of\r\nthe old songs of English minstrelsy are found among the numbers, and\r\nthey were arranged for the instrument by the famous composers of that\r\nday. There are also original compositions as well as “ayres” and\r\nvariations. Among the composers we find Dr. John Bull, Thomas Morley,\r\nWilliam Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, Giles Farnaby, Richard Farnaby, Thomas\r\nTallis, Jan Sweelinck, the Dutch organist, and many others. Here are\r\nsome of the quaint titles: _St. Thomas’ Wake_, _King’s Hunt_, _The\r\nCarman’s Whistle_, _The Hunt’s Up_, _Sellonger’s Round_, _Fortune My\r\nFoe_, _Pawles Warfe_, _Go from My Window_, _Bonny Sweet Robin_, besides\r\nmany Pavanes, Galiardes, Fantasias, and Preludiums.\r\n\r\nThere is also a collection of Byrd’s virginal music called _My Lady\r\nNevell’s Booke_. Lady Nevell may have been a pupil of Byrd. There are\r\ntwo collections of this same kind at Buckingham Palace, the home of the\r\nKing of England,—_Will Forster’s Virginal Book_ and _Benjamin Cosyn’s\r\nVirginal Book_. In the index of the latter, we read: “A table of these\r\nLessons following made and sett forth by Ben Cos.” In all, he copied\r\nmore than 90 compositions!\r\n\r\nLater came John Playford, music publisher, whose first musical\r\npublication, _The English Dancing-Master_ (1650), contains almost a\r\nhundred old folk tunes. _Select Musical Ayres_ appeared three years\r\nlater, and is a typical 17th century song collection of first-class\r\npoems by Jonson, Dryden and others set to music by well-known composers.\r\nHis book on the theory of music, used for almost a century, contained\r\n“lessons” for the viol, the cithern and flageolet. His _Dancing Master_,\r\na collection of airs for violin for country dances, has brought to us\r\nmany popular ballad tunes and dance airs of the period.\r\n\r\nIn these collections we often find the names _Fancies_, _Fantazia_, or\r\n_Fantasies_, a type of composition that grew out of the madrigal and led\r\nto the sonata. It was the name given to the first compositions for\r\ninstruments alone like the _ricercari_ of the Italians, which were\r\noriginal compositions and not written on a given subject (called in\r\nEngland “ground”), or on a folk song. The _Fancies_ were sometimes\r\nwritten for the virginal, and sometimes for groups of instruments such\r\nas a “chest of viols” or even five cornets(!).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CHEST OF VIOLS\r\n\r\n“Chest of Viols” may sound queer to you, but it isn’t! It was the custom\r\nin England at that time for people to have collections of instruments in\r\nor out of chests. So, when callers came they could play the viol,\r\ninstead, probably of bridge! You can read about these interesting old\r\ndays in Samuel Pepys’ _Diary_. He played the lute, the viol, the\r\ntheorbo, the flageolet, the recorder (a kind of flute) and the virginal,\r\nand he was the proud owner of a chest of viols. He always carried his\r\nlittle flageolet with him in his pocket, and he says that while he was\r\nwaiting in a tavern for a dish of poached eggs, he played his flageolet,\r\nalso that he remained in the garden late playing the flageolet in the\r\nmoonlight. (Poetic Pepys!)\r\n\r\nThomas Morley, Byrd’s pupil, who was made a partner in the publishing\r\nhouse after Tallis’s death, wrote his madrigals for virginal, and a\r\ncollection called _First Book of Consort Lessons for Six Instruments,\r\nLute, Pandora, Cittern_ (an old English form of guitar), _Bass Viol,\r\nFlute, and Treble Viol_, and much sacred music. He also wrote a _Plaine\r\nand Easie Introduction to Practical Musick_, a book of great value and\r\ninterest to musicians for the last three centuries, for it is a mirror\r\nof his time and of his fellow composers.\r\n\r\nHe tells of a gentleman, who, after dinner, was asked by his hostess to\r\nsing from the music she gave him. It was the custom in England to bring\r\nout the music books after dinner and for the guests to play and sing, as\r\nwe wind up our graphophones and switch on the radio. The gentleman\r\nstammeringly declared that he could not sing at sight and “everyone\r\nbegan to wonder; yea, some whispered to others, demanding how he was\r\nbrought up.” He was so ashamed of his ignorance that he immediately took\r\nmusic lessons to remedy his woeful lack of culture. This proves that\r\nmusical education was not looked upon as a luxury but a necessity in the\r\n17th century.\r\n\r\nTruly, it was a musical era, this time of Morley and Byrd! Fancy\r\nplaying, while waiting for the barber, the viol, flute, lute, cittern,\r\nor virginal left for that purpose. Yet what would our dentist do today\r\nif he had to listen to a saxophone and jazz chorus from his waiting\r\nroom? In those days, too, there was always a bass viol left in a\r\ndrawing-room for the guest, to pass the time, waiting for the host to\r\nappear. Think of all the practising you could do waiting for the busy\r\ndentist or eternally late hostess!\r\n\r\nThe children of people who were poor, were taught music to make them fit\r\nto be “servants, apprentices or husbandmen.” Laneham, a groom who had\r\nbeen brought up in the royal stable, was advanced to the post of\r\nguarding the door of the council chamber and this is how he described\r\nhis qualifications for the job: “Sometimes I foot it with dancing; now\r\nwith my gittern, and else my cittern, then at the virginals (ye know\r\nnothing comes amiss to me); then carol I up a song withal; that\r\nby-and-by they come flocking about me like bees to honey; and ever they\r\ncry, ‘Another, good Laneham, another!’” (From _The Story of Minstrelsy_\r\nby Edmundstoune Duncan.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SHAKESPEARE AND MUSIC\r\n\r\nThis was the day in which Shakespeare lived, and from his plays we get a\r\nvery good idea of the popular music of his time, for he used bits of\r\nfolk songs and old ballads. _It was a Lover and his Lass_ from _As You\r\nLike It_ was set to music by Thomas Morley, and is one of the few songs\r\nwritten to Shakespeare’s words in his own day that has come down to us.\r\nIn _Twelfth Night_ there is _O Mistress Mine_, _Hold thy Peace_,\r\n_Peg-a-Ramsey_, _O, London is a Fine Town_, _Three Merry Men be We_, and\r\nthe Clown’s song:\r\n\r\n                    Hey! Robin, jolly Robin,\r\n                    Tell me how thy lady does, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the _Winter’s Tale_, _As You Like It_, _The Tempest_, _Merchant of\r\nVenice_, _Hamlet_, _Othello_ are folk songs that are very well known and\r\nloved. Two songs from _The Tempest_, _Where the Bee Sucks_ and _Full\r\nFathoms Five_, were set to music by a composer, Robert Johnson, who\r\nlived at the same time as Shakespeare, but was not as famous as Morley,\r\nwho also lived then. _O, Willow, Willow_, sung by Desdemona in _Othello_\r\nis one of the most beautiful and saddest folk songs we know.\r\n\r\nOne Shakespeare song has been made famous by the beautiful music which\r\nthe great German song writer, Schubert, wrote to it. It is from _Two\r\nGentlemen of Verona_ and is called _Who is Sylvia?_\r\n\r\nMany of the English composers of the 17th and 18th centuries such as\r\nHenry Purcell and Dr. Arne made music for the Shakespeare songs because\r\nthey were so lovely and so well written that they almost sang\r\nthemselves; this we call lyric verse.\r\n\r\nThomas Weelkes (1575?–1623) whose madrigals were included in _The\r\nTriumphs of Oriana_, also wrote many _Fancies for Strings_ which were\r\nthe ancestors of the string quartets, the highest type of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CRYES OF LONDON\r\n\r\nSeveral composers of this period, Thomas Weelkes, Orlando Gibbons\r\n(1583–1625) and Richard Deering (1580?–1630) wrote pieces using the old\r\n“Cryes of London” as their themes. Each trade had its own song, and the\r\nstreet pedlars used these tunes just as the fruit vendors, old-clothes\r\nmen, and flower vendors cry their wares in our streets today. There is\r\nthis difference, however; the street cries of today are mere noise,\r\nwhile the old “Cryes of London” were interesting and usually beautiful\r\nsongs. _Cherry Ripe_ is one of them, and Campion used it in 1617 in his\r\nfamous old song, _There is a Garden in Her Face_. Some of the composers\r\nmade rounds and catches based on the “Cryes,” and Weelkes in his\r\n_Humorous Fancy_ used the songs of the chimney-sweep, the\r\nbellows-mender, and the vendors of fruit, fish and vegetables. In\r\ntelling about this “fancy,” Frederick Bridge, a British composer and\r\nprofessor of music in Gresham College, says: “The Fancy at one point\r\nleaves its regular course, and for a few bars a delightful dance tune is\r\nintroduced, to the words, whatever they mean, ‘Twincledowne Tavye.’ It\r\nis as if the vendors of fish, fruit and vegetables met in the street and\r\nhad a bit of a frolic together.” Bridge also says that he thinks all\r\nlovers of Shakespeare will be glad to make the acquaintance of the music\r\nof the “Cryes of London” which saluted the poet’s ears in his daily\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nOrlando Gibbons called his composition on the “cryes,” a _Burlesque\r\nMadrigal_, and beside the cries, he has used in one of the inner parts\r\nfor viol, an old plain-song melody, a form used very often by the\r\nItalian madrigalists of the 16th century. Richard Deering’s _Humorous\r\nFancy_, _The Cryes of London_, is the most elaborate of the three we\r\nhave mentioned, having among many other tradesmen’s songs, those of the\r\nrat-catcher (this makes us think of Browning’s _Pied Piper of Hamelin_),\r\nthe tooth-drawer, and the vendor of garlic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SOME FAMOUS COMPOSERS\r\n\r\nOrlando Gibbons was one of the composers of _Parthenia_. But he is\r\nfamous as a composer of sacred music, in fact, he is looked upon as the\r\ngreatest composer of the English contrapuntal school. His anthems are\r\nstill sung in the English Cathedrals, and one of them made for James I,\r\nwas sung, in part, at the coronations of both Edward VII and George V,\r\nand is now called the _Abbey Amen_.\r\n\r\nGibbons, Byrd and Bull were very fine organists. Gibbons was organist of\r\nWestminster Abbey, and we are told by a writer of his own day that “the\r\norgan was touched by the best finger of that age, Mr. Orlando Gibbons.”\r\n\r\nDr. John Bull (1563–1628) was brought up, as were many of the young\r\nEnglish musicians, as one of the “Children of the Chapel Royal Choir.”\r\nLater he became organist and player to King James I. Bull left England,\r\nentered the service of a Belgian archduke, was organist at the Antwerp\r\nCathedral, and when he died in 1628, he was buried there. In the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, where Bull took his degree as Doctor of Music, is\r\nhis portrait around which is written:\r\n\r\n                The Bull by force in field doth rayne\r\n                But Bull by skill good-will doth gaine.\r\n\r\nJohn Milton, father of the great poet, was an important composer of this\r\nperiod. It is well known that his famous son was very fond of music, was\r\na good musician himself, and had many friends among these composers and\r\nmusicians.\r\n\r\nThe music for Milton’s famous Masque, _Comus_, was written by Henry\r\nLawes (1595–1662) and was first produced in 1635. Lawes studied with an\r\nEnglish composer named John Cooper who lived for so many years in Italy,\r\nthat his name was translated into Giovanni Coperario. He turned the\r\nthoughts of his pupil to composing music for the stage, instead of\r\nchurch music. It looks as if Milton had been a pupil of Lawes, and had\r\nwritten _Comus_ specially for him.\r\n\r\nLawes played a very amusing joke upon the concert-goers. At that time,\r\nas now, many thought that the music of other countries, and songs in\r\nforeign languages were better than their own. While Lawes himself knew\r\nthe Italian music very well, he was eager to compose music that should\r\nbe truly English. In the preface to his _Book of Ayres_ he confessed:\r\n“This present generation is so sated with what’s native, that nothing\r\ntakes their ears but what’s sung in a language which (commonly) they\r\nunderstand as little as they do the music. And to make them a little\r\nsensible of this ridiculous humor, I took a Table or Index of old\r\nItalian Songs and this _Index_ (_which read together made a strange\r\nmedley of nonsense_) _I set to a varyed Ayre, and gave out that it came\r\nfrom Italy, whereby it has passed for a rare Italian song_.” (Quoted\r\nfrom Bridge’s _Twelve Good Musicians_.)\r\n\r\nLawes helped to compose a work that is looked upon as the first English\r\nopera, _The Siege of Rhodes_. This was played during the time of Oliver\r\nCromwell and the Commonwealth, and in this piece for the first time in\r\nEngland, women appeared upon the stage.\r\n\r\nA year after the Commonwealth was overthrown, Henry Lawes died and was\r\nburied in Westminster Abbey, but the spot where his body lies is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nFrom 1641 to 1660, music must have had a hard time for this was the\r\nperiod of the Commonwealth, when the country was going through all the\r\nhorrors of civil war, and Cromwell’s soldiers destroyed many things of\r\ngreat artistic value, that could never be replaced. Among them were the\r\nworks of art found in the wonderful old English cathedrals, including\r\norgans and musical manuscripts. At Westminster Abbey, the Roundheads\r\n(the name given to Oliver Cromwell’s soldiers) “brake down the organs\r\nfor pots of ale.”\r\n\r\nMatthew Locke (1630?–1677) is looked upon as the “Father of English\r\nOpera.” He wrote the music for _Psyche_ and _The Tempest_ (1673).\r\nAnother Shakespeare play to which Locke wrote the music was _Macbeth_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CAPTAIN COOKE’S CHOIR BOYS\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Restoration, the Chapel Royal Choir was\r\nreorganized. For centuries it had been the great school of music for the\r\nsons of both rich and poor, and had produced nearly all the English\r\nmusicians. Captain Henry Cooke, the first chapel master of the new\r\nchoir, seems to have picked out unusually gifted children, some of whom\r\nwrote anthems while they were still in the Choir, and afterwards became\r\nvery famous composers, among them John Blow, Pelham Humphrey and the\r\ngreat Henry Purcell. The Captain evidently knew how to train his boys!\r\n\r\nPelham Humphrey, having attracted the attention of the King, was sent to\r\nParis to study with the famous opera composer, Lully. The effect of this\r\nstudy was felt in English music, as Humphrey was Purcell’s master at the\r\nChapel Royal, after the death of the good Captain Cooke, and he\r\nintroduced his new ideas to his talented little choir boys and musical\r\nfriends. Samuel Pepys says that the visit to Paris made a snob of\r\n“little” Pelham Humphrey: “He is an absolute _Monsieur_, full of form\r\nand confidence and vanity, and disparages everything and everybody’s\r\nskill but his own. But to hear how he laughs at all the King’s Musick\r\nhere, ... that they cannot keep time nor tune nor understand anything.”\r\n\r\nDr. John Blow (1648–1708) composed Anthems while still a choir boy, and\r\nat twenty-one was organist of Westminster Abbey. In 1674 he was Master\r\nof the Children of the Chapel Royal, and became its organist as well,\r\nwithout giving up his post at Westminster. During part of the time\r\nPurcell was at Westminster, and Blow was Almoner and Master of the\r\nchoristers in St. Paul’s Cathedral. Think of filling three of the\r\ngreatest positions in musical London at the same time! He wrote an\r\nAnthem, _I was Glad_, for the opening of St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1697.\r\n\r\nHe wrote many church compositions, masques, and pieces for harpsichord.\r\n\r\nPurcell called him “one of the greatest masters in the world.” Like\r\nMonteverde, he tried out new effects in harmony and made new\r\ncombinations which have since been called “crude,” but were signs of a\r\nmusical daring and understanding that belong only to very gifted\r\nmusicians.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1708 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MAISTER PURCELL\r\n\r\nThe last of the great 17th century English composers, and the greatest\r\nof them all, is Henry Purcell (1658–1695). His father was a well-known\r\nmusician, and the uncle, who brought him up, was also a musician, so the\r\nyoung boy heard much music in his own home, and no doubt knew many\r\ncomposers.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Bridge in _Twelve Good Musicians_ tells us that the\r\nPurcell family came from Tipperary in Ireland and that Henry’s father\r\nand uncle were Gentlemen in the Chapel Royal in London. Henry began his\r\nmusic studies at the age of six, for he, too, was one of “Captain\r\nCooke’s boys,” and when he was twelve years old, “Maister Purcell” wrote\r\na composition in honor of “His Majestie’s Birthday.”\r\n\r\nThe young Purcell, sometimes called the “English Mozart,” gained much\r\nfrom Pelham Humphrey who told him of Lully in France. After Humphrey’s\r\nearly death (he was only twenty-seven), Purcell studied with Dr. Blow,\r\nand the two musicians were devoted comrades. Their tombs lie close\r\ntogether near the old entrance of the organ loft, where they must have\r\nspent many hours of their lives.\r\n\r\nMatthew Locke was also a friend of Purcell’s, and probably did much to\r\ninterest the young composer in the drama, for in spite of his early\r\nchurch training, Purcell’s greatest offering to English music was his\r\nopera writing. While Purcell’s are not operas in our sense of the word,\r\nthey are the nearest thing to them that England had, before the Italians\r\ncame with theirs in the 18th century. He wrote music to masques and\r\nplays, several of which were even called operas, yet only one really was\r\nan opera. Purcell’s music “was so far in advance of anything of the sort\r\nknown in any part of Europe in his day, in point of dramatic and musical\r\nfreedom and scenic quality, that one can only regret his early death’s\r\npreventing his taking to opera writing on a larger scale.” (W. F.\r\nApthorp.) Among the things he put to music were the plays of Dryden and\r\nof Beaumont and Fletcher.\r\n\r\nPurcell was one of the first English composers to use Italian musical\r\nterms, like _adagio_, _presto_, _largo_, etc. He was also one of the\r\nfirst composers to write compositions of three or four movements for two\r\nviolins, ’cello and basso continuo, a part written for harpsichord or\r\nsometimes organ as an accompaniment to the other instruments. The name\r\nof this style of composition also came from the Italian, and was called\r\n_Sonata_. The first sonatas were composed by Italians. The word Sonata\r\ncomes from an Italian word _suonare_ which means to sound, and was first\r\ngiven to works for instruments. Another form of composition is the\r\nCantata, from _cantare_ which means to sing. It is a vocal composition\r\nwith accompaniment of instruments, a direct descendant of the motet and\r\nmadrigal, and of the early oratorios.\r\n\r\nThe Toccata, too, comes from the Italian _toccare_, meaning to touch,\r\nand was originally a work for instruments with keyboards. The Italian\r\nlanguage gave us our musical names and terms, because Italian music was\r\nthe model of what good music should be, and England, France and Germany\r\ncopied Italian ways of composing. Everyone uses the Italian terms for\r\nmusical expressions so that all nationalities can understand them.\r\n\r\nWhen Purcell was only 17 years old, he composed an opera to be played by\r\nyoung ladies in a boarding school. This was _Dido and Æneas_, and it is\r\nso good that few writers on musical subjects believe that it was written\r\nin his youth.\r\n\r\nIn every branch of composition in which Purcell wrote, he excelled. His\r\nchurch music is the finest of his day, his chamber music and his operas\r\nare looked upon as works of genius. In fact, he is still considered the\r\nmost gifted of all English composers.\r\n\r\nHe was only 37 when he died, and was a very great loss to the growth of\r\nEnglish music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Music Comes of Age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n          Dance Tunes Grow Up—Suites—Violin Makers of Cremona\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our range of musical mountains, we see just ahead of us one of the\r\nmightiest giants of them all, Johann Sebastian Bach, dwarfing everything\r\naround it and we must resist the temptation of skipping all the smaller\r\nmountains, for there is no musical aeroplane by means of which we can\r\nfly across and land safely on Mt. Bach. This grand old mountain, Bach,\r\nis such a tremendous landmark in the growth of music, that when we reach\r\nit we realize that everything that we have passed has been a journey of\r\npreparation. Bach is not the only peak, for there are Mozart, Haydn,\r\nBeethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, Wagner and others who stand out\r\nagainst the musical horizon.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to Bach, however, we must bridge over the time when music\r\nwas still in its youth in the 16th and 17th centuries, to when it became\r\nfull grown and mature in the 18th. Music has now come of age: it has\r\nperfected scales, notation, and developed form and instruments; it is\r\nready to go into the world and take its place with painting, sculpture,\r\npoetry, drama and architecture as a full grown art!\r\n\r\nNothing through which music has passed has been lost, but it has been\r\nbuilt like the great Egyptian Pyramids by adding one huge block on top\r\nof another. It has gone from the noise of primitive man with his drum,\r\nto the attempts of the savage to sing and to make crude instruments, to\r\nthe music of the ancient nations in their religious ceremonies and\r\nentertainments, to the Arab singer who handed his art to the western\r\nworld through the troubadours, to the people of all times and nations\r\nwho danced and sang for the joy of it. It passed from the Greek drama\r\nand music schools where definite scales and modes were formed, to the\r\nearly Christian Church which kept it alive during the Dark Ages and\r\ngradually invented ways to write it, and later to the “Golden Age” of\r\nthe Catholic Church. It had seen the rise of schools and the perfection\r\nof the polyphonic system give way to the recitative and the aria, which\r\nin turn brought about opera, oratorio, and instrumental music. It has\r\nseen counterpoint give way to harmony, and yet the growth of music is\r\nnot complete and never will be, but constantly new forms will blossom\r\nout of the old.\r\n\r\nThe 15th and 16th centuries were vocal. The 17th was instrumental and\r\nopened the way for so-called modern music, that is, for Bach’s\r\ncompositions and all that followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BIRTH OF CHAMBER MUSIC\r\n\r\nGabrieli in the 16th century in Venice, sometimes wrote madrigals for\r\ninstruments instead of for voices, and he added instruments to accompany\r\nthe motets and masses (page 157); this led to composing works for groups\r\nof instruments instead of playing madrigals that had been composed for\r\nvoices. The English often wrote on their compositions, “fit for voices\r\nand for viols.” After they once started playing the part songs on viols,\r\nthe composers soon found out that they could write more interesting and\r\nmore difficult things for instruments than they could for voices; this\r\nled to the writing of very florid music for instruments alone. This\r\nflorid part-writing, not unlike the Gloss of the Arabs, and the\r\nimprovisations of the soloists in the early Catholic Church, soon became\r\nso overloaded with trills, fancy turns and runs that it had to be\r\nreformed again.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century, the lute, the popular instrument of the court and\r\nthe home for so many years, even centuries, suddenly found its rival in\r\nthe little keyboard instrument called the _spinet_ and _virginal_ in\r\nEngland, and the _clavecin_ in France. In Italy and France, as in\r\nEngland, there were famous performers and composers for these\r\ninstruments, and many volumes of charming music were written for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DANCE TUNES GROW UP INTO SUITES\r\n\r\nOne of the first requirements of art works of all kinds is contrast. The\r\nline and the curve are found in primitive art, light must have shadow,\r\none wing of a building must have another to balance it, and a slow\r\nserious piece of music is usually followed by a gay one for contrast.\r\nThe Arabs understood this law of contrast, for in their ancient songs we\r\nfind the seed of a form that has been most important in the growth of\r\nmusic. They made little suites by putting two, three, four or more songs\r\ntogether; each song had its mode, and one would be slow and sad, and the\r\nnext fast and gay. The principal music of the 17th century was the\r\nSuite, a group of pieces which had grown out of the old folk dances.\r\n(Chapter IX.) The 17th century composers, like the Arabs, feeling the\r\nneed of contrast, strung several of these dances together to form the\r\nSuite. So Suites were written for clavecins and harpsichords, for\r\nviolins alone and for organs, for groups of stringed instruments and\r\nother chamber music combinations. Some of these dances were in duple\r\ntime, some in triple; some were slow and some were fast; some were\r\nstately and some gay. The different pieces forming a suite, had to be\r\nwritten in the same key. These suites were known by different names in\r\ndifferent countries, such as _partitas_, _exercises_, _lessons_, _sonate\r\nda camera_, _ordres_. In England the name _suite_ was given to this\r\nform, then the Germans adopted it, and later the great Bach wrote suites\r\nwhich he also called _partitas_. In Italy, the suite was called _sonata\r\nda camera_ (chamber sonata) and _sonata da chiesa_ (church sonata) and\r\nout of all this have grown the very important sonata, symphony and\r\nchamber music quartet, trio, quintet, etc.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the dance forms used in the suite:\r\n\r\nAllemande (duple time or measure: moderately slow), Sarabande (triple\r\ntime: slow, stately), Loure (duple time: slow), Gavotte (duple time:\r\nmoderately fast), Musette (duple time: moderately fast), Bourrée (duple\r\ntime: a little faster than the Gavotte), Minuet (triple time: moderately\r\nfast), Passepied (triple time: a fast minuet), Rigaudon (duple time:\r\nslower than the Bourrée), Tambourin (duple time: fast), Pavan (duple\r\ntime: rather slow), Courante, Corrente (triple time: fast), Chaconne\r\n(triple time: moderately fast), Passacaglia (like Chaconne, but more\r\nstately) and Gigue (sometimes duple and sometimes triple time: very\r\nfast: almost always the last movement of a suite).\r\n\r\nThe Italians of the 17th century wrote suites, and Italy still held the\r\nplace as leading the world in musical composition, just as it had in the\r\n15th and 16th. We find the names of Frescobaldi, Michelangelo Rossi,\r\nLegrenzi, Bononcini, Giovanni Battista Vitali, Alessandro Scarlatti and\r\nhis son Domenico, and going over into the seventeen-hundreds, Niccolo\r\nPorpora, Padre Martini, Paradies, and Baldassare Galuppi, whom we know\r\nthrough Robert Browning’s poem, _A Toccata of Galuppi’s_. Most of these\r\nnames you will find on the concert programs of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 “SERIOUS” SCARLATTI AND OPERA WRITERS\r\n\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti (1659–1725) is one of the most important Italian\r\ncomposers of the 17th century, and although he did not have great\r\nsuccess during his lifetime, his compositions have outlived those of\r\nother writers, whose works were popular during his day. He was called\r\n“serious Scarlatti,” and it was probably the very seriousness with which\r\nhe looked upon his work that made him write without seeking public\r\napproval. Besides composing pieces for the spinet and harpsichord, and\r\nsymphonies, sonatas, suites and concertos for different instruments, he\r\nwrote 125 operas, and over 500 cantatas, oratorios and church music. He\r\nwas one of several Italians who continued the work of the first opera\r\nwriters. Francesco Cavalli (1599–1676), Giacomo Carissimi (1603–1674),\r\nLuigi Rossi, Marc Antonio Cesti (1628–1669), Francesco Provenzale\r\n(1610–1704), Stradella (1645–1682), Caldara (1670–1736), Lotti\r\n(1667–1740), Marcello (1686–1739), Leo (1694–1746), and others carried\r\nthe ideas of Scarlatti into the 18th century. Many of these carried\r\nItalian opera into England, Germany and France, where it became the\r\nmodel for _their_ opera.\r\n\r\nStradella is quite as famous for his romantic love story, as he is for\r\nthe operas he left. This made an interesting libretto in the 19th\r\ncentury for a German opera writer, Flotow, who was also the composer of\r\nthe well-known opera _Martha_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   “LA SERVA PADRONA” POINTS THE WAY\r\n\r\nGiovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710–1736), who died when he was only\r\ntwenty-six years old, was looked upon as a genius, and in his early\r\nyouth had written two works that were models for many that followed, a\r\n_Stabat Mater_ and a comic opera, _La Serva Padrona_, which was played\r\nrecently in America under the title of _The Mistress Maid_. When this\r\nlittle opera was performed in Paris (1752) it caused a very famous\r\nmusical quarrel known as the “war of the buffoons.” (Page 230.)\r\n\r\nJomelli (1714–1774), the composer of fifty-five operas, was a Neapolitan\r\nbut he lived in Germany for so many years, that he had more influence on\r\nearly German opera than on the Italian.\r\n\r\nAll the opera of this period, particularly the Italian, was very loosely\r\nput together and was not opera as we have it today. Later Gluck brought\r\nit to the point where it came of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  METASTASIO—MAKER OF OPERA LIBRETTOS\r\n\r\nThese writers of the 18th century used the librettos of a poet and\r\ndramatist, Metastasio (1698–1782), who had a strong influence in the\r\ndevelopment of opera not only in his native Italy, but in other\r\ncountries. He supplied texts for 1200 operatic scores! He understood\r\nmusic so well, that he was a great help to the composers who listened\r\nwith attention to his advice. His life covered practically all of the\r\n18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n               A CELEBRATED SINGING TEACHER AND COMPOSER\r\n\r\nWhen you read of Haydn, you will see that he played accompaniments and\r\nacted as valet to the eminent singing teacher Niccolo Porpora\r\n(1686–1767). This famous Italian had many pupils in the opera houses all\r\nover Europe, and was considered the greatest singing teacher in the\r\nworld. One of his pupils in Dresden was the young princess Marie\r\nAntoinette before she became Queen of France. Porpora was a fine\r\ncomposer, and wrote many operas, cantatas, masses, oratorios, and\r\nsonatas of which form he was one of the inventors. Among his pupils were\r\nHaydn, Marcello, Tartini, Leo, Galuppi, Padre Martini, Jomelli,\r\nPergolesi, Caffarelli and Farinelli. This list shows that he trained\r\ncomposers as well as singers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE VIOLIN MAKERS OF CREMONA\r\n\r\nImportant changes, such as instrumental music coming into fashion, do\r\nnot happen without good reasons. We are so accustomed to the violin,\r\nthat we forget that there was a time when it did not exist, but until\r\nabout three centuries ago, there was none. We are always eager to have\r\nnew pianos, for the old ones wear out, but with violins the older they\r\nare, the better! But they must be masterpieces to begin with. All the\r\nfamous violinists of the day like Kreisler, Elman, Heifetz, etc., have\r\nmarvelous old violins that cost fortunes, and most of them were made by\r\nthe violin makers of Cremona, a little town in northern Italy, the\r\nbirthplace of Monteverde.\r\n\r\nThe troubadours played the accompaniments to their songs on stringed\r\ninstruments called _violes_ or _vielles_, which were the grandparents of\r\nthe violins. In the 15th century bowed instruments were made similar in\r\nrange to the human voice; these were called _treble_ or _discant viol_,\r\n_tenor viol_, _bass viol_ and the _double-bass_, and in England these\r\nwent into the “chest of viols” (Page 198). Many improvements were made\r\nin the shape, size and tone of the instruments and by the middle of the\r\n17th century the Italian makers were ready to create violins, perfect of\r\ntheir kind, which have never been surpassed. The secret of the tone of\r\nthese instruments is said to be in the varnish which the Cremona makers\r\nused, the recipe of which has been lost, but we met a violin maker\r\nrecently in Paris who had discovered it in an old Italian book, and he\r\nhas spent years in trying to reproduce it. The old Italian varnish and\r\nthe mellowing of the wood with time are two reasons why age makes the\r\nold violins better.\r\n\r\nFor several centuries, practically all the lutes and the viols that\r\nsupplied Europe were made by colonies of instrument makers who lived in\r\nLombardy (North Italy) and the Tyrol (South Austria). Two towns in\r\nLombardy became especially famous for their violins, Brescia in which\r\nGaspara di Salo and Maggini lived, and Cremona which was the home of the\r\nAmati, Stradivari and Guarneri families. In _The Orchestra and Its\r\nInstruments_, Esther Singleton says: “It is thrilling to realize that in\r\nthis little town, in three workshops side by side, on the Piazza San\r\nDomenico, all the great violins of the world were made and in friendly\r\ncompetition by the three families.” This covered the period from 1560 to\r\n1760. These men worked together with just one object in life,—to turn\r\nout of their shops the most perfect instruments that could possibly be\r\nmade! With what care they selected the wood! How they worked to make the\r\ntone of each instrument as beautiful as possible! Now you will know when\r\nyou hear of an Amati violin, or a Stradivarius, a Guanerius or a\r\nMaggini, that they are worth their weight in gold and are among the\r\nrarest art treasures of the world. These were not the only violin makers\r\nin Lombardy, for there were long lists of them, and there were also many\r\nin the Tyrol. One of the most famous of these was Stainer who lived at\r\nInnsbruck. “It is said that this old maker used to walk through the\r\nwooded slopes of the Tyrolean mountains with a hammer in his hand and\r\nthat he would knock the trunks of the trees and listen to the\r\nvibrations. When he found a tree that suited him, he had it cut down to\r\nuse in making his instruments.” (Esther Singleton.)\r\n\r\nThese instrument makers made not only violins, but also lutes,\r\nmandolins, guitars, violas, violoncellos, and double-basses. The\r\nItalians were the first to develop the last two. The ’cello, as we call\r\nthe violoncello for short, was the child of an instrument named the\r\n_viola da gamba_ (translated leg-viola because it was held against the\r\nleg), which for many years was the most popular of all bowed\r\ninstruments. We do not find many examples of the instruments even in\r\nmuseums for they were made over into ’cellos when the latter came into\r\nfashion. There is one _viola da gamba_ in the Metropolitan Museum of\r\nArt, however, which was imported from France by the Sisterhood of the\r\nGeneral Hospital in Montreal before the conquest of Canada, and was used\r\nin the convent choir many years before there were any organs and pianos\r\nin the New World. The first ’cello to attract attention was made in 1691\r\nby a famous wood carver and presented to the Duke of Modena. A member of\r\nthe Amati family in the 16th century was the first to turn the _viola da\r\ngamba_ into a violoncello. The ’cello and the double-bass were made more\r\nsuccessfully by Bergonzi than by the Cremona makers, although Maggini,\r\nAmati and Galiano made very fine ones.\r\n\r\nThe viola is a descendant of the _viola d’amore_. These and the later\r\nviolas, used in the string quartets, orchestras, and as solo\r\ninstruments, were made by a Tyrolese named Gaspard Duiffaprugcar in the\r\n16th century. His instruments are marvelous works of art. In the back of\r\none is a riddle in Latin: can you guess the answer? “I was living in the\r\nforest; the cruel axe killed me. Living, I was mute; dead, I sing\r\nsweetly.” When madrigals and motets were first played on stringed\r\ninstruments, the principal melody was given to the tenor viol, the\r\nancestor of the viola, even today called the alto or the tenor, but\r\nafter the violin came into general use, the viola was treated like a\r\nstep-child, for it is too large for a violin and too small for a\r\nvioloncello. We have Mozart to thank for discovering that the viola had\r\nsomething beautiful and important to say as a solo instrument especially\r\nin passages where he needed a tender, sad or melancholy voice. You will\r\nread later that Beethoven, too, loved the poor neglected viola. He,\r\nBerlioz and Wagner used the instrument to great advantage.\r\n\r\nIn 1572 Pope Pius V sent Charles IX, King of France, a present of\r\nthirty-eight bowed instruments made by the first Amati. During the\r\nFrench Revolution, the mob broke into the palace at Versailles, and all\r\nbut two violins and a ’cello were destroyed! What a loss to art such\r\ndestruction was!\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SHOWING OFF THE NEW INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nWith this development of exquisite instruments, came the desire to use\r\nthem and to write new compositions to show them off. These instruments\r\ngave unlimited possibilities for technic and tone, and created the\r\nschool of Italian violinists and composers of the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies. If polyphonic music had still been in the lead, the\r\ndevelopment of solo instruments would have been impossible, but in\r\ntrying to find new forms, the first opera inventors had broken the\r\nbackbone of polyphony, and had replaced it with monody, or single line\r\nmelody. Then, too, folk dances had taken the public fancy and had been\r\nmade into suites, which could be played on solo bowed instruments with\r\naccompaniments, on spinets and organs, or on groups of instruments. The\r\n_sonata da camera_ was really a suite of dances and was the first form\r\nused by these new composers for violin. About the middle of the 17th\r\ncentury, instrumental performances without any vocal music came to be a\r\npart of the services of the Catholic Church for the priests were quick\r\nto see in the violin playing, a refining influence. Here the _sonata da\r\ncamera_ or “room sonata” was turned into the more serious _sonata da\r\nchiesa_ or “church sonata” gradually losing its dance character, and\r\nthus became the seed of the sonata form of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Battista Vitali (1644–1692) is the first great master of the\r\nviolin sonata; after him, Torelli (1657–1716) added a new and important\r\nkind of violin composition,—the Concerto. He called his compositions,\r\n_Concerti da Camera_ and _Concerti Grossi_, which names and form were\r\nused by Vivaldi, Corelli, Handel and Bach. This _Concerto Grosso_ was a\r\n_sonata da chiesa_ accompanied not by a single instrument as was the\r\nhabit with the _sonata da chiesa_ and the _sonata da camera_, but by a\r\ngroup of bowed instruments to which a lute, organ and, later, a\r\nharpsichord were added.\r\n\r\nAt this time, all musicians were, as a matter of course, violinists,\r\njust as today all great composers can play the piano. One of the\r\ngreatest of these composer-violinists was Arcangelo Corelli (1653–1713),\r\nwhose works are often played by violinists of our own time, and have\r\nserved as models for composers. He was one of the first to try to write\r\nmusic that should show off the beauty and possibilities of the violin.\r\n\r\nThe “Golden Age” of the Italian violin composers dated from 1720 to\r\n1750, and was the time of Locatelli, Pugnani, Nardini, Veracini, Tartini\r\nand Vivaldi who added oboes and horns to the orchestral accompaniment of\r\nthe _Concerti Grossi_. Corelli and Vivaldi were the models used by the\r\nGerman school of violinists who appeared about this time. Tartini was\r\nthe musical authority of his century, and no violinist felt sure of his\r\nplace as an artist until he had been heard and approved by Tartini. He\r\nwas the composer of the famous piece called _The Devil’s Trill_.\r\nAlthough Vivaldi was not looked upon with great esteem in his own time,\r\nhe was used as a model by Johann Sebastian Bach.\r\n\r\nPadre Martini, recognized by all Europe as the greatest authority on\r\nmusical subjects, lived in Bologna where he was visited by such\r\nmusicians as Grétry, Gluck, Mozart and one of the sons of Bach. Padre,\r\nor Father, Martini was a Franciscan monk, a fine composer, a learned\r\nhistorian, a master of counterpoint, and the owner of a musical library\r\nof 17,000 volumes! He helped everyone who sought him, and was loved by\r\nthe entire musical world.\r\n\r\nOnce a year a great music festival was held in Bologna by the\r\nPhilharmonic Society and new works by the Bolognese composers were\r\nperformed. One hundred musicians took part in the orchestra and the\r\nchoruses, and each composer conducted his own work. It was an honor to\r\nbe present at this annual festival, and Italian and foreign musicians\r\ncame from all over Europe to attend it. Young composers sometimes became\r\nfamous over night here, for the critics were all invited and serious\r\ndecisions were made as to the value of new music. Dr. Burney, a famous\r\nEnglish musical historian of the 18th century, tells of meeting Leopold\r\nMozart and his young son, Wolfgang Amadeus, at one of these festivals.\r\nThrough the kind scheming of Padre Martini were they admitted!\r\n\r\nRome, in the 18th century was still the great music center, and guided\r\nthe religious music of the world. It had wonderful collections of old\r\nmusic which attracted students from all over; it had seven or eight very\r\nfamous theatres, where _opera seria_ and _opera buffa_ were given.\r\n(Today we call them grand opera and comic opera.) The Roman public was\r\nvery difficult to please and because of the severity of their judgments,\r\nopera writers suffered every time their new works had first\r\nperformances. Just think how you would feel if you had composed an\r\nopera, and by accident had put in a melody that sounded something like\r\none that Mozart, Wagner, Puccini or Verdi had composed, if the whole\r\nhouse should break into shouts of “Bravo, Mozart!” or “Bravo, Wagner!”\r\nor “Bravo, Puccini!!” etc. This is what used to happen in Rome, but no\r\ndoubt it was a good thing because it stopped a habit the composers had\r\nin those days, of helping themselves to each other’s melodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DOMENICO SCARLATTI\r\n\r\nBut here we must pause for a moment to tell you of the life and work of\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti’s son, Domenico, who was born in Naples in 1685,\r\nthe same year as Bach and Handel. When you recall how many operas the\r\nfather wrote, it seems queer that his son did not follow in his\r\nfootsteps. The truth is that he did write operas for the private theatre\r\nof the Queen of Poland in Rome, and also sacred music while he was\r\nchapel master of St. Peter’s, but he became immortal as a composer of\r\nharpsichord music. In the influence he had in the growing up of piano\r\nmusic, he can be compared to Chopin and Liszt, and is a founder of piano\r\nmusic style, an honor, which he shares with the French Couperin and\r\nRameau, his contemporaries. The difference is that the two Frenchmen\r\nhave a delicacy and grace that recall their period of wigs and satins\r\nand laces, while Scarlatti’s works have strength, vigor and daring that\r\ntake them out of any special period and place them beside the great\r\npiano compositions of all time.\r\n\r\nScarlatti’s sonatas are sonatas in the Italian sense of a _sound-piece_;\r\nthey are not, like the suites, in several movements, but each is in one\r\nmovement, which forecasts the modern sonata form with its two main\r\ncontrasting themes and development.\r\n\r\nThe “serious Scarlatti” understood his son’s talent, for he sent him at\r\nthe age of 20 to Florence to a member of the powerful de Medici family\r\nwith this letter: “This son of mine is an eagle whose wings are grown;\r\nhe ought not to stay idle in the nest, and I ought not to hinder his\r\nflight.”\r\n\r\nThree years later Handel and Scarlatti met in Rome in an organ and\r\nharpsichord competition, and while Handel won as organist, even\r\nScarlatti declaring that he did not know that such playing existed, no\r\ndecision was made as to which was the better harpsichord player. This\r\ncontest seems to have caused no hard feelings for the two young men of\r\nthe same age became devoted friends.\r\n\r\nScarlatti had a trick of crossing his hands in his compositions. Who\r\ndoes not remember with joy his first piece in which he had to cross his\r\nhands? But sad to relate as he grew old, he became so fat that he could\r\nno longer cross hands with comfort, so in the last compositions the\r\ncrossing of hands is noticeably absent!\r\n\r\nIt is hard to know where an inspiration is next coming from, but\r\nwouldn’t you be surprised were you a composer, if your pet cat presented\r\nyou with a perfectly good theme? This happened to Domenico Scarlatti!\r\nHis cat walked across the keyboard, and the composer used his musical\r\nfoot prints as the subject of a very fine fugue! Maybe Zez Confrey’s\r\n_Kitten on the Keys_ is a descendant of this pussy’s piece.\r\n\r\nThe Scarlattis were the last of the great Italian instrumental\r\ncomposers. For two centuries Italy had been the generous dispenser of\r\nculture, and like an unselfish mother had sent her children out into the\r\nworld to carry knowledge and works to all the nations of Europe. The sun\r\nof Italy’s greatness was setting just as it began to rise in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n  Opera in France—Lully and Rameau—Clavecin and Harpsichord Composers\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left French Opera in 1600 when Henry IV married Marie de’ Medici.\r\nBallets which resembled the English masques had been performed when Baif\r\nand his friends had produced _Le Ballet Comique de la Reine_, but no\r\nreal opera had yet been written in France. In 1645, Cardinal Mazarin,\r\nthe powerful Italian prime minister of France, invited a company of\r\nItalian singers to give a performance of Peri’s _Euridice_ in Paris. The\r\nFrench did not like the opera, as they said it sounded too much like\r\nplain song and airs from the cloister, and yet it led to Abbé Perrin’s\r\nwriting a work in 1658 which he called the _Pastoral_, and for which a\r\ncomposer named Cambert wrote the music. The _Pastoral_ was a very great\r\nsuccess, and was repeated by order of Louis XIV, King of France. Ten\r\nyears later, Louis gave Perrin and Cambert permission “to establish\r\nthroughout the kingdom academies of opera, or representations with music\r\nin the French language after the manner of those in Italy.” Their next\r\nwork, _Pomone_, was the first opera performed publicly in an opera\r\nhouse, built purposely in Paris for them. The opera was so\r\nenthusiastically received, that it ran nightly for eight months, and the\r\ncrowds were so great, that the police had to be called out. This\r\ncombination of poet and composer came to an end with _Pomone_, and a new\r\nman acquired the right to give opera in the new opera house. This man\r\nwas Jean Baptiste Lully or in Italian, Giovanni Battista Lulli\r\n(1632–1687).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LULLY THE KING’S FAVORITE\r\n\r\nYou may hear that the first famous opera writer of France had been a\r\npastry cook or kitchen boy, but no matter how humble his start in life,\r\nhe rose to the highest social position ever reached up to that time by a\r\ncomposer in France. He became a great favorite of Louis XIV, he was\r\ncovered with titles and honors, he was on friendly terms with all the\r\nnobility of the court, he was musical dictator of the opera and in fact\r\nof all the musical happenings of the court. The greatest literary\r\ngeniuses of the period, such as Molière, Racine, La Fontaine, Quinault,\r\nCorneille and Boileau, worked with him when he wanted new librettos for\r\nhis operas. He paid dearly for all his privileges, because his fellow\r\ncomposers were jealous of his genius and his opportunities, and they\r\nlost no chance to blacken his character.\r\n\r\nLully was born in Florence, Italy, in 1632, but we can tell you little\r\nor nothing of his parentage or of his childhood. A monk taught him a\r\nlittle about music and how to play the guitar. When he was about twelve\r\nyears old, he was picked up by the Duke de Guise who saw him with a\r\ngroup of traveling comedians, and was so attracted by his vivacity, his\r\nsinging and talent for mimicry, that he took him back to Paris, where he\r\nplaced him in the household of his cousin, Mlle. de Montpensier. In her\r\nmemoirs, Mademoiselle said that she had been studying Italian and had\r\nasked her cousin to bring back from Tuscany where he lived, a little\r\nItalian _garçon de la Chambre_, a sort of personal errand boy. However,\r\nhis guitar playing and musical gifts soon lifted him out of a servant’s\r\nposition and he became one of the musicians of the great lady’s\r\nhousehold playing at concerts, balls and in the ballets. He learned to\r\nplay the violin, and soon began to compose popular dances. He remained a\r\nmember of Mademoiselle’s household until he was nineteen when he asked\r\npermission to leave her service, as she had moved to the country, and he\r\nliked the gay life of Paris better.\r\n\r\nHe had no difficulty in attaching himself to the King’s court, first as\r\nactor and dancer in the ballets, and soon as “composer of instrumental\r\nmusic.” Louis XIV was only fourteen years old, and was evidently highly\r\nentertained by the capers of the young Italian who was willing to play\r\nany rôle, dance any kind of a dance, or play the violin “divinely” for\r\nhis young monarch’s amusement. The King remained Lully’s faithful friend\r\nalways. Louis loved music, and played the lute, the guitar, the\r\nharpsichord, and sang very well. Feeling that he needed to know more,\r\nLully studied counterpoint, composition and learned to play the\r\nharpsichord, and whatever he attempted musically, he acquired without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIn 1656, Lully composed music for a scene in a ballet, _Psyche_, and\r\nfrom that time on, his compositions became the most popular of any at\r\ncourt. Although he was born an Italian, his music was French, and he\r\neven shared the French dislike of the Italian opera. In spite of his\r\nlove of acting in the ballets, of dancing, and of courting social favor\r\nwith the King and nobles, Lully was a thorough musician. When he went\r\ninto music he found that few of the singers could read notes, but they\r\nlearned their parts by ear. He soon changed this, and by the time he\r\ndied, all singers and players of orchestral instruments could read well.\r\nIn this reform, he did a great service to the growth of music.\r\n\r\nHis first stage works were called comedy-ballets. One of his early works\r\nwas ballet music written for a performance of Cavalli’s opera, _Xerxes_,\r\nwhich was performed upon Mazarin’s invitation at Versailles (1660). He\r\nnext was given the position of “Superintendent of Music,” became a\r\nnaturalized French citizen, and was married. Lully wrote 19 ballets, 12\r\ncomedy-ballets, and 18 operas, besides about 23 motets for special\r\noccasions. His ballets included recitatives, airs, dialogues and\r\nsymphonies, which was the name given to music written for orchestra.\r\nFrom 1672 until the time of his death in 1687, he wrote an opera a year,\r\nand sometimes two!\r\n\r\nThe splendor and extravagance of the costuming and stage settings of\r\nthese ballets and operas of Lully are almost unbelievable! At times,\r\neven the orchestra wore costumes of the period represented on the stage.\r\nLully conducted the orchestra for one opera in a magnificent Egyptian\r\ndress. Louis XIV loved these elaborate performances, and took part in\r\nsome of them.\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of Perrin and Cambert, which many said was caused by\r\nLully, he became absolute ruler in all musical matters. He used his\r\npower to close a rival opera house, and no opera could be given anywhere\r\nin France without his permission, for which he received a sum of money.\r\nHe was such a tyrant that he had many enemies, some of whom tried to\r\npoison his snuff, in order to get rid of the King’s favorite.\r\n\r\n“Le Roi Soleil” (The Sun King), as Louis XIV was called, had to be\r\nentertained, and Lully understood so well how to keep him amused, that\r\nthe King could not get along without his composer whose performances\r\ndazzled all beholders!\r\n\r\nYou must read French history of that period in order to understand just\r\nhow gorgeous and how extravagant life at the palace of Versailles was\r\nand how eventually it led to the revolt of the people and the French\r\nRevolution. Or perhaps you have seen the elaborate gardens, fountains\r\nand palace,—a playground built at fearful cost where the Kings of France\r\nmight forget their cares! The King went so far as to give Lully a post\r\nof royal secretary, usually held by nobles. It is said that his only\r\nclaim to the position was that he made people laugh!\r\n\r\nIn 1681, his ballet _Triomphe de l’Amour_ (Triumph of Love) was given,\r\nin which, for the first time, women instead of men danced. Indeed,\r\nladies of the nobility took part in the ballet!\r\n\r\nThe French Overture introduced by Lully, was in two parts or\r\nmovements,—the first slow and serious, the second by way of contrast\r\nfast, and bringing in the contrapuntal style of the church composers;\r\nsometimes a third part resembling the first was added. These overtures\r\nwere very much liked in Lully’s time and during the 18th century, and\r\nwas the form used by the German composers in their orchestral suites and\r\nby Handel. Lully was very successful in composing military music, and\r\nhis military marches were used not only by the French army, but by the\r\narmies marching _against_ France. All of his music is simple and clear\r\nin outline, it is easy to remember, its rhythm is vigorous and definite,\r\nand the people, as well as musicians of his day, loved and understood\r\nit. One writer said that one of his songs from _Amadis_, an opera\r\n(1684), “was sung by every cook in France and Lully would stop his\r\ncarriage on the Pont Neuf (the New Bridge across the Seine) to set some\r\npoor fiddler right who was playing one of his airs.” His works reached\r\nItaly, Germany, England, Holland and Flanders, and influenced many of\r\nthe composers like Purcell, Humphrey and Handel to say nothing of the\r\nFrench composers who followed him.\r\n\r\nLully built up the orchestra, and used the different groups of\r\ninstruments in entirely new ways.\r\n\r\nLully died in 1687 as the result of having dropped the stick with which\r\nhe directed his orchestra on his foot. This does not sound possible, but\r\nthe baton used in his time was very large and heavy, and the accident\r\ncaused blood poisoning. He was very much missed, for there was no one\r\nwith his talent for conducting and disciplining the singers and dancers\r\nto replace him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RAMEAU\r\n\r\nIn 1683, was born another French composer who carried on the work that\r\nLully had begun, a work so much loved by the French public, that Jean\r\nPhilippe Rameau found as strong a rival in the dead Lully as his\r\ncontemporaries had in the living. Rameau’s father was organist of a\r\nchurch at Dijon, and although the family was very poor, the father was\r\ndetermined to give his three children a musical education, and began to\r\nteach them before they could read. As a result of this early training\r\nlittle Jean Philippe, when he was only seven years old, could play at\r\nsight on the harpsichord any music put before him, and when he was sent\r\nto school, he was very unruly and sang out loud in class or scribbled\r\nmusic all over his papers instead of doing his lessons.\r\n\r\nWhen he was eighteen, he went to Italy, but as he did not like the\r\nmusic, he left. He was always headstrong and self-willed, and this was\r\none of the hasty decisions for which he was afterwards sorry. He\r\ntraveled from place to place on this journey, playing his way as he\r\nwent, on the organ in churches and the violin in a band of traveling\r\nmusicians. In the south of France, old Provence, the home of the\r\ntroubadours, he became organist at Clermont, and lived quietly for six\r\nyears. Here he wrote his first pieces for clavecin (spinet) and three\r\ncantatas. (The cantata was a new form which came from Italy, and was a\r\nsmall opera to be sung in a drawing-room.) When Rameau grew tired of his\r\nwork as organist at Clermont, he showed his discontent by playing as\r\nbadly as he possibly could, by using untuneful organ-stops and by\r\nplaying fearful discords. An attempt was made to shut him off but he\r\npaid no attention until a choir boy was sent to him with a message,\r\nwhereupon he left the organ and walked out of the church. He finally\r\nsucceeded in making the directors give him his release, but before many\r\nyears he returned to his old post, and was taken back in spite of his\r\ndisagreeable temper, and so proud was Clermont of its organist, that his\r\nchair is still kept and exhibited.\r\n\r\nFrom Clermont he went to Paris where he studied with the organist\r\nMarchand, and read the old books of musical theory such as Zarlino’s,\r\nfor Rameau during his career wrote five important books on musical\r\ntheory and harmony. He was the first to establish definitely the classic\r\nprinciples of harmony, and to put them into a form that for many years\r\nwas used by all students. You must remember that up to the 17th century,\r\ncounterpoint was the chief study, but when Italian opera succeeded in\r\nbreaking down the polyphonic habit, a new science had to be made to\r\nexplain the new system of _chords_ that had been gradually built up by\r\nthe Italians and also by Luther and his chorals. This was the _science\r\nof harmony_, and Rameau’s _Treatise of Music, containing the Principles\r\nof Composition_ (1722), was one of the first books of its kind.\r\n\r\nUntil Rameau was fifty, he was known as an organist, a teacher of\r\ncomposition and a writer of many charming works for harpsichord and\r\nclavecin. He married a young singer when he was 43, and the year after,\r\nhe made the acquaintance of a wealthy patron of the arts, at whose house\r\nhe met artists, literary men, princes and embassadors. Rameau taught his\r\npatron’s wife, and had the use of his organ and private orchestra. Here\r\nhe first found himself among friends who understood and appreciated his\r\ntalents; here he met the great French writer, Voltaire, and the Abbé\r\nPellegrin, both of whom wrote librettos for his operas. There is a tale\r\nthat the Abbé made the composer sign an agreement about payment for the\r\nuse of his book but after hearing the first rehearsal he tore it up—so\r\npleased was he with Rameau’s first opera, _Hippolyte et Aricie_ (1733).\r\nNow Rameau met the jealousy of Lully’s followers, who tried to prevent\r\nthe success of the work. They hissed it and wrote slighting verse about\r\nit:\r\n\r\n                 If difficulties beauty show,\r\n                 Then what a great man is Rameau.\r\n                 If beauty, though, by chance should be\r\n                 But nature’s own simplicity,\r\n                 Then what a small man is Rameau!—\r\n\r\n(Frederick H. Martens’ translation of _A History of Music_ by Paul\r\nLandormy.)\r\n\r\nIt is curious how often a new style in music has been greeted with just\r\nsuch criticism and prejudice as the “Lullyists” showed for Rameau’s\r\nopera! They claimed that the work was not French, that he used strange\r\nchords, that his music was too difficult to be understood! In fact they\r\nsaid exactly the same things that are said today about new works which\r\nare different from what the public is used to hearing. Voltaire said\r\nthat it takes a whole generation for the human ear to grow familiar with\r\na new musical style!\r\n\r\nHis third opera, _Castor and Pollux_, in 1737, was his first real\r\nsuccess. With this work, he became famous, and was regarded as France’s\r\ngreatest composer. An English noble in Paris at the time stated “that\r\nalthough everyone was abusing Rameau’s ‘horrible’ work, yet it was\r\nimpossible to get a seat at the opera.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Rameau brought nothing new to opera, he was the step between\r\nthe Lully traditions and the innovators who came with Gluck. The French\r\ncomposers today turn to him in their search for the direct road along\r\nwhich French music has traveled.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Rameau’s unfriendly reserved nature, he won fame by force of\r\nhis genius. He was as unlike Lully as two men could possibly have been.\r\nRameau accepted favors from no one, and was generous in his attitude\r\ntowards his fellow composers. He talked very little and was not popular.\r\nHowever, he was at the height of his career, when a company of Italian\r\nsingers arrived in Paris (1752), and played _La Serva Padrona_ by\r\nPergolesi. The fresh sparkling little opera took Paris by storm, and\r\nthis was the beginning of a sharp fight known as the war of the buffoons\r\n(page 330), which divided Paris into two factions,—those who stood by\r\nLully and Rameau, and those who wanted to see French opera replaced by\r\nthe new Italian comic opera.\r\n\r\n“The charm of these light operas,” says Mary Hargrave in her little\r\nbook, _The Earlier French Musicians_, “lay in the simplicity of their\r\nsubjects, taken from scenes and persons in ordinary life, humorously\r\ntreated. They came as a delightful relief after the stilted classical\r\nheroes and heroines, the threadbare episodes of gods and goddesses, the\r\nGreek and Roman warriors in tunics, with ribbons and helmets on powdered\r\nwigs, in short, all the artificial conventions of which people had at\r\nlast grown unutterably weary.”\r\n\r\nEven the court was divided: Louis XV was on the side of French music,\r\nbut the Queen was for the Italian, and crowds gathered nightly at the\r\nopera near the royal boxes, which were known as the “King’s corner,” and\r\nthe “Queen’s corner.” Word bombshells were thrown from one camp into the\r\nother, and sometimes these became real insults! Poor Rameau! First he\r\nwas the butt of the Lullyists because he was too modern, and now storms\r\nof abuse were heaped on his head because he was too old-fashioned!\r\nNevertheless, to the end of his life his operas were received with great\r\nenthusiasm, and on one occasion when the old man of eighty was seen\r\nhiding in the corner of a box during one of his operas, he was called\r\nout with storms of applause. He was always very shy about appearing in\r\npublic, applause embarrassed him, and no doubt much of his\r\ndisagreeableness was due to his being bashful.\r\n\r\nRameau looked upon his scientific studies as more important than his\r\ncomposing, and Bach, Handel and many other composers studied his theory\r\nwork even when they were not great admirers of his compositions. We\r\nnever hear his operas, but his lovely pieces for the harpsichord, many\r\nof which are out of his operas, are played in piano recitals and are\r\nunsurpassed as examples of the French dance suite. Following the fashion\r\nof his time, he gave his pieces amusing titles such as _The Call of the\r\nBirds_, _The Hen_, _The Whirlwinds_, _The Egyptian_.\r\n\r\nA list of his works show that he wrote 26 operas, 2 cantatas, 5 books on\r\ntheory, and 4 volumes of harpsichord music.\r\n\r\nHis death occurred in 1764, and all France mourned their “greatest\r\ncomposer” and for years held memorial services in his honor.\r\n\r\nPiron, a French writer, said of him: “All his mind and all his soul were\r\nin his harpsichord and when he had closed that, the house was empty,\r\nthere was no one at home.”\r\n\r\n\r\n             FRENCH COMPOSERS FOR CLAVECIN AND HARPSICHORD\r\n\r\nIn every collection of French instrumental music of the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies, besides the names of Lully and Rameau, we find Jacques\r\nChampion de Chambonnières (1600–1670), Jean Baptiste Loeilly, or\r\nLoeillet (?–1728?), François Couperin (1668–1733), Jean François\r\nDandrieu (1684–1740), Jean Louis Marchand (1669–1733), Louis Claude\r\nDaquin (1694–1772) and Schobert (1720–1768).\r\n\r\nThese writers for clavecin and harpsichord of the French school were the\r\nfirst to write music for instruments to which they gave names describing\r\nthe nature of the compositions. So, now, in addition to the names of\r\ndances which formed the suites, we find _The Coucou_, _Butterflies_,\r\n_Tambourine_, _The Windmill_, _The Turtle-Doves_, and so on. This was an\r\nimportant step for it led directly to the kind of titles given to piano\r\npieces in the 19th century by the German romantic school.\r\n\r\nThe most important of this group was François Couperin, called “the\r\ngreat,” as he was the most gifted member of a family, who supplied\r\nFrance with musicians for two centuries. From 1665 to 1826, there were\r\neight Couperins who were organists of St. Gervais’ Church in Paris.\r\n\r\nWe can compare the Couperin family to the Bachs who flourished at the\r\nsame time in Germany. François (1668–1733), was only a year old when his\r\nfather died, but a friend, who was an organist, taught him and in time\r\nhe, too, became organist at St. Gervais. He was harpsichord player to\r\nthe King, and was a favorite in court circles. No fashionable affair was\r\ncomplete without Couperin at the harpsichord, and every Sunday evening\r\nhe played chamber music for Louis XIV, the royal patron of Lully. One of\r\nthe books of pieces for the clavecin was published under the title of\r\n_Royal Concerts_, and in the preface, Couperin told that they were\r\nwritten for “_les petits concerts du roi_” (the little concerts of the\r\nking), and he also said that he hoped the public would like the pieces\r\nas much as the King did. For twenty years Couperin played in the King’s\r\nhousehold, and taught several princes and princesses.\r\n\r\nYou know the old proverb, “All roads lead to Rome.” We would change it,\r\nand say that all roads lead to Bach! And Couperin is one of the main\r\nhighways, for without knowing that he was doing so, he prepared the way\r\nfor Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Everything he wrote, and most of\r\nhis pieces were in the dance form of the suite, was exquisite in\r\nrefinement and taste. The French musicians of today look upon him as one\r\nof their composers, most truly French, and they try to follow in the way\r\nhe led, so as to be able to write music that will express the French\r\npeople, in heart and character. Later in the story of music, the German\r\nclassic school and then the romantic school had a very strong influence\r\non the music of every country in the world, and in France there was the\r\ndesire to brush aside the outside influences, and to find the road that\r\nthe early French composers of the 17th and 18th centuries had traveled.\r\nPaul Landormy, a French writer on musical history has summed up Couperin\r\nas “one of the miracles of the French spirit in music, and across the\r\ngulf of time he clasps hands on one side with Jannequin and Costeley (p.\r\n437), on the other with Fauré and Debussy” (p. 416).\r\n\r\nAll the important music outside of opera written in France at this time\r\nwas for the clavecin and harpsichord, and if the flute or the viol was\r\ninvited to take part in a concert, it was only to double the melody\r\nplayed by the harpsichord, and did not have a part especially created\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nWouldn’t you be surprised today if you should see an announcement of a\r\nconcert to be given by the President’s chauffeurs? But in the time of\r\nCouperin and Lully wind instruments were used in all the court\r\nfestivals, balls and ballets, and were played by men attached to the\r\ngreat hunting stables of the king. The band was called _la musique de la\r\ngrande écurie du Roi_ (music of the King’s stables). There were twelve\r\ntrumpets, eight fifes and drums, the cromornes (krumhorn—a curved reed\r\ninstrument), four to six Poitou oboes and bagpipes, and twelve large\r\noboes under which title were included violins, oboes, sackbuts and\r\ncornets. These players of wind instruments accompanied the royal hunting\r\nparties and made the beautiful forests of France ring with their merry\r\nmusic. Each family had its own hunting call, by which it was recognized\r\nfrom afar. We heard a phonograph record in Paris of these ancient calls,\r\nand with each one, the name of the family to whom it belonged was\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nBy the way, do you know the difference between a band and an orchestra?\r\n(This is not a conundrum!) A band was originally a group of musicians\r\nwho played while standing or marching, while the orchestra was always\r\nseated. This word comes from the Greek word meaning dance, and was first\r\ngiven to a group of players who accompanied the dancers in the dramas,\r\nand were seated in that section of the theatre which is still called the\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n            Germany Enters—Organs, Organists and Organ Works\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is rather hard to believe that the largest of all instruments, the\r\npipe organ, is a descendant of Pan’s Pipes, played by the shepherds on\r\nthe hillsides of ancient Greece, is it not? The pipes of the church\r\norgan of today are of different lengths and are built on the same\r\nprinciple as were the pipes of Pan, our goat-footed friend, who broke\r\noff the reeds by the bank of a stream way back when the world was young,\r\nto pour out his grief in music for his lost love, Syrinx.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to supply the organ pipes with wind so they could be\r\nmade to produce tones without blowing on each one separately. A wooden\r\nbox was invented, and each pipe inserted into a hole in the top of the\r\nbox, which is still called the wind-chest. At first this was supplied\r\nwith air by two attendants who blew into tubes attached to the\r\nwind-chest. Soon the tubes were replaced by bellows, and were worked\r\nwith the arms, and as the instrument grew larger, with the feet like in\r\na treadmill. An organ is spoken of in the Talmud as having stood in the\r\nTemple of Jerusalem, and the hydraulic (water) organ in which air was\r\nsupplied to the pipes by means of water power was built in Alexandria,\r\nEgypt, about the year 250 B.C. The small organ with keys that could be\r\ncarried from place to place was called a portative (from the Latin\r\n_porto_—to carry); the larger organ sometimes stationary and sometimes\r\nmoved on wheels was called a positive. The levers needed to produce the\r\nsound were soon exchanged for keyboards which at first had only a few\r\nkeys, and you may remember our telling how the keys were pounded with\r\nthe fists and elbows, in the Winchester organ.\r\n\r\nA Greek writer of the 4th century A.D. gives us a vivid description of\r\nan organ: “I see a strange sort of reeds—they must methinks have sprung\r\nfrom no earthly, but a brazen soil. Wild are they, nor does the breath\r\nof man stir them, but a blast, leaping forth from a cavern of oxhide,\r\npasses within, beneath the roots of the polished reeds.”\r\n\r\nIt is not known just when the organ was first used in the churches, but\r\nthere are records of its having been known in Spanish churches as early\r\nas the 5th century A.D. Pope Vitalian introduced it in Rome in 666, and\r\nin the 8th century in England, organ-building became a very popular\r\nprofession. Cecil Forsyth says: “In those days a monk or bishop who\r\nwished to stand well with society could not take up essay-writing or\r\nsocial-welfare: what he could do was to lay hands on all the available\r\ntimber, metal, and leather, and start organ-building.”\r\n\r\nPepin, the father of Charlemagne, imported an organ into Compiègne,\r\nFrance, from Byzantium in the 8th century. Charlemagne had it copied at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. The Arabians must have been organ-builders, too, for\r\none of their most famous rulers, Haroun-al-Raschid, sent Charlemagne a\r\npneumatic organ noted for its soft tone. The instruments made in Germany\r\nand France up to the 10th century were small and unpretending, but were\r\nobjects of astonishment and curiosity.\r\n\r\nIn Magdeburg, in the 11th century, we find the first keyboard with keys\r\n3 inches broad. In 1120, we hear of an organ in the Netherlands that had\r\n2 manuals (keyboards) and pedals. Organ-building was growing up! In the\r\n14th century the manuals of many organs had 31 keys.\r\n\r\nThe organ was not always accepted in the church, for in the 13th century\r\nits use was regarded as scandalous just as the English Puritans in the\r\n17th century called it a “squeaking abomination,” and it is not even now\r\nadmitted in the Greek Catholic Church!\r\n\r\nUntil the 14th century, the organ had been used only in a most primitive\r\nway to guide the singers of plain-song. It became a solo instrument when\r\nit was possible to grade its tone from soft to loud, which was done by\r\nthe invention and use of three manuals: the upper one played “_full\r\norgan_” (very loud); the middle, the _discant_ (softest), played a\r\ncounterpoint to the subject; the subject was played on the lowest\r\nkeyboard.\r\n\r\nSo we see how one invention led to another until the organ became an\r\ninstrument of almost unlimited possibilities, and how keyed instruments\r\nhad shown the composers how to develop music along new lines. By the end\r\nof the 16th century, organ compositions and organ-playing had made rapid\r\nprogress all over Europe, and you will recall the great organists in all\r\nthe churches and cathedrals in the Netherlands, in England, Italy,\r\nFrance, Spain, and even in Germany which up to this time had not been on\r\nthe “musical map.” (Chapter XI).\r\n\r\nAre you wondering why we have gone back into “ancient history” at this\r\npoint, or have you already discovered that these grand old organists are\r\nleading us directly Bach-ward?\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FRESCOBALDI\r\n\r\nJust a century before Bach’s time, the greatest of all Italian\r\norganists, Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583–1644), was born at Ferrara, Italy.\r\nSo popular was he, that he filled the vast Cathedral of St. Peter’s,\r\nwhenever he played. His compositions were the most important produced\r\nfor organ in the early 17th century, and his fugues were the first to be\r\ntreated in modern fashion, in form, fancy, and feeling for tone color,\r\nand were a foundation on which Bach’s were built. His compositions\r\ninclude _canzones_, _toccatas_, _ricercari_, and numerous pieces in the\r\npopular dance forms. Most of these are found in two collections\r\npublished for _cembalo e organo_ (spinet and organ). He was not\r\ninterested in opera, but went his own musical way expressing himself in\r\nan original and individual language far ahead of his period. With\r\nFrescobaldi, Italy ceased to be the world’s center for organists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GERMAN ORGANISTS\r\n\r\nAt this point, Germany came into the musical field, and soon became the\r\nartistic center of organ-playing. Up to this time, the country had\r\nproduced less music than any of its neighbors: Italy had written the\r\ngreatest Church music, and invented opera; France had followed closely\r\nin Italy’s footsteps; the Low Countries had helped in music’s growth by\r\ntheir early work in polyphony and had taught all Europe including\r\nGermany; England had led the world in her compositions for virginals and\r\nharpsichord, the forerunners of piano music. Although Germany did not at\r\nfirst rank musically with these countries, the religious fervor and\r\ndevotion to the cause of Protestantism bore fruit in the grand chorales\r\nof Luther. In these we find the birth of German music destined to rule\r\nthe world for two centuries, the 18th and the 19th, just as the Italian\r\nhad in the 16th and the 17th. The religious inspiration, the direct\r\nsimplicity and sincerity of the chorales are the qualities found in the\r\nworks of the first great German composer, Johann Sebastian Bach!\r\n\r\nThe religious wars of the first half of the 17th century crushed almost\r\nall the music out of Germany. In the second half, the organists became\r\nthe leaders, and their music for organ inspired by the chorale was the\r\nfirst real contribution that Germany made to the growth of music.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of these German organists was Johann Jacob Froberger\r\n(1605–1667), of Saxony, who was a pupil of Frescobaldi, and court\r\norganist at Vienna. He went to London (1662), and as he was robbed on\r\nthe way, he arrived penniless. He found work as organ-blower at\r\nWestminster Abbey. On the occasion of Charles II’s marriage, he overblew\r\nthe bellows and interrupted the playing, which so enraged the organist\r\nChristopher Gibbons, son of Orlando, that he struck him. Poor Froberger!\r\nBut he had a chance to redeem himself, for he sat down to the organ a\r\nfew moments later, and started to improvise in a manner for which he was\r\nfamous in Vienna. A former pupil of his, recognizing his style, was\r\noverjoyed to find him, and presented him to the King. He was invited to\r\nplay on the harpsichord which he did to the astonishment of every one.\r\n\r\nA Dutch organist, Johann Adam Reinken (1623–1722) and a Dane, Dietrich\r\nBuxtehude (1637–1707) belong to this school, as they lived in Germany\r\nmost of their lives and worked along the lines the Germans were\r\ndeveloping. Reinken was a pupil of Frescobaldi; he had a direct\r\ninfluence on Bach who often walked from Lüneburg to Hamburg to hear the\r\nfar-famed organist. When Reinken was 99 years old he heard Bach\r\nimprovise on his Chorale “By the Waters of Babylon,” which drew from him\r\nthe praise, “I thought that this art was dead, but I see that it still\r\nlives in you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ABSOLUTE MUSIC\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that had Buxtehude not lived, Bach would have\r\nwritten his organ works in a different style, so deeply did the younger\r\ncomposer study the older man’s compositions. Buxtehude was organist in\r\nLüneburg and there he started a series of concerts which became so\r\npopular that they were continued into the 19th century. Bach walked\r\nfifty miles to hear Buxtehude play, but was too shy to make himself\r\nknown to the great man; it was probably to hear one of the concerts\r\nwhich had the poetic name of _Abendmusik_ (Evening Music), that he went.\r\nBuxtehude was one of the first to try to make instrumental music stand\r\nas music (a language in itself), without a dance form, a plain-song or\r\nchorale or poetic idea behind it, to act as a Biblical text does in a\r\nsermon. This music for music’s sake is called “Absolute Music” and Bach\r\nwas one of its strongest disciples. Absolute music, which was so\r\nbeautifully handled by Buxtehude, became the basis of the Classic School\r\nof the 18th and early 19th centuries.\r\n\r\nThe organ chorale prelude which was so important a musical form during\r\nthis period had a very interesting history. Today the organist in our\r\nchurches plays the hymn through before it is sung; he plays it quite\r\nsimply just as it is written in the Hymnal, but in the day of these old\r\nGerman organists, the artistic feeling was deeper, and the organist was\r\nallowed to weave the chorale or hymn into a beautiful and complete\r\ncomposition. But in his love of composing and of showing how many\r\ndifferent ways he could decorate the chorale, he often exceeded his time\r\nlimit, and the chorale prelude was left behind. In its place the organ\r\nfantasia and the sonata appeared.\r\n\r\nJohann Pachelbel (1653–1706), of Nüremberg, was a pupil of another\r\ncelebrated director and organist, Johann Kaspar Kerl (1628–1693), who\r\nwas said to be one of the best teachers of composition of his day. There\r\nwere also three German organists born late in the 16th century, all of\r\nwhom were followers of the famous Dutch composer Jan Sweelinck. They\r\nwere known as the “three S’s”—Heinrich Schütz was the greatest of them.\r\nHe wrote organ music, but also worked out a scheme for combining the\r\nchorale with the ideas of Peri and Caccini for use with Bible texts in\r\nthe Lutheran Church. This was called Passion music and was originally\r\nwritten for Good Friday. On this foundation Bach built some of his\r\ngrandest oratorios. The Italian influence came into Schütz’s work while\r\nhe was a pupil of Gabrieli in Venice. Johann Heinrich Schein was a\r\nCantor at St. Thomas’ School before Bach, and wrote many chorales. The\r\nthird of the “three S’s” was Samuel Scheidt who was called the German\r\nFrescobaldi. “What plain-song was to Palestrina and his school, the\r\nchorale was to Schütz and his followers.” (Quoted from Charles Villiers\r\nStanford.)\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE INVENTOR OF THE SONATA AND OF “PROGRAM MUSIC”\r\n\r\nJohann Kuhnau (1660–1722), wrote many compositions which today we find\r\nvery amusing! For his day, however, he must have been looked upon as\r\nultra-modern! The composition which first brought him into public notice\r\nwas a motet, written for the election of the town council. Could you\r\nimagine anyone writing a serious composition for an election today, or\r\nanyone willing to listen to it at the polls? He was organist of St.\r\nThomas’, in Leipsic, a graduated lawyer, master of several languages,\r\nwriter of satirical poems, musical director of the University, and\r\nfinally Cantor in two Churches. He was admired and honored after his\r\ndeath as one of the greatest musicians of his day and one of the most\r\nlearned men. He invented a style of music for the clavier which he\r\ncalled Sonata. It was in several movements and was not based on dance\r\ntunes as were the suites. While it was not in the form that later was\r\nknown as sonata-form, it was a sign-post pointing the way. Seven of\r\nthese sonatas he named _Fresh Clavier Fruit_! And it was fresh in style\r\nas well as in name.\r\n\r\nHe was the first German composer to write “program music,” that is the\r\nkind which tries to tell a story, or to imitate the actual sounds of\r\nnatural objects, such as the crash of thunder, the motion of a windmill,\r\nthe rocking of a cradle, and the cackling of a hen. You can see how long\r\na list one might make and how easy it would be for anyone with a vivid\r\nimagination to make up all sorts of pictures in music. This is just the\r\nopposite from music for music’s sake which we described to you as\r\n“Absolute Music,” and most of it which follows this period when music\r\ncomes of age can be put into one of the two camps,—the Program Music\r\nCamp, or the Absolute Music Camp.\r\n\r\nKuhnau’s program music took a queer turn! He was living at a time when\r\nreligion was uppermost in every one’s thoughts, when the Bible stories\r\nwere bedtime stories and when the leading compositions were the sonatas\r\nwritten for organ. So in 1700 he published six Biblical-history Sonatas.\r\nIn _David and Goliath_, he attempts to put into music the rude defiance\r\nand bravado of the giant; the fear of the Hebrews; David’s courage and\r\nfearlessness, and the battle and fall of the giant; the flight of the\r\nPhilistines (can’t you imagine how the composer would represent this\r\nwith all kinds of runs and scales?); the joy of the Hebrews; the\r\ncelebration of the women who probably came out to meet David “with\r\ntimbrels and harps”; and general jubilation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 17th century, Germany was strongly under the influence\r\nof France and Italy, especially in opera. In Dresden, Berlin, Munich and\r\nVienna, one heard only opera in Italian sung by Italian singers, but\r\nHamburg tried to develop a national music by giving German opera sung by\r\nGerman singers, and attracted many serious musicians. Johann Mattheson\r\n(1681–1764) a singer, conductor and composer, is remembered chiefly for\r\na book called _A German Roll of Honor_, in which he gathered up all the\r\ninformation he could find about German composers up to his time. He\r\nasked all the living composers to write accounts of themselves for his\r\nbook, so we take it for granted that it must be truthful!\r\n\r\nMusic had changed more in the 17th century than in any that had gone\r\nbefore. If we tried to sum it all up in one word we should say that it\r\nwas a century of _transition_ or the passage from one condition to\r\nanother. It began with the old Ecclesiastical, or Church, modes, and\r\nended with the major and minor scales which we still use today; the\r\nreign of counterpoint was over, and now had to share the throne on equal\r\nterms with harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SONATA-FORM\r\n\r\nThe dominating musical form after Bach’s time was to be the Sonata, a\r\nname we have often used. The sonata which found its champions in Haydn,\r\nMozart and Beethoven, was the child of the sonata written by D.\r\nScarlatti, Kuhnau, and Bach and his sons. It is built on the principle\r\nof contrast as were the suites. A sonata is a collection of three or\r\nfour related pieces called movements: one, fast—one, slow—then fast. If\r\nin four movements, the first is moderately fast; the second, very slow;\r\nthe third, fast (scherzo); the fourth fast (usually rondo form).\r\n\r\nSonata-form is the name given to the first movement of a sonata, a\r\nstring quartet, trio, quintet, etc., concerto or a symphony. It has two\r\nmain themes which are announced, then developed and then re-announced,\r\nforming three contrasting sections or panels: _Statement_ or\r\n_Exposition_, _Development_, and _Restatement_. From now on, when we\r\nspeak of _sonata-form_, this picture should come to you.\r\n\r\nThe stage is now all set for Bach and those who came after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Music Has Grown Up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n                             Bach—The Giant\r\n\r\n\r\nBach and Handel rescued the Germans from the reputation of being musical\r\nbarbarians, for Germany had not had a Lully or a Palestrina! But just in\r\ntime, Bach and Handel entered and Bach carried composition to maturity\r\nand religious musical art to its highest point, while Handel was one of\r\nthe foremost opera and oratorio composers of his day.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed not until Mozart’s day did the Italians think that Germany\r\nwas anything but barbarous, not in fact until they were outranked in\r\nItalian Opera by a German.\r\n\r\nOf all the unassuming men of genius Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) is\r\nthe most lovable. Never did he seem to realize that he was doing\r\nanything, but the will of God, never did he seem to care what people\r\nthought of his work, but went on composing, supporting twenty children,\r\noften with so little money that he tutored and played at funerals to eke\r\nout a living. In his life there was little glitter. Bach was a saint, if\r\nthere was ever a saint. Although some few admired Bach during his\r\nlifetime, it was not until one hundred years after his death that his\r\nworks were known and that he received the fame he deserved.\r\n\r\nThe Bach family for six generations were musicians, beginning with his\r\ngrandfather “to the 5th power,” Veit Bach, a Thuringian baker in the\r\n16th century whose pleasure “was to use a small zither, which he took\r\nwith him to play, while the mill was moving.” All his descendants became\r\nmusicians down to and beyond Johann Sebastian.\r\n\r\nThe Bachs were great family lovers and every year they held reunions, at\r\nwhich all of the different members living in various parts of Germany,\r\nmet together and enjoyed a jolly time singing and playing.\r\n\r\nSebastian was born in 1685 in Eisenach, the town where Martin Luther\r\nwrote his stirring chorales. His father Ambrosius began very early to\r\nteach him music, the family profession, and Sebastian started with the\r\nviolin.\r\n\r\nBut the poor little boy lost both father and mother when only ten years\r\nof age, and he was left to be brought up by his elder brother, Johann\r\nChristopher. Sebastian was passionately fond of music and although\r\nChristopher taught him to play the clavier, nevertheless this sad little\r\ntale is told:\r\n\r\nSebastian had seen Christopher with a book of music including pieces by\r\nFroberger, Pachelbel, Buxtehude, and others. Sebastian was very anxious\r\nto get it and play bits from it. Christopher forbade him to touch it and\r\nput it away in a cupboard, which fortunately had a lattice door, for\r\nSebastian, every night during the full moon, (because he did not dare to\r\nuse a candle), copied the book note for note. When Christopher\r\ndiscovered this, the little lad was soundly scolded and was witness to\r\nChristopher’s burning it before his poor eyes!\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to daunt him, for from this time on, he copied the great\r\nworks whenever he could.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary for Sebastian to earn money to save Christopher’s\r\npurse, and in 1700 he became a choir boy at St. Michael’s in Lüneburg,\r\nwhere he received lessons without paying for them. He was happy here,\r\nwith a library where he could copy music to his heart’s content, and\r\nevery vacation he went on foot to Hamburg to learn of the great\r\norganist, Reinken. He visited too the court of Celle where he heard\r\nCouperin’s music, which no doubt helped to develop his style.\r\n\r\nSoon he left Lüneburg and went to Saxe-Weimar where he entered the\r\norchestra of Prince Johann Ernst. But his interest was in the church and\r\nwhen he was eighteen he tried for the post of organist in the Church at\r\nArnstadt. He played so delightfully, despite his youth, that he was\r\naccepted at the first hearing!\r\n\r\nHe composed many works here and learned much about the organ, that was\r\nto be valuable to him and to us. He was well liked, too, and his playing\r\nwas enjoyed. Nevertheless, his interest in others was so great, that he\r\ndecided to go to see Buxtehude in Lübeck, and he was so interested in\r\nthe master’s art that he forgot about his church in Arnstadt and stayed\r\nfour months instead of one! When he returned he was severely\r\nreprimanded. Later, he received a second reprimand which is of\r\ntremendous interest for he was accused of “interspersing the chorale\r\nwith many strange variations and tones, to the confusion of the\r\ncongregation.” He was charged with the crime of being original!\r\n\r\nDue to this lack of sympathy, he accepted a post as organist at\r\nMühlhausen in 1707 and later in the year married his cousin, Maria\r\nBarbara, with great rejoicings. They had seven children, two of whom\r\nwere the famous Wilhelm Friedemann and Karl Philip Emanuel.\r\n\r\nThe next year he became Concertmaster (first violinist), to the Duke of\r\nWeimar and remained there until 1718. This was a very fruitful composing\r\nperiod, for he had no money worries. He studied the Italian masters,\r\nespecially Vivaldi, and wrote some excellent cantatas. However, he went\r\nsoon to the Prince of Anhalt-Cothen, as Court Choir Master.\r\n\r\nHe made concert trips from here to Dresden and Leipsic, and it was in\r\nDresden that he challenged the proud Marchand, the French organist, to a\r\npublic improvisation contest on a theme, new to both of them. But the\r\ncontest never took place, because, unknown to Bach, Marchand heard him\r\nplay and when the time for the contest came, Marchand had left town\r\nhurriedly in an early post-chaise. And strange as it may seem, Emperor\r\nFrederick I gave Marchand one hundred ducats and Bach got nothing!\r\n\r\nBach’s new patron was a fine man and a Protestant and gave Bach every\r\nchance. At Weimar, he had become well known for his religious works and\r\nbeautiful playing. But, as he had no organ, he wrote music for\r\nharpsichord, violin, chamber music and the orchestra, which was far from\r\n“grown up.” Here, too, he wrote the Brandenburg Concertos and the first\r\npart of his epoch-making work _The Well-tempered Clavichord_ (48\r\nPreludes and Fugues, 1722) which he finished in 1744. It is still the\r\ngreatest work of its kind. In it he reaches the highest point of\r\ncontrapuntal writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1720, while Bach was traveling with the Prince, his wife died. After\r\na year and a half he married a charming singer, Anna Magdalena Wulkens,\r\none of his pupils. They had twelve children and lived very happily. The\r\nlovely little tunes that he wrote for Anna Magdalena and his children\r\nhave come down to us and many of us have played them in the first years\r\nof our music study. Isn’t it wonderful to think that the great Bach, who\r\nwrote some of the masterpieces of the world, could also write simple\r\nlittle Minuets and Preludes that any child can play?\r\n\r\nBut with all Bach’s comfort he missed an organ! Deep in his soul, he\r\ncraved the making of religious music—it was part of his thinking. His\r\nreligious ideas tied up with his music, were his life. So we see this\r\nsaint leaving happiness at Cothen for an ill-paid post in Leipsic, as\r\nCantor (1723) at the school of St. Thomas, where, succeeding Johann\r\nKuhnau, he stayed the rest of his life and wrote his greatest works.\r\n\r\nBach wrote to a friend that he thought a long while before leaving his\r\n“gracious, music loving and discriminating Prince ... but it happened\r\nthat my master married a ... princess who ... weaned my master from the\r\nloving interest he had ... toward our glorious art. And so God arranged\r\nthat the post of Cantor at St. Thomas’ should fall vacant.... I took\r\nthree months to consider the future and was induced to accept, as my\r\nsons were studious and I was desirous ... of gratifying their bent by\r\nentering them in the school ... and thus, in the name of the Most High,\r\nI ventured and came to Leipsic.”\r\n\r\nNote, dear reader, the nobility, spirituality and sweetness here,\r\nthinking of his children and not of his career!\r\n\r\nHe struggled against the unsympathetic town council, the school, and\r\nlack of money. He wrote to his friend Erdman, “My present income\r\naverages $700. When funerals are numerous I make more, but if the ‘air\r\nis healthy’ then my income falls. During the past year I have earned\r\n$100 less, owing to the small number of deaths.”\r\n\r\nIn 1732 he wrote one of his few attempts at comedy.—the _Coffee Cantata_\r\nset to music on a text by Picander. Leipsic had become a slave to the\r\nnew luxury, coffee, and in this Picander found material for a satire.\r\n\r\nBesides his regular work, he had to teach dull, undisciplined pupils,\r\nattend to services in four churches, and be satisfied with the few\r\nsingers and players he found for the performances he directed.\r\n\r\nYet, fed with the spirit of love that was within him, he was happy and\r\nhis home was a center of joy. He never became too sad until he lost his\r\nsight three years before his death. Even then he dictated his\r\ncompositions and conquered discouragement!\r\n\r\nBach’s life was made happier when Philip Emanuel became Court musician\r\nand clavier player to Frederick the Great, and he talked so much of his\r\nfather that Bach was invited to Potsdam.\r\n\r\nWhen Frederick the Great, who was playing the flute in his orchestra,\r\nheard that Bach was in Potsdam, he put down his flute and interrupted\r\nthe concert saying, “Gentlemen, old Bach has arrived.” Bach appeared in\r\nhis traveling clothes and was invited to improvise a fugue in six parts,\r\nwhich he did to the great admiration of all.\r\n\r\nYet many felt that his writings were lacking in charm! This was no doubt\r\nbecause people were getting accustomed to the Italian melodies which had\r\nbecome popular in Germany. Furthermore, when he wrote “The Art of Fugue”\r\nhis son could sell but thirty copies and finally sold the plates for the\r\nmere cost of the metal! Students are grateful that copies of this work\r\nwere saved, for it is still the greatest authority on fugue writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1749, Bach underwent an operation on his eyes but lost his sight and\r\nin 1750 died of apoplexy. So little was he appreciated that his grave\r\nwas destroyed in the renovation of the Johanneskirche grounds. His\r\nsupposed remains were discovered in 1894 and re-interred one hundred and\r\nforty-four years after his death. But—what remains of Bach, no known or\r\nunknown grave can bury.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century after Bach’s death, Mozart said, on hearing a\r\nBach Cantata, “At last I have heard something new and have learned\r\nsomething.” Then later Mendelssohn re-discovered him, and Schubert, too,\r\nhelped to bring him to the world’s notice. And not until 1850, a century\r\nafter his death, was the Bach Society formed to honor Bach, the\r\ncorner-stone of modern music.\r\n\r\nBach was a stalwart man with fine deep eyes, broad forehead and a grave\r\nface, lit with kindly humor. He had dignity and calm, was always\r\ncourteous, and criticised only his pupils whom he wanted to help. When\r\nasked one time, how he played so well, he remarked, “I always have had\r\nto work hard.” He could stand no one who was pretentious and conceited.\r\nHe wanted his rights but never boasted. One year besides fulfilling his\r\nother duties he wrote a cantata every Sunday! He wrote them as a\r\npreacher writes sermons. They had to be done and he never neglected his\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nBach was a devoted father and husband and his home was one of the\r\nhappiest of any great genius. Many of his children were musical and he\r\nsaid that he had an orchestra in his own home!\r\n\r\nEven his little half-witted son had genius and during the last years of\r\nBach’s life when the dear old man had become blind, the little boy sat\r\nat the clavier, Bach’s favorite instrument, and improvised to the joy of\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BACH’S WORKS\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe in words just what Bach accomplished, so\r\nsurpassing in beauty are his best works.\r\n\r\nHe brought the art of polyphonic writing to its highest and most sublime\r\npoint. His value to the student cannot be exaggerated, for he is the\r\nmusical Bible to all who would be musicians.\r\n\r\nThe organ was the core of his musical thinking and it is in the things\r\nwhich center about the organ that his art is loftiest.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was most ingenious in writing counterpoint, he was never dry\r\nand tricky as were other writers. His subjects were always original and\r\nhis melodic line always of rare beauty.\r\n\r\nHis works are most varied: fugues, motets, cantatas, passions,\r\noratorios, concertos, sonatas and suites. He was a radical in his day,\r\nfor he threw over conventional notions of harmony as to proper keys and\r\ninsisted upon a new system of tuning the clavier, so as to use the whole\r\nrange of tones. The “Well-tempered Clavichord,” two groups of 24\r\nPreludes and Fugues in 24 keys, was the outcome of this. It was so\r\ncalled because it was written to show the possibilities of a clavier (or\r\nclavichord) tuned according to an idea of his, enabling one to play in\r\nall keys. This was one of the greatest discoveries in the whole story of\r\nmusic, for it made possible all the music which has followed. The\r\nkeyboard was divided into equal half-steps. This made twelve half-steps\r\nwithin each octave and thus all the intervals became fixed, and\r\nmodulation from key to key was possible. Heretofore, if one went from\r\none key to another, the instrument sounded out of tune, but now\r\ninstruments were tuned, as we glibly say, “to scale.”\r\n\r\nHe invented a new fingering in which the thumb and little finger were\r\nused for the first time. We wonder why the thumb had been snubbed!\r\n\r\nThe pianoforte was just coming into prominence in Bach’s day but he\r\npreferred the clavier, on which he felt he could play with more\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nHe developed the fugue to its highest point. A fugue is an enlarged\r\ncanon in which the fragments of theme or melody are taken up and\r\nanswered by two, or more, voices. One voice declares the subject and the\r\nanswer is repeated usually in the dominant key a fifth above, while the\r\nfirst voice gives the counter-subject. There are various kinds of\r\nfugues, depending on their construction. After the voices have all\r\nentered, separated sometimes by little passages called “episodes,” a\r\nsection in which the subject is freely developed comes, and then the\r\nstretto, in which all the parts enter racing and overlapping, building\r\nup to a climax; then follows the cadence or ending.\r\n\r\nTo write a noble or lofty fugue, neither dry nor pedantic, takes art to\r\nthe _nth_ power! Bach had the art that touched Heaven’s borders! In\r\ntruth you can safely divide fugues into two classes—Bach’s and all\r\nothers!\r\n\r\nNone of Bach’s works were published until he was forty years old, and\r\nmost of them not until long after his death, and many of his manuscripts\r\nwere lost and never published at all.\r\n\r\nThe list of his works is stupendous; the Bach Gesellschaft (Bach\r\nSociety, 1850) published them in sixty volumes! Among them were the 48\r\nPreludes and Fugues (The Well-tempered Clavichord Collection); 12\r\nSuites; many Inventions in 2 and 3 parts; partitas; 12 concertos for 1,\r\n2, 3 and 4 claviers with orchestra; many sonatas and concertos for\r\nviolin, flute, viola da gamba, clavier, and orchestra; several overtures\r\nfor orchestras; vocal works; 200 motets and cantatas; 5 _Passions_, of\r\nwhich the greatest are the St. Matthew and the St. John; 5 masses of\r\nwhich his _B Minor Mass_ is a world masterpiece; oratorios; magnificats;\r\nmany organ works, and old German chorales harmonized for voices.\r\n\r\nWhen you can, try to hear Wanda Landowska play Bach compositions on the\r\nharpsichord. It is a glimpse into the beauty of the saintly Bach.\r\n\r\nAlso try to hear the great Bach Festival, directed by Frederick Wolle\r\nheld yearly in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Moravian Church.\r\n\r\nIn a list of great men, Bach would be classed with Euripides, Sophocles,\r\nShakespeare, Milton, da Vinci, Michael Angelo and Goethe.\r\n\r\nBach did not write for people, he wrote for his own soul. He never\r\nseemed able to write theatric music, for his was the drama of the\r\nspirit. Always, his music was the result of his musings, the confessions\r\nof his ideals. So he attained a loftiness, grandeur and sublimity far\r\nremoved from even some of the most dramatic writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BACH’S SONS\r\n\r\nBach’s sons reached great eminence. The eldest was Wilhelm Friedemann\r\n(1710–1784), an unusually talented man on whom the father built great\r\nhopes. But while Friedemann inherited his father’s musical talent he did\r\nnot have his character, and was looked upon as a disgrace to the family\r\non account of his dissolute ways. He was the greatest organist of his\r\ntime and most of his compositions, which were considered very fine, have\r\nbeen lost to the world, for he did not take the trouble even to write\r\nthem down, but played them from memory.\r\n\r\nThe third son, Karl Philip Emanuel (1714–1788), although trained to be a\r\nlawyer, could not resist the urge of music, and after going through two\r\nuniversities decided to become a musician to Frederick the Great. He was\r\n“general manager” of all the music at court until the Seven Years’ War\r\nput an end to his position after almost thirty years’ service. He then\r\nspent the rest of his life in Hamburg. As composer, conductor, teacher\r\nand critic his influence was great. He was loved and respected by the\r\nwhole city. In his day he was regarded as being as important as his\r\nfather, but we know that he was not in the same class, although he was\r\nthe greatest of his contemporaries. He did not imitate his father’s\r\nstyle but developed the sonata into the form that Haydn, Mozart and\r\nBeethoven perfected. He was an innovator, not only in form, but in the\r\ntreatment of melody and harmony. His best sonatas were written at the\r\ncourt of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nIn the growth of music he is the link between his immortal father and\r\nHaydn. Haydn was more gifted than he and made the seeds planted by\r\nPhilip Emanuel blossom luxuriantly.\r\n\r\nJohann Christoph (1732–1795) was an upright, modest, amiable man, and a\r\nsplendid musician keeping up the family traditions.\r\n\r\nJohann Christian (1735–1782), the youngest of those who outlived the\r\nfather, might be called the Italian Bach, because he went to Italy in\r\n1754, became organist of the Milan Cathedral, and wrote vocal music in\r\nthe Neapolitan style. He left his position as organist, married an\r\nItalian prima donna, wrote many operas and spent the last twenty years\r\nof his life in London, as director of concerts.\r\n\r\nCurious as it may seem, the great and gifted Bach family died out in\r\n1845, with a grandson of Johann Sebastian. Out of twenty children there\r\nseems not to have been one to carry the line to the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                      Handel and Gluck—Pathmakers\r\n\r\n\r\n               GEORGE FREDERICK HANDEL—MASTER OF ORATORIO\r\n                              (1685–1759)\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we saw Bach rescue music from the danger of\r\nemptiness and frivolity, by perfecting polyphonic music and dignifying\r\nchurch music as it had not been since Palestrina.\r\n\r\nBach and Handel were alike in that they were both born in Germany when\r\nmusic, especially opera, had become mechanical and full of set rules.\r\nThey were both Lutherans and Thuringians. They worked about the same\r\ntime, and tried to encourage the hearts and minds of their country, torn\r\nby the Thirty Years’ War; both were polyphonic masters; both organists.\r\nBach attached himself to Frederick the Great, the protector of the\r\nfaith, and Handel went to England, where there was liberty of thought;\r\nand both, died blind and of apoplexy.\r\n\r\nThe differences, with so many similarities, are most interesting. Bach,\r\nmodest, retiring, was always a German subject; Handel became an English\r\nsubject. Bach was a homebody with twenty children; Handel was a traveler\r\nand never married. Bach wanted only to satisfy himself; Handel, to\r\nsatisfy the public. Bach was humble, Handel arrogant. Bach seldom fought\r\nfor his rights, while Handel would dismiss even his masters. Bach cared\r\nlittle for applause, but Handel could not live without it. Bach was\r\ndevoted to the lyric, Handel to the epic. Handel is usually (not always)\r\nheroic, Bach is usually religious (not always, of course). Handel is\r\npopular, easy to understand; Bach is deep, coming from the soul, and it\r\ntakes more thought than the crowd is always willing to give to\r\nappreciate this giant.\r\n\r\nHandel achieved great worldly success, and treated nobles as equals.\r\nPoor Bach worked contentedly in an humble position and struggled for\r\nmoney and profited by “bad air.” (See page 248.)\r\n\r\nBach demanded faith and love of art, Handel demanded ready ears. Bach\r\nnever intended to make music, he only wanted to express his devotion in\r\nthe best medium he had; Handel wanted fame and riches and the approval\r\nof the crowd. Handel died rich and Bach died poor.\r\n\r\nGeorge Frederick Handel (1685–1759) who wrote the immortal oratorio\r\n_Messiah_, and one of the greatest opera composers of his time, was born\r\nin Halle, Saxony. His father was a barber, but managed to get the title\r\n“Chamberlain to the Prince of Saxe-Magdeburg.”\r\n\r\nHandel’s father wished him to study law, but George Frederick did not\r\nlike the idea and besides he showed great musical gifts. One day when he\r\nwas a little boy, he found hidden in the attic, a clavichord upon which\r\nhe secretly played every chance he had.\r\n\r\nNot long after this “find,” something most important happened. His\r\nfather was going to Weissenfels to the Duke’s castle and had no\r\nintention of taking George Frederick with him. So, Father Handel seated\r\nhimself in the coach, taking things comfortably, when he spied little\r\nGeorge Frederick dashing along by the great wheels. He paid no attention\r\nto him, but after going a mile and realizing that the little boy was\r\nstill following, he called out “What do you want?” “I want to go with\r\nyou,” answered Handel, and although his father was quite annoyed, George\r\nFrederick’s will, as always, prevailed and he went with his father! At\r\nthe court the Duke saw, very quickly, how gifted the little Handel was.\r\nHis father relented and on his return to Halle, George Frederick was\r\ngiven instruction on the organ, harpsichord and in composition with\r\nZachau, and taught himself the oboe and violin, greedily mastering all\r\nthe music he could find.\r\n\r\nAlthough he studied music he seems to have respected his father’s wishes\r\nand studied law and even after his father died in 1697, he continued,\r\nbut later gave it up for music. At seventeen he entered the University,\r\nand studied, besides music, the literary classics which were of great\r\nuse to him later.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the University he went to Hamburg, the musical center of\r\nGermany, where he heard Keiser’s works and received good advice from\r\nJohann Mattheson, the composer, tenor and conductor, who later engaged\r\nGeorge Frederick in a duel.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel came about in this way: Handel was to lead Mattheson’s\r\nopera, _Cleopatra_, in order to relieve Mattheson, who sang the part of\r\nAntonio. After Antonio was “killed,” Mattheson being free to lead,\r\nentered the orchestra pit to take Handel’s place as leader. Handel was\r\ninfuriated. They met later and fought a duel in which Handel was saved\r\nby a large metal button which snapped Mattheson’s rapier! What a little\r\nthing a button is and what it did for music!\r\n\r\nHandel’s first four operas were written here for the Hamburg stage. But\r\n_Almira_ (1705) is the only one ever heard now.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HANDEL IN ITALY\r\n\r\nNext he visited Florence, Rome and Venice during which time he had the\r\nhappiest three years of his life. He composed a cantata, an oratorio and\r\nother works; he learned much of melody and sweet flowing music, which\r\nsoftened his dry, stiff use of German counterpoint, and he gathered\r\nmaterial for his later London work.\r\n\r\nAn amusing story is told of him in Venice. There was a carnival going on\r\nand Handel went to it. At one of the costume balls, he sat down to a\r\nharpsichord uninvited and began improvising, thinking that no one would\r\nknow him. A gorgeously garbed figure dashed through the crowd to his\r\nside, and almost overcome by the music, gasped, “This is either the\r\nDevil or the Saxon.” (Handel was called “The dear Saxon”—“_Il cáro\r\nSarsone_” in Italy.) It was Domenico Scarlatti’s first meeting with\r\nHandel, and forever after they remained warm friends.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna he met Steffani (Chapel Master) who persuaded him to go to\r\nHanover and after a short time, the Elector, who became George I of\r\nEngland, appointed him Chapel Master and gave him permission to go to\r\nEngland for a visit before taking up his new work.\r\n\r\nThis visit was the turning point in Handel’s career, for later he became\r\nan English subject and he—but we must not get ahead of our story!\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HANDEL IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nHandel went to England about fifteen years after the death of Purcell,\r\n“The Orpheus of England.” Handel was quick to see Purcell’s good points\r\nand modelled his first English work to celebrate the Peace of Utrecht,\r\non Purcell’s _Te Deum_.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving in London he wrote _Rinaldo_ with an Italian libretto in\r\nfourteen days! He was the speed maniac of the 17th and 18th centuries.\r\nHis librettist said of him, “Mr. Handel barely allowed me time to\r\ncompose my verses.” Later he arranged _Rinaldo_ for harpsichord and all\r\nEngland played it, especially the lovely aria _Lascia ch’io Piango_ (Let\r\nMe Weep).\r\n\r\nYet Handel doesn’t seem to have made money out of _Rinaldo_, which\r\nbrought the publisher, Walsh, $10,000, about which Handel said, “My dear\r\nfellow, the next time you shall compose the opera and I will publish\r\nit.” (_History of Music_, by Paul Landormy.)\r\n\r\nLater, he became the guest of the Duke of Chandos, at whose house he\r\nwrote at least sixteen compositions.\r\n\r\nKing George had been very angry with Handel for leaving Hanover and\r\nremaining in England, but forgave him later, and Handel was made\r\nDirector of the Royal Academy of Music which the King founded in 1719.\r\nAmong Handel’s duties were the getting of the artists for the operas.\r\nThis meant much to him and allowed him to travel all over Europe. He\r\ncomposed operas almost as people wrote their letters, for in eight years\r\nhe produced eleven successful operas! Think of that for work!\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HANDEL AND HIS RIVALS\r\n\r\nBut—he had a rival, Battista Buononcini, protégé of the mighty Duke of\r\nMarlborough, and a musical war raged in London. John Byrom, a humorist\r\nof the day wrote:\r\n\r\n                 Some say, as compared to Buononcini\r\n                 That Mynheer Handel’s but a ninny\r\n                 Others aver that he to Handel\r\n                 Is scarcely fit to hold a candle.\r\n                 Strange all this difference should be\r\n                 ’Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.\r\n\r\nHandel won, however, and Buononcini left England. In 1729, another opera\r\nventure was started, an Italian opera society, of which Handel was made\r\nthe Director. Off he went to Dresden and brought back Senesino, a tenor,\r\nand other famous singers. But Handel did not get along well with his\r\nsingers and subordinates. He was too high-handed and because of his\r\nquarrels the opera was given up! On one occasion he dragged the singer,\r\nCuzzoni, to the window and threatened to throw her out if she did not\r\nsing the way he wished. Various other reasons were given too,—one, the\r\ndispute between Cuzzoni, who was called the “Golden Lyre” and another\r\nsoprano, Faustina, the wife of Hasse, a rival conductor. Colley Cibber,\r\na critic of the time said: “These costly canary birds contaminate the\r\nwhole music loving public with their virulent bickerings. Cæsar and\r\nPompey did not excite the Romans to more violent partisanship than these\r\ncontentious women.”\r\n\r\nAnd now we see Handel bankrupt and superseded in another theatre by his\r\ntwo rivals, Porpora and then Hasse (1699–1783) of Hamburg. However, they\r\ntoo were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nOn went Handel, writing operas and oratorios and conducting at special\r\nfunctions. His health snapped, but his will was so powerful that this\r\nforceful man recovered, and presented two more operas, which were not\r\nsuccessful. In spite of all his failures and lack of tact, he had\r\nfaithful friends who arranged a successful benefit concert in 1738 for\r\nhim. At about the same time a statue was erected in Vauxhall Gardens, an\r\nhonor never before paid to a living composer!\r\n\r\nHe composed, while writing for the stage all these years, twelve sonatas\r\nfor violin or flute with figured bass, thirteen sonatas for two violins,\r\noboes or flutes and bass, six _concerti grossi_, twenty organ concertos\r\nand twelve concertos for strings, many suites, fantasies and fugues for\r\nharpsichord and organ. It is difficult to understand how one brain could\r\ndo all this!\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HANDEL FORSAKES OPERA\r\n\r\nAfter his ill success with the Italian Opera House, he gave up writing\r\noperas and devoted himself to oratorios. In thirteen years (1739–1752)\r\nhe wrote nineteen. Among these are _Saul_ in which is the famous “Dead\r\nMarch,” _Joseph_, and many other important ones, but towering over all\r\n_The Messiah_, and _Heracles_, which Romain Roland says is “one of the\r\nartistic summits of the 18th century.”\r\n\r\nThey are not all oratorios, for _Heracles_ and several others are not\r\nreligious in subject, but are dramatic epics.\r\n\r\nHandel’s sight failed him, but even this did not stop his torrential\r\nactivity to his death in 1759.\r\n\r\nHe had become an English subject, so was buried with pomp at Westminster\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\nHe was loved even though he was fiery of temper, and had a will that no\r\none could conquer.\r\n\r\nHis music is full of his gusts of feeling but always correct and his art\r\nperfect. In his work he always held himself under great control and it\r\nmirrors his power and balance. He loved wind instruments and people\r\noften considered his music noisy!\r\n\r\nHe wrote forty-two operas, two passions, ninety-four cantatas, ten\r\npasticcios, serenatas, songs and the instrumental works mentioned above.\r\nThe famous Handel _Largo_ comes from one of his operas, _Xerxes_, and\r\nwas an aria _Ombra mai fu_ (Never was there a Shadow).\r\n\r\nHandel used counterpoint, but always knew when to unbend and use\r\ndelightful flowing melody, so he became popular.\r\n\r\nOther men, Hasse, Telemann and Graun, contemporaries of Handel, followed\r\nthe popular Italian models but without Handel’s genius for melody and\r\nsublimity, and were never heard of after their own generation had passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHandel’s _Messiah_, which he wrote in twenty-four days, was first given\r\nin Dublin. It took the people by storm and when the king heard it,\r\nthrilled by the “Hallelujah Chorus,” he rose to his feet, and since then\r\nit is the custom to stand during that number. It has become the\r\nChristmas Oratorio and is sung in churches and societies all over the\r\nworld. It has lost none of its first popularity among the people and is\r\nloved as few works have ever been. It thrills because it is sincere,\r\nbig, and arouses religious feeling. Oratorio was his special gift to the\r\nworld and one never hears the name of Handel without thinking of _The\r\nMessiah_.\r\n\r\nHandel seemed to reunite the forms: oratorio and opera, under his\r\nmassive will. At first some of his oratorios were given in costume,\r\nshowing the influence of opera.\r\n\r\nHandel had many enemies in England, but he also had friends. Although\r\nimperious, he had a sweet side, and made friends with humble folk who\r\nloved music, even though he hobnobbed with royalty. Thomas Britton, a\r\ncoal heaver, his friend, is sketched by an artist of the day in a\r\npicture where Handel is playing _The Harmonious Blacksmith_ to Alexander\r\nPope, the Duchess of Queensbury, Colley Cibber and other famous folk.\r\nYet he stormed at everyone and even royalty “quaked in their boots” and\r\nwere forced to behave themselves at rehearsals and concerts which Handel\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nAccused of using someone’s melody, he answered, “That pig couldn’t use\r\nsuch a melody as well as I could!” He helped himself to so many that he\r\nwas called the “Great Plagiarist.”\r\n\r\nHis latter life was spent quietly, with a few intimate friends, drinking\r\nhis beer and smoking his beloved pipe. He was always generous and as he\r\ngrew older seemed to become kindlier and softer. He contributed largely\r\nto the Foundling Asylum and even played the organ there.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to die on Good Friday, “in hopes,” he said, “of meeting his\r\ngood God, his sweet Lord and Saviour on the day of his resurrection,”\r\nand on Good Friday, April 6th, 1759, he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHRISTOPH WILLIBALD GLUCK—FATHER OF MODERN OPERA\r\n                               1714–1787\r\n\r\nNow we come to the next genius, Christoph Gluck (1714–1787) born when\r\nGeorge Frederick Handel was twenty-nine years old. He also attacked the\r\nfrivolous drift of his time, but in another field from Handel and Bach,\r\nand gave the fashionable, aimless Italian opera its death blow for all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nGluck’s life is different from Handel, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven\r\nas you will see later when you have read about all of these. For, until\r\nhe was almost forty years old, Gluck did nothing to make him great,\r\nwhereas these other men showed from their earliest years that they were\r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nGluck belongs to two periods for his life bridges Bach’s and Haydn’s.\r\nYou will see how he first belonged to the frivolous fashion-loving\r\ncomposers like Hasse, Jomelli and Piccinni, and how later he blossomed\r\ninto the great renewer and constructor of opera and escapes into a class\r\nof his own! His is the most remarkable instance of a man who starts with\r\nan ordinary talent, and later in life grasps a vision that never came to\r\nhim in his early youth and which was not caught by others in his day.\r\n\r\nFurthermore he was able to carry his point and not merely see the vision\r\nand let it go by. But first let us see how his life unfolded, for a\r\nman’s life helps us to understand his works.\r\n\r\nChristoph Willibald Gluck, born July 2nd, 1714, at Weidenwang, near\r\nNüremberg, was the son of a gamekeeper, who moved from estate to estate\r\nin the service of princes and nobles, and at the time of Christoph’s\r\nbirth, was ranger to Eugene, Prince of Savoy. So, this little boy\r\ndestined to become the great Chevalier von Gluck, was a child of the\r\npeople even as was Haydn and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GLUCK STARTS TRAVELING\r\n\r\nWhen he was three years old he was taken to Bohemia, (now\r\nCzecho-Slovakia), for his father entered the service of Prince\r\nLobkowitz, a great music lover, of whom you will hear again. His parents\r\nwere quite poor, yet it is remarkable that above everything else they\r\ngave Christoph a good education and at twelve he went to a Jesuit school\r\nnear Eisenberg, the home of Prince Lobkowitz.\r\n\r\nHere he learned to sing and to play the organ, the violin, the ’cello\r\nand the clavier. He was diligent and became most proficient and was\r\nloved and admired by the school fathers. But little did they dream that\r\nsome day he was to write classic operas, based not on Christian stories\r\nbut the pagan dramas of the Greeks!\r\n\r\nWhen nearly nineteen, he left the seminary and said good-bye to the\r\nChurch of St. Ignatius and went to Prague. To support himself and to\r\ncarry on his scientific and musical studies he gave lessons, played for\r\nrustic festivals and earned money the best way he could, until Prince\r\nLobkowitz became interested in him and introduced him to the musical\r\ncircle at court. Here he met Count Melzi who took him to Milan, where he\r\nwas taught by Giovanni Battista Sammartini, a celebrated organist and\r\nteacher of counterpoint. After four years of study he completed his\r\nmusical education.\r\n\r\nIn Milan, he wrote his first opera, _Artaserse_ which was performed in\r\n1741. Metastasio, the popular librettist, wrote the words to\r\n_Artaserse_, as he did for many of Gluck’s works written in the loose\r\nstyle of the Italian opera. He was now twenty-eight and in the five\r\nyears spent here, he composed eight operas, through which he gained\r\ngreat popularity. But not yet had it come to him to revolutionize opera;\r\nhe simply used the old pattern which was really nothing but groups of\r\nsongs, recitatives and choruses having very little connection except to\r\ngive the performers the chance to do musical feats to amaze the audience\r\nwith their skill. The story of these operas, meagre as it was, stopped\r\nshort, for some long and elaborate cadenza, and then it went on again\r\nwith no thought of the meaning of the drama but rather to tickle the\r\ntaste of the audience and the performer. The orchestra, too, was a\r\nstep-child, for no one cared where it came in as long as it was politely\r\nsubdued, keeping the singers on the key, and doing its best to be heard\r\nonly when bidden. So, Gluck followed these ideas in the beginning and\r\nperhaps it was better that he did, otherwise he might never have\r\nrealized how far opera had strayed from the ideals of Monteverde.\r\n\r\nHaving eight operas to his credit, he began to get commissions from\r\nother cities and countries, and next accepted an invitation, in 1745, to\r\ngo to London as composer of opera at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1746 he\r\nwrote _La Caduta de Giganti_ (The Fall of the Giants), with no doubt a\r\nlibretto of Metastasio’s, then he gave his _Artamene_ and was assisted\r\nin their production by Handel, who is supposed to have treated the works\r\nwith contempt. He is said to have exclaimed, “Even my shoe-black can\r\nwrite better counterpoint than Gluck.” But we must remember that Gluck\r\nhad not yet become the _great_ Gluck. His visit to England was fruitful,\r\nfor Gluck heard and digested the great oratorios of Handel, and realized\r\nthat the voice and orchestra might be handled the same way in opera. No\r\ndoubt his mission was beginning to dawn on him; it came, not as a great\r\nrevelation, but gradually.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HE MAKES SUCCESS OF FAILURE\r\n\r\nAnother thing that gave him a push forward and shows how great people\r\ncan make a success of failure: he was asked to write a _pasticcio_\r\n(Italian word meaning a meat-pie), or a string of melodies, very\r\nfashionable in his day. He strung together his best airs from his\r\nItalian operas, and called it _Pyramus and Thisbe_, but it was a dismal\r\nfailure. “Ah, ha!” he must have thought, “why shouldn’t this musical\r\ndrivel fail, for it is naught but trash, and with nothing that is needed\r\nto make a good literary drama.” So this was one of the experiences that\r\nled him to reform opera, making the words fit the music and not stopping\r\na performance, so that a popular soloist could sing a meaningless trill\r\nand then start again with the other part of the word,—the way that opera\r\nwas being written at that time.\r\n\r\nAfter his London ups and downs he went to Paris and heard the operas of\r\nRameau. He realized now the value of musical declamation and recitative\r\nto the meaning and action of opera if used with thought, and he was not\r\nslow in taking suggestions.\r\n\r\nGluck was probably the most all round man of his day, for he knew\r\nliterature and science as did few musicians. He knew all the influential\r\npeople in the arts, sciences, and music in London, Hamburg, Dresden and\r\nVienna, and his home was a center of learned and delightful people. When\r\nin Vienna but a short time, he was commissioned to write an opera and he\r\nproduced, with success, _La Semiramide_, after which he went to\r\nCopenhagen. His next opera _Telemacco_ in which he began to work out his\r\nnew ideas was well received, in Rome and Naples.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 after many disappointments, he was married to a lady he had long\r\nadored. They lived happily together, for Marriane Pergin not only\r\nbrought him money which was a great joy, but was always his devoted and\r\nunderstanding help-mate. She was an accomplished woman, and a companion\r\nthat many might envy. But, sad to say, they had no children, so they\r\nadopted a niece of Christoph’s, a lovely little girl with great musical\r\ntalent. The three lived lovingly together until the poor little child\r\nsickened and died, making the Glucks most unhappy, for they adored her,\r\nas is often the case, even more than if she had been their own child.\r\n\r\nIn 1751 Gluck journeyed to Naples. Didn’t he travel a lot in the days of\r\nthe stage coach and brigands! In the same year he became conductor to\r\nPrince Frederick at Vienna and in 1754 was officially attached to the\r\nopera, and Maria Theresa made him court chapel master.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the Pope, pleased with what he had done in Rome, made him\r\nChevalier of the Golden Spur and from that time he always styled himself\r\nRitter (Chevalier) von Gluck.\r\n\r\nIn _Il re pastore_ (The Shepherd King), we see the dawning of Gluck’s\r\nbest period of writing (1756). The overture is better music than he had\r\nwritten before, and from this time on, Gluck became the genius in the\r\nopera world for which he is known. From 1756 to 1760 he lived apart from\r\nthe world studying and after this he began to broadcast his ideas in\r\nwriting and composing.\r\n\r\nWhen the Archduke Joseph of Austria, afterwards the Emperor, married\r\nIsabella of Bourbon, Gluck wrote _Tetede_ which was performed with great\r\npomp. After this he wrote the ballet _Don Giovanni_, or _The Libertine_,\r\nparticularly interesting, for it certainly gave Mozart an idea for his\r\nown great work _Don Giovanni_.\r\n\r\nAgain our “wandering minstrel” moved, this time to Bologna where he\r\nconducted a new opera which, strange to say, showed not a sign of his\r\nnew ideas!\r\n\r\n\r\n                     “ORPHEUS AND EURIDICE” IS BORN\r\n\r\nSoon he met Calzabigi, another librettist, with whom he wrote his first\r\nepoch-making opera _Orpheus and Euridice_. Although in some parts it is\r\nwritten like the older operas, he used many of his new ideas. The public\r\nat first were bewildered but they liked it. The next opera written with\r\nhis new librettist was _Alceste_, so different was it, and so full of\r\nhis best thought that the public did not like it. The pleasure-loving\r\npeople went to be amused and heard music almost as serious as oratorio.\r\nIt was austere, and its climax was not satisfactory. Yet it and _Orpheus\r\nand Euridice_ mark the birth of music drama which Mozart and Wagner\r\ndeveloped further.\r\n\r\nIn _Orpheus and Euridice_ the chorus was an important part of the drama\r\nas it had been in the old Greek drama from which Gluck took many of his\r\nstories; and was not something dragged in to fill up space. Instead,\r\ntoo, of the over-embroidered arias they were simple and expressive, and\r\nthe characters were real living beings, instead of figures on which to\r\ndrape showy melodies. Naturally, the composers were jealous of him and\r\nwent so far as to say that the principal singer had written _Orpheus and\r\nEuridice_.\r\n\r\nGluck said of his _Alceste_: “I seek to put music to its true purpose;\r\nthat is, to support the poem, and thus to strengthen the expression of\r\nthe feelings and the interest of the situation without interrupting the\r\naction.... In short, I have striven to abolish all those bad habits\r\nwhich sound reasoning and true taste have been struggling against now\r\nfor so long in vain.” He abolished the unnecessary cadenza, a fancy,\r\ntrilly part composed by the soloist himself and used just before the\r\nclose of a piece. You will see in a later chapter how Beethoven dealt\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nHappily Gluck and Calzabigi still continued working together and in 1770\r\nhe wrote _Paride and Elena_ (Paris and Helen) which proved Gluck to be a\r\nwriter of beautiful romantic song.\r\n\r\nBy now Vienna and Paris were enthusiastic about him, yet he was severely\r\ncriticized because he dared to write and compose differently from\r\neveryone else. The adventurer into new paths must always expect trouble\r\nfrom those who have not caught up with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TROUBLE BREWS FOR GLUCK\r\n\r\nNow our traveler goes to Paris where he presents _Iphigenia in Aulis_.\r\nThe story was taken from a play of the French dramatist Racine. Although\r\nthis was the fourth work in Gluck’s new style it was not as good as the\r\nothers. His enemies did their utmost to hurt him as they resented his\r\ncoming into Paris to reform French opera. And as the musicians and\r\nsingers were not good artists, it was almost impossible to give it well,\r\nand probably it would never have reached the stage had it not been for\r\nMarie Antoinette the French Queen who was later guillotined. She had\r\nbeen a real friend and pupil of Gluck, when a young princess in Vienna.\r\nNevertheless the opera pleased its audiences, and it paid well, and\r\nGluck was given a new court office in Vienna.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the trouble that had been brewing with Gluck’s opponents came to\r\na climax. Piccinni was his great Italian rival and the city of Paris was\r\ntorn as to who was the better composer. All the literary men and the\r\ncourt were divided into factions, one for and one against Gluck. Some\r\ngreat men, including Jean Jacques Rousseau were Gluckists, while others\r\nof importance were Piccinnists. Never had there been so great a\r\ncontention for musical glory or struggle against new ideas. It was a\r\nmost extraordinary thing, but it does show that there was great musical\r\ninterest or people would never have wasted so much time in argument and\r\nin writing for or against these men. Finally it came to a head, and it\r\nwas decided to give them both the same libretto of _Iphigenia in Tauris_\r\nto see who could write the better opera. Gluck completed his within the\r\nyear and after nearly three years, Piccinni finished his. They were both\r\nperformed and needless to say Gluck won the award and even Piccinni said\r\nhimself that Gluck’s was the better. It is nice to know that after\r\nGluck’s death, Piccinni tried to collect funds to raise a memorial as a\r\ntribute to him! So artistic rivalry need not dim admiration.\r\n\r\nIn _Iphigenia in Tauris_ again the master rises to great heights. His\r\noverture was splendid, his orchestral color was superb. He pictured the\r\ndifferent characteristics of the various groups of people and of the\r\nindividuals themselves in word and music as it never had been done\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHe wrote _Armide_ in 1777. It did not succeed although it was very\r\nlovely and dreamy and in it, he suggested the sounds of babbling brooks\r\nand the song of the nightingales.\r\n\r\nGluck wrote thirty operas, seven of which are in his new style: _Don\r\nGiovanni_, _Orpheus and Euridice_, _Paris and Helen_, _Alceste_,\r\n_Iphigenia in Tauris_, _Iphigenia in Aulis_ and _Armide_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NEW PATHS\r\n\r\nAnd thus this great path-breaker advanced _opera seria_ (grand opera).\r\n\r\nThe old _sinfonia_ in three movements which opened the opera,\r\ndisappeared, and instead came the introduction or overture, suggesting\r\nthe opera itself. He taught and wrote that composers could do anything\r\nto assist the action of the opera; he elevated the story to an important\r\nplace; the characters in the plot were thought of as people and not as\r\npuppets, and they were studied individually and not as machinery only.\r\nThe situations in the story governed the kind of music he used and he\r\ntried hard to make the orchestra a main part of the opera. It seems odd\r\nthat nobody had thought of this before. Yet you have seen how much time\r\nhad been given to the voice throughout the ages, and how long it had\r\ntaken instruments to arrive at their full importance. So we see Gluck\r\nimproving as he worked with a better librettist. From now the opera\r\nwriter had to use thought in composition, as he would in writing a play.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A VERY CROSS CONDUCTOR!\r\n\r\nBut Gluck had trouble with the singers on account of his innovations. He\r\nwas the crossest conductor of his time, would allow no one to dictate to\r\nhim, and scolded the singers as they had never been scolded before.\r\n\r\nHe must have looked droll conducting, for he used to take off his wig\r\nduring rehearsals, and wrap a cloth about his head to keep the draughts\r\nfrom fanning him! He would rage if the singers tried to do what they had\r\nbeen permitted to do in other operas! Some singers demanded extra pay\r\nwhen Gluck conducted. Sometimes he would repeat a passage twenty or\r\nthirty times and no _pianissimo_ was soft enough and no _fortissimo_\r\nloud enough! Someone said of him while he was conducting, “He lives and\r\ndies with his heroines, he rages with Achilles, weeps with Iphigenia and\r\nin the dying scene of _Alceste_ throws himself back in his chair and\r\nbecomes as a corpse.”\r\n\r\nOtherwise he was always the kind soul who attracted everybody from Marie\r\nAntoinette down. She used to receive him in her boudoir so that they\r\ncould enjoy conversation without court formalities.\r\n\r\nOne day two prima donnas refused to obey him when rehearsing\r\n_Iphigenia_, and he said: “Mesdemoiselles, I have been summoned here to\r\nParis especially to produce _Iphigenia_. If you sing, well and good, but\r\nif not, that is your business; only I shall then seek an audience with\r\nthe Queen, and inform her that the opera cannot be performed, and I\r\nshall put myself into my carriage and straightway leave for Vienna.” You\r\nmay know that the ladies did their best!\r\n\r\nIn closing let us tell you what Berlioz, a master of orchestration, said\r\nof Gluck’s orchestration in _Alceste_: “Of its kind I know nothing more\r\ndramatic, nothing more terror-inspiring.” And this was said of a man who\r\nhad only the simplest orchestra with which to work. After much fighting,\r\nhe was the first to introduce into the orchestra the kettle-drums and\r\ncymbals, which moderns have used with grandeur.\r\n\r\nGluck lived to see his own success, but the Piccinni strife and the\r\njealousies may have weakened his constitution, for he died rather\r\nsuddenly in 1787, a few weeks after the first performance of Mozart’s\r\n_Don Giovanni_.\r\n\r\nThere are many memorials in Europe to Gluck, not the least being his\r\nbust which stands beside Lully and Rameau in the Grand Opera of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PUBLIC CONCERTS\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to realize that time was when there were no public\r\nconcerts. Music was confined for so many centuries to the churches, to\r\nthe public squares, to the King’s Chamber, or to the ball rooms of\r\nwealthy nobles, that it had not become the democratic art that it is\r\nnow. Of course the first opera houses in Italy had been steps in the\r\ndirection of bringing music to the people. The concerts begun by the\r\nDanish organist, Buxtehude, in Lübeck about 1673, and the\r\n_Tonkünstler-societät_ in Vienna of the same period were the first\r\npublic concerts. In England, John Banister started concerts at about the\r\nsame time, which were the first to admit an audience by payment of a\r\nfee. Handel’s friend, Thomas Britton, the coal-heaver, gave concerts at\r\nhis home for 10 shillings the series!\r\n\r\nThe 18th century saw a great development in giving public concerts. In\r\nFrance, the _Concerts Spirituels_ were begun in 1725. The object of\r\nthese were to give music to the people on the days of religious\r\nfestivals when the opera house was closed. There were about 24 concerts\r\na year; the political events of 1791 put an end to the society but it\r\nhad already given the people a taste for concerts, and many new\r\nsocieties grew out of it. The festivals of Three Choirs in West England\r\n(see page 190) were founded in 1724, and the Academy of Ancient Music in\r\n1710. The _Musikverein_ in Leipsic was founded in 1743 and was later\r\nturned into the famous _Gewandhaus_ concerts in 1781.\r\n\r\nThis movement for public concerts went hand in hand with the development\r\nof instruments and the perfecting of performers. In fact the word\r\nconcert came from “_consort_—the union or _symphony_ of various\r\ninstruments playing in concert to one tune.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MANNHEIM SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe symphony came to life in Germany. Paul Landormy in his _History of\r\nMusic_ tells us that it was the time of the “poor scholars” who were\r\neducated free from expense in the schools with the understanding that\r\nthey were to learn the “musician’s trade” and take part in the concerts\r\norganized by the cities and the courts. Thus symphony orchestras grew up\r\nall over Germany,—Munich, Stuttgart, Dresden, Darmstadt, Hamburg where\r\nTelemann conducted, in Leipsic, Berlin and Mannheim.\r\n\r\nIn Mannheim appeared the most important group of composers, known as the\r\n_Mannheim School_, and many wrote the early symphonies which led from\r\nthe works of Bach to those of Haydn and Mozart. The best known of these\r\ncomposers are: Johann Stamitz (1717–1757), Franz Xavier Richter\r\n(1709–1789), Anton Filtz, Christian Cannabich, Ignaz Holzbauer, Ernst\r\nEichner and Giovanni Battista Toeschi. Under the direct influence of the\r\nMannheim School were: François Joseph Gossec (1734–1829), a Belgian\r\nliving in Paris who wrote many symphonies; Luigi Boccherini (1743–1805)\r\nknown as one of the first writers of chamber music in the form used by\r\nthe classic writers; Giovanni Battista Sammartini (1701–1775) of Milan;\r\nthe sons of Bach, Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf, and Joseph and Michael\r\nHaydn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the painting by J.

No one knew what to think or how. It was a time of\r\nbattle and struggle as he was born in the midst of the Seven Years’ War\r\nand lived during the French Revolution. Everyone except for a few great\r\npersons felt bitter and discontented and doubt was everywhere. This\r\nseems to be the way wars and conflicts affect all peoples and it is why\r\nwars are so damaging.\r\n\r\nYet out of this mixture of feeling and thinking, the great classic\r\nperiod of music was created by such men as Bach and Haydn and Mozart and\r\nthe finishing touches were put on it by Beethoven, the colossus.\r\n\r\nFranz Joseph Haydn was born in Rohrau (1732), a little town in Austria\r\nnear Vienna. His father was a wheelwright and his mother was a very good\r\ncook. Beethoven’s mother, too, was a professional cook.\r\n\r\nThese simple parents, his brothers and sisters, measuring not a baker’s,\r\nbut a wheelwright’s dozen, had an hour or two of music every evening\r\nafter the hard day’s work, and Mathias, the father, played the harp and\r\nsang. It was during these evenings that little Joseph’s father noticed\r\nthat at the age of six he was passionately fond of music.\r\n\r\nOne time at a festival the drummer failed to appear and there was no one\r\nwho could play for the choristers who were to march through the town.\r\nHis teacher, Frankh, called Joseph and showed him how to make the drum\r\nstroke and told him to practice it. When he was left by himself he found\r\na meal tub, over which he stretched a cloth, put it on a stool and\r\ndrummed with such vigor that the whole thing toppled over and he and his\r\ndrum were covered with meal! But he learned to drum! And the people\r\nlaughed when in this solemn church festival, the little six year old\r\nJoseph was seen drumming the big drum carried by a hunchback in front of\r\nhim. The drums on which he played are still at Hainburg. But, we forget,\r\nwe have not brought him from Rohrau!\r\n\r\nNot long before J. M. Frankh, a relative, came to visit the Haydns, and\r\nit was decided that he should take Joseph to Hainburg to teach him. The\r\nexcitement, of course, was great and little Joseph felt very important\r\nwith all the hustle and bustle preparing for his departure. Little did\r\nSaperle (his nickname) realize what a hard master he was getting in\r\nFrankh, who only cared for the pay he received from Joseph’s father.\r\nNevertheless he learned much and showed great talent while at Hainburg\r\nand one day a great thing happened. Reutter, the organist of St.\r\nStephen’s in Vienna, visited Frankh and as they talked of music the\r\nconversation turned to the choir school which Reutter directed. Frankh\r\nsent for Joseph, a slight, dark haired, dark eyed little boy, and\r\nReutter asked him to read a piece of music at sight. Joseph looked at it\r\nand said: “How can I, when my teacher couldn’t?” Yet, Joseph did sing it\r\nsweetly and he entered the choir school. Here his life was a misery, for\r\nReutter was harsh and unsympathetic, but soon Joseph’s hard life in the\r\nchoir school was over, for one very cold winter night, he felt a little\r\nfrisky, as many a healthy lad does, and pulled off the wig of a man in\r\nthe choir. Reutter, who had wanted an excuse to rid himself of Joseph,\r\nbecause his voice had begun to break, threw him out into the cold. Poor\r\nSaperle had no other place to go and wandered about all night, until he\r\nmet his acquaintance Spangler, a tenor who was very poor and so had\r\nsympathy with Haydn. He took him home to live with him and his wife and\r\nchild in his attic,—one small room with no comfort and no privacy. All\r\nthis time young Haydn was forced to earn his daily bread by teaching as\r\nmuch as he could, playing for weddings, baptisms, funerals, festivals,\r\ndances and street serenadings. This street serenading was a sweet and\r\npretty custom of the time.\r\n\r\nOne night Haydn and some other youths serenaded Kurz, a prominent\r\ncomedian. Kurz, pleased by the music below his window, called to the\r\nlads: “Whose music is that?” “Joseph Haydn’s,” called back Haydn. “Who\r\nis he and where?” asked Kurz. “Down here, I am Haydn,” said Joseph. Kurz\r\ninvited him upstairs and Haydn, at the age of seventeen, received a\r\ncommission for a comic opera, which had two special performances.\r\n\r\nAll this time he mixed with the poor and laboring people, and their\r\nsongs became his songs, and his heart was full of their frolics and\r\ntheir pains. He was of the people and was so filled with their humor\r\nthat later he was called the father of humor in music.\r\n\r\nSoon, in order to be alone, and to work in peace, he took a room in\r\nanother attic, and bade good-bye to his very good friends. His room was\r\ncold in winter and let in the rains and snows, but it did have a spinet\r\non which Haydn was allowed to play, and fortunately Metastasio the\r\nlibrettist lived in this house. Here Haydn studied the works of Karl\r\nPhilip Emanuel Bach, Fuchs’ _Gradus ad Parnassum_ (Steps to Parnassus,\r\nParnassus meaning the mountain upon which the Greek Muses lived and so\r\ncomes to mean the home of learning). He practised too, during this time,\r\non any instrument he could find and learned so much that he became the\r\nfounder of the modern orchestra.\r\n\r\nWhen Metastasio discovered that there was a hard working musician in his\r\nhouse he met him and then introduced him to Porpora the greatest Italian\r\nsinging teacher in Vienna. Not long after meeting him, Porpora entrusted\r\nto his care Marianne Van Martines, his ten year old pupil, the future\r\nmusical celebrity. At seventeen Marianne wrote a mass which was used at\r\nSt. Michael’s Church and she became the favorite singer and player of\r\nEmpress Maria Theresa. You see women even in those days composed and\r\nperformed!\r\n\r\nSo began Haydn’s successes. Porpora engaged him as accompanist, and\r\ntreated him half way between a valet and a musician, but Haydn’s sweet\r\nnature carried him through all unpleasantnesses and he was so anxious to\r\nlearn and to earn his six ducats that he did not care if he did have to\r\neat with the servants.\r\n\r\nIn 1751–2, he wrote his first mass, his first string quartet, and his\r\nfirst comic opera for Kurz, _The Crooked Devil_, the music of which has\r\nbeen lost. Soon after he met Gluck at the concerts of the Prince of\r\nHildburghausen, where Haydn acted as accompanist; at the prince’s house\r\ntoo, he met Ditter von Dittersdorf, the violinist. The princes and\r\nnobles of these days did much for music for it was usually at their\r\nhomes and under their guidance that the composers received opportunities\r\nto work.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we see Haydn during these days slaving to make his daily\r\nbread, but with the money he made he bought books on music theory and\r\nheld himself sternly down to hard work, morning, noon, and night.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 Baron von Fürnburg, a music amateur, who gave concerts at his\r\nhome, asked him to compose for him, and he wrote eighteen quartets, six\r\n_scherzandi_ for wind instruments (the ancestors of his own symphonies),\r\nfour string quartets, to be played by the village priest, himself, the\r\nsteward, and the ’cellist Albrechtsberger.\r\n\r\nAll these pieces show how much happier he was since becoming part of the\r\nBaron’s staff, for they are merry and jolly, and filled with that humor\r\nwhich Haydn was the first to put into music.\r\n\r\nHere, too, he met the cultivated Countess Thun, who was so interested in\r\nhis struggle for success, and in the youth himself that she became his\r\npupil. From this time on he began to earn more and to live more\r\ncomfortably.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to be clearing up for him now. The Countess introduced\r\nhim to Count Morzin, a Bohemian nobleman of great wealth, and in 1759 he\r\nbecame his musical director. His orchestra had eighteen members and here\r\nhe wrote his first Symphony (the first of one hundred and twenty-five!)\r\n\r\nAll this time he kept up his teaching and very soon married the daughter\r\nof a wig-maker, who did not understand him and with whom he was very\r\nunhappy, but he lived with her like the good man he was until within a\r\nfew years of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HAYDN AND THE ESTERHAZYS\r\n\r\nSoon after Haydn’s marriage, Count Morzin had to cut down expenses and\r\ndismissed his musical staff, but Prince Paul Anton Esterhazy engaged him\r\nand he lived with him thirty years under salary with all his expenses\r\npaid,—thus ended his struggles to make a living. He composed in comfort\r\nand had a few able musicians to play whatever he wrote. He had quiet,\r\nsolitude and appreciation,—the need of all art workers.\r\n\r\nFrom 1761 to 1790 in the Esterhazy home he wrote most of his immortal\r\nworks,—six of his best symphonies; the oratorio _The Seven Words from\r\nthe Cross_ (1785) which he himself thought was a masterpiece; six string\r\nquartets.\r\n\r\nHis orchestra here had six violins and violas, one violoncello, one\r\ndouble bass, one flute, two oboes, two bassoons and four\r\nhorns,—seventeen in all; later he had twenty-two to twenty-four\r\nincluding trumpets, kettle-drums and from 1776–1778 the newest arrival,\r\nthe clarinet.\r\n\r\nHis duties were to rehearse the orchestra daily, give music lessons,\r\ncompose for the orchestra and instruct the singers engaged by the\r\nprince. Oh, yes! he had to tune his own harpsichord, on which he played\r\nwhen he led the orchestra.\r\n\r\nHaydn led a beautiful life with the Esterhazy family. In the summer he\r\nhunted and fished, and in the winter, went off to Vienna to hear the\r\norchestra and meet great personages attracted by the art, music and\r\ncourt life. But he had to keep on composing for the Esterhazys, who were\r\nconstantly entertaining and there were many special occasions to be\r\ncelebrated with Haydn’s lovely music.\r\n\r\nIt seems hard for us to realize that one family could play the\r\ncompositions of one man continually, but we have rarely had so great a\r\nman to listen to!\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HAYDN IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nIn 1790 Haydn’s fame had spread abroad, especially to England. Salomon,\r\na violinist and concert manager begged him to come to conduct twenty\r\nconcerts with a new composition for each concert, for which he was to\r\nreceive a fabulous sum. He gave his first concert February 25th, 1791.\r\nHe was now about sixty years old and his popularity was so great that\r\nthe Prince of Wales engaged him for twenty-six court concerts. He forgot\r\nto pay him, but later Parliament sent him one hundred guineas (about\r\n$500). Money at that time bought four or five times what it buys now, so\r\nHaydn went back to Austria, rich and famous and with a degree from\r\nOxford. The English asked him many times to return and finally in 1794\r\nhe went again and was greeted with even more enthusiasm. Few composers\r\nin all the world have lived to see such triumphs as did the jovial,\r\ncharming “Papa Haydn,” as his warm friend and pupil Mozart called him.\r\nBut withal, Haydn was modest and unassuming and never hesitated to give\r\nhis services in concerts for the poor or to give money to the sick.\r\n\r\nBesides all the money he must have received, he had a generous pension\r\nfrom his friends, the Esterhazys, who demanded very little of his time.\r\nSo now, with leisure, he could do his greatest works and at this period\r\nhe wrote two oratorios, _The Creation_ and _The Seasons_. They were more\r\nthan successful. Emil Naumann says this of _The Seasons_: “It is not\r\nuntil we come to Haydn that we witness the joys and sorrows of men and\r\nwomen of our own time and dwellers in our own land, the tiller of the\r\nsoil, the wine-presser and shepherd, or homely figures like Simon the\r\nfarmer, his daughter Anna and the peasant Lucas, in _The Seasons_.” Then\r\nhe says of _The Creation_: “We move with him through the German spinning\r\nroom, where the girls relate stories to the accompaniment of the musical\r\nhum of the spinning wheel, or we rove through woods to follow the chase.\r\nHis whole heart is in nature. He loves to depict her in her many varying\r\naspects, and at all seasons, and all is touched with a light, tender\r\nhand. His types are of home.... His delineation of nature is ever the\r\nsame, fresh and loving, whether we look at _The Seasons_ or at _The\r\nCreation_.”\r\n\r\nHaydn said of his English experience, “It is England which has made me\r\nfamous in Germany.”\r\n\r\nIn 1797 he wrote _God Preserve the Emperor_ which became the Austrian\r\nNational Hymn, and later put it in his quartet called the Kaiser\r\nQuartet. From this time on, nearly every nation honored him,—Russia,\r\nFrance, Sweden, England, Austria, Germany. And as Haydn was leaving for\r\nEngland, when Mozart said to him, “Papa, you are scarcely fitted for\r\nsuch an undertaking, mixing with the big world without the gift of\r\nlanguage,” he replied, “Aye, but _my_ language is understood by the\r\nwhole world.”\r\n\r\nAnd this is the keynote of Haydn’s greatness, his music is and was\r\nunderstood by the whole world, so true and simple and melodious is it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A GALA PERFORMANCE\r\n\r\nOne year before his death when he was seventy-six years of age, he was\r\nso feeble that he had to be carried to the concert hall where a great\r\nperformance of _The Creation_ was given in his honor under the direction\r\nof Salieri, who later taught Beethoven. Princes and nobles and grand\r\nladies did him homage and the ladies threw their beautiful cloaks over\r\nhis couch to keep him warm, for it was a cold night in March, 1808. When\r\nthat part of the oratorio came where they sing, “And there was light,”\r\nit is said that Haydn exclaimed, “Not I, but a power from above created\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nHe died on May 30th, 1809, from shock, it is said, caused by the booming\r\nof cannon near his house when the French besieged Vienna.\r\n\r\nSo passed this conscientious musician, whose belief is summed up in\r\nthese sentences: “I know that God appointed me a task. I acknowledge it\r\nwith thanks, and hope and believe I have done my duty and have been\r\nuseful to the world. May others do likewise.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HAYDN’S GIFT TO MUSIC\r\n\r\n1. He made over the orchestra, he discovered that muted strings made a\r\nbeautiful winning effect.\r\n\r\n2. He and Mozart at about the same time, added the clarinet to the\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\n3. He was the first composer who brought humor, that difficult thing\r\nwhich is neither wit nor comicalness, to music, although others had\r\nbrought fun and boisterousness.\r\n\r\n4. He was the first to use the individual tone color of each instrument,\r\nso, rightly he has been called the father of the modern orchestra.\r\n\r\n5. He developed sonata-form in the sonata itself, the quartet, concerto\r\nand symphony. He was one of the first to establish two themes instead of\r\none in the movements of sonata-forms. This was a great innovation and\r\nmade the sonata a far more living thing and gave the composers who\r\nfollowed him a richer field to carry out musical design and human\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n6. He wrote about 1,407 works! 157 symphonies of which 18 are\r\nmasterpieces, 83 string quartets, 66 piano sonatas, 5 oratorios, 42\r\nGerman and English songs, 336 Scotch songs, 40 canons, 13 part songs for\r\nthree and four voices, 5 German marionette operas written for the\r\nEsterhazy theatre, 14 Italian operas, 163 pieces for the baryton (viola\r\nda bordona), a favorite instrument of one of the Esterhazy princes, 47\r\ndivertimenti and trios, 15 concertos for different instruments, 15\r\nmasses, 5 other sacred works, 400 single minuets and waltzes. (Emil\r\nNaumann.)\r\n\r\n7. Among his larger vocal works with orchestra are: _Alcide_ (1762),\r\n_Philemon and Baucis_, _entre acte_ music for King Lear and many others.\r\nHis symphonies are so numerous and so many in the same key that in order\r\nto tell them apart some have been given such names as _Surprise\r\nSymphony_, _The Farewell Symphony_, the _Military Symphony_, _Queen of\r\nFrance_, _The Oxford_, the fascinating _Kinder Symphonie_ (children’s\r\nsymphony) and on and on!\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MOZART AND HAYDN\r\n\r\nMozart was years younger than Haydn and died while still very young, but\r\nthey were the closest friends. Haydn was his teacher, but lived to think\r\nof Mozart as his superior and didn’t hesitate to say so. This again\r\nshows the great spirit of Haydn.\r\n\r\nAlthough Haydn was an innovator and a master of form his rules were\r\nnever cast into molds he could not break through inspiration. A critic\r\nonce asked him about the introduction to the Mozart Quartet in C major\r\nwhich had been much discussed on account of its complex harmonies,—a\r\nwork which today we look upon as one of the greatest examples of his\r\ngenius. Haydn replied in a decided tone, “If Mozart has written it, be\r\nsure he had good reason for so doing.” Albrechtsberger, a strict\r\ntechnician, questioned him about the use of consecutive fourths which\r\nwas breaking a good old-fashioned law of harmony. Haydn replied, “Art is\r\nfree and must not be fettered by handicraft rule. The cultivated ear\r\nmust decide, and I believe myself as capable as any one of making laws\r\nin this respect.” Thus spoke the great musician and not just the teacher\r\nand follower.\r\n\r\nHe loved his art so well that he welcomed the young Mozart to Vienna\r\ngenerously, because of his genius. Haydn, when asked by a manager to\r\nhave one of his operas follow the night after one of Mozart’s refused,\r\nsaying: “It would be too much to venture, for next to the great Mozart\r\nit would be difficult for anyone to stand. Could I force home to every\r\nlover of music the grandeur and inimitableness of Mozart’s operas, ...\r\nand display of genius, and were I able to impress all others with the\r\nsame feelings which excite me, the nations would contend for the\r\npossession of so rare a gem. Let Prague strive to hold fast the\r\npriceless man. But reward him adequately, for without this the history\r\nof great men is truly sad and offers to posterity little inducement to\r\nexertion, as indeed many a hopeful mind lies fallow for want of\r\nencouragement. It angers me _only_ that Mozart has not yet been engaged\r\nat some Imperial court. Pardon this digression but I love the man\r\ndearly.” When he left Mozart he wrote to his friend Frau von Gennzinger,\r\n“I am inconsolable at parting,” and then he tells with the simplicity of\r\na child “a happy dream” he had listening to a performance of Mozart’s\r\n_Marriage of Figaro_. (Adapted from Naumann.)\r\n\r\nAnd thus we see this cheerful-hearted man according honor and love even\r\nto his rivals, his broad realistic humor showing itself, as well as\r\ncharm, dignity and beauty, in all his works whether in music or in life.\r\n\r\nPapa Haydn was a good and truly religious man. He leaves us an example\r\nof kindliness and thoughtfulness, for even the people who loaned him\r\nmoney, which he repaid, were remembered in his will. A touching story is\r\ntold of him; that when he returned to his parent’s home, he kissed the\r\nfloor upon which his mother and father used to walk, so well had he\r\nremembered them, yet so simple had he remained, he who played among and\r\nplayed with and played for the greatest people who lived in his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART\r\n                               1756–1791\r\n\r\nNow we come to the greatest musical genius of all time. For, whereas\r\nBach, Handel, Haydn, Gluck, and Beethoven excelled in many things,\r\nMozart excelled in everything; living but thirty-five years, about half\r\nthe time of most of these, he outstripped them all in natural genius.\r\n\r\nWolfgang Amadeus, born in Salzburg on the 27th of January, 1756, was the\r\nson of Leopold Mozart, under chapel master to the hated Archbishop of\r\nSalzburg. His mother was the daughter of a minor official in\r\nHildenstein, and was not a cook as were the mothers of Haydn and of\r\nBeethoven. However, Madam Mozart’s not having been of that profession\r\ndid not lessen her son’s genius!\r\n\r\nOne day when little Wolfgang was four years old, his father found the\r\nboy busily writing. He warned his father not to disturb him, as he was\r\nwriting a concerto for the harpsichord. And, sure enough, when the\r\nfather looked over the boy’s shoulder he saw that he was not scribbling\r\nas most children of four years do, but was actually composing a work for\r\nharpsichord and orchestra, which he afterwards played to show how it\r\nshould go. In spite of the blots of ink, it could easily be read.\r\n\r\nMozart’s father was a wise and kindly man. He soon appreciated that the\r\nboy was destined for a great career, and decided that he must be\r\nproperly trained.\r\n\r\nWolfgang was a sweet and loving child, very kind and easy to control,\r\nalthough he and his sister “Nannerl” were “regular” children and loved\r\nto play as other children. The father decided to take them both on a\r\nconcert tour through Europe, in order to meet the great musicians and to\r\nearn money for their education.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1765, Wolfgang and his pretty little sister gave their first\r\nconcert in London “for the benefit” so the sign read, “of Miss Mozart\r\naged thirteen and Master Mozart eight years of age, prodigies of\r\nnature ... a concert of music, with all the overtures of this little\r\nboy’s composition.”\r\n\r\nThe people, tired of all the pomp and ceremony of fashion, were eager\r\nfor something different and were ready to listen to youthful prodigies,\r\nso the hall was crowded, and everyone was amazed.\r\n\r\nThey were beautifully brought up, charming, merry and unspoiled by the\r\ngifts showered upon them. Father Mozart gave the presents to them by\r\ndegrees, teaching them the value of all things, from jewels to flattery.\r\n\r\nBecause of this training, Mozart always remained modest, did everything\r\nwith gratitude to God and greatest love for his parents. He was\r\nespecially loving to Nannerl to whom he brought every new idea. In fact\r\nMozart radiated friendship and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CHILDREN TOUR EUROPE\r\n\r\nOn this concert tour (1765) in Paris, London, Holland and Switzerland,\r\nMozart was received with great enthusiasm everywhere. When they came\r\nback, Mozart had no time to become conceited for he began a strict\r\ncourse of study and at twelve he composed his first mass and his first\r\nopera _Bastien et Bastienne_, which is still played and is charming. At\r\nfourteen he was assistant concertmaster to the Archbishop of Salzburg,\r\nand then began a series of woes, for the Archbishop was a mean character\r\nand treated him most unjustly.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1777, we see him in Paris with his mother, where to his\r\ngreat advantage he heard Gluck’s operas and met Gluck. Shortly after\r\nthat his mother died, and it made a very deep scar in his heart. Soon he\r\nwas absorbed in composing and finishing _Idomeneo_ and in this year\r\n(1781) took up his residence in Vienna. In the next, he married\r\nConstance Weber and wrote _Il Seraglio_ in which his heroine is called\r\nConstance. They say he was teased for this, but he did not mind very\r\nmuch. In 1786 he wrote the unexcelled _Marriage of Figaro_, which at\r\nfirst was not appreciated, but soon came into its own.\r\n\r\nPrague began to love Mozart and gave him ovations. To show his\r\nappreciation he composed _Don Giovanni_ (1787) and so great was the\r\npeople’s delight in this masterpiece that Emperor Joseph made him court\r\ncomposer at the salary of $400 a year! Too bad it was not more, for poor\r\nMozart was never free from the heart-breaking struggle to make enough\r\nmoney to live. You will recall the letter of Haydn in the last section\r\nwhere he wished some nation would adopt Mozart and free him from care,\r\nso great was Haydn’s appreciation and love for Mozart, which Mozart\r\nreturned. When listening to a piece of Haydn’s, a critic once said: “I\r\nwouldn’t have written it like that, would you?” “No,” replied Mozart,\r\n“and do you know why? Because neither of us would have had the idea!”\r\nIsn’t it refreshing to see men so great in wisdom and works that they\r\nbecome greater because of their loyalties.\r\n\r\nYet this man, a genius almost divine, was so hated by petty musicians,\r\nso badgered by unjust criticism, that when he was dying he believed that\r\nsomeone had poisoned him!\r\n\r\nIn spite of his enemies, he was known for his gaiety and bubbling fun,\r\nwhich ever overflowed into his music. No one seems to know why his\r\ncountry did not free him of money worry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        APPRECIATION COMES LATE\r\n\r\nAs it so often happens with great men, after his death public\r\nsubscriptions were collected and statues erected as a tribute to his\r\nmemory. At Salzburg you can see a statue of him, and yearly festivals of\r\nhis works are held in his honor; and in Vienna, the opera house is\r\ndecorated with frescoes of scenes from the _Magic Flute_!\r\n\r\nAfter his visit to Prague he was never well, and when he had finished\r\nthe inimitable _Magic Flute_ he started work on his last composition,\r\nthe great Requiem (a mass played for the dead) which influenced Catholic\r\nChurch music for years. He became very despondent, in great contrast to\r\nhis usual high spirits, and poor Constance did everything to cheer him.\r\nOne day, while writing the Requiem, Mozart began to weep and declared he\r\nwas writing it for himself, “I feel I am not going to last much longer,\r\nsome one has certainly given me poison, I cannot get rid of this idea.”\r\n\r\nIn November, being an ardent member of the Masonic brotherhood, as were\r\nalso Beethoven and Haydn, believing as they did in the freedom and\r\nbrotherhood of man, he wrote a cantata and led it himself at his lodge.\r\nIll and despondent, he continued work on the Requiem, finished while he\r\nwas dying. All during this time he longed to hear his _Magic Flute_\r\nwhich was constantly given at the opera house, and like a child, he\r\nwould say: “I guess they have just reached this or that point,” and he\r\nwould hum the music as he thought it must be progressing at the opera.\r\nThe day before he died, Roser, his friend, played some of the opera on\r\nthe harpsichord to cheer him.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon before his death, after finishing the Requiem, he and some\r\nof his friends sang it. At the _Lacrymosa_, Mozart wept. He said to\r\nSussmayer, his friend, “Did I not say I was writing the Requiem for\r\nmyself?” Later he asked his wife to tell Albrechtsberger of his\r\napproaching end, so that he would be ready to take his post at St.\r\nStephen’s. During his last hours he was informed that he had been made\r\ndirector of all the music at St. Stephen’s with a salary that for the\r\nfirst time in his life would have enabled him to live in comfort, but it\r\nwas too late! At midnight, on December 5th, 1791, he lost consciousness\r\nand fell into a slumber from which he did not awake. His wife was so\r\novercome with grief that she was too ill to attend his funeral. A few\r\nfaithful friends followed the coffin, but had to turn back as a furious\r\ntempest was raging and they could not force their way through the\r\ndriving rain and sleet. Thus passed one of the rarest spirits that has\r\never brought Music to earth, and he lies in a grave unknown and\r\nunmarked. In 1859, the city of Vienna erected a monument to his memory\r\nnear the spot where he was probably buried.\r\n\r\nSad, sad end for so great a man! He and Raphael, Keats and Shelley and\r\nJesus, Himself, all died early in their careers and yet had time to\r\nleave the world a finer and more lovely place for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MOZART PRINCE OF MUSICIANS\r\n\r\nWhy do we celebrate Mozart in what seems to be exaggerated terms?\r\n\r\nWhere Handel was a great epic composer, Bach a great religious composer,\r\nGluck, a dramatic writer, Haydn more versatile than many of the others\r\nyet not dramatic, Beethoven lyric, free and hating all tyrannies, in\r\nMozart we have great opera, great masses, great epics, symphonies and\r\nchamber music quartets and quintets.\r\n\r\nThe list of his works is gigantic! How he was able in the short span of\r\nhis life, to write down so much, to say nothing of composing them, is a\r\nproblem that cannot be solved!\r\n\r\nWith his usual tendency not to finish work until the last minute, he\r\nwrote the overture to _Don Giovanni_ the night before the first\r\nperformance. He composed and scored it for orchestra in less time that\r\nit took the copyists to copy the parts, and the audience was forced to\r\nwait almost an hour until Mozart appeared at the conductor’s stand to\r\ndirect the unrehearsed overture. When the curtain rose on the first act\r\nMozart said, “The overture went off very well on the whole, although a\r\ngood many notes certainly fell under the desks!”\r\n\r\nMozart promised a group of country dances to a count, but failed to keep\r\nhis word. The count invited him, putting dinner time an hour ahead. When\r\nMozart arrived he was shown into a room, was given music paper, quills\r\nand ink and was asked to compose, then and there, four country dances to\r\nbe performed the next evening. In a half hour’s time he wrote the entire\r\norchestra score and earned his dinner!\r\n\r\nMozart could be not only humorous, but tragic in the same work, making\r\nhis humor seem greater by contrast. _Don Giovanni_ and the _Magic Flute_\r\ncould be called tragic-comedies they are so rich in both moods.\r\n\r\nIn the _Marriage of Figaro_ he originated what Emil Naumann calls\r\nconversational opera, although Rossini’s _Barber of Seville_, and\r\nDonizetti’s _Daughter of the Regiment_ follow it in style they do not\r\nreach it in real fun, melody and quality. When we say some of his operas\r\nwere humorous we do not mean that they were comic operas.\r\n\r\nIn _Don Giovanni_ he originated romantic opera, and although Weber in\r\n_Oberon_ and other operas have their fine moments, none approach the\r\nawe-inspiring, continuous beauty of Mozart’s.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to write a great fairy opera, _The Magic Flute_,\r\ncomposed when he was writing the Requiem! Although the librettist wrote\r\nit for money, Mozart wanted it idealistic and true to his beliefs.\r\n\r\n_Cosi Fan Tutti_ (They’re All Alike) was really and truly comic opera,\r\nand _Titus_ shows his mastery of the formal and severe style. So in all\r\nthese he left models for those who followed him. Had he done but this\r\none thing he would have been great indeed.\r\n\r\nComing into the world when he did, he was the connecting link between\r\nthe old Italian opera and Gluck, who idealized what the old Florentines\r\ndid, on the one hand, and the romantic and romantic comic opera of the\r\nlater masters of Germany and France, on the other.\r\n\r\nIn instrumental music he is the link between Haydn and Beethoven. Let us\r\nsee how! He furthered the work of Haydn in the quartets and quintets by\r\nmaking them more human and more expressive of sorrow, pain, passionate\r\ngrief and the deeper things than Haydn. In his six quartets dedicated to\r\nHaydn he says, “I labored over these.” This does not agree with the\r\nusual statement, says Naumann, “that he shook his music out of his\r\nsleeve.”\r\n\r\nOut of his forty-nine symphonies nine rank, some think, with Beethoven’s\r\nnine! In the finale of the Jupiter symphony he does so great a musical\r\nfeat that as yet no one has surpassed it. For in it he writes a fugue\r\nalong with the sonata form of the symphony, so spontaneous and so lovely\r\nthat even Bach himself could not have reached the freshness of it.\r\n\r\nMozart treated the fugue with the same limpid mirthfulness that he used\r\nin less strict forms of music. This Beethoven never achieved for his\r\nfugues were always a bit labored, but Mozart was perfectly at home in\r\ncontrapuntal writing.\r\n\r\nMozart also invented the art song! This is different from the regular\r\nsong for the music changes from verse to verse to make the meaning of\r\nthe poem or words more expressive. Thus he paved the way for Schubert,\r\nSchumann, Brahms and other great song writers, as he did for the\r\nsymphonist Beethoven and those born later.\r\n\r\nHe opened the gate, not to a national art, but to an international art,\r\nfor he was a world figure.\r\n\r\nSo, we leave Mozart, the Genius, for Beethoven, the Colossus, who\r\ndeepened and glorified music and gave it a broader path along which to\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After a “Portrait of a Young Man” (Mozart?) by Prud’hon, in the\r\n    Louvre, Paris._\r\n\r\n  _Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the head by Gourwitch._\r\n\r\n  _Ludwig van Beethoven._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n                         Beethoven the Colossus\r\n                               1770–1827\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us see what was happening in the world into which Beethoven was\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution had closed the 1700s with blood and terror, and\r\nthe American Colonies were uneasy under British rule, and before\r\nBeethoven was six, the American Revolution was in full blast.\r\n\r\nIt was another time like the Renaissance, when people began to think for\r\nthemselves. In other words, the individual was commencing to count more\r\nthan the nation.\r\n\r\nSlowly we see the idea die out that only the nobles and the wealthy had\r\nthe right to life, liberty and happiness, and we see the ideas of\r\nfreedom and equality taking the place of serfdom and slavish obedience\r\nto over-lords. All this may seem strange to appear in a book on music\r\nbut art always mirrors the life and feelings of the people of its time.\r\n\r\nThen came Napoleon, who dragged the French army through the continent of\r\nEurope, until he was defeated at Waterloo by the English.\r\n\r\nThen, too, came the War of 1812 between England and America, and unrest\r\nseemed to be over the face of the world.\r\n\r\nBut through it all came the insistent demand of the people for more\r\ndemocratic governments, and these new demands grudgingly granted by\r\nmonarchs caused revolts and uprisings everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis was the time when men like Goethe, Schiller, Kant, Fichte and other\r\nfamous poets and philosophers did their thinking and writing.\r\n\r\nAnd into this world, the great democrat, Beethoven, came to add his\r\ncontribution to life, liberty, and beauty, as have few others of our\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nAnd so the road is made easy for the people who followed\r\nBeethoven,—Weber, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Chopin, and later\r\nWagner, who helped make the 19th century, a great musical era.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ROMANTICISM\r\n\r\nInstead, now, of people writing around a well known song, as they did in\r\nthe cantus-firmus days, originality was the keynote; instead of\r\nconventional forms, composers began to find new forms and to compose\r\nfrom the heart; instead of writing dainty and graceful music, they wrote\r\nmusic of power; instead of holding back what they wanted to say, they\r\npoured out in rich melody their very deepest, loveliest and most exalted\r\nfeelings,—caring more for what they felt themselves than for the effect\r\non their audiences. Instead, too, of mathematical rules, they wrote\r\nthemselves, their hopes and their fears into their compositions, and\r\nthis freedom is labeled the Romantic Movement in Music.\r\n\r\nNow appeared the great vocal and instrumental soloists (virtuosi). They\r\ndeveloped because of the advance in the making of instruments. Beethoven\r\ncould write more richly with the piano he had, than if he had lived in\r\nBach’s time. For the advance in instruments helps the composer and the\r\ncomposer, the instruments.\r\n\r\nSince music became of age, we have seen many things happen to it: the\r\nadvance in instruments, of the orchestra, and opera, and the development\r\nof the sonata and symphony.\r\n\r\nLudwig van Beethoven was the bridge between the classic writers and\r\nthose to follow him: Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Chopin, and Liszt,\r\nmembers of the “Romantic School.”\r\n\r\nBefore explaining what Beethoven did to advance music, you must hear\r\nabout his life, for he was so interesting that knowing him will help you\r\nto understand his work.\r\n\r\nAlthough born in Bonn, Germany, his ancestors on his father’s side were\r\nof Dutch-Flemish stock like our old friends, Okeghem and Willaert. You\r\nwill notice that the syllable before his last name is “van.” If his name\r\nhad been German, it would have been “von.” He was proud of his Dutch\r\norigin and corrected anyone who misspelled it. This frankness, you will\r\nsee, was a part of his character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AN UNHAPPY BOYHOOD\r\n\r\nHe was born December 16th, 1770, and his mother was the chief cook in\r\nthe Castle of Ehrenbreitstein. His father, a tenor, and his grandfather\r\nwere musicians in the band of the Elector of Cologne at Bonn. His mother\r\nwas sweet and loving, but his father was unkind and intemperate.\r\nAccording to some accounts, his boyhood was spent in poverty and his\r\nfather tried to drive him to earn money for the family. It was very hard\r\non Beethoven that his mother should have died early in his life.\r\n\r\nAt four years of age Ludwig’s father insisted upon his learning to play\r\nthe piano, and as he did not want to practise, he was whipped often.\r\nLater he started to work in earnest and in spite of hating it, played in\r\npublic when he was eight and at eleven he had mastered Bach’s\r\nforty-eight Preludes and Fugues, a difficult task even for a grown up.\r\nBesides, he had written three piano sonatas published in 1781. We think\r\nhe wasted little time after his first whippings!\r\n\r\nWhen thirteen, he went on the opera staff where he played accompaniments\r\nfor rehearsals, without pay. Not a bad job for a lad!\r\n\r\nOne of his first teachers was Pfeiffer, who belonged to the opera troupe\r\nand boarded with the Beethovens. Beethoven now was growing most\r\nenthusiastic about music and took up the study of the organ. Not only\r\nthis, but he wrote a funeral cantata for organ, which excited the whole\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nHe played the piano very beautifully, as did Mozart, and when he went to\r\nHolland with his mother, at eleven, he played at many private houses,\r\nand gained confidence in himself.\r\n\r\nThink of it! When Beethoven was twelve, Neefe, his teacher and organist\r\nat Bonn, left town and Beethoven took his place. This proves his great\r\nability, because playing for services was complicated. He was so\r\nsuccessful that Neefe prophesied he would become a second Mozart!\r\n\r\nIn 1787, Beethoven, despite his poverty, went to Vienna, where Mozart\r\nsaid that he would “make a noise in the world,” and gave the young\r\npianist a few lessons. Not long afterwards, Beethoven was recalled to\r\nBonn where his life was much saddened by the deaths of his mother and\r\nhis little sister.\r\n\r\nAt this time he made the acquaintance of the von Bruening\r\nfamily,—mother, three boys and a girl, whose friendship was one of the\r\ninspiring events of his boyhood. He gave lessons to Eleanore and to a\r\nbrother, and was a close friend to them all. Here he was introduced to\r\nthe marvels of literature, which proved to be a lifelong love and a\r\nsolace for the sad hours after he became deaf. He also accompanied the\r\nvon Bruenings on holidays in the country, and through them met Count\r\nWaldstein, a young noble and amateur musician, who was most enthusiastic\r\nover Beethoven’s budding talent. Through Count Waldstein he was brought\r\nto the attention of the Elector of Bonn, who gave the young musician a\r\nplace as viola player in the orchestra of his national theatre. Here he\r\nmade several lifelong friends,—Franz Ries, who probably taught him to\r\nplay the violin and viola, the two Rombergs, Simrock and Stumpff. His\r\nold teacher Neefe, was pianist and stage manager in the theatre.\r\n\r\nNow his home became most unhappy because of his father’s drunkenness and\r\nbad habits. The Court, however, in 1799, looked after Beethoven and saw\r\nthat part of his father’s salary was paid to him to help him care for\r\nthe family. In addition to this the money he earned by playing and by\r\ngiving lessons enabled him to support his brothers and sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HE MEETS PAPA HAYDN\r\n\r\nWhen Papa Haydn passed through Bonn on his way to London, Beethoven went\r\nto visit him, and brought with him, instead of candy or flowers, a\r\ncantata which he had written for the occasion. Haydn was delighted with\r\nhim and offered to teach him if he would go to Vienna. So, in 1792, on\r\nthe advice of Count Waldstein, we see him again in Vienna, studying\r\ncounterpoint with Haydn. At first he frankly imitated his master, and\r\nalthough he leaned more toward Mozart’s colorfulness of style than\r\nHaydn’s, from the older composer he learned how to treat and develop\r\nthemes, and how to write for the orchestra.\r\n\r\nWhen Haydn left Vienna for his second visit to England, Beethoven\r\nstudied with Albrechtsberger, also with Schenck, Salieri and Förster.\r\nAlthough he was an amazing student his teachers were afraid of and for\r\nhim, for his ideas were ahead of his day. They failed to see in him the\r\ngreat pathfinder, and naturally thought he was a dangerous radical or\r\n“red” as we would say.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BEETHOVEN’S FRIENDSHIPS\r\n\r\nThe story of Beethoven’s life is a story of a few faithful friendships.\r\nHe was not befriended for his personal beauty, but for his inner beauty.\r\nHis head was too big for his body, he did not care what sort of clothes\r\nhe wore, nor did he have any regard for conventions, fashions or great\r\npersonages. He was a real democrat and cared nothing for titles and the\r\nthings smaller men respect. Once Beethoven’s brother called on him and\r\nleft his card upon which was written, next his name, “Man of Property.”\r\nBeethoven in return sent his card on which he wrote, “Man of Brains.”\r\n\r\nThinking that Napoleon was going to free mankind, he dedicated the\r\n_Eroica_, the third symphony, to him. But when he heard that Napoleon\r\nhad set himself up as Emperor, in a violent rage, he trampled on the\r\ndedication page.\r\n\r\nOne day he and Goethe were walking along the street when the King passed\r\nby. Goethe stood aside with uncovered head but Beethoven refused to\r\nalter his path for royalty and kept on his hat, for he felt on an\r\nequality with every man and probably a little superior. But he lost his\r\nfriendship with Goethe because of his many failures to conform to\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-seven Beethoven began to grow deaf. It made him very morose\r\nand unhappy. In 1800 he wrote to his friend Wegeler, the husband of\r\nEleanore von Bruening, “My hearing during the last three years has\r\nbecome gradually worse. I can say with truth that my life is very\r\nwretched. For nearly two years past I have avoided all society because I\r\nfind it impossible to say to people ‘I am deaf.’ In any other profession\r\nthis might be tolerable but in mine, such a condition is truly\r\nfrightful.”\r\n\r\nBeethoven was forceful and noble in spirit, quick tempered,\r\nabsent-minded, gruff, and cared little for manners and customs except to\r\nbe honest and good. But although he was absent-minded he never neglected\r\nhis work or his obligations to any man, and his compositions show the\r\ngreatest care and thought. He worked a piece over and over before it was\r\nfinished and not, like Mozart, did it bubble from him whole and perfect.\r\n\r\nHe was too high-strung and impatient to teach much and Ferdinand Ries,\r\nthe son of Franz, and Czerny seem to be his only well-known pupils. But\r\nhe taught many amateurs among the nobility, which probably accounts for\r\nmany of his romances. In later years, he withdrew unto himself and\r\nbecame irritable and suspicious of everybody, both because of his\r\ndeafness and the misery his family caused him.\r\n\r\nYet this great man, tortured with suspicions and doubt, and storming\r\noften against his handicap, always stood upright and straight and never\r\ndid anything dishonorable or mean. In fact, he was a very moral man, who\r\nlived and composed according to the dictates of his soul and never wrote\r\nto please or to win favor.\r\n\r\nHe made valuable friends among music lovers and patrons such as Prince\r\nand Princess Lichnowsky, Prince Lobkowitz, Count Rasomouwsky, Empress\r\nMaria Theresa and others, to whom he dedicated many of his great works.\r\nThis he did only as a mark of his friendship rather than for gain.\r\n\r\nHe was clumsy and awkward and had bad manners and a quick temper, and he\r\nhad a heavy shock of black hair, that was always in disorder, but the\r\nsoul of the man shone out from his eyes and his smile lit up his face.\r\nAlthough he is said to have been unkempt, he was exceedingly clean, for\r\nwhen he was composing he would often interrupt his work to wash.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Leonore_ overture was being rehearsed, one of the three\r\nbassoon players was missing. Prince Lobkowitz, a friend of Beethoven,\r\njokingly tried to relieve his mind by saying, “It doesn’t make any\r\ndifference, the first and second bassoon are here, don’t mind the\r\nthird.” Beethoven nearly pranced with rage, and reaching the street\r\nlater, where the Prince lived, he crossed the square to the gates of the\r\nPalace and stopped to shout at the entrance, “Donkey of a Lobkowitz!”\r\nand then passed on, raving to himself. But there was a warm, sweet\r\nstreak in his nature for his friends loved him dearly, and he was very\r\ngood to his nephew Carl, who lied to him and deceived him. Carl added to\r\nBeethoven’s unhappiness, for when he was lonely and in need of him, Carl\r\nnever would come to him unless for money.\r\n\r\nBeethoven had a high regard for women and loved Countess Guicciardi, who\r\nrefused many times to marry him, but he dedicated _The Moonlight Sonata_\r\nand some of his songs to her.\r\n\r\nWe see his great heart broken by his nephew, we see his sad letters\r\nbegging him to come and take pity on his loneliness, we see him struggle\r\nto make money for him; and all Carl did was to accept all and give\r\nnothing. Finally this ungrateful boy was expelled from college because\r\nhe failed in his examinations. This was such a disgrace that he\r\nattempted to commit suicide. As this was also looked upon as a crime he\r\nwas given twenty-four hours to leave Vienna and so enlisted in the army.\r\nNevertheless Beethoven made Carl his sole heir. Doesn’t this show him to\r\nbe a really great person?\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BEETHOVEN THE PIANIST\r\n\r\nWhile at Vienna he met the great pianists and played far better than any\r\nof them. No one played with such expression, with such power or seemed\r\nworthy even to compete with him. Mozart and others had been charming\r\nplayers and composers, but Beethoven was powerful and deep, even most\r\nhumorous when he wanted to be.\r\n\r\nHe worked well during these years, and with his usual extreme care\r\nchanged and rechanged the themes he found in his little sketch books\r\ninto which, from boyhood he had put down his musical ideas. Those\r\nmarvelous sketch books! What an example they are! They show infinite\r\npatience and “an infinite capacity for taking pains” which has been\r\ngiven by George Eliot as a definition of genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE THREE PERIODS\r\n\r\nAt his first appearance as a pianist in Vienna he played his own C major\r\nConcerto in 1795. From 1795 to 1803 he wrote all the works from opus 1\r\nto 50. In these were included symphonies 1 and 2, the first three piano\r\nconcertos, and many sonatas for piano, trios and quartets, a septet and\r\nother less important works.\r\n\r\nThis is the first period of Beethoven’s life. His second period in which\r\nhis deafness grew worse and caused him real physical illness, extended\r\nto 1815—in this the trouble with his nephew and the deceit of his two\r\nbrothers preyed on his mind, to such an extent, that he became irascible\r\nand unapproachable. His lodgings were the scene of distressing upheavals\r\nand Beethoven was like a storm-beaten mountain!\r\n\r\nFor consolation, he turned to his music, and in the storm and stress he\r\nwrote the noble opera _Fidelio_, and the third symphony, _Eroica_,\r\nconcertos, sonatas and many other things.\r\n\r\nSomeone once asked him, “Why don’t you write opera?” He replied, “Give\r\nme a libretto noble enough for my music.” Evidently this is the reason\r\nwhy he wrote only one opera. We find another example of his patience and\r\nself-criticism, as he wrote four overtures for _Fidelio_. Three of them\r\nare called _Leonore_ overtures and one _Fidelio_. The third _Leonore_\r\nseems to be the favorite, and is often played.\r\n\r\nBy 1822, the beginning of the third period, the great music maker was\r\nstone deaf! Yet he wrote the magnificent Mass in D and his last\r\nsymphony, the Ninth, with the “Hymn of Joy,” two of the great\r\nmasterpieces of the world, although he was unable to hear one note of\r\nwhat he had composed as he could not hear his beloved violin even when\r\nhe held it close to his ears.\r\n\r\nImagine Beethoven—stone deaf, attending a performance of the Ninth\r\nSymphony in a great hall—not knowing that it had had a triumphal success\r\nuntil one of the soloists turned him around to see the enthusiastic\r\nfaces and the hands clapping and arms waving, for he could hear not a\r\nsound! He who had built such beautiful things for us to hear, knew them\r\nonly in his mind!\r\n\r\nBeethoven was a great lover of nature. He used to stroll with his head\r\ndown and his hands behind his back, clasping his note book in which he\r\njotted down the new ideas as they came to him. He wrote to a friend, “I\r\nwander about here with music paper among the hills and dales and valleys\r\nand scribble a bit; no man on earth could love the country as I do.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BEETHOVEN MAKES MUSIC GROW\r\n\r\nIf you have ever seen a sculptor modeling in clay you know that his\r\ngreat problem is to keep it from drying, because only in the moist state\r\ncan it be moulded into shape. In the same way, we have seen in following\r\nthe growth of music, that no matter how beautiful a style of composition\r\nis, as soon as it becomes set in form, or in other words as soon as it\r\nhardens, it changes. Let us look back to the period of the madrigal. You\r\nremember that the early madrigals were of rare beauty but later the\r\ncomposers became complicated and mechanical in their work and the beauty\r\nand freshness of their compositions were lost. The people who felt this,\r\nreached out for new forms of expression and we see the opera with its\r\narias and recitatives as a result. The great innovator Monteverde, broke\r\nthis spell of the old polyphonic form, which, like the sculptor’s clay,\r\nhad stiffened and dried.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened after Bach brought the suite and fugue to their\r\nhighest. The people again needed something new, and another form grew\r\nout of the suite, the sonata of Philip Emanuel Bach, Haydn and Mozart.\r\nThe works of these men formed the Classic Period which reached its\r\ngreatest height with the colossus, Beethoven. As we told you, he used\r\nthe form inherited from Haydn and Mozart, but added much of a peculiar\r\npower which expressed _himself_. But again the clay hardened! Times and\r\npeople changed, poetry, science and philosophy led the way to more\r\npersonal and shorter forms of expression. Up to Bach’s time, music,\r\noutside of the folk-song, had not been used to express personal feeling;\r\nthe art was too young and had grown up in the Church which taught the\r\ndenial of self-expression.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the paintings up to the time of the 16th century did\r\nnot express personal feelings and happenings, but were only allowed to\r\nbe of religious subjects, for the decorating of churches and cathedrals.\r\n\r\nBeethoven, besides being the peak of the classic writers, pointed the\r\nway for the music of personal expression, not mere graceful expression\r\nas was the fashion, which was called the “Romantic School” because he\r\nwas big enough to combine the sonata form of classic mould with the\r\ndelicacy, humor, pathos, nobility and singing beauty for which the\r\npeople of his day yearned.\r\n\r\nThis led again to the crashing of the large and dried forms made perfect\r\nby Beethoven and we see him as the bridge which leads to Mendelssohn,\r\nChopin, Schubert and Schumann and we see them expressing in shorter form\r\nevery possible human mood.\r\n\r\nBeethoven was great enough to bring music to maturity so that it\r\nexpressed not only forms of life, but life itself.\r\n\r\nHow and what did he do? First, he became master of the piano and could\r\nfrom childhood sit down and make marvelous improvisations. He studied\r\nall forms of music, counterpoint, harmony, and orchestration. At first\r\nhe followed the old forms, as we see in the first two symphonies. In the\r\nthird symphony, the _Eroica_, he changed from the minuet (a relic of the\r\nold dance suite) to the scherzo, an enlarged form of the minuet with\r\nmore chance for musical expression,—the minuet grown up. In sonatas like\r\n_The Pathetique_, he used an introduction and often enlarged the coda or\r\nending, to such an extent that it seems like an added movement, so rich\r\nwas he in power in working over a theme into beautiful musical speech.\r\n\r\nLater we see him abandoning set forms and writing the _Waldstein_ Sonata\r\nin free and beautiful ways. Even the earlier sonatas like _The\r\nMoonlight_ and its sister, Opus 27, No. 2, are written so freely that\r\nthey are called Fantasy Sonatas, so full of free, flowing melody has the\r\nsonata become under his hand.\r\n\r\nHis work becomes so lofty and so grand, whether in humorous or in\r\nserious vein, that when we compare his compositions to those of other\r\nmen, he seems like one of the loftiest mountain peaks in the world,\r\nreaching into the heavens, yet with its base firmly standing in the\r\nmidst of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    A COMPOSER OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC\r\n\r\nBeethoven was distinctly a composer of instrumental music, although he\r\nwrote the opera _Fidelio_, also the Ninth Symphony in which he made\r\ngreat innovations in symphonic form and introduced the Choral.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, composers in the Classic School had paid more attention\r\nto the voice and to the soloists in the concertos than to the orchestra.\r\nThus we see men like Mozart leaving a space toward the end of the\r\nmovement in a concerto for the soloist to make up his own closing salute\r\nto his audience before the orchestra ended the piece. These cadenzas\r\nbecame acrobatic feats in which the players wrote the most difficult\r\n“show-off” music. Beethoven, with his love for the orchestra and his\r\nfeeling that the soloist and the orchestra should make one complete\r\nunit, wrote the cadenza _himself_ and thereby made the composition one\r\nbeautiful whole rather than a sandwich of the composer, soloist and\r\ncomposer again.\r\n\r\nFancy all this from a man who, when he multiplied 14 × 26 had to add\r\nfourteen twenty-sixes in a column! We saw this column of figures written\r\non a manuscript of Beethoven’s in an interesting collection, and the\r\nstory goes that Beethoven tried to verify a bill that was brought to him\r\nin the midst of a morning of hard work at his composing.\r\n\r\nBesides his symphonies, concertos and sonatas in which are light moods,\r\ndark moods, gay and sad moods, spiritual heights and depths, filling\r\nhearers with all beauty of emotion,—he wrote gay little witty things,\r\nlike the German Dances, The Fury over the Loss of a Penny (which is\r\nreally funny), four overtures, many English, Scotch, Irish, Welsh and\r\nItalian folk-song settings. He also wrote one oratorio called _The Mount\r\nof Olives_, two masses, one of which is the magnificent _Missa\r\nSolemnis_, one concerto for the violin that is the masterpiece of its\r\nkind, and the one grand opera _Fidelio_.\r\n\r\nThus we have told you about the bridge to the “Romantic Movement” which\r\nwill follow in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nBeethoven could have said with Robert Browning’s “Abt Vogler”\r\n\r\n   Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told;\r\n   It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws....\r\n\r\n   And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,\r\n   That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Johann Sebastian Bach._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _George Frederick Handel._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Franz Josef Haydn._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Carl Maria von Weber._\r\n]\r\n\r\n        Three Classic Composers and an Early Romantic Composer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _The Piano and Its Grand-parents._\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of Morris Steinert & Sons, Company_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n         The Pianoforte Grows Up—The Ancestry of the Pianoforte\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ANCESTRY OF THE PIANOFORTE\r\n\r\nWe feel so familiar with the Pianoforte that we call it piano for short\r\nand almost forget that it is dignified by the longer name. We forget\r\ntoo, that Scarlatti, Rameau and Bach played not on the piano but on its\r\nancestors, and that Byrd, Bull and Gibbon did not write their lovely\r\ndance suites for the instrument on which we play them today.\r\n\r\nThe Pianoforte’s family tree has three distinct branches,—strings,\r\nsounding board and hammers. First we know the piano is a stringed\r\ninstrument, although it hides its chief characteristic, not under a\r\nbushel, but behind a casing of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WHERE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS CAME FROM\r\n\r\nWe have seen the stringed instrument developed from the bow when\r\nprimitive man winged his arrow in the hunt, and heard its twang. Later\r\ndesiring fuller tone, the sounding board grew, when early peoples sank\r\nbow-like instruments and reeds into a gourd which increased and\r\nreflected the sound as the metal reflector behind a light intensifies\r\nit.\r\n\r\nStrings to produce sound, must be rubbed, like the bow drawn across\r\nviolin strings, plucked as the mandolin or the harp is plucked, or\r\nstruck with a hammer as was the dulcimer.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient times there were two instruments much alike, the\r\n_psaltery_ and the _dulcimer_, both with a triangular or rectangular\r\nsounding box across which are stretched strings of wire or gut fastened\r\nto tuning pins. The difference between these two “relatives” is that the\r\n_psaltery_ is plucked with fingers or a plectrum, and the _dulcimer_ is\r\nstruck with hammers. So the _psaltery_ is the grandfather of the\r\nvirginal, spinet, clavecin, and harpsichord, while the _dulcimer_ is the\r\nremote ancestor of the pianoforte.\r\n\r\nThe first record we find of a _dulcimer_ is a stone picture near\r\nNineveh, of an Assyrian king in 667 B.C., celebrating a triumphal\r\nprocession. This _dulcimer_, suspended from the neck of the player, is\r\nbeing struck with a stick in his right hand, while his left palm on the\r\nstring checks the tone. Here we have the first stringed instrument which\r\nwas hammered and muffled, two important elements in the piano.\r\n\r\nIn Persia the _dulcimer_ was called the _santir_ and is still used under\r\ndifferent names in the Orient and other places. In Greece and other\r\ncountries it was called the _psalterion_, and in Italy, the _dolcimelo_.\r\nLater, the Germans had a sort of _dulcimer_ called the _Hackbrett_,\r\nprobably because it was “hacked” as the butcher hacks meat! We see the\r\n_dulcimer_ in many shapes according to the fancy of the people who use\r\nit. The word comes from _dulce_—the Latin for “sweet” and _melos_—the\r\nGreek for “melody.”\r\n\r\nAs people grew wiser and more musical, they padded their hammers or\r\nmallets; this gave the idea for the padded hammer of the piano for\r\nchecking the tone as our Ninevehan did with his left palm.\r\n\r\nShould you ever listen to a gypsy band, you will hear the _dulcimer_ or\r\n_cembalo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE KEYBOARD\r\n\r\nThe third element in the making of the piano is the keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the piano keyboard and the organ keyboard are\r\npractically the same. The water organs of the Greeks and Romans had\r\nkeyboards, but as the Christian Church forbade the use of organs as\r\nsacrilegious, keyboards were lost for almost a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard seems to have developed from the Greek _monochord_ used in\r\nthe Middle Ages to give the pitch in convent singing. It was tuned with\r\na movable bridge or fret pushed back and forth under the strings and\r\nfingers. First it was stretched with weights hung at one end. It was a\r\nsimple matter to add strings to produce more tones, later tuning pins\r\nwere added and finally a keyboard. This was the whole principle of the\r\n_clavichord_. (We might say that the _monochord_ and _dulcimer_ are the\r\nAdam and Eve of the pianoforte family.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE CLAVICHORD\r\n\r\nIn the clavichord, each key drove a metal tangent against a string and\r\nwas held there as was the bridge of the monochord. The tone was\r\ndependent on the place where the tangent struck. The string vibrated on\r\none side of the tangent, but the other part of the string was deadened\r\nby a strip of cloth. The strings were about the same length and often\r\ntwo or three keys operated the same string so that it was possible to\r\nmake a very small instrument. In the 16th century, it usually had twenty\r\nkeys; in the 18th century, four octaves or fifty keys, but of course\r\nthere were less than fifty strings! Later, every key had its own string\r\nand these were called _bundfrei_ or unfretted clavichords, while the\r\nothers were called _gebunden_ or fretted. The clavichord was usually\r\nsmall enough to carry under the arm, although sometimes it was made with\r\nlegs. Should you be in New York you must see the collection of\r\nbeautifully ornamented clavichords and harpsichords at the Metropolitan\r\nMuseum of Art in the Crosby Brown Collection.\r\n\r\nBach liked the clavichord better than the harpsichord and the early\r\npianos that blossomed in his day. Because of the pressure of the\r\ntangent, it was possible to get a delicately graded tone when the key\r\nwas pressed, a wavy, rocking, pulsating effect, which made each player’s\r\nperformance very individual, but to us, now, it sounds thin and\r\nmetallic. The word “clavichord” comes from _clavis_—a key, and _chord_—a\r\nstring. Clavichords and also virginals were often played in pairs, no\r\ndoubt for richer effect and for volume.\r\n\r\nLarge instruments developed slowly because before the 11th century,\r\nwire-drawing (making) was not known, so all keyed string instruments\r\nwere strung with gut.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HARPSICHORD\r\n\r\n\r\n                              128TH SONNET\r\n                  SHAKESPEARE AND THE HARPSICHORD\r\n\r\n          How oft when thou, my music, music play’st\r\n          Upon that blessed wood, whose motion sounds\r\n          With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway’st\r\n          The wiry concord that my ear confounds,\r\n          Do I envy those _jacks_ that nimble leap\r\n          To kiss the tender inward of thy hand:\r\n          Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,\r\n          At the wood’s boldness, by thee blushing stand!\r\n          To be so tickled they would change their state\r\n          And situation with those dancing chips,\r\n          O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gate,\r\n          Making dead wood more blessed than living lips.\r\n          Since saucy _jacks_ so happy are in this\r\n          Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\r\n\r\nThe harpsichord, we like to call the “Jack and Quill” instrument—for it\r\nis played by keys, jacks and quills which pluck its strings, instead of\r\npressing or hammering. This is like a keyboarded zither, and is shaped\r\nsomething like our grand piano.\r\n\r\nEach key has a string. Pressing the key pushes a jack, from whose side\r\nprojects a small quill or spine which twangs the string. When the key is\r\nreleased, the quill slips back into the first position and a damper\r\nfalls upon the string. The strings vary in length according to the pitch\r\nfor the harpsichord has no tangent to divide off the string as had the\r\nclavichord and monochord. Thus the harpsichord on account of its long\r\nand short strings is not square like the clavichord but is shaped more\r\nlike the harp and the grand piano.\r\n\r\nSome one said that the harpsichord tone was “a scratch with a note at\r\nthe end of it.” And yet, when we hear Wanda Landowska play the\r\nharpsichord today, it sounds very beautiful indeed. Smaller varieties\r\nare called virginals and spinets. Perhaps the spinet is named for its\r\ninventor Spinetti, or perhaps the word comes from “spinet” meaning\r\nspine, a thorn or point. The virginal comes from the word\r\n_virgo_—meaning maiden and was the popular instrument for the “ladies”\r\nof the day. There were larger harpsichords, too, with two and three\r\nkeyboards and very many varieties, both small and large. The clavichord\r\nand the harpsichord were known from the 15th century and were associated\r\nwith the organ until the 17th century, when the Ruckers family developed\r\nharpsichord making into a fine art. The first mention of the\r\nharpsichord, is in the “Rules of the Minnesingers” (1404).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FIRST PIANOFORTES\r\n\r\nEarly in the 18th century, music ceased to be just pretty sounds, and\r\nmusicians wanted instruments on which they could express deeper feelings\r\nand began to look around for some way to make the harpsichord meet this\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nIt came about in this way. Pantaleone Hebenstreit, a fiddler at the\r\nSaxon court played a dulcimer which he enlarged by adding to it a second\r\nsystem of strings. He tuned it in equal temperament, as Bach had the\r\nclavichord, and used hammers on it which produced very beautiful and\r\nloud tones. Louis XIV saw this, and liking it, called it the Pantaleone.\r\nBut, shortly after this, Gottlieb Schroeter heard it and said, “only\r\nthrough hammers can the harpsichord become expressive.”\r\n\r\nSo in 1721 Schroeter submitted to the King of Saxony his idea of a\r\nharpsichord which could play soft and loud or in Italian _piano_ and\r\n_forte_ (the _fortepiano_ or _loud-soft_ instrument). But as he had none\r\nmade he did not get credit for the invention until after much argument,\r\nbased on accounts in his diary. As always, when a thing is needed\r\nsomeone will invent it.\r\n\r\nThe man who actually made the first pianoforte was an Italian,\r\nBartolomeo Cristofori (1653–1731) of Padua; and the Frenchman Marius,\r\nand the German, Christoph Gottlieb Schroeter, followed suit. In 1709,\r\nCristofori exhibited harpsichords (_gravicembali_) with hammer action\r\ncapable of producing _piano_ and _forte_ effects. He advertised it in\r\nthe paper as a _gravicembali col piano e forte_. By 1711, the fame of\r\nhis invention had spread into Germany. In February, 1716, Marius in\r\nFrance tried to improve the harpsichord with hammers which he called the\r\n_clavecin à mallets_, and made two types.\r\n\r\nSchroeter about this time made the two kinds also. The piano had little\r\nstanding, however, until Gottfried Silbermann took advantage of Bach’s\r\ncriticism of his pianos and made a _grand_ type.\r\n\r\nThe next experimenters in pianos were, Frederici of Gera (died in 1779),\r\nwho made the _square_. Spaeth, who made _grands_ and George Andreas\r\nStein in Augsburg, who was trained by Silbermann, invented the Viennese\r\naction on which a light touch was possible and for this reason Mozart\r\nused it.\r\n\r\nBurkhardt Tschudi, a piano maker in London, had a Scotch assistant,\r\nJames Broadwood, who became his partner (1770). Later the firm became\r\nJohn Broadwood and Sons, which it has remained. It was the first to use\r\nthe damper and the soft pedals. For some time they used Zumpe’s style of\r\nsquare piano but later made their own. This house used the Cristofori\r\naction which made a more solid and heavier tone than the Viennese\r\naction, and was known as the English action, excellent for large rooms\r\nand concerts. These actions suited the different methods of piano\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\nStein’s daughter Nanette Streicher, a marvelous player and a cultivated\r\nwoman, upon inheriting her father’s piano business moved to Vienna and\r\nfor forty years was considered an expert in the piano world. Thayer, in\r\nhis life of Beethoven says: “In May, Beethoven, on the advice of medical\r\nmen, went to Baden, whither he was followed by his friend Mrs.\r\nStreicher ... who took charge of his lodgings and his clothes, which\r\nappear to have been in a deplorable state.” Thayer says that Beethoven\r\nalways preferred the piano of Stein to any others. Beethoven wrote to\r\nNanette: “Perhaps you do not know, though I have not always had one of\r\nyour pianos, that since 1809 I have invariably preferred yours.”\r\n\r\nSo, you see a woman could keep house and be a manufacturer as well, even\r\nin the early 19th century!\r\n\r\nThen came Sebastien Erard (1752–1831) who made the first French piano in\r\n1777. Erard invented many new things for the piano and formed a company\r\nin England. This firm was advertised on the hand bill announcing Liszt’s\r\nconcert in Paris when he was twelve years old.\r\n\r\nAdded to these names is Ignaz Josef Pleyel (1757–1831), who also made a\r\npiano with a very sympathetic tone which Chopin made famous from 1831.\r\nThe Pleyel and the Erard are still the leading pianos of France.\r\n\r\nFor some years the pianoforte went through many changes. As you are not\r\nlearning to make a piano, you will have to take it for granted that\r\nthere were many many steps taken from this time on to make the modern\r\npiano. However, the thing that held it back was the all-wood frame which\r\ncould not stand the strain of the tightly drawn strings and it was a\r\nlong time before the makers gave up the beautiful wood for the sturdier\r\nmetal. About the time of Beethoven, playing the piano became a more\r\ncomplicated thing than it had been, and a grown up instrument was\r\nneeded, so musical instrument makers had to “step lively” to keep pace\r\nwith the music. At every concert, and often in the middle of a piece,\r\nthe player would have to stop to retune the instrument on which he was\r\nplaying. Therefore, all energy was bent to making the frame of the piano\r\nrigid, the strings more elastic and the pins firmer, and the metal frame\r\nwas used.\r\n\r\nAll these special things were accomplished in later years. Some of the\r\ninventors were John Isaac Hawkins, an Englishman, who patented the\r\nupright pianoforte in 1800 in the United States, William Allen, a\r\nScotchman, who introduced metal braces in 1820 and Alpheus Babcock, who\r\npatented the iron frame in a _single cast_, in Boston, in 1825. It was\r\nan American, Jonas Chickering, of Boston, who invented the complete iron\r\nframe for the concert grand, and at present, after many years, the\r\ninstrument which seventy-five years ago bent under the pull of the\r\nstrings, can now stand the strain of thirty tons! Chickering made pianos\r\nas early as 1823.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was much experimentation in pianos, culminating here,\r\nin the pianos made by Steinway and Sons the ancestor of which was the\r\nfirm of Heinrich Englehard Steinweg, of Brunswick, Germany, starting as\r\norgan makers. In 1848 Heinrich’s sons went to New York City and changed\r\ntheir name to Steinway, where Theodore, the eldest, continued the firm\r\nas Steinway and Sons.\r\n\r\nOf course, the methods of stringing and tuning a piano have taken years\r\nto develop—all of which we cannot go into in this book. Now, instead of\r\ntwenty strings, as we saw them in the clavichord, we have 243 strings to\r\nproduce 88 tones.\r\n\r\nSo now we have the harpsichord with hammers “grown up” into the\r\npianoforte, with its myriad parts, no longer made by hand, but carefully\r\nmanufactured by machinery and the finest of them are American.\r\n\r\n\r\n           PIANO BUYING CREATED A HOLIDAY IN THE 18TH CENTURY\r\n\r\n“When the pianoforte was completed and ready to be delivered at the\r\nhouse of the impatient purchaser (in Germany) a festival took place; the\r\nmaker, was the hero of the hour, and accompanied the piano followed by\r\nhis craftsman and apprentices, if he had any. (In those days the pianos\r\ntook months and months to make, for they were made by hand and the\r\nmakers received cash in part payment and the rest was made up in corn,\r\nwheat, potatoes, poultry and firewood!)\r\n\r\n“The wagon which conveyed the precious burden was gaily decorated with\r\nwreaths and flowers, the horses magnificently decked out, a band of\r\nmusic headed the procession, and after the wagon followed the proud\r\nmaker, borne on the shoulders of his assistants; musicians, organists,\r\nschoolmasters and dignitaries marching in the rear. At the place of\r\ndestination the procession was received with greetings of welcome and\r\nshouts of joy. The pastor of the place said a prayer and blessed the new\r\ninstrument and its maker. Then the mayor or the burgomaster of the place\r\ndelivered an address,—dwelling at great length upon the importance of\r\nthe event to the whole community, and stating, perhaps, that the coming\r\nof such a new musical instrument would raise their place in the eyes of\r\nthe surrounding country. Then followed speeches by the schoolmaster,\r\ndoctor, druggist, and other dignitaries, and songs by the _Männerchor_\r\n(men’s chorus) of the place. Amidst the strains of the band, the\r\npianoforte was moved to its new home. A banquet and a dance closed the\r\nhappy occasion.” (From _Reminiscences of Morris Steinert_ by Jane\r\nMarlin.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       “THE PIANO AND PNEUMATICS”\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to know just when this important instrument first\r\nwas invented. It seems to have started with a mechanical organ and many\r\nwere the experimenters among whom was John McTammany, a soldier in the\r\nCivil War who while disabled turned his mind to mechanics and became one\r\nof the great pneumatic (air power) experts. And so, just as we arrive at\r\nthe beautiful instrument, the piano, comes another instrument far more\r\ncomplicated, whose possibilities are still in its infancy. At present\r\nthe automatic piano is operated by bellows and pneumatic tubes (which\r\nlook together like a bunch of gray spaghetti) and through which the air\r\nis exhausted and acts in such a way that the piano hammers fall against\r\nthe piano strings. Into these instruments are placed perforated music\r\nrolls which travel over a tracker bar full of holes, each one having its\r\nrubber spaghetti tube. When the bellows work and the perforation of the\r\nroll passes over a perforation of the tracker bar, the air is released\r\nand its exhaustion causes the hammer to fall on the strings. This sounds\r\nsimple,—but it is not!\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of automatic players,—one, the _piano player_,\r\nwhich is now practically extinct in this country, a cabinet which moves\r\nup to the piano, and with a series of keys corresponding to the keys on\r\nthe piano which, when in action presses down the piano keys and the tune\r\nstarts.\r\n\r\nThen we have the _player piano_. In this, whether it be an upright or a\r\ngrand piano, the machinery is inside the piano itself (instead of being\r\nin the outside cabinet), so that one can hardly tell at first glance\r\nwhether it is an automatic instrument or not. The perforated roll is put\r\non inside the piano.\r\n\r\nAll these piano player bellows work either by electricity or by the\r\nfeet. So in the latter, one cannot help playing with “sole”!\r\n\r\nThe _reproducing piano_ is the third type of player. This is magical,\r\nfor it reproduces the player’s performance as he plays it himself.\r\nTherefore we can entice Paderewski, Bauer, Rachmaninoff and all the\r\nother great players into our own drawing rooms and hear them with their\r\nsuperb skill. These are usually operated by electricity, yet the Æolian\r\nCompany and probably others, have a _reproducing piano_ which is\r\npropelled by the pedals as were the old ones before the invention of the\r\nelectric player. Furthermore, some of the reproducing pianos have a\r\nmechanism with which you yourself can interpret any piece you desire.\r\nThis gives the music lover who has been denied the study of music a\r\nchance to enjoy interpreting great music.\r\n\r\nIt is an impossibility to overestimate the value of the player piano to\r\nthe young student, to increase his auditory repertoire, for the music of\r\nthe world is his for the turning of a lever!\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ART\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the mechanical player has been looked on as a\r\nstep-child, to be made fun of and scorned. Today, the great critics and\r\nbest musicians recognize its value which is not as a substitute for a\r\npiano but as an instrument in itself. Sir Henry J. Wood of England says:\r\n“I realize the value ... of the pianola ... for a good many of the\r\npeople in our audiences ... are acquiring by its means a closer\r\nacquaintance with the great musical masterpieces.”\r\n\r\nHe says in another place, “It’s a foolish and a shortsighted policy to\r\ndespise any means by which we may add to the sum total of musical\r\nappreciation.”\r\n\r\nAnd Edwin Evans, English critic and writer, says: “The player piano\r\nrelieves the musician of the technical difficulties of the keyboard....\r\nIt does not relieve him from the duty of thinking musicianly, on the\r\ncontrary, ... it makes it a point of honor with him to give ... fuller\r\nemployment to his brain and sensibility.... There are dozens of scores\r\nnowadays which it is an impossibility to read at the piano and very\r\ntrying to read on paper. Here the player piano is a boon and a blessing\r\nfor it unravels every mystery and solves every problem.”\r\n\r\nBesides this, it can be played so skilfully by some that even musicians\r\ncan be fooled as to whether human or mechanical fingers are playing.\r\nGustave Kobbé said, in his _Pianolist_, something like this: “There are\r\nonly about five professionals who can play the piano better than an\r\naccomplished pianolist.”\r\n\r\nTo prove its artistic worth further, Percy Grainger, Alfredo Casella and\r\nIgor Stravinsky and other great moderns are writing music especially for\r\nthe player piano because they can use the whole eighty-eight notes with\r\nfull orchestral effects, without stopping to think of the meagre ten\r\nfingers of man! So we see in the future the possibility of this becoming\r\none of the creative instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OTHER “CANNED” MUSIC\r\n\r\nThen we have the phonographs and radio. These cannot be considered\r\ninstruments in the same way as the player piano and reproducing piano,\r\nbut are invaluable means of musical education and are doing, with the\r\nplayer piano, a marvelous work in introducing people to the great music\r\nof the world. Of course, it depends upon the way all these music\r\ncarriers are used, for if you have poor music on them, it will mean\r\nnothing to you, but if you hear the “wear evers” on them, you will have\r\na touch of heaven in your life, forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PIANISTS COME TO VIEW\r\n\r\nAs an outcome of the work of Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, the piano\r\nappeared because of the need of a more powerful instrument than the\r\nharpsichord and clavichord. At this time there were two particular\r\nschools of piano playing,—the Viennese, light and delicate in tone, and\r\nthe English school, producing a more solid and more brilliant tone.\r\n\r\nThe principal pianists of the Viennese school were Johann Hummel, who,\r\nas a boy of seven, was a pupil of Mozart, Franz Duschek, Mozart and\r\nPleyel. Later Beethoven himself appeared, the profound pianist in this\r\ngroup, but also an advocate of Clementi’s methods.\r\n\r\nThe Clementi School is named from Muzio Clementi (1752–1832), the\r\n“Father of the Pianoforte.” He was a composer of piano pieces,\r\nespecially of sonatas which are still of musical value. Who of us has\r\nnot studied Clementi’s sonatinas? Besides being a great player, a\r\nteacher and a composer, Clementi published a work called _Gradus ad\r\nParnassum_, piano studies, a form which sprang up because of the need to\r\ndevelop a technic for the new instruments when the piano was young.\r\n\r\nClementi, at fourteen, went to England, where he lived all his life and\r\nbecame interested in the making of pianos. He was associated with the\r\nfirm of Clementi and Company, later Collard and Collard, and it is said\r\nthat he gave the Broadwoods much advice in the making of their “grand”\r\npiano. So we see Clementi as a founder of piano technic, and an\r\ninstrument maker! He lived eighty years, during the last years of Handel\r\nand Scarlatti, and he survived Beethoven, Schubert and Weber. It is said\r\nthat Mozart took a theme from a Clementi sonata for one of his operas.\r\nHis pupils were quite famous: John B. Cramer, the composer of many\r\nimportant piano studies still in use; Johann L. Dussek, one of the first\r\nto invent and write down finger exercises, and there were many others.\r\n\r\nThere were two schools with Clementi at the head of one, and Mozart, of\r\nthe other. With Hummel, a pupil of Mozart, the Classic School closed,\r\nand then Clementi’s ideas came to the fore in the new Romantic School.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE NEW ROMANTIC SCHOOL\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of these new Romanticists was John Field, who was\r\nborn in Ireland, visited London, had quite a career in Russia and\r\nforeshadowed Chopin in his playing. Then there was Ferdinand Ries, son\r\nof Beethoven’s early friend and teacher, Franz Ries; but the most famous\r\nof this period were Ignaz Moscheles and Frederick Kalkbrenner, a fluent\r\ncomposer and writer of studies. He was the first pianist to teach\r\nClementi’s _Gradus ad Parnassum_.\r\n\r\nIgnaz Moscheles (1794–1870) was a Bohemian and from about 1815, the most\r\nbrilliant pianist in Germany, France, Holland and England. He was\r\nMendelssohn’s teacher. Chopin wrote three études (studies) on an order\r\nfrom Moscheles. He is a _very_ important figure in the growing up of\r\npiano music.\r\n\r\nCarl Czerny (1791–1857) was another _very_ important pianist and one of\r\nthe few pupils of Beethoven. He was a follower of Hummel and Clementi\r\nand won great fame as a teacher in Vienna, where he lived. He wrote a\r\ngreat many pieces, about a thousand in all, making many arrangements of\r\norchestral works and many piano studies, which we still use today.\r\nBeethoven encouraged him to make a piano version of his _Fidelio_.\r\nCzerny was the teacher of many able musicians.\r\n\r\nFrederick Chopin, you will find out later (Chapter 24) changed piano\r\nmusic from the bravura to a poetic and deeper style. His touch and tone\r\nwere so enchanting that he created a completely new fashion in piano\r\nplaying which has not been lost. (See page 322.)\r\n\r\nClara Schumann (1819–1896), the wife of Robert Schumann, was the leading\r\nwoman pianist of the day, in fact, of many days.\r\n\r\nIn the times of Mozart and of Liszt, improvising (before audiences and\r\nat parlor entertainments), was very popular and a part of a musical\r\neducation; around 1795, after the Paris Conservatory was founded, it\r\nseemed to die out. However, organists today often improvise while\r\nwaiting for the church service to begin. Dupré, one of the famous French\r\norganists, who has played in the United States, improvises whole sonatas\r\non given themes.\r\n\r\nAfter Chopin, Schumann and Schubert there was a great love of the short\r\npiano piece and as the piano was being developed more and more, it was\r\nnatural that pianists should become numerous. So piano playing was heard\r\nin the concert hall and in the parlor where it was, to be sure, often\r\nlight and frivolous and yet quite often,—serious and delightful. The\r\nlight and decorated pieces were usually called _salon music_ and today\r\nmany are written which are classed as _salon pieces_. Cécile Chaminade,\r\nas delightful and clever as her pieces are, is a typical _salon_\r\ncomposer, Rubinstein, also, with such pieces as _Melody in F_, is a\r\nwriter of salon pieces, and there are countless others.\r\n\r\nAmong the people who were prominent as pianists and composers in that\r\nday, especially in Poland, where Chopin was born, were Alois Tausig, a\r\npupil of Thalberg and Josef Wieniawski, who was the teacher of the “Lion\r\nof Pianists,” Ignace Jan Paderewski.\r\n\r\nAround Paris gathered many pianists among whom were Ignace Leybach an\r\norganist and composer at Toulouse, Henry Charles Litolff the famous\r\npublisher, Louis Moreau Gottschalk, American pianist and the author of\r\n_The Last Hope_, and Eugene Ketterer. The following, with many others,\r\ncentered around Vienna: Joseph Löw, Theodore Kullak, Louis Köhler,\r\nGustav Lange and Louis Brassin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DASHING PLAYING\r\n\r\nA little later, due to the improvements of the piano, another school\r\ngrew up called by some, the Bravura Pianists, because the pieces for\r\nthese pianists were written to show off brilliant technic. Most of the\r\npeople were flashy pianists, yet there were some very marvelous\r\nperformers, for among them, Liszt himself figures and Thalberg, a Swiss,\r\nwho was Liszt’s rival for piano honors.\r\n\r\nAnother set of pianists and composers was Henry Herz, Alexander\r\nDreyschock, Emil Prudent and Adolph Henselt, a Bavarian, who was an\r\namazingly poetic and beautiful player.\r\n\r\nPractically all these pianists were prominent composers in their day.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we see women coming into great prominence as\r\nprofessional pianists. The first one to interest us is Marie Felicité\r\nDenise (Moke) Pleyel, who was Miss Moke, the beloved of Berlioz and the\r\nlady whom he intended to kill but changed his mind! She was an inspiring\r\nteacher, a pupil of Herz, Moscheles and Kalkbrenner and was admired by\r\nMendelssohn and Liszt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE GROWTH OF VIOLIN MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe same things seem to have happened to violin playing and violin music\r\nat this time as happened to the piano. There was always the competition\r\nbetween writing fine, deep music and showy, spectacular music, which,\r\nwhen played, would please an audience. But the violin was the same then\r\nas it had been for years,—the only advance it had made was the\r\nperfecting of the bow by François Tourte, assisted by Giovanni Battista\r\nViotti, Pugnani’s greatest pupil. We use his bow today. It has about one\r\nhundred white horsehairs, the tension of which is controlled by a screw\r\nat the nut in the finger grip. But the thing that did affect violinists\r\nand violin playing was the fact of the rise in the 19th century of the\r\norchestra and chamber music. From the time that madrigals were first\r\naccompanied by instruments, we have heard about _Chamber Music_, but the\r\nstring quartet in sonata form as we know it today, had as its father,\r\nHaydn, and Luigi Boccherini (1743–1805) as a godfather. The link between\r\nthe Corelli School of violinists and this school was Viotti who was one\r\nof the first men to write a violin concerto in sonata form.\r\n\r\nThe violinists of this period were also given to bravura playing as were\r\nthe pianists. This was a safe thing for great violinists like Paganini\r\nto do, but for the less gifted, it often developed into, not music at\r\nall, but musical calisthenics. Here is the group which appeared in the\r\nearly 19th century: Rudolph Kreutzer, to whom Beethoven dedicated his\r\nfamous _Kreutzer Sonata_; Andreas Romberg (1767–1821) who knew Haydn and\r\nBeethoven at Vienna and took Spohr’s place as concert master at Gotha.\r\nHe wrote music somewhat in the style of Mozart. Then comes the “Wizard\r\nof the Bow,” Nicolo Paganini, standing alone and belonging to no school.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Genoa and began to play in public in 1795, when he was\r\nthirteen years old. A very pretty story is told of Paganini and the\r\nspider:\r\n\r\nWhen Nicolo was a very poor and lonely student, he had a pet spider that\r\nused to listen to him practise. Every time Nicolo would touch the bow to\r\nthe strings, out came Mr. Spider to listen attentively. Now there was a\r\nlittle girl, the daughter of a shop-keeper near by; she adored the\r\ngreat, tall, slender youth who spent most of the day and most of the\r\nnight playing on his violin. She fell ill and died, and by a curious\r\ncoincidence, the spider was killed. Paganini was so overcome by the loss\r\nof his admiring comrades that he left home at once and wandered from\r\nplace to place, playing the guitar when he could not get work with his\r\nviolin.\r\n\r\nLater he played all over Europe and had the crowd with him for his\r\nmatchless brilliancy in rapid work, his deep pathos and exceptional\r\nbeauty of tone. He has probably never been surpassed in double stopping,\r\nchromatics and his _pizzicati_ (plucking the strings). Isn’t it too bad\r\nthe greatest violinist in the world lived before the gramophone was\r\ninvented, so we have no records of his playing as we have of Mischa\r\nElman, Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, Albert Spalding and Maud Powell!\r\n\r\nIn this period, Ludwig Spohr was of great importance. He was a friend of\r\nMendelssohn and, curious enough, was an admirer (one of the early ones)\r\nof Wagner. He had been an intimate of Weber and played with Paganini at\r\nRome and knew Rossini. His rank as a violinist was acknowledged. He did\r\nnot stand for “fire works” but demanded fine music. He was always a\r\nclassical musician, for his early love was Mozart. You will meet him\r\nagain in the next chapter. He traveled all over Europe and met many\r\ngreat men and his autobiography is a rich store of anecdotes and\r\ninteresting facts.\r\n\r\nAt this time too, there were many great violinists in France, Austria,\r\nGermany and Italy. We would like to write a whole volume on the\r\nbrilliant pianists of the late 19th and 20th centuries such as\r\nPaderewski, De Pachman, Godowsky, Busoni, Rosenthal, Harold Bauer,\r\nGabrilowitsch, Hofmann, Rachmaninov, Teresa Carreño, Myra Hess, Guiomar\r\nNovaes, Katherine Bacon, John Powell, Percy Grainger, Levitski and\r\ninnumerable others!\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MORE ABOUT RADIO\r\n\r\n1927 witnessed the broadcasting of enchanting concerts by the Boston\r\nSymphony under Serge Koussevitzky, The New York Philharmonic Orchestra\r\nunder Willem Mengelberg, The New York Symphony under Walter Damrosch,\r\nChildren’s Concerts under Ernest Schelling and many other organizations.\r\nThe important broadcasting companies maintain superb musical\r\norganizations and there is growing up a valuable radio musical field for\r\npleasure as well as for education. Mr. Damrosch’s musical lectures on\r\nthe Ring have elicited nearly one million letters, from all parts of the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\n1929 sees the capitulation of Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia\r\nOrchestra to the value of radio in a series of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nOn many programs are heard the world’s greatest artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n        Opera Makers of France, Germany and Italy—1741 to Wagner\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with all things that are over-popular and over-used, the opera in the\r\n18th century became trifling and empty, except for the work of some few\r\ngeniuses.\r\n\r\nThe music of the ancient Egyptians and Chinese advanced very little, on\r\naccount of fast and firm laws, and opera remained the same for a long\r\ntime, because of the strict rules. For there were laws governing the\r\nkind of arias, the number of men’s parts and women’s parts, when and\r\nwhere ballets and choruses should come in, the number of acts and many\r\nanother clogging rule. But, worst of all, the people in the audiences\r\nknew the rules so well that they made a fuss when any composer dared to\r\ndepart from them. Such was the case when Gluck came on the scene, and\r\nwhen he left it, with all the changes he made, other rules became just\r\nas binding!\r\n\r\nYou saw the effort of Gluck to reform opera in order to arrive at truth\r\nand sincerity; you saw how Mozart dignified the forms that were being\r\nused by enriching them, by his sparkling humor, by his new musical\r\ndevices and limitless outpourings of melody. Beethoven, too, made his\r\none masterpiece, _Fidelio_, stand for sincerity rather than triviality,\r\nand now von Weber we see adding to opera the story of peasant life in\r\nGermany, combined with mystery and beauty. Yet, with all these\r\nforerunners of a newer opera, many composers had to work very hard and\r\nmuch time had to pass by until we reach the great change under Wagner’s\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   VON WEBER WRITES FAIRY TALE OPERA\r\n\r\nBecause Carl Maria von Weber (1786–1826) had so great an influence on\r\nopera writers, we will start with him.\r\n\r\nWeber was the founder of romantic German opera,—the opera that dealt\r\nwith people and their feelings and the folk song of the German nation.\r\nHe was the first to combine the story of everyday life with the charm of\r\nimagination. Being of a long line of barons and also a great pianist, he\r\nraised the position of musicians to a high level in society, so that\r\nafter him, pianists and violinists were looked upon as artists and not\r\nas artisans.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to understand the life of his time, and suited his work to his\r\nsurroundings so beautifully, that it immediately led away from the\r\ntrivialities into which Italian opera had drifted, into something more\r\nworth while. He was a true romantic, as he put into his operas warmth of\r\nfeeling, elegance and delightful melody. He had a lovely sense of what\r\nwas dramatic or theatric, and he knew the orchestral instruments as well\r\nas he knew the piano, for which he wrote skilfully.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Eutin, near Lübeck, where Bach had lived, and showed\r\ngreat musical gifts when he was a little boy. And although he was\r\ndelicate, his father dearly wanted him to be a second Mozart. Michael\r\nHaydn, brother of Papa Haydn taught him and Weber showed great ability\r\nat the piano and could sit down and improvise and read music at sight.\r\n\r\nHe was taught by Abbé Vogler in Vienna, who first introduced him to folk\r\nmusic, which he used with such pleasing skill later. (By the way, Abbé\r\nVogler, a famous organist and teacher, was the Abt Vogler of Robert\r\nBrowning’s poem.) Weber became conductor of the orchestra at Breslau at\r\n18. But, being a delicate boy, he could not stand many of the things he\r\ndid and he broke down in health.\r\n\r\nLater he was unfortunate enough to become secretary to Duke Ludwig of\r\nWürttemberg at Stuttgart who was not a fit companion for a young man.\r\nWeber mixed in the gay life of the Duke and his friends, fell into bad\r\nhabits, and drifted into money difficulties. Strange to say, during this\r\ntime he read much and even wrote some music encouraged by Danzi, his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nHowever, he got into a scrape trying to help his father out of a\r\nfinancial difficulty, angered the King and was banished in 1810; and\r\nthough cleared of his guilt, he remained in exile for some time. Then\r\ndeciding to turn over a new leaf, with a mind teeming with ideas, he\r\nsettled down to work.\r\n\r\nHe soon became known for his compositions and was made Musical Director\r\nat the Prague Theatre, where he won popular favor by writing national\r\nsongs. He undertook to organize a Dresden troupe, after having done a\r\nsimilar work in Prague, but he was annoyed by bad health and the\r\njealousies of his rivals. Nevertheless, here he produced _Der\r\nFreischütz_, _Enchanted Huntsman_, which Berlin received in 1821 with\r\nwild enthusiasm, while _Euryanthe_, given almost at the same time, was\r\nnot, in Vienna, very successful.\r\n\r\nWeber’s operas, as the beginning of German romantic opera, are on the\r\ndirect road to Wagner’s. Wagner inherited from Gluck and Weber, and\r\nGluck inherited directly from the German _Singspiel_ (sing-play) of the\r\n18th century, which was a play composed of dances and songs not unlike\r\nthe English masque and the French ballet and vaudeville. It came before\r\nopera in Germany, yet made the basis for a German school, for it used\r\nGerman song and German subjects. Mozart, too, was one of Weber’s musical\r\nfathers, especially in his _Magic Flute_.\r\n\r\nWe see Weber, now, as we saw Mozart, combining the supernatural with\r\nnational or German melody, and using both imagination and realistic\r\neffects. His _Oberon_ is full of fairy atmosphere and _Der Freischütz_\r\nis often uncanny and awesome. He keeps the spoken dialogue of the old\r\n_Singspiel_ and in _Der Freischütz_ deals for the first time with\r\npeasant life. His orchestration is lovely and his skill with it was so\r\ngreat that he is still looked upon as one of the important men in the\r\ndevelopment of the orchestra. He paints the individual characters\r\nbeautifully by giving each one suitable music to sing.\r\n\r\nHe reached dramatic heights by his contrasts between mellow quietness\r\nand brilliant effects. He made use of all the resources on his\r\ninstruments, their defects as well as their good points. No one had ever\r\nbefore written more weird music than in the scene of the Wolf’s Glen, in\r\n_Der Freischütz_.\r\n\r\nHis piano music, including many fine sonatas, was rich with new and\r\nbrilliant effects and his _Concertstück_ (Concert-piece) was the father\r\nof the symphonic poems which were later written by Franz Liszt, Hector\r\nBerlioz, Tchaikovsky, and Richard Strauss. Thus did Weber give much to\r\nmusic’s growth.\r\n\r\nLouis Spohr (1784–1854) who was later a kind friend to Wagner, wrote ten\r\noperas which belong, too, in the Romantic School of Weber. He, however,\r\nwas best known for his violin concertos, written in the classic style of\r\nHaydn and Mozart. He wrote these because he lived in the time of the\r\ngreat piano and violin virtuosi (brilliant performers) in Vienna. His\r\nwork is tiresome to us because of his many mannerisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GRÉTRY AND OPÉRA COMIQUE\r\n\r\nNow we will go back a little and take up the French School with Grétry,\r\nthe first man of importance in France after Rameau, and the founder of\r\nthe comedy opera (_opéra comique_).\r\n\r\nAndré Ernest Modeste Grétry (1741–1813), was born in Liège. He excelled\r\nin the _opera buffa_ imported from Italy, which, due to the great sense\r\nof humor of the French, immediately became popular. In spite of their\r\nvulgarity there was much in these comedy operas that was delightful and\r\nthey were on subjects which interested the people. Grétry was very\r\nskilful and successful in this kind of opera of which he wrote fifty in\r\naddition to much church music, six symphonies and many instrumental\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nLater, _opéra comique_, a more refined form of this _opera buffa_, had a\r\nlong vogue in France. It became more serious, too, getting very close to\r\ngrand opera, except that it had spoken words. _Opéra comique_ always\r\nkept its naturalness, was simple, straightforward in story and informal\r\nin action. Another important difference from grand opera was that it\r\ncould be easily given in small theatres, for it needed no spectacular\r\nscenes. This of course made _opéra comique_ popular, for composers liked\r\nto write it, as they had a better chance to have their works performed\r\nthan if they had written grand opera with costly scenes. This form has\r\nbeen the inspiration of many of the French composers of the 19th and\r\n20th centuries.\r\n\r\n_Opéra comique_ is first found in Paris at the time of the War of the\r\nBuffoons in 1752 the year that Pergolesi’s little opera _La Serva\r\nPadrona_, took Paris by storm.\r\n\r\nNow, Paris had become the great meeting place for composers, and we find\r\nItalians and Germans going there to give operas, combining the ideas of\r\nRameau, Lully and Gluck, with their own national styles. They often\r\ndisplaced the French musicians and Paris was a center of jealousies and\r\nheart aches in the midst of its brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CHERUBINI—MUSICAL CZAR OF PARIS\r\n\r\nThe first of these foreigners to invade France was Luigi Cherubini\r\n(1760–1842), a Florentine, who became the musical czar of Paris. He was\r\neducated in Italy and in the beginning wrote Italian opera in the\r\npopular style. He went to London on invitation and was made composer to\r\nthe King. In 1788 we see him in Paris giving his opera _Demophon_. In\r\nthis, instead of being trivial in the waning Italian style, he became\r\n“grand” and pompous! Nearly every one that followed, copied him.\r\nBeethoven himself thought him to be the greatest living composer,\r\nbecause of his _Lodoiska_ (1791) and _The Water Carrier_.\r\n\r\nCherubini started as a composer of church music and wrote most of his\r\noperas from 1780 to 1800. He returned to church music later in life and\r\nwrote his great Credo for eight voices. He composed in all forms\r\nrequired of the Roman Catholic service and one of the noblest, sacred\r\nwritings is his Requiem in C.\r\n\r\nBut his opera writing influenced his church music and made him and many\r\nwho followed him, compose such spectacular church music that the solemn\r\npolyphony of the 17th century was well-nigh lost. About twenty years\r\nago, the Pope decided that this style of writing was not suitable for\r\nthe church and so ordained it, that only Gregorian Chant should be sung\r\nin the Roman Catholic Church. History repeats itself and Church music,\r\nas in the time of St. Gregory and of Palestrina, had to have another\r\n“house-cleaning.”\r\n\r\nCherubini’s orchestration was broad and fine and his overtures were\r\nclassic models. He seemed to have followed Mozart’s style rather than\r\nGluck’s and joined the classic style with the modern. He had vigor, and\r\nwas free from mannerisms, and was looked upon as a great man. As the\r\nhead of the Paris Conservatory he was able to befriend many a struggling\r\ncomposer. He died after a long useful life, at 82.\r\n\r\nHis _Medée_ and _The Water Carrier_ (_Les deux journées_) mark the\r\ngreatest accomplishment in his life—both are tragic yet are _opéra\r\ncomique_ because they contain spoken dialogue. Remember this instance of\r\ntragic _opéra comique_ and it will explain how it differs from what we\r\ncall comic opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FOLLOWERS OF GLUCK\r\n\r\nFollowing the time of Gluck in Paris there was a group of composers who\r\nwere so much influenced by him that they are looked upon as his\r\ndisciples. One of these was his own pupil, Antonio Salieri (1750–1825),\r\nwho in turn taught Beethoven, Schubert and others.\r\n\r\nOne of the links between the 18th and 19th centuries was Etienne\r\nNicholas Méhul (1763–1817), a Frenchman, who worked with Gluck. He dared\r\nto take his themes from life and wrote _opéra comique_ with a serious\r\naim. Even though he lived in the turbulence of the French Revolution, he\r\nwrote thirty operas, among which the greatest is _Joseph_. He was made\r\ninspector at the new Conservatory and also an Academician, and was one\r\nof the most loved composers of his day. He was often noble in musical\r\nexpression and handled his chorus and orchestra with skill. He wrote\r\nlittle of anything but opera, but pointed the way for others, especially\r\nin the use of local color and national feeling.\r\n\r\nThe next follower of Gluck, Gasparo Spontini (1774–1851), born in Italy,\r\nof peasant stock, was one of the first to write historic opera, which\r\nwas further developed by Meyerbeer and others. Technically, this is\r\nknown as French Grand Opera, which was being developed at the same time\r\nas _opéra comique_. It appealed to hearts and imagination, for the\r\npeople loved the great scenes and patriotism portrayed.\r\n\r\nSpontini first went to Paris in 1803 and the people did not like his\r\nwork. But he persisted, studied Gluck and Mozart as hard as he could,\r\nand produced _Milton_, which showed the public that his work had some\r\nbeauty. After this he wrote _La Vestale_, a noble work which swept him\r\ninto favor and he won a prize offered by Napoleon and judged by Méhul,\r\nGossec (a composer), and Grétry.\r\n\r\nWeber, however, while Spontini was absent came to Paris with _Der\r\nFreischütz_, and took his place in the hearts of the people. Cast down\r\nby losing his popularity, Spontini returned to Italy. His musical\r\nability was not equal to his great plots, yet, as the first writer of\r\nhistoric opera he deserves a place in the growing up of musical drama.\r\n\r\nGrétry made French _opéra comique_ out of _opéra bouffe_. Among the well\r\nknown writers of _opéra comique_ in France were François Adrienne\r\nBoieldieu, Daniel François Esprit Auber, Louis Joseph Ferdinand Hérold,\r\nJacques François Halévy.\r\n\r\nBoieldieu (1775–1834) was born in Rouen and became, in 1800, professor\r\nof piano at the Paris Conservatory. He wrote piano pieces and operas,\r\nand is best known for his _La Dame Blanche_ (“The White Lady”) which is\r\nstill heard in Paris. His operas combine sweet melody, amusing rhythm\r\nwith not a little dramatic style. He shows in his works a real\r\nunderstanding of how characters and action should be handled.\r\n\r\nAuber (1782–1871) called “The Prince of Opéra Comique,” was born in\r\nParis, and later he became the Director of the Conservatory and Imperial\r\nChapel Master to Napoleon III. His best known operas are _Fra Diavolo_,\r\n_The Black Domino_, _Masaniello_, or _La Muette de Portici_ (_The Dumb\r\nGirl of Portici_). He had great popularity during his day.\r\n\r\nHérold (1791–1833) was not as accomplished as either Auber or Boieldieu.\r\nHe was the son of a piano teacher and studied at the Conservatory under\r\nMéhul. In 1812 he won the _Prix de Rome_ (the prize given by the\r\nConservatory for composition, which permitted the student to go to Rome\r\nto perfect himself in his art, and to increase his culture, at the\r\nexpense of the Government.) His best operas are _Zampa_ and _Le Pré aux\r\nClercs_. He was particularly good in orchestration, and his works are\r\nstill heard.\r\n\r\nThe last one in this group is Jacques François Halévy (1799–1862), who\r\nis chiefly famous for _La Juive_ (_The Jewess_), a type of historic\r\nopera, even though he wrote many in the style of _opéra comique_. It is\r\nstill given today, and it was while singing in this opera, at the\r\nMetropolitan Opera House that Caruso was stricken with his fatal illness\r\nand Martinelli, a few years later was taken ill, and so it is looked\r\nupon with superstition by some of the singers.\r\n\r\n\r\n              MEYERBEER COMPOSES VERY GRAND “GRAND OPERA”\r\n\r\nNext, comes Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791–1864), and he followed the historic\r\nstyle that Spontini had begun. He, though a German, captured the French\r\naudiences and is famous chiefly for writing grand scenes, rather than\r\nfor noble music in grand opera. His name was Jacob Liebmann Beer, but he\r\nchanged it to Meyerbeer. He was the son of a Jewish banker and had no\r\nstruggle for money as did so many of the composers. He began as a\r\npianist and was also a pupil of Abbé Vogler. He was unsuccessful in\r\nGermany, so went to Italy. After an invitation to hear his opera _Il\r\nCrociato_ (_The Crusader_) performed in Paris, he took up his residence\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHis style was a queer mixture of German counterpoint, Italian melody and\r\nFrench rhythm, and after blotting up all the popular fashions of the\r\nday, he gave his _Robert le Diable_ (_Robert the Devil_), _The\r\nHuguenots_ and _Le Prophète_ (_The Prophet_) with different degrees of\r\nsuccess in Paris. Eugène Scribe was chief librettist in this period.\r\nLater Meyerbeer’s operas were given in Berlin, with Jenny Lind in the\r\ntitle rôles and he became very famous. _Dinorah_ and _L’Africaine_ (_The\r\nAfrican Maid_) were very popular and are still in the repertory of opera\r\ncompanies. But his style seems insincere and showy according to those\r\nwho expect more of opera than grand effects, glitter and elaborate\r\nscenery. _The Huguenots_ was probably his finest piece of work.\r\n\r\nAmong other composers in Germany whose names you may come upon in other\r\nplaces are: Heinrich Marschner (1795–1861), Conradin Kreutzer, Lortzing\r\n(1801–1851), von Flotow (1812–1883), composer of _Stradella_ and\r\n_Martha_, and Otto Nicolai (1810–1849) who wrote the delightful bit of\r\nfluff, _The Merry Wives of Windsor_.\r\n\r\nLater we see the old _Singspiel_ take the form of Comic Opera (not\r\n_opéra comique_) with such Germans as Carl Millocker and von Suppé and\r\nVictor Nessler in his _Trumpeter of Sakkingen_ and _The Pied Piper of\r\nHamelin_, and Johann Strauss, the great Viennese Waltz King, whose “Blue\r\nDanube” and other waltzes are so familiar. (Vienna was as famous for the\r\nwaltz as America is for jazz.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                     OFFENBACH’S TALES OF HOFFMANN\r\n\r\nAnother German who went to Paris was Jacques Offenbach (1819–1880) from\r\nCologne, who became more of a Parisian than the Parisians. He was quite\r\na fop and Wagner once called him “the musical Clown” for he was often\r\nseen wearing a yellow waist-coat and trousers, sky blue coat, grey\r\ngloves, a green hat and he carried a red sun shade. How like an electric\r\nsign he must have looked! But withal, he was so popular in Vienna that\r\nwhen Wagner approached the Opera House about his _Meistersinger_ he was\r\ntold that they were too busy producing Offenbach’s operas to consider\r\nhis. He was the best box-office attraction of his time, and the managers\r\ncould not get enough of his works. Offenbach was important because he\r\nfounded a new kind of light opera, or the operetta, which is light in\r\nstory, charming and winsome. His chief operas are _The Grand Duchess of\r\nGerolstein_, _La Belle Hélène_ and his masterpiece _The Tales of\r\nHoffmann_ of which you probably know the often-played Barcarolle. He\r\nfelt that it was his finest work and was very eager to be present at its\r\nfirst performance at the Opéra Comique in Paris, but before he had\r\nfinished orchestrating it, he died. When it was given, the following\r\nyear, it was praised as the work of a genius.\r\n\r\nHis followers were Planquette, with _Chimes of Normandy_, Lecocq and his\r\n_La Fille de Mme. Angot_, and _Giroflé-Girofla_, and Franz von Suppé\r\nwith _Fatinitza_, _Boccaccio_ and the _Poet and Peasant_ overture,\r\nplayed at all movie-houses!\r\n\r\nIn Vienna Johann Strauss with his waltzes, and the most perfect comic\r\nopera of its kind, _Die Fledermaus_ (_The Bat_) still sparkling and\r\ndelightful, _Zigeuner-Baron_ (_Gypsy-Baron_), all owe their start in\r\nlife to Offenbach’s genius. We too, in America, have had the gifted\r\nVictor Herbert with his _Mlle. Modiste_, _The Serenade_, _The Red Mill_\r\nand many other lovely operettas and Reginald De Koven with _Robin Hood_.\r\nThe inimitable pair in England, Sir Arthur Sullivan and his librettist\r\nW. S. Gilbert, wrote comic operas that have become classics. (See page\r\n341.)\r\n\r\nSo, the foppish Offenbach sowed fruitful seed, and the crop that\r\nfollowed him have given high pleasure and delightful times to many, and\r\nprobably will, for years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n              AN ITALIAN TRIO—ROSSINI, BELLINI, DONIZETTI\r\n\r\nWe have dipped into Germany and France so now we must see what was going\r\non in Italy.\r\n\r\nFew Italians realized that great musical advances were being made in\r\nother countries and kept on doing the same old things. But one or two\r\nbecame famous because they left Italy to mingle with the other composers\r\nand audiences of Europe.\r\n\r\nAmong the best known of these was Giacchino Rossini (1792–1868), who\r\nbecame director of the _Theatre Italien_, in Paris, after visits to\r\nVienna and London. His masterpiece was _William Tell_, based on the\r\nSchiller poem dealing with the hero of Swiss history. Among other\r\nthings, and very delightful, was his _Barber of Seville_, which was\r\nmodelled after the _Marriage of Figaro_, the conversational opera\r\ninvented by Mozart, whose influence can also be seen in his\r\n_Semiramide_.\r\n\r\nRossini’s church music, such as the well known _Stabat Mater_ is also\r\nflorid but full of beautiful living melody. This and the _Solemn Mass_\r\nare often given today. He was a brilliant composer, an innovator and did\r\nmuch to abolish the foolish cadenza in opera. His work is very ornate\r\nbut shows skill in concerted pieces,—choruses and the endings or finales\r\nof the acts.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known followers of Rossini in Italy was Gaetano\r\nDonizetti (1797–1848) with his _Daughter of the Regiment_, _Lucrezia\r\nBorgia_ and _Lucia di Lammermoor_ from Sir Walter Scott’s story, _The\r\nBride of Lammermoor_. He wrote showy brilliant things like the sextet\r\nand the mad scene from _Lucia_ and by his very skill in these musical\r\nfireworks, kept back opera founded on truth and sincerity.\r\n\r\nVincenzo Bellini (1801–1835), unlike Donizetti, wrote only in the grand\r\nstyle and not in the _comique_. His best known works are _Norma_, _I\r\nPuritani_ (_The Puritan_) and _La Sonnambula_ (_The Sleep Walker_).\r\nThough he was a better writer than Donizetti, Bellini is heard far less\r\noften today. He also used too many frilly, frothy effects and held back\r\nthe advance of opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      OPERA SINGERS OF THE PERIOD\r\n\r\nAs there cannot be successful opera without opera singers, here are the\r\nnames of a few who have gone down to history: Angelica Catalani,\r\nGiudittza Pasta, Henriette Sontag, Wilhelmine Schroeder-Devrient, Maria\r\nGarcia Malibran, Pauline Viardot Garcia, Henriette Nissen, Giulia Grisi,\r\nJenny Lind, Caroline Carvalho, Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa, Zelia Trebelli,\r\nPauline Lucca, and Adelina Patti, and Manuel Garcia, John Braham,\r\nDomenico Ronconi, Nicholas Levasseur, Joseph Tichatschek, Guiseppe\r\nMario, Enrico Tamberlick, Theodor Wachtel, Charles Santley and John Sims\r\nReeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ENGLISH OPERA-BALLAD\r\n                              18TH CENTURY\r\n\r\nFifteen years after the period in which Purcell glorified English music,\r\nHandel went to England and gathered about him composers who wrote along\r\nthe lines which he popularized. In addition to this, ballad-operas, part\r\nsongs, “catches” (separate songs or ballads) were very popular. In\r\nLondon, there were comic plays made of strings of songs such as Gay’s\r\n_Beggar’s Opera_ which were sisters to _opera buffa_ in Italy, _opéra\r\nbouffe_ in France, and the _Singspiel_ in Germany.\r\n\r\nForty-five of these ballad-operas were produced in 15 years. The\r\narrangers of these amusing song-plays included the names of Dr. Pepusch,\r\na German who lived in London; Henry Carey (1692–1743), famous as the\r\ncomposer of _Sally in our Alley_, _God Save the King_ (our _America_);\r\nand Thomas Arne (1710–1778) who wrote many masques, numerous\r\nballad-operas, and set many of the Shakespeare lyrics and wrote many\r\nglees and ballads. Some of these part songs were very beautiful and\r\nsomewhat like the madrigals of earlier days.\r\n\r\nMany of the church composers in their lighter moods wrote some of these\r\nballad-operas, among them: Samuel Arnold, with his _Maid of the Mill_, a\r\n_pasticcio_, “Notable,” says Waldo Selden Pratt, “as the first native\r\nmusic drama, since Purcell”; William Jackson; Thomas Atwood and Charles\r\nDibden who was so successful with his _Shepherd’s Artifice_ that he\r\nwrote seventy others, and thirty musical monologues, among which were\r\n_Sea Songs_. Some other well known men were Michael Arne, son of Dr.\r\nThomas Arne with his _Fairy Tale_, _Almena_ and _Cymon_ from Garrick’s\r\nplay of the same name; James Hook with some two thousand songs and\r\ntwenty-five plays; William Shield, the viola player and song writer;\r\nStephen Storace, clever violinist and the author of _The Haunted Tower_\r\nand _Pirates_, and his sister Ann Storace, a singer. At this time there\r\nwere two clubs, one called the “Catch Club” and another the “Glee Club,”\r\nand one also called “Madrigal Society,” and before 1800 we have a list\r\nof glee writers including the two Samuel Webbs, Sr. and Jr., Benjamin\r\nCook and his son Robert, John Wall Callcott, a pupil of Haydn, who won\r\nmany medals from the “Catch Club.”\r\n\r\nFrom now on, England was influenced by foreign composers, especially\r\nMendelssohn, Weber and Gounod, and made ballad operas and operettas\r\nfreely adapted from continental works, besides glees and songs and music\r\nfor the Church of England services. The interest in music was great and\r\nsome of the church music and glees at the time were excellent. In this\r\nperiod, the Birmingham Festivals were started, Horsley founded the\r\n_Concentores Sodales_ (1748–1847), a group formed along the lines of the\r\nearlier Catch and Glee Clubs. The Philharmonic Society also was formed\r\n(1813) and among its great leaders were Cherubini in 1815, Spohr 1820\r\nand 1843 and Weber 1826 and Mendelssohn many times after 1829. Through\r\nthe effort of the Earl of Westmoreland, the Royal Academy of Music was\r\norganized in 1822. Among the composers of this period were Samuel Wesley\r\n(1776–1837). He was a Bach enthusiast and wrote much church music and\r\nother classic forms; William Crotch (1775–1847), George Stark, an\r\nintimate of Weber and Mendelssohn, who edited _Gibbon’s Madrigals_;\r\nWilliam Horsley, who edited _Callcott’s Glees_ and wrote glees himself,\r\nsymphonies and songs and handbooks. There were many others in this\r\nperiod but too numerous to mention here.\r\n\r\nIn the next period England’s composers free themselves from the\r\nMendelssohn School and begin to branch out. Do not think that\r\nMendelssohn was not good for them. He gave much that England needed, and\r\nalso brought English composers in contact with European music. But they\r\nliked church music and the ballad opera and the charming part songs,\r\nrather than the heavier operas of Europe. Among writers of cathedral\r\nmusic, are Sir George A. MacFarren, John Bacchus Dykes, whose name\r\nappears in our hymn books, Joseph Barnby, Samuel Wesley mentioned above,\r\nand Henry Smart. In 1816, Sir William Sterndale Bennett was born, he was\r\na choir boy and entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1835. The House of\r\nBroadwood (English piano makers) sent him to Leipsic to study and he\r\ncame under the influence of Mendelssohn and Schumann. He was the\r\ndirector of the Royal Academy of Music, a fine pianist and wrote many\r\ncompositions, among which his Cantata _A Woman of Samaria_ is not as dry\r\nas the usual sacred works of this period.\r\n\r\nAnother great writer of this time was Sir John Stainer (1840–1901). Some\r\nof his things are given today in our churches and are very beautiful and\r\nimpressive. He is the author of valuable text-books.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LIGHT OPERA\r\n\r\nAt this time, some writers of a sort of belated ballad opera appeared in\r\nthe persons of:\r\n\r\nMichael William Balfe who wrote thirty operas among which is _The\r\nBohemian Girl_, still played and greatly admired; William Vincent\r\nWallace, like Balfe an Irishman, who is famous for his _Maritana_; and\r\nthen of course, Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842–1900), who probably\r\nneeds very little introduction to any American or any Englishman for he\r\nwrote _The Mikado_, _Pirates of Penzance_, _Iolanthe_, the only fairy\r\nopera without a mortal in it, _Pinafore_, _Patience_, _Princess Ida_,\r\n_Trial by Jury_, _Ruddigore_ and many others, including the first light\r\nopera, _Cox and Box_, which was the first time that he and W. S.\r\nGilbert, as librettist, worked together. W. S. Gilbert was the author of\r\nthe inimitable and amusing _Bab Ballads_. If you haven’t read them you\r\nhave a treat in store for you! They wrote together in a fresh,\r\nmock-heroic, humorous vein, and it seems as if they were made for each\r\nother, so delightfully did they play into each other’s hands.\r\n\r\nSullivan was the son of a clarinet player and teacher. He also began, as\r\ndid so many British Islanders, as a choir boy and entered the Royal\r\nAcademy of Music on a Mendelssohn Scholarship. Later he went to the\r\nLeipsic Conservatory and wrote some music to Shakespeare’s _Tempest_,\r\nwhich established his fame in England. Besides his operas he wrote much\r\nincidental music, some anthems and cantatas, among these _The Golden\r\nLegend_ and _The Prodigal Son_ are the best. He wanted very much to\r\nwrite grand opera, but he never seemed to work well in this vein and his\r\n_Ivanhoe_ did him little good.\r\n\r\nAnd so, we leave opera until the wand of the Wizard Wagner changes the\r\nwhole path of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n                 The Poet Music Writers—Romantic School\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SCHUBERT—MENDELSSOHN—SCHUMANN—CHOPIN\r\n\r\nYou have seen how Romantic Music began, and why Beethoven is often the\r\nfirst name mentioned when Romanticism is talked about, for he was the\r\ncolossal guidepost pointing the way.\r\n\r\nHe was as far from the classical forms of Bach, as from later writers\r\nwho have “jumped over the musical traces” altogether. All were, and\r\nstill are, trying to free themselves from conventions, and to express\r\ntheir feelings satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to begin the Romantic school with Schubert, the first\r\nfigure of great importance. But there was one John Field (1782–1837)\r\nfrom totally different surroundings who is still remembered for his fine\r\npiano nocturnes.\r\n\r\nImpressed with the quiet and solemnity of the night, he knew how to put\r\nit into beautiful melody. He was born in a little out-of-the-way street\r\nin Dublin, not far from St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and near the birthplace\r\nof that romantic poet, Tom Moore. His father and his grandfather, both\r\nmusicians, forced the infant prodigy, and at ten, he played, publicly, a\r\nconcerto composed by his father.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, the boy was apprenticed, or “hired out,” as pupil and\r\nsalesman to Clementi, the composer and piano manufacturer in London. He\r\nshowed off the pianos so well to the customers, that Clementi soon\r\nrealized he had made a good bargain. The boy played in London as the\r\n“ten-year-old pupil of Clementi,” on whom he no doubt tried out his\r\n_Gradus ad Parnassum_. (Page 320.)\r\n\r\nFive years later he played his own “Concerto for the grand _fortepiano_,\r\ncomposed for the occasion.” Clementi was shrewd, and started a branch of\r\nhis piano business in St. Petersburg, taking Field with him.\r\n\r\nOne of the ear-marks of Romantic music is the title of the piano piece\r\nor song. Until the romantic period music was designated usually by the\r\nnumber of the work or by its form such as _gavotte_, _minuet_, _rondo_,\r\n_sonata_, etc., but the Romantics wrote what they felt, and with the\r\nexception of Chopin, gave descriptive names to their pieces. In 1817\r\nJohn Field wrote a concerto named _L’incendie par l’orage_ (_The Fire\r\nfrom the Storm_), a musical picture.\r\n\r\nHis influence was more important than his music. We see his hand in the\r\nplaying and composing of the poet-pianist, Frederick Chopin.\r\n\r\nAlthough Weber appeared in a different musical field he, too, had a\r\nstrong influence. He was four years younger than Field but had greater\r\nopportunities and was one of the first of the Romantic School.\r\n\r\nCharles Mayer (1799–1862) was a direct follower and pupil of Field. His\r\n_études_ (studies) ranked with those of Henselt, who wrote the\r\ndelightful _If I Were a Bird_, and he had an influence upon Chopin, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SCHUBERT—MAKER OF SONGS\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to Franz Peter Schubert (1797–1828), born in Vienna of a\r\nschoolmaster father, and a mother, who, like Beethoven’s, was a cook.\r\n\r\nThe musical comedy, _Blossom Time_, was built upon some of Schubert’s\r\nmost beautiful melodies and episodes from his life. We must never trust\r\ntoo far stories told this way, which often contain unreliable details,\r\nhowever this charming operetta gives an interesting glimpse of\r\nSchubert’s devotion to composition. It is true that he wrote wherever he\r\nwas, covering his cuffs as well as the menus and programs in the taverns\r\nwith the endless flow of themes which eventually became world-famous\r\nsongs. Schubert was not a mere writer of songs; he created the form\r\nknown as _Lieder_ and through all his works, torrents of melody seemed\r\nto spring from him eternally.\r\n\r\nHe was the thirteenth of nineteen children, five of which were of a\r\nsecond marriage, and there was no wealth or luxury for Franz, so his\r\nfather worked hard to pay for his music lessons.\r\n\r\nHis teacher said that no matter what he tried to teach him in violin,\r\npiano, singing, the organ or thorough-bass, Franz knew it already, for\r\nhe learned everything almost at a glance.\r\n\r\nHe was first soprano in the church choir of Lichtenthal and the beauty\r\nof his voice attracted much attention. He also played the violin in the\r\nservices, and stole little stray minutes to write songs or pieces for\r\nstrings and piano.\r\n\r\nWhen he was sent to the school for Imperial choristers the boys laughed\r\nat his coarse, grey clothing, the big “Harold Lloyd spectacles,” and his\r\nretiring, bashful manners. They soon changed when they discovered the\r\nastonishing things he could do. His home-spun clothes were exchanged for\r\nthe uniform trimmed with gold lace worn by the Imperial choristers, who\r\nformed an orchestra to practise daily music by Haydn, Mozart, Cherubini\r\nand Beethoven. Among them was Spaun and when he won his confidence,\r\nFranz told him that he had written many pieces and he would write more,\r\nbut could not afford to buy the music paper. His new friend made it\r\npossible for Schubert to have paper and many other luxuries, in which\r\nSpaun did something to benefit the world,—a little kindness which\r\nbrought great results.\r\n\r\nThe extreme ease with which Schubert absorbed all learning made him\r\nneglect the study of counterpoint, because after all he could not give\r\nall his time to music, for he was a schoolteacher and had to work hard\r\nto get along. His heart was not in his work, for while hearing the\r\npupils recite he wrote themes on every scrap of paper he could find.\r\n\r\nHe wrote with lightning rapidity. The early songs met with immediate\r\nfavor which encouraged him to write music in larger form. He was of the\r\npeople and wrote from the heart, and to the heart. He hoped for the same\r\nsuccess with his symphonies and chamber music, but the symphonies never\r\nreached the perfection of his songs, and his disappointment was keen\r\nwhen the critics did not rate them as highly.\r\n\r\nHowever, the steady flow of melody, the torrent of themes, never ended\r\nand his chamber music is like a song with lovely play of instruments.\r\nWho can forget the haunting beauty of the _Unfinished Symphony_? This\r\nwas left unfinished, indeed, not by Schubert’s death as many suppose,\r\nbut the composer felt that he had arrived at a summit of beauty in the\r\nsecond movement, and he dared not add a third, lest he could not again\r\nreach the heights.\r\n\r\nHis tenth and last symphony in C major takes an hour to perform and is\r\nheard frequently. Robert Schumann wrote that it was of “Heavenly\r\nlength.”\r\n\r\nSchubert lived when the romantic poets gave him wonderful verse for his\r\ntexts. He loved the literature of Goethe and Heinrich Heine, both of\r\nwhom knew the hearts of the simple people.\r\n\r\nThe world will never forget the wonderful heritage left by this genius\r\nwho died at thirty-two leaving vast quantities of great works. Besides\r\ncreating new forms in song he also gave the pianists pieces that were\r\nnew and important. He left no concertos, nor did he write for solo\r\nviolin, but his piano sonatas and chamber music are of value. _Der\r\nErl-Koenig_ (_The Erl King_), _Der Doppelganger_ (_The Shadow_), and\r\n_Death and the Maiden_, all sounded the last note in tragedy, and he\r\nalso wrote many lovely songs in lighter mood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE WELL FAVORED MENDELSSOHN\r\n\r\nMost masters who have left the world richer for having lived, were born\r\nin poverty and knew the sorrows of privation, not so with Felix\r\nMendelssohn-Bartholdy (1809–1847), loved by the many who have played his\r\n_Songs Without Words_, or who have heard Elman’s fingers fly over his\r\nviolin in the concerto, said to be the best writing ever done for that\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nPopular as are many works from the polished and fluent pen of\r\nMendelssohn, the oratorios _Elijah_ and _Saint Paul_ are noble for these\r\ncontain some of the most dramatic and inspired writing. In that work\r\nwhich is typical of Mendelssohn and his personality, he showed more\r\ncharacteristics of the older classical school than of the romantic. If\r\nhe had lived during the classical period he would have been a greater\r\ncomposer, for he was romantic by influence and classic in taste.\r\n\r\nHas not the _Spring Song_ the shimmer of spring and the _Spinning Song_\r\nthe whir of the wheels? One can easily imagine the kindly touch of a\r\nloving hand in _Consolation_, while the _Hunting Song_ is alive and\r\ngoing. This is the romantic music that became the model for thousands of\r\nsmall pieces.\r\n\r\nIt in said frequently that if Mendelssohn had been less conventional,\r\nhis work would have been more forceful, because he had much that was\r\ntruly fine.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn lived among the most brilliant literary lights of his day.\r\nHis refinement was reflected in his music. He was petted by an adoring\r\nfather, mother and sisters, who gave him every opportunity to study and\r\ncompose, and he was much sought after socially. He devoted much time to\r\nthe study of languages, sketching in water colors and traveling in Italy\r\nand Switzerland. His sister Fanny, whose musical education was of the\r\nutmost assistance to her brother whom she idolized, would have been\r\nfamous but for her father’s prejudice against women in professional\r\nlife. She was a gifted composer and it is claimed that she wrote many of\r\nher brother’s songs and some of the _Songs Without Words_.\r\n\r\nHer death was a mortal blow from which Mendelssohn never recovered.\r\nExtremely sensitive, his affection for his family was most intense and\r\nfilled his life.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather was the eminent philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, who being\r\na Hebrew, was open to the sorrows caused by prejudice. He was such a\r\ngreat man, however, that he succeeded in breaking down barriers not only\r\nfor himself, but for his race.\r\n\r\nAbraham Mendelssohn was pleased to call himself, “First the son of the\r\nfamous Moses Mendelssohn, then the father of the eminent Felix\r\nMendelssohn.” His banking house in Berlin is still in the family.\r\n\r\nThe most noted musicians and artists were entertained in the Mendelssohn\r\nhome, and heard the compositions of the gifted young man. In 1821 the\r\nboy was taken to Goethe’s home where he played and improvised for the\r\npoet. He was delighted with him for his musical talent, and because he\r\nhad inherited the gift of conversation and letters from his grandfather,\r\nof whom Goethe was very fond. Young Mendelssohn never shocked the great\r\nold poet as did Beethoven, for his manner was always correct.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Mendelssohn went to Paris to Cherubini who was asked whether his\r\ntalent justified cultivation beyond the average stage. The master was\r\nvery enthusiastic, but his father would not leave him in Paris, even in\r\ncharge of the noted teacher. Returning to Berlin he wrote the overture\r\nto _Midsummer Night’s Dream_ (1826). It reflects the dancing elves and\r\nthe humor of Shakespeare, while the orchestra has a delicate touch,\r\nsimilar to that shown by Berlioz at the same period. Mendelssohn was\r\nonly seventeen when he wrote it, with all its finish and its flawless\r\nmusical treatment. Much that he did at that period shows his natural\r\nflow of genius. Music seemed to gush from his soul like pure, fresh\r\nwater from a spring, making one think of cool fountains, sparkling with\r\nmelody and clarity. These qualities are also in the _Fingal’s Cave_ or\r\n_Hebrides_ overture, and he takes you on his delightful trips in _Calm\r\nSea and Prosperous Voyage_. The way these numbers reflect his\r\nimpressions and the way he transmitted them to others is typical of the\r\nRomantic School. The purity of his musical form related him to the\r\nclassical and gave inklings of the Symphonic Tone Poem.\r\n\r\nIn his symphonies Mendelssohn also told tales of his travels, as in the\r\n_Italian Symphony_, and in his _Scotch Symphony_ in which he made use of\r\nScotch folk tunes. He also wrote much chamber music. He left some piano\r\nconcertos which may not attract the professionals of today but are the\r\njoy of many piano students who play them arranged for two pianos.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn tried operas but like many others failed to find a good\r\nlibretto. This was the trouble with one he produced in Berlin. Added to\r\nthis there were many intrigues and jealousies at the opera house which\r\nturned him bitterly against that city.\r\n\r\nHowever, he accomplished one of the greatest things ever done for music.\r\nThe works of Bach and Handel had been so neglected that they were almost\r\nforgotten. He knew them well, and wanting others to love them as he did,\r\nhe assembled a great chorus and gave Bach’s _Passion according to Saint\r\nMatthew_. This was the first performance since Bach’s death, and it\r\nbrought these works back to us. Imagine Mendelssohn’s popularity and\r\ntalent as a conductor to have been able to do this at the age of twenty!\r\nThen he traveled again, and after roaming through Italy, Switzerland and\r\nFrance, he went to London where he created a stir as pianist, composer\r\nand conductor. Besides his splendid education he had a winsome and\r\nattractive personality, and his success was very great. He made, in all,\r\nnine visits to England.\r\n\r\nHaving been brought up in the Christian faith, he married the daughter\r\nof a French Protestant minister and had five children. They went to live\r\nin Germany and becoming conductor of the Leipsic Gewandhaus orchestra,\r\nhe made the city the musical center of Germany. He founded the Leipsic\r\nConservatory of Music (1843), where he gave his old teacher Moscheles an\r\nimportant post. This conservatory is well known here for many American\r\nmusicians of the last generation were educated there.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn conducted many festivals and he always aroused new interest\r\nin Bach, whom he presented at every opportunity.\r\n\r\nHis _Saint Paul_ had success in Duesseldorf (1837), and during his last\r\nvisit to England (1846), he gave at the Birmingham festival _Elijah_,\r\nsecond today in popularity only to Handel’s _Messiah_.\r\n\r\nWhen Mendelssohn returned to Leipsic, he showed traces of overwork and\r\nthe death of his sister coming at the same time, made him unable to\r\nresist the strain. He died November 4, 1847, when only 38. His happy\r\nlife shines through his music so full of beauty and sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SCHUMANN—THE SUPREME POET\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann (1810–1856), a tower of beauty, strength, imagination\r\nand dramatic fervor even judged by 20th century standards, still thrills\r\nus as we recognize his genius. What a price he paid for his life filled\r\nwith joys and griefs!\r\n\r\nWe are grateful for the solidity of his building, his breadth of vision,\r\nthe wonders of his imagination, the beauty of his poetic fancy, and\r\nabove all, the vastness of his musical knowledge. A peak among the\r\ncomposers of the Romantic School, he has scaled the heights of dramatic\r\nfervor as he has touched the sun-flecked valleys. To him we owe the\r\nnaming of pieces, and the feeling of emotion which the composer felt\r\nwhen he named them,—_The Happy Farmer_, _The Prophet Bird_, _The\r\nRocking-Horse_, _End of the Song_, _The Child Falls Asleep_, etc.\r\n\r\nAll who have been milestones in music have been well educated, yet how\r\nunjustly people say musicians know nothing but music. Many have not had\r\nonly culture from their studies, but also have come from refined homes.\r\nSo Schumann, born at Zwickau, Saxony, had an educated father, a\r\nbook-seller. His mother wanted Robert to be a lawyer, and did not wish\r\nhis musical talent to interfere. He began to compose and study music at\r\nseven, but he studied law, literature and philosophy, later, at the\r\nUniversity of Leipsic.\r\n\r\nAfter a year he went to the famous University of Heidelberg (1829),\r\nwhich has always been proud that the great composer was one of its\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nSchumann returned to Leipsic on account of the musical life. With his\r\nreturn began the romance of his life, one of the most beautiful love\r\nstories in musical history. He studied with Frederick Wieck, whose\r\nlittle daughter Clara was a prodigy pianist. He became a member of the\r\nhousehold and was charmed by the talent of the child. Meanwhile he was\r\nstudying as pianist, and being ingenious, he invented an instrument to\r\ndevelop his weak fourth finger, but it ruined his hand and unfitted him\r\nfor his career.\r\n\r\nNow he gave more attention to composition and to musical criticism. This\r\ngave him the chance to help some of the brilliant musicians of the day.\r\nHe brought Chopin to the notice of Germany, and proclaimed the genius of\r\nyoung Johannes Brahms. He also formed a deep friendship for Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nValuable as are all writings which reveal his thoughts, his richest gift\r\nto the world was his music, in which he preached the gospel of beauty.\r\n\r\nAs Schumann grew into manhood he began to know the depths of sorrow,\r\nsome of his finest works having been an outburst of his tortured soul.\r\nClara Wieck was now a young woman and a great pianist. It was natural\r\nthat an affection should spring up between them. But Clara’s father had\r\ngreater hopes. He could not see a struggling young musician and critic\r\nas the husband of his talented child. During this long and painful\r\ncourtship when Schumann dared not speak his love to Clara he wrote\r\ncompositions with which to tell his story, and she understood. One of\r\nthese expressions was the lovely _Warum_ asking the question, “Why?” so\r\nlongingly.\r\n\r\nIn those days a case could be brought into court and the reason demanded\r\nwhy a parent should refuse to allow a marriage. Schumann went to law,\r\nand the court decided that Wieck’s objections were without cause. But\r\nthe year of strain told upon his health and nerves and he began his\r\nmarried life under a cloud of illness. The young pair were ideally\r\nhappy, he wrote glorious music, and she took pride in playing his piano\r\nworks on all her programs.\r\n\r\nWith all her accomplishments—and she was a great artist—she was first a\r\ndevoted wife who cared for her husband as though he had been her child.\r\nSchumann’s very finest work was done during these years. His inspiration\r\ndrove him chiefly to songs, full of lyric beauty like Schubert’s;\r\nindeed, when speaking of _lieder_ the names of Schubert and Schumann are\r\nalways linked.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn urged Schumann to teach in the Leipsic Conservatory, but he\r\nleft there soon to make a tour of Russia with his wife. That year they\r\nsettled in Dresden, a quieter city, because his nerves were beginning to\r\nforecast the shadow of his future.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn loved Schumann and admired him as composer, writer and\r\ncritic. He conducted the first performance of Schumann’s B flat symphony\r\nat a Gewandhaus concert of Clara Schumann, and the happiness of the\r\nthree was tremendous. Schumann did not think of himself alone, but was\r\nalways trying to help his colleagues. Schubert wrote his C major\r\nsymphony in March of the year he died and never heard it, but Schumann\r\nhad the score sent to Mendelssohn in Leipsic for its first performance\r\nafter a wait of eleven years.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his nerves, Schumann was now in his full power and the\r\namount he wrote is incredible. Most of his chamber music was written in\r\n1842, three of the string quartets being dedicated to Mendelssohn. The\r\nwork that gave him fame all over Europe was the quintet for piano and\r\nstrings, opus 44; with Clara at the piano, Berlioz heard its first\r\nperformance and spread the news of his genius through Paris. About this\r\ntime the _Variations for Two Pianos_ were written and played by Robert\r\nand Clara Schumann.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting and popular number is _Carnaval_, a collection of\r\nnamed sketches in three-four time each one portraying some person or\r\nthing. _Eusebius_ and _Florestan_ have caused much curiosity—the secret\r\nis that Schumann was a student of himself and these were meant to show\r\nhis conflicting moods. Chopin is represented, also Mendelssohn, while\r\n_Chiarina_ is Clara.\r\n\r\nA strange thing happened to Schumann in Vienna. He was visiting the\r\ngraves of Beethoven and Schubert which are not far apart, and he found a\r\nsteel pen on Beethoven’s tomb. He took this for an omen, but used it\r\nonly for his most precious works. He wrote the B flat symphony with it\r\nand the magic seemed to work!\r\n\r\nSchubert is universally praised for the beauty of his themes, but who\r\ncould surpass the loveliness of Schumann’s melodies? The contrasts\r\nbetween the exquisite little tone-pictures of _Kinderscenen_ and the\r\ngrandeur of the sonatas and the _Fantasia_ mark the breadth of his\r\ngenius, while the amount he accomplished in his short span of life was\r\nmarvelous.\r\n\r\nHe was but twenty-five when he first showed mental trouble, and at\r\nforty-four his case was hopeless. He tried to end his life by jumping\r\ninto the Rhine and was taken to an asylum near Beethoven’s birthplace,\r\nBonn, where he died two years later, survived by his wife and two\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nWhat a price he paid for his life filled with joys and griefs!\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHOPIN—“PROUDEST POET-SOUL”\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann wrote that Chopin was “the boldest, proudest poet-soul\r\nof his time.” Such a tribute from him meant more than all the praise we\r\ncan give him now; it shows that he had admiration and respect from his\r\nrivals as he had idolatry from the literary, artistic and refined\r\ncircles of Paris.\r\n\r\nFrederic Chopin (1809–1849) was born in Poland of a French father and a\r\nPolish mother. The difference one finds in the date of his birth,\r\nFebruary 22 or March 1, is owing to the difference between the Russian\r\nand Polish calendars, and those of other countries.\r\n\r\nLike Mozart he showed talent very early and at nine played his first\r\npublic concert. His mother, unable to be present, asked him what the\r\naudience liked best. “My collar, Mamma!” he answered, proud of the\r\nlittle lace collar on the black velvet jacket! He was elegant then, and\r\nalways kept his air of distinction, and a love for beauty.\r\n\r\nShortly after beginning music study, Chopin tried to compose, and felt\r\nsuch authority that he undertook to change certain things written by his\r\nteacher. His earliest work was a march dedicated to the Grand Duke\r\nConstantin, which was arranged for brass-band and printed without the\r\ncomposer’s name.\r\n\r\nFrom his two teachers in Poland, both ardent patriots, Chopin must have\r\nabsorbed much of the national feeling so strongly marked in his works.\r\nAs it was a day of flashy _salon_ (Page 322) playing, his teacher,\r\nJoseph Elsner, felt that Chopin was the founder of a new school in which\r\npoetic feeling was leading music out of the prevailing empty acrobatic\r\nfinger feats!\r\n\r\nThe world owes much to that wise teacher who instilled a love of Bach\r\ninto his young pupil. He answered some one who blamed him for allowing\r\nChopin too much freedom: “Leave him alone! he treads an extraordinary\r\npath because he has extraordinary gifts and follows no method, but\r\ncreates one. I have never seen such a gift for composition.” Later he\r\nmarked his examination papers: “Chopin, Frederic (pupil for three\r\nyears), astounding capacity, musical genius.”\r\n\r\nAt fifteen Chopin was adored by his companions and always held the\r\naffection of those who knew him. He seems to have been the original\r\n“matinee idol” of Paris, whenever he played, for he was the most poetic\r\nand finest pianist ever heard.\r\n\r\nThough Chopin was seemingly French in manner, habits and tastes, he was\r\nextraordinarily patriotic and his music is perhaps the finest expression\r\nof Poland the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nNo one has surpassed, or even equalled Chopin in writing for the piano.\r\nHe understood its possibilities, limitations, tonal qualities and power\r\nto express emotion.\r\n\r\nHe did not leave a great quantity of compositions, but a well-ordered\r\ncollection of music, so individual that even today, with all his\r\nimitators, when we hear Chopin—(and where is there a piano recital\r\nwithout at least one number?)—we instantly recognize it as his.\r\n\r\nStrongly marked rhythms are among his most fascinating characteristics.\r\nHe glorified and elaborated the dances of Poland, as had others in the\r\npast, who made art pieces of the gavotte, minuet, bourrée, gigue, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat lovelier numbers on a program than Chopin’s mazurkas, polonaises,\r\nwaltzes? There is also irresistible swing in the _Ballades_,\r\n_Impromptus_, the _Berceuse_, _Barcarolle_, and what could rival in\r\nfantasy the _Nocturnes_ or _Preludes_? The _Etudes_ cover a variety of\r\nmoods, while his _Scherzos_ stand alone in piano literature.\r\n\r\nChopin left no symphonies, no chamber music, except two piano sonatas\r\nand one for ’cello and piano, and what he did for voice could be told in\r\na few words. He also wrote two piano concertos in which the piano work\r\nis beautiful but the orchestration is not as fine.\r\n\r\nThese concertos and his piano sonatas were the largest forms in which he\r\nwrote, proving that he could have succeeded here had he not chosen to\r\nperfect music in the smaller forms.\r\n\r\nChopin never had a fair start in life in the way of health, and while\r\nhis delicate appearance made him the more interesting, especially to the\r\nladies, he was a real sufferer. It would be unfair to believe that his\r\nwork would have been greater had he enjoyed complete health, for his\r\nunhappiness and his sufferings gave him a sense of the mysterious and\r\nthe beyond. He lived in a world far from material things and seemed able\r\nto translate all he felt into music.\r\n\r\nHe had the devotion of many idolizing friends, tireless in their efforts\r\nto make him happy and keep him working so that he should not brood over\r\nhis illness (tuberculosis). Foremost among these was the famous French\r\nnovelist George Sand, whose love and companionship were the source of\r\nrare inspiration and comfort. She was a woman of vast mental and\r\nphysical power and seemed to impart her strength to him. But Chopin was\r\na favorite not only with women but among the men, as we learn through\r\nthe letters he left. We find many from Schumann, Mendelssohn, Liszt,\r\nDelacroix, the French painter, and innumerable others.\r\n\r\nConcertizing began to fatigue him beyond endurance. Returning to Paris\r\nfrom a tour during a hard winter in England, he grew so ill that he\r\nrarely left his bed, although he did not die until the following\r\nOctober, 1849.\r\n\r\nChopin had asked that the Mozart Requiem be given at his funeral, which\r\noccurred October 30, from the Madeleine Church in Paris. The singer\r\nLablache who had sung the Mozart number at Beethoven’s funeral also\r\nperformed this tribute for Chopin.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Requiem, Lefebure-Wely, one of the fine organists of\r\nParis, played Chopin’s preludes in B and E minor, and the familiar\r\nfuneral march from the first sonata was arranged for orchestra and\r\nplayed for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HELLER—THE CHILDREN’S CHOPIN\r\n\r\nWe may not find the name of Stephen Heller (1813–1888) on many of the\r\n“grown-up” programs, but no pupils’ recitals are complete without\r\nseveral of his lovely melodies.\r\n\r\nHe was the friend of children and devoted himself more to teaching and\r\nwriting for the young minds and small hands than did any of his\r\ncompanions. Heller was intended for a lawyer, but his talent as shown at\r\nnine was great enough for him to study with Carl Czerny in Vienna. He\r\nbecame a fine concert pianist and toured Europe. Taken ill during one of\r\nthese tours, he was adopted by a wealthy family who allowed him all the\r\ntime he wanted for composing. Most of his study was done in Paris where\r\nhe was a friend of Berlioz, Chopin, Liszt and other prominent artists of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nHe left several hundred piano pieces, nearly all masterpieces in a field\r\nwhere he stands practically alone. He wrote in the style developed by\r\nMendelssohn and Schumann, and what Chopin is to the music world of the\r\n“grown-ups,” Heller is to the young student.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Painted by Kriehuber._\r\n\r\n  _Franz Schubert._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After the Painting by Bendemann._\r\n\r\n  _Robert Schumann._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After the Painting by F.

He\r\nmade them live for us with all their joys and sorrows, loves and hates,\r\nin his great music dramas, for which he has been recognized as one of\r\nthe rare geniuses of the world.\r\n\r\nEvoked by his music-magic they pass before us,—the gods and heroes of\r\nWalhalla,—Wotan, Brünnhilde, valiant Siegfried, Pfafner the giant who is\r\nturned into a dragon, Mime the dwarf, the Rhine Maidens and the\r\nValkyries; Parsifal the guileless youth who became the Knight of the\r\nHoly Grail, and Lohengrin his son, the beautiful knight who marries\r\nElsa, a lady of rank of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWe see the minnesingers Tannhäuser and Wolfram von Eschenbach in one of\r\ntheir famous Minstrel Tournaments with the hand of the lovely Elizabeth\r\nas a prize; we also meet the lovable shoemaker-mastersinger Hans Sachs\r\nin Nüremberg, of the 16th century, and David his merry apprentice,\r\nlovely Eva Pogner and the charming knight Walter von Stolzing, and\r\nBeckmesser the clownish mastersinger; then there are the imperious Irish\r\nQueen, Isolde and Tristan, her lover, with Kurvenal his faithful\r\nservant. Wagner makes not only the mythological persons relive but he\r\nbrings back realistic pictures of the everyday life and customs of the\r\nGerman people of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWagner had his idea of what opera should be and nothing short of his\r\nideal interested him. He kept to his purpose and accomplished miraculous\r\nthings whether he suffered or starved or was banished from his country.\r\n\r\nRichard was born at a time, favorable for hearing and knowing the\r\nViennese composers of the 18th and early 19th centuries, who had\r\nincreased the importance of the orchestra. He could hear too the music\r\nof Schumann and Schubert, with all the new beauty and warm feeling they\r\nradiated. This new depth appeared not only in the orchestra but also in\r\npiano and vocal music. In Wagner’s time, people felt deeply about\r\neverything,—science, philosophy, literature, and especially politics;\r\nand many were the quarrels and discontents among nations. Even our own\r\ncountry was torn by a cruel war.\r\n\r\nWagner listened to the works of Mozart and of Beethoven, whom he admired\r\nimmensely. He approved of Beethoven’s use of the chorus in the _Ninth\r\nSymphony_, which had no little effect on his work and ideals.\r\n\r\nAmong the people who most influenced Wagner was Gluck, who first fought\r\nfor sincerity and truth in opera drama. Gluck did not have the advantage\r\nof the grown up orchestra and freer forms, yet Gluck did so much to free\r\nopera that Wagner was fortunate indeed to have come after him. Another\r\ngreat influence was Weber, who mixed everyday story in a delightful play\r\nof fancy and picturesqueness. Wagner, after hearing Weber’s _Die\r\nFreischütz_, was very much impressed.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer, a contemporary, although rather artificial and always working\r\nfor effects, nevertheless showed Wagner the value of gorgeous scenic\r\nproductions. Wagner was fond of the stage, and Meyerbeer’s big scenes\r\nsank into the mind of the young composer-poet, who liked to be called a\r\npoet rather than a musician!\r\n\r\nMusically, Franz Liszt was probably the greatest influence in Wagner’s\r\nlife and we often hear in Wagner’s works bits of melody which remind us\r\nof Liszt.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair to say that he was great just because he followed Gluck,\r\nWeber, and Mozart, for he brought music out of its old ruts and was\r\ncopied by hundreds of composers.\r\n\r\nThe hero of this chapter was born in Leipsic in 1813 and was the\r\nyoungest of nine children. His father died shortly after his birth and\r\nhis mother married an actor playwright named Geyer and they all went to\r\nlive in Dresden. His stepfather felt that Richard had musical gifts and\r\nhe proved a very kind and wise parent. He died when the boy was only\r\neight.\r\n\r\nRichard must have been a most interesting little chap, for he always did\r\neverything with what we would call “pep” and persistence. He loved\r\npoetry and was devoted to the theatre. His stepfather had always allowed\r\nhim to go “back stage” at the playhouse, so the youth became familiar\r\nwith stage craft, which he used later in producing his music dramas.\r\n\r\nHe read the Greek and German poets and dramatists at a very early age.\r\nHe was the first of the musical geniuses to be trained in the arts\r\nbefore he started music. So we can picture a little chap,\r\n“stage-struck,” studying when he should, seeing plays when he could, and\r\nlistening to the works of Weber and Beethoven which enchanted him, and\r\nstoring up ideas, but as yet showing no great leaning toward music as a\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nThe family moved back to Leipsic in 1827 where he went to school until\r\nhe entered the university in 1831. He heard much orchestral music and\r\nbecame so deeply charmed with Beethoven, that he copied the _Ninth\r\nSymphony_ from a score, to become familiar with it. The _Ninth\r\nSymphony_ with chorale takes about two hours to perform, imagine how\r\nlong it took to copy it! An instance of the wizard’s energy and\r\n“stick-to-it-iveness”!\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A KILLING PLAY\r\n\r\nHe began to study music with C. G. Müller, for Beethoven’s works made\r\nhim decide that he wanted to know more. He also was taught by Theodore\r\nWeinlig, the cantor or singer of St. Thomas’ school. At sixteen, he\r\nwrote a play which had so tragic a plot that he killed off forty-two of\r\nthe characters, and afterwards said, he had to bring some back as ghosts\r\nto wind up the drama, for there were no characters left alive! His drama\r\nreading made him exaggerate tragedy in his own play! After this he wrote\r\na sonata, a polonaise and a symphony, in classic style, performed in\r\n1833.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 there had been a political revolution in Germany and it greatly\r\nimpressed the young man for he was an independent thinker in politics as\r\nwell as in music.\r\n\r\nHe visited Vienna in 1832 but he found it so appreciative of Hérold’s\r\nopera _Zampa_ and Strauss’ waltzes that he could not bear it and left\r\nalmost immediately. He was much like Beethoven in disposition for he was\r\nquick to anger and kind in great gusts, and could be most agreeable to\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HIS EARLY OPERAS\r\n\r\nHe had gone to Vienna with his symphony but showed it to no one; it is\r\nsaid that Mendelssohn saw it but forgot about it. Here he wrote the poem\r\nand some poor music for an opera _Die Hochzeit_ (_The Wedding_) which he\r\ntore up the next year.\r\n\r\nThen off to Prague went he (1832), and wrote his first libretto, for you\r\nmust remember he did not go to people like Metastastio or Molière for\r\nhis libretto but wrote his own. Had he not been a composer he certainly\r\nwould have been a literary man. In fact, he was, for he wrote more\r\npamphlets and books than many a writer! Yet, he showed his real genius\r\nas a composer.\r\n\r\nBut he was so poor now that he was glad to get a job as a chorus master\r\nat the mean salary of 10 florins ($5) a month! It was here he wrote the\r\nopera _Die Feen_ (_The Fairies_) a wildly romantic work, after which he\r\nreturned again to Leipsic. For the first time he heard Wilhelmine\r\nSchroeder-Devrient sing, whose marvelous talent influenced him all his\r\nlife. In 1834 as a conductor of a troupe with headquarters in Magdeburg,\r\nhe tried to produce his second opera the tragic _Das Liebesverbot_\r\n(_Forbidden Love_), modeled after Shakespeare’s _Measure for Measure_;\r\nbut it was so badly given that it was a dismal failure. The second was\r\nlike Bellini and Auber, both of whom he admired and it was too early in\r\nhis life (twenty-one) to show new ways of composing.\r\n\r\nSoon he went to Königsberg, where (1836) he married Wilhelmina Planer, a\r\nyoung actress whom he met in the theatre, and he spent the year trying\r\nto get his Magdeburg troupe out of difficulties. Later he was given a\r\npost in Riga.\r\n\r\nWhile at Riga his duty was to lead orchestral concerts, at many of which\r\nOle Bull the Norwegian violinist played, here too, he read _Rienzi_ of\r\nBulwer-Lytton, the English writer, and wrote a libretto and opera on the\r\nshowy model of Meyerbeer. He said himself that it “out-Meyerbeered\r\nMeyerbeer.” Leaving hastily, debts and all, with _Rienzi_ in his hand,\r\nhe went to Paris (the goal of all composers) in a sailing vessel, with\r\nhis new wife and a dog named Robber, stopping over in England. The trip\r\ntook four long perilous weeks. From the sailors he learned the story of\r\nthe Flying Dutchman, which he afterwards used in his opera of that name.\r\n\r\nWe wish we could tell you the whole story of this gale-tossed, unhappy\r\nmariner, the Flying Dutchman, and how at last he found happiness and\r\nrelief from storms and troubles of life by finding his mate in the\r\nmaiden Senta. You will love the music and the story which is woven about\r\nSenta in the beautiful ballad bearing her name.\r\n\r\nIn this opera, Wagner first used the _leit-motif_ or leading theme\r\n(particularly in the overture) which he used as we use a name or\r\ndescription of a person, idea or thing, except that he used them in\r\nmusic instead of in words. For example, when Senta comes in to the\r\nstory, either as someone’s thought or as a person, or when she is spoken\r\nof, her theme is heard, woven into the music. So it is when Siegfried\r\nappears in the operas of the _Ring of the Nibelungen_, you hear the\r\nSiegfried theme; when the Gold is mentioned, you hear the Gold theme; or\r\nif the Giants appear, their theme is heard,—so it is with the Dragon and\r\neverything connected with the story. You hear in some form, their name\r\nplates, as it were, and so by listening, you can follow just what is\r\ngoing on through the music. This is one of the things that Wagner\r\ndeveloped, though Gluck and others had attempted to use it.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Paris, he had a struggle for existence and did\r\neverything possible to gain a livelihood, while striving to get a\r\nhearing for his compositions. He wrote, in his misery, the _Faust\r\nOverture_, the first work to win recognition.\r\n\r\nHe went to see Meyerbeer on his way to Paris, for Meyerbeer was very\r\npopular and his approval could have aided poor Richard. Some say\r\nMeyerbeer helped him and others say he did not. Wagner gained little\r\nfrom him. Even when he first went to see Liszt, who later became his\r\nbest friend, it is said that Liszt snubbed him. Wagner never stopped\r\nwriting his theories for the papers, and a hot-headed young scribbler he\r\nwas! Yet withal he submitted the story of _The Flying Dutchman_ to the\r\ndirector of the Paris Opera House who rejected it as an opera, but gave\r\nthe story to Dietsch, the conductor, to write the music. This did not\r\ndaunt Wagner, who, after a defeat, worked harder or his next task. So he\r\nwrote another _Flying Dutchman_, story and music and orchestration in\r\nseven weeks!\r\n\r\nHowever, luck began to favor him, and _Rienzi_ (1842) was accepted by\r\nthe Dresden Opera and was so successful that he became conductor in\r\nDresden, which saved him for a while from money worries, and _The Flying\r\nDutchman_, which had gone begging so long, was loudly demanded. Strange\r\nto say, this wonderful legend did not succeed, for the people missed the\r\nlittle tricks of Meyerbeer and they could not understand the flowing\r\nmusic in new form. Wagner was very disappointed for the story was one of\r\nthe old German (Teuton) legends and he thought the German people would\r\nlove it.\r\n\r\nLater, however, Spohr gave it with great success at Cassel, and won\r\nWagner’s gratitude for his understanding and kindness.\r\n\r\nNow comes _Tannhäuser_, an entrancing legend which inspired him to study\r\nmore deeply into the Teutonic legends. This he produced in Dresden, and\r\nother German cities played it later. Everything became topsy-turvy in\r\nthe musical and political world. Wagner was writing fiery things about\r\nfreedom in music and politics, nothing to amount to much, but enough to\r\nrouse his enemies, who became hateful and hissed _Tannhäuser_,—calling\r\nit nerve-killing, distressing music without melody. How could anyone\r\nfail to find melody in _Oh Thou Sublime Sweet Evening Star_, the\r\n_Pilgrim’s Chorus_, the _Venusburg_ music and the colorful overture with\r\nthemes of the whole opera? Yet music affects people this way when it is\r\nnew in structure. “There is no melody” is said today when the so-called\r\nmodern music is played. This should make us stop and listen carefully\r\nand look back on what happened to the writers of the past when they\r\ndared differ from the crowd. Perhaps calling your attention to this will\r\nmake you listen with open ears and open minds to the new, which so soon\r\nbecomes the familiar.\r\n\r\nSo Wagner, while conducting other operas in Dresden, began on\r\n_Lohengrin_ and finished it in 1847. But he was impetuous and his\r\nwritten articles irritated the people. His ideas were fiery and his\r\nmusical speech so odd, that even Schumann, who was very sympathetic,\r\nonly partially understood him or his music. However he did say that\r\nWagner would have a great influence on German opera, but Mendelssohn,\r\nafter hearing _Tannhäuser_, only liked the second finale. Even his\r\nfriend Madame Devrient, though she loved and admired him, said: “You are\r\na man of genius but you write such eccentric stuff, it is hardly\r\npossible to sing it.”\r\n\r\nNever did Wagner feel that he was at fault, so great was his faith in\r\nhis ideas of doing away with arias, of not having stopping places in an\r\nopera, just to begin some other song, and of making the words equally\r\nimportant to the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE NIBELUNGEN RING\r\n\r\nWhile working at _Lohengrin_ he had started his studies of the Icelandic\r\nand Germanic Saga, the _Nibelungenlied_. These tales changed under his\r\npen into the story of Siegfried, which he wove into the trilogy known as\r\n_The Nibelungen Ring_ or _Trilogy with a Prologue_, as he called it, and\r\nas we call it now—_The Tetralogy_ (in four parts).\r\n\r\nThe four dramas of the _Ring of the Nibelung_ are:\r\n\r\n(1) _The Rhine Gold_ (_Das Rheingold_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Valkyrie_ (_Die Walküre_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Siegfried_\r\n\r\n(4) _The Twilight of the Gods_ (_Die Götterdämmerung_)\r\n\r\nMany things happen in these tales but it takes the four to tell the one\r\nbig story:\r\n\r\nAlberich the wicked Nibelung, a gnome, in his greed steals the gold from\r\nthe Rhine Maidens who were guarding it, hidden in the Rhine. They tell\r\nhim that the one who fashions a ring out of the gold will rule the\r\nworld, but must forego love. Alberich makes the ring but Wotan the god\r\nof the gods wrests it from him. During the drama various people secure\r\nthe Ring but it had been cursed by Alberich and brings disaster to all\r\nwho get it. Finally the very gods themselves are doomed to destruction,\r\nand Brünnhilde the oldest of the Valkyries, the daughters of Wotan,\r\nreturns the stolen treasure to the waters of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard has painted in magnificent music the great Rhine River,\r\nflowing across the stage; the fire surrounding Brünnhilde until she is\r\nrescued by the valiant Siegfried, who knows no fear; Valhalla the home\r\nof the gods; the hunt in which Siegfried drinks from the magic horn of\r\nmemory; and his funeral pyre into which Brünnhilde casts herself and her\r\nhorse carrying the ring which she has taken from Siegfried’s finger back\r\nto the Rhine Maidens from whence it came.\r\n\r\nThe scenes are gigantic and so is the music. Wagner, with his ideals for\r\nfreedom and the betterment of humanity, used these legends as a cloak to\r\ncover his personal opinions which would have been looked upon as\r\nanarchism if he had not used such clever and artistic symbols. In\r\nAlberich’s greed for the gold, is hidden Wagner’s ideas of the\r\nGovernment’s greed for power against which he had fought so strenuously.\r\nAnother lesson is that anyone possessing the gold is denied love,\r\nshowing that greed kills human feelings.\r\n\r\nBecause the Opera at Dresden did not use the things he liked, he\r\nrebelled openly against the popular political and musical ideas; he was\r\nbanished and went to Zürich, Switzerland. Here he wrote more fiery\r\nliterature and made more enemies and a few friends, and the enmity he\r\nstirred up against himself delayed his success. He hoped for a better\r\nstate of political life in order to write freer and more beautiful\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in Zürich, Liszt, in Vienna, produced _Lohengrin_ with\r\nsuccess. It was given to celebrate Goethe’s birthday (1850), before a\r\nbrilliant audience, and now Wagner’s fame seemed sure, though his\r\n“pockets were empty.” _Lohengrin’s_ success was slow in Germany, as it\r\ntook about nine years to reach Berlin and Dresden. It was thought to be\r\nwithout melody! Can you hear Lohengrin’s song to the Swan, the Wedding\r\nMarch or the Prelude? Listen to it in your mind’s ear or auralize it!\r\nWagner’s themes were so marvelously interwoven and he did such amazing\r\nthings with his orchestra, that it was difficult for people to unravel\r\nthe torrential new music. They were not prepared for endless music\r\nflowing on like speech, suiting the music to the word and not stopping\r\nthe action to show off the singer’s skill. What Gluck _tried_ to do,\r\nWagner did. His operas were music dramas because the action or drama was\r\nhis first thought.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years in exile, he gave himself to literary work and\r\ncomposition. He had ample time now to write of his musical theories and\r\nhis feelings about life.\r\n\r\nSoon, London called him to lead the Philharmonic Society, which he did\r\nduring the time he was completing _Valkyrie_ and sketching _Siegfried_.\r\nHe tried to interest the English in Beethoven and others whom he loved,\r\nbut of little avail. The people preferred the delightful delicacy of\r\nMendelssohn to the solidity of Beethoven. So here again he made more\r\nenemies than friends, and his bitter pen did not help to smooth things\r\nover. By the time he left London, he had finished the _Valkyrie_.\r\n\r\nIn this great music drama, he tells the story of Siegmund and Sieglinda,\r\nBrünnhilde and the Valkyries who carried the dead warriors from the\r\nbattle fields on their saddles to Valhalla. You hear in the galloping\r\nmusic of the _Ride of the Valkyries_ and the _Fire Music_ and _Love\r\nSong_ of the first act, such music as never was written by anyone but\r\nWagner! Oh, it is a wonderful legend, explaining itself, in Wagner’s own\r\npoems and with the short music name tags (leit-motifs) which are\r\nenlarged and turned around and intermingled with other name tags and\r\nwhich stand out beautifully when you know how to listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TRISTAN AND ISOLDE AND MEISTERSINGER\r\n\r\nWhile in Zürich, Wagner met the merchant Otto Wesendonck, whose\r\nbeautiful and poetic wife Wagner loved dearly. She was a great influence\r\nin his life and they were friends for many years. It was during his\r\nfriendship that he started the love drama of _Tristan and Isolde_.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 he finished the love drama which tells of Tristan and the lovely\r\nQueen of Ireland and how they drank the love potion and how they loved\r\nand were separated. A noble story with some of the most grippingly\r\nbeautiful music ever written!\r\n\r\nBut with this masterpiece of masterpieces completed, he could get nobody\r\nto produce it. Everyone said it was impossible to sing it, and we know\r\neven today that it takes very special musical gifts and few can do it\r\nwell. For it is quite true that Wagner, with all his theories about\r\ncomposition, thought little of the singer’s throat muscles and more of\r\nwhat he wanted to say.\r\n\r\nPoor Wagner was disconsolate! He could not get his works performed and\r\nhe was still prevented from returning to Germany, the country he loved.\r\nSo off he went to Paris and there _Tannhäuser_ failed utterly after\r\nthree terrible, turbulent, horrible performances, which almost ended in\r\nriots, no doubt planned ahead by his enemies.\r\n\r\nBut to offset this disaster, he was allowed to return home and everyone\r\nrejoiced in his arrival. No doubt his treatment in Paris softened the\r\nGerman heart.\r\n\r\nNot long after this Wagner and his wife separated and some years later\r\nin 1871, he married Cosima Liszt, who had been the wife of Hans von\r\nBülow.\r\n\r\nAfter Wagner conducted opera on a tour through Russia, Hungary, Bohemia\r\n(Czecho-Slovakia) and many German cities, Ludwig II, King of Bavaria,\r\nsent for Wagner and offered him an income, and from this time on Wagner\r\ncomposed without financial worries. He was commissioned in 1865 to\r\ncomplete _The Ring_, and _Tristan and Isolde_ was performed by Hans von\r\nBülow.\r\n\r\nAgain political intrigues and his enemies drove him to Switzerland, and\r\nafter _Tristan and Isolde_ was given and while he was in Switzerland, he\r\ncompleted _The Ring_ and _Die Meistersinger_, the most beautiful comic\r\nopera in the world, which was also produced by von Bülow in Munich, June\r\n21st, 1868. And now we fulfill our promise to you, which we made in\r\nChapter VIII about the Meistersinger:\r\n\r\nWalther von Stolzing, a young knight, falls in love at first sight with\r\nEva the beautiful daughter of Pogner, the goldsmith of Nüremberg, who\r\nhas promised her to the winning singer in the coming Festival of the\r\nMastersingers. Beckmesser, the old town clerk, counts on winning as he\r\nalso loves Eva. As Walther does not belong to the music guild, he has to\r\npass the examination. Beckmesser gives him so many bad marks for not\r\nkeeping the committee’s rules that he is not admitted.\r\n\r\nBut Hans Sachs, the greatest Meistersinger of all, the town cobbler,\r\nthought Walther a beautiful singer even though he broke musical laws and\r\nthe very freedom and the new loveliness in his music charmed him.\r\n\r\nIn the evening when Walther and Eva try to run away, Beckmesser decides\r\nto serenade Eva. Hans Sachs, cobbling shoes in his doorway interrupts\r\nBeckmesser’s ludicrous serenade with a jolly song, in which he marks all\r\nBeckmesser’s mistakes with his hammer, just as Beckmesser had marked\r\nWalther’s. The neighborhood is aroused, confusion follows, Beckmesser\r\ngets a beating and Hans Sachs slips Eva and Walther into his own house.\r\n\r\nNext day Walther sings a song to Hans which he has dreamed and Hans\r\nwrites it down. Beckmesser comes in and finding the words steals them,\r\nsure he could win if he sang a song of Hans Sachs.\r\n\r\nBeckmesser fails miserably and Sachs calls on Walther to sing it. Here\r\nhe sings Walther’s _Prize Song_, which wins the approval of the\r\nMeistersingers, and the prize—lovely Eva.\r\n\r\nHere we get a splendid idea of what Wagner felt about new music, for in\r\nthe _Meistersinger_ he tried to picture the jealousies of composers, who\r\ncondemned the beauty of his inspiration and new ideas and methods.\r\n\r\nNever was there an opera more delightful for young people, who love the\r\nmelodies and charming pictures of medieval Nüremberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BAYREUTH\r\n\r\nAbout this time the _Valkyrie_ and _Rhinegold_ had been given at the\r\nCourt Theatre in Munich (1869–1870). The King gave up his plan to build\r\na new theatre for these stupendous works, which needed special machinery\r\nbecause of the elaborate stage effects. Wagner insisted that scenery was\r\nas important as the words and music. So he started to build, by general\r\nsubscription over all Europe, a theatre at Bayreuth. He succeeded so\r\nwell that not only did Europe contribute but America, too, and groups of\r\npeople banded together to collect money for it. Wagner was now the\r\nfashion and finally the new opera house opened August 13th, 1876, with\r\n_The Ring_, for he had finished _Die Götterdämmerung_ the year before.\r\n\r\nArtistically it was successful but not financially. If his pen had been\r\ndipped in honey and not in bitters, he would have won his public more\r\neasily, but he seemed unable to be diplomatic. So off he went to London\r\nand other places to conduct concerts to make money to pay the debts of\r\nhis new theatre. Later he wrote the Festival March, for the Philadelphia\r\nCentennial (1876), which helped financially.\r\n\r\nThe people were divided into two camps,—those for Wagner, and those\r\nagainst him. So strong was the feeling, that during the 1880’s, in\r\nGermany, signs in cafés read: “It is forbidden to discuss religion or\r\nWagner”! The proprietors wished to save their chairs and china which the\r\nfists of their patrons would destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PARSIFAL\r\n\r\nDuring this time he was at work on _Parsifal_, a drama in music as\r\nserious as oratorio yet with the most thrilling stage effects and\r\nrichness of music. _Parsifal_, _Tristan and Isolde_, _The Ring_ and _Die\r\nMeistersinger_ are to every other opera what a plum pudding is, compared\r\nto a graham cracker. In fact, all Wagner’s late music dramas are like\r\nplum puddings, so rich and compact are they.\r\n\r\n_Parsifal_ was produced in 1882 in Bayreuth and was not given again for\r\nsix years. Later it was the occasion for yearly pilgrimages to Bayreuth,\r\nas if to a shrine. It is so long that it takes the better part of an\r\nafternoon and evening to perform it, yet you sit enraptured before its\r\ngripping spell of beauty and holiness.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 the musical world was startled by the first performance in\r\nAmerica of _Parsifal_, as Wagner, in his will, had forbidden a stage\r\nperformance outside of Bayreuth. It was covered by copyright until 1913,\r\nwhich was supposed to have protected it from performance. Heinrich\r\nConried, director of the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York City, in\r\nhis eagerness for novelties, disregarded the master’s wish, and mounted\r\nan elaborate production under the direction of Alfred Hertz. This so\r\noffended the Wagner family that they refused to allow anyone who had\r\ntaken part in that performance to appear in Bayreuth.\r\n\r\nBayreuth became a Mecca, to which pilgrims went every other year, to\r\nattend the festivals. After the World War, Wagner’s family turned to\r\nAmerica for help to continue these festivals, interrupted by the war, as\r\nthe Wizard himself had done, when building his theatre. In 1924 his son,\r\nSiegfried, visited America, conducted some symphony concerts and secured\r\nfunds to carry on the festivals.\r\n\r\n_Parsifal_ is a combination of three legends—of which one is the\r\n_Parsifal_ of our old friend the Minnesinger Wolfram von Eschenbach\r\n(1204). (Chapter VIII.)\r\n\r\nIt is the story of the Redemption of Mankind, told in symbols with great\r\nbeauty of poetry, music and scenery. It is certain to fill you with\r\nreligious fervor, for it reaches the depths of your soul and raises you\r\nabove the things of the earth. Amfortas, the guardian of the Holy Grail,\r\nwhose wound represents the suffering of mankind, hears the mystic voice\r\nof his father, Titurel, who tells him that not until a sinless one comes\r\nwith pity in his heart will the wound be healed. Parsifal, “the\r\nguileless fool,” is his redeemer.\r\n\r\nThe year following the first production of _Parsifal_ Wagner’s health\r\nbegan to fail and he went to Venice where he died suddenly in 1883. He\r\nwas buried with fitting honors at Bayreuth which always honors the\r\nmemory of the Great Master of German Opera.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of Wagner in the words of his brother-in-law: “the\r\ndouble aspect of this powerful personality was shown in his face; the\r\nupper part beautiful with a vast ideality, and lighted with eyes which\r\nwere deep and severe, gentle or malicious, according to the\r\ncircumstances; the lower part wry and sarcastic. A mouth cold and\r\ncalculating and pursed up, was cut slantingly into a face beneath an\r\nimperious nose, and above a chin which projected like the menace of a\r\nconquering will.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HOW THE WIZARD CHANGED OPERA\r\n\r\nWhen Wagner reached his full power, he composed drama rather than opera\r\nin the old sense.\r\n\r\nHis music explained the words and action and expressed the state of mind\r\nof the character.\r\n\r\nThe melodies are used very much like the theme in a sonata. These\r\nleit-motifs (leading motives) are usually carried, as we told you, in\r\nthe weavings of his wonderful orchestral webs. This theme or leit-motif\r\nor name tag, is tossed from instrument to instrument in numberless\r\nentrancing ways. Sometimes he uses a flickering theme for flames as in\r\nthe fire music of _The Valkyrie_ or glorious chimes or trumpetings as in\r\n_Parsifal_ to cast a holy spell; but, whatever he uses, he charms and\r\nholds you spellbound.\r\n\r\nHe combines the counterpoint of the 16th century masters, with a most\r\nmodern feeling for harmony, inherited from the classic Germans. He used\r\nharmony in a new way with a freedom it never before had reached, and\r\npointed the way for modern composers of today.\r\n\r\nAs the Wizard, Wagner throws a glamor over the most mystic happening, as\r\nwhen Siegmund, in _Die Valkyrie_, withdraws the Sword from the tree; or\r\nin the most commonplace fact as when Eva tells Hans Sachs that she has a\r\nnail in her shoe. In _The Meistersinger_, you can always tell that he is\r\nmaking fun of Beckmesser, because his name tag shows him to be petty and\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wagner’s music is rich, very clear to us and beautiful, in his\r\nday it seemed complicated and discordant, because of its great volume\r\nand sonority, the result of the perfect part-writing.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, he makes the brasses of equal importance to the\r\nstring and wind instruments. It is thrilling to hear the trombones and\r\nhis beautiful use of trumpets. He used many of Berlioz’s ideas in\r\nmuffling horns and added new instruments, too, among them, the bass\r\nclarinet and the English horn (_cor anglais_), which is a tenor oboe and\r\nnot a horn at all!\r\n\r\nWagner had a beautiful way of dividing up the parts for violins and\r\nother instruments into smaller choirs which answered each other and with\r\nwhich he could get special effects. For example, the Prelude of\r\n_Lohengrin_ is probably the nearest thing in shimmering music to what\r\nthe angels must play, so heavenly is it. Here he divides the violins\r\ninto many parts and it is far more beautiful than if they all played the\r\nsame thing. Thus, he gave more value to the instruments and greatly\r\nimproved the orchestra.\r\n\r\nHis preludes in which you hear the leading motives or name tags, are a\r\ntable of contents for what follows.\r\n\r\nWagner did not use tricks of decoration like Meyerbeer nor did he give\r\nshow-off pieces for his singers’ benefit. His idea was to use sincere\r\nmusical speech to tell the story and not one bit did he care how hard\r\nthe singer worked to carry out his idea.\r\n\r\nWagner, above all, was a dramatist, choosing lofty and noble themes of\r\nheroic and ideal subjects in which his imagination could play. He loved\r\nthe sublime and the great spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of Wagner’s opera is in the orchestra which carries\r\nthe theme webs. He used neither the folk song in its simple beauty nor\r\naccepted classic arias which could be taken out and sung. His song is\r\noften declaimed and appears not to sing with the orchestra, for the\r\nvoices are used as instruments and not to show off vocal skill. Yet,\r\nLiszt was quick to take out from the operas and transcribe for piano the\r\nFire Music, the Ride of the Valkyrie and many others which we now sing\r\nand whistle.\r\n\r\nFinally, Wagner by his example has given courage to the man of ideas, if\r\nhe will believe in himself and work without ceasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n            More Opera Makers—Verdi and Meyerbeer to Our Day\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading about the feats of the Wizard it is not surprising that he\r\nhad many followers,—those who openly claimed to take him for an example,\r\nand others who did not realize how much they received from him and would\r\nnot like to have been called his followers!\r\n\r\n\r\n                    VERDI—THE GRAND OLD MAN OF ITALY\r\n\r\nAfter following the Italian methods of writing opera and having become a\r\nvery famous composer, Verdi received inspiration from Wagner in the last\r\nthree or four years of his very long life. He was much loved and it is\r\ndifficult to tell whether it was his operas or his beautiful character\r\nwhich prompted the affection. He was called “the Grand Old Man of\r\nItaly.” A national hero was he, and the Italians’ idol. Praise and\r\nflattery did not make him proud but spurred him to work through trouble\r\nand good fortune, and so he became one of the greatest opera writers. He\r\nwas born a few months after Wagner, in the village of Roncole near\r\nParma, and his life was interesting, for he lived at the time when opera\r\nwas popular and was going through the Wagner upheaval which spread all\r\nover Europe.\r\n\r\nHe had a unique chance to make opera more important in Italy, and\r\nsucceeded in giving it a new impetus, even though in the beginning his\r\npopular things followed popular patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VERDI AND THE ORGAN GRINDER\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Verdi (1813–1901) was the son of an innkeeper and, as a little\r\nboy, showed marked musical talent. He was a good obedient little fellow,\r\nbut always rather melancholy in character and never joined the village\r\nboys in their noisy amusements. “One thing only could rouse him from his\r\nhabitual indifference, and that was the occasional passing through the\r\nvillage of an organ grinder. To the child, who in after years was to\r\nafford an inexhaustible repertory to those instruments for half a\r\ncentury all over the world, this was an irresistible attraction. He\r\ncould not be kept indoors, and would follow the strolling player as far\r\nas his little legs could carry him.” (Grove’s Dictionary.)\r\n\r\nWho has not heard the _Miserere_ from _Il Trovatore_ played, all out of\r\ntune, by an Italian organ grinder who sends a little monkey around with\r\na cup to gather in the pennies? We remember an organ grinder in San\r\nFrancisco who ground out the _Miserere_. Each year or two that we\r\nreturned there were more of the notes missing. Ten years later, the\r\nperformance was quite “toothless” and sounded very funny.\r\n\r\nAll his life, Verdi kept a little spinet that his father bought for him\r\nin 1820. We see him then, at seven, deep in musical study and at ten he\r\nwas the organist of Roncole, going to school in Busseto, a nearby town.\r\nOne night when he was walking the three miles to go back to Busseto\r\nafter church, the poor little fellow was so weary that he missed the\r\nroad and fell into a canal, narrowly escaping death! Is it not splendid\r\nthat his village appreciated his talent and gave him a scholarship which\r\nmade it possible for him to go to Milan to continue his musical studies!\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HIS OPERAS\r\n\r\nHe did not compose an opera until 1839 when his _Oberto_ in the style of\r\nBellini was produced in Milan with such success that he received orders\r\nto write three more from which he gained much good-will and fame.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a thrilling time for opera writers, because Wagner was\r\ncomposing, too, and you know the great excitement he caused. Amidst this\r\ninteresting whirl of opinion, Verdi wrote one of the operas ordered by\r\nthe Milan director, and during this time he was sorely stricken by the\r\ndeaths of his wife and two lovely children. Besides this, his opera\r\nfailed and in his discouragement the poor young man made up his mind to\r\ngive up composition. However, a rare good friend coaxed him back to his\r\nwork after a little rest, and he produced his successful _Nebucco_\r\n(_Nebuchadnezzar_) (1842), _I Lombardi_ the next year and his well known\r\n_Ernani_ (1844). In this, his first period, he used as models, Bellini\r\nand men of his type, not writing anything startlingly new.\r\n\r\nIn his second period he wrote operas nearly as fast as we write school\r\ncompositions, and among the famous things are _Rigoletto_ (1851), _Il\r\nTrovatore_, _La Traviata_ (story from Dumas’ _Camille_ or _Dame aux\r\nCamelias_), (1853), and _The Masked Ball_ (1859). _Ernani and Rigoletto_\r\nare founded on stories by Victor Hugo. The first performance of _La\r\nTraviata_ in Venice was a failure due more to the performers, than to\r\nthe opera itself which still crowds opera houses of the world.\r\n\r\nThe greatest opera of his third period is _Aida_ (1871), one of Verdi’s\r\nmasterpieces. An opera on an Egyptian subject was ordered by the Khedive\r\nof Egypt for the opening of the Italian Opera House in Cairo, for which\r\nVerdi received $20,000. Mariette Bey a famous Egyptologist made the\r\nfirst sketch in order to give the right local atmosphere to the\r\nlibretto. Curiosity ran so high that every seat was sold before the\r\nfirst night and it was a great success. Think how electrified the\r\naudience must have been by the tenor solo, “Celeste Aida,” one of\r\nCaruso’s greatest successes; by the realistic Nile scene; the voice of\r\nthe priestess in the mammoth Egyptian temple, and the famous march with\r\ntrumpets made specially for it!\r\n\r\nDear old lovable Verdi was a wise man as well as an accomplished\r\ncomposer. He used more modern methods in _Aida_ to hold audiences who\r\nwere hearing about Wagner and his startling innovations.\r\n\r\nOther operas of this third period were _La Forza del Destino_ and one\r\ngiven at the Paris Grand Opera, _Don Carlos_, which was not up to his\r\nstandard. Until this time he showed great mechanical skill and a sense\r\nof color and melody. The great singers have revelled in the operas of\r\nhis second period. In our day Marcella Sembrich, Nellie Melba, Frieda\r\nHempel, Luisa Tetrazzini, Amelita Galli-Curci, Florence Macbeth and many\r\nothers have sung the coloratura,—frilly, soaring, gymnastic-singing,\r\nstill very popular. However in _Aida_, Verdi departed much from the\r\nusual, and people said that he was copying Wagner, because they didn’t\r\nknow the difference between the influences which change a person’s ways,\r\nand imitation.\r\n\r\nSo he deserted the old models, Auber, Meyerbeer and Halévy for something\r\nmore substantial, his deeper and gigantically conceived _Aida_. James\r\nWolfe of the Metropolitan Opera said of the bigness of this work as\r\nproduced at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York: “I have played\r\nbefore audiences of 30,000 in arenas in Mexico. I am so at home in the\r\nopera that I do cross-word puzzles waiting for my cue, and yet at the\r\nMetropolitan when I first played the King in _Aida_ with its flaming\r\nmusic, its hundreds of people and its scores of horses, I was over-awed\r\nand frightened!”\r\n\r\nAfter this, Verdi’s splendid mass, _The Requiem_, was written for the\r\ndeath of the Italian hero Manzoni. In it he approaches the German school\r\nin depth and seriousness, veering away from the emptiness of Italian\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nIn his last efforts he seems definitely influenced by Wagner; for, with\r\nhis _Otello_ and _Falstaff_ we find a new Verdi, surpassing in form and\r\nsincere melody anything that he had done. He was very fortunate to have\r\nArrigo Boito, his friend, to write librettos based on Shakespeare’s\r\n_Othello_ and _Merry Wives of Windsor_. When _Falstaff_ was given in New\r\nYork (1925) a young American baritone, Lawrence Tibbet, in the rôle of\r\nFord, flashed into fame.\r\n\r\nVerdi was a man of the people, loving Italy and being loved in return, a\r\nmaster of voice, ready to take good suggestions to improve his work,\r\nalways kind, high-minded, and generous. He knew the orchestra and wrote\r\nfor it in a way that not only gave, in his last three masterpieces, a\r\nnew flavor to Italian opera, but led the way for future composers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BOITO AND HIS “MEFISTOFELE”\r\n\r\nArrigo Boito (1842–1918), journalist, poet, and composer sprang into\r\nprominence with his _Mefistofele_, in which the Russian singer,\r\nChaliapin, has attracted huge audiences at the Metropolitan. When it was\r\nfirst given in Italy, the audiences missed the coloratura arias, and the\r\ncritics were very hard on the young composer. So he went back to\r\njournalism for many years. His next opera _Nero_ has a gory plot, but is\r\nreal and not embroidered as were most of the Italian operas. Boito had\r\nstudied in Germany and had absorbed much of the realism and truthfulness\r\nthat Gluck and Wagner, taught. _Nero_ had an elaborate first performance\r\n(1924) by the celebrated Arturo Toscanini, one of the greatest living\r\nconductors, at _La Scala_ in Milan. It is a tremendous stage spectacle,\r\nsurpassing in scenic effect many of the older melodramas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                “CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA” AND “I PAGLIACCI”\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the first truly realistic opera was written in Italy. A prize\r\nwas offered by the publisher Sonzogno and an unknown man, Pietro\r\nMascagni, won it with _Cavalleria Rusticana_ (_Rustic Chivalry_). He was\r\nborn in 1863, the son of a baker. He was a musical boy, but his father\r\nwished him to be a lawyer, so he had to work at the piano in secret. One\r\nday when he had been locked up by his father who did not want him to\r\npractise, he was discovered by his uncle, who sympathized with him and\r\ntook him to Count Florestan, who helped the young musician to study in\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nMascagni’s work in _Cavalleria Rusticana_ was vivid and he used both the\r\nold and the new style of writing. It is full of the most entrancing\r\nmelody (the Intermezzo, the Brindisi, or drinking song, and Santuzza’s\r\naria, _Voi lo sapete_). He also wrote _Iris_ and _Amico Fritz_, which\r\nnever equalled _Cavalleria_.\r\n\r\nWith Ruggiero Leoncavallo (1858–) it was different, for only after\r\nwriting a number of operas did he produce a success in the world-famous\r\n_I Pagliacci_. He wrote the tragic story of these strolling players as\r\nwell as the music, which is not as popular in style as _Cavalleria_, but\r\nit is superbly put together and very dramatic. As these operas are both\r\nshort, they are often performed together. The rôle of Canio (_I\r\nPagliacci_) was one of Caruso’s masterpieces. How wonderful to think\r\nthat his voice has been preserved for the future generations through his\r\nrecords of which _Ridi Pagliaccio_ (_Laugh Clown_) is one of the finest.\r\nIt is generally admitted that Caruso’s voice was the most glorious of\r\nour age, and certainly there was no artist more idolized than he. In\r\nthis same opera Antonio Scotti’s performance of the famous Prologue is\r\nequally beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GIORDANO\r\n\r\nUmberto Giordano (1867) goes into peculiar realms for subjects for his\r\noperas. He uses local political intrigues and literature for his themes,\r\nand is known especially for his _André Chenier_ and _Fedora_ which are\r\ngiven in many opera houses of the world. In _Siberia_ he uses folk songs\r\nof Russia. He has recently set _The Jest_ by Sem Benelli librettist of\r\n_L’Amore dei Tre Re_ (_The Love of Three Kings_) by Italo Montemezzi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PUCCINI THE POPULAR IDOL\r\n\r\nNow we come to a delightful opera maker, Giacomo Puccini (1858–1924). He\r\nis the greatest modern Italian with the exception of Verdi. He has a\r\ndistinctive touch that gives him individuality. He keeps a nice balance\r\nbetween voice, orchestra and melody. His music is always full of color\r\nand feeling. His themes, for the most part, touch the heart and have\r\ngained wide popularity.\r\n\r\nHis first opera was _Manon Lescaut_, the same story which Massenet used\r\nin his delightful opera _Manon_; _La Bohème_ is his next and is often\r\nsaid to be his best. It is a tale of artist life in the Latin Quarter of\r\nParis and is full of romance, color, gaiety and sadness. His story is\r\ntaken from Murger’s _Vie de Bohème_, which was a fortunate choice.\r\n_Madame Butterfly_ is another of his glittering successes. It has a\r\ndecided Japanese flavor in its musical phrases. It is based on a story\r\nby John Luther Long, which was made into a play by David Belasco.\r\nButterfly was one of Geraldine Farrar’s loveliest rôles.\r\n\r\n_Tosca_, in which Farrar, Caruso and Scotti made a famous trio, is a\r\nblood curdling drama of murder, cruelty and love, full of music which\r\nmirrors the story. The libretto was taken from Victorien Sardou’s _La\r\nTosca_, a celebrated drama in which the “divine Sarah” (Bernhardt) made\r\none of her most brilliant successes.\r\n\r\nHe uses interesting little musical devices which make it easy to\r\nrecognize a Puccini piece, and his music has charm. It is built on\r\nItalian tradition but is distinctly of the 19th century. He enjoyed the\r\ngreatest popularity of his day, and there have been few, excepting\r\nperhaps Verdi and Wagner, whose operas have been so well known. His\r\nbeautiful melody, piquant airs, fine rhythms, clever orchestration and\r\nhumanness of plot, make Puccini very often touch the edge of _opéra\r\ncomique_. Although he uses a musical phrase over and over again, it is\r\nnot like the Wagner _leit-motif_. There are no concerted finales or\r\nclearly defined stopping places as there used to be in earlier operas.\r\nSo you see, Puccini profited by Wagner and Verdi.\r\n\r\nHis _Girl of the Golden West_, a California story of the days of ’49,\r\nhad its world première (first production) at the Metropolitan Opera\r\nHouse (1910). For some time Puccini had been looking for a libretto for\r\na new opera. While in New York, to be present at the Metropolitan\r\nproduction of _Madame Butterfly_, he was also searching for material in\r\nthe hope of finding an American story. Again David Belasco came to his\r\naid. His own _Girl of the Golden West_, a picturesque play, was being\r\ngiven and he invited Puccini to see it. He was interested and turned it\r\ninto an opera. The rehearsals at the Metropolitan were most interesting\r\nwith Puccini and Belasco working together. Emmy Destinn and Caruso sang\r\nthe leading rôles.\r\n\r\nIt is realistic, dramatic, beautiful in parts, and not written for\r\ncoloratura exhibitions! But when it was produced it proved too Italian\r\nfor Americans and too American for the Italians, so Puccini was\r\ndisappointed in its lack of success.\r\n\r\nPuccini’s operas, as well as Verdi’s and others, have a new popularity,\r\nthat of the mechanical player audience, the gramophone and playerpiano.\r\n\r\n\r\n              WOLF-FERRARI AND “THE JEWELS OF THE MADONNA”\r\n\r\nOne of the most delightfully witty opera writers is Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari\r\n(1876), son of a German father and Italian mother, and writer of _The\r\nSecret of Suzanne_ (her secret was that she smoked!) a very droll and\r\namusing story. He is musical grandchild to Mozart, so delicately does he\r\nsketch and so charming is his melody. If you hear his operas, including\r\nthe tragic and exciting but beautiful _The Jewels of the Madonna_, you\r\nwill certainly say that he can make more out of a little, than almost\r\nanyone. With a small orchestra he seems to work miracles, and his\r\nmelodies are gracious and his rhythms captivating.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MONTEMEZZI VISITS AMERICA\r\n\r\nWhether it was Lucrezia Bori (Spanish soprano) or Montemezzi who made\r\n_L’Amore dei Tre Re_ (_The Love of Three Kings_) so entrancing, is hard\r\nto say. Here is lovely music flowing on endlessly! It is rich and deep;\r\nthe voice is handled delightfully, and the orchestration is masterly and\r\nbeautiful throughout. _The Love of Three Kings_ is real music drama and\r\nfew other operas have so fine a libretto.\r\n\r\nMontemezzi with his American wife paid a visit to America (1925) and was\r\nfittingly received at the Metropolitan Opera House where Edward Johnson\r\nand Lucrezia Bori delighted people with the lovely opera.\r\n\r\nSome of the other modern names in Italy are Giovanni Sgambati\r\n(instrumental pieces); Giuseppi Martucci (instrumental pieces); Marco\r\nEnrico Bossi, a famous Italian organist whose visit to this country in\r\n1925 ended tragically, as he died on the boat on his way home, and\r\nBuongiorno, Eugenio di Parani and Franchetti, and Amilcare Ponchielli\r\n(1834–1886), composer of _La Giaconda_.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to what France has done in opera in the second half of\r\nthe 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FRENCH OPERA\r\n\r\nWhen Meyerbeer was musical czar of Paris, we see not only Wagner in\r\nFrance, but six other important composers. Hector Berlioz (1803–1869)\r\nwas a tone poet; Charles Ambroise Thomas (1811–1896), Charles François\r\nGounod (1818–1893), and Georges Bizet (1838–1875) were opera writers;\r\nCharles Camille Saint-Saëus (1835–1921) was a composer of concertos,\r\npiano and chamber music and of one famous opera; and César Franck the\r\nBelgian (1822–1890) who lived in Paris, although not an opera writer,\r\ninfluenced the composers of opera who lived after him.\r\n\r\n_Mignon_ came from the heart of one of these, Ambroise Thomas, winner of\r\nthe _Prix de Rome_, and in 1871 the director of the Paris Conservatory.\r\nHe wrote several works, among them a successful opera _Hamlet_, yet none\r\nhave done as much for his reputation as _Mignon_.\r\n\r\nFélicien David (1810–1876) is known for his symphonic poem _Le Desert_\r\nand his _Laila Rookh_, an opera which was given at the _Opéra Comique_.\r\n\r\nAnother well known name is Benjamin Godard (1849–1895). Do you remember\r\nthe _Berceuse_ from his opera _Jocelyn_? He wrote _Le Dante_ and _La\r\nVivandière_ and many salon pieces for young students of the piano.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GOUNOD’S “FAUST”\r\n\r\n_Faust_, in connection with music, makes us think of Gounod. Gounod was\r\nborn in Paris and showed musical ability when a boy. He was graduated\r\nfrom the Conservatory and won the _Prix de Rome_ (1837).\r\n\r\nHis interest always seemed to be in religious music for he went to Italy\r\nto study Palestrina and Bach. His study resembled a church for it had\r\nstained glass windows and an organ, and furnishings which gave it a\r\nreligious atmosphere. After he returned from Rome he studied for the\r\npriesthood but soon gave it up.\r\n\r\nGounod’s musical training was very broad for at first he was influenced\r\nby Rossini, Weber and Mozart, and later by Bach and Palestrina.\r\n\r\nHis _Messe Solennelle_ (_Solemn Mass_) was given in 1861 and his _Faust_\r\nin 1859. This is considered to be one of the most tuneful operas written\r\nin the 19th century, and packs opera houses all over the world. His\r\n_Romeo and Juliette_, though not as popular is still given and his\r\n_Médecin Malgré Lui_ (_Doctor in Spite of Himself_) (from Molière’s\r\nplay), “is a gem of refined setting” says Clarence Hamilton.\r\n\r\nAmong his other operas are _Philemon and Baucis_, _La Reine de Saba_\r\n(_The Queen of Sheba_) both inferior to _Faust_.\r\n\r\nDuring the Franco-Prussian war he lived in London where he produced his\r\noratorios _The Redemption_ and _Mors et Vita_ (_Death and Life_) with\r\nhis Gounod Choir, and held in England a somewhat similar place to Handel\r\nand Mendelssohn, for he, too, had many disciples.\r\n\r\nHe was a master of beautiful melody and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThere is a new school in Paris whose slogan is, “Back to Gounod” in\r\norder to recapture his way of writing melody!\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EVERYBODY LOVES “CARMEN”\r\n\r\nIn Georges Bizet we see a man of genius who produced but one great work.\r\nTo be sure he lived only thirty-seven years, two years longer than\r\nMozart with his hundreds of pieces, yet Bizet is of great importance in\r\nFrench opera and is looked upon by musicians as a man of rare power, and\r\nhe is loved by everyone for his marvelous _Carmen_. Louis Gruenberg, the\r\nAmerican composer, said, “I have looked in vain for a flaw in _Carmen_\r\nbut it is perfection throughout. It is the one opera in the world that\r\nwins both musicians and the masses alike, and it disarms criticism.”\r\n\r\nEmma Calvé will always be remembered as Carmen, for she not only sang\r\nthe part with its intense melody and Spanish color, but she lived it on\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\nBizet is an amazing orchestral tone painter, and one of the greatest of\r\nall opera writers.\r\n\r\nThe story of _Carmen_ is taken from a novel of Prosper Mérimée and is\r\nfull of the sun, the shadows, the fascinating dances, the bull fight and\r\nthe romance which belong particularly to Spain. _Carmen_ is an _opéra\r\ncomique_, for in the original version as played in Paris it has spoken\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\nHis other things full of charm are _Jeux d’enfants_, four-hand pieces,\r\nthe _Arlesienne Suite_ (dances) so pictureful and emotional. It is used\r\nas ballet sometimes for _Carmen_.\r\n\r\nBizet was not appreciated and at first _Carmen_ was a failure, but many\r\ngeniuses ahead of their time have shared the same fate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After a painting by Giacometti._\r\n\r\n  _Georges Bizet._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Vincent d’Indy._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Camille Saint-Saëns._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Jules Massenet._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Gustave Charpentier._\r\n]\r\n\r\n                _French Composers of the 19th Century._\r\n\r\nIt seems quite reasonable that after all the experiences France has been\r\nthrough in the early and middle 19th century she should now blossom out,\r\nnot with remodelled Italian opera, but with her own opera and her own\r\nways of writing music.\r\n\r\nThe two influences were without doubt from César Franck and Bizet whose\r\nsincerity not only influenced musicians but rather quickly gained the\r\npublic. The third influence was of course, Wagner, who, though he\r\ninfuriated many, gained followers for his theories everywhere that his\r\nmusic was heard. In France, Reyer and Chabrier were both Wagner\r\nenthusiasts and did much to bring him finally into the Paris Opera House\r\na little before the 20th century (adapted from _The Art of Music_). Out\r\nof these influences came a fine group of gifted composers,—d’Indy,\r\nDukas, Charpentier and others.\r\n\r\nErnest Reyer (1823–1909), who was an ardent follower of Wagner, had a\r\nhard time because of the new harmonies he used. His last opera\r\n_Salammbo_ is better known to us than the others, and his works are\r\nstill played in Paris at the Grand Opera.\r\n\r\nA man famous as composer of the tone poem, _España_, Emmanuel Chabrier\r\n(1841–1894) must come in here, for at the time of his death he was\r\nwriting a most interesting opera, _Briseis_, which was finished by his\r\npupils. The day before he died Robert Louis Stevenson stopped in the\r\nmiddle of a sentence, in his novel _The Weir of Hermiston_, one of his\r\nbest. The first woman to receive the _Prix de Rome_ in France, Lili\r\nBoulanger (1892–1918) did much of her composing in bed during her last\r\nillness; her devoted sister Nadia, a prominent musician in Paris, and\r\nhad received the second _Prix de Rome_, finished the deathbed works. And\r\ndid we not see Mozart finishing his _Requiem_ on the last day of his\r\nlife? Illness and impending death seem not to matter to men and women\r\nwho have genius.\r\n\r\nThis group was striking out for something new, and was influenced by\r\nWagner’s theories, Franck’s return to the old classic style, the Russian\r\nschool, the re-action against Wagner and the renewed interest in\r\norchestral concerts in Paris (adapted from C. G. Hamilton).\r\n\r\n\r\n             SAINT-SAËNS—THE CHILD PRODIGY AND OCTOGENARIAN\r\n\r\nCamille Saint-Saëns (1835–1921) wrote in all styles from classic to the\r\nnewest of program music. He is another who gave concerts before he was\r\ntwelve years old; he studied at the Conservatory, lived in Paris as a\r\ncomposer, organist and pianist, was a learned man and a very good\r\nmusical critic. Later in life he lived in Algiers, which accounts for\r\nthe oriental touch in his music. He journeyed over much of the world and\r\nwe heard him in Carnegie Hall, on his last trip to this country in 1915,\r\non his way to the San Francisco exposition where he played the organ and\r\nconducted his opera _Samson and Delilah_. He played some of his most\r\ntechnically difficult pieces when he was in his eighties. He wrote some\r\nsymphonies, some descriptive symphonic poems, _Le Rouet D’Omphale_,\r\n_Phæton_, _Dance Macabre_ (very weird and rhythmic) and others. Out of\r\nfive, his G minor is the most brilliant piano concerto.\r\n\r\nHe is best known for his opera _Samson and Delilah_ which is carried\r\ninto fame by the two arias, _My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice_ and _Love Come\r\nto My Aid_. This last is of the finest lyric writing in French opera and\r\nthe first is surpassingly emotional. The choral parts (often sounding\r\nlike early Hebrew music) show a real master at work, and the effect of\r\nthe whole is very dramatic, whether sung as oratorio or opera.\r\n\r\nIt is not as an opera writer, however, that Saint-Saëns wished to go\r\ndown to history for he threw his whole strength into trying to make the\r\nFrench public know and love the classics. Paul Landormy says: “From the\r\nhistoric point of view, Saint-Saëns is a notable figure. Saint-Saëns is\r\nthe French Mendelssohn.... He undertook the musical education of France\r\nat the exact moment when Berlioz despaired of succeeding with the task,\r\nand he prepared the public for the great French School of symphonists\r\nwhich arose toward the end of the 19th century.”\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Saint-Saëns was made president of the newly formed National\r\nSociety of Music of which you will read later.\r\n\r\nThe ballet was used to advantage by Clement Philibert Léo Délibes\r\n(1836–1891) a master of this form of music and dance. He built up a\r\ncertain atmosphere that is particularly French. His ballets, _Coppelia_\r\nand _Sylvia_ and his opera _Lakmé_ are conventional and very popular.\r\n_Lakmé_ is _opéra comique_ because of the spoken words and of its\r\nromantic character. Délibes always has a certain delicacy of color, and\r\ncharm which captivates.\r\n\r\nAnother composer who writes in an exotic vein (or an\r\nout-of-the-nation-to-which-he-belongs way, with all the color of the\r\nother nation in costumes and scenes) is Edouard Victor Antoine Lalo\r\n(1823–1892). Lalo was trained to sincerity by his models, Beethoven,\r\nSchubert and Schumann. This does not mean copying, for his music is not\r\nanything like the music of these men. He skilfully drew a variety of\r\neffects from his orchestration, and his music has individuality. His\r\nbest known work in opera is _Le Roi d’Ys_. He also wrote a work for\r\nviolin and orchestra _Symphonie Espagnole_ which is a pet of all the\r\nviolinists because of its brilliancy and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MASSENET\r\n\r\nJules Massenet (1842–1912) was something like a modern French Meyerbeer\r\nand an Offenbach combined, yet his work is far more worth while. Before\r\nhe died he was at the height of his popularity in Europe and America,\r\nand the repertory of the Hammerstein Opera in New York included many of\r\nMassenet’s works. He composed operas so rapidly that his public could\r\nnot forget him!\r\n\r\nHe built on Gounod and Ambroise Thomas and gained much from Wagner. He\r\nused continuous melody and some of the principles of the leit-motif.\r\nWagner’s music compared to Massenet’s was thick for Massenet’s is thin!\r\n\r\nWhether Massenet will always remain popular is a question. His operas\r\nare engaging and clever, and he knew how to write theatre music to\r\nplease the public. The most important of his operas (about fifteen), are\r\n_Manon_ and _Le Jongleur de Notre Dame_. The title parts of both were\r\nsung by the brilliant Mary Garden, in this country. (See Chapter VIII.)\r\n_Manon_ ranks second to the _Jongleur_. You know, too, the Meditation\r\nfrom _Thäis_, another of his popular successes. It was written for Sybil\r\nSanderson, an American singer, in Paris. Massenet’s operas did not show\r\nhis tremendous knowledge of counterpoint, of which he was professor at\r\nthe Conservatory. His position was later filled by André Gédalge who has\r\ntaught most of the composers of today. Gédalge is also the composer of\r\nsome very fine symphonies, sonatas and an extraordinary _Treatise on the\r\nFugue_.\r\n\r\nOther writers of this period are Xavier Leroux (1863–1919), Gabriel\r\nPierné, born the same year, composer of a delightful oratorio,\r\n_Children’s Crusade_. He is now conductor of the Colonne Orchestra in\r\nParis. André Messager, born ten years before these two is the composer\r\nof some very charming light operas of which _Veronique_ is the best\r\nknown. There are also the great organists Charles Marie Widor (1845)\r\nwith ten organ symphonies and many other works, and Alexandre Guilmant\r\n(1837–1911), a great organist who came to America while one of the\r\nwriters of this book (Ethel Peyser) was at Vassar College, where he\r\ninaugurated the new organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       FOLLOWERS OF CÉSAR FRANCK\r\n\r\nAlthough César Franck was not a successful opera writer, he influenced\r\ncomposers by showing how to combine modern harmony successfully with the\r\nclassic form.\r\n\r\nAmong the many César Franck’s revival of the classic style influenced\r\nare Gabriel Pierné, Henri Duparc (1848), and Ernest Chausson\r\n(1855–1899), Franck’s pupils. Chausson was first known through _Helen_,\r\na three-act opera and _Le Roi Arthus_, which show what he might have\r\naccomplished had not an accident caused his death. Besides the operas he\r\nwrote beautiful chamber music, orchestral works and songs. His _Poem_\r\nfor violin is full of gentle, yet deep feeling. All his work has veiled\r\nmystery and is very lovely.\r\n\r\nThe most important pupil of César Franck is Vincent d’Indy (1851), one\r\nof the most important figures in France. He founded, with Charles Bordes\r\nand Guilmant, the organist, the _Schola Cantorum_, and revived interest\r\nin sacred music. He has been in this country and is admired for his\r\nsymphonic works, his operas _Fervaal_ and _L’Étranger_ (_The Stranger_),\r\npiano pieces and chamber music. One of his symphonic poems, _Istar_, was\r\nmade into a ballet for Mme. Ida Rubenstein and was performed for the\r\nfirst time at the Grand Opera in Paris, in 1924.\r\n\r\nAlfred Bruneau (1857) links the Wagner period with Debussy’s. His operas\r\nare rarely given outside of Paris. His manner was new and caused much\r\ndiscussion. He based many of his plots on Émile Zola’s writings, and was\r\nconductor of the _Opéra Comique_. _The Attack on the Mill_ was given in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHARPENTIER’S “LOUISE”\r\n\r\nGustav Charpentier (1869) comes next. He made his name with the\r\ndelightful opera about the dressmaker apprentice _Louise_, a musical\r\nnovel on the life in Montmartre, one of the artist quarters of Paris.\r\nCharpentier wrote the book, which was the story of his own life. He also\r\nwrote its sequel _Julien_. No one who has ever been in Paris fails to be\r\ndeeply stirred by this picture of the simple home life of the\r\n_midinette_ or sewing girl. Mary Garden created the part of Louise in\r\nAmerica and it was the first rôle of her operatic career. In one scene,\r\nyou hear the almost forgotten street cries of Paris. He has also written\r\na charming work for orchestra, _Impressions of Italy_, which is the\r\nresult of his having won the _Prix de Rome_ in his youth.\r\n\r\nThis brings us up to the 20th century to which we shall devote an entire\r\nchapter. But in order to finish our story of French opera, we will\r\nmerely introduce you to Claude Achille Debussy, the ultra-modern\r\nharmonist and weaver of mystery and beauty, who ushered in the 20th\r\ncentury with his lovely and enchanting opera, _Pelleas and Melisande_\r\nwritten on the play by Maurice Maeterlinck. For ten years the composer\r\nworked over this masterpiece, and it was produced for the first time at\r\nthe _Opéra Comique_, in Paris in 1902. Here we find something that never\r\nhad been before,—opera completely separated from all the old ideas of\r\nwhat opera should be. But in tearing down the old, Debussy gave\r\nsomething very rare, beautiful, sensitive, touching a very high artistic\r\npeak, in its place. This was pure impressionism in music, just what\r\nromanticism was to the early 19th century. This carries the French\r\nSchool to its highest degree of mystic beauty.\r\n\r\nComing later than Debussy’s opera are Maurice Ravel’s _L’Heure\r\nEspagnole_ (_The Spanish Hour_), Henri Rabaud’s _Marouf_, Paul Dukas’\r\n_Ariane et Barbe Bleue_, also a Maeterlinck libretto and second only to\r\n_Pelleas and Melisande_ in atmospheric charm, Albert Roussel’s\r\n_Padmavati_, an Oriental opera, that has been produced very recently at\r\nthe Grand Opera in Paris, and Florent Schmitt’s _Le Petit Elfe Ferme\r\nl’Oeil_ (_The little elf winks its eye_) presented at the _Opéra\r\nComique_ in 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HUMPERDINCK—THE FAIRY TALE MAN—GERMANY\r\n\r\nOutside of the operas of Richard Strauss, of which we have written\r\nelsewhere, there have been few outstanding opera writers in Germany\r\nsince Wagner. Among those are Ludwig Thuille (1861–1907), whose\r\n_Lobetanz_ was given at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1911; Eugene\r\nd’Albert (1864), who has lived in Germany most of his life, although he\r\nwas born in Scotland, and wrote the lovely _Tiefland_ which was\r\nperformed in America; Max Schillings (1868), whose _Mona Lisa_ was\r\nperformed at the Metropolitan; Hans Pfitzner (1869), who wrote an\r\noperatic legend based on Palestrina; Siegfried Wagner (1869), son of\r\nRichard; and Leo Blech (1871).\r\n\r\nThe one great exception was Engelbert Humperdinck (1854–1921), born in\r\nBonn, Beethoven’s birthplace. He is perhaps closer to the hearts of\r\nchildren than any one else who ever wrote music. This seems much to say,\r\nbut when you hear that it was he who wrote that beautiful little fairy\r\nstory _Hansel and Gretel_, we are sure you will agree. The San Carlo\r\nOpera Company has given special performances of it in English. Would it\r\nnot be nice if operas were given in the language you best understand?\r\nYou would then find out for yourselves that this is the story of _Babes\r\nin the Woods_. How fine it would have been too, if you had been able to\r\nhear in your own language the other opera written by Humperdinck! This\r\nwas _Koenigskinder_ (_Children of the King_), which gave one of the\r\nloveliest rôles to Geraldine Farrar, and brought a large flock of real\r\ngeese on the stage to take part in the performance. The other name of\r\nthe opera is _The Goose-Girl_, which explains the presence of the geese.\r\nGeraldine Farrar always brought one or two with her when she\r\nacknowledged the applause and there was always an awful squawk! In this\r\nopera too, there is a horrid old Witch. Humperdinck found joy and\r\ninspiration in the folk music of Germany, much of which deals with\r\nfairies, elves, witches and inhabitants of the world of imagination.\r\n\r\nHumperdinck was a great musician and he had the honor of being asked to\r\nprepare the score of _Parsifal_ for the publishers.\r\n\r\nBecause of the beauties of his melodies, the lovely subjects he selected\r\nand his sympathy with the finer and higher things of life, it is a pity\r\nthat Humperdinck left so few works.\r\n\r\nHe was attracted to the theatre and wrote much music as theatre music\r\nfor plays. This is called incidental music, that is, it is incidental\r\nand the play’s the thing! Just before he died Humperdinck wrote the\r\nincidental music for the _Miracle_ which is a great spectacle in\r\npantomime. This means that there is no speaking, only tableaux and\r\nacting. He did not live to finish it, but it was completed by his son,\r\nfor the production made by Max Reinhardt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n                            Some Tone Poets\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably you think that any music on a program is program music! Of\r\ncourse it is, but not in the special use of the word, for when it is\r\nprogram music, it has a story of its own and has to be described in more\r\nor less detail so that the audience can understand what it is about.\r\nTherefore, we find two classes of music—_absolute music_, which needs no\r\nstory to explain it, and—_program music_, which does. Beethoven’s best\r\nworks are known by their opus number while most of Schumann’s have\r\ndescriptive titles. Early composers sometimes wrote music describing or\r\nimitating something, like Daquin’s _Cuckoo_, Jannequin’s _Battle of\r\nMarignan_, _The Carman’s Whistle_, etc. These pieces were program music\r\nin a way, but the modern tone poets went further by writing music with\r\nrather extended stories and with music not as simple as it used to be,\r\nbut nevertheless an outgrowth of ballad form, sonata and the symphony.\r\n\r\nSuppose you wanted to write a tone poem! First you must have a subject\r\nand then you must write music to explain it. Let us say you were going\r\nto write a Subway Tone Poem, your program notes might read something\r\nlike this: The hero rushes away from his office, into the hurrying,\r\nscurrying street, down the slippery, crowded subway steps, and when he\r\nreaches the noisy turnstile slips in his fare and meets his young lady.\r\nHe leads her through the crowd, protecting her from the jostling mob.\r\nThen they enter the train and above the noise and bustle they cast sweet\r\nglances at each other and converse. The train stops occasionally and\r\nfinally they get off at their station. They walk to her home, along an\r\nempty side street where it is quiet and charming. He doffs his cap and\r\nwe leave them, both thinking lovely things about each other.\r\n\r\nDon’t you think you’re ready now to write a tone poem?\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BERLIOZ, INNOVATOR\r\n\r\nUp to Hector Berlioz’ time (1803–1869), there was no definite attempt to\r\nwrite a tone poem with an elaborate story. This man, one of the most\r\ncomplicated in musical history, did much to help music and future\r\nmusicians, for he started to tell stories in music without scenery or\r\ndialogues.\r\n\r\nHe was born near Lyons, France, the son of a doctor who wanted him to\r\nstudy medicine, but as he almost fainted several times in the dissecting\r\nroom, he gave it up. This was his first rebellion and all his life he\r\nstruggled against nearly everything that existed. His was a noble\r\ndiscontent in many ways, for he believed deeply in his own ideas and\r\nsuffered much putting them into practice. He lived shortly after the\r\nFrench Revolution when everything was topsy-turvy. Many of the old\r\nthings that people had looked upon with reverence had vanished and he\r\ntried, as other young men of his day, to forge new ideas according to\r\nhis sense of right.\r\n\r\nOne day he saw some musical score paper and realized in a moment, what\r\nwonderful things might be done with it and exclaimed: “What an\r\norchestral work one might write on that!” and quite suddenly, he decided\r\nto write music! He could only play the guitar, the flute and the\r\nflageolet and knew practically nothing of harmony. He certainly paid\r\nwell for his decision, for he had a hard struggle with himself and\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nHe took one of his compositions to Professor Lesueur at the Paris\r\nConservatory, and was admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BERLIOZ VERSUS CHERUBINI\r\n\r\nCherubini, Director of the Conservatory, made a rule that men and women\r\nshould use separate doors leading into the library. Not knowing this\r\nrule, Berlioz entered by the door reserved for the women and sat down to\r\nread a score of his beloved Gluck. Cherubini, thin, pale-faced, with\r\ntousled hair and fiercely shining eyes, came up to Hector and\r\nreprimanded him for breaking the rule. They had a noisy fight, chasing\r\nin and out among the desks and when Berlioz reached the door, he looked\r\nback at Cherubini and called out: “I am soon coming back to study Gluck\r\nagain.” Being a determined boy, he did come back, but Cherubini, on whom\r\nhis future depended, was his staunch enemy for life.\r\n\r\nHis parents were infuriated with Hector for his conduct in and out of\r\nschool. His mother, a pious woman, practically disowned him and his\r\nfather gave him but a small allowance with the stipulation that unless\r\nhe could soon prove his ability in music, he should have to go back to\r\nmedicine. So he tried desperately to earn money, by singing in choruses,\r\nplaying the flute and teaching, hoping that he could win the _Prix de\r\nRome_, which would give him a few years in Rome and three thousand\r\nfrancs. After terrific opposition by Cherubini and held back, too, by\r\nhis own lack of diplomacy, either by submitting works that were written\r\ntoo poorly or too well, he lost many chances for the prize and finally,\r\nafter four attempts, he won the coveted award with his cantata\r\n_Sardanapalus_. The amusing thing about this is, that he left out the\r\nparts then looked upon as modern, and difficult, which would have lost\r\nhim the prize, but the first time it was played in public, he put them\r\nall in, and the piece was successful.\r\n\r\nThen he fell in love, and after much posing and strutting about and\r\nfoolish behavior, he married the young Irish actress, Harriet Smithson.\r\nThey were very unhappy and unfortunate, but he was good to her and even\r\ngave up composing to earn a living by writing, and he proved an\r\nexceptionally gifted writer and critic.\r\n\r\nHis autobiography, too, is most interesting for he sees himself as a\r\nromantic hero and tells the tale with great dramatic energy and\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WITH INTENT TO MURDER!\r\n\r\nAt one time he was engaged to another woman who was unkind to him and he\r\nwrote: “Two tears of rage started from my eyes and my mind was made up\r\non the spot to kill without mercy.” But being impetuous and quick\r\ntempered, he never reached the scene of murder, for, when about to sail\r\nto where she was, he either fell or jumped into the water, which very\r\nmuch dampened his ardor for killing.\r\n\r\nOne night, Chopin and Schumann followed him because he had threatened to\r\nkill himself. But, at the crucial moment Berlioz changed his mind!\r\n\r\nLife for Berlioz was a drama in which he was the leading man, and he\r\nwatched his own performance, as if he were a part of the audience. He\r\ncraved novelty at every turn. He was sensitive, high-strung and vain,\r\nand yet withal, he had the dignity of being loyal to his beliefs in\r\nhimself, and did not want to deceive anybody. He wrote with humor,\r\nbrilliancy and understanding, he had faith in his work, and was\r\nsufficiently heroic to stick to his course whatever the cost. He was a\r\nmartyr, for he suffered in order to do what he wished in music, and was\r\nnever appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlthough he went to England, Germany, Austria and Russia, and was very\r\nsuccessful, Paris, only, interested him. In 1863, his opera _The Trojans\r\nin Carthage_ failed and in 1868, he died, a broken-hearted man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BERLIOZ’S CONTRIBUTION TO MUSIC\r\n\r\nIt seems strange, but Berlioz disliked Bach and Palestrina and worshiped\r\nBeethoven, Gluck and Weber. He was jealous of Wagner and did everything\r\nhe could to make _Tannhäuser_ a failure in Paris.\r\n\r\nBerlioz invented new ways, as do our Jazz Bands today, to make the\r\ninstruments produce different sounds. He put bags over the horns, hung\r\nup the cymbals and had them struck with sticks instead of clapping them\r\ntogether, dressed up the drumsticks in sponges, and was much pleased at\r\nthe effect made when a trombone played a duet with a piccolo. He made\r\npropaganda for new instruments especially for the horn, invented by\r\nAdolphe Saxe, which was called Sax Horn, and from which descended the\r\nSaxophone, so behold Berlioz, the founder of the Jazz Band!\r\n\r\nWhere other composers would use four trombones or one, he used sixteen!\r\nIn his _Requiem_ for example, he used sixteen trombones, twelve\r\nophicleides (cornets with extra levers or keys), eight pairs of kettle\r\ndrums, two bass drums, a gong and of course, all the regular string and\r\nreed instruments. He boasted after the first performance, that a man had\r\na fit from the excessive noise!\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE INTIMATE FRIEND OF INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nHe wrote the sort of melody that showed off each particular instrument\r\nto its best advantage. He studied them as if they were human beings, and\r\nhe understood their characters and temperaments, what they could do and\r\nat what they would balk. He showed the possibilities of the choirs of\r\nwood wind instruments, a rich heritage for us today. The orchestra\r\nplaying a piece of his, directed by him was matchless in its effect.\r\n_Effect_ was the keynote of his writings. As the first great master of\r\ntonal effect, he is unsurpassed, and his book on orchestration is still\r\none of the most practical text books on the subject.\r\n\r\nBerlioz used the _idée fixe_ (fixed idea) or _leit-motif_, not as Wagner\r\nused it later, but quite definitely, twisting a theme in many ways to\r\nbring out different phases of the same subject. Thus, Berlioz founded\r\nthe dramatic in music, without scenery and without words, which is the\r\nSymphonic Tone Poem.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the people did not understand him any more than they\r\nunderstand Stravinsky today. His greatest work was his _Symphony\r\nFantastic_ written in 1829, in which he used the _idée fixe_ to tell\r\nabout the life of the artist, in true program music style for which he\r\nfought and almost bled. In _Harold in Italy_, he makes a departure by\r\ngiving to the viola, the rôle of the “leading lady” which had not been\r\ndone up to his day. He often used voices with the orchestra as he did in\r\nhis tone poems _Romeo and Juliet_, and _The Damnation of Faust_.\r\n\r\nThe noisy _Requiem_ is one of the finest things he did, and his\r\novertures, the best of which is the _Benvenuto Cellini_, are fine works.\r\nThe oratorio, _The Infancy of Christ_, written in classic style, was\r\nwell received, but his operas never succeeded.\r\n\r\nHe paved the way for new orchestral effects and prepared the ground for\r\nFranz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, and all the other\r\norchestral composers. He was a musical Byron, for he was more\r\ninteresting than beautiful, more vivid than noble, a sincere _poseur_,\r\nfaithful to his ideas and always searching for romance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Hector Berlioz._\r\n\r\n  (_Father of the Tone Poem._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Franz Liszt._\r\n\r\n  _Sympathetic Teacher, Composer, Pianist and Friend to Young\r\n    Musicians._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe was well versed in literature, always carried Virgil in his pocket,\r\nand loved and admired Shakespeare, Goethe, Byron, Walter Scott and other\r\ngreat writers on whose works he based many compositions. In his\r\nfascinating autobiography, he said, “The dominant qualities of my music\r\nare passionate expression, internal fire, rhythmic animation and\r\nunexpected change,” and he was right.\r\n\r\nAnd so we leave this romantic man, craving sensation in his life and in\r\nhis music, exaggerated in word and tone, and thank him for what Daniel\r\nGregory Mason calls, “His contribution to the unresting progress of\r\nart.”\r\n\r\nHe was not appreciated in Paris until after his death, and some one said\r\nthat the stones hurled at him in contempt were soon piled up for him in\r\nthe pedestals of his monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FRANZ LISZT\r\n\r\nAnother Mozart seems about to appear, for Franz Liszt (1811–1886), too,\r\nwas an infant prodigy!\r\n\r\nHe was born in Raiding, Hungary, and his father, Adam Liszt, who was\r\nsteward to Prince Esterhazy, gave Franz piano lessons and managed his\r\nfirst concert tours.\r\n\r\nAt nine Liszt played in public, then went to Vienna and took lessons\r\nfrom Carl Czerny and Salieri. When twelve years old he played in Paris\r\nand “set the world on fire” with his brilliancy. Some one said that\r\nafter his first concert that he had a triumphal progress to fame over\r\nthe laps of great ladies, for he was petted and “bon-bonned” and kissed\r\nby all.\r\n\r\nLiszt wanted to go to the Conservatory in Paris, but as he was a\r\nforeigner, Cherubini, though a foreigner himself, would not admit him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ADVERTISING LISZT\r\n\r\nHere is a handbill used for advertising the little boy Liszt:\r\n\r\n                                 “AN AIR”\r\n\r\n  With grand Variations by Herz, will be performed on Erard’s New\r\n  Patent-Grand Pianoforte, by:\r\n\r\n                               MASTER LISZT\r\n\r\n  Who will likewise perform an Extempore Fantasia and respectfully\r\n  requests two written Themes from any of the Audience upon which he\r\n  will play his Variations\r\n\r\nThis illustrates two interesting things. The first, the mention of the\r\n_grand pianoforte_, which had not been in use very long; the second, the\r\nfashion in Liszt’s day of improvising before an audience, a “stunt”\r\nalmost like solving a cross-word puzzle without a dictionary!\r\n\r\nFor a long time, he was advertised as two years younger than he was, and\r\nhis father carried him to the piano; but he soon rebelled at this\r\npretense and it was discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LISZT SHOWS HIS UNSELFISHNESS\r\n\r\nAfter Liszt’s father died in 1827, he gave up concert tours for a while,\r\nand settled down with his mother for eight restful years to study and\r\nteach the piano. Liszt generously gave his mother all the money he had\r\nmade in his successful tours because, he said, she had made so many\r\nsacrifices for him. At this time he grew spiritually deeper and well\r\nfitted for the glories to come. Like Berlioz, Liszt was born a short\r\ntime after the French Revolution, when new ideas were coming into\r\nliterature, religion and art, through which this young and gifted artist\r\ntried to guide himself in a wholesome way that shaped his future life.\r\n\r\nLiszt again made concert tours through Europe (1839), and astounded\r\neveryone with his playing and the charm of his personality. Musicians\r\nand audiences were at his feet! He made a great deal of money, too, and\r\ngrew so popular that artists painted him, ladies knelt before him in\r\nadoration, tableaux were given in his honor, monuments erected to him\r\nand societies named after him.\r\n\r\nHis kindness to the poor and needy was unfailing. When Pesth was\r\ninundated by a flood, he sent a generous gift to the sufferers; he\r\nestablished a fund for the poor in Raiding and completed the necessary\r\nsum for the Beethoven monument at Bonn. He never accepted money for\r\nteaching after he was “grown up” for he wanted to be a help to his some\r\nthree hundred pupils. It is said that after 1847 he never gave a concert\r\nfor his own benefit! An extraordinary character!\r\n\r\nIn 1843, he went to Weimar, as a visiting artist. Soon he met Princess\r\nVon Sayn Wittgenstein of Russia who realized his great gifts and\r\ninfluenced him to become more than a pianist. Later in the year we see\r\nhim as Choir Master living at Weimar and attracting the greatest people\r\nof the musical world to him. Here Liszt was able to help young musicians\r\nwho came from all over the world. Wagner would never have been so\r\nsuccessful, had not Liszt aided him during his exile. He stood by him\r\nwith patience and loving kindness and helped him to produce his operas.\r\nHe was of untold assistance to Schumann and Berlioz, Rubinstein,\r\nCornelius and countless others by performing their works when nobody\r\nelse dared to. Liszt was in high favor with society, and having a love\r\nfor the new in music, he used his popularity to help music grow. Wagner\r\nhimself said: “At the end of my last stay in Paris, when ill, broken\r\ndown and despairing, I sat brooding over my fate, my eye fell on the\r\nscore of my _Lohengrin_, totally forgotten by me. Suddenly I felt\r\nsomething like compassion that this music should never sound from off\r\nthe death-pale paper. I wrote two lines to Liszt; his answer was the\r\nnews that preparations for the performance were being made on the\r\nlargest scale the limited means of Weimar would permit.” Liszt’s motto\r\nwas, “First Place to the Living.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LISZT’S PROFESSIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\nLiszt’s services were demanded for concerts and festivals in many towns\r\nfrom 1852–1859. The people, however, could not understand how their idol\r\ncould believe in Wagner and Berlioz, and there were many rabid\r\ndiscussions. Very soon Liszt brought out his own symphonic poems,\r\n_Tasso_, _Prometheus_, _Mazeppa_, _Les Preludes_, and his two piano\r\nconcertos (1855–1857), utilizing his romantic ideas.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Weimar, which some biographers claim was because of the\r\nadverse criticism of Cornelius’ opera, _The Barber of Bagdad_, Liszt\r\nwent to Rome. Here his deep mystical nature and his need for rest and\r\ntime for contemplation, led him to enter one of the Holy Orders of the\r\nChurch, and the Pope gave him the honorary title of Abbé. Pope Pius IX\r\nadored him and called him his Palestrina. The church music which he\r\ncomposed there included his oratorios _St. Elizabeth_, _The Christus_,\r\nhis unfinished _Stanislaus_, the _Hungarian Coronation Mass_ and the\r\n_Requiem_.\r\n\r\nLiszt returned to Weimar every spring and summer and conducted many\r\nfestivals and concerts, including the Beethoven centenary. He was also\r\nmuch interested in the National Academy at Pesth, so now he divided his\r\ntime between Rome, Pesth, and Weimar.\r\n\r\nHe wrote many brilliant piano pieces, among them his nineteen remarkable\r\nHungarian Rhapsodies based on the melodies he heard from the gypsies.\r\nBesides composing music, teaching and helping other musicians and giving\r\nto the needy, he wrote essays and criticisms.\r\n\r\nIn appearance Liszt was tall and thin with deep-set eyes and bushy\r\neyebrows and a mouth which turned up at the corners when he smiled. His\r\ncharm of manner won all who came in contact with him.\r\n\r\nA story is told of him that he as a youth was sitting to the artist\r\nScheffer for his portrait, and fell into a theatrical pose, probably\r\nwith his head thrown back and one hand thrust into the breast of his\r\nbuttoned coat, which was characteristic. As this did not impress the\r\npainter, Liszt, realizing it, cried with much embarrassment, “Forgive,\r\ndear master, but you do not know how it spoils one to have been an\r\ninfant prodigy.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of Liszt’s outward affectation and posing, he had a noble\r\ncharacter. He was simple and whole-souled, free from jealousy and the\r\nlove of money. He died highly honored in 1886 at the age of seventy-five\r\nat a Wagner festival in Bayreuth. In fact it was difficult to tell who\r\nreceived more honor at Bayreuth, Liszt in the audience or Wagner at the\r\nconductor’s desk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LISZT’S ACCOMPLISHMENTS\r\n\r\nAs a pianist, no one has surpassed Liszt and he revealed the piano’s\r\npossibilities. In addition to his pianoforte compositions, he made\r\n“arrangements” of symphonies, chorals, operas, songs and every other\r\nform, which brought them closer to the people. His arrangements are so\r\nbrilliant, although over-decorated and cheap in effect, that he shows\r\nthat the piano can almost reproduce the orchestra.\r\n\r\nLiszt was not as great a composer as he was a pianist and stimulator of\r\nother musicians, and much of his music was written for effect. Yet he\r\nwas a great critic and his love of music for the future rather than of\r\nthe past, led him to be sympathetic with young composers, for whom he\r\nopened the way. The people who gathered about him disliked old forms and\r\nwere looking for new music in which he encouraged them. Among the\r\nmusicians who were friends and pupils at Weimar, were: Joseph Joachim\r\nRaff, Peter Cornelius, Eduard Lassen, who took Liszt’s place when he\r\nleft Weimar, Leopold Damrosch, the father of Walter and Frank Damrosch\r\nof New York, Alexander Ritter, the pianist and inspirer of so many great\r\npeople, and hundreds of others.\r\n\r\nLiszt wrote many symphonic and choral pieces which showed marked\r\noriginality. Although not as profound as Wagner, he helped Wagner so\r\nmuch that their names would be forever linked, even if his daughter\r\nCosima had not been Wagner’s wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RUBINSTEIN AND VON BÜLOW\r\n\r\nAmong other friends of Liszt of value to musical history were Anton\r\nRubinstein (1829–1894) (page 443), the Russian, and Hans von Bülow\r\n(1830–1894), a German. Both these men were great pianists and wrote\r\nnoteworthy compositions. Liszt was a great stimulus to them and they had\r\nmany points in common. Rubinstein was romantic and von Bülow, classic.\r\nRubinstein did much to link Germany and Russia musically, which was a\r\nhelp to both nations. Von Bülow was an illustrious pianist, friend of\r\nWagner, famous conductor, and editor of many musical scores, among them\r\nan edition of Beethoven’s Sonatas, still in constant use. Both these men\r\ndid much for pianists all over Europe.\r\n\r\nOther great pianists and composers of their day were: Nikolai Rubinstein\r\n(Anton’s brother) (1835–1881); Theodor Leschetizky (1830–1915), trained\r\nby Carl Czerny, and he in turn trained hundreds of pianists; Karl Tausig\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\nOf course, the effect of these pianists was to make music and the piano\r\nmore popular, thus adding greatly to the musical culture of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TCHAIKOVSKY\r\n\r\nYou probably know of Piotr (Peter) Ilyitch Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) as a\r\ngreat symphony writer, but he was also a successful writer of tone poems\r\nsuch as _The Tempest_, _Francesco di Rimini_, _Manfred_, based on\r\nByron’s _Manfred_, _Hamlet_, _The Storm_, _Romeo and Juliet_ and two\r\nincomplete poems, _Destiny_ and _Voievoda_. Tchaikovsky was born in\r\nRussia, he went to the school of Jurisprudence and later entered the\r\nMinistry of Justice but soon began to compose music and took a medal for\r\ncomposition for a piece which he wrote on Schiller’s _Ode to Joy_, the\r\npoem Beethoven used in his 9th Symphony. He also wrote _The Nut Cracker_\r\nSuite for orchestra, adapted from the score of a Ballet, which includes\r\na Russian dance, an Arab dance, a Chinese dance, flower waltz, and other\r\nfascinating, whirling, delightful dances.\r\n\r\nMany of Tchaikovsky’s things not called tone poems have very definite\r\nprograms, such as _The Snow Maiden_ (_Snegovrotchka_) a favorite legend\r\nand music to a fairy tale—the parts are named _Chorus of Blind Gusslee\r\nPlayers_, _Monologue of the Frosts_, _Appearance of the Wood Demons_ and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SERGEI RACHMANINOV\r\n\r\nBoecklin’s painting _Isle of Death_, inspired Sergei Rachmaninov (1873)\r\nto write a most beautiful musical poem about its sombre trees and the\r\nsea. As a distinguished pianist he has glorified the art in all\r\ncountries, especially in America. He was a student of Siloti and of\r\nZvierev, a friend of Tchaikovsky. His masters in harmony and theory were\r\nTaneiev and Arensky. He has held musical posts of honor and has written\r\nremarkable piano concertos, chamber music works, choruses and one opera,\r\n_Aleko_. You probably know his much played C minor Prelude which has\r\nbeen a sort of visiting card of Rachmaninov to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 RICHARD STRAUSS, THE PROTEUS OF MUSIC\r\n\r\nIn the list of tone poets, Richard Strauss (1864), or Richard II is one\r\nof the most important. It is strange that he should have the same name\r\nas Wagner, for his father Franz Strauss, a skilled horn player, disliked\r\nWagner and his compositions intensely. Richard’s mother was the daughter\r\nof a brewer and they all lived in Munich, where the son was born.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a little boy, he wrote musical notes before he could write\r\nthe alphabet, and at six, composed little pieces. By the time he was\r\ntwenty he had written compositions which put him with Schubert and\r\nMozart, in the ranks of musical prodigies.\r\n\r\nUntil his sixteenth work _Aus Italien_ (_From Italy_) (1886), his first\r\ntone poem, he did not depart from the classic forms, although there were\r\na few signs of change in style in a violin sonata which he wrote just\r\nbefore the tone poem. In fact, he was so much against Wagner and his\r\ninnovations, that no one could have guessed that later he himself would\r\nbe considered an innovator and would be accused of imitating Wagner.\r\n\r\nDuring his youth, after hearing _Siegfried_ he wrote to a friend about\r\nthe music of Mime: “It would have killed a cat and the horror of musical\r\ndissonances would melt rocks into omelettes.”\r\n\r\nWhen he met von Bülow, the old master thought little of his talents, but\r\nthe young man gave him a surprise. For, when Richard went to Meiningen\r\nhe had never led an orchestra in his life and without one rehearsal,\r\nconducted his _Serenade for Strings_, opus 7. Von Bülow realized his\r\ngreat ability, made him assistant conductor, and a year later when he\r\nleft Meiningen, Strauss took his place.\r\n\r\nIt was about now that Richard met Alexander Ritter the violinist and\r\nradical thinker who, he said, changed his life by introducing to him new\r\nideas. He became converted to Wagner. When he heard _Tristan and Isolde_\r\nhe was thrilled by it. So, like Proteus, the god who changed his form to\r\nsuit his adventure, Strauss, the musical Proteus changed his ideas to\r\nsuit his opinions.\r\n\r\nWearied by hard work after writing many classical pieces including a\r\nsonata, an overture, the _Festmarsch_, a violin concerto, songs, a horn\r\nconcerto and other things, he became very ill. He said to a friend that\r\nhe was ready to die, and then added, “No, before I do, I should love to\r\nconduct _Tristan_.” This shows that the young man could change his\r\nopinion and become devoted to what he loathed years before, a fine\r\nquality which continually brought down upon his head criticism from\r\nsmaller folk. Yet this Proteus-like quality was a sign of his power for\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nBecause he did not gain strength quickly from his illness, he went to\r\nItaly and then wrote his first symphonic poem _Aus Italien_ (_From\r\nItaly_) in a new and modern vein.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, he led the orchestra in the Court Theatre of Munich\r\nand then went to Weimar for two years, and this former young classicist\r\nwas now hailed as the leader of modern composers! He produced, here,\r\nthree tone poems: _Macbeth_, _Don Juan_ and _Tod und Verklärung_ (_Death\r\nand Transfiguration_) (1888–1890).\r\n\r\nThen, on account of illness (1892) he went to Greece, Egypt and Sicily.\r\nDuring this tour, he wrote _Guntram_, which he produced on his return to\r\nWeimar.\r\n\r\nHe became interested in the Bayreuth festivals and in 1894 he conducted\r\na production of _Tannhäuser_, after which he married Pauline de Ana who\r\nplayed Elizabeth. Before this, he had made her the heroine of his first\r\nopera, _Guntram_ (1893).\r\n\r\nNot long after this he gave up the Weimar post and went to Munich with\r\nhis bride. He became the conductor there and at the same time, led the\r\nBerlin Philharmonic concerts until the double work and commuting became\r\ntoo much for him. He gave up Berlin and Arthur Nikisch succeeded\r\nhim,—the same Arthur Nikisch who later took the baton of the Boston\r\nSymphony Orchestra in America.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 he became the leader of the Royal Opera in Berlin in which city\r\nhe decided to live and from there made trips all over the world\r\nincluding the United States, first in 1904 and later, after the World\r\nWar. During his last tour, we heard him play the piano for his songs\r\nwhich are unsurpassed in beauty, and conduct some of his own orchestral\r\nworks with skill and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHe is tall and slender, with kindly blue eyes, rather informal in\r\nmanner. He has the air of a happy man even if he has received some of\r\nthe harshest criticism from friends and foes that any composer has had\r\nfrom earliest times. His wife used to sing his songs in public. He is\r\nfond of games, especially the card game “skat” and like the true\r\ngrandson of a brewer enjoys his glass of beer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    STRAUSS’S CONTRIBUTION TO MUSIC\r\n\r\nAmong Strauss’ greatest works are his operas _Electra_, _Salome_ and\r\n_Der Rosenkavalier_ and his nine tone poems. Despite all the harsh\r\nthings critics have said of him, Strauss has always maintained that,\r\nalthough he did not write in accepted forms, he felt that the form\r\nshould always be suitable to the subject, for “as moods and ideas change\r\nso must forms.” This, Ernest Newman said in defence of Strauss, and it\r\nmay be applied to all arts.\r\n\r\nSo Strauss is not formless but like Proteus, has many forms. Cecil Gray\r\nsaid, “he seems to have an irresistible itch to provoke the amazement\r\nand the horror of the multitude.” This is quite true, especially in\r\n_Salome_, _Electra_ and _Der Rosenkavalier_ in which opera he went back\r\nto Mozart form as a model. It seems incredible that a man who could\r\nwrite the noble songs that he has written should have chosen such\r\nunpleasant plots for his operas!\r\n\r\nIn _Tod und Verklärung_ (_Death and Transfiguration_) he was distinctly\r\na follower of Liszt. His friend Alexander Ritter is said to have written\r\nthe poem after the music.\r\n\r\nAt the time that it was first played, it caused so much comment that\r\nStrauss, like Browning, laughed at people for trying to “read” more into\r\nit than he wrote. Browning was asked whether he meant a certain thing in\r\none of his poems, and his reply was something like this: “Madam, I never\r\nthought of it, but if you think it is there, I am more than glad to know\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nHis _Don Juan_ is delightful, too, but his _Til Eulenspiegel_ (1895)\r\nwhich tells of the mischievous pranks of Til, is one of the finest\r\nexamples of _humor_ in music and probably will outlive many works of\r\nthis modern period, his own as well as others. He wrote it in the form\r\nof a classical Rondo, because he could picture Til’s ever recurring\r\ndeviltry and exploits in this form. Poor Strauss was reviled for this\r\ndaringly written music, too, yet this tone poem is an amazing piece of\r\nwork and was given gloriously as a ballet in New York City a few years\r\nago by Diaghilev’s Russian Ballet.\r\n\r\nIn _Also Sprach Zarathustra_ (_Thus Spake Zarathustra_), Strauss uses\r\nthe _idée fixe_ or _leit-motif_. This is based on a prose poem of\r\nNietzsche.\r\n\r\nIn _Don Quixote_ he goes back to the form of the classical variation,\r\nfor it is an ingenious way of showing the varying sides of the character\r\nof Don Quixote. Here he shows events and not ideas, a most definite\r\nstory in tones. You can almost see the attack on the wind-mills and you\r\ncan actually hear the sheep bleating, the church music of passing\r\npilgrims, and the love tale of Dulcinea. In this piece, program music\r\nreaches its height.\r\n\r\nIn _Ein Heldenleben_ (_A Hero’s Life_) (1898) Strauss frankly quotes\r\nfrom his musical works. He does not have to prove that he is the hero,\r\nfor he admits it! When Strauss was asked what the poem meant, he said,\r\n“There is no need of a program, it is enough to know that there is a\r\nhero fighting his enemies.” In it, you can really hear the carping\r\ncritics, his retorts, the triumphs and the defeats. It is very\r\ninteresting and amazingly well written.\r\n\r\nThe _Domestic Symphony_ (_Sinfonia Domestica_) is the story of a family\r\nfor one day. There is the father motif, the mother motif and the baby\r\nmotif! The final fugue represents education very aptly for you get from\r\nit the sense of flight and struggle and the never endingness of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nOne of his last works is _The Alpine Symphony_. His other works include\r\nan early opera _Feuersnoth_, and his songs which are among the greatest\r\never written by any composer, ranking him with Franz, Schubert,\r\nSchumann, Brahms and Hugo Wolf.\r\n\r\nStrauss shows in all his work great pictorial power. He paints in tones\r\nif ever a man does. His humor in music is amazing. He tries to make\r\nvivid in music a thing as simple as a fork and as complex as a\r\nphilosophic idea. Some one said of him, comparing him to Wagner, that he\r\nstarted out to write symphonic poems and really wrote music dramas,\r\nwhile Wagner started out to write music dramas and ended by writing\r\n_Tristan and Isolde_, a super-symphonic poem with voices added.\r\n\r\nRichard Strauss is the last of the great German classic and romantic\r\ncomposers who have ruled the musical world for the past two centuries.\r\nStill living in Germany he has opened the way to many of the younger\r\ncomposers, who have learned much from his methods of orchestration and\r\nhandling music in the large forms. While he out-Wagnered Wagner in\r\nstrange and new harmony, he now seems old fashioned in comparison to\r\nSchoenberg, Stravinsky and Honegger. Although Strauss seemed to us very\r\ncomplex and exaggerated a few years ago, it was very interesting to\r\nnotice that when his works were revived in America after the War, the\r\naudiences had grown up musically to the point where they seemed no\r\nlonger unintelligible or ultra-modern.\r\n\r\nWe remember when we were leaving the opera house after the first\r\nperformance of _Salome_ in this country, hearing one ill bred, untutored\r\nwoman say, “Gee! Goit, but that was one big noise!” By this time she has\r\nprobably reached the point where she is jazzing the Salome dance with\r\nreal pleasure and understanding!\r\n\r\nHe did many unusual things with instruments, added many new ones, and as\r\nsomeone said, he loves to have the “trombone play like a piccolo!”\r\n\r\nNo one can say where Strauss will stand as a composer, for time alone\r\ncan place him. However, we make bold to state that he will stand high in\r\nthe company of the world’s composers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHABRIER (1841–1894)\r\n\r\nAs imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, there is no proof of the\r\nsuccess of the tone poem more telling than the fact that practically\r\nevery composer in the musical world has written symphonic tone poems. In\r\nfact today, one hundred tone poems are written to one symphony! Berlioz\r\nhad his followers in France, and in the group around César Franck were\r\nseveral who wrote tone poems. One of the most charming of these poets\r\nwas Alexis Emanuel Chabrier (1841–1894) who took up music first as an\r\namateur while studying law in Paris, and while he was Minister of the\r\nInterior. Later he became so devoted to music that he gave all his time\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nAmong his works are operas and many other forms of music, the loveliest\r\nof which is the Rhapsody on Spanish tunes called _España_. It is a model\r\nof its kind and in it he uses the collected material with rare skill. It\r\nshows him very clever in reproducing foreign atmosphere and feeling. He\r\nwas born in Ambert, France, and died in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DEBUSSY\r\n\r\nClaude Achille Debussy (1862–1918) although talked of in another\r\nchapter, must be mentioned as a composer of tone poems in this. Among\r\nhis most famous works are _Après-midi d’Un Faune_, _La Mer_, _Les\r\nNuages_, _Fêtes_, and _Sirènes_ which are all surpassingly lovely,\r\nwritten in Debussy’s special harmonies with which he wove a mystical,\r\nfar away atmosphere, so compelling and yet so magical that you think you\r\nare in a mysterious cloudland. He usually uses a scale of whole tones.\r\nIn _Pelleas and Melisande_, his greatest work (opera) you seem to look\r\ninto a distant land which never did and never will exist, except in the\r\nglorious reaches of his or our imaginations. So to those of us who love\r\nfairy realms, cloudland and beauty of idea and serene expression,\r\nDebussy will be a rare treat and never vanish from our mind’s ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RAVEL\r\n\r\nMaurice Ravel (1875) still living in Paris, seems to love Spanish themes\r\nas did Chabrier and Bizet. One of the loveliest tone poems is his\r\n_Rhapsodie Espagnole_ in four movements. His _Mother Goose_ suite and\r\n_La Valse_ are also lovely, modern, short orchestral works.\r\n\r\nHe writes with rare distinction and beauty. In the chapter on 20th\r\ncentury music, Ravel will make another appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PAUL DUKAS (1865)\r\n\r\nAmong the most humorous and delightful tone poems is\r\n_L’Apprenti-Sorcier_ (_The Sorcerer’s Apprentice_) by Paul Dukas (1865).\r\nDukas too, will appear in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n       Late 19th Century Composers Write New Music on Old Models\r\n\r\n\r\n                   BRAHMS IN GERMANY—FRANCK IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nAfter calling Beethoven a Colossus, there does not seem to be room for\r\nany one else, and yet Brahms (1833–1897) is no less of a genius. You\r\nwill often hear people speak of “the three Bs,”—Bach, Beethoven and\r\nBrahms; and of these, Brahms being closer to our own day has had the\r\nadvantage and influence of the past. But perhaps he also had the\r\ndisadvantage of having had some one else say what he would like to have\r\nbeen the first to say! That Brahms continued the things that Beethoven\r\nbegan, may be understood from the fact that many call Brahms’ first\r\nsymphony _The Tenth_, meaning that Brahms had begun his symphonies where\r\nBeethoven left off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Johannes Brahms at Home._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _After the painting by Rongier._\r\n\r\n  _César Franck._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to write of Brahms without seeming to exaggerate, because\r\nif we speak of his songs we must say that no one ever created more\r\nbeautiful song form; if we speak of his chamber music we must\r\nacknowledge that he understood writing for instruments as no one before\r\nor since has surpassed. His piano pieces, too, are pure delight! Where\r\nwill one find finer work than his one concerto for violin and those for\r\npiano? His four symphonies have so far been unsurpassable and his choral\r\nworks, too. If he had never written anything but the _German Requiem_\r\nthis would have marked him as one of the world’s masters. Has he not\r\njustified Schumann’s exclamation upon meeting him in 1853, when Brahms\r\nwas twenty years old? “Graces and Heroes have watched the cradle of this\r\nyoung genius who sprang ‘like Minerva, fully armed from the head of\r\nJove.’” But Brahms was very modest and was always embarrassed in the\r\npresence of praise. While he was compared to Beethoven he waited until\r\nvery late in life to write symphonies. “How can I write a symphony,” he\r\nis reported to have said, “when I feel the shadow of the great Beethoven\r\ntreading constantly behind me?”\r\n\r\nHe was born in Hamburg. His father, who was a musician, rejoiced greatly\r\nwhen little Johannes at an early age gave proof that he was gifted. The\r\nBrahms family was very poor, and instead of becoming a great artist\r\naccording to his desire, Johannes’ father from the time he was old\r\nenough to earn his living, was a double-bass player. Even though he was\r\nthe best in Hamburg, he and his wife, who was also musical, had to\r\nstruggle and save to give their little son the best teachers in piano\r\nand composition.\r\n\r\nIn order to make more than the small amount gained by playing in the\r\norchestras the father organized what we call “the little German band”\r\nwhich played in the open air. Father Brahms and five other musicians\r\nattracted the people wherever they went. The boy who had begun to earn a\r\nfew pennies by arranging dances and marches for the little bands of the\r\ncafés, wrote music for his father’s band, and early in the morning even\r\nwhile he brushed shoes before others were awake, the thoughts which\r\nbecame his loveliest songs came to his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BRAHMS MEETS REMENYI\r\n\r\nWhen Johannes was fifteen he gave his first public piano recital and\r\nmade a deep impression. It started him on the road to fame, for he\r\nplayed so well that he was engaged to accompany the Gypsy violinist,\r\nRemenyi, who played all over the world and became very famous. Brahms\r\nwent into many countries with him but never came to America, where\r\nRemenyi was a great idol. Gypsy-like, he was happy in his wanderings and\r\nwhen he was old went into vaudeville, drawing thousands wherever he\r\nplayed. He was about to face one of these immense audiences in San\r\nFrancisco but drew only a few tones from his beloved violin when his\r\nmagic fingers were stilled in death!\r\n\r\nRemenyi was a great influence in Brahms’ life, for it was through him\r\nthat Brahms became fascinated with the Gypsy Dances which the composer\r\ngave the world as _Hungarian Dances_. He wrote them for piano solos,\r\nduets and bits of them may be found all through Brahms’ orchestral\r\nwritings. This is folk music, even though it was not the folk music of\r\nthe country in which Brahms was born.\r\n\r\nAnother important thing that came into his life through Remenyi was his\r\nmeeting with Joachim, one of the greatest violinists and teachers of the\r\nworld. At a concert given by Remenyi when playing the _Kreutzer_ sonata\r\nof Beethoven the piano was tuned so low that Brahms was compelled to\r\ntranspose the entire piano part a semitone (half-step) higher while\r\nplaying it. Joachim who was in the audience came behind the stage to\r\ncongratulate the players, and gave Brahms letters of introduction to\r\nLiszt, then at Weimar, and Schumann at Düsseldorf. This visit led to\r\nSchumann’s article about him, mentioned at the opening of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BRAHMS AND THE SCHUMANN’S\r\n\r\nBrahms became a favorite visitor at the home of Schumann and his\r\nbrilliant wife Clara Schumann. He was hailed by all the celebrities who\r\nassembled at the frequent soirées and musicales, as a musician of great\r\npromise. His compositions show a strong influence of this early\r\nfriendship. But Brahms repaid this kindness, for when the ill-fated\r\nSchumann died, he became like a son to the bereaved Clara Schumann, who\r\nloved him as one.\r\n\r\nAs this splendid pianist had played her husband’s piano works all over\r\nEurope, so she made known the first piano concerto of her young friend.\r\nShe made a success in spite of the fact that it was not particularly\r\nwell received at its first performance at the Leipsic Gewandhaus,\r\nprobably because Brahms was not as great a pianist as he was a composer.\r\nHis feeling seems to have made him want to turn the piano into an\r\norchestra. He felt everything in a massive way and was very exact.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-one Brahms became Director of the Court Concerts\r\nand of the Choral Society of the Prince of Lippe-Detmold. Being very\r\nconscientious he learned much from this experience, which helped him\r\ntoward becoming one of the greatest writers of choral works as his\r\n_German Requiem_ and _The Song of Fate_ prove.\r\n\r\nOutside of his music Brahms led an uneventful life. He never married,\r\nand devoted such affection as he might have given to a family to music.\r\nIt is told that someone who knocked at his door, receiving no answer,\r\nentered to find him sobbing violently under the emotion caused by some\r\nmusic that he was composing.\r\n\r\nWhen Brahms was about forty he visited Vienna and was so delighted with\r\nthe musical life he found there that he remained for the rest of his\r\ndays. As we note the delightful swing of his _Waltzes_, it is easy to\r\nbelieve that he felt the Viennese moods, which found their way into his\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nThere is little to say of his general habits except that he was\r\ndevotedly fond of out-door life and he interrupted his work only to take\r\nlong jaunts in the open, usually in company with sympathetic friends,\r\nfor he was friendly, and needed companionship. He did not give up all\r\nhis time to composing, for he was director of the great _Singverein_\r\n(Choral Society) and he gave some marvelous performances of the choral\r\nworks of Bach, Beethoven, and of other oratorios and masses.\r\n\r\nBrahms died (1897) at sixty-four from a cold he caught while attending\r\nthe funeral of his friend Clara Schumann. He now lies in the same\r\ncemetery as Beethoven and Schubert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HIS CONTRIBUTION TO MUSIC\r\n\r\nAlthough Brahms did not create any new forms, there are so many\r\ndifferent sides in his compositions, that it is hard to describe any one\r\nin particular. He came into the world at the time when music was turning\r\ntoward the dramatic, because of Wagner’s influence. It seemed that\r\nBrahms, himself, was afraid to hear Wagner, whose work he admired.\r\nBrahms never wrote an opera and he never wrote pictorial works such as\r\ntone poems. His writings were “absolute music” that is, music in its\r\npurest form, neither imitating nor representing anything but music. Here\r\nwas Brahms between the tone poems of Liszt, and the operas of Wagner,\r\nand he remained true to pure music! It is said that Hans von Bülow\r\ninvited him to attend the first performance of _Parsifal_ but he refused\r\nsaying that he had a dread of Wagnerians, (but not of Wagner)! Although\r\nBrahms wrote when the romantic school was at its height, he brought back\r\nclassicism with a force that influenced the entire musical world. In\r\naddition to the classic and romantic forms, many works are called\r\n_classic_ to distinguish them from _popular_ music.\r\n\r\nBrahms was of the peasant type, and honesty was one of his strongest\r\nqualities. This honesty, sincerity and simplicity may be found in every\r\nline of his music, which never has light or frothy moments, and which\r\nshows everywhere that he loved Bach. He left a large number of very\r\ngreat works. Indeed, one might study Brahms for years and even then\r\nnever know all he wrote.\r\n\r\nHe was the center of a group of song writers to whom he must have been\r\nan inspiration and an example. His lyrical gift and form, which mean\r\nthat his songs almost sing themselves, was so great that it is hard to\r\nunderstand how he could have written symphonies and sonatas which, to\r\nmany people, sound complex, thick and confused. But many people, even\r\ngood musicians feel this way about Brahms. May we not believe that some\r\nday their ears will be opened to its beauties and joys?\r\n\r\nThe song writers of this period were many as they are in all periods in\r\nevery country. Many write one or two songs that are lucky enough to\r\nbecome popular, but this does not make a great composer, for the great\r\neither bring something new into the world, or create music which by its\r\nquality moves other people to write good and beautiful music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SONG WRITERS\r\n\r\nBrahms towered among song writers after the time of Schubert and\r\nSchumann. He carried forward the form which has given Germany fame for\r\nher exquisite _lieder_ (songs). Great beauty with simplicity of vocal\r\nmelody against an accompaniment that had the character of a full-fledged\r\npiano piece distinguished these songs from those of an earlier period in\r\nwhich the accompaniment gave just a little support to the singer. The\r\nold songs however, were often heart appealing by their very simplicity\r\nfor they had almost a folk-song manner.\r\n\r\nFranz Abt (1819–1885) was one of these writers. He must have made a\r\nfortune out of _When the Swallows Homeward Fly_—only, as the composer\r\ncan not control these things, he probably never knew that this song was\r\nto be found on nearly every piano in America for almost fifty years!\r\n\r\nRobert Franz (1815–1892) made the world want to singer German _lieder_\r\nfor the haunting beauty of his songs. _The Rose Complained_ and _In\r\nAutumn_ are fair examples of a collection said to include 350 published\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XXIV you have seen the place in song occupied by Schubert and\r\nSchumann. From them to Brahms does not seem such a great stretch, but\r\nonly the musician knows how wide it is. The form in which Brahms wrote\r\n_lieder_ brought a new feeling to the composers, not by way of\r\nimitation, but because vocal music developed naturally into the paths\r\nalong which he led the way.\r\n\r\nRichard Strauss, known for his great tone poems, also for his operas\r\n_Salome_, _Elektra_ and _The Rose Cavalier_, shortly after Brahms wrote\r\nsome of the most beautiful songs in the world.\r\n\r\nWe also find many by his colleagues, Felix Weingartner (1863), Hans\r\nPfitzner (1869), Mahler and others, whose songs, though beautiful,\r\nshowed their skill less than their operas, symphonies, and choral works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HUGO WOLF—SONG GENIUS\r\n\r\nHugo Wolf (1860–1903) will be regarded, as time goes on, as one of the\r\ngreatest composers of the 19th century. This, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat he published 260 songs and nothing at all for orchestra, and in\r\nchamber music, he wrote only one very interesting quartet introduced in\r\nthis country nearly twenty years ago by the Flonzaley Quartet. Such a\r\nmaster would no doubt have left more than songs, would have been one of\r\nthe musical beacon-lights of the world, had his life not been one of\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nHis story, indeed, exceeds in unhappiness that of Schumann or even of\r\nBeethoven. Early in the best days of his life, his mind began to give\r\nway, and during periods of sanity he wrote with unbelievable fluency\r\nonly to be suddenly cut off from the power. He was fully aware of his\r\ncondition and his fate, and his letters expressing his emotions and\r\ndescribing his agony are too sad to write about.\r\n\r\nHugo Wolf, born at Windischgratz in Styria (1860) was the fourth son of\r\na leather-currier who was also a musician. The home was the scene of\r\nmuch chamber music in which Hugo played the second violin. The people of\r\nStyria loved the old Italian operas, and Wolf frequently expressed the\r\nbelief that he had some Latin blood in his veins. This seemed to show in\r\nhis music for he wrote songs in Italian and Spanish style and he was\r\nparticularly attracted to French music and musicians. One wonders could\r\ngreater songs have been written than his (_Spanisches Liederbuch_)\r\n_Spanish Song Book_ which includes not only thirty-four brilliant\r\nfolk-melodies, but also ten noble religious songs.\r\n\r\nRomain Rolland, the great French writer on musical subjects wrote: “It\r\nhas been said that the _Spanisches Liederbuch_ is to Wolf’s work what\r\n_Tristan_ is to Wagner’s.”\r\n\r\nIndeed many who write of Wolf have said that his vivid power of\r\nexpression, and inspiration could only be compared to Wagner’s. The\r\npoems he selected proved what a high literary taste he had. For a time\r\nhe was a musical critic and made the bitterest enemies because of the\r\nabuse he hurled at Brahms.\r\n\r\nHis story may be quickly told for he got most of his education from the\r\nlibraries and from reading the scores of the great masters. Having no\r\npiano he could be found daily sitting on a bench in the park studying\r\nthe Beethoven sonatas. But he loved Wagner best of all, and held his\r\nmeeting with that master his life’s greatest joy. Wolf had composed\r\nlittle until after he was twenty-eight, then his writing was feverish,\r\ninterrupted only by his lapses of mind. He died in one of these spells,\r\nof pneumonia, at 37. All his work was done in four or five years, for of\r\nthe last nine years during five of them (1890–95) he was prostrated and\r\noften unable to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BRUCKNER\r\n\r\nAmong the composers around this time and later, there are but few who\r\nhave left more than a ripple on the musical ocean. Some created a stir\r\nin their own day and even now there is hot discussion about them among\r\nthe critics, while some people are pleased and others are not.\r\n\r\nIn those days, as now, every composer had his friends and people who\r\nfelt it to be their duty not only to stand up for their friend, but to\r\nridicule “the other fellow.” So it was with Brahms, for in the same way\r\nthat he was abused by those who measured him against Wagner, his friends\r\nrefused to recognize in Anton Bruckner (1824–1896) a rival of their idol\r\n(Brahms).\r\n\r\nBrahms was living in Vienna but he was not born there, so the feeling\r\nwas strong against him when he began to threaten the position of the\r\nViennese, Anton Bruckner, who though nine years older than Brahms, was\r\nnot recognized so early. There was much in favor of Bruckner. He was a\r\nvery fine musician. Themes, melodies bubbled forth constantly like an\r\noil-gusher, but he did not know how or when to stop them. If he had only\r\nknown how to control this continuous flow, he might have been as great a\r\nfigure as Brahms and the story of his life been different.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful, however, what he made of himself, for he was a poor\r\nschoolmaster and organist who had only his natural gifts to start with,\r\nand had little education. But he wrote symphonies by the wholesale and\r\nthey were so long that they fairly terrified conductors to whom he\r\nbrought them in the hope of having them performed. He won his point,\r\nhowever, and lived to gain no small amount of recognition. We heard\r\nseveral of his symphonies in America in 1924, the hundredth anniversary\r\nof his birth in Ausfelden, Upper Austria. He died in Vienna in 1896.\r\n\r\nAnton Bruckner wrote during the time of the height of Richard Wagner’s\r\nglory and the dawn of Richard Strauss’s fame, and was eleven years\r\nyounger than Wagner, whom he idolized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MAHLER IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nGustav Mahler (1860–1911) enters at this point. It would be difficult to\r\nmake a definite statement about him, for whatever be said for or against\r\nhim, is sure to draw argument. He had been a storm-center for many years\r\nbefore his death, and even afterward those who were against him waged\r\nwar quite as bitterly, while those for him fought more valiantly than\r\never.\r\n\r\nAmerica was in the thick of this fight and many friendships of long\r\nstanding were broken on account of it. Mahler living in New York as\r\nrecently as 1908–1911 makes us realize the more fully what men of genius\r\nhave had to suffer.\r\n\r\nMahler was a powerful musical genius, with astounding ability to work\r\nand amazing skill in handling his massive scores. He died at the age of\r\nfifty-one leaving so many symphonies, choral and festival works that it\r\nwas a wonder how one man could have accomplished that much even had he\r\nlived to be a hundred.\r\n\r\nWe marvel at his genius, but do we want to hear often works that last\r\nfor hours and hours? Some do, who can follow his themes, his amazing\r\ntreatment of them and his ingenious writing for instruments. Others are\r\nfatigued by the length of time he dwells upon one subject and by the\r\nlength of the work itself, and they sometimes object to his strong\r\ncontrasts in light and shade. But all this must be left to the future,\r\nthe scales in which all art is weighed. We should be thankful that\r\nAmerica enjoyed the benefits Mahler brought.\r\n\r\nHe made his American début as conductor at the Metropolitan Opera House,\r\nJanuary 1, 1908, and in 1909 he became conductor of the New York\r\nPhilharmonic Orchestra. The labor was so hard, more in trying to adjust\r\nhimself to the ideas of his Board of Directors than in the work itself,\r\nthat it broke his health and he returned to his home to die that same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHe came here with a tremendous career behind him. It was strange, having\r\nall his life led operas and produced them in lavish fashion, he did not\r\nwrite one! But he did write many beautiful and very difficult songs.\r\nWhen his works are given, it is usually made a gala occasion, as they\r\ncan only be done by the largest organizations and with the greatest\r\nartists. The Society of the Friends of Music give some work by Mahler\r\neach season in New York.\r\n\r\nGustav Mahler was born in Kalischt, Bohemia, and died in Vienna. He\r\nstudied philosophy at the Vienna University and among his teachers of\r\nmusic were Julius Epstein and Anton Bruckner.\r\n\r\nWhen Anton Seidl left the opera house of Prague, 1885–86, Gustav Mahler\r\njointly with Angelo Neumann succeeded him. He made a great success of\r\nthe Court Opera of Vienna where he was director of the house and\r\nconductor for ten years, but he demanded nothing short of perfection.\r\nHis insistent ardor for the best in music and in its performance caused\r\nhim the greatest unhappiness and really cost him his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MAX REGER\r\n\r\nMax Reger (1873–1916) caused a stir during the latter part of the 19th\r\ncentury and the beginning of the 20th. His father, a schoolmaster and\r\ngood organist, wanted Max to be a schoolteacher, but at an early age\r\nyoung Max began to write for piano and organ. After hearing _Die\r\nMeistersinger_ and _Parsifal_ in Bayreuth (1888) he was so stirred that\r\nhe began to write big works. Reger was perhaps most influenced by Bach,\r\nand notwithstanding his very modern ideas he never lost sight of the old\r\nclassic form which may have made his work seem stiff and formal at\r\ntimes. Some of his songs are very fine and his orchestral numbers are\r\nfrequently played in America.\r\n\r\nMax Bruch (1838–1920) was born in Berlin and besides being a composer of\r\nchamber music, three symphonies and familiar violin concertos, he wrote\r\nmany choral works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FATHER FRANCK\r\n\r\nFrom this period, but not from this same country, arose one of the most\r\nimportant and most beautiful influences of the 19th century. We have\r\nlearned enough about the world’s great men to know that we can never\r\njudge by appearances, unless we are keen enough to recognize a beautiful\r\nsoul when it looks through kindly eyes.\r\n\r\nSuch was the countenance of César Franck (born in Liège, Belgium,\r\n1820—died in Paris, 1890), often called the “French Brahms”—but he was\r\nneither French, nor was he enough like Brahms to have been so called.\r\nWhile César Franck was not French, we may say that the entire French\r\nschool of the second half of the 19th century was of his making. This,\r\nbecause instead of devoting himself to playing in public and making long\r\nconcert tours, he preferred to have a quiet home life so that he could\r\ncompose. This seriously disappointed his father who had sent him from\r\nLiège to the Paris Conservatory.\r\n\r\nHe was but five years of age when Beethoven died, but his work\r\nthroughout his entire life strongly showed the influence of the Master\r\nof Bonn, perhaps because his first teacher in Paris was Anton Reicha, a\r\nfriend and admirer of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nWhile all of Beethoven’s nine symphonies are known and played all over\r\nthe world, César Franck is known by one which is played very often and\r\nby all orchestras. Where Beethoven wrote many sonatas both for piano\r\nalone and for piano and violin, when we hear the name of César Franck,\r\nwe immediately think of the one famous sonata for violin and piano which\r\nwas so popular that it was also arranged for violoncello. This was\r\nwritten in very free and practically new form.\r\n\r\nCésar Franck has written a number of fine works for piano and for\r\norchestra, and for stringed instruments, but when it comes to organ\r\nworks, it would take a large volume to tell of them. Most pianists play\r\nthe _Prelude_, _Aria_ and _Finale_, also the _Prelude_, _Chorale_ and\r\n_Fugue_, just as nearly all the violinists play the sonata, which are\r\nmasterpieces. Being deep in church music, and also a very religious man\r\nit was perhaps natural that among his best known works should be _Les\r\nBéatitudes_ for orchestra, chorus and soloists, and _Redemption_, a work\r\nsung frequently by the Oratorio Societies of America and Europe. It was\r\nd’Indy who said: “In France, symphonic music originated with the school\r\nof César Franck.” There were not, however, many symphonies, but he was a\r\nmaster in the symphonic poem. The best known among these are _Les\r\nÉolides_ (_The Æolides_), _Les Djinns_ on Victor Hugo’s splendid poem of\r\nthat name and _Le Chasseur Maudit_ (_The Accursed Hunter_). Also very\r\nwell known is the piano quintet, and we hear sometimes the Symphonic\r\nVariations for piano and orchestra.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FRANCK AT THE PARIS CONSERVATORY\r\n\r\nCésar Franck was different from most composers, for _his_ father, like\r\nFather Mozart, was very determined that he should be a pianist and took\r\nthe boy on a concert tour when he was only ten years of age! He gave\r\nconcerts throughout Belgium, and at fourteen his father took him with\r\nhis brother Joseph to the Paris Conservatory, where later he became a\r\ndistinguished professor.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples in life where a talent runs away with its\r\npossessor. So it was with young César, who, after only a year’s\r\nschooling, entered the _concours_ or competition. He covered himself\r\nwith glory in the piano piece he had to play, but when he was tested for\r\nreading at sight, it flashed through his head how funny it would be to\r\ntranspose the piece three notes lower! And so he did, without a mistake!\r\nBut the judges were so horrified that he should dare do anything\r\ndifferent from what was expected that they decided not to give him the\r\nprize because he had broken the rules! But, Cherubini, our old\r\nacquaintance there was great enough to know what the boy had done, and\r\nthrough his influence a special prize was created for César Franck\r\ncalled the Grand Prix d’Honneur which has never, since then, been\r\nconferred upon anyone!\r\n\r\nCésar Franck was very mild and sweet in nature but when it came to his\r\nmusic he was almost rebellious in his independence. To understand the\r\ndegree of his daring you must know what a _concours_ means.\r\n\r\nThe graduating classes of the Paris Conservatory are drawn up to play\r\ntheir pieces and to receive the criticism of the judges, and the prizes.\r\nThey all play the same thing so the judges can tell exactly how each\r\ncompares with the other. Five of the most famous musicians of the world\r\nare selected and they sit in judgment. Imagine this terrifying ordeal! A\r\ncouple of years after the first occurrence, César Franck had to enter an\r\norgan competition, and again his genius got away from his judgment. He\r\nwas expected to improvise a sonata on one subject given him by the\r\njudges and a fugue on another subject. Franck passed in very orderly\r\nfashion through the first part, but when it came to the fugue he thought\r\nhow amusing it would be to work the sonata subject into the fugue\r\nsubject, a feat which startled these wise judges by its colossal daring\r\nand the stupendous manner in which he accomplished it. But did they give\r\nhim the first prize? Not they! Talk about “Red Tape”—he had not followed\r\nthe rules and all he received out of the brilliant feat was a second\r\nprize! But the world got César Franck.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      COMPOSER, TEACHER, ORGANIST\r\n\r\nWe little realize how a tiny deed may influence the world! We may almost\r\nreckon that a kind-hearted priest was responsible for what César Franck\r\nbecame as a composer! After he had had the wonderful musical training at\r\nthe Conservatory he refused to travel as a concert artist, but wanted to\r\nremain at home and marry. This separated him completely from his father.\r\nBesides wanting his son to play, he objected to his marrying an actress\r\nwhen he was twenty-six. Here is where the priest first befriended him,\r\nfor he performed the ceremony that made them man and wife.\r\n\r\nBut the days of revolution in Paris (1848) were upon them and pupils did\r\nnot come in great numbers. Poverty such as Franck had never known faced\r\nhim and his bride. But his good friend the priest was called to a church\r\nand he immediately appointed César Franck as organist. The instrument\r\nwas very fine and his happiness was complete for he loved church\r\nservices above everything. This brought him directly under the musical\r\ninfluence of Bach, which after all, was the greatest in his life. Later\r\nhe became organist of Saint Clothilde where the organ was even finer and\r\nhis composing hours were fairly absorbed by writing for the organ.\r\n\r\nThe programs given by concert-organists are usually divided between Bach\r\nand César Franck, with a few numbers by Alexandre Guilmant, the great\r\nFrench organist, Charles Marie Widor, Theodore Dubois and a few other\r\nFrenchmen.\r\n\r\nWith all the composition that this grand old man of musical France left\r\nbehind him, he left a still greater thing in the young men who were his\r\npupils, some of whom were among the most important figures in the late\r\n19th century.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that César Franck died almost exactly as did two\r\nof his most famous pupils, Ernest Chausson and Emmanuel Chabrier. The\r\nformer was killed in the Bois de Boulogne while riding a bicycle and\r\nChabrier was killed by a fall from a horse. Their beloved professor was\r\nknocked down by an omnibus, and although he seemed to recover and\r\ncontinue with his lessons and composing, he became ill from the effects\r\nand died a few months later, in his 68th year.\r\n\r\nDuring this last illness he wanted to get out of bed to try three new\r\n_chorales_ for organ, which he read through day after day as the end\r\napproached. This was the last music from his pen for the manuscripts\r\nwere lying beside him when the priest gave him the last rites of the\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nIf one could sum up the outstanding features of César Franck’s music,\r\nthey would be nobility and lofty spirit, true reflections of his\r\nunfaltering religious faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRANCK’S PUPILS\r\n\r\nCésar Franck did more than just devote teaching hours to his pupils. He\r\nhad them come to his home, and surrounded by youth and enthusiasm, his\r\nown power grew greater. They played their new works for each other and\r\nfor the Master, and out of this was born the _Société Nationale_\r\n(National Society). It swung both the public taste and the composers out\r\nof the light, frivolous opera of the day into a love for, and a support\r\nof French symphonic and chamber music. The Society was founded in 1871,\r\njust following the Franco-Prussian war and was a protest against the\r\nGerman musical domination in France, in fact it was a direct aim against\r\nWagner. In spite of the fact that Franck was influenced by Bach,\r\nBeethoven and Wagner, he worked sincerely to develop the classic French\r\nschool outside of opera form.\r\n\r\nAnother great national institution which grew out of the influence of\r\nCésar Franck was the famous Schola Cantorum founded by Vincent d’Indy\r\nand Charles Bordes, his pupils, and Alexandre Guilmant.\r\n\r\nAmong the Franck pupils in addition to d’Indy and Bordes may be\r\nmentioned, as a few of the foremost, Alexis de Castillon (1838–1873),\r\nEmmanuel Chabrier (1842–1894), Henri Duparc (1848) famous for some of\r\nthe most beautiful songs in all French music, Ernest Chausson\r\n(1855–1899), Guillaume Lekeu (1870–1894), of the Netherlands, and\r\ncomposer of _Hamlet_, a tone poem and other pieces, Pierre de Bréville\r\n(1861), Guy Ropartz (1864), Gabriel Pierné, Paul Vidal, and Georges\r\nMarty.\r\n\r\nBut his influence did not stop here, for it touched many, including such\r\nclose friends as Alexandre Guilmant and Eugene Ysaye, the renowned\r\nviolinist, as well known in America as in Europe. He was a countryman of\r\nCésar Franck and played for its first performance anywhere, Franck’s\r\nviolin sonata dedicated to him.\r\n\r\nAlberic Magnard (1865–1914), was related musically to Franck through\r\nd’Indy his chief teacher. Magnard met death by the enemy in his own home\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\nWe could fill a volume concerning these interesting men, but we must\r\ncontinue our musical journey. From among them, however, we must learn a\r\nlittle more about Vincent d’Indy, not only because he is a great\r\ncomposer and teacher, but he has taught many Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VINCENT D’INDY\r\n\r\nVincent d’Indy (1851) a musician of finest qualities and almost\r\ncountless achievements, is a cultured and educated gentleman. He was\r\nbrought up by his grandmother, a woman of education and refinement, for\r\nhis mother died when he was very young. He therefore learned to love\r\nculture and elegance early in his life, but this did not prevent him\r\nfrom doing the sort of work which make men a benefit to art and to\r\nmankind. In addition to being a musician, he is a skilled critic and\r\nwriter, also a great teacher and organizer, proof of which may be found\r\nin what he has done for France, indeed, for the world, in the Schola\r\nCantorum. He has written many books as well as magazine and newspaper\r\narticles and an immense number of musical compositions. He was born in\r\nParis and was a member of the Garde-Mobile during the Franco-Prussian\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nUntil the time that he left home for military service he studied the\r\npiano with Louis Dièmer, a noted pianist and teacher of Paris, and\r\nharmony with Marmontel and Lavignac, both equally famous. Upon his\r\nreturn from war service, his days with César Franck began, and these\r\nwere precious hours for both the pupil and the teacher who recognized\r\nthe young man’s power.\r\n\r\nHe made several trips to Germany, the first in 1873 when he carried to\r\nBrahms the César Franck score of _Redemption_ sent with the composer’s\r\ncompliments. At this time he also met Liszt and Wagner, and later he\r\nattended the Bayreuth performances including the world première (first\r\nperformance) of _Parsifal_. His musical activities led him from the\r\norgan loft to becoming tympani (kettle-drums) player in the Colonne\r\nOrchestra, where he went, no doubt, to learn the instruments of the\r\norchestra and how to handle them. He found out, because he is most\r\nskilled in writing for orchestra.\r\n\r\nHe has had many prominent pupils, and it is his pride and his ambition\r\nto continue along the lines laid down by César Franck. He has had more\r\nthan ordinary success as a conductor going to many countries to conduct\r\nhis own compositions. He came twice to America as guest conductor of the\r\nBoston Symphony appearing with that organization in its home and also in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nVincent d’Indy, following the ideal of Franck is largely responsible for\r\nthe return of music in his country to symphony, from which it had\r\nstrayed far. In this period there was a general feeling to bring music\r\nback to classical form. This young school was doing it in France as\r\nBrahms had done it in Germany and the result was that many composers\r\nwrote symphonies. If we look through musical history since then, we will\r\nfind that the revival of a feeling for the classics has helped to make\r\nthe latter part of the 19th century very rich.\r\n\r\nAlthough d’Indy has written several operas, there has been no attempt to\r\ngive them in this country, which is strange because it is very difficult\r\nto get operas that are worth producing at the Metropolitan Opera House\r\nor in Chicago, the only other city in America that supports its own\r\nopera on a large scale.\r\n\r\nD’Indy is living in Paris (1925), where the life around him bristles\r\nwith study, achievement and ambition. He is as much of an inspiration to\r\nhis pupils as was his own teacher, but this is the 20th century, in\r\nwhich conditions, and men, are different from those of the past! He has\r\nnot stood still but has gone steadily ahead, although his influence upon\r\nthe very modern writers must have been healthy and restraining,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that only a few years ago _he_ was regarded as\r\na modern.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GABRIEL FAURÉ\r\n\r\nIn the musical history of France, the name of Gabriel Fauré (1845–1924)\r\nlooms high. He was born in Pamiers, and was taught by the Dean of French\r\nmusical folk, Camille Saint-Saëns. Like all the musicians of France, no\r\nmatter whether or not they planned to use it as a profession, they\r\ndevoted as much time to the organ as to the piano, and most of them\r\nbecame famous organists even though they had not planned to be\r\norganists. For this reason France has more great organists and organ\r\ncompositions to offer than any other country of the world.\r\n\r\nGabriel Fauré became the organist of Rennes and later went to Saint\r\nSulpice and Saint Honoré, and finally he became organist of the\r\nMadeleine in 1896. These churches are among the greatest in France, and\r\nto be organist in any one of them means that he is a great musician.\r\n\r\nFauré had honors showered upon him for he gave his country some of the\r\nmost brilliant works contributed by any of her sons. In France the\r\ncompositions of Gabriel Fauré are highly valued, but with the exception\r\nof a few songs, are not known in America, the more the pity. Fauré is\r\nbetter known here as the head of the Conservatory in which his life was\r\nspent until his very recent death. He went there to share the classes in\r\ncomposition, counterpoint and fugue with André Gédalge, succeeding Jules\r\nMassenet, and in 1905 Fauré succeeded Theodore Dubois as Director of the\r\nConservatory. Still more honors heaped upon him made him a member of the\r\n_Académie_, for which no one can be named until there is a vacancy. He\r\nwas therefore the successor to Ernest Reyer.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the world was much stirred when Gabriel Fauré was made Commander\r\nof the Legion of Honor, a distinction given only when a man has done\r\nsomething very great.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these tributes to his standing in the community and his\r\nachievements as an artist, he took numerous prizes for his compositions\r\nof which there were three operas, much incidental music, symphonies, a\r\nwell known violin and piano sonata, some fine chamber music and much\r\nmusic for the organ and for choruses. But beyond the appreciation always\r\nshown Fauré for his larger works, he will always be loved in France\r\nbecause he was regarded as the French Schubert, so lovely were his\r\nmelodies and so lavishly did he write.\r\n\r\nHe kept pure and true the ideals and characteristics of French music,\r\nmore so, indeed, than did many who may be better known to the\r\nconcert-goers of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ENGLISH COMPOSERS IN CLASSICAL FORMS\r\n\r\nWhile the Germans, French and Austrians were writing, England had\r\ncomposers, who although not so famous, nevertheless kept music alive in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nSir William Sterndale Bennett (1816–1875) with his many orchestral and\r\nchoral works of which his cantata, _The Woman of Samaria_, is best\r\nknown; Sir George A. Macfarren (1813–1887) with operas and oratorios,\r\nespecially his cantata, _Rebekah_; his brother, Walter Cecil Macfarren\r\n(1826–1905), conductor, and composer of orchestral music; Sir John\r\nStainer (1840–1901), organist, composer of very lovely anthems, and much\r\nchurch music, and Professor of Music at Oxford; Sir Frederick Bridge\r\n(1844–1924), organist of Westminster Abbey, writer of text-books on\r\nmusic, and of anthems, part songs and oratorios; Sir Arthur C. Mackenzie\r\n(1847), composer of many works including two Scotch symphonies and a\r\ncantata, _The Cottar’s Saturday Night_; Sir Charles Hubert Hastings\r\nParry (1848–1918), Professor of Music at Oxford after Stainer, and\r\nwriter of many important books on music and of compositions in many\r\nforms; Arthur Goring Thomas (1851–1892), who wrote operas, cantatas, and\r\nmany songs; Sir Frederick Hymen Cowen (1852), with operas, cantatas,\r\nsymphonies and chamber music; Sir Charles Villiers Stanford (1853–1924),\r\nborn in Dublin, Ireland, Professor of Music at Cambridge since 1887,\r\nstudent of Irish folk music, and writer of chamber music and short\r\npieces, also of valuable books on musical history and other musical\r\nsubjects; Edward German (1862), famous for his _Henry VIII_ Dances, much\r\nincidental theatre music, and an operetta, _The Moon Fairies_, in which\r\nhe used the last libretto written by Sullivan’s inimitable partner, Sir\r\nW. S. Gilbert; and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875–1912), an Englishman of\r\nAfrican descent, whose music for chorus and for orchestra is based on\r\nAmerican Indian legend, and on Negro folk songs.\r\n\r\nAnd living today is Edward William Elgar (1857), the dean of English\r\ncomposers. While not adding to the new music, he is famous for many\r\npieces, among which are _The Dream of Gerontius_, _The Apostles_, other\r\noratorios, symphonies, and his march, _Pomp and Circumstance_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WOMEN WRITERS IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nAmong the women in England, Dame Ethel Smyth (_Dame_ is an honorary\r\ntitle in England) (1858) is known for her opera _The Wreckers_, and her\r\ncomic opera _The Boatswain’s Mate_. Some of her operas have been\r\nperformed at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York and at Covent\r\nGarden, London. Besides she has written songs for the Suffrage Movement,\r\nincidental music, and music in large forms.\r\n\r\nLiza Lehman (1862–1918), wrote _In a Persian Garden_, _Nonsense Songs_,\r\nand _The Daisy Chain_, which made her famous.\r\n\r\n“Poldowski,” Lady Dean Paul, daughter of Wieniawski, the Polish composer\r\nand violinist, has written piano pieces and lovely songs in Debussy\r\nstyle. She has had considerable influence in getting the work of the\r\nyounger British composers and her countryman, Szymanowski, heard in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nRebecca Clarke, a young Englishwoman, has written several chamber music\r\nworks which place her in the foremost rank of women composers. On two\r\noccasions she received “honorable mention” in the Berkshire chamber\r\nmusic prize competition offered by Mrs. F. S. Coolidge, at Pittsfield,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n                   Music Appears in National Costumes\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot tell you very much about the history of music in Russia\r\nbecause until the 19th century, the Russians had little but their folk\r\nsongs and church music. For many centuries the Christian priests\r\ndisliked to have them sing their legends and folk songs because they\r\nwere not of Christian origin and so music had a very difficult road to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which kept music as an art from growing, was the edict in\r\nthe Church against the use of instruments. But as there is always a\r\nsilver lining to every cloud the unaccompanied singing became very\r\nlovely.\r\n\r\nFor ages, then, there was the most strikingly beautiful natural music in\r\nthe folk tunes of this gigantic country, three times as large as the\r\nUnited States. Its cold bleak steppes or plains and its nearness to the\r\nEast gave them fascinating and fantastic legends, and a music sad, wild\r\nand colorful with strange harmonies—their inheritance from the Slavs and\r\nTartars. All these date back to days before the Christian era, so you\r\ncan understand even though they are of surpassing beauty, the Church was\r\nafraid of the wild, tragic, pagan melodies and rhythms.\r\n\r\nIn the early 18th century, at the time of and after Peter the Great,\r\nthere were many Europeans who came to Russia and brought along their\r\nmusic or their own national ideas of music, so that Russia had foreign\r\nopera and foreign teachers. When Catharine the Great was Queen she\r\nappreciated the wonderful store of folk legends and was very good to\r\ncomposers both Italian and Russian, of whom there were very few.\r\n\r\nVery soon, a man from Venice, Catterino Cavos, went over and was clever\r\nenough to write Italian opera using the Russian folk songs and legends.\r\nThis was a fine idea, because it gave suggestions to Russians as to what\r\ncould be done with their folk songs. The next thing that happened was\r\nthe terrible defeat of Napoleon, in 1812, by the Russians and the\r\nburning of Moscow. When important political things happen and when a\r\nfavorite city is nearly destroyed, people’s imaginations are stirred and\r\nit makes them think about the things of their own land. The Russians\r\nwere no different from other folks. After the way was prepared by\r\nVertowsky, Dargomyzhsky, and Seroff, Michael Glinka (1804–1857) wrote\r\nhis opera, _A Life For the Tsar_, for the time was ripe for serious\r\nRussian national music. He was tired of the music of the Italians,\r\nintroduced into Russia in 1737, and the French music introduced by\r\nBoieldieu and others a little after 1800. He made a close study of\r\nRussian folk song and of composition, and became the father of the new\r\nRussian music. He studied in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) with Charles\r\nMayer and John Field, the Irish composer of nocturnes who found his way\r\ninto Russia with Clementi. Glinka became an invalid and his travels for\r\nhis health brought him to Paris where he was very much interested in the\r\nworks of Berlioz. When he wrote his first opera, he said he wanted the\r\nRussians “to feel at home,” and so we see in it the magic background of\r\nRussia with the flavor and interest of the Orient. Another opera of his\r\nwas _Ruslan and Ludmilla_ which also pictures their national life.\r\nBesides this, Glinka, in some Spanish caprices, brought Spanish folk\r\nsongs before the eyes of the musical art world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RUBINSTEIN AND TCHAIKOVSKY\r\n\r\nAn important group followed in the footsteps of Glinka, called “The\r\nFive.” The members wanted national music and sincere opera in any form\r\nthey desired. The Russian Ballet, which tells a story and is not a mere\r\nexhibition of fancy steps, was an outcome of this freedom.\r\n\r\nThere were two schools about this time in Russia, constantly at odds\r\nwith each other. The “Russian Five” was one school and the leaders of\r\nthe other were Anton and Nikolai Rubinstein and Peter Ilytch Tchaikovsky\r\n(1840–1893) whose fame is probably greater than any other Russian.\r\nTchaikovsky became very interested in the European composers, and\r\nstudied composition with the founder of the Petrograd Conservatory,\r\nAnton Rubinstein. He was made professor of harmony at the Moscow\r\nConservatory in 1866. While there he wrote many operas and articles for\r\nMoscow papers. He married unhappily and had a nervous breakdown in 1877\r\nand lived very quietly, a sensitive nervous man all his life. He visited\r\nthe United States in 1891, and conducted his Sixth Symphony, _The\r\nPathetique_, at the opening of Carnegie Hall in New York City. Visiting\r\nEngland and then returning to Russia, he died in 1893 of cholera.\r\nBesides the symphonic poems about which we told you, he wrote several\r\novertures, six symphonies, four suites, three ballets, eleven operas,\r\ntwo of which, _La Pique Dame_ and _Eugen Onegin_ have been given outside\r\nof Russia.\r\n\r\nHis work is very emotional and often tragic with captivating melodies\r\noften based on folk songs with rich orchestral color. But withal, his\r\nwork was based more on the German tendencies and forms of music than the\r\nworks of the younger Russians, therefore, Tchaikovsky and Rubinstein\r\nwere pitched in musical battle for some years against this other school.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               “THE FIVE”\r\n\r\nAlexander Borodin (1834–1887), a scientist and physician and a friend of\r\nLiszt, wrote crashing and flashy music with what they called “Modern\r\nharmonies.” It seemed full of discords for the people of his time but to\r\nus is fascinating and piquant! His _Prince Igor_, a story of adventure\r\nand war not unlike _Le Chanson de Roland_, is a beautiful opera with\r\nstriking melody and dances.\r\n\r\nModeste Moussorgsky (1839–1881) probably had more natural genius than\r\nany of the rest of “The Five,” even though his work had to be edited by\r\nNikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844–1908). Moussorgsky’s music had the real\r\nspirit of Russia, sad, colorful, full of wild dances based as is most of\r\nthis Russian music, on the folk songs of his native land. Besides this,\r\nit is very human and touches the soul of people as they listen. His\r\nsongs are real treasures. His music is truly a portrait of the Russian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a very beautiful opera called _Boris Godounov_ richly laden\r\nwith the Oriental color, and pathos and tragedy of Russia’s past. A very\r\ninteresting thing to know is that Rimsky, because of his wider knowledge\r\nof harmony and orchestration, corrected Moussorgsky’s works and very\r\noften changed things that seemed to him quite wrong. Recently we have\r\nexamined a score of Moussorgsky and compared it to the corrected version\r\nof Rimsky and we now find that Moussorgsky’s score was even more vivid\r\nand modern to our ears than Rimsky’s. Several composers have arranged\r\nfor orchestra Moussorgsky’s piano pieces, _Pictures from an Exposition_,\r\nand have brought out beauties in color, humor and scenic painting in the\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nThe next man, Mily Balakirev (1837–1910), a country boy steeped in folk\r\nsongs, became the founder and leader of this Group of Five. He founded a\r\nfree music school in Petrograd and later became the conductor of the\r\nRoyal Musical Society, of the Imperial Musical Society, and Imperial\r\nChapel. His works are chiefly in symphony form, brilliantly and\r\neffectively orchestrated. Some of his piano pieces and songs are very\r\nbeautiful, but his greatest gift to music was his careful study of\r\nRussian national story and song, and he furthered the revival of the\r\nOriental in Russian musical art.\r\n\r\nCésar Cui (1835–1918), born at Vilna, Poland, was the son of a French\r\nofficer, and became a great authority on military science. He wrote\r\neight operas which were more lyric than dramatic and, as Balakirev’s\r\nfriend and first disciple among “The Five,” he helped this younger\r\nRussian School with his musical compositions and writings for the press.\r\n\r\nLast but not the least of this “Five” is Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov\r\n(1844–1908), who was born in Novgorod, and while a student at the\r\nPetrograd Naval College, became an advocate of the theories of Balakirev\r\nto keep Russian music, Russian. While on a three-year cruise, he wrote\r\nhis first symphony, and on another, as a young naval officer, he came to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nVery soon he left the navy and became a teacher and conductor in\r\nPetrograd. He is best known in this country for his orchestral suite,\r\n_Shéhérazade_, which gives a glamorous picture of some of the stories\r\nfrom “The Arabian Nights” as told by the Persian Queen, Shéhérazade.\r\nAnother famous thing of his, is his second symphony _Antar_. Probably no\r\nother person among the Russians could give you the effect and\r\ncolorfulness of the Orient as Rimsky. He takes most of his stories from\r\nRussian legends and his operas are entrancing. The best of these are\r\n_The Snow Maiden_, _Sadko_, and the humorous, fantastic and tuneful _Coq\r\nd’Or_ (“The Golden Cockerel”). He has written works for the piano, and\r\nsome of the songs out of his operas, such as _The Song of India_ and\r\n_Shepherd Lehl_ are probably familiar to you.\r\n\r\nThese five men and the group including Anton and Nikolai Rubinstein,\r\nSergei Tanieiev (1856–1915) and Tchaikovsky, were very antagonistic, as\r\nwe said before, until finally some of the Five went on the staff of the\r\nvarious conservatories in Russia and the breach seemed to be healed; and\r\nnow new men have appeared, out-distancing even the Five in modern\r\nharmony, Alexander Scriabin (1872–1919) and Igor Stravinsky (1882).\r\n\r\nComing after these celebrated Russians were Anton Arensky (1861–1906),\r\nAlexander Glazounov (1865), both writers of symphonies, piano pieces and\r\nchamber music, Anatole Liadov (1855–1914), Serge Liapounov (1859),\r\nNikolai Medtner (1879), Catoire, Reinhold Glière (1875), Ippolitov\r\nIvanov (1859), Alexander Gretchaninov (1864), Serge Vassilenko (1872),\r\nTheodor Akimenko and Sergei Rachmaninov (1873), who has spent many years\r\nin America where he is known as a brilliant composer and gifted pianist.\r\n(Page 409.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BOHEMIA—CZECHO-SLOVAKIA\r\n\r\nAnother country rich in national characteristics, donning national\r\ncostume in art music as well as in folk music, is Bohemia—or\r\nCzecho-Slovakia. It is the land of harp players, street musicians and\r\nthe gypsy, where nearly everybody seems to be musical. The Esterhazy\r\nfamily, nobles who were patrons of Haydn and other composers, were\r\nBohemians.\r\n\r\nIn Prague, their principal city, Gluck, Mozart, Weber and many other\r\nforeigners were appreciated when their own countries turned deaf ears to\r\nthem, but it is not until the middle of the 19th century, that Bohemia\r\ngave the world its own composers. Among these were Frederick Smetana\r\n(1824–1884), a pupil of Liszt and a fine pianist. He became the opera\r\nconductor at Prague and like Beethoven, became afflicted with deafness,\r\nbut it unbalanced his mind and he died in an insane asylum at sixty. He\r\nwrote a number of pieces for chamber combinations, symphonic poems,\r\nsymphonies and operas of which the best known is the _Bartered Bride_, a\r\npicture of Bohemian life.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Bohemian and one of the ablest musicians of the 19th\r\ncentury, is Antonin Dvorak (pronounced Dvorjak) (1843–1904), a peasant\r\nand son of an innkeeper and butcher at Mühlhausen. Coming from the\r\npeople, he was familiar with the folk songs, and although his father\r\nwanted him to be an innkeeper and butcher, Antonin used to follow the\r\nstrolling players and showed a decided talent for music. He learned to\r\nsing, to play the violin and the organ, and studied harmony. Later he\r\nwent to Prague to continue his work. He was very poor but Smetana\r\nbefriended him, and five years after he entered school, he wrote his\r\nfirst string quartet. Thirteen years afterwards, he became organist at\r\n$60.00 a year at St. Adalbert’s Church. He is another man whom Liszt\r\nhelped by performing his works and finding publishers for them. He\r\nbecame famous through his fascinating _Slavonic Dances_ and was soon\r\ninvited to London after his _Stabat Mater_ had been performed there. He\r\nwrote _The Spectre’s Bride_ for the Birmingham Festival of 1885, and his\r\noratorio for the Leeds Festival, _St. Ludmilla_, in the following year.\r\nThe University of Cambridge made him Doctor of Music and before that, he\r\nhad been Professor of Music at the Prague Conservatory. Soon he came to\r\nNew York and received a salary of $15,000 a year as director of the New\r\nYork Conservatory of Music. Homesickness overcame him and he went back\r\nto Bohemia where his opera, _Armide_, was given before he died.\r\n\r\nDvorak was a sound musician. He had studied Mozart, Beethoven and\r\nSchubert but was devoted to his own folk-lore and the harmonies which\r\nappealed to his nation. He was particularly interested in national types\r\nof music and when in America the negro music appealed to him\r\ntremendously. While here, he taught H. C. Burleigh, the negro composer\r\nand singer, with whom he had an interesting and fruitful friendship.\r\nWhen he went back to Bohemia, he wrote the _New World Symphony_, built\r\non negro folk ideas, and a string quartet in which he has used negro\r\nthemes. Isn’t it curious that it often takes an outsider to show us the\r\nbeauties at our own door step?\r\n\r\nHe wrote many songs, symphonic poems and five symphonies and many other\r\nforms of music. Although he was very strict in the use of form, his work\r\nwas free, full of melody and imagination. It is distinguished by warm\r\ncolor, beautiful rhythms and flowing melody, daring modulations and\r\nwithal a sense of naturalness. Some people consider him one of the\r\ngreatest masters of orchestration of the 19th century. Probably you have\r\nheard Fritz Kreisler and many others play the famous _Humoresque_, and\r\nyou may also know his incomparable _Songs My Mother Taught Me_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ROUMANIA\r\n\r\nGeorges Enesco (1881) a most gifted violinist, conductor and composer,\r\nborn in Cordaremi, is the principal representative of Roumania. His\r\nfirst work is _Poème Roumain_, in which, as well as in many others, he\r\nshows his Roumanian birth. He wrote symphonies and other orchestral\r\nworks, chamber music and songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE LAND OF THE POLONAISE\r\n\r\nPoland first springs into prominence as an art center in music with\r\nFrédéric Chopin, but it has produced many other pianists and\r\npianist-composers,—among them, Carl Tausig.\r\n\r\nIf you like brilliant salon and over-decorated pieces, you will enjoy\r\nthe works of Moritz Moszkowski (1854–1924), who was born of Polish\r\ndescent in Breslau. He was a fine pianist and had a long list of pupils\r\nincluding the brilliant American, Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler.\r\n\r\nPoland has given us Ignace Jan Paderewski (1860), whose _Minuet_ you\r\nprobably know, and whose amazing piano skill is familiar to you. While\r\nhe has written many piano pieces, a fairly successful gypsy opera,\r\n_Manru_, an interesting piano concerto and a symphony, it is as pianist\r\nthat he will be remembered. He has been the idol of every nation in\r\nwhich he has played.\r\n\r\nHis pupil, Sigismund Stojowski (1870), has lived in America since 1906\r\nand has written orchestral works, a piano concerto and many piano\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE LAND OF THE FIORDS AND SKALDS—NORWAY AND SWEDEN\r\n\r\nHere is another country with a rich folk-lore, half pagan and half\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\nOle Bull, the violinist, also did much for Norwegian music in the 19th\r\ncentury. One of the first composers was Halfdan Kjerulf (1815–1868) who\r\nwas born in Christiania (Oslo) and studied in Leipsic. He gave up his\r\nlife to composition. Henrietta Sontag as well as Jenny Lind introduced\r\nhis songs to the public; like his delightful piano pieces they are\r\nnational in flavor. If you have the chance, hear his _Lullaby_ and _Last\r\nNight_.\r\n\r\nNorway! The land of the Vikings, of Odin and Thor, of the eddas and\r\nsagas, of skalds and harpists, of sprites and trolls, fiords, mountain\r\nkings and the mischievous Peer Gynt—all brought to life by the magic\r\nwand of Edvard Hagerup Grieg (1843–1907).\r\n\r\nSurely one of the greatest poet-composers of recent times, he brought\r\nout the beauties of the Norwegian folk song and dance, and dressed up\r\nserious music in national costume. Ole Bull assisted Grieg by\r\nrecognizing his ability when he was a very young man. Grieg was sent to\r\nthe Leipsic Conservatory but he overworked and became ill, and went to\r\nCopenhagen, where he met Niels Gade, under whose guidance some of his\r\nearlier works were written. He returned to Norway and was again\r\nstimulated by Ole Bull; he met a young composer, Rikard Nordraak, and\r\ntogether they did a good deal of work toward establishing a national\r\nschool. Again Liszt acts as an international aid society to young\r\nmusicians, for he now befriends Grieg in Rome. The government of Norway\r\ngranted a life pension to Grieg so that he might give all his time to\r\ncomposition, after which he wrote incidental music to the celebrated\r\n_Peer Gynt_ of Ibsen. He lived in the country and in 1885 built his\r\nvilla “Troldhaugen” near Bergen. His wife, who is still living in\r\n“Troldhaugen,” sang many of his songs.\r\n\r\nHis short pieces are like portraits of Norway and he is able to catch\r\nwith marvelous ease and simplicity, the peculiar harmonies, mingling\r\nminor and major keys together in a most charming way. Although a lyric\r\nwriter, he has written a piano sonata, three sonatas for violin and\r\npiano, and a most effective piano concerto, all of which show brilliancy\r\nand keen dramatic sense. His _Holberg Suite_ for piano and the _Elegiac_\r\nmelodies and the Norwegian theme for strings are full of rich, romantic\r\nfeeling. As a song writer, too, Grieg ranks very high.\r\n\r\nSome of the other Norwegians are: Johan Severan Svendsen (1840–1911),\r\nWagnerian in feeling yet writing his compositions with strong Norwegian\r\ncolor. Christian Sinding (1856), whose _Rustling of Spring_ you will\r\nremember, puts on the national costume of his native Norway in his\r\nwritings, although educated in Germany. Among others are Johan Selmer,\r\nGerhard Schjelderup and Madam Agathe Backer-Gröndahl, pianist-composer\r\nof decided charm.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind, the “Swedish Nightingale” (1820–1887) and Christine Nilsson\r\n(1843–1921), did much to bring Norse folk songs to the attention of the\r\nworld. These melodies were very much admired because they reflected the\r\ncoolness and the sadness of the land of the fiords.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DENMARK\r\n\r\nWe now go to the land of Buxtehude, the celebrated organist of Lübeck.\r\nAlthough J. Hartmann, director of the Conservatory of Copenhagen, has\r\nbeen called “The Father of Danish Music,” the first great composer was\r\nNiels Wilhelm Gade (1817–1890). He started as a maker of instruments,\r\nbecame a member of the Royal Orchestra at Copenhagen and won a prize\r\nwith his first work, an orchestral overture, _Echoes from Ossian_.\r\nMendelssohn played this in Leipsic and from this time on they were great\r\nfriends. Gade succeeded him as conductor of the Gewandhaus Concerts in\r\nLeipsic; in 1848, he returned to Copenhagen and held many positions,\r\namong which was court chapel master. Gade’s works were a mixture of the\r\nRomantic and the Classic Schools to which he added Danish qualities. He\r\nwrote well in symphonic style and in choruses, songs and piano pieces.\r\n\r\nAmong others were Asger Hamerik (1843), a pupil of Von Bülow and\r\nBerlioz, Otto Malling (1848–1915); Ludwig Theodor Schytte (1850–1909), a\r\nstudent of Gade and Liszt, who lived for a long time in Germany, where\r\nhe died. His short piano pieces are classics for all young piano\r\nstudents. Edward Lassen, Victor Emanuel Bendix and August Enna are other\r\nwell known Danes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SWEDEN\r\n\r\nThe first of the romantic writers in Sweden is Anders Hallen (1846). His\r\nmusic was massive and Wagnerian in effect, showing the somberness of the\r\ninfluence of his native province Bohuslän. He had a great sense of\r\nmelody and his marches and dances in his native style are happy and\r\ndelightful. Emil Sjögren (1853–1918) was called “The Schumann of the\r\nNorth,” for he wrote mostly piano pieces, a beautiful violin sonata and\r\nvocal solos and showed a great deal of charm and warmth of feeling. We\r\nmight add to this list Wilhelm Stenhammar, who wrote operas and choral\r\nworks, and Hugo Alfven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 MUSIC IN THE COUNTRY OF LAKES—FINLAND\r\n\r\nFinland, “the land of a thousand lakes,” and of virgin forests and\r\nmeadows, has always been a country of great beauty and sadness.\r\n\r\nOf all her composers, Jan Sibelius is the greatest (1865). He was\r\neducated as a lawyer but being a violinist, he decided to pursue a\r\nmusical career. He is remarkable as a writer of symphonic poems, and\r\nsings with compelling beauty the legends of his country taken from _The\r\nKalevala_, the epic poem which ranks with the greatest legendary poems\r\nof all times. Besides _The Kalevala_ are the short lyrics or Kanteletar,\r\nsung to the lute of steel strings, which is called _The Kantele_. These\r\nlegends and songs are always a source of great joy to the Finns and were\r\nfirst arranged by Elias Lönnrot in the early part of the 19th century.\r\nThe symphonic poems of Sibelius are _Karelia_, _The Swan of Tuonela_ and\r\n_Lemminkäinen_ from _The Kalevala_. He wrote other compositions, of\r\ncourse, including cantatas and ballads and string quartets and choruses.\r\nHis _Finlandia_ is a true picture of the Finnish people and country, and\r\nhis _Fourth Symphony_ is one of the 20th century’s monumental works.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in his Finnish songs a peculiar five-four\r\nrhythm which is haunting and fascinating. He was recognized as a great\r\nmusician, for he is the only one of this time who drew a government\r\npension. In 1914, Sibelius was in America for the Norfolk Festival for\r\nwhich he had written a special work, a symphonic poem, _Aalottaret_\r\n(Daughter of the Ocean). At the same time Yale University conferred a\r\ndegree upon him. He lives far north in Finland away from cities,\r\nsurrounded for many months of the year by great snow fields.\r\n\r\nSelim Palmgren is a writer of charming piano pieces who, in 1924, was\r\nteacher at the Eastman Conservatory in Rochester, New York.\r\n\r\nOther composers in Finland were Bernard Crusell (1775–1838), and\r\nFrederick Pacius (who was born in Hamburg in 1809 and died in\r\nHelsingfors in 1891), the Father of Finnish Music and the author of the\r\nNational Hymn _Wartland_ and _Suomis Song_ (Suomi means Finland). He was\r\na violinist, a follower of Spohr and composed a great many musical\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nAmong others is Armas Järnefelt (1864), an orchestral conductor and\r\ncomposer living in Stockholm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SPAIN—THE LAND OF THE FANDANGO\r\n\r\nOne of the most adventurous and likeable people that we have met in the\r\nhistory of music is Isaac Albeniz (1860–1909). He was born in Spain and\r\nstarted his travels when he was a few days old. He ran away from home\r\nwhen he was nine years old and toured about, making money by playing the\r\npiano. He loved travel and his life as a young man is a series of\r\nrunnings-away-and-being-brought-back. He became a very great pianist and\r\nAlphonso XII was so pleased with his playing and so delighted with his\r\npersonality, that at fifteen he was granted a pension and being free\r\nfrom money worry, he realized the dream of his life and went to see\r\nFranz Liszt.\r\n\r\nHe became a player approaching Von Bülow and Rubinstein in skill.\r\n\r\nHe kept composing attractive and popular Spanish tunes using the rich,\r\nrhythmic Spanish folk songs in rather new and modern harmony. He finally\r\ndecided to give up his life as a popular composer and brilliant pianist,\r\nand settled down to serious composition. The next thirty pieces took him\r\nlonger to write than his four hundred popular songs!\r\n\r\nIn 1893 he went to Paris in a most wonderful period, and met Debussy,\r\nFauré, Duparc and d’Indy.\r\n\r\nHis most important composition is _Iberia_, a collection of twelve\r\nSpanish piano pieces. Among his other things are _Serenade_, _Orientale_\r\nand _Aragonaise_, all in Spanish dress.\r\n\r\nHe was a very rare personality with a rich nature, exuberant, happy and\r\nmerry, even until his death.\r\n\r\nHe was the real center of Spanish music and influenced all who came\r\nafter him. He was to Spain what Grieg was to Norway, Chopin to Poland,\r\nMoussorgsky to Russia, and Dvorak to Bohemia or Czecho-Slovakia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ENRIQUE GRANADOS\r\n\r\nFollowing Albeniz, was another great Spaniard, Enrique Granados\r\n(1867–1916), who was born in Lérida, Spain, and met a tragic death on a\r\ntransport in the English Channel during the World War. Unlike Albeniz,\r\nhe did not write in a modern vein, but rather in the accustomed\r\nharmonies. He was more Spanish for this reason than Albeniz, less\r\noriginal and without the great charm of the other master.\r\n\r\nThe only opera in Spanish that has ever been sung at the Metropolitan\r\nOpera House was his _Goyescas_ in 1916. The principal rôle was sung by\r\nAnna Fitziu. First he wrote this as an opera in 1899. Later he made a\r\npiano version of it, very much like a suite, which was played with great\r\nsuccess by Ernest Schelling. He also wrote symphonic poems among which\r\nwas _Dante_ with a vocal part, sung by Sophie Braslau, in 1915, with the\r\nChicago Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nHe is one of Spain’s great sons and the rich and sincere national spirit\r\nwhich he put into his music makes him beloved of his compatriots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n                             America Enters\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long ago we visited the medieval castle of Amboise in Touraine,\r\nFrance, for the 400th celebration of the birth of the French poet,\r\nRonsard. (Chapter XI.) A program of madrigals by Jannequin, Costeley,\r\nLassus and others who had used Ronsard’s poems as texts, was given in\r\nthe room where the poet himself had entertained his friends. We were\r\nimpressed by the beauty of the old castle and the aged towers and\r\nramparts. It was here that we realized the meaning of TRADITION!\r\n\r\nThe peasant children passing under the watch tower in the village below\r\nthe castle are reminded daily of a past replete with history and\r\nromance! They know without having been taught that here their poet\r\nPierre de Ronsard and the Italian painter, Leonardo da Vinci, lived,\r\nworked and died. This watch tower was old when Columbus discovered\r\nAmerica!\r\n\r\nThe lack of tradition, this unconscious knowing of the past, that Europe\r\nhas in abundance is often held up to us in America as a serious loss in\r\nour art life. The question came to us: Is there nothing in our country\r\nto make up for the absence of this historical and romantic background?\r\n\r\nAs in a motion picture, there passed before our minds the Grand Canyon\r\nof Arizona, the Rocky Mountains, the snow-capped peaks of the Pacific\r\nslope, the Columbia River, the Mississippi and the Hudson, Golden Gate\r\nof California, Niagara Falls, and the Plains, lonesome stretches of sand\r\nand sage-brush vast as the sea! Surely such wondrous beauty should\r\ninspire artists to create great works.\r\n\r\nBut this is a day of cities, aeroplanes, automobiles, speed and unrest,\r\nwhen the mind rules instead of the heart! And we must “watch our step”\r\nor we will become the slaves of this Age of Invention instead of being\r\nthe masters. All this is reflected in our art life and we must guard our\r\ncreative talent if we would rank with European nations in the making of\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nWe already rank with them in performing it, and in organizations, such\r\nas our orchestras, opera houses, chamber music organizations, music\r\nschools, music settlements, music club activities, community singing,\r\nglee clubs, oratorio societies, and amateur orchestras. America needs\r\nmusic and loves it as never before. Perhaps out of all this music study\r\nand concert-giving in addition to what might be done with the radio and\r\nmechanical instruments, which are now making records of the world’s\r\nfinest compositions, there will come a race of real music lovers and\r\ncreators. They will study our national traits and will unite them with\r\nthe earnest work of American composers of today and yesterday; they will\r\nopen their minds to the natural beauties of nature; they will try to\r\nraise the standard of the general public, and they will make music in\r\nAmerica grow. May every American reader take this to heart!\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on “National Portraits in Folk Music” we told you that we\r\nhave no definite traits in our music that could be called national\r\nbecause this country was settled by people of many different\r\nnationalities and races. All these peoples brought to the “Promised\r\nLand” their customs and traditions, their song and story world. We can\r\nstill see traces in the present generation of the early settlers: New\r\nEngland and the South are Anglo-Saxon; Louisiana and the northern\r\nborder, French; California, Spanish; New York and Pennsylvania, Dutch;\r\nMinnesota, Scandinavian; Missouri and Wisconsin, German. Besides, the\r\nItalians, Irish, Russians and Germans have settled in all parts of this\r\nhuge “melting pot”!\r\n\r\nThere is however an _Americanism_ that is hard to define, but is the\r\nresult of the intermingling of all nationalities. It is the spirit of\r\nthe pioneer that sent our forefathers, foreigners many, across the\r\nplains in the “covered wagon”; the spirit of youth and enthusiasm of a\r\ncountry still new; the spirit that works out gigantic commercial\r\nproblems and miraculous inventions with the same fervor with which an\r\nartist creates; it is the spirit of an inspired sculptor before the\r\nunfinished block of marble. All of which must combine in our music\r\nbefore we can create a national idiom.\r\n\r\nBut we must go back and travel with you the rocky road,—“Music in\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PILGRIMS AND PURITANS\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims and Puritans who reached our “stern and rock-bound coast”\r\nearly in the 17th century did not approve of music, except for the\r\nsinging of five hymn tunes! The first book printed in America was the\r\n_Bay Psalm Book_ (1640) at Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its heading was:\r\n\r\n“The Psalmes in Metre: Faithfully translated for the Use, Edification,\r\nand comfort of the Saints in publick and private, especially in New\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\n“Spiritual Songs” were not at first included, but later about fifty\r\nEnglish hymn tunes, sung in unison were used. It went into many\r\neditions, found its way to England and Scotland, and was preferred by\r\nmany to all others.\r\n\r\nMusic was forbidden as a trade in New England and a dancing master was\r\nfined for trying to start a class. The early settlers thought “to sing\r\nman’s melody is only a vain show of art” and objected to tunes because\r\n“they are inspired”! So the Puritans were forbidden to invent new tunes.\r\nYou can understand that an art could not easily flourish in such stony\r\nground.\r\n\r\nMr. Oscar G. Sonneck, an authority on the history of American music,\r\nsays in his book, _Early Concert-life in America_: “The Puritans, the\r\nPilgrims, the Irish, the Dutch, the Germans, the Swedes, the Cavaliers\r\nof Maryland and Virginia and the Huguenots of the South may have been\r\nzealots, adventurers, beggars, spendthrifts, fugitives from justice,\r\nconvicts, but barbarians they certainly were not.... Possibly, or even\r\nprobably, music was at an extremely low ebb, but this would neither\r\nprove that the early settlers were hopelessly unmusical nor that they\r\nlacked interest in the art of ‘sweet conchord.’... What inducements had\r\na handful of people, spread over so vast an area, struggling for an\r\nexistence, surrounded by virgin forests, fighting the Redman, and\r\nquarreling amongst themselves, to offer to musicians? We may rest\r\nassured that even Geoffrey Stafford, ‘lute and fiddle maker’ by trade\r\nand ruffian by instinct, would have preferred more lucrative climes and\r\ngracefully declined the patronage of musical Governor Fletcher had he\r\nnot been deported in 1691 to Massachusetts by order of his Majesty King\r\nWilliam, along with a batch of two hundred other Anglo-Saxon convicts.\r\n\r\n“There were no musicians by trade, ... and as the early settlers were\r\nnot unlike other human beings in having voices, we may take it for\r\ngranted that they used them not only in church, but at home, in the\r\nfields, in the taverns, exactly as they would have done in Europe and\r\nfor the same kind of music as far as their memory or their supply of\r\nbooks carried them. That the latter, generally speaking, cannot have\r\nbeen very large, goes without saying.... Instruments were to be found in\r\nthe homes of the wealthy merchants of the North and in the homes of the\r\nstill more pleasure seeking planters of the South. Indeed, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the nearest approach to a musical atmosphere ... was\r\nto be found in the South rather than in the North. Still, we might call\r\nthe period until about 1720 the primitive period in our musical history.\r\n\r\n“After 1720 we notice a steadily growing number of musicians who sought\r\ntheir fortunes in the Colonies, an increasing desire for organs, flutes,\r\nguitars, violins, harpsichords, the establishment of ‘singing-schools,’\r\nan improvement in church music, the signs of a budding music trade from\r\nruled music paper to sonatas and concertos, the advent of music\r\nengravers, publishers and manufacturers of instruments, the tentative\r\nefforts to give English opera a home in America, the introduction of\r\npublic concerts, in short the beginnings of what may properly be termed\r\nthe formative period in our musical history, running from 1720 until\r\nabout 1800.”\r\n\r\nThe first organ in America came from London in 1713 for the Episcopal\r\nChurch of Boston, but it remained unpacked for seven months, as many\r\nobjected to an organ at divine services. The fate of music hung in the\r\nbalance with the Puritans but fortunately it won out.\r\n\r\nRev. James Lyon, a graduate of Princeton University, “Patriot, preacher\r\nand psalmodist,” published in 1792 a collection of psalms, anthems and\r\nhymns, called _Urania_, to which he added a few of his own compositions\r\nand a dozen or so pages of instructions for his singing-school in\r\nPhiladelphia. Other collections followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM BILLINGS\r\n\r\nWilliam Billings, born in Boston, in 1746, was one of our first\r\ncomposers. He took his music seriously, was self-taught, and wrote his\r\nfirst music on leather with chalk, in the tannery where he worked. He\r\nwas queer and was laughed at, but he was so sincere in his love of music\r\nthat he won friends who encouraged him to publish (in 1770) a new\r\npsalm-book, _The New England Psalm Singer, or American Chorister_. As\r\nsinging-schools had been formed to learn how to read and to sing the\r\nchurch music, the time was ripe for more difficult music than had been\r\nallowed by the Pilgrim Fathers. Billings, although he knew nothing about\r\nit, tried some experiments in counterpoint, and introduced some\r\n“fugue-tunes,” which really were not fugues at all, into his hymns. That\r\nhe enjoyed the result may be seen from this quotation: “It has more than\r\ntwenty times the power of the old slow tunes, each part straining for\r\nmastery and victory, the audience entertained and delighted, ...\r\nsometimes declaring for one part, and sometimes for another. Now the\r\nsolemn bass demands their attention, next the manly tenor; now the lofty\r\ncounter, now the volatile treble. Now there; now here again, O ecstatic!\r\nRush on, you sons of harmony!”\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his book we find the first American musical\r\ndeclaration of independence, for he states that Nature and not Knowledge\r\nmust inspire thought, and that “it is best for every composer to be his\r\nown carver.” But later he showed a bigness of spirit, for he writes\r\nhumbly: “Kind Reader, no doubt you remember that about ten years ago I\r\npublished a book ... and truly a most masterly performance I then\r\nthought it to be. How lavish was I of encomiums (praise) on this my\r\ninfant production!... I have discovered that many of the pieces were not\r\nworth my printing or your inspection.”\r\n\r\nThis second book was called _Billings’ Best_ because it became very\r\npopular. Many of his tunes were sung around the camp-fires of the\r\nRevolutionary Army, and even the Continental fifers played one of his\r\nairs. He was a fiery patriot, and when Boston was occupied by the\r\nBritish, he paraphrased the 137th Psalm, and wrote:\r\n\r\n                By the rivers of Watertown, we sat down;\r\n                Yea, we wept as we remembered Boston!\r\n\r\nThis was the time when the young Mozart was astonishing the courts of\r\nEurope, and the Colossus Beethoven was born!\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was prejudice against instrumental music in New\r\nEngland, so the first concerts gave selections from Handel’s _Messiah_\r\nand Haydn’s _Creation_, which after all were oratorios.\r\n\r\nLater William Billings’ singing class in Stoughton, Massachusetts,\r\nfounded in 1774 to study and perform psalm tunes and oratorios became\r\nthe Stoughton Musical Society in 1786 and was looked upon as the\r\nearliest musical organization in America. It is still in existence. But\r\nMr. Sonneck discovered that in Charleston, South Carolina, the St.\r\nCecilia Society was founded twenty-four years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe next important society founded was the Boston Handel and Haydn. It\r\nis still alive and has had great influence on musical life not only in\r\nits native city but throughout America. After the war of 1812, a musical\r\njubilee was held in Boston. It was so successful, that a society was\r\nformed from the fifty members of the Park Street Church choir and others\r\ninterested in “cultivating and improving a correct taste in the\r\nperformance of sacred music.” This was the Handel and Haydn, which has\r\nlived up to its intention. The young society showed American spirit and\r\nasked Beethoven to write a work for it! The Colossus was pleased with\r\nthis recognition from over the seas, and in one of his note books had\r\nwritten “The oratorio for Boston.”\r\n\r\n\r\n               MUSIC IN BENJAMIN FRANKLIN’S PHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\nAlthough New England was the cradle of music, Philadelphia was the art\r\ncenter in the second half of the 18th century, and went ahead of Boston\r\nin culture, because it was not held down by Puritan laws. In 1741\r\nBenjamin Franklin published Dr. Watt’s hymns, and later invented an\r\ninstrument called the harmonica,—not the little mouthorgan. Franklin’s\r\ninstrument was a set of thirty-five circular glasses arranged on a\r\ncentral rod, tuned to play three octaves and enclosed in a case that\r\nlooked like a spinet. There is one in New York City at the Metropolitan\r\nMuseum of Art. Try rubbing the edge of your tumbler with a moist finger\r\nand you will hear the sound this instrument made.\r\n\r\nIn Goldsmith’s _Vicar of Wakefield_, we read that fashionable ladies\r\n“would talk of nothing but ... pictures, taste, Shakespeare and the\r\n_musical glasses_.” These had been invented by no less a person than\r\nGluck! He played a concerto on twenty-six drinking glasses, accompanied\r\nwith “the whole band,” and claimed he could play anything that could be\r\nperformed on a violin or harpsichord! It was after hearing them in\r\nLondon, that Franklin improved upon them and made his harmonica.\r\n\r\n\r\n           FRANCIS HOPKINSON, “FIRST AMERICAN POET-COMPOSER”\r\n\r\nOn whom should fall the title of first American composer? William\r\nBillings was born before Francis Hopkinson (1757–1791), but in 1759,\r\nHopkinson wrote a secular song, _My Days Have Been so Wondrous Free_,\r\neleven years before Billings’ _New England Psalm Singer_ saw the light\r\nof day. Billings was the product of New England Psalmody, was an uncouth\r\nself-taught son of the people. Hopkinson was born in Philadelphia, was a\r\ncollege bred man, lawyer, poet, essayist, patriot, composer, harpsichord\r\nplayer, organist, and inventor.\r\n\r\nHe was an intimate friend of Franklin, Washington, Jefferson and Joseph\r\nBonaparte; a member of the Continental Congress, and one of the signers\r\nof the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nHe wrote in the style of Carey and Dr. Arne in England, and we have\r\neight songs dedicated to “His Excellency George Washington, Esquire,”\r\nand in the dedication Hopkinson says: “With respect to this work ... I\r\ncan only say that it is such as a lover, not a master, of the arts can\r\nfurnish.”\r\n\r\n_The Beggar’s Opera_ was presented in New York in 1750 and in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1759. In 1787, Washington went to a puppet opera in\r\nPhiladelphia. In 1801 selections from Handel’s _Messiah_ were given in\r\nthe hall of the University of Pennsylvania. We hear of Francis\r\nHopkinson’s playing on the first organ in Christ Church, Philadelphia,\r\nand as early as 1749, John Beals, a “musick-master from London” comes to\r\nthe Quaker city to teach “violin, hautboy, (oboe) flute and dulcimer,”\r\nand advertises as ready to play for balls and entertainments. So we see\r\nPhiladelphia growing up rapidly, with opera, oratorio, instrumental\r\nmusic and music teachers!\r\n\r\nFranklin and Washington often commented on the unusually fine music that\r\nthey heard in the town of Bethlehem (Pennsylvania). Today the early\r\nappreciation of music is continued in the yearly Bach Festival held in\r\nthe Moravian Church under the direction of Frederick Wolle. Musicians\r\nfrom everywhere attend these remarkable performances at Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nTrinity Church in New York had an organ in 1741, although there were\r\nconcerts at least ten years earlier. An English schoolmaster, William\r\nTuckey, was the first to train choir boys for the services about 1756.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EARLY OPERA\r\n\r\nWe should hardly expect to find French and Italian operas in America\r\nbefore the 1800s, but way down south in New Orleans in 1791, a troupe\r\nwas giving performances of parts of operas and _vaudeville_, and perhaps\r\nan occasional opera of Grétry or Boieldieu. From 1810, the company\r\nperformed opera regularly, and until recently, there was French opera in\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\nEvery time an opera company came to New York, _The Beggar’s Opera_ was\r\nplayed, along with other _Ballad-Operas_. In 1796, there were two operas\r\nby Americans, Benjamin Carr and Pellisier, but all details have been\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nMr. Elson says, “At the beginning of the 19th century Charleston and\r\nBaltimore entered the operatic field, and travelling troupes came into\r\nexistence, making short circuits from New York through the three large\r\ncities, but avoiding Boston, which was wholly given over to Handel,\r\nHaydn, and psalms.”\r\n\r\nThe first time that New York heard _Home, Sweet Home_ was on November\r\n12, 1823, in a melodrama by John Howard Payne, _Clari, the Maid of\r\nMilan_. Payne, an American, wrote the words, and Henry Carey, the\r\nEnglish composer, the music.\r\n\r\nThe first grand opera that New York heard was Weber’s _Der Freischütz_.\r\nIt was probably a very crude performance as they made many changes to\r\nsuit public taste, but it was a great success, especially the\r\nmelodramatic scenes.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, Manuel Garcia, a Spanish tenor, came to New York with his\r\nfamily of singers, including his daughter, who afterwards became the\r\nfamous Mme. Malibran. He gave _The Barber of Seville_ and ten other\r\nItalian operas which were a revelation to the new world. They called\r\nGarcia the “Musical Columbus.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, New York was never without some opera venture. One company\r\nfollowed another, and although the people seemed to enjoy the novelty\r\nfor a while, they never gave it whole-souled patronage.\r\n\r\nThe first opera written (1845) by an American was _Leonora_ by William\r\nH. Fry (1813–1864). It was performed in Philadelphia, and thirteen years\r\nlater in New York. It was in the Balfe and Donizetti style. He composed\r\nsymphonies and wrote for the New York _Tribune_ on musical subjects, and\r\ndid much to make people realize the benefit of music.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 George Bristow composed the second American opera, _Rip Van\r\nWinkle_. He and Fry started a crusade against the German musicians who\r\nhad come over to America after the revolution of 1848, fearing that they\r\nwould extinguish the feeble American flame of composing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ORCHESTRAS\r\n\r\nThe father of American orchestras was a German oboe player, Gottlieb\r\nGraupner. When Haydn went to London to direct the largest orchestra\r\nformed, up to that time, Graupner played with him. Graupner went to\r\nBoston (1799), and at once formed the first American orchestra. About\r\nthe same time in New York, a society called the “Euterpian” was founded;\r\nit gave one concert a year for thirty years! From 1820 to 1857 there was\r\nin Philadelphia, a “Musical Fund Society”; its object was to improve\r\nmusical taste and to help needy musicians. It gave the first performance\r\nin America of Beethoven’s _First Symphony_, as well as choral works.\r\n\r\nIn Boston the last concert of the Philharmonic Orchestra as Graupner’s\r\nband was called, took place in 1824, and another more important\r\norchestra was formed sixteen years later. Before the Boston Symphony\r\ncame, an orchestra was given to the city by the Harvard Musical\r\nAssociation. It was controlled by a group of people brought up on\r\nHandel, Haydn and Beethoven, who would not permit their idols to be\r\nreplaced by such anarchists as Berlioz and Wagner! Many of the young\r\nforeign orchestral players wanted the new works by the “anarchists,” so\r\nthey seceded from the Harvard Musical Association and called themselves\r\nthe Philharmonic Society. As there were not enough people interested in\r\nclassical music to support two orchestras they were soon replaced by the\r\nBoston Symphony Orchestra, which was put on a permanent basis by Colonel\r\nHenry L. Higginson, who founded it and supported it during his lifetime.\r\nGeorg Henschel conducted the first concert in 1881, and the Boston\r\nSymphony Orchestra has always been one of the greatest musical\r\ninstitutions in America. The conductors have been Wilhelm Gericke,\r\nArthur Nikisch, Max Fiedler, Karl Muck, Henri Rabaud, Pierre Monteux,\r\nand Serge Koussevitzky.\r\n\r\nThe New York Philharmonic Society, born in 1842, was founded through the\r\nefforts of a violinist, Uriah Hill, its first conductor, and it always\r\ngave works of value. Among its conductors have been: Theodore Thomas,\r\nDr. Leopold Damrosch, Anton Seidl, Walter Damrosch, Emil Paur, Wassili\r\nSafonoff, Henry Hadley, Gustav Mahler, Theodore Spiering, Josef\r\nStransky, Willem Mengelberg, Willem van Hoogstraten, Wilhelm\r\nFurtwängler, and Arturo Toscanini, a genius among conductors.\r\n\r\nTheodore Thomas (1835–1905), who was born in Germany but came to this\r\ncountry at the age of ten, was the first great musician to live in\r\nAmerica and to advance the condition and standards. He gave this country\r\nits first taste for the aristocrat of music, chamber music, and with\r\nWilliam Mason, the pianist, presented Schumann and Brahms to America.\r\nThey were young radicals, and wanted to make everybody love the music\r\nthey loved. Thomas introduced Wagner, too, and can’t you imagine the\r\ndiscussions the Wizard’s music raised when even Europe was torn in its\r\nopinions of the master innovator? Franz Liszt sent Thomas parts of the\r\nscores which the young conductor tried out even before they had been\r\nplayed in Europe. He had an orchestra of his own in 1864 that ran a\r\nclose race with the Philharmonic Society in New York, and he took it out\r\non tour, giving other cities the chance to hear orchestral music.\r\nTheodore Thomas was a musical missionary! In 1877 and 1879 he was\r\nconductor of the New York Philharmonic, and in 1890 the Chicago\r\nOrchestra was formed where he remained until his death in 1905.\r\nFrederick Stock followed Thomas, and the Chicago Orchestra has helped to\r\ncultivate music in the Middle West.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DAMROSCH FAMILY\r\n\r\nIn 1871, a German conductor, destined to develop music came to New York\r\nand after a few months, sent for his family. This was Dr. Leopold\r\nDamrosch, who founded the Oratorio Society (1873), and the New York\r\nSymphony Society (1877), which was merged with the Philharmonic in 1928.\r\nThe Oratorio Society, for many years directed by Walter Damrosch, is\r\ntoday conducted by a gifted American, Albert Stoessel.\r\n\r\nIn the early years feeling ran high between the followers of Theodore\r\nThomas and Dr. Damrosch, and many stories are told of the rivalry in\r\nplaying new European scores. One of Damrosch’s greatest early triumphs\r\nwas the performance of Berlioz’s _Damnation of Faust_. He also gave the\r\nfirst performance of Brahms’ First Symphony.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Dr. Damrosch’s young son, Walter, was playing second\r\nviolin, learning through experience, his father’s profession, and he is\r\ntoday the conductor of the New York Symphony Society, and a commanding\r\nfigure in America.\r\n\r\nDr. Damrosch was also a pioneer in introducing Wagner to us. Two years\r\nafter the Metropolitan Opera House was built (1882), Dr. Damrosch was\r\nmade director and conductor of German opera. He imported some of the\r\ngreat Wagnerian singers, Madame Materna, Marianne Brandt, Mme.\r\nSeidl-Kraus, Anton Schott, and others. Wagner opera had come to stay.\r\nAfter a short illness, Dr. Damrosch died (1885) and his son Walter, then\r\nnineteen years of age, fell heir to the position of conductor of German\r\nopera at the Metropolitan Opera House, and of the Oratorio Society.\r\nThrough Walter Damrosch’s efforts, Lilli Lehmann, the foremost Wagnerian\r\nsinger, was engaged for the Metropolitan; he also engaged Emil Fischer,\r\nbasso, Max Alvary, tenor, Anton Seidl, conductor, and Mme. Lillian\r\nNordica (Lillian Norton), one of the first Americans at the\r\nMetropolitan.\r\n\r\nWalter Damrosch composed the popular American song, _Danny Deever_ on\r\nthe poem by Rudyard Kipling. One never can think of this stirring song,\r\nwithout remembering David Bispham, who sang it into fame. Bispham was\r\nanother native, who was for years a member of the Metropolitan Opera\r\nCompany, and an oratorio singer. Damrosch is the composer of two grand\r\noperas, _The Scarlet Letter_ on a text from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel,\r\nand _Cyrano de Bergerac_, of Edmond Rostand’s, made into a libretto by\r\nW. J. Henderson. He also wrote incidental music to three Greek Tragedies\r\n_Iphigenia in Aulis_, _Medea_ and _Electra_, first performed in the open\r\nair theatre of the University of California, in Berkeley, by Margaret\r\nAnglin and her company.\r\n\r\nDamrosch married the daughter of James G. Blaine in 1890, and soon\r\nafter, he started an opera venture which for several years visited the\r\nlarge cities and brought Wagner into many places where his music had\r\nbeen merely a hearsay. He has been a pioneer in championing the cause of\r\nmodern composers, and many well known European works have had their\r\nfirst American performances at his New York Symphony concerts.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank Damrosch, older brother of Walter, is an important educator,\r\nthe head of the Institute of Musical Art, and was once conductor of the\r\nOratorio Society, and of the “Musical Art Society” in which were sung\r\nunaccompanied all the lovely motets and madrigals of Palestrina, Lassus,\r\nand many others. Dr. Frank Damrosch also founded the People’s Choral\r\nUnion in which working men and women were taught singing and became\r\nmembers of a chorus of twelve hundred voices which performed the classic\r\noratorios. He also founded the Young People’s Concerts, which have\r\nbrought to young people of New York the finest music the world has\r\nproduced. For several years, Mr. Walter Damrosch has had these in\r\ncharge, and his talks explaining the works performed are quite as\r\nenjoyable as the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MASON FAMILY\r\n\r\nAnother famous family in American music is the Mason family, dating back\r\nto Lowell Mason (1792–1872) who was born at Medfield, Massachusetts. His\r\nprincipal work was a collection of hymn tunes which he harmonized, and\r\nwon him the title of “Father of American Church Music.” He was president\r\nand conductor of the Handel and Haydn Society, and was a born teacher.\r\nHe travelled from one society to another in distant cities, training\r\nchoruses, giving encouragement and advice. He moved to New York in 1851.\r\n\r\nLowell Mason’s third son, Dr. William Mason (1829–1908), was also a\r\npioneer. In his long life he saw music grow in America from crude\r\nbeginnings and reach a height that seems almost unbelievable, in one\r\nshort century. He not only heard but played, piano concertos with\r\norchestras as fine as those he found in Europe when he went to study\r\nwith Moscheles, Hauptmann, Richter, and Franz Liszt. Mason was one of\r\nthe young artists permitted to be a friend as well as a pupil of the\r\nkindly Music Master. Dr. Mason and Theodore Thomas were the first to\r\ngive chamber music concerts, and thus introduced many masterpieces of\r\nBrahms and Schumann, for as “modernists” they loved to bring new\r\ncompositions to the public. Dr. Mason in his whole-hearted love of his\r\nart, and sincerity and geniality is worthy of our deepest respect and\r\nadmiration. He composed about fifty piano pieces, and with W. S. B.\r\nMathews he arranged a piano method that was very popular and successful.\r\nWe feel sure that if you search in that old box of music that mother\r\nused to study, you will find a copy. No doubt she played his _Silver\r\nSpring_, _Reverie Poetique_ and _Danse Rustique_.\r\n\r\nDaniel Gregory Mason, one of the foremost composers, lecturers and\r\nwriters on music, is a nephew of Dr. William Mason. He was born in 1873,\r\nwas graduated from Harvard University in 1895. His compositions include\r\nmany works in large form, sonatas, a string quartet on Negro themes, a\r\npiano quartet, a symphony, a fugue for piano and orchestra, a Russian\r\nSong Cycle, piano pieces; Mr. Mason has written many valuable books on\r\nmusical subjects and on Music Appreciation, and is at present professor\r\nof music at Columbia University.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GOTTSCHALK—THE PICTURESQUE\r\n\r\nWe have been telling you about the composers in the northern part of the\r\nUnited States, and those who had come from Germany like the Damrosch\r\nfamily, but here is one composer and gifted pianist who brought a new\r\ncolor into American music. Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829–1869), born in\r\nNew Orleans, was the child of an English father and Creole mother, thus\r\nmixing Spanish, French and English blood. He was an infant prodigy; he\r\nplayed the piano at four, the organ at six, and at thirteen he went to\r\nParis to study. He was praised by Chopin, and appeared in concerts with\r\nHector Berlioz. He charmed everyone who heard him, and was the first\r\nAmerican pianist to receive European honors. The Infanta of Spain made a\r\ncake for him and a celebrated bull-fighter gave him a sword! He toured\r\nCuba and North and South America, giving more than a thousand concerts.\r\nBut the life was too hard on him and he died at the age of forty in Rio\r\nJaneiro, Brazil.\r\n\r\n_The Last Hope_, _Ojos Creollos_ (_Creole Eyes_), _Banjo_, _Souvenirs of\r\nAndalusia_ are among the most popular of his ninety compositions for\r\npiano, which showed the strong influence of life in Louisiana, his love\r\nof sunshiny Spain, and his study in France. Here we find rhythms closely\r\nrelated to ragtime and jazz, as well as the slow fascinating Spanish\r\ndance. Today his works are forgotten, but for many years they were\r\nplayed throughout the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN COLLINS FOSTER\r\n\r\nStephen Collins Foster (1826–1864), for whom we have claimed the right\r\nto be called a composer of folk songs, was born in Lawrenceville\r\n(Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania, on the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nDeclaration of Independence. The understanding he showed of the Negro\r\ncame to him because his parents were Southerners. He showed talent for\r\nmusic when he was very young, and taught himself to play the flageolet\r\nwhen he was seven years old. He was very self-willed and did not like\r\ndiscipline, so he taught himself practically all he knew of music. His\r\nfirst composition, _Tioga Waltz_ for four flutes, was written when he\r\nwas a school boy. It was first played in school, with Stephen in the\r\nlead. His first song, _Open thy Lattice, Love_, was published in 1842.\r\nFor several years, five boys met at the Foster home, and Stephen taught\r\nthem to sing part songs. He composed many pieces for them, among them\r\n_Oh, Susannah_, _Old Uncle Ned_ and _Old Black Joe_.\r\n\r\nAbout 1830, an actor, Thomas Rice, had the idea of dressing up like an\r\nold negro porter in Pittsburgh, from whom he borrowed the clothes, and\r\nsinging a song he had heard from a negro stage driver:\r\n\r\n             Turn about and wheel about, and do jist so,\r\n             And ebery time I turn about, I jump Jim Crow.\r\n\r\nThe song, accompanied by a dance, took the audience by storm, especially\r\nwhen the porter appeared on the stage, half dressed, and demanded his\r\nclothes, because the whistle of the steamboat had just blown and the old\r\nfellow had to “get back on the job.” So “Daddy” Rice became the father\r\nof “Negro Minstrels,” and travelled all over America and even England,\r\nsinging and dancing negro songs. A few years later Stephen Foster sent\r\nhis _Oh, Susannah_ to a travelling minstrel troupe, and the song took\r\n“like wild fire.” He decided to write songs as a profession, in spite of\r\nhis family who thought he had wasted time “fooling around” with music,\r\nand insisted on his going to work.\r\n\r\nWhile _Oh, Susannah_ is a “rollicking jingle,” _Old Uncle Ned_ is the\r\n“first of the pathetic negro songs that set Foster apart from his\r\ncontemporaries and gave him a place in musical history,” says Harold\r\nVincent Milligan. “In this type of song, universal in the appeal of its\r\nnaïve pathos he has never had an equal.”\r\n\r\nAnother claim he has as a folk song composer, is that he never studied\r\nas most people do who want to be composers. He knew very little about\r\nharmony and less of counterpoint, and his is “music that has come into\r\nexistence without the influence of conscious art, as a spontaneous\r\nutterance, filled with characteristic expression of the feelings of a\r\npeople.” (H. E. Krehbiel.) Perhaps he was right when he said that he was\r\nafraid that study would rob him of the gift of spontaneous melody that\r\nwas his to such a marked degree, because he was not naturally a student\r\nand might never have carried his studies far enough. At any rate we have\r\nevery reason to be grateful for the simple direct songs which are dear\r\nto us and as near to our hearts as any folk song of any age or country\r\nwhose author has been forgotten!\r\n\r\nHe was sweet-natured, irresponsible, refined and sensitive, but easily\r\ninfluenced. His publishers made $10,000 out of his songs, but he made\r\nlittle and spent much. He married in 1850, but the union was not happy.\r\n\r\nDuring his last years spent in New York, he was poverty-stricken and\r\nmiserable, and sold his songs, as soon as they were written, for a few\r\ndollars in order to live. It seems too bad to have to say that much of\r\nhis money and his life were squandered thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, his favorite poet was Edgar Allan Poe, whose life\r\nresembled his own in many sad details. He loved to go up and down in the\r\nBroadway stages, often thinking out his melodies as he rode. This\r\nreminds us of Walt Whitman, who rode up and down Fifth Avenue alongside\r\nhis friend Pete Dooley, the driver of the stage coach!\r\n\r\nStephen Foster died in New York in 1864 as the result of an accident in\r\nwhich he had severed an artery. He was saved from burial in Potter’s\r\nField, by the arrival of his brothers and his wife, and he was buried in\r\nPittsburgh beside his parents whom he had immortalized in _The Old Folks\r\nat Home_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n                          America Comes of Age\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years Boston was a center of musical life.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Civil War a school was well under way in New\r\nEngland, which we might call the classical period of American music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               B. J. LANG\r\n\r\nAlthough Benjamin J. Lang (1837–1909) never published his compositions\r\nand never allowed them to be heard, he had much influence on Boston’s\r\nmusical life, having been conductor of the Handel and Haydn and of the\r\nSt. Cecilia societies, and the piano teacher of such musicians as Arthur\r\nFoote, William Apthorp, Ethelbert Nevin and Margaret Ruthven Lang, his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN KNOWLES PAINE\r\n\r\nJohn Knowles Paine (1839–1906), was the first professor of music at\r\nHarvard. In 1862, he gave his services without pay for a course of\r\nlectures on music, but they were not appreciated. When President Eliot\r\nbecame head of the University, music was made part of the college\r\ncurriculum with Professor Paine at the head of the department. In 1896,\r\nWalter R. Spalding was made assistant and since Professor Paine’s death\r\nhas been full professor.\r\n\r\nProfessor Paine was the first American who wrote an oratorio. _St.\r\nPeter_ was performed in 1873 in Portland, Maine, his birthplace. Next,\r\nhe wrote two symphonies, one of which was often played by Theodore\r\nThomas. Paine’s _Centennial Hymn_ opened the Philadelphia Exhibition,\r\nwith more success than the Wagner March, it is said.\r\n\r\nProfessor Paine was a pioneer in many fields of American composition and\r\ntaught American composers to follow in the lines of sincerity and\r\nhonesty which he carved out for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DUDLEY BUCK\r\n\r\nDudley Buck (1839–1909), was a noted organist, composer and teacher. He\r\ndid not remain in New England (Hartford, Connecticut) where he was born,\r\nbut held church positions in Chicago, Cincinnati, Brooklyn, and New\r\nYork, and was active in the musical life of these different cities. His\r\nprincipal works were anthems and hymns, still in use, music for the\r\norgan and valuable text-books, also many popular cantatas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEORGE CHADWICK\r\n\r\nGeorge Chadwick, one of our most important composers, was born in\r\nLowell, Massachusetts, in 1854. He studied in Germany with Reinecke,\r\nJadassohn and Rheinberger, three celebrated teachers who had more to do\r\nwith forming the taste of the American composers than any _American_\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nChadwick comes of a musical family. His musical life began as alto\r\nsinger in a Lawrence church choir, where later he blew the bellows of\r\nthe organ, but soon was promoted from blowing to playing it. He began\r\ncomposing while in High School. He was a student at the New England\r\nConservatory, founded in 1867, but was not allowed to study with the\r\nidea of becoming a professional. When he saw that he would receive no\r\nfurther help from his father toward music-training, the young musician\r\nof twenty-two went to Michigan for a year. He taught music, conducted a\r\nchorus, gave organ recitals, saving enough to study in Leipsic.\r\nJadassohn told Louis Elson that Chadwick was the most brilliant student\r\nin his class.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, Chadwick returned to Boston where he has lived ever since. From\r\n1880 he was first, teacher, then musical director of the New England\r\nConservatory. Some of his pupils have become leaders in American\r\nmusic,—Horatio Parker, Arthur Whiting, J. Wallace Goodrich (organist),\r\nHenry K. Hadley and others.\r\n\r\nChadwick has composed more orchestral works than any other American. A\r\nlist of them includes three symphonies, a sinfonietta, six overtures,\r\nthree symphonic sketches for orchestra, a lyric sacred opera, _Judith_,\r\nmusic to the morality play _Everywoman_, much chamber music, many choral\r\nworks and about fifty songs, of which the best known is perhaps _Allah_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTHUR FOOTE\r\n\r\nArthur Foote (1853) is one of the few prominent composers whose training\r\nbears the label “made in America,” for he never studied abroad. He was\r\nborn in Salem, Massachusetts, and worked with Stephen Emery, a prominent\r\ntheory teacher. Foote was graduated from Harvard in 1874, where he\r\nstudied music in Professor Paine’s department. After organ study with B.\r\nJ. Lang, Foote became organist of the First Unitarian Church founded in\r\n1630, which post he filled from 1878 to 1910. This is doubtless the\r\nlongest record of an organist in one church in America. Foote has been\r\none of America’s finest teachers, and has influenced many, not only by\r\nhis teaching, but by his broad-minded criticism. His harmony text-book,\r\nwritten with Walter R. Spalding, is among the most valuable and reliable\r\nin the musical world.\r\n\r\nFoote has written scholarly and beautiful chamber and orchestral music\r\nwhich has placed him in the foremost ranks of American composers, but he\r\nhas won the hearts of the entire English-speaking world by two little\r\nsongs, _Irish Folk Song_ and _I’m Wearing Awa’_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HORATIO PARKER\r\n\r\nHoratio Parker (1863–1919) inherited his talent from his mother who\r\nplayed the organ in Newton, Massachusetts, but she had a hard time\r\ninteresting her son in music, for he disliked it very much. But at\r\nfourteen he had a change of heart going to the other extreme of having\r\nliterally to be dragged away from the instrument. He studied with Emery\r\nand Chadwick, and then went to Germany to work with Rheinberger. He was\r\norganist in several churches and in 1894 was made professor of music at\r\nYale University where he remained until his death.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, his best known work was performed in Trinity Church, New York.\r\nIt is an oratorio, _Hora Novissima_ (_The Last Hour_), on the old Latin\r\npoem by Bernard de Morlaix, with English translation by Parker’s mother\r\nalso the author of the librettos for two other of his oratorios. _Hora\r\nNovissima_, one of America’s most important works, has been performed\r\nmany times, not only in America, but it was the first American work\r\ngiven at the English Worcester Festival. It was so successful that Dr.\r\nParker received the commission to write for another English festival at\r\nHereford, and he composed _A Wanderer’s Psalm_. This was followed by\r\n_The Legend of St. Christopher_ which contains some of Parker’s most\r\nscholarly contrapuntal writing for chorus. As another result of\r\nEngland’s recognition of his music, Cambridge University conferred upon\r\nthe American composer the honorary degree of Doctor of Music.\r\n\r\nParker became famous for winning the prize of $10,000 offered by the\r\nMetropolitan Opera Company in 1911 for the best opera by an American.\r\nThis was _Mona_, a story of the Druids in Britain, for which Brian\r\nHooker, the American poet, wrote the libretto. In spite of the work\r\nhaving won the prize, it had no success with the public, and did not\r\noutlive its first season.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Parker and Hooker won another $10,000 prize offered by the\r\nNational Federation of Music Clubs, with an opera called _Fairyland_. It\r\nhas not seen the light of day since its performances in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FREDERICK CONVERSE\r\n\r\nFrederick Converse (1871), like many other Boston musicians, was\r\ngraduated from Harvard (1893), when his _Opus I_, a violin sonata, was\r\npublicly performed. After study with Chadwick, he went to Germany to\r\nRheinberger, returning in 1898, with his first symphony under his arm.\r\nHe is now living in Boston. Converse has written many orchestral and\r\nchamber music works, and has often set Keats, the English poet, or used\r\nhis writings as inspiration for his music,—_Festival of Pan_ and\r\n_Endymion’s Narrative_, two symphonic poems, and _La Belle Dame sans\r\nMerci_, a ballad for baritone voice and orchestra.\r\n\r\nConverse was the first of the present day Americans to have had an opera\r\n_The Pipe of Desire_ produced by the Metropolitan Opera Company (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TWO COLLEGE PROFESSORS\r\n\r\nDavid Stanley Smith, a native of Toledo, Ohio (1877), belongs to this\r\nNew England group, for he was graduated from Yale University and since\r\n1903 has been, first, instructor in the music department and later full\r\nprofessor. He has composed some excellent chamber music, and several of\r\nhis string quartets were played by the famous Kneisel Quartet\r\n(1886–1917) which organization has had a generous share in improving\r\nmusical taste in this country.\r\n\r\nEdward Burlingame Hill, born in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1872), is one\r\nof the professors of music at Harvard University. He has composed piano\r\npieces, songs, and orchestral works, and has written many articles on\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\r\n        MRS. H. H. A. BEACH PREPARES THE PATH FOR AMERICAN WOMEN\r\n\r\nOne of the most important composers of the New England group, is Mrs. H.\r\nH. A. Beach (1867). She was Amy Marcy Cheney, an astonishing little\r\nchild who before her second year sang forty tunes. Louis Elson tells\r\nthat at the age of two she was taken to a photographer, and just as he\r\nwas about to take the picture, she sang at the top of her voice, _See,\r\nthe Conquering Hero Comes!_ She could improvise like the old classic\r\nmasters, and could transpose Bach fugues from one key to another, at\r\nfourteen. When sixteen, she made her début as a pianist, and at\r\nseventeen she played piano concertos with the Boston Symphony Orchestra,\r\nalso with Theodore Thomas’ orchestra.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beach received her training in America. Her first work in large\r\nform was a mass sung in 1892 by the Handel and Haydn Society. She next\r\ncomposed a _scena_ and _aria_ for contralto and orchestra, sung with the\r\nNew York Symphony Society. It was the first work by a woman and an\r\nAmerican to be given at these concerts, which Walter Damrosch conducted.\r\n\r\nThe next year, Mrs. Beach was invited to write a work for the opening of\r\nthe woman’s building at the Chicago Columbian World’s Exposition. She\r\nhas two piano concertos and a symphony (_The Gaelic_) to her credit,\r\nalso a violin sonata, a quintet for flute and strings, many piano pieces\r\nand splendid songs among which must be mentioned _The Year’s at the\r\nSpring_, _June_, and _Ah, Love, but a Day_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beach prepared the way for other American women, not only by\r\nshowing that women could write seriously in big forms, but also by her\r\nsympathetic encouragement of talent and sincerity wherever she finds it.\r\n\r\nMargaret Ruthven Lang (1867), daughter of B. J. Lang, is also a Boston\r\ncomposer. _Irish Mother’s Lullaby_ is the best known of her many art\r\nsongs, in addition to which she has written an orchestral _Dramatic\r\nOverture_ which Arthur Nikisch played, when he was conductor of the\r\nBoston Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nAmong our best song writers are many women:—Harriet Ware, Gena\r\nBranscombe, Alice Barnett, Fay Foster, Eleanor Freer, Mana Zucca (who\r\nhas written also a piano concerto, and piano pieces), Rhea Silberta,\r\nEthel Glenn Hier (piano pieces and songs), Fannie Dillon (piano pieces\r\nand violin compositions), Mabel Wood Hill (songs, chamber music and an\r\narrangement of two preludes and fugues of Bach for string orchestra),\r\nLilly Strickland, Mabel Daniels, Katherine Ruth Heyman (songs, many of\r\nthem in old Greek modes, and a book, _Relation of Ultramodern Music to\r\nthe Archaic_), Rosalie Housman (songs, piano pieces and a complete\r\nHebrew Temple Service), Gertrude Ross, Mary Turner Salter, Florence Parr\r\nGere and Pearl Curran, writer of several popular successes. And although\r\nshe is not a composer of art songs, we must not forget Carrie Jacobs\r\nBond, whose _End of a Perfect Day_ has sold in the millions, and her\r\nsongs for little children have brought joy to many.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ONE OF OUR MOST SCHOLARLY MUSICIANS\r\n\r\nAnother Boston musician and composer, teacher of piano and composition\r\nis Arthur Whiting (1861), nephew of the organist and composer George\r\nWhiting. He has made a specialty of harpsichord music, and plays\r\ncharmingly on the little old instrument. Since 1895, he has lived in New\r\nYork City.\r\n\r\n\r\n         CHARLES MARTIN LOEFFLER—FIRST IMPRESSIONIST IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nCharles Martin Loeffler is a composer belonging to a different class\r\nfrom any of the Boston group just mentioned. Loeffler is French by\r\nbirth, as he was born in Alsace in 1861, French in his musical training\r\nand in his musical sympathies. For forty-two years he has lived in\r\nBoston, twenty of them at the second desk (next to the concertmaster) of\r\nthe Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was the first composer to write in\r\nthis country, the kind of music that existed at the end of the 19th\r\ncentury in France,—the music of Fauré, Dukas, Chausson and Debussy. The\r\nseed he planted did not fall on fertile soil, for all his fellow\r\nmusicians as well as the orchestral conductors, from whose hands the\r\npublic received its music, were Germans and German trained. They knew\r\ntheir “three B’s,” their Wagner and even the French Berlioz, but\r\nLoeffler brought something different, something disturbing, and was not\r\neasy to place. His music belonged neither to the classical nor to the\r\nromantic school.\r\n\r\nNot only in America did this new French music have a fight, but on its\r\nown ground in France was it misunderstood! But you have seen from\r\nMonteverde to Wagner that the path of true innovation never ran smooth!\r\n\r\nLoeffler’s work is original, the work of a musician completely master of\r\nthe modern orchestra and of modern harmony with its colorful and\r\nexpressive effects. Besides this there was a spirit that never before\r\nhad come into art. This was given the name of Impressionism, the getting\r\nof effects from objects, painted, or described in literature, without\r\nelaborate details. In music, composers who try to suggest to the hearer\r\nan image existing in their own minds are called Impressionists. This\r\nimage may be a thought, an emotion, a definite object, a poem, a\r\npicture, a beautiful tree, the grandeur of Niagara, any one of a\r\nthousand things that await the hand of the Alchemist-Musician to be\r\ntransmuted into tone.\r\n\r\nAll Loeffler’s compositions reflect this impressionism, and he was the\r\nfirst, but not the last of these poetic tone impressionists in America.\r\nHe is foremost a composer of symphonic poems: _La Mort de Tintagiles_\r\n(_The Death of Tintagiles_) after the play by Maurice Maeterlinck, _A\r\nPagan Poem_ after Virgil, _La Bonne Chanson_ (_The Good Song_) after\r\nVerlaine, _La Vilanelle du Diable_, _The Mystic Hour_ with male chorus,\r\n_Psalm 137_ with female chorus. He also wrote an eight part mixed\r\nchorus, _For One who Fell in Battle_. Other orchestral works include a\r\nsuite in four movements for violin and orchestra called _Les Veillées de\r\nl’Ukraine_ (_Evening Tales of the Ukraine_), concerto for ’cello and\r\norchestra, first played by Alwyn Schroeder with the Boston Symphony\r\nOrchestra, _Divertissement_ for violin and orchestra, and _Spanish\r\nDivertissement_ for saxophone and orchestra. There are also important\r\nworks for chamber music: two rhapsodies for clarinet, viola and piano,\r\nan octet for strings and two clarinets, a quintet and a quartet built on\r\nGregorian modes; and he has written a group of songs for medium voice\r\nand viola obligato with French texts by Verlaine and Beaudelaire, two\r\nimpressionist poets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE RED MAN ATTRACTS COMPOSERS\r\n\r\nThe next composer, Henry F. Gilbert, born in Somerville, Massachusetts\r\n(1868), brings us into an interesting field, the study of Negro and\r\nIndian folk music. After working with Edward MacDowell, Gilbert turned\r\nhis attention to a thorough investigation of Negro music, resulting in\r\norchestral works based on Negro themes such as, _American Humoresque_,\r\n_Comedy Overture on Negro Themes_, _American Dances_, _Negro Rhapsody_,\r\nand _The Dance in Place Congo_, a symphonic poem which was mounted as a\r\nballet at the Metropolitan Opera House (1918).\r\n\r\nGilbert tells that the _Comedy Overture_ was rescued from a wreck that\r\nwas to have been a Negro Opera, based on Joel Chandler Harris’ _Uncle\r\nRemus_. What a pity he did not complete it!\r\n\r\nThe _American Humoresque_ is based on old Negro minstrel tunes like _Zip\r\nCoon_, _Dixie_, and _Old Folks at Home_.\r\n\r\nGilbert was one of the founders of the Wa-Wan Press, established at\r\nNewton Center, Massachusetts, by Arthur Farwell. It was organized (1901)\r\nby composers in the interest of American compositions, and to study and\r\nencourage the use of Indian music. He died in 1928.\r\n\r\nArthur Farwell was born in St. Paul, Minnesota (1872). He attended\r\ncollege in Boston and studied music with Homer Norris (1860–1920), a\r\nBoston organist and composer, whose cantata _Flight of the Eagle_ was\r\nbased on a Walt Whitman poem. Farwell was also a pupil of Humperdinck in\r\nBerlin and Guilmant in Paris. The Indian music research, in which he is\r\na pioneer, led him into the West to live among the Redskins and to make\r\nphonograph records of hundreds of tunes. He is also interested in\r\ncommunity singing and music for the people. Practically a new field is\r\nhis music for Percy MacKaye’s pageants _Caliban_ and _The Evergreen\r\nTree_.\r\n\r\nCarlos Troyer, a very old Californian who died recently, spent his life\r\ncollecting Zuni and Mojave-Apache songs, having realized their artistic\r\nvalue long before any one else. In his youth he was an intimate friend\r\nof Liszt. He travelled, later, through South American jungles, with his\r\nviolin and music paper, writing down the tunes he heard, and several\r\ntimes he would have been burned by the savages, but saved himself by\r\nplaying for them.\r\n\r\nHarvey Worthington Loomis contributed a piano version of Omaha Indian\r\nmelodies to the Wa-Wan Press (1904) called _Lyrics of the Redman_. In\r\nthe preface Loomis shows that Indian themes should be used\r\nimpressionistically, for he says: “If we would picture the music of the\r\nwigwam and the war-path we must aim by means of the imagination to\r\ncreate an art work that will project, not by _imitation_ but by\r\n_suggestion_, the impression we have ourselves received in listening to\r\nthis weird savage symphony in its pastoral _entourage_ (surroundings)\r\nwhich, above all, makes the Indian’s music sweet to him.”\r\n\r\nNatalie Curtis’ valuable service to Indian and Negro music was cut off\r\nby her tragic death in Paris (1921), from an automobile accident.\r\nFortunately she left several works in which she gave not only\r\ninformation on the music of these primitive Americans and also the\r\n_Songs and Tales of the Dark Continent of Africa_, but in them she set\r\ndown quite unconsciously the beauty of her character and the sincerity\r\nof her purpose. There are four volumes of Negro Folk Songs, and _The\r\nIndians’ Book_, besides the African book. Recently we heard two\r\nSpanish-Indian melodies, a _Crucifixion Hymn_ and _Blood of Christ_,\r\nthat Miss Curtis found in use in religious festivals near Santa Fe, New\r\nMexico. They are Spanish in character, and are almost unaltered examples\r\nof the songs of the Middle Ages brought down to us by the Indian. These\r\nwere arranged by Percy Grainger according to directions left by Miss\r\nCurtis.\r\n\r\nSeveral American operas have been written on Indian legends and it would\r\nbe difficult to find more picturesque subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         OUR LIGHT OPERA GENIUS\r\n\r\nVictor Herbert’s _Natoma_, given by the Chicago Opera Company in 1911,\r\nis an Indian story and one of his two grand operas. Born in Dublin,\r\nIreland (1854), Herbert was the grandson of the novelist Samuel Lover.\r\nHe was educated in Germany, and was a fine ’cellist. He came to the\r\nMetropolitan Opera orchestra as first ’cellist in 1886, and since then\r\nuntil his death in 1924, he delighted every one with his incomparable\r\nmelodies in light operas.\r\n\r\nAfter Patrick Gilmore’s death, Herbert in 1893, became bandmaster of the\r\n22nd Regiment band which had become famous in 1869 and 1872 for two\r\nmonster Peace Jubilees held in Boston. We think the 20th century, the\r\nage of gigantic enterprises, but——! for the first Jubilee, Gilmore had a\r\nchorus of 10,000 voices, and a band of 1,000! Not satisfied with this\r\nvolume, in the second Jubilee he doubled the number! He also had cannons\r\nfired to increase the drum battery!\r\n\r\nFrom Gilmore’s Band, Herbert became conductor of the Pittsburgh\r\nSymphony, also guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra,\r\nbut he had made such a success as composer of light operas, that he\r\nfinally devoted all his time to the theater. Among Herbert’s most\r\npopular successes are: _The Serenade_, _The Idol’s Eye_, _Babes in\r\nToyland_, _Mlle. Modiste_, _Naughty Marietta_, _The Madcap Duchess_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nJulian Edwards (1855–1910), like Victor Herbert was born a British\r\nsubject, in Manchester, England, and was a successful composer of light\r\nopera. He also wrote many sacred cantatas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SOUSA, THE MARCH KING\r\n\r\nOur most famous bandmaster is America’s “March King,” John Philip Sousa\r\n(1856), once leader of the United States Marine Band. Who has not\r\nmarched to _Stars and Stripes Forever_, _Washington Post_, or _Liberty\r\nBell_? Who does not love them, be he “high” or “low brow”? With Sousa\r\nleading, the band has played around the world, and no American composer\r\nis better known abroad. In fact, Sousa’s music was considered as\r\n“typically American” twenty years ago as is jazz today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ANOTHER INDIAN OPERA\r\n\r\nNow for the Redskins again! Charles Wakefield Cadman’s Indian opera\r\n_Shanewis_ was given at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1918. Cadman is\r\nwell known for many songs which have become popular, _At Dawning_ and\r\n_The Land of the Sky-blue Water_, a lovely Indian song. Born in\r\nJohnstown, Pennsylvania (1881), Cadman received musical training in\r\nPittsburgh. For some years he has been living in California.\r\n\r\nAnother Pennsylvanian, who spent several years among the Indians,\r\nstudying their music and using genuine themes for his opera _Poia_ is\r\nArthur Nevin (1871), younger brother of Ethelbert Nevin. For several\r\nyears he was professor of music at the University of Kansas.\r\n\r\nA professor at the same college is Charles Sanford Skilton (1868),\r\nwriter of many cantatas and orchestral Indian dances.\r\n\r\nThurlow Lieurance (1897), one of the latest recruits to Indian music\r\nlore, is so well known for _By the Waters of Minnetonka_ that we almost\r\nforget other songs and a music drama in which he has used Indian themes\r\ntellingly. One of these is a Navajo blanket song.\r\n\r\nThe blankets woven by the Navajo women are not only remarkable examples\r\nof primitive art, but tell the stories of the tribe. No two blankets are\r\nthe same, and like the music we write, are expressions of the weaver’s\r\nhopes, fears, joys and sorrows.\r\n\r\nHomer Grunn (1880) who taught piano in Phoenix, Arizona, profited by the\r\nopportunity to gather Indian tunes, which he has put into songs, a music\r\ndrama and orchestral works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ETHELBERT NEVIN—POET-COMPOSER\r\n\r\nEthelbert Nevin (1862–1901) told his father that he would not mind being\r\npoor all his life if he could just be a musician! And the father, a\r\nmusic lover himself, allowed his sensitive, dream-loving, poetic son to\r\nstudy in America and in Europe. Perhaps “Bert’s” mother had something to\r\ndo with the decision, for she, too, was sensitive and fine, and so much\r\nof a musician that her grand piano was the first to cross the Allegheny\r\nmountains into Edgeworth, the town near Pittsburgh where the Nevins were\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nEthelbert Nevin was a romanticist who found the medium of his expression\r\nin short songs and piano pieces. He had a gift of melody surpassed by\r\nfew and he reached the heart as perhaps no other American except Stephen\r\nFoster had done. _Narcissus_ for piano and _The Rosary_ have swept\r\nthrough this country selling in the millions. _Mighty Lak’ a Rose_,\r\npublished after his early death, was a close third. Several others of\r\nhis songs may be ranked among the best that America has produced. Nevin\r\nwas what Walt Whitman would have called a “Sweet Singer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRIE CREW COME TO LIFE IN THE 19TH CENTURY\r\n\r\nReginald de Koven (1859–1920) will ever be remembered for his delightful\r\nlight opera _Robin Hood_ on which we were brought up. His song, _Oh,\r\nPromise Me_, will probably be sung when he will have been forgotten. De\r\nKoven’s last two works were operas, of which _Canterbury Tales_ after\r\nChaucer was performed at the Metropolitan Opera House and _Rip Van\r\nWinkle_ from Washington Irving and Percy Mackaye, by the Chicago Opera\r\nCompany. One of his best songs is a setting of Kipling’s _Recessional_.\r\n\r\n\r\n               “PILGRIM’S PROGRESS”—AN AMERICAN ORATORIO\r\n\r\nOne of the most respected American composers is Edgar Stillman Kelley,\r\nborn in Sparta, Wisconsin, in 1857, whose American forefathers date back\r\nto 1650. After study in Stuttgart, Kelley went to California, where he\r\nwas composer, teacher, critic, lecturer, writer and light opera\r\nconductor. Later he was professor at Yale, dean of composition at the\r\nCincinnati Conservatory, and since 1910, a fellowship at the Western\r\nCollege at Oxford, Ohio, gives him the leisure and economic freedom to\r\ncompose. His orchestral works include incidental music to _Ben Hur_,\r\n_Aladdin_, Chinese suite, a comic opera, _Puritania_, _Alice in\r\nWonderland_, two symphonies, _Gulliver_ and _New England_, incidental\r\nmusic to _Prometheus Bound_, and an oratorio based on Bunyan’s\r\n_Pilgrim’s Progress_. If you do not know Kelley’s delightful song, _The\r\nLady Picking Mulberries_, allow us to introduce the little Chinawoman to\r\nyou. You will meet at the same time an old acquaintance,—Mr. Pentatonic\r\nScale.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the older school of composers in America, faithful pioneers\r\nwhose works are rarely heard now were Silas G. Pratt (1846–1916);\r\nFrederic Grant Gleason (1848–1903), who lived and worked in Chicago from\r\n1877 to the time of his death; William Wallace Gilchrist (1846–1916), a\r\nwriter of cantatas and psalms, Episcopal church music, two symphonies,\r\nchamber music and songs, who spent most of his life in Philadelphia;\r\nHomer N. Bartlett (1846–1920), composer of piano pieces; William\r\nNeidlinger (1863–1924), writer of many charming children’s songs.\r\n\r\nFrank van der Stucken (1858) who was born in Texas, but lived in Europe\r\nfrom 1866 until 1884, was the first conductor to give an entire program\r\nof American orchestral works in America and also at the Paris Exposition\r\nof 1889. For years he was conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra\r\nand he has composed many large orchestral works. He died abroad in 1929.\r\n\r\nRosseter Gleason Cole (1866), composer of songs, piano pieces, organ\r\npieces, cantatas and works for orchestra and ’cello, takes his themes\r\nfrom American and general sources. He is organist in Chicago and has\r\ncharge of the music courses of the summer session of Columbia\r\nUniversity. He has held many important posts and taken numerous prizes.\r\nHis cantata _The Rock of Liberty_ was sung at the Tercentenary\r\nCelebration, 1920, of the settlement of Plymouth.\r\n\r\nArne Oldberg, born in Youngstown, Ohio (1874) is director of the piano\r\ndepartment of Northwestern University (Michigan) and has many orchestral\r\nworks, written symphonies, concertos and overtures, which have had\r\nfrequent hearings. He has also composed much chamber music.\r\n\r\nThere are also Harry Rowe Shelley (1858), writer of much important\r\nchurch music; James H. Rogers, composer of teaching pieces for the piano\r\nand many fine songs, including a cycle _In Memoriam_, which is a\r\nheartfelt expression of sorrow in beautiful music; Wilson G. Smith,\r\ncomposer of many piano teaching pieces and musical writer; Louis Coerne,\r\nwriter of opera and of works for orchestra; Ernest Kroeger of St. Louis\r\nwho also used Indian and Negro themes in works for orchestra and piano;\r\nCarl Busch of Kansas City, composer of orchestral works, cantatas, music\r\nfor violin and many songs, in some of which we see the Indian. In\r\nCalifornia we meet Wm. J. McCoy and Humphrey J. Stewart who have\r\ncomposed church music and have written often for the yearly out-door\r\n“High Jinks” of the San Francisco Bohemian Club, in which many important\r\ncomposers have been invited to assist; Domenico Brescia, a South\r\nAmerican composer living in San Francisco, who wrote interesting chamber\r\nmusic played at the Berkshire Chamber Music Festivals; and Albert Elkus,\r\na composer of serious works for orchestra and piano. Smith died in 1929;\r\nCoerne in 1922.\r\n\r\nBut this is growing into a musical directory! And even neglecting many\r\nwho have done much to make music grow in America, we must proceed for we\r\nhave important milestones ahead.\r\n\r\nFor many years New York has been the American center of music. Few of\r\nthe people in musical life are native New Yorkers, but have come from\r\nall parts of the States and Europe to this musical Mecca.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MACDOWELL GREATEST AMERICAN POET-COMPOSER\r\n\r\nThe greatest romanticist and poet-composer of America up to the present\r\nis Edward MacDowell (1861–1908). Some of the romanticism of the early\r\n19th century has become mere imitation of the style which arose as a\r\nprotest against the insincere forms of the 18th century. But the true\r\nspirit of romance never dies and never becomes artificial,—such romance\r\nhad MacDowell. He was sincere, always a poet, always himself, and in\r\nspite of his Irish-Scotch inheritance, German training and love of Norse\r\nlegends, he expressed MacDowell in every note. He lived before the time\r\nwhen we question “How shall we express America in Music”? In fact he was\r\nmuch against tagging composers as American, German, French, and so on.\r\n\r\nEdward MacDowell, born in New York City, began piano lessons when he was\r\neight. One of his teachers was the brilliant South American Teresa\r\nCarreño, who later played her pupil’s concerto with many world\r\norchestras. At 15, he entered the Paris Conservatory where he was fellow\r\nstudent with Debussy.\r\n\r\nWhile there, MacDowell studied French, and during a lesson amused\r\nhimself by drawing a picture of his teacher. When caught, the teacher,\r\ninstead of rebuking him, took the sketch to a friend, a master at the\r\n_École des Beaux Arts_, the famous old art school of Paris. The artist\r\nfound the sketch so good that he offered to train him without charge but\r\nEdward had made up his mind to be a musician and did not accept the\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, MacDowell studied composition at Frankfort with Joachim Raff,\r\none of the composers of the Romantic period. Raff introduced him to\r\nLiszt, who invited MacDowell to play his first piano suite at Zürich\r\n(1882). The composer’s modesty is reflected in these words which\r\nLawrence Gilman quotes: “I would not have changed a note in one of them\r\nfor untold gold, and _inside_ I had the greatest love for them; but the\r\nidea that any one else might take them seriously had never occurred to\r\nme.” This suite was his first published composition.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, he married Miss Marian Nevins of New York, and theirs was one\r\nof the most beautiful marriages in musical history, although their\r\nmeeting was amusing! The young girl had crossed the ocean to continue\r\nher music studies at a time when it was not a common occurrence, and\r\nwhen she went to Raff for lessons, he sent her to a young countryman of\r\nhers, “an extraordinary piano teacher.” She was indignant to be sent to\r\na young inexperienced American in that fashion, but she went! The young\r\ninexperienced American did not want to teach an American girl, because\r\nhe felt she would not be serious enough to do the kind of work he\r\ndemanded, but he accepted her! Later she accepted him!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Edward MacDowell._\r\n\r\n  _America’s Greatest Poet-Composer._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Charles Griffes._\r\n\r\n  _American Impressionist._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1888, he established himself in Boston as pianist and teacher. His\r\nfirst concert was with the Kneisel Quartet, and in 1889 he successfully\r\nplayed his concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He made tours\r\nthrough the States giving recitals and appearing with the orchestras.\r\nWinning immediate recognition, his position as an exceptional composer\r\ngrew. In 1896 the Boston Symphony Orchestra presented his first piano\r\nconcerto and his orchestral _Indian Suite_ on the same program in New\r\nYork. Such an honor had never before been shown an American!\r\n\r\nIn 1896, he became professor of the new Chair of Music at Columbia\r\nUniversity in New York City. After resigning his post in 1904, his\r\nhealth broke as the result of an accident, and for several years he was\r\nan invalid. All the care of physicians, devoted friends, his parents,\r\nand his courageous wife, could not restore his memory, and in 1908, he\r\ndied in New York and was buried in Peterboro, N. H. A natural boulder\r\nfrom where he often watched the sunset, marks the spot—fitting for one\r\nwho loved Nature as he did.\r\n\r\nShortly before his passing, a group of friends formed a society, the\r\nMacDowell Club of New York, which has for its object the promoting of “a\r\nsympathetic understanding of the correlation of all the arts, and of\r\ncontributing to the broadening of their influence, thus carrying forward\r\nthe life-purpose of Edward MacDowell.” He wished musicians to know the\r\nvalue of associating with artists outside of the field of music. Eugene\r\nHeffley, (1862–1925) an intimate friend of MacDowell and first president\r\nof the MacDowell Club did much to make the MacDowell music known and\r\nloved, just as he did for Charles Griffes, Debussy, Ravel, Scriabin and\r\nothers who have come with new messages.\r\n\r\nSome people have statues erected, others have towns and streets named\r\nfor them, but besides the numerous MacDowell Clubs throughout the\r\nStates, the most beautiful memorial is the MacDowell Association at\r\nPeterboro. Early in his career, MacDowell found it impossible to work\r\nwell in the city, and by happy chance he and his wife discovered a\r\ndeserted farm which they bought for the proverbial “song.” Here the\r\ncomposer spent his summers in the beautiful New Hampshire woods, in the\r\nheart of which he built the little log cabin, which in his words, is\r\n\r\n               A house of dreams untold\r\n               It looks out over the whispering tree-tops\r\n               And faces the setting sun.\r\n\r\nAnd in this “house” he told many of his dreams in lovely melody! While\r\nill, he often expressed the desire to share the inspiration-giving peace\r\nand beauty of his woods with friends, workers in music and the sister\r\narts. Out of this wish has grown the colony for creative workers, which\r\nhas been a haven to hundreds of composers, poets, painters, sculptors,\r\ndramatists, and novelists. The “Log Cabin” is the seed out of which\r\ntwenty studios have sprung. The small deserted farm has spread over 500\r\nacres, and Mrs. MacDowell with the aid of faithful friends has made a\r\ndream come true!\r\n\r\nMacDowell was a composer for the pianoforte, although he wrote some\r\nlovely songs; a few orchestral works, best known of which is _The Indian\r\nSuite_, in which he employs Indian themes; and several male choruses\r\nwritten when he conducted the New York Mendelssohn Glee Club. We love\r\nand remember him for his _Woodland Sketches_, _Sea Pieces_, _Fireside\r\nTales_, _New England Idyls_ (opus 62 and his last work),\r\nvirtuoso-studies, and the four sonatas—the _Tragica_, _Eroica_, _Norse_\r\nand _Keltic_.\r\n\r\nW. H. Humiston (1869–1924), composer, lecturer, musical critic,\r\norganist, assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and\r\na pupil of MacDowell, had the most complete collection of Bach and\r\nWagner in this country and was a great authority on their writings. This\r\ncollection now belongs to the MacDowell Association, and is in the\r\ncolony library at Peterboro.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HENRY HOLDEN HUSS\r\n\r\nHenry Holden Huss (1862), born in Newark, New Jersey, has lived in New\r\nYork since his early twenties when he returned from studying with\r\nRheinberger in Munich. Before his European days he was a pupil of his\r\nfather, George J. Huss, a Bavarian who came to America during the 1848\r\nrevolution, and was one of the best musical educators in this country.\r\nHuss also studied with O. B. Boise (1845–1912), an American theorist and\r\nteacher. As concert pianist, Huss has played his piano concerto, one of\r\nthe best American works, with all the important orchestras. Raoul Pugno,\r\nthe much-loved French pianist, and Adele aus der Ohe also played it\r\nabroad and in America.\r\n\r\nHuss has always aimed for the highest ideals as teacher, composer and\r\npianist. A classicist at heart, his works are written on classic\r\nmodels,—a beautiful violin sonata with poetic slow movement, many\r\nchamber music works, a concerto for violin and orchestra, besides _The\r\nSeven Ages of Man_ for baritone and orchestra, often sung by the late\r\nDavid Bispham, _Cleopatra’s Death_, for soprano and orchestra, a female\r\nchorus _Ave Maria_, and many fine art songs and piano pieces, the most\r\nbeautiful of which is a tone poem _To the Night_, a lovely\r\nimpressionistic composition that ranks with the best that America has\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nTwo other pupils of O. B. Boise, Ernest Hutcheson (1871) an Australian,\r\nand Howard Brockway (1870), a Brooklynite, have done much to make music\r\ngrow in America. Hutcheson, who studied also with Max Vogrich in\r\nAustralia and Reinecke in Leipsic, has made so enviable a career as\r\npianist and teacher, that one forgets he has a symphony, a double piano\r\nconcerto and several other large works in manuscript. Brockway, who\r\nharmonized _Lonesome Tunes_, folk songs from the Kentucky Mountains\r\ncollected by Miss Loraine Wyman, is also the composer of a symphony\r\nplayed in Boston (1907) by the Symphony Orchestra, a suite,\r\nballad-scherzo for orchestra, many piano works and songs. Hutcheson,\r\nBrockway and Boise were teachers in the Baltimore Peabody Institute, one\r\nof the important music schools, under direction of Harold Randolph, a\r\nfine musician and pianist.\r\n\r\nGeorge F. Boyle (1886) of New South Wales has, since 1910, been\r\nprofessor at the Peabody Institute. He has composed many piano pieces,\r\nsongs and orchestral works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             RUBIN GOLDMARK\r\n\r\nRubin Goldmark (1872), is known as the best toastmaster in the music\r\nworld! Born in New York, he was one of Dvorak’s most talented pupils and\r\ninherits his gifts from his noted uncle Carl Goldmark (1830–1915), a\r\nHungarian composer of the overture _Sakuntala_ and the opera _The Queen\r\nof Sheba_, the symphony _The Rustic Wedding_ and much else. Rubin\r\nGoldmark has written several important tone poems,—_Samson_, _Gettysburg\r\nRequiem_, _Negro Rhapsody_, based on negro themes, and other fine things\r\nfor orchestra, chamber music, piano and violin numbers and as a teacher\r\nhe has laid the foundations for several American composers among whom\r\nare:—Frederick Jacobi, Aaron Copland and George Gershwin. Each score\r\nfrom Goldmark’s pen is an addition to American music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HENRY HADLEY\r\n\r\nHenry K. Hadley (1871) by right of birth and training belongs to the New\r\nEngland group of composers, but most of his life was spent in Germany\r\nwhere he got his orchestral experience, and in different parts of\r\nAmerica where he has conducted orchestras—Seattle, Washington, San\r\nFrancisco and New York. Hadley is one of the few Americans who has\r\nconducted the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\r\n\r\nHadley has taken many prizes for opera, symphony, cantata and an\r\norchestral rhapsody. To this he has added numerous other orchestral and\r\nchamber music works and over 100 songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ALBERT MILDENBERG’S “MICHAEL ANGELO”\r\n\r\nIn these days when the cry is for American opera, it seems regrettable\r\nthat an opera ready for production should lie idle because of the death\r\nof its composer. Perhaps no work in history has had a more tragic story\r\nthan _Michael Angelo_ by Albert Mildenberg (1878–1918). In 1908,\r\nMildenberg signed a contract in Vienna for the production of the opera.\r\nThe following year on the way to Europe, the ship, _Slavonia_, was\r\nwrecked, and although the composer escaped, his entire orchestral score\r\nand parts went to the bottom of the sea. Courageously he rewrote the\r\nwork, and sent it to the Metropolitan Opera House in competition for the\r\n$10,000 prize, won by Horatio Parker. Before it had reached the judges,\r\nin some way, still unexplained, the major part of the score disappeared!\r\nAgain, Mildenberg set to work with the sketches he had, and made a third\r\nscore, but it cost him his life, for though the opera was completed\r\nbefore his death, he was too ill to carry it further.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this grand opera, Mildenberg, a pupil of Rafael Joseffy,\r\nwrote many piano pieces. He also composed _The Violet_, _I Love Thee_,\r\nand _Astarte_, songs that had a popular vogue and are still found on\r\nmany programs, and romantic comic operas, _The Wood Witch_ and _Love’s\r\nLocksmith_, besides a cantata and many choruses.\r\n\r\nTwo other operas which had Metropolitan Opera House productions were\r\n_The Temple Dancer_ by John Adam Hugo (1873) and _The Legend_ by Joseph\r\nCarl Breil (1870).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     JOHN ALDEN CARPENTER—MODERNIST\r\n\r\nJohn Alden Carpenter (1876), one of America’s foremost composers, was\r\nborn in Park Ridge, Illinois, and educated at Harvard where he took the\r\nmusic course, studying afterwards in England with Edward Elgar, the\r\nEnglish composer. A business man, Carpenter still devotes his time to\r\ncomposing music that has put him among America’s leading musical lights.\r\nWhile he might be called a romanticist, his tendencies are\r\nimpressionistic, and none understands better than he the charms of rich\r\nand unusual harmonies, the use of modern melodic and orchestral effects,\r\nand the value of humor in music. All these we find in his _Adventures in\r\na Perambulator_ for orchestra, and his ballet _Krazy Kat_, where jazz\r\nrhythms are used to great advantage. One of the most beautiful works of\r\nits kind, is the ballet after Oscar Wilde’s _The Birthday of the\r\nInfanta_, performed by the Chicago Opera Company, and his first ballet\r\nwritten for the Metropolitan Opera Company is called _Skyscraper_,\r\ncertainly American! Carpenter’s settings of Tagore’s _Gitanjali_ are\r\namong America’s finest songs; he has many others, a concertino for piano\r\nand orchestra and a violin sonata.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AN ALL-AMERICAN SYMPHONY\r\n\r\nEric Delamarter (1880), born in Lansing, Michigan, has written a\r\n_Symphony After Walt Whitman_ in which he has used twenty-year old\r\nstreet songs from the “Barbary Coast” (San Francisco Bowery), _Lonesome\r\nTunes_ of Kentucky, and a fox-trot rhythm with newer street songs.\r\nThese, Delamarter has woven into a symphony with skill and sincerity.\r\nThe material is All-American although neither Negro nor Indian.\r\n\r\nDelamarter is a well-known musical critic in Chicago, an organist,\r\ncomposer of many other works for orchestra, organ, and oratorios,\r\nincidental music for drama, cantatas and songs and since 1917 assistant\r\nconductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nNoble Kreider and Edward Royce, son of Professor Josiah Royce of Harvard\r\nUniversity, have both written well for the piano. Harold Bauer has\r\nplayed variations and short pieces by Edward Royce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ERNEST SCHELLING—PIANIST-COMPOSER\r\n\r\nErnest Schelling (1876), born in Delaware, New Jersey, appeared as\r\npianist at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, at the age of four! His\r\nmusical training abroad included several years with Paderewski. He has\r\nmade many concert tours in Europe and America, and for two seasons has\r\nconducted the children’s concerts of the New York Philharmonic Society.\r\nHis important orchestral works include a symphonic legend, a suite, two\r\nnumbers, _Suite Phantastique_ and _Impressions From An Artist’s Life_,\r\nfor piano and orchestra, and his latest work to enjoy wide popularity,\r\n_The Victory Ball_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JOHN POWELL—VIRGINIAN\r\n\r\nAll the charm and refinement of the Southern gentleman are reflected in\r\nJohn Powell’s personality, along with an earnest sincerity and\r\nconviction. He was born in Richmond, Virginia, (1882), is a graduate of\r\nthe University of Virginia, and a pupil of Theodor Leschetizky and\r\nNavratil in Vienna. He has made an international reputation as brilliant\r\npianist and is also one of our most gifted composers. Powell’s works\r\nshow classical training in form, with which he combines a rich romantic\r\nfeeling and a love for folk music.\r\n\r\nHe believes that music should draw on the folk element for its strength,\r\nand has proved his theory by using freely the folk music he knows best,\r\nthat of the negro. _In the South_, _At the Fair_, piano pieces, show\r\nthis early influence and his fund of humor, and in his _Negro Rhapsody_\r\nfor piano and orchestra, Powell has painted a picture of the negro in\r\nmany moods—sinister and menacing, primitive bordering on barbaric, as\r\nwell as humorous, care-free and childlike.\r\n\r\nHis _Sonata Teutonica_ which first brought him before the public is of\r\nextraordinary strength, length and talent. He has written other sonatas\r\nfor piano and for violin, songs, chamber music and orchestral works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      NEGRO SPIRITUALS VERSUS JAZZ\r\n\r\nThis brings us face to face with one of the most discussed questions of\r\nthe day: the influence of Negro music and jazz on serious composition.\r\nThe pure Negro music is the Spiritual and _not_ jazz, which may be the\r\ntypically American idiom we have been waiting for.\r\n\r\nIt is not Negro but is developed from the Negro dance rhythm, from a\r\nreal folk music; it is the result of Negro music played upon by American\r\nlife and influences; through it we may learn to free ourselves\r\nmusically, and show the true American spirit of adventure and daring\r\nwhich until now has been absent in our native compositions. The path has\r\nbeen travelled from the songs of Stephen Foster, Negro Minstrels, “coon\r\nsongs” and “cake walks,” to jazz with its elaborate orchestration unlike\r\nany other existing music, and its complicated rhythms. Jazz rhythm is\r\ncontrapuntal rhythm. Europe says that it is our one original and\r\nimportant contribution to music! This is a strong statement, but as\r\n“imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” their serious 20th\r\ncentury composers have flattered us by writing jazz, and we have _Piano\r\nRag_ by Stravinsky, a _Syncopated Sonata_ by Jean Wiener, jazz by Darius\r\nMilhaud, Casella, Honegger, and even Debussy was tempted into writing\r\n_Golliwogg’s Cake Walk_.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles (April, 1925), Walter Henry Rothwell with his\r\nPhilharmonic Orchestra played an _American Caprice_ by Henry Schoenefeld\r\n(1857) one of many works in which the composer has used Indian and Negro\r\nthemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n          HENRY THACKER BURLEIGH, MOST NOTED COLORED COMPOSER\r\n\r\nHis arrangement of the Spiritual, _Deep River_, has made Harry\r\nBurleigh’s name known on two continents, and its success has led many\r\ninto that field. Burleigh (1866) was one of the foremost among the\r\nDvorak pupils, and has held the position of leading baritone in St.\r\nGeorge’s Church for many years, as also at the Temple Emanuel on Fifth\r\nAvenue. His name is found on practically every program where Spirituals\r\nare sung.\r\n\r\nOf Burleigh’s race is R. Nathaniel Dett (1882), conductor of the Hampton\r\nSingers, also director of the music department of Hampton College. His\r\nname was introduced by Percy Grainger, who played his characteristic\r\nNegro dance called _Juba Dance_ in Europe and America. Dett’s greatest\r\nworks are his arrangements of the Spirituals for chorus. Grainger wrote\r\nof him: “There is in his treatment of blended human voices that innate\r\nsonority and vocal naturalness that seem to result only from accumulated\r\nlong experience of untrained improvised polyphonic singing, such as that\r\nof Southern Negroes, South Sea Polynesians and Russian peasants. These\r\nthings are branches of the very tree of natural communal song.”\r\n\r\nDavid Guion, a young Texan, is well known in this field and also for his\r\npiano setting of _Turkey in the Straw_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LOUIS GRUENBERG FINDS NEW PATHS\r\n\r\nLouis Gruenberg (1884) was born in Russia but came to America at the age\r\nof two. At nineteen he went to Europe and became the pupil of Ferruccio\r\nBusoni, the Italian pianist-composer who spent most of his life in\r\nBerlin and Vienna and also taught for two years at the New England\r\nConservatory of Music.\r\n\r\nGruenberg had followed conventional lines of composition for some years,\r\nreceiving prizes in Berlin and New York (in 1922 he was awarded the\r\nFlagler prize for a symphonic poem _Hill of Dreams_). His works of this\r\nperiod comprise symphonic poems, a string quartet, a piano concerto, a\r\nsymphony, a suite for violin, also a sonata, two operas, songs and piano\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nHe began to study America, to ask himself what was the spirit of\r\nAmericanism that had not yet found its way into music, and his answer\r\nwas not the Negro jazz, but the white man’s jazz expressing the “spirit\r\nof the times.” As a result he changed his way of writing. The\r\ncompositions of this period are a violin sonata, a set of piano pieces\r\ncalled _Polychromatics_, a _Poem_ in sonatina form for ’cello, four\r\npieces for string quartet, a viola sonata, an orchestral tone-poem, a\r\ngroup of short piano pieces in jazz rhythms with the amusing name of\r\n_Jazzberries_, three violin pieces in the same style, a group of songs\r\n_Animals and Insects_, texts by Vachel Lindsay, and that same poet’s\r\n_Daniel_ which Gruenberg has set as _Daniel Jazz_ for tenor and chamber\r\nmusic orchestra, and _Creation_, a Negro sermon by James Weldon Johnson,\r\na poet, who has just won the Spingarn Prize for the most distinctive\r\nwork (1924–1925) of an American of African descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TWO JAZZ GENIUSES\r\n\r\nIrving Berlin, the genius of the age in writing typical American jazz,\r\nwas born in Russia and has had no musical training. He picks out his\r\nirresistible melodies by ear and his aide writes them down to the\r\ndelight of the millions in all corners of the earth, from New York to\r\nthe Sahara desert, where the phonograph has carried them. The sheiks no\r\nlonger sing in ancient pentatonic melody to their lady loves, but turn\r\non the phonograph which ably plays some of his hundred American songs:\r\n_My Wife Goes to the Country_, _Snooky Ookums_, _Along Came Ruth_, _If\r\nYou Don’t Want Me Why Do You Hang Around?_ _Mandy_, _Say it with Music_,\r\n_What’ll I Do_, _All Alone_, and many from the musical revues (Music Box\r\nRevue, especially). His earlier _Alexander’s Rag Time Band_ goes back to\r\ncake walk days and has become a classic of its kind and the model for\r\npopular music following it. He rose from poverty to riches through\r\ngiving great delight to the public.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gershwin (1898) flashed into the lime-light through his jazz\r\npiano concerto _Rhapsody in Blue_ and his extraordinary playing of it\r\nwith Paul Whiteman’s Orchestra. In this piece we find a merging of\r\nclassic form with the “voice of the people”! It will be interesting to\r\nwatch this young man, not yet thirty, to see the outcome of grafting a\r\nmusical education on to his unusual natural gifts. As a result of the\r\nsuccess of his experiment he has been commissioned to write a _New York\r\nConcerto_ for the New York Symphony. He is a Brooklyn boy brought up as\r\na “song plugger” for a publisher of popular music, playing their songs\r\nin vaudeville acts and in cafés.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHARLES TOMLINSON GRIFFES\r\n\r\nCharles Tomlinson Griffes (1884–1920) was a poet-composer whose early\r\ndeath was a serious loss to America, for every thing he wrote was an\r\naddition to our music. He was impressionistic in style, and we are\r\ngrateful for the lovely art songs, _Five Poems of Ancient China and\r\nJapan_, three songs with orchestral accompaniment to poems of Fiona\r\nMacLeod, ten piano pieces and the Sonata which have never been surpassed\r\nin beauty and workmanship by any American, the _Poem_ for flute and\r\norchestra, the string quartet on Indian themes, and his orchestral\r\ntone-poem, _The Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan_. For the stage, Griffes\r\ncomposed a Japanese mime-play, _Schojo_, a dance drama, _The Kairn of\r\nKorwidwen_ and Walt Whitman’s _Salut au Monde_, a dramatic ballet. The\r\nlast two were presented at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where interesting\r\nexperiments in music and the drama have been made by the Misses\r\nLewisohn.\r\n\r\nGriffes was a native of Elmira, New York, and his first studies were\r\nmade with Miss Mary S. Broughton, who recognized her young pupil’s\r\nunusual talent and took him to Germany for study. His composition work\r\nwas done with Humperdinck, and Rüfer, and from 1907 until his death he\r\ntaught music at Hackley, a boys’ school in Tarrytown, New York.\r\n\r\nLawrence Gilman, American critic, says of him: “He was a poet with a\r\nsense of comedy.... Griffes had never learned how to pose—he would never\r\nhave learned how if he had lived to be as triumphantly old and famous as\r\nMonsieur Saint-Saëns or Herr Bruch or Signor Verdi.... It was only a\r\nshort while before his death that the Boston Symphony Orchestra played\r\nfor the first time (in Boston) his _Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan_ ... and\r\nthe general concert-going public turned aside ... to bestow an approving\r\nhand upon this producer of a sensitive and imaginative tone-poetry who\r\nwas by some mysterious accident, an American!... He was a fastidious\r\ncraftsman, a scrupulous artist. He was neither smug nor pretentious nor\r\naccommodating. He went his own way,—modestly, quietly, unswervingly ...\r\nhaving the vision of the few....”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    WHITHORNE’S AMERICAN IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\nEmerson Whithorne (1884) was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and studied there\r\nand in Europe. After writing some forty songs and compositions in\r\nOriental and European fashion, he has given us in his _New York Days and\r\nNights_, a group of piano pieces in which are cleverly pictured Times\r\nSquare, Hudson River ferry boats, Trinity Church chimes, etc. His latest\r\nwork is a ballet, _Sooner and Later_, written with Miss Irene Lewisohn\r\nfor the Neighborhood Playhouse, in which they have combined the\r\nprimitive and the very modern in an original and pictureful manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ALBERT SPALDING—AMERICA’S VIOLINIST-COMPOSER\r\n\r\nWhen Walter Damrosch took the New York Symphony Orchestra on tour in\r\nEurope, Albert Spalding (1888, Chicago) went along as joint soloist with\r\nJohn Powell, playing his violin concerto. Besides this, Spalding has\r\nwritten many small pieces for violin, other orchestral and piano works,\r\nand a string quartet played (1924) by the Flonzaley Quartet. Spalding\r\nranks with the great violinists of the world.\r\n\r\nThree other violinists showing talent as composers are Edwin Grasse\r\n(1884), who in spite of the handicap of blindness, has composed some\r\ncharming violin pieces, violin sonatas and string quartets; Samuel\r\nGardner, who has written orchestral works, chamber music and short\r\nviolin pieces; and Cecil Burleigh, short poetic pieces for violin and\r\nfor piano and a violin concerto.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AMERICAN MUSIC GUILD\r\n\r\nTo encourage the composing and appreciation of high class American\r\ncomposition, ten American composers formed an association, the _American\r\nMusic Guild_. The members are Marion Bauer, Chalmers Clifton, Louis\r\nGruenberg, Sandor Harmati, Charles Haubiel, Frederick Jacobi, A. Walter\r\nKramer, Harold Morris, Albert Stoessel and Deems Taylor.\r\n\r\nAlbert Stoessel (1894, St. Louis) is professor of music at New York\r\nUniversity, conductor of the New York Oratorio Society, of the New York\r\nSymphony concerts at Chautauqua, N. Y., of the Worcester Festival and\r\ncomposer of chamber music and orchestral works.\r\n\r\nDeems Taylor (1885, New York) is musical critic of the New York _World_,\r\nand the composer of songs and orchestral works (_Through the Looking\r\nGlass_ Suite) and he has written much choral and incidental music for\r\nplays and motion pictures. One of his most graceful works is the ballet\r\nin _The Beggar on Horseback_. His opera _The King’s Henchman_ was given\r\nat the Metropolitan Opera House in 1927. The book is by Edna St. Vincent\r\nMillay.\r\n\r\nA. Walter Kramer (1890, New York) is a critic and writer on musical\r\nsubjects, composer of many songs that have made his name familiar,\r\norchestral works, a _Rhapsody_ for violin and orchestra, pieces for\r\nviolin, organ and piano, and a symphonic tone poem on Masefield’s\r\n_Tragedy of Nan_.\r\n\r\nHarold Morris (1889, Texas) has never written little pieces, but has\r\njumped into classical forms which he treats in a most modern way, in\r\npiano sonatas, a violin sonata, a trio, quartet, a concerto for piano\r\nand orchestra, and a tone poem on a Tagore text. He has studied only in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nFrederick Jacobi (1891, San Francisco), had his latest work, a symphony,\r\nperformed in 1924; he has also written a string quartet on Indian\r\nthemes, songs with orchestra, short pieces and orchestral tone poems in\r\nall of which his gift of poetic expression is uppermost.\r\n\r\nChalmers Clifton (1889, Jackson, Miss.), is conductor of an orchestra\r\nwhich has as object the training of young orchestra players, a much\r\nneeded addition to American musical education. He has written some\r\nchamber music and music for a pageant.\r\n\r\nSandor Harmati (1894), Hungarian by birth, founded the Lenox String\r\nQuartet and has composed several string quartets and orchestral works.\r\nHe has taken numerous prizes for his compositions and is now conductor\r\nof the Omaha Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nCharles Haubiel (1894, Delta, Ohio), has composed works in the classical\r\nform and is teacher of piano and theory.\r\n\r\nMarion Bauer (1887) was born in Walla Walla, Washington. She has written\r\n30 songs, 20 piano pieces, two violin sonatas, a string quartet, and a\r\nwork for chamber music orchestra, and choruses. She writes and lectures\r\non music, and is Asst. Professor at New York University.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AMERICAN ACADEMY IN ROME\r\n\r\nA few years ago Edward MacDowell was one of the founders of an Academy\r\nin Rome for American students on the principle of the Roman prize of the\r\nParis Conservatory. Several of the young prize-winners have profited by\r\ntheir visit to the ancient city of culture where they are living and\r\nworking with funds provided by the Academy. Unfortunately the music\r\nfellowship does not admit women! Among those to enjoy this advantage are\r\nLeo Sowerby (1895, Grand Rapids, Michigan) who has written a piano\r\nconcerto and a double piano concerto, also a work called _Synconata_ in\r\nsyncopated rhythms which has been played by Paul Whiteman and many other\r\ncompositions in large and small forms; Howard Hanson (1896, Wahoo,\r\nNebraska) who is now director of the Eastman School of Music at\r\nRochester, New York, and has written a number of orchestral and chamber\r\nmusic works; and Wintter Watts, the composer of many beautiful art songs\r\nand an orchestral tone poem, _Young Blood_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LEO ORNSTEIN—THE INDEPENDENT\r\n\r\n“What are discords?” was asked of Leo Ornstein (1895, Russia). “I can\r\nnot tell,” he answered. “Somewhere there is a law of harmony.... What it\r\nis I can not tell. Only I know that under certain conditions ... I hear\r\nit, I get color impressions.... If some of the tones are gray, somber,\r\nviolent is that my fault?... In a word, I am not concerned with form or\r\nwith standards of any nature.” This is the young composer’s declaration\r\nof independence, and in his early compositions he has lived up to it!\r\nOne of his piano works, _Wildmen’s Dance_, goes back to primitive man\r\nfor his inspiration and wild rhythms. He is original and daring as few\r\nAmericans have ever been. His last work was a piano concerto played by\r\nhim with the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. He has written sonatas for\r\npiano, for ’cello and violin, besides many piano pieces, which he plays\r\nwell, as he is an exceptional pianist.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has been in America since childhood, his early life in\r\nRussia, in which he suffered the terrors of the pogroms (the massacres\r\nof the Jews), is reflected in his work. His training was under the\r\ndirection of Bertha Tapper and Percy Goetschius.\r\n\r\nA gifted young modernist whose orchestral and chamber works are often\r\nplayed by important organizations, is Aaron Copland (1898), pupil of\r\nRubin Goldmark and Nadia Boulanger, of Paris. He received (1925) the\r\nfirst Guggenheim Fellowship in Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENTALISTS\r\n\r\nHenry Eichheim, of Boston, has had many performances of his colorful\r\nChinese and Japanese impressions. Carl Ruggles is an independent thinker\r\nand composer, experimenting in many combinations of harmonies and\r\ninstruments. Two extremists, who have not yet proven the value of their\r\nideas and whose works must be regarded as experiments are Henry Cowell\r\nof California and George Antheil who lives in Paris. Sometimes, however,\r\nout of the wildest experiment comes something that may make music grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SONG WRITERS\r\n\r\nThere are many composers who are well known not for symphonies and\r\nchamber music but for songs. There are so many that we can list but a\r\nfew: Alexander Russell, R. Huntington Woodman, Carl Deis, William Arms\r\nFischer, Charles Fonteyn Manney, Clayton Johns, Sidney Homer, Charles\r\nGilbert Spross, Oley Speaks, Louis Campbell-Tipton, Philip James,\r\nWilliam C. Hammond, G. Bainbridge Crist, Marshall Kernochan, Eastwood\r\nLane, Richard Hammond, Harry Osgood, Charles B. Hawley, Adolph Martin\r\nFoerster, Richard Hageman, Edward Ballantine, Clough Leighter, Victor\r\nHarris, Isidore Luckstone, Percy Lee Atherton, John Beach, Paolo\r\nGallico, Arthur Bergh, Morris Class, Walter Morse Rummel, Blair\r\nFairchild, Rudolph Ganz (Swiss-American), Eugen Haile (German-American),\r\nFrank La Forge, Harold Vincent Milligan, Timothy Spelman, Edward\r\nHorsman, Tom Dobson, Oscar G. Sonneck. Mr. Sonneck (1873–1928) was less\r\nknown as a musicianly composer, than as a musicologist whose vast\r\nknowledge made him invaluable as the first librarian of the music\r\ndivision of the Library of Congress in Washington (1902–1915). His books\r\nform an important addition to musical _Americana_. He was editor of the\r\n_Musical Quarterly_, and secretary of the Beethoven Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FOREIGNERS WRITING IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nMany who are making music grow in America were born in Europe and while\r\nthey may not be _American_ composers, they are composers in America, and\r\nmost of them have become American citizens.\r\n\r\nErnest Bloch, born in Geneva, Switzerland (1880), has been here since\r\n1916, when the Flonzaley Quartet played his _String Quartet_. Owing to\r\nhis Jewish descent his work shows an Oriental strain rather than Swiss\r\nnational feeling. Among his important orchestral works are _Jewish\r\nPoems_, _Psalms_, a symphony, _Israel_, _Schelomo_, for ’cello and\r\norchestra, a prize symphonic rhapsody, _America_, and a _Concerto\r\nGrosso_ for strings. He took the Coolidge prize with his _Viola Suite_,\r\nand has also a violin sonata and a piano quintet. He has taught in New\r\nYork, Cleveland and San Francisco. A pupil, Ethel Leginska, the English\r\npianist and orchestral conductor, has composed an interesting string\r\nquartet, piano pieces and works for orchestra.\r\n\r\nPercy Aldridge Grainger, born in Melbourne, Australia (1882), appeared\r\nas a pianist at the age of ten and has never stopped since! His mother\r\nwas his first teacher and later he was a pupil of Busoni and intimate\r\nfriend of Grieg, whose concerto he played upon his first American\r\nappearance (1915). During the World War he became naturalized and served\r\nin the American army. As composer he is unique, being self-taught, and\r\nalthough knowing the compositions of all the great masters, he goes to\r\nfolk music for his themes and ideas, and has become an authority on\r\nBritish and Scandinavian folk music, and is collecting music of the\r\nAmerican Indian and the Negro.\r\n\r\nAmong Grainger’s best known pieces are: _Molly on the Shore_, _Colonial\r\nSong_, _Shepherd’s Hey_, _Irish Tune from County Derry_, _Country\r\nGardens_ and _Turkey in the Straw_, all folk-melodies around which he\r\nhas woven most fascinating harmonies, and has brought back the old songs\r\nin modern dress. In the spring of 1925 he gave two concerts which he\r\ncalled, with true Grainger originality, “Room Music” instead of chamber\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nCarl Engel, although born in Paris (1883), and educated in France is an\r\nAmerican citizen and the director of the Music Division of the Library\r\nof Congress in Washington, D. C. Engel has written in addition to essays\r\nin delightful style, a _Tryptich_ (a violin sonata in three movements),\r\nand enchanting songs, marking him a lover of modern harmony.\r\n\r\nTwo Frenchmen in New York, Carlos Salzedo, one of the world’s leading\r\nharpists, and Edgar Varese are foremost among the innovators, bringing\r\nto the public through their own compositions and the work of the\r\n_International Composers’ Guild_, the latest styles in music. They hand\r\nthe public the new works of the most extreme composers before the ink is\r\ndry on the manuscript. Most of these are composed in dissonance or\r\nso-called cacophony (from two Greek words kakos,—bad; phono,—sounds).\r\nThrough the efforts of these men, the _League of Composers_, and the\r\n_Pro Musica_ Society (E. Robert Schmitz, founder and president), many\r\npresent day compositions are heard in America.\r\n\r\nLazare Saminsky, a Russian, choirmaster at Temple Emanu-El, New York,\r\nhas written several symphonies and a chamber opera, _Gagliarda of a\r\nMerry Plague_. He has made a deep study of Hebrew music.\r\n\r\nKurt Schindler, (Berlin, 1882), first conductor of the New York Schola\r\nCantorum, a chorus, is an authority on Russian, Spanish and Finnish folk\r\nmusic, of which he has made many collections. He has also written art\r\nsongs and choruses.\r\n\r\nLeopold Godowsky, born in Russia (1870), one of the greatest living\r\npianists, has written much for piano and made many arrangements.\r\n\r\nAmong the world famous violinists, several living in America, Fritz\r\nKreisler (1875), Mischa Elman (1892) and Efrem Zimbalist (1889), have\r\nadded to violin literature, arrangements of piano pieces and songs, as\r\nwell as a few original compositions. Kreisler, with Victor Jacobi, wrote\r\nthe music for the light opera _Apple Blossoms_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SOME PATRONS OF MUSIC IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nAmerica has been fortunate in its patrons of music who like the\r\nEsterhazys and Lobkowitzs of old have advanced music by founding and\r\nmaintaining orchestras, music schools, chamber music, festivals and\r\nprize competitions. Among these are Henry Lee Higginson (1834–1919),\r\nBoston Symphony; Harry Harkness Flagler, New York Symphony; W. A. Clark,\r\nLos Angeles Philharmonic; George Eastman, Rochester Symphony and Eastman\r\nSchool of Music; Juilliard Musical Foundation, Mrs. Edward Bok, Curtis\r\nInstitute of Music in Philadelphia; the Edward J. de Coppet (1855–1916),\r\nthe Flonzaley Quartet; Carl Stoeckel, festivals at Norfolk, Connecticut;\r\nMr. and Mrs. Daniel Guggenheim and Mr. and Mrs. Murry Guggenheim, summer\r\nconcerts by Edwin Franko Goldman’s Concert Band; Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nShurtleff Coolidge, Berkshire Chamber Music Festivals. Also the American\r\nSociety for the Publication of Chamber Music, the National Music League,\r\nthe Walter Naumberg prize, the National Federation of Music Clubs, the\r\nLeague of Composers, the National Bureau for the advancement of Music,\r\nand many music schools and settlements have helped to make music grow.\r\n\r\nIt is not out of place to include here Arthur P. Schmidt (1846–1921) of\r\nBoston as a patron of music, for by his devotion to American composers\r\nand the faith with which he published their works as early as 1876 has\r\nmade music grow. Under this head we must also include Gustav Schirmer\r\n(1829–1893) and Oliver Ditson (1811–1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SYMPHONY ORCHESTRAS\r\n\r\nBesides the orchestras in Boston, New York and Chicago, of which we have\r\nalready told you, many new ones have been formed to the advancement of\r\nmusic in America: Philadelphia, (Leopold Stokowski, conductor); Detroit,\r\n(Ossip Gabrilowitsch); San Francisco, (Alfred Hertz); Cincinnati, (Fritz\r\nReiner); Los Angeles, (Arthur Rodzinsky); St. Louis, (Guest Conductors);\r\nCleveland, (Nikolai Sokoloff and Rudolph Ringwall); Rochester, (Eugene\r\nGoossens); Syracuse, (Vladimir Shavitch); Omaha, (Sandor Harmati);\r\nPortland, Oregon, (Willem van Hoogstraten); Minneapolis, (Henri\r\nVerbrugghen); State Symphony Orchestra, New York City, founded by Josef\r\nStransky, (Emo von Dohnanyi and Alfredo Casella, in the season of\r\n1925–26); and the American Symphony Orchestra composed entirely of\r\nAmericans under Howard Barlow, founder and conductor; the Young Men’s\r\nSymphony Orchestra (Paul Henneberg), founded by the late Alfred Lincoln\r\nSeligman with Arnold Volpe, conductor; American Orchestral Society,\r\n(Chalmers Clifton). (See page 514.)\r\n\r\nBesides the orchestras mentioned, the symphony orchestras of the motion\r\npicture houses all over the country are doing a very great service by\r\nthe excellent music and the fine performances given to millions of\r\npeople every day.\r\n\r\nAmong orchestras which helped to build love of music in this country\r\nwere the Russian Symphony Orchestra (Modest Altschuler), the Volpe\r\nSymphony Orchestra (Arnold Volpe), and the People’s Symphony Concerts\r\n(F. X. Arens), all of which are out of existence.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years the desire for music in the summer time has\r\nled to many open air concerts and operas. Of these the concerts of the\r\nPhilharmonic Orchestra in the Lewisohn Stadium, those in the Hollywood\r\nBowl (Los Angeles, California), Willow Grove, Pa., the Goldman Concert\r\nBand, playing on the Campus of New York University and in Central Park\r\nare the most widely known.\r\n\r\nRavinia Park which provides one of the most magnificent opera companies\r\npossible to assemble makes a delightful summer night playground for\r\nChicago people.\r\n\r\nWe regret that opera has not kept pace with the symphony orchestras in\r\nAmerica. The Metropolitan Opera Company (New York City), the Chicago\r\nOpera Company (Chicago, Illinois), the San Francisco Opera Company (G.\r\nMerola’s new venture), the Philadelphia Civic and the American Opera\r\nCompany are in operation (1929). There are many cities holding summer\r\nopera.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to be proud of the growth of music in America, and\r\nNew York City today is the great musical center of the world.\r\n\r\nSince writing this chapter, New York has lost the State Symphony, The\r\nAmerican Symphony Orchestra, and the New York Symphony Society. Walter\r\nDamrosch has turned his orchestral interests to the radio in order to\r\nenlarge the sphere of music education. Due to the merger of the\r\nPhilharmonic Symphony, Ernest Schelling conducts the concerts for\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n                        Twentieth Century Music\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once an old man who said: “I have lived to see the post-chaise\r\ngive way to the locomotive but I _cannot_ and _will not_ accept the\r\nautomobile!” What would he have said to the aeroplane? But this old man\r\nwas not different from the people today, who seem unable to accept the\r\nnew music and take it as a personal affront when they must listen to it.\r\nLike the automobile and the aeroplane, however, it is here, and is a\r\npart of the 20th century!\r\n\r\nNothing that lives stands still; there must be constant change and\r\ngrowth, or decay sets in. This is as true of music as it is of ourselves\r\nand the things around us. We have watched this process of change in\r\nmusic from prehistoric man to the 20th century; we have seen certain\r\nperiods bursting with new ideas, works and forms; we have seen\r\nindividuals tower above their fellows, marking epochs to which their\r\nnames have become attached, like the Palestrinian era, the Bach era, and\r\nthe Wagner period; and we are living in a moment of new ideas, works and\r\nforms, on which we cannot pass final judgment. Time alone must be the\r\njudge!\r\n\r\nThere is no point at which a period ends and a new one begins, for they\r\noverlap. We saw harmony grow out of polyphony; we saw the romantic\r\nBeethoven rise out of the classic Beethoven; in the romantic Chopin, we\r\nfound the germs of impressionism (for definition, see page 483), and in\r\nDebussy’s impressionism, we see the breaking away from traditions into a\r\nnew world of sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             POLYFORM MUSIC\r\n\r\nWhen we begin our music lessons, we are taught the musical alphabet,—the\r\nmajor scale, and then, the minor and the chromatic. So accustomed are we\r\nto these scales that we forget there was a time when they did not exist,\r\nand that new ones may be added, for they are not fixed for all time.\r\nThere have been, as you know, the no-scale time, the pentatonic scale,\r\nthe Greek modes, the Ecclesiastical or Church modes, the diatonic (major\r\nand minor) scale, the chromatic scale and the so-called whole-tone scale\r\nof Debussy. Beethoven and all the writers of the classic period used the\r\ndiatonic scales which gave their works a definite tonality, that is, a\r\nhome tone to which all the tones try to return. If, for example, you\r\nsing _Yankee Doodle_ and stop before the last note, you feel very\r\nuncomfortable, because you have not sounded the home tone towards which\r\nall the tones are reaching. To the diatonic modes, Chopin and Wagner\r\nadded a frequent use of the chromatic scale, which enriched music. In\r\naddition to diatonic and chromatic harmony, along came Debussy with his\r\nmelodies in whole steps, and he also went back to the old Greek modes,\r\nusing them in new and unexpected ways. Today we have all the past to\r\ndraw upon and the composers are quick to take advantage of their rich\r\ninheritance and to add innovations.\r\n\r\nIn the 20th century the influences have come from Paris and\r\nVienna,—Debussy and Schoenberg,—and later Stravinsky, the Russian. From\r\nthe French has come a style of writing called _polytonality_, and from\r\nVienna has come _atonality_. Don’t be afraid of these names for they are\r\neasily explained!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of “Musical America.”_\r\n\r\n  _Arnold Schoenberg (Austrian)._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Igor Stravinsky (Russian)._\r\n]\r\n\r\n            _Composers of Music in Extremely Modern Style._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Claude Achille Debussy._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of Roland Manuel._\r\n\r\n  _Maurice Ravel._\r\n]\r\n\r\n            _Leaders of the French Impressionistic School._\r\n\r\nHaving said that _tonality_ is a system in which all tones gravitate to\r\na central tone (they all come home to roost!) it is not difficult to\r\nunderstand through the formation of the word _poly_—many, _tonal_—tones,\r\nthat it means the use of several keys or tonalities at the same time, a\r\ncounterpoint of key against key, or scale against scale, instead of note\r\nagainst note as it was in the Golden Age of Polyphony. Think of a\r\n_cantus firmus_ in C major, and a counter melody in F♯ minor! (Between\r\nourselves if _skilfully handled_, it has possibilities!) Ravel, Milhaud\r\nand Honegger know how to do it. Of course in the old system we change\r\nfrom key to key by means of a musical bridge called _modulation_, but in\r\npolytonality, the bridge is discarded, and the unrelated keys are heard\r\npiled on top of each other in layers.\r\n\r\n_Atonality_, the system which Schoenberg and his followers use, is based\r\non the chromatic scale of twelve half steps, on each one of which,\r\nchords (major and minor) may be built. This gives a more varied tonal\r\npaint-box than the old diatonic modes and the chromatic scale of former\r\ndays, for it has now become an independent scale, and is not a part of\r\nthe diatonic family.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MULTI-AND POLY-RHYTHMS\r\n\r\nRhythm also reflects this age of unrest, and there have been decided\r\nchanges which seem to return to the Middle Ages to the period of\r\nbar-less music writing. Instead of finding a piece written throughout in\r\n¾ metre or ⁴⁄₄, it will be _multi-rhythmic_ or _poly-rhythmic_.\r\n_Multi-rhythmic_ means many shiftings from one rhythm to another;\r\n_poly-rhythmic_ means a counterpoint of different rhythms all played at\r\nthe same time. The English composer, Cyril Scott, uses multi-rhythms\r\n(where almost every measure changes its metre), and the French Florent\r\nSchmitt uses poly-rhythms, (for example, triplets against eighth notes\r\nin common time in the right hand, and ⁶⁄₈ metre in the left).\r\n\r\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries every one wrote motets, masses and\r\nmadrigals; in the 17th century every one wrote suites and from this time\r\non, opera; in the 18th, sonata form; in the 19th, sonatas and short\r\nromantic pieces. In the 20th century, no one form is used more than\r\nanother, but all forms are undergoing changes as the composers reach out\r\nfor freedom. This is the day of the large orchestra and of the small\r\nchamber music groups; symphonies have been replaced by the shorter\r\nsymphonic poem, the tendency being for short forms. The four-hour music\r\ndrama has given way to the one-act operas, and the dance drama or ballet\r\nas the Russian Diaghilev introduced it, is a 20th century development.\r\nThe orchestral writing has changed greatly from the methods of Berlioz,\r\nWagner and Strauss, for while they were masters of large mass effects,\r\nthe composers of today are treating each instrument individually, in\r\nother words, they are using orchestration, _poly-instrumentally_! In\r\nchamber music, we have the string quartet, but in addition, many\r\nexperiments are being made in combining instruments of unrelated\r\nfamilies, like strings, wind, brass and percussion, as we find in\r\nStravinsky’s chamber music.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that modern music has no melody, but it would be more\r\ncorrect to say that it has _new_ melody, resulting from the attempt to\r\npush aside old forms, old harmonies, old rhythms; now we have arrived at\r\na new era of polyphony, abounding in dissonance, that often is\r\ncacophonous rather than harmonious. We call this period the POLYFORMIC\r\nera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ANOTHER RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nThe men who ushered in this POLYFORMIC era were Claude Debussy in Paris,\r\nArnold Schoenberg in Vienna, and Alexander Scriabin in Russia. Richard\r\nStrauss, then at his height, is a good example of the overlapping of two\r\nperiods, for he represents the classical German school of the 19th\r\ncentury, and has also pointed the way to the future. Igor Stravinsky,\r\nalthough younger, is one of the strongest factors in this new\r\nRenaissance which in scope and power reminds us of the rebirth of\r\nlearning in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nAnother cause for the breaking away from old forms and conditions was\r\nthe World War, which cut off the composers from the usual sources of\r\nmusical supply, and forced them to develop their own ideas. This led to\r\nnew groups arising in all parts of the world, who, rebelling against\r\nrestraint, put wild experiments in the place of time honored customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CLAUDE ACHILLE DEBUSSY\r\n\r\nAlthough Claude Achille Debussy (1862–1918) was almost forty when the\r\n20th century came in, only in this century has his work been known and\r\nimitated. He was the direct outcome of a movement in France, after the\r\nFranco-Prussian War to develop French music along the lines started by\r\nRameau and Couperin. This meant breaking away from the classic models of\r\nBeethoven and the dramatic music of Wagner. He exchanged the romantic\r\nstyle of Schumann and Chopin for a new impressionistic style.\r\n\r\nClaude Debussy was born in St. Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. He attended\r\nthe Paris Conservatory when he was eleven and studied with Marmontel,\r\nLavignac and Guiraud. In 1884, with a cantata, _L’Enfant Prodigue_, he\r\nwon the _Prix de Rome_ which has started the career of so many French\r\ncomposers! During this, his first period, he wrote many lovely songs to\r\npoems by Verlaine and Baudelaire, the same impressionistic poets who\r\ninspired Charles Martin Loeffler in America; _Suite Bergamasque_, which\r\nincludes the lovely _Clair de Lune_ (_Moonlight_); the work which first\r\nbrought him fame, _L’Après-midi d’un Faune_ (_Afternoon of a Faun_); the\r\nbeautiful string quartet; _Chansons de Bilitis_; _Three Nocturnes for\r\nOrchestra_, and the unique opera _Pelleas and Melisande_, which took him\r\nten years to write! It was first given in the Paris _Opéra Comique_\r\n(1902).\r\n\r\nIn this opera, Debussy showed himself an innovator; it was a new kind of\r\nharmony and melody and never before had an opera like it been written.\r\nHe gave an exact impression in music of Maeterlinck’s imaginative,\r\nmystic play. This is not a case where music drowns the meaning of the\r\nstory but each word is colored and interpreted by the music. Debussy\r\naccomplished what the Camerata, Gluck and Wagner tried to do. By the\r\ntime he wrote _Pelleas and Melisande_, his style was established and the\r\nproof of his high attainment is seen in his many imitators.\r\n\r\nHe worked very slowly and carefully and often destroyed what had taken\r\nhim hours to write. Although an innovator, he was a deep student well\r\ngrounded in the traditions of the past, a lover of Mozart and of the\r\n18th century French writers, and when he seemingly broke all rules he\r\ngave something new in their place, not in the spirit of experiment but\r\nof sincere conviction.\r\n\r\nHe was surrounded by painters who like Claude Monet, Pissarro and Sisley\r\ndid not paint _actual things_, but rather ideals of things; and by poets\r\nwho like Verlaine, Gustave Kahn, Henri de Régnier, Pierre Louys and\r\nStéphane Mallarmé did not write about _things_ but rather the\r\n_impression_ and _images_ things gave them. He was absorbed and\r\ndelighted by this non-photographic kind of art and translated into his\r\nmusic the veiled, mystic, idealistic, silver glimmering impressions that\r\nothers put into paint and into words. This is _Impressionism_ in art.\r\n\r\nMusically, Debussy was influenced by Wagner, although he fought against\r\nhim, and by some of the French composers in whose day he began to write,\r\nlike Chabrier and Chausson. From Moussorgsky and other Russians he\r\nlearned much about old modes, color effects and free expression; and\r\nwith Erik Satie he talked over many musical problems, no doubt gaining\r\nmuch from this curious musical caricaturist and humorist. No matter how\r\nextreme and absurd Debussy’s music might have sounded twenty-five years\r\nago to the people, they must have felt the mystic beauty and rare poetic\r\ncharm of his work.\r\n\r\nSomeone, as a joke, put a Butterick pattern on a playerpiano roll as a\r\nmusic record, and it sounded so ridiculous that a composer hearing it,\r\nsaid: “Ah, that must be a Debussy piece!” But, you see this was\r\ntwenty-five years ago!\r\n\r\nNo matter how revolutionary his piano pieces may have sounded, today\r\nthey have become almost classics! The combination of poetic imagination,\r\nromanticism and impressionism are seen in the titles: _Reflets dans\r\nl’eau_ (_Reflections in the Water_), _L’Isle joyeuse_ (_Happy Island_),\r\n_La Cathédrale engloutie_ (_The Engulfed Cathedral_), _Jardins sous la\r\npluie_ (_Gardens in the Rain_).\r\n\r\nFor his daughter Claude, who died the year after her father, Debussy\r\nwrote six little piano pieces called the _Children’s Corner_. At the\r\ntime he was writing them, little Claude used to drag the manuscripts\r\naround like a ragdoll, telling anyone she met, “These are _my_ pieces,\r\nmy father is writing them for me.” They were: _Dr. Gradus ad Parnassum_,\r\n_Jimbo’s Lullaby_, _The Doll’s Serenade_, _The Snow Falls_, _The Little\r\nShepherd_ and _Golliwogg’s Cakewalk_.\r\n\r\nAmong his later works are: Three symphonic sketches, _La Mer_ (_The\r\nSea_); the mystery play on a book by d’Annunzio, _Le Martyre de St.\r\nSebastien_ (_The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian_); a work for two pianos,\r\n_Noir et Blanc_ (_Black and White_); a _Sonata for Violoncello and\r\nPiano_ and twelve _Studies for Piano_.\r\n\r\nIn his _Minstrels_, _Children’s Corner_ and _General Lavine_ we find\r\n_humor_, a characteristic of 20th century music.\r\n\r\nHis music was vague and dreamy, and many composers were weakened rather\r\nthan strengthened by trying to imitate him, for they had neither his\r\ngenius nor his poetry. What he gave us was genuine, what others tried to\r\ncopy was affected. His inventions such as the whole-tone scale and the\r\npastel shades of music were so much a part of him that to use them today\r\nshows a lack of originality. But to those coming after him, who did not\r\nimitate him but worked out their own ways, he was a path-breaker of\r\ngreat value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MAURICE RAVEL\r\n\r\nMaurice Ravel (1875) has lived in or near Paris most of his life,\r\nalthough he was born in Ciboure, Basses-Pyrénées. He was a student at\r\nthe Conservatory under Gabriel Fauré and André Gédalge. He did not\r\nreceive the _Prix de Rome_, perhaps because in his early works he\r\nalready showed tendencies, which must have seemed revolutionary to\r\nmusicians who had not yet grown accustomed to the innovations of\r\nDebussy. Ravel developed his ideas at the same time and under the same\r\ninfluences as Debussy. You will often hear that Ravel imitated Debussy,\r\nbut it is less an imitation than a development along the same lines.\r\nRavel, too, is an impressionist, a poet, a lover of veiled mystic\r\neffects, _suggesting_ images rather than _reproducing_ them. He has a\r\nkeen rhythmic sense, perhaps a heritage of his birthplace, so close to\r\nthe Spanish border.\r\n\r\nNone of the 20th century composers understands the orchestra better than\r\nRavel as may be seen in his ballet _Daphnis and Chloe_, _Rhapsodie\r\nEspagnole_, his delightful _Mother Goose_ and _La Valse_. His short\r\nopera, _L’heure espagnole_ is full of charming music and splendid\r\nworkmanship; his quartet written in 1902–3 is one of the finest examples\r\nof 20th century chamber music. For piano he has added a rich\r\ncontribution in the _Sonatina_, _Pavane for a Dead Child_, _Valses\r\nnobles et sentimentales_, _Les Miroirs_ (_Looking Glasses_), _Gaspard de\r\nla Nuit_, _Le Tombeau de Couperin_ (_The Tomb of Couperin_), and his\r\nsongs are very beautiful, including _Histoires Naturelles_ (_Natural\r\nHistory_) and the Greek and Hebrew folk songs.\r\n\r\nRavel’s latest work is a revelation of all his abilities, _L’Enfant et\r\nles Sortilèges_ (_The Child’s Sorceries_), a ballet in early form with\r\nmodern music. It is a fantasy tale about a little boy, who will not do\r\nhis lessons and in a fury injures a squirrel; the chairs, grandfather’s\r\nclock, frogs, fairies, sprites, squirrels, arithmetic dwarfs from the\r\nbook he has destroyed, and tea-pots rebel and talk “at him,” until he\r\nbinds up the wound of the squirrel. Into this, Ravel puts humor and even\r\nsentiment; he makes some of the chairs dance a minuet, other characters,\r\na fox trot, and includes many old and new dances. He shows his magic\r\nhandling of the orchestra and with extreme cleverness he even has the\r\nchair and the shepherdess sing a song in canon form and at the end all\r\njoin in singing a fugue of “heavenly beauty.”\r\n\r\nA follower of Ravel is Maurice Delage, who has written some very\r\ninteresting songs and an orchestral work in which he is modern enough to\r\nimitate the sounds of an iron foundry!\r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic follower and friend of Ravel, is Roland Manuel, critic,\r\nwriter and composer. He has never written what is called _ultra_ (very)\r\nmodern music, but everything he does, songs, chamber music, operetta, or\r\nballet is marked with good taste, refinement and fine musicianship.\r\n\r\nOther Frenchmen who have added to the 20th century style are Paul Dukas\r\n(1865), whose opera based on Maeterlinck’s _Ariane et Barbe Bleue_\r\n(_Ariadne and Blue Beard_) is second only to Debussy’s _Pelleas et\r\nMelisande_; Vincent d’Indy (1851); Déodat de Sévérac (1873–1921), a\r\nwriter of charming piano music whose impressionism reflects his love of\r\nNature; Albert Roussel (1869), a pupil of the Schola Cantorum, whose\r\nSymphony and opera _Padmavati_ show splendid talent; Florent Schmitt\r\n(1870) whose orchestral works and piano quintet are important; André\r\nCaplet (1880–1925), Charles Koechlin (1867), and Erik Satie (1869–1925).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ERIK SATIE—CARTOONIST\r\n\r\nErik Satie is a riddle! Many are the heated discussions he has caused.\r\nHis influence has been through what he has said, not what he has done.\r\nHe was a caricaturist rather than a great composer, giving amusing\r\ntitles to frivolous little pieces that show humor, in which one never\r\nknows whether he was laughing _at_ or _with_ the world. He loved short\r\ndisconnected pieces and did much to make the young composer break away\r\nfrom long symphonic forms. He was a friend of Debussy, godfather to the\r\n_Group of Six_, and later to four “youngsters” who call themselves the\r\n“School of Arcueil” where Satie lived. His name should have been Satyr\r\nfor with his pointed ears, eyebrows, and beard, he looked the part!\r\nAmong his compositions are the ballets, _Parades_ and _Relache_, and a\r\ndramatic aria with orchestra, _Socrates_.\r\n\r\nThe School of Arcueil, which has not yet proven its value is composed of\r\nSauguet, Maxime Jacob, Desormières and Clicquet-Pleyel, who take\r\npleasure in American jazz effects and have tried amusing experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GROUP OF SIX\r\n\r\nThe World War reacted directly and indirectly upon a group of composers\r\nin France. Daring and brutality are the keynote of almost all the works\r\nof the years from 1914 to the present day. Debussy and Ravel with their\r\npoetic imagery did not express the feelings of the younger men, so they\r\nwere pitilessly brushed aside by _Les Jeunes_ (The Young) who overthrew\r\nthe accepted forms for their own experiments.\r\n\r\nThese young composers did not band together like the “Russian Five,” but\r\na French critic called them “The Six,” and the name stuck! They were not\r\nunited by oneness of purpose or by ideal, they just happened to be\r\nfriends and their music was often presented on the same programs and\r\nErik Satie “who had been throughout thirty-five years the instigator of\r\nall audacity, the manager of all impudence” was their confidential\r\nadviser. The six are Germaine Tailleferre who played her piano concerto\r\nin America (1925) and has written two charming ballets; Louis Durey\r\n(1888); Georges Auric (1899), and François Poulenc (1899), both of whom\r\nhave written ballets; Darius Milhaud (1892) and Arthur Honegger (1892).\r\n\r\nOf these, Milhaud and Honegger are by far the most important. Milhaud\r\nhas written ballets, chamber music and orchestral works with great\r\nfluency, often showing fine gifts and flashes of beauty. Born into this\r\nage of storm and stress, Milhaud has written brutally, but he is at\r\nheart a romantic composer and will probably change as we get further\r\naway from the war.\r\n\r\nHonegger has had a sensational success with a work in oratorio form, _Le\r\nRoi David_ (_King David_), and with a tone poem, _Pacific—231_, which is\r\na type of locomotive. Honegger has broken from the Group, and has gone\r\nhis own independent way, writing beautiful songs, orchestral and chamber\r\nmusic, and giving promise of being one of the most important composers\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\nThere are many other young French composers showing the different\r\ntendencies of the day, some are writing in classic form, some in\r\nromantic, but all are very independent. Some have wiped out the past and\r\nare trying to build anew, not realizing that they are building on sand,\r\nfor there can be no skyscraper without a foundation deep enough to carry\r\nit!\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ALEXANDER SCRIABIN\r\n\r\nAlexander Nicolai Scriabin (1871–1915) was born in Moscow, Russia, and\r\nwas sent to a military school; instead of becoming an army officer, he\r\nturned to music, and was a pupil of Safonov, for several years conductor\r\nof the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and of Taneiev. His early works\r\nshow the influence of Chopin and Arensky, but he soon developed a style\r\nof his own, that has made him one of the important composers of the\r\nbeginning of the 20th century. An English writer, Eaglefield Hull,\r\nthinks that “the sonatas of Scriabin are destined in the future to\r\noccupy a niche of their own, together with the forty-eight Preludes of\r\nBach, the thirty-two Sonatas of Beethoven, and the piano works of\r\nChopin.” To explain in a few words the innovations of Scriabin would be\r\nimpossible, but he broke away from fixed scales and tonality, and opened\r\nnew roads to composers following. He used neither polytonality nor\r\natonality, although his methods border on the latter. He built new\r\nchords, not major and minor as we know them, but in intervals of\r\nfourths. Here is a typical Scriabin chord which he used as we use a\r\nmajor triad (c-e-g) as the center around which to build a composition:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chord]\r\n\r\nWon’t you be surprised to hear that Scriabin went back to Pythagoras and\r\nhis theory of harmonics or overtones to get this chord? He called these\r\ncombinations “mystic chords” for he was a student of Theosophy, and\r\nwanted to use music as a means to express occult ideas. With this in\r\nmind, he wrote a tone-poem, _Prometheus_, which, according to Scriabin’s\r\ndirections, Modest Altschuler played in New York with a color organ\r\nthrowing colors on a screen while the orchestra was playing the music.\r\nTwo other of his large works for orchestra _Le Divin Poème_ and _Le\r\nPoème de L’Extase_ show his extraordinary harmonic originality.\r\n\r\nBesides the ten sonatas in very free form, he wrote hundreds of shorter\r\npiano pieces, disclosing his deep poetic, mystic nature. Composers have\r\nimitated him, but his music is so tagged with Scriabin’s individuality\r\nthat, like the whole-tone scale of Debussy, imitation is easily\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\n\r\n              L’ENFANT TERRIBLE OF MODERN MUSIC—STRAVINSKY\r\n\r\nIgor Stravinsky (1882) has influenced more young musicians than any\r\nother living composer! He intended to become a lawyer, but instead\r\nstudied composition with Rimsky-Korsakov, and his early works reflect\r\nhis teacher. We never know how meeting someone may change our course in\r\nlife, and Stravinsky’s meeting with Serge Diaghilev changed his!\r\n\r\nDiaghilev, director of the _Russian Ballet_, recognized a gift in the\r\nyoung Stravinsky, who was busy writing an opera from a fairy tale of\r\nHans Christian Andersen, _The Nightingale_. He commissioned him to write\r\na ballet on a fairy tale, _L’Oiseau de Feu_ (_The Fire Bird_) which was\r\nproduced in Paris (1910) and brought Stravinsky instant fame. The next\r\nyear this was followed by the delightful _Petrouchka_. His most famous\r\nscore _Le Sacre du Printemps_ (_Rites of Spring_) was produced in Paris\r\nin 1913, causing a near-riot, as it was received with hissing and\r\ncatcalls by a public unprepared for its brutality, its savage rhythm,\r\nand raucous dissonance.\r\n\r\nIn this work Stravinsky went back to primitive times when Russia was\r\npagan, and he explains, “Thus we see Russian peasants dancing in the\r\nspringtime, accompanying the rhythms by their gestures and their feet.”\r\nAn English critic Edwin Evans, sees behind the pagan rite, “The\r\nmarvelous power ... in all Nature to grow, to develop, and to assume new\r\nforms.” (We have watched this happen in music.)\r\n\r\nAfter _Le Sacre du Printemps_, Stravinsky wrote _Les Noces_ a ballet\r\nfounded on pagan Russian marriage customs. In this work he has used a\r\nchorus of voices and four pianos in place of an orchestra. He finished\r\nthe opera _The Nightingale_ and in 1917 wrote an orchestral poem based\r\non the themes from the opera.\r\n\r\nIn the short ballet _L’Histoire du Soldat_ (_Story of the Soldier_),\r\nStravinsky has used popular music of the fair, circus, music hall, not\r\nfolk music, and we find our jazz and tango in it, as also in his _Piano\r\nRag Music_ and _Ragtime_ for orchestra. His songs composed for the most\r\npart to nonsense verses, are among the cleverest things he has done.\r\n\r\nStravinsky wrote a group of string quartet pieces in which he made the\r\nviolins sound like bells. This was not because he tried to imitate bells\r\nbut on the strings he uses the harmonics or overtones that are heard in\r\nbells. This is one of the secrets of his unusual harmonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OVERTONES\r\n\r\nWe hear so much about overtones and harmonics that perhaps we can trace\r\nfor you the growth of music along the path of Pythagoras’ theory,\r\nshowing how we arrived at this era of dissonance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HARMONIC SERIES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Series]\r\n\r\nFirst men and women singing in unison produced music in octaves, 1 and 2\r\nof the harmonic series. Next came the centuries of _organum_ when the\r\nparts were sung in fifths and fourths, 2, 3, and 4 of the harmonic\r\nseries. Then followed the centuries of the major triad (c-e-g), 4, 5,\r\nand 6 of the harmonic series. When the 7th overtone in the harmonic\r\nseries appeared, we had the very important dominant 7th chord\r\n(c-e-g-b♭), looked upon as outrageous heresy and dissonance! It was\r\nyears, even centuries, before it was admitted as a respectable member of\r\nthe family! The 9th harmonic forming the dominant 9th chord (c-e-g-b♭-d)\r\nhad the same hard row to hoe, and is one of our modern chords. César\r\nFranck shocked the musicians by opening his famous violin sonata with\r\nthis chord! We can trace the whole-tone scale of Debussy to the 7th,\r\n8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th overtones of the series, (b♭-c-d-e-f#).\r\nScriabin’s “mystic chord” is formed from the 8th, 11th, 7th, 10th, 14th,\r\nand 9th overtones (c-f#–b♭-e-a-d). It is a short step now to\r\n_polytonality_ and _atonality_, to Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Milhaud, and\r\nHonegger.\r\n\r\nYou have seen the white ray of sunlight enter your window, which upon a\r\nsecond glimpse divides into all the colors of the rainbow. In other\r\nwords, the white light is the _fundamental tone_, which is the _sum_ of\r\n_all the other colors_, much as any _single tone_ is the _sum_ of _its\r\novertones_, and it is with these overtones that our modern composers are\r\nexperimenting. Here we see that modern music is the result of\r\n_evolution_ (slow growth) and not _revolution_!\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HEART MUSIC DISAPPEARS\r\n\r\nStravinsky, _l’enfant terrible_ in music, the most daring composer of a\r\nmost daring period has thrown over all restraint! His music has no heart\r\nquality, and so strongly is he influencing the younger men, that “heart\r\nmusic” has gone out of style, a brusque, ugly music taking its place,\r\nbecause the composers are afraid that to show sentiment would be\r\nweakness! However, the high class music of today is trying to express\r\nhumor, activity and vigor, for which reason our jazz appeals to\r\nEuropeans. The War made Stravinsky the “man of the hour” in music. He is\r\nthe direct opposite of the refined, beauty-worshipping Debussy and\r\nmystic Scriabin. The composers upset by the devastating war, needed\r\nstrong food, and they hungrily pounced upon the morsels flung to them by\r\nStravinsky, the ring-leader.\r\n\r\nBut withal, “the worm will turn” and already, those with ears to hear,\r\nrealize a change in the air, and they foretell a new classic period made\r\nout of this hurly-burly of many forms, touched by the fairy wand,\r\n“Things-that-Live”! And Stravinsky himself has turned.\r\n\r\nAfter Stravinsky had written several ballets for his countryman,\r\nDiaghilev, he turned his attention to chamber music, and wrote works for\r\nsmall groups of wind instruments and a string quartet, _Concertino_, and\r\na concerto for piano and wind instruments, in which he tried all sorts\r\nof experiments. He believes in _absolute music_, and has written these\r\nwithout _program_, making the music express what he has to say. Whether\r\nhe has succeeded, must be laid before Judge Time. He is supreme master\r\nof orchestration, and is largely responsible for treating each\r\ninstrument as though it were playing a solo, which we described as\r\npoly-instrumentation. We should not have enjoyed Stravinsky as a\r\nneighbor, for he begged, borrowed or bought every kind of instrument and\r\nlearned all their tricks by trying them out himself.\r\n\r\nWe know very little of what is going on in Russia today, but Serge\r\nProkofiev, one of the younger Russian composers, has left his home and\r\nlives in Paris where his works are often given. He has written piano\r\nconcertos, violin concertos, and the best we have heard from his pen is\r\na chorus with orchestral accompaniment, _Sept, ils sont Sept_ (_Seven,\r\nthey are seven_). He has also written ballets and operas.\r\n\r\nA fellow-student with Serge Prokofiev in the Petrograd conservatory was\r\nNicolai Miaskovsky, now living in Moscow where he heads the musical\r\nmovement. His principal works are symphonies, one of which was played in\r\nParis by a countryman, Lazare Saminsky, in June, 1925.\r\n\r\nAnother young composer whose piano sonatas have come out of Russia is\r\nSamuel Feinberg. They are somewhat in the style of Scriabin.\r\n\r\nThe two Tcherepnins, father and son, are living in Paris. The son,\r\nAlexander, has written chamber music in 20th century style.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 POLAND\r\n\r\nIn modern Poland, Karol Szymanowski (1883) has written symphonies,\r\nchamber music, songs, piano sonatas and many other piano pieces which\r\nreflect Polish national color and French impressionism (See Page 520).\r\n\r\nLady Dean Paul, who writes under the name of Poldowski, although living\r\nin London, is really a Pole. (Page 439.)\r\n\r\nTadeusz Iarecki, of New York City, recently received a prize in Poland\r\nfor writing the best composition by a native composer. This same quartet\r\ntook the first Berkshire Chamber Music Prize (1918) and was published in\r\nNew York by a society whose object is the publication of American\r\nChamber Music.\r\n\r\nAlexander Tansman (1892) a young Pole has met with unusual success in\r\nParis, where he writes works for orchestra, chamber music and ballet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ARNOLD SCHOENBERG, MUSICAL ANARCHIST\r\n\r\nArnold Schoenberg, born in Vienna (1874), taught himself until he was\r\ntwenty. He then studied with Alexander von Zemlinsky, who later became\r\nhis brother-in-law. Zemlinsky once pointed him out saying, “He is in his\r\nearly twenties and I have taught him all I know; he brought me an\r\norchestral work recently for which he had to paste two pieces of score\r\npaper together to write out his score, so large an orchestra had he\r\nemployed!” This was his tone poem, _Pelleas and Melisande_, first\r\nperformed in 1904. To this early period belong some songs, a song cycle\r\nwith orchestra on texts by Jens Peter Jacobsen, _Gurrelieder_, and the\r\nsextet, _Verklärte Nacht_ (_Illumined Night_).\r\n\r\nBoth Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler were his friends, and through\r\nMahler’s efforts many of his compositions were performed. His string\r\nquartet was played in America by the Flonzaley Quartet. His Chamber\r\nSymphony, and his second string quartet, with solo voice, performed\r\n(1924) at the Berkshire Chamber Music Festival, belong to this same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSo far, all that Schoenberg composed was based more or less on models of\r\nthe past, but being naturally an anarchist in music he tried to escape\r\nfrom doing what others had done. Instead of writing works that took\r\nfifty minutes to play like his string quartet (in one movement), he\r\nwrote five orchestral pieces and piano pieces that were mere suggestions\r\nof compositions, so short were they. He cut out all development of\r\nthemes, all old forms, all feeling for tonality, writing in the\r\ntwelve-tone scale which we explained as _atonality_; he built his chords\r\nin intervals of fourths instead of thirds, and purposely changed all the\r\nrules of harmony; he distorted all the intervals, using a seventh or\r\nninth instead of the octave, and making every fourth and fifth a half\r\nstep larger or smaller than was customary. His melodies are marked by\r\nlarge skips and queer intervals, but when one once knows his language,\r\nby its very queerness, it is easily recognized as Schoenberg’s. Although\r\nhe has broken away from the slavery of old traditions, he may have\r\n“jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire”!\r\n\r\nIn _Pierrot Lunaire_, a cycle of twenty-one songs with chamber music\r\naccompaniment, he uses a curious effect for the voice “which must be\r\nneither sung nor spoken.” This same effect he uses in chorus in his\r\nmusic drama, _Die Glückliche Hand_ (_The Lucky Hand_) for which he also\r\nwrote the libretto. Although this and another music drama _Erwartung_\r\n(_The Awaiting_) were begun in 1909, they were both performed for the\r\nfirst time in 1924 in Vienna. This long delay was due to the prejudice\r\nagainst the work of this innovator, who on the one hand has been laughed\r\nat, scorned, and reviled, and on the other praised to the skies by a\r\nsmall group of disciples and imitators whose works sound very much like\r\ntheir teacher’s.\r\n\r\nAmong these pupils are Egon Wellesz (1885) who more than the other\r\ndisciples has broken away from the master. He has gone his way in\r\nwriting music for the stage and combining the old ideas of ballet and\r\norchestral music with Greek drama in a modern dance drama. He has also\r\nwritten interesting chamber and orchestral music. Dr. Wellesz is also an\r\nauthority on musical history; he has written many books and articles on\r\nthe subject, especially on early opera, Byzantine and Oriental music. He\r\nhas written a book on Schoenberg (1921).\r\n\r\nAlban Berg (1885), also a Schoenberg pupil, has written unusually fine\r\nchamber music and a new opera, _Wozzek_, fragments of which were played\r\nat a festival in Prague (Czecho-Slovakia) in May, 1925, by the\r\nInternational Society of Contemporary Music, a movement most valuable in\r\nencouraging and developing modern music. This society holds yearly\r\nmeetings in Europe, at which are heard the works of all the young\r\ncomposers of the world, each country having a branch, which sends its\r\nshare of new works to make the festival’s programs.\r\n\r\nOthers of the Schoenberg group are Anton von Webern (1883), Paul Pisk,\r\nKarl Horovitz (1884–1925), Ernest Krenek, and Ernest Toch (1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ERICH KORNGOLD\r\n\r\nErich Wolfgang Korngold (1898) startled the musical world, just before\r\nthe War, by the astonishing compositions he wrote as a little boy. Among\r\nthese were orchestral works and a piano sonata of extraordinary promise.\r\nHe was born in Vienna and is the son of a musician and musical critic.\r\nYoung Korngold is known in America as the composer of _Die Todte Stadt_\r\n(_The Dead City_) an opera in which the soprano, Maria Jeritza, made her\r\nfirst appearance at the Metropolitan Opera House. In many ways the opera\r\ngoes back to the old pre-Wagner form and is full of melody, unusual in a\r\nyoung 20th century composer! He has written other operas bordering on\r\nthe lighter Viennese operetta and has kept away from the Schoenberg\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MODERN GERMAN MUSIC\r\n\r\nRichard Strauss was the last of the great classic school of German\r\ncomposers, which for two hundred years had led the world in music.\r\nCurious as it seems, he has not influenced directly the younger\r\ncomposers, who turned to Debussy, Busoni, Schoenberg and Stravinsky.\r\n(Page 410.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BUSONI THE GREAT\r\n\r\nFerruccio Busoni (1866–1924) although an Italian, had a strong influence\r\nin two fields of German music, that of piano playing and composing. He\r\nlived in Berlin and was one of the brilliant thinkers and musicians of\r\nthe period. He left chamber music and orchestral works, also several\r\noperas, one of which, _The Harlequin_, finished just before his untimely\r\ndeath, combines traditional form with radical ideas. His sonatinas for\r\npiano and a set of studies on American _Indian Themes_ are important. He\r\nmade a deep study of all methods, old and new, and gave his pupils the\r\nadvantage of this wide experience.\r\n\r\nAlthough the young Germans are not copying the huge symphonic form of\r\nBruckner and Mahler, these two have gained greatly in popularity and are\r\nserving as models. Hans Pfitzner (1869), opera composer, is one of the\r\nmost German of the living composers of the pre-war period; Franz\r\nSchreker (1878), an Austrian, living in Berlin, has taught many of the\r\nyounger composers. He writes operas and songs. Schoenberg, although in\r\nVienna, is felt even in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HINDEMITH\r\n\r\nOf the young Germans, Paul Hindemith is the most important. He was born\r\nin 1895 and according to Riemann, “is the freshest and most full-blooded\r\ntalent among the younger German composers.” He seems to satisfy the two\r\nfactions, for he is not too radical for the Old or too old-fashioned for\r\nthe New, so as Lawrence Gilman says, “he carries water on both\r\nshoulders.... He seems to be able to write polytonally or atonally if he\r\nchooses, and also to write as the Academics might observe, like a\r\ngentleman. Richard Strauss is reported to have said to him: ‘Why do you\r\nwrite atonally when you have talent?’”\r\n\r\nToday he is viola player in the Amar Quartet, but he has played in\r\ncafés, in the “movies,” dance halls, operetta theatres, and jazz bands!\r\nAlthough only thirty, he has many chamber music pieces to his credit and\r\nthree dramatic works. His success has been tremendous.\r\n\r\nA society to further an interest in the new music was founded by Hermann\r\nScherchen and Eduard Erdmann. Scherchen created a sensation in Berlin\r\njust before the war by conducting Schoenberg’s _Pierrot Lunaire_, and\r\nafter having been a prisoner of war in Russia he came back with renewed\r\npurpose of bringing the new music to the public. He has published a few\r\nsongs and a string quartet. His right-hand man Erdmann, besides being a\r\npianist, has written a symphony, the first attempt of a youth without\r\norchestral experience, which astonished the audience as a combination of\r\nRichard Strauss, Schoenberg, “to which is added a portion of genuine\r\nErdmann flavor,” says Hugo Leichtentritt.\r\n\r\nAnother young German is Heinz Tiessen (1887), who is writing besides\r\npiano music in _atonality_, incidental music to a drama by Hauptman, and\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nPhilipp Jarnach (1892), a pupil of Busoni, Spanish by birth, educated in\r\nParis, lives in Berlin and writes in the new style. Kurt Weill (1900) is\r\nalso a gifted Busoni-ite.\r\n\r\nErnst Toch (1887), Viennese by birth, who lives in Germany has written\r\nstring quartets, sonatas, concertos, and a symphony.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Kaminsky is accepted in Germany as the composer who is trying\r\nto build a bridge from Bach to modern times. His _Concerto Grosso_ for\r\ndouble orchestra commands great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HUNGARY—BARTÓK AND KODÁLY\r\n\r\nBéla Bartók (1881) and his friend Soltan Kodály (1882) have done much to\r\nbring Hungarian folk music into the modern world, for they are steeped\r\nin folk tunes, which they use with skill and imagination. Bartók has\r\nwritten a short opera, two ballets, orchestral works, string quartets,\r\nviolin sonata, and many piano compositions. His children’s pieces are\r\ndelightful, based as they are on Hungarian folk tunes.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken at length of the gypsy music of the Hungarians brought to\r\nus by Brahms, Liszt and Sarasate (violinist and composer). We also told\r\nyou that the Hungarians were Magyars. Adjoran Otvos, in the _League of\r\nComposers Review_ says: “Bartók and Kodály have accomplished a pioneer\r\nwork of quite a different nature, an exploration into the folk music of\r\nHungary which has yielded a collection of historic significance, the\r\nmost important and only authentic one made in that country.\r\n\r\n“Bartók, poor and supported only by a scholarship, started in 1905, an\r\ninvestigation of the music of his race. Spending a week with a friend in\r\nthe country, he heard a servant, while at work, singing a tune quite\r\ndifferent from the hybrid (mixed breed) gypsy airs which pass for Magyar\r\nmusic, in Hungary and elsewhere. He contrived to conceal himself and day\r\nafter day, while the servant worked, recorded a number of songs whose\r\nprimitive character, he at once recognized. With this impetus, he\r\nembarked on a tour which lasted over two years, as long as his money\r\nheld out. On his journeys among the peasants he met Kodály, out on a\r\nsimilar mission of research. Without previous inkling of each other’s\r\naims, they proceeded together, recording the ancient songs of the\r\nMagyars in the compilation which is famous today.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ERNEST VON DOHNÁNYI\r\n\r\nErnest von Dohnányi (1877) a noted pianist and composer of Hungary has\r\nspent most of his life in Berlin and has toured Europe and America in\r\npiano recitals. He has written many works for orchestra, chamber music,\r\npiano and opera, all of which show more influence of Brahms than of men\r\nof his own land. He has been engaged as conductor of the State Symphony\r\nOrchestra of New York for the season 1925–26.\r\n\r\nA twenty-eight year old pupil of Béla Bartók, Georg Kosa, shows decided\r\ngifts in his first orchestral work, _Six Pieces for Orchestra_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CZECH SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe Czech school founded by Smetana and Dvorak and Zdenko Fibich\r\n(1850–1900) and continued by Vitezslav Novak (1870), Josef Suk (1874),\r\nand Vaclar Stepan (1889), has had a rebirth in the 20th century. Leos\r\nJanacek, although over seventy, is the leading spirit; Rudolf Karel\r\n(1881), a pupil of Dvorak, Bohuslav Martinu, a follower of Stravinsky,\r\nand Ernest Krenek (1902), a pupil of Schreker, and Alois Haba (1893),\r\npupil of Novak and Schreker are the working forces. (Janacek died in\r\n1928.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE QUARTER-TONE MAN\r\n\r\nAlois Haba first wrote chamber music, then he tried some interesting\r\nexperiments for which he is known as the “quarter-tone man.” We have\r\nheard of quarter-tones among the Hindus and Arabs (Chapter VI) and as\r\nthe human ear has become more educated, the possibility of dividing the\r\nscale into quarter-tones is much discussed, and seems to be the next\r\nstep in developing music along the line of overtones (see above). Did\r\nyou ever realize that as with eyes that are far-sighted or near-sighted,\r\nears may vary too, in the amount they hear? Most people think that every\r\none hears alike, but this is not so. Stravinsky was one day sitting with\r\na friend on the shore of a Swiss Lake near which he lived. The friend\r\nsaid the water was calm and still, but Stravinsky heard, a definite\r\nmusical sound! Many of these musical sounds unheard by our ears he has\r\nshown us in his music. In the same way it is said that Haba has an\r\nextraordinarily keen ear and in trying to express what he hears, he has\r\nwritten two string quartets in the quarter-tone system. Stringed\r\ninstruments are not in _tempered_ scales and lend themselves to any\r\ndivision of the interval, into third-tones, as Busoni tried, and\r\nquarter-tones as Haba has written. But he has gone further and has made\r\na piano on which quarter-tones may be played. This may prove to be the\r\nbasis of music of the future, or it may be merely one of the numerous\r\nexperiments without lasting value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Arthur Honegger._\r\n  (_Swiss-French_)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Darius Milhaud._\r\n  (_French_)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Musical Quarterly.”_\r\n\r\n  _Béla Bartók._\r\n  (_Hungarian_)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photograph, Victor Georg._\r\n\r\n  _Louis Gruenberg._\r\n  (_American_)\r\n]\r\n\r\n                         _Composers of Today._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Musical Digest.”_\r\n\r\n  _G.

Of late years opera has not been considered the highest form of\r\nmusical art, so with the coming of the 20th century, a group of\r\ncomposers has been working in Italy, trying to get away from the old\r\nopera writing and to develop along the line of orchestral and chamber\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nAlfredo Casella (1883) is perhaps responsible for this movement for he\r\nlived in Paris for many years and came in contact with Debussy’s music\r\nand the modern movement there. One of his earliest works to attract\r\nattention in America was _War Films_, a series of orchestral pictures\r\nthat were very real. He has written piano pieces, chamber music and\r\norchestral works and one of his latest is a ballet, in which it looks as\r\nthough he were leaving his path of dissonance for in this he has used\r\nfolk song as a basis for a new and delightful expression.\r\n\r\nG. Francesco Malipiero (1882) has written two string quartets, one of\r\nwhich received the Coolidge Prize of the Berkshire Chamber Music\r\nFestival; in these he has broken away from the large sonata form. He has\r\nalso written lovely songs.\r\n\r\nIldebrando Pizzetti (1880) has written two operas on texts by Gabrielle\r\nd’Annunzio called _La Nave_ (_The Ship_) and _Fedra_. His most recent\r\nwork, _Fra Ghirardo_ was performed at the Metropolitan in 1929.\r\n\r\nOttorino Respighi (1879) wrote operas in true Italian fashion, but\r\ndeserted them for chamber music and orchestral works. _Pines of Rome_\r\nand _Fountains of Rome_, we hear often. His _Violin Concerto in\r\nGregorian Mode_ was played by Albert Spalding. His latest opera, _La\r\nCampana Sommersa_ (_The Sunken Bell_) was given at the Metropolitan in\r\n1928.\r\n\r\nAll these men show the traces of the Italian love of melody, with the\r\ninfluence of French impressionism, and German romanticism.\r\n\r\nTwo or three of these modern Italians now live in Paris, among them\r\nSantoliquido and Vincenzo Davico, both song writers.\r\n\r\nAnd now _Noah’s Ark_ has been put to music by a young Italian, Vittorio\r\nRieti with wit and humor, in a work for orchestra, played in May, 1925,\r\nat the Prague Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MANUEL DE FALLA\r\n\r\nIn Spain, one man who has continued along the lines of Albeniz and\r\nGranados is Manuel de Falla (1876). He studied first with Felipe\r\nPedrell, the father of the modern Spanish school. In 1907 he went to\r\nParis where he met Debussy and Dukas. He wrote a ballet _El Amor Brujo_\r\n(_Love, the Magician_). He combines a picturesque Spanish folk style\r\nwith a modern way of writing music. One of his most attractive works is\r\na scenic arrangement from a chapter in _Don Quixote_, Cervantes’\r\nmasterpiece, as Spanish as a Spanish fandango. It is a marionette ballet\r\ncalled _El Retablo de Maese Pedro_ (_Master Pedro’s Puppet Show_). It is\r\na charming work and you will like it. His writings have simplicity, and\r\nfreshness, which can come only from deep study and so perfect a mastery\r\nof art that there is no self-consciousness. He is a true nationalist\r\ndelighting in Spanish color; his music has nobility and humanness as\r\nwell as charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE NETHERLANDS\r\n\r\nClarence G. Hamilton says in his _Outlines of Music History_ that\r\nNetherland composers are patriotically laboring for a distinctive\r\nschool. Few names are known outside of Holland, with the exception of\r\nAlphonse Diepenbroek (1862–1921), Dirk Schaefer (1874), Sem Dresden\r\n(1881), James Zwart (1892), Julius Roentgen (1855), who has collected\r\nmany of the Dutch folk songs, and Dopper, conductor and composer for\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, Jan Blockx (1851–1912) wrote successful operas and chamber\r\nmusic; Paul Gilson (1865) has written orchestral and chamber music works\r\nwhich have won him a foremost place among modern Flemish composers; both\r\nCésar Franck and Guillaume Lekeu were Flemish (Belgian); Joseph Jongen,\r\nwhile not writing in the very modern style, is well known for his\r\nsymphonic poems, chamber music, a ballet _S’Arka_ (produced at the\r\nThéâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels), songs, piano pieces and organ works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SWITZERLAND\r\n\r\nJaques Dalcroze (1865) is better known as the inventor of Eurythmics, a\r\nsystem of music study from the standpoint of rhythm, than as composer,\r\nbut he has written many charming songs in folk style. Gustave Doret\r\n(1866), has written several operas, cantatas, oratorios which have been\r\nperformed in his native land and in Paris. Hans Huber (1852) has a long\r\nlist of compositions in all forms. Ernest Bloch, though born in\r\nSwitzerland is living in America and is by far the greatest innovator of\r\nthese Swiss writers. Emile Blanchet, is a writer of piano music, rather\r\nmore poetic than of the very modern style. Arthur Honegger, the foremost\r\nyoung composer of France, though born in Havre, is often claimed as a\r\nSwiss composer, because his parents are Swiss. Rudolph Ganz, pianist,\r\ncomposer and conductor in America was born in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ENGLAND\r\n\r\nWhen we come to Frederick Delius (1863) we meet first with a new feeling\r\nin English music. He has written orchestral pieces (_Brigg Fair_,\r\nconcertos, _On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring_), chorals\r\n(_Appalachia_, _The Song of the High Hills_ and others), chamber music\r\nand songs. He was the first Englishman to write in the impressionistic\r\nway. His opera _The Village Romeo and Juliet_ is very modern in form,\r\nand the music interprets the story and is not built like the Italian\r\noperas.\r\n\r\nDelius is of Dutch-French-German stock, but was born in England, and has\r\nlived there and in France. He never tried for music posts or prizes but\r\nhas remained apart to compose. Though his work often sounds like the\r\n18th century virginal music, he is not conscious of it.\r\n\r\nHe has, in his chorals, done some of the best work since Beethoven, says\r\none biographer, and in them are strength, power and beauty, quite\r\ndifferent indeed from the sensuous and sweet smaller works. He is a\r\ncareful worker, a great idealist, and a truly great musician.\r\n\r\nThere are many well-trained musicians like Holbrooke and Hurlstone who\r\nhave done much for music in England but this chapter belongs to those\r\nwho are carrying on 20th century ideas.\r\n\r\nAmong them is Vaughan Williams (1872) to whom folk music is as bread to\r\nothers. He uses it whenever he can. In his _London Symphony_, his most\r\nfamous work, he has caught the spirit of the city and it is a milestone\r\nof the early 20th century. Isn’t it curious that the most important work\r\nwritten on the poetry of our American Walt Whitman is by an Englishman!\r\nThis is the _Sea Symphony_ for orchestra and chorus, an impressive work\r\nby Vaughan Williams. He has also written _Five Mystical Songs_, _Willow\r\nWood_ (cantata), _On Wenlock Edge_ (six songs), _Norfolk Rhapsodies_,\r\n_In the Fen Country_.\r\n\r\nGranville Bantock (1868) is a musical liberator for he was the first to\r\nfree English composers from the old style of Mendelssohn and the new\r\nkind of classicism of Brahms, and release them to write as they felt. He\r\nwrote music on the _Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam_ (Persian), _Sappho_,\r\n_Pierrot of the Minute_, _Fifine at the Fair_, _Hebredean_ (Scotch)\r\n_Symphony_, which shows his love of Scotch music, and many other works.\r\nHe succeeded Elgar at Birmingham University and has made valuable\r\nstudies and collections of Folk Music.\r\n\r\nA lover of chamber music, the fantasy and fancy, is Frank Bridge (1879).\r\nHe is a thorough musician and has written _The Sea_, the _Dance\r\nRhapsodies_ for orchestra, symphonic poem _Isabella_ on Keats’ poem of\r\nthe same name. _Three Idylls for Strings_ and other works.\r\n\r\nGustave Holst (1874) whose original name was von Holst although he is\r\nnot of German descent, was a pupil of Sir Charles V. Stanford and is now\r\nan inspiring teacher and conductor. He has had many posts and has\r\nwritten many important works: an opera, _The Perfect Fool_, the _Hymn to\r\nJesus_, one of the finest choral works of the century, _The Planets_, a\r\nvery fine orchestral work, military band music, songs and part songs,\r\nsome of which are written with violin accompaniment,—a charming idea!\r\n\r\nJohn Ireland (1879), has written a fine piano sonata and a violin\r\nsonata, _Decorations_ (a collection of small pieces), _Chelsea Reach_,\r\n_Ragamuffin_ and _Soho Forenoons_, chamber music and orchestral pieces.\r\n\r\nCyril Scott (1879) was trained in Germany. He is a mixture of French\r\nimpressionistic writing and Oriental mysticism, as you can see from the\r\ntitles of his pieces: _Lotus Land_ (Lotus is an Egyptian flower), _The\r\nGarden of Soul Sympathy_, and _Riki Tiki Tavi_, a setting of Kipling’s\r\nlittle chap of the Jungle Book, which is very delightful. He is one of\r\nthe first English Impressionists who paved the way for the young English\r\nSchool. He has made many interesting experiments in modern harmony and\r\nrhythm.\r\n\r\nArnold Bax (1883), of Irish parentage, is a gifted and poetic composer\r\nwho has written many things in small and large forms, chamber music and\r\npiano sonatas, _The Garden of Fand_ for orchestra, _Fatherland_, a\r\nchorus with orchestra and other things, all of which show him to have a\r\ncreative imagination and rich musical personality.\r\n\r\nLord Berners (1883) (Gerald Hugh Tyrwhitt-Wilson), a lover of the works\r\nof Stravinsky and Casella of the modern Russian and Italian Schools, was\r\ntrained in an old-fashioned way, and then Stravinsky and Casella, seeing\r\nin his music possibilities for freer writing, encouraged him to break\r\naway from old ways, and he became one of the most modern of the young\r\nEnglish composers. He writes interestingly in caricature and sarcasm, in\r\nfact he is a musical cartoonist in such pieces as the _Funeral March of\r\na Pet Canary_, _Funeral March of a Rich Aunt_, full of originality and\r\nof fun in choosing subjects. He wrote, too, three pieces, _Hatred_,\r\n_Laughter_ and _A Sigh_ which are amazing musical studies. His work is\r\ninteresting because of its daring in his very correct surroundings.\r\n\r\nEugene Goossens (1893) of Flemish ancestry, understands dissonance and\r\nmodern combinations, which he uses with fascinating charm. His violin\r\nsonata and _Nature Pieces_ for piano show his depth of feeling, his\r\n_Kaleidescopes_ (12 children’s pieces) show his humor, love of the\r\ngrotesque, and _Four Conceits_, his power to be musically sarcastic. His\r\n_Five Impressions of a Holiday_ and _Two Sketches for String Quartet_\r\nare so delightful that modern music would have lost much without them.\r\nHe is a gifted conductor and has directed concerts in London, in\r\nRochester, New York, and is engaged as guest conductor of the New York\r\nSymphony in 1925–26.\r\n\r\nArthur Bliss (1891) like Stravinsky, whom he admires, is the _enfant\r\nterrible_ of English music and is not held down by any rule or fixed\r\nstandards except that of good taste. He uses instruments in daring ways,\r\nand shows a natural knowledge of them. One of his pieces is for an\r\nunaccompanied _Cor Anglais_ (_English horn_). Among his pieces are _The\r\nCommittee_, _In the Tube (Subway) at Oxford Circus_, _At the Ball_. He\r\nwrote a _Color Symphony_, so-called because when composing it, he\r\nexperienced a play of color sensation, although he did not write it to\r\nbe used with the color organ, as does Scriabin in _Prometheus_. He is a\r\nmost daring experimenter, and altogether an interesting young musician.\r\nIn _Rout_, a gay piece for voice and chamber orchestra, he used\r\nmeaningless syllables in place of words. He spent several years in Los\r\nAngeles, but has returned to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AMERICA\r\n\r\nIn America we not only hear the works of all the people of whom we have\r\nspoken in this chapter, but among our composers are a few who show\r\nmarked twentieth century ways of composing. Some of them are American\r\nborn, some have adopted the country, but all are working for the\r\nadvancement of American music: Loeffler, our first impressionist, Bloch,\r\nCarpenter, Gruenberg, Whithorne, Morris, Jacobi, Marion Bauer, Eichheim,\r\nCarl Engel, Ornstein, Varese, Salzedo, Ruggles, Cowell, Antheil, and\r\nCopland.\r\n\r\nSeveral organizations have worked for the cause of modern music by\r\npresenting concerts devoted to works by contemporary Europeans and\r\nAmericans. The _Pro Musica_ Society has been responsible for the visits\r\nto this country of Maurice Ravel, Bela Bartok, Darius Milhaud, Alexandre\r\nTansman and Arthur Honegger.\r\n\r\nThe _League of Composers_ (founded 1923) has had many notable “first\r\nperformances” of compositions by Schoenberg, Bloch, Bartok, Stravinsky,\r\nGruenberg, Malipiero, Hindemith, Copland, de Falla, Whithorne, Carrillo,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OUR GOOD-BYE\r\n\r\nThis book has been longer than it should have been, yet our sins have\r\nbeen of omission rather than commission. But if we have only made you\r\nrealize that the world cannot stand still, that music is always growing\r\nwhether we understand it or not, and the good is handed on to the next\r\ngeneration even though much “falls by the wayside,” we will not have\r\nwritten in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SOME OF THE BOOKS WE CONSULTED\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Afro-American Folk Music_, H.
