I am well aware that the path of the biographer is\r\nbeset with pitfalls, and that, for him, _suppressio veri_ is\r\nalmost necessarily _suggestio falsi_--the least omission may\r\ndistort the whole picture.\r\n\r\nTo write the life of Lewis Carroll as it should be written\r\nwould tax the powers of a man of far greater experience and\r\ninsight than I have any pretension to possess, and even he would\r\nprobably fail to represent adequately such a complex personality.\r\nAt least I have done my best to justify their choice, and if in\r\nany way I have wronged my uncle's memory, unintentionally, I\r\ntrust that my readers will pardon me.\r\n\r\nMy task has been a delightful one. Intimately as I thought I\r\nknew Mr. Dodgson during his life, I seem since his death to have\r\nbecome still better acquainted with him. If this Memoir helps\r\nothers of his admirers to a fuller knowledge of a man whom to\r\nknow was to love, I shall not have written in vain.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of thanking those who have so kindly\r\nassisted me in my work, and first I must mention my old\r\nschoolmaster, the Rev. Watson Hagger, M.A., to whom my readers\r\nare indebted for the portions of this book dealing with Mr.\r\nDodgson's mathematical works. I am greatly indebted to Mr.\r\nDodgson's relatives, and to all those kind friends of his and\r\nothers who have aided me, in so many ways, in my difficult task.\r\nIn particular, I may mention the names of H.R.H. the Duchess of\r\nAlbany; Miss Dora Abdy; Mrs. Egerton Allen; Rev. F. H. Atkinson;\r\nSir G. Baden-Powell, M.P.; Mr. A. Ball; Rev. T. Vere Bayne; Mrs.\r\nBennie; Miss Blakemore; the Misses Bowman; Mrs. Boyes; Mrs.\r\nBremer; Mrs. Brine; Miss Mary Brown; Mrs. Calverley; Miss\r\nGertrude Chataway; Mrs. Chester; Mr. J. C. Cropper; Mr. Robert\r\nDavies; Miss Decima Dodgson; the Misses Dymes; Mrs. Eschwege;\r\nMrs. Fuller; Mr. Harry Furniss; Rev. C. A. Goodhart; Mrs.\r\nHargreaves; Miss Rose Harrison; Mr. Henry Holiday; Rev. H.\r\nHopley; Miss Florence Jackson; Rev. A. Kingston; Mrs. Kitchin;\r\nMrs. Freiligrath Kroeker; Mr. F. Madan; Mrs. Maitland; Miss M. E.\r\nManners; Miss Adelaide Paine; Mrs. Porter; Miss Edith Rix; Rev.\r\nC. J. Robinson, D.D.; Mr. S. Rogers; Mrs. Round; Miss Isabel\r\nStanden; Mr. L. Sergeant; Miss Gaynor Simpson; Mrs. Southwall;\r\nSir John Tenniel; Miss E. Gertrude Thomson; Mrs. Woodhouse; and\r\nMrs. Wyper.\r\n\r\nFor their help in the work of compiling the Bibliographical\r\nchapter and some other parts of the book, my thanks are due to\r\nMr. E. Baxter, Oxford; the Controller of the University Press,\r\nOxford; Mr. A. J. Lawrence, Rugby; Messrs. Macmillan and Co.,\r\nLondon; Mr. James Parker, Oxford; and Messrs. Ward, Lock and Co.,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIn the extracts which I have given from Mr. Dodgson's Journal\r\nand Correspondence it will be noticed that Italics have been\r\nsomewhat freely employed to represent the words which he\r\nunderlined. The use of Italics was so marked a feature of his\r\nliterary style, as any one who has read his books must have\r\nobserved, that without their aid the rhetorical effect, which he\r\nalways strove to produce, would have been seriously marred.\r\n\r\nS.

Christopher\r\nDodgson held a living in Yorkshire. His son, Charles, also took Holy\r\nOrders, and was for some time tutor to a son of the then Duke of\r\nNorthumberland. In 1762 his patron presented him to the living of\r\nElsdon, in Northumberland, by no means a desirable cure, as Mr.\r\nDodgson discovered. The following extracts from his letters to various\r\nmembers of the Percy family are interesting as giving some idea of the\r\nlife of a rural clergyman a hundred years ago:\r\n\r\n    I am obliged to you for promising to write to me, but don't\r\n    give yourself the trouble of writing to this place, for 'tis\r\n    almost impossible to receive 'em, without sending a\r\n    messenger 16 miles to fetch 'em.\r\n\r\n    'Tis impossible to describe the oddity of my situation at\r\n    present, which, however, is not void of some pleasant\r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\n    A clogmaker combs out my wig upon my curate's head, by way\r\n    of a block, and his wife powders it with a dredging-box.\r\n\r\n    The vestibule of the castle (used as a temporary parsonage)\r\n    is a low stable; above it the kitchen, in which are two\r\n    little beds joining to each other. The curate and his wife\r\n    lay in one, and Margery the maid in the other. I lay in the\r\n    parlour between two beds to keep me from being frozen to\r\n    death, for as we keep open house the winds enter from every\r\n    quarter, and are apt to sweep into bed to me.\r\n\r\n    Elsdon was once a market town as some say, and a city\r\n    according to others; but as the annals of the parish were\r\n    lost several centuries ago, it is impossible to determine\r\n    what age it was either the one or the other.\r\n\r\n    There are not the least traces of the former grandeur to be\r\n    found, whence some antiquaries are apt to believe that it\r\n    lost both its trade and charter at the Deluge.\r\n\r\n     ... There is a very good understanding between the parties\r\n    [he is speaking of the Churchmen and Presbyterians who lived\r\n    in the parish], for they not only intermarry with one\r\n    another, but frequently do penance together in a white\r\n    sheet, with a white wand, barefoot, and in the coldest\r\n    season of the year. I have not finished the description for\r\n    fear of bringing on a fit of the ague. Indeed, the ideas of\r\n    sensation are sufficient to starve a man to death, without\r\n    having recourse to those of reflection.\r\n\r\n    If I was not assured by the best authority on earth that the\r\n    world is to be destroyed by fire, I should conclude that the\r\n    day of destruction is at hand, but brought on by means of an\r\n    agent very opposite to that of heat.\r\n\r\n    I have lost the use of everything but my reason, though my\r\n    head is entrenched in three night-caps, and my throat, which\r\n    is very bad, is fortified by a pair of stockings twisted in\r\n    the form of a cravat.\r\n\r\n    As washing is very cheap, I wear _two_ shirts at a\r\n    time, and, for want of a wardrobe, I hang my great coat upon\r\n    my own back, and generally keep on my boots in imitation of\r\n    my namesake of Sweden. Indeed, since the snow became two\r\n    feet deep (as I wanted a 'chaappin of Yale' from the\r\n    public-house), I made an offer of them to Margery the maid,\r\n    but her legs are too thick to make use of them, and I am\r\n    told that the greater part of my parishioners are not less\r\n    substantial, and notwithstanding this they are remarkable\r\n    for agility.\r\n\r\n In course of time this Mr. Dodgson became Bishop of Ossory and Ferns,\r\nand he was subsequently translated to the see of Elphin. He was warmly\r\ncongratulated on this change in his fortunes by George III., who said\r\nthat he ought indeed to be thankful to have got away from a palace\r\nwhere the stabling was so bad.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had four children, the eldest of whom, Elizabeth Anne,\r\nmarried Charles Lutwidge, of Holmrook, in Cumberland. Two of the\r\nothers died almost before they had attained manhood. Charles, the\r\neldest son, entered the army, and rose to the rank of captain in the\r\n4th Dragoon Guards. He met with a sad fate while serving his king and\r\ncountry in Ireland. One of the Irish rebels who were supposed to have\r\nbeen concerned in the murder of Lord Kilwarden offered to give himself\r\nup to justice if Captain Dodgson would come alone and at night to take\r\nhim. Though he fully realised the risk, the brave captain decided to\r\ntrust himself to the honour of this outlaw, as he felt that no chance\r\nshould be missed of effecting so important a capture. Having first\r\nwritten a letter of farewell to his wife, he set out on the night of\r\nDecember 16, 1803, accompanied by a few troopers, for the\r\nmeeting-place--an old hut that stood a mile or so from Phillipstown,\r\nin King's County. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, he\r\nleft his men a few hundred yards from the hut to await his return, and\r\nadvanced alone through the night. A cowardly shot from one of the\r\nwindows of the cottage ended his noble life, and alarmed the troopers,\r\nwho, coming up in haste, were confronted with the dead body of their\r\nleader. The story is told that on the same night his wife heard two\r\nshots fired, and made inquiry about it, but could find out nothing.\r\nShortly afterwards the news came that her husband had been killed just\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dodgson left two sons behind him--Hassard, who, after a\r\nbrilliant career as a special pleader, became a Master of the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas, and Charles, the father of the subject of this Memoir.\r\n\r\nCharles, who was the elder of the two, was born in the year 1800, at\r\nHamilton, in Lanarkshire. He adopted the clerical profession, in which\r\nhe rose to high honours. He was a distinguished scholar, and took a\r\ndouble first at Christ Church, Oxford. Although in after life\r\nmathematics were his favourite pursuit, yet the fact that he\r\ntranslated Tertullian for the \"Library of the Fathers\" is sufficient\r\nevidence that he made good use of his classical education. In the\r\ncontroversy about Baptismal Regeneration he took a prominent part,\r\nsiding on the question with the Tractarians, though his views on some\r\nother points of Church doctrine were less advanced than those of the\r\nleaders of the Oxford movement. He was a man of deep piety and of a\r\nsomewhat reserved and grave disposition, which, however, was tempered\r\nby the most generous charity, so that he was universally loved by the\r\npoor. In moments of relaxation his wit and humour were the delight of\r\nhis clerical friends, for he had the rare power of telling anecdotes\r\neffectively. His reverence for sacred things was so great that he was\r\nnever known to relate a story which included a jest upon words from\r\nthe Bible.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 he married his cousin, Frances Jane Lutwidge, by whom he had\r\neleven children, all of whom, except Lewis Carroll, survive. His wife,\r\nin the words of one who had the best possible opportunities for\r\nobserving her character, was \"one of the sweetest and gentlest women\r\nthat ever lived, whom to know was to love. The earnestness of her\r\nsimple faith and love shone forth in all she did and said; she seemed\r\nto live always in the conscious presence of God. It has been said by\r\nher children that they never in all their lives remember to have heard\r\nan impatient or harsh word from her lips.\" It is easy to trace in\r\nLewis Carroll's character the influence of that most gentle of\r\nmothers; though dead she still speaks to us in some of the most\r\nbeautiful and touching passages of his works. Not so long ago I had a\r\nconversation with an old friend of his; one of the first things she\r\nsaid to me was, \"Tell me about his mother.\" I complied with her\r\nrequest as well as I was able, and, when I had finished my account of\r\nMrs. Dodgson's beautiful character, she said, \"Ah, I knew it must have\r\nbeen so; I felt sure he must have had a good mother.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 1832, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was born at Daresbury,\r\nof which parish his father was then incumbent. The village of\r\nDaresbury is about seven miles from Warrington; its name is supposed\r\nto be derived from a word meaning oak, and certainly oaks are very\r\nplentiful in the neighbourhood. A canal passes through an outlying\r\npart of the parish. The bargemen who frequented this canal were a\r\nspecial object of Mr. Dodgson's pastoral care. Once, when walking with\r\nLord Francis Egerton, who was a large landowner in the district, he\r\nspoke of his desire to provide some sort of religious privileges for\r\nthem. \"If I only had £100,\" he said, \"I would turn one of those barges\r\ninto a chapel,\" and, at his companion's request, he described exactly\r\nhow he would have the chapel constructed and furnished. A few weeks\r\nlater he received a letter from Lord Francis to tell him that his wish\r\nwas fulfilled, and that the chapel was ready. In this strange church,\r\nwhich is believed to have been the first of its kind, Mr. Dodgson\r\nconducted service and preached every Sunday evening!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Daresbury Parsonage]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parsonage is situated a mile and a half from the village, on the\r\nglebe-farm, having been erected by a former incumbent, who, it was\r\nsaid, cared more for the glebe than the parish. Here it was that\r\nCharles spent the first eleven years of his life--years of complete\r\nseclusion from the world, for even the passing of a cart was a matter\r\nof great interest to the children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lewis Carroll, aged 8.]\r\n\r\nIn this quiet home the boy invented the strangest diversions for\r\nhimself; he made pets of the most odd and unlikely animals, and\r\nnumbered certain snails and toads among his intimate friends. He tried\r\nalso to encourage civilised warfare among earthworms, by supplying\r\nthem with small pieces of pipe, with which they might fight if so\r\ndisposed. His notions of charity at this early age were somewhat\r\nrudimentary; he used to peel rushes with the idea that the pith would\r\nafterwards \"be given to the poor,\" though what possible use they could\r\nput it to he never attempted to explain. Indeed he seems at this time\r\nto have actually lived in that charming \"Wonderland\" which he\r\nafterwards described so vividly; but for all that he was a thorough\r\nboy, and loved to climb the trees and to scramble about in the old\r\nmarl-pits.\r\n\r\nOne of the few breaks in this very uneventful life was a holiday spent\r\nwith the other members of his family in Beaumaris. The journey took\r\nthree days each way, for railroads were then almost unknown; and\r\nwhatever advantages coaching may have had over travelling in trains,\r\nspeed was certainly not one of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson from the first used to take an active part in his son's\r\neducation, and the following anecdote will show that he had at least a\r\npupil who was anxious to learn. One day, when Charles was a very small\r\nboy, he came up to his father and showed him a book of logarithms,\r\nwith the request, \"Please explain.\" Mr. Dodgson told him that he was\r\nmuch too young to understand anything about such a difficult subject.\r\nThe child listened to what his father said, and appeared to think it\r\nirrelevant, for he still insisted, \"_But_, please, explain!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Dodgson]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Mr. and Mrs. Dodgson went to Hull, to pay a visit to\r\nthe latter's father, who had been seriously ill. From Hull Mrs.\r\nDodgson wrote to Charles, and he set much store by this letter, which\r\nwas probably one of the first he had received. He was afraid that some\r\nof his little sisters would mess it, or tear it up, so he wrote upon\r\nthe back, \"No one is to touch this note, for it belongs to C. L. D.\";\r\nbut, this warning appearing insufficient, he added, \"Covered with\r\nslimy pitch, so that they will wet their fingers.\" The precious letter\r\nran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    My dearest Charlie, I have used you rather ill in not having\r\n    written to you sooner, but I know you will forgive me, as\r\n    your Grandpapa has liked to have me with him so much, and I\r\n    could not write and talk to him comfortably. All your notes\r\n    have delighted me, my precious children, and show me that\r\n    you have not quite forgotten me. I am always thinking of\r\n    you, and longing to have you all round me again more than\r\n    words can tell. God grant that we may find you all well and\r\n    happy on Friday evening. I am happy to say your dearest Papa\r\n    is quite well--his cough is rather _tickling_, but is\r\n    of no consequence. It delights me, my darling Charlie, to\r\n    hear that you are getting on so well with your Latin, and\r\n    that you make so few mistakes in your Exercises. You will be\r\n    happy to hear that your dearest Grandpapa is going on\r\n    nicely--indeed I hope he will soon be quite well again. He\r\n    talks a great deal and most kindly about you all. I hope my\r\n    sweetest Will says \"Mama\" sometimes, and that precious Tish\r\n    has not forgotten. Give them and all my other treasures,\r\n    including yourself, 1,000,000,000 kisses from me, with my\r\n    most affectionate love. I am sending you a shabby note, but\r\n    I cannot help it. Give my kindest love to Aunt Dar, and\r\n    believe me, my own dearest Charlie, to be your sincerely\r\n    affectionate\r\n\r\n    Mama.\r\n\r\nAmong the few visitors who disturbed the repose of Daresbury Parsonage\r\nwas Mr. Durnford, afterwards Bishop of Chichester, with whom Mr.\r\nDodgson had formed a close friendship. Another was Mr. Bayne, at that\r\ntime head-master of Warrington Grammar School, who used occasionally\r\nto assist in the services at Daresbury. His son, Vere, was Charles's\r\nplayfellow; he is now a student of Christ Church, and the friendship\r\nbetween him and Lewis Carroll lasted without interruption till the\r\ndeath of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe memory of his birthplace did not soon fade from Charles's mind;\r\nlong afterwards he retained pleasant recollections of its rustic\r\nbeauty. For instance, his poem of \"The Three Sunsets,\" which first\r\nappeared in 1860 in _All the Year Round,_ begins with the\r\nfollowing stanzas, which have been slightly altered in later\r\neditions:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        I watch the drowsy night expire,\r\n        And Fancy paints at my desire\r\n        Her magic pictures in the fire.\r\n\r\n        An island farm, 'mid seas of corn,\r\n        Swayed by the wandering breath of morn,\r\n        The happy spot where I was born.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough nearly all Mr. Dodgson's parishioners at Daresbury have passed\r\naway, yet there are still some few left who speak with loving\r\nreverence of him whose lips, now long silenced, used to speak so\r\nkindly to them; whose hands, long folded in sleep, were once so ready\r\nto alleviate their wants and sorrows.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Sir Robert Peel presented him to the Crown living of Croft, a\r\nYorkshire village about three miles south of Darlington. This\r\npreferment made a great change in the life of the family; it opened\r\nfor them many more social opportunities, and put an end to that life\r\nof seclusion which, however beneficial it may be for a short time, is\r\napt, if continued too long, to have a cramping and narrowing\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe river Tees is at Croft the dividing line between Yorkshire and\r\nDurham, and on the middle of the bridge which there crosses it is a\r\nstone which shows where the one county ends and the other begins.\r\n\"Certain lands are held in this place,\" says Lewis in his\r\n\"Topographical Dictionary,\" \"by the owner presenting on the bridge, at\r\nthe coming of every new Bishop of Durham, an old sword, pronouncing a\r\nlegendary address, and delivering the sword to the Bishop, who returns\r\nit immediately.\" The Tees is subject to extraordinary floods, and\r\nthough Croft Church stands many feet above the ordinary level of the\r\nriver, and is separated from it by the churchyard and a field, yet on\r\none occasion the church itself was flooded, as was attested by\r\nwater-marks on the old woodwork several feet from the floor, still to\r\nbe seen when Mr. Dodgson was incumbent.\r\n\r\nThis church, which is dedicated to St. Peter, is a quaint old building\r\nwith a Norman porch, the rest of it being of more modern construction.\r\nIt contains a raised pew, which is approached by a winding flight of\r\nstairs, and is covered in, so that it resembles nothing so much as a\r\nfour-post bedstead. This pew used to belong to the Milbanke family,\r\nwith which Lord Byron was connected. Mr. Dodgson found the\r\nchancel-roof in so bad a state of repair that he was obliged to take\r\nit down, and replace it by an entirely new one. The only village\r\nschool that existed when he came to the place was a sort of barn,\r\nwhich stood in a corner of the churchyard. During his incumbency a\r\nfine school-house was erected. Several members of his family used\r\nregularly to help in teaching the children, and excellent reports were\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe Rectory is close to the church, and stands in the middle of a\r\nbeautiful garden. The former incumbent had been an enthusiastic\r\nhorticulturist, and the walls of the kitchen garden were covered with\r\nluxuriant fruit-trees, while the greenhouses were well stocked with\r\nrare and beautiful exotics. Among these was a specimen of that\r\nfantastic cactus, the night-blowing Cereus, whose flowers, after an\r\nexistence of but a few hours, fade with the waning sun. On the day\r\nwhen this occurred large numbers of people used to obtain Mr.\r\nDodgson's leave to see the curiosity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Croft Rectory]\r\n\r\nNear the Rectory is a fine hotel, built when Croft was an important\r\nposting-station for the coaches between London and Edinburgh, but in\r\nMr. Dodgson's time chiefly used by gentlemen who stayed there during\r\nthe hunting season. The village is renowned for its baths and\r\nmedicinal waters. The parish of Croft includes the outlying hamlets of\r\nHalnaby, Dalton, and Stapleton, so that the Rector's position is by no\r\nmeans a sinecure. Within the village is Croft Hall, the old seat of\r\nthe Chaytors; but during Mr. Dodgson's incumbency the then Sir William\r\nChaytor built and lived at Clervaux Castle, calling it by an old\r\nfamily name.\r\n\r\nShortly after accepting the living of Croft, Mr. Dodgson was appointed\r\nexamining chaplain to the Bishop of Ripon; subsequently he was made\r\nArchdeacon of Richmond and one of the Canons of Ripon Cathedral.\r\n\r\nCharles was at this time very fond of inventing games for the\r\namusement of his brothers and sisters; he constructed a rude train out\r\nof a wheelbarrow, a barrel and a small truck, which used to convey\r\npassengers from one \"station\" in the Rectory garden to another. At\r\neach of these stations there was a refreshment-room, and the\r\npassengers had to purchase tickets from him before they could enjoy\r\ntheir ride. The boy was also a clever conjuror, and, arrayed in a\r\nbrown wig and a long white robe, used to cause no little wonder to his\r\naudience by his sleight-of-hand. With the assistance of various\r\nmembers of the family and the village carpenter, he made a troupe of\r\nmarionettes and a small theatre for them to act in. He wrote all the\r\nplays himself the most popular being \"The Tragedy of King John\"--and\r\nhe was very clever at manipulating the innumerable strings by which\r\nthe movements of his puppets were regulated. One winter, when the snow\r\nlay thick upon the lawn, he traced upon it a maze of such hopeless\r\nintricacy as almost to put its famous rival at Hampton Court in the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toy Station in garden at Croft.]\r\n\r\nWhen he was twelve years old his father sent him to school at\r\nRichmond, under Mr. Tate, a worthy son of that well-known Dr. Tate who\r\nhad made Richmond School so famous.\r\n\r\nI am able to give his earliest impressions of school-life in his own\r\nwords, for one of his first letters home has been fortunately\r\npreserved. It is dated August 5th, and is addressed to his two eldest\r\nsisters. A boy who has _ten_ brothers and sisters can scarcely be\r\nexpected to write separate letters to each of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Fanny and Memy,--I hope you are all getting on well,\r\n    as also the sweet twins, the boys I think that I like the\r\n    best, are Harry Austin, and all the Tates of which there are\r\n    7 besides a little girl who came down to dinner the first\r\n    day, but not since, and I also like Edmund Tremlet, and\r\n    William and Edward Swire, Tremlet is a sharp little fellow\r\n    about 7 years old, the youngest in the school, I also like\r\n    Kemp and Mawley. The rest of the boys that I know are\r\n    Bertram, Harry and Dick Wilson, and two Robinsons, I will\r\n    tell you all about them when I return. The boys have played\r\n    two tricks upon me which were these--they first proposed to\r\n    play at \"King of the Cobblers\" and asked if I would be king,\r\n    to which I agreed. Then they made me sit down and sat (on\r\n    the ground) in a circle round me, and told me to say \"Go to\r\n    work\" which I said, and they immediately began kicking me\r\n    and knocking me on all sides. The next game they proposed\r\n    was \"Peter, the red lion,\" and they made a mark on a\r\n    tombstone (for we were playing in the churchyard) and one of\r\n    the boys walked with his eyes shut, holding out his finger,\r\n    trying to touch the mark; then a little boy came forward to\r\n    lead the rest and led a good many very near the mark; at\r\n    last it was my turn; they told me to shut my eyes well, and\r\n    the next minute I had my finger in the mouth of one of the\r\n    boys, who had stood (I believe) before the tombstone with\r\n    his mouth open. For 2 nights I slept alone, and for the rest\r\n    of the time with Ned Swire. The boys play me no tricks now.\r\n    The only fault (tell Mama) that there has been was coming in\r\n    one day to dinner just after grace. On Sunday we went to\r\n    church in the morning, and sat in a large pew with Mr.\r\n    Fielding, the church we went to is close by Mr. Tate's\r\n    house, we did not go in the afternoon but Mr. Tate read a\r\n    discourse to the boys on the 5th commandment. We went to\r\n    church again in the evening. Papa wished me to tell him all\r\n    the texts I had heard preached upon, please to tell him that\r\n    I could not hear it in the morning nor hardly one sentence\r\n    of the sermon, but the one in the evening was I Cor. i. 23.\r\n    I believe it was a farewell sermon, but I am not sure. Mrs.\r\n    Tate has looked through my clothes and left in the trunk a\r\n    great many that will not be wanted. I have had 3 misfortunes\r\n    in my clothes etc. 1st, I cannot find my tooth-brush, so\r\n    that I have not brushed my teeth for 3 or 4 days, 2nd, I\r\n    cannot find my blotting paper, and 3rd, I have no shoe-horn.\r\n    The chief games are, football, wrestling, leap frog, and\r\n    fighting. Excuse bad writing.\r\n\r\n    Yr affec' brother Charles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To_ SKEFF [_a younger brother, aged six_].\r\n\r\n    My dear Skeff,--Roar not lest thou be abolished. Yours,\r\n    etc.,--.\r\n\r\nThe discomforts which he, as a \"new boy,\" had to put up with from his\r\nschool-mates affected him as they do not, unfortunately, affect most\r\nboys, for in later school days he was famous as a champion of the weak\r\nand small, while every bully had good reason to fear him. Though it is\r\nhard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don\r\nto believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school\r\nhis name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his\r\nfists in defence of a righteous cause.\r\n\r\nAs was the custom at that time, Charles began to compose Latin verses\r\nat a very early age, his first copy being dated November 25, 1844. The\r\nsubject was evening, and this is how he treated it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Phoebus aqua splendet descendens, æquora tingens\r\n           Splendore aurato. Pervenit umbra solo.\r\n        Mortales lectos quærunt, et membra relaxant\r\n           Fessa labore dies; cuncta per orbe silet.\r\n        Imperium placidum nunc sumit Phoebe corusca.\r\n           Antris procedunt sanguine ore feræ.\r\n\r\nThese lines the boy solemnly copied into his Diary, apparently in the\r\nmost blissful ignorance of the numerous mistakes they contained.\r\n\r\nThe next year he wrote a story which appeared in the school magazine.\r\nIt was called \"The Unknown One,\" so it was probably of the sensational\r\ntype in which small boys usually revel.\r\n\r\nThough Richmond School, as it was in 1844, may not compare favourably\r\nin every respect with a modern preparatory school, where supervision\r\nhas been so far \"reduced to the absurd\" that the unfortunate masters\r\nhardly get a minute to themselves from sunrise till long after sunset,\r\nyet no better or wiser men than those of the school of Mr. Tate are\r\nnow to be found. Nor, I venture to think, are the results of the\r\nmodern system more successful than those of the old one. Charles loved\r\nhis \"kind old schoolmaster,\" as he affectionately calls him, and\r\nsurely to gain the love of the boys is the main battle in\r\nschool-management.\r\n\r\nThe impression he made upon his instructors may be gathered from the\r\nfollowing extracts from Mr. Tate's first report upon him:\r\n\r\n    Sufficient opportunities having been allowed me to draw from\r\n    actual observation an estimate of your son's character and\r\n    abilities, I do not hesitate to express my opinion that he\r\n    possesses, along with other and excellent natural\r\n    endowments, a very uncommon share of genius. Gentle and\r\n    cheerful in his intercourse with others, playful and ready\r\n    in conversation, he is capable of acquirements and knowledge\r\n    far beyond his years, while his reason is so clear and so\r\n    jealous of error, that he will not rest satisfied without a\r\n    most exact solution of whatever appears to him obscure. He\r\n    has passed an excellent examination just now in mathematics,\r\n    exhibiting at times an illustration of that love of precise\r\n    argument, which seems to him natural.\r\n\r\n    I must not omit to set off against these great advantages\r\n    one or two faults, of which the removal as soon as possible\r\n    is desirable, tho' I am prepared to find it a work of time.\r\n    As you are well aware, our young friend, while jealous of\r\n    error, as I said above, where important faith or principles\r\n    are concerned, is exceedingly lenient towards lesser\r\n    frailties--and, whether in reading aloud or metrical\r\n    composition, frequently sets at nought the notions of Virgil\r\n    or Ovid as to syllabic quantity. He is moreover marvellously\r\n    ingenious in replacing the ordinary inflexions of nouns and\r\n    verbs, as detailed in our grammars, by more exact analogies,\r\n    or convenient forms of his own devising. This source of\r\n    fault will in due time exhaust itself, though flowing freely\r\n    at present.... You may fairly anticipate for him a bright\r\n    career. Allow me, before I close, one suggestion which\r\n    assumes for itself the wisdom of experience and the\r\n    sincerity of the best intention. You must not entrust your\r\n    son with a full knowledge of his superiority over other\r\n    boys. Let him discover this as he proceeds. The love of\r\n    excellence is far beyond the love of excelling; and if he\r\n    should once be bewitched into a mere ambition to surpass\r\n    others I need not urge that the very quality of his\r\n    knowledge would be materially injured, and that his\r\n    character would receive a stain of a more serious\r\n    description still....\r\n\r\nAnd again, when Charles was leaving Richmond, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Be assured that I shall always feel a peculiar interest in\r\n    the gentle, intelligent, and well-conducted boy who is now\r\n    leaving us.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough his father had been a Westminster boy, Charles was, for some\r\nreason or other, sent to Rugby. The great Arnold, who had, one might\r\nalmost say, created Rugby School, and who certainly had done more for\r\nit than all his predecessors put together, had gone to his rest, and\r\nfor four years the reins of government had been in the firm hands of\r\nDr. Tait, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. He was Headmaster\r\nduring the whole of the time Charles was at Rugby, except the last\r\nyear, during which Dr. Goulburn held that office. Charles went up in\r\nFebruary, 1846, and he must have found his new life a great change\r\nfrom his quiet experiences at Richmond. Football was in full swing,\r\nand one can imagine that to a new boy \"Big-side\" was not an unalloyed\r\ndelight. Whether he distinguished himself as a \"dropper,\" or ever beat\r\nthe record time in the \"Crick\" run, I do not know. Probably not; his\r\nabilities did not lie much in the field of athletics. But he got on\r\ncapitally with his work, and seldom returned home without one or more\r\nprizes. Moreover, he conducted himself so well that he never had to\r\nenter that dreaded chamber, well known to _some_ Rugbeians, which\r\nis approached by a staircase that winds up a little turret, and\r\nwherein are enacted scenes better imagined than described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Archbishop Tait. _From a photograph by\r\nMessrs. Elliott and Fry_]\r\n\r\nA schoolboy's letter home is not, usually, remarkable for the\r\nintelligence displayed in it; as a rule it merely leads up with more\r\nor less ingenuity to the inevitable request for money contained in the\r\npostscript. Some of Charles's letters were of a different sort, as the\r\nfollowing example shows:\r\n\r\n    Yesterday evening I was walking out with a friend of mine\r\n    who attends as mathematical pupil Mr. Smythies the second\r\n    mathematical master; we went up to Mr. Smythies' house, as\r\n    he wanted to speak to him, and he asked us to stop and have\r\n    a glass of wine and some figs. He seems as devoted to his\r\n    duty as Mr. Mayor, and asked me with a smile of delight,\r\n    \"Well Dodgson I suppose you're getting well on with your\r\n    mathematics?\" He is very clever at them, though not equal to\r\n    Mr. Mayor, as indeed few men are, Papa excepted.... I have\r\n    read the first number of Dickens' new tale, \"Davy\r\n    Copperfield.\" It purports to be his life, and begins with\r\n    his birth and childhood; it seems a poor plot, but some of\r\n    the characters and scenes are good. One of the persons that\r\n    amused me was a Mrs. Gummidge, a wretched melancholy person,\r\n    who is always crying, happen what will, and whenever the\r\n    fire smokes, or other trifling accident occurs, makes the\r\n    remark with great bitterness, and many tears, that she is a\r\n    \"lone lorn creetur, and everything goes contrairy with her.\"\r\n    I have not yet been able to get the second volume Macaulay's\r\n    \"England\" to read. I have seen it however and one passage\r\n    struck me when seven bishops had signed the invitation to\r\n    the pretender, and King James sent for Bishop Compton (who\r\n    was one of the seven) and asked him \"whether he or any of\r\n    his ecclesiastical brethren had anything to do with it?\" He\r\n    replied, after a moment's thought \"I am fully persuaded your\r\n    majesty, that there is not one of my brethren who is not as\r\n    innocent in the matter as myself.\" This was certainly no\r\n    actual lie, but certainly, as Macaulay says, it was very\r\n    little different from one.\r\n\r\nThe Mr. Mayor who is mentioned in this letter formed a very high\r\nopinion of his pupil's ability, for in 1848 he wrote to Archdeacon\r\nDodgson: \"I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came\r\nto Rugby.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Tait speaks no less warmly:--\r\n\r\n     My dear Sir,--I must not allow your son to leave school\r\n    without expressing to you the very high opinion I entertain\r\n    of him. I fully coincide in Mr. Cotton's estimate both of\r\n    his abilities and upright conduct. His mathematical\r\n    knowledge is great for his age, and I doubt not he will do\r\n    himself credit in classics. As I believe I mentioned to you\r\n    before, his examination for the Divinity prize was one of\r\n    the most creditable exhibitions I have ever seen.\r\n\r\n    During the whole time of his being in my house, his conduct\r\n    has been excellent.\r\n\r\n    Believe me to be, My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\n    A.C. TAIT.\r\n\r\nPublic school life then was not what it is now; the atrocious system\r\nthen in vogue of setting hundreds of lines for the most trifling\r\noffences made every day a weariness and a hopeless waste of time,\r\nwhile the bad discipline which was maintained in the dormitories made\r\neven the nights intolerable--especially for the small boys, whose beds\r\nin winter were denuded of blankets that the bigger ones might not feel\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nCharles kept no diary during his time at Rugby; but, looking back upon\r\nit, he writes in 1855:--\r\n\r\n    During my stay I made I suppose some progress in learning of\r\n    various kinds, but none of it was done _con amore_, and\r\n    I spent an incalculable time in writing out\r\n    impositions--this last I consider one of the chief faults of\r\n    Rugby School. I made some friends there, the most intimate\r\n    being Henry Leigh Bennett (as college acquaintances we find\r\n    fewer common sympathies, and are consequently less\r\n    intimate)--but I cannot say that I look back upon my life at\r\n    a Public School with any sensations of pleasure, or that any\r\n    earthly considerations would induce me to go through my\r\n    three years again.\r\n\r\nWhen, some years afterwards, he visited Radley School, he was much\r\nstruck by the cubicle system which prevails in the dormitories there,\r\nand wrote in his Diary, \"I can say that if I had been thus secure from\r\nannoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been\r\ncomparative trifles to bear.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture on page 32 was, I believe, drawn by Charles rile he was\r\nat Rugby in illustration of a letter received from one of his sisters.\r\nHalnaby, as I have said before, was an outlying district of Croft\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nDuring his holidays he used to amuse himself by editing local\r\nmagazines. Indeed, they might be called _very local_ magazines,\r\nas their circulation was confined to the inmates of Croft Rectory. The\r\nfirst of these, _Useful and Instructive Poetry_, was written\r\nabout 1845. It came to an untimely end after a six months' run, and\r\nwas followed at varying intervals by several other periodicals,\r\nequally short-lived.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 or 1850, _The Rectory Umbrella_ began to appear. As the\r\neditor was by this time seventeen or eighteen years old, it was\r\nnaturally of a more ambitious character than any of its precursors. It\r\ncontained a serial story of the most thrilling interest, entitled,\r\n\"The Walking-Stick of Destiny,\" some meritorious poetry, a few\r\nhumorous essays, and several caricatures of pictures in the Vernon\r\nGallery.

Reynolds, representing a young\r\n    Hippopotamus seated under a shady tree, presents to the\r\n    contemplative mind a charming union of youth and innocence.\r\n\r\n    EDITOR.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _\"The Scanty Meal.\"_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have been unusually[001] successful in our second\r\n    engraving from the Vernon Gallery. The picture is\r\n    intended, as our readers will perceive, to illustrate the\r\n    evils of homoeopathy.[002] This idea is well carried out\r\n    through the whole picture. The thin old lady at the head of\r\n    the table is in the painter's best style; we almost fancy we\r\n    can trace in the eye of the other lady a lurking suspicion\r\n    that her glasses are not really in fault, and that the old\r\n    gentleman has helped her to _nothing_ instead of a\r\n    nonillionth.[003] Her companion has evidently got an empty\r\n    glass in his hand; the two children in front are admirably\r\n    managed, and there is a sly smile on the footman's face, as\r\n    if he thoroughly enjoyed either the bad news he is bringing\r\n    or the wrath of his mistress. The carpet is executed with\r\n    that elaborate care for which Mr. Herring is so famed, and\r\n    the picture on the whole is one of his best.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_The First Ear-ring_\"\r\n\r\n    The scene from which this excellent picture is painted\r\n    is taken from a passage in the autobiography[004] of the\r\n    celebrated Sir William Smith[005] of his life when a\r\n    schoolboy: we transcribe the passage: \"One day Bill\r\n    Tomkins[006] and I were left alone in the house, the old\r\n    doctor being out; after playing a number of pranks Bill laid\r\n    me a bet of sixpence that I wouldn't pour a bottle of ink\r\n    over the doctor's cat. _I did it_, but at that moment\r\n    old Muggles came home, and caught me by the ear as I\r\n    attempted to run away. My sensations at the moment I shall\r\n    never forget; _on that occasion I received my first\r\n    ear-ring_.[007] The only remark Bill made to me, as he\r\n    paid me the money afterwards was, 'I say, didn't you just\r\n    howl jolly!'\" The engraving is an excellent copy of the\r\n    picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir D.

We now come to a\r\nperiod of his life which is in some respects necessarily less\r\ninteresting. We all have to pass through that painful era of\r\nself-consciousness which prefaces manhood, that time when we feel so\r\ndeeply, and are so utterly unable to express to others, or even to\r\ndefine clearly to ourselves, what it is we do feel. The natural\r\nfreedom of childhood is dead within us; the conventional freedom of\r\nriper years is struggling to birth, and its efforts are sometimes\r\nludicrous to an unsympathetic observer. In Lewis Carroll's mental\r\nattitude during this critical period there was always a calm dignity\r\nwhich saved him from these absurdities, an undercurrent of\r\nconsciousness that what seemed so great to him was really very little.\r\n\r\nOn May 23, 1850, he matriculated at Christ Church, the venerable\r\ncollege which had numbered his father's among other illustrious names.\r\nA letter from Dr. Jelf, one of the canons of Christ Church, to\r\nArchdeacon Dodgson, written when the former heard that his old\r\nfriend's son was coming up to \"the House,\" contains the following\r\nwords: \"I am sure I express the common feeling of all who remember you\r\nat Christ Church when I say that we shall rejoice to see a son of\r\nyours worthy to tread in your footsteps.\"\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll came into residence on January 24, 1851. From that day\r\nto the hour of his death--a period of forty-seven years--he belonged\r\nto \"the House,\" never leaving it for any length of time, becoming\r\nalmost a part of it. I, for one, can hardly imagine it without him.\r\n\r\nThough technically \"in residence,\" he had not rooms of his own in\r\nCollege during his first term. The \"House\" was very full; and had it\r\nnot been for one of the tutors, the Rev. J. Lew, kindly lending him\r\none of his own rooms, he would have had to take lodgings in the town.\r\nThe first set of rooms he occupied was in Peckwater Quadrangle, which\r\nis annually the scene of a great bonfire on Guy Fawkes' Day, and,\r\ngenerally speaking, is not the best place for a reading man to live\r\nin.\r\n\r\nIn those days the undergraduates dining in hall were divided into\r\n\"messes.\" Each mess consisted of about half a dozen men, who had a\r\ntable to themselves. Dinner was served at five, and very indifferently\r\nserved, too; the dishes and plates were of pewter, and the joint was\r\npassed round, each man cutting off what he wanted for himself. In Mr.\r\nDodgson's mess were Philip Pusey, the late Rev. G. C. Woodhouse, and,\r\namong others, one who still lives in \"Alice in Wonderland\" as the\r\n\"Hatter.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few days after term began, Mrs. Dodgson died suddenly at Croft.\r\nThe shock was a terrible one to the whole family, and especially to\r\nher devoted husband. I have come across a delightful and most\r\ncharacteristic letter from Dr. Pusey--a letter full of the kindest and\r\ntruest sympathy with the Archdeacon in his bereavement. The part of it\r\nwhich bears upon Mrs. Dodgson's death I give in full:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grave of Archdeacon and Mrs. Dodgson in Croft\r\nChurchyard.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Friend, I hear and see so little and so few persons,\r\n    that I had not heard of your sorrow until your to-day's\r\n    letter; and now I but guess what it was: only your language\r\n    is that of the very deepest. I have often thought, since I\r\n    had to think of this, how, in all adversity, what God takes\r\n    away He may give us back with increase. One cannot think\r\n    that any holy earthly love will cease, when we shall \"be\r\n    like the Angels of God in Heaven.\" Love here must shadow our\r\n    love there, deeper because spiritual, without any alloy from\r\n    our sinful nature, and in the fulness of the love of God.\r\n    But as we grow here by God's grace will be our capacity for\r\n    endless love. So, then, if by our very sufferings we are\r\n    purified, and our hearts enlarged, we shall, in that endless\r\n    bliss, love more those whom we loved here, than if we had\r\n    never had that sorrow, never been parted....\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll was summoned home to attend the funeral--a sad interlude\r\namidst the novel experiences of a first term at College. The Oxford of\r\n1851 was in many ways quite unlike the Oxford of 1898. The position of\r\nthe undergraduates was much more similar to that of schoolboys than is\r\nnow the case; they were subject to the same penalties--corporal\r\npunishment, even, had only just gone out of vogue!--and were expected\r\nto work, and to work hard.\r\n\r\nEarly rising then was strictly enforced, as the following extract from\r\none of his letters will show:--\r\n\r\n    I am not so anxious as usual to begin my personal history,\r\n    as the first thing I have to record is a very sad incident,\r\n    namely, my missing morning chapel; before, however, you\r\n    condemn me, you must hear how accidental it was. For some\r\n    days now I have been in the habit of, I will not say getting\r\n    up, but of being called at a quarter past six, and generally\r\n    managing to be down soon after seven. In the present\r\n    instance I had been up the night before till about half-past\r\n    twelve, and consequently when I was called I fell asleep\r\n    again, and was thunderstruck to find on waking that it was\r\n    ten minutes past eight. I have had no imposition, nor heard\r\n    anything about it. It is rather vexatious to have happened\r\n    so soon, as I had intended never to be late.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lewis Carroll, aged 23.]\r\n\r\nIt was therefore obviously his custom to have his breakfast\r\n_before_ going to chapel. I wonder how many undergraduates of the\r\npresent generation follow the same hardy rule! But then no\r\n\"impositions\" threaten the modern sluggard, even if he neglects chapel\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nDuring the Long Vacation he visited the Great Exhibition, and wrote\r\nhis sister Elizabeth a long account of what he had seen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think the first impression produced on you when you get\r\n    inside is one of bewilderment. It looks like a sort of\r\n    fairyland. As far as you can look in any direction, you see\r\n    nothing but pillars hung about with shawls, carpets, &c.,\r\n    with long avenues of statues, fountains, canopies, etc.,\r\n    etc., etc. The first thing to be seen on entering is the\r\n    Crystal Fountain, a most elegant one about thirty feet high\r\n    at a rough guess, composed entirely of glass and pouring\r\n    down jets of water from basin to basin; this is in the\r\n    middle of the centre nave, and from it you can look down to\r\n    either end, and up both transepts. The centre of the nave\r\n    mostly consists of a long line of colossal statues, some\r\n    most magnificent. The one considered the finest, I believe,\r\n    is the Amazon and Tiger. She is sitting on horseback, and a\r\n    tiger has fastened on the neck of the horse in front. You\r\n    have to go to one side to see her face, and the other to see\r\n    the horse's. The horse's face is really wonderful,\r\n    expressing terror and pain so exactly, that you almost\r\n    expect to hear it scream.... There are some very ingenious\r\n    pieces of mechanism. A tree (in the French Compartment) with\r\n    birds chirping and hopping from branch to branch exactly\r\n    like life. The bird jumps across, turns round on the other\r\n    branch, so as to face back again, settles its head and neck,\r\n    and then in a few moments jumps back again. A bird standing\r\n    at the foot of the tree trying to eat a beetle is rather a\r\n    failure; it never succeeds in getting its head more than a\r\n    quarter of an inch down, and that in uncomfortable little\r\n    jerks, as if it was choking. I have to go to the Royal\r\n    Academy, so must stop: as the subject is quite inexhaustible,\r\n    there is no hope of ever coming to a regular finish.\r\n\r\nOn November 1st he won a Boulter scholarship, and at the end of the\r\nfollowing year obtained First Class Honours in Mathematics and a\r\nSecond in Classical Moderations. On Christmas Eve he was made a\r\nStudent on Dr. Pusey's nomination, for at that time the Dean and\r\nCanons nominated to Studentships by turn. The only conditions on which\r\nthese old Studentships were held were that the Student should remain\r\nunmarried, and should proceed to Holy Orders. No statute precisely\r\ndefined what work was expected of them, that question being largely\r\nleft to their own discretion.\r\n\r\nThe eight Students at the bottom of the list that is to say, the eight\r\nwho had been nominated last--had to mark, by pricking on weekly papers\r\ncalled \"the Bills,\" the attendance at morning and evening chapel. They\r\nwere allowed to arrange this duty among themselves, and, if it was\r\nneglected, they were all punished. This long-defunct custom explains\r\nan entry in Lewis Carroll's Diary for October 15, 1853, \"Found I had\r\ngot the prickbills two hundred lines apiece, by not pricking in in the\r\nmorning,\" which, I must confess, mystified me exceedingly at first.\r\nAnother reference to College impositions occurs further on in his\r\nDiary, at a time when he was a Lecturer: \"Spoke to the Dean about\r\nF--, who has brought an imposition which his tutor declares is not\r\nhis own writing, after being expressly told to write it himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from his father's letter of\r\ncongratulation, on his being nominated for the Studentship:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dearest Charles,--The feelings of thankfulness and\r\n    delight with which I have read your letter just received, I\r\n    must leave to _your conception_; for they are, I assure\r\n    you, beyond _my expression_; and your affectionate\r\n    heart will derive no small addition of joy from thinking of\r\n    the joy which you have occasioned to me, and to all the\r\n    circle of your home. I say \"_you_ have occasioned,\"\r\n    because, grateful as I am to my old friend Dr. Pusey for\r\n    what he has done, I cannot desire stronger evidence than his\r\n    own words of the fact that you have _won_, and well\r\n    won, this honour for _yourself_, and that it is\r\n    bestowed as a matter of _justice_ to _you_, and\r\n    not of _kindness_ to _me_. You will be interested\r\n    in reading extracts from his two letters to me--the first\r\n    written three years ago in answer to one from me, in which I\r\n    distinctly told him that I neither asked nor expected that\r\n    he should serve me in this matter, unless my son should\r\n    fairly reach the standard of merit by which these\r\n    appointments were regulated. In reply he says--\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for the way in which you put the application to\r\n    me. I have now, for nearly twenty years, not given a\r\n    Studentship to any friend of my own, unless there was no\r\n    very eligible person in the College. I have passed by or\r\n    declined the sons of those to whom I was personally indebted\r\n    for kindness. I can only say that I shall have _very\r\n    great_ pleasure, if circumstances permit me to nominate\r\n    your son.\"\r\n\r\n    In his letter received this morning he says--\r\n\r\n      \"I have great pleasure in telling you that I have been\r\n      enabled to recommend your son for a Studentship this\r\n      Christmas. It must be so much more satisfactory to you that\r\n      he should be nominated thus, in consequence of the\r\n      recommendation of the College. One of the Censors brought me\r\n      to-day five names; but in their minds it was plain that they\r\n      thought your son on the whole the most eligible for the\r\n      College. It has been very satisfactory to hear of your son's\r\n      uniform steady and good conduct.\"\r\n\r\n    The last clause is a parallel to your own report, and I am\r\n    glad that you should have had so soon an evidence so\r\n    substantial of the truth of what I have so often inculcated,\r\n    that it is the \"steady, painstaking, likely-to-do-good\" man,\r\n    who in the long run wins the race against those who now and\r\n    then give a brilliant flash and, as Shakespeare says,\r\n    \"straight are cold again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Archdeacon Dodgson.]\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Archdeacon Dodgson was collated and installed as one of the\r\nCanons of Ripon Cathedral. This appointment necessitated a residence\r\nof three months in every year at Ripon, where Dr. Erskine was then\r\nDean. A certain Miss Anderson, who used to stay at the Deanery, had\r\nvery remarkable \"clairvoyant\" powers; she was able--it was averred--by\r\nmerely holding in her hand a folded paper containing some words\r\nwritten by a person unknown to her, to describe his or her character.\r\nIn this way, at what precise date is uncertain, she dictated the\r\nfollowing description of Lewis Carroll: \"Very clever head; a great\r\ndeal of number; a great deal of imitation; he would make a good actor;\r\ndiffident; rather shy in general society; comes out in the home\r\ncircle; rather obstinate; very clever; a great deal of concentration;\r\nvery affectionate; a great deal of wit and humour; not much\r\neventuality (or memory of events); fond of deep reading; imaginative,\r\nfond, of reading poetry; _may_ compose.\" Those who knew him well\r\nwill agree that this was, at any rate, a remarkable coincidence.\r\n\r\nLongley, afterwards Primate, was then Bishop of Ripon. His charming\r\ncharacter endeared him to the Archdeacon and his family, as to every\r\none else who saw much of him. He was one of the few men whose faces\r\ncan truly be called _beautiful_; it was a veil through which a\r\nsoul, all gentleness and truth, shone brightly.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1854 Mr. Dodgson was reading hard for \"Greats.\"\r\nFor the last three weeks before the examination he worked thirteen\r\nhours a day, spending the whole night before the _viva voce_ over\r\nhis books. But philosophy and history were not very congenial subjects\r\nto him, and when the list was published his name was only in the third\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Archbishop Longley.]\r\n\r\nHe spent the Long Vacation at Whitby, reading Mathematics with\r\nProfessor Price. His work bore good fruit, for in October he obtained\r\nFirst Class Honours in the Final Mathematical School. \"I am getting\r\nquite tired of being congratulated on various subjects,\" he writes;\r\n\"there seems to be no end of it. If I had shot the Dean I could hardly\r\nhave had more said about it.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter dated December 13th, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Enclosed you will find a list which I expect you to rejoice\r\n    over considerably; it will take me more than a day to\r\n    believe it, I expect--I feel at present very like a child\r\n    with a new toy, but I daresay I shall be tired of it soon,\r\n    and wish to be Pope of Rome next.... I have just been to Mr.\r\n    Price to see how I did in the papers, and the result will I\r\n    hope be gratifying to you. The following were the sums total\r\n    for each in the First Class, as nearly as I can remember:--\r\n\r\n    Dodgson   ...   ...   ... 279\r\n    Bosanquet ...   ...   ... 261\r\n    Cookson  ...   ...   ...  254\r\n    Fowler   ...   ...   ...  225\r\n    Ranken   ...   ...   ...  213\r\n\r\n    He also said he never remembered so good a set of men in.\r\n    All this is very satisfactory. I must also add (this is a\r\n    very boastful letter) that I ought to get the senior\r\n    scholarship next term.... One thing more I will add, to\r\n    crown all, and that is, I find I am the next First Class\r\n    Mathematical Student to Faussett (with the exception of\r\n    Kitchin who has given up Mathematics), so that I stand next\r\n    (as Bosanquet is going to leave) for the Lectureship.\r\n\r\nOn December 18th he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and on\r\nOctober 15, 1855, he was made a \"Master of the House,\" in honour of\r\nthe appointment of the new Dean (Dr. Liddell) who succeeded Dean\r\nGaisford. To be made Master of the House means that a man has all the\r\nprivileges of a Master of Arts within the walls of Christ Church. But\r\nhe must be of a certain number of terms' standing, and be admitted in\r\ndue form by the Vice-Chancellor, before he is a Master of Arts of the\r\nUniversity. In this wider sense Mr. Dodgson did not take his Master's\r\ndegree until 1857.\r\n\r\nThis is anticipating events, and there is much to tell of the year\r\n1855, which was a very eventful one for him. On February 15th he was\r\nmade Sub-Librarian. \"This will add £35 to my income,\" he writes, \"not\r\nmuch towards independence.\" For he was most anxious to have a\r\nsufficient income to make him his own master, that he might enter on\r\nthe literary and artistic career of which he was already dreaming. On\r\nMay 14th he wrote in his Diary: \"The Dean and Canons have been pleased\r\nto give me one of the Bostock scholarships, said to be worth £20 a\r\nyear--this very nearly raises my income this year to independence.\r\nCourage!\"\r\n\r\nHis college work, during 1855, was chiefly taking private pupils, but\r\nhe had, in addition, about three and a half hours a day of lecturing\r\nduring the last term of the year. He did not, however, work as one of\r\nthe regular staff of lecturers until the next year. From that date his\r\nwork rapidly increased, and he soon had to devote regularly as much as\r\nseven hours a day to delivering lectures, to say nothing of the time\r\nrequired for preparing them.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from his Journal, June 22, 1855, will serve to\r\nshow his early love for the drama. The scene is laid at the Princess'\r\nTheatre, then at the height of its glory:--\r\n\r\n    The evening began with a capital farce, \"Away with\r\n    Melancholy,\" and then came the great play, \"Henry VIII.,\"\r\n    the greatest theatrical treat I ever had or ever expect to\r\n    have. I had no idea that anything so superb as the scenery\r\n    and dresses was ever to be seen on the stage. Kean was\r\n    magnificent as Cardinal Wolsey, Mrs. Kean a worthy successor\r\n    to Mrs. Siddons as Queen Catherine, and all the accessories\r\n    without exception were good--but oh, that exquisite vision\r\n    of Queen Catherine's! I almost held my breath to watch: the\r\n    illusion is perfect, and I felt as if in a dream all the\r\n    time it lasted. It was like a delicious reverie, or the most\r\n    beautiful poetry. This is the true end and object of\r\n    acting--to raise the mind above itself, and out of its petty\r\n    cares. Never shall I forget that wonderful evening, that\r\n    exquisite vision--sunbeams broke in through the roof, and\r\n    gradually revealed two angel forms, floating in front of the\r\n    carved work on the ceiling: the column of sunbeams shone\r\n    down upon the sleeping queen, and gradually down it floated,\r\n    a troop of angelic forms, transparent, and carrying palm\r\n    branches in their hands: they waved these over the sleeping\r\n    queen, with oh! such a sad and solemn grace. So could I\r\n    fancy (if the thought be not profane) would real angels seem\r\n    to our mortal vision, though doubtless our conception is\r\n    poor and mean to the reality. She in an ecstasy raises her\r\n    arms towards them, and to sweet slow music, they vanish as\r\n    marvellously as they came. Then the profound silence of the\r\n    audience burst at once into a rapture of applause; but even\r\n    that scarcely marred the effect of the beautiful sad waking\r\n    words of the Queen, \"Spirits of peace, where are ye?\" I\r\n    never enjoyed anything so much in my life before; and never\r\n    felt so inclined to shed tears at anything fictitious, save\r\n    perhaps at that poetical gem of Dickens, the death of little\r\n    Paul.\r\n\r\nOn August 21st he received a long letter from his father, full of\r\nexcellent advice on the importance to a young man of saving money:--\r\n\r\n    I will just sketch for you [writes the Archdeacon] a\r\n    supposed case, applicable to your own circumstances, of a\r\n    young man of twenty-three, making up his mind to work for\r\n    ten years, and living to do it, on an Income enabling him to\r\n    save £150 a year--supposing him to appropriate it thus:--\r\n\r\n                                      £     s.    d.\r\n\r\n    Invested at 4 per cent. ...  ... 100    0     0\r\n\r\n    Life Insurance of £1,500     ...  29   15     0\r\n    Books, besides those bought in\r\n    ordinary course ...     ...  ...  20    5     0\r\n                                      _____________\r\n                                    £150    0     0\r\n\r\n    Suppose him at the end of the ten years to get a Living\r\n    enabling him to settle, what will be the result of his\r\n    savings:--\r\n\r\n      1. A nest egg of £1,220 ready money, for furnishing and\r\n    other expenses.\r\n\r\n      2. A sum of £1,500 secured at his death on payment of a\r\n    _very much_ smaller annual Premium than if he had then\r\n    begun to insure it.\r\n\r\n      3. A useful Library, worth more than £200, besides the\r\n    books bought out of his current Income during the period....\r\n\r\nThe picture on the opposite page is one of Mr. Dodgson's illustrations\r\nin _Misch-Masch,_ a periodical of the nature of _The Rectory\r\nUmbrella_, except that it contained printed stories and poems by\r\nthe editor, cut out of the various newspapers to which he had\r\ncontributed them. Of the comic papers of that day _Punch,_ of\r\ncourse, held the foremost place, but it was not without rivals; there\r\nwas a certain paper called _Diogenes_, then very near its end,\r\nwhich imitated _Punch's_ style, and in 1853 the proprietor of\r\n_The Illustrated News_, at that time one of the most opulent\r\npublishers in London, started _The Comic Times._ A capable editor\r\nwas found in Edmund Yates; \"Phiz\" and other well-known artists and\r\nwriters joined the staff, and 100,000 copies of the first number were\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Studies from English Poets II \"Alas! What\r\nBoots--\" Milton's Lucidas.]\r\n\r\nAmong the contributors was Frank Smedley, author of \"Frank Fairleigh.\"\r\nThough a confirmed invalid, and condemned to spend most of his days on\r\na sofa, Mr. Smedley managed to write several fine novels, full of the\r\njoy of life, and free from the least taint of discontent or morbid\r\nfeeling. He was one of those men--one meets them here and there--whose\r\nminds rise high above their bodily infirmities; at moments of\r\ndepression, which come to them as frequently, if not more frequently,\r\nthan to other men, they no doubt feel their weakness, and think\r\nthemselves despised, little knowing that we, the stronger ones in\r\nbody, feel nothing but admiration as we watch the splendid victory of\r\nthe soul over its earthly companion which their lives display.\r\n\r\nIt was through Frank Smedley that Mr. Dodgson became one of the\r\ncontributors to _The Comic Times_. Several of his poems appeared\r\nin it, and Mr. Yates wrote to him in the kindest manner, expressing\r\nwarm approval of them. When _The Comic Times_ changed hands in\r\n1856, and was reduced to half its size, the whole staff left it and\r\nstarted a new venture, _The Train_. They were joined by Sala,\r\nwhose stories in _Household Words_ were at that time usually\r\nascribed by the uninitiated to Charles Dickens. Mr. Dodgson's\r\ncontributions to _The Train_ included the following: \"Solitude\"\r\n(March, 1856); \"Novelty and Romancement\" (October, 1856); \"The Three\r\nVoices\" (November, 1856); \"The Sailor's Wife\" (May, 1857); and last,\r\nbut by no means least, \"Hiawatha's Photographing\" (December, 1857).\r\nAll of these, except \"Novelty and Romancement,\" have since been\r\nrepublished in \"Rhyme? and Reason?\" and \"Three Sunsets.\"\r\n\r\nThe last entry in Mr. Dodgson's Diary for this year reads as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    I am sitting alone in my bedroom this last night of the old\r\n    year, waiting for midnight. It has been the most eventful\r\n    year of my life: I began it a poor bachelor student, with no\r\n    definite plans or expectations; I end it a master and tutor\r\n    in Ch. Ch., with an income of more than £300 a year, and the\r\n    course of mathematical tuition marked out by God's\r\n    providence for at least some years to come. Great mercies,\r\n    great failings, time lost, talents misapplied--such has been\r\n    the past year.\r\n\r\nHis Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his\r\nwork, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be\r\nreproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to\r\nperform His holy will in the future. And all the time that he was thus\r\nspeaking of himself as a sinner, and a man who was utterly falling\r\nshort of his aim, he was living a life full of good deeds and\r\ninnumerable charities, a life of incessant labour and unremitting\r\nfulfilment of duty. So, I suppose, it is always with those who have a\r\nreally high ideal; the harder they try to approach it the more it\r\nseems to recede from them, or rather, perhaps, it is impossible to be\r\nboth \"the subject and spectator\" of goodness. As Coventry Patmore\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n    Become whatever good you see;\r\n      Nor sigh if, forthwith, fades from view\r\n    The grace of which you may not be\r\n      The Subject and spectator too.\r\n\r\nThe reading of \"Alton Locke\" turned his mind towards social subjects.\r\n\"If the book were but a little more definite,\" he writes, \"it might\r\nstir up many fellow-workers in the same good field of social\r\nimprovement. Oh that God, in His good providence, may make me\r\nhereafter such a worker! But alas, what are the means? Each one has\r\nhis own _nostrum_ to propound, and in the Babel of voices nothing\r\nis done. I would thankfully spend and be spent so long as I were sure\r\nof really effecting something by the sacrifice, and not merely lying\r\ndown under the wheels of some irresistible Juggernaut.\"\r\n\r\nHe was for some time the editor of _College Rhymes_, a Christ\r\nChurch paper, in which his poem, \"A Sea Dirge\" (afterwards republished\r\nin \"Phantasmagoria,\" and again in \"Rhyme? and Reason?\"), first\r\nappeared. The following verses were among his contributions to the\r\nsame magazine:--\r\n\r\n    I painted her a gushing thing,\r\n      With years perhaps a score\r\n    I little thought to find they were\r\n      At least a dozen more;\r\n    My fancy gave her eyes of blue,\r\n      A curly auburn head:\r\n    I came to find the blue a green,\r\n      The auburn turned to red.\r\n\r\n    She boxed my ears this morning,\r\n      They tingled very much;\r\n    I own that I could wish her\r\n      A somewhat lighter touch;\r\n    And if you were to ask me how\r\n      Her charms might be improved,\r\n    I would not have them _added to_,\r\n      But just a few _removed_!\r\n\r\n    She has the bear's ethereal grace,\r\n      The bland hyena's laugh,\r\n    The footstep of the elephant,\r\n      The neck of the giraffe;\r\n    I love her still, believe me,\r\n      Though my heart its passion hides;\r\n    \"She is all my fancy painted her,\"\r\n      But oh! _how much besides_!\r\n\r\nIt was when writing for _The Train_ that he first felt the need\r\nof a pseudonym. He suggested \"Dares\" (the first syllable of his\r\nbirthplace) to Edmund Yates, but, as this did not meet with his\r\neditor's approval, he wrote again, giving a choice of four names, (1)\r\nEdgar Cuthwellis, (2) Edgar U. C. Westhall, (3) Louis Carroll, and (4)\r\nLewis Carroll. The first two were formed from the letters of his two\r\nChristian names, Charles Lutwidge; the others are merely variant forms\r\nof those names--Lewis = Ludovicus = Lutwidge; Carroll = Carolus =\r\nCharles. Mr. Yates chose the last, and thenceforward it became Mr.\r\nDodgson's ordinary _nom de plume_. The first occasion on which he\r\nused it was, I believe, when he wrote \"The Path of Roses,\" a poem\r\nwhich appeared in _The Train_ in May, 1856.\r\n\r\nOn June 16th he again visited the Princess's Theatre. This time the\r\nplay was \"A Winter's Tale,\" and he \"especially admired the acting of\r\nthe little Mamillius, Ellen Terry, a beautiful little creature, who\r\nplayed with remarkable ease and spirit.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Long Vacation he spent a few weeks in the English Lake\r\nDistrict. In spite of the rain, of which he had his full share, he\r\nmanaged to see a good deal of the best scenery, and made the ascent of\r\nGable in the face of an icy gale, which laid him up with neuralgia for\r\nsome days. He and his companions returned to Croft by way of Barnard\r\nCastle, as he narrates in his Diary:--\r\n\r\n     We set out by coach for Barnard Castle at about seven, and\r\n    passed over about forty miles of the dreariest hill-country\r\n    I ever saw; the climax of wretchedness was reached in Bowes,\r\n    where yet stands the original of \"Dotheboys Hall\"; it has\r\n    long ceased to be used as a school, and is falling into\r\n    ruin, in which the whole place seems to be following its\r\n    example--the roofs are falling in, and the windows broken or\r\n    barricaded--the whole town looks plague-stricken. The\r\n    courtyard of the inn we stopped at was grown over with\r\n    weeds, and a mouthing idiot lolled against the corner of the\r\n    house, like the evil genius of the spot. Next to a prison or\r\n    a lunatic asylum, preserve me from living at Bowes!\r\n\r\nAlthough he was anything but a sportsman, he was interested in the\r\nsubject of betting, from a mathematical standpoint solely, and in 1857\r\nhe sent a letter to _Bell's Life_, explaining a method by which a\r\nbetting man might ensure winning over any race. The system was either\r\nto back _every_ horse, or to lay against _every_ horse,\r\naccording to the way the odds added up. He showed his scheme to a\r\nsporting friend, who remarked, \"An excellent system, and you're bound\r\nto win--_if only you can get people to take your bets_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year he made the acquaintance of Tennyson, whose writings\r\nhe had long intensely admired. He thus describes the poet's\r\nappearance:--\r\n\r\n    A strange shaggy-looking man; his hair, moustache, and beard\r\n    looked wild and neglected; these very much hid the character\r\n    of the face. He was dressed in a loosely fitting morning\r\n    coat, common grey flannel waistcoat and trousers, and a\r\n    carelessly tied black silk neckerchief. His hair is black; I\r\n    think the eyes too; they are keen and restless--nose\r\n    aquiline--forehead high and broad--both face and head are\r\n    fine and manly. His manner was kind and friendly from the\r\n    first; there is a dry lurking humour in his style of\r\n    talking.\r\n\r\n    I took the opportunity [he goes on to say] of asking the\r\n    meaning of two passages in his poems, which have always\r\n    puzzled me: one in \"Maud\"--\r\n\r\n      Strange that I hear two men\r\n        Somewhere talking of me;\r\n      Well, if it prove a girl, my boy\r\n        Will have plenty; so let it be.\r\n\r\n    He said it referred to Maud, and to the two fathers\r\n    arranging a match between himself and her.\r\n\r\n    The other was of the poet--\r\n\r\n      Dowered with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,\r\n        The love of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n    He said that he was quite willing it should bear any meaning\r\n    the words would fairly bear; to the best of his recollection\r\n    his meaning when he wrote it was \"the hate of the quality\r\n    hate, &c.,\" but he thought the meaning of \"the quintessence\r\n    of hatred\" finer. He said there had never been a poem so\r\n    misunderstood by the \"ninnies of critics\" as \"Maud.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alfred Tennyson. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll._]\r\n\r\nDuring an evening spent at Tent Lodge Tennyson remarked, on the\r\nsimilarity of the monkey's skull to the human, that a young monkey's\r\nskull is quite human in shape, and gradually alters--the analogy being\r\nborne out by the human skull being at first more like the statues of\r\nthe gods, and gradually degenerating into human; and then, turning to\r\nMrs. Tennyson, \"There, that's the second original remark I've made\r\nthis evening!\" Mr. Dodgson saw a great deal of the Tennysons after\r\nthis, and photographed the poet himself and various members of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn October he made the acquaintance of John Ruskin, who in after years\r\nwas always willing to assist him with his valuable advice on any point\r\nof artistic criticism. Mr. Dodgson was singularly fortunate in his\r\nfriends; whenever he was in difficulties on any technical matters,\r\nwhether of religion, law, medicine, art, or whatever it might be, he\r\nalways had some one especially distinguished in that branch of study\r\nwhose aid he could seek as a friend. In particular, the names of Canon\r\nKing (now Bishop of Lincoln), and Sir James Paget occur to me; to the\r\nlatter Mr. Dodgson addressed many letters on questions of medicine and\r\nsurgery--some of them intricate enough, but never too intricate to\r\nweary the unfailing patience of the great surgeon.\r\n\r\nA note in Mr. Dodgson's Journal, May 9, 1857, describes his\r\nintroduction to Thackeray:--\r\n\r\n    I breakfasted this morning with Fowler of Lincoln to meet\r\n    Thackeray (the author), who delivered his lecture on George\r\n    III. in Oxford last night. I was much pleased with what I\r\n    saw of him; his manner is simple and unaffected; he shows no\r\n    anxiety to shine in conversation, though full of fun and\r\n    anecdote when drawn out. He seemed delighted with the\r\n    reception he had met with last night: the undergraduates\r\n    seem to have behaved with most unusual moderation.\r\n\r\nThe next few years of his life passed quietly, and without any unusual\r\nevents to break the monotony of college routine. He spent his mornings\r\nin the lecture-rooms, his afternoons in the country or on the\r\nriver--he was very fond of boating--and his evenings in his room,\r\nreading and preparing for the next day's work. But in spite of all\r\nthis outward calm of life, his mind was very much exercised on the\r\nsubject of taking Holy Orders. Not only was this step necessary if he\r\nwished to retain his Studentship, but also he felt that it would give\r\nhim much more influence among the undergraduates, and thus increase\r\nhis power of doing good. On the other hand, he was not prepared to\r\nlive the life of almost puritanical strictness which was then\r\nconsidered essential for a clergyman, and he saw that the impediment\r\nof speech from which he suffered would greatly interfere with the\r\nproper performance of his clerical duties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bishop of Lincoln. _From a photograph by\r\nLewis Carroll_]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Oxford, Dr. Wilberforce, had expressed the opinion that\r\nthe \"resolution to attend theatres or operas was an absolute\r\ndisqualification for Holy Orders,\" which discouraged him very much,\r\nuntil it transpired that this statement was only meant to refer to the\r\nparochial clergy. He discussed the matter with Dr. Pusey, and with Dr.\r\nLiddon. The latter said that \"he thought a deacon might lawfully, if\r\nhe found himself unfit for the work, abstain from direct ministerial\r\nduty.\" And so, with many qualms about his own unworthiness, he at last\r\ndecided to prepare definitely for ordination.\r\n\r\nOn December 22, 1861, he was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Oxford.\r\nHe never proceeded to priest's orders, partly, I think, because he\r\nfelt that if he were to do so it would be his duty to undertake\r\nregular parochial work, and partly on account of his stammering. He\r\nused, however, to preach not unfrequently, and his sermons were always\r\ndelightful to listen to, his extreme earnestness being evident in\r\nevery word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bishop Wilberforce. _From a photograph by\r\nLewis Carroll_.]\r\n\r\n\"He knew exactly what he wished to say\" (I am quoting from an article\r\nin _The Guardian_), \"and completely forgot his audience in his\r\nanxiety to explain his point clearly. He thought of the subject only,\r\nand the words came of themselves. Looking straight in front of him he\r\nsaw, as it were, his argument mapped out in the form of a diagram, and\r\nhe set to work to prove it point by point, under its separate heads,\r\nand then summed up the whole.\"\r\n\r\nOne sermon which he preached in the University Church, on Eternal\r\nPunishment, is not likely to be soon forgotten by those who heard it.\r\nI, unfortunately, was not of that number, but I can well imagine how\r\nhis clear-cut features would light up as he dwelt lovingly upon the\r\nmercy of that Being whose charity far exceeds \"the measure of man's\r\nmind.\" It is hardly necessary to say that he himself did not believe\r\nin eternal punishment, or any other scholastic doctrine that\r\ncontravenes the love of God.\r\n\r\nHe disliked being complimented on his sermons, but he liked to be told\r\nof any good effects that his words had had upon any member of the\r\ncongregation. \"Thank you for telling me that fact about my sermon,\" he\r\nwrote to one of his sisters, who told him of some such good fruit that\r\none of his addresses had borne. \"I have once or twice had such\r\ninformation volunteered; and it is a _great_ comfort--and a kind\r\nof thing that is _really_ good for one to know. It is _not_\r\ngood to be told (and I never wish to be told), 'Your sermon was so\r\n_beautiful_.' We shall not be concerned to know, in the Great\r\nDay, whether we have preached beautiful sermons, but whether they were\r\npreached with the one object of serving God.\"\r\n\r\nHe was always ready and willing to preach at the special service for\r\nCollege servants, which used to be held at Christ Church every Sunday\r\nevening; but best of all he loved to preach to children. Some of his\r\nlast sermons were delivered at Christ Church, Eastbourne (the church\r\nhe regularly attended during the Long Vacation), to a congregation of\r\nchildren. On those occasions he told them an allegory--_Victor and\r\nArnion,_ which he intended to publish in course of time--putting\r\nall his heart into the work, and speaking with such deep feeling that\r\nat times he was almost unable to control his emotion as he told them\r\nof the love and compassion of the Good Shepherd.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length on this side of his life, for it is, I am\r\nsure, almost ignored in the popular estimate of him. He was\r\nessentially a religious man in the best sense of the term, and without\r\nany of that morbid sentimentality which is too often associated with\r\nthe word; and while his religion consecrated his talents, and raised\r\nhim to a height which without it he could never have reached, the\r\nexample of such a man as he was, so brilliant, so witty, so\r\nsuccessful, and yet so full of faith, consecrates the very conception\r\nof religion, and makes it yet more beautiful.\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1859, he paid another visit to Tennyson, this time at\r\nFarringford.\r\n\r\n    After dinner we retired for about an hour to the\r\n    smoking-room, where I saw the proof-sheets of the \"King's\r\n    Idylls,\" but he would not let me read them. He walked\r\n    through the garden with me when I left, and made me remark\r\n    an effect produced on the thin white clouds by the moon\r\n    shining through, which I had not noticed--a ring of golden\r\n    light at some distance off the moon, with an interval of\r\n    white between--this, he says, he has alluded to in one of\r\n    his early poems (\"Margaret,\" vol. i.), \"the tender amber.\" I\r\n    asked his opinion of Sydney Dobell--he agrees with me in\r\n    liking \"Grass from the Battlefield,\" and thinks him a writer\r\n    of genius and imagination, but extravagant.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he showed the poet a photograph which he had taken\r\nof Miss Alice Liddell as a beggar-child, and which Tennyson said was\r\nthe most beautiful photograph he had ever seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alice Liddell as Beggar-child. _From a\r\nphotograph by Lewis Carroll_.]\r\n\r\n    Tennyson told us he had often dreamed long passages of\r\n    poetry, and believed them to be good at the time, though he\r\n    could never remember them after waking, except four lines\r\n    which he dreamed at ten years old:--\r\n\r\n      May a cock sparrow\r\n      Write to a barrow?\r\n      I hope you'll excuse\r\n      My infantile muse;\r\n\r\n    --which, as an unpublished fragment of the Poet Laureate,\r\n    may be thought interesting, but not affording much promise\r\n    of his after powers.\r\n\r\n    He also told us he once dreamed an enormously long poem\r\n    about fairies, which began with very long lines that\r\n    gradually got shorter, and ended with fifty or sixty lines\r\n    of two syllables each!\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 1859, the Prince of Wales came into residence at Christ\r\nChurch. The Dean met him at the station, and all the dons assembled in\r\nTom Quadrangle to welcome him. Mr. Dodgson, as usual, had an eye to a\r\nphotograph, in which hope, however, he was doomed to disappointment.\r\nHis Royal Highness was tired of having his picture taken.\r\n\r\nDuring his early college life he used often to spend a few days at\r\nHastings, with his mother's sisters, the Misses Lutwidge. In a letter\r\nwritten from their house to his sister Mary, and dated April 11, 1860,\r\nhe gives an account of a lecture he had just heard:--\r\n\r\n    I am just returned from a series of dissolving views on the\r\n    Arctic regions, and, while the information there received is\r\n    still fresh in my mind, I will try to give you some of it.\r\n    In the first place, you may not know that one of the objects\r\n    of the Arctic expeditions was to discover \"the intensity of\r\n    the magnetic needle.\" He [the lecturer] did not tell us,\r\n    however, whether they had succeeded in discovering it, or\r\n    whether that rather obscure question is still doubtful. One\r\n    of the explorers, Baffin, \"_though_ he did not suffer\r\n    all the hardships the others did, _yet_ he came to an\r\n    untimely end (of course one would think in the Arctic\r\n    regions), _for instance_ (what follows being, I\r\n    suppose, one of the untimely ends he came to), being engaged\r\n    in a war of the Portuguese against the Prussians, while\r\n    measuring the ground in front of a fortification, a\r\n    cannon-ball came against him, with the force with which\r\n    cannon-balls in that day _did_ come, and killed him\r\n    dead on the spot.\" How many instances of this kind would you\r\n    demand to prove that he did come to an untimely end? One of\r\n    the ships was laid up three years in the ice, during which\r\n    time, he told us, \"Summer came and went frequently.\" This, I\r\n    think, was the most remarkable phenomenon he mentioned in\r\n    the whole lecture, and gave _me_ quite a new idea of\r\n    those regions.\r\n\r\n    On Tuesday I went to a concert at St. Leonard's. On the\r\n    front seat sat a youth about twelve years of age, of whom\r\n    the enclosed is a tolerably accurate sketch. He really was,\r\n    I think, the ugliest boy I ever saw. I wish I could get an\r\n    opportunity of photographing him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch from St. Leonard's Concert-Room.]\r\n\r\nThe following note occurs in his Journal for May 6th:--\r\n\r\n    A Christ Church man, named Wilmot, who is just returned from\r\n    the West Indies, dined in Hall. He told us some curious\r\n    things about the insects in South America--one that he had\r\n    himself seen was a spider charming a cockroach with flashes\r\n    of light; they were both on the wall, the spider about a\r\n    yard the highest, and the light was like a glow-worm, only\r\n    that it came by flashes and did not shine continuously; the\r\n    cockroach gradually crawled up to it, and allowed itself to\r\n    be taken and killed.\r\n\r\n    A few months afterwards, when in town and visiting Mr.\r\n    Munroe's studio, he found there two of the children of Mr.\r\n    George Macdonald, whose acquaintance he had already made:\r\n    \"They were a girl and boy, about seven and six years old--I\r\n    claimed their acquaintance, and began at once proving to the\r\n    boy, Greville, that he had better take the opportunity of\r\n    having his head changed for a marble one. The effect was\r\n    that in about two minutes they had entirely forgotten that I\r\n    was a total stranger, and were earnestly arguing the\r\n    question as if we were old acquaintances.\" Mr. Dodgson urged\r\n    that a marble head would not have to be brushed and combed.\r\n    At this the boy turned to his sister with an air of great\r\n    relief, saying, \"Do you hear _that_, Mary? It needn't\r\n    be combed!\" And the narrator adds, \"I have no doubt combing,\r\n    with his great head of long hair, like Hallam Tennyson's,\r\n    was _the_ misery of his life. His final argument was\r\n    that a marble head couldn't speak, and as I couldn't\r\n    convince either that he would be all the better for that, I\r\n    gave in.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George Macdonald and his daughter Lily.\r\n_From a photograph by Lewis Carroll._]\r\n\r\nIn November he gave a lecture at a meeting of the Ashmolean Society on\r\n\"Where does the Day begin?\" The problem, which was one he was very\r\nfond of propounding, may be thus stated: If a man could travel round\r\nthe world so fast that the sun would be always directly above his\r\nhead, and if he were to start travelling at midday on Tuesday, then in\r\ntwenty-four hours he would return to his original point of departure,\r\nand would find that the day was now called Wednesday--at what point of\r\nhis journey would the day change its name? The difficulty of answering\r\nthis apparently simple question has cast a gloom over many a pleasant\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nOn December 12th he wrote in his Diary:--\r\n\r\n    Visit of the Queen to Oxford, to the great surprise of\r\n    everybody, as it had been kept a secret up to the time. She\r\n    arrived in Christ Church about twelve, and came into Hall\r\n    with the Dean, where the Collections were still going on,\r\n    about a dozen men being in Hall. The party consisted of the\r\n    Queen, Prince Albert, Princess Alice and her intended\r\n    husband, the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Prince of Wales,\r\n    Prince Alfred, and suite. They remained a minute or two\r\n    looking at the pictures, and the Sub-Dean was presented:\r\n    they then visited the Cathedral and Library. Evening\r\n    entertainment at the Deanery, _tableaux vivants_. I\r\n    went a little after half-past eight, and found a great party\r\n    assembled--the Prince had not yet come. He arrived before\r\n    nine, and I found an opportunity of reminding General Bruce\r\n    of his promise to introduce me to the Prince, which he did\r\n    at the next break in the conversation H.R.H. was holding\r\n    with Mrs. Fellowes. He shook hands very graciously, and I\r\n    began with a sort of apology for having been so importunate\r\n    about the photograph. He said something of the weather being\r\n    against it, and I asked if the Americans had victimised him\r\n    much as a sitter; he said they had, but he did not think\r\n    they had succeeded well, and I told him of the new American\r\n    process of taking twelve thousand photographs in an hour.\r\n    Edith Liddell coming by at the moment, I remarked on the\r\n    beautiful _tableau_ which the children might make: he\r\n    assented, and also said, in answer to my question, that he\r\n    had seen and admired my photographs of them. I then said\r\n    that I hoped, as I had missed the photograph, he would at\r\n    least give me his autograph in my album, which he promised\r\n    to do. Thinking I had better bring the talk to an end, I\r\n    concluded by saying that, if he would like copies of any of\r\n    my photographs, I should feel honoured by his accepting\r\n    them; he thanked me for this, and I then drew back, as he\r\n    did not seem inclined to pursue the conversation.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the Prince gave him his autograph, and also\r\nchose a dozen or so of his photograph (sic).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Mrs. Rossetti and her children Dante Gabriel,\r\nChristina, and William. _From a photograph by Lewis Carroll._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n(1861-1867)\r\n\r\n    Jowett--Index to \"In Memoriam\"--The Tennysons--The beginning\r\n    of \"Alice\"--Tenniel--Artistic friends--\"Alice's Adventures\r\n    in Wonderland\"--\"Bruno's Revenge\"--Tour with Dr.\r\n    Liddon--Cologne--Berlin architecture--The \"Majesty of\r\n    Justice\"--Peterhof--Moscow--A Russian wedding--Nijni--The\r\n    Troitska Monastery--\"Hieroglyphic\" writing--Giessen.\r\n\r\nIt is my aim in this Memoir to let Mr. Dodgson tell his own story as\r\nmuch as possible. In order to effect this object I have drawn largely\r\nupon his Diary and correspondence. Very few men have left behind them\r\nsuch copious information about their lives as he has; unfortunately it\r\nis not equally copious throughout, and this fact must be my apology\r\nfor the somewhat haphazard and disconnected way in which parts of this\r\nbook are written. That it is the best which, under the circumstances,\r\nI have been able to do needs, I hope, no saying, but the circumstances\r\nhave at times been too strong for me.\r\n\r\nThough in later years Mr. Dodgson almost gave up the habit of dining\r\nout, at this time of his life he used to do it pretty frequently, and\r\nseveral of the notes in his Diary refer to after-dinner and Common\r\nRoom stories. The two following extracts will show the sort of facts\r\nhe recorded:--\r\n\r\n    _January 2, 1861._--Mr. Grey (Canon) came to dine and\r\n    stay the night. He told me a curious old custom of millers,\r\n    that they place the sails of the mill as a Saint Andrew's\r\n    Cross when work is entirely suspended, thus x, but in an\r\n    upright cross, thus +, if they are just going to resume\r\n    work. He also mentioned that he was at school with Dr.\r\n    Tennyson (father of the poet), and was a great favourite of\r\n    his. He remembers that Tennyson used to do his\r\n    school-translations in rhyme.\r\n\r\n    _May 9th._--Met in Common Room Rev. C.F. Knight, and\r\n    the Hon'ble. F.J. Parker, both of Boston, U.S. The former\r\n    gave an amusing account of having seen Oliver Wendell Holmes\r\n    in a fishmonger's, lecturing _extempore_ on the head of\r\n    a freshly killed turtle, whose eyes and jaws still showed\r\n    muscular action: the lecture of course being all \"cram,\" but\r\n    accepted as sober earnest by the mob outside.\r\n\r\nOld Oxford men will remember the controversies that raged from about\r\n1860 onwards over the opinions of the late Dr. Jowett. In my time the\r\nname \"Jowett\" only represented the brilliant translator of Plato, and\r\nthe deservedly loved master of Balliol, whose sermons in the little\r\nCollege Chapel were often attended by other than Balliol men, and\r\nwhose reputation for learning was expressed in the well-known verse of\r\n\"The Masque of Balliol\":--\r\n\r\n      First come I, my name is Jowett.\r\n      There's no knowledge but I know it;\r\n      I am Master of this College;\r\n      What I don't know isn't knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut in 1861 he was anything but universally popular, and I am afraid\r\nthat Mr. Dodgson, nothing if not a staunch Conservative, sided with\r\nthe majority against him. Thus he wrote in his Diary:--\r\n\r\n    _November 20th._--Promulgation, in Congregation, of the\r\n    new statute to endow Jowett. The speaking took up the whole\r\n    afternoon, and the two points at issue, the endowing a\r\n    _Regius_ Professorship, and the countenancing Jowett's\r\n    theological opinions, got so inextricably mixed up that I\r\n    rose to beg that they might be kept separate. Once on my\r\n    feet, I said more than I at first meant, and defied them\r\n    ever to tire out the opposition by perpetually bringing the\r\n    question on (_Mem_.: if I ever speak again I will try\r\n    to say no more than I had resolved before rising). This was\r\n    my first speech in Congregation.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1862 an \"Index to In Memoriam,\" compiled by Mr.\r\nDodgson and his sisters, was published by Moxon. Tennyson had given\r\nhis consent, and the little book proved to be very useful to his\r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nOn January 27th Morning Prayer was for the first time read in English\r\nat the Christ Church College Service. On the same day Mr. Dodgson\r\nmoved over into new rooms, as the part of the College where he had\r\nformerly lived (Chaplain's Quadrangle) was to be pulled down.\r\n\r\nDuring the Easter Vacation he paid another visit to the Tennysons,\r\nwhich he describes as follows:--\r\n\r\n    After luncheon I went to the Tennysons, and got Hallam and\r\n    Lionel to sign their names in my album. Also I made a\r\n    bargain with Lionel, that he was to give me some MS. of his\r\n    verses, and I was to send him some of mine. It was a very\r\n    difficult bargain to make; I almost despaired of it at\r\n    first, he put in so many conditions--first, I was to play a\r\n    game of chess with him; this, with much difficulty, was\r\n    reduced to twelve moves on each side; but this made little\r\n    difference, as I check-mated him at the sixth move. Second,\r\n    he was to be allowed to give me one blow on the head with a\r\n    mallet (this he at last consented to give up). I forget if\r\n    there were others, but it ended in my getting the verses,\r\n    for which I have written out \"The Lonely Moor\" for him.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson took a great interest in occult phenomena, and was for\r\nsome time an enthusiastic member of the \"Psychical Society.\" It was\r\nhis interest in ghosts that led to his meeting with the artist Mr.\r\nHeaphy, who had painted a picture of a ghost which he himself had\r\nseen. I quote the following from a letter to his sister Mary:--\r\n\r\n    During my last visit to town, I paid a very interesting\r\n    visit to a new artist, Mr. Heaphy. Do you remember that\r\n    curious story of a ghost lady (in _Household Words_ or\r\n    _All the Year Round_), who sat to an artist for her\r\n    picture; it was called \"Mr. H.'s Story,\" and he was the\r\n    writer.... He received me most kindly, and we had a very\r\n    interesting talk about the ghost, which certainly is one of\r\n    the most curious and inexplicable stories I ever heard. He\r\n    showed me her picture (life size), and she must have been\r\n    very lovely, if it is like her (or like it, which ever is\r\n    the correct pronoun).... Mr. Heaphy showed me a most\r\n    interesting collection of drawings he has made abroad; he\r\n    has been about, hunting up the earliest and most authentic\r\n    pictures of our Saviour, some merely outlines, some coloured\r\n    pictures. They agree wonderfully in the character of the\r\n    face, and one, he says, there is no doubt was done before\r\n    the year 150.... I feel sure from his tone that he is doing\r\n    this in a religious spirit, and not merely as an artist.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1862, there is a very important entry: \"I made an\r\nexpedition _up_ the river to Godstow with the three Liddells; we\r\nhad tea on the bank there, and did not reach Christ Church till\r\nhalf-past eight.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lorina, Alice, and Edith Liddell. _From a\r\nphotograph by Lewis Carroll_.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page he added, somewhat later, \"On which occasion I\r\ntold them the fairy-tale of 'Alice's Adventures Underground,' which I\r\nundertook to write out for Alice.\"\r\n\r\nThese words need to be supplemented by the verses with which he\r\nprefaced the \"Wonderland\":--\r\n\r\n        All in the golden afternoon\r\n          Full leisurely we glide;\r\n        For both our oars, with little skill,\r\n          By little arms are plied,\r\n        While little hands make vain pretence\r\n          Our wanderings to guide.\r\n\r\n        Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,\r\n          Beneath such dreamy weather,\r\n        To beg a tale of breath too weak\r\n          To stir the tiniest feather!\r\n        Yet what can one poor voice avail\r\n          Against three tongues together?\r\n\r\n        Imperious Prima flashes forth\r\n          Her edict \"to begin it\"--\r\n        In gentler tones Secunda hopes\r\n          \"There will be nonsense in it!\"\r\n        While Tertia interrupts the tale\r\n          Not _more_ than once a minute.\r\n\r\n        Anon, to sudden silence won,\r\n          In fancy they pursue\r\n        The dream-child moving through a land\r\n          Of wonders wild and new,\r\n        In friendly chat with bird or beast--\r\n          And half believe it true.\r\n\r\n        And ever, as the story drained\r\n          The wells of fancy dry,\r\n        And faintly strove that weary one\r\n          To put the subject by,\r\n        \"The rest next time\"--\"It _is_ next time!\"\r\n          The happy voices cry.\r\n\r\n        Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:\r\n          Thus slowly, one by one,\r\n        Its quaint events were hammered out--\r\n          And now the tale is done,\r\n        And home we steer, a merry crew,\r\n          Beneath the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Alice\" herself (Mrs. Reginald Hargreaves) has given an account of the\r\nscene, from which what follows is quoted:--\r\n\r\n    Most of Mr. Dodgson's stories were told to us on river\r\n    expeditions to Nuneham or Godstow, near Oxford. My eldest\r\n    sister, now Mrs. Skene, was \"Prima,\" I was \"Secunda,\" and\r\n    \"Tertia\" was my sister Edith. I believe the beginning of\r\n    \"Alice\" was told one summer afternoon when the sun was so\r\n    burning that we had landed in the meadows down the river,\r\n    deserting the boat to take refuge in the only bit of shade\r\n    to be found, which was under a new-made hayrick. Here from\r\n    all three came the old petition of \"Tell us a story,\" and so\r\n    began the ever-delightful tale. Sometimes to tease us--and\r\n    perhaps being really tired--Mr. Dodgson would stop suddenly\r\n    and say, \"And that's all till next time.\" \"Ah, but it is\r\n    next time,\" would be the exclamation from all three; and\r\n    after some persuasion the story would start afresh. Another\r\n    day, perhaps, the story would begin in the boat, and Mr.\r\n    Dodgson, in the middle of telling a thrilling adventure,\r\n    would pretend to go fast asleep, to our great dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Alice's Adventures Underground\" was the original name of the story;\r\nlater on it became \"Alice's Hour in Elfland.\" It was not until June\r\n18, 1864, that he finally decided upon \"Alice's Adventures in\r\nWonderland.\" The illustrating of the manuscript book gave him some\r\ntrouble. He had to borrow a \"Natural History\" from the Deanery to\r\nlearn the correct shapes of some of the strange animals with which\r\nAlice conversed; the Mock Turtle he must have evolved out of his inner\r\nconsciousness, for it is, I think, a species unknown to naturalists.\r\n\r\nHe was lucky enough during the course of the year to see a ceremony\r\nwhich is denied to most Oxford men. When degrees are given, any\r\ntradesman who has been unable to get his due from an undergraduate\r\nabout to be made a Bachelor of Arts is allowed, by custom, to pluck\r\nthe Proctor's gown as he passes, and then to make his complaint. This\r\nlaw is more honoured in the breach than in the observance; but, on the\r\noccasion of this visit of Mr. Dodgson's to Convocation, the Proctor's\r\ngown was actually plucked--on account of an unfortunate man who had\r\ngone through the Bankruptcy Court.\r\n\r\nWhen he promised to write out \"Alice\" for Miss Liddell he had no idea\r\nof publication; but his friend, Mr. George Macdonald, to whom he had\r\nshown the story, persuaded him to submit it to a publisher. Messrs.\r\nMacmillan agreed to produce it, and as Mr. Dodgson had not sufficient\r\nfaith in his own artistic powers to venture to allow his illustrations\r\nto appear, it was necessary to find some artist who would undertake\r\nthe work. By the advice of Tom Taylor he approached Mr. Tenniel, who\r\nwas fortunately well disposed, and on April 5, 1864, the final\r\narrangements were made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George MacDonald. _From a photograph by\r\nLewis Carroll_.]\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of a meeting with Mr. Dodgson is\r\nfrom the pen of Mrs. Bennie, wife of the Rector of Glenfield, near\r\nLeicester:--\r\n\r\n    Some little time after the publication of \"Alice's\r\n    Adventures\" we went for our summer holiday to Whitby. We\r\n    were visiting friends, and my brother and sister went to the\r\n    hotel. They soon after asked us to dine with them there at\r\n    the _table d'hôte._ I had on one side of me a gentleman\r\n    whom I did not know, but as I had spent a good deal of time\r\n    travelling in foreign countries, I always, at once, speak to\r\n    any one I am placed next. I found on this occasion I had a\r\n    very agreeable neighbour, and we seemed to be much\r\n    interested in the same books, and politics also were touched\r\n    on. After dinner my sister and brother rather took me to\r\n    task for talking so much to a complete stranger. I said.\r\n    \"But it was quite a treat to talk to him and to hear him\r\n    talk. Of one thing I am quite sure, he is a genius.\" My\r\n    brother and sister, who had not heard him speak, again\r\n    laughed at me, and said, \"You are far too easily pleased.\"\r\n    I, however, maintained my point, and said what great delight\r\n    his conversation had given me, and how remarkably clever it\r\n    had been. Next morning nurse took out our two little twin\r\n    daughters in front of the sea. I went out a short time\r\n    afterwards, looked for them, and found them seated with my\r\n    friend of the _table d'hôte_ between them, and they\r\n    were listening to him, open-mouthed, and in the greatest\r\n    state of enjoyment, with his knee covered with minute toys.\r\n    I, seeing their great delight, motioned to him to go on;\r\n    this he did for some time. A most charming story he told\r\n    them about sea-urchins and Ammonites. When it was over, I\r\n    said, \"You must be the author of 'Alice's Adventures.'\" He\r\n    laughed, but looked astonished, and said, \"My dear Madam, my\r\n    name is Dodgson, and 'Alice's Adventures' was written by\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\" I replied, \"Then you must have borrowed the\r\n    name, for only he could have told a story as you have just\r\n    done.\" After a little sparring he admitted the fact, and I\r\n    went home and proudly told my sister and brother how my\r\n    genius had turned out a greater one than I expected. They\r\n    assured me I must be mistaken, and that, as I had suggested\r\n    it to him, he had taken advantage of the idea, and said he\r\n    was what I wanted him to be. A few days after some friends\r\n    came to Whitby who knew his aunts, and confirmed the truth\r\n    of his statement, and thus I made the acquaintance of one\r\n    whose friendship has been the source of great pleasure for\r\n    nearly thirty years. He has most generously sent us all his\r\n    books, with kind inscriptions, to \"Minnie and Doe,\" whom he\r\n    photographed, but would not take Canon Bennie or me; he said\r\n    he never took portraits of people of more than seventeen\r\n    years of age until they were seventy. He visited us, and we\r\n    often met him at Eastbourne, and his death was indeed a\r\n    great loss after so many happy years of friendship with one\r\n    we so greatly admired and loved.\r\n\r\nHe spent a part of the Long Vacation at Freshwater, taking great\r\ninterest in the children who, for him, were the chief attraction of\r\nthe seaside.\r\n\r\n    Every morning four little children dressed in yellow go by\r\n    from the front down to the beach: they go by in a state of\r\n    great excitement, brandishing wooden spades, and making\r\n    strange noises; from that moment they disappear\r\n    entirely--they are never to be seen _on_ the beach. The\r\n    only theory I can form is, that they all tumble into a hole\r\n    somewhere, and continue excavating therein during the day:\r\n    however that may be, I have once or twice come across them\r\n    returning at night, in exactly the same state of excitement,\r\n    and seemingly in quite as great a hurry to get home as they\r\n    were before to get out. The evening noises they make sound\r\n    to me very much like the morning noises, but I suppose they\r\n    are different to them, and contain an account of the day's\r\n    achievements.\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm for photography, and his keen appreciation of the\r\nbeautiful, made him prefer the society of artists to that of any other\r\nclass of people. He knew the Rossettis intimately, and his Diary shows\r\nhim to have been acquainted with Millais, Holman Hunt, Sant,\r\nWestmacott, Val Prinsep, Watts, and a host of others. Arthur Hughes\r\npainted a charming picture to his order (\"The Lady with the Lilacs\")\r\nwhich used to hang in his rooms at Christ Church. The Andersons were\r\ngreat friends of his, Mrs. Anderson being one of his favourite\r\nchild-painters. Those who have visited him at Oxford will remember a\r\nbeautiful girl's head, painted by her from a rough sketch she had once\r\nmade in a railway carriage of a child who happened to be sitting\r\nopposite her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. Sant. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nHis own drawings were in no way remarkable. Ruskin, whose advice he\r\ntook on his artistic capabilities, told him that he had not enough\r\ntalent to make it worth his while to devote much time to sketching,\r\nbut every one who saw his photographs admired them. Considering the\r\ndifficulties of the \"wet process,\" and the fact that he had a\r\nconscientious horror of \"touching up\" his negatives, the pictures he\r\nproduced are quite wonderful. Some of them were shown to the Queen,\r\nwho said that she admired them very much, and that they were \"such as\r\nthe Prince would have appreciated very highly, and taken much pleasure\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Holman Hunt. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1865, exactly three years after the memorable row up the\r\nriver, Miss Alice Liddell received the first presentation copy of\r\n\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\": the second was sent to Princess\r\nBeatrice.\r\n\r\nThe first edition, which consisted of two thousand copies, was\r\ncondemned by both author and illustrator, for the pictures did not\r\ncome out well. All purchasers were accordingly asked to return their\r\ncopies, and to send their names and addresses; a new edition was\r\nprepared, and distributed to those who had sent back their old copies,\r\nwhich the author gave away to various homes and hospitals. The\r\nsubstituted edition was a complete success, \"a perfect piece of\r\nartistic printing,\" as Mr. Dodgson called it. He hardly dared to hope\r\nthat more than two thousand copies would be sold, and anticipated a\r\nconsiderable loss over the book. His surprise was great when edition\r\nafter edition was demanded, and when he found that \"Alice,\" far from\r\nbeing a monetary failure, was bringing him in a very considerable\r\nincome every year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir John Millais. _From a photograph by\r\nLewis Carroll_]\r\n\r\nA rough comparison between \"Alice's Adventures Underground\" and the\r\nbook in its completed form, shows how slight were the alterations that\r\nLewis Carroll thought it necessary to make.\r\n\r\nThe \"Wonderland\" is somewhat longer, but the general plan of the book,\r\nand the simplicity of diction, which is one of its principal charms,\r\nare unchanged. His memory was so good that I believe the story as he\r\nwrote it down was almost word for word the same that he had told in\r\nthe boat. The whole idea came like an inspiration into his mind, and\r\nthat sort of inspiration does not often come more than once in a\r\nlifetime. Nothing which he wrote afterwards had anything like the same\r\namount of freshness, of wit, of real genius. The \"Looking-Glass\" most\r\nclosely approached it in these qualities, but then it was only the\r\nfollowing out of the same idea. The most ingenuous comparison of the\r\ntwo books I have seen was the answer of a little girl whom Lewis\r\nCarroll had asked if she had read them: \"Oh yes, I've read both of\r\nthem, and I think,\" (this more slowly and thoughtfully) \"I think\r\n'Through the Looking-Glass' is more stupid than 'Alice's Adventures.'\r\nDon't you think so?\"\r\n\r\nThe critics were loud in their praises of \"Alice\"; there was hardly a\r\ndissentient voice among them, and the reception which the public gave\r\nthe book justified their opinion. So recently as July, 1898, the\r\n_Pall Mall Gazette_ conducted an inquiry into the popularity of\r\nchildren's books. \"The verdict is so natural that it will surprise no\r\nnormal person. The winner is 'Alice in Wonderland'; 'Through the\r\nLooking-Glass' is in the twenty, but much lower down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alice\" has been translated into French, German, Italian, and Dutch,\r\nwhile one poem, \"Father William,\" has even been turned into Arabic.\r\nSeveral plays have been based upon it; lectures have been given,\r\nillustrated by magic-lantern slides of Tenniel's pictures, which have\r\nalso adorned wall-papers and biscuit-boxes. Mr. Dodgson himself\r\ndesigned a very ingenious \"Wonderland\" stamp-case; there has been an\r\n\"Alice\" birthday-book; at schools, children have been taught to read\r\nout of \"Alice,\" while the German edition, shortened and simplified for\r\nthe purpose, has also been used as a lesson-book. With the exception\r\nof Shakespeare's plays, very few, if any, books are so frequently\r\nquoted in the daily Press as the two \"Alices.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Mr. Dodgson was introduced to Miss Charlotte M. Yonge, whose\r\nnovels had long delighted him. \"It was a pleasure I had long hoped\r\nfor,\" he says, \"and I was very much pleased with her cheerful and easy\r\nmanners--the sort of person one knows in a few minutes as well as many\r\nin many years.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. M. Yonge. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he contributed a story to _Aunt Judy's Magazine_ called\r\n\"Bruno's Revenge,\" the charming little idyll out of which \"Sylvie and\r\nBruno\" grew. The creation of Bruno was the only act of homage Lewis\r\nCarroll ever paid to boy-nature, for which, as a rule, he professed an\r\naversion almost amounting to terror. Nevertheless, on the few\r\noccasions on which I have seen him in the company of boys, he seemed\r\nto be thoroughly at his ease, telling them stories and showing them\r\npuzzles.\r\n\r\nI give an extract from Mrs. Gatty's letter, acknowledging the receipt\r\nof \"Bruno's Revenge\" for her magazine:--\r\n\r\n    I need hardly tell you that the story is _delicious_.\r\n    It is beautiful and fantastic and childlike, and I cannot\r\n    sufficiently thank you. I am so _proud_ for _Aunt\r\n    Judy_ that you have honoured _her_ by sending it\r\n    here, rather than to the _Cornhill_, or one of the\r\n    grander Magazines.\r\n\r\n    To-morrow I shall send the Manuscript to London probably;\r\n    to-day I keep it to enjoy a little further, and that the\r\n    young ladies may do so too. One word more. Make this one of\r\n    a series. You may have great mathematical abilities, but so\r\n    have hundreds of others. This talent is peculiarly your own,\r\n    and as an Englishman you are almost unique in possessing it.\r\n    If you covet fame, therefore, it will be (I think) gained by\r\n    this. Some of the touches are so exquisite, one would have\r\n    thought nothing short of intercourse with fairies could have\r\n    put them into your head.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about this time he was invited to witness a rehearsal of a\r\nchildren's play at a London theatre. As he sat in the wings, chatting\r\nto the manager, a little four-year-old girl, one of the performers,\r\nclimbed up on his knee, and began talking to him. She was very anxious\r\nto be allowed to play the principal part (Mrs. Mite), which had been\r\nassigned to some other child. \"I wish I might act Mrs. Mite,\" she\r\nsaid; \"I know all her part, and I'd get an _encore_ for every\r\nword.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the year he published his book on \"Determinants.\" To those\r\naccustomed to regard mathematics as the driest of dry subjects, and\r\nmathematicians as necessarily devoid of humour, it seems scarcely\r\ncredible that \"An Elementary Treatise on Determinants,\" and \"Alice in\r\nWonderland\" were written by the same author, and it came quite as a\r\nrevelation to the undergraduate who heard for the first time that Mr.\r\nDodgson of Christ Church and Lewis Carroll were identical.\r\n\r\nThe book in question, admirable as it is in many ways, has not\r\ncommanded a large sale. The nature of the subject would be against it,\r\nas most students whose aim is to get as good a place as possible in\r\nthe class lists cannot afford the luxury of a separate work, and have\r\nto be content with the few chapters devoted to \"Determinants\" in works\r\non Higher Algebra or the Theory of Equations, supplemented by\r\nreferences to Mr. Dodgson's work which can be found in the College\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nThe general acceptance of the book would be rather restricted by the\r\nemployment of new words and symbols, which, as the author himself\r\nfelt, \"are always a most unwelcome addition to a science already\r\nburdened with an enormous vocabulary.\" But the work itself is largely\r\noriginal, and its arrangement and style are, perhaps, as attractive as\r\nthe nature of the subject will allow. Such a book as this has little\r\ninterest for the general reader, yet, amongst the leisured few who are\r\nable to read mathematics for their own sake, the treatise has found\r\nwarm admirers.\r\n\r\nIn the Summer Vacation of 1867 he went for a tour on the Continent,\r\naccompanied by Dr. Liddon, whom I have already mentioned as having\r\nbeen one of his most intimate friends at this time. During the whole\r\nof this tour Mr. Dodgson kept a diary, more with the idea that it\r\nwould help him afterwards to remember what he had seen than with any\r\nnotion of publication. However, in later years it did occur to him\r\nthat others might be interested in his impressions and experiences,\r\nthough he never actually took any steps towards putting them before\r\nthe public. Perhaps he was wise, for a traveller's diary always\r\ncontains much information that can be obtained just as well from any\r\nguide-book. In the extracts which I reproduce here, I hope that I have\r\nnot retained anything which comes under that category.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. Liddon. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\n    _July 12th_.--The Sultan and I arrived in London almost\r\n    at the same time, but in different quarters--_my_ point\r\n    of entry being Paddington, and _his_ Charing Cross. I\r\n    must admit that the crowd was greatest at the latter place.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson and Dr. Liddon met at Dover, and passed the night at one\r\nof the hotels there:--\r\n\r\n    _July 13th_.--We breakfasted, as agreed, at eight, or\r\n    at least we then sat down and nibbled bread and butter till\r\n    such time as the chops should be done, which great event\r\n    took place about half past. We tried pathetic appeals to the\r\n    wandering waiters, who told us, \"They are coming, sir,\" in a\r\n    soothing tone, and we tried stern remonstrance, and they\r\n    then said, \"They are coming, sir,\" in a more injured tone;\r\n    and after all such appeals they retired into their dens, and\r\n    hid themselves behind side-boards and dish-covers, and still\r\n    the chops came not. We agreed that of all virtues a waiter\r\n    can display, that of a retiring disposition is quite the\r\n    least desirable....\r\n\r\n    The pen refuses to describe the sufferings of some of the\r\n    passengers during our smooth trip of ninety minutes: my own\r\n    sensations were those of extreme surprise, and a little\r\n    indignation, at there being no other sensations--it was not\r\n    for _that_ I paid my money....\r\n\r\n    We landed at Calais in the usual swarm of friendly natives,\r\n    offering services and advice of all kinds; to all such\r\n    remarks I returned one simple answer, _Non!_ It was\r\n    probably not strictly applicable in all cases, but it\r\n    answered the purpose of getting rid of them; one by one they\r\n    left me, echoing the _Non_! in various tones, but all\r\n    expressive of disgust.\r\n\r\nAt Cologne began that feast of beautiful things which his artistic\r\ntemperament fitted him so well to enjoy. Though the churches he\r\nvisited and the ceremonies he witnessed belonged to a religious system\r\nwidely different from his own, the largeness and generosity of his\r\nmind always led him to insist upon that substratum of true\r\ndevotion--to use a favourite word of his--which underlies all forms of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n    We spent an hour in the cathedral, which I will not attempt\r\n    to describe further than by saying it was the most beautiful\r\n    of all churches I have ever seen or can imagine. If one\r\n    could imagine the spirit of devotion embodied in any\r\n    material form, it would be in such a building.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the wealth of words that has been expended upon German\r\nart, he found something new to say on this most fertile subject:--\r\n\r\n    The amount of art lavished on the whole region of Potsdam is\r\n    marvellous; some of the tops of the palaces were like\r\n    forests of statues, and they were all over the gardens, set\r\n    on pedestals. In fact, the two principles of Berlin\r\n    architecture appear to me to be these. On the house-tops,\r\n    wherever there is a convenient place, put up the figure of a\r\n    man; he is best placed standing on one leg. Wherever there\r\n    is room on the ground, put either a circular group of busts\r\n    on pedestals, in consultation, all looking inwards--or else\r\n    the colossal figure of a man killing, about to kill, or\r\n    having killed (the present tense is preferred) a beast; the\r\n    more pricks the beast has, the better--in fact a dragon is\r\n    the correct thing, but if that is beyond the artist, he may\r\n    content himself with a lion or a pig. The beast-killing\r\n    principle has been carried out everywhere with a relentless\r\n    monotony, which makes some parts of Berlin look like a\r\n    fossil slaughter-house.\r\n\r\nHe never missed an opportunity of studying the foreign drama, which\r\nwas most praiseworthy, as he knew very little German and not a word of\r\nRuss:--\r\n\r\n    At the hotel [at Danzig] was a green parrot on a stand; we\r\n    addressed it as \"Pretty Poll,\" and it put its head on one\r\n    side and thought about it, but wouldn't commit itself to any\r\n    statement. The waiter came up to inform us of the reason of\r\n    its silence: \"Er spricht nicht Englisch; er spricht nicht\r\n    Deutsch.\" It appeared that the unfortunate bird could speak\r\n    nothing but Mexican! Not knowing a word of that language, we\r\n    could only pity it.\r\n\r\n    _July 23rd._--We strolled about and bought a few\r\n    photographs, and at 11.39 left for Königsberg. On our way to\r\n    the station we came across the grandest instance of the\r\n    \"Majesty of Justice\" that I have ever witnessed. A little\r\n    boy was being taken to the magistrate, or to prison\r\n    (probably for picking a pocket). The achievement of this\r\n    feat had been entrusted to two soldiers in full uniform, who\r\n    were solemnly marching, one in front of the poor little\r\n    urchin and one behind, with bayonets fixed, of course, to be\r\n    ready to charge in case he should attempt an escape.\r\n\r\n    _July 25th._--In the evening I visited the theatre at\r\n    Königsberg, which was fairly good in every way, and very\r\n    good in the singing and some of the acting. The play was\r\n    \"Anno 66,\" but I could only catch a few words here and\r\n    there, so have very little idea of the plot. One of the\r\n    characters was a correspondent of an English newspaper. This\r\n    singular being came on in the midst of a soldiers' bivouac\r\n    before Sadowa, dressed very nearly in white--a very long\r\n    frock-coat, and a tall hat on the back of his head, both\r\n    nearly white. He said \"Morning\" as a general remark, when he\r\n    first came on, but afterwards talked what I suppose was\r\n    broken German. He appeared to be regarded as a butt by the\r\n    soldiers, and ended his career by falling into a drum.\r\n\r\nFrom Königsberg the travellers went on to St. Petersburg, where they\r\nstayed several days, exploring the wonderful city and its environs:--\r\n\r\n    There is a fine equestrian statue of Peter the Great near\r\n    the Admiralty. The lower part is not a pedestal, but left\r\n    shapeless and rough like a real rock. The horse is rearing,\r\n    and has a serpent coiled about its hind feet, on which, I\r\n    think, it is treading. If this had been put up in Berlin,\r\n    Peter would no doubt have been actively engaged in killing\r\n    the monster, but here he takes no notice of it; in fact, the\r\n    killing theory is not recognised. We found two colossal\r\n    figures of lions, which are so painfully mild that each of\r\n    them is rolling a great ball about like a kitten.\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 1st_.--About half-past ten Mr. Merrilies called\r\n    for us, and with really remarkable kindness gave up his day\r\n    to taking us down to Peterhof, a distance of about twenty\r\n    miles, and showing us over the place. We went by steamer\r\n    down the tideless, saltless Gulf of Finland; the first\r\n    peculiarity extends through the Baltic, and the second\r\n    through a great part of it. The piece we crossed, some\r\n    fifteen miles from shore to shore, is very shallow, in many\r\n    parts only six or eight feet deep, and every winter it is\r\n    entirely frozen over with ice two feet thick, and when this\r\n    is covered with snow it forms a secure plain, which is\r\n    regularly used for travelling on, though the immense\r\n    distance, without means of food or shelter, is dangerous for\r\n    poorly clad foot passengers. Mr. Merrilies told us of a\r\n    friend of his who, in crossing last winter, passed the\r\n    bodies of eight people who had been frozen. We had a good\r\n    view, on our way, of the coast of Finland, and of Kronstadt.\r\n    When we landed at Peterhof, we found Mr. Muir's carriage\r\n    waiting for us, and with its assistance, getting out every\r\n    now and then to walk through portions where it could not go,\r\n    we went over the grounds of two imperial palaces, including\r\n    many little summer-houses, each of which would make a very\r\n    good residence in itself, as, though small, they were fitted\r\n    up and adorned in every way that taste could suggest or\r\n    wealth achieve. For varied beauty and perfect combination of\r\n    nature and art, I think the gardens eclipse those of Sans\r\n    Souci. At every corner, or end of an avenue or path, where a\r\n    piece of statuary could be introduced with effect, there one\r\n    was sure to find one, in bronze or in white marble; many of\r\n    the latter had a sort of circular niche built behind, with a\r\n    blue background to throw the figure into relief. Here we\r\n    found a series of shelving ledges made of stone, with a\r\n    sheet of water gliding down over them; here a long path,\r\n    stretching down slopes and flights of steps, and arched over\r\n    all the way with trellises and creepers; here a huge\r\n    boulder, hewn, just as it lay, into the shape of a gigantic\r\n    head and face, with mild, sphinx-like eyes, as if some\r\n    buried Titan were struggling to free himself; here a\r\n    fountain, so artfully formed of pipes set in circles, each\r\n    set shooting the water higher than those outside, as to form\r\n    a solid pyramid of glittering spray; here a lawn, seen\r\n    through a break in the woods below us, with threads of\r\n    scarlet geraniums running over it, and looking in the\r\n    distance like a huge branch of coral; and here and there\r\n    long avenues of trees, lying in all directions, sometimes\r\n    three or four together side by side, and sometimes radiating\r\n    like a star, and stretching away into the distance till the\r\n    eye was almost weary of following them. All this will rather\r\n    serve to remind me, than to convey any idea, of what we saw.\r\n\r\nBut the beauties of Peterhof were quite eclipsed by the Oriental\r\nsplendours of Moscow, which naturally made a great impression upon a\r\nmind accustomed to the cold sublimity of Gothic architecture at\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n    We gave five or six hours to a stroll through this wonderful\r\n    city, a city of white houses and green roofs, of conical\r\n    towers that rise one out of another like a foreshortened\r\n    telescope; of bulging gilded domes, in which you see, as in\r\n    a looking-glass, distorted pictures of the city; of churches\r\n    which look, outside, like bunches of variegated cactus (some\r\n    branches crowned with green prickly buds, others with blue,\r\n    and others with red and white) and which, inside, are hung\r\n    all round with _eikons_ and lamps, and lined with\r\n    illuminated pictures up to the very roof; and, finally, of\r\n    pavement that goes up and down like a ploughed field, and\r\n    _drojky_-drivers who insist on being paid thirty per\r\n    cent. extra to-day, \"because it is the Empress's birthday.\"...\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 5th._--After dinner we went by arrangement to Mr.\r\n    Penny, and accompanied him to see a Russian wedding. It was\r\n    a most interesting ceremony. There was a large choir, from\r\n    the cathedral, who sang a long and beautiful anthem before\r\n    the service began; and the deacon (from the Church of the\r\n    Assumption) delivered several recitative portions of the\r\n    service in the most magnificent bass voice I ever heard,\r\n    rising gradually (I should say by less than half a note at a\r\n    time if that is possible), and increasing in volume of sound\r\n    as he rose in the scale, until his final note rang through\r\n    the building like a chorus of many voices. I could not have\r\n    conceived that one voice could have produced such an effect.\r\n    One part of the ceremony, the crowning the married couple,\r\n    was very nearly grotesque. Two gorgeous golden crowns were\r\n    brought in, which the officiating priest first waved before\r\n    them, and then placed on their heads--or rather the unhappy\r\n    bridegroom had to wear _his_, but the bride, having\r\n    prudently arranged her hair in a rather complicated manner\r\n    with a lace veil, could not have hers put on, but had it\r\n    held above her by a friend. The bridegroom, in plain evening\r\n    dress, crowned like a king, holding a candle, and with a\r\n    face of resigned misery, would have been pitiable if he had\r\n    not been so ludicrous. When the people had gone, we were\r\n    invited by the priests to see the east end of the church,\r\n    behind the golden gates, and were finally dismissed with a\r\n    hearty shake of the hand and the \"kiss of peace,\" of which\r\n    even I, though in lay costume, came in for a share.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of the tour was to see the fair at Nijni Novgorod,\r\nand here the travellers arrived on August 6th, after a miserable\r\nrailway journey. Owing to the breaking down of a bridge, the\r\nunfortunate passengers had been compelled to walk a mile through\r\ndrenching rain.\r\n\r\n     We went to the Smernovaya (or some such name) Hotel, a\r\n    truly villainous place, though no doubt the best in the\r\n    town. The feeding was very good, and everything else very\r\n    bad. It was some consolation to find that as we sat at\r\n    dinner we furnished a subject of the liveliest interest to\r\n    six or seven waiters, all dressed in white tunics, belted at\r\n    the waist, and white trousers, who ranged themselves in a\r\n    row and gazed in a quite absorbed way at the collection of\r\n    strange animals that were feeding before them. Now and then\r\n    a twinge of conscience would seize them that they were,\r\n    after all, not fulfilling the great object of life as\r\n    waiters, and on these occasions they would all hurry to the\r\n    end of the room, and refer to a great drawer which seemed to\r\n    contain nothing but spoons and corks. When we asked for\r\n    anything, they first looked at each other in an alarmed way;\r\n    then, when they had ascertained which understood the order\r\n    best, they all followed his example, which always was to\r\n    refer to the big drawer. We spent most of the afternoon\r\n    wandering through the fair, and buying _eikons_, &c. It\r\n    was a wonderful place. Besides there being distinct quarters\r\n    for the Persians, the Chinese, and others, we were\r\n    constantly meeting strange beings with unwholesome\r\n    complexions and unheard-of costumes. The Persians, with\r\n    their gentle, intelligent faces, the long eyes set wide\r\n    apart, the black hair, and yellow-brown skin, crowned with a\r\n    black woollen fez something like a grenadier, were about the\r\n    most picturesque we met. But all the novelties of the day\r\n    were thrown into the shade by our adventure at sunset, when\r\n    we came upon the Tartar mosque (the only one in Nijni)\r\n    exactly as one of the officials came out on the roof to\r\n    utter the muezzin cry, or call to prayers. Even if it had\r\n    been in no way singular in itself, it would have been deeply\r\n    interesting from its novelty and uniqueness, but the cry\r\n    itself was quite unlike anything I have ever heard before.\r\n    The beginning of each sentence was uttered in a rapid\r\n    monotone, and towards the end it rose gradually till it\r\n    ended in a prolonged, shrill wail, which floated overhead\r\n    through the still air with an indescribably sad and\r\n    ghostlike effect; heard at night, it would have thrilled one\r\n    like the cry of the Banshee.\r\n\r\nThis reminds one of the wonderful description in Mr. Kipling's \"City\r\nof Dreadful Night.\" It is not generally known that Mr. Dodgson was a\r\nfervent admirer of Mr. Kipling's works; indeed during the last few\r\nyears of his life I think he took more pleasure in his tales than in\r\nthose of any other modern author.\r\n\r\nDr. Liddon's fame as a preacher had reached the Russian clergy, with\r\nthe result that he and Mr. Dodgson found many doors open to them which\r\nare usually closed to travellers in Russia. After their visit to Nijni\r\nNovgorod they returned to Moscow, whence, escorted by Bishop Leonide,\r\nSuffragan Bishop of Moscow, they made an expedition to the Troitska\r\nMonastery.\r\n\r\n    _August 12th_.--A most interesting day. We breakfasted\r\n    at half-past five, and soon after seven left by railway, in\r\n    company with Bishop Leonide and Mr. Penny, for Troitska\r\n    Monastery. We found the Bishop, in spite of his limited\r\n    knowledge of English, a very conversational and entertaining\r\n    fellow-traveller. The service at the cathedral had already\r\n    begun when we reached it, and the Bishop took us in with\r\n    him, through a great crowd which thronged the building, into\r\n    a side room which opened into the chancel, where we remained\r\n    during the service, and enjoyed the unusual privilege of\r\n    seeing the clergy communicate--a ceremony for which the\r\n    doors of the chancel are always shut, and the curtains\r\n    drawn, so that the congregation never witness it. It was a\r\n    most elaborate ceremony, full of crossings, and waving of\r\n    incense before everything that was going to be used, but\r\n    also clearly full of much deep devotion.... In the afternoon\r\n    we went down to the Archbishop's palace, and were presented\r\n    to him by Bishop Leonide. The Archbishop could only talk\r\n    Russian, so that the conversation between him and Liddon (a\r\n    most interesting one, which lasted more than an hour) was\r\n    conducted in a very original fashion--the Archbishop making\r\n    a remark in Russian, which was put into English by the\r\n    Bishop; Liddon then answered the remark in French, and the\r\n    Bishop repeated his answer in Russian to the Archbishop. So\r\n    that a conversation, entirely carried on between two people,\r\n    required the use of three languages!\r\n\r\n    The Bishop had kindly got one of the theological students,\r\n    who could talk French, to conduct us about, which he did\r\n    most zealously, taking us, among other things, to see the\r\n    subterranean cells of the hermits, in which some of them\r\n    live for many years. We were shown the doors of two of the\r\n    inhabited ones; it was a strange and not quite comfortable\r\n    feeling, in a dark narrow passage where each had to carry a\r\n    candle, to be shown the low narrow door of a little cellar,\r\n    and to know that a human being was living within, with only\r\n    a small lamp to give him light, in solitude and silence day\r\n    and night.\r\n\r\nHis experiences with an exorbitant _drojky_-driver at St.\r\nPetersburg are worthy of record. They remind one of a story which he\r\nhimself used to tell as having happened to a friend of his at Oxford.\r\nThe latter had driven up in a cab to Tom Gate, and offered the cabman\r\nthe proper fare, which was, however, refused with scorn. After a long\r\naltercation he left the irate cabman to be brought to reason by the\r\nporter, a one-armed giant of prodigious strength. When he was leaving\r\ncollege, he stopped at the gate to ask the porter how he had managed\r\nto dispose of the cabman. \"Well, sir,\" replied that doughty champion,\r\n\"I could not persuade him to go until I floored him.\"\r\n\r\n     After a hearty breakfast I left Liddon to rest and write\r\n    letters, and went off shopping, &c., beginning with a call\r\n    on Mr. Muir at No. 61, Galerne Ulitsa. I took a\r\n    _drojky_ to the house, having first bargained with the\r\n    driver for thirty _kopecks_; he wanted forty to begin\r\n    with. When we got there we had a little scene, rather a\r\n    novelty in my experience of _drojky_-driving. The\r\n    driver began by saying \"_Sorok_\" (forty) as I got out;\r\n    this was a warning of the coming storm, but I took no notice\r\n    of it, but quietly handed over the thirty. He received them\r\n    with scorn and indignation, and holding them out in his open\r\n    hand, delivered an eloquent discourse in Russian, of which\r\n    _sorok_ was the leading idea. A woman, who stood by\r\n    with a look of amusement and curiosity, perhaps understood\r\n    him. _I_ didn't, but simply held out my hand for the\r\n    thirty, returned them to the purse and counted out\r\n    twenty-five instead. In doing this I felt something like a\r\n    man pulling the string of a shower-bath--and the effect was\r\n    like it--his fury boiled over directly, and quite eclipsed\r\n    all the former row. I told him in very bad Russian that I\r\n    had offered thirty once, but wouldn't again; but this, oddly\r\n    enough, did not pacify him. Mr. Muir's servant told him the\r\n    same thing at length, and finally Mr. Muir himself came out\r\n    and gave him the substance of it sharply and shortly--but he\r\n    failed to see it in a proper light. Some people are very\r\n    hard to please.\r\n\r\nWhen staying at a friend's house at Kronstadt he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    Liddon had surrendered his overcoat early in the day, and\r\n    when going we found it must be recovered from the\r\n    waiting-maid, who only talked Russian, and as I had left the\r\n    dictionary behind, and the little vocabulary did not contain\r\n    _coat_, we were in some difficulty. Liddon began by\r\n    exhibiting his coat, with much gesticulation, including the\r\n    taking it half-off. To our delight, she appeared to\r\n    understand at once--left the room, and returned in a minute\r\n    with--a large clothes-brush. On this Liddon tried a further\r\n    and more energetic demonstration; he took off his coat, and\r\n    laid it at her feet, pointed downwards (to intimate that in\r\n    the lower regions was the object of his desire), smiled with\r\n    an expression of the joy and gratitude with which he would\r\n    receive it, and put the coat on again. Once more a gleam of\r\n    intelligence lighted up the plain but expressive features of\r\n    the young person; she was absent much longer this time, and\r\n    when she returned, she brought, to our dismay, a large\r\n    cushion and a pillow, and began to prepare the sofa for the\r\n    nap that she now saw clearly was the thing the dumb\r\n    gentleman wanted. A happy thought occurred to me, and I\r\n    hastily drew a sketch representing Liddon, with one coat on,\r\n    receiving a second and larger one from the hands of a\r\n    benignant Russian peasant. The language of hieroglyphics\r\n    succeeded where all other means had failed, and we returned\r\n    to St. Petersburg with the humiliating knowledge that our\r\n    standard of civilisation was now reduced to the level of\r\n    ancient Nineveh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Instance of hieroglyphic writing of the date\r\nMDCCCLXVII--Interpretation. \"There is a coat here, left in the care of\r\na Russian peasant, which I should be glad to receive from him.\"]\r\n\r\nAt Warsaw they made a short stay, putting up at the Hotel\r\nd'Angleterre:--\r\n\r\n    Our passage is inhabited by a tall and very friendly\r\n    grey-hound, who walks in whenever the door is opened for a\r\n    second or two, and who for some time threatened to make the\r\n    labour of the servant, who was bringing water for a bath, of\r\n    no effect, by drinking up the water as fast as it was\r\n    brought.\r\n\r\nFrom Warsaw they went on to Leipzig, and thence to Giessen, where they\r\narrived on September 4th.\r\n\r\n    We moved on to Giessen, and put up at the \"Rappe Hotel\" for\r\n    the night, and ordered an early breakfast of an obliging\r\n    waiter who talked English. \"Coffee!\" he exclaimed\r\n    delightedly, catching at the word as if it were a really\r\n    original idea, \"Ah, coffee--very nice--and eggs? Ham with\r\n    your eggs? Very nice--\" \"If we can have it broiled,\" I said.\r\n    \"Boiled?\" the waiter repeated, with an incredulous smile.\r\n    \"No, not _boiled_,\" I explained--\"_broiled_.\" The\r\n    waiter put aside this distinction as trivial, \"Yes, yes,\r\n    ham,\" he repeated, reverting to his favourite idea. \"Yes,\r\n    ham,\" I said, \"but how cooked?\" \"Yes, yes, how cooked,\" the\r\n    waiter replied, with the careless air of one who assents to\r\n    a proposition more from good nature than from a real\r\n    conviction of its truth.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 5th_.--At midday we reached Ems, after a journey\r\n    eventless, but through a very interesting country--valleys\r\n    winding away in all directions among hills clothed with\r\n    trees to the very top, and white villages nestling away\r\n    wherever there was a comfortable corner to hide in. The\r\n    trees were so small, so uniform in colour, and so\r\n    continuous, that they gave to the more distant hills\r\n    something of the effect of banks covered with moss. The\r\n    really unique feature of the scenery was the way in which\r\n    the old castles seemed to grow, rather than to have been\r\n    built, on the tops of the rocky promontories that showed\r\n    their heads here and there among the trees. I have never\r\n    seen architecture that seemed so entirely in harmony with\r\n    the spirit of the place. By some subtle instinct the old\r\n    architects seem to have chosen both form and colour, the\r\n    grouping of the towers with their pointed spires, and the\r\n    two neutral tints, light grey and brown, on the walls and\r\n    roof, so as to produce buildings which look as naturally\r\n    fitted to the spot as the heath or the harebells. And, like\r\n    the flowers and the rocks, they seemed instinct with no\r\n    other meaning than rest and silence.\r\n\r\nAnd with these beautiful words my extracts from the Diary may well\r\nconclude. Lewis Carroll's mind was completely at one with Nature, and\r\nin her pleasant places of calm and infinite repose he sought his\r\nrest--and has found it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir John Tenniel. _From a photograph by\r\nBassano_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n(1868-1876)\r\n\r\n    Death of Archdeacon Dodgson--Lewis Carroll's rooms at Christ\r\n    Church--\"Phantasmagoria\"--Translations of \"Alice\"--\"Through\r\n    the Looking-Glass\"--\"Jabberwocky\" in Latin--C.S.\r\n    Calverley--\"Notes by an Oxford\r\n    Chiel\"--Hatfield--Vivisection--\"The Hunting of the Snark.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of \"Alice in Wonderland\" tempted Mr. Dodgson to make\r\nanother essay in the same field of literature. His idea had not yet\r\nbeen plagiarised, as it was afterwards, though the book had of course\r\nbeen parodied, a notable instance being \"Alice in Blunderland,\" which\r\nappeared in _Punch_. It was very different when he came to write\r\n\"Sylvie and Bruno\"; the countless imitations of the two \"Alice\" books\r\nwhich had been foisted upon the public forced him to strike out in a\r\nnew line. Long before the publication of his second tale, people had\r\nheard that Lewis Carroll was writing again, and the editor of a\r\nwell-known magazine had offered him two guineas a page, which was a\r\nhigh rate of pay in those days, for the story, if he would allow it to\r\nappear in serial form.\r\n\r\nThe central idea was, as every one knows, the adventures of a little\r\ngirl who had somehow or other got through a looking-glass. The first\r\ndifficulty, however, was to get her through, and this question\r\nexercised his ingenuity for some time, before it was satisfactorily\r\nsolved. The next thing was to secure Tenniel's services again. At\r\nfirst it seemed that he was to be disappointed in this matter; Tenniel\r\nwas so fully occupied with other work that there seemed little hope of\r\nhis being able to undertake any more. He then applied to Sir Noel\r\nPaton, with whose fairy-pictures he had fallen in love; but the artist\r\nwas ill, and wrote in reply, \"Tenniel is _the_ man.\" In the end\r\nTenniel consented to undertake the work, and once more author and\r\nartist settled down to work together. Mr. Dodgson was no easy man to\r\nwork with; no detail was too small for his exact criticism. \"Don't\r\ngive Alice so much crinoline,\" he would write, or \"The White Knight\r\nmust not have whiskers; he must not be made to look old\"--such were\r\nthe directions he was constantly giving.\r\n\r\nOn June 21st Archdeacon Dodgson died, after an illness of only a few\r\ndays' duration. Lewis Carroll was not summoned until too late, for the\r\nillness took a sudden turn for the worse, and he was unable to reach\r\nhis father's bedside before the end had come. This was a terrible\r\nshock to him; his father had been his ideal of what a Christian\r\ngentleman should be, and it seemed to him at first as if a cloud had\r\nsettled on his life which could never be dispelled. Two letters of\r\nhis, both of them written long after the sad event, give one some idea\r\nof the grief which his father's death, and all that it entailed,\r\ncaused him. The first was written long afterwards, to one who had\r\nsuffered a similar bereavement. In this letter he said:--\r\n\r\n    We are sufficiently old friends, I feel sure, for me to have\r\n    no fear that I shall seem intrusive in writing about your\r\n    great sorrow. The greatest blow that has ever fallen on\r\n    _my_ life was the death, nearly thirty years ago, of my\r\n    own dear father; so, in offering you my sincere sympathy, I\r\n    write as a fellow-sufferer. And I rejoice to know that we\r\n    are not only fellow-sufferers, but also fellow-believers in\r\n    the blessed hope of the resurrection from the dead, which\r\n    makes such a parting holy and beautiful, instead of being\r\n    merely a blank despair.\r\n\r\nThe second was written to a young friend, Miss Edith Rix, who had sent\r\nhim an illuminated text:\r\n\r\n    My dear Edith,--I can now tell you (what I wanted to do when\r\n    you sent me that text-card, but felt I could not say it to\r\n    _two_ listeners, as it were) _why_ that special\r\n    card is one I like to have. That text is consecrated for me\r\n    by the memory of one of the greatest sorrows I have\r\n    known--the death of my dear father. In those solemn days,\r\n    when we used to steal, one by one, into the darkened room,\r\n    to take yet another look at the dear calm face, and to pray\r\n    for strength, the one feature in the room that I remember\r\n    was a framed text, illuminated by one of my sisters, \"Then\r\n    are they glad, because they are at rest; and so he bringeth\r\n    them into the haven where they would be!\" That text will\r\n    always have, for me, a sadness and a sweetness of its own.\r\n    Thank you again for sending it me. Please don't mention this\r\n    when we meet. I can't _talk_ about it.\r\n\r\n    Always affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n    C. L. DODGSON.\r\n\r\nThe object of his edition of Euclid Book V., published during the\r\ncourse of the year, was to meet the requirements of the ordinary Pass\r\nExamination, and to present the subject in as short and simple a form\r\nas possible. Hence the Theory of Incommensurable Magnitudes was\r\nomitted, though, as the author himself said in the Preface, to do so\r\nrendered the work incomplete, and, from a logical point of view,\r\nvalueless. He hinted pretty plainly his own preference for an\r\nequivalent amount of Algebra, which would be complete in itself. It is\r\neasy to understand this preference in a mind so strictly logical as\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nSo far as the object of the book itself is concerned, he succeeded\r\nadmirably; the propositions are clearly and beautifully worked out,\r\nand the hints on proving Propositions in Euclid Book V., are most\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nIn November he again moved into new rooms at Christ Church; the suite\r\nwhich he occupied from this date to the end of his life was one of the\r\nbest in the College. Situated at the north-west corner of Tom Quad, on\r\nthe first floor of the staircase from the entrance to which the Junior\r\nCommon Room is now approached, they consist of four sitting-rooms and\r\nabout an equal number of bedrooms, besides rooms for lumber, &c. From\r\nthe upper floor one can easily reach the flat college roof. Mr.\r\nDodgson saw at once that here was the very place for a photographic\r\nstudio, and he lost no time in obtaining the consent of the\r\nauthorities to erect one. Here he took innumerable photographs of his\r\nfriends and their children, as indeed he had been doing for some time\r\nunder less favourable conditions. One of his earliest pictures is an\r\nexcellent likeness of Professor Faraday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prof. Faraday. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nHis study was characteristic of the man; oil paintings by A. Hughes,\r\nMrs. Anderson, and Heaphy proclaimed his artistic tastes; nests of\r\npigeon-holes, each neatly labelled, showed his love of order; shelves,\r\nfilled with the best books on every subject that interested him, were\r\nevidence of his wide reading. His library has now been broken up and,\r\nexcept for a few books retained by his nearest relatives, scattered to\r\nthe winds; such dispersions are inevitable, but they are none the less\r\nregrettable. It always seems to me that one of the saddest things\r\nabout the death of a literary man is the fact that the breaking-up of\r\nhis collection of books almost invariably follows; the building up of\r\na good library, the work of a lifetime, has been so much labour lost,\r\nso far as future generations are concerned. Talent, yes, and genius\r\ntoo, are displayed not only in writing books but also in buying them,\r\nand it is a pity that the ruthless hammer of the auctioneer should\r\nrender so much energy and skill fruitless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lewis Carroll's Study at Christ Church,\r\nOxford.]\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll's dining-room has been the scene of many a pleasant\r\nlittle party, for he was very fond of entertaining. In his Diary, each\r\nof the dinners and luncheons that he gave is recorded by a small\r\ndiagram, which shows who his guests were, and their several positions\r\nat the table. He kept a _menu_ book as well, that the same people\r\nmight not have the same dishes too frequently. He sometimes gave large\r\nparties, but his favourite form of social relaxation was a _dîner à\r\ndeux_.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1869 his \"Phantasmagoria,\" a collection of poems\r\ngrave and gay, was published by Macmillan. Upon the whole he was more\r\nsuccessful in humorous poetry, but there is an undeniable dignity and\r\npathos in his more serious verses. He gave a copy to Mr. Justice\r\nDenman, with whom he afterwards came to be very well acquainted, and\r\nwho appreciated the gift highly. \"I did not lay down the book,\" he\r\nwrote, \"until I had read them [the poems] through; and enjoyed many a\r\nhearty laugh, and something like a cry or two. Moreover, I hope to\r\nread them through (as the _old man_ said) 'again and again.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Justice Denman. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nIt had been Lewis Carroll's intention to have \"Phantasmagoria\"\r\nillustrated, and he had asked George du Maurier to undertake the work;\r\nbut the plan fell through. In his letter to du Maurier, Mr. Dodgson\r\nhad made some inquiries about Miss Florence Montgomery, the authoress\r\nof \"Misunderstood.\" In reply du Maurier said, \"Miss Florence\r\nMontgomery is a very charming and sympathetic young lady, the daughter\r\nof the admiral of that ilk. I am, like you, a very great admirer of\r\n\"Misunderstood,\" and cried pints over it. When I was doing the last\r\npicture I had to put a long white pipe in the little boy's mouth until\r\nit was finished, so as to get rid of the horrible pathos of the\r\nsituation while I was executing the work. In reading the book a second\r\ntime (knowing the sad end of the dear little boy), the funny parts\r\nmade me cry almost as much as the pathetic ones.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after the publication of \"Phantasmagoria,\" Lewis Carroll\r\nsent the first chapter of his new story to the press. \"Behind the\r\nLooking-Glass and what Alice saw there\" was his original idea for its\r\ntitle; it was Dr. Liddon who suggested the name finally adopted.\r\n\r\nDuring this year German and French translations of \"Alice in\r\nWonderland\" were published by Macmillan; the Italian edition appeared\r\nin 1872. Henri Bué, who was responsible for the French version, had no\r\neasy task to perform. In many cases the puns proved quite\r\nuntranslatable; while the poems, being parodies on well-known English\r\npieces, would have been pointless on the other side of the Channel.\r\nFor instance, the lines beginning, \"How doth the little crocodile\" are\r\na parody on \"How doth the little busy bee,\" a song which a French\r\nchild has, of course, never heard of. In this case Bué gave up the\r\nidea of translation altogether, and, instead, parodied La Fontaine's\r\n\"Maître Corbeau\" as follows:--\r\n\r\n        Maître Corbeau sur un arbre perché\r\n        Faisait son nid entre des branches;\r\n        Il avait relevé ses manches,\r\n        Car il était très affairé.\r\n        Maître Renard par là passant,\r\n        Lui dit: \"Descendez donc, compère;\r\n        Venez embrasser votre frère!\"\r\n        Le Corbeau, le reconnaissant,\r\n        Lui répondit en son ramage!--\r\n              \"Fromage.\"\r\n\r\nThe dialogue in which the joke occurs about \"tortoise\" and \"taught us\"\r\n(\"Wonderland,\" p. 142) is thus rendered:--\r\n\r\n    \"La maîtresse était une vieille tortue; nous l'appelions\r\n    chélonée.\" \"Et pourquoi l'appeliez-vous chélonée, si ce\r\n    n'était pas son nom?\" \"Parcequ'on ne pouvait s'empêcher de\r\n    s'écrier en la voyant: Quel long nez!\" dit la Fausse-Tortue\r\n    d'un ton fâché; \"vous êtes vraiment bien bornée!\"\r\n\r\nAt two points, however, both M. Bué and Miss Antonie Zimmermann, who\r\ntranslated the tale into German, were fairly beaten: the reason for\r\nthe whiting being so called, from its doing the boots and shoes, and\r\nfor no wise fish going anywhere without a porpoise, were given up as\r\nuntranslatable.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1870 Lord Salisbury came up to Oxford to be\r\ninstalled as Chancellor of the University. Dr. Liddon introduced Mr.\r\nDodgson to him, and thus began a very pleasant acquaintance. Of course\r\nhe photographed the Chancellor and his two sons, for he never missed\r\nan opportunity of getting distinguished people into his studio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Salisbury and his two sons. _From a\r\nphotograph by Lewis Carroll_.]\r\n\r\nIn December, seven \"Puzzles from Wonderland\" appeared in Mrs. Gatty's\r\npaper, _Aunt Judy's Magazine_. They had originally been written\r\nfor the Cecil children, with whom Lewis Carroll was already on the\r\nbest terms. Meanwhile \"Through the Looking-Glass\" was steadily\r\nprogressing--not, however, without many little hitches. One question\r\nwhich exercised Mr. Dodgson very much was whether the picture of the\r\nJabberwock would do as a frontispiece, or whether it would be too\r\nfrightening for little children. On this point he sought the advice of\r\nabout thirty of his married lady friends, whose experiences with their\r\nown children would make them trustworthy advisers; and in the end he\r\nchose the picture of the White Knight on horseback. In 1871 the book\r\nappeared, and was an instantaneous success. Eight thousand of the\r\nfirst edition had been taken up by the booksellers before Mr. Dodgson\r\nhad even received his own presentation copies. The compliments he\r\nreceived upon the \"Looking-Glass\" would have been enough to turn a\r\nlesser man's head, but he was, I think, proof against either praise or\r\nblame.\r\n\r\n    I can say with a clear head and conscience [wrote Henry\r\n    Kingsley] that your new book is the finest thing we have had\r\n    since \"Martin Chuzzlewit.\" ... I can only say, in comparing\r\n    the new \"Alice\" with the old, \"this is a more excellent song\r\n    than the other.\" It is perfectly splendid, but you have,\r\n    doubtless, heard that from other quarters. I lunch with\r\n    Macmillan habitually, and he was in a terrible pickle about\r\n    not having printed enough copies the other day.\r\n\r\nJabberwocky[017] was at once recognised as the best and most original\r\nthing in the book, though one fair correspondent of _The Queen_\r\ndeclared that it was a translation from the German! The late Dean of\r\nRochester, Dr. Scott, writes about it to Mr. Dodgson as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Are we to suppose, after all, that the Saga of Jabberwocky\r\n    is one of the universal heirlooms which the Aryan race at\r\n    its dispersion carried with it from the great cradle of the\r\n    family? You must really consult Max Müller about this. It\r\n    begins to be probable that the _origo originalissima_\r\n    may be discovered in Sanscrit, and that we shall by and by\r\n    have a _Iabrivokaveda_. The hero will turn out to be\r\n    the Sun-god in one of his _Avatars_; and the Tumtum\r\n    tree the great Ash _Ygdrasil_ of the Scandinavian\r\n    mythology.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1872, the late Mr. A.A. Vansittart, of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, translated the poem into Latin elegiacs. His rendering was\r\nprinted, for private circulation only, I believe, several years later,\r\nbut will probably be new to most of my readers. A careful comparison\r\nwith the original shows the wonderful fidelity of this translation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"MORS IABROCHII\"\r\n\r\n        Coesper[018] erat: tunc lubriciles[019] ultravia circum\r\n          Urgebant gyros gimbiculosque tophi;\r\n        Moestenui visae borogovides ire meatu;\r\n          Et profugi gemitus exgrabuêre rathae.\r\n\r\n        O fuge Iabrochium, sanguis meus![020] Ille recurvis\r\n          Unguibus, estque avidis dentibus ille minax.\r\n        Ububae fuge cautus avis vim, gnate!

The omitted chapter\r\nintroduced a wasp, in the character of a judge or barrister, I\r\nsuppose, since Mr. Tenniel wrote that \"a _wasp_ in a _wig_\r\nis altogether beyond the appliances of art.\" Apart from difficulties\r\nof illustration, the \"wasp\" chapter was not considered to be up to the\r\nlevel of the rest of the book, and this was probably the principal\r\nreason of its being left out.\r\n\r\n\"It is a curious fact,\" wrote Mr. Tenniel some years later, when\r\nreplying to a request of Lewis Carroll's that he would illustrate\r\nanother of his books, \"that with 'Through the Looking-Glass' the\r\nfaculty of making drawings for book illustration departed from me,\r\nand, notwithstanding all sorts of tempting inducements, I have done\r\nnothing in that direction since.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Facsimile of a letter from Sir John Tenniel\r\nto Lewis Carroll, June_ 1, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\"Through the Looking Glass\" has recently appeared in a solemn judgment\r\nof the House of Lords. In _Eastman Photographic Materials Company v.\r\nComptroller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks_ (1898),\r\nthe question for decision was, What constitutes an invented word? A\r\ntrademark that consists of or contains an invented word or words is\r\ncapable of registration. \"Solio\" was the word in issue in the case.\r\nLord Macnaghten in his judgment said, when alluding to the\r\ndistinguishing characteristics of an invented word:\r\n\r\n    I do not think that it is necessary that it should be wholly\r\n    meaningless. To give an illustration: your lordships may\r\n    remember that in a book of striking humour and fancy, which\r\n    was in everybody's hands when it was first published, there\r\n    is a collection of strange words where \"there are\" (to use\r\n    the language of the author) \"two meanings packed up into one\r\n    word.\" No one would say that those were not invented words.\r\n    Still they contain a meaning--a meaning is wrapped up in\r\n    them if you can only find it out.\r\n\r\nBefore I leave the subject of the \"Looking-Glass,\" I should like to\r\nmention one or two circumstances in connection with it which\r\nillustrate his reverence for sacred things. In his original manuscript\r\nthe bad-tempered flower (pp. 28-33) was the passion-flower; the sacred\r\norigin of the name never struck him, until it was pointed out to him\r\nby a friend, when he at once changed it into the tiger-lily. Another\r\nfriend asked him if the final scene was based upon the triumphal\r\nconclusion of \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" He repudiated the idea, saying\r\nthat he would consider such trespassing on holy ground as highly\r\nirreverent.\r\n\r\nHe seemed never to be satisfied with the amount of work he had on\r\nhand, and in 1872 he determined to add to his other labours by\r\nstudying anatomy and physiology. Professor Barclay Thompson supplied\r\nhim with a set of bones, and, having purchased the needful books, he\r\nset to work in good earnest. His mind was first turned to acquiring\r\nmedical knowledge by his happening to be at hand when a man was seized\r\nwith an epileptic fit. He had prevented the poor creature from\r\nfalling, but was utterly at a loss what to do next. To be better\r\nprepared on any future occasion, he bought a little manual called\r\n\"What to do in Emergencies.\" In later years he was constantly buying\r\nmedical and surgical works, and by the end of his life he had a\r\nlibrary of which no doctor need have been ashamed. There were only two\r\nspecial bequests in his will, one of some small keepsakes to his\r\nlandlady at Eastbourne, Mrs. Dyer, and the other of his medical books\r\nto my brother.\r\n\r\nWhenever a new idea presented itself to his mind he used to make a\r\nnote of it; he even invented a system by which he could take notes in\r\nthe dark, if some happy thought or ingenious problem suggested itself\r\nto him during a sleepless night. Like most men who systematically\r\novertax their brains, he was a poor sleeper. He would sometimes go\r\nthrough a whole book of Euclid in bed; he was so familiar with the\r\nbookwork that he could actually see the figures before him in the\r\ndark, and did not confuse the letters, which is perhaps even more\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nMost of his ideas were ingenious, though many were entirely useless\r\nfrom a practical point of view. For instance, he has an entry in his\r\nDiary on November 8, 1872: \"I wrote to Calverley, suggesting an idea\r\n(which I think occurred to me yesterday) of guessing well-known poems\r\nas acrostics, and making a collection of them to hoax the public.\"\r\nCalverley's reply to this letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    My dear Sir,--I have been laid up (or laid down) for the\r\n    last few days by acute lumbago, or I would have written\r\n    before. It is rather absurd that I was on the point of\r\n    propounding to you this identical idea. I realised, and I\r\n    regret to add revealed to two girls, a fortnight ago, the\r\n    truth that all existing poems were in fact acrostics; and I\r\n    offered a small pecuniary reward to whichever would find out\r\n    Gray's \"Elegy\" within half an hour! But it never occurred to\r\n    me to utilise the discovery, as it did to you. I see that it\r\n    might be utilised, now you mention it--and I shall instruct\r\n    these two young women not to publish the notion among their\r\n    friends.\r\n\r\nThis is the way Mr. Calverley treated Kirke White's poem \"To an early\r\nPrimrose.\" \"The title,\" writes C.S.C. \"might either be ignored or\r\nomitted. Possibly carpers might say that a primrose was not a rose.\"\r\n\r\n    Mild offspring of a dark and sullen sire!\r\n    Whose modest form, so delicately fine,                      Wild\r\n        Was nursed in whistling storms                          Rose\r\n        And cradled in the winds!\r\n\r\n    Thee, when young Spring first questioned Winter's sway,\r\n    And dared the sturdy blusterer to the fight,               W     a    R\r\n        Thee on this bank he threw\r\n        To mark his victory.\r\n\r\n    In this low vale, the promise of the year,\r\n    Serene thou openest to the nipping gale,\r\n        Unnoticed and alone                                    I  ncognit O\r\n        Thy tender elegance.\r\n\r\n    So Virtue blooms, brought forth amid the storms\r\n    Of chill adversity, in some lone walk\r\n        Of life she rears her head                             L owlines  S\r\n        Obscure and unobserved.\r\n\r\n    While every bleaching breeze that on her blows\r\n    Chastens her spotless purity of breast,\r\n        And hardens her to bear                                D isciplin E\r\n        Serene the ills of life.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their correspondence Mr. Calverley wrote a\r\nShakespearian sonnet, the initial letters of which form the name of\r\nWilliam Herbert; and a parody entitled \"The New Hat.\" I reproduce them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n        When o'er the world Night spreads her mantle dun,\r\n          In dreams, my love, I see those stars, thine eyes,\r\n        Lighting the dark: but when the royal sun\r\n          Looks o'er the pines and fires the orient skies,\r\n        I bask no longer in thy beauty's ray,\r\n          And lo! my world is bankrupt of delight.\r\n        Murk night seemed lately fair-complexioned day;\r\n          Hope-bringing day now seems most doleful night.\r\n        End, weary day, that art no day to me!\r\n          Return, fair night, to me the best of days!\r\n        But O my rose, whom in my dreams I see,\r\n          Enkindle with like bliss my waking gaze!\r\n        Replete with thee, e'en hideous night grows fair:\r\n        Then what would sweet morn be, if thou wert there?\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE NEW HAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n        My boots had been wash'd, well wash'd, by a shower;\r\n          But little I car'd about that:\r\n        What I felt was the havoc a single half-hour\r\n          Had made with my beautiful Hat.\r\n\r\n        For the Boot, tho' its lustre be dimm'd, shall assume\r\n          New comeliness after a while;\r\n        But no art may restore its original bloom,\r\n          When once it hath fled, to the Tile.\r\n\r\n        I clomb to my perch, and the horses (a bay\r\n          And a brown) trotted off with a clatter;\r\n        The driver look'd round in his humorous way,\r\n          And said huskily, \"Who is your hatter?\"\r\n\r\n        I was pleased that he'd noticed its shape and its shine;\r\n          And, as soon as we reached the \"Old Druid,\"\r\n        I begged him to drink to its welfare and mine\r\n          In a glass of my favourite fluid.\r\n\r\n        A gratified smile sat, I own, on my lips\r\n          When the barmaid exclaimed to the master,\r\n        (He was standing inside with his hands on his hips),\r\n          \"Just look at that gentleman's castor.\"\r\n\r\n        I laughed, when an organman paus'd in mid-air--\r\n          ('Twas an air that I happened to know,\r\n        By a great foreign _maestro_)--expressly to stare\r\n          At ze gent wiz _ze joli chapeau_.\r\n\r\n        Yet how swift is the transit from laughter to tears!\r\n          How rife with results is a day!\r\n        That Hat might, with care, have adorned me for years;\r\n          But one show'r wash'd its beauty away.\r\n\r\n        How I lov'd thee, my Bright One! I pluck in remorse\r\n          My hands from my pockets and wring 'em:\r\n        Oh, why did not I, dear, as a matter of course,\r\n          Ere I purchas'd thee purchase a gingham?\r\n\r\n        C.S. CALVERLEY.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson spent the last night of the old year (1872) at Hatfield,\r\nwhere he was the guest of Lord Salisbury. There was a large party of\r\nchildren in the house, one of them being Princess Alice, to whom he\r\ntold as much of the story of \"Sylvie and Bruno\" as he had then\r\ncomposed. While the tale was in progress Lady Salisbury entered the\r\nroom, bringing in some new toy or game to amuse her little guests,\r\nwho, with the usual thoughtlessness of children, all rushed off and\r\nleft Mr. Dodgson. But the little Princess, suddenly appearing to\r\nremember that to do so might perhaps hurt his feelings, sat down again\r\nby his side. He read the kind thought which prompted her action, and\r\nwas much pleased by it.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Dodgson knew several members of the _Punch_ staff, he used\r\nto send up any little incidents or remarks that particularly amused\r\nhim to that paper. He even went so far as to suggest subjects for\r\ncartoons, though I do not know if his ideas were ever carried out. One\r\nof the anecdotes he sent to _Punch_ was that of a little boy,\r\naged four, who after having listened with much attention to the story\r\nof Lot's wife, asked ingenuously, \"Where does salt come from that's\r\n_not_ made of ladies?\" This appeared on January 3, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe following is one of several such little anecdotes jotted down by\r\nLewis Carroll for future use: Dr. Paget was conducting a school\r\nexamination, and in the course of his questions he happened to ask a\r\nsmall child the meaning of \"Average.\" He was utterly bewildered by the\r\nreply, \"The thing that hens lay on,\" until the child explained that he\r\nhad read in a book that hens lay _on an average_ so many eggs a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAmong the notable people whom he photographed was John Ruskin, and, as\r\nseveral friends begged him for copies, he wrote to ask Mr. Ruskin's\r\nleave. The reply was, \"Buy Number 5 of _Fors Clavigera_ for 1871,\r\nwhich will give you your answer.\" This was not what Mr. Dodgson\r\nwanted, so he wrote back, \"Can't afford ten-pence!\" Finally Mr. Ruskin\r\ngave his consent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Ruskin. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time came the anonymous publication of \"Notes by an Oxford\r\nChiel,\" a collection of papers written on various occasions, and all\r\nof them dealing with Oxford controversies. Taking them in order, we\r\nhave first \"The New Method of Evaluation as applied to [_pi_],\"\r\nfirst published by Messrs. Parker in 1865, which had for its subject\r\nthe controversy about the Regius Professorship of Greek. One extract\r\nwill be sufficient to show the way in which the affair was treated:\r\n\"Let U = the University, G = Greek, and P = Professor. Then G P =\r\nGreek Professor; let this be reduced to its lowest terms and call the\r\nresult J [i.e., Jowett].\"\r\n\r\nThe second paper is called \"The Dynamics of a Parti-cle,\" and is quite\r\nthe best of the series; it is a geometrical treatment of the contest\r\nbetween Mr. Gathorne Hardy and Mr. Gladstone for the representation of\r\nthe University. Here are some of the \"Definitions\" with which the\r\nsubject was introduced:--\r\n\r\n    _Plain Superficiality_ is the character of a speech, in\r\n    which any two points being taken, the speaker is found to\r\n    lie wholly with regard to those two points.\r\n\r\n    _Plain Anger_ is the inclination of two voters to one\r\n    another, who meet together, but whose views are not in the\r\n    same direction.\r\n\r\n    When two parties, coming together, feel a Right Anger, each\r\n    is _said_ to be _complimentary_ to the other,\r\n    though, strictly speaking, this is very seldom the case.\r\n\r\n    _A surd_ is a radical whose meaning cannot be exactly\r\n    ascertained.\r\n\r\nAs the \"Notes of an Oxford Chiel\" has been long out of print, I will\r\ngive a few more extracts from this paper:--\r\n\r\n    _On Differentiation._\r\n\r\n    The effect of Differentiation on a Particle is very\r\n    remarkable, the first differential being frequently of\r\n    greater value than the original particle, and the second of\r\n    less enlightenment.\r\n\r\n    For example, let L = \"Leader\", S = \"Saturday\", and then LS =\r\n    \"Leader in the Saturday\" (a particle of no assignable\r\n    value). Differentiating once, we get L.S.D., a function of\r\n    great value. Similarly it will be found that, by taking the\r\n    second Differential of an enlightened Particle (_i.e.,_\r\n    raising it to the Degree D.D.), the enlightenment becomes\r\n    rapidly less. The effect is much increased by the addition\r\n    of a C: in this case the enlightenment often vanishes\r\n    altogether, and the Particle becomes Conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\n    PROP.

There was also a letter to\r\nthe Senior Censor of Christ Church, in burlesque of a similar letter\r\nin which the Professor of Physics met an offer of the Clarendon\r\nTrustees by a detailed enumeration of the requirements in his own\r\ndepartment of Natural Science. Mr. Dodgson's letter deals with the\r\nimaginary requirements of the Mathematical school:--\r\n\r\n    Dear Senior Censor,--In a desultory conversation on a point\r\n    connected with the dinner at our high table, you\r\n    incidentally remarked to me that lobster-sauce, \"though a\r\n    necessary adjunct to turbot, was not entirely wholesome!\"\r\n\r\n    It is entirely unwholesome. I never ask for it without\r\n    reluctance: I never take a second spoonful without a feeling\r\n    of apprehension on the subject of a possible nightmare. This\r\n    naturally brings me to the subject of Mathematics, and of\r\n    the accommodation provided by the University for carrying on\r\n    the calculations necessary in that important branch of\r\n    Science.\r\n\r\n    As Members of Convocation are called upon (whether\r\n    personally, or, as is less exasperating, by letter) to\r\n    consider the offer of the Clarendon Trustees, as well as\r\n    every other subject of human, or inhuman, interest, capable\r\n    of consideration, it has occurred to me to suggest for your\r\n    consideration how desirable roofed buildings are for\r\n    carrying on mathematical calculations: in fact, the variable\r\n    character of the weather in Oxford renders it highly\r\n    inexpedient to attempt much occupation, of a sedentary\r\n    nature, in the open air.\r\n\r\n    Again, it is often impossible for students to carry on\r\n    accurate mathematical calculations in close contiguity to\r\n    one another, owing to their mutual conversation;\r\n    consequently these processes require different rooms in\r\n    which irrepressible conversationalists, who are found to\r\n    occur in every branch of Society, might be carefully and\r\n    permanently fixed.\r\n\r\n    It may be sufficient for the present to enumerate the\r\n    following requisites--others might be added as funds\r\n    permit:--\r\n\r\n    A. A very large room for calculating Greatest Common\r\n    Measure. To this a small one might be attached for Least\r\n    Common Multiple: this, however, might be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n    B. A piece of open ground for keeping Roots and practising\r\n    their extraction: it would be advisable to keep Square Roots\r\n    by themselves, as their corners are apt to damage others.\r\n\r\n    C. A room for reducing Fractions to their Lowest Terms. This\r\n    should be provided with a cellar for keeping the Lowest\r\n    Terms when found, which might also be available to the\r\n    general body of Undergraduates, for the purpose of \"keeping\r\n    Terms.\"\r\n\r\n    D. A large room, which might be darkened, and fitted up with\r\n    a magic lantern, for the purpose of exhibiting circulating\r\n    Decimals in the act of circulation. This might also contain\r\n    cupboards, fitted with glass doors, for keeping the various\r\n    Scales of Notation.\r\n\r\n    E. A narrow strip of ground, railed off and carefully\r\n    levelled, for investigating the properties of Asymptotes,\r\n    and testing practically whether Parallel Lines meet or not:\r\n    for this purpose it should reach, to use the expressive\r\n    language of Euclid, \"ever so far.\"\r\n\r\n    This last process of \"continually producing the lines,\" may\r\n    require centuries or more; but such a period, though long in\r\n    the life of an individual, is as nothing in the life of the\r\n    University.\r\n\r\n    As Photography is now very much employed in recording human\r\n    expressions, and might possibly be adapted to Algebraical\r\n    Expressions, a small photographic room would be desirable,\r\n    both for general use and for representing the various\r\n    phenomena of Gravity, Disturbance of Equilibrium,\r\n    Resolution, &c., which affect the features during severe\r\n    mathematical operations.\r\n\r\n    May I trust that you will give your immediate attention to\r\n    this most important subject?\r\n\r\n    Believe me,\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    Mathematicus.\r\n\r\nNext came \"The New Belfry of Christ Church, Oxford; a Monograph by\r\nD.C.L.\" On the title-page was a neatly drawn square--the figure of\r\nEuclid I. 46--below which was written \"East view of the New Belfry,\r\nChrist Church, as seen from the meadow.\" The new belfry is fortunately a\r\nthing of the past, and its insolent hideousness no longer defaces Christ\r\nChurch, but while it lasted it was no doubt an excellent target for\r\nLewis Carroll's sarcasm. His article on it is divided into thirteen\r\nchapters. Three of them are perhaps worth quoting:--\r\n\r\n    §1. _On the etymological significance of the new Belfry, Ch. Ch_.\r\n\r\n    The word \"Belfry\" is derived from the French _bel_, \"beautiful,\r\n    becoming, meet,\" and from the German _frei_, \"free unfettered,\r\n    secure, safe.\" Thus, the word is strictly equivalent to \"meat-safe,\"\r\n    to which the new Belfry bears a resemblance so perfect as almost to\r\n    amount to coincidence.\r\n\r\n    §4. _On the chief architectural merit of the new Belfry, Ch. Ch_.\r\n\r\n    Its chief merit is its simplicity--a simplicity so pure, so\r\n    profound, in a word, so _simple_, that no other word will fitly\r\n    describe it. The meagre outline, and baldness of detail, of the\r\n    present Chapter, are adopted in humble imitation of this great\r\n    feature.\r\n\r\n    §5. _On the other architectural merits of the new Belfry, Ch. Ch_.\r\n\r\n    The Belfry has no other architectural merits.\r\n\r\n\"The Vision of the Three T's\" followed. It also was an attack on\r\narchitectural changes in Christ Church; the general style was a parody\r\nof the \"Compleat Angler.\" Last of all came \"The Blank Cheque, a\r\nFable,\" in reference to the building of the New Schools, for the\r\nexpenses of which it was actually proposed (in 1874), to sign a blank\r\ncheque before any estimate had been made, or any plan laid before the\r\nUniversity, and even before a committee had been elected to appoint an\r\narchitect for the work.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1874 Mr. Dodgson was again at Hatfield, where he told\r\nthe children the story of Prince Uggug, which was afterwards made a\r\npart of \"Sylvie and Bruno,\" though at that time it seems to have been\r\na separate tale. But \"Sylvie and Bruno,\" in this respect entirely\r\nunlike \"Alice in Wonderland,\" was the result of notes taken during\r\nmany years; for while he was thinking out the book he never neglected\r\nany amusing scraps of childish conversation or funny anecdotes about\r\nchildren which came to his notice. It is this fact which gives such\r\nverisimilitude to the prattle of Bruno; childish talk is a thing which\r\na grown-up person cannot possibly _invent_. He can only listen to\r\nthe actual things the children say, and then combine what he has heard\r\ninto a connected narrative.\r\n\r\nDuring 1875 Mr. Dodgson wrote an article on \"Some Popular Fallacies\r\nabout Vivisection,\" which was refused by the _Pall Mall Gazette_,\r\nthe editor saying that he had never heard of most of them; on which\r\nMr. Dodgson plaintively notes in his Diary that seven out of the\r\nthirteen fallacies dealt with in his essay had appeared in the columns\r\nof the _Pall Mall Gazette_. Ultimately it was accepted by the\r\neditor of _The Fortnightly Review_. Mr. Dodgson had a peculiar\r\nhorror of vivisection. I was once walking in Oxford with him when a\r\ncertain well-known professor passed us. \"I am afraid that man\r\nvivisects,\" he said, in his gravest tone. Every year he used to get a\r\nfriend to recommend him a list of suitable charities to which he\r\nshould subscribe. Once the name of some Lost Dogs' Home appeared in\r\nthis list. Before Mr. Dodgson sent his guinea he wrote to the\r\nsecretary to ask whether the manager of the Home was in the habit of\r\nsending dogs that had to be killed to physiological laboratories for\r\nvivisection. The answer was in the negative, so the institution got\r\nthe cheque. He did not, however, advocate the total abolition of\r\nvivisection--what reasonable man could?--but he would have liked to\r\nsee it much more carefully restricted by law. An earlier letter of his\r\nto the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the same subject is sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic to deserve a place here. Be it noted that he signed it\r\n\"Lewis Carroll,\" in order that whatever influence or power his\r\nwritings had gained him might tell in the controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VIVISECTION AS A SIGN OF THE TIMES.\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of the \"Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\n    Sir,--The letter which appeared in last week's\r\n    _Spectator_, and which must have saddened the heart of\r\n    every one who read it, seems to suggest a question which has\r\n    not yet been asked or answered with sufficient clearness,\r\n    and that is, How far may vivisection be regarded as a sign\r\n    of the times, and a fair specimen of that higher\r\n    civilisation which a purely secular State education is to\r\n    give us? In that much-vaunted panacea for all human ills we\r\n    are promised not only increase of knowledge, but also a\r\n    higher moral character; any momentary doubt on this point\r\n    which we may feel is set at rest at once by quoting the\r\n    great crucial instance of Germany. The syllogism, if it\r\n    deserves the name, is usually stated thus: Germany has a\r\n    higher scientific education than England; Germany has a\r\n    lower average of crime than England; _ergo_, a\r\n    scientific education tends to improve moral conduct. Some\r\n    old-fashioned logician might perhaps whisper to himself,\r\n    \"Praemissis particularibus nihil probatur,\" but such a\r\n    remark, now that Aldrich is out of date, would only excite a\r\n    pitying smile. May we, then, regard the practice of\r\n    vivisection as a legitimate fruit, or as an abnormal\r\n    development, of this higher moral character? Is the\r\n    anatomist, who can contemplate unmoved the agonies he is\r\n    inflicting for no higher purpose than to gratify a\r\n    scientific curiosity, or to illustrate some well-established\r\n    truth, a being higher or lower, in the scale of humanity,\r\n    than the ignorant boor whose very soul would sicken at the\r\n    horrid sight? For if ever there was an argument in favour of\r\n    purely scientific education more cogent than another, it is\r\n    surely this (a few years back it might have been put into\r\n    the mouth of any advocate of science; now it reads like the\r\n    merest mockery): \"What can teach the noble quality of mercy,\r\n    of sensitiveness to all forms of suffering, so powerfully as\r\n    the knowledge of what suffering really is? Can the man who\r\n    has once realised by minute study what the nerves are, what\r\n    the brain is, and what waves of agony the one can convey to\r\n    the other, go forth and wantonly inflict pain on any\r\n    sentient being?\" A little while ago we should have\r\n    confidently replied, \"He cannot do it\"; in the light of\r\n    modern revelations we must sorrowfully confess \"He can.\" And\r\n    let it never be said that this is done with serious\r\n    forethought of the balance of pain and gain; that the\r\n    operator has pleaded with himself, \"Pain is indeed an evil,\r\n    but so much suffering may fitly be endured to purchase so\r\n    much knowledge.\" When I hear of one of these ardent\r\n    searchers after truth giving, not a helpless dumb animal, to\r\n    whom he says in effect, \"_You_ shall suffer that\r\n    _I_ may know,\" but his own person to the probe and to\r\n    the scalpel, I will believe in him as recognising a\r\n    principle of justice, and I will honour him as acting up to\r\n    his principles. \"But the thing cannot be!\" cries some\r\n    amiable reader, fresh from an interview with that most\r\n    charming of men, a London physician. \"What! Is it possible\r\n    that one so gentle in manner, so full of noble sentiments,\r\n    can be hardhearted? The very idea is an outrage to common\r\n    sense!\" And thus we are duped every day of our lives. Is it\r\n    possible that that bank director, with his broad honest\r\n    face, can be meditating a fraud? That the chairman of that\r\n    meeting of shareholders, whose every tone has the ring of\r\n    truth in it, can hold in his hand a \"cooked\" schedule of\r\n    accounts? That my wine merchant, so outspoken, so confiding,\r\n    can be supplying me with an adulterated article? That the\r\n    schoolmaster, to whom I have entrusted my little boy, can\r\n    starve or neglect him? How well I remember his words to the\r\n    dear child when last we parted. \"You are leaving your\r\n    friends,\" he said, \"but you will have a father in me, my\r\n    dear, and a mother in Mrs. Squeers!\" For all such\r\n    rose-coloured dreams of the necessary immunity from human\r\n    vices of educated men the facts in last week's\r\n    _Spectator_ have a terrible significance. \"Trust no man\r\n    further than you can see him,\" they seem to say. \"Qui vult\r\n    decipi, decipiatur.\"\r\n\r\n    Allow me to quote from a modern writer a few sentences\r\n    bearing on this subject:--\r\n\r\n      \"We are at present, legislature and nation together,\r\n      eagerly pushing forward schemes which proceed on the\r\n      postulate that conduct is determined, not by feelings, but\r\n      by cognitions. For what else is the assumption underlying\r\n      this anxious urging-on of organisations for teaching? What\r\n      is the root-notion common to Secularists and\r\n      Denominationalists but the notion that spread of knowledge\r\n      is the one thing needful for bettering behaviour? Having\r\n      both swallowed certain statistical fallacies, there has\r\n      grown up in them the belief that State education will\r\n      check ill-doing.... This belief in the moralising effects\r\n      of intellectual culture, flatly contradicted by facts, is\r\n      absurd _a priori_.... This faith in lesson-books and\r\n      readings is one of the superstitions of the age.... Not by\r\n      precept, though heard daily; not by example, unless it is\r\n      followed; but only by action, often caused by the related\r\n      feeling, can a moral habit be formed. And yet this truth,\r\n      which mental science clearly teaches, and which is in\r\n      harmony with familiar sayings, is a truth wholly ignored\r\n      in current educational fanaticisms.\"\r\n\r\n    There need no praises of mine to commend to the\r\n    consideration of all thoughtful readers these words of\r\n    Herbert Spencer. They are to be found in \"The Study of\r\n    Sociology\" (pp. 36l-367).\r\n\r\n    Let us, however, do justice to science. It is not so wholly\r\n    wanting as Mr. Herbert Spencer would have us believe in\r\n    principles of action--principles by which we may regulate\r\n    our conduct in life. I myself once heard an accomplished man\r\n    of science declare that his labours had taught him one\r\n    special personal lesson which, above all others, he had laid\r\n    to heart. A minute study of the nervous system, and of the\r\n    various forms of pain produced by wounds had inspired in him\r\n    one profound resolution; and that was--what think\r\n    you?--never, under any circumstances, to adventure his own\r\n    person into the field of battle! I have somewhere read in a\r\n    book--a rather antiquated book, I fear, and one much\r\n    discredited by modern lights--the words, \"the whole creation\r\n    groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.\" Truly\r\n    we read these words with a new meaning in the present day!\r\n    \"Groan and travail\" it undoubtedly does still (more than\r\n    ever, so far as the brute creation is concerned); but to\r\n    what end? Some higher and more glorious state? So one might\r\n    have said a few years back. Not so in these days. The\r\n    _telos teleion_ of secular education, when divorced\r\n    from religious or moral training, is--I say it\r\n    deliberately--the purest and most unmitigated selfishness.\r\n    The world has seen and tired of the worship of Nature, of\r\n    Reason, of Humanity; for this nineteenth century has been\r\n    reserved the development of the most refined religion of\r\n    all--the worship of Self. For that, indeed, is the upshot of\r\n    it all. The enslavement of his weaker brethren--\"the labour\r\n    of those who do not enjoy, for the enjoyment of those who do\r\n    not labour\"--the degradation of woman--the torture of the\r\n    animal world--these are the steps of the ladder by which man\r\n    is ascending to his higher civilisation. Selfishness is the\r\n    key-note of all purely secular education; and I take\r\n    vivisection to be a glaring, a wholly unmistakable case in\r\n    point. And let it not be thought that this is an evil that\r\n    we can hope to see produce the good for which we are asked\r\n    to tolerate it, and then pass away. It is one that tends\r\n    continually to spread. And if it be tolerated or even\r\n    ignored now, the age of universal education, when the\r\n    sciences, and anatomy among them, shall be the heritage of\r\n    all, will be heralded by a cry of anguish from the brute\r\n    creation that will ring through the length and breadth of\r\n    the land! This, then, is the glorious future to which the\r\n    advocate of secular education may look forward: the dawn\r\n    that gilds the horizon of his hopes! An age when all forms\r\n    of religious thought shall be things of the past; when\r\n    chemistry and biology shall be the ABC of a State education\r\n    enforced on all; when vivisection shall be practised in\r\n    every college and school; and when the man of science,\r\n    looking forth over a world which will then own no other sway\r\n    than his, shall exult in the thought that he has made of\r\n    this fair green earth, if not a heaven for man, at least a\r\n    hell for animals.\r\n\r\n    I am, sir,\r\n\r\n    Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\n    _February 10th_.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 1876, \"The Hunting of the Snark\" was published. Mr.\r\nDodgson gives some interesting particulars of its evolution. The first\r\nidea for the poem was the line \"For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you\r\nsee,\" which came into his mind, apparently without any cause, while he\r\nwas taking a country walk. The first complete verse which he composed\r\nwas the one which stands last in the poem:--\r\n\r\n        In the midst of the word he was trying to say,\r\n          In the midst of his laughter and glee,\r\n        He had softly and suddenly vanished away--\r\n          For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you see.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations were the work of Mr. Henry Holiday, and they are\r\nthoroughly in keeping with the spirit of the poem. Many people have\r\ntried to show that \"The Hunting of the Snark\" was an allegory; some\r\nregarding it as being a burlesque upon the Tichborne case, and others\r\ntaking the Snark as a personification of popularity. Lewis Carroll\r\nalways protested that the poem had no meaning at all.\r\n\r\n    As to the meaning of the Snark [he wrote to a friend in\r\n    America], I'm very much afraid I didn't mean anything but\r\n    nonsense. Still, you know, words mean more than we mean to\r\n    express when we use them; so a whole book ought to mean a\r\n    great deal more than the writer means. So, whatever good\r\n    meanings are in the book, I'm glad to accept as the meaning\r\n    of the book. The best that I've seen is by a lady (she\r\n    published it in a letter to a newspaper), that the whole\r\n    book is an allegory on the search after happiness. I think\r\n    this fits in beautifully in many ways--particularly about\r\n    the bathing-machines: when the people get weary of life, and\r\n    can't find happiness in towns or in books, then they rush\r\n    off to the seaside, to see what bathing-machines will do for\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry Holiday in his Studio. _From a\r\nphotograph_.]\r\n\r\nMr. H. Holiday, in a very interesting article on \"The Snark's\r\nSignificance\" (_Academy,_ January 29, 1898), quoted the\r\ninscription which Mr. Dodgson had written in a vellum-bound,\r\npresentation-copy of the book. It is so characteristic that I take the\r\nliberty of reproducing it here:--\r\n\r\n    Presented to Henry Holiday, most patient of artists, by\r\n    Charles L. Dodgson, most exacting, but not most ungrateful\r\n    of authors, March 29, 1876.\r\n\r\nA little girl, to whom Mr. Dodgson had given a copy of the \"Snark,\"\r\nmanaged to get the whole poem off by heart, and insisted on reciting,\r\nit from beginning to end during a long carriage-drive. Her friends,\r\nwho, from the nature of the case, were unable to escape, no doubt\r\nwished that she, too, was a Boojum.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, the first public dramatic representation of \"Alice in\r\nWonderland\" was given at the Polytechnic, the entertainment taking the\r\nform of a series of _tableaux_, interspersed with appropriate\r\nreadings and songs. Mr. Dodgson exercised a rigid censorship over all\r\nthe extraneous matter introduced into the performance, and put his\r\nveto upon a verse in one of the songs, in which the drowning of\r\nkittens was treated from the humorous point of view, lest the children\r\nin the audience might learn to think lightly of death in the case of\r\nthe lower animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lewis Carroll. _From a photograph_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n(1877-1883)\r\n\r\n    Dramatic tastes--Miss Ellen Terry--\"Natural Science at\r\n    Oxford\"--Mr. Dodgson as an artist--Miss E. G. Thomson--The\r\n    drawing of children--A curious dream--\"The Deserted\r\n    Parks\"--\"Syzygies\"--Circus children--Row-loving\r\n    undergraduates--A letter to _The Observer_--Resignation\r\n    of the Lectureship--He is elected Curator of the Common\r\n    Room--Dream-music.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson's love of the drama was not, as I have shown, a taste\r\nwhich he acquired in later years. From early college days he never\r\nmissed anything which he considered worth seeing at the London\r\ntheatres. I believe he used to reproach himself--unfairly, I\r\nthink--with spending too much time on such recreations. For a man who\r\nworked so hard and so incessantly as he did; for a man to whom\r\nvacations meant rather a variation of mental employment than absolute\r\nrest of mind, the drama afforded just the sort of relief that was\r\nwanted. His vivid imagination, the very earnestness and intensity of\r\nhis character enabled him to throw himself utterly into the spirit of\r\nwhat he saw upon the stage, and to forget in it all the petty worries\r\nand disappointments of life. The old adage says that a man cannot burn\r\nthe candle at both ends; like most proverbs, it is only partially\r\ntrue, for often the hardest worker is the man who enters with most\r\nzest into his recreations, and this was emphatically the case with Mr.\r\nDodgson.\r\n\r\nWalter Pater, in his book on the Renaissance, says (I quote from rough\r\nnotes only), \"A counted number of pulses only is given to us of a\r\nvariegated dramatic life. How may we see in them all that is to be\r\nseen in them by the finest senses? How shall we pass most swiftly from\r\npoint to point, and be present always at the focus where the greatest\r\nnumber of vital forces unite in their purest energy? To burn always\r\nwith this hard gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in\r\nlife.\" Here we have the truer philosophy, here we have the secret of\r\nLewis Carroll's life. He never wasted time on social formalities; he\r\nrefused to fulfil any of those (so called) duties which involve\r\nineffable boredom, and so his mind was always fresh and ready. He said\r\nin one of his letters that he hoped that in the next world all\r\nknowledge would not be given to us suddenly, but that we should\r\ngradually grow wiser, for the _acquiring_ knowledge was to him\r\nthe real pleasure. What is this but a paraphrase of another of Pater's\r\nthoughts, \"Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself is the\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, times without number, he allowed himself to be carried away by\r\nemotion as he saw life in the mirror of the stage; but, best of all,\r\nhe loved to see the acting of children, and he generally gave copies\r\nof his books to any of the little performers who specially pleased\r\nhim. On January 13, 1877, he wrote in his Diary:--\r\n\r\n    Went up to town for the day, and took E-- with me to the\r\n    afternoon pantomime at the Adelphi, \"Goody Two-Shoes,\" acted\r\n    entirely by children. It was a really charming performance.\r\n    Little Bertie Coote, aged ten, was clown--a wonderfully\r\n    clever little fellow; and Carrie Coote, about eight, was\r\n    Columbine, a very pretty graceful little thing. In a few\r\n    years' time she will be just _the_ child to act\r\n    \"Alice,\" if it is ever dramatised. The harlequin was a\r\n    little girl named Gilchrist, one of the most beautiful\r\n    children, in face and figure, that I have ever seen. I must\r\n    get an opportunity of photographing her. Little Bertie\r\n    Coote, singing \"Hot Codlings,\" was curiously like the\r\n    pictures of Grimaldi.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the little girl was Miss Constance\r\nGilchrist. Mr. Dodgson sent her a copy of \"Alice in Wonderland,\" with\r\na set of verses on her name.\r\n\r\nMany people object altogether to children appearing on the stage; it\r\nis said to be bad for their morals as well as for their health. A\r\nletter which Mr. Dodgson once wrote in the _St. James's Gazette_\r\ncontains a sufficient refutation of the latter fancy:--\r\n\r\n    I spent yesterday afternoon at Brighton, where for five\r\n    hours I enjoyed the society of three exceedingly happy and\r\n    healthy little girls, aged twelve, ten, and seven. I think\r\n    that any one who could have seen the vigour of life in those\r\n    three children--the intensity with which they enjoyed\r\n    everything, great or small, that came in their way--who\r\n    could have watched the younger two running races on the\r\n    Pier, or have heard the fervent exclamation of the eldest at\r\n    the end of the afternoon, \"We _have_ enjoyed\r\n    ourselves!\" would have agreed with me that here, at least,\r\n    there was no excessive \"physical strain,\" nor any\r\n    _imminent_ danger of \"fatal results\"! A drama, written\r\n    by Mr. Savile Clarke, is now being played at Brighton, and\r\n    in this (it is called \"Alice in Wonderland\") all three\r\n    children have been engaged. They had been acting every night\r\n    this week, and _twice_ on the day before I met them,\r\n    the second performance lasting till half-past ten at night,\r\n    after which they got up at seven next morning to bathe! That\r\n    such (apparently) severe work should co-exist with blooming\r\n    health and buoyant spirits seems at first sight a paradox;\r\n    but I appeal to any one who has ever worked _con amore_\r\n    at any subject whatever to support me in the assertion that,\r\n    when you really love the subject you are working at, the\r\n    \"physical strain\" is absolutely _nil_; it is only when\r\n    working \"against the grain\" that any strain is felt, and I\r\n    believe the apparent paradox is to be explained by the fact\r\n    that a taste for _acting_ is one of the strongest\r\n    passions of human nature, that stage-children show it nearly\r\n    from infancy, and that, instead of being miserable drudges\r\n    who ought to be celebrated in a new \"Cry of the Children,\"\r\n    they simply _rejoice_ in their work \"even as a giant\r\n    rejoiceth to run his course.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson's general views on the mission of the drama are well shown\r\nby an extract from a circular which he sent to many of his friends in\r\n1882:--\r\n\r\n    The stage (as every playgoer can testify) is an engine of\r\n    incalculable power for influencing society; and every effort\r\n    to purify and ennoble its aims seems to me to deserve all\r\n    the countenance that the great, and all the material help\r\n    that the wealthy, can give it; while even those who are\r\n    neither great nor wealthy may yet do their part, and help\r\n    to--\r\n      \"Ring out the darkness of the land,\r\n       Ring in the Christ that is to be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ellen Terry. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nI do not know if Mr. Dodgson's suggested amendment of some lines in\r\nthe \"Merchant of Venice\" was ever carried out, but it further\r\nillustrates the serious view he took of this subject. The hint occurs\r\nin a letter to Miss Ellen Terry, which runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    You gave me a treat on Saturday such as I have very seldom\r\n    had in my life. You must be weary by this time of hearing\r\n    your own praises, so I will only say that Portia was all I\r\n    could have imagined, and more. And Shylock is\r\n    superb--especially in the trial-scene.\r\n\r\n    Now I am going to be very bold, and make a suggestion, which\r\n    I do hope you will think well enough of to lay it before Mr.\r\n    Irving. I want to see that clause omitted (in the sentence\r\n    on Shylock)--\r\n\r\n                     That, for this favour,\r\n        He presently become a Christian;\r\n\r\n    It is a sentiment that is entirely horrible and revolting to\r\n    the feelings of all who believe in the Gospel of Love. Why\r\n    should our ears be shocked by such words merely because they\r\n    are Shakespeare's? In his day, when it was held to be a\r\n    Christian's duty to force his belief on others by fire and\r\n    sword--to burn man's body in order to save his soul--the\r\n    words probably conveyed no shock. To all Christians now\r\n    (except perhaps extreme Calvinists) the idea of forcing a\r\n    man to abjure his religion, whatever that religion may be,\r\n    is (as I have said) simply horrible.\r\n\r\n    I have spoken of it as a needless outrage on religious\r\n    feeling: but surely, being so, it is a great artistic\r\n    mistake. Its tendency is directly contrary to the spirit of\r\n    the scene. We have despised Shylock for his avarice, and we\r\n    rejoice to see him lose his wealth: we have abhorred him for\r\n    his bloodthirsty cruelty, and we rejoice to see him baffled.\r\n    And now, in the very fulness of our joy at the triumph of\r\n    right over wrong, we are suddenly called on to see in him\r\n    the victim of a cruelty a thousand times worse than his own,\r\n    and to honour him as a martyr. This, I am sure, Shakespeare\r\n    never meant. Two touches only of sympathy does he allow us,\r\n    that we may realise him as a man, and not as a demon\r\n    incarnate. \"I will not pray with you\"; \"I had it of Leah,\r\n    when I was a bachelor.\" But I am sure he never meant our\r\n    sympathies to be roused in the supreme moment of his\r\n    downfall, and, if he were alive now, I believe he would cut\r\n    out those lines about becoming a Christian.\r\n\r\n    No interpolation is needed--(I should not like to suggest\r\n    the putting in a single word that is not Shakespeare's)--I\r\n    would read the speech thus:--\r\n\r\n             That lately stole his daughter:\r\n        Provided that he do record a gift,\r\n        Here in the court, &c.\r\n\r\n    And I would omit Gratiano's three lines at Shylock's exit,\r\n    and let the text stand:--\r\n\r\n        _Duke_: \"Get thee gone, but do it.\" (_Exit\r\n        Shylock_.)\r\n\r\n    The exit, in solemn silence, would be, if possible, even\r\n    grander than it now is, and would lose nothing by the\r\n    omission of Gratiano's flippant jest....\r\n\r\nOn January 16th he saw \"New Men and Old Acres\" at the Court Theatre.\r\nThe two authors of the pieces, Dubourg and Tom Taylor, were great\r\nfriends of his. \"It was a real treat,\" he writes, \"being well acted in\r\nevery detail. Ellen Terry was wonderful, and I should think\r\nunsurpassable in all but the lighter parts.\" Mr. Dodgson himself had a\r\nstrong wish to become a dramatic author, but, after one or two\r\nunsuccessful attempts to get his plays produced, he wisely gave up the\r\nidea, realising that he had not the necessary constructive powers. The\r\nabove reference to Miss Ellen Terry's acting is only one out of a\r\ncountless number; the great actress and he were excellent friends, and\r\nshe did him many a kindness in helping on young friends of his who had\r\ntaken up the stage as a profession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Taylor. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nShe and her sister, Miss Kate Terry, were among the distinguished\r\npeople whom he photographed. The first time he saw the latter actress\r\nwas, I think, in 1858, when she was playing in \"The Tempest\" at the\r\nPrincess's. \"The gem of the piece,\" he writes, \"was the exquisitely\r\ngraceful and beautiful Ariel, Miss Kate Terry. Her appearance as a\r\nsea-nymph was one of the most beautiful living pictures I ever saw,\r\nbut this, and every other one in my recollection (except Queen\r\nKatherine's dream), were all outdone by the concluding scene, where\r\nAriel is left alone, hovering over the wide ocean, watching the\r\nretreating ship. It is an innovation on Shakespeare, but a worthy one,\r\nand the conception of a true poet.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kate Terry. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll_.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson was a frequent contributor to the daily Press. As a rule\r\nhis letters appeared in the _St. James's Gazette_, for the\r\neditor, Mr. Greenwood, was a friend of his, but the following\r\nsarcastic epistle was an exception:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    NATURAL SCIENCE AT OXFORD.\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of the \"Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\n    Sir,--There is no one of the many ingenious appliances of\r\n    mechanical science that is more appreciated or more\r\n    successfully employed than the wedge; so subtle and\r\n    imperceptible are the forces needed for the insertion of its\r\n    \"thin end,\" so astounding the results which its \"thick end\"\r\n    may ultimately produce. Of the former process we shall see a\r\n    beautiful illustration in a Congregation to be holden at\r\n    Oxford on the 24th inst., when it will be proposed to grant,\r\n    to those who have taken the degrees of bachelor and master\r\n    in Natural Science only, the same voting powers as in the\r\n    case of the \"M.A.\" degree. This means the omission of one of\r\n    the two classical languages, Latin and Greek, from what has\r\n    been hitherto understood as the curriculum of an Oxford\r\n    education. It is to this \"thin end\" of the wedge that I\r\n    would call the attention of our non-residents, and of all\r\n    interested in Oxford education, while the \"thick end\" is\r\n    still looming in the distance. But why fear a \"thick end\" at\r\n    all? I shall be asked. Has Natural Science shown any such\r\n    tendency, or given any reason to fear that such a concession\r\n    would lead to further demands? In answer to that question,\r\n    let me sketch, in dramatic fashion, the history of her\r\n    recent career in Oxford. In the dark ages of our University\r\n    (some five-and-twenty years ago), while we still believed in\r\n    classics and mathematics as constituting a liberal\r\n    education, Natural Science sat weeping at our gates. \"Ah,\r\n    let me in!\" she moaned; \"why cram reluctant youth with your\r\n    unsatisfying lore? Are they not hungering for bones; yea,\r\n    panting for sulphuretted hydrogen?\" We heard and we pitied.\r\n    We let her in and housed her royally; we adorned her palace\r\n    with re-agents and retorts, and made it a very charnel-house\r\n    of bones, and we cried to our undergraduates, \"The feast of\r\n    Science is spread! Eat, drink, and be happy!\" But they would\r\n    not. They fingered the bones, and thought them dry. They\r\n    sniffed at the hydrogen, and turned away. Yet for all that\r\n    Science ceased not to cry, \"More gold, more gold!\" And her\r\n    three fair daughters, Chemistry, Biology, and Physics (for\r\n    the modern horse-leech is more prolific than in the days of\r\n    Solomon), ceased not to plead, \"Give, give!\" And we gave; we\r\n    poured forth our wealth like water (I beg her pardon, like\r\n    H{_2}O), and we could not help thinking there was something\r\n    weird and uncanny in the ghoul-like facility with which she\r\n    absorbed it.\r\n\r\n    The curtain rises on the second act of the drama. Science is\r\n    still weeping, but this time it is for lack of pupils, not\r\n    of teachers or machinery. \"We are unfairly handicapped!\" she\r\n    cries. \"You have prizes and scholarships for classics and\r\n    mathematics, and you bribe your best students to desert us.\r\n    Buy us some bright, clever boys to teach, and then see what\r\n    we can do!\" Once more we heard and pitied. We had bought her\r\n    bones; we bought her boys. And now at last her halls were\r\n    filled--not only with teachers paid to teach, but also with\r\n    learners paid to learn. And we have not much to complain of\r\n    in results, except that perhaps she is a little too ready to\r\n    return on our hands all but the \"honour-men\"--all, in fact,\r\n    who really need the helping hand of an educator. \"Here, take\r\n    back your stupid ones!\" she cries. \"Except as subjects for\r\n    the scalpel (and we have not yet got the Human Vivisection\r\n    Act through Parliament) we can do nothing with them!\"\r\n\r\n    The third act of the drama is yet under rehearsal; the\r\n    actors are still running in and out of the green-room, and\r\n    hastily shuffling on their new and ill-fitting dresses; but\r\n    its general scope is not far to seek. At no distant day our\r\n    once timid and tearful guest will be turning up her nose at\r\n    the fare provided for her. \"Give me no more youths to\r\n    teach,\" she will say; \"but pay me handsomely, and let me\r\n    think. Plato and Aristotle were all very well in their way;\r\n    Diogenes and his tub for me!\" The allusion is not\r\n    inappropriate. There can be little doubt that some of the\r\n    researches conducted by that retiring philosopher in the\r\n    recesses of that humble edifice were strictly scientific,\r\n    embracing several distinct branches of entomology. I do not\r\n    mean, of course, that \"research\" is a new idea in Oxford.\r\n    From time immemorial we have had our own chosen band of\r\n    researchers (here called \"professors\"), who have advanced\r\n    the boundaries of human knowledge in many directions. True,\r\n    they are not left so wholly to themselves as some of these\r\n    modern thinkers would wish to be, but are expected to give\r\n    some few lectures, as the outcome of their \"research\" and\r\n    the evidence of its reality, but even that condition has not\r\n    always been enforced--for instance, in the case of the late\r\n    Professor of Greek, Dr. Gaisford, the University was too\r\n    conscious of the really valuable work he was doing in\r\n    philological research to complain that he ignored the usual\r\n    duties of the chair and delivered no lectures.\r\n\r\n    And, now, what is the \"thick end\" of the wedge? It is that\r\n    Latin and Greek may _both_ vanish from our curriculum;\r\n    that logic, philosophy, and history may follow; and that the\r\n    destinies of Oxford may some day be in the hands of those\r\n    who have had no education other than \"scientific.\" And why\r\n    not? I shall be asked. Is it not as high a form of education\r\n    as any other? That is a matter to be settled by facts. I can\r\n    but offer my own little item of evidence, and leave it to\r\n    others to confirm or to refute. It used once to be thought\r\n    indispensable for an educated man that he should be able to\r\n    write his own language correctly, if not elegantly; it seems\r\n    doubtful how much longer this will be taken as a criterion.\r\n    Not so many years ago I had the honour of assisting in\r\n    correcting for the press some pages of the\r\n    _Anthropological Review_, or some such periodical. I\r\n    doubt not that the writers were eminent men in their own\r\n    line; that each could triumphantly prove, to his own\r\n    satisfaction, the unsoundness of what the others had\r\n    advanced; and that all would unite in declaring that the\r\n    theories of a year ago were entirely exploded by the latest\r\n    German treatise; but they were not able to set forth these\r\n    thoughts, however consoling in themselves, in anything\r\n    resembling the language of educated society. In all my\r\n    experience, I have never read, even in the \"local news\" of\r\n    a country paper, such slipshod, such deplorable English.\r\n\r\n    I shall be told that I am ungenerous in thus picking out a\r\n    few unfavourable cases, and that some of the greatest minds\r\n    of the day are to be found in the ranks of science. I freely\r\n    admit that such may be found, but my contention is that\r\n    _they_ made the science, not the science them; and that\r\n    in any line of thought they would have been equally\r\n    distinguished. As a general principle, I do not think that\r\n    the exclusive study of any _one_ subject is really\r\n    education; and my experience as a teacher has shown me that\r\n    even a considerable proficiency in Natural Science, taken\r\n    alone, is so far from proving a high degree of cultivation\r\n    and great natural ability that it is fully compatible with\r\n    general ignorance and an intellect quite below par.\r\n    Therefore it is that I seek to rouse an interest, beyond the\r\n    limits of Oxford, in preserving classics as an essential\r\n    feature of a University education. Nor is it as a classical\r\n    tutor (who might be suspected of a bias in favour of his own\r\n    subject) that I write this. On the contrary, it is as one\r\n    who has taught science here for more than twenty years (for\r\n    mathematics, though good-humouredly scorned by the\r\n    biologists on account of the abnormal certainty of its\r\n    conclusions, is still reckoned among the sciences) that I\r\n    beg to sign myself,--Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    Charles L. Dodgson,\r\n\r\n    _Mathematical Lecturer of Christ Church, Oxford.\r\n\r\n    May 17th._\r\n\r\nI give the above letter because I think it amusing; it must not be\r\nsupposed that the writer's views on the subject remained the same all\r\nthrough his life. He was a thorough Conservative, and it took a long\r\ntime to reconcile him to any new departure. In a political discussion\r\nwith a friend he once said that he was \"first an Englishman, and then\r\na Conservative,\" but however much a man may try to put patriotism\r\nbefore party, the result will be but partially successful, if\r\npatriotism would lead him into opposition to the mental bias which has\r\noriginally made him either a Conservative or a Radical.\r\n\r\nHe took, of course, great pleasure in the success of his books, as\r\nevery author must; but the greatest pleasure of all to him was to know\r\nthat they had pleased others. Notes like the following are frequent in\r\nhis Diary: \"_June_ 25_th_.--Spent the afternoon in sending\r\noff seventy circulars to Hospitals, offering copies of 'Alice' and the\r\n'Looking-Glass' for sick children.\" He well deserved the name which\r\none of his admirers gave him--\"The man who loved little children.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1878, he saw a performance of \"Olivia\" at the Court Theatre.\r\n\"The gem of the piece is Olivia herself, acted by Ellen Terry with a\r\nsweetness and pathos that moved some of the audience (nearly including\r\nmyself) to tears. Her leave-taking was exquisite; and when, in her\r\nexile, she hears that her little brother had cried at the mention of\r\nher name, her exclamation 'Pet!' was tenderness itself. Altogether, I\r\nhave not had a greater dramatic treat for a long time. _Dies cretâ\r\nnotandus_.\"\r\n\r\nI see that I have marked for quotation the following brief entries in\r\nthe Diary:--\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 4th_ (at Eastbourne).--Went, morning and\r\n    evening, to the new chapel-of-ease belonging to S.\r\n    Saviour's. It has the immense advantage of _not_ being\r\n    crowded; but this scarcely compensates for the vile\r\n    Gregorian chants, which vex and weary one's ear.\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 17th_.--A very inquisitive person, who had some\r\n    children with her, found out my name, and then asked me to\r\n    shake hands with her child, as an admirer of my books: this\r\n    I did, unwisely perhaps, as I have no intention of\r\n    continuing the acquaintance of a \"Mrs. Leo Hunter.\"\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 23rd_.--I have been making a plan for work next\r\n    term, of this kind: Choose a subject (_e.g._,\r\n    \"Circulation,\" \"Journeys of S. Paul,\" \"English Counties\")\r\n    for each week. On Monday write what I know about it; during\r\n    week get up subject; on Saturday write again; put the two\r\n    papers away, and six months afterwards write again and\r\n    compare.\r\n\r\nAs an artist, Mr. Dodgson possessed an intense natural appreciation of\r\nthe beautiful, an abhorrence of all that is coarse and unseemly which\r\nmight almost be called hyper-refinement, a wonderfully good eye for\r\nform, and last, but not least, the most scrupulous conscientiousness\r\nabout detail. On the other hand his sense of colour was somewhat\r\nimperfect, and his hand was almost totally untrained, so that while he\r\nhad all the enthusiasm of the true artist, his work always had the\r\ndefects of an amateur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miss E. Gertrude Thomson.]\r\n\r\nIn 1878 some drawings of Miss E. Gertrude Thomson's excited his keen\r\nadmiration, and he exerted himself to make her acquaintance. Their\r\nfirst meeting is described so well by Miss Thomson herself in _The\r\nGentlewoman_ for January 29, 1898, that I cannot do better than\r\nquote the description of the scene as given there:--\r\n\r\n    It was at the end of December, 1878, that a letter, written\r\n    in a singularly legible and rather boyish-looking hand, came\r\n    to me from Christ Church, Oxford, signed \"C. L. Dodgson.\"\r\n    The writer said that he had come across some fairy designs\r\n    of mine, and he should like to see some more of my work. By\r\n    the same post came a letter from my London publisher (who\r\n    had supplied my address) telling me that the \"Rev. C. L.\r\n    Dodgson\" was \"Lewis Carroll.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Alice in Wonderland\" had long been one of my pet books, and\r\n    as one regards a favourite author as almost a personal\r\n    friend, I felt less restraint than one usually feels in\r\n    writing to a stranger, though I carefully concealed my\r\n    knowledge of his identity, as he had not chosen to reveal\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    This was the beginning of a frequent and delightful\r\n    correspondence, and as I confessed to a great love for fairy\r\n    lore of every description, he asked me if I would accept a\r\n    child's fairy-tale book he had written, called \"Alice in\r\n    Wonderland.\" I replied that I knew it nearly all off by\r\n    heart, but that I should greatly prize a copy given to me by\r\n    himself. By return came \"Alice,\" and \"Through the\r\n    Looking-Glass,\" bound most luxuriously in white calf and\r\n    gold.\r\n\r\n    And this is the graceful and kindly note that came with\r\n    them: \"I am now sending you 'Alice,' and the 'Looking-Glass'\r\n    as well. There is an incompleteness about giving only one,\r\n    and besides, the one you bought was probably in red and\r\n    would not match these. If you are at all in doubt as to what\r\n    to do with the (now) superfluous copy, let me suggest your\r\n    giving it to some poor sick child. I have been distributing\r\n    copies to all the hospitals and convalescent homes I can\r\n    hear of, where there are sick children capable of reading\r\n    them, and though, of course, one takes some pleasure in the\r\n    popularity of the books elsewhere, it is not nearly so\r\n    pleasant a thought to me as that they may be a comfort and\r\n    relief to children in hours of pain and weariness. Still, no\r\n    recipient _can_ be more appropriate than one who seems\r\n    to have been in fairyland herself, and to have seen, like\r\n    the 'weary mariners' of old--\r\n\r\n        'Between the green brink and the running foam\r\n        White limbs unrobed in a crystal air,\r\n        Sweet faces, rounded arms, and bosoms prest\r\n        To little harps of gold.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"Do you ever come to London?\" he asked in another letter;\r\n    \"if so, will you allow me to call upon you?\"\r\n\r\n    Early in the summer I came up to study, and I sent him word\r\n    that I was in town. One night, coming into my room, after a\r\n    long day spent at the British Museum, in the half-light I\r\n    saw a card lying on the table. \"Rev. C. L. Dodgson.\" Bitter,\r\n    indeed, was my disappointment at having missed him, but just\r\n    as I was laying it sadly down I spied a small T.O. in the\r\n    corner. On the back I read that he couldn't get up to my\r\n    rooms early or late enough to find me, so would I arrange to\r\n    meet him at some museum or gallery the day but one\r\n    following? I fixed on South Kensington Museum, by the\r\n    \"Schliemann\" collection, at twelve o'clock.\r\n\r\n    A little before twelve I was at the rendezvous, and then the\r\n    humour of the situation suddenly struck me, that _I_\r\n    had not the ghost of an idea what _he_ was like, nor\r\n    would _he_ have any better chance of discovering\r\n    _me!_ The room was fairly full of all sorts and\r\n    conditions, as usual, and I glanced at each masculine figure\r\n    in turn, only to reject it as a possibility of the one I\r\n    sought. Just as the big clock had clanged out twelve, I\r\n    heard the high vivacious voices and laughter of children\r\n    sounding down the corridor.\r\n\r\n    At that moment a gentleman entered, two little girls\r\n    clinging to his hands, and as I caught sight of the tall\r\n    slim figure, with the clean-shaven, delicate, refined face,\r\n    I said to myself, \"_That's_ Lewis Carroll.\" He stood\r\n    for a moment, head erect, glancing swiftly over the room,\r\n    then, bending down, whispered something to one of the\r\n    children; she, after a moment's pause, pointed straight at\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    Dropping their hands he came forward, and with that winning\r\n    smile of his that utterly banished the oppressive sense of\r\n    the Oxford don, said simply, \"I am Mr. Dodgson; I was to\r\n    meet you, I think?\" To which I as frankly smiled, and said,\r\n    \"How did you know me so soon?\"\r\n\r\n    \"My little friend found you. I told her I had come to meet a\r\n    young lady who knew fairies, and she fixed on you at once.\r\n    But _I_ knew you before she spoke.\"\r\n\r\nThis acquaintance ripened into a true, artistic friendship, which\r\nlasted till Mr. Dodgson's death. In his first letter to Miss Thomson\r\nhe speaks of himself as one who for twenty years had found his one\r\namusement in photographing from life--especially photographing\r\nchildren; he also said that he had made attempts (\"most\r\nunsuccessfully\") at drawing them. When he got to know her more\r\nintimately, he asked her to criticise his work, and when she wrote\r\nexpressing her willingness to do so, he sent her a pile of\r\nsketch-books, through which she went most carefully, marking the\r\nmistakes, and criticising, wherever criticism seemed to be necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter this he might often have been seen in her studio, lying flat on\r\nhis face, and drawing some child-model who had been engaged for his\r\nespecial benefit. \"I _love_ the effort to draw,\" he wrote in one\r\nof his letters to her, \"but I utterly fail to please even my own\r\neye--tho' now and then I seem to get somewhere _near_ a right\r\nline or two, when I have a live child to draw from. But I have no time\r\nleft now for such things. In the next life, I do _hope_ we shall\r\nnot only _see_ lovely forms, such as this world does not contain,\r\nbut also be able to _draw_ them.\"\r\n\r\nBut while he fully recognised the limits of his powers, he had great\r\nfaith in his own critical judgment; and with good reason, for his\r\nperception of the beautiful in contour and attitude and grouping was\r\nalmost unerring. All the drawings which Miss Thomson made for his\r\n\"Three Sunsets\" were submitted to his criticism, which descended to\r\nthe smallest details. He concludes a letter to her, which contained\r\nthe most elaborate and minute suggestions for the improvement of one\r\nof these pictures, with the following words: \"I make all these\r\nsuggestions with diffidence, feeling that I have _really no_\r\nright at all, as an amateur, to criticise the work of a real artist.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from another letter to Miss Thomson shows that\r\nseeking after perfection, that discontent with everything short of the\r\nbest, which was so marked a feature of his character. She had sent him\r\ntwo drawings of the head of some child-friend of his:--\r\n\r\n    Your note is a puzzle--you say that \"No. 2 would have been\r\n    still more like if the paper had been exactly the same\r\n    shade--but I'd no more at hand of the darker colour.\" Had I\r\n    given you the impression that I was in a _hurry_, and\r\n    was willing to have No. 2 _less_ good than it\r\n    _might_ be made, so long as I could have it\r\n    _quick?_ If I did, I'm very sorry: I never _meant_\r\n    to say a word like it: and, if you had written \"I could make\r\n    it still more like, on darker paper; but I've no more at\r\n    hand. How long can you wait for me to get some?\" I should\r\n    have replied, \"Six weeks, or six _months_, if you\r\n    prefer it!\"\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of his love of nature, as opposed to the\r\nadmiration for the morbid and abnormal. \"I want you,\" he writes to\r\nMiss Thomson, \"to do my fairy drawings from _life_. They would be\r\nvery pretty, no doubt, done out of your own head, but they will be ten\r\ntimes as valuable if done from life. Mr. Furniss drew the pictures of\r\n'Sylvie' from life. Mr. Tenniel is the only artist, who has drawn for\r\nme, who resolutely refused to use a model, and declared he no more\r\nneeded one than I should need a multiplication-table to work a\r\nmathematical problem!\" On another occasion he urges the importance of\r\nusing models, in order to avoid the similarity of features which would\r\notherwise spoil the pictures: \"Cruikshank's splendid illustrations\r\nwere terribly spoiled by his having only _one_ pretty female face\r\nin them all. Leech settled down into _two_ female faces. Du\r\nMaurier, I think, has only _one_, now. All the ladies, and all\r\nthe little girls in his pictures look like twin sisters.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that Sir Noel Paton and Mr. Walter Crane\r\nwere, in Lewis Carroll's opinion, the most successful drawers of\r\nchildren: \"There are but few artists who seem to draw the forms of\r\nchildren _con amore_. Walter Crane is perhaps the best (always\r\nexcepting Sir Noel Paton): but the thick outlines, which he insists on\r\nusing, seem to take off a good deal from the beauty of the result.\"\r\n\r\nHe held that no artist can hope to effect a higher type of beauty than\r\nthat which life itself exhibits, as the following words show:--\r\n\r\n    I don't quite understand about fairies losing \"grace,\" if\r\n    too like human children. Of course I grant that to be like\r\n    some _actual_ child is to lose grace, because no living\r\n    child is perfect in form: many causes have lowered the race\r\n    from what God made it. But the _perfect_ human form,\r\n    free from these faults, is surely equally applicable to men,\r\n    and fairies, and angels? Perhaps that is what you mean--that\r\n    the Artist can imagine, and design, more perfect forms than\r\n    we ever find in life?\r\n\r\nI have already referred several times to Miss Ellen Terry as having\r\nbeen one of Mr. Dodgson's friends, but he was intimate with the whole\r\nfamily, and used often to pay them a visit when he was in town. On May\r\n15, 1879, he records a very curious dream which he had about Miss\r\nMarion (\"Polly\") Terry:--\r\n\r\n    Last night I had a dream which I record as a curiosity, so\r\n    far as I know, in the literature of dreams. I was staying,\r\n    with my sisters, in some suburb of London, and had heard\r\n    that the Terrys were staying near us, so went to call, and\r\n    found Mrs. Terry at home, who told us that Marion and\r\n    Florence were at the theatre, \"the Walter House,\" where they\r\n    had a good engagement. \"In that case,\" I said, \"I'll go on\r\n    there at once, and see the performance--and may I take Polly\r\n    with me?\" \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Terry. And there was Polly,\r\n    the child, seated in the room, and looking about nine or ten\r\n    years old: and I was distinctly conscious of the fact, yet\r\n    without any feeling of surprise at its incongruity, that I\r\n    was going to take the _child_ Polly with me to the\r\n    theatre, to see the _grown-up_ Polly act! Both\r\n    pictures--Polly as a child, and Polly as a woman, are, I\r\n    suppose, equally clear in my ordinary waking memory: and it\r\n    seems that in sleep I had contrived to give the two pictures\r\n    separate individualities.\r\n\r\nOf all the mathematical books which Mr. Dodgson wrote, by far the most\r\nelaborate, if not the most original, was \"Euclid and His Modern\r\nRivals.\" The first edition was issued in 1879, and a supplement,\r\nafterwards incorporated into the second edition, appeared in 1885.\r\n\r\nThis book, as the author says, has for its object\r\n\r\n    to furnish evidence (1) that it is essential for the\r\n    purposes of teaching or examining in Elementary Geometry to\r\n    employ one text-book only; (2) that there are strong _a\r\n    priori_ reasons for retaining in all its main features,\r\n    and especially in its sequence and numbering of\r\n    Propositions, and in its treatment of Parallels, the Manual\r\n    of Euclid; and (3) that no sufficient reasons have yet been\r\n    shown for abandoning it in favour of any one of the modern\r\n    Manuals which have been offered as substitutes.\r\n\r\nThe book is written in dramatic form, and relieved throughout by many\r\ntouches in the author's happiest vein, which make it delightful not\r\nonly to the scientific reader, but also to any one of average\r\nintelligence with the slightest sense of humour.\r\n\r\nWhether the conclusions are accepted in their entirety or not, it is\r\ncertain that the arguments are far more effective than if the writer\r\nhad presented them in the form of an essay. Mr. Dodgson had a wide\r\nexperience as a teacher and examiner, so that he knew well what he was\r\nwriting about, and undoubtedly the appearance of this book has done\r\nvery much to stay the hand of the innovator.\r\n\r\nThe scene opens in a College study--time, midnight. Minos, an\r\nexaminer, is discovered seated between two immense piles of\r\nmanuscripts. He is driven almost to distraction in his efforts to mark\r\nfairly the papers sent up, by reason of the confusion caused through\r\nthe candidates offering various substitutes for Euclid. Rhadamanthus,\r\nanother equally distracted examiner, comes to his room.\r\n\r\nThe two men consult together for a time, and then Rhadamanthus\r\nretires, and Minos falls asleep. Hereupon the Ghost of Euclid appears,\r\nand discusses with Minos the reasons for retaining his Manual as a\r\nwhole, in its present order and arrangement. As they are mainly\r\nconcerned with the wants of beginners, their attention is confined to\r\nBooks I. and II.\r\n\r\nWe must be content with one short extract from the dialogue:--\r\n\r\n    _Euclid_.--It is, I think, a friend of yours who has\r\n    amused himself by tabulating the various Theorems which\r\n    might be enunciated on the single subject of Pairs of Lines.\r\n    How many did he make them out to be?\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--About two hundred and fifty, I believe.\r\n\r\n    _Euclid_.--At that rate there would probably be within\r\n    the limit of my First Book--how many?\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--A thousand at least.\r\n\r\n    _Euclid_.--What a popular school-book it will be! How\r\n    boys will bless the name of the writer who first brings out\r\n    the complete thousand!\r\n\r\nWith a view to discussing and criticising his various modern rivals,\r\nEuclid promises to send to Minos the ghost of a German Professor (Herr\r\nNiemand) who \"has read all books, and is ready to defend any thesis,\r\ntrue or untrue.\"\r\n\r\n\"A charming companion!\" as Minos drily remarks.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to Act II., in which the Manuals which reject Euclid's\r\ntreatment of Parallels are dealt with one by one. Those Manuals which\r\nadopt it are reserved for Act III., Scene i.; while in Scene ii., \"The\r\nSyllabus of the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical\r\nTeaching,\" and Wilson's \"Syllabus,\" come under review.\r\n\r\nOnly one or two extracts need be given, which, it is hoped, will\r\nsuffice to illustrate the character and style of the book:\r\n\r\nAct II., Scene v.--Niemand and Minos are arguing for and against\r\nHenrici's \"Elementary Geometry.\"\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--I haven't quite done with points yet. I find\r\n    an assertion that they never jump. Do you think that arises\r\n    from their having \"position,\" which they feel might be\r\n    compromised by such conduct?\r\n\r\n    _Niemand_.--I cannot tell without hearing the passage\r\n    read.\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--It is this: \"A point, in changing its\r\n    position on a curve, passes in moving from one position to\r\n    another through all intermediate positions. It does not move\r\n    by jumps.\"\r\n\r\n    _Niemand_.--That is quite true.\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--Tell me then--is every centre of gravity a\r\n    point?\r\n\r\n    _Niemand_.--Certainly.\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--Let us now consider the centre of gravity of\r\n    a flea. Does it--\r\n\r\n    _Niemand (indignantly)_.--Another word, and I shall\r\n    vanish! I cannot waste a night on such trivialities.\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--I can't resist giving you just _one_\r\n    more tit-bit--the definition of a square at page 123: \"A\r\n    quadrilateral which is a kite, a symmetrical trapezium, and\r\n    a parallelogram is a square!\" And now, farewell, Henrici:\r\n    \"Euclid, with all thy faults, I love thee still!\"\r\n\r\nAgain, from Act II., Scene vi.:--\r\n\r\n    _Niemand_.--He (Pierce, another \"Modern Rival,\") has a\r\n    definition of direction which will, I think, be new to you.\r\n    _(Reads.)_\r\n\r\n    \"The _direction of a line_ in any part is the direction\r\n    of a point at that part from the next preceding point of the\r\n    line!\"\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--That sounds mysterious. Which way along a\r\n    line are \"preceding\" points to be found?\r\n\r\n    _Niemand_.--_Both ways._ He adds, directly\r\n    afterwards, \"A line has two different directions,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--So your definition needs a postscript.... But\r\n    there is yet another difficulty. How far from a point is the\r\n    \"next\" point?\r\n\r\n    _Niemand_.--At an infinitely small distance, of course.\r\n    You will find the matter fully discussed in my work on the\r\n    Infinitesimal Calculus.\r\n\r\n    _Minos_.--A most satisfactory answer for a teacher to\r\n    make to a pupil just beginning Geometry!\r\n\r\nIn Act IV. Euclid reappears to Minos, \"followed by the ghosts of\r\nArchimedes, Pythagoras, &c., who have come to see fair play.\" Euclid\r\nthus sums up his case:--\r\n\r\n    \"'The cock doth craw, the day doth daw,' and all respectable\r\n    ghosts ought to be going home. Let me carry with me the hope\r\n    that I have convinced you of the necessity of retaining my\r\n    order and numbering, and my method of treating Straight\r\n    Lines, Angles, Right Angles, and (most especially)\r\n    Parallels. Leave me these untouched, and I shall look on\r\n    with great contentment while other changes are made--while\r\n    my proofs are abridged and improved--while alternative\r\n    proofs are appended to mine--and while new Problems and\r\n    Theorems are interpolated. In all these matters my Manual is\r\n    capable of almost unlimited improvement.\"\r\n\r\nIn Appendices I. and II. Mr. Dodgson quotes the opinions of two\r\neminent mathematical teachers, Mr. Todhunter and Professor De Morgan,\r\nin support of his argument.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject I should like to refer to a very novel use\r\nof Mr. Dodgson's book--its employment in a school. Mr. G. Hopkins,\r\nMathematical Master in the High School at Manchester, U.S., and\r\nhimself the author of a \"Manual of Plane Geometry,\" has so employed it\r\nin a class of boys aged from fourteen or fifteen upwards. He first\r\ncalled their attention to some of the more prominent difficulties\r\nrelating to the question of Parallels, put a copy of Euclid in their\r\nhands, and let them see his treatment of them, and after some\r\ndiscussion placed before them Mr. Dodgson's \"Euclid and His Modern\r\nRivals\" and \"New Theory of Parallels.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is the fact that American boys are sharper than English,\r\nbut at any rate the youngsters are reported to have read the two books\r\nwith an earnestness and a persistency that were as gratifying to their\r\ninstructor as they were complimentary to Mr. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nIn June of the same year an entry in the Diary refers to a proposal in\r\nConvocation to allow the University Club to have a cricket-ground in\r\nthe Parks. This had been proposed in 1867, and then rejected. Mr.\r\nDodgson sent round to the Common Rooms copies of a poem on \"The\r\nDeserted Parks,\" which had been published by Messrs. Parker in 1867,\r\nand which was afterwards included in \"Notes by an Oxford Chiel.\" I\r\nquote the first few lines:--\r\n\r\n        Museum! loveliest building of the plain\r\n        Where Cherwell winds towards the distant main;\r\n        How often have I loitered o'er thy green,\r\n        Where humble happiness endeared the scene!\r\n        How often have I paused on every charm,--\r\n        The rustic couple walking arm in arm,\r\n        The groups of trees, with seats beneath the shade\r\n        For prattling babes and whisp'ring lovers made,\r\n        The never-failing brawl, the busy mill,\r\n        Where tiny urchins vied in fistic skill.\r\n        (Two phrases only have that dusky race\r\n        Caught from the learned influence of the place;\r\n        Phrases in their simplicity sublime,\r\n        \"Scramble a copper!\" \"Please, sir, what's the time?\")\r\n        These round thy walks their cheerful influence shed;\r\n        These were thy charms--but all these charms are fled,\r\n          Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,\r\n        And rude pavilions sadden all thy green;\r\n        One selfish pastime grasps the whole domain,\r\n        And half a faction swallows up the plain;\r\n        Adown thy glades, all sacrificed to cricket,\r\n        The hollow-sounding bat now guards the wicket;\r\n        Sunk are thy mounds in shapeless level all,\r\n        Lest aught impede the swiftly rolling ball;\r\n        And trembling, shrinking from the fatal blow,\r\n        Far, far away thy hapless children go.\r\n        Ill fares the place, to luxury a prey,\r\n        Where wealth accumulates, and minds decay:\r\n        Athletic sports may flourish or may fade,\r\n        Fashion may make them, even as it has made;\r\n        But the broad Parks, the city's joy and pride,\r\n        When once destroyed can never be supplied!\r\n\r\nReaders of \"Sylvie and Bruno\" will remember the way in which the\r\ninvisible fairy-children save the drunkard from his evil life, and I\r\nhave always felt that Mr. Dodgson meant Sylvie to be something more\r\nthan a fairy--a sort of guardian angel. That such an idea would not\r\nhave been inconsistent with his way of looking at things is shown by\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., _July_, 1879.\r\n\r\n    My dear Ethel,--I have been long intending to answer your\r\n    letter of April 11th, chiefly as to your question in\r\n    reference to Mrs. N--'s letter about the little S--s [whose\r\n    mother had recently died]. You say you don't see \"how they\r\n    can be guided aright by their dead mother, or how light can\r\n    come from her.\" Many people believe that our friends in the\r\n    other world can and do influence us in some way, and perhaps\r\n    even \"guide\" us and give us light to show us our duty. My\r\n    own feeling is, it _may_ be so: but nothing has been\r\n    revealed about it. That the angels do so _is_ revealed,\r\n    and we may feel sure of _that_; and there is a\r\n    beautiful fancy (for I don't think one can call it more)\r\n    that \"a mother who has died leaving a child behind her in\r\n    this world, is allowed to be a sort of guardian angel to\r\n    that child.\" Perhaps Mrs. N-- believes that.\r\n\r\nHere are two other entries in the Diary:--\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 26th_.--Worked from about 9.45 to 6.45, and again\r\n    from 10.15 to 11.45 (making 101/2 hours altogether) at an\r\n    idea which occurred to me of finding limits for _pi_ by\r\n    elementary trigonometry, for the benefit of the\r\n    circle-squarers.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 12th_.--Invented a new way of working one word\r\n    into another. I think of calling the puzzle \"syzygies.\"\r\n\r\n        I give the first three specimens:--\r\n\r\n           MAN                 }\r\n        permanent              }\r\n              entice           } Send MAN on ICE.\r\n                 ICE.          }\r\n\r\n         ACRE                  }\r\n        sacred                 }\r\n          credentials          } RELY on ACRE.\r\n              entirely         }\r\n                  RELY         }\r\n\r\n           PRISM               }\r\n           prismatic           }\r\n            dramatic           } Prove PRISM to be ODIOUS.\r\n        melodrama              }\r\n        melodious              }\r\n           ODIOUS.             }\r\n\r\nIn February, 1880, Mr. Dodgson proposed to the Christ Church\r\n\"Staff-salaries Board,\" that as his tutorial work was lighter he\r\nshould have £200 instead of £300 a year. It is not often that a man\r\nproposes to cut down _his own_ salary, but the suggestion in this\r\ncase was intended to help the College authorities in the policy of\r\nretrenchment which they were trying to carry out.\r\n\r\n    _May 24th_.--Percival, President of Trin. Coll., who\r\n    has Cardinal Newman as his guest, wrote to say that the\r\n    Cardinal would sit for a photo, to me, at Trinity. But I\r\n    could not take my photography there and he couldn't come to\r\n    me: so nothing came of it.\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 19th_. [At Eastbourne].--Took Ruth and Maud to\r\n    the Circus (Hutchinson and Tayleure's--from America). I\r\n    made friends with Mr. Tayleure, who took me to the tents of\r\n    horses, and the caravan he lived in. And I added to my\r\n    theatrical experiences by a chat with a couple of circus\r\n    children--Ada Costello, aged 9, and Polly (Evans, I think),\r\n    aged 13. I found Ada in the outer tent, with the pony on\r\n    which she was to perform--practising vaulting on to it,\r\n    varied with somersaults on the ground. I showed her my wire\r\n    puzzle, and ultimately gave it her, promising a duplicate to\r\n    Polly. Both children seemed bright and happy, and they had\r\n    pleasant manners.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 2nd_.--Mrs. H-- took me to Dr. Bell's (the old\r\n    homoeopathic doctor) to hear Lord Radstock speak about\r\n    \"training children.\" It was a curious affair. First a very\r\n    long hymn; then two very long extempore prayers (not by Lord\r\n    R--), which were strangely self-sufficient and wanting in\r\n    reverence. Lord R--'s remarks were commonplace enough,\r\n    though some of his theories were new, but, I think, not\r\n    true--_e.g.,_ that encouraging emulation in\r\n    schoolboys, or desiring that they should make a good\r\n    position in life, was un-Christian. I escaped at the first\r\n    opportunity after his speech, and went down on the beach,\r\n    where I made acquaintance with a family who were banking up\r\n    with sand the feet and legs of a pretty little girl perched\r\n    on a sand-castle. I got her father to make her stand to be\r\n    drawn. Further along the beach a merry little mite began\r\n    pelting me with sand; so I drew _her_ too.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 16th_.--Thought of a plan for simplifying\r\n    money-orders, by making the sender fill up two duplicate\r\n    papers, one of which he hands in to be transmitted by the\r\n    postmaster--it containing a key-number which the receiver\r\n    has to supply in _his_ copy to get the money. I think\r\n    of suggesting this, and my plan for double postage on\r\n    Sunday, to the Government.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 19th_.--The idea occurred to me that a game might\r\n    be made of letters, to be moved about on a chess-board till\r\n    they form words.\r\n\r\nA little book, published during this year, \"Alice (a dramatic version\r\nof Lewis Carroll's 'Alice'), and other Fairy Tales for Children,\" by\r\nMrs. Freiligrath-Kroeker, was very successful, and, I understand,\r\nstill has a regular sale. Mr. Dodgson most gladly gave his consent to\r\nthe dramatisation of his story by so talented an authoress, and\r\nshortly afterwards Mrs. Kroeker brought out \"Through the\r\nLooking-Glass\" in a similar form.\r\n\r\n    _Jan._ 17, 1881.--To the Lyceum to see \"The Cup\" and\r\n    \"The Corsican Brothers.\" The first is exquisitely put on,\r\n    and Ellen Terry as Camma is the perfection of grace, and\r\n    Irving as the villain, and Mr. Terriss as the husband, were\r\n    very good. But the piece wants substance.\r\n\r\n    _Jan._ 19_th_.--Tried to go to Oxford, but the\r\n    line is blocked near Didcot, so stayed another night in\r\n    town. The next afternoon the line was reported clear, but\r\n    the journey took 5 hours! On the day before the Dean of Ch.\r\n    Ch. and his family were snowed up for 21 hours near Radley.\r\n\r\n    _March_ 27_th_.--Went to S. Mary's and stayed for\r\n    Holy Communion, and, as Ffoulkes was alone, I mustered up\r\n    courage to help him. I read the exhortation, and was pleased\r\n    to find I did not once hesitate. I think I must try\r\n    preaching again soon, as he has often begged me to do.\r\n\r\n    _April_ 16_th_.--Mr. Greenwood approves my theory\r\n    about general elections, and wants me to write on it in the\r\n    _St. James's Gazette_. (The letter appeared on May 5,\r\n    1881.)\r\n\r\n    _May_ 14_th_.--Took the longest walk (I believe) I\r\n    have ever done--round by Dorchester, Didcot and Abingdon--27\r\n    miles--took 8 hours--no blisters, I rejoice to find, and I\r\n    feel very little tired.\r\n\r\n    _May_ 26_th_.--The row-loving men in College are\r\n    beginning to be troublesome again, and last night some 30 or\r\n    40 of them, aided by out-College men, made a great\r\n    disturbance, and regularly defied the Censors. I have just\r\n    been with the other Tutors into Hall, and heard the Dean\r\n    make an excellent speech to the House. Some two or three\r\n    will have to go down, and twelve or fifteen others will be\r\n    punished in various ways. (A later note says): The\r\n    punishments had to be modified--it turned out that the\r\n    disturbers were nearly all out-College men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 229: DR. Liddell. _From a photograph by Hill &\r\nSaunders._]\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson sent a letter to _The Observer_ on this subject:--\r\n\r\n    Sir,--Your paper of May 29th contains a leading article on\r\n    Christ Church, resting on so many mis-statements of fact\r\n    that I venture to appeal to your sense of justice to allow\r\n    me, if no abler writer has addressed you on the subject, an\r\n    opportunity of correcting them. It will, I think, be found\r\n    that in so doing I shall have removed the whole foundation\r\n    on which the writer has based his attack on the House, after\r\n    which I may contentedly leave the superstructure to take\r\n    care of itself. \"Christ Church is always provoking the\r\n    adverse criticism of the outer world.\" The writer justifies\r\n    this rather broad generalisation by quoting three instances\r\n    of such provocation, which I will take one by one.\r\n\r\n    At one time we are told that \"The Dean ... neglects his\r\n    functions, and spends the bulk of his time in Madeira.\" The\r\n    fact is that the Dean's absence from England more than\r\n    twenty years ago during two successive winters was a sad\r\n    necessity, caused by the appearance of symptoms of grave\r\n    disease, from which he has now, under God's blessing,\r\n    perfectly recovered.\r\n\r\n    The second instance occurred eleven years ago, when some of\r\n    the undergraduates destroyed some valuable statuary in the\r\n    Library. Here the writer states that the Dean first\r\n    announced that criminal proceedings would be taken, and\r\n    then, on discovering that the offenders were \"highly\r\n    connected,\" found himself \"converted to the opinion that\r\n    mercy is preferable to stern justice, and charity to the\r\n    strict letter of the law.\" The facts are that the punishment\r\n    awarded to the offenders was deliberated on and determined\r\n    on by the Governing Body, consisting of the Dean, the\r\n    Canons, and some twenty Senior Students; that their\r\n    deliberations were most assuredly in no way affected by any\r\n    thoughts of the offenders being \"highly connected\"; and\r\n    that, when all was over, we had the satisfaction of seeing\r\n    ourselves roundly abused in the papers on both sides, and\r\n    charged with having been too lenient, and also with having\r\n    been too severe.\r\n\r\n    The third instance occurred the other night. Some\r\n    undergraduates were making a disturbance, and the Junior\r\n    Censor \"made his appearance in person upon the scene of\r\n    riot,\" and \"was contumeliously handled.\" Here the only\r\n    statement of any real importance, the alleged assault by\r\n    Christ Church men on the Junior Censor, is untrue. The fact\r\n    is that nearly all the disturbers were out-College men, and,\r\n    though it is true that the Censor was struck by a stone\r\n    thrown from a window, the unenviable distinction of having\r\n    thrown it belongs to no member of the House. I doubt if we\r\n    have one single man here who would be capable of so base and\r\n    cowardly an act.\r\n\r\n    The writer then gives us a curious account of the present\r\n    constitution of the House. The Dean, whom he calls \"the\r\n    right reverend gentleman,\" is, \"in a kind of way, master of\r\n    the College. The Canons, in a vague kind of way, are\r\n    supposed to control the College.\" The Senior Students \"dare\r\n    not call their souls their own,\" and yet somehow dare \"to\r\n    vent their wrath\" on the Junior Students. His hazy, mental\r\n    picture of the position of the Canons may be cleared up by\r\n    explaining to him that the \"control\" they exercise is\r\n    neither more nor less than that of any other six members of\r\n    the Governing Body. The description of the Students I pass\r\n    over as not admitting any appeal to actual facts.\r\n\r\n    The truth is that Christ Church stands convicted of two\r\n    unpardonable crimes--being great, and having a name. Such a\r\n    place must always expect to find itself \"a wide mark for\r\n    scorn and jeers\"--a target where the little and the nameless\r\n    may display their skill. Only the other day an M.P., rising\r\n    to ask a question about Westminster School, went on to speak\r\n    of Christ Church, and wound up with a fierce attack on the\r\n    ancient House. Shall we blame him? Do we blame the wanton\r\n    schoolboy, with a pebble in his hand, all powerless to\r\n    resist the alluring vastness of a barndoor?\r\n\r\n    The essence of the article seems to be summed up in the\r\n    following sentence: \"At Christ Church all attempts to\r\n    preserve order by the usual means have hitherto proved\r\n    uniformly unsuccessful, and apparently remain equally\r\n    fruitless.\" It is hard for one who, like myself, has lived\r\n    here most of his life, to believe that this is seriously\r\n    intended as a description of the place. However, as general\r\n    statements can only be met by general statements, permit me,\r\n    as one who has lived here for thirty years and has taught\r\n    for five-and-twenty, to say that in my experience order has\r\n    been the rule, disorder the rare exception, and that, if the\r\n    writer of your leading article has had an equal amount of\r\n    experience in any similar place of education, and has found\r\n    a set of young men more gentlemanly, more orderly, and more\r\n    pleasant in every way to deal with, than I have found here,\r\n    I cannot but think him an exceptionally favoured\r\n    mortal.--Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n    Charles L. Dodgson,\r\n\r\n    _Student and Mathematical Lecturer of Christ Church_.\r\n\r\nIn July began an amusing correspondence between Mr. Dodgson and a\r\n\"circle-squarer,\" which lasted several months. Mr. Dodgson sent the\r\ninfatuated person, whom we will call Mr. B--, a proof that the area of\r\na circle is less than 3.15 the square of the radius. Mr. B--replied,\r\n\"Your proof is not in accordance with Euclid, it assumes that a circle\r\nmay be considered as a rectangle, and that two right lines can enclose\r\na space.\" He returned the proof, saying that he could not accept any\r\nof it as elucidating the exact area of a circle, or as Euclidean. As\r\nMr. Dodgson's method involved a slight knowledge of trigonometry, and\r\nhe had reason to suspect that Mr. B--was entirely ignorant of that\r\nsubject, he thought it worth while to put him to the test by asking\r\nhim a few questions upon it, but the circle-squarer, with commendable\r\nprudence, declined to discuss anything not Euclidean. Mr. Dodgson then\r\nwrote to him, \"taking leave of the subject, until he should be willing\r\nto enlarge his field of knowledge to the elements of Algebraical\r\nGeometry.\" Mr. B--replied, with unmixed contempt, \"Algebraical\r\nGeometry is all moon-shine.\" _He_ preferred \"weighing cardboard\"\r\nas a means of ascertaining exact truth in mathematical research.\r\nFinally he suggested that Mr. Dodgson might care to join in a\r\nprize-competition to be got up among the followers of Euclid, and as\r\nhe apparently wished him to understand that he (Mr. B--) did not think\r\nmuch of his chances of getting a prize, Mr. Dodgson considered that\r\nthe psychological moment for putting an end to the correspondence had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he was beginning to feel his regular College duties a\r\nterrible clog upon his literary work. The Studentship which he held\r\nwas not meant to tie him down to lectures and examinations. Such work\r\nwas very well for a younger man; he could best serve \"the House\" by\r\nhis literary fame.\r\n\r\n    _July_ 14_th._--Came to a more definite decision\r\n    than I have ever yet done--that it is about time to resign\r\n    the Mathematical Lectureship. My chief motive for holding on\r\n    has been to provide money for others (for myself, I have\r\n    been many years able to retire), but even the £300 a year I\r\n    shall thus lose I may fairly hope to make by the additional\r\n    time I shall have for book-writing. I think of asking the\r\n    G.B. (Governing Body) next term to appoint my successor, so\r\n    that I may retire at the end of the year, when I shall be\r\n    close on fifty years old, and shall have held the\r\n    Lectureship for exactly 26 years. (I had the Honourmen for\r\n    the last two terms of 1855, but was not full Lecturer till\r\n    Hilary, 1856.)\r\n\r\n    _Oct_. 18_th_.--I have just taken an important\r\n    step in life, by sending to the Dean a proposal to resign\r\n    the Mathematical Lectureship at the end of this year. I\r\n    shall now have my whole time at my own disposal, and, if God\r\n    gives me life and continued health and strength, may hope,\r\n    before my powers fail, to do some worthy work in\r\n    writing--partly in the cause of mathematical education,\r\n    partly in the cause of innocent recreation for children, and\r\n    partly, I hope (though so utterly unworthy of being allowed\r\n    to take up such work) in the cause of religious thought. May\r\n    God bless the new form of life that lies before me, that I\r\n    may use it according to His holy will!\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 21st_.--I had a note in the evening from the\r\n    Dean, to say that he had seen the Censors on the subject of\r\n    my proposed resignation at the end of the year, and that\r\n    arrangements should be made, as far as could be done, to\r\n    carry out my wishes; and kindly adding an expression of\r\n    regret at losing my services, but allowing that I had\r\n    \"earned a right to retirement.\" So my Lectureship seems to\r\n    be near its end.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 30th_.--I find by my Journal that I gave my\r\n    _first_  Euclid Lecture in the Lecture-room on Monday,\r\n    January 28, 1856. It consisted of twelve men, of whom nine\r\n    attended. This morning, I have given what is most probably\r\n    my _last_: the lecture is now reduced to nine, of whom\r\n    all attended on Monday: this morning being a Saint's Day,\r\n    the attendance was voluntary, and only two appeared--E.H.\r\n    Morris, and G. Lavie. I was Lecturer when the _father_\r\n    of the latter took his degree, viz., in 1858.\r\n\r\n    There is a sadness in coming to the end of anything in life.\r\n    Man's instincts cling to the Life that will never end.\r\n\r\n    _May 30, 1882._--Called on Mrs. R--. During a good part\r\n    of the evening I read _The Times_, while the party\r\n    played a round game of spelling words--a thing I will never\r\n    join in. Rational conversation and _good_ music are the\r\n    only things which, to me, seem worth the meeting for, for\r\n    grown-up people.\r\n\r\n    _June 1st._--Went out with Charsley, and did four miles\r\n    on one of his velocimans, very pleasantly.\r\n\r\nThe velociman was an early and somewhat cumbrous form of tricycle; Mr.\r\nDodgson made many suggestions for its improvement. He never attempted\r\nto ride a bicycle, however, but, in accordance with his own dictum,\r\n\"In youth, try a bicycle, in age, buy a tricycle,\" confined himself to\r\nthe three-wheeled variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XI Oxford types From a photograph by A.T.\r\nShrimpton]\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 8th_.--Whitehead, of Trinity, told us a charming\r\n    story in Common Room of a father and son. They came up\r\n    together: the son got into a College--the father had to go\r\n    to New Inn Hall: the son passed Responsions, while his\r\n    father had to put off: finally, the father failed in Mods\r\n    and has gone down: the son will probably take his degree,\r\n    and may then be able to prepare his father for another try.\r\n\r\n        Among the coloured cartoons in Shrimpton's\r\n        window at Oxford there used to be, when I was\r\n        up, a picture which I think referred to this story.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 23rd._--Spent two hours \"invigilating\" in the\r\n    rooms of W.J. Grant (who has broken his collar-bone, and is\r\n    allowed to do his Greats papers in this way) while he\r\n    dictated his answers to another undergraduate, Pakenham, who\r\n    acted as scribe.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 24th_.--Dined with Fowler (now President of\r\n    C.C.C.) in hall, to meet Ranken. Both men are now mostly\r\n    bald, with quite grey hair: yet how short a time it seems\r\n    since we were undergraduates together at Whitby! (in 1854).\r\n\r\n    _Dec 8th._--A Common Room Meeting. Fresh powers were\r\n    given to the Wine Committee, and then a new Curator elected.\r\n    I was proposed by Holland, and seconded by Harcourt, and\r\n    accepted office with no light heart: there will be much\r\n    trouble and thought needed to work it satisfactorily, but it\r\n    will take me out of myself a little, and so may be a real\r\n    good--my life was tending to become too much that of a\r\n    selfish recluse.\r\n\r\nDuring this year he composed the words of a song, \"Dreamland.\" The air\r\nwas _dreamed_ by his friend, the late Rev. C. E. Hutchinson, of\r\nChichester. The history of the dream is here given in the words of the\r\ndreamer:--\r\n\r\n    I found myself seated, with many others, in darkness, in a\r\n    large amphitheatre. Deep stillness prevailed. A kind of\r\n    hushed expectancy was upon us. We sat awaiting I know not\r\n    what. Before us hung a vast and dark curtain, and between it\r\n    and us was a kind of stage. Suddenly an intense wish seized\r\n    me to look upon the forms of some of the heroes of past\r\n    days. I cannot say whom in particular I longed to behold,\r\n    but, even as I wished, a faint light flickered over the\r\n    stage, and I was aware of a silent procession of figures\r\n    moving from right to left across the platform in front of\r\n    me. As each figure approached the left-hand corner it turned\r\n    and gazed at me, and I knew (by what means I cannot say) its\r\n    name. One only I recall--Saint George; the light shone with\r\n    a peculiar blueish lustre on his shield and helmet as he\r\n    turned and slowly faced me. The figures were shadowy, and\r\n    floated like mist before me; as each one disappeared an\r\n    invisible choir behind the curtain sang the \"Dream music.\" I\r\n    awoke with the melody ringing in my ears, and the words of\r\n    the last line complete--\"I see the shadows falling, and\r\n    slowly pass away.\" The rest I could not recall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dreamland--Facsimile of Words and Music.]\r\n\r\n        DREAMLAND.\r\n\r\n        Words by LEWIS CARROLL.\r\n\r\n        Music by C.E. HUTCHINSON.\r\n\r\n        When midnight mists are creeping\r\n         And all the land is sleeping\r\n        Around me tread the mighty dead,\r\n         And slowly pass away.\r\n\r\n        Lo, warriors, saints, and sages,\r\n         From out the vanished ages,\r\n        With solemn pace and reverend face\r\n         Appear and pass away.\r\n\r\n        The blaze of noonday splendour,\r\n         The twilight soft and tender,\r\n        May charm the eye: yet they shall die,\r\n         Shall die and pass away\r\n\r\n        But here, in Dreamland's centre,\r\n         No spoiler's hand may enter,\r\n        These visions fair, this radiance rare,\r\n         Shall never pass away\r\n\r\n        I see the shadows falling,\r\n         The forms of eld recalling;\r\n        Around me tread the mighty dead,\r\n         And slowly pass away\r\n\r\nOne of the best services to education which Mr. Dodgson performed was\r\nhis edition of \"Euclid I. and II.,\" which was published in 1882. In\r\nwriting \"Euclid and His Modern Rivals,\" he had criticised somewhat\r\nseverely the various substitutes proposed for Euclid, so far as they\r\nconcerned beginners; but at the same time he had admitted that within\r\nprescribed limits Euclid's text is capable of amendment and\r\nimprovement, and this is what he attempted to do in this book. That he\r\nwas fully justified is shown by the fact that during the years\r\n1882-1889 the book ran through eight editions. In the Introduction he\r\nenumerates, under the three headings of \"Additions,\" \"Omissions,\" and\r\n\"Alterations,\" the chief points of difference between his own and the\r\nordinary editions of Euclid, with his reasons for adopting them. They\r\nare the outcome of long experience, and the most conservative of\r\nteachers would readily accept them.\r\n\r\nThe proof of I. 24, for example, is decidedly better and more\r\nsatisfactory than the ordinary proof, and the introduction of the\r\ndefinition of \"projection\" certainly simplifies the cumbrous\r\nenunciations of II. 12 and 13. Again, the alternative proof of II. 8,\r\nsuggested in the Introduction, is valuable, and removes all excuse for\r\nomitting this proposition, as is commonly clone.\r\n\r\nThe figures used are from the blocks prepared for the late Mr.\r\nTodhunter's well-known edition of Euclid, to which Mr. Dodgson's\r\nmanual forms an excellent stepping-stone.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1883 he went up to town to see the collection of\r\nD. G. Rossetti's pictures in the Burlington Gallery. He was especially\r\nstruck with \"Found,\" which he thus describes--\r\n\r\n    A picture of a man finding, in the streets of London, a girl\r\n    he had loved years before in the days of her innocence. She\r\n    is huddled up against the wall, dressed in gaudy colours,\r\n    and trying to turn away her agonised face, while he, holding\r\n    her wrists, is looking down with an expression of pain and\r\n    pity, condemnation and love, which is one of the most\r\n    marvellous things I have ever seen done in painting.\r\n\r\n    _Jan_. 27, 1883 [His birthday].--I cannot say I feel\r\n    much older at 51 than at 21! Had my first\r\n    \"tasting-luncheon\"; it seemed to give great satisfaction.\r\n    [The object of the Curator's \"tasting-luncheon\" was, of\r\n    course, to give members of Common Room an opportunity of\r\n    deciding what wines should be bought.]\r\n\r\n    _March_ 15_th._--Went up to town to fulfil my\r\n    promise to Lucy A.--: to take her for her _first_ visit\r\n    to the theatre. We got to the Lyceum in good time, and the\r\n    play was capitally acted. I had hinted to Beatrice (Miss\r\n    Ellen Terry) how much she could add to Lucy's pleasure by\r\n    sending round a \"carte\" of herself; she sent a cabinet. She\r\n    is certainly an adept in giving gifts that gratify.\r\n\r\n    _April_ 23_d_.--Tried another long walk--22 miles,\r\n    to Besilsleigh, Fyfield, Kingston, Bagpuize, Frilford,\r\n    Marcham, and Abingdon. The last half of the way was in the\r\n    face of wind, rain, snow, and hail. Was too lame to go into\r\n    Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n(1883-1887)\r\n\r\n    \"The Profits of Authorship\"--\"Rhyme? and Reason?\"--The\r\n    Common Room Cat--Visit to Jersey--Purity of\r\n    elections--Parliamentary Representation--Various literary\r\n    projects--Letters to Miss E. Rix--Being happy--\"A Tangled\r\n    Tale\"--Religious arguments--The \"Alice\" Operetta--\"Alice's\r\n    Adventures Underground\"--\"The Game of Logic\"--Mr. Harry\r\n    Furniss.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Lewis Carroll was advised to make a stand against the heavy\r\ndiscount allowed by publishers to booksellers, and by booksellers to\r\nthe public. Accordingly the following notice began to appear in all\r\nhis books: \"In selling Mr. Lewis Carroll's books to the Trade, Messrs.\r\nMacmillan and Co. will abate 2d. in the shilling (no odd copies), and\r\nallow 5 per cent, discount within six months, and 10 per cent, for\r\ncash. In selling them to the Public (for cash only) they will allow 10\r\nper cent, discount.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bold step to take, and elicited some loud expressions of\r\ndisapproval. \"Rather than buy on the terms Mr. Lewis Carroll offers,\"\r\n\"A Firm of London Booksellers\" wrote in _The Bookseller_ of August\r\n4th, \"the trade will do well to refuse to take copies of his books,\r\nnew or old, so long as he adheres to the terms he has just announced\r\nto the trade for their delectation and delight.\" On the other hand, an\r\neditorial, which appeared in the same number of _The Bookseller,_\r\nexpressed warm approval of the innovation.\r\n\r\nTo avoid all possible misconceptions, the author fully explained his\r\nviews in a little pamphlet on \"The Profits of Authorship.\" He showed\r\nthat the bookseller makes as much profit out of every volume he sells\r\n(assuming the buyer to pay the full published price, which he did in\r\nthose days more readily than he does to-day) as author and publisher\r\ntogether, whereas his share in the work is very small. He does not say\r\nmuch about the author's part in the work--that it is a very heavy one\r\ngoes without saying--but in considering the publisher's share he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    The publisher contributes about as much as the bookseller in\r\n    time and bodily labour, but in mental toil and trouble a\r\n    great deal more. I speak with some personal knowledge of the\r\n    matter, having myself, for some twenty years, inflicted on\r\n    that most patient and painstaking firm, Messrs. Macmillan\r\n    and Co., about as much wear and worry as ever publishers\r\n    have lived through. The day when they undertake a book for\r\n    me is a _dies nefastus_ for them. From that day till\r\n    the book is out--an interval of some two or three years on\r\n    an average--there is no pause in \"the pelting of the\r\n    pitiless storm\" of directions and questions on every\r\n    conceivable detail. To say that every question gets a\r\n    courteous and thoughtful reply--that they are still outside\r\n    a lunatic asylum--and that they still regard me with some\r\n    degree of charity--is to speak volumes in praise of their\r\n    good temper and of their health, bodily and mental. I think\r\n    the publisher's claim on the profits is on the whole\r\n    stronger than the booksellers.\r\n\r\n\"Rhyme? and Reason?\" appeared at Christmas; the dedicatory verses,\r\ninscribed \"To a dear child: in memory of golden summer hours and\r\nwhispers of a summer sea,\" were addressed to a little friend of the\r\nauthor's, Miss Gertrude Chataway. One of the most popular poems in the\r\nbook is \"Hiawatha's Photographing,\" a delicious parody of Longfellow's\r\n\"Hiawatha.\" \"In an age of imitation,\" says Lewis Carroll, in a note at\r\nthe head, \"I can claim no special merit for this slight attempt at\r\ndoing what is known to be so easy.\" It is not every one who has read\r\nthis note who has observed that it is really in the same metre as the\r\npoem below it.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent parody, \"Atalanta in Camden-Town,\" exactly hit off\r\nthe style of that poet who stands alone and unapproached among the\r\npoets of the day, and whom Mr. Dodgson used to call \"the greatest\r\nliving master of language.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fame's Penny Trumpet,\" affectionately dedicated to all \"original\r\nresearchers\" who pant for \"endowment,\" was an attack upon the\r\nVivisectionists,\r\n\r\n      Who preach of Justice--plead with tears\r\n        That Love and Mercy should abound--\r\n      While marking with complacent ears\r\n        The moaning of some tortured hound.\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll thus addresses them:--\r\n\r\n      Fill all the air with hungry wails--\r\n        \"Reward us, ere we think or write!\r\n      Without your gold mere knowledge fails\r\n        To sate the swinish appetite!\"\r\n\r\n      And, where great Plato paced serene,\r\n        Or Newton paused with wistful eye,\r\n      Rush to the chase with hoofs unclean\r\n        And Babel-clamour of the stye!\r\n\r\n      Be yours the pay: be theirs the praise:\r\n        We will not rob them of their due,\r\n      Nor vex the ghosts of other days\r\n        By naming them along with you.\r\n\r\n      They sought and found undying fame:\r\n        They toiled not for reward nor thanks:\r\n      Their cheeks are hot with honest shame\r\n        For you, the modern mountebanks!\r\n\r\n\"For auld lang syne\" the author sent a copy of his book to Mrs.\r\nHargreaves (Miss Alice Liddell), accompanied by a short note.\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, _December_ 21, 1883.\r\n\r\n    Dear Mrs. Hargreaves,--Perhaps the shortest day in the year\r\n    is not _quite_ the most appropriate time for recalling the\r\n    long dreamy summer afternoons of ancient times; but anyhow\r\n    if this book gives you half as much pleasure to receive as\r\n    it does me to send, it will be a success indeed.\r\n\r\n    Wishing you all happiness at this happy season, I am,\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of 1884 was chiefly occupied in Common Room business.\r\nThe Curatorship seems to have been anything but a sinecure. Besides\r\nweightier responsibilities, it involved the care of the Common Room\r\nCat! In this case the \"care\" ultimately killed the cat--but not until\r\nit had passed the span of life usually allotted to those animals, and\r\nbeyond which their further existence is equally a nuisance to\r\nthemselves and to every one else. As to the best way of \"terminating\r\nits sublunary existence,\" Mr. Dodgson consulted two surgeons, one of\r\nwhom was Sir James Paget. I do not know what method was finally\r\nadopted, but I am sure it was one that gave no pain to pussy's nerves,\r\nand as little as possible to her feelings.\r\n\r\nOn March 11th there was a debate in Congregation on the proposed\r\nadmission of women to some of the Honour Schools at Oxford. This was\r\none of the many subjects on which Mr. Dodgson wrote a pamphlet. During\r\nthe debate he made one of his few speeches, and argued strongly\r\nagainst the proposal, on the score of the injury to health which it\r\nwould inflict upon the girl-undergraduates.\r\n\r\nLater in the month he and the Rev. E.F. Sampson, Tutor of Christ\r\nChurch, paid a visit to Jersey, seeing various friends, notably the\r\nRev. F.H. Atkinson, an old College friend of Mr. Dodgson's, who had\r\nhelped him when he was editor of _College Rhymes_. I quote a few\r\nlines from a letter of his to Mr. Atkinson, as showing his views on\r\nmatrimony:--\r\n\r\n    So you have been for twelve years a married man, while I am\r\n    still a lonely old bachelor! And mean to keep so, for the\r\n    matter of that. College life is by no means unmixed misery,\r\n    though married life has no doubt many charms to which I am a\r\n    stranger.\r\n\r\nA note in his Diary on May 5th shows one of the changes in his way of\r\nlife which advancing years forced him to make:--\r\n\r\n    Wrote to -- (who had invited me to dine) to beg off, on the\r\n    ground that, in my old age, I find dinner parties more and\r\n    more fatiguing. This is quite a new departure. I much grudge\r\n    giving an evening (even if it were not tiring) to bandying\r\n    small-talk with dull people.\r\n\r\nThe next extract I give does not look much like old age!\r\n\r\n    I called on Mrs. M--. She was out; and only one maid in,\r\n    who, having come to the gate to answer the bell, found the\r\n    door blown shut on her return. The poor thing seemed really\r\n    alarmed and distressed. However, I got a man to come from a\r\n    neighbouring yard with a ladder, and got in at the\r\n    drawing-room window--a novel way of entering a friend's\r\n    house!\r\n\r\nOddly enough, almost exactly the same thing happened to him in 1888:\r\n\"The door blew shut, with the maid outside, and no one in the house. I\r\ngot the cook of the next house to let me go through their premises,\r\nand with the help of a pair of steps got over the wall between the two\r\nback-yards.\"\r\n\r\nIn July there appeared an article in the _St. James's Gazette_ on\r\nthe subject of \"Parliamentary Elections,\" written by Mr. Dodgson. It\r\nwas a subject in which he was much interested, and a few years before\r\nhe had contributed a long letter on the \"Purity of Elections\" to the\r\nsame newspaper. I wish I had space to give both in full; as things\r\nare, a summary and a few extracts are all I dare attempt. The writer\r\nheld that there are a great number of voters, and _pari passu_ a\r\ngreat number of constituencies, that like to be on the winning side,\r\nand whose votes are chiefly influenced by that consideration. The\r\nballot-box has made it practically impossible for the individual voter\r\nto know which is going to be the winning side, but after the first few\r\ndays of a general election, one side or the other has generally got a\r\nmore or less decided advantage, and a weak-kneed constituency is\r\nsorely tempted to swell the tide of victory.\r\n\r\n    But this is not all. The evil extends further than to the\r\n    single constituency; nay, it extends further than to a\r\n    single general election; it constitutes a feature in our\r\n    national history; it is darkly ominous for the future of\r\n    England. So long as general elections are conducted as at\r\n    present we shall be liable to oscillations of political\r\n    power, like those of 1874 and 1880, but of ever-increasing\r\n    violence--one Parliament wholly at the mercy of one\r\n    political party, the next wholly at the mercy of the\r\n    other--while the Government of the hour, joyfully hastening\r\n    to undo all that its predecessors have done, will wield a\r\n    majority so immense that the fate of every question will be\r\n    foredoomed, and debate will be a farce; in one word, we\r\n    shall be a nation living from hand to mouth, and with no\r\n    settled principle--an army, whose only marching orders will\r\n    be \"Right about face!\"\r\n\r\nHis remedy was that the result of each single election should be kept\r\nsecret till the general election is over:--\r\n\r\n    It surely would involve no practical difficulty to provide\r\n    that the boxes of voting papers should be sealed up by a\r\n    Government official and placed in such custody as would make\r\n    it impossible to tamper with them; and that when the last\r\n    election had been held they should be opened, the votes\r\n    counted, and the results announced.\r\n\r\nThe article on \"Parliamentary Elections\" proposed much more sweeping\r\nalterations. The opening paragraph will show its general purport:--\r\n\r\n    The question, how to arrange our constituencies and conduct\r\n    our Parliamentary elections so as to make the House of\r\n    Commons, as far as possible, a true index of the state of\r\n    opinion in the nation it professes to represent, is surely\r\n    equal in importance to any that the present generation has\r\n    had to settle. And the leap in the dark, which we seem about\r\n    to take in a sudden and vast extension of the franchise,\r\n    would be robbed of half its terrors could we feel assured\r\n    that each political party will be duly represented in the\r\n    next Parliament, so that every side of a question will get a\r\n    fair hearing.\r\n\r\nThe axioms on which his scheme was based were as follows:--\r\n\r\n    (1) That each Member of Parliament should represent\r\n    approximately the same number of electors.\r\n\r\n    (2) That the minority of the two parties into which, broadly\r\n    speaking, each district may be divided, should be adequately\r\n    represented.\r\n\r\n    (3) That the waste of votes, caused by accidentally giving\r\n    one candidate more than he needs and leaving another of the\r\n    same party with less than he needs, should be, if possible,\r\n    avoided.\r\n\r\n    (4) That the process of marking a ballot-paper should be\r\n    reduced to the utmost possible simplicity, to meet the case\r\n    of voters of the very narrowest mental calibre.\r\n\r\n    (5) That the process of counting votes should be as simple\r\n    as possible.\r\n\r\nThen came a precise proposal. I do not pause to compare it in detail\r\nwith the suggestions of Mr. Hare, Mr. Courtney, and others:--\r\n\r\n    I proceed to give a summary of rules for the method I\r\n    propose. Form districts which shall return three, four, or\r\n    more Members, in proportion to their size. Let each elector\r\n    vote for one candidate only. When the poll is closed, divide\r\n    the total number of votes by the number of Members to be\r\n    returned _plus_ one, and take the next greater integer as\r\n    \"quota.\" Let the returning officer publish the list of\r\n    candidates, with the votes given for each, and declare as\r\n    \"returned\" each that has obtained the quota. If there are\r\n    still Members to return, let him name a time when all the\r\n    candidates shall appear before him; and each returned Member\r\n    may then formally assign his surplus votes to whomsoever of\r\n    the other candidates he will, while the other candidates may\r\n    in like manner assign their votes to one another.\r\n\r\n    This method would enable each of the two parties in a\r\n    district to return as many Members as it could muster\r\n    \"quotas,\" no matter how the votes were distributed. If, for\r\n    example, 10,000 were the quota, and the \"reds\" mustered\r\n    30,000 votes, they could return three Members; for, suppose\r\n    they had four candidates, and that A had 22,000 votes, B\r\n    4,000, C 3,000, D 1,000, A would simply have to assign 6,000\r\n    votes to B and 6,000 to C; while D, being hopeless of\r\n    success, would naturally let C have his 1,000 also. There\r\n    would be no risk of a seat being left vacant through two\r\n    candidates of the same party sharing a quota between\r\n    them--an unwritten law would soon come to be\r\n    recognised--that the one with fewest votes should give place\r\n    to the other. And, with candidates of two opposite parties,\r\n    this difficulty could not arise at all; one or the other\r\n    could always be returned by the surplus votes of his party.\r\n\r\nSome notes from the Diary for March, 1885, are worth reproducing\r\nhere:--\r\n\r\n    _March_ 1_st_.--Sent off two letters of literary\r\n    importance, one to Mrs. Hargreaves, to ask her consent to my\r\n    publishing the original MS. of \"Alice\" in facsimile (the\r\n    idea occurred to me the other day); the other to Mr. H.\r\n    Furniss, a very clever illustrator in _Punch_, asking\r\n    if he is open to proposals to draw pictures for me.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Mrs. Hargreaves, which, it will be noticed, was earlier\r\nin date than the short note already quoted in this chapter, ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    My Dear Mrs. Hargreaves,--I fancy this will come to you\r\n    almost like a voice from the dead, after so many years of\r\n    silence, and yet those years have made no difference that I\r\n    can perceive in _my_ clearness of memory of the days when we\r\n    _did_ correspond. I am getting to feel what an old man's\r\n    failing memory is as to recent events and new friends, (for\r\n    instance, I made friends, only a few weeks ago, with a very\r\n    nice little maid of about twelve, and had a walk with\r\n    her--and now I can't recall either of her names!), but my\r\n    mental picture is as vivid as ever of one who was, through\r\n    so many years, my ideal child-friend. I have had scores of\r\n    child-friends since your time, but they have been quite a\r\n    different thing.\r\n\r\n    However, I did not begin this letter to say all _that_. What\r\n    I want to ask is, Would you have any objection to the\r\n    original MS. book of \"Alice's Adventures\" (which I suppose\r\n    you still possess) being published in facsimile? The idea of\r\n    doing so occurred to me only the other day. If, on\r\n    consideration, you come to the conclusion that you would\r\n    rather _not_ have it done, there is an end of the matter.\r\n    If, however, you give a favourable reply, I would be much\r\n    obliged if you would lend it me (registered post, I should\r\n    think, would be safest) that I may consider the\r\n    possibilities. I have not seen it for about twenty years, so\r\n    am by no means sure that the illustrations may not prove to\r\n    be so awfully bad that to reproduce them would be absurd.\r\n\r\n    There can be no doubt that I should incur the charge of\r\n    gross egoism in publishing it. But I don't care for that in\r\n    the least, knowing that I have no such motive; only I think,\r\n    considering the extraordinary popularity the books have had\r\n    (we have sold more than 120,000 of the two), there must be\r\n    many who would like to see the original form.\r\n\r\n    Always your friend,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Harry Furniss elicited a most satisfactory reply. Mr.\r\nFurniss said that he had long wished to illustrate one of Lewis\r\nCarroll's books, and that he was quite prepared to undertake the work\r\n(\"Sylvie and Bruno\").\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. Furniss. _From a photograph_.]\r\n\r\nTwo more notes from the Diary, referring to the same month follow:--\r\n\r\n    _March 10th_.--A great Convocation assembled in the\r\n    theatre, about a proposed grant for Physiology, opposed by\r\n    many (I was one) who wish restrictions to be enacted as to\r\n    the practice of vivisection for research. Liddon made an\r\n    excellent speech against the grant, but it was carried by\r\n    412 to 244.\r\n\r\n    _March 29th_.--Never before have I had so many literary\r\n    projects on hand at once. For curiosity, I will here make a\r\n    list of them.\r\n\r\n    (1) Supplement to \"Euclid and Modern Rivals.\"\r\n\r\n    (2) 2nd Edition of \"Euc. and Mod. Rivals.\"\r\n\r\n    (3) A book of Math. curiosities, which I think of calling\r\n    \"Pillow Problems, and other Math. Trifles.\" This will\r\n    contain Problems worked out in the dark, Logarithms without\r\n    Tables, Sines and angles do., a paper I am now writing on\r\n    \"Infinities and Infinitesimals,\" condensed Long\r\n    Multiplication, and perhaps others.\r\n\r\n    (4) Euclid V.\r\n\r\n    (5) \"Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers,\" which is nearly\r\n    complete, and gives actual proof of limits 3.14158, 3.14160.\r\n\r\n    (6) A symbolical Logic, treated by my algebraic method.\r\n\r\n    (7) \"A Tangled Tale.\"\r\n\r\n    (8) A collection of Games and Puzzles of my devising, with\r\n    fairy pictures by Miss E.G. Thomson. This might also contain\r\n    my \"Mem. Tech.\" for dates; my \"Cipher-writing\" scheme for\r\n    Letter-registration, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n    (9) Nursery Alice.\r\n\r\n    (10) Serious poems in \"Phantasmagoria.\"\r\n\r\n    (11) \"Alice's Adventures Underground.\"\r\n\r\n    (12) \"Girl's Own Shakespeare.\" I have begun on \"Tempest.\"\r\n\r\n    (13) New edition of \"Parliamentary Representation.\"\r\n\r\n    (14) New edition of Euc. I., II.\r\n\r\n    (15) The new child's book, which Mr. Furniss is to\r\n    illustrate. I have settled on no name as yet, but it will\r\n    perhaps be \"Sylvie and Bruno.\"\r\n\r\n    I have other shadowy ideas, _e.g._, a Geometry for\r\n    Boys, a vol. of Essays on theological points freely and\r\n    plainly treated, and a drama on \"Alice\" (for which Mr.\r\n    Mackenzie would write music): but the above is a fair\r\n    example of \"too many irons in the fire!\"\r\n\r\nA letter written about this time to his friend, Miss Edith Rix, gives\r\nsome very good hints about how to work, all the more valuable because\r\nhe had himself successfully carried them out. The first hint was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    When you have made a thorough and reasonably long effort, to\r\n    understand a thing, and still feel puzzled by it,\r\n    _stop_, you will only hurt yourself by going on. Put it\r\n    aside till the next morning; and if _then_ you can't\r\n    make it out, and have no one to explain it to you, put it\r\n    aside entirely, and go back to that part of the subject\r\n    which you _do_ understand. When I was reading\r\n    Mathematics for University honours, I would sometimes, after\r\n    working a week or two at some new book, and mastering ten or\r\n    twenty pages, get into a hopeless muddle, and find it just\r\n    as bad the next morning. My rule was _to begin the book\r\n    again_. And perhaps in another fortnight I had come to\r\n    the old difficulty with impetus enough to get over it. Or\r\n    perhaps not. I have several books that I have begun over and\r\n    over again.\r\n\r\n    My second hint shall be--Never leave an unsolved difficulty\r\n    _behind_. I mean, don't go any further in that book\r\n    till the difficulty is conquered. In this point, Mathematics\r\n    differs entirely from most other subjects. Suppose you are\r\n    reading an Italian book, and come to a hopelessly obscure\r\n    sentence--don't waste too much time on it, skip it, and go\r\n    on; you will do very well without it. But if you skip a\r\n    _mathematical_ difficulty, it is sure to crop up again:\r\n    you will find some other proof depending on it, and you will\r\n    only get deeper and deeper into the mud.\r\n\r\n    My third hint is, only go on working so long as the brain is\r\n    _quite_ clear. The moment you feel the ideas getting\r\n    confused leave off and rest, or your penalty will be that\r\n    you will never learn Mathematics _at all_!\r\n\r\nTwo more letters to the same friend are, I think, deserving of a place\r\nhere:--\r\n\r\n    Eastbourne, _Sept_. 25, 1885.\r\n\r\n    My dear Edith,--One subject you touch on--\"the Resurrection\r\n    of the Body\"--is very interesting to me, and I have given it\r\n    much thought (I mean long ago). _My_ conclusion was to\r\n    give up the _literal_ meaning of the _material_\r\n    body altogether. _Identity_, in some mysterious way,\r\n    there evidently is; but there is no resisting the scientific\r\n    fact that the actual _material_ usable for\r\n    _physical_ bodies has been used over and over again--so\r\n    that each atom would have several owners. The mere solitary\r\n    fact of the existence of _cannibalism_ is to my mind a\r\n    sufficient _reductio ad absurdum_ of the theory that\r\n    the particular set of atoms I shall happen to own at death\r\n    (changed every seven years, they say) will be mine in the\r\n    next life--and all the other insuperable difficulties (such\r\n    as people born with bodily defects) are swept away at once\r\n    if we accept S. Paul's \"spiritual body,\" and his simile of\r\n    the grain of corn. I have read very little of \"Sartor\r\n    Resartus,\" and don't know the passage you quote: but I\r\n    accept the idea of the material body being the \"dress\" of\r\n    the spiritual--a dress needed for material life.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., _Dec_. 13, 1885.\r\n\r\n    Dear Edith,--I have been a severe sufferer from\r\n    _Logical_ puzzles of late. I got into a regular tangle\r\n    about the \"import of propositions,\" as the ordinary logical\r\n    books declare that \"all _x_ is _z_\" doesn't even\r\n    _hint_ that any _x_'s exist, but merely that the\r\n    qualities are so inseparable that, if ever _x_ occurs,\r\n    _z_ must occur also. As to \"some _x_ is _z_\"\r\n    they are discreetly silent; and the living authorities I\r\n    have appealed to, including our Professor of Logic, take\r\n    opposite sides! Some say it means that the qualities are so\r\n    connected that, if any _x_'s _did_ exist, some\r\n    _must_ be _z_--others that it only means\r\n    compatibility, _i.e.,_ that some _might_ be\r\n    _z_, and they would go on asserting, with perfect\r\n    belief in their truthfulness, \"some boots are made of\r\n    brass,\" even if they had all the boots in the world before\r\n    them, and knew that _none_ were so made, merely because\r\n    there is no inherent impossibility in making boots of brass!\r\n    Isn't it bewildering? I shall have to mention all this in my\r\n    great work on Logic--but _I_ shall take the line \"any\r\n    writer may mean exactly what he pleases by a phrase so long\r\n    as he explains it beforehand.\" But I shall not venture to\r\n    assert \"some boots are made of brass\" till I have found a\r\n    pair! The Professor of Logic came over one day to talk about\r\n    it, and we had a long and exciting argument, the result of\r\n    which was \"_x -x_\"--a magnitude which you will be able\r\n    to evaluate for yourself.\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the good advice Mr. Dodgson used to give his young\r\nfriends, the following letter to Miss Isabel Standen will serve\r\nexcellently:--\r\n\r\n    Eastbourne, _Aug_. 4, 1885.\r\n\r\n    I can quite understand, and much sympathise with, what you\r\n    say of your feeling lonely, and not what you can honestly\r\n    call \"happy.\" Now I am going to give you a bit of philosophy\r\n    about that--my own experience is, that _every_ new form\r\n    of life we try is, just at first, irksome rather than\r\n    pleasant. My first day or two at the sea is a little\r\n    depressing; I miss the Christ Church interests, and haven't\r\n    taken up the threads of interest here; and, just in the same\r\n    way, my first day or two, when I get back to Christ Church,\r\n    I miss the seaside pleasures, and feel with unusual\r\n    clearness the bothers of business-routine. In all such\r\n    cases, the true philosophy, I believe, is \"_wait_ a\r\n    bit.\" Our mental nerves seem to be so adjusted that we feel\r\n    _first_ and most keenly, the _dis_-comforts of any\r\n    new form of life; but, after a bit, we get used to them, and\r\n    cease to notice them; and _then_ we have time to\r\n    realise the enjoyable features, which at first we were too\r\n    much worried to be conscious of.\r\n\r\n    Suppose you hurt your arm, and had to wear it in a sling for\r\n    a month. For the first two or three days the discomfort of\r\n    the bandage, the pressure of the sling on the neck and\r\n    shoulder, the being unable to use the arm, would be a\r\n    constant worry. You would feel as if all comfort in life\r\n    were gone; after a couple of days you would be used to the\r\n    new sensations, after a week you perhaps wouldn't notice\r\n    them at all; and life would seem just as comfortable as\r\n    ever.\r\n\r\n    So my advice is, don't think about loneliness, or happiness,\r\n    or unhappiness, for a week or two. Then \"take stock\" again,\r\n    and compare your feelings with what they were two weeks\r\n    previously. If they have changed, even a little, for the\r\n    better you are on the right track; if not, we may begin to\r\n    suspect the life does not suit you. But what I want\r\n    _specially_ to urge is that there's no use in comparing\r\n    one's feelings between one day and the next; you must allow\r\n    a reasonable interval, for the _direction of_ change to\r\n    show itself.\r\n\r\n    Sit on the beach, and watch the waves for a few seconds; you\r\n    say \"the tide is coming in \"; watch half a dozen successive\r\n    waves, and you may say \"the last is the lowest; it is going\r\n    out.\" Wait a quarter of an hour, and compare its\r\n    _average_ place with what it was at first, and you will\r\n    say \"No, it is coming in after all.\" ...\r\n\r\n    With love, I am always affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nThe next event to chronicle in Lewis Carroll's Life is the\r\npublication, by Messrs. Macmillan, of \"A Tangled Tale,\" a series of\r\nmathematical problems which had originally appeared in the _Monthly\r\nPacket_. In addition to the problems themselves, the author added\r\ntheir correct solutions, with criticisms on the solutions, correct or\r\notherwise, which the readers of the _Monthly Packet_ had sent in\r\nto him. With some people this is the most popular of all his books; it\r\nis certainly the most successful attempt he ever made to combine\r\nmathematics and humour. The book was illustrated by Mr. A.B. Frost,\r\nwho entered most thoroughly into the spirit of the thing. One of his\r\npictures, \"Balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the\r\ndragon,\" is irresistibly comic. A short quotation will better enable\r\nthe reader to understand the point of the joke:--\r\n\r\n    Balbus was waiting for them at the hotel; the journey down\r\n    had tried him, he said; so his two pupils had been the round\r\n    of the place, in search of lodgings, without the old tutor\r\n    who had been their inseparable companion from their\r\n    childhood. They had named him after the hero of their Latin\r\n    exercise-book, which overflowed with anecdotes about that\r\n    versatile genius--anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was\r\n    more than compensated by their sensational brilliance.\r\n    \"Balbus has overcome all his enemies\" had been marked by\r\n    their tutor, in the margin of the book, \"Successful\r\n    Bravery.\" In this way he had tried to extract a moral from\r\n    every anecdote about Balbus--sometimes one of warning, as in\r\n    \"Balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon,\" against which he had\r\n    written, \"Rashness in Speculation \"--sometimes of\r\n    encouragement, as in the words, \"Influence of Sympathy in\r\n    United Action,\" which stood opposite to the anecdote \"Balbus\r\n    was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon\"--and\r\n    sometimes it dwindled down to a single word, such as\r\n    \"Prudence,\" which was all he could extract from the touching\r\n    record that \"Balbus, having scorched the tail of the dragon,\r\n    went away.\" His pupils liked the short morals best, as it\r\n    left them more room for marginal illustrations, and in this\r\n    instance they required all the space they could get to\r\n    exhibit the rapidity of the hero's departure.\r\n\r\nBalbus and his pupils go in search of lodgings, which are only to be\r\nfound in a certain square; at No. 52, one of the pupils supplements\r\nthe usual questions by asking the landlady if the cat scratches:--\r\n\r\n    The landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure\r\n    the cat was not listening. \"I will not deceive you,\r\n    gentlemen,\" she said. \"It _do_ scratch, but not without\r\n    you pulls its whiskers! It'll never do it,\" she repeated\r\n    slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact words of\r\n    some written agreement between herself and the cat, \"without\r\n    you pulls its whiskers!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Much may be excused in a cat so treated,\" said Balbus as\r\n    they left the house and crossed to No. 70, leaving the\r\n    landlady curtesying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to\r\n    herself her parting words, as if they were a form of\r\n    blessing--\"Not without you pulls its whiskers!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a crayon drawing by the Rev. H.C.\r\nGaye_.]\r\n\r\nThey secure one room at each of the following numbers--the square\r\ncontains 20 doors on each side--Nine, Twenty-five, Fifty-two, and\r\nSeventy-three. They require three bedrooms and one day-room, and\r\ndecide to take as day-room the one that gives them the least walking\r\nto do to get to it. The problem, of course, is to discover which room\r\nthey adopted as the day-room. There are ten such \"knots\" in the book,\r\nand few, if any of them, can be untied without a good deal of thought.\r\n\r\nOwing, probably, to the strain of incessant work, Mr. Dodgson about\r\nthis period began to be subject to a very peculiar, yet not very\r\nuncommon, optical delusion, which takes the form of seeing moving\r\nfortifications. Considering the fact that he spent a good twelve hours\r\nout of every twenty-four in reading and writing, and that he was now\r\nwell over fifty years old, it was not surprising that nature should\r\nbegin to rebel at last, and warn him of the necessity of occasional\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nSome verses on \"Wonderland\" by \"One who loves Alice,\" appeared in the\r\nChristmas number of _Sylvia's Home Journal_, 1885. They were\r\nwritten by Miss M.E. Manners, and, as Lewis Carroll himself admired\r\nthem, they will, I think, be read with interest:--\r\n\r\n      WONDERLAND.\r\n\r\n      How sweet those happy days gone by,\r\n          Those days of sunny weather,\r\n      When Alice fair, with golden hair,\r\n          And we--were young together;--\r\n      When first with eager gaze we scann'd\r\n      The page which told of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      On hearthrug in the winter-time\r\n          We lay and read it over;\r\n      We read it in the summer's prime,\r\n          Amidst the hay and clover.\r\n      The trees, by evening breezes fann'd,\r\n      Murmured sweet tales of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      We climbed the mantelpiece, and broke\r\n          The jars of Dresden china;\r\n      In Jabberwocky tongue we spoke,\r\n          We called the kitten \"Dinah!\"\r\n      And, oh! how earnestly we planned\r\n      To go ourselves to Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      The path was fringed with flowers rare,\r\n          With rainbow colours tinted;\r\n      The way was \"up a winding stair,\"\r\n          Our elders wisely hinted.\r\n      We did not wish to understand\r\n      _Bed_ was the road to Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      We thought we'd wait till we should grow\r\n          Stronger as well as bolder,\r\n      But now, alas! full well we know\r\n          We're only growing older.\r\n      The key held by a childish hand,\r\n      Fits best the door of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      Yet still the Hatter drinks his tea,\r\n          The Duchess finds a moral,\r\n      And Tweedledum and Tweedledee\r\n          Forget in fright their quarrel.\r\n      The Walrus still weeps on the sand,\r\n      That strews the shores of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      And other children feel the spell\r\n          Which once we felt before them,\r\n      And while the well-known tale we tell,\r\n          We watch it stealing o'er them:\r\n      Before their dazzled eyes expand\r\n      The glorious realms of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      Yes, \"time is fleet,\" and we have gained\r\n          Years more than twice eleven;\r\n      Alice, dear child, hast thou remained\r\n          \"Exactually\" seven?\r\n      With \"proper aid,\" \"two\" could command\r\n      Time to go back in Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      Or have the years (untouched by charms),\r\n          With joy and sorrow laden,\r\n      Rolled by, and brought unto thy arms\r\n          A dainty little maiden?\r\n      Another Alice, who shall stand\r\n      By thee to hear of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      Carroll! accept the heartfelt thanks\r\n          Of children of all ages,\r\n      Of those who long have left their ranks,\r\n          Yet still must love the pages\r\n      Written by him whose magic wand\r\n      Called up the scenes of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n      Long mayst thou live, the sound to hear\r\n          Which most thy heart rejoices,\r\n      Of children's laughter ringing clear,\r\n          And children's merry voices,\r\n      Until for thee an angel-hand\r\n      Draws back the veil of Wonderland.\r\n\r\n                          One Who Loves \"Alice.\"\r\n\r\nThree letters, written at the beginning of 1886 to Miss Edith Rix, to\r\nwhom he had dedicated \"A Tangled Tale,\" are interesting as showing the\r\ndeeper side of his character:--\r\n\r\n    Guildford, _Jan_. 15, 1886.\r\n\r\n    My dear Edith,--I have been meaning for some time to write\r\n    to you about agnosticism, and other matters in your letter\r\n    which I have left unnoticed. And yet I do not know, much as\r\n    what you say interests me, and much as I should like to be\r\n    of use to any wandering seeker after truth, that I am at all\r\n    likely to say anything that will be new to you and of any\r\n    practical use.\r\n\r\n    The Moral Science student you describe must be a beautiful\r\n    character, and if, as you say, she lives a noble life, then,\r\n    even though she does not, as yet, see any God, for whose\r\n    sake she can do things, I don't think you need be unhappy\r\n    about her. \"When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee,\"\r\n    is often supposed to mean that Nathanael had been\r\n    _praying_, praying no doubt ignorantly and imperfectly,\r\n    but yet using the light he had: and it seems to have been\r\n    accepted as faith in the Messiah. More and more it seems to\r\n    me (I hope you won't be _very_ much shocked at me as an\r\n    ultra \"Broad\" Churchman) that what a person _is_ is of\r\n    more importance in God's sight than merely what propositions\r\n    he affirms or denies. _You_, at any rate, can do more\r\n    good among those new friends of yours by showing them what a\r\n    Christian _is_, than by telling them what a Christian\r\n    _believes_....\r\n\r\n    I have a deep dread of argument on religious topics: it has\r\n    many risks, and little chance of doing good. You and I will\r\n    never _argue_, I hope, on any controverted religious\r\n    question: though I do hope we may see the day when we may\r\n    freely _speak_ of such things, even where we happen to\r\n    hold different views. But even then I should have no\r\n    inclination, if we did differ, to conclude that my view was\r\n    the right one, and to try to convert you to it....\r\n\r\n    Now I come to your letter dated Dec. 22nd, and must scold\r\n    you for saying that my solution of the problem was \"quite\r\n    different _to_ all common ways of doing it\": if\r\n    _you_ think that's good English, well and good; but\r\n    _I_ must beg to differ to you, and to hope you will\r\n    _never_ write me a sentence similar from this again.\r\n    However, \"worse remains behind\"; and if you deliberately\r\n    intend in future, when writing to me about one of England's\r\n    greatest poets, to call him \"Shelly,\" then all I can say is,\r\n    that you and I will have to quarrel! Be warned in time.\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n    CH. Ch., _Jan_. 26, 1886.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Edith,--I am interested by what you say of Miss--.\r\n    You will know, without my saying it, that if she, or any\r\n    other friend of yours with any troubles, were to like to\r\n    write to me, I would _very_ gladly try to help: with\r\n    all my ignorance and weakness, God has, I think, blessed my\r\n    efforts in that way: but then His strength is made perfect\r\n    in weakness....\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., _Feb_. 14, 1886.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Edith,... I think I've already noticed, in a way,\r\n    most of the rest of that letter--except what you say about\r\n    learning more things \"after we are dead.\" _I_ certainly\r\n    like to think that may be so. But I have heard the other\r\n    view strongly urged, a good deal based on \"then shall we\r\n    know even as we are known.\" But I can't believe that that\r\n    means we shall have _all_ knowledge given us in a\r\n    moment--nor can I fancy it would make me any happier: it is\r\n    the _learning_ that is the chief joy, here, at any\r\n    rate....\r\n\r\n    I find another remark anent \"pupils\"--a bold speculation\r\n    that my 1,000 pupils may really \"go on\" in the future life,\r\n    till they _have_ really outstripped Euclid. And,\r\n    please, what is _Euclid_ to be doing all that time? ...\r\n\r\n    One of the most dreadful things you have ever told me is\r\n    your students' theory of going and speaking to any one they\r\n    are interested in, without any introductions. This, joined\r\n    with what you say of some of them being interested in\r\n    \"Alice,\" suggests the horrid idea of their some day walking\r\n    into this room and beginning a conversation. It is enough to\r\n    make one shiver, even to think of it!\r\n\r\n    Never mind if people do say \"Good gracious!\" when you help\r\n    old women: it _is_ being, in some degree, both \"good\"\r\n    _and_ \"gracious,\" one may hope. So the remark wasn't so\r\n    inappropriate.\r\n\r\n    I fear I agree with your friend in not liking all sermons.\r\n    Some of them, one has to confess, are rubbish: but then I\r\n    release my attention from the preacher, and go ahead in any\r\n    line of thought he may have started: and his after-eloquence\r\n    acts as a kind of accompaniment--like music while one is\r\n    reading poetry, which often, to me, adds to the effect.\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alice\" operetta, which Mr. Dodgson had despaired of, was at last\r\nto become a reality. Mr. Savile Clarke wrote on August 28th to ask his\r\nleave to dramatise the two books, and he gladly assented. He only made\r\none condition, which was very characteristic of him, that there should\r\nbe \"no _suggestion_ even of coarseness in libretto or in stage\r\nbusiness.\" The hint was hardly necessary, for Mr. Savile Clarke was\r\nnot the sort of man to spoil his work, or to allow others to spoil it,\r\nby vulgarity. Several alterations were made in the books before they\r\nwere suitable for a dramatic performance; Mr. Dodgson had to write a\r\nsong for the ghosts of the oysters, which the Walrus and the Carpenter\r\nhad devoured. He also completed \"Tis the voice of the lobster,\" so as\r\nto make it into a song. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n      Tis the voice of the lobster; I heard him declare\r\n      \"You have baked me too brown: I must sugar my hair.\"\r\n      As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\r\n      Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\r\n      When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\r\n      And talks with the utmost contempt of the shark;\r\n      But when the tide rises, and sharks are around,\r\n      His words have a timid and tremulous sound.\r\n\r\n      I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\r\n      How the owl and the panther were sharing a pie:\r\n      The panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\r\n      And the owl had the dish for his share of the treat.\r\n      When the plate was divided, the owl, as a boon,\r\n      Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\r\n      But the panther obtained both the fork and the knife,\r\n      So, when _he_ lost his temper, the owl lost its life.\r\n\r\nThe play, for the first few weeks at least, was a great success. Some\r\nnotes in Mr. Dodgson's Diary which relate to it, show how he\r\nappreciated Mr. Savile Clarke's venture:--\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 30th._--To London with M--, and took her to\r\n    \"Alice in Wonderland,\" Mr. Savile Clarke's play at the\r\n    Prince of Wales's Theatre. The first act (Wonderland) goes\r\n    well, specially the Mad Tea Party. Mr. Sydney Harcourt is a\r\n    capital Hatter, and little Dorothy d'Alcourt (æt. 61/2) a\r\n    delicious Dormouse. Phoebe Carlo is a splendid Alice. Her\r\n    song and dance with the Cheshire Cat (Master C. Adeson, who\r\n    played the Pirate King in \"Pirates of Penzance\") was a gem.\r\n    As a whole the play seems a success.\r\n\r\n    _Feb_. 11, 1887.--Went to the \"Alice\" play, where we\r\n    sat next a chatty old gentleman, who told me that the author\r\n    of \"Alice\" had sent Phoebe Carlo a book, and that she had\r\n    written to him to say that she would do her very best, and\r\n    further, that he is \"an Oxford man\"--all which I hope I\r\n    received with a sufficient expression of pleased interest.\r\n\r\nShortly before the production of the play, a Miss Whitehead had drawn\r\na very clever medley-picture, in which nearly all Tenniel's wonderful\r\ncreations--the Dormouse, the White Knight, the Mad Hatter,\r\n&c.--appeared. This design was most useful as a \"poster\" to advertise\r\nthe play. After the London run was over, the company made a tour of\r\nthe provinces, where it met with a fair amount of success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Medley of Tenniel's Illustrations in \"Alice.\"\r\n_From an etching by Miss Whitehead; used as a theatrical\r\nadvertisement_.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1886, \"Alice's Adventures Underground,\" a facsimile of\r\nthe original MS. book, afterwards developed into \"Alice's Adventures\r\nin Wonderland,\" with thirty-seven illustrations by the author, was\r\npublished by Macmillan & Co. A postscript to the Preface stated that\r\nany profits that might arise from the book would be given to\r\nChildren's Hospitals and Convalescent Homes for Sick Children. Shortly\r\nbefore the book came out, Lewis Carroll wrote to Mrs. Hargreaves,\r\ngiving a description of the difficulties that he had encountered in\r\nproducing it:--\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, Oxford,\r\n\r\n    _November_ 11, 1886.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Mrs. Hargreaves,--Many thanks for your permission to\r\n    insert \"Hospitals\" in the Preface to your book. I have had\r\n    almost as many adventures in getting that unfortunate\r\n    facsimile finished, _Above_ ground, as your namesake\r\n    had _Under_ it!\r\n\r\n    First, the zincographer in London, recommended to me for\r\n    photographing the book, page by page, and preparing the\r\n    zinc-blocks, declined to undertake it unless I would entrust\r\n    the book to _him_, which I entirely refused to do. I\r\n    felt that it was only due to you, in return for your great\r\n    kindness in lending so unique a book, to be scrupulous in\r\n    not letting it be even _touched_ by the workmen's\r\n    hands. In vain I offered to come and reside in London with\r\n    the book, and to attend daily in the studio, to place it in\r\n    position to be photographed, and turn over the pages as\r\n    required. He said that could not be done because \"other\r\n    authors' works were being photographed there, which must on\r\n    no account be seen by the public.\" I undertook not to look\r\n    at _anything_ but my own book; but it was no use: we\r\n    could not come to terms.\r\n\r\n    Then -- recommended me a certain Mr. X--, an excellent\r\n    photographer, but in so small a way of business that I\r\n    should have to _prepay_ him, bit by bit, for the\r\n    zinc-blocks: and _he_ was willing to come to Oxford,\r\n    and do it here. So it was all done in my studio, I remaining\r\n    in waiting all the time, to turn over the pages.\r\n\r\n    But I daresay I have told you so much of the story already.\r\n\r\n    Mr. X-- did a first-rate set of negatives, and took them\r\n    away with him to get the zinc-blocks made. These he\r\n    delivered pretty regularly at first, and there seemed to be\r\n    every prospect of getting the book out by Christmas, 1885.\r\n\r\n    On October 18, 1885, I sent your book to Mrs. Liddell, who\r\n    had told me your sisters were going to visit you and would\r\n    take it with them. I trust it reached you safely?\r\n\r\n    Soon after this--I having prepaid for the whole of the\r\n    zinc-blocks--the supply suddenly ceased, while twenty-two\r\n    pages were still due, and Mr. X-- disappeared!\r\n\r\n    My belief is that he was in hiding from his creditors. We\r\n    sought him in vain. So things went on for months. At one\r\n    time I thought of employing a detective to find him, but was\r\n    assured that \"all detectives are scoundrels.\" The\r\n    alternative seemed to be to ask you to lend the book again,\r\n    and get the missing pages re-photographed. But I was most\r\n    unwilling to rob you of it again, and also afraid of the\r\n    risk of loss of the book, if sent by post--for even\r\n    \"registered post\" does not seem _absolutely_ safe.\r\n\r\n    In April he called at Macmillan's and left _eight_\r\n    blocks, and again vanished into obscurity.\r\n\r\n    This left us with fourteen pages (dotted up and down the\r\n    book) still missing. I waited awhile longer, and then put\r\n    the thing into the hands of a solicitor, who soon found the\r\n    man, but could get nothing but promises from him. \"You will\r\n    never get the blocks,\" said the solicitor, \"unless you\r\n    frighten him by a summons before a magistrate.\" To this at\r\n    last I unwillingly consented: the summons had to be taken\r\n    out at--(that is where this aggravating man is living),\r\n    and this entailed two journeys from Eastbourne--one to get\r\n    the summons (my _personal_ presence being necessary),\r\n    and the other to attend in court with the solicitor on the\r\n    day fixed for hearing the case. The defendant didn't appear;\r\n    so the magistrate said he would take the case in his\r\n    absence. Then I had the new and exciting experience of being\r\n    put into the witness-box, and sworn, and cross-examined by a\r\n    rather savage magistrate's clerk, who seemed to think that,\r\n    if he only bullied me enough, he would soon catch me out in\r\n    a falsehood! I had to give the magistrate a little lecture\r\n    on photo-zincography, and the poor man declared the case was\r\n    so complicated he must adjourn it for another week. But this\r\n    time, in order to secure the presence of our slippery\r\n    defendant, he issued a warrant for his apprehension, and the\r\n    constable had orders to take him into custody and lodge him\r\n    in prison, the night before the day when the case was to\r\n    come on. The news of _this_ effectually frightened him,\r\n    and he delivered up the fourteen negatives (he hadn't done\r\n    the blocks) before the fatal day arrived. I was rejoiced to\r\n    get them, even though it entailed the paying a second time\r\n    for getting the fourteen blocks done, and withdrew the\r\n    action.\r\n\r\n    The fourteen blocks were quickly done and put into the\r\n    printer's hands; and all is going on smoothly at last: and I\r\n    quite hope to have the book completed, and to be able to\r\n    send you a very special copy (bound in white vellum, unless\r\n    you would prefer some other style of binding) by the end of\r\n    the month.\r\n\r\n    Believe me always,\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n\"The Game of Logic\" was Lewis Carroll's next book; it appeared about\r\nthe end of February, 1887. As a method of teaching the first\r\nprinciples of Logic to children it has proved most useful; the\r\nsubject, usually considered very difficult to a beginner, is made\r\nextremely easy by simplification of method, and both interesting and\r\namusing by the quaint syllogisms that the author devised, such as--\r\n\r\n      No bald person needs a hair-brush;\r\n      No lizards have hair;\r\n        Therefore[1] No lizard needs a hair brush.\r\n\r\n      Caterpillars are not eloquent;\r\n      Jones is eloquent;\r\n          Jones is not a caterpillar.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with much interchange of correspondence between author and\r\nartist, the pictures for the new fairy tale, \"Sylvie and Bruno,\" were\r\nbeing gradually evolved. Each of them was subjected by Lewis Carroll\r\nto the most minute criticism--hyper-criticism, perhaps, occasionally.\r\nA few instances of the sort of criticisms he used to make upon Mr.\r\nFurniss's work may be interesting; I have extracted them from a letter\r\ndated September 1, 1887. It will be seen that when he really admired a\r\nsketch he did not stint his praise:--\r\n\r\n    (1) \"Sylvie helping beetle\" [p. 193]. A quite charming\r\n    composition.\r\n\r\n    (3) \"The Doctor\" and \"Eric.\" (Mr. Furniss's idea of their\r\n    appearance). No! The Doctor won't do _at all!_ He is a\r\n    smug London man, a great \"ladies' man,\" who would hardly\r\n    talk anything but medical \"shop.\" He is forty at least, and\r\n    can have had no love-affair for the last fifteen years. I\r\n    want him to be about twenty-five, powerful in frame,\r\n    poetical in face: capable of intelligent interest in any\r\n    subject, and of being a passionate lover. How would you draw\r\n    King Arthur when he first met Guinevere? Try _that_\r\n    type.\r\n\r\n    Eric's attitude is capital: but his face is a little too\r\n    near to the ordinary \"masher.\" Please avoid _that_\r\n    inane creature; and please don't cut his hair short. That\r\n    fashion will be \"out\" directly.\r\n\r\n    (4) \"Lady Muriel\" (head); ditto (full length); \"Earl.\"\r\n\r\n    I don't like _either_ face of Lady Muriel. I don't\r\n    think I could talk to her; and I'm quite sure I couldn't\r\n    fall in love with her. Her dress (\"evening,\" of course) is\r\n    very pretty, I think.\r\n\r\n    I don't like the Earl's face either. He is proud of his\r\n    title, very formal, and one who would keep one \"at arm's\r\n    length\" always. And he is too prodigiously tall. I want a\r\n    gentle, genial old man; with whom one would feel at one's\r\n    ease in a moment.\r\n\r\n    (8) \"Uggug becoming Porcupine\" (\"Sylvie and Bruno,\r\n    Concluded,\" page 388), is exactly my conception of it. I\r\n    expect this will be one of the most effective pictures in\r\n    the book. The faces of the people should express intense\r\n    _terror_.\r\n\r\n    (9) \"The Professor\" is altogether _delightful_. When\r\n    you get the text, you will see that you have hit the very\r\n    centre of the bull's-eye.\r\n\r\n    [A sketch of \"Bruno\"]. No, no! Please don't give us the (to\r\n    my mind) very ugly, quite modern costume, which shows with\r\n    such cruel distinctness a podgy, pot-bellied (excuse the\r\n    vulgarism) boy, who couldn't run a mile to save his life. I\r\n    want Bruno to be _strong_, but at the same time light\r\n    and active--with the figure of one of the little acrobats\r\n    one sees at the circus--not \"Master Tommy,\" who habitually\r\n    gorges himself with pudding. Also that dress I dislike very\r\n    much. Please give him a short tunic, and _real_\r\n    knickerbockers--not the tight knee-breeches they are rapidly\r\n    shrinking to.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Furniss's kind permission I am enabled to give an example of\r\nthe other side of the correspondence, one of his letters to Mr.\r\nDodgson, all the more interesting for the charming little sketch which\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the spider, Mr. Dodgson had written: \"Some writer says\r\nthat the full face of a spider, as seen under a magnifying-glass, is\r\nvery striking.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Facsimile of a letter from H. Furniss to\r\nLewis Carroll, August 23, 1886_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sylvie and Bruno. _From a drawing by Henry\r\nHoliday_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n(1888-1891)\r\n\r\n\r\n    A systematic life--\"Memoria Technica\"--Mr. Dodgson's\r\n    shyness--\"A Lesson in Latin\"--The \"Wonderland\"\r\n    Stamp-Case--\"Wise Words about Letter-Writing\"--Princess\r\n    Alice--\"Sylvie and Bruno\"--\"The night cometh\"--\"The Nursery\r\n    'Alice'\"--Coventry Patmore--Telepathy--Resignation of Dr.\r\n    Liddell--A letter about Logic.\r\n\r\nAn old bachelor is generally very precise and exact in his habits. He\r\nhas no one but himself to look after, nothing to distract his\r\nattention from his own affairs; and Mr. Dodgson was the most precise\r\nand exact of old bachelors. He made a précis of every letter he wrote\r\nor received from the 1st of January, 1861, to the 8th of the same\r\nmonth, 1898. These précis were all numbered and entered in\r\nreference-books, and by an ingenious system of cross-numbering he was\r\nable to trace a whole correspondence, which might extend through\r\nseveral volumes. The last number entered in his book is 98,721.\r\n\r\nHe had scores of green cardboard boxes, all neatly labelled, in which\r\nhe kept his various papers. These boxes formed quite a feature of his\r\nstudy at Oxford, a large number of them being arranged upon a\r\nrevolving bookstand. The lists, of various sorts, which he kept were\r\ninnumerable; one of them, that of unanswered correspondents,\r\ngenerally held seventy or eighty names at a time, exclusive of\r\nautograph-hunters, whom he did not answer on principle. He seemed to\r\ndelight in being arithmetically accurate about every detail of life.\r\n\r\nHe always rose at the same early hour, and, if he was in residence at\r\nChrist Church, attended College Service. He spent the day according to\r\na prescribed routine, which usually included a long walk into the\r\ncountry, very often alone, but sometimes with another Don, or perhaps,\r\nif the walk was not to be as long as usual, with some little\r\ngirl-friend at his side. When he had a companion with him, he would\r\ntalk the whole time, telling delightful stories, or explaining some\r\nnew logical problem; if he was alone, he used to think out his books,\r\nas probably many another author has done and will do, in the course of\r\na lonely walk. The only irregularity noticeable in his mode of life\r\nwas the hour of retiring, which varied from 11 p.m. to four o'clock in\r\nthe morning, according to the amount of work which he felt himself in\r\nthe mood for.\r\n\r\nHe had a wonderfully good memory, except for faces and dates. The\r\nformer were always a stumbling-block to him, and people used to say\r\n(most unjustly) that he was intentionally short-sighted. One night he\r\nwent up to London to dine with a friend, whom he had only recently\r\nmet. The next morning a gentleman greeted him as he was walking. \"I\r\nbeg your pardon,\" said Mr. Dodgson, \"but you have the advantage of me.\r\nI have no remembrance of having ever seen you before this moment.\"\r\n\"That is very strange,\" the other replied, \"for I was your host last\r\nnight!\" Such little incidents as this happened more than once. To help\r\nhimself to remember dates, he devised a system of mnemonics, which he\r\ncirculated among his friends. As it has never been published, and as\r\nsome of my readers may find it useful, I reproduce it here.\r\n\r\n    My \"Memoria Technica\" is a modification of Gray's; but,\r\n    whereas he used both consonants and vowels to represent\r\n    digits, and had to content himself with a syllable of\r\n    gibberish to represent the date or whatever other number was\r\n    required, I use only consonants, and fill in with vowels _ad\r\n    libitum,_ and thus can always manage to make a real word of\r\n    whatever has to be represented.\r\n\r\n    The principles on which the necessary 20 consonants have\r\n    been chosen are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. \"b\" and \"c,\" the first two consonants in the alphabet.\r\n\r\n    2. \"d\" from \"duo,\" \"w\" from \"two.\"\r\n\r\n    3. \"t\" from \"tres,\" the other may wait awhile.\r\n\r\n    4. \"f\" from \"four,\" \"q\" from \"quattuor.\"\r\n\r\n    5. \"l\" and \"v,\" because \"l\" and \"v\" are the Roman symbols\r\n       for \"fifty\" and \"five.\"\r\n\r\n    6. \"s\" and \"x\" from \"six.\"\r\n\r\n    7. \"p\" and \"m\" from \"septem.\"\r\n\r\n    8. \"h\" from \"huit,\" and \"k\" from the Greek \"okto.\"\r\n\r\n    9. \"n\" from \"nine\"; and \"g\" because it is so like a \"9.\"\r\n\r\n    0. \"z\" and \"r\" from \"zero.\"\r\n\r\n    There is now one consonant still waiting for its digit,\r\n    viz., \"j,\" and one digit waiting for its consonant, viz.,\r\n    \"3,\" the conclusion is obvious.\r\n\r\n    The result may be tabulated thus:--\r\n\r\n      |1  |2  |3  |4  |5  |6  |7  |8  |9  |0  |\r\n\r\n      |b  |d  |t  |f  |l  |s  |p  |h  |n  |z  |\r\n      |c  |w  |j  |q  |v  |x  |m  |k  |g  |r  |\r\n\r\n    When a word has been found, whose last consonants represent\r\n    the number required, the best plan is to put it as the last\r\n    word of a rhymed couplet, so that, whatever other words in\r\n    it are forgotten, the rhyme will secure the only really\r\n    important word.\r\n\r\n    Now suppose you wish to remember the date of the discovery\r\n    of America, which is 1492; the \"1\" may be left out as\r\n    obvious; all we need is \"492.\"\r\n\r\n    Write it thus:--\r\n\r\n      4 9 2\r\n      f n d\r\n      q g w\r\n\r\n    and try to find a word that contains \"f\" or \"q,\" \"n\" or \"g,\"\r\n    \"d\" or \"w.\" A word soon suggests itself--\"found.\"\r\n\r\n    The poetic faculty must now be brought into play, and the\r\n    following couplet will soon be evolved:--\r\n\r\n      \"Columbus sailed the world around,\r\n      Until America was F O U N D.\"\r\n\r\n    If possible, invent the couplets for yourself; you will\r\n    remember them better than any others.\r\n\r\n    _June_, 1888.\r\n\r\nThe inventor found this \"Memoria Technica\" very useful in helping him\r\nto remember the dates of the different Colleges. He often, of course,\r\nhad to show his friends the sights of Oxford, and the easy way in\r\nwhich, asked or unasked, he could embellish his descriptions with\r\ndates used to surprise those who did not know how the thing was done.\r\nThe couplet for St. John's College ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n      \"They must have a bevel\r\n      To keep them so LEVEL.\"\r\n\r\nThe allusion is to the beautiful lawns, for which St. John's is\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nIn his power of remembering anecdotes, and bringing them out just at\r\nthe right moment, Mr. Dodgson was unsurpassed. A guest brought into\r\nChrist Church Common Room was usually handed over to him to be amused.\r\nHe was not a good man to tell a story to--he had always heard it\r\nbefore; but as a _raconteur_ I never met his equal. And the best\r\nof it was that his stories never grew--except in number.\r\n\r\nOne would have expected that a mind so clear and logical and definite\r\nwould have fought shy of the feminine intellect, which is generally\r\nsupposed to be deficient in those qualities; and so it is somewhat\r\nsurprising to find that by far the greater number of his friends were\r\nladies. He was quite prepared to correct them, however, when they were\r\nguilty of what seemed to him unreasoning conduct, as is shown by the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter of his to a young lady who had asked\r\nhim to try and find a place for a governess, without giving the\r\nlatter's address:--\r\n\r\n    Some of my friends are business-men, and it is pleasant to\r\n    see how methodical and careful they are in transacting any\r\n    business-matter. If, for instance, one of them were to write\r\n    to me, asking me to look out for a place for a French\r\n    governess in whom he was interested, I should be sure to\r\n    admire the care with which he would give me _her name in\r\n    full_--(in extra-legible writing if it were an unusual\r\n    name)--as well as her address. Some of my friends are not\r\n    men of business.\r\n\r\nSo many such requests were addressed to him that at one time he had a\r\ncircular letter printed, with a list of people requiring various\r\nappointments or assistants, which he sent round to his friends.\r\n\r\nIn one respect Lewis Carroll resembled the stoic philosophers, for no\r\noutward circumstance could upset the tranquillity of his mind. He\r\nlived, in fact, the life which Marcus Aurelius commends so highly, the\r\nlife of calm contentment, based on the assurance that so long as we\r\nare faithful to ourselves, no seeming evils can really harm us. But in\r\nhim there was one exception to this rule. During an argument he was\r\noften excited. The war of words, the keen and subtle conflict between\r\ntrained minds--in this his soul took delight, in this he sought and\r\nfound the joy of battle and of victory. Yet he would not allow his\r\nserenity to be ruffled by any foe whom he considered unworthy of his\r\nsteel; he refused to argue with people whom he knew to be hopelessly\r\nillogical--definitely refused, though with such tact that no wound was\r\ngiven, even to the most sensitive.\r\n\r\nHe was modest in the true sense of the term, neither overestimating\r\nnor underrating his own mental powers, and preferring to follow his\r\nown course without regarding outside criticism. \"I never read anything\r\nabout myself or my books,\" he writes in a letter to a friend; and the\r\nreason he used to give was that if the critics praised him he might\r\nbecome conceited, while, if they found fault, he would only feel hurt\r\nand angry. On October 25, 1888, he wrote in his Diary: \"I see there is\r\na leader in to-day's _Standard_ on myself as a writer; but I do\r\nnot mean to read it. It is not healthy reading, I think.\"\r\n\r\nHe hated publicity, and tried to avoid it in every way. \"Do not tell\r\nany one, if you see me in the theatre,\" he wrote once to Miss Marion\r\nTerry. On another occasion, when he was dining out at Oxford, and some\r\none, who did not know that it was a forbidden subject, turned the\r\nconversation on \"Alice in Wonderland,\" he rose suddenly and fled from\r\nthe house. I could multiply instances of this sort, but it would be\r\nunjust to his memory to insist upon the morbid way in which he\r\nregarded personal popularity. As compared with self-advertisement, it\r\nis certainly the lesser evil; but that it _is_ an evil, and a\r\nvery painful one to its possessor, Mr. Dodgson fully saw. Of course it\r\nhad its humorous side, as, for instance, when he was brought into\r\ncontact with lion-hunters, autograph-collectors, _et hoc genus\r\nomne_. He was very suspicious of unknown correspondents who\r\naddressed questions to him; in later years he either did not answer\r\nthem at all, or used a typewriter. Before he bought his typewriter, he\r\nwould get some friend to write for him, and even to sign \"Lewis\r\nCarroll\" at the end of the letter. It used to give him great amusement\r\nto picture the astonishment of the recipients of these letters, if by\r\nany chance they ever came to compare his \"autographs.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the secretary of a \"Young Ladies' Academy\" in the\r\nUnited States asked him to present some of his works to the School\r\nLibrary. The envelope was addressed to \"Lewis Carroll, Christ Church,\"\r\nan incongruity which always annoyed him intensely. He replied to the\r\nSecretary, \"As Mr. Dodgson's books are all on Mathematical subjects,\r\nhe fears that they would not be very acceptable in a school library.\"\r\n\r\nSome fourteen or fifteen years ago, the Fourth-class of the Girl's\r\nLatin School at Boston, U.S., started a magazine, and asked him if\r\nthey might call it _The Jabberwock._ He wrote in reply:--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lewis Carroll has much pleasure in giving to the editors\r\n    of the proposed magazine permission to use the title they\r\n    wish for. He finds that the Anglo-Saxon word \"wocer\" or\r\n    \"wocor\" signifies \"offspring\" or \"fruit.\" Taking \"jabber\" in\r\n    its ordinary acceptation of \"excited and voluble\r\n    discussion,\" this would give the meaning of \"the result of\r\n    much excited discussion.\" Whether this phrase will have any\r\n    application to the projected periodical, it will be for the\r\n    future historian of American literature to determine. Mr.\r\n    Carroll wishes all success to the forthcoming magazine.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward he took a great interest in the magazine, and\r\nthought very well of it. It used, I believe, to be regularly supplied\r\nto him. Only once did he express disapproval of anything it contained,\r\nand that was in 1888, when he felt it necessary to administer a rebuke\r\nfor what he thought to be an irreverent joke. The sequel is given in\r\nthe following extract from _The Jabberwock_ for June, 1888:--\r\n\r\n    A FRIEND WORTH HAVING.\r\n\r\n    _The Jabberwock_ has many friends, and perhaps a few\r\n    (very few, let us hope) enemies. But, of the former, the\r\n    friend who has helped us most on the road to success is Mr.\r\n    Lewis Carroll, the author of \"Alice in Wonderland,\" &c. Our\r\n    readers will remember his kind letter granting us permission\r\n    to use the name \"Jabberwock,\" and also giving the meaning of\r\n    that word. Since then we have received another letter from\r\n    him, in which he expresses both surprise and regret at an\r\n    anecdote which we published in an early number of our little\r\n    paper. We would assure Mr. Carroll, as well as our other\r\n    friends, that we had no intention of making light of a\r\n    serious matter, but merely quoted the anecdote to show what\r\n    sort of a book Washington's diary was.\r\n\r\n    But now a third letter from our kind friend has come,\r\n    enclosing, to our delight, a poem, \"A Lesson in Latin,\" the\r\n    pleasantest Latin lesson we have had this year.\r\n\r\n    The first two letters from Mr. Carroll were in a beautiful\r\n    literary hand, whereas the third is written with a\r\n    typewriter. It is to this fact that he refers in his letter,\r\n    which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n      \"29, Bedford Street,\r\n      Covent Garden, LONDON,\r\n\r\n      _May_ 16, 1888.\r\n\r\n      Dear Young Friends,--After the Black Draught of serious\r\n      remonstrance which I ventured to send to you the other day,\r\n      surely a Lump of Sugar will not be unacceptable? The\r\n      enclosed I wrote this afternoon on purpose for you.\r\n\r\n      I hope you will grant it admission to the columns of _The\r\n      Jabberwock_, and not scorn it as a mere play upon words.\r\n\r\n      This mode of writing, is, of course, an American invention.\r\n      We never invent new machinery here; we do but use, to the\r\n      best of our ability, the machines you send us. For the one I\r\n      am now using, I beg you to accept my best thanks, and to\r\n      believe me\r\n\r\n      Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n      Lewis Carroll.\"\r\n\r\n    Surely we can patiently swallow many Black Draughts, if we\r\n    are to be rewarded with so sweet a Lump of Sugar!\r\n\r\n    The enclosed poem, which has since been republished in\r\n    \"Three Sunsets,\" runs as follows:\r\n\r\n      A LESSON IN LATIN.\r\n\r\n      Our Latin books, in motley row,\r\n        Invite us to the task--\r\n      Gay Horace, stately Cicero;\r\n      Yet there's one verb, when once we know,\r\n        No higher skill we ask:\r\n      This ranks all other lore above--\r\n      We've learned \"amare\" means \"to love\"!\r\n\r\n      So hour by hour, from flower to flower,\r\n        We sip the sweets of life:\r\n      Till ah! too soon the clouds arise,\r\n      And knitted brows and angry eyes\r\n        Proclaim the dawn of strife.\r\n      With half a smile and half a sigh,\r\n      \"Amare! Bitter One!\" we cry.\r\n\r\n      Last night we owned, with looks forlorn,\r\n        \"Too well the scholar knows\r\n      There is no rose without a thorn \"--\r\n      But peace is made! we sing, this morn,\r\n        \"No thorn without a rose!\"\r\n      Our Latin lesson is complete:\r\n      We've learned that Love is \"Bitter-sweet\"\r\n\r\n      Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\nIn October Mr. Dodgson invented a very ingenious little stamp-case,\r\ndecorated with two \"Pictorial Surprises,\" representing the \"Cheshire\r\nCat\" vanishing till nothing but the grin was left, and the baby\r\nturning into a pig in \"Alice's\" arms. The invention was entered at\r\nStationers' Hall, and published by Messrs. Emberlin and Son, of\r\nOxford. As an appropriate accompaniment, he wrote \"Eight or Nine Wise\r\nWords on Letter-Writing,\" a little booklet which is still sold along\r\nwith the case. The \"Wise Words,\" as the following extracts show, have\r\nthe true \"Carrollian\" ring about them:--\r\n\r\n    Some American writer has said \"the snakes in this district\r\n    may be divided into one species--the venomous.\" The same\r\n    principle applies here. Postage-stamp-cases may be divided\r\n    into one species--the \"Wonderland.\"\r\n\r\n    Since I have possessed a \"Wonderland-Stamp-Case,\" Life has\r\n    been bright and peaceful, and I have used no other. I\r\n    believe the Queen's Laundress uses no other.\r\n\r\n    My fifth Rule is, if your friend makes a severe remark,\r\n    either leave it unnoticed or make your reply distinctly less\r\n    severe: and, if he makes a friendly remark, tending towards\r\n    \"making up\" the little difference that has arisen between\r\n    you, let your reply be distinctly _more_ friendly. If,\r\n    in picking a quarrel, each party declined to go more than\r\n    _three-eighths_ of the way, and if, in making friends,\r\n    each was ready to go _five-eighths_ of the way--why,\r\n    there would be more reconciliations than quarrels! Which is\r\n    like the Irishman's remonstrance to his gad-about daughter:\r\n    \"Shure, you're _always_ goin' out! You go out\r\n    _three_ times for wanst that you come in!\"\r\n\r\n    My sixth Rule is, _don't try to have the last word!_\r\n    How many a controversy would be nipped in the bud, if each\r\n    was anxious to let the _other_ have the last word!\r\n    Never mind how telling a rejoinder you leave unuttered:\r\n    never mind your friend's supposing that you are silent from\r\n    lack of anything to say: let the thing drop, as soon as it\r\n    is possible without discourtesy: remember \"Speech is\r\n    silvern, but silence is golden\"! (N.B. If you are a\r\n    gentleman, and your friend a lady, this Rule is superfluous:\r\n    _you won't get the last word!_)\r\n\r\n    Remember the old proverb, \"Cross-writing makes\r\n    cross-reading.\" \"The _old_ proverb?\" you say\r\n    inquiringly. \"_How_ old?\" Well, not so _very_\r\n    ancient, I must confess. In fact, I invented it while\r\n    writing this paragraph. Still, you know, \"old\" is a\r\n    _comparative_ term. I think you would be _quite_\r\n    justified in addressing a chicken, just out of the shell, as\r\n    \"old boy!\" _when compared_ with another chicken that\r\n    was only half-out!\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet ends with an explanation of Lewis Carroll's method of\r\nusing a correspondence-book, illustrated by a few imaginary pages from\r\nsuch a compilation, which are very humorous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Facsimile of programme of \"Alice in\r\nWonderland_.\"]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year the \"Alice\" operetta was again produced at the\r\nGlobe Theatre, with Miss Isa Bowman as the heroine. \"Isa makes a\r\ndelightful Alice,\" Mr. Dodgson writes, \"and Emsie [a younger sister]\r\nis wonderfully good as Dormouse and as Second Ghost [of an oyster!],\r\nwhen she sings a verse, and dances the Sailor's Hornpipe.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The Mad Tea-Party.\" _From a photograph by\r\nElliott & Fry_.]\r\n\r\nThe first of an incomplete series, \"Curiosa Mathematica,\" was\r\npublished for Mr. Dodgson by Messrs. Macmillan during the year. It was\r\nentitled \"A New Theory of Parallels,\" and any one taking it up for the\r\nfirst time might be tempted to ask, Is the author serious, or is he\r\nsimply giving us some _jeu d'esprit?_ A closer inspection,\r\nhowever, soon settles the question, and the reader, if mathematics be\r\nhis hobby, is carried irresistibly along till he reaches the last\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe object which Mr. Dodgson set himself to accomplish was to prove\r\nEuclid I. 32 without assuming the celebrated 12th Axiom, a feat which\r\ncalls up visions of the \"Circle-Squarers.\"\r\n\r\nThe work is divided into two parts: Book I. contains certain\r\nPropositions which require no disputable Axiom for their proof, and\r\nwhen once the few Definitions of \"amount,\" &c., have become familiar\r\nit is easy reading. In Book II. the author introduces a new Axiom, or\r\nrather \"Quasi-Axiom\"--for it's _self-evident_ character is open\r\nto dispute. This Axiom is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    In any Circle the inscribed equilateral Tetragon (Hexagon in\r\n    editions 1st and 2nd) is greater than any one of the\r\n    Segments which lie outside it.\r\n\r\nAssuming the truth of this Axiom, Mr. Dodgson proves a series of\r\nPropositions, which lead up to and enable him to accomplish the feat\r\nreferred to above.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Book II. he places a proof (so far as finite magnitudes\r\nare concerned) of Euclid's Axiom, preceded by and dependent on the\r\nAxiom that \"If two homogeneous magnitudes be both of them finite, the\r\nlesser may be so multiplied by a finite number as to exceed the\r\ngreater.\" This Axiom, he says, he believes to be assumed by every\r\nwriter who has attempted to prove Euclid's 12th Axiom. The proof\r\nitself is borrowed, with slight alterations, from Cuthbertson's\r\n\"Euclidean Geometry.\"\r\n\r\nIn Appendix I. there is an alternative Axiom which may be substituted\r\nfor that which introduces Book II., and which will probably commend\r\nitself to many minds as being more truly axiomatic. To substitute\r\nthis, however, involves some additions and alterations, which the\r\nauthor appends.\r\n\r\nAppendix II. is headed by the somewhat startling question, \"Is\r\nEuclid's Axiom true?\" and though true for finite magnitudes--the sense\r\nin which, no doubt, Euclid meant it to be taken--it is shown to be not\r\nuniversally true. In Appendix III. he propounds the question, \"How\r\nshould Parallels be defined?\"\r\n\r\nAppendix IV., which deals with the theory of Parallels as it stands\r\nto-day, concludes with the following words:--\r\n\r\n    I am inclined to believe that if ever Euclid I. 32 is proved\r\n    without a new Axiom, it will be by some new and ampler\r\n    definition of the _Right Line_--some definition which\r\n    shall connote that mysterious property, which it must\r\n    somehow possess, which causes Euclid I. 32 to be true. Try\r\n    _that_ track, my gentle reader! It is not much trodden\r\n    as yet. And may success attend your search!\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction, which, as is frequently the case, ought to be\r\nread _last_ in order to be appreciated properly, he relates his\r\nexperiences with two of those \"misguided visionaries,\" the\r\ncircle-squarers. One of them had selected 3.2 as the value for\r\n\"_pi_,\" and the other proved, to his own satisfaction at least,\r\nthat it is correctly represented by 3! The Rev. Watson Hagger, to\r\nwhose kindness, as I have already stated in my Preface, my readers are\r\nindebted for the several accounts of Mr. Dodgson's books on\r\nmathematics which appear in this Memoir, had a similar experience with\r\none of these \"cranks.\" This circle-squarer selected 3.125 as the value\r\nfor \"_pi_,\" and Mr. Hagger, who was fired with Mr. Dodgson's\r\nambition to convince his correspondent of his error, failed as\r\nsignally as Mr. Dodgson did.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is interesting as showing that, strict\r\nConservative though he was, he was not in religious matters\r\nnarrow-minded; he held his own opinions strongly, but he would never\r\ncondemn those of other people. He saw \"good in everything,\" and there\r\nwas but little exaggeration, be it said in all reverence, in the\r\nphrase which an old friend of his used in speaking of him to me: \"Mr.\r\nDodgson was as broad--as broad as _Christ_.\"\r\n\r\n     Christ Church, Oxford, _May_ 4, 1889.\r\n\r\n    Dear Miss Manners,--I hope to have a new book out very soon,\r\n    and had entered your name on the list of friends to whom\r\n    copies are to go; but, on second thoughts, perhaps you might\r\n    prefer that I should send it to your little sister (?)\r\n    (niece) Rachel, whom you mentioned in one of your letters.\r\n    It is to be called \"The Nursery Alice,\" and is meant for\r\n    very young children, consisting of coloured enlargements of\r\n    twenty of the pictures in \"Alice,\" with explanations such as\r\n    one would give in showing them to a little child.\r\n\r\n    I was much interested by your letter, telling me you belong\r\n    to the Society of Friends. Please do not think of _me_\r\n    as one to whom a \"difference of creed\" is a bar to\r\n    friendship. My sense of brother- and sisterhood is at least\r\n    broad enough to include _Christians_ of all\r\n    denominations; in fact, I have one valued friend (a lady who\r\n    seems to live to do good kind things) who is a Unitarian.\r\n\r\n    Shall I put \"Rachel Manners\" in the book?\r\n\r\n    Believe me, very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nFrom June 7th to June 10th he stayed at Hatfield.\r\n\r\n    Once at luncheon [he writes] I had the Duchess (of Albany)\r\n    as neighbour and once at breakfast, and had several other\r\n    chats with her, and found her very pleasant indeed. Princess\r\n    Alice is a sweet little girl. Her little brother (the Duke\r\n    of Albany) was entirely fascinating, a perfect little\r\n    prince, and the picture of good-humour. On Sunday afternoon\r\n    I had a pleasant half-hour with the children [Princess\r\n    Alice, the Duke of Albany, Honorable Mabel Palmer, Lady\r\n    Victoria Manners, and Lord Haddon], telling them \"Bruno's\r\n    Picnic\" and folding a fishing-boat for them. I got the\r\n    Duchess's leave to send the little Alice a copy of the\r\n    \"Nursery Alice,\" and mean to send it with \"Alice\r\n    Underground\" for herself.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year Lewis Carroll had tremendously hard work,\r\ncompleting \"Sylvie and Bruno.\" For several days on end he worked from\r\nbreakfast until nearly ten in the evening without a rest. At last it\r\nwas off his hands, and for a month or so he was (comparatively) an\r\nidle man. Some notes from his Diary, written during this period,\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 17th._--Met, for first time, an actual believer\r\n    in the \"craze\" that buying and selling are wrong (!) (he is\r\n    rather 'out of his mind'). The most curious thing was his\r\n    declaration that he himself _lives_ on that theory, and\r\n    never buys anything, and has no money! I thought of railway\r\n    travelling, and ventured to ask how he got from London to\r\n    Oxford? \"On a bicycle!\" And how he got the bicycle? \"It was\r\n    given him!\" So I was floored, and there was no time to think\r\n    of any other instances. The whole thing was so new to me\r\n    that, when he declared it to be _un-Christian_, I quite\r\n    forgot the text, \"He that hath no sword, let him sell his\r\n    garment, and buy one.\"\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 19th._--Went over to Birmingham to see a\r\n    performance of \"Alice\" (Mrs. Freiligrath Kroeker's version)\r\n    at the High School. I rashly offered to tell \"Bruno's\r\n    Picnic\" afterwards to the little children, thinking I should\r\n    have an audience of 40 or 50, mostly children, instead of\r\n    which I had to tell it from the stage to an audience of\r\n    about 280, mostly older girls and grown-up people! However,\r\n    I got some of the children to come on the stage with me, and\r\n    the little Alice (Muriel Howard-Smith, æt. 11) stood by me,\r\n    which made it less awful. The evening began with some of\r\n    \"Julius Caesar\" in German. This and \"Alice\" were really\r\n    capitally acted, the White Queen being quite the best I have\r\n    seen (Miss B. Lloyd Owen). I was introduced to Alice and a\r\n    few more, and was quite sorry to hear afterwards that the\r\n    other performers wanted to shake hands.\r\n\r\nThe publication of \"Sylvie and Bruno\" marks an epoch in its author's\r\nlife, for it was the publication of all the ideals and sentiments\r\nwhich he held most dear. It was a book with a definite purpose; it\r\nwould be more true to say with several definite purposes. For this\r\nvery reason it is not an artistic triumph as the two \"Alice\" books\r\nundoubtedly are; it is on a lower literary level, there is no unity in\r\nthe story. But from a higher standpoint, that of the Christian and the\r\nphilanthropist, the book is the best thing he ever wrote. It is a\r\nnoble effort to uphold the right, or what he thought to be the right,\r\nwithout fear of contempt or unpopularity. The influence which his\r\nearlier books had given him he was determined to use in asserting\r\nneglected truths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Late Duke of Albany. _From a photograph\r\nby Lewis Carroll._]\r\n\r\nOf course the story has other features, delightful nonsense not\r\nsurpassed by anything in \"Wonderland,\" childish prattle with all the\r\ncharm of reality about it, and pictures which may fairly be said to\r\nrival those of Sir John Tenniel. Had these been all, the book would\r\nhave been a great success. As things are, there are probably hundreds\r\nof readers who have been scared by the religious arguments and\r\npolitical discussions which make up a large part of it, and who have\r\nnever discovered that Sylvie is just as entrancing a personage as\r\nAlice when you get to know her.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the sentiment of the following poem, sent to Lewis Carroll by\r\nan anonymous correspondent, may also explain why some of \"Alice's\"\r\nlovers have given \"Sylvie\" a less warm welcome:--\r\n\r\n      TO SYLVIE.\r\n\r\n      Ah! Sylvie, winsome, wise and good!\r\n      Fain would I love thee as I should.\r\n      But, to tell the truth, my dear,--\r\n      And Sylvie loves the truth to hear,--\r\n      Though fair and pure and sweet thou art,\r\n      Thine elder sister has my heart!\r\n      I gave it her long, long ago\r\n      To have and hold; and well I know,\r\n      Brave Lady Sylvie, thou wouldst scorn\r\n      To accept a heart foresworn.\r\n\r\n      Lovers thou wilt have enow\r\n      Under many a greening bough--\r\n      Lovers yet unborn galore,\r\n      Like Alice all the wide world o'er;\r\n      But, darling, I am now too old\r\n      To change. And though I still shall hold\r\n      Thee, and that puckling sprite, thy brother,\r\n      Dear, I cannot _love_ another:\r\n      In this heart of mine I own\r\n      _She_ must ever reign alone!\r\n\r\n      _March_, 1890.\r\n\r\n      N.P.\r\n\r\nI do not know N.P.'s name and address, or I should have asked leave\r\nbefore giving publicity to the above verses. If these words meet his\r\neye, I hope he will accept my most humble apologies for the liberty I\r\nhave taken.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1894 a Baptist minister, preaching on the text,\r\n\"No man liveth to himself,\" made use of \"Sylvie and Bruno\" to enforce\r\nhis argument. After saying that he had been reading that book, he\r\nproceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A child was asked to define charity. He said it was \"givin'\r\n    away what yer didn't want yerself.\" This was some people's\r\n    idea of self-sacrifice; but it was not Christ's. Then as to\r\n    serving others in view of reward: Mr. Lewis Carroll put this\r\n    view of the subject very forcibly in his \"Sylvie and\r\n    Bruno\"--an excellent book for youth; indeed, for men and\r\n    women too. He first criticised Archdeacon Paley's definition\r\n    of virtue (which was said to be \"the doing good to mankind,\r\n    in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake of\r\n    everlasting happiness,\") and then turned to such hymns as\r\n    the following:--\r\n\r\n      Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee,\r\n      _Repaid a thousandfold shall be_,\r\n      Then gladly will we give to Thee,\r\n              Giver of all!\r\n\r\n    Mr. Carroll's comment was brief and to the point. He said:\r\n    \"Talk of Original _Sin_! Can you have a stronger proof\r\n    of the Original Goodness there must be in this nation than\r\n    the fact that Religion has been preached to us, as a\r\n    commercial speculation, for a century, and that we still\r\n    believe in a God?\" [\"Sylvie and Bruno,\" Part i., pp. 276,\r\n    277.] Of course it was quite true, as Mr. Carroll pointed\r\n    out, that our good deeds would be rewarded; but we ought to\r\n    do them because they were _good_, and not because the\r\n    reward was great.\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to \"Sylvie and Bruno,\" Lewis Carroll alluded to certain\r\neditions of Shakespeare which seemed to him unsuitable for children;\r\nit never seemed to strike him that his words might be read by\r\nchildren, and that thus his object very probably would be defeated,\r\nuntil this fact was pointed out to him in a letter from an unknown\r\ncorrespondent, Mr. J.C. Cropper, of Hampstead. Mr. Dodgson replied as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir,--Accept my best thanks for your thoughtful and\r\n    valuable suggestion about the Preface to \"Sylvie and Bruno.\"\r\n    The danger you point out had not occurred to me (I suppose I\r\n    had not thought of _children_ reading the Preface): but\r\n    it is a very real one, and I am very glad to have had my\r\n    attention called to it.\r\n\r\n    Believe me, truly yours,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\nMathematical controversy carried on by correspondence was a favourite\r\nrecreation of Mr. Dodgson's, and on February 20, 1890, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    I've just concluded a correspondence with a Cambridge man,\r\n    who is writing a Geometry on the \"Direction\" theory\r\n    (Wilson's plan), and thinks he has avoided Wilson's (what\r\n    _I_ think) fallacies. He _hasn't_, but I can't\r\n    convince him! My view of life is, that it's next to\r\n    impossible to convince _anybody_ of _anything_.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is very characteristic. \"Whatsoever thy hand\r\nfindeth to do, do it with all thy might,\" was Mr. Dodgson's rule of\r\nlife, and, as the end drew near, he only worked the harder:--\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, Oxford, _April_ 10, 1890.\r\n\r\n    My dear Atkinson,--Many and sincere thanks for your most\r\n    hospitable invitation, and for the very interesting photo of\r\n    the family group. The former I fear I must ask you to let me\r\n    defer _sine die_, and regard it as a pleasant dream,\r\n    not _quite_ hopeless of being some day realised. I keep\r\n    a list of such pleasant possibilities, and yours is now one\r\n    of ten similar kind offers of hospitality. But as life\r\n    shortens in, and the evening shadows loom in sight, one gets\r\n    to _grudge any_ time given to mere pleasure, which\r\n    might entail the leaving work half finished that one is\r\n    longing to do before the end comes.\r\n\r\n    There are several books I _greatly_ desire to get\r\n    finished for children. I am glad to find my working powers\r\n    are as good as they ever were. Even with the mathematical\r\n    book (a third edition) which I am now getting through the\r\n    press, I think nothing of working six hours at a stretch.\r\n\r\n    There is one text that often occurs to me, \"The night\r\n    cometh, when no man can work.\" Kindest regards to Mrs.\r\n    Atkinson, and love to Gertrude.\r\n\r\n    Always sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n    For the benefit of children aged \"from nought to five,\" as\r\n    he himself phrased it, Lewis Carroll prepared a nursery\r\n    edition of \"Alice.\" He shortened the text considerably, and\r\n    altered it so much that only the plot of the story remained\r\n    unchanged. It was illustrated by the old pictures, coloured\r\n    by Tenniel, and the cover was adorned by a picture designed\r\n    by Miss E. Gertrude Thomson. As usual, the Dedication takes\r\n    the form of an anagram, the solution of which is the name of\r\n    one of his later child-friends. \"_The Nursery\r\n    'Alice,_'\" was published by Macmillan and Co., in March,\r\n    1890.\r\n\r\n    On August 18th the following letter on the \"Eight Hours\r\n    Movement\" appeared in _The Standard:_--\r\n\r\n    Sir,--Supposing it were the custom, in a\r\n    certain town, to sell eggs in paper bags at so much per bag,\r\n    and that a fierce dispute had arisen between the egg vendors\r\n    and the public as to how many eggs each bag should be\r\n    understood to contain, the vendors wishing to be allowed to\r\n    make up smaller bags; and supposing the public were to say,\r\n    \"In future we will pay you so much per egg, and you can make\r\n    up bags as you please,\" would any ground remain for further\r\n    dispute?\r\n\r\n    Supposing that employers of labour, when threatened with a\r\n    \"strike\" in case they should decline to reduce the number of\r\n    hours in a working day, were to reply, \"In future we will\r\n    pay you so much per hour, and you can make up days as you\r\n    please,\" it does appear to me--being, as I confess, an\r\n    ignorant outsider--that the dispute would die out for want\r\n    of a _raison d'être_, and that these disastrous\r\n    strikes, inflicting such heavy loss on employers and\r\n    employed alike, would become things of the past.\r\n\r\n    I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the year was uneventful; a few notes from his Diary\r\nmust represent it here:--\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 4th._--Called on Mr. Coventry Patmore (at\r\n    Hastings), and was very kindly received by him, and stayed\r\n    for afternoon tea and dinner. He showed me some interesting\r\n    pictures, including a charming little drawing, by Holman\r\n    Hunt, of one of his daughters when three years old. He gave\r\n    me an interesting account of his going, by Tennyson's\r\n    request, to his lodging to look for the MS. of \"In\r\n    Memoriam,\" which he had left behind, and only finding it by\r\n    insisting on going upstairs, in spite of the landlady's\r\n    opposition, to search for it. Also he told me the story (I\r\n    think I have heard it before) of what Wordsworth told his\r\n    friends as the \"one joke\" of his life, in answer to a\r\n    passing carter who asked if he had seen his wife. \"My good\r\n    friend, I didn't even know you had a wife!\" He seems a very\r\n    hale and vigorous old man for nearly seventy, which I think\r\n    he gave as his age in writing to me.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 31st._--This morning, thinking over the problem\r\n    of finding two squares whose sum is a square, I chanced on a\r\n    theorem (which seems _true_, though I cannot prove it),\r\n    that if x² + y² be even, its half is the sum of two squares.\r\n    A kindred theorem, that 2(x² + y²) is always the sum of two\r\n    squares, also seems true and unprovable.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 5th.--_I have now proved the above two theorems.\r\n    Another pretty deduction from the theory of square numbers\r\n    is, that any number whose square is the sum of two squares,\r\n    is itself the sum of two squares.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned Mr. Dodgson's habit of thinking out problems\r\nat night. Often new ideas would occur to him during hours of\r\nsleeplessness, and he had long wanted to hear of or invent some easy\r\nmethod of taking notes in the dark. At first he tried writing within\r\noblongs cut out of cardboard, but the result was apt to be illegible.\r\nIn 1891 he conceived the device of having a series of squares cut out\r\nin card, and inventing an alphabet, of which each letter was made of\r\nlines, which could be written along the edges of the squares, and\r\ndots, which could be marked at the corners. The thing worked well, and\r\nhe named it the \"Typhlograph,\" but, at the suggestion of one of his\r\nbrother-students, this was subsequently changed into \"Nyctograph.\"\r\n\r\nHe spent the Long Vacation at Eastbourne, attending service every\r\nSunday at Christ Church, according to his usual rule.\r\n\r\n    _Sept._ 6, 1891.--At the evening service at Christ\r\n    Church a curious thing happened, suggestive of telepathy.\r\n    Before giving out the second hymn the curate read out some\r\n    notices. Meanwhile I took my hymn-book, and said to myself\r\n    (I have no idea _why_), \"It will be hymn 416,\" and I\r\n    turned to it. It was not one I recognised as having ever\r\n    heard; and, on looking at it, I said, \"It is very prosaic;\r\n    it is a very unlikely one\"--and it was really startling,\r\n    the next minute, to hear the curate announce \"Hymn 416.\"\r\n\r\nIn October it became generally known that Dean Liddell was going to\r\nresign at Christmas. This was a great blow to Mr. Dodgson, but little\r\nmitigated by the fact that the very man whom he himself would have\r\nchosen, Dr. Paget, was appointed to fill the vacant place. The old\r\nDean was very popular in College; even the undergraduates, with whom\r\nhe was seldom brought into contact, felt the magic of his commanding\r\npersonality and the charm of his gracious, old-world manner. He was a\r\nman whom, once seen, it was almost impossible to forget.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dean of Christ Church. _From a\r\nphotograph by Hill & Saunders._]\r\n\r\nShortly before the resignation of Dr. Liddell, the Duchess of Albany\r\nspent a few days at the Deanery. Mr. Dodgson was asked to meet her\r\nRoyal Highness at luncheon, but was unable to go. Princess Alice and\r\nthe little Duke of Albany, however, paid him a visit, and were\r\ninitiated in the art of making paper pistols. He promised to send the\r\nPrincess a copy of a book called \"The Fairies,\" and the children,\r\nhaving spent a happy half-hour in his rooms, returned to the Deanery.\r\nThis was one of the days which he \"marked with a white stone.\" He sent\r\na copy of \"The Nursery 'Alice'\" to the little Princess Alice, and\r\nreceived a note of thanks from her, and also a letter from her mother,\r\nin which she said that the book had taught the Princess to like\r\nreading, and to do it out of lesson-time. To the Duke he gave a copy\r\nof a book entitled \"The Merry Elves.\" In his little note of thanks for\r\nthis gift, the boy said, \"Alice and I want you to love us both.\" Mr.\r\nDodgson sent Princess Alice a puzzle, promising that if she found it\r\nout, he would give her a \"golden chair from Wonderland.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year he wrote me a long letter, which I think\r\nworthy of reproducing here, for he spent a long time over it, and it\r\ncontains excellent examples of his clear way of putting things.\r\n\r\n    _To S.D. Collingwood._\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., Oxford, _Dec_. 29, 1891.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Stuart,--(Rather a large note-sheet, isn't it? But\r\n    they do differ in size, you know.) I fancy this book of\r\n    science (which I have had a good while, without making any\r\n    use of it), may prove of some use to you, with your boys. [I\r\n    was a schoolmaster at that time.] Also this cycling-book (or\r\n    whatever it is to be called) may be useful in putting down\r\n    engagements, &c., besides telling you a lot about cycles.\r\n    There was no use in sending it to _me; my _cycling days\r\n    are over.\r\n\r\n    You ask me if your last piece of \"Meritt\" printing is dark\r\n    enough. I think not. I should say the rollers want fresh\r\n    inking. As to the _matter_ of your specimen--[it was a\r\n    poor little essay on killing animals for the purpose of\r\n    scientific recreations, _e.g._, collecting\r\n    butterflies]--I think you _cannot_ spend your time\r\n    better than in trying to set down clearly, in that\r\n    essay-form, your ideas on any subject that chances to\r\n    interest you; and _specially_ any theological subject\r\n    that strikes you in the course of your reading for Holy\r\n    Orders.\r\n\r\n    It will be most _excellent_ practice for you, against\r\n    the time when you try to compose sermons, to try thus to\r\n    realise exactly what it is you mean, and to express it\r\n    clearly, and (a much harder matter) to get into proper shape\r\n    the _reasons_ of your opinions, and to see whether they\r\n    do, or do not, tend to prove the conclusions you come to.\r\n    You have never studied technical Logic, at all, I fancy. [I\r\n    _had_, but I freely admit that the essay in question\r\n    proved that I had not then learnt to apply my principles to\r\n    practice.] It would have been a great help: but still it is\r\n    not indispensable: after all, it is only the putting into\r\n    rules of the way in which _every_ mind proceeds, when\r\n    it draws valid conclusions; and, by practice in careful\r\n    thinking, you may get to know \"fallacies\" when you meet with\r\n    them, without knowing the formal _rules_.\r\n\r\n    At present, when you try to give _reasons_, you are in\r\n    considerable danger of propounding fallacies. Instances\r\n    occur in this little essay of yours; and I hope it won't\r\n    offend your _amour propre_ very much, if an old uncle,\r\n    who has studied Logic for forty years, makes a few remarks\r\n    on it.\r\n\r\n    I am not going to enter _at all_ on the subject-matter\r\n    itself, or to say whether I agree, or not, with your\r\n    _conclusions_: but merely to examine, from a\r\n    logic-lecturer's point of view, your _premisses_ as\r\n    relating to them.\r\n\r\n    (1) \"As the lower animals do not appear to have personality\r\n    or individual existence, I cannot see that any particular\r\n    one's life can be very important,\" &c. The word\r\n    \"personality\" is very vague: I don't know what you mean by\r\n    it. If you were to ask yourself, \"What test should I use in\r\n    distinguishing what _has_, from what has _not_,\r\n    personality?\" you might perhaps be able to express your\r\n    meaning more clearly. The phrase \"individual existence\" is\r\n    clear enough, and is in direct logical contradiction to the\r\n    phrase \"particular one.\" To say, of anything, that it has\r\n    _not_ \"individual existence,\" and yet that it _is_\r\n    a \"particular one,\" involves the logical fallacy called a\r\n    \"contradiction in terms.\"\r\n\r\n    (2) \"In both cases\" (animal and plant) \"death is only the\r\n    conversion of matter from one form to another.\" The word\r\n    \"form\" is very vague--I fancy you use it in a sort of\r\n    _chemical_ sense (like saying \"sugar is starch in\r\n    another form,\" where the change in nature is generally\r\n    believed to be a rearrangement of the very same atoms). If\r\n    you mean to assert that the difference between a live animal\r\n    and a dead animal, _i.e.,_ between animate and\r\n    sensitive matter, and the same matter when it becomes\r\n    inanimate and insensitive, is a mere rearrangement of the\r\n    same atoms, your premiss is intelligible. (It is a bolder\r\n    one than any biologists have yet advanced. The most\r\n    sceptical of them admits, I believe, that \"vitality\" is a\r\n    thing _per se. _However, that is beside my present\r\n    scope.) But this premiss is advanced to prove that it is of\r\n    no \"consequence\" to kill an animal. But, granting that the\r\n    conversion of sensitive into insensitive matter (and of\r\n    course _vice versa_) is a mere change of \"form,\" and\r\n    _therefore_ of no \"consequence\"; granting this, we\r\n    cannot escape the including under this rule all similar\r\n    cases. If the _power_ of feeling pain, and the\r\n    _absence_ of that power, are only a difference of\r\n    \"form,\" the conclusion is inevitable that the _feeling_\r\n    pain, and the _not_ feeling it, are _also_ only a\r\n    difference in form, _i.e.,_ to convert matter, which is\r\n    _not_ feeling pain, into matter _feeling_ pain, is\r\n    only to change its \"form,\" and, if the process of \"changing\r\n    form\" is of no \"consequence\" in the case of sensitive and\r\n    insensitive matter, we must admit that it is _also_ of\r\n    no \"consequence\" in the case of pain-feeling and _not_\r\n    pain-feeling matter. This conclusion, I imagine, you neither\r\n    intended nor foresaw. The premiss, which you use, involves\r\n    the fallacy called \"proving too much.\"\r\n\r\n    The best advice that could be given to you, when you begin\r\n    to compose sermons, would be what an old friend once gave to\r\n    a young man who was going out to be an Indian judge (in\r\n    India, it seems, the judge decides things, without a jury,\r\n    like our County Court judges). \"Give _your decisions_\r\n    boldly and clearly; they will probably be _right_. But\r\n    do _not_ give your _reasons: they_ will probably\r\n    be _wrong\"_ If your lot in life is to be in a\r\n    _country_ parish, it will perhaps not matter\r\n    _much_ whether the reasons given in your sermons do or\r\n    do not prove your conclusions. But even there you\r\n    _might_ meet, and in a town congregation you would be\r\n    _sure_ to meet, clever sceptics, who know well how to\r\n    argue, who will detect your fallacies and point them out to\r\n    those who are _not_ yet troubled with doubts, and thus\r\n    undermine _all_ their confidence in your teaching.\r\n\r\n    At Eastbourne, last summer, I heard a preacher advance the\r\n    astounding argument, \"We believe that the Bible is true,\r\n    because our holy Mother, the Church, tells us it is.\" I pity\r\n    that unfortunate clergyman if ever he is bold enough to\r\n    enter any Young Men's Debating Club where there is some\r\n    clear-headed sceptic who has heard, or heard of, that\r\n    sermon. I can fancy how the young man would rub his hands,\r\n    in delight, and would say to himself, \"Just see me get him\r\n    into a corner, and convict him of arguing in a circle!\"\r\n\r\n    The bad logic that occurs in many and many a well-meant\r\n    sermon, is a real danger to modern Christianity. When\r\n    detected, it may seriously injure many believers, and fill\r\n    them with miserable doubts. So my advice to you, as a young\r\n    theological student, is \"Sift your reasons _well_, and,\r\n    before you offer them to others, make sure that they prove\r\n    your conclusions.\"\r\n\r\n    I hope you won't give this letter of mine (which it has cost\r\n    me some time and thought to write) just a single reading and\r\n    then burn it; but that you will lay it aside. Perhaps, even\r\n    years hence, it may be of some use to you to read it again.\r\n\r\n    Believe me always\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate Uncle,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n(1892-1896)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dodgson resigns the Curatorship--Bazaars--He lectures to\r\n    children--A mechanical \"Humpty Dumpty\"--A logical\r\n    controversy--Albert Chevalier--\"Sylvie and Bruno\r\n    Concluded\"--\"Pillow Problems\"--Mr. Dodgson's\r\n    generosity--College services--Religious difficulties--A\r\n    village sermon--Plans for the future--Reverence--\"Symbolic\r\n    Logic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Christ Church, as at other Colleges, the Common Room is an\r\nimportant feature. Open from eight in the morning until ten at night,\r\nit takes the place of a club, where the \"dons\" may see the newspapers,\r\ntalk, write letters, or enjoy a cup of tea. After dinner, members of\r\nHigh Table, with their guests if any are present, usually adjourn to\r\nthe Common Room for wine and dessert, while there is a smoking-room\r\nhard by for those who do not despise the harmless but unnecessary\r\nweed, and below are cellars, with a goodly store of choice old wines.\r\n\r\nThe Curator's duties were therefore sufficiently onerous. They were\r\ndoubly so in Mr. Dodgson's case, for his love of minute accuracy\r\ngreatly increased the amount of work he had to do. It was his office\r\nto select and purchase wines, to keep accounts, to adjust selling\r\nprice to cost price, to see that the two Common Room servants\r\nperformed their duties, and generally to look after the comfort and\r\nconvenience of the members.\r\n\r\n\"Having heard,\" he wrote near the end of the year 1892, \"that Strong\r\nwas willing to be elected (as Curator), and Common Room willing to\r\nelect him, I most gladly resigned. The sense of relief at being free\r\nfrom the burdensome office, which has cost me a large amount of time\r\nand trouble, is very delightful. I was made Curator, December 8, 1882,\r\nso that I have held the office more than nine years.\"\r\n\r\nThe literary results of his Curatorship were three very interesting\r\nlittle pamphlets, \"Twelve Months in a Curatorship, by One who has\r\ntried it\"; \"Three years in a Curatorship, by One whom it has tried\";\r\nand \"Curiosissima Curatoria, by 'Rude Donatus,'\" all printed for\r\nprivate circulation, and couched in the same serio-comic vein. As a\r\nlogician he naturally liked to see his thoughts in print, for, just as\r\nthe mathematical mind craves for a black-board and a piece of chalk,\r\nso the logical mind must have its paper and printing-press wherewith\r\nto set forth its deductions effectively.\r\n\r\nA few extracts must suffice to show the style of these pamphlets, and\r\nthe opportunity offered for the display of humour.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of the prices at which wines were to be sold to\r\nmembers of Common Room, he found a fine scope for the exercise of his\r\nmathematical talents and his sense of proportion. In one of the\r\npamphlets he takes old Port and Chablis as illustrations.\r\n\r\n    The original cost of each is about 3s. a bottle; but the\r\n    present value of the old Port is about 11s. a bottle. Let us\r\n    suppose, then, that we have to sell to Common Room one\r\n    bottle of old Port and three of Chablis, the original cost\r\n    of the whole being 12s., and the present value 20s. These\r\n    are our data. We have now two questions to answer. First,\r\n    what sum shall we ask for the whole? Secondly, how shall we\r\n    apportion that sum between the two kinds of wine?\r\n\r\nThe sum to be asked for the whole he decides, following precedent, is\r\nto be the present market-value of the wine; as to the second question,\r\nhe goes on to say--\r\n\r\n    We have, as so often happens in the lives of distinguished\r\n    premiers, three courses before us: (1) to charge the\r\n    _present_ value for each kind of wine; (2) to put on a\r\n    certain percentage to the _original_ value of each\r\n    kind; (3) to make a compromise between these two courses.\r\n\r\n    Course 1 seems to me perfectly reasonable; but a very\r\n    plausible objection has been made to it--that it puts a\r\n    prohibitory price on the valuable wines, and that they would\r\n    remain unconsumed. This would not, however, involve any loss\r\n    to our finances; we could obviously realise the enhanced\r\n    values of the old wines by selling them to outsiders, if the\r\n    members of Common Room would not buy them. But I do not\r\n    advocate this course.\r\n\r\n    Course 2 would lead to charging 5s. a bottle for Port and\r\n    Chablis alike. The Port-drinker would be \"in clover,\" while\r\n    the Chablis-drinker would probably begin getting his wine\r\n    direct from the merchant instead of from the Common Room\r\n    cellar, which would be a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the\r\n    tariff. Yet I have heard this course advocated, repeatedly,\r\n    as an abstract principle. \"You ought to consider the\r\n    _original_ value only,\" I have been told. \"You ought to\r\n    regard the Port-drinker as a private individual, who has\r\n    laid the wine in for himself, and who ought to have all the\r\n    advantages of its enhanced value. You cannot fairly ask him\r\n    for more than what you need to refill the bins with Port,\r\n    _plus_ the percentage thereon needed to meet the\r\n    contingent expenses.\" I have listened to such arguments, but\r\n    have never been convinced that the course is just. It seems\r\n    to me that the 8s. additional value which the bottle of Port\r\n    has acquired, is the property of _Common Room_, and\r\n    that Common Room has the power to give it to whom it\r\n    chooses; and it does not seem to me fair to give it all to\r\n    the Port-drinker. What merit is there in preferring Port to\r\n    Chablis, that could justify our selling the Port-drinker his\r\n    wine at less than half what he would have to give outside,\r\n    and charging the Chablis-drinker five-thirds of what he\r\n    would have to give outside? At all events, I, as a\r\n    Port-drinker, do not wish to absorb the whole advantage, and\r\n    would gladly share it with the Chablis-drinker. The course I\r\n    recommend is\r\n\r\n    Course 3, which is a compromise between 1 and 2, its\r\n    essential principle being to sell the new wines _above_\r\n    their value, in order to be able to sell the old\r\n    _below_ their value. And it is clearly desirable, as\r\n    far as possible, to make the reductions _where they will\r\n    be felt,_ and the additions _where they will not be\r\n    felt._ Moreover it seems to me that reduction is most\r\n    felt where it _goes down to the next round sum,_ and an\r\n    addition in the reverse case, _i.e.,_ when it _starts\r\n    from a round sum._ Thus, if we were to take 2d. off a 5s.\r\n    8d. wine, and add it to a 4s. 4d.--thus selling them at 5s.\r\n    6d. and 4s. 6d. the reduction would be welcomed, and the\r\n    addition unnoticed; and the change would be a popular one.\r\n\r\nThe next extract shows with what light-hearted frivolity he could\r\napproach this tremendous subject of wine:--\r\n\r\n    The consumption of Madeira (B) has been during the past\r\n    year, zero. After careful calculation I estimate that, if\r\n    this rate of consumption be steadily maintained, our present\r\n    stock will last us an infinite number of years. And although\r\n    there may be something monotonous and dreary in the prospect\r\n    of such vast cycles spent in drinking second-class Madeira,\r\n    we may yet cheer ourselves with the thought of how\r\n    economically it can be done.\r\n\r\nTo assist the Curator in the discharge of his duties, there was a Wine\r\nCommittee, and for its guidance a series of rules was drawn up. The\r\nfirst runs as follows: \"There shall be a Wine Committee, consisting of\r\nfive persons, including the Curator, whose duty it shall be to assist\r\nthe Curator in the management of the cellar.\" \"Hence,\" wrote Mr.\r\nDodgson, \"logically it is the bounden duty of the Curator 'to assist\r\nhimself.' I decline to say whether this clause has ever brightened\r\nexistence for me--or whether, in the shades of evening, I may ever\r\nhave been observed leaving the Common Room cellars with a small but\r\nsuspicious-looking bundle, and murmuring, 'Assist thyself, assist\r\nthyself!'\"\r\n\r\nEvery Christmas at Christ Church the children of the College servants\r\nhave a party in the Hall. This year he was asked to entertain them,\r\nand gladly consented to do so. He hired a magic lantern and a large\r\nnumber of slides, and with their help told the children the three\r\nfollowing stories: (1) \"The Epiphany\"; (2) \"The Children Lost in the\r\nBush\"; (3) \"Bruno's Picnic.\"\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the services held in Christ Church for the\r\nCollege servants, at which Mr. Dodgson used frequently to preach. The\r\nway in which he regarded this work is very characteristic of the man.\r\n\"Once more,\" he writes, \"I have to thank my Heavenly Father for the\r\ngreat blessing and privilege of being allowed to speak for Him! May He\r\nbless my words to help some soul on its heavenward way.\" After one of\r\nthese addresses he received a note from a member of the congregation,\r\nthanking him for what he had said. \"It is very sweet,\" he said, \"to\r\nget such words now and then; but there is danger in them if more such\r\ncome, I must beg for silence.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the year Mr. Dodgson wrote the following letter to the Rev.\r\nC.A. Goodhart, Rector of Lambourne, Essex:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir,--Your kind, sympathising and most encouraging\r\n    letter about \"Sylvie and Bruno\" has deserved a better\r\n    treatment from me than to have been thus kept waiting more\r\n    than two years for an answer. But life is short; and one has\r\n    many other things to do; and I have been for years almost\r\n    hopelessly in arrears in correspondence. I keep a register,\r\n    so that letters which I intend to answer do somehow come to\r\n    the front at last.\r\n\r\n    In \"Sylvie and Bruno\" I took courage to introduce what I had\r\n    entirely avoided in the two \"Alice\" books--some reference to\r\n    subjects which are, after all, the _only_ subjects of real\r\n    interest in life, subjects which are so intimately bound up\r\n    with every topic of human interest that it needs more effort\r\n    to avoid them than to touch on them; and I felt that such a\r\n    book was more suitable to a clerical writer than one of mere\r\n    fun.\r\n\r\n    I hope I have not offended many (evidently I have not\r\n    offended _you_) by putting scenes of mere fun, and talk\r\n    about God, into the same book.\r\n\r\n    Only one of all my correspondents ever guessed there was\r\n    more to come of the book. She was a child, personally\r\n    unknown to me, who wrote to \"Lewis Carroll\" a sweet letter\r\n    about the book, in which she said, \"I'm so glad it hasn't\r\n    got a regular wind-up, as it shows there is more to come!\"\r\n\r\n    There is indeed \"more to come.\" When I came to piece\r\n    together the mass of accumulated material I found it was\r\n    quite _double_ what could be put into one volume. So I\r\n    divided it in the middle; and I hope to bring out \"Sylvie\r\n    and Bruno Concluded\" next Christmas--if, that is, my\r\n    Heavenly Master gives me the time and the strength for the\r\n    task; but I am nearly 60, and have no right to count on\r\n    years to come.\r\n\r\n    In signing my real name, let me beg you not to let the\r\n    information go further--I have an _intense_ dislike to\r\n    personal publicity; and, the more people there are who know\r\n    nothing of \"Lewis Carroll\" save his books, the happier I am.\r\n\r\n    Believe me, sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    Charles L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nI have made no attempt to chronicle all the games and puzzles which\r\nLewis Carroll invented. A list of such as have been published will be\r\nfound in the Bibliographical chapter. He intended to bring out a book\r\nof \"Original Games and Puzzles,\" with illustrations by Miss E.\r\nGertrude Thomson. The MS. was, I believe, almost complete before his\r\ndeath, and one, at least, of the pictures had been drawn. On June 30th\r\nhe wrote in his Diary, \"Invented what I think is a new kind of riddle.\r\nA Russian had three sons. The first, named Rab, became a lawyer; the\r\nsecond, Ymra, became a soldier; the third became a sailor. What was\r\nhis name?\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter written to a child-friend, Miss E. Drury,\r\nillustrates Lewis Carroll's hatred of bazaars:--\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., Oxford, _Nov_. 10, 1892.\r\n\r\n    My dear Emmie,--I object to _all_ bazaars on the general\r\n    principle that they are very undesirable schools for young\r\n    ladies, in which they learn to be \"too fast\" and forward,\r\n    and are more exposed to undesirable acquaintances than in\r\n    ordinary society. And I have, besides that, special\r\n    objections to bazaars connected with charitable or religious\r\n    purposes. It seems to me that they desecrate the religious\r\n    object by their undesirable features, and that they take the\r\n    reality out of all charity by getting people to think that\r\n    they are doing a good action, when their true motive is\r\n    amusement for themselves. Ruskin has put all this far better\r\n    than I can possibly do, and, if I can find the passage, and\r\n    find the time to copy it, I will send it you. But _time_ is\r\n    a very scarce luxury for me!\r\n\r\n    Always yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nIn his later years he used often to give lectures on various subjects\r\nto children. He gave a series on \"Logic\" at the Oxford Girls' High\r\nSchool, but he sometimes went further afield, as in the following\r\ninstance:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Went, as arranged with Miss A. Ottley, to the High School at\r\n    Worcester, on a visit. At half-past three I had an audience\r\n    of about a hundred little girls, aged, I should think, from\r\n    about six to fourteen. I showed them two arithmetic puzzles\r\n    on the black-board, and told them \"Bruno's Picnic.\" At\r\n    half-past seven I addressed some serious words to a second\r\n    audience of about a hundred elder girls, probably from\r\n    fifteen to twenty--an experience of the deepest interest to\r\n    me.\r\n\r\nThe illustration on the next page will be best explained by the\r\nfollowing letter which I have received from Mr. Walter Lindsay, of\r\nPhiladelphia, U.S.:--\r\n\r\n    Phila., _September_ 12, 1898.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir,--I shall be very glad to furnish what information\r\n    I can with respect to the \"Mechanical Humpty Dumpty\" which I\r\n    constructed a few years ago, but I must begin by\r\n    acknowledging that, in one sense at least, I did not\r\n    \"invent\" the figure. The idea was first put into my head by\r\n    an article in the _Cosmopolitan_, somewhere about 1891, I\r\n    suppose, describing a similar contrivance. As a devoted\r\n    admirer of the \"Alice\" books, I determined to build a Humpty\r\n    Dumpty of my own; but I left the model set by the author of\r\n    the article mentioned, and constructed the figure on\r\n    entirely different lines. In the first place, the figure as\r\n    described in the magazine had very few movements, and not\r\n    very satisfactory ones at that; and in the second place, no\r\n    attempt whatever was made to reproduce, even in a general\r\n    way, the well-known appearance of Tenniel's drawing. Humpty,\r\n    when completed, was about two feet and a half high. His\r\n    face, of course, was white; the lower half of the egg was\r\n    dressed in brilliant blue. His stockings were grey, and the\r\n    famous cravat orange, with a zigzag pattern in blue. I am\r\n    sorry to say that the photograph hardly does him justice;\r\n    but he had travelled to so many different places during his\r\n    career, that he began to be decidedly out of shape before he\r\n    sat for his portrait.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Mechanical \"Humpty Dumpty.\"\r\n    _From a photograph._]\r\n\r\n    When Humpty was about to perform, a short \"talk\" was usually\r\n    given before the curtain rose, explaining the way in which\r\n    the Sheep put the egg on the shelf at the back of the little\r\n    shop, and how Alice went groping along to it. And then, just\r\n    as the explanation had reached the opening of the chapter on\r\n    Humpty Dumpty, the curtain rose, and Humpty was discovered,\r\n    sitting on the wall, and gazing into vacancy. As soon as the\r\n    audience had had time to recover, Alice entered, and the\r\n    conversation was carried on just as it is in the book.\r\n    Humpty Dumpty gesticulated with his arms, rolled his eyes,\r\n    raised his eyebrows, frowned, turned up his nose in scorn at\r\n    Alice's ignorance, and smiled from ear to ear when he shook\r\n    hands with her. Besides this, his mouth kept time with his\r\n    words all through the dialogue, which added very greatly to\r\n    his life-like appearance.\r\n\r\n    The effect of his huge face, as it changed from one\r\n    expression to another, was ludicrous in the extreme, and we\r\n    were often obliged to repeat sentences in the conversation\r\n    (to \"go back to the last remark but one\") because the\r\n    audience laughed so loudly over Humpty Dumpty's expression\r\n    of face that they drowned what he was trying to say. The\r\n    funniest effect was the change from the look of\r\n    self-satisfied complacency with which he accompanied the\r\n    words: \"The king has promised me--\" to that of towering rage\r\n    when Alice innocently betrays her knowledge of the secret.\r\n    At the close of the scene, when Alice has vainly endeavoured\r\n    to draw him into further conversation, and at last walks\r\n    away in disgust, Humpty loses his balance on the wall,\r\n    recovers himself, totters again, and then falls off\r\n    backwards; at the same time a box full of broken glass is\r\n    dropped on the floor behind the scenes, to represent the\r\n    \"heavy crash,\" which \"shook the forest from end to\r\n    end\";--and the curtain falls.\r\n\r\n    Now, as to how it was all done. Humpty was made of barrel\r\n    hoops, and covered with stiff paper and muslin. His eyes\r\n    were round balls of rags, covered with muslin, drawn\r\n    smoothly, and with the pupil and iris marked on the front.\r\n    These eyes were pivoted to a board, fastened just behind the\r\n    eye-openings in the face. To the eyeballs were sewed strong\r\n    pieces of tape, which passed through screw-eyes on the edges\r\n    of the board, and so down to a row of levers which were\r\n    hinged in the lower part of the figure. One lever raised\r\n    both eyes upward, another moved them both to the left, and\r\n    so on. The eyebrows were of worsted and indiarubber knitted\r\n    together. They were fastened at the ends, and raised and\r\n    lowered by fine white threads passing through small holes in\r\n    the face, and also operated by levers. The arms projected\r\n    into the interior of the machine, and the gestures were made\r\n    by moving the short ends inside. The right hand contained a\r\n    spring clothes-pin, by which he was enabled to hold the\r\n    note-book in which Alice set down the celebrated problem--\r\n\r\n        365\r\n          1\r\n        ___\r\n        364\r\n\r\n    The movement of the mouth, in talking, was produced by a\r\n    long tape, running down to a pedal, which was controlled by\r\n    the foot of the performer. And the smile consisted of long\r\n    strips of red tape, which were drawn out through slits at\r\n    the corners of the mouth by means of threads which passed\r\n    through holes in the sides of the head. The performer--who\r\n    was always your humble servant--stood on a box behind the\r\n    wall, his head just reaching the top of the egg, which was\r\n    open all the way up the back. At the lower end of the\r\n    figure, convenient to the hands of the performer, was the\r\n    row of levers, like a little keyboard; and by striking\r\n    different chords on the keys, any desired expression could\r\n    be produced on the face.\r\n\r\n    Of course, a performance of this kind without a good Alice\r\n    would be unutterably flat; but the little girl who played\r\n    opposite to Humpty, Miss Nellie K---, was so exactly the\r\n    counterpart of Alice, both in appearance and disposition,\r\n    that most children thought she was the original, right out\r\n    of the book.\r\n\r\n    Humpty still exists, but he has not seen active life for\r\n    some years. His own popularity was the cause of his\r\n    retirement; for having given a number of performances (for\r\n    Charity, of course), and delighted many thousands of\r\n    children of all ages, the demands upon his time, from\r\n    Sunday-schools and other institutions, became so numerous\r\n    that the performers were obliged to withdraw him in\r\n    self-defence. He was a great deal of trouble to build, but\r\n    the success he met with and the pleasure he gave more than\r\n    repaid me for the bother; and I am sure that any one else\r\n    who tries it will reach the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    Walter Lindsay.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1893 a fierce logical battle was being waged\r\nbetween Lewis Carroll and Mr. Cook Wilson, Professor of Logic at\r\nOxford. The Professor, in spite of the countless arguments that Mr.\r\nDodgson hurled at his head, would not confess that he had committed a\r\nfallacy.\r\n\r\nOn February 5th the Professor appears to have conceded a point, for\r\nMr. Dodgson writes: \"Heard from Cook Wilson, who has long declined to\r\nread a paper which I sent January 12th, and which seems to me to prove\r\nthe fallacy of a view of his about Hypotheticals. He now offers to\r\nread it, if _I_ will study a proof he sent, that another problem\r\nof mine had contradictory _data_. I have accepted his offer, and\r\nstudied and answered his paper. So I now look forward hopefully to the\r\nresult of his reading mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe hopes which he entertained were doomed to be disappointed; the\r\ncontroversy bore no fruits save a few pamphlets and an enormous amount\r\nof correspondence, and finally the two antagonists had to agree to\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\nAs a rule Mr. Dodgson was a stern opponent of music-halls and\r\nmusic-hall singers; but he made one or two exceptions with regard to\r\nthe latter. For Chevalier he had nothing but praise; he heard him at\r\none of his recitals, for he never in his life entered a \"Variety\r\nTheatre.\" I give the passage from his Diary:--\r\n\r\n    Went to hear Mr. Albert Chevalier's Recital. I only knew of\r\n    him as being now recognised as _facile princeps_ among\r\n    music-hall singers, and did not remember that I had seen him\r\n    twice or oftener on the stage--first as \"Mr. Hobbs\" in\r\n    \"Little Lord Fauntleroy,\" and afterwards as a \"horsy\" young\r\n    man in a _matinée_ in which Violet Vanbrugh appeared. He was\r\n    decidedly _good_ as an actor; but as a comic singer (with\r\n    considerable powers of pathos as well) he is quite\r\n    first-rate. His chief merit seems to be the earnestness with\r\n    which he throws himself into the work. The songs (mostly his\r\n    own writing) were quite inoffensive, and very funny. I am\r\n    very glad to be able to think that his influence on public\r\n    taste is towards refinement and purity. I liked best \"The\r\n    Future Mrs. 'Awkins,\" with its taking tune, and \"My Old\r\n    Dutch,\" which revealed powers that, I should think, would\r\n    come out grandly in Robsonian parts, such as \"The Porter's\r\n    Knot.\" \"The Little Nipper\" was also well worth hearing.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodgson's views on Sunday Observance were old-fashioned, but he\r\nlived up to them, and did not try to force them upon people with whose\r\nactions he had no concern. They were purely matters of \"private\r\nopinion\" with him. On October 2nd he wrote to Miss E.G. Thomson, who\r\nwas illustrating his \"Three Sunsets\":--\r\n\r\n    Would you kindly do _no_ sketches, or photos, for\r\n    _me_, on a Sunday? It is, in _my_ view (of\r\n    _course_ I don't condemn any one who differs from me)\r\n    inconsistent with keeping the day holy. I do _not_ hold\r\n    it to be the Jewish \"Sabbath,\" but I _do_ hold it to be\r\n    \"the Lord's Day,\" and so to be made very distinct from the\r\n    other days.\r\n\r\nIn December, the Logical controversy being over for a time, Mr.\r\nDodgson invented a new problem to puzzle his mathematical friends\r\nwith, which was called \"The Monkey and Weight Problem.\" A rope is\r\nsupposed to be hung over a wheel fixed to the roof of a building; at\r\none end of the rope a weight is fixed, which exactly counterbalances a\r\nmonkey which is hanging on to the other end. Suppose that the monkey\r\nbegins to climb the rope, what will be the result? The following\r\nextract from the Diary illustrates the several possible answers which\r\nmay be given:--\r\n\r\n    Got Professor Clifton's answer to the \"Monkey and Weight\r\n    Problem.\" It is very curious, the different views taken by\r\n    good mathematicians. Price says the weight goes _up_, with\r\n    increasing velocity; Clifton (and Harcourt) that it goes\r\n    _up_, at the same rate as the monkey; while Sampson says\r\n    that it goes _down_.\r\n\r\nOn December 24th Mr. Dodgson received the first twelve copies of\r\n\"Sylvie and Bruno Concluded,\" just about four years after the\r\nappearance of the first part of the story. In this second volume the\r\ntwo fairy children are as delightful as ever; it also contains what I\r\nthink most people will agree to be the most beautiful poem Lewis\r\nCarroll ever wrote, \"Say, what is the spell, when her fledglings are\r\ncheeping?\" (p. 305). In the preface he pays a well-deserved compliment\r\nto Mr. Harry Furniss for his wonderfully clever pictures; he also\r\nexplains how the book was written, showing that many of the amusing\r\nremarks of Bruno had been uttered by real children. He makes\r\nallusion to two books, which only his death prevented him from\r\nfinishing--\"Original Games and Puzzles,\" and a paper on \"Sport,\"\r\nviewed from the standpoint of the humanitarian. From a literary point\r\nof view the second volume of \"Sylvie and Bruno\" lacks unity; a fairy\r\ntale is all very well, and a novel also is all very well, but the\r\ncombination of the two is surely a mistake. However, the reader who\r\ncares more for the spirit than the letter will not notice this\r\nblemish; to him \"Sylvie and Bruno Concluded\" will be interesting and\r\nhelpful, as the revelation of a very beautiful personality.\r\n\r\n    You have made everything turn out just as I should have\r\n    chosen [writes a friend to whom he had sent a copy], and\r\n    made right all that disappointed me in the first part. I\r\n    have not only to thank you for writing an interesting book,\r\n    but for writing a helpful one too. I am sure that \"Sylvie\r\n    and Bruno\" has given me many thoughts that will help me all\r\n    life through. One cannot know \"Sylvie\" without being the\r\n    better for it. You may say that \"Mister Sir\" is not\r\n    consciously meant to be yourself, but I cannot help feeling\r\n    that he is. As \"Mister Sir\" talks, I hear your voice in\r\n    every word. I think, perhaps, that is why I like the book so\r\n    much.\r\n\r\nI have received an interesting letter from Mr. Furniss, bearing upon\r\nthe subject of \"Sylvie and Bruno,\" and Lewis Carroll's methods of\r\nwork. The letter runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I have illustrated stories of most of our leading authors,\r\n    and I can safely say that Lewis Carroll was the only one who\r\n    cared to understand the illustrations to his own book. He\r\n    was the W. S. Gilbert for children, and, like Gilbert\r\n    producing one of his operas, Lewis Carroll took infinite\r\n    pains to study every detail in producing his extraordinary\r\n    and delightful books. Mr. Gilbert, as every one knows, has a\r\n    model of the stage; he puts up the scenery, draws every\r\n    figure, moves them about just as he wishes the real actors\r\n    to move about. Lewis Carroll was precisely the same. This,\r\n    of course, led to a great deal of work and trouble, and made\r\n    the illustrating of his books more a matter of artistic\r\n    interest than of professional profit. I was _seven years_\r\n    illustrating his last work, and during that time I had the\r\n    pleasure of many an interesting meeting with the fascinating\r\n    author, and I was quite repaid for the trouble I took, not\r\n    only by his generous appreciation of my efforts, but by the\r\n    liberal remuneration he gave for the work, and also by the\r\n    charm of having intercourse with the interesting, if\r\n    somewhat erratic genius.\r\n\r\nA book very different in character from \"Sylvie and Bruno,\" but under\r\nthe same well-known pseudonym, appeared about the same time. I refer\r\nto \"Pillow Problems,\" the second part of the series entitled \"Curiosa\r\nMathematica.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pillow Problems thought out during wakeful hours\" is a collection of\r\nmathematical problems, which Mr. Dodgson solved while lying awake at\r\nnight. A few there are to which the title is not strictly applicable,\r\nbut all alike were worked out mentally before any diagram or word of\r\nthe solution was committed to paper.\r\n\r\nThe author says that his usual practice was to write down the\r\n_answer_ first of all, and afterwards the question and its\r\nsolution. His motive, he says, for publishing these problems was not\r\nfrom any desire to display his powers of mental calculation. Those who\r\nknew him will readily believe this, though they will hardly be\r\ninclined to accept his own modest estimate of those powers.\r\n\r\nStill the book was intended, not for the select few who can scale the\r\nmountain heights of advanced mathematics, but for the much larger\r\nclass of ordinary mathematicians, and they at least will be able to\r\nappreciate the gifted author, and to wonder how he could follow so\r\nclearly in his head the mental diagrams and intricate calculations\r\ninvolved in some of these \"Pillow Problems.\"\r\n\r\nHis chief motive in publishing the book was to show how, by a little\r\ndetermination, the mind \"can be made to concentrate itself on some\r\nintellectual subject (not necessarily mathematics), and thus banish\r\nthose petty troubles and vexations which most people experience, and\r\nwhich--unless the mind be otherwise occupied--_will_ persist in\r\ninvading the hours of night.\" And this remedy, as he shows, serves a\r\nhigher purpose still. In a paragraph which deserves quoting at length,\r\nas it gives us a momentary glimpse of his refined and beautiful\r\ncharacter, he says:--\r\n\r\n    Perhaps I may venture for a moment to use a more serious\r\n    tone, and to point out that there are mental troubles, much\r\n    worse than mere worry, for which an absorbing object of\r\n    thought may serve as a remedy. There are sceptical thoughts,\r\n    which seem for the moment to uproot the firmest faith: there\r\n    are blasphemous thoughts, which dart unbidden into the most\r\n    reverent souls: there are unholy thoughts, which torture\r\n    with their hateful presence the fancy that would fain be\r\n    pure. Against all these some real mental work is a most\r\n    helpful ally. That \"unclean spirit\" of the parable, who\r\n    brought back with him seven others more wicked than himself,\r\n    only did so because he found the chamber \"swept and\r\n    garnished,\" and its owner sitting with folded hands. Had he\r\n    found it all alive with the \"busy hum\" of active _work_,\r\n    there would have been scant welcome for him and his seven!\r\n\r\nIt would have robbed the book of its true character if Lewis Carroll\r\nhad attempted to improve on the work done in his head, and\r\nconsequently we have the solutions exactly as he worked them out\r\nbefore setting them down on paper. Of the Problems themselves there is\r\nnot much to be said here; they are original, and some of them (e.g.,\r\nNo. 52) expressed in a style peculiarly the author's own. The subjects\r\nincluded in their range are Arithmetic, Algebra, Pure Geometry\r\n(Plane), Trigonometry, Algebraic Geometry, and Differential Calculus;\r\nand there is one Problem to which Mr. Dodgson says he \"can proudly\r\npoint,\" in \"Transcendental Probabilities,\" which is here given: \"A bag\r\ncontains two counters, as to which nothing is known except that each\r\nis either black or white. Ascertain their colour without taking them\r\nout of the bag.\" The answer is, \"One is black and the other white.\"\r\nFor the solution the reader is referred to the book itself, a study of\r\nwhich will well repay him, apart from the chance he may have of\r\ndiscovering some mistake, and the consequent joy thereat!\r\n\r\nA few extracts from the Diary follow, written during the early part of\r\n1894:--\r\n\r\n    _Feb._ 1_st.--Dies notandus._ As Ragg was reading\r\n    Prayers, and Bayne and I were the only M.A.'s in the stalls,\r\n    I tried the experiment of going to the lectern and reading\r\n    the lesson. I did not hesitate much, but feel it too great a\r\n    strain on the nerves to be tried often. Then I went to the\r\n    Latin Chapel for Holy Communion. Only Paget (Dean) and Dr.\r\n    Huntley came: so, for the first time in my recollection, it\r\n    had to be given up. Then I returned to my rooms, and found\r\n    in _The Standard_ the very important communication from\r\n    Gladstone denying the rumour that he has decided upon\r\n    resigning the Premiership, but admitting that, owing to\r\n    failing powers, it may come at any moment. It will make a\r\n    complete change in the position of politics! Then I got,\r\n    from Cook Wilson, what I have been so long trying for--an\r\n    accepted transcript of the fallacious argument over which we\r\n    have had an (apparently) endless fight. I think the end is\r\n    near, _now_.\r\n\r\n    _Feb._ 4_th._--The idea occurred to me that it\r\n    might be a pleasant variation in Backgammon to throw\r\n    _three_ dice, and choose any two of the three numbers.\r\n    The average quality of the throws would be much raised. I\r\n    reckon that the chance of \"6, 6\" would be about two and a\r\n    half what it now is. It would also furnish a means, similar\r\n    to giving points in billiards, for equalising players: the\r\n    weaker might use three dice, the other using two. I think of\r\n    calling it \"Thirdie Backgammon.\"\r\n\r\n    _March_ 31_st._--Have just got printed, as a\r\n    leaflet, \"A Disputed Point in Logic\"--the point Professor\r\n    Wilson and I have been arguing so long. This paper is wholly\r\n    in his own words, and puts the point very clearly. I think\r\n    of submitting it to all my logical friends.\r\n\r\n\"A Disputed Point in Logic\" appeared also, I believe, in\r\n_Mind_, July, 1894.\r\n\r\nThis seems a fitting place in which to speak of a side of Mr.\r\nDodgson's character of which he himself was naturally very\r\nreticent--his wonderful generosity. My own experience of him was of a\r\nman who was always ready to do one a kindness, even though it put him\r\nto great expense and inconvenience; but of course I did not know,\r\nduring his lifetime, that my experience of him was the same as that of\r\nall his other friends. The income from his books and other sources,\r\nwhich might have been spent in a life of luxury and selfishness, he\r\ndistributed lavishly where he saw it was needed, and in order to do\r\nthis he always lived in the most simple way. To make others happy was\r\nthe Golden Rule of his life. On August 31st he wrote, in a letter to a\r\nfriend, Miss Mary Brown: \"And now what am I to tell you about myself?\r\nTo say I am quite well 'goes without saying' with me. In fact, my life\r\nis so strangely free from all trial and trouble that I cannot doubt my\r\nown happiness is one of the talents entrusted to me to 'occupy' with,\r\ntill the Master shall return, by doing something to make other lives\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\nIn several instances, where friends in needy circumstances have\r\nwritten to him for loans of money, he has answered them, \"I will not\r\n_lend_, but I will _give_ you the £100 you ask for.\" To help\r\nchild-friends who wanted to go on the stage, or to take up music as a\r\nprofession, he has introduced them to leading actors and actresses,\r\npaid for them having lessons in singing from the best masters, sent\r\nround circulars to his numerous acquaintances begging them to\r\npatronise the first concert or recital.\r\n\r\nIn writing his books he never attempted to win popularity by acceding\r\nto the prejudices and frailties of the age--his one object was to make\r\nhis books useful and helpful and ennobling. Like the great Master, in\r\nwhose steps he so earnestly strove to follow, he \"went about doing\r\ngood.\" And one is glad to think that even his memory is being made to\r\nserve the same purpose. The \"Alice\" cots are a worthy sequel to his\r\ngenerous life.\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Dodgson, with all his boasted health, was not absolutely\r\nproof against disease, for on February 12, 1895, he writes:--\r\n\r\n    Tenth day of a rather bad attack of influenza of the ague\r\n    type. Last night the fever rose to a great height, partly\r\n    caused by a succession of _five_ visitors. One,\r\n    however, was of my own seeking--Dean Paget, to whom I was\r\n    thankful to be able to tell all I have had in my mind for a\r\n    year or more, as to our Chapel services _not_ being as\r\n    helpful as they could be made. The chief fault is extreme\r\n    _rapidity_. I long ago gave up the attempt to say the\r\n    Confession at that pace; and now I say it, and the Lord's\r\n    Prayer, close together, and never hear a word of the\r\n    Absolution. Also many of the Lessons are quite unedifying.\r\n\r\nOn July 11th he wrote to my brother on the subject of a paper about\r\nEternal Punishment, which was to form the first of a series of essays\r\non Religious Difficulties:--\r\n\r\n    I am sending you the article on \"Eternal Punishment\" as it\r\n    is. There is plenty of matter for consideration, as to which\r\n    I shall be glad to know your views.\r\n\r\n    Also if there are other points, connected with religion,\r\n    where you feel that perplexing difficulties exist, I should\r\n    be glad to know of them in order to see whether I can see my\r\n    way to saying anything helpful.\r\n\r\n    But I had better add that I do not want to deal with any\r\n    such difficulties, _unless_ they tend to affect _life.\r\n    Speculative_ difficulties which do not affect conduct, and\r\n    which come into collision with any of the principles which I\r\n    intend to state as axioms, lie outside the scope of my book.\r\n    These axioms are:--\r\n\r\n      (1) Human conduct is capable of being _right_, and of\r\n      being _wrong_.\r\n\r\n      (2) I possess Free-Will, and am able to choose between\r\n      right and wrong.\r\n\r\n      (3) I have in some cases chosen wrong.\r\n\r\n      (4) I am responsible for choosing wrong.\r\n\r\n      (5) I am responsible to a person.\r\n\r\n      (6) This person is perfectly good.\r\n\r\n    I call them axioms, because I have no _proofs_ to offer for\r\n    them. There will probably be others, but these are all I can\r\n    think of just now.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. H. Hopley, Vicar of Westham, has sent me the following\r\ninteresting account of a sermon Mr. Dodgson preached at his church:--\r\n\r\n    In the autumn of 1895 the Vicar of Eastbourne was to have\r\n    preached my Harvest Sermon at Westham, a village five miles\r\n    away; but something or other intervened, and in the middle\r\n    of the week I learned he could not come. A mutual friend\r\n    suggested my asking Mr. Dodgson, who was then in Eastbourne,\r\n    to help me, and I went with him to his rooms. I was quite a\r\n    stranger to Mr. Dodgson; but knowing from hearsay how\r\n    reluctant he usually was to preach, I apologised and\r\n    explained my position--with Sunday so near at hand. After a\r\n    moment's hesitation he consented, and in a most genial\r\n    manner made me feel quite at ease as to the abruptness of my\r\n    petition. On the morrow he came over to my vicarage, and\r\n    made friends with my daughters, teaching them some new\r\n    manner of playing croquet [probably Castle Croquet], and\r\n    writing out for them puzzles and anagrams that he had\r\n    composed.\r\n\r\n    The following letter was forwarded on the Saturday:--\r\n\r\n        \"7, Lushington Road, Eastbourne,\r\n\r\n        _September_ 26, 1895.\r\n\r\n        Dear Mr. Hopley,--I think you will excuse the liberty\r\n        I am taking in asking you to give me some food after the\r\n        service on Sunday, so that I may have no need to catch the\r\n        train, but can walk back at leisure. This will save me from\r\n        the worry of trying to conclude at an exact minute, and\r\n        you, perhaps, from the trouble of finding short hymns, to save\r\n        time. It will not, I hope, cause your cook any trouble, as\r\n        my regular rule here is _cold_ dinner on Sundays. This not\r\n        from any \"Sabbatarian\" theory, but from the wish to let our\r\n        _employés_ have the day _wholly_ at their own disposal.\r\n\r\n        I beg Miss Hopley's acceptance of the enclosed papers--\r\n        (puzzles and diagrams.)\r\n\r\n        Believe me, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n        C.L. Dodgson.\"\r\n\r\n    On Sunday our grand old church was crowded, and, although\r\n    our villagers are mostly agricultural labourers, yet they\r\n    breathlessly listened to a sermon forty minutes long, and\r\n    apparently took in every word of it. It was quite extempore,\r\n    in very simple words, and illustrated by some delightful and\r\n    most touching stories of children. I only wish there had\r\n    been a shorthand-writer there.\r\n\r\n    In the vestry after service, while he was signing his name\r\n    in the Preachers' Book, a church officer handed him a bit of\r\n    paper. \"Mr. Dodgson, would you very kindly write your name\r\n    on that?\" \"Sir!\" drawing himself up sternly--\"Sir, I never\r\n    do that for any one\"--and then, more kindly, \"You see, if I\r\n    did it for one, I must do it for all.\"\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident in Mr. Dodgson's life is connected with the\r\nwell-known drama, \"Two Little Vagabonds.\" I give the story as he wrote\r\nit in his Diary:--\r\n\r\n    _Nov._ 28_th.--Matinée_ at the Princess's of \"Two Little\r\n    Vagabonds,\" a very sensational melodrama, capitally acted.\r\n    \"Dick\" and \"Wally\" were played by Kate Tyndall and Sydney\r\n    Fairbrother, whom I guess to be about fifteen and twelve.\r\n    Both were excellent, and the latter remarkable for the\r\n    perfect realism of her acting. There was some beautiful\r\n    religious dialogue between \"Wally\" and a hospital nurse--\r\n    most reverently spoken, and reverently received by the\r\n    audience.\r\n\r\n    _Dec._ 17_th._--I have given books to Kate Tyndall and\r\n    Sydney Fairbrother, and have heard from them, and find I was\r\n    entirely mistaken in taking them for children. Both are\r\n    married women!\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter written in 1896 to one of\r\nhis sisters, in allusion to a death which had recently occurred in the\r\nfamily:--\r\n\r\n    It is getting increasingly difficult now to remember _which_\r\n    of one's friends remain alive, and _which_ have gone \"into\r\n    the land of the great departed, into the silent land.\" Also,\r\n    such news comes less and less as a shock, and more and more\r\n    one realises that it is an experience each of _us_ has to\r\n    face before long. That fact is getting _less_ dreamlike to\r\n    me now, and I sometimes think what a grand thing it will be\r\n    to be able to say to oneself, \"Death is _over_ now; there is\r\n    not _that_ experience to be faced again.\"\r\n\r\n    I am beginning to think that, if the _books I_ am still\r\n    hoping to write are to be done _at all,_ they must be done\r\n    _now_, and that I am _meant_ thus to utilise the splendid\r\n    health I have had, unbroken, for the last year and a half,\r\n    and the working powers that are fully as great as, if not\r\n    greater, than I have ever had. I brought with me here (this\r\n    letter was written from Eastbourne) the MS., such as it is\r\n    (very fragmentary and unarranged) for the book about\r\n    religious difficulties, and I meant, when I came here, to\r\n    devote myself to that, but I have changed my plan. It seems\r\n    to me that _that_ subject is one that hundreds of living men\r\n    could do, if they would only try, _much_ better than I\r\n    could, whereas there is no living man who could (or at any\r\n    rate who would take the trouble to) arrange and finish and\r\n    publish the second part of the \"Logic.\" Also, I _have_ the\r\n    Logic book in my head; it will only need three or four\r\n    months to write out, and I have _not_ got the other book in\r\n    my head, and it might take years to think out. So I have\r\n    decided to get Part ii. finished _first_, and I am working\r\n    at it day and night. I have taken to early rising, and\r\n    sometimes sit down to my work before seven, and have one and\r\n    a half hours at it before breakfast. The book will be a\r\n    great novelty, and will help, I fully believe, to make the\r\n    study of Logic _far_ easier than it now is. And it will, I\r\n    also believe, be a help to religious thought by giving\r\n    _clearness_ of conception and of expression, which may\r\n    enable many people to face, and conquer, many religious\r\n    difficulties for themselves. So I do really regard it as\r\n    work for _God_.\r\n\r\nAnother letter, written a few months later to Miss Dora Abdy, deals\r\nwith the subject of \"Reverence,\" which Mr. Dodgson considered a virtue\r\nnot held in sufficient esteem nowadays:--\r\n\r\n    My Dear Dora,--In correcting the proofs of \"Through the\r\n    Looking-Glass\" (which is to have \"An Easter Greeting\"\r\n    inserted at the end), I am reminded that in that letter (I\r\n    enclose a copy), I had tried to express my thoughts on the\r\n    very subject we talked about last night--the relation of\r\n    _laughter_ to religious thought. One of the hardest things\r\n    in the world is to convey a meaning accurately from one mind\r\n    to another, but the _sort_ of meaning I want to convey to\r\n    other minds is that while the laughter of _joy_ is in full\r\n    harmony with our deeper life, the laughter of amusement\r\n    should be kept apart from it. The danger is too great of\r\n    thus learning to look at solemn things in a spirit of\r\n    _mockery_, and to seek in them opportunities for exercising\r\n    _wit_. That is the spirit which has spoiled, for me, the\r\n    beauty of some of the Bible. Surely there is a deep meaning\r\n    in our prayer, \"Give us an heart to love and _dread_ Thee.\"\r\n    We do not mean _terror_: but a dread that will harmonise\r\n    with love; \"respect\" we should call it as towards a human\r\n    being, \"reverence\" as towards God and all religious things.\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Game of Logic\" Lewis Carroll introduced an original method of\r\nworking logical problems by means of diagrams; this method he\r\nsuperseded in after years for a much simpler one, the method of\r\n\"Subscripts.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Symbolic Logic, Part i.\" (London: Macmillan, 1896) he employed\r\nboth methods. The Introduction is specially addressed \"to Learners,\"\r\nwhom Lewis Carroll advises to read the book straight through, without\r\n_dipping_.\r\n\r\n    This Rule [he says] is very desirable with other kinds of\r\n    books--such as novels, for instance, where you may easily\r\n    spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the\r\n    story by dipping into it further on, so that what the author\r\n    meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of\r\n    course. Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into\r\n    vol. iii. first, just to see how the story ends; and perhaps\r\n    it _is_ as well just to know that all ends\r\n    _happily_--that the much persecuted lovers _do_\r\n    marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of\r\n    the murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in\r\n    his plot, and gets the punishment he deserves, and that the\r\n    rich uncle in India (_Qu._ Why in _India? Ans._\r\n    Because, somehow, uncles never _can_ get rich anywhere\r\n    else) dies at exactly the right moment--before taking the\r\n    trouble to read vol i. This, I say, is _just_\r\n    permissible with a _novel_, where vol. iii. has a\r\n    _meaning_, even for those who have not read the earlier\r\n    part of the story; but with a _scientific_ book, it is\r\n    sheer insanity. You will find the latter part\r\n    _hopelessly_ unintelligible, if you read it before\r\n    reaching it in regular course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n(1897-1898)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Logic-lectures--Irreverent anecdotes--Tolerance of his\r\n    religious views--A mathematical discovery--\"The Little\r\n    Minister\" Sir George Baden-Powell--Last illness--\"Thy will\r\n    be done\"--\"Wonderland\" at last!--Letters from friends \"Three\r\n    Sunsets\"--\"Of such is the kingdom of Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1897, the last complete year which he was destined to spend,\r\nbegan for Mr. Dodgson at Guildford. On January 3rd he preached in the\r\nmorning at the beautiful old church of S. Mary's, the church which he\r\nalways attended when he was staying with his sisters at the Chestnuts.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th he began a course of Logic Lectures at Abbot's Hospital.\r\nThe Rev. A. Kingston, late curate of Holy Trinity and S. Mary's\r\nParishes, Guildford, had requested him to do this, and he had given\r\nhis promise if as many as six people could be got together to hear\r\nhim. Mr. Kingston canvassed the town so well that an audience of about\r\nthirty attended the first lecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lewis Carroll. _From a photograph._]\r\n\r\nA long Sunday walk was always a feature of Mr. Dodgson's life in the\r\nvacations. In earlier years the late Mr. W. Watson was his usual\r\ncompanion at Guildford. The two men were in some respects very much\r\nalike; a peculiar gentleness of character, a winning charm of manner\r\nwhich no one could resist, distinguished them both. After Mr. Watson's\r\ndeath his companion was usually one of the following Guildford\r\nclergymen: the Rev. J.H. Robson, LL.D., the Rev. H.R. Ware, and the\r\nRev. A. Kingston.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th Mr. Dodgson paid a visit to the Girls' High School, to\r\nshow the pupils some mathematical puzzles, and to teach the elder ones\r\nhis \"Memoria Technica.\" On the 28th he returned to Oxford, so as to be\r\nup in time for term.\r\n\r\nI have said that he always refused invitations to dinner; accordingly\r\nhis friends who knew of this peculiarity, and wished to secure him for\r\na special evening, dared not actually invite him, but wrote him little\r\nnotes stating that on such and such days they would be dining at home.\r\nThus there is an entry in his Journal for February 10th:\r\n\r\n    \"Dined with Mrs. G--(She had not sent an\r\n    'invitation'--only 'information').\"\r\n\r\nHis system of symbolic logic enabled him to work out the most complex\r\nproblems with absolute certainty in a surprisingly short time. Thus he\r\nwrote on the 15th: \"Made a splendid logic-problem, about\r\n\"great-grandsons\" (modelled on one by De Morgan). My method of\r\nsolution is quite new, and I greatly doubt if any one will solve the\r\nProblem. I have sent it to Cook Wilson.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 7th he preached in the University Church, the first occasion\r\non which he had done so:--\r\n\r\n    There is now [he writes] a system established of a course of\r\n    six sermons at S. Mary's each year, for University men\r\n    _only_, and specially meant for undergraduates. They\r\n    are preached, preceded by a few prayers and a hymn, at\r\n    half-past eight. This evening ended the course for this\r\n    term: and it was my great privilege to preach. It has been\r\n    the most formidable sermon I have ever had to preach, and it\r\n    is a _great_ relief to have it over. I took, as text,\r\n    Job xxviii. 28, \"And unto man he said, The fear of the Lord,\r\n    that is wisdom\"--and the prayer in the Litany \"Give us an\r\n    heart to love and dread thee.\" It lasted three-quarters of\r\n    an hour.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine how he would have treated the subject. The views which\r\nhe held on the subject of reverence were, so at least it appears to\r\nme, somewhat exaggerated; they are well expressed in a letter which he\r\nwrote to a friend of his, during the year, and which runs as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    Dear--, After changing my mind several times, I have at\r\n    last decided to venture to ask a favour of you, and to trust\r\n    that you will not misinterpret my motives in doing so.\r\n\r\n    The favour I would ask is, that you will not tell me any\r\n    more stories, such as you did on Friday, of remarks which\r\n    children are said to have made on very sacred subjects--\r\n    remarks which most people would recognise as irreverent, if\r\n    made by _grown-up people_, but which are assumed to be\r\n    innocent when made by children who are unconscious of any\r\n    irreverence, the strange conclusion being drawn that they\r\n    are therefore innocent when _repeated_ by a grown-up person.\r\n\r\n    The misinterpretation I would guard against is, your\r\n    supposing that I regard such repetition as always _wrong_ in\r\n    any grown-up person. Let me assure you that I do _not_ so\r\n    regard it. I am always willing to believe that those who\r\n    repeat such stories differ wholly from myself in their views\r\n    of what is, and what is not, fitting treatment of sacred\r\n    things, and I fully recognise that what would certainly be\r\n    wrong in _me_, is not necessarily so in _them_.\r\n\r\n    So I simply ask it as a personal favour to myself. The\r\n    hearing of that anecdote gave me so much pain, and spoiled\r\n    so much the pleasure of my tiny dinner-party, that I feel\r\n    sure you will kindly spare me such in future.\r\n\r\n    One further remark. There are quantities of such anecdotes\r\n    going about. I don't in the least believe that 5 per cent.\r\n    of them were ever said by _children_. I feel sure that most\r\n    of them are concocted by people who _wish_ to bring sacred\r\n    subjects into ridicule--sometimes by people who _wish_ to\r\n    undermine the belief that others have in religious truths:\r\n    for there is no surer way of making one's beliefs _unreal_\r\n    than by learning to associate them with ludicrous ideas.\r\n\r\n    Forgive the freedom with which I have said all this.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nThe entry in the Diary for April 11th (Sunday) is interesting:--\r\n\r\n    Went my eighteen-mile round by Besilsleigh. From my rooms\r\n    back to them again, took me five hours and twenty-seven\r\n    minutes. Had \"high tea\" at twenty minutes past seven. This\r\n    entails only leaving a plate of cold meat, and gives much\r\n    less trouble than hot dinner at six.\r\n\r\n    Dinner at six has been my rule since January 31st, when it\r\n    began--I then abandoned the seven o'clock Sunday dinner, of\r\n    which I entirely disapprove. It has prevented, for two\r\n    terms, the College Servants' Service.\r\n\r\nOn May 12th he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    As the Prince of Wales comes this afternoon to open the Town\r\n    Hall, I went round to the Deanery to invite them to come\r\n    through my rooms upon the roof, to see the procession\r\n    arrive.... A party of about twenty were on my roof in the\r\n    afternoon, including Mrs. Moberly, Mrs. Driver, and Mrs.\r\n    Baynes, and most, if not all, of the children in Christ\r\n    Church. Dinner in Hall at eight. The Dean had the Prince on\r\n    his right, and Lord Salisbury on his left. My place was almost\r\n    _vis-à-vis_ with the Prince. He and the Dean were the\r\n    only speakers. We did not get out of Hall till nearly ten.\r\n\r\nIn June he bought a \"Whiteley Exerciser,\" and fixed it up in his\r\nrooms. One would have thought that he would have found his long walks\r\nsufficient exercise (an eighteen-mile round was, as we have seen, no\r\nunusual thing for him to undertake), but apparently it was not so. He\r\nwas so pleased with the \"Exerciser,\" that he bought several more of\r\nthem, and made presents of them to his friends.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of his broad-mindedness, the following extract from his\r\nDiary for June 20th is interesting. It must be premised that E--was a\r\nyoung friend of his who had recently become a member of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, and that their place of worship in Oxford is\r\ndedicated to S. Aloysius.\r\n\r\n    I went with E-- to S. Aloysius. There was much beauty in the\r\n    service, part of which consisted in a procession, with\r\n    banner, all round the church, carrying the Host, preceded by\r\n    a number of girls in white, with veils (who had all had\r\n    their first communion that morning), strewing flowers. Many\r\n    of them were quite little things of about seven. The sermon\r\n    (by Father Richardson) was good and interesting, and in a\r\n    very loyal tone about the Queen.\r\n\r\nA letter he wrote some years before to a friend who had asked him\r\nabout his religious opinions reveals the same catholicity of mind:--\r\n\r\n    I am a member of the English Church, and have taken Deacon's\r\n    Orders, but did not think fit (for reasons I need not go\r\n    into) to take Priest's Orders. My dear father was what is\r\n    called a \"High Churchman,\" and I naturally adopted those\r\n    views, but have always felt repelled by the yet higher\r\n    development called \"Ritualism.\"\r\n\r\n    But I doubt if I am fully a \"High Churchman\" now. I find\r\n    that as life slips away (I am over fifty now), and the life\r\n    on the other side of the great river becomes more and more\r\n    the reality, of which _this_ is only a shadow, that the\r\n    petty distinctions of the many creeds of Christendom tend to\r\n    slip away as well--leaving only the great truths which all\r\n    Christians believe alike. More and more, as I read of the\r\n    Christian religion, as Christ preached it, I stand amazed at\r\n    the forms men have given to it, and the fictitious barriers\r\n    they have built up between themselves and their brethren. I\r\n    believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last\r\n    time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths\r\n    Christ taught us--our own utter worthlessness and His\r\n    infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one\r\n    Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one\r\n    another--we shall have all we need to guide us through the\r\n    shadows.\r\n\r\n    Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer\r\n    to--that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way\r\n    of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it\r\n    is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we\r\n    are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially\r\n    say, \"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross\r\n    of Calvary.\"\r\n\r\nHe spent the Long Vacation at Eastbourne as usual, frequently walking\r\nover to Hastings, which is about twenty miles off. A good many of his\r\nmornings were spent in giving lectures and telling stories at schools.\r\n\r\nA letter to the widow of an old college friend reveals the\r\nextraordinary sensitiveness of his nature:--\r\n\r\n    2, Bedford Well Road, Eastbourne,\r\n\r\n    _August_ 2, 1897.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Mrs. Woodhouse,--Your letter, with its mournful\r\n    news, followed me down here, and I only got it on Saturday\r\n    night; so I was not able to be with you in thought when the\r\n    mortal remains of my dear old friend were being committed to\r\n    the ground; to await the time when our Heavenly Father shall\r\n    have accomplished the number of His elect, and when you and\r\n    I shall once more meet the loved ones from whom we are, for\r\n    a little while only--what a little while even a long human\r\n    life lasts!--parted in sorrow, yet _not_ sorrowing as\r\n    those without hope.\r\n\r\n    You will be sure without words of mine, that you have my\r\n    true and deep sympathy. Of all the friends I made at Ch.\r\n    Ch., your husband was the very _first_ who spoke to\r\n    me--across the dinner-table in Hall. That is forty-six years\r\n    ago, but I remember, as if it were only yesterday, the\r\n    kindly smile with which he spoke....\r\n\r\nSeptember 27th and 28th are marked in his Diary \"with a white\r\nstone\":--\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 27th.--Dies notandus._ Discovered rule for\r\n    dividing a number by 9, by mere addition and subtraction. I\r\n    felt sure there must be an analogous one for 11, and found\r\n    it, and proved first rule by algebra, after working about\r\n    nine hours!\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 28th.--Dies cretâ notandus._ I have actually\r\n    _superseded_ the rules discovered yesterday! My new\r\n    rules require to ascertain the 9-remainder, and the\r\n    11-remainder, which the others did _not_ require; but\r\n    the new ones are much the quickest. I shall send them to\r\n    _The Educational Times_, with date of discovery.\r\n\r\nOn November 4th he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    Completed a rule for dividing a given number by any divisor\r\n    that is within 10 of a power of 10, either way. The\r\n    _principle_ of it is not my discovery, but was sent me\r\n    by Bertram Collingwood--a rule for dividing by a divisor\r\n    which is within 10 of a power of 10, _below_ it.\r\n\r\nMy readers will not be surprised to learn that only eight days after\r\nthis he had superseded his rule:--\r\n\r\n    An inventive morning! After waking, and before I had\r\n    finished dressing, I had devised a new and much neater form\r\n    in which to work my Rules for Long Division, and also\r\n    decided to bring out my \"Games and Puzzles,\" and Part iii.\r\n    of \"Curiosa Mathematica,\" in _Numbers_, in paper covers,\r\n    paged consecutively, to be ultimately issued in boards.\r\n\r\nOn November 20th he spent the day in London, with the object of seeing\r\n\"The Little Minister\" at the Haymarket. \"A beautiful play, beautifully\r\nacted,\" he calls it, and says that he should like to see it \"again and\r\nagain.\" He especially admired the acting of Mrs. Cyril Maude (Miss\r\nWinifred Emery) as Lady Babbie. This was the last theatrical\r\nperformance he ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nHe apparently kept rough notes for his Diary, and only wrote it up\r\nevery few weeks, as there are no entries at all for 1898, nor even for\r\nthe last week of 1897. The concluding page runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Dec. (W.) 10 a.m._--I am in my large room, with no fire,\r\n    and open window--temperature 54 degrees.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 17 (F.)._--Maggie [one of his sisters], and our nieces\r\n    Nella and Violet, came to dinner.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 19 (Sun.)._--Sat up last night till 4 a.m., over a\r\n    tempting problem, sent me from New York, \"to find 3 equal\r\n    rational-sided rt.-angled _triangles_.\" I found _two_,\r\n    whose sides are 20, 21, 29; 12, 35, 37; but could not find\r\n    _three_.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 23(Th.)._--I start for Guildford by the 2.7 today.\r\n\r\nAs my story of Lewis Carroll's life draws near its end, I have\r\nreceived some \"Stray Reminiscences\" from Sir George Baden-Powell,\r\nM.P., which, as they refer to several different periods of time, are\r\nas appropriate here as in any other part of the book. The Rev. E.H.\r\nDodgson, referred to in these reminiscences, is a younger brother of\r\nLewis Carroll's; he spent several years of his life upon the remote\r\nisland of Tristan d'Acunha, where there were only about seventy or\r\neighty inhabitants besides himself. About once a year a ship used to\r\ncall, when the island-folk would exchange their cattle for cloth,\r\ncorn, tea, &c., which they could not produce themselves. The island is\r\nvolcanic in origin, and is exposed to the most terrific gales; the\r\nbuilding used as a church stood at some distance from Mr. Dodgson's\r\ndwelling, and on one occasion the wind was so strong that he had to\r\ncrawl on his hands and knees for the whole distance that separated\r\nthe two buildings.\r\n\r\n    My first introduction (writes Sir George Baden-Powell) to\r\n    the author of \"Through the Looking-Glass\" was about the year\r\n    1870 or 1871, and under appropriate conditions! I was then\r\n    coaching at Oxford with the well-known Rev. E. Hatch, and\r\n    was on friendly terms with his bright and pretty children.\r\n    Entering his house one day, and facing the dining-room, I\r\n    heard mysterious noises under the table, and saw the cloth\r\n    move as if some one were hiding. Children's legs revealed it\r\n    as no burglar, and there was nothing for it but to crawl\r\n    upon them, roaring as a lion. Bursting in upon them in their\r\n    strong-hold under the table, I was met by the staid but\r\n    amused gaze of a reverend gentleman. Frequently afterwards\r\n    did I see and hear \"Lewis Carroll\" entertaining the\r\n    youngsters in his inimitable way.\r\n\r\n    We became friends, and greatly did I enjoy intercourse with\r\n    him over various minor Oxford matters. In later years, at one\r\n    time I saw much of him, in quite another _rôle_--namely\r\n    that of ardent sympathy with the, as he thought, ill-treated\r\n    and deserted islanders of Tristan d'Acunha. His brother, it\r\n    will be remembered, had voluntarily been left at that island\r\n    with a view to ministering to the spiritual and educational\r\n    needs of the few settlers, and sent home such graphic\r\n    accounts and urgent demands for aid, that \"Lewis Carroll\"\r\n    spared no pains to organise assistance and relief. At his\r\n    instance I brought the matter before Government and the\r\n    House of Commons, and from that day to this frequent\r\n    communication has been held with the islanders, and material\r\n    assistance has been rendered them--thanks to the warm heart\r\n    of \"Lewis Carroll.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 1897, as the note in his Diary states, he went down,\r\nin accordance with his usual custom, to Guildford, to spend Christmas\r\nwith his sisters at the Chestnuts. He seemed to be in his ordinary\r\nhealth, and in the best of spirits, and there was nothing to show that\r\nthe end was so near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Chestnuts, Guildford. _From a\r\nphotograph._]\r\n\r\nAt Guildford he was hard at work upon the second part of his \"Symbolic\r\nLogic,\" spending most of the day over this task. This book, alas! he\r\nwas not destined to finish, which is the more to be regretted as it\r\nwill be exceedingly difficult for any one else to take up the thread\r\nof the argument, even if any one could be found willing to give the\r\ngreat amount of time and trouble which would be needed.\r\n\r\nOn January 5th my father, the Rev. C.S. Collingwood, Rector of\r\nSouthwick, near Sunderland, died after a very short illness. The\r\ntelegram which brought Mr. Dodgson the news of this contained the\r\nrequest that he would come at once. He determined to travel north the\r\nnext day--but it was not to be so. An attack of influenza, which began\r\nonly with slight hoarseness, yet enough to prevent him from following\r\nhis usual habit of reading family prayers, was pronounced next morning\r\nto be sufficiently serious to forbid his undertaking a journey. At\r\nfirst his illness seemed a trifle, but before a week had passed\r\nbronchial symptoms had developed, and Dr. Gabb, the family physician,\r\nordered him to keep his bed. His breathing rapidly became hard and\r\nlaborious, and he had to be propped up with pillows. A few days before\r\nhis death he asked one of his sisters to read him that well-known\r\nhymn, every verse of which ends with 'Thy Will be done.' To another he\r\nsaid that his illness was a great trial of his patience. How great a\r\ntrial it must have been it is hard for us to understand. With the work\r\nhe had set himself still uncompleted, with a sense of youth and\r\njoyousness, which sixty years of the battle of life had in no way\r\ndulled, Lewis Carroll had to face death. He seemed to know that the\r\nstruggle was over. \"Take away those pillows,\" he said on the 13th, \"I\r\nshall need them no more.\" The end came about half-past two on the\r\nafternoon of the 14th. One of his sisters was in the room at the time,\r\nand she only noticed that the hard breathing suddenly ceased. The\r\nnurse, whom she summoned, at first hoped that this was a sign that he\r\nhad taken a turn for the better. And so, indeed, he had--he had passed\r\nfrom a world of incompleteness and disappointment, to another where\r\nGod is putting his beautiful soul to nobler and grander work than was\r\npossible for him here, where he is learning to comprehend those\r\ndifficulties which used to puzzle him so much, and where that infinite\r\nLove, which he mirrored so wonderfully in his own life, is being\r\nrevealed to him \"face to face.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his expressed wish, the funeral was simple in the\r\nextreme--flowers, and flowers only, adorned the plain coffin. There\r\nwas no hearse to drag it up the steep incline that leads to the\r\nbeautiful cemetery where he lies. The service was taken by Dean Paget\r\nand Canon Grant, Rector of Holy Trinity and S. Mary's, Guildford. The\r\nmourners who followed him in the quiet procession were few--but the\r\nmourners who were not there, and many of whom had never seen him--who\r\nshall tell _their_ number?\r\n\r\nAfter the grave had been filled up, the wreaths which had covered the\r\ncoffin were placed upon it. Many were from \"child-friends\" and bore\r\nsuch inscriptions as \"From two of his child-friends\"--\"To the sweetest\r\nsoul that ever looked with human eyes,\" &c. Then the mourners left him\r\nalone there--up on the pleasant downs where he had so often walked.\r\n\r\nA marble cross, under the shadow of a pine, marks the spot, and\r\nbeneath his own name they have engraved the name of \"Lewis Carroll,\"\r\nthat the children who pass by may remember their friend, who is\r\nnow--himself a child in all that makes childhood most attractive--in\r\nthat \"Wonderland\" which outstrips all our dreams and hopes.\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear quoting from Professor Sanday's sermon at Christ\r\nChurch on the Sunday after his death:--\r\n\r\n    The world will think of Lewis Carroll as one who opened out\r\n    a new vein in literature, a new and a delightful vein, which\r\n    added at once mirth and refinement to life.... May we not\r\n    say that from our courts at Christ Church there has flowed\r\n    into the literature of our time a rill, bright and\r\n    sparkling, health-giving and purifying, wherever its waters\r\n    extend?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lewis Carroll's grave. _From a photograph._]\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday Dean Paget, in the course of a sermon on the\r\n\"Virtue of Simplicity,\" said:--\r\n\r\n    We may differ, according to our difference of taste or\r\n    temperament, in appraising Charles Dodgson's genius; but\r\n    that that great gift was his, that his best work ranks with\r\n    the very best of its kind, this has been owned with a\r\n    recognition too wide and spontaneous to leave room for\r\n    doubt. The brilliant, venturesome imagination, defying\r\n    forecast with ever-fresh surprise; the sense of humour in\r\n    its finest and most naïve form; the power to touch with\r\n    lightest hand the undercurrent of pathos in the midst of\r\n    fun; the audacity of creative fancy, and the delicacy of\r\n    insight--these are rare gifts; and surely they were his.\r\n    Yes, but it was his simplicity of mind and heart that raised\r\n    them all, not only in his work but in his life, in all his\r\n    ways, in the man as we knew him, to something higher than\r\n    any mere enumeration of them tells: that almost curious\r\n    simplicity, at times, that real and touching child-likeness\r\n    that marked him in all fields of thought, appearing in his\r\n    love of children and in their love of him, in his dread of\r\n    giving pain to any living creature, in a certain\r\n    disproportion, now and then, of the view he took of\r\n    things--yes, and also in that deepest life, where the pure\r\n    in heart and those who become as little children see the\r\n    very truth and walk in the fear and love of God.\r\n\r\nSome extracts from the numerous sympathetic letters received by Mr.\r\nDodgson's brothers and sisters will show how greatly his loss was\r\nfelt. Thus Canon Jelf writes:--\r\n\r\n    It was quite a shock to me to see in the paper to-day the\r\n    death of your dear, good brother, to whom we owe so much of\r\n    the brightening of our lives with pure, innocent fun.\r\n    Personally I feel his loss very much indeed. We were\r\n    together in old Ch. Ch. days from 1852 onwards; and he was\r\n    always such a loyal, faithful friend to me. I rejoice to\r\n    think of the _serious_ talks we had together--of the grand,\r\n    brave way in which he used the opportunities he had as a man\r\n    of humour, to reach the consciences of a host of readers--of\r\n    his love for children--his simplicity of heart--of his care\r\n    for servants--his spiritual care for them. Who can doubt\r\n    that he was fully prepared for a change however sudden--for\r\n    the one clear call which took him away from us? Yet the\r\n    world seems darker for his going; we can only get back our\r\n    brightness by realising Who gave him all his talent, all his\r\n    mirth of heart--the One who never leaves us. In deep\r\n    sympathy,\r\n\r\n    Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n    George E. Jelf.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--When you have time tell me a little about him; he was\r\n    so dear to me.\r\n\r\nMr. Frederic Harrison writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The occasional visits that I received from your late brother\r\n    showed me a side of his nature which to my mind was more\r\n    interesting and more worthy of remembrance even than his\r\n    wonderful and delightful humour--I mean his intense sympathy\r\n    with all who suffer and are in need.\r\n\r\n    He came to see me several times on sundry errands of mercy,\r\n    and it has been a lesson to me through life to remember his\r\n    zeal to help others in difficulty, his boundless generosity,\r\n    and his inexhaustible patience with folly and error.\r\n\r\n    My young daughter, like all young people in civilised\r\n    countries, was brought up on his beautiful fancies and\r\n    humours. But for my part I remember him mainly as a sort of\r\n    missionary to all in need. We all alike grieve, and offer\r\n    you our heartfelt sympathy.\r\n\r\n    I am, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    Frederic Harrison.\r\n\r\nHis old friend and tutor. Dr. Price, writes:--\r\n\r\n    ... I feel his removal from among us as the loss of an old\r\n    and dear friend and pupil, to whom I have been most warmly\r\n    attached ever since he was with me at Whitby, reading\r\n    mathematics, in, I think, 1853--44 years ago! And 44 years\r\n    of uninterrupted friendship .... I was pleased to read\r\n    yesterday in _The Times_ newspaper the kindly obituary\r\n    notice: perfectly just and true; appreciative, as it should\r\n    be, as to the unusual combination of deep mathematical\r\n    ability and taste with the genius that led to the writing of\r\n    \"Alice's Adventures.\"\r\n\r\n    Only the other day [writes a lady friend] he wrote to me\r\n    about his admiration for my dear husband, and he ended his\r\n    letter thus: \"I trust that when _my_ time comes, I may be\r\n    found, like him, working to the last, and ready for the\r\n    Master's call\"--and truly so he was.\r\n\r\nA friend at Oxford writes:--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dodgson was ever the kindest and gentlest of friends,\r\n    bringing sunshine into the house with him. We shall mourn\r\n    his loss deeply, and my two girls are quite overcome with\r\n    grief. All day memories of countless acts of kindness shown\r\n    to me, and to people I have known, have crowded my mind, and\r\n    I feel it almost impossible to realise that he has passed\r\n    beyond the reach of our gratitude and affection.\r\n\r\nThe following are extracts from letters written by some of his\r\n\"child-friends,\" now grown up:--\r\n\r\n    How beautiful to think of the track of light and love he has\r\n    left behind him, and the amount of happiness he brought into\r\n    the lives of all those he came in contact with! I shall\r\n    never forget all his kindness to us, from the time he first\r\n    met us as little mites in the railway train, and one feels\r\n    glad to have had the privilege of knowing him.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Dodgson's oldest \"child-friends\" writes:--\r\n\r\n    He was to me a dear and true friend, and it has been my\r\n    great privilege to see a good deal of him ever since I was a\r\n    tiny child, and especially during the last two years. I\r\n    cannot tell you how much we shall miss him here. Ch. Ch.\r\n    without Mr. Dodgson will be a strange place, and it is\r\n    difficult to realise it even while we listen to the special\r\n    solemn anthems and hymns to his memory in our cathedral.\r\n\r\nOne who had visited him at Guildford, writes:--\r\n\r\n    It must be quite sixteen years now since he first made\r\n    friends with my sister and myself as children on the beach\r\n    at Eastbourne, and since then his friendship has been and\r\n    must always be one of my most valued possessions. It\r\n    culminated, I think, in the summer of 1892--the year when he\r\n    brought me to spend a very happy Sunday at Guildford. I had\r\n    not seen him before, that year, for some time; and it was\r\n    then, I think, that the childish delight in his kindness,\r\n    and pride in his friendship, changed into higher love and\r\n    reverence, when in our long walks over the downs I saw more\r\n    and more into the great tenderness and gentleness of his\r\n    nature.\r\n\r\nShortly after Mr. Dodgson's death, his \"Three Sunsets\" was published\r\nby Messrs. Macmillan. The twelve \"Fairy Fancies,\" which illustrate it,\r\nwere drawn by Miss E. G. Thomson. Though they are entirely unconnected\r\nwith the text, they are so thoroughly in accordance with the author's\r\ndelicate refinement, and so beautiful in themselves, that they do not\r\nstrike one as inappropriate.\r\n\r\nSome of the verses are strangely in keeping with the time at which\r\nthey are published.\r\n\r\n        I could not see, for blinding tears,\r\n          The glories of the west:\r\n        A heavenly music filled my ears,\r\n          A heavenly peace my breast.\r\n        \"Come unto me, come unto me--\r\n        All ye that labour, unto me--\r\n        Ye heavy-laden, come to me--\r\n          And I will give you rest.\"\r\n\r\nOne cannot read this little volume without feeling that the shadow of\r\nsome disappointment lay over Lewis Carroll's life. Such I believe to\r\nhave been the case, and it was this that gave him his wonderful\r\nsympathy with all who suffered. But those who loved him would not wish\r\nto lift the veil from these dead sanctities, nor would any purpose be\r\nserved by so doing. The proper use of sympathy is not to weep over\r\nsorrows that are over, and whose very memory is perhaps obliterated\r\nfor him in the first joy of possessing new and higher faculties.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of this book, I should like to draw\r\nattention to a few lines on \"woman's mission,\" lines full of the\r\nnoblest chivalry, reminding one of Tennyson's \"Idylls of the King\":--\r\n\r\n          In the darkest path of man's despair,\r\n        Where War and Terror shake the troubled earth,\r\n        Lies woman's mission; with unblenching brow\r\n        To pass through scenes of horror and affright\r\n        Where men grow sick and tremble: unto her\r\n        All things are sanctified, for all are good.\r\n        Nothing so mean, but shall deserve her care:\r\n        Nothing so great, but she may bear her part.\r\n        No life is vain: each hath his place assigned:\r\n        Do thou thy task, and leave the rest to God.\r\n\r\nOf the unpublished works which Mr. Dodgson left behind him, I may\r\nmention \"Original Games and Puzzles\"; \"Symbolic Logic, Part ii.,\" and\r\na portion of a mathematical book, the proofs of which are now in the\r\nhands of the Controller of the Oxford University Press.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter with a poem which\r\nappeared in _Punch_ for January 29th, a fortnight\r\nafter Lewis Carroll's death. It expresses, with\r\nall the grace and insight of the true poet, what\r\nI have tried, so feebly and ineffectually, to\r\nsay:--\r\n\r\n                LEWIS CARROLL.\r\n\r\n    _Born_ 1832. _Died January_ 14, 1898.\r\n\r\n        Lover of children!

But near our hearts we have you yet,\r\n          Holding our heritage with loving hand,\r\n        Who may not follow where your feet are set\r\n          Upon the ways of Wonderland.[025]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lorina and Alice Liddell. _From a photograph\r\nby Lewis Carroll._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCHILD FRIENDS\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dodgson's fondness for children--Miss Isabel\r\n    Standen--Puzzles--\"Me and Myself\"--A double\r\n    acrostic--\"Father William\"--Of drinking healths--Kisses by\r\n    post--Tired in the face--The unripe\r\n    plum--Eccentricities--\"Sylvie and Bruno\"--\"Mr. Dodgson is\r\n    going on _well_.\"\r\n\r\nThis chapter, and the next will deal with Mr. Dodgson's friendships\r\nwith children. It would have been impossible to arrange them in\r\nchronological sequence in the earlier part of this book, and the fact\r\nthat they exhibit a very important and distinct side of his nature\r\nseems to justify me in assigning them a special and individual\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nFor the contents of these two chapters, both my readers and myself owe\r\na debt of gratitude to those child-friends of his, without whose\r\never-ready help this book could never have been written.\r\n\r\nFrom very early college days began to emerge that beautiful side of\r\nLewis Carroll's character which afterwards was to be, next to his fame\r\nas an author, the one for which he was best known--his attitude\r\ntowards children, and the strong attraction they had for him. I shall\r\nattempt to point out the various influences which led him in this\r\ndirection; but if I were asked for one comprehensive word wide\r\nenough to explain this tendency of his nature, I would answer\r\nunhesitatingly--Love. My readers will remember a beautiful verse in\r\n\"Sylvie and Bruno\"; trite though it is, I cannot forbear to quote it--\r\n\r\n    Say, whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,\r\n      Like a picture so fair to the sight?\r\n    That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,\r\n      Till the little lambs leap with delight?\r\n    'Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,\r\n      Though 'tis sung by the angels above,\r\n    In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear,\r\n      And the name of the secret is Love!\r\n\r\nThat \"secret\"--an open secret for him--explains this side of his\r\ncharacter. As _he_ read everything in its light, so it is only in\r\nits light that _we_ can properly understand _him_. I think\r\nthat the following quotation from a letter to the Rev. F. H. Atkinson,\r\naccompanying a copy of \"Alice\" for his little daughter Gertrude,\r\nsufficiently proves the truth of what I have just stated:--\r\n\r\n    Many thanks to Mrs. Atkinson and to you for the sight of the\r\n    tinted photograph of your Gertrude. As you say, the picture\r\n    speaks for itself, and I can see exactly what sort of a\r\n    child she is, in proof of which I send her my love and a\r\n    kiss herewith. It is possible I may be the first (unseen)\r\n    gentleman from whom she has had so ridiculous a message; but\r\n    I can't say she is the first unseen child to whom I have\r\n    sent one! I think the most precious message of the kind I\r\n    ever got from a child I never saw (and never shall see in\r\n    this world) was to the effect that she liked me when she\r\n    read about Alice, \"but please tell him, whenever I read that\r\n    Easter letter he sent me I _do_ love him!\" She was in a\r\n    hospital, and a lady friend who visited there had asked me\r\n    to send the letter to her and some other sick children.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the secondary causes which attracted him to children.\r\nFirst, I think children appealed to him because he was pre-eminently a\r\nteacher, and he saw in their unspoiled minds the best material for him\r\nto work upon. In later years one of his favourite recreations was to\r\nlecture at schools on logic; he used to give personal attention to\r\neach of his pupils, and one can well imagine with what eager\r\nanticipation the children would have looked forward to the visits of a\r\nschoolmaster who knew how to make even the dullest subjects\r\ninteresting and amusing.\r\n\r\nAgain, children appealed to his æsthetic faculties, for he was a keen\r\nadmirer of the beautiful in every form. Poetry, music, the drama, all\r\ndelighted him, but pictures more than all put together. I remember his\r\nonce showing me \"The Lady with the Lilacs,\" which Arthur Hughes had\r\npainted for him, and how he dwelt with intense pleasure on the\r\nexquisite contrasts of colour which it contained--the gold hair of a\r\ngirl standing out against the purple of lilac-blossom. But with those\r\nwho find in such things as these a complete satisfaction of their\r\ndesire for the beautiful he had no sympathy; for no imperfect\r\nrepresentations of life could, for him, take the place of life itself,\r\nlife as God has made it--the babbling of the brook, the singing of the\r\nbirds, the laughter and sweet faces of the children. And yet,\r\nrecognising, as he did, what Mr. Pater aptly terms \"the curious\r\nperfection of the human form,\" in man, as in nature, it was the soul\r\nthat attracted him more than the body. His intense admiration, one\r\nmight almost call it adoration, for the white innocence and\r\nuncontaminated spirituality of childhood emerges most clearly in\r\n\"Sylvie and Bruno.\" He says very little of the personal beauty of his\r\nheroine; he might have asked, with Mr. Francis Thompson--\r\n\r\n        How can I tell what beauty is her dole,\r\n        Who cannot see her countenance for her soul?\r\n\r\nSo entirely occupied is he with her gentleness, her pity, her\r\nsincerity, and her love.\r\n\r\nAgain, the reality of children appealed strongly to the simplicity and\r\ngenuineness of his own nature. I believe that he understood children\r\neven better than he understood men and women; civilisation has made\r\nadult humanity very incomprehensible, for convention is as a veil\r\nwhich hides the divine spark that is in each of us, and so this\r\nstrange thing has come to be, that the imperfect mirrors perfection\r\nmore completely than the perfected, that we see more of God in the\r\nchild than in the man.\r\n\r\nAnd in those moments of depression of which he had his full share,\r\nwhen old age seemed to mock him with all its futility and feebleness,\r\nit was the thought that the children still loved him which nerved him\r\nagain to continue his life-work, which renewed his youth, so that to\r\nhis friends he never seemed an old man. Even the hand of death itself\r\nonly made his face look more boyish--the word is not too strong. \"How\r\nwonderfully young your brother looks!\" were the first words the doctor\r\nsaid, as he returned from the room where Lewis Carroll's body lay, to\r\nspeak to the mourners below. And so he loved children because their\r\nfriendship was the true source of his perennial youth and unflagging\r\nvigour. This idea is expressed in the following poem--an acrostic,\r\nwhich he wrote for a friend some twenty years ago:--\r\n\r\n        Around my lonely hearth, to-night,\r\n          Ghostlike the shadows wander:\r\n        Now here, now there, a childish sprite,\r\n        Earthborn and yet as angel bright,\r\n          Seems near me as I ponder.\r\n\r\n        Gaily she shouts: the laughing air\r\n          Echoes her note of gladness--\r\n        Or bends herself with earnest care\r\n        Round fairy-fortress to prepare\r\n        Grim battlement or turret-stair--\r\n          In childhood's merry madness!\r\n\r\n        New raptures still hath youth in store:\r\n          Age may but fondly cherish\r\n        Half-faded memories of yore--\r\n        Up, craven heart! repine no more!\r\n        Love stretches hands from shore to shore:\r\n          Love is, and shall not perish!\r\n\r\nHis first child-friend, so far as I know, was Miss Alice Liddell, the\r\nlittle companion whose innocent talk was one of the chief pleasures of\r\nhis early life at Oxford, and to whom he told the tale that was to\r\nmake him famous. In December, 1885, Miss M.E. Manners presented him\r\nwith a little volume, of which she was the authoress, \"Aunt Agatha Ann\r\nand Other Verses,\" and which contained a poem (which I quoted in\r\nChapter VI.), about \"Alice.\" Writing to acknowledge this gift, Lewis\r\nCarroll said:--\r\n\r\n    Permit me to offer you my sincere thanks for the very sweet\r\n    verses you have written about my dream-child (named after a\r\n    real Alice, but none the less a dream-child) and her\r\n    Wonderland. That children love the book is a very precious\r\n    thought to me, and, next to their love, I value the sympathy\r\n    of those who come with a child's heart to what I have tried\r\n    to write about a child's thoughts. Next to what conversing\r\n    with an angel _might_ be--for it is hard to imagine\r\n    it--comes, I think, the privilege of having a real child's\r\n    thoughts uttered to one. I have known some few _real_\r\n    children (you have too, I am sure), and their friendship is\r\n    a blessing and a help in life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alice Liddell. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll._]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note how in \"Sylvie and Bruno\" his idea of the\r\nthoughts of a child has become deeper and more spiritual. Yet in the\r\nearlier tale, told \"all in a golden afternoon,\" to the plash of oars\r\nand the swish of a boat through the waters of Cherwell or Thames, the\r\nideal child is strangely beautiful; she has all Sylvie's genuineness\r\nand honesty, all her keen appreciation of the interest of life; only\r\nthere lacks that mysterious charm of deep insight into the hidden\r\nforces of nature, the gentle power that makes the sky \"such a darling\r\nblue,\" which almost links Sylvie with the angels.\r\n\r\nAnother of Lewis Carroll's early favourites was Miss Alexandra (Xie)\r\nKitchin, daughter of the Dean of Durham. Her father was for fifteen\r\nyears the Censor of the unattached members of the University of\r\nOxford, so that Mr. Dodgson had plenty of opportunities of\r\nphotographing his little friend, and it is only fair to him to say\r\nthat he did not neglect them.\r\n\r\nIt would be futile to attempt even a bare list of the children whom he\r\nloved, and who loved him; during forty years of his life he was\r\nconstantly adding to their number. Some remained friends for life, but\r\nin a large proportion of cases the friendship ended with the end of\r\nchildhood. To one of those few, whose affection for him had not waned\r\nwith increasing years, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    I always feel specially grateful to friends who, like you,\r\n    have given me a child-friendship and a woman-friendship.\r\n    About nine out of ten, I think, of my child-friendships get\r\n    ship-wrecked at the critical point, \"where the stream and\r\n    river meet,\" and the child-friends, once so affectionate,\r\n    become uninteresting acquaintances, whom I have no wish to\r\n    set eyes on again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Xie Kitchin. _From a photograph by Lewis\r\nCarroll._]\r\n\r\nThese friendships usually began all very much in the same way. A\r\nchance meeting on the sea-shore, in the street, at some friend's\r\nhouse, led to conversation; then followed a call on the parents, and\r\nafter that all sorts of kindnesses on Lewis Carroll's part, presents\r\nof books, invitations to stay with him at Oxford, or at Eastbourne,\r\nvisits with him to the theatre. For the amusement of his little guests\r\nhe kept a large assortment of musical-boxes, and an organette which\r\nhad to be fed with paper tunes. On one occasion he ordered about\r\ntwelve dozen of these tunes \"on approval,\" and asked one of the other\r\ndons, who was considered a judge of music, to come in and hear them\r\nplayed over. In addition to these attractions there were clock-work\r\nbears, mice, and frogs, and games and puzzles in infinite variety.\r\n\r\nOne of his little friends, Miss Isabel Standen, has sent me the\r\nfollowing account of her first meeting with him:--\r\n\r\n    We met for the first time in the Forbury Gardens, Reading.\r\n    He was, I believe, waiting for a train. I was playing with\r\n    my brothers and sisters in the Gardens. I remember his\r\n    taking me on his knee and showing me puzzles, one of which\r\n    he refers to in the letter (given below. This puzzle was, by\r\n    the way, a great favourite of his; the problem is to draw\r\n    three interlaced squares without going over the same lines\r\n    twice, or taking the pen off the paper), which is so\r\n    thoroughly characteristic of him in its quaint humour:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"The Chestnuts, Guildford,\r\n\r\n        _August _22, 1869.\r\n\r\n        My Dear Isabel,--Though I have only been acquainted\r\n        with you for fifteen minutes, yet, as there is no one\r\n        else in Reading I have known so long, I hope you will\r\n        not mind my troubling you. Before I met you in the\r\n        Gardens yesterday I bought some old books at a shop in\r\n        Reading, which I left to be called for, and had not\r\n        time to go back for them. I didn't even remark the name\r\n        of the shop, but I can tell _where_ it was, and if\r\n        you know the name of the woman who keeps the shop, and\r\n        would put it into the blank I have left in this note,\r\n        and direct it to her I should be much obliged ... A\r\n        friend of mine, called Mr. Lewis Carroll, tells me he\r\n        means to send you a book. He is a _very_ dear\r\n        friend of mine. I have known him all my life (we are\r\n        the same age) and have _never_ left him. Of course\r\n        he was with me in the Gardens, not a yard off--even\r\n        while I was drawing those puzzles for you. I wonder if\r\n        you saw him?\r\n\r\n        Your fifteen-minute friend,\r\n\r\n        C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n        Have you succeeded in drawing the three squares?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother favourite puzzle was the following--I give it in his own\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n    A is to draw a fictitious map divided into counties.\r\n\r\n    B is to colour it (or rather mark the counties with\r\n    _names_ of colours) using as few colours as possible.\r\n\r\n    Two adjacent counties must have _different_ colours.\r\n\r\n    A's object is to force B to use as _many_ colours as\r\n    possible.\r\n\r\n    How many can he force B to use?\r\n\r\nOne of his most amusing letters was to a little girl called Magdalen,\r\nto whom he had given a copy of his \"Hunting of the Snark\":--\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, _December_ 15, 1875.\r\n\r\n    My dear Magdalen,--I want to explain to you why I did not\r\n    call yesterday. I was sorry to miss you, but you see I had\r\n    so many conversations on the way. I tried to explain to the\r\n    people in the street that I was going to see you, but they\r\n    wouldn't listen; they said they were in a hurry, which was\r\n    rude. At last I met a wheelbarrow that I thought would\r\n    attend to me, but I couldn't make out what was in it. I saw\r\n    some features at first, then I looked through a telescope,\r\n    and found it was a countenance; then I looked through a\r\n    microscope, and found it was a face! I thought it was father\r\n    like me, so I fetched a large looking-glass to make sure,\r\n    and then to my great joy I found it was me. We shook hands,\r\n    and were just beginning to talk, when myself came up and\r\n    joined us, and we had quite a pleasant conversation. I said,\r\n    \"Do you remember when we all met at Sandown?\" and myself\r\n    said, \"It was very jolly there; there was a child called\r\n    Magdalen,\" and me said, \"I used to like her a little; not\r\n    much, you know--only a little.\" Then it was time for us to\r\n    go to the train, and who do you think came to the station to\r\n    see us off? You would never guess, so I must tell you. They\r\n    were two very dear friends of mine, who happen to be here\r\n    just now, and beg to be allowed to sign this letter as your\r\n    affectionate friends,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll and C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nAnother child-friend, Miss F. Bremer, writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Our acquaintance began in a somewhat singular manner. We\r\n    were playing on the Fort at Margate, and a gentleman on a\r\n    seat near asked us if we could make a paper boat, with a\r\n    seat at each end, and a basket in the middle for fish! We\r\n    were, of course, enchanted with the idea, and our new\r\n    friend--after achieving the feat--gave us his card, which we\r\n    at once carried to our mother. He asked if he might call\r\n    where we were staying, and then presented my elder sister\r\n    with a copy of \"Alice in Wonderland,\" inscribed \"From the\r\n    Author.\" He kindly organised many little excursions for\r\n    us--chiefly in the pursuit of knowledge. One memorable visit\r\n    to a light house is still fresh in our memories.\r\n\r\nIt was while calling one day upon Mrs. Bremer that he scribbled off\r\nthe following double acrostic on the names of her two daughters--\r\n\r\n        DOUBLE ACROSTIC--FIVE LETTERS.\r\n\r\n        Two little girls near London dwell,\r\n        More naughty than I like to tell.\r\n\r\n                         1.\r\n        Upon the lawn the hoops are seen:\r\n        The balls are rolling on the green.       T  ur  F\r\n\r\n                         2.\r\n        The Thames is running deep and wide:\r\n        And boats are rowing on the tide.         R ive  R\r\n\r\n                         3.\r\n        In winter-time, all in a row,\r\n        The happy skaters come and go.            I  c   E\r\n\r\n                         4.\r\n        \"Papa!\" they cry, \"Do let us stay!\"\r\n        He does not speak, but says they may.     N   o  D\r\n\r\n                         5.\r\n        \"There is a land,\" he says, \"my dear,\r\n        Which is too hot to skate, I fear.\"       A fric A\r\n\r\nAt Margate also he met Miss Adelaide Paine, who afterwards became one\r\nof his greatest favourites. He could not bear to see the healthy\r\npleasures of childhood spoiled by conventional restraint. \"One piece\r\nof advice given to my parents,\" writes Miss Paine, \"gave me very great\r\nglee, and that was not to make little girls wear gloves at the\r\nseaside; they took the advice, and I enjoyed the result.\"\r\n_Apropos_ of this I may mention that, when staying at Eastbourne,\r\nhe never went down to the beach without providing himself with a\r\nsupply of safety-pins. Then if he saw any little girl who wanted to\r\nwade in the sea, but was afraid of spoiling her frock, he would\r\ngravely go up to her and present her with a safety-pin, so that she\r\nmight fasten up her skirts out of harm's way.\r\n\r\nTight boots were a great aversion of his, especially for children. One\r\nlittle girl who was staying with him at Eastbourne had occasion to buy\r\na new pair of boots. Lewis Carroll gave instructions to the bootmaker\r\nas to how they were to be made, so as to be thoroughly comfortable,\r\nwith the result that when they came home they were more useful than\r\nornamental, being very nearly as broad as they were long! Which shows\r\nthat even hygienic principles may be pushed too far.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting with Miss Paine took place in 1876. When Lewis\r\nCarroll returned to Christ Church he sent her a copy of \"The Hunting\r\nof the Snark,\" with the following acrostic written in the fly-leaf:--\r\n\r\n    'A re you deaf, Father William?' the young man said,\r\n    'D id you hear what I told you just now?\r\n     E xcuse me for shouting! Don't waggle your head\r\n     L ike a blundering, sleepy old cow!\r\n     A little maid dwelling in Wallington Town,\r\n     I s my friend, so I beg to remark:\r\n     D o you think she'd be pleased if a book were sent down\r\n     E ntitled \"The Hunt of the Snark?\"'\r\n\r\n    'P ack it up in brown paper!' the old man cried,\r\n    'A nd seal it with olive-and-dove.\r\n     I command you to do it!' he added with pride,\r\n    'N or forget, my good fellow, to send her beside\r\n     E aster Greetings, and give her my love.'\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a letter, dated June 7, 1876:--\r\n\r\n    My dear Adelaide,--Did you try if the letters at the\r\n    beginnings of the lines about Father William would spell\r\n    anything? Sometimes it happens that you can spell out words\r\n    that way, which is very curious.\r\n\r\n    I wish you could have heard him when he shouted out \"Pack it\r\n    up in brown paper!\" It quite shook the house. And he threw\r\n    one of his shoes at his son's head (just to make him attend,\r\n    you know), but it missed him.\r\n\r\n    He was glad to hear you had got the book safe, but his eyes\r\n    filled with tears as he said, \"I sent _her_ my love,\r\n    but she never--\" he couldn't say any more, his mouth was so\r\n    full of bones (he was just finishing a roast goose).\r\n\r\nAnother letter to Miss Paine is very characteristic of his quaint humour:--\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, Oxford, _March_ 8, 1880.\r\n\r\n    My dear Ada,--(Isn't that your short name? \"Adelaide\" is all\r\n    very well, but you see when one's _dreadfully_ busy one\r\n    hasn't time to write such long words--particularly when it\r\n    takes one half an hour to remember how to spell it--and even\r\n    then one has to go and get a dictionary to see if one has\r\n    spelt it right, and of course the dictionary is in another\r\n    room, at the top of a high bookcase--where it has been for\r\n    months and months, and has got all covered with dust--so\r\n    one has to get a duster first of all, and nearly choke\r\n    oneself in dusting it--and when one _has_ made out at\r\n    last which is dictionary and which is dust, even _then_\r\n    there's the job of remembering which end of the alphabet \"A\"\r\n    comes--for one feels pretty certain it isn't in the\r\n    _middle_--then one has to go and wash one's hands\r\n    before turning over the leaves--for they've got so thick\r\n    with dust one hardly knows them by sight--and, as likely as\r\n    not, the soap is lost, and the jug is empty, and there's no\r\n    towel, and one has to spend hours and hours in finding\r\n    things--and perhaps after all one has to go off to the shop\r\n    to buy a new cake of soap--so, with all this bother, I hope\r\n    you won't mind my writing it short and saying, \"My dear\r\n    Ada\"). You said in your last letter you would like a\r\n    likeness of me: so here it is, and I hope you will like\r\n    it--I won't forget to call the next time but one I'm in\r\n    Wallington.\r\n\r\n    Your very affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\nIt was quite against Mr. Dodgson's usual rule to give away photographs\r\nof himself; he hated publicity, and the above letter was accompanied\r\nby another to Mrs. Paine, which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I am very unwilling, usually, to give my photograph, for I\r\n    don't want people, who have heard of Lewis Carroll, to be\r\n    able to recognise him in the street--but I can't refuse Ada.\r\n    Will you kindly take care, if any of your ordinary\r\n    acquaintances (I don't speak of intimate friends) see it,\r\n    that they are _not_ told anything about the name of\r\n    \"Lewis Carroll\"?\r\n\r\nHe even objected to having his books discussed in his presence; thus\r\nhe writes to a friend:--\r\n\r\n    Your friend, Miss--was very kind and complimentary about my\r\n    books, but may I confess that I would rather have them\r\n    ignored? Perhaps I am too fanciful, but I have somehow taken\r\n    a dislike to being talked to about them; and consequently\r\n    have some trials to bear in society, which otherwise would\r\n    be no trials at all.... I don't think any of my many little\r\n    stage-friends have any shyness at all about being talked to\r\n    of their performances. _They_ thoroughly enjoy the\r\n    publicity that I shrink from.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child to whom the three following letters were addressed, Miss\r\nGaynor Simpson, was one of Lewis Carroll's Guildford friends. The\r\ncorrect answer to the riddle propounded in the second letter is\r\n\"Copal\":--\r\n\r\n    _December_ 27, 1873.\r\n\r\n    My dear Gaynor,--My name is spelt with a \"G,\" that is to say\r\n    \"_Dodgson_.\" Any one who spells it the same as that\r\n    wretch (I mean of course the Chairman of Committees in the\r\n    House of Commons) offends me _deeply_, and _for\r\n    ever!_ It is a thing I _can_ forget, but _never\r\n    can forgive! _If you do it again, I shall call you\r\n    \"'aynor.\" Could you live happy with such a name?\r\n\r\n    As to dancing, my dear, I _never_ dance, unless I am\r\n    allowed to do it _in my own peculiar way. _There is no\r\n    use trying to describe it: it has to be seen to be believed.\r\n    The last house I tried it in, the floor broke through. But\r\n    then it was a poor sort of floor--the beams were only six\r\n    inches thick, hardly worth calling beams at all: stone\r\n    arches are much more sensible, when any dancing, _of my\r\n    peculiar kind_, is to be done. Did you ever see the\r\n    Rhinoceros, and the Hippopotamus, at the Zoölogical Gardens,\r\n    trying to dance a minuet together? It is a touching sight.\r\n\r\n    Give any message from me to Amy that you think will be most\r\n    likely to surprise her, and, believe me,\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Gaynor,--So you would like to know the answer to\r\n    that riddle? Don't be in a hurry to tell it to Amy and\r\n    Frances: triumph over them for a while!\r\n\r\n        My first lends its aid when you plunge into trade.\r\n\r\n    _Gain_. Who would go into trade if there were no gain\r\n    in it?\r\n\r\n        My second in jollifications--\r\n\r\n    _Or_ [The French for \"gold\"--] Your jollifications\r\n    would be _very_ limited if you had no money.\r\n\r\n        My whole, laid on thinnish, imparts a neat finish\r\n          To pictorial representations.\r\n\r\n    _Gaynor_. Because she will be an ornament to the\r\n    Shakespeare Charades--only she must be \"laid on thinnish,\"\r\n    that is, _there musn't be too much of her._\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Gaynor,--Forgive me for having sent you a\r\n    sham answer to begin with.\r\n\r\n    My first--_Sea_. It carries the ships of the merchants.\r\n\r\n    My second--_Weed_. That is, a cigar, an article much used\r\n    in jollifications.\r\n\r\n    My whole--_Seaweed_. Take a newly painted oil-picture;\r\n    lay it on its back on the floor, and spread over it, \"thinnish,\"\r\n    some wet seaweed. You will find you have \"finished\" that\r\n    picture.\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll during the last fifteen years of his life always spent\r\nthe Long Vacation at Eastbourne; in earlier times, Sandown, a pleasant\r\nlittle seaside resort in the Isle of Wight, was his summer abode. He\r\nloved the sea both for its own sake and because of the number of\r\nchildren whom he met at seaside places. Here is another \"first\r\nmeeting\"; this time it is at Sandown, and Miss Gertrude Chataway is\r\nthe narrator:--\r\n\r\n    I first met Mr. Lewis Carroll on the sea-shore at Sandown in\r\n    the Isle of Wight, in the summer of 1875, when I was quite a\r\n    little child.\r\n\r\n    We had all been taken there for change of air, and next door\r\n    there was an old gentlemen--to me at any rate he seemed\r\n    old--who interested me immensely. He would come on to his\r\n    balcony, which joined ours, sniffing the sea-air with his\r\n    head thrown back, and would walk right down the steps on to\r\n    the beach with his chin in air, drinking in the fresh\r\n    breezes as if he could never have enough. I do not know why\r\n    this excited such keen curiosity on my part, but I remember\r\n    well that whenever I heard his footstep I flew out to see\r\n    him coming, and when one day he spoke to me my joy was\r\n    complete.\r\n\r\n    Thus we made friends, and in a very little while I was as\r\n    familiar with the interior of his lodgings as with our own.\r\n\r\n    I had the usual child's love for fairy-tales and marvels,\r\n    and his power of telling stories naturally fascinated me. We\r\n    used to sit for hours on the wooden steps which led from our\r\n    garden on to the beach, whilst he told the most lovely tales\r\n    that could possibly be imagined, often illustrating the\r\n    exciting situations with a pencil as he went along.\r\n\r\n    One thing that made his stories particularly charming to a\r\n    child was that he often took his cue from her remarks--a\r\n    question would set him off on quite a new trail of ideas, so\r\n    that one felt that one had somehow helped to make the story,\r\n    and it seemed a personal possession It was the most lovely\r\n    nonsense conceivable, and I naturally revelled in it. His\r\n    vivid imagination would fly from one subject to another, and\r\n    was never tied down in any way by the probabilities of life.\r\n\r\n    To _me_ it was of course all perfect, but it is\r\n    astonishing that _he_ never seemed either tired or to\r\n    want other society. I spoke to him once of this since I have\r\n    been grown up, and he told me it was the greatest pleasure\r\n    he could have to converse freely with a child, and feel the\r\n    depths of her mind.\r\n\r\n    He used to write to me and I to him after that summer, and\r\n    the friendship, thus begun, lasted. His letters were one of\r\n    the greatest joys of my childhood.\r\n\r\n    I don't think that he ever really understood that we, whom\r\n    he had known as children, could not always remain such. I\r\n    stayed with him only a few years ago, at Eastbourne, and\r\n    felt for the time that I was once more a child. He never\r\n    appeared to realise that I had grown up, except when I\r\n    reminded him of the fact, and then he only said, \"Never\r\n    mind: you will always be a child to me, even when your hair\r\n    is grey.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the letters, to which Miss Chataway refers in these\r\nreminiscences, I am enabled, through her kindness, to give below:--\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, Oxford, _October_ 13, 1875.\r\n\r\n    My dear Gertrude,--I never give birthday _presents_,\r\n    but you see I _do_ sometimes write a birthday\r\n    _letter_: so, as I've just arrived here, I am writing\r\n    this to wish you many and many a happy return of your\r\n    birthday to-morrow. I will drink your health, if only I can\r\n    remember, and if you don't mind--but perhaps you object? You\r\n    see, if I were to sit by you at breakfast, and to drink your\r\n    tea, you wouldn't like _that_, would you? You would say\r\n    \"Boo! hoo! Here's Mr. Dodgson's drunk all my tea, and I\r\n    haven't got any left!\" So I am very much afraid, next time\r\n    Sybil looks for you, she'll find you sitting by the sad\r\n    sea-wave, and crying \"Boo! hoo! Here's Mr. Dodgson has drunk\r\n    my health, and I haven't got any left!\" And how it will\r\n    puzzle Dr. Maund, when he is sent for to see you! \"My dear\r\n    Madam, I'm very sorry to say your little girl has got _no\r\n    health at all_! I never saw such a thing in my life!\"\r\n    \"Oh, I can easily explain it!\" your mother will say. \"You\r\n    see she would go and make friends with a strange gentleman,\r\n    and yesterday he drank her health!\" \"Well, Mrs. Chataway,\"\r\n    he will say, \"the only way to cure her is to wait till his\r\n    next birthday, and then for _her_ to drink _his_\r\n    health.\"\r\n\r\n    And then we shall have changed healths. I wonder how you'll\r\n    like mine! Oh, Gertrude, I wish you wouldn't talk such\r\n    nonsense!...\r\n\r\n    Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, Oxford, _Dec_. 9, 1875.\r\n\r\n    My dear Gertrude,--This really will _not_ do, you know,\r\n    sending one more kiss every time by post: the parcel gets so\r\n    heavy it is quite expensive. When the postman brought in the\r\n    last letter, he looked quite grave. \"Two pounds to pay,\r\n    sir!\" he said. \"_Extra weight_, sir!\" (I think he\r\n    cheats a little, by the way. He often makes me pay two\r\n    _pounds_, when I think it should be _pence_). \"Oh,\r\n    if you please, Mr. Postman!\" I said, going down gracefully\r\n    on one knee (I wish you could see me go down on one knee to\r\n    a postman--it's a very pretty sight), \"do excuse me just\r\n    this once! It's only from a little girl!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Only from a little girl!\" he growled. \"What are little\r\n    girls made of?\" \"Sugar and spice,\" I began to say, \"and all\r\n    that's ni--\" but he interrupted me. \"No! I don't mean\r\n    _that_. I mean, what's the good of little girls, when\r\n    they send such heavy letters?\" \"Well, they're not\r\n    _much_ good, certainly,\" I said, rather sadly.\r\n\r\n    \"Mind you don't get any more such letters,\" he said, \"at\r\n    least, not from that particular little girl. _I know her\r\n    well, and she's a regular bad one!\"_ That's not true, is\r\n    it? I don't believe he ever saw you, and you're not a bad\r\n    one, are you? However, I promised him we would send each\r\n    other _very_ few more letters--\"Only two thousand four\r\n    hundred and seventy, or so,\" I said. \"Oh!\" he said, \"a\r\n    little number like _that_ doesn't signify. What I meant\r\n    is, you mustn't send _many_.\"\r\n\r\n    So you see we must keep count now, and when we get to two\r\n    thousand four hundred and seventy, we mustn't write any\r\n    more, unless the postman gives us leave.\r\n\r\n    I sometimes wish I was back on the shore at Sandown; don't\r\n    you?\r\n\r\n    Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\n    Why is a pig that has lost its tail like a little girl on\r\n    the sea-shore?\r\n\r\n    Because it says, \"I should like another tale, please!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Christ Church, Oxford, _July_ 21, 1876.\r\n\r\n    My dear Gertrude,--Explain to me how I am to enjoy Sandown\r\n    without _you_. How can I walk on the beach alone? How\r\n    can I sit all alone on those wooden steps? So you see, as I\r\n    shan't be able to do without you, you will have to come. If\r\n    Violet comes, I shall tell her to invite you to stay with\r\n    her, and then I shall come over in the Heather-Bell and\r\n    fetch you.\r\n\r\n    If I ever _do_ come over, I see I couldn't go back the\r\n    same day, so you will have to engage me a bed somewhere in\r\n    Swanage; and if you can't find one, I shall expect\r\n    _you_ to spend the night on the beach, and give up your\r\n    room to _me_. Guests of course must be thought of\r\n    before children; and I'm sure in these warm nights the beach\r\n    will be quite good enough for _you_. If you _did_\r\n    feel a little chilly, of course you could go into a\r\n    bathing-machine, which everybody knows is _very_\r\n    comfortable to sleep in--you know they make the floor of\r\n    soft wood on purpose. I send you seven kisses (to last a\r\n    week) and remain\r\n\r\n    Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Christ church, Oxford, _October_ 28, 1876.\r\n\r\n    My dearest Gertrude,--You will be sorry, and surprised, and\r\n    puzzled, to hear what a queer illness I have had ever since\r\n    you went. I sent for the doctor, and said, \"Give me some\r\n    medicine, for I'm tired.\" He said, \"Nonsense and stuff! You\r\n    don't want medicine: go to bed!\" I said, \"No; it isn't the\r\n    sort of tiredness that wants bed. I'm tired in the\r\n    _face_.\" He looked a little grave, and said, \"Oh, it's\r\n    your _nose_ that's tired: a person often talks too\r\n    much when he thinks he nose a great deal.\" I said, \"No; it\r\n    isn't the nose. Perhaps it's the _hair_.\" Then he\r\n    looked rather grave, and said, \"_Now_ I understand:\r\n    you've been playing too many hairs on the piano-forte.\" \"No,\r\n    indeed I haven't!\" I said, \"and it isn't exactly the\r\n    _hair_: it's more about the nose and chin.\" Then he\r\n    looked a good deal graver, and said, \"Have you been walking\r\n    much on your chin lately?\" I said, \"No.\" \"Well!\" he said,\r\n    \"it puzzles me very much. Do you think that it's in the\r\n    lips?\" \"Of course!\" I said. \"That's exactly what it is!\"\r\n    Then he looked very grave indeed, and said, \"I think you\r\n    must have been giving too many kisses.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"I\r\n    did give _one_ kiss to a baby child, a little friend of\r\n    mine.\" \"Think again,\" he said; \"are you sure it was only\r\n    _one_?\" I thought again, and said, \"Perhaps it was\r\n    eleven times.\" Then the doctor said, \"You must not give her\r\n    _any_ more till your lips are quite rested again.\" \"But\r\n    what am I to do?\" I said, \"because you see, I owe her a\r\n    hundred and eighty-two more.\" Then he looked so grave that\r\n    the tears ran down his cheeks, and he said, \"You may send\r\n    them to her in a box.\" Then I remembered a little box that I\r\n    once bought at Dover, and thought I would some day give it\r\n    to _some_ little girl or other. So I have packed them\r\n    all in it very carefully. Tell me if they come safe, or if\r\n    any are lost on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Reading Station, _April_ 13, 1878.\r\n\r\n    My dear Gertrude,--As I have to wait here for half an\r\n    hour, I have been studying Bradshaw (most things, you know,\r\n    ought to be studied: even a trunk is studded with nails),\r\n    and the result is that it seems I could come, any day next\r\n    week, to Winckfield, so as to arrive there about one; and\r\n    that, by leaving Winckfield again about half-past six, I\r\n    could reach Guildford again for dinner. The next question\r\n    is, _How far is it from Winckfield to Rotherwick?_ Now\r\n    do not deceive me, you wretched child! If it is more than a\r\n    hundred miles, I can't come to see you, and there is no use\r\n    to talk about it. If it is less, the next question is,\r\n    _How much less?_ These are serious questions, and you\r\n    must be as serious as a judge in answering them. There\r\n    mustn't be a smile in your pen, or a wink in your ink\r\n    (perhaps you'll say, \"There can't be a _wink_ in\r\n    _ink_: but there _may_ be _ink_ in a\r\n    _wink_\"--but this is trifling; you mustn't make jokes\r\n    like that when I tell you to be serious) while you write to\r\n    Guildford and answer these two questions. You might as well\r\n    tell me at the same time whether you are still living at\r\n    Rotherwick--and whether you are at home--and whether you get\r\n    my letter--and whether you're still a child, or a grown-up\r\n    person--and whether you're going to the seaside next\r\n    summer--and anything else (except the alphabet and the\r\n    multiplication table) that you happen to know. I send you\r\n    10,000,000 kisses, and remain.\r\n\r\n    Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Chestnuts, Guildford, _April_ 19, 1878.\r\n\r\n    My dear Gertrude,--I'm afraid it's \"no go\"--I've had such a\r\n    bad cold all the week that I've hardly been out for some\r\n    days, and I don't think it would be wise to try the\r\n    expedition this time, and I leave here on Tuesday. But after\r\n    all, what does it signify? Perhaps there are ten or twenty\r\n    gentlemen, all living within a few miles of Rotherwick, and\r\n    any one of them would do just as well! When a little girl is\r\n    hoping to take a plum off a dish, and finds that she can't\r\n    have that one, because it's bad or unripe, what does she do?\r\n    Is she sorry, or disappointed? Not a bit! She just takes\r\n    another instead, and grins from one little ear to the other\r\n    as she puts it to her lips! This is a little fable to do you\r\n    good; the little girl means _you_--the bad plum means\r\n    _me_--the other plum means some other friend--and all\r\n    that about the little girl putting plums to her lips\r\n    means--well, it means--but you know you can't expect\r\n    _every bit_ of a fable to mean something! And the\r\n    little girl grinning means that dear little smile of yours,\r\n    that just reaches from the tip of one ear to the tip of the\r\n    other!\r\n\r\n    Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n    I send you 4-3/4 kisses.\r\n\r\nThe next letter is a good example of the dainty little notes Lewis\r\nCarroll used to scribble off on any scrap of paper that lay to his\r\nhand:--\r\n\r\n    Chestnuts, Guildford, _January_ 15, 1886.\r\n\r\n    Yes, my child, if all be well, I shall hope, and you may\r\n    fear, that the train reaching Hook at two eleven, will\r\n    contain\r\n\r\n    Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago, illness prevented him from fulfilling his usual\r\ncustom of spending Christmas with his sisters at Guildford. This is\r\nthe allusion in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n    My dear old Friend,--(The friendship is old, though the\r\n    child is young.) I wish a very happy New Year, and many of\r\n    them, to you and yours; but specially to you, because I know\r\n    you best and love you most. And I pray God to bless you,\r\n    dear child, in this bright New Year, and many a year to\r\n    come.  ... I write all this from my sofa, where I have been\r\n    confined a prisoner for six weeks, and as I dreaded the\r\n    railway journey, my doctor and I agreed that I had better\r\n    not go to spend Christmas with my sisters at Guildford. So I\r\n    had my Christmas dinner all alone, in my room here, and\r\n    (pity me, Gertrude!) it wasn't a Christmas dinner at all--I\r\n    suppose the cook thought I should not care for roast beef or\r\n    plum pudding, so he sent me (he has general orders to send\r\n    either fish and meat, or meat and pudding) some fried sole\r\n    and some roast mutton! Never, never have I dined before, on\r\n    Christmas Day, without _plum pudding_. Wasn't it sad?\r\n    Now I think you must be content; this is a longer letter\r\n    than most will get. Love to Olive. My clearest memory of her\r\n    is of a little girl calling out \"Good-night\" from her room,\r\n    and of your mother taking me in to see her in her bed, and\r\n    wish her good-night. I have a yet clearer memory (like a\r\n    dream of fifty years ago) of a little bare-legged girl in a\r\n    sailor's jersey, who used to run up into my lodgings by the\r\n    sea. But why should I trouble you with foolish reminiscences\r\n    of _mine_ that _cannot_ interest you?\r\n\r\n    Yours always lovingly,\r\n\r\n    C. L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nIt was a writer in _The National Review_ who, after eulogising\r\nthe talents of Lewis Carroll, and stating that _he_ would never\r\nbe forgotten, added the harsh prophecy that \"future generations will\r\nnot waste a single thought upon the Rev. C.L. Dodgson.\"\r\n\r\nIf this prediction is destined to be fulfilled, I think my readers\r\nwill agree with me that it will be solely on account of his\r\nextraordinary diffidence about asserting himself. But such an\r\nunnatural division of Lewis Carroll, the author, from the Rev. C.L.\r\nDodgson, the man, is forced in the extreme. His books are simply the\r\nexpression of his normal habit of mind, as these letters show. In\r\nliterature, as in everything else, he was absolutely natural.\r\n\r\nTo refer to such criticisms as this (I am thankful to say they have\r\nbeen very few) is not agreeable; but I feel that it is owing to Mr.\r\nDodgson to do what I can to vindicate the real unity which underlay\r\nboth his life and all his writings.\r\n\r\nOf many anecdotes which might be adduced to show the lovable character\r\nof the man, the following little story has reached me through one of\r\nhis child-friends:--\r\n\r\n    My sister and I [she writes] were spending a day of\r\n    delightful sightseeing in town with him, on our way to his\r\n    home at Guildford, where we were going to pass a day or two\r\n    with him. We were both children, and were much interested\r\n    when he took us into an American shop where the cakes for\r\n    sale were cooked by a very rapid process before your eyes,\r\n    and handed to you straight from the cook's hands. As the\r\n    preparation of them could easily be seen from outside the\r\n    window, a small crowd of little ragamuffins naturally\r\n    assembled there, and I well remember his piling up seven of\r\n    the cakes on one arm, and himself taking them out and doling\r\n    them round to the seven hungry little youngsters. The simple\r\n    kindness of his act impressed its charm on his child-friends\r\n    inside the shop as much as on his little stranger friends\r\n    outside.\r\n\r\nIt was only to those who had but few personal dealings with him that\r\nhe seemed stiff and \"donnish\"; to his more intimate acquaintances, who\r\nreally understood him, each little eccentricity of manner or of habits\r\nwas a delightful addition to his charming and interesting personality.\r\nThat he was, in some respects, eccentric cannot be denied; for\r\ninstance he hardly ever wore an overcoat, and always wore a tall hat,\r\nwhatever might be the climatic conditions. At dinner in his rooms\r\nsmall pieces of cardboard took the place of table-mats; they answered\r\nthe purpose perfectly well, he said, and to buy anything else would be\r\na mere waste of money. On the other hand, when purchasing books for\r\nhimself, or giving treats to the children he loved, he never seemed to\r\nconsider expense at all.\r\n\r\nHe very seldom sat down to write, preferring to stand while thus\r\nengaged. When making tea for his friends, he used, in order, I\r\nsuppose, to expedite the process, to walk up and down the room waving\r\nthe teapot about, and telling meanwhile those delightful anecdotes of\r\nwhich he had an inexhaustible supply.\r\n\r\nGreat were his preparations before going a journey; each separate\r\narticle used to be carefully wrapped up in a piece of paper all to\r\nitself, so that his trunks contained nearly as much paper as of the\r\nmore useful things. The bulk of the luggage was sent on a day or two\r\nbefore by goods train, while he himself followed on the appointed day,\r\nladen only with his well-known little black bag, which he always\r\ninsisted on carrying himself.\r\n\r\nHe had a strong objection to staring colours in dress, his favourite\r\ncombination being pink and grey. One little girl who came to stay with\r\nhim was absolutely forbidden to wear a red frock, of a somewhat\r\npronounced hue, while out in his company.\r\n\r\nAt meals he was very abstemious always, while he took nothing in the\r\nmiddle of the day except a glass of wine and a biscuit. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is not very surprising that the healthy appetites of\r\nhis little friends filled him with wonder, and even with alarm. When\r\nhe took a certain one of them out with him to a friend's house to\r\ndinner, he used to give the host or hostess a gentle warning, to the\r\nmixed amazement and indignation of the child, \"Please be careful,\r\nbecause she eats a good deal too much.\"\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity, which I have already referred to, was his\r\nobjection to being invited to dinners or any other social gatherings;\r\nhe made a rule of never accepting invitations. \"Because you have\r\ninvited me, therefore I cannot come,\" was the usual form of his\r\nrefusal. I suppose the reason of this was his hatred of the\r\ninterference with work which engagements of this sort occasion.\r\n\r\nHe had an extreme horror of infection, as will appear from the\r\nfollowing illustration. Miss Isa Bowman and her sister, Nellie, were\r\nat one time staying with him at Eastbourne, when news came from home\r\nthat their youngest sister had caught the scarlet fever. From that day\r\nevery letter which came from Mrs. Bowman to the children was held up\r\nby Mr. Dodgson, while the two little girls, standing at the opposite\r\nend of the room, had to read it as best they could. Mr. Dodgson, who\r\nwas the soul of honour, used always to turn his head to one side\r\nduring these readings, lest he might inadvertently see some words that\r\nwere not meant for his eyes.\r\n\r\nSome extracts from letters of his to a child-friend, who prefers to\r\nremain anonymous, follow:\r\n\r\n    _November_ 30, 1879.\r\n\r\n    I have been awfully busy, and I've had to write _heaps_\r\n    of letters--wheelbarrows full, almost. And it tires me so\r\n    that generally I go to bed again the next minute after I get\r\n    up: and sometimes I go to bed again a minute _before_ I\r\n    get up! Did you ever hear of any one being so tired as\r\n    _that?_...\r\n\r\n\r\n    _November_ 7, 1882.\r\n\r\n    My dear E--, How often you must find yourself in want of a\r\n    pin! For instance, you go into a shop, and you say to the\r\n    man, \"I want the largest penny bun you can let me have for a\r\n    halfpenny.\" And perhaps the man looks stupid, and doesn't\r\n    quite understand what you mean. Then how convenient it is to\r\n    have a pin ready to stick into the back of his hand, while\r\n    you say, \"Now then! Look sharp, stupid!\"... and even when\r\n    you don't happen to want a pin, how often you think to\r\n    yourself, \"They say Interlacken is a very pretty place. I\r\n    wonder what it looks like!\" (That is the place that is\r\n    painted on this pincushion.)\r\n\r\n    When you don't happen to want either a pin or pictures, it\r\n    may just remind you of a friend who sometimes thinks of his\r\n    dear little friend E--, and who is just now thinking of the\r\n    day he met her on the parade, the first time she had been\r\n    allowed to come out alone to look for him....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _December_ 26, 1886.\r\n\r\n    My dear E--, Though rushing, rapid rivers roar between us\r\n    (if you refer to the map of England, I think you'll find\r\n    that to be correct), we still remember each other, and feel\r\n    a sort of shivery affection for each other....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March_ 31, 1890.\r\n\r\n    I _do_ sympathise so heartily with you in what you say\r\n    about feeling shy with children when you have to entertain\r\n    them! Sometimes they are a real _terror_ to\r\n    me--especially boys: little girls I can now and then get on\r\n    with, when they're few enough. They easily become \"de trop.\"\r\n    But with little _boys_ I'm out of my element\r\n    altogether. I sent \"Sylvie and Bruno\" to an Oxford friend,\r\n    and, in writing his thanks, he added, \"I think I must bring\r\n    my little boy to see you.\" So I wrote to say \"_don't_,\"\r\n    or words to that effect: and he wrote again that he could\r\n    hardly believe his eyes when he got my note. He thought I\r\n    doted on _all_ children. But I'm _not_\r\n    omnivorous!--like a pig. I pick and choose....\r\n\r\n    You are a lucky girl, and I am rather inclined to envy you,\r\n    in having the leisure to read Dante--_I_ have never\r\n    read a page of him; yet I am sure the \"Divina Commedia\" is\r\n    one of the grandest books in the world--though I am\r\n    _not_ sure whether the reading of it would _raise_\r\n    one's life and give it a nobler purpose, or simply be a\r\n    grand poetical treat. That is a question you are beginning\r\n    to be able to answer: I doubt if _I_ shall ever (at\r\n    least in this life) have the opportunity of reading it; my\r\n    life seems to be all torn into little bits among the host of\r\n    things I want to do! It seems hard to settle what to do\r\n    _first. One_ piece of work, at any rate, I am clear\r\n    ought to be done this year, and it will take months of hard\r\n    work: I mean the second volume of \"Sylvie and Bruno.\" I\r\n    fully _mean_, if I have life and health till Xmas next,\r\n    to bring it out then. When one is close on sixty years old,\r\n    it seems presumptuous to count on years and years of work\r\n    yet to be done....\r\n\r\n    She is rather the exception among the hundred or so of\r\n    child-friends who have brightened my life. Usually the child\r\n    becomes so entirely a different being as she grows into a\r\n    woman, that our friendship has to change too: and\r\n    _that_ it usually does by gliding down from a loving\r\n    intimacy into an acquaintance that merely consists of a\r\n    smile and a bow when we meet!...\r\n\r\n\r\n    _January_ 1, 1895.\r\n\r\n    ... You are quite correct in saying it is a long time since\r\n    you have heard from me: in fact, I find that I have not\r\n    written to you since the 13th of last November. But what of\r\n    that? You have access to the daily papers. Surely you can\r\n    find out negatively, that I am all right! Go carefully\r\n    through the list of bankruptcies; then run your eye down the\r\n    police cases; and, if you fail to find my name anywhere, you\r\n    can say to your mother in a tone of calm satisfaction, \"Mr.\r\n    Dodgson is going on _well_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n(THE SAME--_continued_.)\r\n\r\n    Books for children--\"The Lost Plum-Cake\"--\"An Unexpected\r\n    Guest\"--Miss Isa Bowman--Interviews--\"Matilda Jane\"--Miss\r\n    Edith Rix--Miss Kathleen Eschwege.\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll's own position as an author did not prevent him from\r\ntaking a great interest in children's books and their writers. He had\r\nvery strong ideas on what was or was not suitable in such books, but,\r\nwhen once his somewhat exacting taste was satisfied, he was never\r\ntired of recommending a story to his friends. His cousin, Mrs. Egerton\r\nAllen, who has herself written several charming tales for young\r\nreaders, has sent me the following letter which she received from him\r\nsome years ago:--\r\n\r\n    Dear Georgie,--_Many_ thanks. The book was at Ch. Ch.\r\n    I've done an unusual thing, in thanking for a book, namely,\r\n    _waited to read it_. I've read it _right through_!\r\n    In fact, I found it very refreshing, when jaded with my own\r\n    work at \"Sylvie and Bruno\" (coming out at Xmas, I hope) to\r\n    lie down on the sofa and read a chapter of \"Evie.\" I like it\r\n    very much: and am so glad to have helped to bring it out. It\r\n    would have been a real loss to the children of England, if\r\n    you had burned the MS., as you once thought of doing....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Xie Kitchin as a Chinaman. _From a\r\nphotograph by Lewis Carroll_.]\r\n\r\nThe very last words of his that appeared in print took the form of a\r\npreface to one of Mrs. Allen's tales, \"The Lost Plum-Cake,\" (Macmillan\r\n& Co., 1898). So far as I know, this was the only occasion on which he\r\nwrote a preface for another author's book, and his remarks are doubly\r\ninteresting as being his last service to the children whom he loved.\r\nNo apology, then, is needed for quoting from them here:--\r\n\r\n    Let me seize this opportunity of saying one earnest word to\r\n    the mothers in whose hands this little book may chance to\r\n    come, who are in the habit of taking their children to\r\n    church with them. However well and reverently those dear\r\n    little ones have been taught to behave, there is no doubt\r\n    that so long a period of enforced quietude is a severe tax\r\n    on their patience. The hymns, perhaps, tax it least: and\r\n    what a pathetic beauty there is in the sweet fresh voices of\r\n    the children, and how earnestly they sing! I took a little\r\n    girl of six to church with me one day: they had told me she\r\n    could hardly read at all--but she made me find all the\r\n    places for her! And afterwards I said to her elder sister\r\n    \"What made you say Barbara couldn't read? Why, I heard her\r\n    joining in, all through the hymn!\" And the little sister\r\n    gravely replied, \"She knows the _tunes_, but not the\r\n    _words_.\" Well, to return to my subject--children in\r\n    church. The lessons, and the prayers, are not wholly beyond\r\n    them: often they can catch little bits that come within the\r\n    range of their small minds. But the sermons! It goes to\r\n    one's heart to see, as I so often do, little darlings of\r\n    five or six years old, forced to sit still through a weary\r\n    half-hour, with nothing to do, and not one word of the\r\n    sermon that they can understand. Most heartily can I\r\n    sympathise with the little charity-girl who is said to have\r\n    written to some friend, \"I think, when I grows up, I'll\r\n    never go to church no more. I think I'se getting sermons\r\n    enough to last me all my life!\" But need it be so? Would it\r\n    be so _very_ irreverent to let your child have a\r\n    story-book to read during the sermon, to while away that\r\n    tedious half-hour, and to make church-going a bright and\r\n    happy memory, instead of rousing the thought, \"I'll never go\r\n    to church no more\"? I think not. For my part, I should love\r\n    to see the experiment tried. I am quite sure it would be a\r\n    success. My advice would be to _keep_ some books\r\n    for that special purpose. I would call such books\r\n    \"Sunday-treats\"--and your little boy or girl would soon\r\n    learn to look forward with eager hope to that half-hour,\r\n    once so tedious. If I were the preacher, dealing with some\r\n    subject too hard for the little ones, I should love to see\r\n    them all enjoying their picture-books. And if _this_\r\n    little book should ever come to be used as a \"Sunday-treat\"\r\n    for some sweet baby reader, I don't think it could serve a\r\n    better purpose.\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\nMiss M.E. Manners was another writer for children whose books pleased\r\nhim. She gives an amusing account of two visits which he paid to her\r\nhouse in 1889:--\r\n\r\n    _An Unexpected Guest._\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Dobson wants to see you, miss.\"\r\n\r\n    I was in the kitchen looking after the dinner, and did not\r\n    feel that I particularly wished to see anybody.\r\n\r\n    \"He wants a vote, or he is an agent for a special kind of\r\n    tea,\" thought I. \"I don't know him; ask him to send a\r\n    message.\"\r\n\r\n    Presently the maid returned--\r\n\r\n    \"He says he is Mr. Dodgson, of Oxford.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Lewis Carroll!\" I exclaimed; and somebody else had to\r\n    superintend the cooking that day.\r\n\r\n    My apologies were soon made and cheerfully accepted. I\r\n    believe I was unconventional enough to tell the exact truth\r\n    concerning my occupation, and matters were soon on a\r\n    friendly footing. Indeed I may say at once that the stately\r\n    college don we have heard so much about never made his\r\n    appearance during our intercourse with him.\r\n\r\n    He did not talk \"Alice,\" of course; authors don't generally\r\n    _talk_ their books, I imagine; but it was undoubtedly\r\n    Lewis Carroll who was present with us.\r\n\r\n    A portrait of Ellen Terry on the wall had attracted his\r\n    attention, and one of the first questions he asked was, \"Do\r\n    you ever go to the theatre?\" I explained that such things\r\n    were done, occasionally, even among Quakers, but they were\r\n    not considered quite orthodox.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, well, then you will not be shocked, and I may venture\r\n    to produce my photographs.\" And out into the hall he went,\r\n    and soon returned with a little black bag containing\r\n    character portraits of his child-friends, Isa and Nellie\r\n    Bowman.\r\n\r\n    \"Isa used to be Alice until she grew too big,\" he said.\r\n    \"Nellie was one of the oyster-fairies, and Emsie, the tiny\r\n    one of all, was the Dormouse.\"\r\n\r\n    \"When 'Alice' was first dramatised,\" he said, \"the poem of\r\n    the 'Walrus and the Carpenter' fell rather flat, for people\r\n    did not know when it was finished, and did not clap in the\r\n    right place; so I had to write a song for the ghosts of the\r\n    oysters to sing, which made it all right.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alice and the Dormouse. _From a photograph\r\nby Elliott & Fry_.]\r\n\r\n    He was then on his way to London, to fetch Isa to stay with\r\n    him at Eastbourne. She was evidently a great favourite, and\r\n    had visited him before. Of that earlier time he said:--\r\n\r\n    \"When people ask me why I have never married, I tell them I\r\n    have never met the young lady whom I could endure for a\r\n    fortnight--but Isa and I got on so well together that I said\r\n    I should keep her a month, the length of the honeymoon, and\r\n    we didn't get tired of each other.\"\r\n\r\n    Nellie afterwards joined her sister \"for a few days,\" but\r\n    the days spread to some weeks, for the poor little dormouse\r\n    developed scarlet fever, and the elder children had to be\r\n    kept out of harm's way until fear of infection was over.\r\n\r\n    Of Emsie he had a funny little story to tell. He had taken\r\n    her to the Aquarium, and they had been watching the seals\r\n    coming up dripping out of the water. With a very pitiful\r\n    look she turned to him and said, \"Don't they give them any\r\n    towels?\" [The same little girl commiserated the bear,\r\n    because it had got no tail.]\r\n\r\n    Asked to stay to dinner, he assured us that he never took\r\n    anything in the middle of the day but a glass of wine and a\r\n    biscuit; but he would be happy to sit down with us, which he\r\n    accordingly did and kindly volunteered to carve for us. His\r\n    offer was gladly accepted, but the appearance of a rather\r\n    diminutive piece of neck of mutton was somewhat of a puzzle\r\n    to him. He had evidently never seen such a joint in his life\r\n    before, and had frankly to confess that he did not know how\r\n    to set about carving it. Directions only made things worse,\r\n    and he bravely cut it to pieces in entirely the wrong\r\n    fashion, relating meanwhile the story of a shy young man who\r\n    had been asked to carve a fowl, the joints of which had been\r\n    carefully wired together beforehand by his too attentive\r\n    friends.\r\n\r\n    The task and the story being both finished, our visitor\r\n    gazed on the mangled remains, and remarked quaintly: \"I\r\n    think it is just as well I don't want anything, for I don't\r\n    know where I should find it.\"\r\n\r\n    At least one member of the party felt she could have managed\r\n    matters better; but that was a point of very little\r\n    consequence.\r\n\r\n    A day or two after the first call came a note saying that he\r\n    would be taking Isa home before long, and if we would like\r\n    to see her he would stop on the way again.\r\n\r\n    Of course we were only too delighted to have the\r\n    opportunity, and, though the visit was postponed more than\r\n    once, it did take place early in August, when he brought\r\n    both Isa and Nellie up to town to see a performance of\r\n    \"Sweet Lavender.\" It is needless to remark that we took\r\n    care, this time, to be provided with something at once\r\n    substantial and carvable.\r\n\r\n    The children were bright, healthy, happy and childlike\r\n    little maidens, quite devoted to their good friend, whom\r\n    they called \"Uncle\"; and very interesting it was to see them\r\n    together.\r\n\r\n    But he did not allow any undue liberties either, as a little\r\n    incident showed.\r\n\r\n    He had been describing a particular kind of collapsible\r\n    tumbler, which you put in your pocket and carried with you\r\n    for use on a railway journey.\r\n\r\n    \"There now,\" he continued, turning to the children, \"I\r\n    forgot to bring it with me after all.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Oh Goosie,\" broke in Isa; \"you've been talking about that\r\n    tumbler for days, and now you have forgotten it.\"\r\n\r\n    He pulled himself up, and looked at her steadily with an air\r\n    of grave reproof.\r\n\r\n    Much abashed, she hastily substituted a very subdued \"Uncle\"\r\n    for the objectionable \"Goosie,\" and the matter dropped.\r\n\r\n    The principal anecdote on this occasion was about a dog\r\n    which had been sent into the sea after sticks. He brought\r\n    them back very properly for some time, and then there\r\n    appeared to be a little difficulty, and he returned swimming\r\n    in a very curious manner. On closer inspection it appeared\r\n    that he had caught hold of his own tail by mistake, and was\r\n    bringing it to land in triumph.\r\n\r\n    This was told with the utmost gravity, and though we had\r\n    been requested beforehand not to mention \"Lewis Carroll's\"\r\n    books, the temptation was too strong. I could not help\r\n    saying to the child next me--\r\n\r\n    \"That was like the Whiting, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n    Our visitor, however, took up the remark, and seemed quite\r\n    willing to talk about it.\r\n\r\n    \"When I wrote that,\" he said, \"I believed that whiting\r\n    really did have their tails in their mouths, but I have\r\n    since been told that fishmongers put the tail through the\r\n    eye, not in the mouth at all.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not a very good carver, for Miss Bremer also describes a little\r\ndifficulty he had--this time with the pastry: \"An amusing incident\r\noccurred when he was at lunch with us. He was requested to serve some\r\npastry, and, using a knife, as it was evidently rather hard, the knife\r\npenetrated the d'oyley beneath--and his consternation was extreme when\r\nhe saw the slice of linen and lace he served as an addition to the\r\ntart!\"\r\n\r\nIt was, I think, through her connection with the \"Alice\" play that Mr.\r\nDodgson first came to know Miss Isa Bowman. Her childish friendship\r\nfor him was one of the joys of his later years, and one of the last\r\nletters he wrote was addressed to her. The poem at the beginning of\r\n\"Sylvie and Bruno\" is an acrostic on her name--\r\n\r\n        Is all our Life, then, but a dream,\r\n        Seen faintly in the golden gleam\r\n        Athwart Times's dark, resistless stream?\r\n\r\n        Bowed to the earth with bitter woe,\r\n        Or laughing at some raree-show,\r\n        We flutter idly to and fro.\r\n\r\n        Man's little Day in haste we spend,\r\n        And, from the merry noontide, send\r\n        No glance to meet the silent end.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of Lewis Carroll's hatred of interviewers; the\r\nfollowing letter to Miss Manners makes one feel that in some cases, at\r\nleast, his feeling was justifiable:--\r\n\r\n    If your Manchester relatives ever go to the play, tell them\r\n    they ought to see Isa as \"Cinderella\"--she is evidently a\r\n    success. And she has actually been \"interviewed\" by one of\r\n    those dreadful newspapers reporters, and the \"interview\" is\r\n    published with her picture! And such rubbish he makes her\r\n    talk! She tells him that something or other was \"tacitly\r\n    conceded\": and that \"I love to see a great actress give\r\n    expression to the wonderful ideas of the immortal master!\"\r\n\r\n    (N.B.--I never let her talk like that when she is with _me_!)\r\n\r\n    Emsie recovered in time to go to America, with her mother\r\n    and Isa and Nellie: and they all enjoyed the trip much; and\r\n    Emsie has a London engagement.\r\n\r\nOnly once was an interviewer bold enough to enter Lewis Carroll's\r\n_sanctum_. The story has been told in _The Guardian_ (January 19,\r\n1898), but will bear repetition:--\r\n\r\n    Not long ago Mr. Dodgson happened to get into correspondence\r\n    with a man whom he had never seen, on some question of\r\n    religious difficulty, and he invited him to come to his\r\n    rooms and have a talk on the subject. When, therefore, a Mr.\r\n    X-- was announced to him one morning, he advanced to meet\r\n    him with outstretched hand and smiles of welcome. \"Come in\r\n    Mr. X--, I have been expecting you.\" The delighted visitor\r\n    thought this a promising beginning, and immediately pulled\r\n    out a note-book and pencil, and proceeded to ask \"the usual\r\n    questions.\" Great was Mr. Dodgson's disgust! Instead of his\r\n    expected friend, here was another man of the same name, and\r\n    one of the much-dreaded interviewers, actually sitting in\r\n    his chair! The mistake was soon explained, and the\r\n    representative of the Press was bowed out as quickly as he\r\n    had come in.\r\n\r\nIt was while Isa and one of her sisters were staying at Eastbourne\r\nthat the visit to America was mooted. Mr. Dodgson suggested that it\r\nwould be well for them to grow gradually accustomed to seafaring, and\r\ntherefore proposed to take them by steamer to Hastings. This plan was\r\ncarried out, and the weather was unspeakably bad--far worse than\r\nanything they experienced in their subsequent trip across the\r\nAtlantic. The two children, who were neither of them very good\r\nsailors, experienced sensations that were the reverse of pleasant. Mr.\r\nDodgson did his best to console them, while he continually repeated,\r\n\"Crossing the Atlantic will be much worse than this.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, even this terrible lesson on the horrors of the sea did not\r\nact as a deterrent; it was as unsuccessful as the effort of the old\r\nlady in one of his stories: \"An old lady I once knew tried to check\r\nthe military ardour of a little boy by showing him a picture of a\r\nbattlefield, and describing some of its horrors. But the only answer\r\nshe got was, 'I'll be a soldier. Tell it again!'\"\r\n\r\nThe Bowman children sometimes came over to visit him at Oxford, and he\r\nused to delight in showing them over the colleges, and pointing out\r\nthe famous people whom they encountered. On one of these occasions he\r\nwas walking with Maggie, then a mere child, when they met the Bishop\r\nof Oxford, to whom Mr. Dodgson introduced his little guest. His\r\nlordship asked her what she thought of Oxford. \"I think,\" said the\r\nlittle actress, with quite a professional _aplomb,_ \"it's the\r\nbest place in the Provinces!\" At which the Bishop was much amused.\r\nAfter the child had returned to town, the Bishop sent her a copy of a\r\nlittle book called \"Golden Dust,\" inscribed \"From W. Oxon,\" which\r\nconsiderably mystified her, as she knew nobody of that name!\r\n\r\nAnother little stage-friend of Lewis Carroll's was Miss Vera Beringer,\r\nthe \"Little Lord Fauntleroy,\" whose acting delighted all theatre-goers\r\neight or nine years ago. Once, when she was spending a holiday in the\r\nIsle of Man, he sent her the following lines:--\r\n\r\n        There was a young lady of station,\r\n        \"I love man\" was her sole exclamation;\r\n          But when men cried, \"You flatter,\"\r\n          She replied, \"Oh! no matter,\r\n        Isle of Man is the true explanation.\"\r\n\r\nMany of his friendships with children began in a railway carriage, for\r\nhe always took about with him a stock of puzzles when he travelled, to\r\namuse any little companions whom chance might send him. Once he was in\r\na carriage with a lady and her little daughter, both complete\r\nstrangers to him. The child was reading \"Alice in Wonderland,\" and\r\nwhen she put her book down, he began talking to her about it. The\r\nmother soon joined in the conversation, of course without the least\r\nidea who the stranger was with whom she was talking. \"Isn't it sad,\"\r\nshe said, \"about poor Mr. Lewis Carroll? He's gone mad, you know.\"\r\n\"Indeed,\" replied Mr. Dodgson, \"I had never heard that.\" \"Oh, I assure\r\nyou it is quite true,\" the lady answered. \"I have it on the best\r\nauthority.\" Before Mr. Dodgson parted with her, he obtained her leave\r\nto send a present to the little girl, and a few days afterwards she\r\nreceived a copy of \"Through the Looking-Glass,\" inscribed with her\r\nname, and \"From the Author, in memory of a pleasant journey.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he gave books to children, he very often wrote acrostics on their\r\nnames on the fly-leaf. One of the prettiest was inscribed in a copy of\r\nMiss Yonge's \"Little Lucy's Wonderful Globe,\" which he gave to Miss\r\nRuth Dymes:--\r\n\r\n        R ound the wondrous globe I wander wild,\r\n        U p and down-hill--Age succeeds to youth--\r\n        T oiling all in vain to find a child\r\n        H alf so loving, half so dear as Ruth.\r\n\r\nIn another book, given to her sister Margaret, he\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n        M aidens, if a maid you meet\r\n        A lways free from pout and pet,\r\n        R eady smile and temper sweet,\r\n        G reet my little Margaret.\r\n        A nd if loved by all she be\r\n        R ightly, not a pampered pet,\r\n        E asily you then may see\r\n       'Tis my little Margaret.\r\n\r\nHere are two letters to children, the one interesting as a specimen of\r\npure nonsense of the sort which children always like, the other as\r\nshowing his dislike of being praised. The first was written to Miss\r\nGertrude Atkinson, daughter of an old College friend, but otherwise\r\nunknown to Lewis Carroll except by her photograph:--\r\n\r\n    My dear Gertrude,--So many things have happened since we met\r\n    last, really I don't know _which_ to begin talking\r\n    about! For instance, England has been conquered by William\r\n    the Conqueror. We haven't met since _that_ happened,\r\n    you know. How did you like it? Were you frightened?\r\n\r\n    And one more thing has happened: I have got your\r\n    photograph. Thank you very much for it. I like it \"awfully.\"\r\n    Do they let you say \"awfully\"? or do they say, \"No, my dear;\r\n    little girls mustn't say 'awfully'; they should say 'very\r\n    much indeed'\"?\r\n\r\n    I wonder if you will ever get as far as Jersey? If not, how\r\n    _are_ we to meet?\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nFrom the second letter, to Miss Florence Jackson, I take the following\r\nextract:--\r\n\r\n    I have two reasons for sending you this fable; one is, that\r\n    in a letter you wrote me you said something about my being\r\n    \"clever\"; and the other is that, when you wrote again you\r\n    said it again! And _each_ time I thought, \"Really, I\r\n    _must_ write and ask her _not_ to say such things;\r\n    it is not wholesome reading for me.\"\r\n\r\n    The fable is this. The cold, frosty, bracing air is the\r\n    treatment one gets from the world generally--such as\r\n    contempt, or blame, or neglect; all those are very\r\n    wholesome. And the hot dry air, that you breathe when you\r\n    rush to the fire, is the praise that one gets from one's\r\n    young, happy, rosy, I may even say _florid_ friends!\r\n    And that's very bad for me, and gives pride--fever, and\r\n    conceit--cough, and such-like diseases. Now I'm sure you\r\n    don't want me to be laid up with all these diseases; so\r\n    please don't praise me _any_ more!\r\n\r\nThe verses to \"Matilda Jane\" certainly deserve a place in this\r\nchapter. To make their meaning clear, I must state that Lewis Carroll\r\nwrote them for a little cousin of his, and that Matilda Jane was the\r\nsomewhat prosaic name of her doll. The poem expresses finely the\r\nblind, unreasoning devotion which the infant mind professes for\r\ninanimate objects:--\r\n\r\n        Matilda Jane, you never look\r\n        At any toy or picture-book;\r\n        I show you pretty things in vain,\r\n        You must be blind, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n        I ask you riddles, tell you tales,\r\n        But all our conversation fails;\r\n        You never answer me again,\r\n        I fear you're dumb, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n        Matilda, darling, when I call\r\n        You never seem to hear at all;\r\n        I shout with all my might and main,\r\n        But you're _so_ deaf, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n        Matilda Jane, you needn't mind,\r\n        For though you're deaf, and dumb, and blind,\r\n        There's some one loves you, it is plain,\r\n        And that is _me_, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter I gave some of Mr. Dodgson's letters to Miss\r\nEdith Rix; the two which follow, being largely about children, seem\r\nmore appropriate here:--\r\n\r\n    My dear Edith,--Would you tell your mother I was aghast at\r\n    seeing the address of her letter to me: and I would much\r\n    prefer \"Rev. C.L. Dodgson, Ch. Ch., Oxford.\" When a letter\r\n    comes addressed \"Lewis Carroll, Ch. Ch.,\" it either goes to\r\n    the Dead Letter Office, or it impresses on the minds of all\r\n    letter-carriers, &c., through whose hands it goes, the very\r\n    fact I least want them to know.\r\n\r\n    Please offer to your sister all the necessary apologies for\r\n    the liberty I have taken with her name. My only excuse is,\r\n    that I know no other; and how _am_ I to guess what the\r\n    full name is? It _may_ be Carlotta, or Zealot, or\r\n    Ballot, or Lotus-blossom (a very pretty name), or even\r\n    Charlotte. Never have I sent anything to a young lady of\r\n    whom I have a more shadowy idea. Name, an enigma; age,\r\n    somewhere between 1 and 19 (you've no idea how bewildering\r\n    it is, alternately picturing her as a little toddling thing\r\n    of 5, and a tall girl of 15!); disposition--well, I\r\n    _have_ a fragment of information on _that_\r\n    question--your mother says, as to my coming, \"It must be\r\n    when Lottie is at home, or she would never forgive us.\"\r\n    Still, I _cannot_ consider the mere fact that she is of\r\n    an unforgiving disposition as a complete view of her\r\n    character. I feel sure she has some other qualities besides.\r\n\r\n    Believe me,\r\n\r\n    Yrs affectionately,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear child,--It seems quite within the bounds of\r\n    possibility, if we go on long in this style, that our\r\n    correspondence may at last assume a really friendly tone. I\r\n    don't of course say it will actually do so--that would be\r\n    too bold a prophecy, but only that it may tend to shape\r\n    itself in that direction.\r\n\r\n    Your remark, that slippers for elephants _could_ be\r\n    made, only they would not be slippers, but boots, convinces\r\n    me that there is a branch of your family in _Ireland_.\r\n    Who are (oh dear, oh dear, I am going distracted! There's a\r\n    lady in the opposite house who simply sings _all_ day.\r\n    All her songs are wails, and their tunes, such as they have,\r\n    are much the same. She has one strong note in her voice, and\r\n    she knows it! I _think_ it's \"A natural,\" but I haven't\r\n    much ear. And when she gets to that note, she howls!) they?\r\n    The O'Rixes, I suppose?\r\n\r\n    About your uninteresting neighbours, I sympathise with you\r\n    much; but oh, I wish I had you here, that I might teach you\r\n    _not_ to say \"It is difficult to visit one's district\r\n    regularly, like every one else does!\"\r\n\r\n    And now I come to the most interesting part of your letter--\r\n    May you treat me as a perfect friend, and write anything you\r\n    like to me, and ask my advice? Why, _of course_ you\r\n    may, my child! What else am I good for? But oh, my dear\r\n    child-friend, you cannot guess how such words sound to\r\n    _me_! That any one should look up to _me_, or\r\n    think of asking _my_ advice--well, it makes one feel\r\n    humble, I think, rather than proud--humble to remember,\r\n    while others think so well of me, what I really _am_,\r\n    in myself. \"Thou, that teachest another, teachest thou not\r\n    thyself?\" Well, I won't talk about myself, it is not a\r\n    healthy topic. Perhaps it may be true of _any_ two\r\n    people, that, if one could see the other through and\r\n    through, love would perish. I don't know. Anyhow, I like to\r\n    _have_ the love of my child-friends, tho' I know I\r\n    don't deserve it. Please write as freely as _ever_ you\r\n    like.\r\n\r\n    I went up to town and fetched Phoebe down here on Friday in\r\n    last week; and we spent _most_ of Saturday upon the\r\n    beach--Phoebe  wading and digging, and \"as happy as a bird\r\n    upon the wing\" (to quote the song she sang when first I saw\r\n    her). Tuesday evening brought a telegram to say she was\r\n    wanted at the theatre next morning. So, instead of going to\r\n    bed, Phoebe packed her things, and we left by the last\r\n    train, reaching her home by a quarter to 1 a.m. However,\r\n    even four days of sea-air,  and a new kind of happiness, did\r\n    her good, I think. I am rather lonely now she is gone. She\r\n    is a very sweet child, and a thoughtful child, too. It was\r\n    very touching to see (we had a little Bible-reading every\r\n    day: I tried to remember that my little friend had a soul to\r\n    be cared for, as well as a body) the far-away look in her\r\n    eyes, when we talked of God and of heaven--as if her angel,\r\n    who beholds His face continually, were whispering to her.\r\n\r\n    Of course, there isn't _much_ companionship possible,\r\n    after all, between an old man's mind and a little child's,\r\n    but what there is is sweet--and wholesome, I think.\r\n\r\nThree letters of his to a child-friend, Miss Kathleen Eschwege, now\r\nMrs. Round, illustrate one of those friendships which endure: the sort\r\nof friendship that he always longed for, and so often failed to\r\nsecure:--\r\n\r\n[Illustrations and: Facsimile of a \"Looking-Glass\r\nLetter\" from Lewis Carroll to Miss Edith Ball.]\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., Oxford, _October_ 24, 1879.\r\n\r\n    My dear Kathleen,--I was really pleased to get your letter,\r\n    as I had quite supposed I should never see or hear of you\r\n    again. You see I knew only your Christian name--not the\r\n    ghost of a surname, or the shadow of an address--and I was\r\n    not prepared to spend my little all in advertisements--\"If\r\n    the young lady, who was travelling on the G.W. Railway, &c.\"\r\n    --or to devote the remainder of my life to going about\r\n    repeating \"Kathleen,\" like that young woman who came from\r\n    some foreign land to look for her lover, but only knew that\r\n    he was called \"Edward\" (or \"Richard\" was it? I dare say you\r\n    know History better than I do) and that he lived in England;\r\n    so that naturally it took her some time to find him. All I\r\n    knew was that _you_ could, if you chose, write to me\r\n    through Macmillan: but it is three months since we met, so I\r\n    was _not_ expecting it, and it was a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\n    Well, so I hope I may now count you as one of my\r\n    child-friends. I am fond of children (except boys), and have\r\n    more child-friends than I could possibly count on my\r\n    fingers, even if I were a centipede (by the way, _have_\r\n    they fingers? I'm afraid they're only feet, but, of course,\r\n    they use them for the same purpose, and that is why no other\r\n    insects, _except centipedes_, ever succeed in doing\r\n    _Long Multiplication_), and I have several not so very\r\n    far from you--one at Beckenham, two at Balham, two at Herne\r\n    Hill, one at Peckham--so there is every chance of my being\r\n    somewhere near you _before the year_ 1979. If so, may I\r\n    call? I am _very_ sorry your neck is no better, and I\r\n    wish they would take you to Margate: Margate air will make\r\n    _any_ body well of _any_ thing.\r\n\r\n    It seems you have already got my two books about \"Alice.\"\r\n    Have you also got \"The Hunting of the Snark\"? If not, I\r\n    should be very glad to send you one. The pictures (by Mr.\r\n    Holiday) are pretty: and you needn't read the verses unless\r\n    you like.\r\n\r\n    How do you pronounce your surname? \"esk-weej\"? or how? Is it\r\n    a German name?\r\n\r\n    If you can do \"Doublets,\" with how many links do you turn\r\n    KATH into LEEN?\r\n\r\n    With kind remembrances to your mother, I am\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    Charles L. Dodgson\r\n\r\n    (_alias_ \"Lewis Carroll\").\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., Oxford, _January_ 20, 1892.\r\n\r\n    My dear Kathleen,--Some months ago I heard, from my cousin,\r\n    May Wilcox, that you were engaged to be married. And, ever\r\n    since, I have cherished the intention of writing to offer my\r\n    congratulations. Some might say, \"Why not write _at\r\n    once?\"_ To such unreasoning creatures, the obvious reply\r\n    is, \"When you have bottled some peculiarly fine Port, do you\r\n    usually begin to drink it _at once?\"_ Is not that a\r\n    beautiful simile? Of course, I need not remark that my\r\n    congratulations are like fine old Port--only finer, and\r\n    _older!_\r\n\r\n    Accept, my dear old friend, my _heartiest_ wishes for\r\n    happiness, of all sorts and sizes, for yourself, and for him\r\n    whom you have chosen as your other self. And may you love\r\n    one another with a love second only to your love for God--a\r\n    love that will last through bright days and dark days, in\r\n    sickness and in health, through life and through death.\r\n\r\n    A few years ago I went, in the course of about three months,\r\n    to the weddings of three of my old child-friends. But\r\n    weddings are not very exhilarating scenes for a miserable\r\n    old bachelor; and I think you'll have to excuse me from\r\n    attending _yours_.\r\n\r\n    However, I have so far concerned myself in it that I\r\n    actually _dreamed_ about it a few nights ago! I dreamed\r\n    that you had had a photograph done of the wedding-party, and\r\n    had sent me a copy of it. At one side stood a group of\r\n    ladies, among whom I made out the faces of Dolly and Ninty;\r\n    and in the foreground, seated in a boat, were two people, a\r\n    gentleman and a lady I _think_ (could they have been\r\n    the bridegroom and the bride?) engaged in the natural and\r\n    usual occupation for a riverside picnic--pulling a Christmas\r\n    cracker! I have no idea what put such an idea into my head.\r\n    _I_ never saw crackers used in such a scene!\r\n\r\n    I hope your mother goes on well. With kindest regards to her\r\n    and your father, and love to your sisters--and to yourself\r\n    too, if HE doesn't object!--I am,\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--I never give wedding-presents; so please regard the\r\n    enclosed as an _unwedding_ present.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ch. Ch., Oxford, _December_ 8, 1897.\r\n\r\n    My dear Kathleen,--Many thanks for the photo of yourself and\r\n    your _fiancé_, which duly reached me January 23, 1892.\r\n    Also for a wedding-card, which reached me August 28, 1892.\r\n    Neither of these favours, I fear, was ever acknowledged. Our\r\n    only communication since, has been, that on December 13,\r\n    1892, I sent you a biscuit-box adorned with \"Looking-Glass\"\r\n    pictures. This _you_ never acknowledged; so I was\r\n    properly served for my negligence. I hope your little\r\n    daughter, of whose arrival Mrs. Eschwege told me in\r\n    December, 1893, has been behaving well? How quickly the\r\n    years slip by! It seems only yesterday that I met, on the\r\n    railway, a little girl who was taking a sketch of Oxford!\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate old friend,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nThe following verses were inscribed in a copy of \"Alice's Adventures,\"\r\npresented to the three Miss Drurys in August, 1869:--\r\n\r\n_To three puzzled little girls, from the Author._\r\n\r\n        Three little maidens weary of the rail,\r\n        Three pairs of little ears listening to a tale,\r\n        Three little hands held out in readiness,\r\n        For three little puzzles very hard to guess.\r\n        Three pairs of little eyes, open wonder-wide,\r\n        At three little scissors lying side by side.\r\n        Three little mouths that thanked an unknown Friend,\r\n        For one little book, he undertook to send.\r\n        Though whether they'll remember a friend, or book, or day--\r\n        In three little weeks is very hard to say.\r\n\r\nHe took the same three children to German Reed's entertainment, where\r\nthe triple bill consisted of \"Happy Arcadia,\" \"All Abroad,\" and \"Very\r\nCatching.\" A few days afterwards he sent them \"Phantasmagoria,\" with a\r\nlittle poem on the fly-leaf to remind them of their treat:--\r\n\r\n        Three little maids, one winter day,\r\n          While others went to feed,\r\n        To sing, to laugh, to dance, to play,\r\n          More wisely went to--Reed.\r\n\r\n        Others, when lesson-time's begun,\r\n          Go, half inclined to cry,\r\n        Some in a walk, some in a run;\r\n          But _these_ went in a--Fly.\r\n\r\n        I give to other little maids\r\n          A smile, a kiss, a look,\r\n        Presents whose memory quickly fades,\r\n          I give to these--a Book.\r\n\r\n        _Happy Arcadia _may blind,\r\n          While _all abroad,_ their eyes;\r\n        At home, this book (I trust) they'll find\r\n          A _very catching_ prize.\r\n\r\nThe next three letters were addressed to two of Mr. Arthur Hughes'\r\nchildren. They are good examples of the wild and delightful nonsense\r\nwith which Lewis Carroll used to amuse his little friends:--\r\n\r\n    My dear Agnes,--You lazy thing! What? I'm to divide the\r\n    kisses myself, am I? Indeed I won't take the trouble to do\r\n    anything of the sort! But I'll tell _you_ how to do it.\r\n    First, you must take _four_ of the kisses, and--and\r\n    that reminds me of a very curious thing that happened to me\r\n    at half-past four yesterday. Three visitors came knocking at\r\n    my door, begging me to let them in. And when I opened the\r\n    door, who do you think they were? You'll never guess. Why,\r\n    they were three cats! Wasn't it curious? However, they all\r\n    looked so cross and disagreeable that I took up the first\r\n    thing I could lay my hand on (which happened to be the\r\n    rolling-pin) and knocked them all down as flat as pan-cakes!\r\n    \"If _you_ come knocking at _my_ door,\" I said,\r\n    \"_I_ shall come knocking at _your_ heads.\" \"That\r\n    was fair, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Agnes,--About the cats, you know. Of course I didn't\r\n    leave them lying flat on the ground like dried flowers: no,\r\n    I picked them up, and I was as kind as I could be to them. I\r\n    lent them the portfolio for a bed--they wouldn't have been\r\n    comfortable in a real bed, you know: they were too thin--but\r\n    they were _quite_ happy between the sheets of\r\n    blotting-paper--and  each of them had a pen-wiper for a\r\n    pillow. Well, then I went to bed: but first I lent them the\r\n    three dinner-bells, to ring if they wanted anything in the\r\n    night.\r\n\r\n    You know I have _three_ dinner-bells--the first (which\r\n    is the largest) is rung when dinner is _nearly_ ready;\r\n    the second (which is rather larger) is rung when it is quite\r\n    ready; and the third (which is as large as the other two put\r\n    together) is rung all the time I am at dinner. Well, I told\r\n    them they might ring if they happened to want anything--and,\r\n    as they rang _all_ the bells _all_ night, I\r\n    suppose they did want something or other, only I was too\r\n    sleepy to attend to them.\r\n\r\n    In the morning I gave them some rat-tail jelly and buttered\r\n    mice for breakfast, and they were as discontented as they\r\n    could be. They wanted some boiled pelican, but of course I\r\n    knew it wouldn't be good _for_ them. So all I said was\r\n    \"Go to Number Two, Finborough Road, and ask for Agnes\r\n    Hughes, and if it's _really_ good for you, she'll give\r\n    you some.\" Then I shook hands with them all, and wished them\r\n    all goodbye, and drove them up the chimney. They seemed very\r\n    sorry to go, and they took the bells and the portfolio with\r\n    them. I didn't find this out till after they had gone, and\r\n    then I was sorry too, and wished for them back again. What\r\n    do I mean by \"them\"? Never mind.\r\n\r\n    How are Arthur, and Amy, and Emily? Do they still go up and\r\n    down Finborough Road, and teach the cats to be kind to mice?\r\n    I'm _very_ fond of all the cats in Finborough Road.\r\n\r\n    Give them my love.\r\n    Who do I mean by \"them\"?\r\n    Never mind.\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    Lewis Carroll.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arthur Hughes and his daughter Agnes. _From\r\na photograph by Lewis Carroll._]\r\n\r\n    My dear Amy,--How are you getting on, I wonder, with\r\n    guessing those puzzles from \"Wonderland\"? If you think\r\n    you've found out any of the answers, you may send them to\r\n    me; and if they're wrong, I won't tell you they're right!\r\n\r\n    You asked me after those three cats. Ah! The dear creatures!\r\n    Do you know, ever since that night they first came, they\r\n    have _never left me?_ Isn't it kind of them? Tell Agnes\r\n    this. She will be interested to hear it. And they _are_\r\n    so kind and thoughtful! Do you know, when I had gone out for\r\n    a walk the other day, they got _all_ my books out of\r\n    the bookcase, and opened them on the floor, to be ready for\r\n    me to read. They opened them all at page 50, because they\r\n    thought that would be a nice useful page to begin at. It was\r\n    rather unfortunate, though: because they took my bottle of\r\n    gum, and tried to gum pictures upon the ceiling (which they\r\n    thought would please me), and by accident they spilt a\r\n    quantity of it all over the books. So when they were shut up\r\n    and put by, the leaves all stuck together, and I can never\r\n    read page 50 again in any of them!\r\n\r\n    However, they meant it very kindly, so I wasn't angry. I\r\n    gave them each a spoonful of ink as a treat; but they were\r\n    ungrateful for that, and made dreadful faces. But, of\r\n    course, as it was given them as a treat, they had to drink\r\n    it. One of them has turned black since: it was a white cat\r\n    to begin with.\r\n\r\n    Give my love to any children you happen to meet. Also I send\r\n    two kisses and a half, for you to divide with Agnes, Emily,\r\n    and Godfrey. Mind you divide them fairly.\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent reader will make a discovery about the first of the\r\ntwo following letters, which Miss Maggie Cunningham, the\r\n\"child-friend\" to whom both were addressed, perhaps did not hit upon\r\nat once. Mr. Dodgson wrote these two letters in 1868:--\r\n\r\n    Dear Maggie,--I found that _the friend, _that the\r\n    little girl asked me to write to, lived at Ripon, and not at\r\n    Land's End--a  nice sort of place to invite to! It looked\r\n    rather suspicious to me--and soon after, by dint of\r\n    incessant inquiries, I found out that _she_ was called\r\n    Maggie, and lived in a Crescent! Of course I declared,\r\n    \"After that\" (the language I used doesn't matter), \"I will\r\n    _not_ address her, that's flat! So do not expect me to\r\n    flatter.\"\r\n\r\n    Well, I hope you will soon see your beloved Pa come\r\n    back--for consider, should you be quite content with only\r\n    Jack? Just suppose they made a blunder! (Such things happen\r\n    now and then.) Really, now, I shouldn't wonder if your\r\n    \"John\" came home again, and your father stayed at school! A\r\n    most awkward thing, no doubt. How would you receive him?\r\n    You'll say, perhaps, \"you'd turn him out.\" That would answer\r\n    well, so far as concerns the boy, you know--but consider\r\n    your Papa, learning lessons in a row of great inky\r\n    schoolboys! This (though unlikely) might occur: \"Haly\" would\r\n    be grieved to miss him (don't mention it to _her_).\r\n\r\n    No _carte_ has yet been done of me, that does real\r\n    justice to my _smile_; and so I hardly like, you see,\r\n    to send you one. However, I'll consider if I will or\r\n    not--meanwhile, I send a little thing to give you an idea of\r\n    what I look like when I'm lecturing. The merest sketch, you\r\n    will allow--yet still I think there's something grand in the\r\n    expression of the brow and in the action of the hand.\r\n\r\n    Have you read my fairy tale in _Aunt Judy's Magazine?_\r\n    If you have you will not fail to discover what I mean when I\r\n    say \"Bruno yesterday came to remind me that _he_ was my\r\n    god-son!\"--on the ground that I \"gave him a name\"!\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    C.L. Dodgson.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--I would send, if I were not too shy, the same message\r\n    to \"Haly\" that she (though I do not deserve it, not I!) has\r\n    sent through her sister to me. My best love to yourself--to\r\n    your Mother my kindest regards--to your small, fat,\r\n    impertinent, ignorant brother my hatred. I think that is\r\n    all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: What I look like when I'm Lecturing. _From a\r\ndrawing, by Lewis Carroll._]\r\n\r\n    My dear Maggie,--I am a very bad correspondent, I fear, but\r\n    I hope you won't leave off writing to me on that account. I\r\n    got the little book safe, and will do my best about putting\r\n    my name in, if I can only manage to remember what day my\r\n    birthday is--but one forgets these things so easily.\r\n\r\n    Somebody told me (a little bird, I suppose) that you had\r\n    been having better photographs done of yourselves. If so, I\r\n    hope you will let me buy copies. Fanny will pay you for\r\n    them. But, oh Maggie, how _can_ you ask for a better\r\n    one of me than the one I sent! It is one of the best ever\r\n    done! Such grace, such dignity, such benevolence, such--as a\r\n    great secret (please don't repeat it) the _Queen_ sent\r\n    to ask for a copy of it, but as it is against my rule to\r\n    give in such a case, I was obliged to answer--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Dodgson presents his compliments to her Majesty, and\r\n    regrets to say that his rule is never to give his photograph\r\n    except to _young_ ladies.\" I am told she was annoyed\r\n    about it, and said, \"I'm not so old as all that comes to!\"\r\n    and one doesn't like to annoy Queens; but really I couldn't\r\n    help it, you know.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter with some reminiscences of Lewis Carroll,\r\nwhich have been kindly sent me by an old child-friend of his, Mrs.\r\nMaitland, daughter of the late Rev. E.A. Litton, Rector of Naunton,\r\nand formerly Fellow of Oriel College and Vice-Principal of Saint\r\nEdmund's Hall:--\r\n\r\n    To my mind Oxford will be never quite the same again now\r\n    that so many of the dear old friends of one's childhood have\r\n    \"gone over to the great majority.\"\r\n\r\n    Often, in the twilight, when the flickering firelight danced\r\n    on the old wainscotted wall, have we--father and I--chatted\r\n    over the old Oxford days and friends, and the merry times we\r\n    all had together in Long Wall Street. I was a nervous, thin,\r\n    remarkably ugly child then, and for some years I was left\r\n    almost entirely to the care of Mary Pearson, my own\r\n    particular attendant. I first remember Mr. Dodgson when I\r\n    was about seven years old, and from that time until we went\r\n    to live in Gloucestershire he was one of my most delightful\r\n    friends.\r\n\r\n    I shall never forget how Mr. Dodgson and I sat once under a\r\n    dear old tree in the Botanical Gardens, and how he told me,\r\n    for the first time, Hans Andersen's story of the \"Ugly\r\n    Duckling.\" I cannot explain the charm of Mr. Dodgson's way\r\n    of telling stories; as he spoke, the characters seemed to be\r\n    real flesh and blood. This particular story made a great\r\n    impression upon me, and interested me greatly, as I was very\r\n    sensitive about my ugly little self. I remember his\r\n    impressing upon me that it was better to be good and\r\n    truthful and to try not to think of oneself than to be a\r\n    pretty, selfish child, spoiled and disagreeable; and, after\r\n    telling me this story, he gave me the name of \"Ducky.\"\r\n    \"Never mind, little Ducky,\" he used often to say, \"perhaps\r\n    some day you will turn out a swan.\"\r\n\r\n    I always attribute my love for animals to the teaching of\r\n    Mr. Dodgson: his stories about them, his knowledge of their\r\n    lives and histories, his enthusiasm about birds and\r\n    butterflies enlivened many a dull hour. The monkeys in the\r\n    Botanical Gardens were our special pets, and when we fed\r\n    them with nuts and biscuits he seemed to enjoy the fun as\r\n    much as I did.\r\n\r\n    Every day my nurse and I used to take a walk in Christ\r\n    Church Meadows, and often we would sit down on the soft\r\n    grass, with the dear old Broad Walk quite close, and, when\r\n    we raised our eyes, Merton College, with its walls covered\r\n    with Virginian creeper. And how delighted we used to be to\r\n    see the well-known figure in cap and gown coming, so\r\n    swiftly, with his kind smile ready to welcome the \"Ugly\r\n    Duckling.\" I knew, as he sat beside me, that a book of fairy\r\n    tales was hidden in his pocket, or that he would have some\r\n    new game or puzzle to show me--and he would gravely accept a\r\n    tiny daisy-bouquet for his coat with as much courtesy as if\r\n    it had been the finest hot-house _boutonnière_.\r\n\r\n    Two or three times I went fishing with him from the bank\r\n    near the Old Mill, opposite Addison's Walk, and he quite\r\n    entered into my happiness when a small fish came wriggling\r\n    up at the end of my bent pin, just ready for the dinner of\r\n    the little white kitten \"Lily,\" which he had given me.\r\n\r\n    My hair was a great trouble to me, as a child, for it would\r\n    tangle, and Mary was not too patient with me, as I twisted\r\n    about while she was trying to dress it. One day I received a\r\n    long blue envelope addressed to myself, which contained a\r\n    story-letter, full of drawings, from Mr. Dodgson. The first\r\n    picture was of a little girl--with her hat off and her\r\n    tumbled hair very much in evidence--asleep on a rustic bench\r\n    under a big tree by the riverside, and two birds, holding\r\n    what was evidently a very important conversation, above in\r\n    the branches, their heads on one side, eyeing the sleeping\r\n    child. Then there was a picture of the birds flying up to\r\n    the child with twigs and straw in their beaks, preparing to\r\n    build their nest in her hair. Next came the awakening, with\r\n    the nest completed, and the mother-bird sitting on it; while\r\n    the father-bird flew round the frightened child. And then,\r\n    lastly, hundreds of birds--the air thick with them--the\r\n    child fleeing, small boys with tin trumpets raised to their\r\n    lips to add to the confusion, and Mary, armed with a basket\r\n    of brushes and combs, bringing up the rear! After this,\r\n    whenever I was restive while my hair was being arranged,\r\n    Mary would show me the picture of the child with the nest on\r\n    her head, and I at once became \"as quiet as a lamb.\"\r\n\r\n    I had a daily governess, a dear old soul, who used to come\r\n    every morning to teach me. I disliked particularly the\r\n    large-lettered copies which she used to set me; and as I\r\n    confided this to Mr. Dodgson, he came and gave me some\r\n    copies himself. The only ones which I can remember were\r\n    \"Patience and water-gruel cure gout\" (I always wondered what\r\n    \"gout\" might be) and \"Little girls should be seen and not\r\n    heard\" (which I thought unkind). These were written many\r\n    times over, and I had to present the pages to him, without\r\n    one blot or smudge, at the end of the week.\r\n\r\n    One of the Fellows of Magdalen College at that time was a\r\n    Mr. Saul, a friend of my father's and of Mr. Dodgson, and a\r\n    great lover of music--his rooms were full of musical\r\n    instruments of every sort. Mr. Dodgson and father and I all\r\n    went one afternoon to pay him a visit. At that time he was\r\n    much interested in the big drum, and we found him when we\r\n    arrived in full practice, with his music-book open before\r\n    him. He made us all join in the concert. Father undertook\r\n    the 'cello, and Mr. Dodgson hunted up a comb and some paper,\r\n    and, amidst much fun and laughter, the walls echoed with the\r\n    finished roll, or shake, of the big drum--a roll that was\r\n    Mr. Saul's delight.\r\n\r\n    My father died on August 27, 1897, and Mr. Dodgson on\r\n    January 14, 1898. And we, who are left behind in this cold,\r\n    weary world can only hope we may some day meet them again.\r\n    Till then, oh! Father, and my dear old childhood's friend,\r\n    _requiescalis in pace!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NOTES ON THE FIRST TWO BOOKS OF EUCLID.\"                     1860\r\n  Oxford: Parker. 8vo. 6d\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PHOTOGRAPHS.\"                                             (?)1860\r\n  (Printed for private circulation; a\r\n  list of negatives taken by the Rev.
