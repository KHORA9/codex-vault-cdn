It is merely an attempt to sketch,\r\nfrom materials of which some of the most valuable and interesting\r\nhave become accessible to students only within a comparatively\r\nrecent period, the life-story of a prince who reigned less than ten\r\nyears and lived less than forty-two, yet whose personal character,\r\npeculiar circumstances, and adventurous career have given him—whether\r\ndeservedly or not—a conspicuous place in mediæval history, and made\r\nhim a hero of romance in every country from England to Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe only detailed biography of Richard known to me is that which Mr.\r\nG. P. R. James wrote many years ago. A wealth of material unknown\r\nat that time has since then been placed within our reach. This\r\nis especially the case with regard to the Crusade of 1191-1192.\r\nRichard’s struggle with Saladin is the phase of his career which\r\nhas contributed the most to his fame; and my studies have led me\r\nto believe that he himself regarded it as the most important work\r\nof his life. Every step in his policy from the hour when he took\r\nthe Cross till he set out for Holy Land appears to have been taken\r\nprimarily, if not solely, with a view to the one enterprise which his\r\ncontemporaries emphatically called “the work of God”; and there is no\r\nreason to doubt that when compelled to leave that work unfinished,\r\nhe left it with the full intention of returning to complete it, and\r\nwould have returned, had not his destiny been ordained otherwise. I\r\nhave therefore allowed myself to tell the story of the Crusade with\r\na fullness of detail which may be thought disproportionate to the\r\nbrief space of time which the expedition actually occupied, and to\r\nits direct influence on the history of his dominions; and I have made\r\na lavish use of the materials, Eastern and Western, contained in the\r\npublications of the various French literary and historical societies,\r\nespecially the great _Recueil des Historiens des Croisades_. The\r\nchief treasure in that collection—chief, at least, for my purpose—is\r\nthe elaborate edition of Bohadin with its French translation,\r\nsuperseding the crabbed Latin of Schultens; although, as will be\r\nseen, I cannot but think that Schultens’s work still retains a value\r\nof its own. Of the relations between the two versions of our chief\r\nWestern authority for the story of the Crusade—the _Itinerarium\r\nPeregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi_ and the _Estoire de la Guerre\r\nSainte par Ambroise_—I made, about fourteen years ago, a somewhat\r\nminute study based on the notes written by Mr. T. A. Archer in the\r\nmargins of his copies of those two books; I having had the melancholy\r\npleasure of becoming their owner after his death. The results of\r\nthat study, with a brief statement of the circumstances which had\r\nimpelled me to it and assisted me in it, appeared in the _English\r\nHistorical Review_ for July 1910. After going over the ground again I\r\nsee no reason to alter the conclusion which I had then formed on the\r\nsubject; rather do I find myself confirmed in that opinion. I have,\r\nhowever, thought it right, when citing either or both of the two\r\nversions, to give in every case a separate reference to each of them.\r\n\r\n                                                         KATE NORGATE.\r\n\r\n  _January, 1924._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK I\r\n\r\n  RICHARD OF AQUITAINE, 1157-1189\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n  THE BOY DUKE, 1157-1179                                            1\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  FATHER AND SONS, 1179-1183                                        32\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  KING HENRY’S HEIR, 1183-1189                                      57\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK II\r\n\r\n  RICHARD’S CRUSADE, 1189-1192\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  THE YEAR OF PREPARATION, 1189-1190                                91\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  THE OUTWARD VOYAGE, 1190-1191                                    119\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  THE FALL OF ACRE, 1191                                           152\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  FROM ACRE TO JOPPA, 1191                                         176\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  THE ADVANCE ON JERUSALEM, 1191-1192                              193\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  RICHARD AND SALADIN, 1192                                        230\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK III\r\n\r\n  RICHARD AND EUROPE, 1192-1199\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  RICHARD AND THE EMPIRE, 1192-1194                                264\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  RICHARD AND FRANCE, 1194-1199                                    294\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTES\r\n\r\n  I.

(Geoffrey of Vigeois, A.D. 1185).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE BOY DUKE\r\n\r\n1157-1179\r\n\r\n  Bonum est viro cum portaverit jugum adolescentia sua.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The eagle of the broken covenant shall rejoice in her third\r\nnesting”—thus ran one of the predictions in the so-called “prophecy\r\nof Merlin,” which in the latter half of the twelfth century\r\nwas generally regarded as shadowing forth the destiny of Henry\r\nFitz-Empress and his family. “The queen,” said those who interpreted\r\nthe prophecy after the event, “is called the eagle of the broken\r\ncovenant because she spread out her wings over two realms, France and\r\nEngland, but was separated from the one by divorce and from the other\r\nby long imprisonment. And whereas her first-born son, William, died\r\nin infancy, and the second, Henry, in rebellion against his father,\r\nRichard, the son of her third nesting, strove in all things to bring\r\nglory to his mother’s name.”[1]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to mar the rejoicing of either Eleanor or Henry in\r\nSeptember 1157. The young king had overcome the difficulties which\r\nhad beset him at the opening of his reign. Public order and the\r\nregular administration of public justice had been restored throughout\r\nhis realm. He had obtained the French king’s recognition of his\r\nrights over Normandy and the Angevin lands, and also over Eleanor’s\r\nduchy of Aquitaine,[2] where in the winter of 1156 he had received\r\nthe homage of the barons and kept the Christmas festival with her\r\nat Bordeaux.[3] King and queen [Sidenote: 1157] returned to England\r\nin the spring.[4] Soon afterwards the last remnant of opposition to\r\nthe rule of the Angevin king in England had been disarmed in the\r\npersons of Earl Hugh of Norfolk and Count William of Boulogne; Henry\r\nhad “subdued all the Welsh to his will,”[5] and received, together\r\nwith the homage of Malcolm of Scotland, a formal restitution of\r\nNorthumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland,[6] which had been in the\r\npossession of the Scots since 1136. From these successes Henry had\r\neither just returned, or was on his way back to rejoin his queen at\r\nOxford, when their third son was born there—no doubt in Beaumont\r\npalace—on September 8.[7] A woman of S. Alban’s was chosen for the\r\nboy’s nurse and fostered him together with her own son, born on the\r\nsame night and afterwards known as Alexander Neckam,[8] author of a\r\ntreatise on natural science or what passed for science in his time.\r\nHer name was Hodierna; in later days she had from the royal domains\r\nin Chippenham an annuity of seven pounds, doubtless granted to her by\r\nher royal nursling, whom she seems to have survived by some twenty\r\nyears.[9] Whether she dwelt at the court while he was under her\r\ncharge, or whether, like his ancestor Geoffrey Martel, he was sent to\r\ndwell with his foster-mother, there is nothing to show. Before he was\r\ntwo years old his destiny was planned by the king; Richard was to be\r\nheir to the dominions of his mother.\r\n\r\n“Aquitaine,” says an English writer of the time, “abounding in riches\r\nof many kinds, excels other parts of the western world in such wise\r\nthat it is reckoned by historians as one of the happiest and most\r\nfertile among the provinces of Gaul. Although its fields respond\r\nabundantly to culture, its vines to propagation, and its woodlands to\r\nthe chase, yet nevertheless it takes its name not from any of these\r\nadvantages, but from its waters (_aquæ_), haply esteeming as alone\r\nworthy of account among its delights that which its health-giving\r\nwater brings forth either to be returned to the sea, or uplifted\r\nin the air. If, indeed, we track the Garonne from its fount along\r\nits rapid course to the sea, and if we also follow the line of the\r\nPyrenean mountains, all the country that lies between derives its\r\nname from the beneficent waters that flow through it. Furthermore,\r\nin those parts smoothness of tongue is so general that it promises\r\nimpunity to everybody, and any one who knows not the manner of that\r\npeople cannot know whether they are more constant in deed than in\r\nword. When they set themselves to tame the pride of their enemies,\r\nthey do it in earnest; and when the labours of battle are over and\r\nthey settle down to rest in peace, they give themselves up wholly to\r\npleasure.”[10]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of Dean Ralph’s etymology, there was an\r\nelement of truth in his description, half jesting though it seems to\r\nbe, of the country and the character of its people. He gives indeed\r\nhardly sufficient prominence to the pugnacious side of the latter;\r\nand the boundaries which he assigns to the former are considerably\r\nnarrower than those of the duchy of Aquitaine as it stood at the time\r\nof Richard’s birth. That duchy comprised, in theory at least, fully\r\none-third of the kingdom of France. As counts of Poitou its dukes\r\nbore direct sway over a territory bounded on the north by Britanny,\r\nAnjou, and Touraine, on the west by the sea from the bay now known\r\nas that of Bourgneuf to the mouth of the Charente, and on the east\r\n(roughly) by the course of the river Creuse from a little distance\r\nbelow Argenton to its junction with the Vienne; and also over the\r\ndependent district of Saintonge on the north side of the estuary of\r\nthe Garonne, or Gironde. As counts of Gascony they were overlords\r\nof a number of lesser counties and lordships, extending from the\r\nmouth of the Garonne to the Pyrenees, and forming a territory\r\nnearly twice the size of Poitou. Between Poitou and Gascony lay the\r\ncounties of Angoulême, La Marche, and Périgord, and, between the\r\ntwo latter, a cluster of minor fiefs which collectively formed the\r\ndistrict known as the Limousin, and of which the most important was\r\nthe viscounty of Limoges. All these had from early times owned the\r\noverlordship of the Poitevin counts in their ducal capacity. So, too,\r\nhad Berry, an extensive district lying to the north of La Marche.\r\nThe north-eastern portion of Berry, which formed the viscounty of\r\nBourges, had, however, for a long time past been lost to the dukes\r\nand reckoned as part of the Royal Domain of France. On the eastern\r\nand south-eastern borders of the duchy lay the counties of Auvergne\r\nand Toulouse. Toulouse, with its dependencies—the Quercy or county of\r\nCahors, Alby, Foix, Carcassonne, Cerdagne and Roussillon—had always\r\nbeen a separate fief held directly of the Crown; but the right to\r\nits ownership had for the last sixty years been in dispute between\r\nthe Poitevin counts and its actual holders, the house of St. Gilles,\r\nwho also held the neighbouring county of Rouergue and with it the\r\noverlordship of a number of smaller fiefs along the southern coast.\r\nAuvergne, originally a part of the Aquitanian duchy, was strongly\r\ndisposed to reject the authority of the Poitevin dukes; and both\r\nAuvergne and Toulouse were more or less openly supported in this\r\nmatter by the French king. Nor were the other underfiefs of the\r\nduchy, or even the barons of Poitou, by any means models of feudal\r\nobedience. For a century or more the dukes had been periodically at\r\nstrife with the counts of Angoulême, the counts of La Marche, the\r\nlords of Lusignan (in Poitou), the viscounts of Limoges, and the\r\nneighbours and rivals of these last.[11] It was little more than\r\ntwenty years since Count William of Angoulême had carried off from\r\nPoitiers Eleanor’s stepmother, the Countess Emma, “by the counsel of\r\nthe chiefs of the Limousin who feared lest the Poitevin yoke should\r\nbe laid more heavily upon them” owing to her marriage with the duke,\r\nshe being a daughter and a possible co-heiress of the viscount of\r\nLimoges.[12] At Limoges itself, moreover, there seems to have been a\r\nperennial rivalry between the bishop, the viscount, the abbot of the\r\ngreat abbey of S. Martial, and the townsfolk.[13]\r\n\r\nWhen Henry II went to Limoges after his marriage in 1152 he seems to\r\nhave been welcomed as duke by the viscount; but strife arose between\r\nhis followers and the citizens which so enraged him that he ordered\r\nthe recently built walls of the town to be razed and the bridge to\r\nbe destroyed. As the town—locally called “the castle”—was held by\r\nthe viscount of the abbot, this was an offence to all parties at\r\nonce; and the abbot retorted by refusing to grant the duke’s claim\r\nto a procuration in the city—that is, outside the walls—saying he\r\nwas only bound to grant it within the enclosure of the “castle.”[14]\r\nHenry, though angry, had his mind fixed on more important matters,\r\nand let the insult pass; but on his next visit to Limoges, in\r\n[Sidenote: 1156] 1156, he successfully asserted his ducal rights.[15]\r\nIn the [Sidenote: 1159] spring or early summer of 1159 he again went\r\nto Aquitaine, to prosecute by force of arms his claim, as Eleanor’s\r\nhusband, to the county of Toulouse. The support of the Count of\r\nBarcelona and his wife, the Queen of Aragon, was purchased by a\r\npromise that Richard should wed their infant daughter and should on\r\nhis marriage receive the Dukedom of Aquitaine.[16] The Quercy was\r\nconquered by Henry and held for him awhile after he had abandoned the\r\nsiege of Toulouse and returned to Normandy. A treaty made between\r\n[Sidenote: 1160] Henry and Louis of France in May 1160 contained a\r\nprovision for a year’s truce between Henry and Raymond of Toulouse,\r\nduring which Henry was to keep “whatever he at the date of the\r\ntreaty had of the honour of Toulouse, Cahors, or Quercy.”[17] This\r\nwas probably not much, as his troops had already been withdrawn from\r\nthe conquered territory; the greater part of it seems to have fallen\r\nback into Raymond’s hands, and we hear nothing more of the relations\r\nbetween him and Henry for nearly thirteen years.\r\n\r\nWhere and how the future duke of Aquitaine was being brought up there\r\nis nothing to show. All that we know about him, till he was well\r\nadvanced in his thirteenth year, is that the sheriffs of London\r\npaid ten pounds six and eightpence for his travelling expenses\r\non some occasion—probably [Sidenote: 1163] his elder brother’s\r\nbirthday feast—in 1163,[18] and that in May 1165 he went with his\r\nmother and eldest sister [Sidenote: 1165-6] to join the king in\r\nNormandy.[19] Henry’s quarrel with S. Thomas of Canterbury was then\r\nat its height; and Henry’s discontented subjects in Aquitaine were\r\nquick to take advantage of the opportunity for mischief given them\r\nby the difficulties with France in which that quarrel involved him.\r\nOn the pretext of “certain liberties whereof he had deprived them”\r\nsome of them became so troublesome—chiefly, it seems, by their\r\nintrigues with King Louis[20]—that [Sidenote: 1166] in November 1166\r\nhe summoned them to a conference at Chinon. It took place on Sunday,\r\nNovember 19,[21] with so little result that he sent Eleanor, who\r\nhad apparently been trying to maintain order in the duchy during\r\nhis absence, back to England and himself went to keep Christmas at\r\nPoitiers.[22] Whether Richard went with his mother or stayed with his\r\nfather does not appear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1167]\r\n\r\nIn March Henry had a conference with Raymond of Toulouse at\r\nGrandmont. Shortly afterwards he tried to assert his ducal authority\r\nover the count of Auvergne. The only result was a fresh rupture\r\nwith Louis,[23] which was temporarily patched up by a truce made in\r\nAugust to last till Easter next, March 31, 1168.[24] Before that\r\ndate a formidable rebellion broke out in Aquitaine. The counts\r\n[Sidenote: 1167-8] of Angoulême and La Marche,[25] the viscount of\r\nThouars,[26] [Sidenote: =1167-8=] Robert of Seilhac in the Limousin\r\nand his brother Hugh,[27] Aimeric of Lusignan in Poitou, Geoffrey of\r\nRancogne in the [Sidenote: 1168] county of Angoulême,[28] “with many\r\nothers,” sought to rebel against the king, and went about ravaging\r\nwith fire and sword. When the king heard of this he hurried to the\r\nplace, took the strong castle of Lusignan and made it stronger still,\r\nand destroyed the villages and fortresses of the rebels. He then\r\nrevictualled his own castles, and left the duchy under the charge of\r\nEleanor (who had rejoined him after Christmas) and of Earl Patrick\r\nof Salisbury, while he himself went to meet Louis on the Norman\r\nborder on April 7.[29] The truce between the kings was now expired,\r\nand Henry desired a treaty of peace; but meanwhile the southern\r\nrebels were urging Louis to insist that Henry should indemnify them\r\nfor the loss and damage which he had inflicted upon them, and which\r\nthey represented as a breach of his truce with France, the French\r\nking being supreme lord of Aquitaine.[30] They even placed in the\r\nhands of Louis the hostages which they had promised to Henry.[31]\r\nLouis did not go to the conference in person, but sent some nobles\r\nto represent him.[32] To them Henry proposed a new scheme for the\r\nfuture of Aquitaine: that its young duke-designate should marry the\r\nyoungest daughter of Louis. The French envoys refused to bind their\r\nsovereign to this unexpected condition; it was, however, agreed\r\n“that if Richard should ask for his rights over the Count of St.\r\nGilles”—that is, of Toulouse—“the king of France should try the\r\ncause in his court.” Thus the settlement of Aquitaine on Richard\r\nwas, by implication at least, recognized by France, although Richard\r\nhimself was not yet eleven years old. As to the aggrieved nobles,\r\nHenry promised them restitution;[33] but Louis would not give up the\r\nhostages; and the conference ended in another truce to last till the\r\noctave of midsummer.[34]\r\n\r\nScarcely had the parties separated when tidings came that Earl\r\nPatrick had been slain in a fight with some of the malcontents.[35]\r\nHenry was too much overburdened with other cares to attempt during\r\nthe rest of that year any personal intervention in Aquitaine. Eleanor\r\nseems to have urged him to make it formally over to Richard.[36] She\r\nprobably saw that there was no likelihood of a good understanding\r\nbetween her people and her Angevin husband, and hoped to be more\r\nsuccessful in governing them herself in the name of her son. Her\r\nsuggestion, and that which Henry had made nine months before to\r\nthe representatives [Sidenote: 1169] of Louis, were both carried\r\ninto effect on January 6, 1169, when the two kings made peace at\r\nMontmirail. The two elder sons of Henry and Eleanor were both present\r\nat the meeting. Henry himself first did homage to Louis for his\r\ncontinental possessions; young Henry did the like for Britanny, Anjou\r\nand Maine; then Richard was betrothed to the French king’s daughter\r\nAloysia, and likewise performed the homage due to Louis for the\r\ncounty of Poitou and the duchy of Aquitaine.[37]\r\n\r\nThe feudal situation created by these transactions was a strange one.\r\nIt was capable of at least two different interpretations, and its\r\npractical result, so far as Aquitaine was concerned, was that for\r\nthe next twenty years there were two dukes of that country. Henry’s\r\npurpose in thus making his sons do homage to Louis was to guard\r\nagainst the possibility of dispute, after his own death, as to the\r\nportion of his dominions to which each of them was entitled. In his\r\neyes the homage was anticipatory of a future and perhaps—for he was\r\nnot yet thirty-six—still very remote event, and its effect was merely\r\nprospective. But, so far as can be seen, no such limitation of its\r\nscope was expressed in the act of homage; and the legal effect of\r\nthat act therefore was not merely prospective, but immediate; it at\r\nonce made the younger Henry and Richard respectively count of Anjou\r\nand duke of Aquitaine, not under the suzerainty of their father, but\r\nunder the direct overlordship of the French king. Such at least would\r\nbe its legal effect as soon as the boys were old enough to govern\r\nfor themselves; and this age young Henry had almost reached, for he\r\nwas in his fourteenth year. Their father, on the other hand, as the\r\nsequel shows, never intended to give during his own lifetime any\r\nreal authority at all to young Henry, nor did he intend to give any\r\nto Richard otherwise than with a tacit but perfectly well understood\r\nreservation of his own right of intervention and control whenever\r\nhe might choose to exercise it; and he still remained legally both\r\ncount and duke, for he had just repeated, in both capacities, his\r\nown homage to Louis. There can be no doubt that Louis was fully\r\nalive (although it seems that Henry was not) to the advantages\r\nwhich the French Crown might derive from this complicated state of\r\naffairs. But he was, of course, not desirous of pointing them out\r\nto his rival; and during the next four years he carefully refrained\r\nfrom all interference with the affairs of the Angevin dominions.\r\nThe new duke of Aquitaine was, however, not yet twelve years old,\r\nand it was clearly with the French king’s sanction that his father,\r\nin the spring, marched into the duchy and forcibly brought the\r\ncounts of Angoulême and La Marche and most of the other rebels to\r\nsubmission.[38]\r\n\r\nOur only certain notice of Richard between January 1169 and June 1172\r\nshows him to have been, at some time in [Sidenote: 1170] 1170, at\r\nLimoges with his mother, laying the foundation-stone of the abbey of\r\nS. Augustine.[39] On the Octave of [Sidenote: 1172] Whit-Sunday, June\r\n11, 1172, his formal installation as duke took place at Poitiers. In\r\nthe abbey church of S. Hilary he was placed, according to custom, in\r\nthe abbot’s chair, and the sacred lance and banner which were the\r\ninsignia of the ducal office were given to him by the Archbishop\r\nof Bordeaux and the Bishop of Poitiers. He afterwards proceeded to\r\nLimoges, where he was received with a solemn procession; the ring of\r\nS. Valeria, the protomartyr of Aquitaine, was placed on his finger,\r\nand he was then proclaimed as “the new Duke”[40]—for it was in virtue\r\nof this double investiture, given not by the king of France, but\r\nby the local prelates and clergy as representatives of the local\r\nsaints of the land, that the dukes of Aquitaine claimed to hold their\r\ndukedom.\r\n\r\nEight months later another important ceremony took place at Limoges.\r\nHenry and Eleanor, accompanied by their two elder sons, held court\r\nin the castle for a week with the kings of Aragon and Navarre, and\r\nthe counts of Toulouse and Maurienne. Alfonso of Aragon, Raymond of\r\nToulouse, and Humbert of Maurienne had met Henry at Montferrand in\r\nAuvergne, the last-named to make a treaty of marriage between his\r\ndaughter and Henry’s youngest [Sidenote: 1173] son, John, the two\r\nformer to seek the king’s mediation in a quarrel between themselves.\r\nAlfonso was the son of Queen Petronilla and Raymond of Barcelona, and\r\nbrother of the girl to whom Richard had been betrothed in 1159. He\r\nand Raymond of Toulouse were at strife about the homage of Cerdagne,\r\nFoix, and Carcassonne; both were anxious for the friendship of their\r\nnearest and most powerful neighbour. Henry “made peace between\r\nthem,” and Raymond, whose territories were ringed in by those of\r\nAragon and Aquitaine, paid the peacemaker his price; “he became the\r\nman of the king, and of the new king his son, and of Count Richard\r\nof Poitou, to hold Toulouse of them”—that is, to hold it immediately\r\nof Richard, who held it under his elder brother and his father—“as a\r\nhereditary fief, by military service at the summons of either king or\r\ncount, and by a yearly payment of a hundred marks of silver or of ten\r\ndestriers worth at least ten marks each.”[41]\r\n\r\nA few months later Richard entered actively on public life; and he\r\nmade a bad beginning. Towards the end of March the younger King Henry\r\nfled from his father’s court in Normandy to that of Louis.[42] The\r\nelder Henry had been warned at Limoges by Raymond of Toulouse that\r\n“his wife and his sons had formed a conspiracy against him”;[43]\r\nbut he had disregarded the warning, and left Richard and Geoffrey\r\nin Aquitaine under the guardianship of their mother. Early in the\r\nsummer both the lads joined their elder brother in France,[44] and\r\nall three pledged themselves by a solemn oath, at a great council in\r\nParis, “not to forsake the king of France, nor to make any peace with\r\ntheir father save through him (Louis) and the French barons”; Louis\r\nin return swearing, and causing his barons to swear, “that he would\r\nhelp the young king and his brothers, to the utmost of his power, to\r\nmaintain their war against their father and to gain possession of the\r\nkingdom of England” for young Henry.[45]\r\n\r\nThe “young king” was eighteen years old; he was as shallow-minded\r\nand selfish as he was handsome and superficially attractive; and he\r\nhad fallen under the influence of Louis, to whose daughter he was\r\nmarried. Crowned in 1170 as his father’s heir, he chose to consider\r\nhimself aggrieved by being given no share in the government of\r\nEngland or of the Angevin home-lands. He may have persuaded his\r\nbrothers to consider themselves as victims of a similar grievance\r\nwith regard to their duchies of Aquitaine and Britanny. He and Louis\r\nwere naturally anxious to secure the forces of those two duchies in\r\nsupport of their scheme of ousting the elder King Henry from his\r\ndominions, continental and insular; and they hoped that the example\r\nof the boy-dukes might help to detach their respective vassals from\r\ntheir father’s cause.[46] But the lads had a nearer counsellor than\r\nyoung Henry or Louis, and one to whose counsels it was only natural,\r\nand in a measure right, that they should listen with reverence and\r\nsubmission. Eleanor unquestionably sided with her elder son against\r\nher husband, for she was caught in the act of trying to make her\r\nway from Aquitaine to the French court disguised in the dress of a\r\nman.[47] Certainly nothing can justify, or even excuse, the duplicity\r\nof this “eagle of the broken covenant” towards the husband and\r\nsovereign who, even when his eyes were fully opened to the treason\r\nof their eldest son, still put such confidence in her loyalty as\r\nto leave the younger eaglets in her charge. But there is a very\r\nconsiderable excuse for Richard and Geoffrey. On the ground of that\r\nfeudal loyalty which was a principle of such importance in the life\r\nof those days, there was, indeed, something to be said for all three\r\nof the brothers, and more especially for Richard. None of them were\r\nhomagers of Henry II; all of them were homagers of Louis and of Louis\r\nalone. For Richard it might further be urged that if he was under\r\nany other feudal obligation, it was more to his mother than to his\r\nfather; his possession of Aquitaine was their joint gift, but it was\r\non Eleanor’s consent that the validity of the gift really rested;\r\nHenry possessed the dukedom only in right of his wife. On the higher\r\nground of filial duty Henry’s and Eleanor’s claims to the obedience\r\nof their children were equal; Richard and Geoffrey suddenly found\r\nthat those claims were conflicting, and that a choice must be made\r\nbetween the two. That the choice really lay between right and wrong\r\nis much plainer to us than it could be to these lads, of whom the\r\nelder was not yet sixteen, and both of whom were under the direct\r\npersonal influence of their mother. On her, rather than on them, lies\r\nthe responsibility for their wrong choice.\r\n\r\nEleanor, captured by some of her husband’s scouts, was at once\r\nplaced by him in strict confinement.[48] Her eldest son’s cause\r\ngained practically nothing by the adhesion of his young brothers.\r\nAccording to one account, both of them accompanied him to the siege\r\nof Drincourt in July.[49] The success of that siege, however,\r\nwas due, not to any of the three, but to their allies the counts\r\nof Flanders and Boulogne; moreover, the death of the latter soon\r\nafterwards caused the Flemish troops to withdraw to their own\r\ncountry, and nothing further came of the expedition.[50] The rebel\r\nbarons of Geoffrey’s duchy all submitted to his father in the\r\nautumn.[51] At a conference on September 25 at Gisors Henry made\r\nfair offers to all three of his sons; “but the king of France did\r\nnot deem it advisable that the [English] king’s sons should make\r\npeace with their father.”[52] At some time before the end of the\r\nyear Richard was knighted by Louis.[53] Young Henry and Geoffrey\r\nseem to have remained at the French court through the winter,\r\nbut Richard characteristically went his own way; he returned to\r\nAquitaine. Considering the extent of that country and the character\r\nof its previous relations with Henry II, it seems to have furnished\r\na very small proportion of names to the list of avowed partizans of\r\nthe young king; and the more important Aquitanian names which we do\r\nfind there are those of men whose disobedience is very unlikely to\r\nhave been in any way connected with that of Richard—Count William\r\nof Angoulême, Geoffrey of Rancogne, Geoffrey and Guy of Lusignan,\r\nWilliam of Chauvigny, and Thomas of Coulonges in Poitou, Charles of\r\nRochefort in Saintonge, Robert of Blé in the Limousin, and in Gascony\r\nJocelyn of Maulay and Archbishop William of Bordeaux.[54] The first\r\nfour of these needed no incitement from the young duke’s example,\r\nand the last two are not likely to have been influenced by it, to\r\nthrow off their allegiance to his father. The Aquitanian rebels in\r\n1173 would probably have been more numerous had not the barons of the\r\nLimousin been at that time too busy fighting among themselves to give\r\nmuch heed to disagreements between their rival rulers. The confusion\r\nin those parts was aggravated by a swarm of “Brabantines,” or foreign\r\nmercenaries,[55] probably brought in by Henry at an earlier time,\r\nand now roving about the land and preying on it wholly at their own\r\nwill and pleasure. There was no one to control either Brabantines\r\nor barons, since Richard’s withdrawal and Eleanor’s imprisonment\r\nhad left Aquitaine without any resident governor at all, till in\r\nthe winter Richard went back to put himself single-handed at the\r\nhead of affairs. We hear of him as far south as Bordeaux, where he\r\nwas no doubt sure of a welcome from Archbishop William, and secured\r\nthe support of another great churchman, the abbot of S. Cross, by\r\nconfirming the privileges of the abbey.[56] He tried to win to his\r\ncause the rising town of La Rochelle; but in this he failed; the\r\ntownsfolk shut their gates in his face.[57] He soon, however, had\r\nunder his command a considerable force of knights which [Sidenote:\r\n1174 c. _May 12_] at Whitsuntide 1174 seized the city of Saintes.\r\nHenry was then at Poitiers; at the head of a body of loyal Poitevins\r\nhe marched upon Saintes and drove out the intruders,[58] and\r\nrecovered possession of several other rebel fortresses.[59] The hopes\r\nof young Henry and Louis had broken down both in Aquitaine and in\r\nNormandy. In England they broke down still more completely; and the\r\nfailure of the rebellion there led to the reopening of negotiations\r\nfor peace.\r\n\r\nSome ten or fifteen years later a bitter enemy of Henry II described\r\nthe characters of young Henry and of Richard both at once in the\r\nform of a comparison, or rather contrast, between them.[60] The\r\ncontrast showed itself even in the ill-omened first stage of their\r\npolitical and military careers. Throughout the rebellion of 1173-4\r\nthe young king was a mere tool—and a very inefficient one—in the\r\nhands of Louis. At the instigation of Louis he had entered upon the\r\nwar, and at the dictation of Louis he was ready to accept terms of\r\npeace. Geoffrey was apparently contented with a similar position;\r\nbut not so Richard. Eleanor might have made a tool of her second\r\nson, but no one else could do so. It was not for love of either\r\nyoung Henry or Louis that he had sided with them, and not at their\r\nbehest [Sidenote: 1174 _Sept. 8_] would he give up the struggle. On\r\nhis seventeenth birthday the kings met at Gisors; but “they could\r\nnot come to a settlement because of the absence of Count Richard,\r\nwho at that time was in Poitou, making war on the castles and men of\r\nhis father.” The conference ended in a truce till Michaelmas,[61]\r\non the understanding that meanwhile Henry should subdue Richard by\r\nforce without hindrance from Louis, young Henry, or their adherents.\r\nRichard was not yet hardened enough to contemplate fighting his\r\nfather in person; “when King Henry was come into Poitou, his son\r\nRichard dared not await him, but fled from every place at his\r\napproach, abandoning all the fortresses that he had taken, not daring\r\nto hold them against his father.” When he learned the terms of the\r\ntruce, his indignation at being thus deserted by his supposed allies\r\nmade him suddenly determine on a better course. “He came weeping,\r\nand fell with his face on the ground at the feet of the king his\r\n[Sidenote: _Sept. 23_] father, beseeching his forgiveness.” It was\r\ngranted instantly and completely.[62] Father and son re-entered\r\nPoitiers together.[63] At Henry’s suggestion Richard went in\r\nperson to assure his elder brother and Louis that he was no longer\r\nan obstacle to the conclusion of peace; and on September 30 the\r\npeace was made at Montlouis in Touraine. Henry’s three sons placed\r\nthemselves at his mercy and “returned to him and to his service as\r\ntheir lord.” He promised to each of them a specified provision; and\r\nthey all pledged themselves to accept these provisions as final\r\nand nevermore to require anything further from him save at his own\r\npleasure, nor to withdraw themselves or their service from him.\r\nRichard and Geoffrey also did homage to him “for what he granted and\r\ngave them.” Young Henry would have done likewise, but his father\r\nwould not permit it “because he was a king.”[64] This treaty seems\r\nto have been afterwards put into writing and formally executed at\r\nFalaise, probably on October 11.[65] [Sidenote: 1175] Early in 1175\r\nRichard and Geoffrey did homage to their father again at Le Mans,[66]\r\nand on April 1 their elder brother did the same at Bures.[67]\r\n\r\nThe new provision for Richard did not include his reinstatement as\r\nduke of Aquitaine or count of Poitou. It consisted merely of “two\r\nfitting dwelling-places, whence no damage could come to the king,\r\nin Poitou,” and half the revenues of that county in money.[68] The\r\nstrict letter of the treaty of Montlouis (or of Falaise) in fact\r\nreinstated Henry II as sole ruler of all the Angevin dominions, and\r\nreduced all his sons to the position of dependents on his bounty.\r\nHenry, however, soon showed that he had no intention of enforcing\r\nthis punishment to the uttermost on Richard and Geoffrey. The\r\ntreaty ordained that all lands and castles belonging to the king\r\nand his loyal barons were to be restored to their owners and to the\r\ncondition in which they had been fifteen days before “the king’s\r\nsons departed from him”; so, too, were the lands of the rebels, but\r\nin their case no mention was made of their castles.[69] With these\r\ncastles, therefore, Henry was left free to deal at his pleasure.\r\nAccordingly, when early in 1175 he set himself to carry out this\r\nclause of the treaty in Anjou and Maine, he not only revictualled\r\nand repaired whatever fortresses of his own had suffered damage, and\r\ndestroyed whatever new fortifications had been added to the castles\r\nwhose owners had defied or resisted him, but also ordered that some\r\nof these latter should be razed. Geoffrey was sent to carry out this\r\nprocess in Britanny, and Richard in Aquitaine, while the two Henrys\r\nreturned to England together on May 9.[70]\r\n\r\nBesides the avowed partizans of young Henry in Aquitaine, there\r\nwere others who had seized the opportunity afforded them by the war\r\nto fortify their castles and set the ducal authority at defiance.\r\nThe men of the South for the most part would at any moment gladly\r\nhave flung off that authority altogether, no matter whether it was\r\nwielded by the heiress of the old ducal house, her husband, or her\r\nson. The Aquitanian barons whose castles had in the time of the war\r\nbeen fortified or held against Henry II made it clear that they were\r\nnot disposed to give them up to Richard. He therefore, in pursuance\r\nof his father’s orders, set out “to reduce the said castles to\r\nnothing.” He began after midsummer by marching into the county of\r\nAgen, where Arnald of Bonville had fortified Castillon against him,\r\n“and would not give it up.” This place, “fortified by both nature and\r\nart,” held out against the duke and his engines of war for nearly\r\ntwo months; “at last he took it, and in it thirty knights whom he\r\nkept in his own hands.”[71] We have no certain knowledge of his\r\nfurther movements [Sidenote: 1176] till the following spring, when\r\nhe and Geoffrey of Britanny went to England together. They landed\r\non Good Friday, April 7.[72] Richard’s purpose seems to have been\r\nto seek counsel and help in the difficult task which his father had\r\nassigned to him, for when the Easter festivities were over it was\r\narranged by the elder Henry that the younger one should go with\r\nRichard into Poitou “to subdue his enemies.” Young Henry went to\r\nNormandy on April 20;[73] Richard probably returned about the same\r\ntime, though the brothers did not cross the Channel together.[74]\r\nDuring his absence Vulgrin of Angoulême, a son of the reigning\r\ncount William Taillefer, had “presumed” to march into Poitou at the\r\nhead of a troop of Brabantines. The bishop of Poitiers had at once\r\nresolved, with Theobald Chabot, who was “the leader of Duke Richard’s\r\nsoldiery,” to “deliver the people committed to him out of the hand of\r\ntheir enemies,” and the invaders, although they far outnumbered the\r\nforces of the bishop and the constable, had been completely routed\r\nnear Barbezieux.[75] Richard made straight for Poitou and called\r\nout its feudal levies, “and a great multitude of knights from the\r\nregions round about flocked to him, for the wages that he gave them.”\r\nHe began by punishing some of the rebels in Poitou; next, after\r\nWhitsuntide (May 23), he marched against Vulgrin’s Brabantines and\r\ndefeated them in a pitched battle between St. Maigrin and Bouteville,\r\nnear the western border of the Angoumois. Thence he led his host\r\ninto the Limousin, to punish Count Aimar of Limoges, who also had\r\ntaken advantage of the duke’s absence to commit some breaches of the\r\npeace. First, Richard besieged and took Aimar’s castle of Aixe with\r\nits garrison of forty knights. Then he attacked Limoges, and in a few\r\ndays was master of the city and all its fortifications. All this was\r\nthe work of a month. Shortly after midsummer he returned to Poitiers;\r\nthere he was at last joined by the young king. After taking counsel\r\nwith the Poitevin barons it was decided that the next step should be\r\nthe punishment of Vulgrin of Angoulême. The brothers led their united\r\nforces to Châteauneuf on the Charente, south-west of Angoulême,\r\nand won the place after a fortnight’s siege. Thereupon young Henry\r\n“would stay with his brother no longer, but following evil counsel\r\ndeparted from him.” Richard, thus suddenly deserted, moved cautiously\r\nfurther away from Angoulême to Moulineuf, another castle belonging\r\nto Vulgrin; this he captured in ten days. Then he turned back again\r\nand laid siege to Angoulême itself. Within its walls were not only\r\nVulgrin and his father, Count William, but also Aimar of Limoges and\r\ntwo other rebel leaders, the viscounts of Ventadour and of Chabanais.\r\nIn six days Count William was forced to surrender into Richard’s\r\nhands himself, his city, and all its contents, his castles of\r\nBouteville, Archiac, Montignac, Jarnac, La Chaise, and Merpins, and\r\nto give hostages for his submission to the mercy of Richard and of\r\nKing Henry, to whom Richard immediately sent him and the other nobles\r\nwho had surrendered with him.[76] They presented themselves before\r\nHenry at Winchester on September 21, fell at his feet, and “obtained\r\nmercy from him”; that is to say, he, it seems, sent them back again\r\nwith instructions that they should be temporarily reinstated in their\r\npossessions, pending a fuller consideration which he purposed to give\r\nto their case when he should return to Normandy.[77]\r\n\r\nHaving for the moment reduced northern Aquitaine to subjection,\r\nRichard set himself to a like task in Gascony. After keeping\r\nChristmas at Bordeaux he marched upon Dax, which had been fortified\r\nagainst him by its viscount [Sidenote: _Jan._ 1177] with the help of\r\nthe count of Bigorre. Its recovery by Richard was quickly followed\r\nby that of Bayonne, held against him by its viscount Ernald Bertram.\r\nThence he marched up to the very “Gate of Spain”—St. Pierre de\r\nCize, on the Navarrese border at the foot of the Pyrenees—took the\r\ncastle of St. Pierre in one day, razed it, compelled the Basques and\r\nNavarrese to swear that they would keep the peace, “destroyed the\r\nevil customs which had been introduced at Sorde and Lespéron” (two\r\ntowns in the Landes) “where it was customary to rob pilgrims on their\r\nway to or from S. James,” and by Candlemas was back at Poitiers,\r\nhaving—for the moment—“restored all the provinces to peace.”[78]\r\nThe count of Bigorre in the south and a few barons of Saintonge and\r\nof the Limousin had not yet submitted; Richard, however, made no\r\nfurther movement against any of them for many months. His inaction\r\nmay have been due to instructions from his father, who was probably\r\nunwilling to let him engage in another campaign against these rebels\r\nat a moment when all the available forces of the Angevin house and\r\nthe presence of Richard himself seemed likely to be needed in another\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThe richest baron of Aquitanian Berry, Ralf of Déols, the lord\r\nof Châteauroux, whose lands were said to be worth as much as the\r\nwhole ducal domains of Normandy,[79] had died at the close of 1176\r\nleaving as his sole heir a daughter three years old. The wardship\r\nof this child and of her heritage belonged of right to her suzerain,\r\nthe Duke of Aquitaine; but her relations were resolved to keep, if\r\npossible, both herself and her lands in their own power,[80] so they\r\ncarried her off to La Châtre,[81] and prepared her castles and their\r\n[Sidenote: 1176] own for defence and defiance. When these tidings\r\nreached King Henry in England, he sent urgent orders to his eldest\r\nson to assemble the Norman host without delay and take forcible\r\npossession of the lands of Déols.[82] Henry’s action in this matter\r\nis noticeable as showing that he regarded Richard’s tenure of the\r\ndukedom of Aquitaine at this period as merely nominal or delegated;\r\nhe claimed Denise of Déols as his own vassal, not as Richard’s. It\r\nis, however, not at once apparent why, since he had intrusted to\r\nRichard the task of subduing the other Aquitanian rebels, he did not\r\nleave the affair of Déols to the same hands. The reason may have been\r\nmainly a geographical one. These things [Sidenote: 1176-7] may have\r\ntaken place at a moment when Henry knew Richard to be busily engaged\r\nat the very opposite end of the duchy, at any rate somewhere in\r\nGascony, perhaps at its extreme southern border. The young king, on\r\nthe other hand, was in Normandy, whence it would be easy for him to\r\nlead a force through Maine and Touraine into Berry. On receiving his\r\nfather’s instructions he did so, and laid siege to Châteauroux, which\r\nsurrendered to him at once.[83] He did not, however, gain possession\r\nof the little heiress or of the rest of her lands; for the matter now\r\nbecame complicated by the intervention of the supreme lord of Berry\r\nand of Aquitaine, King Louis.\r\n\r\nFor more than eight years, ever since January 1169, Aloysia of\r\nFrance had been in Henry’s guardianship as the destined bride of\r\nRichard. According to one of the best informed English writers of\r\nthe time, Louis, when this engagement was made, had promised that on\r\nthe marriage of the young couple he would make over to Richard, as\r\nAloysia’s dowry, the city of Bourges with all its appurtenances;[84]\r\nthat is, the portion of Berry the ownership of [Sidenote: =1176-7=]\r\nwhich was in dispute between France and Aquitaine. Ten years\r\nbefore—in the year of Aloysia’s birth—he had promised to King Henry\r\na like cession of the Vexin, the disputed border-land of France and\r\nNormandy, as the dowry of Aloysia’s sister Margaret on her intended\r\nmarriage with Henry’s eldest son, and Henry had taken advantage of\r\nthe ambiguous wording of a clause in the treaty to have the two\r\nchildren—contrary to Louis’s intention—at once formally married in\r\nchurch; whereby he gained immediate possession, not indeed of the\r\nwhole Vexin, but of that portion of it which had once been Norman\r\nand which contained its most valuable fortresses, these being\r\nsurrendered to him by the Templars, who were by the treaty to have\r\nthem in custody till the marriage should take place. That marriage,\r\nnevertheless, had brought more advantage to Louis than to Henry, by\r\nbringing Margaret’s husband, as soon as he reached manhood, under\r\nthe influence of his father-in-law in opposition to his own father.\r\nThere was but too much reason to fear a like result in the case\r\nof Richard; and the dangers of such a result were even greater in\r\nthis case than in the former one, owing to special circumstances\r\nconnected with the betrothal of Richard and Aloysia. That betrothal\r\nwas the price, or part of the price, paid by Henry at Montmirail in\r\n1169 for Louis’s sanction, as overlord, to the scheme devised by\r\nHenry for securing a certain distribution of his dominions among his\r\nsons. Henry’s own renewal of homage to Louis on that occasion for\r\nall his continental territories was a token that he did not intend\r\nto renounce his personal rights over any of his lands, but merely to\r\nsecure for himself the power of sharing those rights with his sons\r\nwhenever he might choose to do so, and for the boys an unquestionable\r\nright of succession at his death to their respective shares of the\r\nAngevin heritage. But, somewhat like Louis nine years before, Henry\r\nmade a mistake which rendered it possible for his adversary to put\r\nanother construction upon the matter. He secured young Henry’s claims\r\nto the future possession of the heritage of Geoffrey of Anjou and\r\nMaud of Normandy, and Richard’s claim to the heritage of Eleanor, by\r\nmaking them do homage to Louis for Anjou and Aquitaine [Sidenote:\r\n=1176-7=] respectively; but he omitted to secure the subordination of\r\ntheir claims to his own during his lifetime by making them do homage\r\nto himself. Owing to this omission, it was open to Louis to assert,\r\nif he chose, that the Angevin counties and the Norman duchy legally\r\nbelonged to young Henry and the duchy of Aquitaine to Richard, in\r\nvirtue of the homage rendered by them for those lands direct to\r\nhimself as overlord; Henry II—so he might argue—having by his consent\r\nto that homage tacitly renounced all claim to the lands for which it\r\nwas rendered, and being thenceforth merely in temporary charge of\r\nthem as guardian of the boys. The promise of the cession of Bourges\r\nwas a very small price to pay for a weapon so tremendous as that\r\nwhich Henry had thus, it seems, unconsciously placed in the hands of\r\nan enemy whose mean jealousy and unscrupulous astuteness he appears\r\nnever to have fully realized. He unintentionally made this possible\r\nconstruction of the treaty of Montmirail still more plausible through\r\nthe crowning of his eldest son in 1170 and the solemn installation of\r\nthe second as duke of Aquitaine in 1172. Louis acted upon it in 1173,\r\nalthough he does not seem ever to have put it into formal words; and\r\nhis action, coupled with that of the ungrateful sons urged on by\r\ntheir mother, must have opened Henry’s eyes to the peril in which he\r\nhad involved himself through his misplaced confidence in the loyalty\r\nboth of his overlord and of his own family. It showed that as soon as\r\nRichard and Aloysia were married, Louis might and in all probability\r\nwould demand the recognition of his new son-in-law as sole ruler of\r\nAquitaine, independent of any superior save Louis himself.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1175 or early in 1176 Louis, it seems, reminded Henry\r\nthat, Richard being now in his nineteenth [Sidenote: 1175-6] year\r\nand Aloysia in her sixteenth, it was full time for the contract of\r\nmarriage between them to be carried into effect; but the answer which\r\nhe received was so unsatisfactory that he referred the matter to the\r\nPope. We have no actual record of any communication between the kings\r\non the subject at this time, but something of the kind must have\r\n[Sidenote: 1176] taken place to cause the Pope’s action. In May 1176\r\nAlexander bade Cardinal Peter, then legate in France, lay the whole\r\nof Henry’s lands on both sides of the sea under Interdict “unless\r\nhe (Henry) would permit Richard and Aloysia to be married without\r\ndelay.”[85] The legate, however, seems to have done nothing in the\r\nmatter for more than a year. Probably the two kings were negotiating;\r\n[Sidenote: 1177] but we hear nothing of their negotiations till June\r\n1177, when Henry sent an embassy to France to “convene” Louis about\r\nthe dowries which he had promised to give with his two daughters to\r\nthe young king and to Richard—to wit, the Vexin (that is, its eastern\r\nor “French” part, which was still in Louis’s hands) and the viscounty\r\nof Bourges.[86] It seems that Henry, having found Margaret’s marriage\r\nfail to give him the control over her promised lands, demanded to\r\nbe put in possession of those of Aloysia before he would allow her\r\nto marry Richard. But meanwhile the Pope had in May renewed the\r\ninjunctions which he had issued to Cardinal Peter eleven months\r\nbefore; and on July 12 the English envoys returned with the news that\r\nPeter was instructed to lay the whole of their sovereign’s dominions,\r\ninsular and continental, under Interdict, unless Richard were at\r\nonce permitted to take for his wife the maiden whom Henry “had so\r\nlong already, and longer than had been agreed, had in his custody\r\nfor the said Richard.”[87] Henry at once made the English bishops\r\nappeal to the Pope. Illness detained him in England for nearly five\r\nweeks;[88] then he went to Normandy (August 18), and on September 21\r\nmet Louis and the legate at Nonancourt.[89] In the legate’s presence\r\nhe promised that Richard should wed Aloysia, if Louis gave Bourges\r\nto Richard and the Vexin to the young king as previously agreed.[90]\r\nWhether the wedding or the cession was to take place first, however,\r\nseems to have been left an open question; and four days later the\r\nwhole matter was again postponed indefinitely by a treaty whereby\r\nthe two elder kings pledged themselves to take the Cross and go\r\nto the Holy Land together, and meanwhile, as brother Crusaders, to\r\nlay aside all mutual strife and make no claims or demands upon each\r\nother’s possessions as they held them at that moment, except with\r\nregard to Auvergne and to any encroachments which the men of either\r\nparty might have made upon those of the other in the territory of\r\nChâteauroux or of the lesser fiefs on the border of their respective\r\nlands in Berry. If on these excepted matters they could not agree\r\nbetween themselves, twelve arbitrators were to decide according to\r\nthe sworn evidence of the men of the lands in question.[91]\r\n\r\nAll immediate danger of interference from either Louis or the\r\nLegate being thus removed, Henry summoned the Norman host to meet\r\nat Argentan on October 9 for an expedition against the rebels in\r\nBerry.[92] Young Henry and Richard had, by his desire, joined him on\r\nhis arrival in Normandy;[93] the former was now despatched in advance\r\ninto Berry, and when the king’s host reached the Norman border at\r\nAlençon Richard was detached from it and once more sent into Poitou\r\n“to subdue the enemies” there, while the king himself marched upon\r\nChâteauroux. After receiving its formal surrender he proceeded to La\r\nChâtre; this place, and the little Lady of Déols, were also given up\r\nto him at once. Thence he proceeded into the Limousin and called upon\r\nthose of its nobles and knights who had taken part in the rebellion\r\nof 1173 to give an account of their conduct; one of the most\r\nimportant of them, the viscount of Turenne, surrendered his chief\r\ncastle, “strongly fortified by both art and nature”; with the others\r\nHenry dealt “according as each of them deserved.”[94] He then hurried\r\nback to Graçay in Berry, to meet Louis and the commissioners who were\r\nto report to the two kings the result of their investigations about\r\nAuvergne. What that result was we are nowhere directly told; we only\r\nhear that both the rivals declared themselves content to abide by\r\nit.[95] The next reference to the overlordship of Auvergne, however,\r\nsome twelve years later, seems to indicate that the commissioners\r\ngave their award in favour of the duke of Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nAnother of Henry’s vassals in Berry, Odo of Issoudun, had lately\r\ndied leaving an infant heir, and this child had been stolen by his\r\nkinsman the duke of Burgundy. The custody of his fief was offered to\r\nthe king by the barons who had it in their keeping, but he refused\r\nto receive it without the child,[96] whom he made no attempt to\r\nreclaim. It was not worth while to risk an embroilment with Burgundy\r\nabout a petty lordship in Berry at the moment when an opportunity\r\nwas just presenting itself for annexing to the Poitevin domains a\r\nvaluable fief of the duchy of Aquitaine, the county of La Marche,\r\nwhich lay between Berry and the Limousin. Count Adalbert V of La\r\nMarche had separated from his wife, lost his only son, and seemingly\r\ndisinherited his only daughter with her own consent;[97] the kinship\r\nbetween him and his only other surviving relatives was so remote that\r\nhe deemed himself free to dispose of his county without regard to\r\nthem; and he now offered to sell it to its overlord, King Henry, for\r\na sum of money wherewith he himself might go to end his lonely days\r\nin the Holy Land. In December Henry went to meet him at Grandmont;\r\nthe bargain was quickly struck, the conveyance executed, and the\r\npurchase money—less than a third of what Henry is said to have\r\nestimated the county as worth—paid down, and the barons and knights\r\nof La Marche did homage to Henry as their immediate liege lord.[98]\r\n\r\nIn all these proceedings of Henry in Aquitaine there is no reference\r\nto Richard. They clearly indicate that the elder holder of the ducal\r\ntitle still claimed the ducal power and authority as his own, not\r\nhis son’s. He seems, however, to have left to Richard the punishment\r\nof one important Limousin rebel whose case he had a year before\r\nexpressly reserved for his own judgement; for it was Richard who now\r\n“took away the castle”—that is, the fortified town—“at Limoges where\r\nS. Martial rests in his minster” from the viscount; “and it served\r\nthe viscount right,” adds a Norman chronicler, “for helping the count\r\nof Angoulême against the duke.”[99] This seems to have been about the\r\ntime when Henry was in Aquitaine, and it is the only act of Richard’s\r\nmentioned by any chronicler between Henry’s arrival in Normandy in\r\nAugust 1177 and his return to England in July 1178.[100] We may\r\ninfer, almost with certainty, that it was done by Henry’s order; and,\r\nwith considerable probability, that the unusual state of quiescence\r\nin which Richard seems to have passed these eleven months was due in\r\npart at least to the restraint placed on him by Henry’s presence on\r\nthe continent. So long as Richard remained in the dependent position\r\nto which he had been reduced by the agreement at Montlouis, it would\r\nbe impossible for him to take any considerable military or political\r\naction, unless by his father’s order, while his father was within\r\nreach. [Sidenote: 1178] But in the autumn of 1178, when Henry was\r\nonce more in England, Richard’s activity re-commenced. “With a great\r\nhost” he again proceeded into Gascony[101] as far as Dax. There, to\r\nhis delight, he found that the count of Bigorre, who two winters\r\nbefore had helped the viscount of Dax to hold the city against the\r\nduke, had somehow incurred the displeasure of the citizens and was\r\nfast in their prison. They seem to have handed him over to Richard;\r\n“but [Sidenote: 1177] King Alfonso of Aragon, grieving that his\r\nfriend the count of Bigorre was held in chains, came to the said\r\nduke, and entreating that his friend might be liberated, stood surety\r\nfor him that he would do the will of the duke and of his father the\r\nking of England; and the count of Bigorre, that he might be set free,\r\ngave up to the duke Clermont and the castle of Montbron.” Richard\r\nthen went northward again, and after keeping Christmas at Saintes\r\ngathered another “great host” for the subjugation of Saintonge and\r\nthe Angoumois.[102] These two districts had been for years, and\r\nindeed for generations, a seed-plot of rebellion. Richard seems to\r\nhave been bent upon reducing them to order once [Sidenote: 1178] for\r\nall. The moving spirits of defiance there were Vulgrin of Angoulême\r\nand Geoffrey of Rancogne. Count William of Angoulême, after being\r\nreinstated by Henry in his capital city, seems to have made over the\r\ngovernment of his county to his eldest son, Vulgrin, who had headed\r\nthe resistance to Richard in 1176. Geoffrey of Rancogne took his name\r\nfrom a place in the same county, and was also owner of two lordships\r\nof far greater importance in Saintonge, one of which, Pons, lay close\r\nto the border of the Angoumois, and the other, Taillebourg, was a\r\nfortress of great strength, about half way between Saintes and St.\r\nJean d’Angély. It was to Pons that Richard now laid siege. After\r\nsome weeks, finding that he made no progress, he left his constables\r\n[Sidenote: 1179] there with a part of his forces, and led the rest,\r\nin Easter week (April 1-8), into the Angoumois. A three days’ siege\r\nwon the castle of Richemont; four other castles—Genzac, Marcillac,\r\nGourville, Auville—were taken in the last fortnight of April and\r\nlevelled with the ground. Then he turned westward again, re-crossed\r\nthe border, and marched upon Taillebourg.[103]\r\n\r\nBy Richard’s contemporaries the siege of Taillebourg was looked upon\r\nas “a most desperate enterprize, which none of his predecessors had\r\never ventured to attempt. Never before had a hostile force so much\r\nas looked upon the castle.” It seems indeed to have been not merely\r\na castle but a strongly fortified, though small, town, the castle\r\nproper—perched on the summit of a rock of which three sides were\r\ninaccessible by nature and the fourth was defended by art—forming\r\nthe citadel. “Girt with a triple ditch; defying from behind a triple\r\nwall every external authority; amply secured with weapons, bolts,\r\nand bars; crowned with towers placed at regular intervals; furnished\r\nwith a handy stone laid ready for casting from every loop-hole;\r\nwell stocked with victuals; filled with a thousand men ready for\r\nfight,” this virgin fortress “was in no wise affrighted” at the\r\nduke’s approach. Richard, however, had made up his mind to “subdue\r\nthe pride of Geoffrey of Rancogne once for all.” He had collected\r\nauxiliaries from every quarter; and he set them all to work as soon\r\nas the host reached Geoffrey’s border. “He carried off the wealth of\r\nthe farms; he cut down the vines; he fired the villages; whatever was\r\nleft he pulled down and laid waste; and then he pitched his tents\r\non the outskirts of the castle close to the walls, to the great\r\nalarm of the townsfolk, who had expected nothing of the kind.” At\r\nthe end of a week (May 1-8), “deeming it a disgrace that so many\r\nhigh-spirited and well-proved knights should tamely submit to be\r\nshut up within the walls, they agreed to sally forth and fall upon\r\nthe duke’s host at unawares. But the duke bade his men fly to arms,\r\nand forced the townsmen to retire. The mettle of horses, the worth\r\nof spears, swords, helmets, bows, arbalests, shields, mailcoats,\r\nstakes, clubs, were all put to proof in the stubborn fight that raged\r\nat the gates, till the townsmen could no longer withstand the fierce\r\nonslaught of the duke’s van headed by the duke himself. As they\r\nretired helter-skelter within the walls, he by a sudden dash made\r\nhis way with them into the town. The citadel now became their only\r\nrefuge from their assailants, who rushed about the streets plundering\r\nand burning at their will.” Two days later—on Ascension Day, May\r\n10—the castle was surrendered, seemingly by Geoffrey in person; and\r\nin a few days more the whole of its walls were levelled with the\r\nground.[104]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Taillebourg was Richard’s first great military\r\nexploit. It laid the foundation of his military fame, not so much by\r\nthe intrinsic importance of the exploit itself as by the revelation,\r\nin the campaign of which it was at once the turning-point and the\r\ncrown, of the character and capability of the young duke. Its\r\nimmediate result was the complete submission of the rebels against\r\nwhom that campaign was directed. Not only did Geoffrey of Rancogne\r\nsurrender Pons,[105] but Vulgrin of Angoulême, before the end of the\r\nmonth, gave up his capital city and his castle of Montignac; and\r\nwhen Richard, after razing the walls of all these places, sailed for\r\nEngland, he left in Aquitaine, for the moment at least, “all things\r\nsettled according to his will.”[106] He seems to have visited the\r\ntomb of S. Thomas the Martyr at Canterbury[107] before joining his\r\nfather. Henry received him “with great honour”[108] and gave him his\r\nreward; when the young conqueror returned to Aquitaine shortly before\r\nMichaelmas, he returned not merely as his father’s lieutenant, but as\r\nonce again, with his father’s sanction, count of Poitou.[109]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFATHER AND SONS\r\n\r\n1179-1183\r\n\r\n  Domus divisa contra se.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are not told on what conditions, if any, the restitution of Poitou\r\nwas made to Richard by his father. The matter might become important\r\nwhenever Henry should again cross the sea; but so long as the king\r\nremained in England it would have scarcely any practical effect on\r\nRichard’s position in Aquitaine. Whether he commanded the feudal\r\nhost and disposed of the feudal revenues of Poitou as count or as\r\nhis father’s delegate, he was, in his father’s absence, equally\r\nmaster of both; and in Aquitaine at large the temporary degradation\r\ninflicted on him by Henry seems never to have been recognized at\r\nall. He himself had never laid aside the style and title of duke of\r\nAquitaine, nor the princely state belonging to that dignity, nor had\r\nhe hesitated to deal with the demesne lands of Poitou as his own\r\nabsolute property. In his own eyes he was count and duke by virtue\r\nnot of any grant from either Henry or Louis, but of his descent from\r\nthe old ducal line and of the investiture which he had received at\r\nPoitiers and at Limoges from the clergy and people of the duchy. His\r\nsubjects regarded him in the same light. They fought and intrigued\r\nagainst him not as an intruder or a usurper, nor as the lieutenant of\r\none whom they counted as such, but precisely because he was to them\r\nthe incarnation of the ducal authority in a form which was specially\r\nobnoxious to their habits of turbulent independence and lawless\r\nself-will. For seven years they had been watching with growing\r\nuneasiness and dismay the development of the “new duke,” whom as a\r\nboy of fourteen they had acclaimed at Limoges in 1172, into a man\r\nof very different character from the dukes of the last two or three\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nNone of the pictures of Richard’s outer or inner man which have\r\ncome down to us date from a time quite so early as the year 1179;\r\nbut the main features of his personality, outward and inward, were\r\nalready marked enough to show us in those pictures a true likeness\r\nof the young conqueror of Taillebourg. In the sculptured effigies of\r\nRichard at Fontevraud and at Rouen the outlines of the face give so\r\nlittle indication of age as to suggest that in the living model they\r\nmay have been—except for the beard and moustache—almost the same at\r\nforty-one as at twenty-one; the features are well proportioned and\r\nfinely formed. In life they were crowned with a profusion of hair\r\n“of a colour midway between red and yellow”—in other words, of the\r\nrare golden or still rarer auburn hue. The young duke’s stature was\r\nlofty,[110] above the average height,[111] his frame shapely and well\r\nproportioned, with long, straight, flexible limbs; “no arm was better\r\nadapted than his for drawing sword, nor more powerful to strike with\r\nit.”[112] His whole person had such an aspect of dignity that two\r\nindependent observers, at different times, described it in the same\r\nwords—“a form worthy to occupy a place of high command”;[113] and\r\nthe seemliness of his appearance was enhanced by that of his manners\r\nand dress.[114] The stories of his gigantic strength all relate to\r\nthe time of the Crusade, when that strength was in its maturity; but\r\na man of whom such tales were told must have been a born athlete.\r\nOn the other hand, it was certainly before his Aquitanian days were\r\nover that he contracted the quartan ague which, says Gerald of Wales,\r\n“was given him to repress the over fierce workings of his mind, but\r\nby which he, like the lion, yea, more than lion that he was,[115]\r\nseemed rather to be influenced as by a goad; for while thus almost\r\ncontinually trembling, he remained intrepid in his determination to\r\nmake the whole world tremble and fear before him.”[116]\r\n\r\nIn this sentence of Gerald’s we have perhaps the earliest\r\nforeshadowing of the epithet which was to become attached exclusively\r\nto Richard’s name. The king of beasts has in all ages been a common\r\nsimile for a king of men, whether the kingship be material or\r\nmetaphorical.[117] But Gerald’s words seem, from their context, meant\r\nto carry a special significance which is more distinctly implied\r\nin the special form of Richard’s traditional surname. Richard is\r\nnot the only hero whom poets and romancers, in the golden age of\r\nold French poetry and romance, credited with the possession of “a\r\nlion’s heart,”[118] but he is the only one who became known to the\r\nworld for all time as pre-eminently and absolutely “The Lion-Heart.”\r\nWe cannot tell precisely when the epithet came into general use;\r\none writer used it within eight years after Richard’s death.[119]\r\nIt had evidently fixed itself in popular tradition before a less\r\nhigh-souled generation of romancers sought to explain a surname,\r\nwhose true meaning they were too far removed from the old epic spirit\r\nto appreciate or understand, by devising an origin for it in an\r\nimpossible tale of their own clumsy invention.[120] Its true origin\r\nneed be sought no further than the character of him who bore it.\r\n\r\n“Among the virtues in which he excels, three especially distinguish\r\nhim beyond compare: supereminent valour and daring;[121] unbounded\r\nliberality and bountifulness; stedfast constancy in holding to his\r\npurpose and to his word”—thus Gerald of Wales wrote of Richard some\r\neight or nine years after the campaign of Taillebourg.[122] The young\r\nduke’s energy and daring had been proved before that expedition; and\r\nhis lavish readiness to reward those who served him had contributed\r\nin no small degree to his military successes, by means of the crowd\r\nof highly trained soldiers whom it attracted to his standard. What\r\nmedieval writers call “constancy” was one of the qualities most\r\nuniversally admired in the medieval world. Richard’s “constancy” had,\r\nas yet, shown itself chiefly in a form which compelled the admiration\r\nand respect of all his Aquitanian subjects, but was not likely to\r\nwin him the love of the Aquitanian baronage. From the hour when his\r\nfather laid on him, a lad of scarce sixteen years and a half, the\r\ntask of restoring the ducal authority in Aquitaine, his aim was\r\nto rule and govern what Gerald truly calls “that hitherto untamed\r\ncountry” in such wise “that not only might he establish within its\r\nborders a far more complete and unbroken peace than was wont to\r\nreign there, but also, recovering what in time past had been lopped\r\noff and separated from it, restore all things to their pristine\r\ncondition.”[123] The barons of the duchy were for the most part far\r\nfrom regarding “peace within its borders” as a thing to be desired;\r\nand Richard’s ideal of a well-ordered state, while thus differing\r\nfrom theirs, was not made more attractive in their eyes by the\r\nmethods which he employed to realize it. Unlike his elder brother,\r\nhe did not court popularity; he was indeed absolutely indifferent to\r\nit, if not contemptuous of it. “Strictness and firmness, gravity and\r\nconstancy,” were the characteristics in him which men contrasted with\r\nthe young king’s easy good-nature, indulgent temper, and pleasantness\r\ntowards all who approached him. Richard’s generosity and graciousness\r\nwere of a higher type than young Henry’s; they were displayed only\r\nwhere they were deserved.[124] With him everything was earnest.\r\nEven martial sports had no charm for a lad who, while other young\r\nknights of his day—his brothers among them—were acquiring the use of\r\narms in an endless round of tournaments, was serving his military\r\napprenticeship in real warfare; a warfare which he waged with\r\ntireless persistence and relentless severity for nearly ten years,\r\n“that he might quell the insubordination of an unruly people, and\r\nmake innocence secure amid evildoers.”[125]\r\n\r\nHis zeal for public order and justice, his ruthless application of\r\nthe utmost rigor of law to those who in his eyes deserved punishment,\r\nnaturally provoked the hatred of his opponents, and laid him open\r\nto the charge of cruelty.[126] No instances, however, are recorded;\r\nthe Aquitanian chroniclers say nothing on the subject, and there is\r\nno real ground for supposing that his sternness towards the barons\r\nwho withstood his will was other than what Gerald represents it to\r\nhave been—part of a wholesome and necessary discipline.[127] In 1183\r\nthey are said to have accused him of crimes of another kind;[128]\r\nbut this accusation rests only upon an English writer’s report of\r\nthe pleas by which they sought to justify their own treason. That\r\nsome at least of the worst details of the charge were a product of\r\nthat “recklessness of tongue” for which the men of the south were\r\nnotorious, may with much probability be inferred from the silence of\r\nthe Aquitanian chroniclers on this point also. The only comment made\r\nby a contemporary local writer on Richard’s character and conduct\r\nduring these early years of storm and stress is a tribute of praise\r\neven more impressive, considering the period and the circumstances\r\nin which it was written, than the panegyrics that were lavished from\r\nall quarters upon his later achievements. Geoffrey of Breuil seems\r\nto have been a member of a junior branch of the knightly family of\r\nBreuil in Poitou; his father’s house was at Ste. Marie de Clairmont,\r\nnear Excideuil in Périgord. He made his profession as a monk at S.\r\nMartial’s abbey at Limoges in 1160, was ordained priest in 1167,\r\nand ten years later was made Prior of Vigeois in the Limousin. His\r\nsketch of Aquitanian history ends abruptly at the year 1185. In that\r\nyear he, as he says, decided to insert in his work “the names of the\r\nkings who are ruling the world in this our age.” After mentioning by\r\nname Prester John, the two Emperors, the kings of Jerusalem, France,\r\nEngland, Scotland, Denmark, Sicily, Morocco, Spain, and Hungary, he\r\ncontinues: “In the list of the kings let there be written down the\r\nduke of Aquitaine and Gascony, Richard, who has never been slack\r\nin deeds of prowess, and whose youth is distinguished by great\r\nstrenuousness of life.”[129]\r\n\r\nA cessation of war between duke and barons in Aquitaine was usually\r\nfollowed by trouble with the mercenary troops who were always\r\nemployed by one party or the other, sometimes by both parties,\r\nand who when such employment was lacking fell to raiding on their\r\nown account. This occurred in the summer of 1179 during Richard’s\r\nabsence in England after the fall of Taillebourg. Bordeaux was\r\nravaged and burnt by some “Basques, Navarrese, or Brabantines,”\r\nevidently soldiers of this class.[130] With the barons Richard seems\r\nto have had no particular trouble for the next two years or more.\r\nOn July 7, 1179, old Count William of Angoulême and his stepson\r\nAimar of Limoges, “with many others,” set out on a pilgrimage to\r\nJerusalem.[131] William died a month later at Messina; Vulgrin, who\r\nhad surrendered the city to Richard, thus became head of the family,\r\nbut the dignity and authority of count of Angoulême seems to have\r\nbeen shared between him and his brothers.[132]\r\n\r\nThe recent humiliation of Vulgrin and the absence of Aimar of Limoges\r\nand his fellow pilgrims may help to account for the fact that the\r\nyear 1180 is almost a blank in the chronicles of Aquitaine. King\r\nHenry’s presence in Normandy from April 1180 to July 1181 may also\r\nhave had a pacific effect throughout all his continental dominions.\r\nIt is, moreover, probable that some of the pilgrims had come\r\n[Sidenote: 1180] to an agreement with Richard before they started; it\r\nseems almost certain that Aimar had done so, for when he returned,\r\nin December 1180, he was solemnly welcomed at Limoges on Christmas\r\nDay[133] in a manner which implies that he had been reinstated in\r\nhis former position of authority there, and we hear of no further\r\nhostilities between him and Richard for more than six months.[134]\r\nWe hear indeed of no [Sidenote: 1181] further military movements in\r\nAquitaine till after King Henry’s return to England at the end of\r\nJuly 1181. Then Richard marched into Gascony and took possession\r\nof Lectoure, the chief town of the viscounty of Lomagne. He was\r\nseemingly on his way thence to Dax when Vézian of Lomagne, in the\r\nmiddle of August, came and submitted himself to him at S. Sever.\r\nVézian was probably a very young man, for he was not yet a knight.\r\nHis submission was not only accepted as frankly as it was offered,\r\nbut it was rewarded by the bestowal of knighthood from Richard’s\r\nhand.[135] In November Richard joined his brothers in punishing the\r\ncount of Sancerre for his rebellion against the young King Philip of\r\nFrance, whom Henry had charged his sons to protect and support during\r\nhis own absence over-sea.[136]\r\n\r\nIt was probably in the interval between these two expeditions, to\r\nGascony and to Sancerre, that a new strife arose in the Angoumois.\r\nCount Vulgrin Taillefer III had died on June 29[137] leaving an only\r\nchild, a girl “who,” says Geoffrey of Vigeois, “was the cause of\r\ngreat calamity to her country.” Richard, as duke, took her into his\r\nwardship as heiress of Angoulême and claimed also the wardship of\r\nher land;[138] but her uncles, William and Aimar, tried to seize\r\ntheir dead brother’s heritage. Richard drove them out of Angoulême,\r\nwhereupon they found a refuge at Limoges with their half-brother,\r\nviscount Aimar.[139] It was plain that Richard would soon be involved\r\nin a new war with them and with Aimar of Limoges; and meanwhile other\r\ninfluences were tending to develope that war into a general one. The\r\ncomparative peace of the last eighteen months was almost ominous;\r\nit certainly did not imply contentment on the part of the barons of\r\nAquitaine. They were all this while writhing under the iron rule of\r\ntheir young duke; many of them were plotting schemes for “doing their\r\nutmost to drive him out of the duchy of Aquitaine and the county\r\nof Poitou altogether.”[140] Strangely enough, the impulse which at\r\nlength brought their plottings to a head seems to have sprung from a\r\nprivate quarrel between two brothers who did not rank among the great\r\nvassals of the duchy.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Hautefort, on the border of the Limousin and Périgord,\r\nwas the joint patrimony of Constantine and Bertrand de Born. They\r\nlived in it together, but in continual discord, till Constantine\r\ndrove Bertrand out, seemingly in the latter part of 1181 or early\r\nin 1182. Bertrand, however, soon made his way back, and expelled\r\nConstantine in his turn. Constantine appealed for help to their\r\nimmediate feudal superior, the viscount of Limoges,[141] and also,\r\nit seems, to the duke. Both took up his cause; but at the moment\r\nthey were at enmity with each other—probably about the Angoulême\r\nsuccession—so “Richard made war against Aimar, and Richard and\r\nAimar made war against Bertrand and ravaged and burned his land.”\r\nConstantine was “a good knight as regards fighting”;[142] Bertrand\r\nwas something more—“a good knight, and a good fighter, and a good\r\nsquire of dames, and a good troubadour, and wise and well-spoken,\r\nknowing how to deal with bad and good—and all his time he was at war\r\nwith all his neighbours.”[143] The condition of things described\r\nin these last words was to Bertrand an ideal condition: “I would\r\nthat the great men should be always quarrelling among themselves,”\r\nhe said.[144] It was the ideal of a typical Aquitanian baron; and\r\nthat ideal had become much less easy of realization now that the\r\nyoung duke was master of the land than it had been while the ducal\r\ninterests were represented only by a woman or left in charge of mere\r\nseneschals. Bertrand seems to have conceived a project of so working\r\non the minds of the other malcontents as to band them together with\r\nhimself in a conspiracy whose primary and ostensible object was to be\r\nthe overthrow of the duke, but which by uniting all its members in\r\na sworn alliance with each other and therefore with its originator,\r\nBertrand, should enable him to maintain his position as master of\r\nHautefort. If Aimar of Limoges could be bound to Bertrand in a sworn\r\nleague against Richard, Bertrand would be at once rid of one of his\r\npresent antagonists, and another and a greater one would—so at least\r\nthe allies might hope—soon have [Sidenote: 1181-2] his hands too full\r\nof other work to trouble himself further about Hautefort.[145]\r\n\r\nAimar and his three half-brothers,[146] being already banded together\r\nagainst the duke for the preservation of Angoulême to the male line\r\nof Taillefer, were naturally quite ready to [Sidenote: =1181-2=]\r\nembrace Bertrand’s project—if indeed the project had originated\r\nwith Bertrand. It seems to have first taken shape in a meeting at\r\nLimoges: “in an ancient minster of S. Martial,” says Bertrand, “many\r\nrich men swore to me on a missal.”[147] They seem to have sworn\r\nthat no individual among them should make terms with Richard for\r\nhimself independently of his allies.[148] Among the earliest members\r\nof the league thus formed were, besides the brothers of Angoulême\r\nand their half-brother of Limoges, the three other viscounts of the\r\nLimousin—Ventadour, Comborn, and Turenne—the count of Périgord, and\r\nWilliam of Gourdon in Quercy.[149] To these were soon added “other\r\nbarons of Périgord and of the Limousin and Quercy whom Richard was\r\ndisinheriting.”[150] In one of his most vigorous sirventes Bertrand\r\nmade a stirring appeal to the great nobles of Gascony, Gaston of\r\nBéarn, Vézian of Lomagne, Bernard of Armagnac, Peter of Dax, Centol\r\nof Bigorre: “if they will it, the count [of Poitou] will have enough\r\nto do in those parts; and then, since he is so valiant, let him\r\ncome with his great host this way and measure himself with us!” The\r\neffect of Richard’s repressive measures in Saintonge and in Poitou\r\nare indirectly acknowledged in the poet’s next words: “If Taillebourg\r\nand Pons and Lusignan and Mauléon and Tonnay were fit for action,\r\nand if there were a stirring and stalwart viscount at Sivray, I\r\nwill never believe that they would not help us. He of Thouars,\r\ntoo, whom the count has threatened, should join us if he be not a\r\ndastard.”[151] Of Richard’s relations at this period with Aimeric of\r\nThouars, Ralf of Mauléon, and the lords of Tonnay and Sivray, we know\r\nnothing. The head of the house of Lusignan was that same Geoffrey\r\nwho had been a prominent leader in the Poitevin rising of 1167, and\r\nhad also [Sidenote: =1181-2=] joined in the revolt of 1173. Since\r\nthen a new cause of strife had arisen between him and the Angevin\r\nrulers of Aquitaine. At the time when Adalbert of La Marche sold his\r\ncounty, according to his own statement, there was “no one protesting\r\nand indeed no one existing who had a right to protest” against the\r\nsale.[152] But on the actual annexation of La Marche to the ducal\r\ndomain Geoffrey of Lusignan “with his brothers”—he had five—did more\r\nthan protest; he “resisted, saying that La Marche belonged to him\r\nas heir—and,” adds Geoffrey of Vigeois, “he got it.”[153] How and\r\nwhen he got it we do not know, but it was probably not earlier than\r\nthe autumn of 1182, since Bertrand de Born shortly before that time\r\nevidently did not regard the Lusignans as being in a position to\r\nafford much practical help to the league, and in June of that year\r\nHenry was still sufficiently master of the county to make a peaceful\r\nvisit to Grandmont for the third time within sixteen months.[154]\r\nObviously, however, the league would have the sympathies of the\r\nclaimant of La Marche and his brothers. It seems to have also had\r\nthose of some at least of the towns; “the burghers are shutting\r\nthemselves in all round”—that is, rebuilding or strengthening their\r\ntown walls—said Bertrand.[155]\r\n\r\nConcerted action was, however, so difficult to men accustomed by\r\nlifelong habit to fighting each for his own hand that before the\r\nallies were ready for a simultaneous rising their project seems to\r\nhave become known to the duke. On Sunday, April 11, 1182, he “with a\r\nfew of his people manfully captured” the Puy-St.-Front, a stronghold\r\nwhich stood in much the same relation to the city of Périgueux as\r\nthat of the “castle of S. Martial” to the city of Limoges. The\r\ncapture was evidently a surprise, characteristically planned and\r\nexecuted by Richard on the spur of the moment [Sidenote: 1182] when\r\nhe discovered that Elias of Périgord, with whom he does not seem to\r\nhave had any previous trouble, “was favouring his enemies.” He then\r\nmarched upon Excideuil and ravaged the Limousin border from that\r\nfortress to Corgnac. By the middle of May the rebel leaders were\r\napparently so disheartened that they were ready to discuss terms\r\nof peace, not indeed with Richard, but with his father. Soon after\r\nWhitsuntide (May 16) the counts of Angoulême and Périgord and the\r\nviscount of Limoges met the king at Grandmont, but no agreement was\r\nreached. Henry then went to support Richard in the Limousin. Richard\r\nsuddenly attacked Excideuil, and took the town, though not the\r\ncastle; Henry went to St. Yrieix, placed a garrison there, and then\r\nlaid siege to Pierre-Buffière, which surrendered after twelve days.\r\nAt midsummer he was back at Grandmont. Richard meanwhile had gone\r\nfrom Excideuil back to Périgueux. It seems that in his absence Elias\r\nhad recovered Puy-St.-Front, and this time it was well prepared for\r\ndefence. Richard “girded it all round about with a very great host”;\r\nin a few days he was rejoined by his father, and at the end of the\r\nmonth by his elder brother. The result was that in the first week of\r\nJuly both Elias of Périgord and Aimar of Limoges submitted. The peace\r\nwas sworn in S. Augustine’s abbey at Limoges; Aimar promised that\r\nhis half-brothers should have no further help from him, and placed\r\ntwo of his sons in Richard’s hands as hostages; Elias surrendered\r\nPérigueux to the young duke, who thereupon made peace with him,\r\nbut took the precaution of destroying all the towers of the city\r\nwall.[156] [Sidenote: 1181] Twelve months earlier, he had ordered\r\na more complete destruction of the defences of Limoges. There, the\r\nwalls of the castle of S. Martial, which Henry had ordered to be\r\nrazed thirty years before, had been hurriedly rebuilt by the burghers\r\nduring the war of 1174, “lest when peace was restored the duke should\r\nforbid it.”[157] The duke seems to have let them alone for seven\r\nyears; it may have been [Sidenote: 1181-2] some recent addition to\r\nthe fortifications which made him issue at midsummer 1181 an order\r\nthat they should again be pulled down; and the burghers dared not\r\ndisobey him.[158]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =1181-2=]\r\n\r\nThe league seemed to have failed; but its ultimate failure was by\r\nno means assured yet. Two at least of its members were by this\r\ntime contemplating, if indeed they had not already taken, steps to\r\nwin support for it outside the duchy. Aimar Taillefer offered his\r\nhomage for Angoulême to the lord paramount, King Philip of France;\r\nPhilip accepted the homage, and thus pledged himself to uphold\r\nAimar in his struggle for the county against Richard, who was still\r\ndetermined to reclaim it for its late count’s daughter, [Sidenote:\r\n1182] Maud.[159] There was another young king in whom, although his\r\nkingship was merely nominal, Bertrand saw a yet more desirable tool\r\nfor the purposes of the league. Before young Henry joined his father\r\nand brother at the siege of Puy-St.-Front, he had been “joyfully\r\nreceived” by the monks of S. Martial’s at Limoges[160]—perhaps\r\nnot by the monks only. The careless, easy, shallow disposition of\r\nEleanor’s eldest son was far more in accord than the energetic temper\r\nof Richard with the ideas of the Aquitanian nobles as to what their\r\nduke should be. The policy of setting him up as Richard’s rival was\r\nobvious; and a characteristic action on Richard’s part helped, most\r\nopportunely from Bertrand’s point of view, to stir up the elder\r\nbrother’s latent jealousy of the greater independence granted to the\r\nyounger one by their father. About half way between Châtelleraut and\r\nPoitiers, on the borders of Anjou and Poitou, there rose out of the\r\nchampaign land a certain hill which seems to have struck Richard as\r\nbeing a good site for a castle. He built a castle on it accordingly,\r\njust as the first “great builder” of the Angevin family, Fulk the\r\nBlack, had built so many of the fortresses in the Loire valley, and\r\njust as he himself in later days built the last and greatest of\r\nall the fortresses reared by Fulk’s descendants—without regard to\r\nthe fact that the site did not belong to him. It really belonged to\r\nhis father; but, being in Anjou, it formed part of the territory\r\ndestined to fall at his father’s death to the share of the young\r\nking.[161] Bertrand seized his opportunity. “At Clairvaux”—such was\r\nthe name given, somewhat inappropriately as it seems, to the new\r\nfortress—“a fair castle has been, without hindrance, built and set\r\nin the midst of the fields. I would not that the young king knew of\r\nit or saw it,” ran the troubadour’s sarcastic verse, “for he would\r\nnot be pleased therewith; but I fear, so white it is, he will see it\r\nfrom Matefélon.”[162] The young king seems to have remonstrated with\r\nRichard,[163] but without effect. It is doubtful whether these things\r\ntook place before or after his visit to Limoges; the sequence of\r\nevents in Aquitaine during the years 1181-2, like that of Bertrand’s\r\n_sirventes_ on which we are largely dependent for our knowledge of\r\nthose events, is obscure; but one thing is clear: before Christmas\r\n1182 young Henry was secretly pledged to the league against his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, that league was for a time broken up by the submission\r\nof Aimar of Limoges and Elias of Périgord, and for some months\r\nthe Taillefer brothers and their adherents in the Angoumois seem\r\nto have been the only enemies whom Richard had to fight. At the\r\nbeginning of November he took from them the castle of Blanzac;[164]\r\nand about the same time Chalais was fortified against him by its\r\nlord, Oliver of Castillon.[165] Before Christmas Richard rejoined\r\nhis father and brothers in Normandy. He seems to have taken Bertrand\r\nde Born with him; at any rate he and Bertrand were for a while both\r\nat once with the court at Argenton, and to all appearance on very\r\nfriendly terms.[166] Most likely, however, their friendliness was on\r\nboth sides only external. Bertrand soon afterwards unceremoniously\r\nexpressed his opinion that the Norman court, “where there was no\r\n_gab_ and laughter and no giving of presents,” was not worthy to be\r\ncalled a court, and declared that the dulness and rusticity (“l’enois\r\ne la vilania”) of Argenton would have been the death of him, but for\r\nthe “good company” of the duchess of Saxony,[167] Richard’s sister,\r\nto whom the troubadour had (according to his own account) been\r\nintroduced in a highly complimentary manner by Richard himself.[168]\r\nBertrand’s own military resources were small,[169] and he is not\r\nlikely to have taken any active part in the recent war; but the\r\nearlier _sirventes_ by which he had striven to foment it seem to have\r\nalready brought upon him a warning from the duke,[170] and it may\r\nhave been a measure of policy on Richard’s part, when he quitted his\r\nduchy, to command or invite the poet to accompany him, and even to be\r\nat some pains to furnish him with a new subject for his verse.\r\n\r\nThe darkest secrets connected with the league did not come out till\r\nafter Christmas. The festival week was spent by the two Henrys,\r\nRichard, and Geoffrey, at Caen.[171] On [Sidenote: 1183] January\r\n1, 1183, the young king, “of his own accord, no one compelling\r\nhim,” publicly took an oath on the Gospels that he would serve his\r\nfather loyally and faithfully from that time forth; “and because—as\r\nhe asserted—he desired to retain in his mind no malice or rancour\r\nwhereby his father might afterwards be offended, he made known to\r\nhim that he (young Henry) was bound by an agreement with the barons\r\nof Aquitaine against his brother Richard; having been moved thereto\r\nbecause the castle of Clairvaux had been built against his will,\r\nin the patrimony which was his rightful inheritance, by his said\r\nbrother; wherefore he besought his father to take that castle from\r\nRichard and retain it in his own keeping.” Richard, when admonished\r\nby his father on the subject, at first refused to give up the castle,\r\nbut afterwards at his father’s desire “freely made it over to him to\r\ndispose of it according to his good pleasure.”[172]\r\n\r\nThe question of Clairvaux was thus settled for the lifetime of the\r\nelder king; the settlement was that which the younger one had himself\r\nproposed, and it ought to have led to his immediate withdrawal from\r\nhis engagements with Richard’s enemies. But the incident had a\r\nfurther significance which filled Henry II with dismay. It showed\r\nhim that on his death not only might this particular dispute between\r\nyoung Henry and Richard be reopened, but a crowd of other disputes\r\nmight arise among all his sons about their feudal relations with each\r\nother, and that unless these relations were fixed beforehand, all\r\nhis schemes for preserving the integrity of the Angevin dominions\r\nwould probably come to nought. As soon as the festival season was\r\nover he set out with his sons for Anjou. When they reached Le Mans,\r\nhe expressed his desire that young Henry, as the future head of\r\nthe family, should receive the homage of Richard and Geoffrey for\r\ntheir respective duchies.[173] It seems that the proposition was\r\nmade privately to the young king, and was at least tacitly accepted\r\nby him. Accordingly, on arriving at Angers, Henry II took measures\r\nfor confirming once for all “a bond of perpetual peace” between the\r\nthree brothers. First, each of them swore to keep his fealty to his\r\nfather always and against all men, and always to render to him due\r\nhonour and service. Next, they all swore that they would “always\r\nkeep peace among themselves according to the disposition made by\r\ntheir father.”[174] Whatever may have been the case with regard to\r\nGeoffrey and Britanny, it appears that Richard, at least, was thus\r\nfar wholly unaware that the “disposition” which he was thus pledged\r\nto respect implied any arrangements beyond those which already\r\nexisted concerning his tenure of Poitou or of Aquitaine. The elder\r\nking now publicly called upon the younger one to receive Geoffrey’s\r\nliege homage for Britanny. To this neither of the brothers objected,\r\nand the homage was duly rendered and received.[175] Next, the father\r\n“used his utmost endeavours that the young king should grant the\r\nduchy of Aquitaine to his brother Richard, to be held by Richard and\r\nhis heirs by an undisputable right.”[176] Richard at first declared\r\nhe would do no homage to his brother, who was no more than his\r\nequal either in personal distinction or in nobility of birth; but\r\nafterwards, yielding to his father’s counsel,[177] he consented.\r\nThereupon, however, the young king drew back.[178] He seems to have\r\nexplained more fully the nature and extent of his entanglement\r\nwith the malcontent barons of Aquitaine, and to have urged that\r\nhe could not thus desert their cause without a guarantee that his\r\nfather would make a settled peace between them and Richard. The\r\nfinal settlement between the brothers was therefore postponed till\r\nthe Aquitanian barons could meet the king and his sons at Mirebeau.\r\nHenry promised that he would then confirm peace on the terms settled\r\nin the preceding summer, or, if this did not satisfy the barons, he\r\nwould judge their cause in his own court. Geoffrey of Britanny was\r\nsent to invite or summon the barons to the meeting.[179] With these\r\narrangements young Henry professed himself content, and he promised\r\nthat he would, at Mirebeau, accept Richard’s homage, but on one\r\nfurther condition: that Richard should, after performing the homage,\r\nswear fealty to him on some holy relics. This last requirement, being\r\na plain insinuation of lack of confidence in Richard’s honour, was an\r\ninsult to which Richard could not submit. He “broke out in a white\r\nheat of passion,” and not only again refused to perform the homage\r\nat all, but—so it was said—declared that it was unmeet for him to\r\nacknowledge, by any kind of subjection, a superior in a brother born\r\nof the same parents, and that as their father’s property was the due\r\nheritage of the first-born, so he himself claimed to be, with equal\r\njustice, the lawful successor of their mother.[180] “Leaving nought\r\nbut insults and threats behind him” he quitted the court, hurried\r\ninto his own duchy, and prepared for defence.[181] His vehemence\r\nkindled the wrath of his father, who hastily bade the young king\r\n“rise up and subdue Richard’s pride,” and sent orders to Geoffrey to\r\n“stand faithfully by his eldest brother and liege lord.”[182]\r\n\r\nNeither young Henry nor Geoffrey needed a second bidding. Geoffrey,\r\nsent into Aquitaine as a messenger of peace, had carried thither,\r\nas a contemporary writer says, not peace but a sword. He and his\r\neldest brother were already in collusion, and instead of executing\r\nhis father’s commission to the malcontent barons, he had secretly\r\nused the opportunity which that commission gave him to renew the\r\nalliance between them and the young king, whom they were now eager\r\nto set up as duke in Richard’s stead.[183] At the beginning of\r\nFebruary[184] the young king set out for Limoges; it seems to have\r\nbeen arranged that his father, with a small force, should travel\r\nby another route and join him there later.[185] Geoffrey was there\r\nalready; the viscount, Aimar, at once joined them, and endeavoured\r\nto terrify the burghers of the castle into doing likewise. His\r\nthreats were emphasized by the neighbourhood of a host of Routiers\r\nwho seem to have been secretly engaged to be in readiness for a\r\ncall from Geoffrey.[186] That call Geoffrey now gave, and one body\r\nof these ruffians, with some of his own vassals, swooped down from\r\nBritanny upon Poitou and began plundering and burning the demesnes\r\nof the count, who retaliated by making similar raids into Britanny,\r\n“and if any man of that troop fell into his clutches, that man’s\r\nhead was cut off without respect of persons.”[187] Another body of\r\nRoutiers had come up from Gascony under a certain Raymond “Brunus,\r\nor Brenuus” at the call of Aimar, and were with him engaged on\r\nFebruary 12 at Gorre, some few miles south of Limoges, in besieging\r\na church—probably fortified by the villagers for use as a place of\r\nrefuge—when the duke fell suddenly upon them. From a castle somewhere\r\nbeyond Poitiers he had ridden for two days almost without stopping;\r\nhis force was small, but the enemies were caught at unawares; many\r\nof them were made prisoners; a nephew of their commander, Raymond,\r\nwas laid low by Richard’s own hand; Aimar and the rest of the band\r\nescaped only because the horses of the Poitevins were too exhausted\r\nfor pursuit.[188]\r\n\r\nThe English chronicler who records Richard’s treatment of the\r\ncaptured invaders may have been shocked at the indiscriminate\r\nruthlessness which slew mercenaries and knights all alike; but the\r\nPrior of Vigeois evidently saw nothing more than just retribution in\r\nthe fate of the sacrilegious “children of darkness” who were made\r\nprisoners at Gorre. Richard dragged them to Aixe and there “caused\r\nsome of them to be drowned in the Vienne, some to be slain with the\r\nsword, and the rest to be blinded.”[189] It was almost a necessity to\r\nget rid of these men. The league was no longer secret; many of the\r\nconspirators were delivering up their castles to the young king.[190]\r\nThe danger was evident enough to make Richard send an urgent message\r\nto his father asking him to come to the rescue at once.[191] Henry\r\naccordingly advanced towards Limoges. A watchman on the castle wall\r\ncried out that the city folk were bringing up troops to destroy their\r\nrivals of the castle; someone else spread a report that Geoffrey of\r\nBritanny was in great danger outside the walls; the townsfolk rushed\r\nout and began a fierce fight which was with difficulty stopped when\r\nthe royal banners were recognized.[192] The king withdrew to Aixe.\r\nAt night young Henry—still maintaining a pretence of loyalty—went\r\nto his father and tried to excuse the blunder of the townsfolk; but\r\nhis excuses were rejected. “Then, at the viscount’s command, the\r\npeople swore fealty to the young king in the church of S. Peter of\r\nCarfax.”[193]\r\n\r\nAll concealment was now flung aside. Walls and ramparts, turrets\r\nand battlements, rose with incredible speed all round Limoges; the\r\nmaterial being of course mostly wood, derived, it seems, from some\r\nhalf dozen or more churches which castle folk and city folk alike\r\npulled down without scruple. Another horde of Routiers, hired by the\r\nviscounts of Limoges and Turenne, and commanded by one Sancho “of\r\nSérannes” and another leader who seems to have adopted the heathen\r\nappellation of Curbaran,[194] appeared at Terrasson in Périgord,\r\ncrossed the Limousin frontier, seized Yssandon, and swept across\r\nthe viscounty of Limoges as far north as Pierre-Buffière, which\r\nthey wrested from King Henry’s soldiers and restored to its rebel\r\nowner and to the viscount; thence they went south again and after an\r\nunsuccessful attempt on Brive took up their quarters at Yssandon.\r\nOther “Tartarean legions” poured in from the north, sent by Philip\r\nof France to support the cause of his brother-in-law.[195] If these\r\nRoutiers could have been controlled by their employers, Henry and\r\nRichard might probably have been easily surrounded and captured.\r\nNothing of the kind was, however, attempted. Instead, “the whole\r\nassembly of malignants, gathered together from divers parts,” were\r\nleft to take their own way and spread themselves over the whole of\r\nPérigord, the Angoumois and Saintonge; the country was ravished,\r\nshrines were plundered, altars desecrated, and expelled monks fled\r\nwith the relics of their patron saints as in the days of the heathen\r\nNorthmen.[196] Meanwhile King Henry had called up the feudal forces\r\nof his other continental dominions[197] to deal with the rebels in\r\nLimoges. On Shrove Tuesday, March 1, he entered the city, broke down\r\nthe bridge behind him, and disposed his forces for a siege of the\r\ntown. That siege dragged on till midsummer. Shortly before Easter\r\n(March 17) the young king went to secure Angoulême by filling it\r\nwith “a crowd of malignants,” hired with the proceeds of a forcible\r\nseizure of the treasures of S. Martial’s Abbey. On account of this\r\nsacrilege the town guard of S. Martial’s castle, when he returned\r\nthither, pelted him ignominiously away;[198] but Aimar and Geoffrey\r\ncontinued to hold the place.[199]\r\n\r\nRichard had accompanied his father to the siege,[200] but soon left\r\nit for more active work. He set himself to recover Saintonge and the\r\nAngoumois from the Routiers and the rebels; and he seems to have\r\nnot only succeeded in this, but to have chased the marauders out of\r\nSaintonge northward across western Poitou right over the frontier of\r\nBritanny.[201] This campaign, ignored by the chroniclers, won for\r\nhim a striking tribute from his most determined enemy; Bertrand de\r\nBorn, composing a _sirventes_ in behalf of the league and actually at\r\nthe request of the young king, could not refrain from expressing his\r\nadmiration for the courage and persistence of the count of Poitou.\r\n“When this game is played out we shall know which of the king’s sons\r\nis to have the land. The young king would have soon conquered it\r\nif the count were not so well practised at the game; but he shuts\r\nthem (his enemies) in so fast and presses them so hard that he has\r\nrecovered Saintonge by force, and delivered the Angoumois as far\r\nas the border of Finisterre.... Hunted and wounded wild boar saw\r\nwe never more furious than he is, yet he never swerves from his\r\ncourse.”[202] On the other hand, two of the most powerful feudataries\r\nof the French Crown, the duke of Burgundy and the count of Toulouse,\r\nhad by this time definitely pledged themselves to the league. Both of\r\nthem met young Henry at Uzerche on May 24 and brought reinforcements\r\nto his cause.[203] Bertrand’s boast that the war begun in the\r\nLimousin should involve France, Normandy and Flanders before it was\r\nended[204] might yet have been fulfilled, but for an unexpected\r\ncatastrophe: early in June young Henry fell sick, and on the 11th he\r\ndied.[205]\r\n\r\nAlmost instantly the league fell asunder. The object which its\r\nnon-Aquitanian members had in view was to break the power of Henry\r\nII; they had found a priceless tool for their purpose in his eldest\r\nson, who, being like himself a crowned and anointed king, could be\r\nset up as a rival head of the Angevin house; the Aquitanian revolt\r\nhad offered a promising opportunity for using that tool to their\r\nadvantage. When young Henry was gone, their purpose in joining the\r\nleague was ruined; the internal quarrels of Aquitaine and its rulers\r\nhad no interest for them. Accordingly Hugh of Burgundy and Raymond\r\nof Toulouse “hurried away after their own affairs”;[206] and instead\r\nof the great coalition which was to have ringed in the Angevins from\r\nthe Pyrenees to the Channel, Henry and Richard had now only to face\r\nthe enfeebled remains of a local revolt. The news came to Richard\r\nwhen he was besieging Aixe, which young Henry had seized a few weeks\r\nbefore.[207] The king, when the first shock of grief was over,\r\nresumed the siege of Limoges; Geoffrey seems to have slipped away to\r\nBritanny; once more, on Midsummer day, Aimar surrendered the town\r\nand renounced all dealings with his brothers of Angoulême “till they\r\nshould deserve grace of the king and the duke”; and once more the new\r\nfortifications were levelled to the ground.[208] For what remained\r\nto be done Henry’s presence was needless. At the end of the month he\r\nwent back to his northern dominions, while Alfonso of Aragon joined\r\nRichard in laying siege to Hautefort. In a week (June 30-July 6)\r\nBertrand de Born was forced to surrender it; and a punitive harrying\r\nof Périgord by Richard brought the revolt to an end.[209]\r\n\r\nBrief as the war had been, it was not without results. A few at least\r\nof the insurgent barons had made their profit out of the general\r\nconfusion. It must have been during this time that the Lusignans\r\ngained a hold on La Marche which they never entirely lost. Richard’s\r\nefforts to establish Maud as countess of Angoulême may have been\r\ncontinued for a while longer, but they were doomed to fail sooner\r\nor later by reason of Philip’s grant of the city to the rival\r\nclaimant. Bertrand de Born, in spite of the warning given him some\r\nmonths before by the duke himself, had persisted in his defiance to\r\nthe uttermost. He was captured with his castle, brought before his\r\nconqueror, and compelled to resign his claim to its ownership.[210]\r\nHe implored the duke’s mercy, and Richard at once granted him his\r\nfull forgiveness,[211] but gave back Hautefort to Constantine.[212]\r\nThis decision, however, was reversed by King Henry,[213] probably on\r\nan appeal from the troubadour. Richard appears to have acquiesced\r\nwithout difficulty in his father’s decision on the point;[214] and\r\nRichard, not Henry, was destined to reap its results. Bertrand had\r\nalready declared that if the duke would be gracious and generous to\r\nhim he should find him as true as steel,[215] and he kept his word;\r\nfor he perceived that his talents for fighting, and for setting\r\nothers to fight, might after all be exercised not less actively, and\r\nwith less danger of disastrous consequences to himself, on the side\r\nof the duke than on that of the duke’s enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nKING HENRY’S HEIR\r\n\r\n1183-1189\r\n\r\n  Et vos, patres, nolite in iracundiam provocare filios vestros.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was into the life of Richard himself that his brother’s death\r\nbrought the most important change. He was now the eldest son of Henry\r\nII, heir to the headship of the houses of Anjou and Normandy and to\r\nthe crown of England. Some re-adjustment of his feudal relations\r\nboth with his father and with the King of France would seem to be a\r\nprobable consequence of this change in his prospects. Henry was not\r\nlikely to repeat the mistake which he had made thirteen years before\r\nin crowning his heir; but Richard might naturally expect that the\r\nother measures which had been taken to secure the Angevin and Norman\r\nheritages for young Henry would be renewed in his own behalf. He was\r\nevidently quite unprepared for the step which his father actually\r\ntook. In September or October Henry summoned him to Normandy, and on\r\nhis arrival “bade him grant the duchy of Aquitaine to his brother\r\nJohn and receive John’s homage for it.”[216]\r\n\r\nIn all Henry’s plans for the future of his dynasty there was assumed\r\na fundamental principle, implied rather than expressed, because\r\n(to him at least) too self-evident to need expression: that the\r\nterritories which he had inherited from his parents, Anjou, Normandy,\r\nand England, must remain united under the direct control of the head\r\nof the family. Any deviation from this principle would, he saw,\r\nendanger the stability of the Angevin dominion, for it would be a\r\nbreaking-up of the foundation on which that dominion was based. The\r\ndevolution of Aquitaine and of Britanny to junior branches of the\r\nAngevin house, under the overlordship of its head, would not involve\r\nthe same danger; and thus after his agreement with Conan of Britanny\r\nin 1166 Henry had ready to his hand the means of making a fair and\r\nsubstantial provision for two younger sons; but when a fourth son\r\nwas born, he saw so little chance of being able to provide for the\r\nchild on anything like the same scale that he at once called him\r\n“John Lackland,” and, it seems, placed him when little more than a\r\ntwelvemonth old as an oblate in the abbey of Fontevraud.[217] At the\r\nage of six years, however, if not sooner, John was brought back to\r\nhis father’s court, and in the next ten years scheme after scheme for\r\nhis future was planned by Henry, but without success. Now at last,\r\njust when John had reached an age at which he must have begun to feel\r\nkeenly the difference between his prospects and those of Richard\r\nand Geoffrey, the death of the eldest brother opened a possible\r\nway—possible at least in Henry’s eyes—for redressing this inequality.\r\nWe cannot tell what was the precise form of the proposition made by\r\nHenry to Richard; but if the report of it given by a contemporary\r\nEnglish chronicler be correct, it clearly involved a tacit, if not an\r\nexplicit, recognition of Richard as heir to the headship of the royal\r\nhouse of England and Anjou, and, as such, to the overlordship of the\r\nwhole of the Angevin dominions, including Aquitaine. The chronicler’s\r\nwords do not, on the other hand, necessarily or even probably imply\r\nthat Henry contemplated an immediate transfer of the fief which he\r\ndesired Richard to “grant” to John. John was not yet seventeen; he\r\nseems to have been brought up partly in England, partly in Normandy;\r\nit would have been sheer madness to think of setting him to take the\r\ncommand of affairs in a country which the united energies of Richard\r\nand of Henry himself scarcely sufficed to keep under control. In\r\nall likelihood the settlement which the king desired to make had\r\nreference, like that of 1169, wholly to the future, and was designed\r\nto confirm the earlier settlement, only with a change of persons; as\r\nRichard must take the place of the dead Henry, John was to take the\r\nplace of Richard.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this project required the consent of two persons:\r\nRichard and the King of France. Richard’s consent proved harder\r\nto win than Henry seems to have expected. There was a fundamental\r\nthough unexpressed difference between the views taken by the father\r\nand the son of the place actually held by the son in Aquitaine.\r\nHenry’s intention apparently had been from the outset, and was still,\r\nthat Aquitaine should during his own lifetime be governed by his\r\nson—whether Richard or John—as his representative, and after his\r\ndeath should become an underfief of the Angevin dominion—as Britanny\r\nalready was—in the hands of that same son and his heirs. Unluckily\r\nhe had allowed one part of this intention to be obscured, and in\r\npractice well-nigh defeated, by his anxiety to secure the fulfilment\r\nof the other part. From Henry’s point of view, Richard in 1183 was\r\nsimply his homager for the county of Poitou, his lieutenant over the\r\nrest of the duchy, heir to the whole of it when he himself should\r\ndie, and, after young Henry’s death, heir also to the headship of\r\nthe royal house of England, Normandy and Anjou. But Richard could,\r\nand did in effect, claim to be already duke of Aquitaine in his own\r\nright, by virtue of his homage to France and his investiture at\r\nLimoges. Moreover, Eleanor’s duchy held a different place in the\r\nestimation of her son—the son who from his infancy had been her\r\nrecognized heir—from that which it held in the estimation of her\r\nhusband. Henry looked upon it as a mere appendage to his ancestral\r\nterritories; Richard looked upon it as his own especial possession,\r\nand a possession which ought to rank in the future, as it always\r\nhad ranked in the past, on a footing of equality with them. The\r\nsame feeling which made Henry shrink from reducing the heritage of\r\nGeoffrey Plantagenet or that of Maud of Normandy to the position of\r\nan underfief would make Richard shrink from contemplating a like\r\nalteration in the status of the heritage of his mother. The tragedy\r\nof the last summer and the sudden change in his own prospects had so\r\nfar chastened his impetuous temper that he did not at once refuse his\r\nfather’s demand, but asked for two or three days delay that he might\r\nconsult with friends before giving a reply. Then he withdrew from the\r\ncourt; at nightfall he mounted his horse, and rode southward with all\r\nspeed, sending word to his father that “he would never grant Poitou\r\nto be held by anyone but himself.”[218]\r\n\r\nAt the Christmas feast, which he kept at Talmont—a favourite hunting\r\nseat of the Poitevin counts, on the coast near La Rochelle—Richard\r\n“showed himself lavish in the distribution of gifts.”[219] Some of\r\nthese were probably rewards to vassals who had kept their allegiance\r\nduring the recent war; others may have purchased the withdrawal from\r\nthe country, or the permanent enlistment under the ducal banner, of\r\nsome of the mercenary leaders whom it was needful to dispose of in\r\none way or the other, if the ducal government was to be carried on at\r\nall. The various bands of Routiers, left suddenly without employers\r\nby the submission of Aimar of Limoges, the death of young Henry,\r\nand the collapse of the league, had scattered in all directions.\r\nRaymond “the Brown” seemingly went into the Angoumois; on August\r\n10 (1183) he was slain at Châteauneuf.[220] One large body under\r\nCurbaran swept across Berry into the Orléanais, only to be almost\r\ndestroyed at Châteaudun on July 30 by the “Peace-makers,” a sworn\r\nbrotherhood formed among the country folk to resist the marauders\r\nand restore peace to the land.[221] Curbaran himself was among the\r\nprisoners, who were all hanged.[222] Sancho was still in the Limousin\r\nwith his followers; and Curbaran’s place seems to have been taken by\r\na man who in the “tongue of _oc_” bore the name of “Lo Bar,”[223]\r\na name which, transmuted by northern speakers into “Louvrekaire”\r\nor “Lupicar,” was in later days to be closely associated with the\r\nlast struggle of the Angevins to keep their hold on Normandy. The\r\nprivilege of private warfare, which was [Sidenote: 1183-4] the most\r\ncherished birthright of the barons of Aquitaine, enabled Aimar of\r\nLimoges to supply Lobar and Sancho and “a countless host” with\r\noccupation which they supplemented by harrying monasteries from\r\nYssandon to Orleans, and ravaging “the king of England’s lands” in\r\nthe Limousin and La Marche. Richard evidently suspected, perhaps\r\nknew, that in this last matter the hand of Aimar was with them. It\r\nis at this juncture that the most famous of all the Routiers of the\r\nperiod, Mercadier, first appears in Richard’s service. “Under the\r\nprotection of the duke Mercadier and his troop dashed across Aimar’s\r\nterritory, and on the [Sidenote: 1184] first day of the second\r\nweek of Lent (1184) cruelly ravaged the town of Excideuil and its\r\nsuburbs” are almost the last words that have come down to us from the\r\nchronicler who thus far has been our chief authority for the history\r\nof Aquitaine under duke Richard.[224]\r\n\r\nHenry meanwhile had come to an agreement with the king of France\r\nwhich was likely to have an important influence on the future of\r\nRichard and of his duchy. On December 6, [Sidenote: 1183] 1183, the\r\ntwo kings held a conference, and Henry did a thing which he had\r\nnever before consented to do: he did homage to Philip for “all his\r\nterritories on the French side of the sea.”[225] Philip’s acceptance\r\nof this homage constituted a legal recognition on his part, as lord\r\nparamount, of Henry as—among other things—duke of Aquitaine. The\r\nkings then proceeded to make a new settlement about the dowry of\r\nyoung Henry’s widow. As she was childless, that portion of it which\r\nwas in the hands of her father-in-law—Gisors and the rest of the\r\nNorman Vexin—legally reverted to France on her husband’s death.\r\nPhilip, however, in consideration of an annuity to be paid by Henry\r\nto Margaret, “quit-claimed Gisors to the English king, so that he\r\nmight give it to whichever of his sons he should choose, with the\r\nFrench king’s other sister,” Aloysia.[226] Henry evidently hoped to\r\nkeep Aloysia and her dowry by substituting John for Richard as her\r\nbridegroom, and thus to facilitate the winning of Philip’s assent to\r\nthe further substitution of John for Richard as heir of Aquitaine.\r\nRichard was probably quite [Sidenote: 1183-4] willing to relinquish\r\nhis personal claim upon Aloysia; there is no indication that he had\r\never cared for her; and on the other hand there are indications that\r\nabout this time he formed an attachment to another maiden of royal\r\nbirth, Berengaria of Navarre.[227] On the subject of Aquitaine,\r\nhowever, he was immoveable. In vain Henry alternately besought and\r\ncommanded him to grant “if not the whole of Aquitaine, at least a\r\npart of it,” to John. Richard’s answer was always the same: never,\r\nso long as he lived, would he give any part of the duchy [Sidenote:\r\n1184] to anyone. At last, in a burst of anger, Henry gave John leave\r\nto “lead an army into Richard’s land and get what he wanted from\r\nhis brother by fighting him.”[228] The words were probably uttered\r\nwithout thought of their consequences, in a fit of ungovernable\r\nimpatience at Richard’s obduracy; but John was quite ready to\r\ntake them literally, and knew that his next brother, Geoffrey—who\r\nhad been formally reconciled to his father and to Richard in July\r\n1183[229]—both could and would supply him with means for his purpose.\r\nNo sooner had the king returned to England in June 1184 than Geoffrey\r\nand John collected “a great host” and marched plundering and burning\r\ninto Richard’s land. Henry, when he learned what was going on,\r\nperemptorily summoned all the three to England, brought them to a\r\npublic reconciliation in November, and then sought to dispose for a\r\nwhile of Geoffrey where he could make no further mischief between the\r\ntwo others, by sending him, not back to Britanny, but to Normandy,\r\nas a nominal assistant to the officers who were in charge of that\r\nduchy.[230] It [Sidenote: 1185] was not till after Christmas that\r\nRichard received permission to return to Poitou. He crossed from\r\nDover to Wissant;[231] whether on his way through Normandy and Anjou\r\nhe met Geoffrey—who was certainly the evil genius of the family—and\r\nwhat may have passed between them if he did, we know not; we only\r\nknow that on April 16 Henry himself went back to Normandy, and\r\nstraightway “gathered a great host to subdue his son Richard, who\r\nhad fortified Poitou against him and attacked his brother Geoffrey,\r\ncontrary to the king’s prohibition.”[232]\r\n\r\nHenry’s military preparations were in reality only a part of a new\r\nscheme which he had devised for making Richard surrender Poitou.\r\nIn the preceding June (1184) Queen [Sidenote: 1184] Eleanor, after\r\neleven years of captivity, had been released by her husband’s order\r\nand permitted to join their eldest daughter and her husband the duke\r\nof Saxony, now for the second time driven into exile.[233] At the end\r\nof April (1185) [Sidenote: 1185] Henry sent for her, and also for\r\ntheir daughter and son-in-law, to join him in Normandy; “and when\r\nthey arrived, he sent instructions to his son Richard that he should\r\nwithout delay surrender the whole of Poitou with its appurtenances to\r\nhis mother Queen Eleanor, because it was her heritage; and he added\r\nthat if Richard in any way delayed to fulfil this command, he was\r\nto know for certain that the queen his mother would make it her own\r\nbusiness to ravage the land with a great host. And Richard, when he\r\nhad heard his father’s command, yielded to the wholesome advice of\r\nhis friends; and laying down the arms of iniquity, returned with all\r\nmeekness to his father, and surrendered all Poitou, with his castles\r\nand fortresses, to his mother.”[234]\r\n\r\nHenry’s scheme seemed to be on the verge of success. Richard had\r\nat last been induced to surrender, nominally to his mother, but\r\npractically to his father—for Eleanor was clearly a mere cipher in\r\nthe matter—the fief for which he was his father’s homager, and which\r\nwas the material basis of the ducal power over all Aquitaine; he had\r\nset his father free to make a new grant of that fief to whomsoever\r\nhe would. If a grant of it were made to John, with the sanction\r\nof the lord paramount, Richard would soon be unable to stand his\r\nground in the duchy, should he even attempt to do so. For the time\r\nbeing Richard was utterly passive. It was his nature to do nothing\r\nby halves, and his submission seems to have been as whole-hearted\r\nas his defiance had been; “he remained,” says an English chronicler\r\nwith evident admiration, “with his father as an obedient son.”[235]\r\nHenry kept [Sidenote: 1186] him in suspense for eleven months. Then,\r\non March 10, 1186, the two kings held another conference, and the\r\ntreaty made in December 1183 was confirmed, but with a modification\r\nof one article. In 1184 Henry had either made overtures, or readily\r\naccepted overtures made to him, for a marriage between Richard and\r\na daughter of the Emperor;[236] but the maiden had died before the\r\nend of the year.[237] This project had been succeeded by another\r\nwhose originator is most likely to have been Richard himself;\r\nit can hardly have been at any other time than during his brief\r\nperiod of freedom from his engagement to Aloysia that he received\r\na promise of Berengaria’s hand from her father, King Sancho.[238]\r\nHis inclination, however, was overridden by his father’s imperious\r\nwill and by the exigencies of the family policy. If Philip knew or\r\nsuspected anything of Henry’s projects for John, he was probably\r\nkeen-witted enough to perceive their futility and to prefer running\r\nno risk of a family alliance with a Lackland. On the other hand,\r\nthe retention of Aloysia’s dower-lands was a matter of interest to\r\nHenry’s heir as well as to Henry himself. The sequel was to show that\r\nHenry had no real intention of marrying Aloysia to either of his\r\nsons; he may therefore have privately intimated to Richard that the\r\nsacrifice now required of him was only temporary. At any rate, in the\r\ntreaty with Philip as ratified [Sidenote: 1186] on March 10, 1186, it\r\nwas distinctly stated that Aloysia and her dowry, the Vexin, were to\r\nbe given to the bridegroom for whom she had been originally destined,\r\nRichard.[239]\r\n\r\nAn agreement with France was at that moment especially important\r\nfor Henry because he was anxious to return to England. He began his\r\npreparations for departure over sea by making some changes in the\r\ncustody of his various demesne lands and castles;[240] in particular,\r\nhe appointed new castellans of his own choosing to the charge of\r\nthe principal fortresses of Aquitaine. It was hardly possible for\r\nRichard not to feel hurt by this measure, “yet his father met with\r\nno complaint from him.”[241] Suddenly the king again changed his\r\nmind, or at least his policy. We cannot tell whether he was moved by\r\nRichard’s unwonted meekness, or whether some unrecorded occurrence\r\nopened his eyes to a fact which in all likelihood Richard’s southern\r\ncounsellors, when they advised the young duke to accede to his\r\nfather’s demand, foresaw would be made manifest ere long: the fact\r\nthat Richard was the only person who could preserve anything like\r\nadministrative order and political security in Aquitaine when Henry\r\nhimself was out of reach. We only know that at the end of April the\r\nking “entrusted to his son Richard an infinite sum of money, bidding\r\nhim go and subdue his enemies under him,” and then himself sailed for\r\nEngland, taking the queen with him.[242]\r\n\r\nRichard’s surrender of Poitou was thus practically annulled. It may\r\nhave been merely verbal, so that no formal act was necessary to\r\nreinstate him as count. The particular enemies whom he was to subdue\r\nare not named, but it seems plain that the chief of them was Raymond\r\nof Toulouse; for Richard “straightway departing (from Normandy)\r\ncollected a great multitude of knights and foot-soldiers, with which\r\nhe invaded the lands of the count of S. Gilles and not only ravaged,\r\nbut conquered, the greater part of them.”[243] Geography suggests\r\nthat the part of Raymond’s lands which Richard “conquered” at this\r\ntime was probably the northern part, that is, the Quercy, where\r\nRichard as suzerain had already had to chastise more than one of\r\nRaymond’s subfeudataries; and this inference is strengthened by later\r\nindications. Raymond, helpless before the sudden violence of the\r\nduke’s onset, fled from place to place and despatched messenger after\r\nmessenger to their common overlord, King Philip, imploring succour\r\nfrom France. Philip, however, was just then in no mind to quarrel\r\nopenly with the king of England or his son; it suited him better to\r\nplot secretly with one of the younger sons against the father and the\r\neldest son, and this was what he was actually doing with Geoffrey\r\nwhen in August their plotting was cut short by Geoffrey’s death.[244]\r\nA question at once arose whether Henry, the immediate overlord of\r\nBritanny, or Philip, the lord paramount, should be guardian of\r\nGeoffrey’s child. An embassy sent from England to treat with Philip\r\non this subject met with a very uncivil reception, and went back\r\naccompanied by two French knights charged with a message to Henry\r\nthat he must expect no security from attack in Normandy unless Count\r\nRichard of Poitou ceased to molest the count of S. Gilles.[245] What\r\nRaymond had done to excite the wrath of both Henry and Richard we are\r\nnot told, but it is clear that Henry did not disapprove Richard’s\r\nproceedings; he made no attempt to check them, and did not return to\r\nNormandy [Sidenote: 1187] till February of the next year. Richard\r\nmet him at Aumale, and accompanied him on Low Sunday, April 5, to\r\na conference with Philip “from which they withdrew without hope\r\nof peace or concord, on account of the intolerable demands made by\r\nthe king of France.”[246] These demands were, first, that he should\r\nreceive Richard’s homage for the county of Poitou;[247] and secondly,\r\nthat Aloysia and her dowry, Gisors, should be restored to France.[248]\r\n\r\nHowever “intolerable” these demands might be to Henry, they were in\r\nthemselves not unreasonable. Richard seems to have been personally\r\nnot unwilling to comply with the first condition; he had when a boy\r\nbeen made to do homage to Louis VII, and probably saw no reason\r\nfor not doing the same to Louis’s successor. Henry, however, was\r\nresolved that the homage should not be done, and while ostensibly\r\nleaving the matter in Richard’s hands, made him put it off from day\r\nto day.[249] The second condition was a natural consequence of the\r\nfact that although more than twelve months had passed since the\r\nexplicit renewal of Richard’s engagement to Aloysia, there was still\r\nno sign of any preparations for their marriage. On this point Henry\r\nand Richard were probably at one. At a somewhat later time a horrible\r\nreason was assigned—seemingly by persons whose testimony had weight\r\nenough to carry conviction to both Richard and Philip—for Henry’s\r\nobstinate non-compliance with Philip’s demands for either Aloysia’s\r\nmarriage or the restoration of her person together with her dowry.\r\nAs yet, however, Richard at least evidently did not suspect his\r\nfather of being actuated by any worse motives than, as regards the\r\nformer alternative, consideration for Richard’s own disinclination\r\nto make Aloysia his wife; and as regards the latter alternative, a\r\nreluctance, which Richard himself could not but share, to loose the\r\nAngevin hold on Gisors.\r\n\r\nSeeing that he could get no satisfaction by negotiation, Philip\r\nprepared for war. Marching from the French part of Berry into the\r\nAquitanian part, he seized Issoudun and Graçay and advanced upon\r\nChâteauroux.[250] It is doubtful whether Henry and Richard set out\r\ntogether to check him, or whether Henry sent forward Richard and\r\nJohn, each at the head of a body of troops, to defend Châteauroux\r\ntill he himself could join them.[251] At any rate, by midsummer the\r\ncombined action of father and sons had caused Philip to raise the\r\nsiege and decide upon trying his fortune against them in the open\r\nfield. On the eve of S. John the two armies were drawn up facing each\r\nother in battle array, ready to engage next morning. At the last\r\nmoment, however, the kings made a truce and withdrew each to his\r\nown domains. Two English authorities assign the most important part\r\nin the preliminary negotiations to Richard. According to Gervase of\r\nCanterbury the first overtures came from the French side, and were\r\naddressed to the count of Poitou; Count Philip of Flanders contrived\r\nto get speech with him and urged upon him the importance, for his\r\nown future interest, of making a friend of the king of France; after\r\nsome discussion Richard followed Flanders back through the French\r\nlines to the tent of Philip Augustus, held a long private colloquy\r\nwith him, and “at length returned, with his mind at rest, to his own\r\ncomrades in arms.” He had gone without his father’s knowledge; Henry,\r\nwhen he heard of the incident, “suspected that it meant treachery,\r\nnot peace,” and sent a request to some of the French nobles that they\r\nwould come and confer with himself. They complied; he commissioned\r\nthem to ask Philip for a truce of two years, on the plea of a vow of\r\nCrusade; Philip consented, but when his consent was announced Henry\r\ndeclared he had changed his mind—he would have no truce. Philip on\r\nhearing this ordered an attack at break of day. Henry grew alarmed;\r\nthe midsummer daybreak was very near, for it was already past\r\nmidnight, when he hurriedly called his son. “What shall we do? what\r\ncounsel dost thou give me?” “What counsel can I give,” said Richard,\r\n“when thou hast refused the truce which yesterday thou desiredst? We\r\ncannot ask for it again now without great shame.” Moved, however,\r\nby his father’s evident distress, he offered to face the shame. He\r\nwent; he found Philip already armed for battle; bare-headed he\r\nknelt before him, offered him his sword, and begged him for a truce,\r\npromising that if Henry should break it in any way he, Count Richard,\r\nwould submit his own person in Paris to the judgement of the French\r\nking. On this condition Philip gave a reluctant consent to the\r\ntruce.[252] Gerald of Wales, on the other hand, represents the first\r\nadvances as having been made by Henry in a letter to Philip proposing\r\npeace on the following terms: that Aloysia should be given in\r\nmarriage to John, with the counties of Poitou and Anjou and all the\r\nother territories held by Henry of the French king, except Normandy,\r\nwhich was to remain united to England as the heritage of the eldest\r\nson. Philip sent the letter to Richard, who, when he had mastered its\r\ncontents, was naturally moved to deep indignation on learning that\r\nhis father was thus scheming to deprive him of the larger part of his\r\nheritage at a time when they were actually in camp together and he\r\nwas loyally fulfilling his duties as vassal and son. Caring no longer\r\nto fight for his father against Philip, he seized an opportunity\r\nwhich presented itself at the moment to bring about a truce.[253]\r\n\r\nNeither of these two accounts seems to imply that Richard at\r\nChâteauroux acted otherwise than loyally and in good faith towards\r\nhis father. In one of them, however, the father is distinctly charged\r\nwith plotting behind his son’s back to deprive him of half his\r\ninheritance. The proposal which Henry is said to have made to Philip\r\nis indeed utterly at variance with the policy implied in all his\r\nprevious arrangements for the future of his dynasty; it is a proposal\r\nto disintegrate the foundations of the edifice which he had been\r\nbuilding up all his life, by putting asunder what the marriage of\r\nhis parents had joined together, Anjou and Normandy. We are not told\r\nwhether it provided that John should hold his share of the Angevin\r\nterritories under his brother’s overlordship, or not. If it did, its\r\nfulfilment would have reduced the original Angevin patrimony to the\r\nrank of a mere underfief; if not, the scheme would seem to imply\r\nnothing short of a deliberate intention on Henry’s part of rending\r\nin twain with his own hands the dominion which he had been for\r\nthirty years labouring to weld together into a solid whole. Yet that\r\nHenry would, if he could, willingly have gone as far as this or even\r\nfarther, in his infatuated partiality for John, seems to be the only\r\npossible explanation of his attitude, or rather of his endless shifts\r\nand changes of attitude, towards both Richard and Philip through the\r\nsix years which followed the death of the young king. When the end\r\ncame, he himself summed up the tragic story of those years in one\r\nsignificant sentence: “For the sake of John’s advancement I have\r\nbrought upon me all these ills.”[254] His paternal affection had\r\nbeen concentrated mainly upon two of his sons, the eldest and the\r\nyoungest; after young Henry’s death it was concentrated upon John\r\nalone; Richard, though of all the four he was certainly the least\r\nunworthy, seems never to have enjoyed more than a comparatively small\r\nshare of it. The story of the letter may have been a fiction, or the\r\nletter may have been a forgery; but whether the falsehood—if there be\r\none—were Gerald’s or Philip’s, it was a lie which was half a truth.\r\n\r\nThe formal terms of the truce—which was to last for two\r\nyears[255]—were arranged by the papal legate then resident in France,\r\nand some other men of religion[256] acting “on the orders of the\r\nPope and the advice of the faithful men of both kings.”[257] When\r\nthe agreement was signed, the French king, “by way of shewing to\r\nall men that concord was attained,” invited Richard to accompany\r\nhim to Paris. Richard accepted the invitation;[258] and he stayed\r\nso long, and—so at least it was reported—on terms of such close and\r\naffectionate intimacy with Philip that Henry “marvelled what this\r\nmight be,” and delayed his intended journey to England “till he\r\nshould know what would be the outcome of this sudden friendship”\r\nbetween his overlord and his son.[259] He sent messenger after\r\nmessenger to call Richard back, promising “to do all that might be\r\njustly required of him.” Richard answered that he was coming, but\r\ninstead of doing so he went to Chinon, where the treasure of Anjou\r\nwas kept; in spite of the treasurer’s opposition he carried off “all\r\nthe treasure that he found there”—which indeed is not likely to have\r\nbeen much—proceeded with it into Poitou, and there used it to fortify\r\nor revictual his castles. His contumacy, however, as usual, did not\r\nlast long. His father “ceased not to send messengers to him till they\r\nbrought him back; and when he came, he submitted to his father in all\r\nthings and was penitent for having consented to the evil counsels\r\nof those who strove to sow discord between them. So they came both\r\ntogether to Angers; and there the son became his father’s obedient\r\nman, and swore on the holy Gospels, before many witnesses, fealty to\r\nhim against all men; and he swore also that he would not go against\r\nhis father’s counsel.”[260]\r\n\r\nEarly in November Richard was at, or near, Tours, when suddenly the\r\ntidings of an event which had occurred in Holy Land four months\r\nbefore changed the whole current of his aspirations and desires. On\r\nJuly 7 the Saracens under Saladin had won a great victory at Hattin\r\nover the Latin king of Jerusalem, Guy of Lusignan, and captured not\r\nonly Guy himself, but also the most sacred relic in all Christendom,\r\nthe relic of the Holy Cross. This news arrived in France about the\r\nend of October or beginning of November.[261] It came to Richard’s\r\nears—so the story goes—one evening; his resolve was made at once\r\nand with his whole heart; early next morning he received the Cross\r\nfrom the hand of Archbishop Bartholomew.[262] When Henry, who seems\r\nto have been in Normandy, was informed of his son’s action, he\r\nappeared exceedingly perturbed, and for several days would scarcely\r\nsee anyone.[263] Not a word of comment on the matter, however,\r\npassed his lips till Richard rejoined him. Then, after a few days,\r\nhe said: “Thou shouldst by no means have undertaken so weighty a\r\nbusiness without consulting me. Nevertheless, I will not oppose thy\r\npious design, but will so further it that thou mayest fulfill it\r\nright well.”[264] Philip on the other hand was quick to seize the\r\nopportunity for bringing up again the matter of Gisors and Aloysia.\r\nThat Aloysia’s plighted bridegroom should betake himself to far-off\r\nHoly Land while that question was still unsettled was a thing not to\r\nbe tolerated; so Philip “gathered a great host” and threatened that\r\nhe would harry all the English king’s lands on the French side of\r\nthe sea unless either Gisors were surrendered or Richard married to\r\nAloysia without more ado. Henry, on hearing this, hurried back from\r\nthe Norman coast to the border for a meeting [Sidenote: 1188] with\r\nPhilip at Hilary-tide (1188).[265] Their conference was interrupted\r\nby the arrival of the Archbishop of Tyre, who had come to Europe to\r\nplead as only one who had personal knowledge of the state of affairs\r\nin Holy Land could plead, for a Crusade to check the advance of\r\nSaladin. Carried away by his appeal, both kings took the Cross[266]\r\nand separated to prepare for the enterprise on which they agreed to\r\nset out together at the next Easter twelvemonth; that is, Easter\r\n1190.[267]\r\n\r\nWhether Richard had been present at the conference does not appear;\r\nhe was, however, at Le Mans with his father a few days afterwards,\r\nwhen Henry issued the ordinance for the “Saladin tithe” to raise\r\nmoney for the Crusade.[268] The kings might require a delay of\r\nfifteen months to make their preparations; but the count of Poitou\r\nhad no mind to be so long detained from fulfilling his vow. He now\r\ncame to his father with two requests. First, he begged that the king\r\nwould either lend him money for his expedition on the security of the\r\ncounty of Poitou, or would give him leave to raise the needful sum\r\nby pledging that county to some safe and trustworthy man known to\r\nbe loyal to both father and son, and would confirm the transaction\r\nby a royal charter. Secondly, he prayed that “forasmuch as the\r\njourney that lay before him was long and perilous, lest aught should\r\nbe maliciously plotted to his disadvantage during such a lengthy\r\nabsence” he might be permitted to receive the fealty of the nobles\r\nof England and of Henry’s continental lands, “saving in all things\r\nthe fealty due to his father.” To the former of these requests\r\nHenry answered that his son should go to Palestine with him; they\r\nwould have in common all things needful for their journey, and\r\n“nought should separate them but death.” No answer could Richard\r\nget but this, which in regard to his second request was tantamount\r\nto a refusal.[269] Yet he had asked nothing beyond what was\r\nnatural and reasonable; nothing, indeed, beyond what he might have\r\nfairly expected to receive without needing to ask for it. A public\r\nconfirmation of the rights of King Henry’s eldest surviving son as\r\nheir to the crown of England and to the headship of the house of\r\nAnjou, such as would safeguard those rights until the son’s return\r\nfrom Holy Land in case the father should die before the Crusade was\r\nover, was a measure of obvious prudence not merely for the personal\r\ninterest of the heir but also for the security of the Angevin\r\ndominion as a whole. Henry’s obstinate silence when the measure was\r\nsuggested to him was one more indication that his sense of right\r\nand his care for the future of his house were both alike obscured\r\nby his infatuation for John. Richard understood it only too well,\r\nand “finding that he could get no other answer, he departed from his\r\nfather in heart as well as in body.”[270]\r\n\r\nNo considerations either of policy or of self-interest, however, had\r\nany influence on his resolve to fulfil his vow without delay. While\r\nhis father returned to England,[271] he hurried back to Poitou, sent\r\nmessengers to his brother-in-law, King William of Sicily, to expedite\r\narrangements for the equipment of the ships needful for his voyage,\r\nand busied himself with preparations for setting out in the coming\r\nsummer.[272] But his plans were checked by a new outbreak of revolt.\r\nGeoffrey of Lusignan, it is said, laid an ambush for one of Richard’s\r\nmost intimate friends and treacherously put him to death. Richard of\r\ncourse marched against Geoffrey, and punished him by taking several\r\nof his castles and slaughtering a number of his men, only those\r\nbeing spared who purchased their lives by taking the Cross.[273]\r\nGeoffrey’s outrage proved to be part of a concerted rising which ran\r\nwhat had now become the ordinary course of an Aquitanian revolt.\r\nThe rebels, headed as usual by Aimar of Angoulême and Geoffrey of\r\nRancogne, harried the domains of the count of Poitou, and the count\r\nretaliated by overrunning their lands, capturing and destroying\r\ntheir castles, burning and wasting their farms and orchards, till\r\nhe had once more subdued them to his will.[274] The leaders took\r\nrefuge in Taillebourg, and there they were surrounded by Richard’s\r\nforces. The damage inflicted by him on that famous stronghold in\r\n1179 had doubtless been long ago repaired; but this time the siege\r\nlasted only a few days, though the place was occupied by “more than\r\nseventy picked men of might.” They surrendered on the only condition\r\nwhich Richard would grant—that every one of them should join him\r\nin his Crusade.[275] This was an excellent practical expedient for\r\nincreasing the force which he hoped to lead to Palestine, and at the\r\nsame time withdrawing from Aquitaine the men who were most likely to\r\ncause a disturbance if left there during his absence.\r\n\r\nBut behind the revolt lay graver complications. It was rumoured\r\nthat King Henry, in the hope of compelling his son to abandon his\r\nproject, had not only stirred up Geoffrey of Lusignan and the other\r\nrebels and secretly furnished them with help and money, but had also\r\ninstigated Raymond of Toulouse to join them against Richard.[276]\r\nHowever this may be, Raymond did, while Richard was busy quelling the\r\nrevolt in Saintonge, capture “certain merchants from Richard’s land”\r\nwho were travelling through the land of Toulouse; some of them he\r\nimprisoned, some he blinded and mutilated, some he put to death.[277]\r\nOn hearing of this Richard, after again destroying the defences\r\nof Taillebourg,[278] marched into Gascony and there collected a\r\ngreat force of Brabantines with which he invaded the county of\r\nToulouse.[279] In a short time he took Moissac and several other\r\ncastles of Raymond’s, harried all the northern part of the county\r\nwith fire and sword,[280] and captured, among many other prisoners,\r\na certain intimate friend of Raymond’s, Peter Seilun, who had long\r\nbeen Richard’s enemy and is said to have instigated the imprisonment\r\nof the Poitevin merchants. Richard placed this man in close and harsh\r\nconfinement and refused all Raymond’s offers of ransom for him.\r\nRaymond now began a system of treacherous warfare against Richard,\r\nlaying ambushes for him and his soldiers, and setting men on the\r\nwatch, in towns and castles, to seize anybody who belonged to the\r\nfollowing of either Richard or Henry. By this means two knights of\r\nHenry’s household, who had been on pilgrimage to Compostella and\r\nfor some reason or other went round by Toulouse on their way home,\r\nwere captured and imprisoned. After a while Raymond let one of them\r\ngo—seemingly on parole—to Richard with a message that both should\r\nbe set free, if Richard would liberate Peter Seilun in exchange.\r\nRichard, however, on learning that they had been captured when\r\npilgrims, declared that “no prayers and no price” should make him\r\na party to such a transaction; “it would be an intolerable offence\r\nagainst God and His holy Apostle S. James, were he to give a ransom\r\nfor men whose character of pilgrims was in itself sufficient to\r\nentitle them to their freedom.”[281] Meanwhile Raymond had complained\r\nto Philip Augustus of Richard’s invasion of Toulouse, as being a\r\nbreach of the agreement made between the two kings when they took the\r\nCross, that no interference with each other’s lands should take place\r\ntill after the Crusade.[282] Philip appears to have gone “into those\r\nparts” in person, hoping to pacify the belligerents; and to him the\r\ncaptive knights, finding they could get no help from Richard, told\r\ntheir story. Philip seemingly regarded the matter in the same light\r\nas Richard; he bade Raymond release them “not for love of the king\r\nof England or of Count Richard, but out of love and reverence for S.\r\nJames.” Raymond, however, still insisted on the condition which he\r\nhad originally demanded. “Then the French king, seeing he could make\r\nno peace or agreement between the two counts, inflamed with wrath and\r\nmortal hatred against each other, returned to France.” He, however,\r\nso far took Raymond’s part as to send messengers over sea to Henry,\r\ncomplaining of Richard’s doings in Toulouse, and asking the English\r\nking to make amends for them; to which Henry merely answered “that it\r\nwas not by his counsel or desire that his son had done any of these\r\nthings, and that he could not justify him.”[283]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Henry’s real share—if indeed he had any real\r\nshare at all—in the origin of the quarrel, matters had by this time\r\nreached a pass at which his personal sympathies could hardly fail to\r\nbe on the side of his son. Richard had taken no less than seventeen\r\ncastles in the territory of Toulouse,[284] and was almost at the\r\ngates of its capital city—that famous city which both he and his\r\nfather had always longed to call their own, and of which he still\r\nconsidered himself the rightful owner as being through his mother the\r\nlegal representative of Count William IV—and was actually preparing\r\nto lay siege to it.[285] Both Raymond and Philip were so much alarmed\r\nthat Philip, at Raymond’s entreaty, sent envoys to the invader to\r\ntell him that if he would desist, “he should receive his rights and\r\nbe justly compensated for his wrongs in the Court of France.” The\r\nFrench king’s distrust of Henry’s attitude in the affair was shown by\r\nhis despatch at the same time of another mission, to the seneschals\r\nof Normandy and Anjou, warning them that they must either “recall\r\ncount Richard” at once, or consider themselves no longer protected\r\nby the truce between the two kings. Henry, no doubt urged by the\r\nterrified seneschals, sent to admonish his son; but his admonitions\r\nand Philip’s threats were alike unheeded.[286] To Henry, indeed,\r\nRichard’s answer was that “he had done no ill in the lands of the\r\ncount of S. Gilles except by leave of the king of France, forasmuch\r\nas the count refused to be in the truce and peace which the two kings\r\nhad made.”[287]\r\n\r\nThe king of France, however, was now gathering his host for an\r\ninvasion of the Angevin lands. Directing his attack against the\r\nunprotected north-eastern frontier of Aquitaine, after seizing some\r\nof the border castles of Touraine,[288] he advanced into Berry, and\r\nby the middle of June was master of its northern part as far as\r\nChâteauroux, which he captured on June 16.[289] On that day Henry,\r\nperplexed and terrified alike by what he heard of Philip’s doings and\r\nof Richard’s, despatched four envoys to the former “to entreat for\r\npeace in some form or other.”[290] If they ever reached the French\r\nking, their mission was fruitless; he continued his conquests till he\r\nwas master of everything that Henry possessed or claimed in Berry and\r\nAuvergne as far as Montluçon.[291]\r\n\r\nOn July 11 Henry returned to Normandy with an armed force of English\r\nand Welshmen, and at once summoned the Norman host to a muster at\r\nAlençon.[292] Richard meanwhile had abandoned his attack on the\r\nlesser foe to march against the greater one, and was advancing\r\nnorthward with fresh forces towards Berry. Philip, probably fearing\r\nto be caught between two fires, hereupon retired into France, leaving\r\nChâteauroux in the custody of William des Barres.[293] Richard, “by\r\nway of doing something,”[294] began to devise schemes for regaining\r\nthe place. One day some of its garrison who had been out on a\r\nforaging expedition found on their return the gate blocked by him and\r\nhis troops. They, however, cut their way through and stirred up their\r\ncomrades within the castle to make a sally in force. The Poitevins,\r\ntaken by surprise, were repulsed with heavy loss; the count himself\r\nwas in such danger that he fled for his life. Thrown from his horse,\r\nhe was rescued by a sturdy butcher,[295] and with the remnant of his\r\ntroops rejoined his father, seemingly somewhere in Touraine. The\r\ndefence of Henry’s frontiers was clearly the matter most in need\r\nof attention now; father and son accordingly led their combined\r\nforces back to the Norman border. At Trou, in the south-eastern\r\ncorner of Maine, they were all but overtaken by Philip “with a great\r\nhost”; they escaped, however, and the loss of forty knights and\r\nthe burning of Trou (which Philip fired because he could not take\r\nit[296]) were compensated by Richard’s capture of a neighbouring\r\nfortress, Les Roches, with its garrison of twenty-five knights and\r\nforty men-at-arms. This place was in the dominions of Count Burchard\r\nof Vendôme, who was an adherent of the king of France.[297] Philip\r\ndropped the pursuit, and on August 16 met Henry in conference at\r\nGisors, but they came to no agreement.[298] Among other proposals\r\nthere seems to have been one for a settlement of the disputes between\r\nthe two kings by a combat of four champions on either side. Four\r\nnames on the English (or Angevin) side were suggested to Henry by\r\nWilliam the Marshal; Richard was offended because his own name was\r\nnot among them. “You have done me grievous wrong; of all the men of\r\nmy father’s lands I was deemed one of the best to defend him; but you\r\ngive him to understand otherwise.” The Marshal protested that Richard\r\nmisinterpreted his motive: “You are our lord the king’s most direct\r\nheir; it would be an outrage and crime to risk your life in such a\r\nbusiness.” “It is true, Richard,” interposed Henry, “what he has said\r\nis but right”; and therewith it seems the whole project fell to the\r\nground.[299] At the end of the month Richard, hearing that Philip was\r\nat Mantes, proposed to attack that place. The expedition, however,\r\nresulted merely in a skirmish between Richard himself, Earl William\r\nde Mandeville, and some of Henry’s followers on the one side and a\r\nfew French knights on the other, in which William des Barres, who had\r\nbeen commandant of Châteauroux for Philip at the time of Richard’s\r\nrecent adventure there, was made prisoner by Richard, but broke his\r\nparole and escaped.[300] Next day Richard took leave of his father,\r\n“promising that he would serve him well and faithfully,” and set out\r\nagain for Berry.[301] What he did there we are not told; but he seems\r\nto have recovered at least one—Palluau—of the castles which Philip\r\nhad captured in the spring.[302]\r\n\r\nThe war languished partly because the counts of Flanders and Blois\r\nand some other chief nobles of France refused to fight against\r\nprinces who, like themselves, wore the Cross; and in October Philip\r\nasked Henry for another conference. It took place on October 7 at\r\nChâtillon, on the border of Touraine and Berry. A proposition that\r\nall conquests made by Philip from Henry and by Richard from Raymond\r\nof Toulouse since the beginning of the truce should be restored\r\ncame to nothing through Philip’s demand for a security which Henry\r\nwould not grant. Then, it seems, Richard offered to do what Philip\r\nhad in vain required of him a few months before—to go to the French\r\nking’s court and stand to its judgement on all that had taken place\r\nbetween himself and the count of S. Gilles, “in order that peace\r\nmight be made between his father and the king of France.”[303]\r\nThe action of the French magnates may have opened Richard’s eyes\r\nto the unseemliness of all this strife between fellow-soldiers of\r\nthe Cross and led him to see that peace, at almost any price, was\r\nabsolutely necessary for the purpose which he had most at heart, the\r\nfulfilment of his vow of Crusade. His proposal, however, “greatly\r\ndispleased” his father,[304] and Philip seems to have deemed the\r\nmoment a favourable one for seeking to impose upon Richard some other\r\nrequirements whose nature we are not told, but which led to “high\r\nand bad words” and finally resulted in the count of Poitou giving\r\nhis lord paramount the lie direct and calling him a “vile recreant,”\r\nwhereupon the conference broke up with a mutual defiance.[305] Philip\r\nwent into Berry, re-took Palluau, and proceeded to Châteauroux, but\r\nonly to withdraw the mercenaries whom he had left there and lead them\r\nback to Bourges, where he dismissed them.[306]\r\n\r\nFor military and political reasons alike Philip did not want to fight\r\nwith Richard. He knew that Richard would be compelled ere long to\r\nmake a friend of him, for nothing but his friendship could enable\r\nRichard to secure his rights as Henry’s heir; and Richard himself\r\nnow saw that until those rights were secured it was impossible for\r\nhim to venture on leaving Europe. He therefore resolved on bringing\r\nmatters to a crisis. At his suggestion the two kings arranged to\r\nmeet again on November 18 at Bonmoulins.[307] Meanwhile, as an\r\nEnglish writer says, he “was reconciled to” Philip—which probably\r\nmeans that he made, and Philip accepted, an apology for what had\r\noccurred at Châtillon—and “endeavoured to soften the mind of the\r\nFrench king, that in him he might find at least some solace if his\r\nown father should altogether fail him.”[308] Accordingly he had a\r\nprivate interview with Philip before the formal conference, and went\r\nto the place of meeting in his company, “for the sake,” so he told\r\nhis father, “of concord and peace.”[309] Philip opened the colloquy\r\nwith a proposal that all the results of the fighting since a certain\r\nevent—which is stated as “the taking of the Cross,” but seems to\r\nhave been really the agreement at Gisors on March 10, 1186—should be\r\nwiped out, he himself setting the example of restitution, “and after\r\nthis, all things should continue as they were before” the specified\r\ndate. This Richard opposed; “it seemed to him unmeet that he should\r\nby the acceptance of these terms be compelled to restore Cahors and\r\nits whole county, and many other places forming part of his domain,\r\nwhich were worth a thousand marks a year or more, in exchange for\r\nChâteauroux and Issoudun and Graçay which were not ducal domains,\r\nbut merely underfiefs.”[310] Philip’s proposal and Richard’s answer\r\nmay have been arranged between them beforehand, and may have been\r\nmerely intended to prepare the way for the introduction of the\r\ncrucial question which Richard was determined to bring, with Philip’s\r\nhelp, to a decisive issue once for all. He now asked his father for\r\nan explicit recognition, to be confirmed by an oath, of his rights\r\nas heir. Furthermore, as such a recognition would, so far as Henry’s\r\ncontinental territories were concerned, be ineffectual without\r\nPhilip’s sanction as overlord, and as it was now clearly understood\r\nthat Philip’s sanction depended on the marriage of Aloysia, her\r\nhitherto reluctant bridegroom at last made up his mind to the\r\nsacrifice and asked his father to give him at once the bride who was\r\nlawfully his, “and the kingdom”—that is, the assurance of succession\r\nto the Crown. In these requests he was supported by Philip.[311]\r\nHenry answered “that he would on no account do this in existing\r\ncircumstances, since he would appear to be acting under constraint\r\nrather than of his own free will.”[312] Richard persisted in his\r\nentreaties, but in vain. At last he exclaimed: “Now what I hitherto\r\ncould not believe looks to me like truth.” Ungirding his sword, he\r\nturned to the French king and, “imploring his aid that he might not\r\nbe deprived of his due rights,” did homage to him[313] as his “man”\r\nfor the whole continental dominions of the Angevin house and swore\r\nfealty to him against all men, saving Henry’s right of tenure for\r\nlife and the fidelity due from son to father.[314] Philip responded\r\nby promising that Châteauroux, Issoudun, and all the other castles,\r\nlands, and fiefs which he had taken from Henry in former wars should\r\nbe restored to Richard.[315] Henry was, it seems, too thunderstruck\r\nto say or do anything except consent without more ado to a truce with\r\nPhilip till S. Hilary’s day.[316]\r\n\r\n“Thus began the quarrel that never was fought out,”[317] says a\r\ncontemporary poet of the fateful conference at Bonmoulins. The\r\nmeeting had been held, according to custom, in the open air and in\r\npublic, the two kings and Richard, with the Archbishop of Reims,\r\nstanding in the middle of a wide and dense circle of their followers\r\nand other spectators. To some of these the symbolical action which\r\naccompanied homage must have been visible; and when the central\r\ngroup broke up and father, son, and lord paramount were seen to\r\nmove away, each in a different direction, “all men marvelled.”[318]\r\nRichard’s homage to Philip was an act of filial undutifulness, since\r\nit was done in opposition to the known wishes of his father; but it\r\ninvolved no further breach of duty, if he really intended—and there\r\nis nothing to show that he did not, at that time, intend—to abide\r\nby the saving clause which reserved his father’s rights. Fairly\r\ninterpreted with that clause, the homage would be merely prospective\r\nin its effect; and some prospective measure of this kind had been\r\nmade almost necessary as a matter of self-protection on Richard’s\r\npart, by the conduct of both Henry and Philip. We cannot tell\r\nprecisely to what it was that Richard alluded in the words which\r\nhe spoke immediately before the homage; but it can only have been\r\none, or both, of two things: the sinister rumours about Henry and\r\nAloysia, and the suggestion that Henry aimed at making John his heir\r\ninstead of Richard. As to the truth or falsehood of the former charge\r\nagainst Henry we have no means of judging; but of the truth of the\r\nlatter charge it is impossible to doubt. The anathema said to have\r\nbeen pronounced by the Legate Henry of Albano against Richard as a\r\ndisturber of the peace which the pope was anxious to secure for the\r\nfurtherance of the Crusade[319] might have fallen more justly upon\r\nRichard’s father; perhaps, too, not less justly upon their overlord.\r\n\r\nRichard had no sooner set out for Poitou than his father sent\r\nmessengers to recall him; but it was too late.[320] Either for the\r\nsame purpose, or to secure, if possible, some of the fortresses\r\nof Aquitaine,[321] Henry himself went as far south as Le Dorat\r\nin La Marche; there, however, he “did nothing”;[322] and indeed\r\nnothing could be done till the truce expired. It had been agreed\r\nat Bonmoulins that the two kings should [Sidenote: 1189] then, on\r\nJanuary 13 (1189) meet again to discuss terms for a lasting peace.\r\nWhen the time came, Henry on the plea of illness postponed the\r\nmeeting, first till Candlemas, and then till after Easter.[323] This\r\nwas too much for the patience of either Philip or Richard. Philip,\r\nit is said, had already promised that he would assist Richard in any\r\nattempt to gain possession of Henry’s continental dominions.[324]\r\nAccordingly, after the expiration of the truce he and Richard made\r\na joint raid across Henry’s borders.[325] Henry in alarm sent the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury to confer with Richard; but Richard had now\r\ncome to regard with distrust every messenger and every message from\r\nhis father, and curtly refused to give Baldwin an audience.[326] His\r\nconfidence in Philip was—justly enough—not much greater; when Henry\r\nsought to renew negotiations with France, his envoys found Richard’s\r\nchancellor, William of Longchamp, at the French king’s side, placed\r\nthere on purpose to prevent any betrayal by Philip of the interests\r\nof the count of Poitou; and William’s diplomacy proved more than a\r\nmatch for theirs.[327] After Easter the long delayed meeting of the\r\nkings took place at La Ferté-Bernard;[328] this was followed during\r\nthe next five or six weeks by several conferences between Henry and\r\nRichard, “but it was all lost labour.”[329] Another legate, John of\r\nAnagni, was now endeavouring to reconcile the kings,[330] and had\r\nsucceeded in obtaining from both of them an undertaking to stand\r\nto his judgement and that of four archbishops, two from Philip’s\r\nrealm and two from Henry’s.[331] Accordingly, in Whitsun week Henry,\r\nPhilip, Richard, the legate, and the four assistant arbitrators\r\nall met together near La Ferté-Bernard.[332] Philip set forth his\r\ndemands for himself and for Richard: that Aloysia should be given to\r\nRichard to wife, that some security should be granted to Richard for\r\nhis succession to the kingdom of England after his father’s death,\r\nand that John should take the Cross and join the Crusade;[333] if\r\nthese conditions were granted, Philip offered to restore all that\r\nhe had taken from Henry during the current year and the preceding\r\none.[334] Richard made the same demands in his own behalf, “saying\r\nthat he himself would in no wise go to Jerusalem unless John went\r\nwith him.”[335] The suspicion which had evidently prompted these\r\ndemands was amply justified by Henry’s reply. He “said that he would\r\nnever do this; but he offered, if the French king would consent,\r\nto give Aloysia with all the things aforesaid, more fully and\r\ncompletely than Philip asked”—not to Richard, but to John.[336] The\r\nwriter who reports this offer of Henry’s does not explicitly mention\r\nsecurity for Richard’s succession to the English Crown as one of the\r\nconditions demanded by Philip and Richard; he says they asked Henry\r\nto “cause the men of his lands to swear fealty to Richard.”[337] Even\r\nif the lands here meant were only the English king’s continental\r\nterritories, Henry in refusing to do any of the things asked of\r\nhim for Richard and proposing to do all and more than all of\r\nthem for John was clearly proposing nothing less than a complete\r\ndisinheritance, so far at least as those territories were concerned,\r\nof the elder brother in favour of the younger one. What Richard had\r\nsuspected and feared, what Philip had, to some extent at least, known\r\nto be in Henry’s mind ever since the truce of Châteauroux, if not\r\nearlier still, was thus confirmed by Henry’s own lips. Philip had\r\ndoubtless indirectly encouraged Henry in this insane project, so long\r\nas it suited his own interest to play off the father and the elder\r\nson one against the other; but he was far too practical to have ever\r\nintended giving it his serious support; and he now at once refused to\r\nsanction it.[338] He seems to have expected, reasonably enough, that\r\nthe legate would uphold him in his refusal; but instead of this, John\r\nof Anagni threatened to lay all France under Interdict if its king\r\ndid not come to a full agreement with the king of England. Philip\r\nretorted that he did not fear, and would not heed, a sentence without\r\nbasis in either equity or law, and that the legate had been bribed\r\nwith English gold. The meeting broke up in hopeless discord.[339]\r\n\r\nIf ever a father set at nought the precept “Provoke not your\r\nchildren to wrath,” Henry had done so by his conduct towards Richard,\r\nnot merely on one or two isolated occasions, but persistently through\r\na course of years. And if any circumstances are conceivable in which\r\na son might be, not indeed justified, but in some degree excused for\r\ntaking forcible measures against his father, in such a case Richard\r\nstood now. Neither he nor Philip could possibly acquiesce in the\r\nscheme which Henry had just proposed; and it was clear that Henry\r\nwould not be induced to renounce that scheme by any persuasion, nor\r\neven by intimidation unless it were something more than verbal. Both\r\nparties had come to the conference “with horses and arms,”[340]\r\nand the main body of Henry’s available forces was quartered in and\r\naround Le Mans. While he rode slowly back towards that city, Philip\r\nattacked the castle of La Ferté; its constable made a brave defence,\r\nbut was obliged to surrender. Philip then advanced to Ballon, which\r\nhe reached just after Henry had quitted it, and at once “took it, no\r\nman gainsaying him.”[341] In a few days most of the castles around\r\nLe Mans on the north and east—Bonnétable, Beaumont, Montfort—were\r\nlikewise occupied by his troops. But it was not to him that they had\r\nsurrendered. Richard was with him; and the castellans “all round\r\nabout” showed their disapproval of Henry’s scheme for altering the\r\nAngevin succession by voluntarily delivering up their castles to the\r\ncount of Poitou.[342]\r\n\r\nOn June 12 the allies surprised Le Mans; their troops forced an\r\nentrance into the lower town, the fire kindled to keep them out\r\nof the city set it ablaze, and Henry fled.[343] There was a hot\r\npursuit; Richard was among the foremost, but it seems that he had\r\ntaken no part in the assault, and now only wished to prevent by his\r\npresence any personal violence to his father, for he was clad only\r\nin a doublet and an iron headpiece and carried no arms at all. Some\r\nof his men, however, outstripped him, and before he could overtake\r\nthem were skirmishing with Henry’s rearguard, one of whom, William\r\ndes Roches, had just unhorsed a knight of Richard’s household when\r\nthe count came spurring up and shouted: “William! you waste time\r\nin folly; mend your speed, ride on!” At the sound of that voice\r\nanother of the little band covering the king’s retreat turned round\r\nand spurred his horse straight at Richard, and the heir of the\r\nAngevin empire suddenly found his life at the mercy of one who was\r\nalready known as the most accomplished warrior of his day, William\r\nthe Marshal. So close was the encounter that Richard caught hold of\r\nhis assailant’s lance and by sheer strength of arm turned it aside,\r\nshouting: “By God’s Feet, Marshal, slay me not! it were an ill deed,\r\nfor I am wholly unarmed.” But the thrust had not been meant for him,\r\nand its aim was only momentarily diverted. “Nay! may the devil slay\r\nyou, for so will not I,” answered the Marshal as he recovered control\r\nof his weapon and plunged it into the body of Richard’s horse.[344]\r\nThe animal instantly fell dead, dragging its rider with it to the\r\nground; knights and men-at-arms crowded anxiously to the spot, and\r\nwhen Richard had struggled to his feet he bade them proceed no\r\nfurther—“You have spoiled everything; you are a set of distracted\r\nfools!”[345]\r\n\r\nThree weeks later father and son met once more, and for the last\r\ntime. From Le Mans the allies moved eastward along the borders of\r\nMaine and the Vendômois, and thence into Touraine as far as Amboise;\r\ncastle after castle surrendering to them without resistance. Henry\r\nhad at first gone northward, but changed his course, and while they\r\nwere thus occupied he made his way back, with a very small escort,\r\nto Chinon.[346] Negotiations were resumed; but the French king now\r\nsaw his opportunity for an unparalleled display of his sovereign\r\nauthority as lord paramount, and he resolved to be satisfied with\r\nnothing less than a surrender of the whole continental possessions of\r\nthe Angevin house into his hands, to be restored or re-distributed at\r\nhis own pleasure.[347] On July 1 he laid siege to Tours; on July 3 he\r\ntook it by assault. Next day (July 4), at Colombières, Henry made the\r\nrequired surrender.[348] This done, Philip formally made him a new\r\ngrant of the surrendered lands and received his homage for them on\r\nnew conditions. One of these conditions was for the sole benefit of\r\nPhilip; it was a fine of twenty thousand marks to be paid to him by\r\nHenry. The others concerned Richard. One related to Aloysia; another\r\nbound Henry to make all his barons, insular and continental, swear\r\nfealty to his rightful heir. No baron or knight who in this war had\r\nwithdrawn from Henry’s service and joined Richard was to return to\r\nthe former within a month of Mid-Lent next, at which date the two\r\nkings and Richard were to set out all together on the Crusade. All\r\nHenry’s barons were to swear that if he broke his plighted word with\r\nregard to anything in the agreement they would support Philip and\r\nRichard against him; and it seems that Philip and Richard, while\r\nrestoring all their other conquests, were to retain either Tours, Le\r\nMans, and the castles of Château-du-Loir and Trou, or Gisors, Pacy,\r\nand Nonancourt, “until all the things above determined by the king of\r\nFrance should be fulfilled.”[349]\r\n\r\nThe meeting between the two kings at which this extraordinary\r\narrangement took place was held in the open air. So far as we can\r\ngather, Richard was either a silent spectator or was not actually\r\npresent, though he was certainly close at hand. After its conclusion\r\nhe went to his father’s lodging in the house of the Knights Templars\r\nat Ballan, hard by Colombières,[350] to receive, according to\r\nagreement, the kiss of peace. He did receive it, but as he turned\r\nto depart he heard his father mutter: “The Lord grant that I may\r\nnot die till I have had my revenge of thee!”[351] The words were\r\nthe half delirious utterance of a sick man whose brain was on fire\r\nwith fever and, still more, with shame at the public degradation\r\nhe had just gone through, and with disappointment at the failure\r\nof his most cherished scheme; although the worst detail connected\r\nwith that failure did not become known to him till some hours later,\r\nwhen he received the list of the followers who had deserted him.\r\nThen he learned that John had anticipated the issue of the struggle\r\nand secured for himself the protection of the party whose success\r\nhe saw to be a foregone conclusion, by pledging his allegiance to\r\nRichard.[352]\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Philip Augustus was for the moment complete. He had\r\nsuccessfully asserted and exercised his sovereign authority over the\r\ngreatest of his vassals, the vassal who was, no less than himself,\r\na crowned and anointed king, and whose lands comprised, besides\r\nthe island realm, more than two-thirds of the realm of France. The\r\nsuccession to all those lands, including England, had been, or seemed\r\nto have been, determined at Philip’s bidding. He was, or seemed\r\nto be, master of both Henry and Richard. But his triumph was only\r\nmomentary. Within three days the convention of Colombières was a mere\r\npiece of waste parchment, for Henry of England was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nRICHARD’S CRUSADE\r\n\r\n1189-1192\r\n\r\n  Ma fu di pensier nostri ultimo segno\r\n  Espugnar de Sion le nobil mura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE YEAR OF PREPARATION\r\n\r\n1189-1190\r\n\r\n  Surgite, et ascendamus in Sion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of Philip and Richard had been at Tours since\r\ntheir capture of that city on July 3;[353] it was probably there\r\nthat Richard received, from a messenger despatched by William the\r\nMarshal,[354] the tidings of his father’s death at Chinon on the 6th\r\nand the intended burial at Fontevraud. The night-watch round the\r\nopen coffin was beginning in the great abbey church when he reached\r\nit next evening.[355] All endeavours to guess at his feelings were\r\nbaffled by the rigid stillness of his aspect and demeanour,[356]\r\nbroken only by a momentary shudder when he saw the uncovered\r\nface.[357] For a long while he stood gazing at it in silence;[358]\r\nfor a briefer space he knelt in silent prayer.[359] When at last he\r\nspoke, it was to call for two of his father’s most loyal adherents,\r\nWilliam the Marshal and Maurice of [Sidenote: 1189 _July 7_] Craon.\r\nThey came forward, and at his command, followed him, with some\r\nothers, out of the church. “So, fair Sir Marshal,” he began, “you\r\nwere minded to slay me the other day! and slain I should have been of\r\na surety had I not turned your lance aside by the strength of my arm.\r\nThat would have been a bad day’s work!” The Marshal answered that his\r\nown strength of arm was great enough to drive a lance-thrust home to\r\nits aim in spite of interference, and the issue of the encounter was\r\nsufficient proof that he had sought only the life of the horse, not\r\nthe rider. “Marshal, I will bear you no malice; you are forgiven,”\r\nwas Richard’s reply.[360] The burial took place next morning.\r\n[Sidenote: _July 8_] As soon as it was over Richard despatched\r\nthe Marshal and another envoy[361] to England with orders for the\r\nrelease of his mother, and with a commission to her authorizing\r\nher to act as his representative until he could himself go over\r\nsea.[362] His choice of the Marshal for this errand was an indication\r\nof the spirit in which he took up the rights and duties of his new\r\nposition. He showed himself gracious to all persons who had been\r\nfaithful to Henry, and expressed his intention of confirming them\r\nin their several offices and rewarding their fidelity to the late\r\nking. He was asked to ratify a number of grants which Geoffrey the\r\nchancellor assured him Henry had recently made or promised to make,\r\nand he consented in every case save one, a grant of Châteauroux and\r\nits heiress to Baldwin of Béthune, which he said must be cancelled\r\nbecause he had himself, as duke of Aquitaine, granted the damsel\r\nand her fief to Andrew of Chauvigny; but he promised to compensate\r\nBaldwin.[363] One man only who had held high office under Henry\r\nfell under Richard’s displeasure: Stephen the seneschal of Anjou,\r\nwho was not only deprived of the castles and the royal treasury\r\nwhich he had in custody for the late king, but was also chained\r\nhand and foot and put in prison. The cause of Stephen’s disgrace\r\nis unknown; his previous history is obscure;[364] but the disgrace\r\nwas only temporary; within a few months he was once more free, and\r\nreinstated in the king’s confidence and favour. On the other hand,\r\nwhen three of the men who had deserted Henry and transferred their\r\nallegiance to Richard asked for restitution of their lands of which\r\nHenry had disseised them, Richard gave it, but disseised them again\r\nimmediately, “saying that such was the due reward of traitors who\r\nin time of need forsake their lords and help others against them”;\r\nand he treated with coldness and aversion all, save one, who had\r\nthus acted. The exception was John, who when he presented himself\r\nbefore his brother was “received with honour”[365] and “kindly\r\ncomforted.”[366]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _July 8-20_]\r\n\r\nRichard next proceeded into Normandy. At Séez the archbishops\r\nof Rouen and Canterbury met him, and (acting doubtless under a\r\ncommission from the legate) absolved him from excommunication.[367]\r\nOn July 20 he received the ducal sword and banner of Normandy at\r\nthe high altar of Rouen cathedral, and immediately afterwards\r\nthe fealty of the Norman clergy and people.[368] He then went\r\nto Gisors for a conference with the king of France. The French\r\nhistoriographer-royal notes that as “the count of Poitou” set foot\r\nin the great border-fortress about which he and his father had\r\nwrangled so long with Philip, fire broke out within it, and that next\r\nday as he rode forth the wooden bridge broke down under him and he\r\nand his horse fell into [Sidenote: _July 22_] the ditch.[369] The\r\nconference took place on the 22nd, between Chaumont and Trie.[370]\r\nPhilip began by renewing his original claim to Gisors, but waived\r\nit on receiving an intimation that Richard still purposed to marry\r\nAloysia.[371] The French king seems to have further claimed a large\r\nshare of the castles and towns which he had taken from Henry,\r\nincluding Châteauroux, Le Mans, and Tours. Submission to such a\r\ndemand would unquestionably have brought upon Richard, as an English\r\nchronicler says, “shame and everlasting contempt”; indeed, he would\r\nhave been within his feudal right in refusing it entirely, on the\r\nground that no forfeiture on his father’s part could invalidate the\r\ngrant of all these fiefs which had been made to himself by Philip\r\nin November 1188. He consented, however, to resign once for all his\r\nrights in Auvergne, and two little fiefs in Aquitanian Berry that lay\r\nclose to the French Royal Domain—Graçay and Issoudun; and he bought\r\noff Philip’s other demands by a promise of four thousand marks in\r\naddition to the twenty thousand due from Henry under the convention\r\nof Colombières.[372] These terms Philip accepted. Richard renewed\r\nhis homage to his overlord, and they agreed to set out on the Crusade\r\ntogether in Lent of the next year.[373]\r\n\r\nFor three weeks longer Richard stayed in Normandy, winning all\r\nhearts by his gracious and affable demeanour.[374] [Sidenote: _Aug.\r\n12_] On August 12 he went to England.[375] Landing at Southampton\r\nor Portsmouth,[376] he was received two or three days later with a\r\nsolemn procession at Winchester by his mother and the chief nobles\r\nand prelates of the land.[377] As the archbishop of Canterbury had\r\npreviously returned from Normandy,[378] the coronation might have\r\ntaken place immediately, had the new king desired it. But, unlike\r\nevery other king of England since the Norman conquest, Richard was\r\nin no haste to be crowned. There was no need for haste; he had no\r\nrival; he had, in England, no enemies; and he had made for himself a\r\nhost of friends by a proclamation which during the last five weeks\r\n“honourable men” sent out by Eleanor according to instructions from\r\nhim had been publishing and carrying into effect in every county.\r\nAll persons under arrest for offences against Forest Law were to be\r\ndischarged; those who were outlawed for a like cause were permitted\r\nto return in peace. Other persons imprisoned “by the will of the\r\nking or his justiciar,” not “by the common law of their county or\r\nhundred, or on appeal,” were also to be discharged. Persons outlawed\r\n“by common law without appeal by the justices” were to be re-admitted\r\nto peace provided they could find sureties that they would come up\r\nfor trial if required; prisoners detained on appeal for any shameful\r\ncause were to be released on the same terms. All persons detained\r\n“on appeal by those who acknowledged themselves to be malefactors”\r\nwere to be set free unconditionally. Malefactors to whom “life and\r\nlimbs” had been granted as approvers were to abjure and depart\r\nfrom the king’s land; those who without the concession of life and\r\nlimbs had of their own free will accused others were to be kept in\r\ncustody till further counsel should be taken. The ordinance concluded\r\nby requiring every free man of the realm to swear fealty and liege\r\nhomage to the new lord of England, “and that they will submit to his\r\njurisdiction and lend him their aid for the maintenance of his peace\r\nand justice in all things.”[379] We cannot ascertain how far Richard\r\nwas justified in the insinuation conveyed in this ordinance, that the\r\nadministration of criminal law in Henry’s latter days had been marked\r\nnot only by undue severity, but also by arbitrary interference on the\r\npart of the Crown or its officers with the rights and liberties of\r\nEnglishmen. The most philosophic historian of the time, William of\r\nNewburgh, evidently thought that however Henry might have erred on\r\nthe side of rigour, Richard at the outset of his reign erred no less\r\nin the opposite direction. “At that time,” says William, “the gaols\r\nwere crowded with criminals awaiting trial or punishment, but through\r\nRichard’s clemency these pests came forth from prison, perhaps to\r\nbecome bolder thieves in the future.”[380] But the people in general\r\nwere delighted to welcome a ruler who seemed to them bent upon\r\noutdoing all that was good and undoing all that they considered evil\r\nin the government of his predecessor.[381]\r\n\r\nFrom Winchester Richard was moving on by leisurely stages towards\r\nLondon when a report of a Welsh raid made him suddenly turn towards\r\nthe border, with the intention of punishing the raiders; but Eleanor,\r\nwho perhaps better understood the danger of plunging unnecessarily\r\nand unwarily into a Welsh war, called him [Sidenote: _Sept. 1, 2_]\r\nback, and as usual he obeyed her.[382] On September 1 or 2 he was\r\nwelcomed with a great procession in London;[383] on the 3rd he was\r\ncrowned at Westminster.[384] Three contemporary writers, one of whom\r\nactually assisted in the most [Sidenote: _Sept. 3_] sacred detail\r\nof the ceremony,[385] tell us how at its outset Duke Richard was\r\n“solemnly and duly” elected by clergy and people; how he took the\r\nthreefold oath, to maintain the peace of the Church, to suppress\r\ninjustice, and to promote equity and mercy.[386] After receiving the\r\nthreefold anointing and being clothed with the symbolical vestments\r\nof the kingly office, he was adjured by the Primate not to assume\r\nit unless he were fully minded to keep his vow; he answered that by\r\nGod’s help he did intend so to do. He then took the crown from the\r\naltar and handed it to the archbishop, and the archbishop set it on\r\nhis head.[387] Richard’s coronation is in one way the most memorable\r\nin all English history, for it is the occasion on which the form and\r\nmanner of crowning a king of England were, in every essential point\r\nand in most of the lesser particulars, fixed for all after-time.\r\n\r\nThe court festivities lasted three days,[388] and the manner in\r\nwhich they were conducted presented a marked contrast to the\r\nrough, careless, unceremonious ways of the court of Henry II. The\r\nbanquet each day was as stately and decorous as it was lavish and\r\nsplendid. Clergy and laity were seated apart, and the former had the\r\nplace of honour, being at the king’s own table.[389] Richard had\r\nfurther emphasized the solemnity of the occasion by a proclamation\r\nordering that no Jew and no woman should be admitted to the palace.\r\nNotwithstanding this, certain Jews did present themselves at the\r\ndoors on the evening of the coronation-day with gifts for the king.\r\nThe courtiers of lower rank and the people who crowded round robbed\r\nthem, beat them, and drove them away; some were mortally injured,\r\nsome slain on the spot.[390] The tumult reached the ears of the king\r\nin the banqueting-hall, and he sent the justiciar and some of the\r\nnobles to suppress it; but it was already beyond their control.[391]\r\nA great wave of anti-Jewish feeling swept through the city; before\r\nmorning most of the Jews’ houses were sacked; and the number of\r\npersons concerned in the riot was so large and public feeling so\r\nstrongly on their side that although some of them were arrested by\r\nRichard’s orders and brought before him, he found it impossible to do\r\njustice in the matter,[392] and only ventured to send three men to\r\nthe gallows—one who in the confusion had robbed a Christian, and two\r\nwho had kindled a fire which burned down a Christian’s house.[393]\r\nFor the rest he had to “condone what he could not avenge.”[394] He\r\ntried, however, to prevent further disturbances of the same kind by\r\nsending into every shire letters commanding that the Jews should be\r\nleft in peace and no one should do them wrong;[395] and so long as he\r\nremained in England these orders were obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe new king had now to make provision for his Crusade, and for the\r\ncarrying on of the government of England after his departure. There\r\nwas no reason to anticipate any difficulty in the latter half of\r\nhis task; but the other half of it presented a very serious cause\r\nfor anxiety—the want of money. The Angevin treasury was empty;[396]\r\nthe ducal revenues of Normandy and Aquitaine were not large enough,\r\nat the best of times, to furnish more than a very insignificant\r\nsurplus for purposes external to the two duchies. Richard’s first\r\nact on reaching Winchester had been to cause an exact account to\r\nbe taken of the contents of the royal treasury.[397] We have no\r\ntrustworthy statement of the result;[398] but it evidently proved\r\nquite inadequate to supply his needs. The twenty-four thousand\r\nmarks due to Philip, the cost of equipping and maintaining his own\r\nfollowers and of fitting out a transport fleet, were only a part\r\nof those needs; there was another part which from Richard’s point\r\nof view was incalculable and almost unlimited. A great effort for\r\nthe deliverance of Holy Land had been in contemplation throughout\r\nwestern Europe for nearly five years; the form in which it had been\r\noriginally projected was that of an expedition to be led by the\r\nAngevin king of England as head of the elder branch of the royal\r\nhouse of Jerusalem, and composed chiefly of his subjects, although\r\nsince then circumstances had so altered and the scheme had so widened\r\nout and developed that he was now only one of several monarchs who\r\nwere to lead their respective contingents as portions of one great\r\narmy. From 1184 onwards crowds of Englishmen of all ranks had taken\r\nthe Cross; most of them—very likely including the English-born\r\ncount of Poitou—without counting the cost, in any sense of that\r\nword. Theoretically, the undertaking being not a national but a\r\npersonal and voluntary one, each Crusader was responsible for his own\r\nequipment and expenses and those of his tenants or other followers.\r\nThe king, however, seems to have at once recognized that if the\r\nEnglish (or Angevin) contingent was to take such a share in the\r\nHoly War as befitted its leader’s rank among the sovereigns and his\r\nkingdom’s rank among the powers of Christendom, he must carry with\r\nhim a large reserve fund for the maintenance of the whole force under\r\nhis command in a state of efficiency on a service of which no one\r\ncould forecast the requirements, the difficulties, or the duration.\r\nAs we read the after-story, indeed, we are almost led to credit him\r\nwith a presentiment that his war-chest was destined to become the\r\nwar-chest of the whole crusading host. At any rate, his most pressing\r\nanxiety was to fill the chest, and—since he expected to leave Europe\r\nin the spring—to fill it as quickly as possible. He might impose a\r\nspecial tax, or more than one; a tallage, or “donum,” or both at\r\nonce. But these would take many months to collect, and would bring\r\nin, probably, scarcely enough to be worth collecting, from his point\r\nof view; while his subjects, who were, or considered themselves,\r\nalready hard pressed by the financial administration of Henry, would\r\nhave felt or at least resented such taxes as an additional and\r\noppressive burden. Richard adopted quicker and easier methods.\r\n\r\nAmong the crowds who had taken the Cross in a moment of enthusiasm\r\nthere were many whose zeal had cooled during the months or years of\r\nwaiting, and who would now gladly be relieved of the obligation to\r\nfulfil their vow. There was also among them a much larger number\r\nof officers of the English court and government, and of other men\r\nbelonging to the classes from which such officers were usually\r\ntaken, than could well be spared from the work of administration at\r\nhome. Accordingly, Richard had asked and obtained from Pope Clement\r\nletters patent granting release from their vow to all persons whom\r\nthe king should appoint to take part in the safe-keeping of the realm\r\nduring his absence.[399] Naturally such release was conditional on\r\ncompensation being made to the crusading cause by all who were thus\r\ntransferred from the service of the Cross to that of the Crown,\r\nsince they had taken the former upon themselves and the latter was\r\nnot compulsory; and this compensation necessarily took the form of\r\nthe payment to the king of a sum which could only be fixed in each\r\ncase by a bargain between him and the payer. From this it was not a\r\ndifficult step for the king to make similar bargains with men who had\r\nnot taken the Cross, but were suitable for and ambitious of office\r\nin England, and able to pay for it. Neither the sale of public\r\noffices nor the yet more general practice of requiring payment for\r\nroyal grants of land, privileges, and benefits of any kind—including\r\nconfirmations by a new king of grants made by his predecessors—was\r\ncondemned, in principle at least, by the ordinary code of political\r\nmorality in Richard’s day. He might fairly argue that men who\r\ndesired any of these things, and had means to pay for them, ought\r\nto be made to contribute as largely as possible to the Treasury for\r\nthe furtherance of the Crusade; and he accordingly set himself to\r\ndrain, as it seemed, to the uttermost all these sources of revenue.\r\n“He deposed from their bailiwicks nearly all the sheriffs and their\r\ndeputies, and held them to ransom to the uttermost farthing. Those\r\nwho could not pay were imprisoned.”[400] He “induced many persons to\r\nvie with each other in spending money to purchase dignities or public\r\noffices, or even royal manors.”[401] “All who were overburdened\r\nwith money the king promptly relieved of it, giving them powers and\r\npossessions at their choice.”[402] “Whosoever would, bought of the\r\nking his own rights as well as those of other men.” “All things were\r\nfor sale with him—powers, lordships, earldoms, sheriffdoms, castles,\r\ntowns, manors, and suchlike”;[403] or as Roger of Howden sums it all\r\nup, “the king put up to sale everything that he had.”[404]\r\n\r\nThe part of these proceedings which chiefly perturbed Richard’s\r\ncounsellors, it seems, was his reckless alienation of Crown demesne;\r\nin his passionate eagerness to pile up treasure for the Crusade he\r\nwas, they considered, stripping himself of his proper means of living\r\nas a king should live at home; it was as if he did not intend, or did\r\nnot expect, ever to come home again at all; and when some of them\r\nventured on a remonstrance he answered, “I would sell London if I\r\ncould find a buyer for it.”[405] He was in fact in a mood to, almost\r\nliterally, sell all that he had and give it to the Crusade. The means\r\nwhich he employed to raise money undoubtedly served their purpose;\r\nand they seem to have neither provoked any general discontent nor\r\ninflicted any hardship on the people, or even upon more than a\r\nvery few individuals. The chronicler who speaks of a wholesale\r\n“deposition” and “ransoming” of the sheriffs has considerably\r\nexaggerated the king’s treatment of those officers. In the first\r\nplace, all sheriffs were always liable to be “deposed” at any moment,\r\nsince they were always appointed to hold their office “during the\r\nking’s pleasure.” At Richard’s accession there were in England\r\ntwenty-eight sheriffs; two of these had each three counties under his\r\ncharge, seven had two counties each. When Richard’s redistribution\r\nof offices was completed, six shires were by a special grant to John\r\nwithdrawn from the royal administration altogether; seven or eight\r\nshires remained or were replaced under their former sheriffs; five\r\nsheriffs were transferred to shires other than those which they had\r\npreviously administered; four—perhaps more—went on the Crusade; all\r\nthe rest seem to have been employed in some other capacity under the\r\nCrown. In all likelihood most, if not all, of these men had taken the\r\nCross and their “ransom” was no more than they were justly bound and\r\ncould well afford to pay. One case does indeed present a different\r\naspect. Ranulf de Glanville, at this time sheriff of Yorkshire and\r\nWestmorland, was also, and had been for nine years, Chief Justiciar\r\nof England. He had taken the Cross in 1185.[406] One chronicler\r\nasserts that Ranulf was now “stripped of his power,” put in ward, and\r\nset free only on payment of fifteen thousand pounds to the king.[407]\r\nAccording to other authorities, however, he asked to be relieved of\r\nhis functions that he might fulfil his vow.[408] He is said to have\r\nhad also another motive for his resignation: “he was of great age,\r\nand saw that the new king, being a novice in government, was wont\r\nto do many things without due deliberation and forethought.”[409]\r\nBehind these words there may lurk a partial explanation of Richard’s\r\nseemingly harsh and extortionate treatment of the Justiciar. It is\r\npossible that the king really wished to retain Ranulf’s services\r\nas his vicegerent in England, and persuaded or coerced him into\r\ncommuting his vow for that purpose, but that Ranulf, when he had\r\nseen a little more of his new sovereign’s ways—which were indeed not\r\nlikely to meet with the approval of statesmen who had grown old under\r\nHenry II—preferred to sacrifice the money as the price of Richard’s\r\nconsent to his departure. That the sacrifice was, after all, not a\r\nruinous one may be inferred from the fact that it left him still able\r\nto make his expedition independently of the king, for he died at\r\nAcre seven months or more before Richard’s arrival there.[410] Two\r\nChief Justiciars were appointed in his stead, of whom one, William de\r\nMandeville, was a trusted and faithful friend of King Henry, and the\r\nother, Bishop Hugh of Durham, was a kinsman of the royal house and\r\na man of long experience in politics, untiring energy and ambition,\r\nand great wealth, with the surplus of which he was quite willing to\r\npurchase release from his vow of Crusade and as many other benefits\r\nas Richard cared to bestow on him.[411]\r\n\r\nSeveral other high offices, both in Church and State, had to be\r\nfilled anew, some from causes altogether beyond the king’s control,\r\nsome in fulfilment of his promise to carry into effect the grants\r\nwhich his father had left uncompleted. There were five vacant\r\nbishoprics, besides the metropolitan see of York. This last Henry had\r\ndestined for his son Geoffrey the Chancellor; to Geoffrey Richard\r\ngave it,[412] and thereby the chancellorship was vacated. Two men\r\nvied with each other as candidates for this important post; both\r\noffered large sums for it; Richard in this instance showed that his\r\nchoice of men was not governed by his thirst for money, by accepting\r\nthe lower bid of the two, because it was made by a man whom he knew\r\nand trusted;[413] and the person who received the largest share\r\nof grants out of the royal domain received them absolutely free.\r\nThat person was John. Henry had (or was said to have) expressed the\r\nintention of endowing John with the Norman county of Mortain and four\r\nthousand pounds’ worth of land in England. As soon as Richard was\r\nby investiture as duke of Normandy legally able to make grants in\r\nthat duchy, he put John in possession of Mortain.[414] The heritage\r\nof the late Earl of Gloucester had been promised, with the hand\r\nof his heiress, to John ever since 1176; Richard [Sidenote: _Aug.\r\n29_] secured it for him by causing the marriage to take place a\r\nfortnight after the brothers reached England.[415] Within the next\r\nmonth the king further bestowed upon John a number of escheated\r\nhonours and other lands to the gross annual value of some five or six\r\nhundred pounds. Within three more months he added the gift of six\r\nwhole counties, with the entire revenues and profits of every kind\r\nwhich they were wont to render to the Crown, and the control of all\r\nadministration and justice within their limits.[416]\r\n\r\nOf all Richard’s administrative arrangements this was unquestionably\r\nthe most imprudent and dangerous; it is indeed almost the only one\r\nwhich can be clearly seen to have produced disastrous results. When\r\nits motive is realized, however, criticism is almost disarmed; for\r\nRichard’s act was not the spontaneous throwing away of an extravagant\r\nfraternal benefaction, or of a wholly needless bribe to a brother to\r\nwhom he owed nothing and from whom, had he let him remain “Lackland,”\r\nhe could have had nothing to fear. It was simply a literal and exact\r\nfulfilment of Henry’s latest design for completing his provision\r\nfor John by endowing him with lands in England to the value of four\r\nthousand pounds a year.[417] This ill-advised project of Henry’s\r\nmight perhaps have been less unwisely carried out in some other\r\nway, such as the bestowal of a number of small estates scattered\r\nin various parts of the realm, instead of this solid block of\r\nterritories with so much political influence and power attached to\r\ntheir possession; but the only safe mode of dealing with it would\r\nhave been to ignore it altogether. Richard’s share of responsibility\r\nin the matter amounts simply to this, that he—in his father’s\r\nlifetime a disobedient son—carried loyalty to his dead father’s\r\nwishes beyond the limits of worldly wisdom and sound policy.\r\n\r\nSome of Richard’s administrative arrangements and appointments\r\nwere made in a great council held in the middle of September at\r\nPipewell[418] in Northamptonshire, others at various times within the\r\nnext three months. Early in October the king spent a week in London;\r\nthence he went to Arundel and afterwards to Winchester.[419] He had\r\nmeanwhile sent John with an armed force—which the Welsh called “the\r\nhost of all England”—against Rees of South Wales, who had laid siege\r\nto Caermarthen castle. It was to John’s interest that there should\r\nbe peace with Rees, since the honour of Gloucester included a large\r\npiece of Welsh territory. Accordingly John and Rees made an agreement\r\nbetween themselves,[420] and Rees, with an escort furnished him by\r\nJohn, came to Oxford in the hope of a meeting with the king; but\r\nRichard “would not go to meet him.”[421] For Richard the chief gain\r\nfrom this expedition against Rees was that it enabled him to collect\r\nfrom those tenants in chivalry who did not personally take part in it\r\na “Scutage of Wales” which helped to finance the expedition to Holy\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nEarly in November envoys from France brought letters from Philip\r\nsetting forth that he and his barons had sworn on the Gospels to\r\nbe at Vézelay ready to start on the Crusade at the close of Easter\r\n(April 1, 1190), and begging that Richard would take an oath to the\r\nsame effect. Richard exacted from the envoys an oath “on the King of\r\nFrance’s soul” that this pledge should be fulfilled on the French\r\nside; then he called a great council in London and there caused\r\none of his chief counsellors to take a like oath on his behalf\r\nin presence of the Frenchmen.[422] After this the king went on\r\npilgrimage to S. Edmund’s on the festival of its patron saint.[423]\r\nSoon afterwards he was at Canterbury,[424] making peace between the\r\narchbishop and the monks, who had long been at strife.[425] The\r\nsettlement was destined to be only temporary, but for the moment it\r\nwas a triumph both of Richard’s kingly power and of his personal\r\ntact; the dispute had been a scandal which had baffled Henry II,\r\nand a legate sent by the Pope to deal with it had landed at Dover\r\non November 20 (when Richard was at S. Edmund’s), but had been by\r\nEleanor’s order forbidden to proceed inland, his mission having\r\nno sanction from the king.[426] Richard, however, wanted to make\r\nuse of him for two other purposes: the confirmation of Geoffrey’s\r\nelection to the see of York, and the raising of an Interdict laid by\r\nArchbishop Baldwin on John’s lands in consequence of the marriage of\r\nJohn and Isabel of Gloucester, who were cousins within the prohibited\r\ndegrees. Accordingly the legate was entertained at Canterbury for two\r\nnights; he did what the king desired of him and then departed out of\r\nthe realm.[427]\r\n\r\nA weightier matter was settled in that same council at Canterbury.\r\nShortly after the accession of Henry II to the English crown the\r\nScot king Malcolm had done homage to him “in the same manner as his\r\ngrandfather had been the man of King Henry the First.”[428] What were\r\nthe precise grounds and conditions of the homage due to the sovereign\r\nof England from the rulers of the composite realm which was generally\r\nknown as Scotland, but would have been more correctly termed North\r\nBritain—whether that homage was due for the whole realm, consisting\r\nof the Highlands (or “Scotland” properly so called), the Lowlands,\r\nand Galloway, as well as for the lands which the Scot kings held in\r\nEngland, or only for the last three, or even for the English lands\r\nalone—was a question which both parties had for many generations\r\nfound it prudent to evade by the use of some such formula as the\r\none adopted in 1157. But in 1175 Malcolm’s brother and successor,\r\nWilliam the Lion, having invaded England and been made prisoner,\r\npurchased his release by definitely becoming Henry’s liegeman “for\r\nScotland and all his other lands,” promising that all his barons\r\nshould likewise do liege homage to Henry, and that his own heirs and\r\nthe heirs of his barons should do the same to Henry’s successors,\r\nand giving up to the English king the castles of Roxburgh, Berwick,\r\nJedburgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling, with an annual payment from the\r\nScottish Crown revenue for their maintenance.[429] Edinburgh was\r\ngiven back to William in 1186 to form part of the dower of his wife,\r\nHenry’s cousin Ermengard of Beaumont.[430] In the summer of 1188 some\r\nabortive negotiations concerning the restoration of the other castles\r\nto the Scot king took place between him and Henry. According to one\r\naccount, Henry attempted to levy the Saladin tithe for the Crusade in\r\nScotland as well as in his own dominions; William refused to permit\r\nthis, but offered to give five thousand marks instead of the tithe\r\nif his castles were restored to him; this, however, Henry “would not\r\ndo.”[431] Another version of the story is that William spontaneously\r\nbegan negotiations by offering four thousand marks for the castles;\r\nthat Henry answered “the thing should be done if William would give\r\na tithe of his land” for the Crusade and that the Scot king was\r\nwilling to do this if he could obtain the consent of his barons, but\r\nthey refused emphatically, so the project came to nothing.[432] It\r\nis not likely that Henry imagined himself to have by the settlement\r\nmade in 1175 finally disposed of the question about the homage. A\r\nsettlement which had been forced upon William the Lion when he was\r\npowerless in the English king’s hands could not possibly be final on\r\nsuch a matter; he, or the Scot kings after him, would be certain to\r\nrepudiate it at the first opportunity; and the opportunity came in\r\nautumn 1189 when he was summoned to the English court to do homage\r\nto Henry’s successor. It was imperatively necessary for Richard to\r\nsecure William’s homage before setting out on the Crusade. To go\r\nwithout having done so would have been to leave northern England\r\nwithout any safeguard against invasion and ravage during his absence.\r\nHe himself had neither time nor means to spare for an expedition\r\nagainst Scotland. Had William chosen to delay indefinitely—as more\r\nthan one of his predecessors had done—his appearance at the English\r\ncourt, he could easily, and probably with impunity, have put Richard\r\nin a very awkward position. Most likely he would have done so but for\r\nRichard’s tact in turning the difficulty. Overlord and vassal agreed\r\nupon a bargain which was in all likelihood more profitable to both\r\nparties than the one proposed a year before could ever have been to\r\neither of them. William covenanted to give Richard a lump sum of ten\r\nthousand marks;[433] Richard quit-claimed “all customs and agreements\r\nwhich King Henry extorted from William by reason of his capture,\r\nso that he shall fully and completely do to us what his brother\r\nMalcolm King of Scots rightly did to our predecessors and what he\r\nought rightly to do”; he renounced the liege homage of William’s\r\nmen and restored all the charters given to Henry by William when he\r\nwas Henry’s prisoner; and he undertook to do to William “whatsoever\r\nour predecessors rightly did and ought to have done to Malcolm\r\naccording to a recognition to be made by four English nobles chosen\r\nby [Sidenote: _Dec. 5_] William and four Scottish nobles chosen by\r\nourself”; to make good any encroachments which had taken place on the\r\nScottish Marches since William’s capture; to confirm any grants made\r\nto William by Henry; and finally, that William and his heirs for ever\r\nshould possess his English lands as fully and freely as Malcolm had\r\npossessed or ought to have possessed them.[434]\r\n\r\nRichard’s phrase about the conditions of release which Henry\r\nhad “extorted”[435] from the king of Scots seems to indicate a\r\nconsciousness that his father had, in forcing upon the caged Lion\r\nof Scotland terms of such abject submission, taken a somewhat\r\ndishonourable advantage of the lucky combination of accidents—for it\r\nwas really nothing more—which had placed William at his mercy.[436]\r\nBut policy, as well as chivalry, had a share in Richard’s agreement\r\nwith his royal vassal. Ten thousand marks, paid down in a lump and\r\nalmost immediately, was probably a much larger contribution than\r\ncould have been obtained from a country so poor as Scotland without\r\nsome very substantial concession in return. The retention of the\r\ncastles was quite unnecessary to the security of England; it must\r\ninevitably be a source of constant irritation to the Scots, and\r\nthus tend to endanger rather than to safeguard the tranquillity of\r\nthe border; and the restitution of them was the only real sacrifice\r\nwhich the treaty involved. Richard’s charter is most cautiously\r\nworded; he renounces nothing except the direct homage of the Scot\r\nking’s subvassals and the explicit mention of “Scotland” by name\r\nin William’s own act of homage on this occasion. The former would\r\nhave been extremely difficult to enforce at the moment, and of very\r\nlittle practical value. As to the latter point, the form of words\r\nchosen by Richard involved no recognition of the Scottish claim to a\r\npartial independence, and no renunciation or abatement of the English\r\nclaim to the overlordship of all North Britain. It left Richard and\r\nhis successors quite free to re-assert that claim explicitly at any\r\nfuture time, and to re-assert it as based not on a concession wrung\r\nfrom a helpless prisoner in 1175, but on their acknowledged right to\r\n“all” that William’s predecessors “had done and ought to have done”\r\nto the predecessors of Richard in virtue of a series of agreements\r\ngoing back from Henry II and Malcolm III to Eadward the Elder and\r\nDonald IV; for the English theory on the subject was that those\r\nancient agreements included, or involved, the homage of the Scot\r\nkings to the kings of England for the whole realm of Scotland. The\r\nScottish view was, of course, different; but these divergent views\r\nwere of little practical consequence so long as no necessity arose\r\nfor expressing them in words or carrying them out in action; no such\r\nnecessity had yet arisen, and none was destined to arise for another\r\nhundred years. A formula capable of this double interpretation was\r\nthus the only kind of formula on which the two parties could agree;\r\nand the point of immediate importance was that they should agree so\r\nthat the Scot’s homage should be done and done quickly, not delayed\r\nindefinitely or altogether refused at the eleventh hour. It was done\r\nat Canterbury on December 5.[437]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dec. 5_]\r\n\r\nOn the same day Richard proceeded to Dover;[438] about [Sidenote:\r\n_Dec. 11, 14_] a week later he went to Normandy.[439] He kept\r\nChristmas[440] [Sidenote: _Dec. 25_] in great state, “but,” adds a\r\npoet-chronicler, “there was little singing of _gestes_”; Richard,\r\nwho usually revelled in that kind of entertainment, was now too\r\nbusy and in too grave a mood for minstrelsy.[441] On December 30\r\nhe and [Sidenote: _Dec. 30_] Philip, after holding a conference at\r\nthe Gué St. Rémi, issued a joint proclamation setting forth their\r\narrangements for going together on the Crusade and for the safety\r\nand mutual protection of each other’s subjects and dominions during\r\ntheir absence, and bidding all their Crusader subjects either to\r\nprecede them or be ready to set out with them from Vézelay within the\r\noctave of Easter (March 25-April 1).[442] [Sidenote: 1190 _Jan._]\r\nBy the middle of January, however, both kings had discovered that\r\nthey could not be ready by April. The date of departure was again\r\npostponed, to S. John the Baptist’s day; and at a third conference\r\nheld in the middle of March the delay was further prolonged to the\r\noctave of that festival.[443] Richard meanwhile had made a visit\r\nto Aquitaine; on February 2-4 he was at La Réole,[444] on February\r\n12 at Londigny on the border of the Angoumois and Poitou,[445]\r\nmoving back towards Normandy to meet certain persons whom he had\r\nsummoned thither from England soon after Candlemas. One of the two\r\nmen whom he had appointed as joint chief justiciars, William de\r\nMandeville, had died on November 14.[446] For a time, it seems,\r\nthe king put no one formally into Mandeville’s place, and thus\r\nleft Hugh of Durham legally sole chief justiciar; but he gave the\r\ncustody of the Tower of London, which usually appertained to that\r\nofficer, to the chancellor, Bishop William of Ely, whom he also,\r\nbefore leaving England, intrusted with one of the royal seals “to\r\ncarry out the king’s orders in the realm,” thus making him virtually\r\nindependent of Hugh.[447] In February, however, the king summoned\r\nhis mother, his betrothed, his brothers John and Geoffrey (the\r\narchbishop-elect of York), Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury, and\r\nseven bishops, among whom were Hugh of Durham and William of Ely, to\r\njoin him in Normandy. “And when he had taken counsel with them, he\r\nappointed his chancellor, Bishop William of Ely, chief justiciar of\r\n[Sidenote: _Feb._] England, and granted to Bishop Hugh of Durham the\r\njusticiarship from the river Humber to the Scot king’s border.”[448]\r\nHe also made both his brothers swear that they would not enter\r\nEngland for three years “from that hour” except by leave from\r\nhim.[449] At the end of March or early in April[450] he sent the new\r\nchief justiciar, William of Ely, back to England “to prepare things\r\nnecessary for him”—that is, for the king—“and for his journey.”[451]\r\n\r\nThe chief item in this commission was the requisitioning of a supply\r\nof horses; William “took for the king’s use from every city in\r\nEngland two palfreys and two additional sumpter horses, and from\r\nevery manor of the king’s own [Sidenote: _March to April_] one\r\npalfrey and one sumpter horse.”[452] These horses were doubtless\r\nshipped across to Normandy, being, it seems, for the use of the king\r\nand his immediate companions, who, together with his continental\r\nfollowers, were going overland with Philip to meet the English fleet\r\nat Marseille. [Sidenote: 1189] Immediately on reaching England\r\nRichard had set about collecting a transport fleet, by sending his\r\nbailiffs to “all the sea-ports of England, Normandy, Poitou, and\r\nhis other lands” to choose for him the largest and best of all the\r\nships they found there and the fittest to carry heavy burdens. Some\r\nof these he gave to certain of his familiar friends who were bound\r\non Crusade; some he retained for his own use, and had them loaded\r\nwith arms and victuals.[453] The terms on which these ships were\r\nacquired seem to have varied considerably; in some cases the Crown\r\npaid half their value, in others the whole; a few were gifts from\r\nwealthy individuals.[454] In addition to all these the king already\r\nhad some “smacks” (_esneccae_) in ordinary use for the transport of\r\nhimself and his treasure between England and Normandy; these were now\r\nput in repair to fit them for a longer and more dangerous voyage.\r\nThe crews and captains of the other ships were of course taken over\r\ntogether with the vessels, and were paid by the king [Sidenote:\r\n1190] from Michaelmas 1189.[455] Some time in March or early in\r\nApril (1190) Richard held a council at Chinon and thence issued an\r\nordinance for the maintenance of discipline in the fleet, in the form\r\nof a charter which he delivered into the hands of the archbishop of\r\nAuch, the bishop of Bayonne, Robert de Sabloil, Richard de Camville,\r\nand William de Fors of Oléron, appointing them justiciars over “his\r\nwhole navy of England, Normandy, Poitou, and Britanny, about to sail\r\nfor Holy Land.” The regulations which they had to administer were\r\ndrastic. Any man who slew another on board ship was to be tied to the\r\ncorpse and cast with it into the sea; one who slew a man ashore to\r\nbe tied to the corpse and buried with it. A man convicted of drawing\r\nknife on another or striking him so that blood flowed was to lose\r\nhis hand. If he only struck with his palm, so that no blood flowed,\r\nhe was to be ducked three times in the sea. Anyone who insulted or\r\ncursed a comrade was to forfeit an ounce of silver for every such\r\noffence. A convicted thief was to be “shorn like a professional\r\nchampion, then tarred and feathered so as to be known,” and cast\r\nashore on the first land at which the ship touched.[456] Another\r\nwrit from the king bade all those of his subjects who were going to\r\nJerusalem by sea, as they valued their lives “and their return home,”\r\nswear to keep these “assizes” and obey the justiciars of the fleet,\r\nwho were further bidden to set out on the voyage as soon as possible;\r\nwhich they did shortly after Easter.[457]\r\n\r\nThe next step in Richard’s preparations for departure was of a very\r\ndifferent kind. Of all the country seats belonging to the counts\r\nof Poitou the one in which for many generations they seem to have\r\nmost delighted was Talmont. The lordship of which this castle was\r\nthe head included a territory known as “the Land of the Countess,”\r\nbecause it had formed part of the dower of the successive countesses\r\nof Poitou ever since the middle of the eleventh century. Here, “on\r\nthe sea-shore, in the wood of La Roche, and not far from the mouth of\r\nthe Jard”—a little stream which falls into the sea some few miles\r\nsouth-east of the castle of Talmont—Richard now founded a house of\r\nAugustinian canons. Its dedication was to “our Lord and the glorious\r\nVirgin Mary His Mother”; its name was to be “God’s Place,” _Locus\r\nDei_, _Lieu-Dieu_; and its endowment consisted of the whole “Land of\r\nthe Countess” with all its appurtenances, “including everything that\r\nhis mother, as well as himself, had or might have in that place,”\r\nwith the addition of other gifts and privileges.[458] Eleanor had no\r\nneed of “the Countess’s Land,” for Richard before leaving England had\r\ngranted to her, in addition to the dowry given her by his father, the\r\nwhole of that which Henry I had given to his queen and that which\r\nStephen had given to Maud of Boulogne.[459] Evidently it was with\r\nhis mother’s sanction that the king now dedicated to higher uses\r\nthis large share of a cherished possession of her forefathers which\r\nwas also a favourite pleasure-resort of his own. In God’s Place at\r\nTalmont we may surely see an offering made with special intention by\r\nthe offerer and his mother for his safety and welfare in his great\r\nadventure and for the success of the enterprise on which his heart\r\nwas set.\r\n\r\nOn May 6 Richard issued, at Fontenay, a charter for the foundation of\r\nanother religious house, a small minster dedicated to S. Andrew, at\r\nGourfaille, in the same neighbourhood.[460] [Sidenote: _May 8_] Two\r\ndays later he was at Cognac;[461] a month [Sidenote: _June 6_] later,\r\nat Bayonne,[462] and it seems to have been about this time that he\r\nbesieged and took the castle of Chis in the county of Bigorre and\r\nhanged its lord for the crime of having robbed pilgrims to S. James\r\nand other persons who passed through his lands.[463] By June 20\r\nRichard was again at Chinon;[464] thence he went to Tours, where he\r\nheld a final conference with Philip,[465] and received his pilgrim’s\r\nscrip and staff from the hands of Archbishop Bartholomew.[466] He\r\nseems to have characteristically proved the staff by leaning on it\r\nwith all his gigantic strength, for a chronicler adds: “When the\r\nking leaned on the staff, it broke.”[467] Never before, probably\r\nnever again, was there seen at Tours such a muster as that of the\r\nCrusaders who followed the banner of Richard the Lion Heart. City and\r\nsuburbs were overcrowded; “there were many good knights and famous\r\ncrossbowmen; and dames and damsels were sorrowful and heavy-hearted\r\nfor their friends who were going away, and all the people were in\r\nsadness because of their valiant lord’s departure” when he and his\r\nhost set out [Sidenote: _June 27_] “with a good courage”[468] on June\r\n27 for Vézelay. Whether the two kings actually kept their tryst on\r\nthe appointed day, July 1, is doubtful. Richard was certainly at the\r\nmeeting-place on the 3rd, but according to one account Philip did not\r\narrive till the 4th.[469] When they did meet, they took a reciprocal\r\noath that they would loyally divide between them whatever conquests\r\nthey should make together, and that whichever of them reached Messina\r\nfirst should wait there for the other.[470] They spent two days at\r\nVézelay together,[471] and then at last the united host began its\r\nmarch towards the Holy Land, “the two kings riding in front and\r\ndiscoursing of their great journey.”[472]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE OUTWARD VOYAGE\r\n\r\n1190\r\n\r\n  Initia Regis Ricardi, qui nondum elapso triennio regni sui\r\n  probitatis suae radios longe lateque dispersit; nam Messanas\r\n  civitatem Siciliae uno die viriliter subjecit, et terram Cypri\r\n  in quindecim diebus potenter subjugavit.—_Chron. Edw. II_, auct.\r\n  monacho Malmesburiensi, ii. 191.\r\n\r\n\r\nA march of eight days brought the Crusaders to Lyons on July 10\r\nor 13.[473] Here they were to cross the Rhône and then proceed\r\ndown its left bank to the coast. The two kings with their personal\r\nfollowers crossed at once and encamped on the further side of the\r\nriver (seemingly on a height whence their tents were visible from\r\nthe hither side) to wait till the stragglers and late comers should\r\novertake the main body of pilgrims, who lodged as they could in\r\nand around the city.[474] When the muster seemed to be complete,\r\nthe kings gave the signal for departure by causing their tents to\r\nbe struck.[475] The main body of the host on the other bank[476]\r\nthronged to the narrow wooden bridge; when a small number had crossed\r\none of the arches broke down.[477] Only two persons were drowned, but\r\nthe multitude left behind were sorely puzzled how to get across the\r\n“crested waters” of the Rhône in flood.[478] According to one account\r\nthey in three days achieved the passage “as best they could, in\r\nlittle boats, with great difficulty.”[479] Another version, however,\r\ntells us that it was only Philip who had actually set out before the\r\nbridge gave way,[480] and Richard, having merely escorted him out of\r\nthe camp, was still at hand when the catastrophe occurred; whereupon\r\nhe, “whose constancy never failed in action,” quickly caused a bridge\r\nto be made of boats lashed together, and waited three days while by\r\nthis means the whole host made its passage in safety.[481] Then,\r\nwhile the French king’s subjects followed their sovereign to Genoa\r\nor went by whatever route they chose to meet him at Messina,[482]\r\nthe English king at the head of his own contingent set out[483] for\r\nMarseille, [Sidenote: _July 31_] where he arrived on the last day of\r\nJuly.[484]\r\n\r\n“From Marseille to Acre,” says a contemporary writer, “is a sail of\r\nonly fifteen days. But,” he adds, “then you go through the Great\r\nSea, so that after the mountains round about Marseille cease to be\r\nvisible you will, if you keep the direct course, see no land either\r\nto right or left till you see the land of Syria.”[485] Some of the\r\nCrusaders who accompanied Richard—among them Archbishop Baldwin of\r\nCanterbury and Ranulf de Glanville—faced the mysterious terrors of\r\nthe “Great Sea” and took this route[486] to Tyre, which they reached\r\non September 16.[487] The two kings had chosen Messina as the final\r\nstarting-point of their voyage at a time when they deemed themselves\r\nsure of finding there every possible facility for refitting and\r\nrevictualling their ships, and substantial help of every kind for\r\ntheir enterprise; King William of Sicily being married to a sister\r\nof Richard, and having long ago promised every assistance in his\r\npower to the Crusade.[488] In March, however, they had learned that\r\nWilliam had died in the preceding November.[489] The original scheme\r\nnevertheless had obvious advantages both for Richard, who knew that\r\nWilliam had made some testamentary dispositions for his benefit,\r\nand for Philip, who “dreaded the sea.”[490] As the difficulties and\r\ndangers of the real overland route from northern France to Apulia\r\nand Sicily through the Alpine passes and Italy were apparently still\r\nconsidered even more formidable than those of the Mediterranean sea,\r\nPhilip had arranged to be conveyed by the practised mariners of Genoa\r\nfrom their city to Messina, not exactly as an English chronicler says\r\n“by land,” but by the shortest and easiest coasting route. Richard\r\non the contrary was minded to go by water as much as he could, and\r\nhad ordered his fleet to meet him at the nearest Mediterranean\r\nport—Marseille.[491] When a week had passed and no fleet appeared,\r\nhe grew weary of waiting; so he hired “two large busses and twenty\r\nwell armed galleys,” in which he set sail with his household troops\r\non August 7.[492] He was “grieved and confounded at the delay of his\r\nnavy,”[493] and seems to have coasted along very slowly in the hope\r\nof its overtaking him, for it was not [Sidenote: _Aug. 13_] till\r\nthe 13th that he reached Genoa, where he went ashore to [Sidenote:\r\n_Aug. 14_] visit Philip, who was lying there sick. Next day, at\r\nPortofino, he received a message from Philip asking for the loan\r\nof five galleys; Richard offered three, but this Philip declined.\r\n[Sidenote: _Aug. 23_] On the 23rd Richard relieved the tediousness of\r\nthe slow coasting voyage by landing with a small escort at Baratto\r\nand hiring horses on which the party rode to Piombino; [Sidenote:\r\n_Aug. 24_] there they rejoined their ships. “Then the king went on\r\nboard the galley of Fulco Rustac” (or “Rustancri”) instead of the\r\none in which he had been sailing (the “Pumbone”), and they proceeded\r\nto Porto Ercole, which was reckoned to be half way between Marseille\r\nand Messina. “But that day the sail of the galley in which the king\r\nwas got torn; so he went back to the Pumbone.” On the same day,\r\nAugust 25, he landed at Ostia,[494] where he was met by the cardinal\r\nbishop and some other persons sent by the Pope to receive him and\r\ninvite him to visit Rome; this he declined to do,[495] preferring, it\r\nseems, to spend a day in what a modern traveller might call seeing\r\nthe sights of the neighbourhood. [Sidenote: _Aug. 28 to Sept. 8_] He\r\nspent nearly a fortnight in the same way at Naples, making excursions\r\nround about (August 28-September 8); thence he went on horseback to\r\nSalerno,[496] and stayed there till on September 13 he heard that his\r\nfleet had arrived at Messina, and at once set out to rejoin it.[497]\r\nThe report was [Sidenote: _Sept. 14_] premature; but the fleet did in\r\nfact reach Messina next day. The story of its voyage illustrates the\r\nspirit of adventure in which the men of the more remote western lands\r\nset out upon their Crusade. The “justiciars of the navy” appointed\r\nin the spring had apparently taken each the command of a little\r\nsquadron, and these squadrons had sailed in April, according to the\r\nking’s order, from various ports of England, Normandy, Britanny, and\r\nPoitou. Ten ships of the English division set out from Dartmouth;\r\nsome of them touched at Silvia in Portugal, others at Lisbon, and all\r\nstopped to help the Christian Portuguese in their war against the\r\nMoors. Other ships of Richard’s—perhaps from more distant ports—came\r\ninto Lisbon harbour at the close of the war; the whole fleet sailed\r\nthence on July 26, passed the Straits of Gibraltar on August 1, and\r\nsailing along the coasts of Spain and Provence reached Marseille on\r\nAugust 22. Finding that the king was gone, they stayed a week for\r\nnecessary refitting, set out again on the 30th, and came to Messina\r\non Holy Cross day.[498] According to English accounts Philip of\r\nFrance [Sidenote: _Sept. 14_] arrived there two days later;[499]\r\nhis own biographer, however, says he came in August.[500] As he had\r\nno ships of his own, the greater part of his host had either gone\r\nbefore him to Messina or proceeded towards Syria by other routes; and\r\nto the disappointment of the townsfolk and the pilgrims assembled\r\nat Messina, who all hoped to see a king arrive with great pomp and\r\nmajesty, only the ship which bore Philip himself came into the\r\nharbour, and landing at the steps of the royal palace[501] he slipped\r\nout of sight as quickly and quietly as possible.[502]\r\n\r\nThe disappointed spectators of Philip’s landing were to be more\r\nthan compensated ere long by the arrival of another royal guest.\r\nBy September 21 Richard, travelling leisurely along the coast from\r\nSalerno, had reached Mileto in Calabria. Here a characteristic\r\nadventure nearly brought to an untimely end both his enterprise and\r\nhis life. He was riding forth next day, accompanied only by one\r\nknight, “and as they passed through a little township the king turned\r\naside towards a house where he heard the voice of a falcon, and he\r\nwent into the house and took the bird; and when he would not let\r\nit go, a number of villagers came running up and attacked him with\r\nstones and sticks. One of them drew his knife upon the king, and the\r\nking beat the man with the flat of his sword till the sword broke.\r\nThe other assailants he overcame with stones, and narrowly escaping\r\nfrom their hands made his way to the Priory of La Bagnara.” There,\r\nfinding himself close to what an English chronicler describes as\r\n“the great river which is called the Far of Messina,” he took boat\r\nand crossed it immediately, and “lay that night in a tent hard by\r\nthe great stone tower which stands by the entrance to the Far on\r\nthe Sicilian side”—that is, the pharos, lighthouse, or beacon-tower\r\nwhich gave the strait its medieval name.[503] He probably crossed\r\nin a vessel of his own fleet, the whole of which seems to have been\r\nassembled at the northern end of the strait in readiness to meet\r\nhim. [Sidenote: _Sept. 23_] Next day (September 23) he sailed at its\r\nhead into the harbour of Messina. “The galleys filled the Strait;\r\nthey were crowded with hardy looking warriors, and decked with\r\npennons and banners. So came the king to the shore,”[504] amid such\r\nblowing of horns and trumpets that “all the city was alarmed at the\r\nsound.” Philip and the governors and people of Messina went down to\r\nthe beach and stood there “marvelling at that which they saw and\r\nheard of the king of England and of his power.”[505] Richard “leaped\r\nashore,” and went immediately to speak with Philip.[506] Meanwhile\r\nthose of his barons who had reached Messina before him brought “the\r\nfine destriers which had come over in the transport ships; and he and\r\nhis people all mounted on horseback,”[507] and rode to their lodging,\r\nwhich—the royal palace being, by permission of the new sovereign of\r\nSicily, occupied by Philip—was being prepared for them in the house\r\nof one of the Sicilian king’s officers, “in the suburb outside the\r\ncity wall, among the vineyards.”[508]\r\n\r\nThe next of kin to the late king of Sicily and the person whom he had\r\ndesignated as his successor was his father’s sister Constance; but\r\nshe was far away in Germany—being married to the Emperor’s son—and\r\na cousin, Tancred, had without much difficulty become master of\r\nthe kingdom, or at least of its insular half. Tancred had, as has\r\nbeen seen, provided lodgings for his two royal guests at Messina;\r\nhe himself was at Palermo, and so was the widowed Queen Joan,\r\nRichard’s sister. Richard knew that a very liberal dowry in land\r\nhad been settled upon Joan by King William at their marriage,[509]\r\nand also that William had made a will containing a bequest to his\r\nfather-in-law, Henry II, of “a golden table twelve feet long and a\r\nfoot and a half wide, three golden tripods for sitting at the table,\r\na silken tent large enough for two hundred knights to eat in it\r\ntogether, a hundred first-rate galleys with all necessary gear and\r\nfood for the crews, sixty thousand seams of wheat, the same number\r\nof barley and of wine, and twenty-four cups and twenty-four dishes”\r\nof either silver or gold.[510] This bequest was evidently intended\r\nby William, who seems to have been long in ill-health and expecting\r\nan early death, as his contribution to the Crusade. Richard, as\r\nHenry’s heir, now claimed it from Tancred, and he also demanded that\r\nJoan should be sent to him immediately with her dowry and a golden\r\nchair[511] for her use “according to the custom of the queens of\r\nthat land.”[512] Tancred sent Joan off at once by sea “with just her\r\nbedroom furniture” and a million _terrini_ for her expenses.[513]\r\n[Sidenote: _Sept. 28_] She reached Messina on Michaelmas Eve, and\r\nwas conducted by her brother to a lodging prepared for her in the\r\nHospital;[514] but he speedily took steps for removing her to a\r\nsafer place; for trouble, possibly with Philip, certainly with the\r\ntownsfolk of Messina and with their king, was now evidently close at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe English king’s subjects who had reached Messina before him on the\r\nfleet had been refused admittance into the city; they were obliged to\r\nencamp on the shore, and suffered much annoyance and persecution from\r\na section of the townsfolk whom one of them describes as “a parcel\r\nof Griffons and low fellows of Saracen extraction.” These people not\r\nonly insulted the Crusaders in the vilest ways, but even killed some\r\nof them and outraged the corpses.[515] All “Ultramontanes,” or men\r\nfrom beyond the Alps, were hated by the two races with which Sicily\r\nwas mainly peopled—the “Griffons” or Greek-speaking folk, and the\r\nItalian-speaking whom the western writers call Lombards. In the minds\r\nof the last-named especially the memory of the Norman conquest of\r\nSicily and Apulia still rankled; “they always had a grudge against\r\nus,” says the Norman poet-historian of Richard’s Crusade, “because\r\ntheir fathers had told them that our ancestors had conquered them;\r\nso they could not love us.”[516] It seems not unlikely that Tancred\r\nhad gained the support of both Griffons and Lombards by posing as\r\nthe champion of a sort of national government in opposition to the\r\nrepresentatives of the foreign royal line, and that they looked\r\nwith suspicion upon the crusading host as possibly designed to be\r\nthe instrument of a new Norman conquest; more especially when they\r\ndiscovered, as they very soon did, that although it had nominally\r\ntwo crowned leaders, its real and sole commander-in-chief was the\r\nAnglo-Norman king. On the morrow of his arrival Richard set up\r\noutside the camp a gallows for thieves and robbers. “His judges\r\ndelegate spared neither sex nor age; and there was one punishment for\r\na stranger and for one born in the land.” The French king took no\r\nnotice of any ill-doing on the part of his own men, nor of any evil\r\ndone to them; but Richard cared not whose subject the criminal might\r\nbe; “considering every man as his own,” he left no wrong unpunished;\r\n“wherefore the Griffons called him the Lion and Philip the Lamb.”[517]\r\n\r\nBoth Griffons and Lombards did their utmost to make the position of\r\nthe “tailed Englishmen”—as they called Richard and all his followers\r\nindiscriminately—absolutely intolerable. They tried to starve them by\r\nrefusing to let them buy food in the city; they fell upon and slew\r\nany whom they caught in small parties and unarmed; they even began\r\nto raise the town walls, as if challenging the strangers to besiege\r\nthem.[518] By the time of Joan’s arrival matters had come to such a\r\npass that two days later (September 30) Richard with a small armed\r\nforce re-crossed the strait into Calabria, turned the Griffons out\r\nof a fortress called La Bagnara, [Sidenote: _Oct. 1_] and next day\r\nestablished his sister in it with a guard of his own men.[519] He\r\nnext seized a very strong fort or tower, which went by the name of\r\n“the Griffons’ Minster,” on an island in the Far, midway between\r\nLa Bagnara and Messina,[520] put its garrison to death, and made\r\nit a storehouse for the provisions which had been brought by his\r\nfleet from England and his other dominions.[521] Scarcely was this\r\ndone when on October 3 a dispute between a pilgrim and a townswoman\r\nabout the price of some bread which the woman brought into the camp\r\nfor sale led to an outbreak of hostilities. Richard, hearing the\r\nnoise, sprang on horseback and strove to recall his men, riding in\r\nand out among them and striking with his staff all whom he could\r\nreach, to check the attack which they were threatening on the city\r\ngate. His efforts and those of the “elders” of the city at length\r\nquieted the tumult.[522] Both parties, however, felt that the matter\r\nwas not ended. Before nightfall Richard went by boat to the palace\r\n[Sidenote: _Oct. 4_] and held a consultation with Philip.[523] Next\r\nmorning the archbishops of Messina, Monreale, and Reggio, with the\r\n“justices of Sicily”—that is, the governors whom Tancred had put in\r\ncharge of Messina, Margarit and Jordan du Pin[524]—and some others of\r\nTancred’s chief counsellors came to Richard’s lodging, bringing with\r\nthem the French king and some of his nobles, and also some of the\r\nchief nobles of Richard’s dominions, to discuss terms of peace.[525]\r\nThree times the colloquy was interrupted by tidings, first that the\r\nEnglish were being attacked, next that they were getting worsted,\r\nand finally that they were being killed “both within and without\r\nthe city.” The Sicilian members of the conference hurried away,\r\nostensibly for the purpose of checking their own people, “but they\r\nlied,” says Richard’s Norman chronicler.[526] Richard hastened\r\nforth to control his troops, learned that the quarters of one of his\r\nAquitanian followers, Hugh the Brown of Lusignan, had been attacked\r\nby a party of the townsfolk, and that another party was lying in wait\r\nfor himself, the city wall bristling with armed men, and another\r\nstrong body of citizens posted on the hills at the back of the\r\ntown.[527] He hurried back for his armour and instantly gave orders\r\nto “assault the city all round by land and by sea.”[528] He himself\r\nbegan by driving out the assailants from the camp. With scarce twenty\r\nmen at his back, he made for the quarters of Hugh the Brown; the\r\nLombards turned and fled from him “like sheep from a wolf,” says one\r\nwho saw the scene, and he drove them “as oxen are driven under the\r\nyoke” all the way to “the postern gate which is towards Palermo,” the\r\nwest gate of the city.[529] Meanwhile the whole English host was in\r\nmotion. The fleet could do nothing, because Philip, who had returned\r\nto the palace under a promise from the governor that he should not\r\nbe molested, intercepted the galleys as they approached and forbade\r\nthem to proceed.[530] The land attack met with a fierce resistance;\r\npart of the host endeavoured to storm the walls and the gates;\r\nRichard himself led a small party up a hill “so high and steep that\r\nno one would have thought they could by any means climb it,” drove\r\ndown in headlong flight the Sicilians who occupied its summit,[531]\r\nand rejoined his main force in time to be one of the first to enter\r\nthe city. “A good ten thousand went in after him,” says one of the\r\nnumber.[532]\r\n\r\nThe suddenness and rapidity with which the city was captured, and the\r\ncontemporary French form of its name, “Messines,” or in the Norman\r\ndialect “Meschines,” appear to have suggested to some Norman or\r\nAngevin rimester in the host a jingle which from the camp has found\r\nits way into history:\r\n\r\n      “Our king and his men have taken Messines\r\n      More quickly than priest can say his matines.”[533]\r\n\r\nThe whole fight had lasted less than five hours.[534] The town was\r\nplundered, “and there would have been more people slain, but that\r\nthe king took pity” and restrained his men. The Sicilian galleys\r\nin the harbour were set on fire and destroyed.[535] Philip and his\r\nfollowers meanwhile had sat at their ease within the palace and the\r\ncity, doing nothing to help their fellow-Crusaders, and totally\r\nunmolested by the Sicilians, among whom they seemed quite at home.\r\nBut when Philip learned that the victorious host had set up their\r\nroyal leader’s banners on the walls, he angrily declared that this\r\nact was an insult to himself as Richard’s feudal superior, and\r\ndemanded that the banners should be taken down and replaced by his\r\nown. Richard at first ignored the demand; but some of the prelates\r\nand nobles brought about a compromise; the banners of both kings were\r\nplaced on the towers together, and the custody of the fortifications\r\nwas given to the Templars and Hospitaliers till it should be seen how\r\nmatters would go between Richard and Tancred.[536] The compromise\r\nwas a fair one on Richard’s part; as his poet-chronicler says,\r\n“Sirs, I ask your judgement—which of the two had the best right to\r\nset his banners over the city, the one who would take no part in its\r\nassault, or the one who dared the enterprize?”[537] “But,” he remarks\r\nno less truly, “the king of France’s envy on that subject was like\r\nto be lifelong; that was the origin of the war whereby Normandy was\r\nruined.”[538] According to one account, Philip next, on the strength\r\nof the agreement made at Vézelay, demanded his share of the spoils of\r\nthe city, and grew so insolent and quarrelsome that Richard prepared\r\nto load up his ships and depart on his pilgrimage alone with his own\r\npeople rather than be tied any longer to so disagreeable a comrade.\r\nHereupon, however, Philip made overtures for reconciliation, and\r\n[Sidenote: _Oct. 8_] they renewed their alliance,[539] swearing and\r\nmaking their respective barons swear to keep good faith with each\r\nother [Sidenote: _Oct. 6_] throughout the expedition.[540] Two days\r\nearlier, on October 6, the governors of Messina had given hostages\r\nto Richard, pledging themselves to keep peace towards him and his\r\nmen and to let him have free possession of the city unless Tancred\r\nspeedily satisfied all his demands.[541]\r\n\r\nThose demands, for the whole of Joan’s dowry and William’s legacy\r\nto Henry, were now again transmitted to Palermo, by envoys who\r\nrepresented both the Crusader kings, for one of them was no less\r\na personage than the duke of Burgundy.[542] In the Anglo-Norman\r\ncamp it seems to have been reported that the French envoys returned\r\nloaded with gifts because they had carried a private message from\r\nPhilip to Tancred encouraging him to resist Richard’s demands and\r\npromising that in any strife which might ensue the French would\r\nremain neutral.[543] However this may have been, the envoys of the\r\nEnglish king brought back a very unsatisfactory reply to their\r\nmaster. “I gave to your sister Joan,” said Tancred, “a million\r\nterrins for quit-claim of her dower before she went away from me.\r\nConcerning your other demands I shall do whatever I ought to do\r\naccording to the custom of this realm.”[544] During the absence of\r\nthe envoys a very suspicious event took place at Messina. One night\r\nthe two governors of the city, Jordan du Pin and Margarit, stole away\r\nwith their respective households, taking with them all the gold and\r\nsilver they possessed. Richard at once seized their houses, their\r\ngalleys, and whatever other property they had left behind them. His\r\nown treasure was already stored in the “Griffons’ Minster,” which\r\nhe further strengthened by digging a deep and wide ditch across the\r\nisland on which the fort stood.[545] When his envoys returned from\r\nPalermo they found him busy with another piece of work “which gave\r\nhim pleasure,”[546] the erection, on the top of a hill overlooking\r\nthe city, of a strong wooden fortress to which he gave the name of\r\nMategriffon, “Check” or “Kill-Greek.”[547] All these precautions did\r\nin fact check the Griffons effectually; but when Richard on hearing\r\nTancred’s reply straightway retorted that he would enter upon no\r\npleadings at law and would get what he wanted in his own way,[548]\r\nthe Lombards again began to give trouble. They refused to sell even\r\nnecessary food to the host, “and but for God and the navy, many would\r\nhave led a poor life”; the ships, however, had ample stores. Philip\r\nwas accused of being secretly in league with the Lombards. The city\r\nand the camp were guarded day and night. Mediators went to and fro\r\nbetween the palace and Mategriffon, but could not bring the two kings\r\nback to friendship.[549]\r\n\r\nAt last Tancred intervened. “He was,” says Ambrose the poet-Crusader,\r\n“very wise; he had heard tell of many happenings; he was a good\r\nscholar; he knew his business.”[550] Through all these months he had\r\nplayed a waiting game till he could feel sure which of the two kings\r\nwould be most useful to him as an ally. At first he had inclined to\r\nPhilip, and “would have given him untold gold” for the marriage\r\nof one of his daughters to either the French king himself or to\r\nhis infant son Louis; but Philip declined this proposal because he\r\ndid not wish to quarrel with Tancred’s rival, Constance’s husband,\r\nwho was now king of the Germans and Emperor elect,[551] and whose\r\nfriendship he doubtless foresaw might be useful to him in future\r\nstruggles with Richard. By the end of October, however, Tancred not\r\nonly knew that the townsfolk of Messina had gone too far; he also\r\nperceived that he had himself gone too far in his haughtiness towards\r\nthe English Lion. He therefore despatched two messengers to Richard\r\nwith an offer of alliance. He proposed to give twenty thousand ounces\r\nof gold to Joan instead of her dower-lands, and to Richard, in place\r\nof King William’s legacy, the same amount as the dowry of one of his\r\n(Tancred’s) daughters on condition of her marriage with Richard’s\r\nnephew, Arthur of Britanny.[552] Richard saw at once that this offer\r\nmust be accepted. The necessity of coming to a settlement of some\r\nkind with Tancred, and the outrageous conduct of Tancred’s subjects,\r\nhad already detained him in Sicily much longer than he had originally\r\ncontemplated. Now it was quite clear that he would be obliged to\r\nremain there for several more months, as the season of the year had\r\nbegun when the “inclemency of winds and waves and weather”[553] made\r\nnavigation so difficult and dangerous that no fleet could attempt a\r\nvoyage to Palestine till the return of spring. The same cause must\r\nof course detain Philip also; and to reject Tancred’s offer would\r\nhave been to throw Tancred and Philip into each other’s arms. Nor was\r\nthe offer itself a bad one. Whatever might be the intrinsic value\r\nof Joan’s dower-lands and of William’s legacy, there was obviously\r\nvery little chance of ever gaining either the one or the other; while\r\nforty thousand ounces of gold would be a very convenient addition to\r\nthe treasury of the Crusade. A treaty on these terms was therefore\r\ndrawn up and executed forthwith. Richard promised that all questions\r\nabout his sister’s dowry and his own claims should be henceforth at\r\nrest; that he and his men would faithfully keep peace by sea and by\r\nland with Tancred and all his subjects, and if the Sicilian realm\r\nshould be invaded or attacked while they were in it, they would help\r\nthe king against his assailants; that Arthur—“our dear nephew, and\r\nour heir if we should die without issue”—should be contracted to\r\nTancred’s daughter; and that the bride should have a dower of lands\r\nwithin her husband’s duchy “befitting a lady so illustrious and the\r\ndaughter of so magnificent a king.” If Arthur succeeded to the Crown,\r\nhis wife was to have the customary dower of a queen of England. If,\r\non the other hand, from any cause dependent on Richard or Arthur,\r\nthe marriage should not take place “in due time” (that is, when the\r\nchildren should be old enough; Arthur was in his fourth year), the\r\ndowry given by the bride’s father was to be returned.[554] Tancred\r\non his part promised that he and his subjects would keep peace\r\nwith Richard and his men,[555] and he paid over the covenanted sum\r\nwithout delay.[556] Richard was in a pacific mood; although none\r\nof the gold which he had just received could fairly come under his\r\nagreement with Philip as to the division of conquests, he at once\r\nmade Philip a peace-offering of part of it.[557] He next insisted on\r\nhis men restoring to the townsfolk the plunder which they had taken\r\nfrom them, and Archbishop Walter of Rouen enforced this order by\r\nthreatening to excommunicate those who failed to obey it. Finally, a\r\nset of ordinances for the regulation of intercourse and trade between\r\nthe pilgrims and the townsfolk was issued in the joint names of all\r\nthe three kings.[558] Thenceforth town and camp were on friendly\r\nterms, and so were—for a while—the two pilgrim kings. There was,\r\nhowever, some grumbling in the host, especially among the knights\r\nwho had reached Messina before Richard, at their long detention\r\nthere and the expense which it entailed on them, and at being forced\r\nto give back the plunder with which they had recouped themselves.\r\nRichard “was not avaricious or stingy”; he silenced the grumblers\r\nby a distribution of costly gifts, of which all ranks, down to the\r\nlowest foot-soldiers, received such a share that every [Sidenote:\r\n_Feb. 1191_] man was fully satisfied.[559] Early in the next year he\r\nmade a present to the French king of several of the ships which had\r\ncome from England, and to his own troops, of all ranks, a further\r\ndistribution of “more treasures than any of his predecessors had ever\r\ngiven away in a whole year.”[560]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1190]\r\n\r\nBefore Christmas Richard’s growing sense of the weightiness of his\r\nenterprise showed itself in another step in his preparations. One day\r\nhe called together in the chapel of the house where he was lodging\r\nall the bishops in his host, came before them as a penitent, with\r\nthree scourges in his hands, fell at their feet and openly confessed\r\nto them a vice in which he had lived and which he now solemnly\r\nabjured; he received his penance at their hands, “and thenceforth\r\nreturned to his iniquity no more.”[561] At Christmas he entertained\r\nPhilip and the French nobles at a great feast in Mategriffon.[562]\r\nThe festivities were disturbed by a quarrel between the Genoese and\r\nPisan sailors and some of the men belonging to Richard’s galleys, and\r\nnot till some lives were lost did the two kings in person succeed in\r\nquelling [Sidenote: 1191 _Feb. 2_] the strife.[563] An incident on\r\nCandlemas Day (1191) throws a curious side-light on one phase of\r\nRichard’s character of which there is little trace elsewhere, and\r\nalso on his relations with the other crusading chiefs during this\r\ndreary time of waiting. He and some English and French knights, on\r\ntheir way back from a ride, met a countryman with a load of reeds or\r\nbulrushes and bought some for a game such as boys played, tilting\r\nwith the rushes for spears. The king challenged William des Barres,\r\nwith whom he had had at least two encounters in real warfare, and who\r\n(according to one account) on the second of these occasions,[564]\r\nbeing made prisoner, had committed a breach of the rules of chivalry\r\nwhich Richard was not a man to condone easily: he had regained his\r\nliberty by breaking his parole. When William’s first thrust broke the\r\nhead of Richard’s bulrush, Richard was seized with one of those fits\r\nof unaccountable, irrational fury before which all persons accustomed\r\nto associate with the Angevin counts quailed as before a direct\r\nmanifestation of the powers of darkness whence the house of Anjou was\r\nsaid to have sprung. He set his horse furiously at his opponent; the\r\nshock of the encounter failed to unseat William, but caused Richard’s\r\nown saddle to slip; he leapt from it, mounted another horse, and\r\nrenewed the attack, but with no better success; nor did his angry\r\nthreats disturb the coolness of the Frenchman. The Earl of Leicester,\r\ntrying to intervene, was roughly bidden by his sovereign, “Leave me\r\nto deal with him alone!” and finally, after a long struggle and much\r\nbandying of words, the king burst out to William, “Get thee hence,\r\nand take heed that I see thee no more, for henceforth I will be an\r\nenemy to thee and thine for ever.” William, now thoroughly alarmed,\r\nwent and besought counsel and help of his own sovereign. Philip in\r\nperson interceded for his unlucky vassal; some of the highest nobles\r\nof France actually went down on their knees to Richard for the same\r\npurpose; but Richard would hear none of them; and on the third day\r\nWilliam des Barres had to leave Messina “because the king of France\r\nwould not keep him against the will of the king of England.”[565]\r\n\r\nThe time was now approaching when the seas would again be navigable,\r\nand Philip presently asked Richard to get ready to accompany him on\r\nwhat was called “the March passage” to Holy Land. Richard is said\r\nby a French chronicler to have answered that he could not go before\r\nAugust.[566] It seems that either August here must be a mistake for\r\nApril, or Richard cannot have been serious in answering thus, unless\r\nindeed he entertained some vague project of going back for a short\r\nvisit to his island realm before proceeding further eastward. Such\r\na project is not impossible; for the reports which had been coming\r\nto him through the winter about the state of affairs in England\r\nwere at once so disquieting and so contradictory that he may well\r\nhave longed to see for himself how matters really stood and settle\r\nby his personal authority the quarrels which had arisen between his\r\njusticiars and his brother. In the end he committed the solution\r\nof these very puzzling difficulties to Archbishop Walter of Rouen.\r\nHe had, however, another reason for delaying at least for a few\r\nweeks his own departure for Acre. Early in the year King Sancho\r\nof Navarre had placed his daughter Berengaria in Queen Eleanor’s\r\ncharge to take her to Richard to become his wife.[567] Before the\r\nend of February the two ladies reached Naples, and Richard sent\r\nsome galleys to meet them there; but “on account of the multitude\r\nof men who accompanied them” Tancred’s people refused them leave to\r\ngo to Messina—which indeed must have been already overwhelmed with\r\nforeign visitors—and they had to spend a month in his continental\r\ndominions.[568] Their coming was a clear intimation that Richard was\r\nnow fully determined to shake off the bonds of his engagement to\r\nAloysia. Philip peremptorily bade him, as his vassal, choose between\r\ntwo alternatives: either to go with his overlord across the sea, in\r\nwhich case he should be at liberty to marry Berengaria, or, if he\r\nwould not go, to keep his promise of marriage with Aloysia. Richard\r\nbluntly refused both.[569] Meanwhile Tancred had invited him[570] to\r\na [Sidenote: _March 3_] meeting at Catania. A splendid welcome was\r\ngiven him there on March 3, and for three days he was Tancred’s guest\r\nin the palace. Tancred offered him “gifts many and great” in gold and\r\nsilver, cloth of silk, and horses, but Richard, “needing none of such\r\nthings,” would accept only one small ring as a token of friendship;\r\nin return for this he presented Tancred with a sword which he seems\r\nto have asserted to be the famous Excalibur of King Arthur. Finally\r\nTancred offered a substantial gift which Richard did not decline: a\r\ncontribution of four large ships “which they call ussers” and fifteen\r\ngalleys to the crusading fleet.[571] The Sicilian king escorted his\r\nguest on the way back as far as Taormina, where Philip was to meet\r\nthem on March 8. There Tancred is said to have put into Richard’s\r\nhands a letter which he declared had been brought to him by the\r\nduke of Burgundy from the French king, containing an assertion that\r\nRichard had no intention of keeping faith with Tancred, and a promise\r\nthat if Tancred were disposed to attack Richard, the French troops\r\nand their sovereign would give their help in effecting Richard’s\r\ndestruction. Richard on this left Taormina before Philip reached it\r\nand returned to Messina by another way so as to avoid meeting him.\r\nWhen he did meet him again, he at first studiously avoided him or\r\nignored his presence; when asked the reason, he showed the letter.\r\nPhilip accused him of having invented the whole affair as an excuse\r\nfor “casting off” the daughter of France whom he had promised to\r\nwed. Thus driven to extremity, Richard said plainly that a marriage\r\nbetween him and Aloysia was impossible, and gave a reason which, as\r\nhe produced several witnesses who declared themselves ready to swear\r\nto its truth, fully justified his refusal.[572] The result was that\r\nPhilip formally released him from his engagement and declared him\r\nfree to marry whomsoever he would. On the basis of this and certain\r\nother conditions which were to take effect only at a later time, a\r\n“firm peace” was once again made between the king of France and his\r\n“friend and faithful liegeman, the illustrious king of England.”\r\n\r\nThe treaty was made before March 25;[573] shortly afterwards Philip\r\nand his “company” sailed, in the galleys which Richard had given\r\nhim, for Acre.[574] Before starting he again besought Richard to\r\npardon William des Barres, and Richard after some demur promised to\r\nkeep the peace towards William so long as they were both engaged in\r\nthe cause of the Cross.[575] He convoyed Philip through the Far,\r\nand then himself went to Reggio, having just heard that Eleanor and\r\nBerengaria had arrived there. He took them on board and brought his\r\nmother back with him to Messina, after, it seems, placing Berengaria\r\nat La Bagnara with Joan; the men of the queen’s suite seem to have\r\nbeen left at Reggio, and possibly even Eleanor and her ladies may not\r\nhave landed at Messina at all, for she stayed with her son only four\r\ndays and then departed for England.[576] He had nothing more to wait\r\nfor. With all speed the fleet was made ready, and on April 10, the\r\nWednesday before Easter, it put to sea.[577]\r\n\r\nThe ships which Richard had found awaiting him in the harbour of\r\nMessina when he arrived there are said to have numbered one hundred\r\nand fourteen.[578] Stragglers that had come in later, Tancred’s\r\ngift, and other vessels bought or hired by Richard had now raised\r\nthe total to about two hundred.[579] Of these, some forty or fifty\r\nwere galleys or battleships, built after the pattern of the old\r\nRoman _liburnae_ or the “long keels” of Richard’s Norse forefathers,\r\nlong, slender, with armed prows, and propelled by two tiers of\r\noarsmen.[580] The rest were transport vessels; those of the largest\r\nsize, of which there seem to have been now twenty-four, were called\r\n“busses” by the northerners and “dromonds” in the Mediterranean and\r\nthe Levant. Of these vessels, fourteen which had formed part of the\r\noriginal English fleet had each of them three spare rudders, thirteen\r\nanchors, thirty oars, two sails, triple ropes of every kind, and a\r\ndouble set of everything else that a ship could need, except the mast\r\nand the boat; the lading of each consisted of forty war-horses, forty\r\nknights with all their arms and accoutrements, forty foot-soldiers,\r\nand fifteen sailors, with food enough for all these men and horses\r\nfor a whole year. The other ships of burden, called “huissiers,”\r\n“ushers,” “enekes” or “smacks” (_esneccae_) were round-shaped\r\nvessels, seemingly dependent on sails alone; their carrying capacity\r\nwas half that of the busses. The king had taken the precaution to\r\ndistribute his treasure among all the transport ships, “so that if\r\npart were lost, another part should be saved.”[581]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _April 10_]\r\n\r\nIf the fleet’s arrival had been a great sight for the people of\r\nMessina, its departure must have been a much more imposing spectacle.\r\nThree dromonds, one of which carried Queen Joan and the Damsel of\r\nNavarre, went in advance of all the rest. Thirteen ships formed\r\nthe second line or squadron; in the third were fourteen, in the\r\nfourth twenty, in the fifth thirty, in the sixth forty, in the\r\nseventh sixty; the last consisted of the galleys, on one of which\r\nwas the king himself. Throughout the fleet the order of its going\r\nwas so carefully arranged that a trumpet’s sound could be heard from\r\nsquadron to squadron, and a man’s voice from ship to ship.[582] When\r\nall had passed, with a fair wind, through the Far into the open sea,\r\nthe galleys sped forward to overtake the slower vessels[583] and took\r\ntheir place as the advanced guard of the whole fleet, Richard’s own\r\nship leading.[584] “The king had arranged, as far as possible, that\r\nthe ships should never be separated unless indeed a storm should\r\ndisperse them. So the galleys moderated their speed and endeavoured\r\nto keep pace with the transports, for the protection of the multitude\r\nand the comfort of the weak.”[585] Suddenly the wind dropped, and\r\nthe whole fleet had to anchor for the night. Next morning, Maunday\r\nThursday, [Sidenote: _April 11_] “He Who took the wind from us,” as\r\none of the pilgrims says, “gave it us back again”; but the breeze was\r\nso faint that they made very little progress, and at night they were\r\nagain becalmed. On the following morning (Good Friday, April 12) they\r\nwere met by “a contrary wind on the left,”[586] and all that day they\r\nhad to struggle with a heavy gale and storm. As good pilgrims they\r\nendured their sufferings “right willingly, as a fitting discipline\r\nfor the holy day.”[587] On their leader wind and weather had no\r\neffect; he was “just as healthy and hearty, brave and strong, on sea\r\nas on land”;[588] throughout this first experience of Mediterranean\r\nstorms and all those that followed, he “remained perfectly calm, and\r\nceased not to comfort the others and encourage them to endure with\r\nconfidence, hoping for better things.”[589] Every evening he had “a\r\nlarge candle in the lantern” lighted on his galley, to show the way\r\nto the other ships; they all followed the light, and if one got out\r\nof the course he waited for it to get back. “Thus as a hen leads her\r\nchickens out to feed he led his mighty fleet,” sailing day and night\r\ntill late on the Wednesday in Easter Week (April 17) they anchored\r\noff Crete.[590] Next morning, it seems, Richard counted up the ships,\r\nand found to his “great wrath” that despite all his precautions no\r\nless than twenty-five were missing.[591] He then directed his course\r\nto Rhodes, reached its capital city on the following Monday (April\r\n22), and stayed there three days, partly because he was unwell,\r\npartly in the hope of hearing some tidings of the missing vessels,\r\nand also to make inquiries about Cyprus and its “tyrant.”[592]\r\n\r\nThis “tyrant” was Isaac Comnenos, who, sent to Cyprus as governor\r\nfor the Byzantine Emperor in 1185, had made himself master of the\r\nisland and ruled it as an independent sovereign for six years. His\r\n“tyranny,” or usurpation, was not one of the least of the hindrances\r\nto the deliverance of Holy Land; the Franks in that land had in\r\nformer times depended largely on the fertile and wealthy Greek island\r\nfor its supplies, but now they could get nothing thence, for Isaac\r\nwas in close alliance with Saladin, and “never ceased doing as much\r\nill to Christians as he could.”[593] Whether [Sidenote: _April_]\r\nRichard’s detour to Rhodes had any special motive or was caused\r\nmerely by circumstances and stress of weather we do not know; but\r\nit seems quite clear that he went out of his direct way from Rhodes\r\nto Acre in consequence of information received at Rhodes as to what\r\nwas going on in Cyprus. Probably, too, he thought Cyprus a likely\r\nplace in which to obtain news of his strayed ships; and so it proved\r\nto be. Among the ships dispersed in the great storm of Good Friday\r\nwere the three dromonds which carried the ladies and their escort.\r\nThese three and some others had drifted southward, and while Richard\r\nwas sailing by the north coast of Crete to Rhodes, they were passing\r\nthrough the open sea between Crete and Libya. On April 24, two or\r\nthree days after Richard’s arrival at Rhodes, they were trying to\r\nput into the harbour of Limisso, or as the Crusade writers call it\r\nLimasol, the ancient Amathus, on the south [Sidenote: _April 24_]\r\ncoast of Cyprus, when a storm arose and dashed two of them to pieces\r\nagainst the rocks;[594] a third ship put back into the open sea in\r\ntime to save itself[595] and its precious freight—it was the ship\r\nwhich carried not only a considerable part of the king’s treasure\r\n(under the charge of Stephen of Turnham, now restored to the king’s\r\nfavour and acting as his marshal and treasurer), but also Joan and\r\nBerengaria. The “Griffons” of Cyprus took the men who struggled\r\nashore from the wrecks to a fort hard by, promising them food and\r\nshelter, but stripped them of their arms on the plea that this was\r\nnecessary till the pleasure of the “Emperor” (Isaac) concerning\r\nthem should be known; and they also seized the clothes and other\r\nnecessaries which the knights on the remaining ships sent to their\r\ndistressed comrades. These latter, finding themselves prisoners and\r\n[Sidenote: _May 2_] almost starved, at the end of a week made a\r\ndetermined effort to escape. With three bows which they had either\r\nsecreted or found in the fort they did such execution that the whole\r\nparty was able to make its way to the harbour, where their friends\r\nin the ships, seeing what was going on, had meanwhile landed and\r\nwere fighting hard with the Griffons; finally the Griffons were\r\nworsted, and the queen’s ship was brought into the harbour.[596]\r\nThat evening Isaac came to Limasol; the pilgrims appealed to him,\r\nand he [Sidenote: _May 3_] promised them redress for their wrongs.\r\nNext day he sent the queen and her future sister-in-law a courteous\r\ninvitation to land; this being prudently declined, he followed it up\r\n[Sidenote: _May 4_] on the morrow with hospitable gifts of bread,\r\nmeat, and the [Sidenote: _May 5_] famous wine of Cyprus. On the\r\nSunday he again tried to persuade the ladies to come ashore; after\r\nanxious consultation they, fearing that longer resistance might\r\nlead to their being taken captives by force—for Isaac meanwhile was\r\nassembling his troops on the shore—promised to commit themselves to\r\nhis protection on the morrow. But on that same Sunday Richard’s fleet\r\ncame in sight.[597] It had left Rhodes on May 1; the galleys, headed\r\nas usual by Richard’s own ship, had been driven by the wind into\r\nthe dangerous gulf of Satalia (or Atalia) on the coast of Pamphylia,\r\nand narrowly escaped destruction, but were extricated and brought in\r\nsafety to Cyprus, seemingly by the fine seamanship [Sidenote: _May\r\n6_] of their royal leader.[598] On the morning of Monday they reached\r\nthe entrance to the harbour of Limasol. As soon as Richard learned\r\nwhat had been taking place there he sent a messenger ashore with a\r\ncivilly worded remonstrance to Isaac and a request that he would make\r\namends for his people’s ill-treatment of Crusaders. Isaac was on\r\nthe shore with all the troops that he had been able to collect from\r\nevery part of his island “empire.” He cut the messenger short with an\r\ninsulting word—“Tproupt, sir!”; the messenger went straight back and\r\nrepeated it to the king. Richard’s retort was equally brief; it was a\r\ncommand to his own men—“To arms!”[599]\r\n\r\nBetween the fleet and the shore five armed galleys lay in the\r\nharbour. On the shore Isaac’s troops were drawn up behind a barricade\r\ncomposed of every bit of wood that the town could supply, doors and\r\nwindow-frames or shutters, barrels and casks, shields and bucklers,\r\npieces of old ships and boats, planks, steps, benches, boxes, all\r\npiled up along the water’s edge.[600] At the back of the troops was\r\nthe fortified town, overtopped by a lofty castle or citadel built\r\non the rock.[601] The Crusaders could land only by means of their\r\nboats. Knights and crossbowmen hurriedly obeyed the king’s order,\r\nand all weary and worn with long tossing on the sea and laden with\r\ntheir heavy armour and cumbrous weapons, crowded into the tiny\r\ncockle-shells[602] to join battle as foot-soldiers with an army of\r\nwhich part at least was well provided with good horses and mules, and\r\nwhich, moreover, was on its own soil; “but,” as one of the pilgrims\r\nsays, “we knew the most about war.” Richard’s crossbowmen opened the\r\nfight by shooting at the enemy’s galleys; “there were some who did\r\nnot miss their aim,” says the same eye-witness; the Greek sailors\r\nin a panic leaped into the water, and while they were struggling\r\nthere their ships were captured and taken outside the harbour to be\r\nguarded by the English fleet. Meanwhile the king, when he saw his\r\ncomrades struggling to land from the boats under a storm of arrows,\r\n“leaped from his boat into the sea and made for the Greeks, and\r\nassailed them.” His men followed his example and drove the Greeks\r\nback, some into the town, more into the fields. Isaac took to flight;\r\nRichard, running after him, caught a horse “with a sack attached to\r\nits saddle, and stirrups of cord,” sprang on its back, and shouted\r\n“Emperor! come and joust!” But Isaac “had no mind to joust,” and\r\ncontinued his flight.[603] The town of Limasol now submitted to\r\nRichard, and he brought his sister and his bride ashore.[604] That\r\nsame night the horses were [Sidenote: _May 7_] landed and exercised;\r\nand next morning Richard with a small force set out in search of the\r\nenemy. A party of them was soon found in an olive garden, dislodged,\r\nand chased till the main body suddenly came into view. Then Richard,\r\nhaving with him at the moment only fifty knights, called a halt.\r\nMeanwhile the shouts of the Greeks whom he had been chasing reached\r\nthe ears of Isaac, half a league in advance, where he had stopped\r\nto dine and sleep, for he had no idea that the Franks possessed any\r\nhorses. He and his escort climbed a hill “to see what their folk\r\nwould do.” All they did was to keep turning about and shooting and\r\nshouting back at the little band of Franks, who stood motionless.\r\nOne Hugh de la Mare, who though he bore arms was a clerk, said to\r\nthe king, “Come away, sire, their numbers are too overwhelming.”\r\n“Get you to your own writing-business, sir clerk, and leave matters\r\nof chivalry to us,” retorted Richard. He knew that reinforcements\r\nwere not far behind him; even before they came up, the suddenness\r\nand vehemence of his onset threw the Greeks into confusion; and\r\nthe victory was soon complete. Isaac fled to the mountains; his\r\nstandard-bearer was struck down and the standard taken by Richard’s\r\nown hand. After chasing the enemy for a couple of leagues the king\r\ncalled off his troops from the pursuit and leisurely returned, the\r\nmen-at-arms stopping on the way back to collect countless spoils left\r\nby the Emperor in the place where he had camped. On reaching the town\r\nthe king caused a proclamation to be made that “all people of the\r\nland who did not desire war might come and go in safety; but such as\r\ndid seek war should have no peace or truce from him.”[605]\r\n\r\nOn the way from Rhodes to Cyprus Richard had spoken a ship westward\r\nbound from Acre and heard of Philip’s arrival there.[606] Some vessel\r\nsailing from Rhodes or Cyprus to Acre seems to have carried thither\r\nnews of Richard’s whereabouts. On May 11 three galleys were seen\r\napproaching Limasol. Richard characteristically[607] set off in a\r\nlittle [Sidenote: _May 11_] boat to ascertain for himself what they\r\nwere,[608] and found that they carried King Guy of Jerusalem and some\r\nof his chief nobles, who had come in search of the king of England to\r\nsecure his alliance and support against a scheme which had been set\r\non foot at Acre under Philip’s auspices for deposing Guy and making\r\nConrad of Montferrat, the lord of Tyre, king in his stead. Richard\r\nwelcomed them cordially and royally. His marriage and the coronation\r\nof his queen took place next day (May 12). A few more days were spent\r\nin festivities and in waiting for some belated ships to come into\r\nport.[609] Among those irretrievably lost in the great storm there\r\nseem to have been several galleys, but some at least of these were\r\nnow replaced by the Cypriote ones which had been captured.[610] When\r\nat last the tale of vessels was complete, Richard prepared to resume\r\nhis pursuit of Isaac. Isaac, however, who had retired inland to the\r\ncapital of Cyprus, Nicosia, anticipated him by sending proposals for\r\na parley. It took place “in a garden of fig trees between the shore\r\nand the Limasol road.”[611] The king went in regal state, attired\r\nin a tunic of rose-coloured samite and a mantle “bedight with small\r\nhalf-moons of solid silver set in rows, interspersed with shining\r\norbs like suns”; his head was covered with a scarlet cap; he was\r\ngirt with a well-proved sword “with a golden hilt, a silken belt,\r\nand a finely chased scabbard edged with silver”; his spurs were\r\ngolden (or gilt), and he was mounted on a Spanish horse of great\r\nbeauty as well as of a size befitting a rider of such lofty stature;\r\n“his saddle was red, studded with little golden and bright-coloured\r\nstars, and having on its hinder part two golden lion-cubs rampant,\r\nand as if snarling at each other.”[612] Isaac swore fealty to\r\nRichard, promising to accompany him to Holy Land and serve under him\r\nthere with five hundred knights; meanwhile Richard was to hold the\r\ncastles and imperial domains of Cyprus in pledge and to receive an\r\nindemnity of three thousand five hundred marks. On these terms they\r\nexchanged the kiss of peace.[613] That night, however, Isaac mounted\r\nhis fleetest horse, a wonderful animal called Fauvel, and fled to\r\nFamagosta (the ancient Ammochontos, on the east coast). His flight\r\nwas discovered immediately, but Fauvel seems to have had a reputation\r\nwhich was already known to Richard, for the king forbade all direct\r\npursuit as useless. Instead, he took stronger measures; he put to\r\nsea at the head of his galleys and [Sidenote: _May 15-30_] sailed\r\nround to Famagosta while his land-forces were, at his request, led\r\nby Guy along the coast-road to meet him there. When they reached the\r\nplace, however, they found it deserted. Richard sent some ships round\r\nto the other coast-towns to guard against Isaac’s escape by sea; he\r\nhimself stayed three days at Famagosta, and there gave an audience\r\nto some envoys from Philip, charged with a pressing request that he\r\nwould proceed to Acre without further delay. Their urgency was so\r\nvehement and so insulting that “the king grew angry, and raised his\r\neyebrows, and there were words spoken which it is not meet to write.”\r\n“Not for half the wealth of Russia” would he leave Cyprus till he had\r\nconquered it and made sure that the supplies of food of which it was\r\nthe storehouse should be available for the Crusade. So he marched\r\nupon Nicosia, whither Isaac had again retired. This time Richard,\r\nfearing an [Sidenote: c. _May 18_] attack from behind, took the\r\ncommand of the rearguard. Isaac was lying in wait with his household\r\ntroops; after an unsuccessful attempt to check the advance of the\r\nFrankish vanguard, he “like a Turcople” harassed the flanks of the\r\nhost till he came near enough to Richard to shoot at him two arrows.\r\nRichard dashed forward and would have taken summary vengeance, but\r\nthe Cypriote Emperor was mounted on Fauvel, and the matchless steed\r\ncarried him away, at a pace which defied pursuit, to the strong\r\ncastle of Candaria or Kantara. His troops retired in confusion. Next\r\nmorning the citizens of Nicosia made their submission to Richard,\r\nand he “had their beards shaved off in token of the transfer of\r\ntheir allegiance to a new lord.” He then divided his army into\r\nthree parts, probably intending himself to take the command of one\r\nof them; but he fell sick and was obliged to remain at Nicosia and\r\nleave the direction of the campaign to the king of Jerusalem. Guy,\r\nwho seems to have known the country, besieged and took the castle\r\nof Cherina,[614] on the north coast, and found within its walls\r\nthe emperor’s only child, a young girl. Her father was so dismayed\r\nat her capture that he ordered the immediate surrender of the next\r\nfortress, “Didemus,”[615] to which Guy laid siege. Richard, as soon\r\nas he recovered, went to attack a third stronghold, “Bufevent.”[616]\r\nScarcely had he reached it when Isaac offered complete surrender\r\nof his castles, lands, “everything,” begging only to be spared\r\nthe indignity of “irons or bonds.” Isaac followed close on his\r\nmessenger and threw himself at the king’s feet. Richard raised him up\r\ngraciously, seated him at his side, and relieved his anxiety about\r\nhis daughter by bringing her to meet him. As for the fetters, Isaac’s\r\nrequest evidently ran counter to the king’s inclination or to his\r\nfears of a possible escape; but, “lest folk should make an outcry,”\r\nhe granted it after a fashion: he put the fallen tyrant in chains of\r\nsilver.[617]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _May 18-June 1_]\r\n\r\nThus in fifteen days—the last fortnight of May[618]—Richard, with\r\nGuy’s help, had “won the mastery of Cyprus for the service of God.”\r\nFor the same purpose he took possession of a mass of treasures of\r\nall kinds which he found in the castles.[619] Moreover, the people\r\nof the land, to whom Isaac had been a “tyrant” in every sense of the\r\nword,[620] gave to their new ruler “the half of all they possessed”\r\n“for the restoration of the laws and institutes which they had had\r\nunder the Emperors of Constantinople” and which Richard confirmed\r\nto them by charter.[621] He further secured his conquest by turning\r\nout all the Greek garrisons,[622] replacing them with Franks, and\r\nappointing two Englishmen, Richard de Camville and Robert of Turnham,\r\ngovernors or “keepers” of the island,[623] who were charged to send\r\nregular supplies of the victuals—barley, wheat, sheep, bullocks—which\r\nCyprus produced in abundance, to the Franks in Syria, “where,” adds\r\nthe poet-pilgrim, “they were of great use.”[624] Meanwhile he had\r\nsent Isaac, under the charge of Guy,[625] straight across the sea\r\nto the nearest point on the Syrian coast, the fortress of Markab in\r\nTripoli. The Damsel of Cyprus, who seems to have been almost a child,\r\nwas placed under the care of the two queens and remained with them\r\nthroughout the Crusade.[626] On June 5, the Wednesday in Whitsun\r\nweek, the fleet sailed for Palestine.[627] The various losses\r\nwhich it had sustained in the Mediterranean Sea were compensated by\r\nthe acquisition of the Cypriote navy; the total of ships was now a\r\nhundred and sixty-three, of which thirteen were three-masted busses\r\nand fifty were triremes.[628]\r\n\r\nOne more adventure at sea awaited the king before he reached the\r\nHoly Land. “Full of health, and light as a feather,” he led the way\r\n“as fast as a stag could run” in a direct line across the water\r\ntill Markab was sighted. Thence the fleet sailed down the coast\r\npast Tortosa, Tripoli, and [Sidenote: _June_ 6 or 7] Beyrout.[629]\r\nSuddenly, between Beyrout and Sidon, Richard and his companions in\r\nthe leading galley saw ahead of them a ship of such size “that we\r\nread of no larger one ever existing save the ark of Noah.”[630]\r\nOn a nearer view they perceived that it had three tall masts; one\r\nside of it was covered with green felt or tarpaulin, the other with\r\nyellow;[631] and its whole appearance, to western eyes, was unnatural\r\nand uncanny.[632] Richard’s men hailed it and demanded whence it\r\ncame and where it belonged. “We are Genoese, for Tyre,” was the\r\nanswer. But one of Richard’s oarsmen said: “Hang me, sire, if that\r\nship be not Turkish!” At his suggestion another galley was ordered\r\nto go close up to the ship without hailing her; this was done, and\r\nher crew immediately opened fire on the galley with arbalests and\r\nDamascus bows. Richard’s galley came swiftly up; his men tried to\r\nboard the ship, but in vain. The king swore he would hang them all if\r\nthey let the Turks escape. Again and again they renewed the attack;\r\nat last they fairly stormed the ship, but were driven back again\r\ninto their own vessels. Then Richard bade them make a breach in the\r\nenemy ship’s side or keel; in this they succeeded, and she sank.\r\nSome thirty-five of her officers and engineers were saved and kept\r\nas prisoners by Richard’s orders; the rest of the men on board her\r\nwere either slain or drowned.[633] When the victors reached their\r\ndestination they learned that the ship had been specially built\r\nby order of Saladin’s brother Safadin and despatched from Beyrout\r\nto carry reinforcements and supplies to the besieged Saracens in\r\nAcre, but had been unable to enter the harbour and was, when the\r\nFranks overtook her, cruising about, waiting for an opportunity to\r\nreturn thither;[634] she carried, besides her crew, at least six\r\nhundred and fifty picked soldiers;[635] a man, doubtless one of the\r\nprisoners, who had seen her loaded at Beyrout, said eight hundred,\r\nand further asserted that she contained a hundred camel-loads of arms\r\nof all kinds, victuals and other stores “beyond reckoning,” bottles\r\nfilled with Greek fire, and two hundred “ugly grey serpents” which,\r\naccording to one account, he had himself helped to stow in her, and\r\nwhich were destined to be let loose against the Christian host;[636]\r\nprobably these were some kind of serpent-like contrivances for\r\nthrowing the fire. In the Saracen camp the story of the catastrophe\r\nwas somewhat differently told by a Moslem who represented himself\r\nas its sole survivor, rescued and sent by the Christians to inform\r\nhis people of the disaster which had befallen their cause. He seems\r\nto have stated that the dromond had been sunk by its own captain to\r\nsave it from capture. Saladin’s biographer, however, frankly admits\r\nthat the issue of Richard’s first encounter with Turks was a severe\r\nblow to the defenders of Acre.[637] To Richard and his followers it\r\nmust have seemed a good omen; and it was immediately followed by\r\nanother. At the opening of the fight they had had the wind in their\r\nfaces;[638] suddenly it dropped[639] and then shifted to the north\r\nand carried them before nightfall to Tyre.[640] Here Richard landed,\r\nintending to spend the night in the city, but its keepers refused to\r\nadmit him, asserting that their lord, Conrad of Montferrat, and the\r\nking of France had forbidden them to do so.[641] Next day the wind\r\nstill favoured him and his fleet, and bore them past Scandalion and\r\nCasal Imbert straight to the haven where they would be.[642]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF ACRE\r\n\r\n1191.\r\n\r\n      What brave chief shall head the forces\r\n      Where the Red Cross Legions gather?\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Mount Taurus to the Gulf of Aden, from the river Tigris to\r\nthe Mediterranean sea, and from the Arabian to the Libyan desert,\r\nSaladin was now master of everything except some fragments of\r\nterritory in the north-west of Syria and one sea-port in Galilee.\r\nThe first of these exceptions consisted of a small portion of the\r\nLatin principality of Antioch, including its capital city; south of\r\nthis, a few fortified coast-towns—Markab, Tortosa, Tripoli; and east\r\nof these latter, the little settlement of Ismaïlite warriors who in\r\ntheir stronghold under the shelter of Mount Lebanon defied Franks\r\nand Turks alike, and acknowledged no ruler save their own chieftain,\r\ncalled by western chroniclers “the Old Man of the Mountain.” The one\r\nunconquered city in the Holy Land itself was Tyre.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Crusade was, of course, Jerusalem. Ninety years\r\nbefore, when Islam was split up into a number of separate and rival\r\nstates, all weakened and well-nigh exhausted by constant strife\r\nwith each other, the First Crusaders had attained that goal by a\r\nvictorious land march all the way from Antioch; but now all was\r\nchanged, and it would have been sheer madness for their successors to\r\ndream of following in their steps. Now that the resources of Aleppo,\r\nDamascus, Bagdad, and Cairo were all at the command of one ruler, the\r\nacquisition of a base on the sea-coast in such a position that troops\r\nand supplies could be poured through it from the West direct into the\r\nHoly Land in safety and on a large scale (or what in the twelfth\r\ncentury was accounted such) was an almost indispensable preliminary\r\nto any practical attempt at the re-conquest of Jerusalem. Tyre, with\r\nits peninsular citadel facing the valley which leads round the foot\r\nof Lebanon into Coele-Syria, was somewhat too isolated as well as\r\ntoo far north for this purpose. But some twenty-five miles south of\r\nTyre there was a fortified sea-port whose character and importance\r\nwere summed up by an Arab writer, a few years before it fell into\r\nSaladin’s power, in one significant sentence: “Acre is the column\r\non which the Frankish towns of Syria rest.”[643] Acre stood on the\r\nsite of the ancient Ptolemaïs, at the northern extremity of the wide\r\nsemicircular bay whose southern extremity is the point of Carmel,\r\nand which forms the only real break in the long straight coast-line\r\nof the Holy Land. Its harbour was the best—indeed, the only good\r\none except Tyre and, perhaps, Ascalon—in the whole length of that\r\ncoast-line. Under the Franks it was the chief landing-place for both\r\npilgrims and traders from Europe; for it was the converging-point of\r\nall the main lines of communication between the West and Jerusalem,\r\nMecca, Egypt, and Damascus. For the trade of Damascus it was\r\npractically the only available sea-port, being the only one to and\r\nfrom which access on the land side was not blocked by Mount Lebanon.\r\n“There,” says the Arab visitor quoted above, “put in the tall ships\r\nwhich float like mountains over the sea; it is the meeting-place\r\nof crafts and caravans, the place whither Mussulman and Christian\r\nmerchants congregate from all quarters.”[644] To the natural\r\nadvantages of the site were added fortifications which ranked among\r\nthe mightiest of the many mighty productions of military architecture\r\nreared by the Frank settlers in Syria. The mouth of the harbour was\r\nguarded by a chain; a great tower rose on a tongue of land which ran\r\nout into the sea and sheltered the harbour to westward; the city\r\nlay partly on this peninsula and partly on the mainland, and was\r\nprotected on the land side, to north and east, by strong walls and\r\ntowers, and beyond these by a wide and deep fosse.[645] Saladin had\r\ntaken the place in July 1187; he was fully alive to its importance,\r\nand it was strongly garrisoned and well provisioned when at the end\r\nof August 1189 King Guy of Jerusalem, having made his way down from\r\nAntioch, collecting forces as he went from among the natives of the\r\nland and the newly enlisted Crusaders who during the last year had\r\nbeen arriving in small parties at the few northern sea-ports still\r\nin Christian hands, set to [Sidenote: 1189 _Aug._] work to begin the\r\nre-conquest of his kingdom by laying siege to Acre with about ten\r\nthousand men.[646]\r\n\r\nIt was a great venture of faith; and the faith was justified. Acre at\r\nonce became the rallying-point for all the remaining forces of the\r\nrealm and for the Crusaders who came pouring in from Europe during\r\nthe next few months. Saladin on his part had immediately despatched\r\na large army to occupy the hills which bordered the plain, some\r\neight to ten miles wide, at the back of the town. The besiegers, in\r\ntheir entrenched camp outside the walls and fosse, found themselves\r\npractically besieged in their turn; and this double siege lasted,\r\nwith many vicissitudes and very little real [Sidenote: 1191] progress\r\non either side, till the spring of 1191. By the middle of April, when\r\nPhilip Augustus arrived, the Christian host was sufficiently numerous\r\nto maintain a complete blockade of the city by land and entire\r\ncontrol over the harbour, and thus to prevent the entrance of men\r\nand provisions, either by land or by sea. They had, however, little\r\nprospect of winning the place except by starvation; for they could\r\nnot venture on attempting to capture it by a general assault, because\r\ntheir own encampment was in constant danger from a great host of\r\nfresh troops which Saladin had brought up to occupy the surrounding\r\ncountry as soon as the winter was over. Thus on the evening of\r\nSaturday, June 8,[647] “the valiant king, the Lion-heart,[648]\r\nsaw before him Acre with its towers, and the flower of the world’s\r\npeople seated round about it, and beyond them the hill-peaks and the\r\nmountains and the valleys and the plains, covered with the tents of\r\nSaladin and Safadin and their troops, pressing hard on our Christian\r\nhost.”[649]\r\n\r\nNot the least of the disadvantages under which that host laboured\r\nwas the lack of a commander-in-chief. Neither the character nor the\r\ncircumstances of Guy were such as could enable him to retain that\r\nposition after the influx from Europe had begun; and the supreme\r\ncommand of the siege therefore passed from one to another of the\r\nmore influential leaders of the western contingents by a succession\r\nof temporary arrangements, intended only as makeshifts till the\r\nthree sovereigns who were expected to take the joint leadership of\r\nthe whole expedition should arrive. The greatest of these three,\r\nhowever, the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa, never arrived at all,\r\nhaving been accidentally drowned on the way in June 1190. After the\r\nmain body of the French Crusaders reached Acre in July 1190, the\r\nchief command devolved upon their leader, Count Henry of Champagne,\r\nwhose mother was half-sister to both Philip Augustus and Richard,\r\nand who was thus in some sense a representative of both the kings.\r\nPhilip on his arrival devoted himself to setting up his military\r\nengines, of which he had brought a goodly store, in whatever places\r\nhe deemed most advantageous, and according to one English chronicler,\r\nbuilding a stone house for himself; but he declined to take any\r\nfurther action without his brother-sovereign.[650] Richard had no\r\nsooner passed from the clamorous welcome given him by the whole host\r\nas he landed, and the exchange of courteous greetings with Philip,\r\nthan he plunged at once into practical matters.[651] Having learned\r\nthat Philip was paying his followers three gold bezants apiece every\r\nmonth, [Sidenote: _June 8_] he—seemingly that very night—issued a\r\nproclamation throughout the host offering four bezants a month to\r\nany knight, of any country, who would take service under him.[652]\r\nThe consequence was that nearly all those who were free to dispose of\r\nthemselves and their services “took him for their leader and their\r\nlord.”[653] Among the first to come forward for this purpose were the\r\nGenoese and the Pisans. He declined, however, the homage and fealty\r\nof the Genoese, because it was already pledged to Philip. The Pisans\r\nbecame his liegemen, and “he confirmed to them by his charter the\r\ncustoms which they were wont to have in the land of Jerusalem.”[654]\r\nIt is highly significant that Richard could already, and seemingly\r\nwithout calling forth a protest or even a remark from anyone, make\r\nan assumption of authority in a realm of which he was neither ruler\r\nnor overlord. Scarcely less significant was the action of Henry of\r\nChampagne. Henry—so at least says an English chronicler—having come\r\nto the end of his own resources, had asked his uncle of France for a\r\nsubsidy; Philip offered him a loan of a hundred marks, if he would\r\npledge his county for their repayment. Henry then applied to his\r\nuncle of England, who at once gave him four thousand pounds and a\r\nsupply of food for his men and his horses. Thenceforth [Sidenote:\r\n_June_] the troops of Champagne and their count served under\r\nRichard’s standard, and their own sovereign remained in command\r\nonly of the strictly “French” followers who had come to Acre in his\r\ntrain.[655]\r\n\r\nThe wind which had brought Richard’s galleys swiftly to Acre on\r\nJune 8 changed again before the slower vessels of his fleet could\r\nfollow him, and until they arrived he had no engines of war.[656]\r\nBut “Mategriffon” had been packed on one of the galleys; on the 10th\r\nit was set up, and by daybreak on the 11th his archers were looking\r\ndown into Acre from the tall wooden tower, and “Kill-Greek” was ready\r\nto become “Kill-Turk.” Philip renewed his attacks on the “Accursed\r\nTower,” the chief defence of the city on its [Sidenote: _June 11-14_]\r\neastern side; and all along the line of the walls stone-casters and\r\nminers set vigorously to work. Richard meanwhile “went about among\r\nthe groups, instructing some, criticizing others, encouraging others;\r\nhe seemed to be everywhere and at every man’s side, so that to him\r\nmight fairly be ascribed whatsoever each man was doing.”[657] Within\r\na day or two, however, he was prostrated by a strange illness, a\r\nkind of malarial fever which among other effects caused alopecia\r\nor loss of hair.[658] Much against his wishes, a general assault\r\nwas nevertheless made under Philip’s orders on June 14. It failed,\r\nand so did another three or four days later.[659] Presently Philip\r\nwas attacked by the same malady which had struck down Richard.[660]\r\nIn Richard’s case it seems to have been complicated by his chronic\r\ntrouble, ague;[661] and thus Philip was the first to recover. Richard\r\noccupied part of his time of enforced inactivity in an exchange of\r\ncourtesies with Saladin. Each party was anxious for information\r\nas to the strength, or weakness, of the other; and the courtesies\r\nof chivalry, which were quite as familiar to the Moslem as to the\r\nChristian prince, were utilized by both for this purpose. Saladin\r\nappears to have opened communications by sending a gift of fruit to\r\nthe two royal invalids. Richard was eager for a personal interview\r\n[Sidenote: _June 19-July 21_] with his courteous adversary; this\r\nSaladin refused, on the ground that “kings should not have speech\r\nwith each other till terms of peace between them have been arranged”;\r\nhe consented, however, to a meeting between his brother Safadin and\r\nthe king, but when the time for it came Richard was still too ill\r\nto leave his tent. Richard next despatched to the Saracen camp a\r\nnegro slave as a gift to the Sultan.[662] On the king’s part these\r\nproceedings were unwise, not in themselves, but because they were\r\nliable to be misconstrued by his fellow-Crusaders and to bring upon\r\nhim the suspicions of the other princes in the host, and especially\r\nof Philip Augustus, with whom he was already at variance about a\r\nmuch more serious matter which practically depended upon their joint\r\ndecision. This was nothing less than the disposal of the Crown of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nKing Amalric, who died in 1174, had by his first wife a son, Baldwin,\r\nand a daughter, Sibyl; and by his second wife an infant daughter,\r\nIsabel. The first marriage had been dissolved on the ground of\r\nconsanguinity; in strict law, therefore, Baldwin and Sibyl were\r\nillegitimate; Baldwin, however, became king without opposition,\r\nbecause he was the only male survivor of the royal house. But he was\r\nnot yet fourteen, and he was a leper. In 1176, therefore, an attempt\r\nwas made to provide for the succession by marrying his elder sister\r\nto a member of a distinguished family of Italian Crusaders, William\r\nof Montferrat. Within a year Sibyl was a widow; but she was also the\r\nmother of a son, and in 1183 this child was solemnly crowned and\r\nanointed king in his uncle’s lifetime. This precaution staved off the\r\nimpending crisis for nearly three years, though the imminent prospect\r\nof a long royal minority in the existing political and military\r\ncircumstances of Palestine was felt to be so alarming that the very\r\nPatriarch who had crowned the child became, only a few months later,\r\neager to undo his own work and tried, but without success, to bring\r\nfrom Europe to the dying king and the distracted realm an adoptive\r\nmale heir of full age in the person of one of the descendants of the\r\nfirst marriage of the Angevin Count Fulk V, whose second marriage had\r\nbrought the crown of Jerusalem into the house of Anjou. Baldwin IV\r\ndied before Heraclius returned from Europe, in the winter of 1184-5;\r\nin September 1186 little Baldwin V died also. Sibyl then claimed\r\nthe crown in her own right, as the natural heiress at once of her\r\nchild, her brother, and her father; the Templars, the Patriarch,\r\nand some of the nobles rallied round her at Jerusalem; the people\r\nacclaimed her as queen, and she was crowned in the Church of the Holy\r\nSepulchre together with her second husband, Guy of Lusignan. Sibyl’s\r\nhalf-sister, Isabel, was now fifteen years old, and had been married\r\nthree years. A party among the nobles had ever since King Amalric’s\r\ndeath been biding their time to bring Isabel forward as his only\r\nlegitimate representative and heir. They tried to do so now; they\r\nfailed, however, because her young husband, Humphry of Toron, and\r\nhis step-father and guardian, Reginald of Châtillon, both adhered to\r\nSibyl. But when the sickness which raged in the Christian camp before\r\nAcre in 1190 carried off first the two little daughters of Sibyl and\r\nGuy and then Sibyl herself, Isabel and her partisans found their\r\nopportunity. On the pretext that Isabel had been wedded to Humphry\r\nwithout her consent, the Patriarch declared her [Sidenote: _Nov. 24_\r\n1190] marriage void. Immediately afterwards she married the man who\r\nhad long been Guy’s most implacable rival, Conrad of Montferrat, a\r\nyounger brother of Sibyl’s first husband.\r\n\r\nIn four words the Norman poet-historian of the third Crusade has at\r\nonce pronounced a rare and splendid panegyric on Guy of Lusignan as\r\na man, and given us the clue to Guy’s failure as a statesman. “No\r\nking was endowed with better qualities save for one characteristic\r\nwhich he had: that he knew no evil. That,” adds the poet with a\r\ncharming touch of perhaps unconscious irony, “is what men call\r\nsimpleness.”[663] “Simpleness,” whether as a virtue or a failing,\r\ncan certainly never have been laid to the credit or the charge\r\nof Conrad of Montferrat. He had in 1187 landed with a handful of\r\nfollowers at Tyre when it was literally on the eve of surrendering\r\nto Saladin, and had taken upon himself the command and defence of\r\nthe place with such vigour that Saladin was compelled to raise the\r\nsiege. An Arab historian called him “the mightiest devil of all the\r\nFranks”;[664] an English writer called him “a son of the piercing\r\nand crooked serpent.”[665] His valour and capability, together with\r\nthe possession of Tyre, soon made him a personage of much greater\r\nimportance than the titular king. In birth Conrad was much more than\r\nGuy’s equal; the marquisate of Montferrat, to which he succeeded in\r\n1188, ranked among the chief principalities of the kingdom of Italy,\r\nand his mother was granddaughter to one emperor, sister to another,\r\nand aunt to a third; while Guy was merely the youngest of the five\r\nbrothers of that Geoffrey of Lusignan who had been a ringleader in\r\nalmost every Aquitanian revolt from 1167 onward, and who had finally,\r\nsome months after Conrad’s arrival at Tyre, gone to expiate in\r\nPalestine the last and worst of his offences against Duke Richard.\r\nTo avert civil strife, both parties agreed to submit the whole\r\nquestion of the Crown to the arbitration of the two western kings.\r\nGuy now laid before them a complaint that Conrad had “forcibly and\r\nunjustly taken from him” (probably during his absence in Cyprus) “the\r\nrights and revenues of the kingdom.” His brother Geoffrey appealed\r\nthe marquis of disloyalty, perjury, and treason against the king of\r\nJerusalem and the whole Christian host. Conrad for the moment avoided\r\nanswering the appeal by slipping away to Tyre;[666] its prosecution\r\nwas postponed, and with it the trial of the rival claims to the\r\nCrown; pending a decision, the royal dues and revenues of the market\r\nand port of Acre were sequestrated and entrusted to the Templars and\r\nHospitaliers.[667]\r\n\r\nThe two arbitrators inclined opposite ways. Guy’s “simpleness” had\r\nled him aright when it pointed him, notwithstanding the previous\r\nhostile relations between his family and their overlord in Aquitaine,\r\nto Richard as his natural protector against the Italian claimant\r\nto his Crown. On the other hand, Conrad’s family connexions and\r\nhis talents had secured for him the support of most of the other\r\nprinces in the crusading host; the ceremony of marriage between him\r\nand Isabel had been performed by a French bishop, a near kinsman of\r\nKing Philip.[668] Thus supported, he had, as we have seen, already\r\nventured to set Richard at defiance by preventing him from entering\r\nTyre; and he was now speedily[669] recalled to the camp by Philip,\r\nwho at once openly “took him into familiarity and counsel.” According\r\nto one account it was at Conrad’s instigation that Philip laid claim\r\nto half the island of Cyprus and of the spoils which Richard had\r\nacquired there; the pretext for the claim being the agreement made\r\nat Messina. Richard answered that the said agreement related only to\r\nwhatever he and Philip might acquire in the Holy Land; he offered,\r\nhowever, to satisfy Philip’s demand if Philip would in exchange grant\r\nhim half the county of Flanders and of everything that had escheated\r\nto the French Crown by the recent death of the Flemish count. On this\r\nPhilip dropped his claim and consented to a new arrangement whereby\r\nboth kings explicitly promised to share equally whatever they should\r\nacquire in Palestine. This convention was confirmed by oaths and\r\ncharters, and its fulfilment was safeguarded by a provision that all\r\nconquests and acquisitions made by either party should be placed\r\nunder the charge of the two great Military Orders for safe custody\r\nand division.[670]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Richard’s fleet had arrived, bringing the rest of his\r\nfollowers[671] and his engines of war. These seem to have been\r\nmostly stone-casters and other missile engines worked at long range.\r\nPhilip’s machines were chiefly engines of assault and battery, which\r\nhad to be advanced close up to the walls, and were thus more exposed\r\nto damage and destruction by fire from the enemy. The most effectual\r\nwork of all was that of the miners who had long been making their\r\nway under the walls and especially under the “Accursed Tower.”[672]\r\nThe defences of Acre were now crumbling fast, and the fall of a\r\nlong piece of wall close to that tower, on July 3,[673] coinciding\r\nwith the failure of an attack made by Saladin and his brother on\r\nthe Christian trenches,[674] was [Sidenote: _July 4_] followed next\r\nmorning by an offer from the garrison to surrender the place and all\r\nits contents if their own lives and liberty were spared.[675] The\r\ntwo kings, knowing that the garrison comprised—as a Moslem writer\r\nsays—“the best emirs of the Sultan’s host and the bravest champions\r\nof Islam,”[676] refused the condition.[677] That night another attack\r\non the Christians’ outer trench was successfully beaten off.[678]\r\nThen Richard, sick though he was, determined to try the effect of an\r\nassault on the city under his own personal direction. He caused a\r\nkind of moveable hurdle-shed, called by the French writers _cercloie_\r\nor _circleie_, to be brought up to the edge of the fosse; under cover\r\nof this shelter his crossbowmen could shoot at the tower; he himself,\r\nwrapped in a rich silken quilt, was carried forth and placed among\r\nthem, “and many a bolt was shot by that skilful hand,” the Turks\r\nshooting back all the time.[679] All day long his stone-casters\r\nworked incessantly; so did his miners; at night the mine was fired,\r\nand their efforts were rewarded by the fall of some turrets and a\r\ngreat breach in the curtain wall.[680] Hereupon Richard sent a crier\r\nthrough the host to proclaim a reward for any man who would pull out\r\na stone from a certain piece of wall close to the great tower. The\r\noffer met with a quick response from his own troops and the Pisans,\r\nand before the rest of the host had finished [Sidenote: _July 6_]\r\nbreakfast next morning they had nearly made an entrance into the\r\ncity,[681] when the besieged again signified their desire to treat\r\nfor peace.[682] Again the two emirs in command, Karakoush and\r\nSeiffeddin-el-Meshtoub,[683] came to speak with the kings, and again\r\ntheir offers were refused, seemingly on the understanding that the\r\nmatter was to be referred to Saladin.[684]\r\n\r\nSaladin’s headquarters were at Tell-Ayadiyeh, at the foot of the\r\nhills, some seven or eight miles east of Acre, on the direct road to\r\nDamascus. Twice within the last two days the besieged had warned the\r\nSultan that unless he relieved them at once, they must surrender,\r\nwith his consent or without it.[685] The two kings, knowing that\r\nhis forces were unequal to coping with the united Christian host,\r\nwere at the same time negotiating with him in the hope that the city\r\nmight meanwhile fall into their hands; and he could only endeavour\r\nto stave off its surrender by spinning out the negotiations till the\r\nreinforcements which he was expecting should arrive.[686] No sooner,\r\nhowever, had these begun to come up than on July 8-10 he took the\r\nsignificant step of cutting down the vineyards and orchards around\r\nAcre and levelling most of the towns and smaller fortresses in the\r\nneighbourhood;[687] and on the 11th the besieged intimated their\r\nreadiness to make peace “at the will of the Christian [Sidenote:\r\n_July 12_] kings.” Next morning (12th), in a great assembly at the\r\nTemplars’ quarters, the kings “by the counsel of the whole host” made\r\nan agreement with the two emirs.[688] Acre was to be surrendered\r\nimmediately, and its garrison were to be kept by the Franks as\r\nhostages for the fulfilment of three conditions to which the emirs\r\npledged themselves in Saladin’s name: the restoration of the Holy\r\nCross, the release of sixteen hundred Christians who were prisoners\r\nin the Sultan’s hands, and the payment of two hundred thousand\r\nbezants (or, according to another account, dinars) to the kings and\r\nfourteen (or forty) thousand to Conrad “because the treaty had\r\nbeen made by his mediation.”[689] The emirs returned to the city; a\r\nherald proclaimed throughout the host that all molestation, injury,\r\nor insult to the Turks must cease at once; the gates were opened, the\r\ngarrison, unarmed, were brought out[690] and placed under guard in\r\nthe Christian camp,[691] and the kings sent representatives to take\r\nformal possession of Acre for them by planting their banners on its\r\n[Sidenote: _July 13_] walls and towers.[692] Next day (July 13) they\r\nmade an equal division of the city and all its contents, and also of\r\nthe prisoners (or hostages), and then, seemingly, cast lots for the\r\ntwo halves. The royal palace fell to Richard’s share, the Templars’\r\nhouse to Philip’s; but neither king appears to have taken up his\r\nabode in the city for several days. The prisoners were sent back into\r\nlodgings assigned to them within the walls, and the greater part of\r\nthe host also found quarters there.[693]\r\n\r\nThese prisoners—the late garrison of Acre—were, by the terms of\r\ncapitulation, to be detained till the relic of the Cross, the\r\nstipulated number of Christian captives, and the indemnity, should\r\nall be delivered up by Saladin; then they were to depart free\r\nwith their personal property and their wives and children.[694]\r\nThe fulfilment of the conditions on which their release depended\r\nwas obviously beyond the control of the officers who had made the\r\nagreement. Those officers were understood by the Christians to be\r\nacting with Saladin’s authorization, but it appears that this was\r\nnot the fact; according to Saladin’s friend and biographer Bohadin,\r\nthey communicated the terms to the Sultan and then acted upon them\r\nwithout waiting for his reply, and he was about to send back a flat\r\nrefusal of his sanction to them when he saw the Frank banners on the\r\nwalls.[695] After waiting two days in the hope of some movement which\r\nmight give him a chance of successfully attacking the [Sidenote:\r\n_July 14_] Christian camp, he on the 14th removed his headquarters\r\nfrom Ayadiyeh to Shefr’ Amm, a village in the plain, ten miles\r\nsouth-east of Acre.[696] Thence he sent a messenger to inquire what\r\nwere the terms on which the surrender had been made, and the date\r\nfixed for their fulfilment. On the same day three envoys came from\r\nAcre to speak with him about the Christian prisoners to be released\r\nand the money to be paid; he gave them an honourable reception, and\r\nsent them on to Damascus, that they might inspect the prisoners\r\nthere.[697] Thus he, implicitly if not explicitly, committed himself\r\nto the conditions which had been accepted in his name.\r\n\r\nFriendly embassies continued to pass between the two camps;[698]\r\nbut within the Christian camp there were dissensions. First the\r\nCrusaders who had been at the siege before the kings arrived—some\r\nof them ever since its beginning—claimed a share of the spoil, and\r\nthreatened to desert if it were not given to them. The kings put\r\nthem off with a promise. Then Richard proposed that he, the king\r\nof France, and all the men of their respective armies should bind\r\nthemselves by oath not to leave the Holy Land for three years unless\r\nthe whole of it should before the end of that time be surrendered\r\nby Saladin. Philip, however, refused to take such an oath.[699]\r\nNext day (July 21) Richard with his wife and his sister took up his\r\nabode in the palace.[700] It may have been either on his entry into\r\nthe city on this occasion or on an earlier visit of inspection that\r\nin passing through the streets he noticed on one of the towers a\r\nbanner which he did not recognize, and asked to whom it belonged.\r\nIt was that of Duke Leopold of Austria, by whom the tower had been\r\ntaken. The king ordered the banner to be pulled down and trodden in\r\nthe mire, and further vented his wrath in insulting words addressed\r\nto Leopold himself.[701] He seems to have acted under the impulsion\r\nof one of those fits of unreasonable fury which were part of his\r\nAngevin heritage and by which every member of the Angevin house\r\nwas liable to be occasionally goaded into blunders as well as into\r\ncrimes. Blunder and wrong were united in this case, and were to be\r\ndearly paid for at a later time; for the moment, Leopold was only\r\none of a number of crusading princes and nobles who chafed under\r\nRichard’s control. In spite of all the arrangements for an equal\r\ndivision of authority between the kings it was inevitable that the\r\nsupreme command should fall to Richard, not only because he had the\r\ngreatest number of troops, but also because Philip made no attempt\r\nto assert himself openly with regard to anything except the division\r\nof the spoils.[702] This last was in fact the only matter connected\r\nwith the Crusade which had any real interest for Philip. His one\r\naim was to get back to his own realm, that he might, first, secure\r\nfor himself the heritage of the lately deceased count of Flanders,\r\nand next, make whatever profit could possibly be made out of the\r\nabsence of the duke of Normandy and Aquitaine. His difficulty was\r\nto abandon the expedition without disgracing himself in the eyes of\r\nall Christendom. Four of [Sidenote: _July 22_] his barons went to\r\nthe palace on the day after Richard took up his abode there, with a\r\nmessage of which they seem to have been so ashamed that they could\r\nnot utter it for tears till Richard helped them by anticipating\r\nits tenour—the king of France wanted his counsel and assent for\r\nreturning home. Philip, according to these envoys, said that unless\r\nhe speedily left Syria he would die. “If he leaves undone the work\r\nfor which he came hither,” answered Richard, “he will bring shame\r\nand everlasting contempt upon himself and upon France; so he will\r\nnot go by my counsel. But if he must needs either go or die, let\r\nhim do what best pleases him and [Sidenote: _July 23_] his folk.”\r\nNext day Philip repeated his demand for half [Sidenote: _July 26_]\r\nof Cyprus; which Richard again refused. Three days later Conrad of\r\nMontferrat, on Philip’s advice, came and threw himself at Richard’s\r\nfeet and “asked his pardon” (seemingly for the insult to which the\r\nking had been subjected at Tyre); [Sidenote: _July 27_] Richard\r\ngranted it.[703] On the following day the plea of Conrad against Guy\r\nwas tried in the presence of both the western kings. Conrad claimed\r\nthe kingdom in right of his so-called wife, Isabel; Guy, as having\r\nbeen made king, and done nothing to forfeit his crown. Both put\r\nthemselves on the judgement of the two western sovereigns and the\r\nprelates and nobles of the host. Judgement was given on the morrow\r\n(July 28) in the palace of Richard. Guy was to be king for life;\r\nif he died before Conrad and Isabel they were to succeed him,[704]\r\nand according to one account the crown was to remain with their\r\nheirs;[705] according to another account, if Guy, Conrad, and Isabel\r\nshould all die while Richard was in Holy Land, Richard—evidently\r\nas being head of the house of which the Angevin kings of Jerusalem\r\nwere a younger branch—was to dispose of the realm at his will.[706]\r\nMeanwhile, the royal revenues were to be divided equally between\r\nConrad and Guy.[707] Geoffrey de Lusignan and Conrad were both\r\nconfirmed in the fiefs which they actually held.[708] On the morrow\r\nPhilip made over all that he had acquired in Acre to Conrad, and\r\nagain asked Richard’s leave to go home.[709] Richard is said to have\r\nbeen so dismayed that he offered Philip a half share of everything\r\nhe had gathered together for the Crusade—gold, silver, provisions,\r\narms, horses, ships—if he would abandon his project; but it was in\r\nvain.[710] All that the English king could do was to insist on the\r\nFrench one taking a solemn oath not to invade the Angevin lands\r\nor work any mischief against their owner while the latter was on\r\npilgrimage, nor without forty days’ notice after his return. The\r\noath was sworn, and the duke of Burgundy, the count of Champagne,\r\nand some other French nobles stood surety for its fulfilment.[711]\r\nEach of the kings then detached from his troops a hundred knights\r\nand five hundred men-at-arms and sent them to Bohemond of Antioch\r\nfor the defence of his city and principality; Richard furnished his\r\nshare of this contingent with money enough to pay its expenses up to\r\nthe following Easter, and added a gift of five “large ships” laden\r\nwith horses, arms and food. Finally, the French king’s share of the\r\nprisoners was separated from Richard’s[712] and placed, together with\r\nthe French troops who were to remain in Syria, under the command of\r\nthe duke of Burgundy.[713] On July 31 or August 1 Philip and Conrad\r\nwent, in two galleys lent to them by Richard, to Tyre.[714] There\r\nPhilip procured three Genoese galleys, and with these, on August 3,\r\nhe sailed for Europe.[715]\r\n\r\nHowever much the lesser chieftains and their followers might resent\r\nthe supremacy of Richard—and if we may believe a German report, the\r\nGermans and some of the Italians did resent it so fiercely that\r\nthey would have set upon him openly with their weapons had not\r\nthe Templars intervened[716]—it was now evident that he must be\r\nhenceforth commander-in-chief of the whole Crusade. He at once,\r\nafter holding a council with the other princes, had all [Sidenote:\r\n_Aug. 1-3_] his ships loaded up with provisions for man and beast and\r\nwith his military engines, and issued an order that all the Crusaders\r\nshould make ready to follow him, with their arms and horses, to\r\nAscalon. He also “made all the archers of the host come before him\r\nand gave them good wages.”[717] It was of course impossible to\r\nleave Acre till the treaty with Saladin was carried into effect;\r\nand this was becoming a matter of considerable anxiety. From July\r\n14 to August 2 frequent communications had passed between Saladin\r\nand the kings.[718] An English writer of the time says that Saladin\r\noffered them the whole kingdom of Jerusalem except one fortress (Krak\r\nof Moab, or Montreal) if they would lend him two thousand knights\r\nand five thousand men-at-arms for a twelvemonth to help him against\r\nthe Mussulman enemies in his rear, the sons of Nureddin the lord of\r\nMosul.[719] Such a proposal, if made at all, could hardly be taken\r\nor expected to be taken seriously, and can only have been a device\r\nfor spinning out negotiations and gaining time. A modification of one\r\ndetail of the treaty was, however, granted to the Sultan. The period\r\noriginally allowed him for the delivery of the Cross, the Christian\r\ncaptives, and the money seems to have been one month from the day\r\nof the surrender of Acre;[720] but this was soon perceived to be\r\nimpracticable. On July 24 the Frank envoys who had gone to inspect\r\ntheir imprisoned fellow-Christians at Damascus returned with four\r\nwhom they had picked out for release;[721] and on the same evening\r\na list of the Saracen prisoners in Acre was brought to the Sultan.\r\nOn August 2 envoys from Acre came to him to ascertain whether the\r\nCross was still in his camp or had been sent away to Bagdad. When\r\nsatisfied on this point by ocular demonstration, they told him that\r\nthe kings accepted his proposal to deliver all that was specified in\r\nthe treaty by three monthly instalments. The first instalment was to\r\ncomprise more than two-thirds of the total; it was to consist of\r\nthe Cross, the whole stipulated number of Christian captives, and\r\nhalf the money payment. The term for its delivery was to be August\r\n11[722]—an ingeniously equitable arrangement for both parties,\r\nsince, the duration of the Mohammedan calendar month differing from\r\nthat of the western peoples, the period from the surrender of Acre\r\nwould be a month and a day[723] according to the reckoning of the\r\nMoslems whose part in the treaty must be the most difficult and\r\nlengthy of accomplishment, and one day less than a month according\r\nto the reckoning of the Franks, who had most to gain by a speedy\r\nfulfilment of the conditions.[724] Richard presently grew uneasy as\r\nto the possibility of fulfilling the Franks’ side of the compact on\r\nthe appointed day; for Philip, after formally giving the charge of\r\nhis share of the prisoners to the duke of Burgundy,[725] had carried\r\nthem, or at least the most important and valuable of them, away with\r\nhim to Tyre and left them there in the custody of Conrad.[726] On\r\nAugust 5 Richard despatched envoys to Tyre to request that Conrad\r\nwould at once return to Acre and bring these prisoners with him.\r\nConrad flatly refused. Richard’s [Sidenote: _Aug. 6_] first impulse,\r\nwhen his envoys came back next day, was to go and bring the marquis\r\nto submission by force. But Conrad was a dangerous person to quarrel\r\nwith, owing to his position as heir to the Crown, and still more\r\nbecause, as master of Tyre, he could stop the coming of provisions\r\nfor the host; he was in fact already doing this again, as he had\r\ndone in the earlier days of the siege. Hugh of Burgundy therefore\r\nundertook the task of inducing Conrad to give up the prisoners to\r\nhim as the representative of their proper owner, Philip.[727] He set\r\nout for Tyre on August 8, but did not get back with the prisoners\r\ntill the 12th.[728] According to the letter of the treaty, however—at\r\nleast, according to the Franks’ understanding of it—the presence of\r\nall the Saracen prisoners on the 11th was not really necessary; for\r\ntheir release was to be conditional on, and should therefore have\r\nbeen preceded by, Saladin’s fulfilment of his part of the bargain.\r\nOn the 11th therefore Richard called upon Saladin to do what he had\r\npromised for that day. Saladin replied that he would do so only on\r\none of two conditions: either that the Franks should at once release\r\nthe captive garrison of Acre, in which case he would give other\r\nhostages for the completion of his payments; or that the Franks\r\nshould give him hostages to keep till the garrison were set free.\r\nThe Franks rejected both these propositions, offering instead, in\r\nreturn for what was now due from the Sultan, to give a solemn oath\r\nthat the prisoners should be restored to him; but this he, having no\r\nconfidence in their good faith, would not accept.[729] The discussion\r\nseems to have ended for the time in a postponement of the “first\r\nterm” (as Bohadin calls it) till August 20.[730]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Richard led his own troops out of the city and pitched\r\nhis tents near the enemy’s lines. A western [Sidenote: _Aug.\r\n15_] writer tells us that next day Saladin begged for a further\r\nprolongation of the term, which Richard sternly refused; Saladin\r\nthen asked for a colloquy with Richard on the [Sidenote: _Aug. 16_]\r\nmorrow, but failed to keep the tryst, and excused his failure by\r\ndeclaring, “I did not come, because I could not fulfill the agreement\r\nwhich my people had made with him.”[731] The next two days seem to\r\nhave been occupied in skirmishes in which the king took his full\r\nshare.[732] [Sidenote: _Aug. 20_] Saladin’s advanced guard had now\r\nbeen withdrawn from Ayadiyeh to another height, Keisan, some two\r\nmiles further south. On the morning of the 20th—the day finally\r\nfixed for the expiration of the “first term”—Richard sent his tents\r\nto the pits at the foot of the hill which the Saracens had quitted.\r\nNoon passed without a word or sign from Saladin. After mid-day the\r\nwatchers on Keisan saw Richard come out on horseback with what to\r\nthem looked like “the whole Frankish host” into the middle of the\r\nplain between Keisan and Ayadiyeh. They at once sent word to the\r\nSultan, and were anxiously awaiting instructions and reinforcements\r\nfrom him when they saw the Moslem prisoners, bound with cords, led\r\nforth into the midst of the host and instantly slaughtered with\r\nswords and spears. Saladin’s reinforcements came too late to do\r\nanything except unite with the troops at Keisan in a futile, though\r\ngallant, effort to avenge the massacre by an attack so fierce and\r\npersistent that it was not beaten off till nightfall.[733]\r\n\r\nThe victims of this wholesale execution comprised the entire\r\nMoslem garrison of Acre except a few persons of distinction who\r\nwere specially reserved for ransom. Richard himself stated the\r\nnumber of the slain to be about two thousand six hundred.[734]\r\nBohadin, whose computation is doubtless that of the Moslem troops\r\nwho visited the place of slaughter next morning, says “more than\r\nthree thousand.”[735] This writer, whose narrative we have been\r\nfollowing, and who was Saladin’s confidential secretary and constant\r\ncompanion, says that in this matter “the English king, seeing all\r\nthe delays interposed by the Sultan to the execution of the treaty,\r\nacted perfidiously with regard to his Mussulman prisoners.” This\r\ncharge of perfidy is based upon a clause which occurs only in the\r\nsame writer’s account of the terms of the capitulation of Acre;\r\naccording to him, the garrison were thereby promised that in any\r\ncase their lives should be spared; if the Sultan failed to do his\r\npart of the agreement, their fate was to be slavery.[736] The Frank\r\nwriters know nothing of this stipulation. Two of them distinctly\r\nassert that the promise of life to the garrison was made conditional\r\non Saladin’s fulfilment of the bargain.[737] Another says they were\r\nto go out free and unharmed if the agreement were carried out within\r\nthe term, but if not, they were to be at the mercy of the kings\r\nfor their limbs and lives.[738] The others simply speak of them as\r\nhostages. If the Frankish version of this matter be the correct one,\r\nthen the persistent “delays interposed by the Sultan to the execution\r\nof the treaty” had unquestionably, on the principles universally\r\nrecognised by both Franks and Saracens, rendered the lives of\r\nthese hostages legally forfeit at mid-day on August 20. Bohadin’s\r\nadmission about the “delays” is practically an acknowledgement\r\nthat they would have been so but for the special promise which he\r\nalleges to have been made to these men. Even if that promise were\r\ngiven, indeed, a feudal lawyer might have made out a case for\r\nRichard and his colleagues in the war-council, on the plea that the\r\nmoment the garrison became legally slaves, they became, as such,\r\nthe absolute property of their masters, to be kept alive or slain\r\nat their masters’ will; and a Mussulman lawyer might have had even\r\nmore difficulty than a Christian one in finding an answer to such\r\na plea. It is, however, quite possible that the treaty—drawn up as\r\nit was, in haste, in two different languages, between parties who\r\ncould only hold communication through interpreters[739]—may have\r\nbeen honestly understood by the Moslems in one sense and by the\r\nChristians in another. As for Richard’s personal responsibility in\r\nthe matter, Bohadin certainly exaggerates it. The other princes of\r\nthe Crusade clearly concurred in the determination of the hostages’\r\nfate.[740] The cruelty of such wholesale slaughter shocked neither\r\ntheir moral sense nor that of their contemporaries; the chroniclers\r\nof the time all record the massacre without a word or a hint of\r\nreprobation; one at least who was himself in the host openly rejoices\r\nover it as a just vengeance for the Crusaders slain during the siege\r\nby the crossbows of the garrison.[741] With the leaders every other\r\nconsideration would probably be outweighed by a military one. Until\r\nthese prisoners were disposed of in some safe way, the Crusade must\r\nbe at a standstill. They could not be left in Acre or anywhere else\r\nwithout a guard far more numerous than it was possible to spare from\r\nthe main enterprise. Saladin’s conduct had extinguished the hope\r\nof disposing of them by exchange. The only sure way was to follow\r\nan example set by him, though on a much smaller scale, four years\r\nbefore, when he put to death all the Templars and Hospitaliers who\r\nhad been captured in the battle of Hattin.[742] So the deed was done;\r\nand that same night a herald proclaimed throughout the host that on\r\nthe morrow all must be ready to set out for Ascalon.[743]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFROM ACRE TO JOPPA\r\n\r\n1191\r\n\r\n      Lignum Crucis, Signum Ducis,\r\n        Sequitur exercitus,\r\n      Quod non cessit, sed praecessit\r\n        In vi Sancti Spiritus.\r\n                    _Berter of Orleans._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo main roads led southward from Acre. One crossed the river Kishon\r\nat a point which on the map is about half way between Nazareth and\r\nthe sea, passed over the middle of Mount Carmel, and then along\r\nthe eastern side of the plain which lies between the coast and the\r\nmountain-range of Samaria and Judea. Cross-paths through the defiles\r\nof this range led from the road to the Holy Places of southern\r\nPalestine—Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron—and connected it with the\r\ngreat lines of communication running through these places southward\r\nto Egypt and Mecca and northward up the Jordan valley to Damascus;\r\npaths across the plain connected it with the other great main road,\r\nwhich followed the coast-line all the way to the mouth of the Nile.\r\nThe inland route was the more direct way to Jerusalem; but for the\r\nCrusaders the coast route was the safer, indeed the only safe one.\r\nThe re-conquest of the land must begin with the re-conquest of the\r\nseaboard towns. Acre might serve as principal base for the whole\r\nexpedition; but this was not enough; before the Crusaders could\r\nventure into the interior of the land they must make sure of being\r\nable to communicate with Cyprus and with Europe through other ports\r\nbesides Acre, and with Acre itself by sea as well as by land. They\r\nmust also endeavour to block at least one of the enemy’s lines\r\nof communication with Egypt; and of these the most frequented and\r\nimportant was the coast route, to which the entrance from Egypt, both\r\nby land and sea, was commanded by the great fortress of Ascalon. Thus\r\nthe plan of campaign implied in the order issued on the night of\r\nAugust 20 was to regain, first and foremost, the whole seaboard of\r\nthe Holy Land.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications of Acre had been carefully repaired under\r\nRichard’s personal superintendence;[744] and the other preparations\r\nfor departure were so far advanced that one day sufficed to complete\r\nthem. The two queens and the damsel of Cyprus were left in the\r\npalace, with the king’s treasure, under suitable guard. Bertram de\r\nVerdon and Stephen de Longchamp were appointed constables of the\r\ncity.[745] Every man in the host was bidden to take with him food\r\nfor ten days; the ships were already loaded up with the rest of the\r\nstores, and their skippers were instructed [Sidenote: _Aug. 21_] to\r\nsail close along the shore, ready to put in at intervals and supply\r\nthe host with whatever it might need. “Thus they were to go,” says\r\none of the pilgrims, “in two bodies, one by sea and one by land; for\r\nSyria could be reconquered from the Turks in no other manner.”[746]\r\nThe total number of the Frank forces is reckoned by the same\r\nauthority at three hundred thousand.[747] On Thursday August 22 they\r\nbegan to cross the “river of Acre” (the Belus, or Nahr el Namein,\r\nwhich falls into the sea just below the city) and pitch their tents\r\nbetween it and the sea.[748] A large proportion of them, however,\r\nhad become already so demoralised by their stay in the city, now\r\nonce more filled with all the luxuries and temptations of Eastern\r\nlife, that they were [Sidenote: _Friday Aug. 23_] very reluctant to\r\nleave it; and it was not till the next day that Richard succeeded in\r\ngetting the greater part of the host together in its new encampment,\r\nand himself followed it thither, having taken his position in\r\nthe rear to guard against possible attack from the Moslems.[749]\r\nThe detachment at Keisan was, however, too small to venture upon\r\nanything more than a harmless demonstration at a safe distance;[750]\r\n[Sidenote: _Sat. Aug. 24_] and it was altogether withdrawn next\r\nday, when Saladin, being now assured of the route which the Franks\r\nintended to take, disposed his army on the hills above Shefr’ Amm,\r\nready to attack them on their march along the shore.[751] They seem\r\nnot to have started till Sunday, August 25.[752] Richard led the\r\nvanguard; his English and Norman followers had charge of the great\r\nStandard which was surmounted by his royal banner and was to serve\r\nas guide and rallying-point for the whole host. The Frenchmen under\r\nthe duke of Burgundy formed the rearguard. They soon found themselves\r\nin difficulties. The roads of Palestine had been originally good\r\nRoman ones; but by the closing years of the twelfth century even the\r\nhighroads had become in many places little more than trackways. The\r\ntransport corps, struggling through an awkward passage, fell into\r\nconfusion; at the critical moment the Saracens swooped down, cut\r\nthem off from the rearguard, and drove them towards the sea. One\r\nJohn FitzLuke spurred forward and told Richard what had occurred;\r\n“and the king with his meinie galloped back at a great pace; he fell\r\nupon the Turks like a thunderbolt—I know not how many he slew”;[753]\r\n“and they fled before him like the Philistines of old from the\r\nface of the Maccabee.”[754] The Franks re-formed in order, and\r\nproceeded [Sidenote: _Aug. 25_] without further interruption till\r\nthey found a convenient camping-ground, seemingly near the mouth of\r\nthe Kishon, whence a short day’s march brought them to Cayphas, the\r\nmodern Haïfa. Here they encamped for two days between the castle,\r\nwhich they found deserted, and the sea. This first brief stage of\r\ntheir journey from Acre—it is only about ten miles—had taught them\r\nat least one practical lesson: that on a march along the burning\r\nsand of the Syrian coast in August superfluous baggage was to be\r\navoided. They therefore discarded everything that was not strictly\r\nnecessary. The fight on the way had also another good result; it had\r\nhealed Richard’s feud with William des Barres. William had fought\r\nwith such valour that the king’s admiration had overcome his anger,\r\nand the gallant Frenchman was received back into favour by the\r\nLion-Heart.[755]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday August 27 the Crusaders set out again, and wound their\r\nway unmolested round the point of Carmel to Capharnaum, a distance\r\nof about eight miles; finding this place also deserted, they stopped\r\nthere to dine; and thence another march of four miles brought them\r\nto a spot where in later days the Templars were to rear a famous\r\nfortress known as Athlit, or Pilgrims’ Castle, but which the earlier\r\npilgrims called the Casal (village) of the Straits—why, it is\r\nhard to guess, for the distance from the shore to the foot of the\r\nCarmel range increases all the way from Capharnaum southward, so\r\nthat even from the north the approach to Athlit is much less of a\r\n“strait” than the pass which the host had just come through round the\r\npromontory.[756] The site indeed afforded an ample and convenient\r\ncamping-ground, and also a place where the ships could put in. This\r\nthey had been ordered to do, so the host waited there two [Sidenote:\r\n_Aug. 27_] days to receive from them a fresh store of provisions.[757]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aug. 24_]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Saladin had on the night of the 24th removed his\r\nheadquarters from Shefr’ Amm to Kaimoun (the ancient Jokneam of\r\nCarmel), where the inland road from Acre to [Sidenote: _Aug. 25_]\r\nthe south crosses the Kishon. Next day he rode over Carmel on a\r\nreconnoitring expedition to Mallâha, “the Salt-pit,” called by the\r\nFranks Merle. Returning on the 26th to Kaimoun, he there reviewed\r\nhis army, and on the [Sidenote: _Aug. 28_] morrow led it across the\r\nmountains to “the head of the river which runs by Caesarea.”[758]\r\nCaesarea lies, fifteen miles south of the Casal of the Straits,\r\nmidway between the mouths of two rivers which are five miles\r\napart. The northern one was called by the Crusaders “the River of\r\nCrocodiles”;[759] between its two principal springs passes [Sidenote:\r\n_Aug. 28-30_] the main road leading south from Kaimoun. In the next\r\nthree days Saladin shifted his camp three times among the hills\r\nabove these springs.[760] From these hills, or from the last spur of\r\nCarmel, a little further south, he would see his first opportunity\r\nof checking or hindering his enemy’s advance. The slopes of the\r\nCarmel range were too steep to be practicable for his cavalry; it\r\nwas doubtless for this reason that Cayphas and Capharnaum had been\r\nevacuated, and also that the fortifications of Caesarea had been\r\ndismantled.[761] When the Crusaders should reach Caesarea, however,\r\nthey would be on the verge of Sharon, “the Level,” on whose eastern\r\nborder the comparatively low mountains of Samaria rise by a gradual\r\nascent, in terrace-like ridges, broken by many easy passes leading\r\ninto the valleys and level spaces among the hills; while the distance\r\nbetween mountains and sea, which round the promontory of Carmel is\r\nonly two hundred yards, is at the lower end of the Carmel range\r\nsix miles. On August 28 Richard advanced from Casal of the Straits\r\nto Merle and spent the night on the ground where Saladin had been\r\nthree nights before. [Sidenote: _Aug. 29_] Next day the whole host\r\nfollowed, and with the king at its head and the Knights of the Temple\r\nand Hospital forming the rearguard proceeded towards Caesarea. By\r\nRichard’s orders all the sick had been transferred to the ships; but\r\neven for the able-bodied the day’s march—some fifteen miles—was a\r\nlong, slow, and painful one over the burning sand in the heat of an\r\nAugust day in Syria; not a few died by the way; and the outskirts\r\nof the host were attacked by some skirmishing parties of Turks, who\r\nwere, however, driven off by Richard. The weary pilgrims camped that\r\n[Sidenote: _Aug. 30_] night on the bank of the River of Crocodiles,\r\nand next day entered the ruins of Caesarea, which were evacuated at\r\ntheir approach. Here on that evening or the next the ships came into\r\nport, bringing further supplies and also some of the “lazy folk” from\r\nAcre, who in response to an urgent summons sent to them by Richard\r\nhad thus at length come to rejoin their comrades in arms.[762]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sept. 1_]\r\n\r\nWith these reinforcements the march was resumed on Sunday, September\r\n1. On the preceding day Saladin had taken up a position on the hills\r\nwhence he could, as soon as the Franks issued from Caesarea, make\r\nit impossible for them to avoid an encounter. They had scarcely set\r\nout when they were well-nigh surrounded by his light cavalry, and\r\na shower of arrows fell upon them from all directions.[763] But his\r\nattack proved less effective than he had hoped, owing to the order\r\nof march which the Crusaders had now adopted. The princes, knights,\r\nand mounted men-at-arms advanced between two columns of infantry, of\r\nwhich one, marching on their left—the side nearest to the hills and\r\nthe enemy—“protected them,” says an eye-witness, “as with a wall.”\r\nThese foot-soldiers in their thick felt jerkins and mailcoats recked\r\nlittle of the Turkish arrows, while the heavier missiles which they\r\nhurled at their assailants in return wrought execution on both horses\r\nand riders. On the other side of the cavalry, along the sea-shore,\r\nmarched another body of foot-soldiers who carried the baggage, and,\r\nbeing safe from attack, were always comparatively fresh, and ready to\r\nchange places with their comrades on the exposed side when the latter\r\nwere worn out with fatigue or wounds. Of the cavalry thus enclosed,\r\nthe van consisted of the knights of the kingdom of Jerusalem under\r\nKing Guy; the rearguard was composed of the mounted troops of Galilee\r\nand others, including no doubt the Military Orders; in the centre\r\nwere the king of England, the duke of Burgundy, and their followers,\r\nwith the Standard in their midst. Thus, slowly and cautiously, the\r\nhost moved along; on this first day it advanced only about two or\r\nthree miles, to the “river of Caesarea.”[764] This seems to be what\r\nis now called the Nahr el Mefjir; the Crusaders called it the Dead\r\nRiver, perhaps because the Turks—such at least is the pilgrims’\r\naccount of the matter—had done their utmost to choke it up and\r\nconceal its existence, so as to make it a trap for the strangers to\r\nfall into; but the trap may have been the work of nature, for the\r\nstream appears to be the same to which Bohadin gives the name of Nahr\r\nel Casseb, river of reeds or rushes. The host reached this stream\r\nat [Sidenote: _Sept. 1_] mid-day, crossed it in safety, and pitched\r\ntheir tents on its southern bank: whereupon the Turks retired,\r\n“for,” says Bohadin, “whenever they were in camp, there was no hope\r\nof doing anything with them.” That afternoon Saladin shifted his\r\nheadquarters to a place a little higher up on [Sidenote: _Sept. 1-3_]\r\nthe same river;[765] and for two nights both parties remained in\r\ntheir respective encampments, close to each other, but quiescent.\r\n\r\nThus far the pilgrims had been journeying along the edge of a\r\nplain consisting chiefly of moors, marshes, and sand. Before them\r\nlay a tract of more wooded country, and also, it seems, a part of\r\nthe coast-road so neglected and overgrown with brushwood as to be\r\nimpassable for their heavy cavalry. It appears that in consequence\r\nthey made their way up the left bank of the Dead River till they\r\nstruck the inland road.[766] Here they were much nearer to the\r\nhills and to the enemy. But Saladin had no mind to risk a general\r\nengagement till he had collected all his forces on a battle-ground of\r\nhis own choosing; and on that same [Sidenote: _Sept. 3_] day he again\r\nremoved his camp further south, into the midst of a great forest\r\nwhere he hoped to intercept the Christians on their way to the city\r\nwhich must be their next objective, Arsuf. His cavalry continued to\r\nhang about the Christian host[767] and harassed it incessantly on\r\nits march; yet the pilgrims plodded on, keeping in the same order\r\nas before, never breaking it except when the enemy’s attacks became\r\nso intolerable that the infantry had to open its ranks to let the\r\ncavalry pass through for a charge. On one of these occasions Richard\r\nwas wounded in the left side by a Turkish javelin, but so slightly\r\nthat the wound only inflamed his eagerness for the fight, and all day\r\nhe was constantly driving off the assailants.[768] At nightfall they\r\nretired, and the host encamped near the “Salt River”—now the Nahr\r\nIskanderuneh—which runs down to the plain from Shechem and falls\r\ninto the sea seven or eight miles south of Caesarea. Here, again,\r\nthey stayed two nights (September 3-5). The horses had suffered more\r\nseverely than the men from the Turkish missiles; the badly wounded\r\nones were now killed and sold by their owners to the men of lower\r\nrank for food; owing to the rush for them and the high prices charged\r\nthere was much strife over this matter, till Richard checked it by\r\nproclaiming that he would give a live horse to any man who would make\r\na present of a dead one to his poorer comrades in arms.[769]\r\n\r\nFrom the Salt River a tract of wild wooded country called the Forest\r\nof Arsuf stretched southward for twelve miles or more. Saladin had\r\ntaken up his position on a hill almost in the middle of it; here\r\nhis foot-soldiers had rejoined him on the morning of September 4;\r\nand here, on the same day, he received a message from the Christian\r\nprinces asking for a parley about terms of peace between him and\r\nthe native Franks of the kingdom, “such as might enable those from\r\nover-sea to return to their homes.” They were [Sidenote: _Sept.\r\n5_] evidently becoming awake to the extreme difficulty of their\r\nenterprise; and the Sultan’s apparent reluctance to engage in a\r\npitched battle may have raised hopes of a peaceful settlement with\r\nhim. He, on his part, was glad of anything to delay their further\r\nadvance till the Turcoman reinforcements which he was expecting\r\nhad arrived; so a meeting took place between Richard and Safadin,\r\nwith Humphry of Toron as interpreter, early on Thursday, September\r\n5. Richard spoke first; at the mention of peace Safadin asked,\r\n“What conditions am I to propose to the Sultan in your name?” “One\r\ncondition only,” answered Richard, “that you restore the whole land\r\nto us, and go back to your own country.” This brought the conference\r\nto an abrupt end; Safadin returned to his brother,[770] and the\r\nChristians set forward on their march through the Forest. They seem\r\nto have traversed it in a south-westerly direction which brought\r\nthem back to the coast-road. A report had reached them that the\r\nenemy intended to set fire to the Forest “and make of it such a blaze\r\nthat they would all be roasted”; but nothing of the kind took place;\r\n“no host ever had a better day’s march; they met with no hindrance\r\nat all”; they passed the “Hill of Arsuf”—seemingly the hill which\r\nSaladin was occupying—and came safely out on the plain, where they\r\nfound a good camping-ground beside what they called “the River of the\r\nCleft Rock” (Rochetaillie).[771] They soon learned why they had been\r\nthus left unmolested through the day’s march; Saladin was disposing\r\nhis whole force—estimated by a scout at three hundred thousand men,\r\nwhile the Christians were only about a third of that number[772]—to\r\ngive them battle as soon as they should emerge from the cover of the\r\nForest into the open fields and cultivated land around Arsuf. It\r\nwas therefore in very carefully planned array that they set forth\r\nagain on Saturday, September 7.[773] The host was divided into five\r\nbattalions; the vanguard consisted of the Templars; next came the\r\nBretons and Angevins; then the Poitevins, who were placed under the\r\ncommand of King Guy; after these the Normans and English with the\r\nStandard; in the rear the troops of the Hospital. Every battalion\r\nwas subdivided into two squadrons, one of horse, one of foot, which\r\nadvanced parallel to each other; the duke of Burgundy and some picked\r\nfollowers rode up and down and round about the host to regulate and\r\ndirect its movements according to what they saw of those of the\r\nTurks; and Count Henry of Champagne acted as special “side-guard” on\r\nthe flank nearest to the hills, where he rode continually alongside\r\nof the foot-soldiers.[774]\r\n\r\nSaladin, meanwhile, had rapidly disposed his forces so as to occupy\r\nthe hills parallel with the Crusaders’ line of march from the River\r\nof the Cleft Rock to Arsuf. By the coast-road the distance between\r\nthese two places is little more than four miles. Setting out probably\r\nat dawn, the Christian vanguard reached the outskirts of Arsuf before\r\nnine o’clock, and some of the footmen began to pitch the tents among\r\nthe fields and gardens.[775] Then the Saracen archers swarmed down\r\nupon the flank of the advancing host, pouring on it an overwhelming\r\nshower of arrows.[776] It was, however, in the rear that Saladin\r\nhoped to deliver his most effectual blow. Here his line curved round\r\nfrom the hills towards the mouth of the river, so that, as a Frank\r\nwriter says, the Christian rearguard, “packed together so closely\r\nthat you could not have thrown an apple at it without hitting either\r\na man or a horse,” filled the whole space between the sea-shore and\r\nthe enemies.[777] Thus surrounded, the crossbowmen and archers in the\r\nrearguard struggled on for hours, constantly compelled to turn round\r\nand sometimes to march backwards, returning as best they could the\r\ncontinuous fire of missiles in their rear. At length it ceased, only\r\nto be succeeded by an attack at close quarters from another body of\r\nTurks with maces and swords, who fell upon the foot-soldiers of the\r\nHospital in overwhelming force. Once already the Knights had sent a\r\nmessage to Richard, begging for leave to disperse their assailants\r\nby a charge, but it had been refused. Now the Grand Master himself\r\nspurred forward and urged the same request. “Be patient, good Master;\r\none cannot be everywhere,” was the reply. Richard was determined not\r\nto risk a charge till he saw the fitting moment for a general one\r\nall along the line. It had been pre-arranged that when the charge\r\nwas to take place, two trumpets should be sounded in the van, two\r\nin the centre, and two in the rear, so as to be heard above and\r\ndistinguished from the din of the innumerable Turkish brass drums\r\nand other noisy instruments, and to let the three divisions of the\r\nhost know their relative positions. At last the leaders decided that\r\nthe moment had come, and the signal was about to be given, when the\r\nMarshal of the Hospital and a Norman knight, Baldwin le Caron,[778]\r\nburst through the ranks without waiting for it, and shouting “Saint\r\nGeorge!” dashed into the midst of the enemy. The other knights at\r\nonce turned their horses and followed the rash example. For a moment\r\nthe whole rearguard was in confusion, and a great disaster seemed\r\nimminent; but Richard’s promptitude retrieved the day.[779] The\r\ntrumpets were sounded so instantaneously that the Turks seem never\r\nto have discovered what had really precipitated the charge.[780]\r\nWhile Richard himself, “quicker than quarrel from crossbow,” spurred\r\nat the head of his picked followers to what had now become the\r\nvan instead of the rear, and drove off its assailants—the Turkish\r\nright wing—with great slaughter,[781] the rest of the Frank cavalry\r\ncharged the Turkish centre and left wing and put them both to\r\nheadlong flight, also with heavy loss of life. Saladin’s secretary\r\nand friend, Bohadin, escaping from the rout of the centre, tried\r\nto rejoin first the left wing and then the right, but found each\r\ndivision in worse plight than the one he had quitted; and when he\r\nreached the reserve he found there only seventeen men remaining to\r\nguard the Standard, all the rest having been called up by the Sultan\r\nto support their comrades, and shared their fate. Saladin tried hard\r\nto rally the fugitives, and when the Franks, having also rallied to\r\ntheir Standard, re-formed their ranks and sought to continue their\r\nmarch, they were impeded by repeated attacks which they had to turn\r\nand repel. At last another charge, led by William des Barres and\r\nRichard on the famous Fauvel, which he had brought with him from\r\nCyprus, drove the assailants and carried the pursuers right up into\r\nthe hills. There the dangers of the unknown and difficult ground were\r\ntoo great for the Franks to venture on an engagement; they therefore\r\nwithdrew from the pursuit, and proceeded along the lower ground till\r\nthe whole host was encamped outside Arsuf,[782] Saladin making no\r\nfurther attempt to molest them. He had succeeded in collecting all\r\nthat was left of his army; but his losses were very heavy, and they\r\nincluded several emirs, while among the Christian slain was only one\r\nman of distinction, James of Avesnes.[783] Richard’s assertion that\r\nthe battle of Arsuf had cost Saladin more lives of noble Saracens\r\nthan he had lost in any one day for the last forty years[784] may\r\nnot be literally exact; but Bohadin does not attempt to minimize\r\n[Sidenote: _Sept. 7_] the disaster or to disguise its effect on the\r\nsurvivors and on Saladin himself. “God alone knows what intense grief\r\nfilled his heart. All our men were wounded, if not in their bodies,\r\nin their hearts.”[785]\r\n\r\nThat night Saladin pushed on as far as the Nahr el Aoudjeh, crossed\r\nit, and encamped on its southern bank.[786] This river is called by\r\nthe Frank writers “the River of Arsuf,” but might have more fittingly\r\ntaken its name from Joppa, for its mouth is seven miles south of the\r\nformer place and only three miles north of the latter. It is formed\r\nby the union of three streams, one of which rises at the foot of the\r\nhills of Samaria, another in the valley which divides Mount Ephraim\r\nfrom the Judean range, and the third flows through the northernmost\r\nof the passes leading from the plain into the hill-country of Judah.\r\nThe inland road through the plain crosses these three streams some\r\nthree miles above their meeting-point, and a road branching off from\r\nthe crossing-place runs alongside of the southernmost stream up the\r\npass, and thence over the plateau to Jerusalem. Saladin appears\r\nto have thought that the Franks might march across the plain and\r\nattempt an advance [Sidenote: _Sun., Sept. 8_] upon the Holy City by\r\nthis route; next day he re-crossed the river and took up a position\r\nnearer to Arsuf, ready to intercept them.[787] They, however, had\r\nno such intention. They spent that Sunday at Arsuf, keeping the\r\nfeast of our Lady’s Nativity, and burying their dead hero, James of\r\nAvesnes. On Monday the 9th they resumed their southward march,[788]\r\npursued it steadily despite the provocations of the Saracen bowmen,\r\nand encamped that night on both sides of the river near its mouth.\r\nHereupon Saladin, perceiving that their immediate objective was Joppa\r\nand that he could not prevent them from reaching it, let [Sidenote:\r\n_Tues., Sept. 10_] them proceed thither unmolested and encamp\r\nnext day outside its ruined walls (for, like Arsuf and the more\r\nnortherly coast-towns, it had been evacuated and dismantled some time\r\nbefore),[789] while he with all his forces hurried to take up his\r\nposition at Ramlah,[790] whence he could easily watch all the three\r\npossible routes of the Christians’ next advance. Two of these routes\r\nled—one through Ramlah itself—to Jerusalem; the third led coastwise\r\nto Egypt. Either of the two former Saladin might hope either to block\r\nor defend; but with the third it was otherwise. The plain south of\r\nthe Nahr el Aoudjeh is much wider than further north: Joppa is ten\r\nmiles from the foot of the hills; between Joppa and Ascalon the width\r\nof the plain varies from ten to eighteen miles. The character of\r\nthe country, too, is different; instead of sand-dunes, marshland,\r\nmoorland, and forest, the way lies through cornfields, palm-groves,\r\nvillages and towns. It was thus not a place where the Saracen mode\r\nof warfare could be made effective against that of the Franks in a\r\npitched battle; yet if the Franks decided to continue their march\r\ndown the coast, nothing but defeat in a pitched battle could prevent\r\nthem from laying siege to Ascalon.\r\n\r\nAscalon was a post of far greater importance than any other on the\r\nwhole coast south of Acre. It was the key to Egypt, the only sea-port\r\nof any consequence between Joppa and Alexandria, the only fortified\r\ncity, now that Caesarea was destroyed, on the whole length of the\r\ncoast between Acre and the Egyptian frontier. To the Arabs Ascalon\r\nwas “Syria’s Summit,” “Syria’s Bride.” Strong as were her walls,\r\nSaladin knew that the garrison within them was wholly inadequate\r\nfor their defence, and that an attempt to reinforce it might lead\r\nto trouble with his army, owing to the unwillingness of men who had\r\nseen the fate of their brethren at Acre to incur the risk of a like\r\ndestiny by shutting themselves up in another great fortress;[791]\r\nand he knew, too, that if the Franks did besiege the place, his\r\ntroops would be unable to harass them from the hills as they had done\r\nat Acre, the hills opposite Ascalon being more than fifteen miles\r\ndistant. He saw, in short, only one means of preventing Ascalon from\r\nfalling into the hands of the Franks and becoming thenceforth as\r\nformidable a danger as it had been hitherto a valuable protection\r\nto his communications with Egypt. Giving out that he intended to\r\nconcentrate all his forces on the preservation of Jerusalem, and\r\ncommissioning his brother Safadin to keep watch on the movements of\r\nthe enemy, he on Wednesday, September 11, left the main body of his\r\ntroops at Ramlah under Safadin, and himself set out for Ascalon. He\r\nspent [Sidenote: _Thurs., Sept. 12_] a sleepless night outside its\r\nwalls, and declared next morning to Bohadin that he would rather lose\r\nall his sons—one of whom, El Afdal, was present—than pull out one\r\nstone of the place, but there was no alternative. Under his personal\r\nsuperintendence the town was cleared of its inhabitants, and the\r\ntroops which he had brought with him, with every other available man,\r\nwere set to destroy its fortifications. Ten days of incessant work,\r\npicking, digging, and burning, reduced “the Summit of Syria” to a\r\nheap of ruins.[792]\r\n\r\nThese operations were just beginning when Safadin, who [Sidenote:\r\n_Sept. 12-13_] had transferred his headquarters to Jafna (called\r\nby the Arabs Yebnah and by the Franks Ibelin), on the coast-road,\r\nabout thirteen miles south of Joppa, received from the Frank leaders\r\nsome new overtures for a treaty.[793] Their object probably was to\r\nascertain, if possible, something as to the plans and movements\r\nof their adversaries; and Safadin did his utmost to spin out the\r\nnegotiations, his brother having charged him to detain the enemy\r\nat Joppa by every means he could devise till the Sultan’s work\r\nat Ascalon, which he was most anxious to keep secret from them,\r\nshould be done.[794] The Franks were in no great haste to move;\r\nthe rich orchards and vineyards and olive-yards round Joppa formed\r\na delightful camping-ground; moreover, they must in any case wait\r\ntill their fleet came into the harbour. Soon after its arrival some\r\nof the poor folk who had been turned out of Ascalon wandered into\r\nJoppa [Sidenote: c. _Sept. 20-22_?] and astonished the Crusaders by\r\ntelling them what Saladin was doing. The tale seemed so incredible\r\nthat Richard despatched Geoffrey de Lusignan and some others by sea\r\nto reconnoitre Ascalon and find out the truth. When these scouts\r\nconfirmed the report of the refugees, a council was held to decide\r\nwhat should be done. Richard’s military instinct told him that the\r\nplan with which they had set out from Acre—the securing of the whole\r\ncoast before they risked any attempt on the interior—was the only\r\nsound one. “The Turks are razing Ascalon; they dare not fight us.\r\nLet us go and recover it. All the world ought to hasten thither!” he\r\npleaded. But the duke of Burgundy and the French party urged that the\r\nshortest route to the goal of their pilgrimage was the route which\r\nstarted not from Ascalon but from the place where they now were, and\r\nthat Joppa should be rebuilt and made the base for an advance upon\r\nJerusalem. Richard, feeling that anything was better than dissension\r\nwithin the host, yielded to their urgency. A tax was levied for the\r\nexpense of the restoration of Joppa;[795] and on October 1 Richard\r\nwrote home: “Know ye that by God’s grace we hope to recover the Holy\r\nCity within twenty days after Christmas, and then we will return to\r\nour own land.”[796]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCE ON JERUSALEM\r\n\r\n1191-1192.\r\n\r\n  Ambulantes et flentes properabunt.... In Sion interrogabunt viam,\r\n  huc facies eorum.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Richard was building, Saladin was pulling down. Having razed\r\nAscalon, he on September 23 rejoined his main force at Jafna,\r\nthence returned with it next day to Ramlah, and set his men to raze\r\nthe citadel of this latter place and the great fortified church\r\nof S. George at the neighbouring town of Lydda. On the 25th he\r\nleft his army at Ramlah under Safadin to complete this work and\r\nwatch the enemy, while he went to see with his own eyes the state\r\nof the defences of Jerusalem and take measures for securing their\r\nefficiency. On the 30th he returned to Ramlah.[797] To Richard\r\nthis abandonment of all attempt to hold the country seemed like\r\nthe conduct of “a man bereft of all counsel, and of all hope of\r\nsuccour”;[798] but Richard himself was not without secret misgivings\r\nas to the ultimate success of the Crusade. On the same day on which\r\nhe wrote—probably to one of his ministers, for communication to his\r\nsubjects in general[799]—the letter declaring his hope that Jerusalem\r\nwould be won by the middle of January, he wrote also a letter to the\r\nabbot of Clairvaux which reveals more clearly the actual condition of\r\naffairs and the king’s real expectations as to their future course.\r\nHe thought there was good hope that the whole “heritage of the Lord”\r\nwould be speedily recovered; indeed, part of it was recovered\r\nalready. But in the recovering of that part he had, as he truly said,\r\nborne the burden and heat of the day and exhausted not only his money\r\nbut also his health and strength, so that he felt he could not stay\r\nin Syria beyond Easter; and the other western leaders, having spent\r\nall they had, would return to their homes unless fresh supplies of\r\nmen, money, and other necessaries were sent out from Europe to enable\r\nthem to remain. He therefore besought the abbot to stir up princes\r\nand peoples by his preaching, and induce them to make provision\r\nfor the safety and defence, after Easter, of the Lord’s heritage,\r\n“which,” he said, “by God’s grace we shall have fully won by that\r\ntime.”[800]\r\n\r\nA nearer future than Easter had a share in Richard’s secret\r\nanxieties. All these weeks ships had been plying to and fro between\r\nJoppa and Acre, too many of them bringing from the northern city\r\nvisitors who were not merely useless but undesirable, and carrying\r\nback thither lukewarm Crusaders who preferred its pleasures and\r\nindulgences to the hard work of the Holy War; whereby the host was\r\nconsiderably diminished in numbers.[801] The extent of the leakage\r\nseems to have been made fully apparent to the princes when at the\r\nend of September they removed their troops from the gardens to a new\r\nencampment somewhat further out, near the Casal of S. Habakkuk.[802]\r\nKing Guy was commissioned to go to Acre and bring the truants\r\nback;[803] and while awaiting their return Richard, probably to keep\r\nthe enemy inactive, sent on October 3 a messenger to Safadin to\r\npropose a renewal of the suspended negotiations. A few days earlier,\r\nSaladin had received from Conrad of Montferrat overtures for an\r\nalliance; Conrad offered to make peace with the Moslems, break openly\r\nwith the Franks, and recover Acre for the former, if they would\r\ngive him Sidon and Beyrout. Saladin was quite willing to agree to\r\nthese terms—“for,” says Bohadin, “the marquis was a most terrible\r\nadversary to us”—but not to grant Conrad’s demand that the Sultan\r\nshould pledge himself by oath to the cession of the two sea-ports,\r\ntill Conrad should first have proved his sincerity by attacking his\r\nfellow-Christians at Acre and releasing his Moslem prisoners at\r\nTyre.[804]\r\n\r\nOn October 4 Saladin, finding that at Ramlah he could not get enough\r\nfodder for his horses and camels, owing to his foragers being too\r\nmuch exposed to attacks from the enemy, removed his army some eight\r\nor nine miles south-eastward into the hills, close to a place whose\r\ncharacter is expressed in one form of its name, Natroun, “post of\r\nobservation.”[805] The Franks called the place Toron of the Knights;\r\n“toron” meaning height or mount, and the knights being those of\r\nthe Temple, who had built on its summit a tower of great strength\r\noverlooking two of the roads to Jerusalem. This tower Saladin at\r\nonce began to pull down; like the other strongholds which he had\r\ndemolished, it was useless to him for present purposes, and could be\r\nof value only to his enemies, should the site fall [Sidenote: _Oct.\r\n8_] into their hands. Four days later Safadin, whom he had left at\r\nRamlah in command of the advanced guard, sent him word that Richard,\r\nhaving discovered Conrad’s dealings with the Sultan, had sailed\r\nfor Acre in order to put a stop to them by making friends with the\r\nmarquis.[806] There was, however, another reason for the king’s visit\r\nto Acre. The loiterers there were so slow to move at the bidding of\r\nGuy that it was clearly necessary to bring a stronger influence to\r\nbear upon them. Richard’s exhortations took such effect [Sidenote:\r\n_Oct. 13_] that within a fortnight[807] he was back at Joppa\r\naccompanied not only by the two queens, whom he established there\r\nwith their attendants, but also by so “much people” that the host\r\nseemed to have become more numerous than ever.[808] It took another\r\nfortnight to clear out of Acre and convey by sea to the new base the\r\nremaining stragglers and the stores needed for a fresh advance.[809]\r\nDuring this enforced delay the host was once at least very near\r\nlosing its commander-in-chief. Richard, having ridden out with a very\r\nsmall escort partly to exercise his hawks,[810] partly to look out\r\nfor an opportunity of surprising the Turks, was himself surprised by\r\nsome of them when he had stopped to rest and fallen asleep. Awaking\r\njust in time, he sprang to horse and drove them off, but they led him\r\ninto an ambush, and he was only saved from capture by the devotion\r\nof William des Préaux, who concentrated the attention of the enemies\r\non himself by shouting, “Saracens, I am Melec”—that is, the king—and\r\nwas seized and hurried away accordingly, while the real king escaped.\r\nThe whole host was aghast when the adventure became known, and some\r\nof Richard’s friends upbraided him for his rashness and implored him,\r\nfor the sake of the cause to which his safety was so important, never\r\nagain to expose himself thus without sufficient escort; but it was\r\nall in vain. “In every conflict he delighted in being the first to\r\nattack and the last to return.”[811]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Richard had, immediately on his return to Joppa, renewed\r\nhis friendly intercourse with Safadin by sending him a beautiful\r\nhorse as a present. A few days later an envoy from Safadin came,\r\nby the king’s desire, to meet him at Yazour, some four miles, from\r\nJoppa on the road to Ramlah, to receive his proposals for a treaty.\r\nOf these proposals the Moslem envoy carried back two sets, one for\r\ndirect transmission to the Sultan, the other intended primarily for\r\nSafadin’s personal consideration. To Saladin the king wrote that,\r\nwith Franks and Moslems alike perishing and the country ruined, the\r\nwar had gone far enough; the only matters in dispute were the Holy\r\nCity, the Cross, and the limits of the two realms, Christian and\r\nMussulman. Their claim to Jerusalem, as the most sacred seat of their\r\nFaith, the Christians could not renounce so long as there was one\r\nman of them left alive. Of the country they claimed restitution up\r\nto the western bank of the Jordan. As for the Cross, “seeing that to\r\nthe Moslems it is but a piece of wood,” Saladin might well give it\r\nback to those who accounted it a sacred treasure; and thus should\r\nthere be for both parties peace and rest from their labours. Saladin\r\nat once decisively refused all three conditions.[812] To Safadin the\r\nking had proposed another scheme: that Safadin should take Queen Joan\r\nof Sicily to wife, and reign over the land jointly with her, she\r\nholding Jerusalem as her royal seat, Richard endowing her with Acre,\r\nJoppa, and Ascalon (which he accounted his own conquests), the Sultan\r\n[Sidenote: c. _Oct. 18_] giving the Holy Cross to the Christians, and\r\nall the places which he held in the Sahel or Maritime Plain to his\r\nbrother and declaring him king of the land. With these terms Safadin\r\nappeared well pleased, and Saladin, when they were laid before him,\r\nanswered immediately and emphatically, “Yes! yes! yes!”—“being,” says\r\nBohadin who was present and who knew him well enough to read his\r\nthoughts, “persuaded that the king would never really sanction such\r\na thing, and proposed it only in trickery and play.” His persuasion\r\nwas justified; when on October 23 an envoy from the Sultan and his\r\nbrother again came to the Christian camp, he was sent back with\r\na message that when the king had told his sister of the marriage\r\nproposed for her, she had become “furious with indignation and\r\nwrath,” and sworn by all she held sacred that she would never submit\r\nto it; whereupon her brother had promised to bring, if he could,\r\nSafadin to accept Christianity. All this was of course mere diplomacy\r\nto wile away the time till the host was ready for a further advance;\r\nand on the 27th Saladin received [Sidenote: _Oct. 28_] tidings that\r\nthe enemy was preparing to leave Joppa. Next day the Sultan returned\r\nto Ramlah. On the 29th he sent some troops to surprise the Christian\r\ncamp, but they were driven off and put to flight.[813] On the 30th\r\nRichard, “wandering about in the plain towards Ramlah,” espied a\r\nreconnoitring party of Saracens, attacked them without hesitation,\r\nslew several of them and scattered the rest.[814] On the 31st, having\r\ncompleted his arrangements for the security of Joppa, he led the host\r\non the first stage of its advance towards Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Oct. 31_]\r\n\r\nThe stage was a very short one—only two miles, to Yazour, or as the\r\nFranks called it, the Casal of the Plains. This place and Casal Maen,\r\nwhich seems to have been the Frankish name for Beit Dejan, about\r\ntwo miles further to the south-east, had been Frankish strongholds,\r\nrecently dismantled by the Saracens; it was important that they\r\nshould be restored in order to secure the command of the road leading\r\nfrom Joppa into the hills. Richard undertook the restoration of\r\nCasal Maen, and the Templars that of Casal des Plains; the host\r\nlay encamped between the two places for [Sidenote: _Nov. 1-15_] a\r\nfortnight while the work was in progress. The Turks did their utmost\r\nto hinder it by sending out skirmishing parties. One of these,\r\nhaving been put to flight, was pursued by Richard so far that before\r\nhe turned back he actually saw [Sidenote: _Nov. 6_] Ramlah and the\r\nSultan’s army there.[815] Another day a foraging party protected by\r\na small escort of Templars was suddenly surrounded by a numerous\r\nbody of Turks at “Bombrac,” properly Ibn Ibrak or Beni Berak, about\r\ntwo miles from Casal Maen. On learning their peril Richard, who was\r\nbusy superintending the works at Casal Maen, sent some knights to\r\nthe rescue and quickly followed in person. When he reached the spot\r\nthe position of the little band looked so hopeless and the enemy’s\r\nnumbers so overwhelming that his companions besought him to retire,\r\n“for,” said they, “if mischief should befall you, there would be\r\nan end of Christendom!”[816] “I sent those men here; if they die\r\nwithout me, may I never again be called king,” was his reply. Setting\r\nspurs to his horse and giving him the rein, he burst “like lightning”\r\ninto the enemy’s ranks, and laid about him so furiously that they\r\nall either fled “like beasts,” or were slain or made prisoners.[817]\r\nSuch is the Frankish version of this encounter; Bohadin, however,\r\ndescribes it as a success for the Saracens,[818] and makes no mention\r\nof Richard’s presence.\r\n\r\nThat evening Richard sent a messenger to Safadin, complaining of\r\nthese attacks as breaches of their friendly relations, [Sidenote:\r\n_Nov. 3_] and again asking him for a personal interview.[819]\r\nThree days before, Reginald of Sidon had come to Saladin from Tyre\r\nwith a renewal of Conrad’s proposal of an alliance against the\r\nCrusaders. As before, Saladin gave equal encouragement to both\r\nparties. On the 8th Safadin and Richard met in a large tent set up\r\nfor the purpose[820] “between the Casal of the Temple and that of\r\nJosaphat”;[821] each brought with him “all such gifts as princes are\r\nwont to give to one another,” and the special delicacies in food\r\nand drink most esteemed among his own people, for the delectation\r\nof the other.[822] Safadin crowned the entertainment by introducing\r\na singing girl, and Richard professed himself greatly pleased with\r\nthe Saracen mode of singing.[823] The rest of the day was spent in\r\ntalk, and they parted with a mutual promise of fast friendship and\r\na renewed request from Richard that Safadin would procure for him\r\nan interview with the Sultan. Saladin refused to meet him, giving\r\nthe same reason as on a previous occasion.[824] Meanwhile Reginald\r\nwas in the Sultan’s camp, splendidly lodged in a tent filled with\r\nevery oriental luxury, treated with marked courtesy, and sometimes\r\naccompanying Safadin when that prince rode out to reconnoitre the\r\nChristian host. Saladin himself inclined to accept the offers of\r\nConrad. “If we make peace with the western Franks,” he said privately\r\nto Bohadin, “it will never be a secure one; if I were to die, it\r\nwould be very difficult to get our army together again, and before\r\nthis could be done all the forces of our foes would have united. It\r\nwere wiser to fight on till we have either expelled them from our\r\ncoasts or died in the attempt.” Richard, however, anxious to prevent\r\nan alliance between Saladin and Conrad which would undoubtedly have\r\nbeen fraught with grave peril to the Christian cause, twice renewed\r\nhis proposals in a modified form, each time lowering his demands\r\nand offering fresh concessions; so when on November 11[825] Saladin\r\nlaid the propositions of the marquis and those of the king before a\r\ncouncil of his emirs, they declared in favour of the latter. Saladin\r\nyielded to their opinion. But Richard had reserved for himself a way\r\nof escape. “The whole Christian community,” he said, “is blaming me\r\nfor proposing to wed my sister to a Mussulman without leave from the\r\nPope. I will therefore send an envoy to him, and in six months I\r\nshall have his answer. If he consents, well; if not, I will give you\r\nmy brother’s daughter, in which case the Pope’s sanction will not be\r\nneeded.” To this Saladin replied: “If the alliance is to be made, let\r\nit be made on the original terms; I will not go back from my word;\r\nbut if that marriage fail, we want no other.”[826] Thus the matter\r\nremained in abeyance for several months. On the day (November 15) on\r\nwhich he sent this last rejoinder Saladin again retired from Ramlah\r\nto the neighbourhood of Natroun[827]; and shortly afterwards the\r\nChristian host advanced from its encampment between the two restored\r\nCasals into the plain between Ramlah and Lydda. Here they pitched\r\ntheir tents and waited for reinforcements and supplies.[828]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Nov. 15-22_]\r\n\r\nThe rank and file were naturally puzzled and scandalized by Richard’s\r\ndiplomatic dealings with the Infidels, which seemed to them unlawful,\r\nand of which they neither understood the purpose nor knew the real\r\ncharacter. The Frank chroniclers excuse him as a simple-minded\r\nChristian duped by the cunning of the Saracens. He cleared himself in\r\nthe eyes of his accusers in a fashion of his own. “Right and left the\r\nenemies came swarming about the camp; and the king met them and gave\r\npractical proof of his loyalty to God and Christendom, for several\r\ntimes he shewed in the host the many Turks’ heads that he had cut\r\noff.”[829]\r\n\r\nBesides the enemy, the Crusaders had now another obstacle to contend\r\nwith—the climate. The “former rains,” or heavy showers which open\r\nthe agricultural year in Palestine, would begin about the time\r\nwhen the host left Joppa, at the end of October, and continue\r\nthrough November; these would be followed by a season of constantly\r\nincreasing rainfall lasting throughout the next three months. This\r\ngreat rain “pursued the soldiers of the Cross,” as one of them\r\nsays, till it drove them to take what shelter they could find\r\nwithin the ruins of Ramlah and Lydda.[830] Here they remained “in\r\ngreat discomfort and difficulties”[831] till the end of December or\r\nbeginning of January. Saladin held them in check by remaining in his\r\ncamp near Natroun till December 12; then he withdrew to Jerusalem\r\nand disbanded his army[832] for the rest of the winter, trusting\r\nfor the defence of Judea to the guerilla troops who still remained\r\namong the hills, to the weather, and above all, to the physical\r\ncharacter of the country. The Christian host was now on the edge of\r\nthe Shephelah, or Lowlands of Judea, so called in distinction from\r\nthe “Hills” proper, the loftier central range, or ridge, which forms\r\nthe backbone of the land, and on whose eastern side lie Jerusalem\r\nand Bethlehem. The low, soft chalk-hills of the Shephelah are not a\r\nrange; they lie in groups and clusters interspersed with level spaces\r\nand valleys opening into the plain on the west, and falling on the\r\neast into the long, deep trench which runs between the “Lowlands” and\r\nthe “Highlands” like—as a modern writer says—“a great fosse planted\r\nalong the ramparts of Judea.” At the mouth of the northernmost of\r\nthese cross-valleys—Joshua’s Valley of Ajalon—Lydda and Ramlah were\r\nfrontier towns of the Shephelah and the maritime plain. Along this\r\nvale or over the low hills on each side of it, and through the narrow\r\ndefiles which at its other end penetrate the central range, ran the\r\nmost direct lines of communication between the Holy City and the\r\ncoast. One of these was the old “way that goeth to Beth-horon” from\r\nGibeon on the plateau above Jerusalem. This road led to Joppa through\r\nLydda; so did another which crossed the fosse some three miles south\r\nof the first. The two were linked together by a cross-road which\r\nran on south-westward to the ancient Nicopolis—called Amwas by the\r\nArabs and Emmaus by the Franks—and then divided into two branches,\r\none going southward by Natroun, the other to Joppa through Ramlah.\r\nThis latter way seems to have been in general use since the eighth\r\ncentury, when the first Moslem conquerors overthrew Lydda and founded\r\nRamlah to supersede it.[833] The First Crusaders had marched by the\r\nroad from Ramlah to Emmaus and thence to Beth-horon, Gibeon, and\r\nJerusalem, without opposition. Richard resolved to try how far he\r\ncould follow in their steps; but he knew he could not expect such\r\ngood fortune as theirs, for the Shephelah was still full of what one\r\nFrank writer calls “the outside Turkish army,”[834] that is, the\r\ntroops whom Saladin had left to keep guard and to prowl about among\r\nthe hills, in contradistinction to the “inner” force which was\r\nwith him at Jerusalem. In this district of tumbled hill and dale,\r\nmoorland, glen, and torrent-bed, of chalky slopes and limestone\r\nboulders covered with thick scrub and brushwood that sheltered caves\r\nand hiding-places innumerable, these light-armed Saracen horsemen\r\nwere at home, and had every advantage for the guerilla warfare in\r\nwhich they excelled; and the ease and rapidity with which they could\r\nmove about through the intricacies of the hills enabled them to\r\nswoop down suddenly from the most unexpected quarters, with fatal\r\neffect, upon foraging or reconnoitring parties and convoys.[835]\r\nOne chronicler says that when the bulk of the host sought shelter\r\nin Lydda and Ramlah, the count of Saint-Pol betook himself to “the\r\nCasal of the Baths”; which seems to represent a place now called\r\nUmm-el-Hummum, about twelve miles north-east of Lydda.[836] If this\r\nstatement be correct, the count’s object may perhaps have been to act\r\nas an advanced guard on that side of the host and keep watch against\r\na possible gathering of the Saracens in force on the lower slopes\r\nof the hills of Samaria—especially at Mirabel, or as the Saracens\r\ncalled it Mejdel Yaba, which was close to Umm-el-Hummum and one of\r\nthe few castles which Saladin had not caused to be evacuated—and\r\ntheir descent thence on the Christians at Lydda. It is at any rate\r\nprobable that Richard’s purpose was to render some such service\r\nas this in another direction, towards the south and south-east of\r\nRamlah, when on December 22 or 23 he removed his own headquarters\r\nto the “Post of Observation,” Natroun, which Saladin had quitted\r\nten days before.[837] On that day, however, a convoy from Joppa\r\nwas intercepted by the enemy; and similar mishaps occurred several\r\ntimes in the ensuing week.[838] To this unsatisfactory [Sidenote:\r\n_Dec._] state of affairs the leaders, having now fully ascertained\r\nthat Saladin and his main army had really “taken to the Mountains”\r\nproperly so called—the mountain-wall which shelters Jerusalem from\r\nthe world—“and left the champaign to us,” boldly decided to put an\r\nend by advancing to the foot of the said mountains, where they told\r\ntheir followers they would find a resting-place and be able to get\r\nfood for themselves.[839]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1192]\r\n\r\nThe advance was ordered for January 3. Some of the Saracen guerilla\r\nbands which were constantly scouring the country between Joppa\r\nand the hills had apparently discovered that a movement was in\r\ncontemplation, but were uncertain as to its object; they spent the\r\nnight of the [Sidenote: _Jan. 3_] 2nd lying hid near Casal des Plains\r\nand at daybreak dashed forward in the direction which the host was\r\nabout to take; probably they hoped to lie hidden while it passed, and\r\nfall at unawares on the rearguard or the slow-moving baggage-train.\r\nRichard, however, knew of their lying in wait, and had himself, with\r\nGeoffrey de Lusignan, been lying in wait for them all the preceding\r\nnight at the Casal of the Baths; a locality where, seeing that it\r\nwas quite as far (in a different direction) from Lydda as their own\r\nlurking-place and double that distance from his known headquarters\r\nat Natroun, they were not likely to suspect his presence. While they\r\nwere hurrying up from the west, he was spurring to meet them from\r\nthe north, the very opposite quarter to that where they doubtless\r\nsupposed him to be; and scarcely had they pounced upon and slain two\r\nmen-at-arms who went forth alone in advance of the host, when the\r\nunexpected apparition of a banner which they well knew to be the\r\nking’s, and a figure whose bearing and headlong onset were equally\r\nunmistakeable,[840] threw them into utter confusion. Most of them\r\nfled in the very direction whence Richard had come, towards Mirabel;\r\nprobably hoping to escape pursuit among the hills. Richard, who was\r\nmounted on Fauvel, dashed after them and unhorsed two before any of\r\nhis own followers could rejoin him; some twenty others were slain or\r\nbrought back prisoners to the Christian camp.[841]\r\n\r\nA march of ten miles brought the host to Beit Nuba, on a level space\r\nof high ground close to the northern end of the natural fosse which\r\nlies between the Shephelah and the mountain range. The hearts of\r\nthe pilgrims “were glad with the hope that they were going to the\r\nSepulchre”; but “their bodies were ill at ease,” for the Syrian\r\nwinter was now at its worst, and in their present exposed encampment\r\nthere was no shelter from its ravages. Stormy wind and tempest,\r\ntorrential rain and hail, beat down or tore up the tents; armour\r\nrusted, clothes rotted, biscuits and bacon were so soaked that they\r\nbecame putrid; horses died, men sickened; and in less than a week\r\n“the wise Templars, the brave Hospitaliers, and the men of the land”\r\ncame to the conclusion that under the existing circumstances an\r\nattempt to besiege Jerusalem could lead to nothing but disaster.\r\nThey told Richard that if the city were invested its besiegers would\r\nbe between two fires, Saladin breaking forth upon them from within\r\nand the “outside” Turkish army cutting them off from communication\r\nwith the coast and depriving them of supplies.[842] The men who\r\nspoke thus knew well that it was vain to dream of existing by\r\nforaging on the barren, rocky tableland which forms the summit of\r\nthe Judean mountain-range, and that the host, if it got there at\r\nall, would probably starve long before the defenders of the city,\r\nwhich Saladin was sure to have victualled for a siege, and which\r\nit would hardly be possible to blockade so completely as to cut it\r\noff from all means of obtaining further provisions. Nor was this\r\nall. Supposing—these counsellors urged—that the city were taken,\r\nits capture would be useless unless it could be at once filled with\r\ntroops capable of holding it permanently; and this would be no\r\neasy matter, for the western pilgrims, who formed the bulk of the\r\nhost, would return to their home-lands as soon as their pilgrimage\r\nwas accomplished, and thus when they were gone all that had been\r\nwon would be lost again.[843] Hereupon the western leaders called\r\na council of war at Natroun;[844] they may have retired there on\r\npurpose to be well away from the rest of the army while discussing\r\nthe matter. However this may be, they asked “the wise folk who were\r\nborn in the land” what course they would recommend under existing\r\ncircumstances. The Templars and Hospitaliers [Sidenote: _Jan. 6-13_]\r\nat once answered that what they would advise was not to proceed\r\ntowards Jerusalem at present, but to re-fortify and occupy Ascalon,\r\nso as to obtain some control over the transit of provisions from\r\nthe great Saracen storehouse, Cairo, to the Holy City.[845] An\r\nArab historian gives, very likely from the report of some spy who\r\noverheard the proceedings of the council, a curious account of the\r\nway in which the final decision was reached. Richard, he says, asked\r\nto see a plan of Jerusalem, that he might judge for himself of the\r\nforce of the arguments put forward by the Knights. They drew a plan\r\nfor him; and when he thoroughly understood the character of the site\r\nand surroundings of the city, he pronounced them such as to make\r\nthe city, in his opinion, virtually impregnable “so long”—thus the\r\nArab reports the words of the western king—“as Saladin lives and the\r\nMoslems are united.”[846] Before the middle of January the host was\r\nback at Ramlah.[847]\r\n\r\nWhether Richard’s verdict on the prospects of the Crusade was really\r\nquite so pessimistic as Ibn Alathyr represents may be doubted. The\r\nscheme now proposed by the Military Orders and accepted by the\r\nking was simply a reversion to the original plan of campaign with\r\nwhich they had all set out from Acre, and from which Saladin’s\r\nseeming panic after Arsuf had tempted them to diverge; and there\r\ncan be little doubt that the divergence was unwise. The Frank\r\npilgrim-chroniclers, sharing and voicing the disappointment of the\r\nrank and file, declare indeed that the retirement from Beit Nuba\r\nwas a blunder, and that if their leaders had but known the evil\r\nplight—due, like their own, to the weather—of Saladin and his men\r\nat Jerusalem, the city might, “without doubt,” have been taken\r\neasily.[848] But those who spoke thus could have no real knowledge as\r\nto the state of affairs in Jerusalem, and their version of it finds\r\nno countenance in the pages of Bohadin, who was there, and who may\r\nfairly be trusted on the subject, since he makes no mystery about\r\nthe Sultan’s perils and alarms on other occasions. The picture drawn\r\nby the very same Frankish chroniclers of the condition in which the\r\nhost, “doleful and down-hearted,” marched back to Ramlah shows that\r\nit was quite unfit to attempt an invasion of the hill-country. Men\r\nand beasts were alike worn out with weakness and fever, caused by\r\nthe wet and cold, and many of the “lesser folk,” sick and helpless,\r\nwould have been left behind but for King Richard, who caused them\r\nto be sought out and brought away in safety.[849] Among the French\r\nCrusaders discontent took the form of wholesale desertion. Some\r\nwent to Joppa; of these, some stayed there, and others sailed back\r\nto Acre, “where living was not dear,” sarcastically observes the\r\nNorman poet; some joined the marquis at Tyre, whither he had long\r\nbeen trying to entice them; the duke of Burgundy himself went off\r\nin dudgeon with his followers to Casal of the Plains. Extremely\r\nangry, but nothing daunted, Richard and the faithful remnant of the\r\nhost set out on January 19 by a road which, crossing the plain from\r\nRamlah, brought them back at Ibelin[850] to the main road along the\r\ncoast. The ten miles’ march through mud and mire to Ibelin was a\r\nsufficiently [Sidenote: _Jan. 20_] hard day’s work; but “that day was\r\nnothing compared to the next,” when nearly double that distance had\r\nto be covered, on a road where men and horses were constantly sinking\r\ninto swamps, and beneath a ceaseless downpour of rain, hail and snow;\r\nand when at length they arrived before Ascalon, they could only make\r\ntheir way into the place by clambering over heaps of broken wall, and\r\nfind a partial shelter among the ruins within.[851]\r\n\r\nAscalon stood amid what the poet-pilgrim Ambrose emphatically calls\r\n“a very good country”; but the stormy season, and the uncertainty\r\nas to how many armed enemies might be still lurking around, made\r\nthis practically useless for foraging purposes; and the harbour was\r\na dangerous one, the sea being often so rough that no ship could\r\nride in it. This was the case for a week after the arrival of the\r\nCrusaders, who were thus limited to what little food they had brought\r\nwith them—much of the stores with which they started from Ramlah\r\nhaving been lost in the swamps on the way—till by a change in the\r\nweather the transports coming from Joppa to meet them were enabled to\r\nland their supplies. Scarcely was this done, however, when the storms\r\nrose again, and barges and galleys and “all our beautiful smacks”\r\nwere dashed to pieces and some of the sailors drowned. Richard caused\r\nall the wood that drifted ashore to be collected and employed for\r\nthe construction of some galleys, which he destined for his own use;\r\n“but,” adds Ambrose, “it was not to be.” Towards Candlemas he sent\r\na message to the French, exhorting them to restore the unity of the\r\nhost by coming to rejoin their brethren and take counsel with them\r\nas to what should be done next. They answered that they would come,\r\nand would continue with him till Easter (April 5), on condition that\r\nif they then wished to depart, he would give them safe-conduct by\r\nland to Acre or Tyre. To this he agreed; whereupon they came, and—the\r\nworst of the winter’s rages having now subsided—the reunited host by\r\ncommon consent set to work to rebuild Ascalon. The task was no light\r\none; it was said that the fortifications had originally included no\r\nless than fifty-three great towers, all now almost levelled with the\r\nground. Most of the nobles were by this time too short of money to be\r\nable to hire workmen; so knights, men-at-arms, squires, clerks, and\r\nlaymen of all ranks set themselves to make a clearance of the ruins,\r\nwith such a will that soon they were astonished at their own success.\r\nAs the rebuilding, however, required more skilled labour than theirs,\r\nRichard took the direction of it upon himself, and not only caused\r\nthe greater part of it to be performed at his expense, but also made\r\ngood whatever was lacking of labour and of the money to pay for it\r\nin the parts assigned to the charge of others.[852] The English\r\nchronicler of the Crusade says the king wrought at the building with\r\nhis own hands,[853] and we can well believe the story. Saladin was\r\nabout this time doing the same thing at Jerusalem.[854]\r\n\r\nAnother small point of resemblance between the two sovereigns was a\r\npreference for doing their own scouting. One morning Richard, with\r\na handful of picked knights, rode out from Ascalon to reconnoitre\r\nDarum. This castle, built by the late King Amalric on the site of an\r\nearlier fortification, had been the extreme south-western outpost of\r\nthe Latin kingdom of Jerusalem; it lay three or four miles south\r\nof the point where the coast-road crosses a watercourse which the\r\nhistorians of the Crusade called the Torrent or River of Egypt,\r\nbecause above that point it was in fact, in Amalric’s and Richard’s\r\ndays and long afterwards, the boundary between Syria and Egypt.[855]\r\nNow that both these countries were under Moslem rule, Darum was the\r\nfirst halting-place in Syria for the caravans which brought supplies\r\nfrom “Babylon”—that is, Cairo—to Jerusalem. It chanced that when\r\nRichard drew near the place, a thousand Christian prisoners whom the\r\nSultan was sending to Cairo under the charge of some of his household\r\nguards had just arrived there. At the sight of the king’s banner the\r\nescort, doubtless thinking the whole host from Ascalon was upon them,\r\nleft the prisoners and sought shelter for themselves in the castle;\r\nbut before they could reach it some were slain and twenty captured by\r\nRichard and his men. Thus, says Ambrose, “God delivered His people\r\nwho were appointed to death, by sending King Richard to take the\r\nplace of Saint Leonard, the liberator of captives.”[856]\r\n\r\nSome of the Christians, Frank and Syrian, thus rescued made, no\r\ndoubt, a welcome addition to the diminished numbers of the host.\r\nRichard had several times already sent letters or messages to the\r\nmarquis, calling on him to come and rejoin the Crusade and render the\r\nmilitary service due to the Crown of Jerusalem for the fiefs which\r\nhe held of it. Conrad at first took no notice of these appeals; to\r\nanother and more urgent summons he finally answered that he would not\r\nset foot in the camp till he had had a personal interview elsewhere\r\nwith the king of England.[857] Richard seemingly felt it necessary\r\nto overlook his insolence and consent to a meeting at Casal Imbert,\r\nhalf way between Acre and Tyre. But meanwhile a new trouble arose.\r\nPhilip of France had gone home in August 1191 without leaving his\r\nlieutenant in Palestine, the duke of Burgundy, any money for the pay\r\nof the French soldiers, counting for that purpose on the share due to\r\nhim of the bezants which the two kings then expected to receive in a\r\nfew weeks from Saladin. When this expectation had become hopeless,\r\nHugh asked Richard for a loan, and Richard, to avoid losing the\r\nFrench troops altogether, lent him five thousand marks.[858] This\r\nsum was exhausted long before February 1192; the French troops\r\nclamoured for their dues; Hugh asked Richard for another loan. This\r\nRichard refused. High words passed, and the duke, with the greater\r\npart of the Frenchmen, straightway departed to Acre.[859] There they\r\nfound the Pisans and Genoese at strife. Pending the recovery of\r\nJerusalem, Acre served as temporary capital of the kingdom, and there\r\naccordingly King Guy seems to have remained since his return thither\r\nin September. His authority was upheld by the Pisans, who from\r\nthe outset of the Crusade had attached themselves to Richard; the\r\nGenoese, having done homage to Philip Augustus, favoured the marquis,\r\nand were intriguing to put him in possession of the city. A skirmish\r\nbetween these two parties seems to have been going on when the French\r\narrived; they took to their arms, whereupon the Pisans set themselves\r\nto bar their way; the duke’s horse was killed under him; then the\r\nPisans rushed back into the city and shut the gates against him and\r\nhis men. At this juncture Conrad, in response to the invitation of\r\nthe Genoese, arrived by sea with his forces. The Pisans “took to\r\nthe mangonels and stone-casters” and thus kept him off for three\r\ndays while they sent to call Richard to the rescue. Their messenger\r\nfound the king at Caesarea, on his way to the projected meeting with\r\nConrad. A hasty ride brought him to Acre at dead of night, and “when\r\nthe marquis knew that the king had come, nothing could hold him\r\nthere, but he went with all speed back to Tyre,” whither Burgundy and\r\nthe French were gone already.[860]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Richard called together the people of [Sidenote: _Feb.\r\n20_] the city and made peace among them.[861] Soon afterwards the\r\nmeeting with Conrad at Casal Imbert took place, but without any\r\npractical result.[862] Next, Richard demanded repayment of the loan\r\nwhich he had made to the duke of Burgundy six months before. Hugh\r\nacquitted himself of the debt by assigning to the king the most\r\nvaluable of Philip’s Saracen prisoners, who were still in Conrad’s\r\ncustody at Tyre; but he made no sign of rejoining the Crusade. Such\r\na state of affairs threatened ruin to the whole enterprise, and\r\nafter long and anxious deliberation in his own mind Richard took\r\nprivate counsel with the “elders and wise men of the land” as to what\r\nhad best be done. They gave their judgement that the marquis had\r\nforfeited his rights under the settlement of July 1191, and should be\r\ndeprived of the revenues then assigned to him in the kingdom.[863]\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless to keep some sort of watch upon Conrad that Richard\r\nremained at Acre till the end of March.[864] During the latter part\r\nof his stay there he was again engaged in negotiations with Saladin.\r\nWhen a messenger arrived at Jerusalem with a request that Safadin\r\nmight be sent to confer with the king, nothing was known there of the\r\nCrusaders’ advance to Ascalon; Richard was believed by the Sultan\r\nto have placed his troops in winter quarters at Joppa and gone back\r\nthence straight to Acre.[865] Saladin [Sidenote: _Feb.-Mar._] bade\r\nhis brother go by way of the Jordan valley and Mount Tabor, collect\r\nthe troops of those parts in readiness for a renewal of hostilities,\r\nand then—as usual—go and hear Richard’s proposals, and if they\r\nwere not acceptable, drag out negotiations till the whole Saracen\r\narmy had had time to re-assemble. A note was given him containing\r\nthe utmost concessions that Saladin was willing to make. They were\r\nthese: an equal division of the land; the Cross to be given back; the\r\nChristians to have priests in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and\r\npilgrims to have access to it, provided they went unarmed. “He was,”\r\nsays Bohadin, “driven to offer these terms, by the general weariness\r\nof long-continued warfare, by a load of debt, and by the long absence\r\nof his followers from their homes; for there were many who never left\r\nhim, and who dared not ask for leave.”[866]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _March 20_]\r\n\r\nSafadin set out on March 20. At Keisan he was met by Humphry of\r\nToron with a message to this effect: “The division of the land is\r\nagreed upon already; but we must have the whole of the Holy City\r\nexcept the Temple of the Rock,” otherwise called the Mosque of Omar.\r\nThis message Safadin transmitted to his brother, and the Sultan’s\r\ncouncil—so Bohadin says—actually thought its terms near enough to\r\ntheir own to be “quite acceptable.” Safadin’s first messenger,\r\nhowever, was followed by another who [Sidenote: _March 27_] reached\r\nJerusalem on the 27th with tidings that Richard had gone back to\r\nJoppa.[867] If it be true that Richard knighted Safadin’s son on\r\nPalm Sunday, March 29, at Acre,[868] the announcement must have been\r\nslightly premature; but by the time that Safadin himself returned\r\nto Jerusalem, on April 1,[869] Richard was certainly back at\r\nAscalon.[870]\r\n\r\nThe king was “much chafed and troubled in mind”; for Holy Week was\r\nbegun, and he knew that Conrad and Hugh had been urging the French\r\nwho were still at Ascalon to join them at Tyre, and that his promise\r\nof a safe-conduct to those who wished to depart at Easter for home\r\nwould in all likelihood be immediately claimed by every one of\r\nthem; and so it was, on Wednesday, April 1.[871] He gave them an\r\nescort,[872] and when they set out next day himself rode a little\r\nway with them, “weeping, and beseeching them to stay with him at\r\nhis expense, and so keep together; but they would not.” Finding his\r\nefforts useless, he returned to Ascalon and sent off a messenger in\r\nhaste to Acre bidding his officers in charge of that city not to\r\nadmit the French within its walls.[873] This desertion of more than\r\nseven hundred of the finest chivalry of Christendom was a grievous\r\nloss to the host. Richard did what he could to comfort and encourage\r\nthe faithful remnant by holding on Easter Day (April 5) a great\r\ncourt outside Ascalon; his tents were thrown open to all comers, and\r\nfurnished with abundance of meat and drink and everything that could\r\nbe procured to enhance [Sidenote: _April 6_] the magnificence of the\r\nfeast. Next day he set everybody to work again on the fortifications,\r\ntaking upon himself the responsibility and the expense of completing\r\nthe portions which the French had left unfinished.[874]\r\n\r\nThe season of the “latter rains” was now almost over, and both\r\nChristians and Saracens had to lay their plans for a new campaign.\r\nThe former had already, while Richard was at Acre, profited by the\r\nimprovement in the weather to make two brilliant raids, one on March\r\n27 from Joppa across the plain to Mirabel, where they seem to have\r\nintercepted a rich caravan, for they slew thirty Turks and brought\r\nback fifty prisoners besides a number of cattle and booty said to\r\nhave been worth two thousand eight hundred bezants; the other from\r\nAscalon next day, when “all men who had horses” rode out by the\r\nsouthern road to capture a “prey” of which the scouts had told them;\r\n“and they did well this time, for those who were there reported that\r\nthey went right into Egypt, four leagues beyond Darum, and they\r\nbrought back great troops of horses, asses, camels, oxen, and sheep,\r\nbesides near two hundred prisoners, men, women, and children.”[875]\r\nSaladin heard of it, and promptly despatched some troops to intercept\r\nthe raiders on their way back, but they were too quick for him.[876]\r\nSaladin’s wisest policy clearly was to collect his forces and remain\r\nwith them in his present position till he saw what his enemies would\r\ndo. Richard as usual began by reconnoitring in person. His first\r\nattempt to ascertain the defences of Darum had been cut short by\r\nthe necessity of bringing to the camp, or despatching in safety to\r\ntheir homes, the Christians towards whom he had acted the part of S.\r\nLeonard. On Easter Tuesday (April 7) he set out again in the same\r\ndirection; that day he viewed Gaza, where also there seems to have\r\nbeen a Moslem garrison, and on the Wednesday went on [Sidenote:\r\n_April 8_] and perambulated Darum to see on which side it could be\r\nmost easily assaulted. Its garrison vainly hurled at him missiles\r\nwhich failed to reach their aim and insults in a tongue which he did\r\nnot understand.[877]\r\n\r\nA few days later[878] there came to Ascalon a messenger from England\r\nwith tidings which filled the whole host with dismay. He brought\r\nletters from the justiciars beseeching the king to return at once,\r\nas John was trying, with a considerable prospect of success, to make\r\nhimself master of the realm. Richard called the barons together and\r\nset forth the matter fully to them. He added that if he should be, as\r\nhe feared, obliged to depart from Syria, he would leave three hundred\r\nknights and two thousand men-at-arms to continue serving there at his\r\nexpense; and he asked his own followers to let him know who among\r\nthem wished to go with him, and who wished to stay, for he would put\r\nno constraint upon any man. The barons, after holding a consultation\r\namong themselves, came back and told him frankly that unless he\r\nappointed as lord over the land someone who had a knowledge of war,\r\nand to whom all, no matter whence they came, could adhere, every\r\none of them would leave the country and set out for home. Richard\r\nat once asked them which they would have of the only two possible\r\nkings—Guy or Conrad. “And all of them, great and small, knelt down\r\nbefore him and prayed that he would make the marquis their lord, for\r\nthis was the most helpful and useful thing for the realm.” Some of\r\nthem had hitherto been bitter against the marquis, and these Richard\r\nupbraided for their sudden change of front; but when fully assured\r\nall were now unanimous in their choice he gave it his assent, and\r\nordered that an honourable escort should go to fetch the king-elect\r\nand the French, and thus all should be reunited.[879]\r\n\r\nAs head of the royal house of Jerusalem, guardian of the realm,\r\nand commander-in-chief of the crusading host, Richard would not\r\nhave been justified in withholding his assent from the course of\r\naction thus unanimously recommended by both the native and the\r\nwestern Crusaders. Their decision was probably the wisest possible\r\nunder the circumstances. Although Conrad had done more than any\r\nother man (except possibly Philip Augustus) to sow dissension among\r\nthe Christian forces, he was nevertheless the leader who, when\r\nRichard was gone, would divide them the least; for when once he\r\nwas acknowledged as their chief, it would be his own interest to\r\nkeep them together and to further the object of their enterprise to\r\nthe utmost of his power; he was, unquestionably, by far the most\r\ncapable and energetic, next to Richard, of all the princes of the\r\nCrusade; and his so-called wife and their infant daughter were the\r\nsole surviving representatives of the royal house of Jerusalem. The\r\ncrowned king, Guy, had no following of his own, and it seems quite\r\nclear that he had, tacitly at least, resigned all claim to authority\r\nin the realm as well as in the host; so that no disloyalty to him\r\nwas involved in Richard’s assent to the election of a new sovereign.\r\nCount Henry of Champagne and three other envoys of rank carried the\r\ngreat news to Tyre; Conrad and all the folk there were delighted, and\r\nbegan to prepare for immediate return to the host at Ascalon.[880]\r\nBut before any of them had set out, the situation was suddenly\r\nchanged again; on April 28 the marquis was assassinated.[881] The\r\nmurderers were caught red-handed, and, of course, promptly put to\r\ndeath. At Saladin’s court they were reported to have declared that\r\nthey had been hired by Richard to commit the crime.[882] Saladin,\r\nwith whom Conrad had been in negotiation for several weeks past, had\r\nat the time an agent in Tyre from whom this report was derived;[883]\r\nand if it did not actually originate with Conrad’s friends and allies\r\nat Tyre, its circulation among Richard’s enemies and rivals and its\r\ntransmission to Europe were certainly encouraged by them.[884] A few\r\nyears later, however, one Moslem historian gave a very different\r\naccount of the matter: Ibn Alathyr says the men were hired by Saladin\r\nto kill Richard if they could, or, failing him, Conrad, and that\r\nthey chose the latter alternative as the easier of the two.[885]\r\nThis story is probably worthless except as an illustration of the\r\nimportance of both king and marquis in Saracen eyes. The best\r\nconfutation of the other tale lies in the simple fact that Conrad’s\r\ndeath could not be of the slightest profit to Richard, but, on the\r\ncontrary, upset all his plans for his own return to Europe. The\r\nNorman pilgrim-poet of the Crusade tells us that the men who stabbed\r\nConrad were “Assassins” not only in the modern conventional sense\r\nof the word, but also in its original and etymological sense; by\r\ntheir own confession, they were Hashashîn, that is, followers of the\r\n“Old Man of the Mountain,” and acted under his orders.[886] This\r\nis confirmed by two of our best English authorities,[887] and by\r\nthe French historians who lived and wrote in the Holy Land; one of\r\nthe earliest of these latter says that “some people” reported the\r\nmurderers to have been hired by Richard, “but,” he adds, “this was\r\nnot a bit true”;[888] while another states that the deed was done to\r\navenge certain other Ismaïlites whom the marquis had caused to be\r\nfirst robbed and then drowned.[889] This story is at any rate more\r\nintrinsically probable than either Ibn Alathyr’s or that which was\r\naccepted at Saladin’s court and sent to Europe by Conrad’s friends;\r\nindeed, the relations between these latter and Richard during the\r\nrest of their stay in the Holy Land seem hardly compatible with a\r\nreal belief on their part in Richard’s guilt.\r\n\r\nThere were now some ten thousand Frenchmen, under Hugh of Burgundy\r\nand other barons, lodging in tents outside Tyre. As soon as Conrad\r\nwas buried these barons called upon Isabel to surrender the city to\r\nthem to hold in trust for the king of France. She boldly answered\r\nthat “when the king returned, she would willingly surrender it to\r\nhim, unless before that time it had another lord.”[890] The closing\r\nwords of this answer were a scarcely veiled announcement of her\r\nresolve to assert her independence as queen by right of inheritance\r\nand bring in a new claimant to the lordship of the land by taking\r\nanother consort; and it is scarcely possible to avoid a suspicion\r\nthat she had already made her choice. Count Henry had gone back from\r\nTyre as far as Acre;[891] there he received the news of Conrad’s\r\ndeath. He at once returned to Tyre; “and when the people saw him,\r\nthey straightway elected him as sent by God to be their ruler and\r\nlord, and prayed him to accept the crown and wed its heiress, the\r\nwidow of the marquis.” He answered that he must first ascertain how\r\nhis uncle King Richard would regard the project. When Richard heard\r\nthe whole of the strange story, he brooded over it for a long while;\r\nat last he said to Henry’s messengers: “Sirs, I should greatly wish\r\nthat my nephew might be king, if it please God, when the land shall\r\nbe conquered; but not that he wed the marchioness, whom the marquis\r\ntook from her rightful lord and lived with in such wise that if Count\r\nHenry trusts my counsel he will not take her in marriage. But let\r\nhim accept the kingship, and I will give him in demesne Acre and its\r\nport-dues, Tyre, Joppa, and jurisdiction over all the conquered land.\r\nAnd then tell him to come back to the host and bring the Frenchmen\r\nwith him, as quickly as he can, for I want to go and take Darum—if\r\nthe Turks dare wait there for me!”[892]\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Richard did not see how impracticable was his\r\nadvice. The first half of the scheme proposed by the barons at Tyre\r\nwas futile without the other half. The kingdom of Jerusalem was sold,\r\nbeyond redemption, into the hand of a woman. Isabel’s hour had come;\r\nshe was now, beyond all question, the “right heir” of all the land.\r\nHenry of Champagne, nephew to both Richard and Philip, constant\r\ncompanion and faithful follower of the one, yet loyal homager of the\r\nother, was exceptionally qualified to become a sovereign round whom\r\nall parties could rally, and a healer of their divisions; but these\r\nqualifications must prove useless if Isabel should give him a rival\r\nby choosing another consort. His election would be of no avail for\r\nhimself or for the realm unless he took the queen with the crown. The\r\nbarons at Tyre were urgent that he should do so; he hesitated from\r\nfear of Richard’s displeasure, but his personal inclination seconded\r\ntheir arguments. Finally Isabel herself brought him the keys of the\r\ncity; a priest was hurriedly fetched, and there and then, on May\r\n5, the couple were wedded. The king-elect sent representatives to\r\nAcre, Joppa, and elsewhere, to take seisin of the royal rights, and\r\nsummoned his men to join him for an expedition against Darum.[893]\r\n\r\nDuring Henry’s absence from the host Richard had been scorning the\r\ncountry round Ascalon in a series of bold excursions, made sometimes\r\nalmost alone, and from which he always returned “bringing ten or a\r\ndozen, or a score, or may be thirty, Saracens’ heads, and some live\r\nSaracens besides.”[894] Another object of these expeditions probably\r\nwas to reconnoitre the inner border of the plain, and endeavour to\r\nfind out what were the possibilities of penetrating by some way,\r\nother than the vale of Ajalon and its ramifications, through the\r\nShephelah and across the trench and the mountain-rampart of Judea.\r\nThe most direct way up from the plain to Jerusalem was by the next\r\nvalley south of Ajalon, the Wady es Surar (Valley of Sorek); but if\r\nthis were to be attempted, the base for the attempt must be some\r\nplace further north than Ascalon. The entrance to the third main\r\ninlet into the Shephelah, the Vale of Elah or Wady es Sunt, was\r\nguarded by a great castle set on a height called by the Arabs Tell es\r\nSafiyeh, “the Bright Hill,” and by the Franks (who in earlier days\r\nhad built the castle) Blanchegarde; both names being derived from the\r\nnature of the site, a solitary chalk-hill whose gleaming sides were\r\nplainly visible from Ascalon, seventeen miles away, while the tower\r\non its summit commanded a wide view over the surrounding plain, as\r\nwell as of Ascalon itself, and also of the roads leading northward\r\nto Natroun and southward to Ibelin of the Hospital and Hebron. Once\r\nalready—in December, from Ramlah—Richard had set out to explore the\r\nneighbourhood of Blanchegarde,[895] but had turned back again without\r\nreaching the place. When on April 22 he led his troops to attack it,\r\nhe found it deserted; the Turkish garrison had fled at his approach.\r\nHe seems to have left there in their stead the whole force that he\r\nhad taken with him, and returned to Ascalon quite alone, for on the\r\nway back he nearly lost his life in an encounter with a wild boar\r\nin which he was evidently single-handed.[896] Six [Sidenote: _Apr.\r\n28_] days later—the day of Conrad’s death—Roger de Glanville, whom\r\nRichard had left in command of the newly won fortress, made a daring\r\nreconnaissance through the Vale of Elah, up the steep mountain-pass\r\nwhich meets it on the other side of the central valley, across the\r\nplateau, and past the very gates of Jerusalem, and returned in\r\ntriumph with [Sidenote: _Apr. 29_] a few stray Saracens whom he had\r\ncaptured. On the following day the king, riding somewhere “between\r\nBlanchegarde and Gaza,” came upon eight Saracens of whom he slew\r\nthree and captured the other five. On the night of May 1 he was at\r\nFurbia, near the coast, between Ascalon and Gaza; here some Turks\r\ntried to surprise him asleep at early morn, but he was the first of\r\nhis little band to awake and went forth straight from bed, stopping\r\nfor nothing but his sword and shield, to meet the assailants;\r\nfour were slain, seven made prisoners; “the rest fled before his\r\nface.”[897] It must have been either between these two exploits or\r\ndirectly after the latter of them that Count Henry’s messengers met\r\nthe king “in the plains of Ramlah, spurring across the open country\r\nin pursuit of a band of Turks who were fleeing before him.”[898] His\r\nrestlessness was probably increased by the disturbed state of his\r\nmind. Envoys from his own dominions were arriving one after another\r\nwith contradictory letters and messages, some giving alarming\r\naccounts of the state of affairs there, some assuring him that all\r\nwas well; some beseeching him to come home, some exhorting him to\r\ncontinue the sacred task in which he was engaged; all deepening his\r\nperplexities till he knew not which to believe or how to act.[899]\r\nOne point alone stood out clear before him. Now that Ascalon was\r\nlost to the Moslems, its place as the key of Egypt, the base and\r\nstorehouse which sheltered troops and supplies from the Nile valley\r\nfor transmission to Jerusalem and the other fortresses still held by\r\nthe Moslems in Syria, had been taken by Darum. Before Richard could\r\nbring himself to quit the country, and also before Saladin’s army\r\nreassembled, Darum must be won for Christendom.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose. The rains were quite over; summer was\r\nbeginning; and Saladin’s host would have been at its full strength\r\nagain ere now but for some troubles in the northern part of his\r\ndominions. His nephew Taki-ed-Din, the lord of Hamath and Edessa,\r\nhad died in October 1191 leaving a son, El Mansour, who was inclined\r\nto rebel against Saladin’s supremacy. On May 14 or 15 the Sultan\r\ndespatched his own son El Afdal to seize El Mansour’s lands; but\r\nthe diplomatist of the family, Safadin, fearing that this quarrel\r\nwould imperil the “Holy” War, was pleading hard for a pacific\r\nsettlement.[900] Knowing all this, Richard determined not to wait\r\nfor Henry. He had his stone-casters packed on shipboard and sent\r\nthem down towards Darum by sea; he hired men-at-arms to increase\r\nthe forces at Ascalon; some he distributed in the strong places\r\nround about to guard the roads; then he set out with only the troops\r\nof his own domains,[901] and on Sunday, May 17,[902] this little\r\nband pitched their tents before Darum, a fortress with seventeen\r\n“fine strong towers and turrets,” besides a keep of great height\r\nand strength built against a solid rock which formed one side of\r\nit, while the other sides were of squared stone and surrounded by a\r\ndeep fosse. Being too few to encircle such a place, the adventurers\r\nencamped all together a little way off to wait for their machines and\r\nconsider on which side they could use them to the best advantage.\r\nThe Turkish garrison thought scorn of such an insignificant looking\r\nforce, and rode forth and made a feint of provoking them to fight,\r\nbut failing to move them, withdrew into the castle and shut the\r\ngates. That night or next day the ships arrived with the engines of\r\nwar; “and,” says an eye-witness, “we saw the valiant king of England\r\nhimself, and the nobles who were his companions, all sweating under\r\nthe burden of the various parts of the stone-casters, which they,\r\nlike packhorses, carried on their shoulders near a mile across the\r\nsand.” The pieces were soon put together and the machines at work,\r\none manned by the Normans of the party, another by the Poitevins, a\r\nthird probably by the Englishmen; this last the king took under his\r\nown special command, and he directed its discharge solely against the\r\nkeep; a mangonel set up there by the Turks was speedily destroyed by\r\nit. All three machines were kept in ceaseless action day and night.\r\nMeanwhile the walls were being undermined;[903] and wherever they\r\nbegan to fall they were set on fire by some men of Aleppo skilled\r\nin wall-breaking, whom Richard had hired during the siege of Acre\r\nand now brought with him to Darum.[904] On the fourth day of the\r\nsiege (Friday, May 22), when the castle gate had been shattered by\r\nRichard’s stone-caster and set on fire, the garrison offered to\r\nsurrender on condition that their lives and those of their families\r\nshould be spared.[905] Richard refused the condition and bade them\r\ndefend themselves as best they could. The stone-casters worked more\r\nvigorously than ever; presently one of the undermined towers fell\r\nwith a crash. The assailants rushed through the breach; some sixty\r\nTurks were slain; the rest fled into the keep, and when they saw\r\nthe Christian banners waving all over the outer [Sidenote: _May 22_]\r\nbailey and the Frank knights and men-at-arms beginning to scale\r\nthe keep itself, they “gave themselves up to King Richard as his\r\ncaptives and slaves.” He kept them securely guarded in the tower for\r\nthe night; next morning they were brought out, “and their hands tied\r\nbehind their backs so tightly that they roared with pain.” There were\r\nthree hundred men; and there were also some women and children in the\r\nplace, and, moreover, forty Christian prisoners.[906]\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the seaboard was complete; the last fortress on the\r\ncoast[907] was in Christian hands; and Richard and his men were the\r\nmore delighted with their success because they had won it unaided,\r\nbefore their French comrades rejoined them. Count Henry and his\r\nfollowers had ridden at full speed, but they came spurring up just\r\ntoo late. Uncle and nephew met with joyful greetings and mutual\r\ncongratulations, and Richard publicly made over his prize to Henry\r\nas a kind of first-fruits of the realm. It was Whitsun Eve; so all\r\nrested where they were on the festival day.[908] On the Monday the\r\ncastle was given in charge to constables appointed by Henry,[909]\r\nand the rest of the party set out northward. Henry and his men went\r\nstraight on [Sidenote: _May 25_] to Ascalon; Richard and his company\r\nstopped at Furbia,[910] where it seems the king expected to receive\r\nthe report of a scout whom he had sent to reconnoitre the approach to\r\nthe southernmost of the cross-valleys leading from the plain to the\r\nmountains—the Wady el Hesy, “valley of the wells,” which opens from\r\nthe Shephelah about twelve miles east of Furbia and meets the central\r\ntrench about eight miles west of Hebron. The scout came and reported\r\nthat Caysac, the emir whom Saladin had placed in charge of that\r\ndistrict, was at the “Castle of Figtrees” with more than a thousand\r\nmen, making the castle ready for defence against the Christians.\r\nRichard at once called out the host from Ascalon to follow him; they\r\nset out from Furbia on May 27 and advanced up the Wady el Hesy to\r\na place which they called the Canebrake of Starlings; its Arabic\r\nname was [Sidenote: _May 28_] Cassaba, meaning “the Reeds.”[911] On\r\nthe morrow they set out at sunrise and proceeded to the Castle of\r\nFigtrees, but found in it only two Turks; the rest had fled in haste\r\nat tidings of their approach. The Christians therefore returned to\r\nCassaba.[912] They were less fortunate in an expedition which they\r\nseem to have made next day, against another fortress in the same\r\nneighbourhood; one Moslem historian says the garrison came out and\r\nworsted them in fight; another, that they were surprised within the\r\ncastle; and both assert that one of their chief captains or nobles\r\nwas slain.[913]\r\n\r\nWhile the host lay thus at the Canebrake of Starlings there came to\r\nthe king another messenger from England, [Sidenote: _May 29-31_]\r\nhis vice-chancellor, John of Alençon, with such an alarming account\r\nof the state of affairs in both England and Normandy that after\r\nmuch anxious thought he told the other princes and barons that he\r\nreally must and would go home. They hereupon held a council among\r\nthemselves, and promptly answered this announcement by another:\r\nwhatever he might do or say, wherever he might go, they all would\r\nproceed forthwith to Jerusalem. Someone who was present at their\r\ncouncil carried a report of its outcome to the pilgrims of lower\r\nrank, “and they danced for joy till past midnight”; “there was no man\r\nhigh or low, young or old, who was not wild with delight, except the\r\nking himself; but he went to bed in a feverish state of perturbation\r\nand perplexity”;[914] for he knew that unless he went home he was\r\nlike to lose his lands,[915] yet it was virtually impossible for him\r\nto withdraw from the Crusade in the face of this unanimous resolve.\r\nHow the resolve should be carried into effect, was the next question.\r\nThe Christians had now secured the entrances to three of the five\r\nnatural openings from the plain into the hill-country. There was\r\nclearly nothing to be gained by proceeding further up the Wady el\r\nHesy. From their present encampment they could easily reach one of\r\nthe two openings which they had not yet approached, the Wady el\r\nAfranj. At the western end of this valley, on the border-line of the\r\nShephelah and the plain—“at the foot of the hills, where the fields\r\nbegin,” as William of Tyre[916] describes it—stood a fortress with a\r\ntown or village clustering round it, called by the Arabs Beit Djibrin\r\nand by the Franks Ibelin of the Hospital; the latter title, derived\r\nfrom its owners the Knights of Saint John, being added to distinguish\r\nit from the other Ibelin, on the coast further north. Its site was\r\nprobably that of the ancient Eleutheropolis, and it was a central\r\npoint whence roads radiated in all directions, to Gaza, to Hebron,\r\nto Blanchegarde and Toron of the Knights (Natroun), to Bethlehem and\r\nJerusalem. When—probably on June 1—the host left the Canebrake of\r\nStarlings, its destination was apparently understood to be Ibelin.\r\nThe pilgrims seem to have proceeded along the border of the plain to\r\na point—probably Galatia—whence a road ran eastward to Ibelin and\r\nwestward to Ascalon.[917] [Sidenote: _June_] Here they halted and\r\nspent two or three days, “suffering a fierce persecution and strange\r\nmartyrdom” from swarms of minute flies which stung them in every\r\nexposed part with such poisonous effect that “they all looked like\r\nlepers,” but buoyed up above all troubles by their confident hope of\r\nreaching Jerusalem at last. One alone sat gloomily in his tent apart,\r\nabsorbed in ceaseless thought; and that one was the king.[918]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _June 3_]\r\n\r\nAs Richard sat thus one day he saw a chaplain from his own land,\r\nWilliam of Poitiers, walking up and down before the open door of\r\nthe tent, and weeping bitterly. This man longed to remonstrate with\r\nhis sovereign for proposing to desert the Holy Land in its present\r\nperilous condition; but he lacked a fitting opportunity, and was\r\nafraid to use one when it came. Richard called him in and said: “For\r\nwhat are you weeping? By the fealty that you owe me, tell me the\r\ntruth at once.” “Sire,” answered the priest through his tears, “I\r\nwill not tell you till you have promised not to be wroth with me.”\r\nRichard gave his word on oath that he would bear him no grudge. Then\r\nWilliam spoke with the impassioned and abundant eloquence of the\r\nsouth. He bade the king call to mind how all his past career had been\r\na series of exploits and successes so remarkable as to be manifestly\r\ndue to the special grace and protection of Heaven; his early\r\ntriumphs, when only count of Poitou, over hostile neighbours and\r\nBrabantine hordes far outnumbering his little forces; his peaceful\r\nand undisputed succession to the throne; his almost instantaneous\r\nvictory over the Griffons at Messina; his rapid conquest of Cyprus;\r\nhis providential encounter with the Saracen ship whose freight,\r\nhad it reached Acre, might have saved that city for Islam; his\r\ntimely arrival at Acre, and the prominent share which he had had in\r\neffecting its surrender; his recovery from the sickness of which so\r\nmany other Crusaders had died; the deliverance of the prisoners at\r\nDarum, and the speedy capture of that fortress, whereof he had been\r\nthe chosen instrument; and his own deliverance from the Turks who had\r\nnearly captured him in his sleep. “Remember how God has given thee\r\nsuch great honour that no king of thy age ever had so few mishaps—how\r\noften He has helped thee, and how He helps thee still. He has done\r\nsuch great things for thee that thou needest fear neither king nor\r\nbaron. Remember all this, O king, and guard this land whereof He has\r\nmade thee protector! for He placed it wholly in thy keeping when the\r\nother king turned back; and all men, great and small, to whom thy\r\nhonour is dear, say that if thou, who wert wont to be a father and\r\nbrother to the Christian cause, shouldst forsake it now, thou wilt\r\nhave betrayed it to death.”[919]\r\n\r\nTo all this Richard listened without speaking a word, and when the\r\npriest’s discourse was ended he made no comment or reply. But he\r\npondered over it; “and his thoughts were enlightened.” Next day (June\r\n4) the host was led westward, and by the hour of nones found itself\r\nonce more in the fields around Ascalon.[920] Everybody took this to\r\nmean that the king intended to set out for Europe at once. Instead,\r\nhe told his nephew and the other nobles that “for no other concern\r\nor need, no messenger and no tidings, nor for any earthly quarrel,\r\nwould he depart from them or quit the land before next Easter.” Then\r\nhe called for his herald Philip, and bade him proclaim throughout\r\nAscalon, in God’s Name, that the king had with his own lips promised\r\nto stay in the land till Easter, and that all men were to make\r\nthemselves ready with whatsoever means God had given them, for they\r\nwere going to Jerusalem to besiege it straightway.[921]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRICHARD AND SALADIN\r\n\r\n1192\r\n\r\n  Circumdate Sion et complectimini eam ... et distribuite domos ejus,\r\n  ut enarratis in progenie altera.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of the projected expedition to Ibelin was due to more\r\ncauses than one. On the day of the [Sidenote: _May 22_] surrender\r\nof Darum Saladin had yielded to the necessity strongly urged upon\r\nhim by his emirs, of restoring peace and unity within the borders of\r\nIslam as the essential preliminary to a renewal of the “Holy” war,\r\nand had despatched Safadin with full powers to make whatever terms\r\nhe might think good with his rebel great-nephew El Mansour.[922]\r\nThe settlement thus made enabled the Sultan to call out all his\r\nforces again for action against the Franks; and so prompt was the\r\nresponse to his call that two important contingents, under the Emirs\r\nBedr-ed-Din and Ezz-ed-Din, reached Jerusalem on the last day of May,\r\njust as the Christian host was on its march northward from Cassaba.\r\nHearing that it was at the “parting of the roads” between Ascalon and\r\nIbelin, he despatched Ezz-ed-Din with the newly arrived forces to\r\nintercept it, and an encounter in circumstances which would have been\r\nhighly unfavourable to the Franks was only averted by the promptitude\r\nwith which their leaders, on discovering Ezz-ed-Din’s approach,\r\nchanged their plans and retired to Ascalon.[923] Ibelin was a place\r\nworth securing; but its capture was not essential to their present\r\nobject; for the purpose of leading an army to Jerusalem the Wady el\r\nAfranj was as valueless as the Wady el Hesy. When once a new advance\r\non Jerusalem was decided on, the matter of most urgent necessity\r\nwas the restoration of the host to its fullest possible strength.\r\nSome of the French contingent were still at Acre. Thither Count\r\nHenry once more proceeded from Ascalon to call these recalcitrants\r\nback to their duty,[924] and also to collect any reinforcements that\r\ncould be obtained from Tyre, Tripoli, or elsewhere.[925] Beit Nuba\r\nwas appointed as the place where he and they were to rejoin the main\r\nbody.[926] With the latter Richard on June 6 set out early in the\r\nmorning, and in a few hours was encamped before Blanchegarde.[927]\r\n\r\nFrom Blanchegarde three ways into the hill-country lay open. One was\r\nthe valley of Elah (Wady es Sunt), which runs almost due east from\r\nthe place where the Crusaders now were. This way was not attractive\r\nto invaders, because its continuation on the further side of the\r\ncentral trench was very difficult for troops. North-eastward from\r\nBlanchegarde a road ran along the border of the plain past the mouth\r\nof the valley of Sorek (Wady es Surar) to Natroun, and thence across\r\nthe Shephelah to Beit Nuba. The valley of Sorek is the most direct\r\nand the easiest of all the natural ways that lead up from the plain\r\nto the mountains of Judah; but it had a great disadvantage. For an\r\narmy advancing through it there was no possible base on the coast\r\nnearer than Ascalon or Joppa, both of them more than twenty miles\r\ndistant from its western end. The only place within easy reach of\r\nit that could be called a coast-town was Ibelin-Yebna, and this was\r\nnot a coast-town in the proper sense; it was four miles from the sea\r\nand had no harbour. Of all the roads that led to Jerusalem the best\r\nfor the Crusaders was unquestionably the one which they had chosen\r\nfor their first attempt—the Beit Nuba road, where they would have in\r\ntheir rear a safe double line of communication through Ramlah and\r\nLydda with their original base at Joppa and thence, by land and sea,\r\nwith Acre. On June 9 they advanced to Natroun,[928] and that night\r\nthey intercepted a score of Turks returning from a plundering raid\r\non Joppa; six escaped, the other fourteen were made prisoners.[929]\r\nNext day Richard with the men of his own domains moved on to Castle\r\nArnold,[930] a place whose character is expressed in its modern\r\nArabic name, Khurbet-el-Burj, “ruins of the Bourg,” _burh_ or\r\nfortress; it had been built by his great-grandfather, King Fulk, on\r\none of the highest hills in the Shephelah, about three and a half\r\nmiles north-west of Beit Nuba, and commanded both the “way that goeth\r\nto Beth-horon” and the lower road along the foot of the hills, from\r\nLydda by Beit Nuba to Jerusalem. Probably the Turks had dismantled\r\nit; Richard pitched his tents “on a high place to the right.” He was\r\njoined by the rest of the [Sidenote: _June 10_] army next day, when\r\nall together proceeded to Beit Nuba and encamped there to wait for\r\nCount Henry and his recruits.[931]\r\n\r\nOn that same day Saladin, whose scouts kept him well informed of all\r\nthe enemy’s movements, held a council to decide what course should\r\nbe taken in view of their apparent intention to attempt the siege\r\nof Jerusalem. It was settled that the defence of the walls should\r\nbe divided among the emirs, a certain portion being assigned to\r\neach of them, and that the Sultan himself with the rest of his army\r\nshould take the field against the invaders.[932] The latter part of\r\nthis arrangement was, however, not carried into effect: throughout\r\nthe three weeks which the Franks spent at Beit Nuba they never\r\nencountered Saladin, and no general engagement took place, though\r\nthere were, as Ambrose says, many “adventures and skirmishes and\r\ndiscomfitures,” in several of which Richard was personally engaged.\r\nOne of these counterbalanced, within twenty-four hours, an evil omen\r\nfor the Franks with which, according to Bohadin, their stay at Beit\r\nNuba began—the falling of a convoy from Joppa into a Turkish ambush\r\non June 12.[933] That night a scout sent out by Richard returned\r\nfrom the hill of Gibeon—called by the Franks Montjoie, because it\r\nwas the place whence the earliest Crusaders had first seen the Holy\r\nCity—with tidings of another ambush which, he seems to have learned,\r\nwas posted near “the Fountain of Emmaus,” or Amwas, half way between\r\nNatroun and Beit Nuba, and close to the point where the roads from\r\nNatroun and Ramlah meet. Before dawn Richard was in the saddle; at\r\ndaybreak he was at the Fountain; the Turks were caught at unawares,\r\ntwenty were slain, one was captured and his life spared because he\r\nwas Saladin’s herald; three camels, several fine Turcoman horses, and\r\ntwo good mules laden with silk stuffs, aloes, and spicery, were the\r\nprize of the victor. The rest of the party he chased over the hills\r\ntill he overtook and slew one of them, seemingly on the “Mount of\r\nJoy” itself, for according to Ambrose—who says he had the story of\r\nthe adventure from one who took part in it—he “saw Jerusalem plainly”\r\nbefore he turned back.[934] During his absence from the camp it had\r\nbeen assailed by a band of Turks, but they were driven back into the\r\nhills.[935] An attempt of the enemies to intercept another caravan\r\nthree or four days later was equally unsuccessful, though the Turks\r\nkilled a few Christians and took some prisoners.[936]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the lesser folk were growing tired of waiting for Henry,\r\nand impatiently asking whether they were or [Sidenote: _June 16-20_]\r\nwere not really going to Jerusalem this time. Some of the French\r\nnobles urged Richard to lead the host at once to Jerusalem and begin\r\nthe siege. He refused. He pointed out the risks which such a step\r\nwould involve; he reminded them how easy it would be for Saladin,\r\nwho always knew all their movements, to swoop down with his army\r\ninto the plain in their rear and cut off their supplies and their\r\ncommunication with the sea, the circuit of the walls being too\r\nextensive to admit of the division of so small a force as theirs\r\ninto two bodies, one to form the siege and the other to protect the\r\nbesiegers and keep the ways clear for convoys. He would not, he said,\r\nbe the leader of such an undertaking, because he had no mind to incur\r\nthe blame for the disaster in which he believed it would result. He\r\nknew well, he added, that both in Holy Land and in France there were\r\nsome persons who wished that he might wreck his reputation in some\r\nsuch way, but he was not minded to satisfy their desire. Moreover,\r\nhe and the French were alike strangers in the land; it was not for\r\nthem to take the responsibility, but for the Military Orders and the\r\nfeudataries of the realm. “Let them decide whether we are to attempt\r\nthe siege, or to go and take Babylon, or Beyrout, or Damascus.\r\nSo shall there be no discord amongst us.”[937] The decision was\r\ncommitted to twenty umpires representing every division of the host\r\nexcept the subjects of Richard: five Templars, five Hospitaliers,\r\nfive knights of Syria, and five barons of France. The first fifteen\r\ngave their award for an expedition against “Babylon”; but the French\r\nwould not agree to this; they declared they would go to Jerusalem\r\nand nowhere else. Richard did his utmost to restore unity. He held\r\nout every possible inducement to the French to accept the Cairo\r\nproject: “See, my fleet lies at Acre, ready to carry all the baggage,\r\nequipments, and accoutrements, biscuits and flour; the host would go\r\nall along by the shore and I would lead from here at my own charges\r\nseven hundred knights and two thousand men-at-arms; no man of mine\r\nshould be lacking. But if they [that is, the French] will not do\r\nthis, I am quite ready to go to the siege of Jerusalem; only be it\r\nknown that I will not be the leader of the host; I will go in the\r\ncompany, as leader of my own men, but of no others.” And forthwith\r\nhe bade all his men assemble in the quarters of the Hospitaliers,\r\n“and arrange what help they would give to the siege when they got to\r\nJerusalem.”[938]\r\n\r\nBefore this last order was fully carried out an unexpected and most\r\nwelcome diversion occurred. Saladin was now in daily expectation of\r\nsome troops from Egypt, for whose despatch he had given orders some\r\ntime before with a warning that they must be specially cautious when\r\nthey approached the territory occupied by the Franks. These troops\r\nwaited at Belbeis for the assembling of a great caravan, in company\r\nwith which they finally set out for Jerusalem. All this was known\r\nto Richard through his scouts, who were fully equal in efficiency\r\nto those of Saladin; some of them were renegade Arabs[939]; others\r\nwere Syrian Christians, so well disguised and speaking the “Saracen”\r\ntongue so perfectly as to be indistinguishable from real Saracens.\r\nThree of these Syrian spies came into the camp—seemingly on Sunday\r\nJune 21[940]—and bade the king mount and ride with his men, and\r\nthey would lead him to the great caravan that was coming up from\r\nEgypt. Richard, in his joy, asked Hugh of Burgundy and the other\r\nFrenchmen to join the expedition, and they did so, on condition of\r\nreceiving a third part of the spoil. With five hundred knights and\r\nmen-at-arms the king rode by moonlight to Blanchegarde and thence to\r\nGalatia, a town in the plain, half way between Ascalon and Ibelin of\r\nthe Hospital; there he was within easy reach of both the coast-road\r\nand the inland road, and could also procure from Ascalon whatever\r\nsupplies he needed, whether of fresh horses or provisions.[941]\r\nSaladin, as soon as he was informed of these movements, despatched\r\nfive hundred picked Turkish soldiers under the emir Aslam to meet\r\nthe force from Egypt and warn it of its danger.[942] He evidently\r\nexpected that the Egyptians, knowing the coast to be practically\r\nin the hands of the Franks, would come by the inner or eastern road\r\nwhich after crossing the Wady Ghuzzeh divided into two branches,\r\none passing over the mountains by Hebron and Bethlehem, the other\r\nthrough the Shephelah across the Wady el Hesy and thence by Beit\r\nDjibrin (Ibelin) to the valleys of Elah and Sorek. This latter route,\r\nbeing the easier and shorter, was the one which the Egyptians would\r\nnaturally take and which Aslam took to meet them. His mission was\r\nto reach them, if possible, in the desert, and guide them by the\r\nsafer though more toilsome and lengthy way over the mountain-range.\r\nRiding as only Arabs (and possibly Richard on Fauvel) could ride,\r\nhe and [Sidenote: _June 22_] his party did meet them, late in the\r\nevening, at what the Arabs called “the Waters of Kuweilfeh” and the\r\nFranks “the Round Cistern.” This was no doubt a well-known stage\r\non the road from Egypt and Mecca; its site is at the southern foot\r\nof the Shephelah, close to the opening from the central fosse into\r\nthe desert, and it would thus be the first watering-place for their\r\nbeasts of burden after passing the Wady Ghuzzeh and before entering\r\nthe hill-country. Aslam was urgent that the ascent to Hebron should\r\nbe made that night; but the Egyptian commander, Felek-ed-Din, fearing\r\nlest the caravan should fail to keep together in the darkness,\r\ndecided to wait till morning.[943] Meanwhile a native Syrian scout\r\nhad come to Richard at Galatia and told him that if he made haste he\r\nmight capture the caravan at the Round Cistern. Richard, conscious\r\nthat there was no real need to hurry—since he and his horsemen\r\ncould easily overtake the slow movements of a caravan—determined to\r\nverify the report before acting on it. He accordingly sent out three\r\nmore scouts,[944] one a real Bedouin, the others native Turcoples\r\ndisguised in Bedouin attire, to make a further reconnaissance in the\r\nevening. Meanwhile he and his troops seem to have advanced to the\r\nhead of the Wady el Hesy, which Aslam had crossed shortly before\r\nthem.[945] Here the returning scouts met them with the news that not\r\nonly the caravan, but also the army from Egypt, was encamped at the\r\nRound Cistern for the night. The king gave orders for all to mount\r\nand ride, and, as they valued their honour, not to think of gain, but\r\ndevote all their energy to routing the Turkish soldiers. He took his\r\nusual post in the van; the [Sidenote: _June 23_] French formed the\r\nrearguard. By daybreak they were all close to their destination, and\r\nwere forming up for attack when another scout came to warn them that\r\ntheir approach had been discovered and the caravan was on the alert.\r\nRichard sent forward some archers, Turcoples, and crossbowmen, to\r\nharass the enemies and impede their movements till he could come up\r\nwith his other troops. The caravan remained stationary; the Moslem\r\ntroops took up a sheltered position close to the hills and greeted\r\ntheir assailants with a thick cloud of missiles “which fell on the\r\nground like dew,”[946] but it was all in vain. “Those of our men who\r\nwere reputed bravest,” confesses Bohadin, “were glad to save their\r\nlives by the fleetness of their horses. It was long since Islam had\r\nhad such a disgraceful defeat.”[947] Aslam, to the neglect of whose\r\ncounsel the disaster was due, had before the fight began withdrawn\r\nwith his troops into the mountains. Thither the others fled, chased\r\nby the Frank cavalry, while the infantry turned to secure the\r\ncaravan. Aslam, seeing the Christian forces thus divided, seized\r\nhis opportunity to send down by a side path a party of horsemen who\r\nattacked the Christian foot; but the attack was beaten off, and the\r\ncaravan surrendered.[948] The booty was immense; there were more than\r\nfour thousand camels laden with precious stores of the most varied\r\nkind, gold and silver, silks and purple cloth, grain and flour, sugar\r\nand spices, tents, hides, arms of all sorts; the horses and mules\r\nwere “altogether beyond counting”; and besides all this, the Egyptian\r\ncontingent so eagerly awaited by Saladin had lost nearly two thousand\r\nmen[949] and suffered a most ignominious defeat. “No tidings,” says\r\nBohadin, “ever dealt a more grievous wound to the heart of the Sultan\r\nthan those which were brought to him at the close of that day.”[950]\r\n\r\nSaladin at once prepared for the siege which he now felt to be\r\nimminent. He ordered his captains to take up their appointed\r\npositions round the walls and make all ready for their defence, and\r\nhe caused the brooks and pools round about the city to be polluted,\r\nthe wells filled up, and the cisterns destroyed, so as to leave the\r\nassailants no means of obtaining water, for it would be impossible\r\nfor them to dig new wells in that rocky soil. When all these\r\nprecautions were taken, however, he was still very anxious; for he\r\nknew that among the Moslems, no less than among the Christians, there\r\nwas dissension as to the conduct of the war, and jealousy and mutual\r\ndistrust between the various nationalities of which his host was\r\ncomposed; for although the Sultan’s subjects were all lumped together\r\nindiscriminately by the Frank writers as “Turks” or “Saracens,” some\r\nof them were in reality much less closely akin and much less alike\r\nin origin, character, and habits, than were the men of England and\r\nFrance and Italy and Germany. On the night of Wednesday July 1 he\r\ncalled his emirs to a solemn council. By his desire Bohadin opened it\r\nwith an impassioned exhortation to all present to persevere in the\r\nwar, and proposed that they should all take an oath on the Sacred\r\nStone of the Temple to hold together till death. Saladin himself\r\nappealed to them as “the only fighting force and sole stay of Islam,”\r\non whom depended the safety of all Mussulmans everywhere. They all\r\npledged themselves to stand by him till death. [Sidenote: _Thurs.,\r\nJuly 2_] Next day, however, they held a meeting among themselves,\r\nand some of them there expressed their disapproval of the Sultan’s\r\nstrategy in shutting up “the only fighting force and stay of Islam”\r\nat Jerusalem; they believed it would result in the capture of the\r\ncity and the destruction of the army by a fate such as that of the\r\ngarrison of Acre, and thus bring the Mussulman dominion in Palestine\r\nto ruin, and that the wiser course would be to risk a pitched battle,\r\nwhich if they were victorious would shatter the enemy’s power and\r\nenable the Moslems to recover all that they had lost, while if they\r\nwere defeated, they would indeed lose Jerusalem, but the army of\r\nIslam would remain, and might hope to regain the city hereafter.\r\nThese criticisms were reported to Saladin, with a further warning\r\nthat if he persisted in his plan of defence, he must either himself\r\nremain in the city or leave one of his family to take the command\r\nthere, as the Kurdish troops would not obey a Turkish emir nor the\r\nTurks a Kurdish one. Personally he was willing to stay, but his\r\nfriends would not sanction a course which they felt might bring upon\r\nIslam a double disaster in the loss of the city and the Sultan both\r\n[Sidenote: _July 2_] at once. He and his devoted secretary spent the\r\nwhole night in deliberating and praying over the problems suggested\r\nby [Sidenote: _July 3_] this communication; on the Friday morning\r\nBohadin advised his master to give up all attempts at finding a\r\nsolution of them and simply commit the direction of all his affairs\r\nto a higher Power. The counsel was followed. That evening the officer\r\nin command of the Moslem advanced guard sent word that “the whole\r\narmy of the enemies” had—seemingly on the preceding day—ridden out\r\nto the top of a hill, stationed itself there a while, and then\r\nridden back to its camp; he had sent out scouts to ascertain what\r\n[Sidenote: _Sat., July 4_] was going on. At daybreak next morning\r\nthis announcement was followed by another; the scouts had come in and\r\nreported that a great discussion, lasting all night, had taken place\r\namong the Christian leaders, and had ended at dawn in a decision to\r\nretreat.[951]\r\n\r\nThe victors of Kuweilfeh seem to have reached Beit Nuba on June 30;\r\nthey had returned by easy stages by way of Ramlah, where they found\r\nCount Henry with the troops which he had collected at Acre.[952]\r\nAt first the camp was filled with rejoicing over the spoil, which\r\nRichard took care to distribute fairly among all ranks of the host;\r\nbut in a day or two the lesser folk began to clamour for an immediate\r\nadvance on Jerusalem. The native umpires who a fortnight before had\r\ngiven their award against the siege repeated the arguments which\r\nthey had then used, laying special stress on the impossibility of\r\nprocuring water, now that all the artificial stores of it for two\r\nmiles round the city were known to have been destroyed by the enemy,\r\nand at a season when every drop of moisture, except the little\r\nfountain of Siloam, would be dried up by the heat of the Syrian\r\nmidsummer.[953] There were also other difficulties. One which Richard\r\nhad urged in January—the numerical insufficiency of the host—does\r\nnot seem to have been appreciably lessened by the results of Count\r\nHenry’s recruiting expedition. The worst difficulty of all was\r\ninternal disunion. Hugh of Burgundy’s self-will and his jealousy\r\nof Richard were shown more openly than ever now that his share of\r\nthe caravan spoils had made him independent of Richard’s bounty. He\r\nand his men had long been in the habit, wherever the host went, of\r\ncamping apart from their fellow-Crusaders at night as if desirous\r\nto avoid their company; by day, when they and the men of other\r\nnations had to associate together, there were constant bickerings and\r\naltercations; and the duke crowned all this mischief by “causing a\r\nsong full of all vileness to be made about the king, and this song\r\nwas sung amid the host. Was the king blameworthy,” asks the Norman\r\npoet-chronicler, “when he in return made a song upon these people\r\nwho were always thwarting and insulting him? and truly no good song\r\ncould be sung about such outrageous folk.”[954] According to one\r\nEnglish writer, Hugh even entered into a secret negotiation with\r\nSaladin, which the vigilance of a scout enabled Richard to unmask,\r\nto the utter confusion of the duke; but the details of the story are\r\nsomewhat doubtful.[955] Clearly, however, there was no exaggeration\r\nin the report transmitted to Saladin from his advanced guard as to\r\ndissensions in the Christian camp; and there is no reason to doubt\r\nthe correctness of Bohadin’s account—derived likewise from the\r\nstatements of a scout who was secretly present—of the final council\r\nheld on the night of Thursday-Friday, July 2-3. After much debate,\r\nthree hundred arbitrators were appointed from among the nobles and\r\nknights; these three hundred delegated their powers to twelve others,\r\nand these twelve chose three umpires, from whose decision there was\r\nto be no appeal.[956] In the morning the pilgrims were, for the\r\nsecond time [Sidenote: _July 3_] when at a distance of little more\r\nthan four hours’ march from their goal, told that they must prepare\r\nfor a retreat.[957]\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was perhaps all the more keenly felt because it\r\nfollowed closely not only upon the victory over the Egyptians, but\r\nalso upon two incidents which had heightened the religious fervour\r\nand thus encouraged the hopes of the Christian soldiers. Several\r\nrelics of the Holy Cross besides the famous one which had been lost\r\nat Hattin were preserved in various places in Palestine, and had\r\nbeen hidden at the time of the Saracen conquest to save them from\r\nfalling into Infidel hands. A Syrian bishop who had held the see of\r\nLydda is said to have come with a great company of men and women of\r\nhis flock and presented one of these fragments to Richard shortly\r\nafter the host reached Beit Nuba.[958] A little later—seemingly just\r\nbefore Richard heard of the coming of the Egyptian caravan—the abbot\r\nof Saint Elias, a monastery situated on the road from Jerusalem to\r\nBethlehem,[959] came and told the king that he had a piece of the\r\nCross hidden in a place known only to himself, which Saladin, who\r\nknew the relic had been secreted, had vainly tried to bribe him into\r\nrevealing. Richard rode with him to the place and brought the sacred\r\ntreasure back, to the great joy of the host.[960] If we may trust\r\nan English writer who, though he did not take part in the Crusade,\r\nhad a special opportunity of obtaining information about Richard’s\r\npersonal share in it, a third fragment of the Holy Rood came into\r\nthe king’s hands under yet stranger circumstances, one of which may\r\npossibly have had some influence on his conduct two [Sidenote: _July\r\n3_] months later. On the last night of the army’s sojourn at Beit\r\nNuba a monk brought him a message from a certain hermit who dwelt on\r\nthe “Mount of Saint Samuel”—that is, Nebi Samwîl, the Arabic name for\r\nwhat the Crusaders usually called the Montjoie—bidding him, in God’s\r\nName, come to him without delay. Richard arose, called up an escort\r\nof horsemen, and rode to the place. The hermit was believed to have\r\nthe spirit of prophecy; he wore no clothes, and was covered only by\r\nhis long unshorn hair and beard. Richard, after gazing for a while\r\nin wonder at this strange-looking personage, asked him what was his\r\nwill. The hermit led his guest into an oratory, removed a stone from\r\nthe wall, and brought out a wooden cross “of a cubit’s length” which\r\nhe reverently handed to the king, telling him it was made from the\r\nsacred Tree of Calvary. He added a prediction that the king would\r\nnot at this time succeed in winning the land, however hard he might\r\nstrive for it; and to demonstrate the reality of his own prophetic\r\ngift, he further foretold his own death on that day week. Richard\r\ntook him back to the camp to prove whether his words would come true.\r\nSeven days afterwards the prophet died.[961] Sixty years later, there\r\nwas a tradition in Palestine that on one occasion when the men of the\r\nThird Crusade, on the point of marching upon the Holy City, were by\r\nthe jealousies among their leaders compelled to turn back, a knight\r\nin Richard’s service “cried out to him, ‘Sire, sire, come here and\r\nI will shew you Jerusalem.’ And when he heard that, he cast his\r\nsurcoat before his eyes all weeping, and said to our Lord: ‘Fair Lord\r\nGod, I pray Thee that Thou suffer me not to behold Thy Holy City,\r\nsince I cannot deliver it from the hands of Thine enemies.’”[962]\r\nThis incident, in itself quite possible, is in Joinville’s report of\r\nthe story placed in a setting of which the details are certainly not\r\nhistorically accurate. If it really occurred, its true place is most\r\nprobably at the close of Richard’s nocturnal visit to the Mount of S.\r\nSamuel, as the sunrise on July 4 lighted up the lower slopes of the\r\nmountain-range of which that eminence was the crown, and revealed the\r\ncity on its coign of vantage at the south-eastern angle of [Sidenote:\r\n_July 4_] the plateau. A few hours later the whole host was back at\r\nRamlah.[963]\r\n\r\nThe umpires at Beit Nuba had reasoned soundly from the premisses\r\nbefore them; and those premisses were sound likewise, except in one\r\nparticular: the Franks did not—as we do from Bohadin—know what was\r\npassing behind the scenes in the Saracen headquarters. They therefore\r\nprobably over-estimated the enemy’s powers of resistance. On the\r\nother hand, there was a similar miscalculation on the Moslem side;\r\nSaladin’s anxiety and alarm would scarcely have been so great had he\r\nrealized how completely the unity of the Christian host was broken.\r\nEven when fully assured that the Franks had really withdrawn from the\r\nneighbourhood of Jerusalem, he was still extremely uneasy, fearing\r\nthey might now take up again the project of an attempt on Cairo, and\r\nfeeling by no means sanguine that they might not, with the coast\r\nof Palestine in their possession and with the supply of beasts of\r\nburden which they had recently acquired, bring it to a successful\r\nissue.[964] A new game of diplomacy now began. The first move in it\r\nwas made, on the morrow, if not on the very day, of the retirement\r\nfrom Beit Nuba, in the name of the king-elect of Jerusalem, Henry of\r\nChampagne; but the Saracens at once recognized that the king-elect\r\ncould be nothing more than a cipher so long as he was uncrowned and\r\nhis uncle was in the land, and that the game was not worth playing\r\nwith anyone except the king-guardian. From him overtures for peace\r\narrived on July 6, and negotiations continued till the 19th. It is\r\ndifficult to decide how far either the king or the Sultan was in\r\nearnest. Richard made so many different proposals that they cannot\r\nall have been seriously meant. He and Saladin alike seem to have been\r\nreally disposed to content themselves with a division of the land;\r\neach of them hoping that the division would be merely temporary,\r\nand would serve as a breathing-space enabling his own party to\r\nrecover strength for a new effort. On one point, however, both were\r\nequally determined not to give way. Saladin, while agreeing that the\r\nFranks should keep the sea-coast, made it an essential condition\r\nthat Ascalon should be again dismantled. This Richard persistently\r\nrefused; so on July 19 the negotiations dropped, and Saladin began to\r\nprepare again for war.[965]\r\n\r\nHis rival was doing the like. By Richard’s orders three hundred\r\nKnights of the Temple and Hospital had already gone from Casal Maen\r\n(whither he and the host had retired on July 6)[966] to Darum,\r\ndismantled that fortress, and transferred its garrison to Ascalon\r\nto reinforce the defences of “Syria’s Summit.” As soon as the three\r\nhundred returned, the whole host proceeded to Joppa; here the sick\r\nfolk were left, and also some of the able-bodied for the greater\r\nsecurity of the place; the rest set out on July 21 or 22 for Acre,\r\nwhich they reached on Sunday the 26th.[967] The weary pilgrims of\r\nlower rank grew more dispirited at every stage in this northward\r\njourney; Richard having given orders for the whole fleet to accompany\r\nit, whence they inferred that he intended sailing for Europe\r\nimmediately. He had, however, another purpose. The Frank re-conquest\r\nof the coast of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem was still incomplete;\r\nthe northernmost sea-port of the realm, Beyrout, was still in Moslem\r\nhands. An attempt on Beyrout had been one of the alternative schemes\r\nsuggested by Richard before the final retirement from Beit Nuba.\r\nThe place, though of less military importance than Tyre or Acre or\r\nAscalon, was well worth the winning; it had a good harbour, and\r\nits loss would deprive the Moslems of their only remaining outlet\r\non the sea between Laodicea and the mouth of the Nile. As soon as\r\nAcre was reached, [Sidenote: _Sunday, July 26_] Richard despatched\r\nseven galleys to make a demonstration before Beyrout. On the morrow\r\n(Monday, July 27) he took leave of the Knights of the Temple and\r\nHospital—with whom he had always acted in concert, and who probably\r\nundertook the control of the host during his absence—and prepared to\r\nfollow next day with the rest of the fleet.[968] But his plans were\r\nupset by an unexpected counterstroke on the part of Saladin.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan had been rejoined at Jerusalem on July 17 by his\r\nson Ed-Daher, who ruled at Aleppo; and Safadin, recalled from\r\nMesopotamia, was close at hand with further reinforcements when\r\non the 22nd Saladin learned that the Christian host had left\r\nJoppa and was on its way to Beyrout. He at once went to Beit Nuba\r\nto reconnoitre, leaving orders for all his troops to follow him\r\nthither. Safadin joined [Sidenote: _July 23_] him there next day.\r\nBy the 25th their united forces were [Sidenote: _July 25_] on the\r\nold camping-ground of the Franks between Lydda and Ramlah. On the\r\n26th—the day of Richard’s arrival at Acre—Saladin reconnoitred Joppa;\r\nbefore nightfall his men were around its walls, and on Monday 27th\r\nthey assaulted the town.[969] After four days of furious fighting\r\nSaladin’s engines made, on Friday the 31st, a breach through which\r\nhis men swarmed into the town; it was given over to pillage and\r\nslaughter, and the garrison in the citadel promised to surrender,\r\non terms arranged between them and the Sultan, if they were not\r\nrelieved before three o’clock on the morrow.[970] They were in hourly\r\nexpectation of Richard’s return; for they had, as soon as the Moslem\r\narmy came in sight, despatched by sea an urgent message to recall him\r\nfrom Acre.[971] The message was delivered to Richard as he sat in\r\nhis tent on the evening of Tuesday July 28.[972] He at once summoned\r\nthe host to go back with him to Joppa; but the French “declared\r\nthey would not stir a foot with him.”[973] A number of Templars,\r\nHospitaliers, and other “good knights,” however, set off by land to\r\nthe rescue, while Richard with another party, comprising the rest of\r\nhis own men and some Genoese and Pisans, went on board the galleys.\r\nThe land party on reaching Caesarea learned that the road between\r\nthat place and Arsuf was blocked by “the son of the Assassin”;\r\nnot daring to risk an encounter with forces of whose numbers they\r\nknew nothing and of whose military repute all Syria stood in awe,\r\nthey made no attempt to proceed further. The ships were caught by\r\na contrary wind off Haïfa, detained by it for three days, and so\r\ndispersed by its violence that only three of them at last came in\r\nsight of Joppa, late in the [Sidenote: _July 31_] evening of Friday\r\nthe 31st, and had to wait at a safe distance for the rest to overtake\r\nthem, and also for the light of day.[974] One of the three carried\r\nRichard, chafing sorely at all these hindrances: “God, have mercy!\r\nWhy dost Thou keep me here, when I am going in Thy service?”[975] In\r\nthe afternoon of that same Friday Saladin had received from Acre a\r\nletter telling him that Richard had given up his intended expedition\r\nagainst Beyrout and was hastening to the relief of Joppa. The Sultan\r\nand his confidant Bohadin at once decided that the agreement with the\r\ngarrison must be flung to the winds, and an effort made to get the\r\ngarrison out of the citadel before Richard should arrive. Saladin\r\nspent some time in haranguing his troops and exhorting them to storm\r\nit that evening; but they were worn out with the day’s fight, and\r\nso sullenly unresponsive to his appeal that he dared not give it\r\nthe form of a command; and at last he and his staff withdrew for\r\n[Sidenote: _Aug. 1_] the night to their usual quarters in the rear.\r\nAt daybreak they heard a trumpet-call, and learned that the king’s\r\nships were in sight. Saladin despatched Bohadin with orders to “get\r\ninto the citadel and get the Franks out of it.” With a body of troops\r\nBohadin entered the town, went to the castle gate, and bade the\r\ngarrison come out. They answered that they would do so, and began\r\nto make their preparations. The morning wore on to noon, and still\r\nthe relief party showed no sign of trying to disembark: Richard in\r\nfact, while the garrison were waiting for him to land, was waiting\r\nto ascertain what had become of them, for the shore was lined and\r\nthe town, to all appearance, filled with Mussulman troops, so that\r\nthe whole place, as seen from the sea, looked as if it were in the\r\nenemy’s hands. On the other hand, it seems that only a small part\r\nof the fleet was as yet visible from the castle-tower. The garrison\r\ntherefore, growing hopeless of rescue, yielded to Bohadin’s urgency\r\nand began to march out. Forty-nine men, besides some women and some\r\nhorses, thus came forth.[976] As each man passed through the gate he\r\npaid down the ransom appointed in the capitulation, although the hour\r\nfixed for its fulfilment had not yet come; and a Frankish version of\r\nthe story adds that in some cases at least, as soon as the money was\r\npaid, the payer’s head was struck off by the Turkish guards.[977]\r\nSuddenly the procession stopped. The ships were spreading out in\r\nline and becoming more distinguishable under the noon-tide sun; the\r\nMoslems could see that there were at least thirty-five; the anxious\r\nwatchers on the castle-tower could probably see that there were more\r\nthan fifty. The remaining men in the citadel hastily put on their\r\narmour, made a sally, and drove Bohadin and his followers out of the\r\ntown. They themselves, however, were quickly driven back, and the\r\nfighting became fiercer and more confused than ever. Once more the\r\ngarrison, in despair, sent the Patriarch of Jerusalem (who chanced\r\nto be in Joppa when the siege began) and a chaplain to renew their\r\noffer of submission to Saladin on the terms originally proposed.[978]\r\nThen another priest, “after commending himself to the Messiah” as\r\nBohadin says, leaped from the top of the tower into the harbour.\r\nFalling in shallow water, with soft sand beneath it, he was unharmed,\r\nand made his way to the nearest galley, whence he was transported\r\nto that of the king.[979] “Gentle king,” said he, “the people who\r\nawait you here are lost, unless God and you have compassion on them.”\r\n“How!” cried Richard, “are any of them still living? Where are\r\nthey?” “Before the tower, awaiting their death.” Richard hesitated\r\nno longer. “God sent us here to suffer death, if need be; shame to\r\nhim who lags behind now!”[980] The royal galley, “painted all red,\r\nwith a red canopy on the deck, and a red flag,” shot forward;[981]\r\nthe king, without greaves or mail-shoes, sprang out, up to his waist\r\nin the water, came first ashore, and dashed into the midst of the\r\nTurks, cutting them down right and left. His shipmates followed close\r\nbehind him; the other vessels quickly came up, and each disembarked\r\nits freight of men; and in little more than an hour the shore of the\r\nharbour was cleared of Turks.[982] Bohadin, under whose eyes all\r\nthis had taken place, went round to Saladin’s tent in the rear and\r\nwhispered his tidings into the ear of the Sultan, who was writing (or\r\ndictating) a letter for the Patriarch and the chaplain to take back\r\nto their friends in the citadel. The envoys were present; Saladin\r\ndetained them till some flying Moslems passed the door of the tent.\r\nThen he placed the envoys under arrest, and ordered his whole army to\r\nretreat to Yazour.[983]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Richard, as soon as the harbour was cleared, had set his\r\nmen to barricade it on the land side with planks, barrels, pieces\r\nof old ships and boats, and other wood hastily piled up to form a\r\nrampart behind which they could safely defy the Saracens.[984] He\r\nhimself made his way “by [Sidenote: _Aug. 1_] a stair that led to\r\nthe house of the Templars” into the town, where he found a crowd of\r\nSaracens so busy pillaging that they made no attempt to interfere\r\nwhen he caused his banners to be reared on the walls as a signal\r\nto the Christians in the tower. These latter at once sallied forth\r\nto meet him, and the Turks, thus caught at unawares between two\r\nfires, were slaughtered wholesale. Then the victors turned towards\r\nthe retreating army of Saladin. The crossbowmen tried to overtake\r\nit with a volley of arrows; the king galloped after it on a horse\r\nwhich he had found in Joppa; but as this and two other horses, also\r\nfound in the town, were the only ones he possessed, he soon gave up\r\nthe pursuit, and pitched his tents on the site lately occupied by\r\nSaladin,[985] in the open ground where the Frank host had camped\r\nin the previous October, between Joppa and S. Habakkuk’s.[986] No\r\nsooner was Richard in his tent than several of Saladin’s emirs and\r\nfavourite Mameluks went to visit him; seemingly not as accredited\r\nenvoys from the Sultan, but to ascertain informally what was now\r\nthe king’s attitude towards the question of peace. He received them\r\nwillingly, and sent a special invitation to the chamberlain Abu Bekr,\r\nwho had previously acted as a medium of communication between him and\r\nSafadin, to join the assembly. Abu Bekr found him talking over the\r\nrecent fight in a tone half serious, half bantering. “That Sultan of\r\nyours is truly admirable! But why did he run away at my very landing?\r\nI did not come prepared to fight; I am still in my boating-sandals!\r\nWhy, in God’s Name, did he retreat, when I thought he could not\r\ntake Joppa in two months, and he took it in a couple of days!” Then\r\nhe turned to Abu Bekr and spoke seriously: “Greet the Sultan from\r\nme, and beg him to let us have peace. My country needs me, and the\r\nstate of things in this land is bad alike for you and for us.”\r\nSaladin was still close at hand, and twice in that night proposals\r\nand counter-proposals of terms passed between the two sovereigns.\r\nAscalon was still the stumbling-block; neither of them would renounce\r\nhis claim to it. To a daring suggestion of Richard’s, that Saladin\r\nshould enfeoff him after the manner of the Franks with the counties\r\nof Ascalon and Joppa, to hold by military service including, if\r\nrequired, the personal service of the king himself—“of which,” he\r\nadded, “you know the value”[987]—Saladin returned an answer in which\r\nAscalon was not named at all. The Sultan [Sidenote: _Aug. 2_] then\r\nfollowed his army to Yazour, and thence, early next morning, went\r\nto Ramlah.[988] Thither a messenger from Richard followed him, and\r\npressed for a definite cession of Ascalon. Saladin’s reply was given\r\ninstantly and finally: “It is impossible.”[989]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aug. 2-4_]\r\n\r\nThat Sunday and the two following days were spent by Richard and\r\nhis men in repairing the walls of Joppa as well as they could by\r\npiling up the stones without mortar or cement.[990] On one of these\r\nthree days they were joined by Count Henry, who came from Caesarea\r\nin a galley; the rest of the troops being still detained there by\r\n“the ambushes of the Turks” on land and the lack of ships to convey\r\nthem by sea.[991] It was seemingly to ascertain what chance there\r\nwas of intercepting these troops, of whose departure from Acre he\r\nhad only just been made aware, that Saladin on the [Sidenote: _Aug.\r\n4_] Monday (August 4) moved northward as far as the banks of the\r\nAoudjeh (the River of Arsuf). There, however, he further learned\r\nthat they were safe in Caesarea, and also that a not less important\r\nand probably easier prey lay within his reach—King Richard and his\r\nlittle band, in their unprotected tents in the fields outside Joppa.\r\nAt nightfall he turned back, hoping to surround Richard’s camp in\r\nthe darkness and surprise it at break of day.[992] The first body of\r\nMoslem troops which approached the camp, however, was discovered by a\r\nwatchful Crusader who at once aroused the king. Richard slipped his\r\nmail-coat over his night-gear, sprang bare-legged on horseback, and\r\nwith the few knights in his company—most of them dressed and armed\r\nin a like hasty fashion—began to array his men.[993] The Saracens,\r\nfinding they could not take him by surprise, sent a party to force an\r\nentrance through the still uncompleted walls into the town, in order\r\nto deprive him of a refuge there.[994] The scared townsfolk sent\r\nword to the king that they were all lost, for “a countless host of\r\nheathen” were taking possession of the city. Richard sternly silenced\r\nthe messenger, swore to cut off his head if he let anyone else hear\r\nthe message, and went on with his preparations for defence. Behind a\r\nlow barricade hastily made up of pieces of wood from the tents the\r\ntiny army was arrayed with the utmost skill[995] so as to leave in\r\nits ranks no opening for attack. Then the king addressed his men,\r\nbidding them have no fear of the foe; he himself, he added, would go\r\nand see what was taking place in the town.[996] His knights numbered\r\nsome [Sidenote: _Aug. 5_] three or four score,[997] but the horses\r\nonly six.[998] On these five of the knights and a “hardy and valiant”\r\nGerman man-at-arms named Henry, bearing the king’s banner,[999]\r\nmounted, and with a few crossbowmen[1000] followed the king as\r\nwith lance and sword he forced his way into Joppa. He probably\r\nfound its Turkish invaders engaged, as he had found them before, in\r\npillaging, and less numerous than the messenger had represented, for\r\nhe very soon drove them all out. After ordering a detachment of the\r\ngarrison to come down from the tower and guard the town against\r\nfurther attack,[1001] he rode down to the shore, brought back thence\r\nsome townsfolk who had fled to the ships for refuge, and all the\r\nsailors except just enough to take care of the ships, and with these\r\nreinforcements, in addition to his gallant six, rejoined his little\r\narmy in the field.[1002]\r\n\r\nSaladin meanwhile had arrayed his host in seven divisions.[1003]\r\nWhile the first of these was advancing to the attack, the king issued\r\nhis final orders. “Only keep your ranks unbroken—let not the foes\r\nmake their way in. If we stand thus firm against their first onset,\r\nwe may make light of the next, and by God’s help we shall defeat\r\nthem. But if I see one of you, through fear, giving way or yielding\r\nground or trying to flee, I swear by Almighty God I will straightway\r\ncut off his head!”[1004] So when the first division of the Turks\r\ncharged them the Christian ranks stood immoveable and impenetrable.\r\nThe attacking force fell back, baffled and amazed, stood for a\r\nwhile within two spears’ length of them without any interchange of\r\nhostilities except verbal ones, and then retired, grumbling, to its\r\noriginal position.[1005] Richard burst out laughing: “Did not I\r\ntell you how it would be? Now they have done their utmost; we have\r\nonly to stand firm against every fresh attempt, till by God’s help\r\nvictory shall be ours.”[1006] As he ceased speaking, another body\r\nof Turks came forth; they, too, fell back from the living wall, now\r\nfirmer than ever, and retired to their former station. This process\r\nwas repeated five or six times, while the day wore on “from prime\r\nalmost to nones.”[1007] The Arab historians relate that in one of\r\nthe intervals between these futile charges Richard rode alone, lance\r\nin hand, along the whole front of the Moslem army, challenging it\r\nto fight, and not a man came forth to meet him;[1008] according to\r\none account, he ended by stopping his horse midway between the two\r\nhosts, asking the Moslems for some food, and calmly dismounting to\r\neat what they gave him.[1009] It was not only the dread of him\r\nthat held the enemies in check; Saladin’s troops were thoroughly\r\ndiscontented with their ruler’s conduct of this expedition to Joppa\r\nand with its failure to bring them either the success or the booty\r\nwhich they had expected. In vain the Sultan rode up and down among\r\nthem, promising them splendid rewards for one more charge; his son\r\nEd-Daher sprang forward alone, only to be hastily called back by\r\nhis father, for not another man broke the stillness of the silent,\r\nmotionless ranks.[1010] At last, it seems, they yielded a sullen\r\nobedience to Saladin’s impassioned exhortations, and made another\r\nattempt to advance. But this time a volley of arrows, with which\r\nthe crossbowmen had hitherto speeded their retirement, greeted\r\nthem on their approach, and under cover of this the king and his\r\nmen charged. “Brandishing his lance, and laying about him as if he\r\nhad done nothing yet that day,”[1011] Richard with his few mounted\r\nfollowers burst right through the Turkish host and came out facing\r\nthe rearguard. Looking round, he saw that the earl of Leicester was\r\nunhorsed and in danger of capture; he at once rescued him and helped\r\nhim to remount. A crowd of Turks rushed at a banner which from its\r\ndevice—a lion—they probably took for the king’s, but which seems to\r\nhave been really that of Ralf of Mauléon. Ralf was surrounded, and\r\nwas actually being led away by his captors when he, too, was rescued\r\nby his sovereign.[1012] At another moment a large body of Turks\r\nclosed in upon Richard, all alone; but he laid about him with his\r\nsword, smiting off heads and limbs on every side, till he had slain\r\nor disabled so many of his assailants that the rest took to flight\r\n“as from the face of a furious lion.” His first sudden irruption had\r\nthrown into confusion the whole array of Saladin’s host; and when the\r\nguard which he had left in Joppa, seeing how matters were going, came\r\nout to help their comrades, the Moslem defeat became a rout.[1013] At\r\nthe close of the long day’s fighting the victor returned “with arrows\r\nsticking out all over him like the bristles of a hedgehog, and with\r\nhis horse in the same plight.”[1014] Saladin retired to Yazour, and\r\non the following day to Natroun.[1015]\r\n\r\nThe victory at Joppa was Richard’s crowning exploit in Holy Land; and\r\nhe himself very soon realized that it was to be his last. Both in him\r\nand his men the tremendous physical and mental strain of those five\r\nAugust days was followed by a sudden breakdown which was aggravated\r\nby the unhealthiness of their surroundings. The Turks when they\r\nevacuated Joppa had not only left in its streets the bodies of those\r\nwho had been slain in the siege, but also slaughtered all the pigs\r\nin the town and interspersed the carcases with the human corpses,\r\nas an insult to the Christians.[1016] No sanitary measures had been\r\npossible during the stress of the succeeding days; the consequence of\r\nthis state of things had therefore spread beyond the walls on every\r\nside, and the king and his men, too much exhausted to move far enough\r\nto escape from it, lay helpless and sick almost unto death.[1017]\r\nNevertheless, Richard’s next message to the Sultan was practically\r\na defiance. The envoy whom he had despatched on August 2 to Saladin\r\nat Ramlah had proceeded thence on a further mission to Safadin, who\r\nwas then lying sick at Gibeon, near Neby Samwîl.[1018] This envoy\r\nreturned to Joppa on the 7th or 8th[1019] with a message from Safadin\r\nproposing a colloquy. He was accompanied by the chamberlain Abu\r\nBekr. Richard gave an audience to Abu Bekr outside the town and said\r\nto him: “How far am I to put myself in the Sultan’s hand before he\r\nwill deign to receive me? Truly, I was very desirous of returning\r\nhome; but now I have decided to stay through the winter, and want no\r\nfurther conferences with you.”[1020] For nearly three weeks after\r\nthis, Saladin made no move of any kind; he was [Sidenote: _Aug. 20_]\r\nwaiting for reinforcements. On the 20th the long-desired contingent\r\nfrom Egypt at last arrived; and two days later the forces of the\r\nlands beyond the Euphrates were brought up by the Sultan’s once rebel\r\ngreat-nephew, El Mansour. Messengers still passed between the two\r\ncamps; Richard, exhausted by fever, asked Saladin for fruit and snow,\r\nwhich the Sultan readily sent him; the friendly intercourse enabling\r\neach party to learn how matters went with the other.[1021] Meanwhile\r\nRichard’s sickness was increasing, and so were his anxieties.\r\nIn vain he sent Count Henry back to Caesarea to insist that the\r\nlaggards there should come and help to hold the land; they would\r\nnot stir. Then he called Henry, the Templars, and the Hospitaliers\r\naround his bed, and begged that some of them would take charge of\r\nAscalon and others of Joppa, and thus set him free to seek pure air\r\nand medical treatment at Acre, as the only chance of restoring his\r\nhealth. “But they all declared they would not undertake the custody\r\nof the fortresses without him; and they went out [of his tent]\r\nwithout another word.”[1022] A [Sidenote: _Aug. 9-26_] proclamation\r\npublished throughout the coast-towns, calling upon all fit men to\r\ncome and serve under the king at his expense, brought a crowd of\r\nfoot-soldiers, but so few horsemen that he was compelled to reject\r\nthem all, both horse and foot, as useless for his purpose.[1023] As\r\nthe conviction grew upon him that he must either quit the country\r\nor die in it, he felt also that in either case, if he left it in\r\nits present unsettled condition, the whole labour of the Crusade\r\nwould be lost, and thus that a truce on almost any terms had become\r\na necessity for the realm’s sake as well as for his own.[1024]\r\nHe therefore asked that Abu Bekr might be sent to him once more.\r\nThrough this man the king intimated his willingness, if Saladin still\r\nabsolutely insisted on the restitution of Ascalon to the Moslems, to\r\naccept a money indemnity for the expense which he had incurred in\r\nfortifying the place, and to abide by the other conditions which he\r\nhad formerly agreed upon with Safadin.[1025]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow—Friday, August 28—Bedr-ed-din Dolderim, the emir in\r\ncommand of the Moslem advanced guard, sent to ask the Sultan whether\r\nhe might accede to a request which had been made to him by five Frank\r\nofficers, one of them an intimate counsellor of Richard’s—probably\r\nthe bishop of Salisbury, Hubert Walter[1026]—for a parley. With\r\nSaladin’s consent the parley took place; and the same night\r\nBedr-ed-din in person reported to his sovereign that, according to\r\nthese men, Richard now consented to give up Ascalon [Sidenote: _Aug.\r\n28_] unconditionally. Saladin refused to proceed further without\r\nsome security that on this point the king would not go back from\r\nhis word. Next day Bedr-ed-din announced that he had received, by a\r\nsure hand, Richard’s pledge on the subject. Saladin then called his\r\ncouncil together and with them drew up the details of the partition\r\nof the land. The king was to have Joppa and its dependent territory,\r\nexcept Ramlah, Lydda, Ibelin, Yebna, and Mirabel; also Acre, Haïfa,\r\nArsuf, and Caesarea, with all their dependencies except Nazareth and\r\nSafforia. These terms were drawn up in writing and carried back to\r\nRichard by an envoy who came from him on the afternoon of Saturday,\r\nAugust 29, and returned to Joppa with a Moslem colleague next day.\r\nRichard, when the terms were read to him, denied that he had ever\r\nwithdrawn his claim to compensation; but as “the persons who had gone\r\nto Dolderim” all declared that the thing was so, he answered: “If I\r\ndid say it, I will not go back from my word. Tell the Sultan I agree\r\nto these conditions; only I appeal to his generosity, and acknowledge\r\nthat if he grants me anything further, it will be of his own bounty.”\r\nHe then sent the envoys on to Safadin, to beg that he would obtain\r\nfrom Saladin the cession of Ramlah.[1027]\r\n\r\nSaladin was quite as anxious for a truce as Richard could be. On the\r\nnight of August 27 he had despatched several emirs on a reconnoitring\r\nexpedition to ascertain the chances of success in another attempt on\r\nJoppa, or, failing this, a night attack on Ascalon. They came back to\r\nhim at Ramlah with tidings that there were at Joppa scarcely three\r\nhundred mounted troops, most of whom had only mules for chargers.\r\nYet against this small and ill-mounted force Saladin dared not pit\r\nhis great army, “because,” says Bohadin, “he knew that his men were\r\nweakened and wearied and longing for their homes, and he feared that\r\nthey would refuse, as they had refused once already at Joppa, to\r\nattack the foe, or would desert him altogether.”[1028] He therefore\r\ndrew up his final terms on Monday, August 31. The truce was to last\r\nfor three years, beginning on Wednesday, September 22. Ramlah or\r\nLydda was to be added to the king’s share of the land, or even both\r\nplaces, unless he would be content with half of each; and Ascalon\r\nwas to be dismantled again. All the Moslem territories were to be\r\nincluded in the truce, and also the princes of Antioch and Tripoli.\r\nWhen on September 1 the schedule was brought to Richard, he said he\r\nwas too ill to read it, but he added: “I have already confirmed the\r\nagreement by giving my hand on it.” Count Henry and the other leaders\r\nwere then informed of its details, and accepted them all, including\r\nthe proposed partition of Lydda and Ramlah. Next day (Wednesday,\r\nSeptember 2) they and Saladin’s envoys all met in Richard’s tent.\r\nRichard again confirmed the truce by giving his hand to the Moslems;\r\nthey asked him for his oath, but he explained that it was not\r\ncustomary in the West for a king to swear on such occasions, and they\r\naccepted the explanation. The other Frank leaders then took the usual\r\noath, and several of them went back with the Moslems to Saladin’s\r\ncamp to witness his ratification of the treaty.[1029] Immediately\r\nafterwards Richard despatched to Saladin a special message setting\r\nforth his own purpose in making the truce. That purpose, he said, was\r\nfirst to revisit his home-lands and see how they did, and next, to\r\ncollect there men and money wherewith he hoped to return and to wrest\r\nfrom the Sultan the whole “Land of Jerusalem.” Saladin answered in\r\nthe spirit of true chivalry: if he were to lose the Land, he would\r\nrather it were won by Richard than by any prince whom he had ever\r\nknown.[1030]\r\n\r\nThe dismantling of Ascalon was a precaution on which Richard had\r\ninsisted when he found himself compelled to cede the place; if the\r\nMoslems must have it, they should at any rate be unable to make any\r\nmilitary use of it till they had had the expense and trouble of\r\nrebuilding it again. The work of demolition was entrusted to the\r\njoint superintendence of a party of Moslems and one of Franks, who\r\nall set out for Ascalon on September 5, and who were also to bring\r\nback its Frankish garrison.[1031] As under the terms of the truce\r\nChristian pilgrims were to have free access to the Holy Sepulchre,\r\nthe rest of the Franks at Joppa and many from Acre and elsewhere now\r\nbegan crowding to Jerusalem to fulfil their vow of pilgrimage.[1032]\r\nAn English writer tells us that some of them urged the king to do\r\nlikewise; “but his lofty spirit would not suffer him to accept from\r\nthe grace of a heathen ruler a privilege which he had been unable to\r\nobtain as a gift of God.”[1033] On the night of Tuesday, September\r\n9, he set out on his northward journey.[1034] Haïfa, in its quiet,\r\nsheltered corner between the foot of Carmel and the mouth of the\r\nKishon, and with its outlook northward across the sea to Acre at the\r\nopposite end of the bay, offered probably a better resting-place\r\nfor an invalid than Acre itself, to which it was near enough for\r\nmedical aid to be easily available. At Haïfa the king stayed a while\r\nto recover his strength.[1035] Then he went on to Acre and completed\r\nhis preparations for departure. He ransomed William des Préaux, who\r\nhad been made a voluntary prisoner in his stead in September 1191, by\r\nexchanging for him ten valuable Saracen captives.[1036] He called, by\r\npublic proclamation, all his creditors to come and claim whatever he\r\nowed them, that they might all be paid in full, “and even overpaid,\r\nlest there should be any complaints or disputes after he was gone\r\nabout anything that they had lost through him.”[1037] He had some\r\nmonths before made provision for the future of Cyprus, and also for\r\nthat of his earliest friend among the Franks in Holy Land, Guy of\r\nLusignan, who had so greatly helped him to conquer that island. He\r\nhad conquered it not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of\r\nthe Christian kingdom of Jerusalem, to which its preservation in\r\nfriendly hands was a matter of great importance. He at first agreed\r\nto make it over to the Order of the Temple for twenty-five thousand\r\nmarks;[1038] but this agreement came to nothing; and when Henry of\r\nChampagne was chosen King of Jerusalem in April 1192, Richard made\r\nsubstantial compensation to the displaced King Guy by giving him the\r\nisland realm of Cyprus.[1039] The grant was perhaps put into legal\r\nform during Richard’s last days at Acre.[1040] The two queens sailed\r\non Michaelmas day,[1041] the king on October 9.[1042]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe causes of the comparative failure of the third Crusade have been\r\nmuch discussed; yet after following in detail the story of that\r\nexpedition one is led to marvel not at its so-called failure, but\r\nat the extent of its success. The truce restored to the Christians,\r\nfor the period of its duration, the whole coast of Palestine from\r\nHaïfa to Joppa, left the southern remainder deprived of its chief\r\nstronghold, Ascalon, and secured to the pilgrims the right of free\r\nand safe access to the holy places of Jerusalem. If at its expiration\r\nRichard had been able to return—as he hoped and intended—to take up\r\nagain his task in Holy Land, he would have done so with far other\r\nprospects of success than those with which he and his followers had\r\nset out from Acre in 1190. Saladin himself regarded the position of\r\nthe Moslem power in Holy Land with grave misgiving. His own health\r\nwas failing, and he confessed to Bohadin his fears that in case of\r\nhis death the Franks would come forth from the strongholds which the\r\ntruce had placed in their hands, and once more become masters of the\r\ncountry.[1043] It was to Richard that the measure of success gained\r\nby the Crusade was mainly due; and this fact was fully recognized\r\nby the Moslems. A writer of the next generation reports that “the\r\nfear of him was so constantly in the hearts and on the lips of the\r\nSaracens that when their children cried they said to them, ‘Be quiet!\r\nEngland is coming!’ and when their horses started with affright, they\r\nmocked at them saying, ‘What is the matter? Is England in front of\r\nus?’”[1044] “England,” in the sense in which they used the word—as\r\nrepresenting England’s king—was destined never to confront them\r\nagain. But seven centuries later the attainment of the goal was to be\r\ngranted to “England” in another form, that of an army which, having\r\nset out from what Richard had once proposed to secure as the fittest\r\nstarting-point for the purpose—Egypt—finally closed round the Holy\r\nCity by ways in every one of which it was almost literally treading\r\nin the footsteps of the Lion-Heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nRICHARD AND EUROPE\r\n\r\n1192-1199\r\n\r\n                    —Thy harvest, fame;\r\n      Thy study, conquest; war, thy game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nRICHARD AND THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n1192-1194\r\n\r\n      There was I beaten down by little men,\r\n      Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword\r\n      And shadow of my spear had been enow\r\n      To scare them from me once.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a last visit to Cyprus[1045]—perhaps for the purpose of\r\nremoving the officers whom he had placed there and transferring the\r\ncustody of the island to representatives of Guy—Richard directed\r\nhis course straight for Marseille, and in less than a month was off\r\nthe coast of Barbary, within three days’ sail of his destination.\r\nDisquieting rumours had, however, reached him; from passing ships,\r\nor at sea-ports where he had touched, there had come to him repeated\r\nwarnings that the count of Toulouse, so long his determined enemy and\r\nnow his unwilling vassal, was in league with some of the neighbouring\r\nprinces and nobles to seize him as soon as he should land. He could\r\nnot but suspect that [Sidenote: _Oct.-Nov._] Philip Augustus was\r\neither an accomplice in the plot or would at least be only too\r\nready to support the plotters; he therefore suddenly altered his\r\ncourse, and sailed to Corfu.[1046] It is difficult to guess why he\r\ndid not proceed through the Pillars of Hercules direct to England.\r\nInstead, he seems to have deliberately chosen the much more hazardous\r\nadventure of a voyage up the Adriatic and an overland journey through\r\nthe territories of the Empire. His motives for this strange choice\r\ncan only be conjectured. He may have counted on a personal meeting\r\nwith Henry VI as a means of renewing and cementing the old alliance\r\nof England with the Empire, and thus securing a valuable support in\r\nthe struggle with France for which he knew he must prepare himself in\r\nevery possible way. But if so, the moment and the circumstances were\r\nextraordinarily ill chosen. Richard indeed could not fully know how\r\nuntoward the circumstances really were. That the young Emperor was as\r\nunscrupulous and false as his father had been upright and honourable;\r\nthat he was just then making an attempt—destined to failure—to obtain\r\npossession of Naples; that on his way back to Germany Philip would\r\nmeet him; and that there were symptoms of coming trouble in the\r\nEmpire from the party of Richard’s brother-in-law Henry of Saxony, to\r\nwhom Richard, like his father, had given shelter and protection, and\r\nat whose return to Germany in violation of an oath to set foot there\r\nno more Richard was said to have connived[1047]—all these things\r\nRichard could not know. But he did know, or ought to have known, that\r\nthe German contingent had been a source of constant disturbance in\r\nthe crusading host; that his own alliance with Tancred, the Emperor’s\r\nsuccessful rival for the crown of Sicily, had made the Emperor his\r\nnatural enemy; and that he had also a personal enemy—again of his\r\nown making—in Duke Leopold of Austria, who, though his territorial\r\npossessions were insignificant, was of considerable importance in\r\nGerman politics by reason of his close family connexion with the\r\nimperial house and with several of the chief feudataries of both the\r\nGerman and Italian realms.\r\n\r\nRichard’s scheme seems, in fact, to have been prompted by the spirit\r\nof sheer adventure and knight-errantry; and in the same spirit he\r\nset out to carry it into effect. On reaching Corfu he saw three\r\ngalleys lying off the coast of the mainland; he at once put off in\r\na little boat to hail them.[1048] [Sidenote: _Nov._] Their crews\r\nwere pirates, and instantly attacked the boat; but Richard, through\r\none of his sailors, entered into a parley with them, “and for their\r\nlaudable bravery and boldness” made a bargain that they should carry\r\nhim, with a few attendants,[1049] for two hundred marks of silver, to\r\nRagusa.[1050] Probably, and not unreasonably, he preferred to embark\r\nwith a crew as familiar with the intricacies of the Dalmatian coast\r\nas they were hardened to its perils. So furiously, however, did the\r\nwind drive the ships up the gulf that a wreck seemed imminent; and\r\nthe king made a solemn vow to spend a hundred thousand ducats in\r\nbuilding a church on whatever spot he should come safe to land.[1051]\r\nHe found refuge on a little rocky island called Lacroma, lying half a\r\nmile south of Ragusa, and at that time forming part of the territory\r\nof that city, which was an independent republic. The rulers of\r\nRagusa, on hearing of his arrival, begged him to accept a lodging\r\nin their city, and gave him a respectful and hospitable welcome.\r\nThe chief inhabitants of Lacroma were a community of Benedictine\r\nmonks; Richard at once proposed to fulfil his vow by rebuilding their\r\nmonastic church. The rulers of the republic, however, represented to\r\nhim that the sum which he had vowed was out of all proportion to the\r\nsize of the monastery and the requirements of the monks, and would\r\nbe far better employed in rebuilding the cathedral church of Ragusa\r\non a scale befitting its metropolitan dignity. To this he agreed,\r\non condition that the republic should obtain the Pope’s sanction to\r\nthis deviation from the terms of his vow, and should at its own cost\r\nrebuild the little church on the island; and that, further, the abbot\r\nof Lacroma, assisted by his monks, should have in perpetuity the\r\nprivilege of celebrating Mass in the cathedral church once a year,\r\non the feast of the Purification of our Lady. Hereupon, it seems,\r\n“the good king having borrowed a large sum of money for the purpose,”\r\nthe work was begun immediately. The zeal of the pilgrim king fired\r\nthat of the people of the diocese, and his gift, supplemented by\r\ncontributions from them, resulted in the erection of a church which\r\nfor nearly five centuries stood without a peer in Illyria for the\r\nstately grace of its proportions and the beauty of its architectural\r\ndetails.[1052] An earthquake destroyed it in 1667; but Richard had,\r\nall unknowing, laid in a nation’s heart the foundation of something\r\nmore precious and more lasting than any material edifice. The little\r\nrepublic of Ragusa kept her independence till 1810, when she was\r\nconquered by Napoleon. Four years later she was annexed to Dalmatia\r\nunder the yoke of Austria. Although never before incorporated into\r\nany of the Slavonic states which surrounded her, she had a natural\r\naffinity with them; the greater part of her inhabitants were, like\r\ntheirs, of Serbian blood. Her cause thus became bound up with that of\r\nthe whole Serb race in its aspirations after freedom and a national\r\nexistence. When there came upon that sorely tried race the darkest\r\nhour it had ever yet known, a Serbian statesman publicly appealed, as\r\nthe ground of his confidence in England’s help, to the memory of the\r\nmutual obligations formed more than seven centuries before between\r\nRagusa and Richard the Lion Heart.[1053]\r\n\r\nAt Ragusa the king took ship again. What port he really made for\r\nwe cannot tell; for he was wrecked a second time, and came finally\r\nashore somewhere between Aquileia and [Sidenote: _Nov.-Dec._]\r\nVenice.[1054] Stranded in this remote corner of the Italian\r\nborder-land, where almost every local magnate was a connexion or a\r\ndependent of either the house of Montferrat, the duke of Austria, or\r\nthe Emperor, or of all three, Richard suddenly awoke to his danger.\r\nHe despatched one of his followers to ask Count Mainard of Gorizia,\r\nthe most powerful noble of the district,[1055] for a safe-conduct\r\nfor the little party; he bade the messenger describe them as Baldwin\r\nde Béthune (who really was one of them), a merchant called Hugh,\r\nand their companions, all pilgrims returning from Jerusalem; and\r\nhe also—most unwisely—sought to gain the favour of the count by\r\nsending him, in the name of the “merchant Hugh,” a valuable ruby\r\nring. Mainard, who was a nephew of the marquis of Montferrat, gazed\r\nintently at the ring, and then said: “His name is not Hugh; it\r\nis Richard, the king. I have sworn to seize all pilgrims coming\r\nfrom those parts and to accept no gift from any of them; but for\r\nthe worthiness of this gift, and of him who has honoured me, a man\r\nunknown to him, by sending it, I return it and give him free leave\r\nto depart.” On receiving this message the terrified pilgrims bought\r\nsome horses and set off in the middle of the night,[1056] Richard,\r\naccording to one account, disguised in the habit of the Temple,[1057]\r\nof which Order there were several in the little company.[1058]\r\nTheir fears were well founded; Mainard and his men pursued them and\r\ncaptured eight of the party.[1059] The rest made their way through\r\nFriuli[1060] to Freisach in Carinthia;[1061] but Mainard had sent\r\nspies to dog their steps all the way, and warned his brother,\r\nFrederic of Pettau, to lie in wait for them there. Frederic chanced\r\nto have in his household a Norman from Argenton, named Roger, who\r\nhad been in his service twenty years and whom he trusted implicitly.\r\nHe bade this man search the houses where pilgrims were wont to\r\nlodge, if haply he might recognize the king by his speech or other\r\ntoken; promising Roger half of the town if the prize were captured.\r\nRoger soon penetrated his native sovereign’s disguise, and instead\r\nof delating him, besought him with tears to flee at once, gave him\r\nan excellent horse for the purpose, and then returned and told his\r\nlord that the reports about Richard were all false. Frederic flew\r\ninto a rage and ordered all the pilgrims to be arrested. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, Richard with two companions had slipped out of the town.\r\nFor three days and three nights they rode without food; then hunger\r\n[Sidenote: _Dec._] compelled them to halt at a little inn close to\r\nVienna.[1062] To pay for his lodging Richard was obliged to send one\r\nof his attendants, who could speak German, into the city to change\r\nsome bezants. The lad made too much display of his commission and\r\nof his self-importance; detained and questioned by the citizens, he\r\nsaid that he was in the service of a rich merchant who was coming\r\nto the city in three days. They let him go, and he hurried back to\r\nhis master and urged him to instant flight. Richard, however, was\r\nso exhausted by his adventures by sea and land that he determined\r\nto risk a few days’ longer stay, and sent the lad into the town\r\nagain several times to make purchases. Once—on December 20 or\r\n21—the messenger was careless enough to go with his master’s gloves\r\nstuck in his belt. He was seized by the authorities, beaten, and\r\ntortured till he confessed who his master really was. The duke of\r\nAustria, who was in the city, was immediately informed and the king’s\r\nlodging [Sidenote: _Dec. 20-2_] surrounded. Richard, feeling himself\r\nhelpless among such a crowd of “barbarians,” managed to make them\r\nunderstand that he was willing to surrender, but only to the duke in\r\nperson. Leopold came; Richard went forth to meet him and gave up his\r\nsword.[1063] Leopold sent him to “Dirmstein,”[1064] Dirnstein or\r\nDürrenstein, a remote castle in the mountains near Krems, and placed\r\nhim in charge of a strong guard who were to keep watch over him with\r\ndrawn swords [Sidenote: _Dec. 28_] day and night.[1065] A week later\r\nthe Emperor triumphantly announced to Philip of France the fate which\r\nhad overtaken “that foe of our Empire and disturber of your realm,\r\nthe king of England.”[1066]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1193 Jan. 6_]\r\n\r\nHenry was anxious to get Richard into his own keeping; but Leopold\r\nwas not disposed to part unconditionally with such a valuable\r\nprize. On January 6 he brought his prisoner before the Emperor at\r\nRatisbon.[1067] “The evil counsels of Duke Leopold’s rivals,” says\r\nan Austrian chronicler, “prevented an immediate conclusion of the\r\nmatter”; Richard was taken back to his Austrian prison,[1068] and\r\nit was not till February 14 that the Emperor and the duke came to\r\nterms. They began by laying down conditions to be required of the\r\nking for his release. They decided that he should give the Emperor a\r\nhundred thousand marks of silver, whereof Leopold should have half as\r\nthe dowry of Richard’s niece Eleanor of Britanny, who should marry\r\nLeopold’s son; the marriage to take place and half the ransom to be\r\npaid and divided at Michaelmas, the other half in the following Lent.\r\nRichard was to set free, without ransom, Leopold’s relations Isaac\r\nof Cyprus and his daughter. He was to give the Emperor fifty galleys\r\nmanned and furnished at his own cost, and carrying a hundred knights\r\nand fifty crossbowmen; he was also to go in person, with another\r\nhundred knights and fifty crossbowmen, with Henry to Sicily and\r\nhelp him to conquer it. In other words, the king of England was to\r\nbe brought down to the level of the dukes of Austria and Suabia and\r\nBavaria as a vassal of the Empire, within which neither he nor any of\r\nhis predecessors, English, Norman, Angevin, or Poitevin, had ever\r\nheld a particle of land. For the fulfilment of these conditions he\r\nwas to give Henry two hundred hostages, who were not to be released\r\ntill he had, furthermore, obtained for Leopold absolution from\r\nRome—for the Pope on hearing of the capture of the royal Crusader had\r\nat once excommunicated his captor.[1069] If Richard did not fulfil\r\nall these conditions within a year, fifty of his hostages or he\r\nhimself, as Leopold might choose, should be restored to the latter.\r\nThe Emperor had to give his Austrian vassal two hundred sureties\r\nfor the fulfilment of two further stipulations exacted by Leopold\r\n[Sidenote: _Feb._] before he would part with his prize. In case of\r\nHenry’s death while Richard was in his custody, Richard was to be\r\ngiven back to Leopold; and in case of Leopold’s death his son was to\r\nstep into his place for all the purposes of the treaty.[1070]\r\n\r\nHenry of Hohenstaufen was a political visionary, obsessed, more\r\nstrongly perhaps than any other German ruler before our own day, by\r\nthe German dream of world-dominion; yet even he can scarcely have had\r\nany real hope of extorting Richard’s consent to the terms laid down\r\nin this curious document. Leopold of Austria was a practical-minded\r\nperson, and moreover knew Richard too well to have any illusions\r\non the subject; hence the strong safeguards by which he secured\r\nhis claims as the original captor of the prize—safeguards which\r\nHenry dared not refuse to grant him. The Emperor could not afford\r\nto forfeit either the friendship of the duke of Austria or the\r\nadvantages which the possession of Richard’s person would involve.\r\nIn the autumn of 1191 Henry had made an attempt to take possession\r\nof Naples, and it had failed. The Guelfs had profited by his absence\r\nfrom Germany to stir up discontent and prepare a rising there. In\r\nNovember 1192 the bishop of Liége was murdered; the malcontents\r\nascribed the sacrilegious crime to the instigation of the Emperor.\r\nThe dukes of Brabant and Limburg (one of whom was brother and the\r\nother uncle to the murdered prelate) and the archbishop of Cologne\r\nwere soon up in arms; the archbishop of Mentz, the duke of Bohemia,\r\nand other feudataries quickly followed their example; and at the back\r\nof the whole disturbance was King Richard’s brother-in-law, the old\r\nSaxon “Lion.” Nearly half Germany was in revolt.[1071] It was thus a\r\nmatter of the utmost importance for the Emperor to secure the support\r\nof the duke of Austria, whose power and influence already extended\r\nconsiderably beyond the limits of the little territory from which he\r\ntook his chief title. Outside his own realm Henry of Germany had now\r\none ally, though the alliance was a secret one. Philip of France had\r\ntravelled home from Palestine very leisurely[1072] by way of Italy;\r\nearly in December 1191 he had met the Emperor at Milan,[1073] and\r\ntheir meeting had resulted in an agreement, private and informal,\r\nbut well understood between them, to make common cause for the ruin\r\nof Richard. The capture of the English king gave them an opening\r\nfor joint action sooner than they could have expected; and it also\r\ngave Henry an opportunity of posing before his malcontent vassals\r\nas supreme ruler, judge, and arbiter of all Europe. The actual\r\ntransfer of Richard from Leopold’s custody to Henry’s did not take\r\nplace till more than a month after the Würzburg compact was made;\r\nit was evidently thus arranged that it might coincide with the\r\ngathering of the imperial court for the Easter festival. On the\r\nTuesday in Holy Week, probably at Spire, Richard was brought before\r\nthe Emperor. Henry seems to have begun by demanding the full terms\r\ndrawn up at Würzburg; we are told that he “required many things to\r\nwhich the king felt he could not consent, were it to save his very\r\nlife.” Next, the Emperor brought against his captive a string of\r\naccusations, charging him with betrayal of the Holy Land,[1074]\r\ncomplicity in the death of Conrad, and violation of some agreement\r\nor compact said to have been made with Henry himself. Finally, some\r\nenvoys from France, whose appearance at this opportune moment must\r\nsurely have been pre-arranged, came forward and publicly “defied”\r\nthe English king in their sovereign’s name. Richard, however, was\r\nready with an answer to everything; he offered to stand to right in\r\nPhilip’s court concerning the matters in dispute between Philip and\r\nhimself, and met the Emperor’s charges with a fearless readiness\r\nwhich enhanced the general admiration already won for him by his\r\nfrank yet dignified bearing. Henry saw that the feeling of the\r\nassembly was with the prisoner; so he suddenly changed his tone,\r\nassumed the character of Richard’s protector and friend, undertook\r\nto make agreement between him and Philip, and while “the people who\r\nstood around wept for joy,” showered upon him tokens of honour and\r\npromises of aid and publicly gave him the kiss of peace. Hereupon\r\nRichard, “through the mediation of the duke of Austria,” promised\r\nthe Emperor a hundred thousand marks by way of ransom and reward.\r\nHenry answered that if his arbitration should not be successful he\r\nwould be satisfied without any payment at all; but according to some\r\nenvoys from England who were present, he on Maunday Thursday formally\r\naccepted Richard’s offer with the addition of a promise on Richard’s\r\npart to furnish him with fifty fully equipped galleys and two hundred\r\nknights for a year’s service.[1075] The show of friendliness was\r\nmaintained, it seems, till the Easter festivities were over; then,\r\nwhen the court broke up, Henry despatched his prisoner to Triffels, a\r\nstrong fortress on the highest point of the mountains between Suabia\r\nand Lorraine. The castle was said to have been built specially to\r\nserve as a prison for traitors to the Empire,[1076] and the imperial\r\ninsignia were also kept in it.[1077] Here the king was placed under a\r\nstrong guard of soldiers “picked out from among all the Germans for\r\nstrength and bravery.” Girt with swords, they kept watch on him, as\r\nLeopold’s soldiers had done, day and night, and formed round his bed\r\na ring which none of his own servants who shared his captivity were\r\never allowed to penetrate.[1078]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the justiciars in England heard of their sovereign’s\r\ncaptivity they took what steps they could in his behalf. They sent\r\nBishop Savaric of Bath, who claimed some kinship with the house of\r\nHohenstaufen, to negotiate with the Emperor for his release,[1079]\r\nand they endeavoured to ascertain where he was confined. All the\r\nworld knows the story, put into its earliest and most charming\r\nliterary shape by a French minstrel some seventy years later, which\r\nhas for all after-time linked the name of its hero Blondel with that\r\nof the royal _trouveur_.[1080] Blondel de Nesle, a _trouveur_ of some\r\ndistinction, was a contemporary of Richard, and the story in itself\r\nis not impossible. The minstrel of Reims represents Blondel as having\r\nfound Richard in the custody of the duke of Austria; if so, he must\r\nhave set out at the very first tidings of the capture. The searchers\r\nofficially sent from England, the abbots of Boxley and Robertsbridge,\r\nevidently went after the object of their search was known to have\r\nbeen transferred into the hands of the Emperor. They “wandered over\r\nall Alemannia” (western Germany or Suabia) “without finding him,”\r\ntill they met him on Palm Sunday (March 21) at Ochsenfurt on his\r\nway to Spire. His guards evidently allowed them to confer with him\r\nfreely; he was naturally delighted at the meeting, and questioned\r\nthem eagerly about the state of his realm and the attitude of his\r\nvassals.[1081] The tidings they had to give him were not altogether\r\nsatisfactory. England was tranquil and loyal, in spite of John’s\r\nefforts to make it otherwise. In Aquitaine a rising of the count\r\nof Périgord, the viscount of La Marche, and “nearly all the Gascon\r\nbarons,” had been crushed by the seneschal of Gascony with the help\r\nof Richard’s brother-in-law, the son of the king of Navarre, and the\r\nvictors had swept the country almost to the gates of Toulouse.[1082]\r\nBut the Norman and Angevin lands sorely [Sidenote: 1191 _Dec._]\r\nneeded the presence of their lord. At the close of 1191 King Philip\r\nhad reached Paris, and invited or summoned the seneschal and magnates\r\nof Normandy to a meeting which [Sidenote: 1192] took place at Gisors\r\non January 20, 1192.[1083] He demanded the restitution of Aloysia\r\n(who was in the tower at Rouen) [Sidenote: _Jan._] and of Gisors, and\r\nthe cession of the counties of Eu and Aumale, in virtue, seemingly,\r\nof a document which he exhibited as “the agreement made between\r\nhimself and the king of England at Messina.” They answered that they\r\nhad no orders from Richard on the subject and would not act without\r\nthem.[1084] Philip then invited John to come over from England and\r\nreceive investiture of all Richard’s continental territories, and\r\nthe hand of Aloysia. John was nothing loth, but was detained in\r\nEngland by a threat from his mother and the justiciars to seize all\r\nhis castles there if he crossed the sea. Next, Philip summoned his\r\nhost for an invasion of Normandy; but his barons refused to attack\r\n[Sidenote: 1193] the lands of an absent Crusader.[1085] Early in\r\nthe following year—as soon as Richard was known to be safely out of\r\nthe way in a German prison—John made another attempt to seduce the\r\nNorman barons from their allegiance. Failing in this, he proceeded\r\ninto France and did homage to Philip on the conditions which had been\r\nproposed a year before.[1086]\r\n\r\nThus matters stood when the two English abbots set out on their\r\nquest. They were present at the Maunday Thursday assembly at Spire,\r\nand on their return home reported that “peace” had been there made\r\nbetween the Emperor and the king.[1087] If Richard was under the\r\nsame delusion, he must have been speedily undeceived when he found\r\nhimself shut up within the gloomy walls of Triffels and denied all\r\nfurther access to Henry’s presence.[1088] On the other hand, Henry\r\nwas in all likelihood quite as much disappointed by the failure of\r\nall attempts to break the spirit of his prisoner. If we may trust\r\nan English chronicler whose information was probably derived from\r\nan eye-witness, Richard never gave his jailers the satisfaction of\r\nseeing a cloud on his brow; he was “always cheery and full of jest in\r\ntalk, fierce and bold in action, according to circumstances. He would\r\ntease his warders with rough jokes, and enjoy the sport of making\r\nthem drunk, and of trying his own strength against that of their big\r\nbodies.”[1089] His deeper feelings were expressed in a song,[1090]\r\naddressed to his half-sister Countess Mary of Champagne, which he\r\nseems to have composed in two languages, French and Provençal, in\r\nthe autumn or early in the winter of 1193, and which may be roughly\r\ntranslated thus:\r\n\r\n      “Feeble the words, and faltering the tongue\r\n        Wherewith a prisoner moans his doleful plight;\r\n      Yet for his comfort he may make a song.\r\n        Friends have I many, but their gifts are slight;\r\n        Shame to them if unransomed I, poor wight,\r\n            Two winters languish here!\r\n\r\n      “English and Normans, men of Aquitaine,\r\n        Well know they all who homage owe to me\r\n      That not my lowliest comrade in campaign\r\n        Should pine thus, had I gold to set him free;\r\n        To none of them would I reproachful be—\r\n            Yet—I am prisoner here!\r\n\r\n      “This have I learned, here thus unransomed left,\r\n        That he whom death or prison hides from sight\r\n      Of kinsmen and of friends is clean bereft;\r\n        Woe’s me! but greater woe on these will light.\r\n        Yea, sad and full of shame will be their plight\r\n            If long I languish here.\r\n\r\n      “No marvel is it that my heart is sore\r\n        While my lord[1091] tramples down my land, I trow;\r\n      Were he but mindful of the oath we swore\r\n        Each to the other, surely do I know\r\n        That thus in duresse I should long ago\r\n            Have ceased to languish here.\r\n\r\n      “My comrades whom I loved and still do love—\r\n        The neighbour-lords who were my friends of yore—[1092]\r\n      Strange tales have reached me that are hard to prove;\r\n        I ne’er was false to them; for evermore\r\n        Vile would men count them, if their arms they bore\r\n            ’Gainst me, a prisoner here!\r\n\r\n      “And they, my knights of Anjou and Touraine—\r\n        Well know they, who now sit at home at ease,\r\n      That I, their lord, in far-off Allemaine\r\n        Am captive. They should help to my release;\r\n        But now their swords are sheathed, and rust in peace,\r\n            While I am prisoner here.”\r\n\r\nTwo other visitors besides the abbots seem to have found their way\r\nto Richard before his incarceration at Triffels; the English Bishop\r\nHubert of Salisbury, who, learning in Sicily on his way home from\r\nPalestine what had befallen his sovereign, changed his own course\r\nand hurried to seek him out;[1093] and a Norman chaplain, William\r\nof Sainte-Mère-Eglise. This latter Richard, before his own removal\r\nfrom Spire, despatched to England on business connected with the\r\narrangements for the fulfilment of his promises to Henry, and also\r\nfor the elevation of Hubert to the see of Canterbury.[1094] Hubert\r\nfollowed about the middle of April.[1095] Meanwhile Bishop William\r\nof Ely had also come to the help of his royal master and friend. He\r\nhad been exiled from England by the queen-mother and the justiciars\r\nin 1191 for misgovernment; but his personal loyalty to the king seems\r\nnever to have failed, and was certainly not doubted by Richard, who\r\nhad never deprived him of his office of chancellor. Through his\r\ndiplomacy the Emperor was induced to let his prisoner be brought to\r\nmeet [Sidenote: _April 19_] him at Hagenau. On April 19 Richard,\r\nwriting thence to his mother and his lieges in England, related that\r\nthe Emperor and Empress and their court had welcomed him with all\r\nhonour and loaded him with gifts, and that “an indissoluble mutual\r\nbond of love” had been formed between him and Henry, each promising\r\nto help the other to obtain and retain his rights against all men;\r\nand that he was “staying with the Emperor”[1096] till some other\r\nmatters should be settled between them and seventy thousand marks\r\nof the ransom paid. He urgently desired that this sum and hostages\r\nfor the rest should be collected with all speed and sent over under\r\nthe care of the bishop of Ely, whom he was apparently despatching to\r\nEngland for that purpose. “Know ye for certain,” he added, “that were\r\nwe in England and free, we would give as great a sum, or a greater,\r\nto secure the conditions which by God’s grace we have obtained, and\r\nif we had not the money to our hand we would give our own person in\r\npledge for it to the Emperor rather than leave uncompleted that which\r\nhas been done.”[1097]\r\n\r\nRichard evidently anticipated a speedy release, for he sent to\r\nEngland not only for money and hostages, but also for ships, and for\r\nthe captain of his own ship, Alan Trenchemer; and bade Robert of\r\nTurnham proceed thither “with his” (_i. e._ the king’s) “military\r\naccoutrements”—as if he expected soon to require them there.[1098]\r\nHe seems to have really believed that the new agreement secured\r\nfor him the Emperor’s active support in the matter about which he\r\nwas most anxious—the impending struggle with Philip. The seneschal\r\nand baronage of Normandy, as a body, had rejected the treasonable\r\nproposals of John; but there was one traitor among them; on April\r\n12[1099] Gilbert of Vacoeil, the constable of Gisors and Néaufle,\r\nsurrendered these two castles to the king of France. With these keys\r\nof the border in his hands, Philip had no difficulty in entering\r\nthe duchy. In a few weeks he was master of the whole Vexin, the\r\ncounty of Aumale, and the lands of Vaudreuil, Neufbourg, [Sidenote:\r\n_April-May_] Evreux, and Gournay.[1100] He was thus in full career\r\nof success when on hearing of the Hagenau agreement he urgently\r\nbesought the Emperor either to hand Richard over to him free “as his\r\nhomager,” or to keep him in a German prison as long as possible;\r\nand he backed his request with a heavy bribe in money.[1101] Henry\r\nsaw that he could not make friends of both kings, and he was in\r\ndoubt which of the two would be the most useful friend or the\r\nmost dangerous foe; so he staved off the decision for a time,\r\nplaced Richard in confinement at Worms,[1102] and arranged to hold\r\na conference with Philip at Vaucouleurs on June 24 or 25.[1103]\r\nBefore that day came, however, the French alliance had ceased to be\r\nof much consequence to Henry; for the matter in which he had been\r\nmost anxious to obtain Philip’s support, his quarrel with his own\r\nfeudataries, had been settled by other means. Richard, fearing that\r\nif Henry and Philip should meet he would be given up to the latter,\r\n“exerted himself greatly” that the meeting should be prevented, and,\r\nto this end, that the Emperor and the German magnates should come\r\nto an agreement; which, “owing to his urgency,” they did.[1104] The\r\nresult was that instead of a conference with Philip at Vaucouleurs,\r\nHenry on June 25 opened at Worms a great Court[1105] which sat for\r\nfive days, and at which there were present, besides a crowd of his\r\nown vassals, spiritual and temporal, four representatives of King\r\nRichard—the bishops of Bath and Ely, and two of the justiciars from\r\nEngland[1106]—and on the 29th the whole assembly confirmed by an oath\r\n“on the soul of the Emperor” a new agreement between Henry and his\r\nroyal prisoner.[1107] The money total for the ransom was now raised\r\nto a hundred and fifty thousand marks, of which a hundred thousand\r\nwere to be fetched from England by envoys who were to be despatched\r\nthither by both sovereigns immediately. Richard was to give sixty\r\nhostages to Henry for thirty thousand marks more, and seven hostages\r\nto Leopold for the remaining twenty thousand. When these hostages\r\nand the first hundred thousand marks were all received, Richard was\r\nto be set free. There was, however, an alternative: “If the king\r\nshould fulfill the promise which he formerly made to the Emperor\r\nconcerning Henry sometime Duke of Saxony, the Emperor, letting the\r\nking off fifty thousand marks, shall pay for him twenty thousand to\r\nthe Duke of Austria”; no hostages would then be required, and Richard\r\nshould be liberated as soon as the hundred thousand [Sidenote: _June\r\n29_] marks were paid and his promise fulfilled. Furthermore, Richard\r\ntook an oath that in either case he would within seven months of his\r\nreturn home send his niece to Germany to be married to Leopold’s\r\nson.[1108]\r\n\r\nWhat was the promise which Richard had made to the Emperor concerning\r\nHenry the Lion, when it was made, and whether or not it was ever\r\nfulfilled, we cannot tell; the only known mention of the matter is\r\nthe passage quoted above. From the fact that Richard did on his\r\nrelease leave some hostages in Germany we might infer that he had\r\nnot done what he had promised; but this inference is doubtful,\r\nfor we shall see that the conditions of his release were altered\r\nagain before Henry let him go. Richard’s next step was to seize\r\nhis opportunity, while negotiations between Henry and Philip were\r\nat a standstill, to make overtures to Philip. Immediately after\r\nthe council at Worms he despatched William of Ely to France with\r\norders to make “some sort of a peace” for him with the king. This\r\nWilliam did at Mantes on July 9. The terms consisted of a promise\r\nin Richard’s name that he would leave to Philip’s discretion the\r\ndisposal of whatever territories within the Angevin dominions\r\nwere then occupied by Philip himself or by his men; that he would\r\nperform the homages and services due for all and each of his French\r\nfiefs, would grant an amnesty and restitution of their lands to\r\ncertain of his vassals[1109] who had incurred forfeiture, and would\r\nclear off the debt which, it seems, Philip still claimed under the\r\ntreaty of 1189, by paying him twenty thousand marks in half-yearly\r\ninstalments of five thousand marks each, the first instalment to be\r\npaid within six months after the payer’s release from captivity,\r\nand Philip meanwhile to hold in pledge the castles of Loches,\r\nChâtillon-sur-Indre, Driencourt and Arques; one of these to be\r\nrestored to Richard on the payment of each instalment of the money.\r\nPhilip promised that meanwhile, as soon as the castles were placed in\r\nhis custody, he would “receive the King of England into his favour\r\nand make request to the Emperor for his liberation.”[1110]\r\n\r\nIn less than six months the German envoys returned from England,\r\nbringing with them “the greater part” of the ransom—seemingly the\r\nstipulated hundred thousand marks, for the Emperor wrote on December\r\n20 to the English prelates, barons, and people, and Richard on\r\nDecember 22 to the new archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter,\r\nannouncing that the captive’s liberation was to take place on\r\nMonday, January 17; adding that on the following Sunday (January\r\n23, 1194) he was to receive the crown of the kingdom of Provence\r\nwhich the Emperor had granted to him.[1111] Richard’s place of\r\nconfinement at this time was probably Spire. There, on the appointed\r\nday, Henry held [Sidenote: 1194 _Jan. 17_] a council which “after\r\nlong discussion” was adjourned to [Sidenote: _Feb. 2_] re-assemble\r\nat Mentz on Candlemas Day.[1112] At this adjourned meeting Richard\r\nwas present, with his mother, Archbishop Walter of Rouen, and the\r\nbishops of Ely and Bath, who had all come to witness his release. To\r\nthe amazement of all parties, Henry proposed a yet further delay,\r\nand shamelessly avowed his motive for the proposal. He had received\r\nin a private audience at Spire, in January, some messengers charged\r\nwith letters from Philip and John. He now brought these messengers\r\nbefore the council, and handed the letters to Richard. In them the\r\nLion-Heart’s overlord and his brother made to the Emperor three\r\nalternative offers. He should receive from Philip fifty thousand\r\nmarks and from John thirty thousand if he would keep Richard prisoner\r\ntill Michaelmas; or a thousand pounds of silver (seemingly from\r\nthe two jointly) every month, so long as he chose to keep him; or\r\na hundred thousand marks from Philip and fifty thousand marks from\r\nJohn if he would either keep him another twelvemonth or deliver him\r\nup to them. Richard, in utter desperation, appealed to the prelates\r\nand princes who had stood surety for the Emperor’s fulfilment of\r\nthe treaty drawn up at Worms.[1113] Two of them—the archbishops of\r\nMentz and Cologne—protested strongly against a breach of so solemn an\r\nagreement; the other members of the council seem to have taken the\r\nsame side; and after a [Sidenote: _Feb. 4_] two days’ struggle Henry\r\nyielded.[1114]\r\n\r\nThe day was a Friday; “an unlucky day,” remarks an English chronicler\r\nof the time.[1115] There was a special reason for the remark. Henry,\r\nas we have seen, had promised to invest Richard on his release with\r\nthe kingdom of Arles or Burgundy. This kingdom, as such, had ceased\r\nto exist more than a century and a half before, and over a great\r\npart of the lands which had composed it the German Emperors had\r\nnow no practical authority or control. It seems that at the last\r\nmoment Henry suddenly required his prisoner to do him homage, not\r\nfor Burgundy—of which we hear no more—but for all the possessions of\r\nthe Angevin house, including the kingdom of England; and Richard,\r\nseeing no way of escape, and urged by his mother, went through a\r\nceremony of surrender, investiture and homage Which, if it had been\r\nbinding, would have made him a vassal of the Empire for the whole\r\nof his dominions.[1116] Such a transaction was, however, void in\r\nlaw, on two grounds. Firstly, no account was taken in it either\r\nof the French king’s rights as overlord of Richard’s continental\r\nterritories, or of the immemorial right of the English Crown to\r\nabsolute independence. Secondly, Richard had been driven to it under\r\ncompulsion, as the only means of regaining his freedom and rescuing\r\nhis dominions from imminent peril—for a refusal would certainly have\r\nresulted in an immediate alliance between Henry and Philip. Homage\r\ndone under such conditions was a mere empty form, a concession to the\r\nvanity of the Emperor, who was ready to clutch at any expedient for\r\nmagnifying himself in the eyes of his own vassals and inflicting as\r\nmuch outward degradation as he dared on the captive whom he—seeing\r\nthat he could now wring out of him no further profit, financial or\r\npolitical—thereupon set at liberty.[1117]\r\n\r\nRichard’s first act was the despatch of a messenger to Henry of\r\nChampagne and the other Christian nobles in Syria to tell them that\r\nhe was free, “and that, if God would avenge him of his enemies\r\nand grant him peace, he would at the appointed time come to help\r\nthem against the heathens.” [Sidenote: _Feb. 4_] On the same day\r\nthe Emperor and his magnates wrote to Philip and John bidding them\r\ndeliver up immediately whatever they had taken from Richard during\r\nhis captivity; otherwise restitution would be enforced by the writers\r\nto the uttermost of their power.[1118] Protected by an imperial\r\nsafe-conduct to Antwerp, and accompanied by his mother and his\r\nchancellor, Richard set out on a leisurely progress down the Rhine.\r\nAt Cologne he was sumptuously [Sidenote: _Feb. 20-22_?] entertained\r\nfor three days in the archbishop’s palace, and on the third day\r\nwas asked to attend Mass in the church of S. Peter. The day was\r\nprobably the festival of S. Peter’s Chair at Antioch (February 22);\r\nArchbishop Adolf chose to act as precentor, and began the Mass not\r\nwith the proper introit, but with that of the feast of S. Peter in\r\nChains—“Now know I of a surety that the Lord hath sent His Angel and\r\nhath delivered me out of the hand of Herod.” The choice was doubtless\r\nmade in compliment to the royal guest; whether the archbishop failed\r\nto notice, or deliberately ignored, the comparison of the Emperor to\r\nHerod which it involved, we are not told. Adolf indeed was only one\r\nof a crowd of imperial feudataries who were eager to make a friend\r\nof the English king. By the time Richard arrived at Antwerp not only\r\nAdolf but also the archbishop of Mentz, the bishop-elect of Liége,\r\nthe dukes of Austria, Suabia, Louvain, and Limburg, the count of\r\nHolland, the son of the count of Hainaut, the marquis of Montferrat,\r\nand many others, were bound to him by homage and fealty—saving, of\r\ncourse, their fealty to the Emperor—for certain revenues which he\r\ngranted them by charter, on condition of their help against the\r\nking of France.[1119] Possibly the Emperor may have taken alarm\r\nat [Sidenote: _Feb._] these alliances between his vassals and his\r\nlate captive, for one English chronicler tells us that he sent out\r\nsome men to overtake and recapture him.[1120] Richard, however,\r\nunder the personal escort of Archbishop Adolf, passed through the\r\nlands of the duke of Louvain to Antwerp, where some of his own\r\nships awaited him.[1121] The wind being unfavourable for a direct\r\npassage to England,[1122] he slowly made his way by sea to a port\r\nwhich Roger of Howden calls “Swine in Flanders, in the lands of the\r\nCount of Hainaut”—either Swyn, between Breeden and Ostend, in the\r\npresent West Flanders, or Zwin, on the Belgian frontier of the Dutch\r\nprovince of Seeland—coasting along by day in Alan Trenchemer’s galley\r\n“because in that it was easier to pass through among the islands,”\r\nand spending the nights on “a large and splendid ship which had\r\ncome from Rye.” Swine was [Sidenote: _March 4-7_] reached in three\r\ndays; five more were spent in waiting there for a wind; at last, on\r\nMarch 12 or 13, the king landed at Sandwich, and straightway went\r\nto offer up his thanksgivings at the shrine of S. Thomas the Martyr\r\nat Canterbury.[1123] On [Sidenote: _March 16_] March 16 he entered\r\nLondon in a triumphal procession to S. Paul’s.[1124] Clergy and\r\npeople gave him a rapturous welcome; and the sumptuous decorations\r\nof the city were beheld with amazement by some German nobles who\r\naccompanied him, and who had supposed the wealth of England to be\r\nexhausted by his ransom. One of them, it is said, actually told him\r\nthat he would not have been released without a much heavier payment\r\nif the Emperor could have known that such riches existed in the\r\nisland realm.[1125]\r\n\r\nThe welcome was mainly a clerical and popular one, because most of\r\nthe lay barons were occupied in trying to put down a revolt stirred\r\nup by John. They had made some progress towards this end before\r\nRichard’s arrival; most of John’s castles had been captured, but two,\r\nNottingham and Tickhill, were still holding out. Richard went to work\r\nleisurely. He spent “scarcely a day” in London; but he left it to\r\nmake another pilgrimage, to S. Edmund’s.[1126] He knew that he could\r\nafford to wait. Both castles were closely besieged, the one by the\r\nearls of Huntingdon, Chester, and Ferrars, the other by the bishop\r\nof Durham. Another great rebel stronghold, Mount Saint Michael’s in\r\nCornwall, had surrendered before the king’s return because at the\r\ntidings of his coming its commandant died of fright. The garrison\r\nof Tickhill now sent two knights to ascertain whether the king was\r\nreally home, and if he were, to offer him the castle. He refused to\r\nreceive it unless they would all surrender at discretion. While\r\nthe envoys carried this message back to Tickhill, he marched upon\r\nNottingham,[1127] and on March 25 arrived there “with such a numerous\r\nforce and such a noise of trumpets and horns” as greatly alarmed the\r\ngarrison; nevertheless, hoping that all this was merely a display\r\ncontrived by the nobles to make them believe the king had returned,\r\nthey continued to shoot from the walls, and shot down some of his men\r\nalmost at his feet. At this he waxed wroth and assaulted the castle.\r\nOne rebel knight was killed by a bolt from Richard’s own crossbow;\r\nthe barbicans were taken and the outer gates burnt.[1128] The place\r\nwas, however, of such strength as to appear, if well defended,\r\nimpregnable except by starvation; and it was amply supplied with\r\nprovisions as well as with men.[1129] Next morning Richard began to\r\nprepare his stone-casters, and also set up in view of the castle a\r\ngallows on which he hanged some of John’s men-at-arms who had been\r\ncaptured outside it. Meanwhile Tickhill had been surrendered to\r\nBishop Hugh on his assurance that the lives of the garrison should\r\nbe spared; and on March 27 he, with his prisoners, joined the\r\nking.[1130] That day, while the king was at dinner, the constables\r\nof Nottingham castle sent two men “to see him” and report “what they\r\nsaw and heard.” Till then the Nottingham constables had not believed\r\nthat their sovereign was really in England. Their messengers “looked\r\nat him well, and recognized him. ‘Am I the king? What think you?’\r\nhe asked them. They said ‘Yes.’ ‘Then you may go back; go free, as\r\nis right; and do the best you can.’”[1131] [Sidenote: _March 28_]\r\nOn their report the two constables, with twelve followers, went and\r\nplaced themselves at Richard’s mercy; and on the morrow the castle\r\nwas surrendered on the same terms by the rest of the garrison,[1132]\r\nof whom some were imprisoned and others put to ransom.[1133]\r\n\r\nRichard spent the next day in visiting two royal Forests [Sidenote:\r\n_March 29_] “which he had never seen before,” Clipstone and Sherwood;\r\n“and they pleased him well.” At night he returned to Nottingham,\r\nwhere he had summoned a council to meet on [Sidenote: _March 30_] the\r\nfollowing day. It was a great assembly, at which the queen-mother,\r\nthe two archbishops, and a number of prelates and magnates were\r\npresent.[1134] The king opened the proceedings by disseising two\r\nof John’s chief partizans, Gerard de Camville and Hugh Bardolf, of\r\nthe sheriffdoms and royal castles which they held—Lincoln shire and\r\ncastle, held by Gerard; Yorkshire and Westmorland by Hugh—all of\r\nwhich he put up for sale and sold to the highest bidder.[1135] On the\r\nsecond day of the council (March 31) he “asked for judgement upon\r\nCount John and upon Hugh of Nonant,” the bishop of Coventry, John’s\r\nchief ally. “And it was judged that they should be peremptorily\r\ncited, and that if they failed to come and stand to right, Count John\r\nshould be declared to have forfeited all claim to the crown and the\r\nbishop be subjected to the judgement of his fellow-prelates as bishop\r\nand that of the lay barons as sheriff.” On the third day (April 1),\r\nthe king ordered that for every carucate of land throughout England a\r\ncontribution of two shillings should be made to him; and “that every\r\nman should render to him the third part of the military service due\r\nfrom his fee, to go with him” (the king) “into Normandy.” He also\r\ndemanded of the Cistercians all the year’s wool of their flocks: but\r\nfor this they compromised by a fine. The [Sidenote: _April 2_] fourth\r\nday was employed in hearing appeals from Archbishop Geoffrey of York\r\nand Gerard de Camville; in neither case did the council arrive at any\r\ndecision. Lastly, the king “appointed his crowning to take place at\r\nWinchester at the close of Easter” (April 17), and ordered that on\r\nthe day after that event all the prisoners taken in John’s castles\r\nshould be brought before him.[1136]\r\n\r\nKing William of Scotland was now on his way to a conference with\r\nhis English overlord. They met at Southwell on the Monday before\r\nEaster and travelled together on [Sidenote: _April 4_] the Tuesday to\r\nMalton; there William “asked for the [Sidenote: _April 5_] dignity\r\nand honours which his predecessors had had in England,” and also\r\nfor the restoration of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, and\r\nLancaster, which he claimed “by right of his ancestors.” Richard\r\nanswered that he would act according to the counsel of his barons.\r\nThe two kings spent the rest of Holy Week together in a progress\r\n[Sidenote: _April 10-12_] by Geddington to Northampton, where they\r\nkept Easter. On Easter Monday Richard laid William’s requests before\r\nthe council, and gave his reply. “He told the king of Scotland that\r\nhe ought on no account to have made his demand about Northumberland,\r\nespecially in those days, when nearly all the nobles of the French\r\nkingdom had become his (Richard’s) enemies; for if he were to\r\ngrant this, it would look as if he did it more from fear than from\r\nfavour.” About the other counties he seems to have said nothing;\r\nbut they were doubtless understood to be included in his refusal.\r\nWilliam apparently made no remonstrance and was pacified by a charter\r\nproviding minutely for the proper escort and entertainment of the\r\nScot kings when summoned to the English court.[1137] He accompanied\r\nor followed Richard to Winchester for the coronation on Low Sunday,\r\nwhen he carried one of the swords of state before his overlord in the\r\nprocession.[1138]\r\n\r\nThe precise significance of this so-called “coronation” is not easy\r\nto determine. Richard, we are told, “when he had called together the\r\nprelates of England, asked and received from them counsel that he\r\nshould renew his kingship[1139] and permit the crown to be placed on\r\nhis head by the archbishop of Canterbury at the Easter festival. He\r\nfollowed this counsel of the prelates; and as there was not time to\r\nprepare for so great a solemnity by Easter Day, it was deferred until\r\nthe octave. And because the manner of a crowning of this sort had\r\nfor many years passed away from the minds of men, the directions for\r\nit were sought and found in the church of Canterbury, where Stephen\r\nhad been thus crowned with his queen.”[1140] These directions clearly\r\napply not to a coronation in the usual sense of the word—a ceremony\r\nof which the pattern for all after-time in England had been set less\r\nthan five years before—but to the old English custom, obsolete since\r\n1157, of “wearing the crown” in public on certain high festivals. The\r\nking was arrayed in his full robes, the sceptre and verge were placed\r\nin his hands, and the crown set upon his head by the archbishop, not\r\nin the church, but in the royal chamber; thence he was conducted in\r\nprocession to the church, where he was enthroned with special prayers\r\nand suffrages; after which the Mass was celebrated and he made his\r\noffering and his Communion. When the service was ended the procession\r\nreturned to the royal apartments, and the king, after changing his\r\nheavy crown for a lighter one, sat down with his magnates to a\r\nbanquet, held on this occasion in the refectory of the cathedral\r\nmonastery.[1141] “Thus,” says Gervase of Canterbury, “by the counsel\r\nof the prelates was King Richard crowned on the octave [Sidenote:\r\n_April 17_] of Easter at Winchester, because being set free from\r\ncaptivity he had unexpectedly returned to his kingdom.”[1142] The\r\nrevival of the old custom which Henry II had abandoned thirty-seven\r\nyears before seems to be thus sufficiently explained as an expression\r\nof the joy and thankfulness of king, Church, and nation at a\r\ndeliverance of which they had almost despaired, and which promised\r\nthe beginning of a new era in his reign. There are, however,\r\nindications of something behind this. One phrase used by Gervase,\r\nand two other phrases used by other writers of the time, suggest\r\nthat during Richard’s captivity something had taken place, or was\r\nsupposed or suspected in England to have taken place, derogatory\r\nto his regal dignity and making it advisable for that dignity to\r\nbe publicly re-asserted or “renewed.”[1143] That something, if not\r\naltogether imaginary, could hardly be anything else than his alleged\r\nhomage to the Emperor; and if that homage were, or were understood\r\nto be, merely for the kingdom of Burgundy, it could scarcely be\r\nregarded as affecting his position or his dignity as king of England.\r\nThe evidence is, however, too scanty and too vague to warrant any\r\ndefinite conclusion on the point.\r\n\r\nLittle was now needed to complete such a re-settlement of affairs in\r\nEngland as would enable Richard safely to leave the government of\r\nthe kingdom in Archbishop Hubert’s hands and devote himself to the\r\nmore anxious task which [Sidenote: _April 19_] he knew awaited him\r\nacross the Channel. Two days after the coronation the old bishop of\r\nDurham resigned the sheriffdom of Northumberland, whereupon William\r\nof Scotland offered Richard fifteen thousand marks for the county\r\nand its appurtenances. Richard, after consulting his ministers,\r\nsaid that for this sum William might have the county, but without\r\nits castles; William refused this offer, and “went home grieved and\r\nhumbled,” after another vain attempt to make his overlord change his\r\nmind; Richard was immoveable on the point for the moment, though he\r\nheld out a hope that he might yield it “on his return from Normandy.”\r\nThe prisoners taken at Nottingham and Tickhill and in John’s other\r\ncastles were disposed of by putting the wealthier of them in prison\r\ntill they should ransom themselves, and letting the rest go free on\r\ntheir giving security that they would come up for judgement whenever\r\nsummoned.[1144] John himself was in France. On April 25 the king\r\nwent to Portsmouth, where a fleet of a hundred ships was assembled\r\nto carry him and his fighting men over sea; but their crossing was\r\ndelayed by bad weather for more than three weeks. Once, on May 2, the\r\nking in his impatience to be gone caused the whole fleet to be loaded\r\nup ready for departure, and himself, in defiance of the counsel of\r\nhis sailors, went on board a “long ship” and put to sea; “and though\r\nthe wind was against him he would not turn back, so while the other\r\nships remained in port, the king and those who accompanied him were\r\ntossed about by the waves, for there was a great storm.” Next day he\r\nwas compelled to land in the Isle of Wight and return to Portsmouth.\r\nOn May 12 he was at last able to get across with all his fleet to\r\nBarfleur.[1145]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRICHARD AND FRANCE\r\n\r\n1194-1199\r\n\r\n      The King must guard\r\n        That which he rules.\r\n\r\n      —Sad stories of the deaths of kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard’s journey through the Cotentin and the Bessin was a triumphal\r\nprogress. Everywhere the people crowded round him with presents\r\nand acclamations, processions, dances, and songs: “God has come\r\nto our aid with His might; the king of France will go away now!”\r\nthey said.[1146] Philip was just then besieging Verneuil, but as\r\nusual he withdrew at Richard’s approach.[1147] He had already lost\r\nhis most valuable ally in the duchy; Richard and John had met, and\r\nRichard had accepted John’s submission and sent him to recover\r\nEvreux from the French, a charge which John fulfilled promptly and\r\nsuccessfully.[1148] Richard himself, after dashing into Maine to\r\nbesiege and capture Beaumont-le-Roger (whose lord had apparently gone\r\nover to Philip), proceeded to secure his lines of communication along\r\nthe left bank of the Seine by fortifying Pont-de-l’Arche, Elbœuf,\r\nand La Roche d’Orival, and then turned upon Philip who was besieging\r\nVaudreuil. A conference between the kings had just been arranged when\r\nthe mines dug by the French under the keep suddenly resulted in its\r\nfall. Richard vowed vengeance, and Philip hastily withdrew.[1149]\r\nBefore leaving Verneuil Richard had received intelligence that\r\nMontmirail was being besieged by some “Angevins and others”;[1150]\r\nan English chronicler says “Angevins and Cenomannians,”[1151] and\r\nanother simply “Angevins.”[1152] Whether the lord of Montmirail,\r\nWilliam of Perche-Gouet, [Sidenote: _June_] was a partizan of\r\nPhilip and the besiegers were acting on their own initiative in\r\nRichard’s interest, does not appear; Richard now hastened to the\r\nplace, but before he reached it the besiegers had levelled it to\r\nthe ground.[1153] He pushed on into Touraine, where an excellent\r\nopportunity of recovering [Sidenote: _June 1-13_] Loches was offered\r\nto him by his wife’s brother, Sancho of Navarre, who had collected\r\na band of Navarrese and Brabantines and set out with them to act\r\nagainst Philip. Sancho himself was very soon called home by the death\r\nof his father; but his troops went on and laid siege to Loches.[1154]\r\nRichard stopped on his way thither to gather some money at Tours,\r\nor rather at Châteauneuf, by turning the canons of S. Martin’s out\r\nof their abode and seizing their goods,[1155] and also receiving\r\na “voluntary” gift of two thousand marks from the burghers.[1156]\r\nThen he went on to Beaulieu[1157] and joined the Navarrese force in\r\nassaulting Loches; on June 13 it surrendered.[1158]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a meeting between some of the counsellors of the two kings\r\nhad been arranged to take place at Pont-de-l’Arche; but the Frenchmen\r\nfailed to keep tryst, and instead, Philip “with a considerable force”\r\nappeared before Fontaines, four miles from Rouen. After four days’\r\nsiege he took the castle and destroyed it.[1159] On his way back\r\ninto France he captured a valuable English prisoner, the earl of\r\nLeicester.[1160] Three days later—on June 17—a conference of Norman\r\nand French prelates and magnates met, with the sanction of the two\r\nkings, near Vaudreuil, to arrange a truce. They failed because Philip\r\ninsisted that all his own adherents and all those of Richard should\r\nbe precluded from molesting one another during the truce between\r\ntheir sovereigns, and to this Richard would not consent, “because he\r\nwould not violate the laws and customs of Poitou and of his other\r\nlands where it was customary from of old that the magnates should\r\nfight out their own disputes among themselves.” Philip next made\r\na dash at Evreux and “nearly destroyed it.”[1161] Thence he moved\r\nsouthward through the county of Blois, and was encamped somewhere\r\nbetween Fréteval and Vendôme when Richard, hurrying up from Loches,\r\npitched his tents outside the little unfortified town of Vendôme and\r\nthere, “as confidently as if he were surrounded by a wall,” waited\r\nfor further tidings of his enemy. They came in the form of a message,\r\nbidding him expect on that very day a hostile visit from the French\r\nking; to which he answered that he was ready, and that if the visit\r\nwere not made as announced, Philip might look for one from him on\r\nthe morrow. The day passed; [Sidenote: _July 4_] early next morning\r\nRichard called up his men and set forth to seek the enemy, who\r\nhurriedly retired upon Fréteval. Richard dashed after him through the\r\nwoods, fell unexpectedly upon his rear, and captured the whole of his\r\nbaggage-train; many Frenchmen were slain, many made prisoners, and\r\nthe spoil included not only a large quantity of arms and treasures,\r\nbut also the whole bundle of the charters given to Philip by the\r\nNorman traitors who had transferred their allegiance to him.[1162]\r\nRichard himself sought a loftier prize; he pursued the French host in\r\nsearch of its king, resolved to have him alive or dead. A Flemish\r\nsoldier told him that Philip was far ahead in the van; in reality,\r\nthat cautious monarch had turned aside and taken shelter in a church.\r\nRichard, mounted as usual on a charger as fiery as himself, spurred\r\non across the frontier of Normandy and France till the animal could\r\ngo no further, and Mercadier, having somehow contrived to overtake\r\nhis master, managed also to furnish him with another horse on which\r\nhe rode back to Vendôme.[1163]\r\n\r\nRichard’s next task was to recover control of Aquitaine. He had\r\nin 1190 left that country to the joint care of its duchess and of\r\na tried serjeant-at-arms, Peter Bertin, whom he had early in that\r\nyear made seneschal of Poitou.[1164] In or about 1192, Eleanor\r\nbeing no longer in the duchy, Aimar of Angoulême attacked Poitou\r\n“with horse and foot,” but was defeated and taken prisoner by the\r\nPoitevins.[1165] About the same time nearly all the barons of Gascony\r\ntook advantage of the illness of the seneschal of that county to\r\nrise in rebellion under the leadership of Count Elias of [Sidenote:\r\nc. 1192] Périgord[1166] and the viscount of La Marche. The seneschal\r\ntried in vain to make terms with them; on recovering his health,\r\nhowever, he attacked Périgord, captured or destroyed nearly all\r\nthe fortresses of its count, and then dealt in like manner with La\r\nMarche, “which he thus brought once for all under the control of the\r\nking.” Sancho of Navarre then joined him with eight hundred knights,\r\nand their united forces harried the county of Toulouse up to the\r\nvery gates of its capital city, and spent a night almost under its\r\nwalls before they went their several ways home.[1167] After this\r\nAquitaine seems to have been comparatively quiet [Sidenote: 1194\r\n_March_] till March 1194, when the old arch-troubler of the land,\r\nGeoffrey of Rancogne, threw off his allegiance and with [Sidenote:\r\n_June_] Bernard of Brosse did liege homage to Philip.[1168] In June\r\nSancho, on his way to join Richard before Loches, led his men through\r\nthe lands of Rancogne and Angoulême and ravaged them “from one end\r\nto the other.”[1169] All this timely help from Navarre resulted in\r\nmaking Richard’s march into Aquitaine after the affair of Fréteval\r\na progress of unbroken triumph. On July 22 the king wrote to his\r\njusticiar in England that he had captured Taillebourg, Marcillac,\r\n“all the castles and all the land” of Geoffrey of Rancogne, the city\r\nand suburb of Angoulême—“which we took in one evening”—and all the\r\ncastles and lands of its count, with some three hundred knights and\r\nforty thousand men-at-arms.[1170] From Verneuil to “Charles’s Cross”\r\nhe was master once more.[1171]\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a truce with France were now again in progress. On\r\nJuly 23 some officers of the two royal households met, by mutual\r\nconsent of their sovereigns, between Verneuil and Tillières to\r\ntreat of this matter, and “came to terms.” The only extant account\r\nof these terms—a proclamation addressed by the French king’s\r\nconstable and chamberlain and the dean of S. Martin’s “to all whom\r\nit may concern”[1172]—shows them to have been extremely favourable\r\nto Philip; and from this fact, together with Richard’s subsequent\r\naction, we may probably infer that their acceptance by the English\r\nnegotiators was merely a blind to restrain Philip from aggression\r\nin Normandy while Richard was still occupied in the south. When he\r\nreturned to Normandy he, according to a contemporary English writer,\r\nrepudiated them indignantly, and took away the Great Seal from his\r\nchancellor, on whom he cast the responsibility for them.[1173] The\r\nking’s wrath and the chancellor’s disgrace were, however, alike only\r\nmomentary; William of Ely retained his office to the end of Richard’s\r\nreign; and a month after the conference at which the truce had been\r\narranged Richard himself was sojourning peaceably within the Royal\r\nDomain of France, issuing an ordinance to his subjects in England\r\nfrom Bresle near Beauvais.[1174]\r\n\r\nThe duration of the truce had been defined as “a year from All\r\nSaints’ Day next.”[1175] During this breathing-space Richard’s chief\r\nconcern was the collecting of money for a renewal of the war. England\r\nhad been so drained for his ransom that he, or his justiciar who\r\nacted for him, did not venture on demanding a “scutage of Normandy”\r\ntill the following year (1195).[1176] Nor did the king attempt to\r\ncarry out at this time—if indeed he had momentarily entertained\r\nit—the project ascribed to him by Roger of Howden, of annulling all\r\ngrants made under the existing Great Seal, of course for the purpose\r\nof compelling their holders to pay for a renewal of them.[1177]\r\nBut on his way northward from Aquitaine he had called together at\r\nLe Mans “all the magnates under his jurisdiction,” and made them a\r\nspeech in commendation of the “willing, unbroken, and well-proved\r\nfidelity shewn to him by the English in his time of adversity,”[1178]\r\nseemingly in contrast to the feeble support which he had received\r\nfrom his Angevin dominions; for we are told that he compelled all\r\nhis bailiffs in Anjou and Maine to pay him a fine for retaining\r\ntheir offices.[1179] The device which he actually employed at this\r\njuncture for obtaining more money from England, though it sowed the\r\nseeds of later mischief there, was not likely to provoke discontent\r\nnor to inflict any hardship on the people; on August 22 he issued\r\nan ordinance authorizing the holding of tournaments in England—from\r\nwhich they had hitherto been rigidly excluded—at certain specified\r\nplaces, on condition that every man who took part in them should make\r\na certain payment to the Crown for a licence, the sum payable being\r\nregulated by the rank of the payer.[1180] The Church’s prohibition of\r\ntournaments had been renewed in a specially severe form only a year\r\nbefore; but on the continent it still was, as it always had been,\r\nset at defiance. Richard, who had spent the greater part of his life\r\nin lands where the mimic warfare of the tourney was regarded almost\r\nas part of the necessary education of a gentleman, could not fairly\r\nbe expected to realize its evil side, and might well count upon its\r\nfinding among the nobles and knights of his island realm such favour\r\nas would make the sale of licences a profitable business for the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1195]\r\n\r\nEarly in the next year a certain hermit came to the king and said:\r\n“Be mindful of the ruin of Sodom, and put away thy unlawful doings;\r\nelse the vengeance of God will come upon thee.” Five years before,\r\nRichard had publicly confessed and done penance for his private sins,\r\nseemingly without being urged by anyone. Now he was in a different\r\nmood; he resented the admonition as coming from a person of no\r\nimportance, and could not make up his mind to obey it unless it were\r\nenforced by a sign from above. The sign [Sidenote: _April 4_] came\r\non Easter Tuesday when he was struck down by a violent illness. Then\r\nhe called the clergy around him, confessed and did penance for his\r\nsins, and at once set about the amendment of his private life by\r\nrecalling his wife, whom he had for a long time practically deserted.\r\n“Then,” says the chronicler, “God gave him health of body as well\r\nas of soul.” He began a practice of rising early to attend Mass\r\n“and not leaving the church till the Divine Office was completely\r\nended.”[1181] A famine had for three years past been gradually\r\nspreading over western Europe[1182] [Sidenote: _April_] and had now\r\nreached Normandy; Richard caused a number of poor persons to be\r\nfed daily at his court and in the cities, towns, and villages, and\r\nmultiplied these benefactions as the need increased. He also ordered\r\nthe making of a large number of chalices for presentation to churches\r\nwhich had sacrificed their holy vessels for his ransom.[1183]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1194 _Nov.-Dec._]\r\n\r\nDuring the past five months the truce had been very ill kept. In\r\nless than two months from its commencement the homagers of both\r\nkings were ravaging each other’s lands,[1184] and Philip proposed to\r\nRichard a new expedient for ending their strife: a judicial combat\r\nbetween picked champions, five on either side, to take place in\r\npublic, “so that the issue should make manifest to the people of both\r\nrealms what was the mind of the Eternal King as to the rights of the\r\ntwo earthly sovereigns.” This scheme “pleased the king of England\r\ngreatly, provided that each of the kings should be one of the five\r\ncombatants on his own side and that they should fight each other on\r\nequal terms, armed and equipped alike”[1185]—whereupon the project\r\nfell to the ground. According to one English chronicler of the time,\r\nthe next step taken by some of Richard’s enemies seems to have been\r\nan attempt to assassinate him. While he was staying at Chinon,\r\nearly in 1195, there came to his court certain “_Accini_”—that is,\r\n“Assassins,” followers of “the Old Man of the Mountain”—or persons\r\ncalling themselves such, to the number of fifteen. Some of them,\r\nseeking to approach the king’s person too closely, were arrested, and\r\nthen stated that the king of France had sent them to kill his rival.\r\nRichard delayed passing sentence on them till their companions, who\r\nappear to have meanwhile made their escape, should be captured; of\r\nthe part which they ascribed to Philip in the matter he took no\r\nnotice.[1186] There the story abruptly ends. Whether these men were\r\nreally “Assassins” in either sense of the word—whether, if so, they\r\nacted on orders from the “Old Man,” or from someone else, or on their\r\nown initiative, or what their motives or those of their instigator\r\nmay have been—there is nothing to show. Their alleged charge against\r\nPhilip, at any rate, can hardly deserve more consideration from\r\nhistory than it received from Richard.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June or early in July Richard received from the Emperor\r\na present of “a great golden crown, very precious, as a token of\r\ntheir mutual friendship.” The gift was accompanied by a letter or\r\nmessage, bidding him “by the fealty which he owed to Henry, and as\r\nhe cared for his hostages, to invade the French king’s land with\r\nan armed force,” and promising that Henry “would send him help\r\nsufficient to avenge the injuries done by Philip to both of them.”\r\nRichard knew the Emperor too well to be tempted into acting hastily\r\non this mandate. He was aware that Henry “desired above all things to\r\nbring the kingdom of France under subjection to the Roman Empire,”\r\nand he had no mind to become the cat’s paw in a plot which might\r\nresult in uniting the forces of Germany and France for his own ruin.\r\nHe therefore sent his trusty chancellor, Bishop William of Ely, to\r\ninquire of the Emperor “in what manner, how much, and where and when”\r\nHenry would help him against the French king. Philip, hearing that\r\nthe bishop was to pass through France, tried to intercept him, but\r\nfailed, and thereupon sent word [Sidenote: _July_] to Richard that\r\nthe truce was at an end.[1187]\r\n\r\nAt this moment Christendom suddenly found itself threatened by\r\nan urgent peril. The emperor of Morocco, “taking occasion by the\r\ndissension between the French and English kings,” invaded Spain,\r\nmarched into Castille, [Sidenote: _July 18_] defeated its king\r\nAlfonso in a great battle, and besieged him in Toledo. The danger to\r\nsouthern Gaul was near enough to alarm both Richard and Philip; and\r\nbefore the end of July they had another conference, at which Richard\r\nrestored Aloysia to her brother, and a treaty of peace was drawn\r\nup.[1188] The draft was, however, fated to be nothing more than a\r\ndraft. The meeting was held near Vaudreuil, which for the period of\r\nthe truce had been left in Philip’s hands. The two kings, each with a\r\nbody of armed followers, seem to have encamped on opposite banks of\r\nthe river which flows through the valley whence the place took its\r\nname. While discussion was in progress Philip, fearing an attack on\r\nthe fortress, caused its walls to be secretly undermined. Suddenly\r\na part of them fell down. Richard instantly denounced the truce as\r\nended on his side, and with his men dashed across the stream into\r\nthe French camp. Philip, anticipating this movement, had already\r\narrayed his followers and was leading them towards the nearest bridge\r\nover the Seine, when (according to one account) it broke down, and\r\nhe and they narrowly escaped drowning. Richard was this time wise\r\nenough not to [Sidenote: _End July_] attempt pursuit, and contented\r\nhimself with capturing some of Philip’s servants who had been left\r\nbehind in the hasty retreat, and setting to work immediately on the\r\nrestoration of the recovered fortress[1189] and on preparations for a\r\nrenewal of hostilities. He was, however, not inclined to begin these\r\nlast till he had received more definite information from Germany;\r\nso another treaty was drafted on September 23, between Issoudun and\r\nCharroux,[1190] to be ratified by the two kings on November 8 at\r\nVerneuil. Before that date William of Ely returned from Germany,\r\nbringing word that the Emperor disapproved of the proposed terms,\r\nand was willing to quit-claim to Richard seventeen thousand marks of\r\nhis ransom, to enable him to recover the territory which he had lost\r\nthrough his imprisonment.[1191] Nevertheless, [Sidenote: _Nov. 8_]\r\nRichard went to Verneuil at the appointed date. On his way he was met\r\nby the archbishop of Reims with a message purporting to come from\r\nPhilip, bidding him not to hurry, as the king of France was still\r\nengaged in consultation with his ministers. Richard withdrew to his\r\n[Sidenote: _Nov. 9_] own quarters and stayed there till the following\r\nafternoon; then, resolved to wait no longer, he went to Philip’s\r\nquarters and demanded an interview. He was admitted into Philip’s\r\npresence, but the bishop of Beauvais spoke for his sovereign: “Our\r\nlord the King of France accuses thee of broken faith and perjury,\r\nin as much as thou didst plight thy word and swear to come to a\r\nconference with him this morning at the third hour, and didst not\r\ncome; and therefore he defies thee.” Both kings hastened back into\r\ntheir own territories.[1192] Within two days Richard was laying\r\nsiege to Arques,[1193] and Philip burning Dieppe.[1194] Richard seems\r\nto have quitted his siege for the purpose of trying to intercept\r\nthe French king on the way back to Paris; but he only succeeded in\r\novertaking a few men of the French rearguard.[1195] He appears to\r\nhave spent the next few weeks in restoring Vaudreuil.[1196]\r\n\r\nWhile these things were happening in northern Gaul, Mercadier, at\r\nthe head of his Brabantines, made a dash for Issoudun, destroyed its\r\nsuburbs, captured the castle, and garrisoned it for Richard.[1197]\r\nThence the mercenaries spread themselves over Berry, and crowned\r\ntheir successes by capturing the count of Auvergne and thus gaining\r\npossession of his castles.[1198] Philip, however, proceeded against\r\nthem in person, recaptured the town of Issoudun, and fired the\r\ncastle. He thought Richard was too intent on restoring the defences\r\nof Normandy to pursue him; but no sooner did the tidings reach\r\nVaudreuil than Richard, “casting all other business aside,” achieved\r\nin one day what was reckoned a three days’ ride, and appeared before\r\nIssoudun so unexpectedly that he had no difficulty in entering the\r\ntown.[1199] Reinforcements came up rapidly, and the French, seeing\r\nthemselves outnumbered, urged their sovereign to make overtures for\r\npeace. Richard had arrayed his men for battle and placed himself, as\r\nusual, [Sidenote: _Dec. 5_] at their head. Philip rode forward to\r\nmeet him, and the two kings, on horseback and in armour, parleyed\r\nalone together while their followers stood around awaiting the\r\nresult. At last they were seen to dismount, bare their heads, and\r\nexchange the kiss of peace.[1200] According to Philip’s biographer,\r\nRichard there and then renewed his homage to Philip.[1201] At any\r\nrate, the colloquy ended in an appointment for another meeting,\r\nto take place at Louviers (or as Rigord expresses it, “between\r\nVaudreuil and Gaillon”) on the octave of Epiphany, to make a “final”\r\npeace.[1202]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1196 _Jan. 3-13_]\r\n\r\nThe meeting did take place, and a treaty was made, consisting of a\r\nquit-claim from Philip to Richard and his heirs [Sidenote: _Jan.\r\n13-15_] of all the rights of the French crown in Berry, Auvergne,\r\nand Gascony, and an undertaking to make restitution of certain\r\nportions of Norman territory then in Philip’s hands, in exchange for\r\na similar quit-claim from Richard to Philip and his heirs of Gisors\r\nand the whole Norman Vexin except the fief of Andely,[1203] which\r\nbelonged to the metropolitan see of Rouen. The little town of Andely\r\nwas insignificant and unfortified, but its command of the traffic\r\nup and down the Seine, from which its holder was entitled to take\r\ntoll, made it a valuable possession from a financial point of view,\r\nand its geographical position and surroundings offered strategical\r\nadvantages which had already caught the attention of one, if not\r\nboth, of the rival kings. Philip tried to get Andely included in\r\nthe territory ceded to him; “but this could on no account be done.”\r\nNor did he succeed in obtaining Archbishop Walter’s fealty for\r\nthe other lands in the Vexin belonging to the see of Rouen.[1204]\r\nWalter’s own narrative of the scenes which took place between himself\r\nand both the kings with reference to his suretyship for Richard’s\r\nfulfilment of the treaty[1205] seems to indicate that Richard was\r\nreally desirous for peace with France at the moment, but that neither\r\nhe nor Philip intended the peace to last any longer than it suited\r\ntheir own convenience. It was in fact merely an expedient for giving\r\nboth parties a breathing-space in which to gather fresh forces and\r\nmake fresh plans for war. Within three months Richard was [Sidenote:\r\n_April 15_] sending to England for reinforcements “because”—so he\r\nwrote to Hubert Walter—“we think we are nearer to war than to peace\r\nwith the king of France.”[1206]\r\n\r\nRichard was at that moment striving to subdue Britanny. Ever since\r\nthe death of Henry II the wardship of little Arthur and of his duchy\r\nhad been in dispute between Richard and Philip; but the boy’s mother,\r\nConstance, supported by the Breton people, had hitherto managed to\r\nkeep both her child and her country under her own control. In the\r\nspring of 1196 Richard summoned, or invited, her to a conference\r\nwith him in Normandy; at the frontier she was met, captured, and\r\nimprisoned by her husband, Earl Ranulf of Chester.[1207] The Bretons\r\nat once rallied round their child-duke, in his name threw off\r\nall allegiance to Richard, and began to make raids on the Norman\r\nborder.[1208] Richard set out to punish them[1209] in the ruthless\r\nfashion habitual to him when dealing with rebels, “sparing neither\r\ngrown man [Sidenote: _Good Friday April 19_] nor child, not even on\r\nthe day of our Lord’s Passion.”[1210] They fled before him, carrying\r\nArthur with them, to the remoter fastnesses of their country, and\r\nthence conveyed the boy to the court of France.[1211] Thereupon\r\nthe treaty of Louviers was flung to the winds. Richard infringed\r\nit in the Vexin by building a castle on an island in the Seine at\r\nPorte-Joie, between Louviers and Pont-de-l’Arche, and in Berry by\r\ncalling the lord of Vierzon to account to him on a matter which\r\n(according to Philip’s historiographer) belonged to the jurisdiction\r\nof the French Crown, and when the man refused to obey him, making a\r\nraid on Vierzon and levelling it to the ground.[1212] Philip again\r\nlaid siege to Aumale. Richard ordered all property held within his\r\ndominions by four abbots who had been Philip’s sureties for the\r\ntreaty to be seised into his own hands,[1213] bribed the French\r\ngarrison of Nonancourt to give up that fortress to him, and then\r\nwent to relieve Aumale. He was, however, repulsed in an attack on\r\nPhilip’s camp, and went off to lay siege to Gaillon, which was held\r\nfor Philip by a famous mercenary captain, Cadoc. A bolt from Cadoc’s\r\ncrossbow struck the king’s knee as he was reconnoitring the place.\r\nThe wound disabled him for a month; before he had recovered, Aumale\r\nhad surrendered after a seven weeks’ siege, and Philip had razed its\r\nwalls and regained Nonancourt.[1214]\r\n\r\nRichard arose from his sick-bed in a towering rage,[1215] and with\r\na grim determination which gave a new character to the war. The\r\nsuccesses achieved by the French while he lay helpless had borne in\r\nupon him the fact that if he was to retain what was still left to him\r\nof Normandy—nay, if the House of Anjou was to retain its continental\r\npower at all—some better plan of campaign and of diplomacy must\r\nbe devised than the alternation of border-fighting and treaties\r\nor truces, made only to be broken, in which his personal energies\r\nas well as his material and military resources had been frittered\r\naway during the last two years. He must by some means bar the way\r\nto Rouen, laid open to Philip by the cession of the Vexin. He must\r\nshield and supplement his military resources, consisting as they\r\ndid only of mercenary troops stiffened by a small band of loyal\r\nNormans, by securing at least the neutrality, if not the direct\r\nactive assistance, of France’s other feudataries and neighbours. From\r\nEngland there was no help to be got. No action seems to have been\r\ntaken by Archbishop Hubert on the king’s demand addressed to him in\r\nthe spring for troops from that country. In November the demand was\r\nrenewed in another form; Richard bade Hubert send him either three\r\nhundred knights to serve beyond sea at their own expense for a year,\r\nor money wherewith to pay three hundred mercenaries three English\r\nshillings a day for the same period. A great council was convened\r\nat Oxford on December 7; Hubert, instead of laying before it the\r\nalternatives offered by the king, simply proposed that all the barons\r\nand bishops should furnish three hundred knights for a year’s service\r\nover sea. This Bishop Hugh of Lincoln at once refused on behalf of\r\nhis own see; its tenants being bound to military service only in\r\ntheir own country. The bishop of Salisbury followed Hugh’s example.\r\nThe justiciar lost his temper and broke up the assembly; and all\r\nthat Richard gained was a heavy fine paid by Herbert of Salisbury\r\nin redemption of the property of his see, confiscated by the king’s\r\norder on Hubert’s report. The property of the see of Lincoln was\r\nconfiscated likewise, but in this case the order remained a dead\r\nletter owing to the profound reverence universally felt for the\r\nbishop.[1216]\r\n\r\nThe king himself was meanwhile already carrying into effect, with\r\nhis eyes fully open to the consequences, a project which brought him\r\ninto collision with the highest ecclesiastical authority in Normandy.\r\nOf all the approaches to the Norman capital the most important was\r\nthe broad valley through which the Seine winds its course from Paris\r\nacross the old battle-ground of the Vexin to the heart of the duchy,\r\nwhile on either side of this water-way roads from north and east\r\nand south converge to meet beneath the walls of Rouen. Philip was\r\nnow master of this valley and its surroundings up to a distance of\r\nabout twelve miles from the city. The key of the position, however,\r\nwas neither in his hands nor in Richard’s, but in those of the\r\narchbishop of Rouen; it was Andely. The town of Andely stood at\r\nthe meeting-point of several roads, on the north side of a stream\r\ncalled the Gambon, in a valley opening from the eastward upon the\r\nSeine through the chalk cliffs on its right bank, near the middle\r\nof a great curve to the northward in its course between Gaillon and\r\nLouviers. To the west of Andely the Gambon and another rivulet\r\nbecame merged in a lake or mere whence they issued again to fall into\r\nthe great river by two distinct openings separated by a tract of\r\nmarshland, at the south-east corner of which stood the toll-house.\r\nNearly opposite the mouth of each streamlet was an island in the\r\nSeine; the more northerly and larger one was known as the Isle of\r\nAndely. The valley was sheltered on its southern side by a thickly\r\nwooded plateau extending several miles to a point nearly opposite\r\nGaillon, and called the Forest of Andely. Opposite the toll-house,\r\nat the angle formed by the junction of the Gambon with the Seine,\r\nthis plateau terminated abruptly in a mass of limestone rock three\r\nhundred feet high, with its western face, nearly perpendicular,\r\nlooking down upon the Seine, its northern front, almost as steep,\r\ntowering above the Gambon, and only a narrow neck of rocky ground\r\nat its south-eastern corner connecting it with the plateau, from\r\nwhich its other sides were separated by deep ravines. The military\r\npossibilities of such a position were obvious, and would doubtless\r\nhave been utilized long before they attracted the rival kings if\r\nAndely had been a lay fief. For Philip it would have made an ideal\r\nbase for attack upon Rouen; Richard saw in it a matchless site for\r\nthe construction of an almost impassable barrier between Rouen and\r\nParis. Philip had tried in vain to win it by diplomacy. Richard took\r\nadvantage of a temporary absence of the archbishop from Normandy to\r\nseize the Isle of Andely and begin to build a fort upon it. Walter\r\nprotested strongly, but in vain; Richard’s sole answer was to take\r\npossession of the low ground enclosed between the three rivers and\r\nthe lake and begin to cover it with the foundations of a walled town\r\nwith trenches and barbicans on every side. The primate then told the\r\nking in person that unless he made restitution and paid compensation\r\nwithin three days, he must expect the ecclesiastical penalties due to\r\nsacrilege. The warning was ignored; so Walter fulfilled his threat\r\nby laying Normandy under Interdict and setting out for Rome.[1217]\r\nThither he was followed by envoys from Richard who were charged to\r\nappeal to the Pope and endeavour to compose the dispute. Meanwhile\r\nthe king pushed on his work without intermission. In a few months\r\nthere arose on the Isle of Andely a tall octagonal tower encircled\r\nby a ditch and rampart, on the western side of the island a bridge\r\ngiving access to the left bank of the Seine, and on the eastern side\r\nanother bridge linking the tower with the “New” or “Lesser” Andely\r\nwhose walls, standing four-square within the natural moat formed by\r\nthe surrounding waters, were likewise accessible from the mainland\r\nonly by two bridges, one at their northern corner and one on their\r\nsouth-eastern side. The southern corner of the new town directly\r\nfaced the great “Rock of Andely”; and for that rock Richard was\r\ndesigning a crown such as no other western architect had ever yet\r\ndreamed of. His first act on the site, however, was of evil omen. It\r\nseems that to protect his workmen at the New Andely against attack\r\nfrom the French troops he had brought over a host of wild [Sidenote:\r\n1196-7] Welshmen who harried the French border in a fashion scarcely\r\nequalled by the worst ravages of the Brabantines; at last a large\r\nbody of them were intercepted by the French at the opening of the\r\nVale of Andely, surrounded, and slaughtered, to the number, it is\r\nsaid, of three thousand four hundred. Richard was then at Andely, and\r\nhad there eighteen French prisoners in a dungeon. In his fury he had\r\nthree of them dragged to the top of the rock[1218] and flung down to\r\nbe dashed to pieces at its foot; the fifteen others he caused to be\r\nblinded, and sent under the guidance of a one-eyed man to Philip,\r\nwho, “lest he should be thought inferior to the English king in power\r\nor spirit, or to be afraid of him,” retaliated by causing three\r\nEnglish prisoners to be thrown down from a rock in like manner, and\r\nblinding and sending back to Richard fifteen others, the wife of one\r\nof them acting as guide.[1219]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =1196-7=]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Richard was, through his agents at Rome, bargaining with\r\nArchbishop Walter for an exchange of lands. At last he made an\r\noffer which was distinctly advantageous to the metropolitan see of\r\nRouen; it was [Sidenote: _May_] accepted, and the Interdict was\r\nraised.[1220] A year later the [Sidenote: 1198 _May_] king’s work at\r\nAndely was complete. Round the foot of the great rock the ravines\r\nwhich parted it from the surrounding lesser heights were dug out to\r\nsuch a depth that access to it was impossible except by one narrow\r\nneck of ground at its south-eastern end. A “fair castle”—as Richard\r\nhimself justly called it[1221]—whose general outline was determined\r\nby that of its site occupied the top of the rock. The outer ward\r\nwas a walled-in triangle with sides of unequal length, and with its\r\napex facing south-eastward towards the natural junction left between\r\nthe rock and the plateau; at this point and at each of the other\r\ntwo angles stood a round tower with walls ten feet thick; each of\r\nthe two longer sides of the curtain wall was strengthened with a\r\nsmaller tower; and the whole enclosure was surrounded by a ditch more\r\nthan forty feet deep, hewn out of the rock, with a perpendicular\r\ncounterscarp. Beyond this ditch on its north-western side lay the\r\ninner ward. On three sides of this second enclosure were walls eight\r\nfeet thick; one wall, flanked by towers like those of the outer ward,\r\nfaced the north-western wall of the latter across the ditch; on the\r\nother and longer sides the steep incline of the rock itself formed a\r\nnatural rampart and ditch below the walls which ran along its edge.\r\nThe line of the curtain on the side nearest to the river was broken\r\nby a tower, round externally, octagonal within, and terminated at its\r\nnorthern end by two rectangular bastions behind one of which stood\r\nanother round tower forming the base of the third ward or citadel.\r\nA rampart, roughly elliptical in outline, was made by [Sidenote:\r\n=1196-7=] excavating a ditch some fifteen to twenty feet wide, with\r\na perpendicular counterscarp. In one part of this ditch casemates\r\nwere cut in the rock. Two-thirds of the rampart were surmounted by\r\na series of seventeen semicircular bastions with about two feet of\r\ncurtain wall between every two; on the eastern side the line was\r\nbroken by a bridge leading from the rampart of the outer ward into\r\nthe inner enclosure, to which there was no other means of ingress\r\nabove ground; and directly opposite this bridge the bastions abutted\r\non a mighty keep-tower with walls twenty feet thick at the angles\r\nand nowhere less than twelve feet, and with a wide outlook from the\r\nwindows in its upper stages over the river valley and the woodlands\r\nof the Vexin. Between the keep and the round tower at the end of the\r\ncurtain wall were buildings for dwelling and storage; from these an\r\nunderground stair and passage beneath the rock gave access to some\r\noutworks near its foot, where from a small tower a wall was carried\r\ndown to the river-bank; and from a point close to the termination of\r\nthis wall the river itself was barred by a double stockade across\r\nits bed. “Behold, how fair is this year-old daughter of mine!” Thus\r\nRichard is said to have exclaimed as he saw the last touches put\r\nto the “Castle on the Rock.”[1222] Contemporary writers distinctly\r\nimply that the whole scheme of the fortifications at Les Andelys was\r\ndevised and planned by the king himself; it was certainly carried\r\nout under his constant personal supervision and direction. Some\r\nof the peculiar features of the citadel or keep may probably have\r\nbeen suggested to him by the fortresses which he had seen in Holy\r\nLand, where the nature of the country and the circumstances of the\r\nFrank settlers had led to the development of the science of military\r\narchitecture in forms hitherto unknown to western builders. However\r\nthis may be, the opportunity presented by the natural advantages of\r\nthe site was utilized to the uttermost in the construction of the\r\ngroup of buildings crowned by the “Saucy Castle,” Château-Gaillard,\r\nas Richard appropriately called it, which from the summit of the rock\r\nseemed to look down in defiance and [Sidenote: =1196-7=] derision\r\nupon the French king and his schemes for the conquest of Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe royal architect was further strengthening alike his military\r\nand his political position by alliances with his most important\r\nneighbours both to north and south. Count Baldwin of Flanders had for\r\nsix years been chafing under the loss of the southern half of his\r\ncounty, annexed by the French king on the plea that the late Count\r\nPhilip had given it to Elisabeth of Hainaut, Baldwin’s sister and\r\nthe king’s first wife. In June 1196 Baldwin and Count Reginald of\r\nBoulogne promised to support Philip Augustus “against all [Sidenote:\r\n1197 _May-Sept._] men”;[1223] but in the following summer Baldwin\r\nthrew off his allegiance and became Richard’s sworn ally.[1224]\r\nAbout the same time the guardians of Arthur of Britanny exchanged\r\npledges with Richard that neither they nor he would make peace with\r\nFrance without each other’s consent; and a like agreement was made\r\nbetween Richard and Count Theobald of Champagne,[1225] brother and\r\nsuccessor to the Crusader Count Henry, nephew by the half blood to\r\nboth the kings, and brother-in-law to Richard’s queen. The western\r\nand northern sides and a considerable part of the eastern side of the\r\nFrench Royal Domain were thus completely ringed in by the territories\r\nof Richard and his allies, except in two places. These exceptions\r\nwere the united counties of Blois and Chartres and the little county\r\nof Ponthieu. Louis of Blois still adhered to Philip; but as he stood\r\nin the same degree of relationship to the two kings as did his cousin\r\nTheobald of Champagne, there was always a possibility that he might\r\nsome day follow Theobald’s example. As for Ponthieu, Philip had given\r\nAloysia in marriage to its count, probably thinking he was driving a\r\nwedge between Normandy and Flanders; but the wedge was too small and\r\ntoo insignificant to be of any real use in keeping them apart. On the\r\nother hand, the count of Flanders was on his northern and eastern\r\nfrontiers in direct touch with Richard’s German allies; and one at\r\nleast of these, the count of Hainaut, was also in direct touch with\r\nChampagne. Richard was in fact gradually drawing round the Royal\r\nDomain of France a circle which was already more than half completed;\r\nand he was now politically in a position to bring almost the whole\r\nof his own military resources to bear upon some of its uncompleted\r\nsections in the west and south without fear of danger in his rear.\r\nThe voluntary adhesion of Britanny promised at least a temporary\r\nrespite from trouble in that quarter. In Aquitaine his determined\r\nefforts to enforce order and tranquillity were at last beginning to\r\nbear fruit. In 1195 he had granted the county of Poitou to his sister\r\nMatilda’s son, Otto of Saxony;[1226] but Otto does not seem to have\r\never actually taken possession of the county, and the government of\r\nPoitou and its dependencies, and also of Gascony, continued to be\r\ncarried on as before, by seneschals appointed by the king. If these\r\nofficers needed assistance to quell internal revolt, they could\r\nsafely depend for it on Navarre; and the one remaining vassal of the\r\nduchy with whom they might still have been unable to cope was won\r\nover to the interests of his suzerain by the offer of a brilliant and\r\nwealthy matrimonial alliance and a substantial increase of territory.\r\nThe count of Toulouse with whom Richard had fought of [Sidenote:\r\n1196] old died in 1196, and the widowed Queen Joan of Sicily was\r\ngiven in marriage by her brother to the new Count Raymond VI;[1227]\r\nRichard renounced the old claim of the Poitevin counts to the\r\npossession of Toulouse, restored the Quercy to its former owner, and\r\ngranted him the county of Agen as Joan’s dowry, with the stipulation\r\nthat it should always be held as a distinct fief of the duchy of\r\nAquitaine and should furnish the duke with five hundred men-at-arms\r\nfor a month when required for war in Gascony.[1228]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1197]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1197 hostilities re-commenced with a raid made by\r\nRichard on the coast of Ponthieu; he set fire to the castle of S.\r\nValery, harried the surrounding country, seized five ships which\r\nwere bringing food into the harbour, hanged their skippers, and\r\nappropriated their cargoes to feed his own men.[1229] A month later\r\nMercadier made a raid [Sidenote: _April 15_] on Beauvais and captured\r\nits Bishop.[1230] Early in the summer [Sidenote: _May 19_] there came\r\nan indication that the Vexin was not altogether contented under its\r\nnew ruler; Dangu, an important castle on the Epte, was voluntarily\r\nsurrendered to Richard by its lord, William Crispin. Philip at once\r\nled an army to retake it and succeeded in so doing, but only after\r\na siege which occupied him so long that meanwhile Richard had time\r\nto dash into Auvergne and capture ten of the French king’s castles\r\nthere,[1231] and Baldwin of Flanders to make himself master of\r\nDouay and some neighbouring towns and lay siege to Arras. Philip\r\nhurriedly razed Dangu and went to relieve Arras; at his approach\r\nBaldwin withdrew into northern Flanders; Philip pursued him hotly,\r\nbut presently found himself entangled in a network of streams which\r\ncut off him and his troops from either advance or retreat, provisions\r\nor reinforcements, for the bridges over all the rivers in front and\r\nrear and round about him were broken down by Baldwin’s orders. He was\r\nreduced to sue for mercy and entreat Baldwin “not to sully the honour\r\nof the French Crown,” declaring himself ready to make an amicable\r\nsettlement with Flanders and restore all its lost territory, “if the\r\nking of England were excluded from the peace.” This condition Baldwin\r\nrejected, and Philip was obliged to purchase release from his awkward\r\nposition by a compromise: Baldwin undertook to act as intermediary\r\nbetween the two kings and invite Richard to a conference between them\r\n“for the settlement of an honourable peace” which should include\r\nhis own confirmation by both in the restitution of his ancestral\r\npossessions.[1232] The conference [Sidenote: _Sept. 8 or 17_] took\r\nplace early in September. As usual, the proposed peace dwindled to\r\na truce. Even this was won only by the influence of Archbishop\r\nHubert of Canterbury, who was then in attendance on his sovereign.\r\nIts duration was fixed for a year from the ensuing Christmas or\r\nHilary-tide;[1233] [Sidenote: _Sept._] and its sole condition seems\r\nto have been that each party should for that period continue holding\r\nwhat he held at the moment[1234]—a condition which enabled Philip to\r\npostpone indefinitely the promised restitution of southern Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe conference had been held “between Gaillon and Andely,”[1235] or\r\nas another writer puts it, “at the Isle,”[1236] most likely the Isle\r\nof the Three Kings, whose name suggests that it had been the scene\r\nof meetings between Philip and the two Henrys, and which lies in the\r\nSeine almost under the shadow of the Rock of Andely. Probably this\r\nwas the occasion on which Philip first saw the castle, then fast\r\nrising on that rock, and the completed square of walls enclosing the\r\nLesser Andely, with the bridges and fortified outpost on the smaller\r\nisland, barring the river. His courtiers—so runs [Sidenote: 1197?]\r\nthe story told by Gerald of Wales—could not refrain from expressing\r\ntheir admiration of this wonderful piece of military architecture.\r\nIrritated by their praise of his rival’s work, he swore aloud that\r\nhe wished the new fortifications were built wholly of iron, for if\r\nthey were, he would none the less bring all Normandy, and Aquitaine\r\nas well, under his rule. The boast was reported to Richard: “By God’s\r\nthroat!” swore the Lion-heart, “if yon castle were built of neither\r\niron nor stone, but wholly of butter, I would without hesitation\r\nundertake to hold it securely against him and all [Sidenote: _Oct.\r\n16_] his forces.”[1237] A month after the conference the exchange of\r\nlands between duke and primate was formally completed at the Castle\r\non the Rock, by a charter in which Richard set forth his motive for\r\nthe transaction: “The town of Andely and certain adjacent places\r\nwhich belonged to the see of Rouen being insufficiently fortified,\r\nthe way through the same into our land of Normandy was open to our\r\nenemies.”[1238] That way was now so effectually barred that six years\r\nwere to elapse before the enemy, notwithstanding his boast, made\r\nany attempt to cross or break the barrier; and when it fell at last\r\nafter a six months’ siege, its fall was due less to the skill of its\r\nassailant than to the apathy of Richard’s successor in its defence.\r\n\r\nThe truce was scarcely made when politics of a wider range began\r\nto claim the attention of both the rival kings. The Emperor Henry\r\nVI was still under sentence of excommunication for his treatment\r\nof the captive king of England and for other violations of\r\ninternational right and justice committed in his pursuit of a dream\r\nof world-conquest in which he seems to have curiously anticipated a\r\nmuch later bearer of the Imperial title. The aged Pope Celestine had\r\nwarned him in 1195—“What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole\r\nworld and lose his own soul?”[1239] and the warning came back to him\r\nwhen on his way to Holy Land in autumn 1197 he fell sick unto death\r\nat Messina. He hurriedly restored to the Roman See the property of\r\nwhich he had robbed it, and despatched an envoy to Richard, offering\r\nto refund his ransom in the form of either money or lands. Before\r\nan answer could be received he died, on Michaelmas eve. The Pope\r\nordered that he should not be buried, unless with Richard’s expressed\r\nconsent, until this offer was fulfilled. While Richard was keeping\r\nChristmas at Rouen, envoys from the archbishops of Cologne and Mentz\r\nand other German princes came to tell him that all the magnates\r\nof Germany were to assemble at Cologne on February 22 to elect an\r\nEmperor; “and they bade him, in virtue of the oath and fidelity by\r\nwhich he was bound to the Emperor and to the Roman Empire, come\r\nto Cologne at the aforesaid time without fail, in order that he,\r\nas a chief member of the Empire, might be with them to elect, by\r\nGod’s help, an Emperor fit for the imperial office.” After some\r\nconsideration and consultation Richard sent back with the envoys some\r\nbishops and nobles to be present at the election in his stead. “He,”\r\nsays Roger of Howden, “greatly feared to go there himself, lest he\r\nshould again fall into their hands, unless security were given him\r\nof a safe-conduct for the journey there and back; and no wonder, for\r\nhe had not yet paid to the German magnates all that he had promised\r\nthem for helping to his liberation; and it was on account of him that\r\nthe Emperor’s body was still unburied.”[1240] The German electors\r\nwere much divided among themselves. The late Emperor’s only son was\r\nalready, by the Pope’s consent, crowned king of Sicily;[1241] but he\r\nwas a child; nobody wanted an infant Emperor. Some of the magnates\r\nseem to have thought that jealousy and rivalry among themselves might\r\nbe best appeased by setting, or at least proposing to set, over all\r\nof them a sovereign of another nationality; certain of them nominated\r\nKing Richard of England. It was probably merely in opposition to\r\nthis party that some others—“but they were few”—proposed Philip\r\nof France.[1242] The majority inclined to Duke Henry of Saxony,\r\nRichard’s sister’s son, who by birth was head of the most illustrious\r\nof the princely houses of Germany, and had in 1196 succeeded his\r\nfather-in-law as Count Palatine. For Henry Richard, [Sidenote:\r\n1197-8] through his representatives at Cologne, threw all his\r\ninfluence into the scale. But Henry himself was absent in Holy Land,\r\nand it was felt that to leave the Empire without a head till his\r\nreturn might involve grave danger; his partizans, including Richard,\r\ntherefore transferred their support to his brother Otto, whose life\r\nhad been spent almost entirely in Normandy and England, at the court\r\nfirst of his grandfather Henry II and afterwards at that of his\r\nuncle Richard, and who was perhaps the more acceptable to the German\r\nelectors because he neither held nor could claim any territorial\r\npossessions in Germany;[1243] his sole personal connexion with it was\r\nhis marriage with a daughter of the duke of Louvain, one of the North\r\nGerman [Sidenote: =1197-8=] feudataries with whom Richard had made\r\nalliance in 1194. Otto was accordingly elected, and on July 12, 1198,\r\nhe was crowned at Aix.[1244]\r\n\r\nOne of the warmest advocates of the election of Otto was Count\r\nBaldwin of Flanders, chiefly because the king of England was known\r\nto be on the same side.[1245] The king of France, on the other hand,\r\nnaturally took alarm at a choice which promised to strengthen the\r\nalliance between Richard and Baldwin and give to both these princes\r\nthe countenance, if not the active support, of the greater part\r\nof the German feudataries and of their sovereign. There was one\r\ndisappointed candidate for the imperial crown who openly refused to\r\nacknowledge the authority of his successful rival. This was Philip,\r\nduke of Suabia, the late Emperor’s brother. Between him and his royal\r\nFrench namesake an alliance was concluded on S. Peter’s day.[1246]\r\nIt could, however, be of little avail to either of them against the\r\ncoalition by which in a few weeks they were confronted. Henry of\r\nSaxony, returned from Holy Land, was welcomed by his English uncle\r\nat Les Andelys,[1247] and thence proceeding to his homeland gave his\r\nunqualified assent and approval to the election of his brother as\r\nEmperor.[1248] Before the end of August, the duke of Louvain, the\r\ncounts of Brienne, Flanders, Guines, Boulogne, Perche, Blois, and\r\nToulouse, with Arthur of Britanny (or rather the nobles who governed\r\nthe duchy in his name) “and many others,” made a confederacy with\r\nRichard, swearing to him and he to them that neither they nor he\r\nwould make peace with the king of France without the common consent\r\nof them all.[1249] On September 6 Baldwin of Flanders laid siege\r\nto St. Omer; its surrender, three weeks later, was followed by\r\nthat of [Sidenote: _Sept. 27_] Aire and several other neighbouring\r\ntowns.[1250] At the same time the truce was broken on the Norman\r\nborder. One contemporary English writer represents Philip as the\r\naggressor; but his story seems to be only a confused enlargement\r\n[Sidenote: =1197-8=] on the contents of a letter written by Richard\r\nin which there is no suggestion of any such thing. Richard, according\r\nto his own account, on Sunday, September 27, crossed the Epte by the\r\nford near Dangu, surprised and captured two neighbouring castles with\r\ntheir garrisons and contents, and [Sidenote: _Sept. 28_] returned\r\nat night by the same way. Next day he learned that Philip, having\r\nheard of this inroad, was setting out from Mantes with some five or\r\nsix hundred men. Richard at once went forth with a few attendants,\r\nbut left the main body of his troops on the river-bank, thinking the\r\nFrench would cross the ford and encounter them on the other side.\r\nPhilip, however, turned towards Gisors. Before he could reach it\r\nhe was almost surrounded by the troops of Richard and Mercadier.\r\nThey chased him so hotly and pressed him so closely that the bridge\r\nat Gisors broke down under the weight of horses and men crowding\r\nupon it. The French king himself was reported to have “swallowed\r\nsome water,” as his rival jestingly expressed it; he escaped,\r\nhowever, unharmed, but twenty of his knights were drowned; three\r\nwere prostrated by Richard’s own lance, a hundred captured by his\r\nmen, and a hundred others fell into the hands of Mercadier and his\r\nBrabantines; there were countless prisoners of lower rank, and the\r\ncaptured destriers numbered two hundred, “of which one hundred were\r\ncovered with iron.”[1251]\r\n\r\nThis affair was one of Richard’s most daring personal adventures;\r\nhe himself acknowledged that he had “staked his own head and his\r\nkingdom to boot, overriding the advice of all his counsellors”—“but,”\r\nhe added, “it was not we who thus defeated the king of France, but\r\nGod and our right did so by our means.”[1252] These words and the\r\naction on which they are a comment are alike characteristic of the\r\nLion-heart. Amid all the overwhelming political, diplomatic, and\r\nfinancial cares of his latter years, he was still knight-errant\r\nenough to glory in a wholly [Sidenote: =1197-8=] unnecessary\r\nadventure which might have cost him his life, and which had, after\r\nall, failed of its practical object, the capture of Philip. It may,\r\nhowever, have been partly prompted by another motive than the spirit\r\nof mere knightly daring. Richard was literally at his wits’ end\r\nfor money; and without money the league which he had been forming\r\nagainst Philip was certain to break up ere long. His alliances with\r\nFlanders and the other feudataries of the Empire and with some of the\r\nFrench king’s own subjects rested on a basis of subsidies, revenues,\r\nor substantial rewards of some kind, promised to the nobles in\r\nconsideration of their pledge to assist him against Philip. To none\r\nof them had he as yet been able to fulfil his plighted word in this\r\nrespect. Château-Gaillard was well worth the cost of its building,\r\nbut the cost was great. “You know there is not a penny at Chinon”\r\n(where the Angevin treasure was kept), he wrote in a _sirventes_\r\naddressed to the brother-counts of Auvergne some time in the years\r\n1197-9.[1253] His means were, in fact, insufficient for the payment\r\nof even the troops absolutely necessary to guard the Norman frontier.\r\nWhen he found himself so close to Philip on the road to Gisors there\r\nmay have flashed across his excited brain the dream of a capture\r\nwhich should not only place his rival in his power, but lead to the\r\nfilling of his coffers as those of the Emperor had so recently been\r\nfilled, with the ransom of a king. He had already been reduced to\r\nthe expedient of a change of his royal seal, the repudiation of all\r\ngrants made under the old one, and the exaction of heavy payments for\r\ntheir confirmation or renewal.[1254] On his new seal the three lions\r\npassant-gardant appeared for the first time as the armorial bearings\r\nof the king of England. Its earliest impression now known is attached\r\nto a charter dated May 22, 1198[1255]; and the process of cancelling\r\nold grants [Sidenote: =1197-8=] and selling new ones went on till\r\nthe very eve of his death eleven months later.[1256]\r\n\r\nNeither Richard nor Philip, in fact, was in a position to make war\r\non a scale large enough to bring it to a decisive issue. The raids\r\nand counter-raids therefore continued. [Sidenote: _Sept._] Philip\r\nburned Evreux, ravaged the country as far as Beaumont-le-Roger, and\r\nwould have burned Neufbourg, had not John anticipated him by firing\r\nit at the moment of the French attack. Mercadier raided Abbeville at\r\nfair-time, and returned with a mass of plunder taken from the French\r\nmerchants there. The earl of Leicester made an attempt on Pacy.[1257]\r\nRichard built a new fort on an island in the Seine and gave it the\r\nprovocative name of Boutavant, “Push-forward”; Philip began to build\r\none facing it, which in a like spirit of bravado he called Gouletot,\r\n“Swallow-all.”[1258] An obscure entry in the Norman Exchequer Roll\r\nfor the year seems to imply that the kings reverted for a moment to\r\na scheme which four years before had been proposed and rejected,\r\nfor the settlement of their quarrel by a fight between selected\r\nchampions, to be held in presence of both at Les Andelys[1259]; but\r\nagain the proposal led to nothing. At length Archbishop Hubert, being\r\nin Normandy, went at Philip’s desire and with Richard’s consent to\r\nthe French court to discuss terms of peace. Philip offered to restore\r\nall the territory and castles which he had seized except Gisors,\r\nconcerning the rightful ownership of which he declared himself\r\nwilling to accept the decision of six Norman barons to be chosen by\r\nhimself and six French barons to be chosen by Richard. The English\r\nking, however, would make no peace save on condition of its including\r\nthe count of Flanders and all the other feudataries of France who had\r\ntransferred their homage to himself; so the negotiations resulted\r\nonly in another truce till S. Hilary’s day.[1260] At the appointed\r\ntime the kings [Sidenote: _Jan. 13_] came to a meeting between Vernon\r\nand Les Andelys; Richard on the Seine in a boat, from which he\r\nrefused to land, Philip on horseback on the river-bank. The colloquy\r\nwas adjourned, seemingly to give opportunity for the intervention\r\nof a mediator, Peter of Capua, a cardinal [Sidenote: _Jan._] whom\r\nthe new Pope Innocent III had recently sent to France as legate. By\r\nthe advice of Peter and of some magnates on both sides, the truce\r\nwas prolonged for a term of five years; it was confirmed by oath,\r\nand both kings dismissed their troops, bidding them return to their\r\nhomes.[1261]\r\n\r\nThe biographer of Philip Augustus says that “through the trickery of\r\nthe king of England” the agreement was not confirmed by an exchange\r\nof hostages.[1262] It may have been on this plea that four French\r\ncounts through whose territories Mercadier and his men had to pass\r\non their way southward ventured to ignore the truce and set upon the\r\nRoutiers, many of whom they slew. Philip swore that this outrage had\r\nno sanction from him. Presently afterwards, however, when Richard,\r\nthinking Normandy was safe for a while, was on his way to visit\r\nhis southern dominions, Philip not only resumed the fortification\r\nof Gouletot, but also destroyed the neighbouring forest. At these\r\ntidings Richard hurried back to Normandy, and sent his chancellor to\r\nthe French court to declare the truce dissolved unless Philip would\r\npull down the new fortress. Philip, urged by the legate, promised to\r\ndo so. Then Richard declared he would have either a full settlement\r\nof all their disputes or no peace at all. A form of peace was drawn\r\nup; its provisions were that the king of France should restore to\r\nthe king of England all the lands which he had taken from him either\r\nin war or by any other means, except Gisors, in compensation for\r\nwhich he granted to Richard the gift of the archbishopric of Tours;\r\nPhilip’s son Louis was to marry Richard’s niece, the daughter of the\r\nking of Castille; and furthermore, Philip was to swear that he would\r\nto the utmost of his power assist Richard’s nephew Otto to obtain the\r\nimperial crown. Richard on his part was to give to Louis of France,\r\nwith the hand of his niece, twenty thousand marks of silver and the\r\ncastle of Gisors as her dowry. The execution of the treaty, however,\r\nwas postponed till Richard should return from Poitou.[1263]\r\n\r\nThe word “Poitou” had in recent years acquired another meaning\r\nbesides its original one. Richard had never styled himself count of\r\nPoitou since his accession to the Crown[1264]; it is doubtful whether\r\nhe had ever done so since its restoration to his mother in 1185. The\r\ntitle by which he asserted his rights over his southern dominions was\r\nthat of “Duke of the Aquitanians.” His grant of the county of Poitou\r\nto Otto in 1195 seems to have been merely verbal, ratified by neither\r\ncharter nor investiture, and carrying with it no permanent authority\r\nand no legal claim to the higher dignity of the Aquitanian dukedom;\r\nand on Otto’s return to Germany in June 1198 Richard resumed full\r\npossession of the county.[1265] The word “Aquitaine” was dropping out\r\nof use. The administration of all the king-duke’s dominions south of\r\nthe Loire was carried on by seneschals appointed by and acting for\r\nhim, one for “Gascony” and one for “Poitou”; the former appellation\r\nrepresenting the country south of the Garonne, the latter embracing\r\nthe county of Poitou proper and all its dependencies or underfiefs\r\nbetween the Garonne and the Loire.[1266] Richard’s last visit to\r\nany part of these dominions had been a flying one in December 1195,\r\nwhen he kept Christmas at Poitiers.[1267] A double motive seems now\r\nto have urged him southward. The troublesome half-brothers Aimar of\r\nAngoulême and Aimar of Limoges were, it appears, again plotting or at\r\nleast credibly suspected of plotting treason against him.[1268] He\r\nhad also been informed of a wonderful treasure-trove on the land of a\r\nbaron in the Limousin. A peasant ploughing near Châlus had met with\r\nan obstacle which, when disinterred, proved to consist of something\r\nwhich is described [Sidenote: _March_] as “an Emperor with his wife,\r\nsons, and daughters, all of pure gold, and seated round a golden\r\ntable,” and also, it appears, some ancient coins.[1269] The lord of\r\nChâlus was one Achard[1270]; from him the treasure was claimed by the\r\nviscount Aimar as overlord. Richard, as Aimar’s overlord, claimed it\r\nin his turn,[1271] and by the law of treasure-trove his claim seems\r\nto have been justified. According to one account, Aimar actually\r\nsent him no small portion of what had been found; but Richard would\r\nbe content with nothing short of the whole.[1272] He seems to have\r\nsuspected that the remainder was still hidden at Châlus, for it was\r\nto Châlus that he laid siege, on Wednesday, March 4.[1273] Achard\r\nhimself had fled to the viscount of Limoges for protection.[1274] In\r\nvain he begged for a truce till after Easter, and offered to submit\r\nto a sentence of the royal court of France.[1275]\r\n\r\nThe castle of Châlus, whose ruined keep-tower still stands on a\r\nlow hill above the little river Tardoire, contained at the moment\r\nabout forty persons; only two of these were knights, and some of the\r\nothers were women.[1276] For three [Sidenote: _March 24-6_] days\r\nRichard’s miners dug under the walls while he with his crossbowmen\r\nrode round about them, discharging a [Sidenote: _Friday March 26_]\r\nshower of missiles into the enclosure.[1277] On the third day the\r\nlittle garrison offered to surrender on condition of safety for\r\nlife and limb and the retention of their arms; but Richard refused,\r\nswearing he would capture and hang them all.[1278] That afternoon he\r\nagain rode forth, accompanied by Mercadier, round about the castle,\r\nshooting with his crossbow at any man whom he saw on the wall; and\r\nthis time he rashly went without any defensive armour except an\r\niron headpiece and a buckler. His daring was more than equalled by\r\none man among the besieged, who with a crossbow in one hand and\r\na frying-pan in the other had stood nearly all day on a bastion\r\nof the tower, dexterously turning aside with his makeshift shield\r\nevery missile aimed at him, and carefully scanning the ranks of the\r\nbesiegers,[1279] evidently in the hope of discovering their leader.\r\nFrom one account it appears that when at last his opportunity came,\r\nhe had discharged all his quarrels, and the bolt which he shot at the\r\nunprotected figure was one of the enemy’s own which he snatched from\r\na crevice in the wall where it had stuck just within his reach.[1280]\r\nRichard, hearing the sound of the missile in the air, looked up and\r\ngreeted the bowman with a shout of applause. That look cost him his\r\nlife. He bent down to shelter himself under his shield, but too late\r\nto avoid the arrow; it struck his left shoulder at the joint of the\r\nneck, glanced downward, and became fixed in his side.[1281] No one\r\nbut Mercadier was near enough to see exactly what had occurred. To\r\nhim Richard gave orders for a general assault to be made on the\r\ncastle[1282]; then, quietly and alone, he rode back to his tent.\r\nThere he tried to pull out the arrow; the shaft broke, leaving the\r\nbarb imbedded in the wound, and he was compelled to send for a\r\nsurgeon to extract it. One was found, says an English chronicler,\r\n“among that accursed tribe, the followers of the impious Mercadier,”\r\nand it is to this man’s handling of the case that the same writer\r\nascribes its fatal termination; but this is sufficiently accounted\r\nfor by his own description of the drawbacks attending the operation,\r\nperformed hurriedly by lantern-light on a patient so fat that the\r\nsteel, buried in his flesh, was extremely difficult to find, and when\r\nfound, still more difficult to remove[1283]; a patient, moreover,\r\nwhose character combined with his physical constitution to make him\r\nan extremely unmanageable invalid. A second doctor seems to have been\r\nafterwards called in;[1284] but in spite of all the remedies that\r\nwere applied the wound grew daily more painful and its swelling and\r\ndiscoloration more ominous.[1285]\r\n\r\nA furious assault made by Mercadier on Châlus after the king was\r\nwounded had resulted in the capture of the castle and its defenders.\r\nRichard caused them all to be hanged, except the man who had shot\r\nhim.[1286] He then despatched some of his troops to besiege two\r\nneighbouring castles, Nontron and Montagut, “for he purposed in\r\nhis heart to destroy all the castles and towns of the viscount of\r\nLimoges.”[1287] Soon, however, he began to realize that his days\r\nwere numbered. He wrote to his mother, who was at Fontevraud, asking\r\nher to come to him. Every precaution had been taken to prevent his\r\ncondition becoming known outside the little group of four trusted\r\nnobles who alone were admitted to his presence;[1288] from these he\r\nnow exacted an oath of fealty to John as his destined successor, to\r\nwhom he devised the kingdom of England and all his other lands. He\r\nordered that all his castles and three parts of his treasure should\r\nlikewise be delivered to John; he bequeathed all his jewels to his\r\nnephew Otto of Germany, and the remaining fourth part of his treasure\r\nto be distributed among his servants and the poor.[1289] He sent\r\nfor the captive crossbowman and questioned him: “What evil have I\r\ndone to thee? Why hast thou slain me?” “Thou didst slay my father\r\nand my two brothers with thine own hand; thou wouldst have slain me\r\nlikewise. Take on me what vengeance thou wilt; freely will I suffer\r\nthe greatest torments thou canst think of, now that thou, who hast\r\nbrought so many and so great evils on the world, art stricken to\r\ndeath.” Richard answered, “I forgive thee my death,” and ordered that\r\nthe man should be liberated and sent away safely with a gift of a\r\nhundred English shillings.[1290] Then he called for a chaplain, made\r\nhis confession and received the Holy Communion.[1291] By this time\r\nprobably his mother was with him; she herself records that she was\r\npresent at his death, and that he “placed all his trust, after God,\r\nin her, that she would make provision for his soul’s welfare with\r\nmotherly care to the utmost of her power.”[1292] He made his own\r\narrangements for the disposal of his body, ordering that his brain\r\nand some internal organs should be buried in the ancient Poitevin\r\nabbey of Charroux, his heart at Rouen, and the embalmed corpse at his\r\nfather’s feet in the abbey church of Fontevraud.[1293] He [Sidenote:\r\n_April 6_] received Extreme Unction on April 6, the Tuesday in\r\nPassion week, “and as the day was closing, he also ended his earthly\r\n[Sidenote: _April 11_] day.”[1294] On Palm Sunday his body, wrapped\r\nin the robe in which he had been attired at his crown-wearing at\r\nWinchester five years before,[1295] was buried by his father’s old\r\nfriend Bishop Hugh of Lincoln and his mother’s friend Abbot Luke\r\nof Torpenay in the place which he had chosen for it.[1296] His\r\nheart—said to be remarkable for its great size[1297]—was enclosed in\r\na casket of gold and silver and placed, as a most precious treasure,\r\namong the holy relics in the cathedral church of Rouen.[1298]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I\r\n\r\n_Richard and Leopold of Austria at Acre_\r\n\r\nThe German account of the quarrel between Richard and the duke of\r\nAustria after the taking of Acre is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Capta igitur civitate, rex Anglorum signa triumphalia sui exercitus\r\nturribus affigi praecepit, titulum victoriae ex toto sibimetipsi\r\nsatis arroganter adscribens. Hacque de causa cum per civitatem\r\ntransiret, vexillum ducis Leopoldi turri quam ipse cum suis\r\nobtinuerat affixum vidit, suumque non esse recognoscens, cujusdam sit\r\npercontatur. Qui Leopoldi ducis Orientalium esse accepto responso,\r\neumque ex parte civitatem obtinuisse comperiens, maxima indignatione\r\npermotus vexillum turre dejici lutoque conculcari praecepit; insuper\r\nducem verbis contumeliosis affectum sine causa injuriavit.” Otto of\r\nS. Blaise, Pertz, xx. 323.\r\n\r\nThe English accounts are two:\r\n\r\n(1) “Dux Austriae, et ipse unus ex veteribus obsessoribus Accaronis,\r\nregem Anglorum secutus a pari in suae sortis possessionem, quia\r\npraelato coram se vexillo visus fuit sibi partem vindicare\r\ntriumphi; et si non de precepto, de voluntate tamen regis offensi,\r\ndejectum est vexillum ducis in coenum, et in ejus contumeliam a\r\nderisoribus conculcatum.” R. Devizes, 52. (2) “Cum enim civitatem\r\nAccon irrumperent Christiani, et diversi diversa civitatis hospitia\r\ncaperent, in nobilissimo civitatis palatio signum ducis [Ostrici]\r\nelevatus est. Quod intuens rex et invidens, manu militum valida\r\nvexillum dejecit, ducemque tam grato spoliavit hospitio.” Gerv.\r\nCant., i. 514.\r\n\r\nRigord (118) says: “Ducis Austriae vexillum circa Accon cuidam\r\nprincipi [rex Ricardus] abstulit et in cloacam profundam, in\r\nopprobrium ducis et dedecus, vilissime confractum dejecit.”\r\n\r\nOtto is the only German authority on the subject: for the brief\r\nmention of it in _Ann. Colon._ (Pertz, xvii. 802), which is\r\npractically in agreement with him, cannot be considered as such,\r\nand Magnus of Reichensperg’s version (_ib._ 519) is of no value,\r\nbecause it places the incident not at Acre, but at the rebuilding of\r\nAscalon, in January 1192, after Leopold had left Palestine (Kellner,\r\n_R. Löwenherz Deutsche Gefangenschaft_, 47-8). It is curious that\r\nthe writer who gives the fullest details about Leopold’s Crusade\r\nand about the later relations between Leopold and Richard gives\r\nno account of the affair at all, merely saying with reference to\r\nLeopold’s capture and imprisonment of the king “Una et efficiens\r\ncausa fuit quod eum in obsidione Aconae quasi abjectum reputavit”\r\n(Ansbert, in Appendix to Preface to R. Howden, iii. cxl). It is also\r\nnoticeable that Otto writes as if Richard had claimed possession of\r\nthe whole of Acre for himself alone; there is no mention of Philip.\r\nProbably the tower to which Leopold’s banner was affixed stood in\r\nRichard’s half of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II\r\n\r\n_The Capitulation of Acre_\r\n\r\nThe terms on which Karakoush and El-Meshtoub agreed to surrender\r\nAcre are given, in various forms, by nine contemporary or almost\r\ncontemporary authorities.\r\n\r\n(1) King Richard, in a letter to the Abbot of Clairvaux, R. Howden,\r\niii. 131.\r\n\r\n(2) Bohadin, _Rec. Hist. Orient._, iii. 237; Schultens’s edition, 179.\r\n\r\n(3) _Estoire de la Guerre Sainte_, ll. 5199-224, and _Itin. Reg.\r\nRic._, 231, 232; these two are here practically identical and may be\r\ncounted as one.\r\n\r\n(4) _Gesta Ric._, 178, 179.\r\n\r\n(5) R. Howden, iii. 120, 121.\r\n\r\n(6) R. Diceto, ii. 94.\r\n\r\n(7) R. Coggeshall, 32.\r\n\r\n(8) R. Devizes (ed. Stevenson), 51, 52.\r\n\r\n(9) Ibn Alathyr, _Rec. Hist. Orient._, II. 46.\r\n\r\nAll these writers mention, among the conditions promised by the\r\nMoslems, the restoration of the relic of the Cross; and all except\r\none—R. Devizes—mention also the release of a number of Christian\r\nprisoners: the king and R. Diceto say fifteen hundred; R. Coggeshall\r\nsays seven hundred, some of whom the kings were to select; Ambrose\r\nand the _Itinerarium_ say two thousand prisoners of distinction and\r\nfive hundred of lower rank; the _Gesta_ say fifteen hundred ordinary\r\nprisoners and two hundred knights, these latter to be specially\r\nselected by the kings; R. Howden follows this latter account, but\r\nreduces the first number to a thousand; Ibn Alathyr mentions only\r\nthe “selected” prisoners, whose number he gives as five hundred. The\r\nearlier of the two extant redactions of Bohadin (_Recueil_, iii.\r\n237) has “five hundred prisoners of ordinary condition, and one\r\nhundred others of rank, whom the Franks might ask for by name”; but\r\nin the later redaction (represented by Schultens’s edition) the\r\nfigures are fifteen hundred and one thousand. This later redaction,\r\nof which the only known MS. was written in the year after Bohadin’s\r\ndeath, is considered not to be his own work (_Recueil_, iii. 374);\r\nbut its variations from the earlier recension seem entitled to some\r\nconsideration, as they are so nearly contemporary and may have the\r\nforce of corrections; this may be the case in the passage under\r\nconsideration here.\r\n\r\nNeither King Richard, R. Diceto, nor R. Devizes, mentions a money\r\npayment. The _Estoire_, _Itinerarium_, _Gesta Ricardi_, R. Howden,\r\nBohadin, and Ibn Alathyr make the promised sum two hundred thousand\r\n“bezants” (_Est._), “talentorum Saracenicorum” (_Itin._), “dinars”\r\n(Bohadin and Ibn Alathyr). R. Coggeshall absurdly says seven hundred\r\nthousand bezants. The only authorities for the special payment\r\npromised to Conrad are the two Moslem ones, and as to its amount\r\nthe two recensions of Bohadin again differ; the earlier says four\r\nthousand gold pieces, the later fourteen thousand, viz. ten thousand\r\nto Conrad himself and four thousand to his knights. Ibn Alathyr also\r\nsays Conrad was to have fourteen thousand; and the later recension\r\nof Bohadin is followed by Abu Shama in his extract from that author\r\n(_Recueil_, v. 25, 26), as to both the number of prisoners and the\r\namount of money.\r\n\r\nThe _Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_ say that “the chief men among the\r\nTurks in Acre” were to be held as hostages by the Franks till the\r\nconditions of the treaty were fulfilled. Richard and Bohadin say, and\r\nthe _Gesta_, R. Howden, and R. Coggeshall imply, that the hostages\r\nwere to comprise the whole garrison. The _Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_\r\nassert that the conditions were offered by the Turks in Acre with\r\nSaladin’s knowledge and consent; and the _Itinerarium_ adds that\r\nthe term appointed for their fulfilment was that day month, _i. e._\r\nAugust 12. The king says “Pactione etiam ex parte Saladini plenius\r\nfirmata ... diemque ad haec omnia persolvenda nobis constituit.” R.\r\nDiceto says “Qui” (_i. e._ the Saracens in Acre) “communicato cum\r\nsuis consilio coeperunt tractare de pace talibus pactionibus quod\r\nSaladinus Sanctam Crucem certo die restitueret,” etc. The _Gesta_ and\r\nR. Howden make the term forty days from the surrender, _i. e._ August\r\n20. Bohadin (238) represents Saladin as ignorant of the whole matter\r\ntill after the surrender, and Ibn Alathyr and R. Coggeshall do the\r\nsame; the latter says that Saladin “nimium ex animo consternatus,\r\nfacturum quod petebatur se esse spopondit,” while the two Arab\r\nwriters represent the Sultan as at first refusing to confirm the\r\ntreaty and afterwards accepting its conditions, but, according to\r\nBohadin, with a modification as to the term for payment which brings\r\nthe date for the first instalment practically to the time named in\r\nthe _Itinerarium_, viz. a month after the surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE III\r\n\r\n_The Advance from the Two Casals to Ramlah_\r\n\r\nThe Frank writers give no precise date for the advance of the host in\r\n1191 from “between the two Casals” to the neighbourhood of Ramlah.\r\nAmbrose says they reached the former position on the eve of All\r\nSaints, and stayed there “full fifteen days or more” (_Est._, ll.\r\n7199-209). The _Itin._, 289-90, agrees with him. This should mean\r\nthat they set out again on November 15 or 16. Ambrose, according\r\nto the printed text of the _Estoire_, says the journey to the next\r\nencampment took two days: “L’ost erra par mi la plaine, Sor les\r\nbiaus chevals peus d’orge; _Vint en deus jors_ entre Seint Jorge e\r\nRames; la s’allerent tendre Por plus gent e vitaille atendre” (ll.\r\n7464-8). Thus they would arrive there—_i. e._ between Lydda and\r\nRamlah—on November 17 or 18. The poet further says that the weather\r\nafterwards compelled them to take shelter within the two towns, “e\r\nfumes la bien sis semaines” (ll. 7471-7; _Itin._, 298-9, says the\r\nsame). We presently find that they made their next advance—to Beit\r\nNuba—on January 3. Thus we arrive at November 22 as the date of\r\nentering Lydda and Ramlah, and the encampment “in the plain” appears\r\nto have lasted five or six days (November 17 or 18-22). Our best\r\nArab authority, Bohadin, unluckily does not mention the matter. Ibn\r\nAlathyr (_Rec. Hist. Or._, II. i. 54) says “the Franks set out from\r\ntheir camp at Jaffa for Ramlah on 3 Dulkaada” = November 22; the same\r\ndate is given for their “advance in the direction of Ramlah” by Abu\r\nShama (_ib._, v. 48), but without any clue to his authority for the\r\nstatement. Ibn Alathyr gives this same date, 3 Dulkaada, as that on\r\nwhich “the Franks advanced from Ramlah to Natroun” (_l.c._); this\r\nis doubtless a confusion, made either by author or scribe, between\r\n“Dulkaada” and “Dulheggia,” as Richard—though, indeed, not the\r\nhost—did remove to Natroun on December 22 or 23 (= 3 or 4 Dulheggia).\r\nThe Frankish and the Arab authorities may be partially reconciled by\r\ntaking the “six weeks” of Ambrose and the _Itinerarium_ as covering\r\nthe whole period spent not only within the towns, but also “between”\r\nthem. In that case, however, the stay between the two Casals must\r\nhave been more than fifteen days; it could not have been less than\r\ntwenty days, indeed twenty-two seems a more reasonable reckoning,\r\nfor it is hard to see how two days can possibly have been spent in\r\nmarching even from Casal of the Plains (the more remote of these two\r\nCasals) to either Lydda or Ramlah, a distance of less than eight\r\nmiles. One writer does expressly mention “twenty-two days” in his\r\naccount of this part of the Crusade; but he does so in connexion with\r\nthe sojourn, not between the Casals, but between Lydda and Ramlah.\r\nAmbrose’s lines, 7464-8, quoted above, are in the _Itinerarium_ (298)\r\nrepresented as follows: “Exercitus noster fixis tentoriis _inter\r\nS. Georgium et Ramulam sedit viginti et duobus_ diebus, ut gentem\r\nexpectaret venturam et annonam.”\r\n\r\nTo me this passage in the _Itinerarium_ suggests a possibility of\r\nreconciling practically all the dates and notes of time given by all\r\nour authorities, Arab and Frankish, relating to this matter. It is\r\nnot inconceivable that the original authority—whoever he may have\r\nbeen—for the “twenty-two days” had through a confusion of memory\r\nsubstituted the duration of the stay between the two Casals for\r\nthat of the stay near and in Lydda and Ramlah, and _vice versa_.\r\nIn that case the correct dates would stand thus: Between the two\r\nCasals, twenty-two days, November 1-22; in the plain between Lydda\r\nand Ramlah, “full fifteen days,” November 23-December 8; retirement\r\ninto the two cities December 8, and further advance (to Beit Nuba)\r\non January 3, “six weeks” from the date of encampment between them.\r\nWhether these coincidences are merely accidental, and the “twenty-two\r\ndays” a sheer blunder due to the Latin “translator” having misread\r\n“vint _en_ deux jors” as “vint _e_ deus jors,” in Ambrose’s line\r\n7466, or whether in that line as we now have it _en_ is a scribe’s\r\nerror for _e_, and ll. 7464-6 should be read as a single sentence,\r\nwith a parenthesis stuck into the middle of it for the sake of\r\nrime—“E l’ost erra par mi la plaine (Sor les biaus chevals peus\r\nd’orge) Vint e deus jors entre Seint Jorge e Rames”—whether the\r\n“translator” rendered _erra_ in l. 7464 by _sedit_ because he thought\r\nthus to make better sense of his version of l. 7466, or whether the\r\npoet meant that the host roamed about the plain in which its camp\r\nwas set, and perhaps even shifted the camp about, in vain efforts to\r\navoid the enemies and the rain (see ll. 7469-75, especially l. 7473,\r\n“Iceles pluies _nos chacerent_”); these are questions involving too\r\nmany other questions for a discussion of them to be attempted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE IV\r\n\r\n_Casal des Plains and Casal des Bains_\r\n\r\nI have ventured, in defiance of the printed text of the _Estoire_,\r\nto follow the writer of the _Itinerarium_ in giving to Richard’s\r\nlurking-place on the night of January 2-3, 1192, the name of Casal\r\nof the Baths. “Casellum Balneorum” occurs in the _Itinerarium_\r\ntwice. In p. 298 we read that while the host lay between Lydda and\r\nRamlah “pluviae a sedibus nostris nos exturbabant, intantum ut rex\r\nJerosolimorum et gens nostra infra S. Georgium ad hospitandum se\r\ntransferrent et in Ramulam, _comes vero de S. Paulo ad Casellum\r\nBalneorum_.” The last eight words are not represented at all in\r\nthe _Estoire_. In pp. 306, 307, of the _Itinerarium_ we are told:\r\n“Tertia post Circumcisionem Domini die, cum exercitus noster ad\r\nprogrediendum” [from Lydda and Ramlah to Beit Nuba] “se sollicitus\r\nexpediret, deformium multitudo Turcorum qui eadem nocte praeterita\r\njuxta Casellum de _Planis_ in insidiis delituerant inter frutecta\r\nprosiliit diluculo in viam observandam per quam noster transiturus\r\nerat exercitus.... Rex quippe Ricardus, cui prius innotuerat\r\nde praedictis Turcorum insidiis, propterea quaque eadem nocte\r\nad Casellum _Balneorum_ consederat in insidiis, ut videlicet\r\ninsidiantibus insidiaret, mane progrediens,” etc. In the _Estoire_\r\nthe corresponding passage runs thus: “Tier jor d’an noef, la matinee,\r\nEsteit une ovre destinee; Sarazins, les laides genz brunes, Sor le\r\nCasal des Plains as dunes Le seir devant ja se bucherent, E tote\r\nnuit illoc guaiterent Desqu’al matin que il saillirent Al chemin de\r\nl’ost.... Le rei d’Engletere aveit, Qui cel embuchement saveit, Por\r\nço al Casal des _Plains_ geu,” etc. (ll. 7717-24, 7729-31).\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the “Casellum Balneorum” of _Itin._, 298,\r\nmay represent Amwas (= “Fountains”), otherwise called Nicopolis (see\r\nStubbs’s note to _Itin._, _l.c._). This identification is possible;\r\nbut it seems very unlikely that a small fraction of the host should,\r\nfor no apparent reason, put itself so nearly into the lion’s mouth by\r\ngoing to camp eight or nine miles in advance of the rest, and less\r\nthan two miles from the encampment of Saladin, which at that time\r\nwas at Natroun. Moreover, in a later passage common to _Estoire_ (l.\r\n9846) and _Itinerarium_ (369) we find “la fontaine d’Esmals,” “ad\r\nfontem Emaus,” in a context which plainly shows that these names\r\nstand for Amwas-Nicopolis; but in p. 307 of _Itinerarium_ the context\r\nseems to preclude an identification of Casellum Balneorum with Emaus\r\n= Amwas, and to point to some place much further north or north-west;\r\nand later commentators have found such a place, bearing a name which\r\ntranslates the Latin one more exactly than Amwas, in Umm-el-Hummum,\r\nnear Mirabel. On the other hand, the extant text of the _Estoire_, as\r\nwe have seen, has nothing at all answering to “Castellum Balneorum”;\r\nit makes the Turkish ambush and the king spend the night of January\r\n2-3 at, or close to, one and the same place, the Casal of the Plains.\r\nWhence, then, did the Latin writer get his “Casal of the Baths”? He\r\ncan hardly have invented it for himself. If his work be really a\r\ntranslation of that of Ambrose, he must either have made it from a\r\ncopy which had _Bains_, not _Plains_, in l. 7731, or he must have\r\nhad some other source of information which made him deliberately\r\nsubstitute “Baths” for “Plains” in his rendering of that line. The\r\nsubstitution cannot be explained as a misreading on his part, since\r\n“Casal des Plains” in l. 7720 is correctly represented in his text\r\nby “Casellum de Planis.” That he knew, from a source other than the\r\n_Estoire_, something about the Casal of the Baths is clear from his\r\nearlier mention of that place, in p. 298. A different theory as to\r\nthe relation between the two books suggests that that source may have\r\nbeen personal knowledge. However this may be, his second mention of\r\n“Casellum Balneorum” certainly makes the passage in which it occurs\r\nfar more intelligible than the corresponding passage in the existing\r\ntext of the _Estoire_. Ambrose’s story, as it stands there, is\r\nscarcely credible. The Turks and the king lie in wait for one another\r\nall night, the former “on the sandhills above the Casal of the\r\nPlains,” the latter at the Casal of the Plains itself, yet neither\r\nparty catches the other till, evidently to the utter surprise of the\r\nTurks, they meet before the camp at Ramlah or Lydda, to which they\r\nmust, if this version of the affair be correct, have ridden at almost\r\nthe same time, parallel with and in close proximity to each other for\r\nabout eight miles, and almost from one and the same starting-point!\r\nSurely, by the light—whencesoever derived—of the Latin version, we\r\ncan see that either Ambrose himself or the scribe of the extant MS.\r\nof his work has erroneously written _Plains_ instead of _Bains_ in\r\nl. 7731; a mistake which might very easily be made, owing to the\r\noccurrence of “Plains” only eleven lines above, and the absence of\r\nany mention of Casal des Bains elsewhere in the poem.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE V\r\n\r\n_Richard’s Homage to the Emperor_\r\n\r\nSeven contemporary or nearly contemporary writers state that Richard,\r\nto purchase his freedom, did homage to Henry VI. Three of these—one\r\nEnglish and two German—assert distinctly that the kingdom of England\r\nwas included in this homage; two of the others—one German and one\r\nFrench—imply the same.\r\n\r\n(1) “Ricardus rex Angliae in captione Henrici Romanorum imperatoris\r\ndetentus, ut captionem illam evaderet, consilio Alienor matris suae\r\ndeposuit se de regno Angliae et tradidit illud imperatori sicut\r\nuniversorum domino; et investivit eum inde per pilleum suum; sed\r\nimperator, sicut praelocutum fuit, statim reddidit ei, in conspectu\r\nmagnatium Alemanniae et Angliae, regnum Angliae praedictum, tenendum\r\nde ipso pro quinque millia librarum sterlingorum singulis annis de\r\ntributo solvendis; et investivit eum inde imperator per duplicem\r\ncrucem de auro.” R. Howden, iii. 202, 203.\r\n\r\n(2) The _Annals of Marbach_ (Pertz, xvii. 165) say Richard was\r\nreleased “tota terra sua, Anglia et aliis terris suis propriis,\r\nimperatori datis et ab eo in beneficio receptis.”\r\n\r\n(3) “Legium ipsi [imperatori] faciens hominium, coronam regni sui ab\r\nipso recepit,” _Gesta Episc. Halberstad._ (Pertz, xxiii. 110).\r\n\r\n(4) “Terram propriam ... imperatori tradidit et a manu imperatoris\r\nsceptro investitus suscepit. Juravitque fidelitatem Romano\r\nImperatori et Romano Imperio et privilegio exinde facto propria\r\nmanu subscripsit. Tantam itaque devotionem regis intuens imperator\r\nsceptrum regium quod in manu sua tenebat regi contulit, ut hoc\r\ninsigni dono in posterum uteretur.... Acta sunt haec apud Maguntium.”\r\n_Ann. Salsburg. Additamenta_, Pertz, xiii. 240.\r\n\r\n(5) William the Breton represents Richard as offering to give the\r\nEmperor a hundred thousand marks, and adding: “Meque sceptrumque meum\r\nsubjecta fatebor.... Rex igitur dictum re firmat, et inde recedit\r\nliber.” _Philippis_, lib. iv., vv. 419, 426-7.\r\n\r\n(6) “Accepta infinita summa pecuniae et hominio ejus ... [imperator\r\nregem] absolutum permittit abire.” _Reineri Ann._, Pertz, xvi. 651.\r\n\r\n(7) “[Richardus] Imperio postquam jurans se subdidit, inquit: ‘Vivat\r\nin aeternum lux mea, liber eo.’”—_P. de Ebulo_, ll. 1087-8.\r\n\r\nOf all these authorities, only the first is of any real value.\r\nThe German sources for this period are all mere monastic or\r\necclesiastical chronicles; the Annals of Marbach are among the best.\r\nThe Acts of the Bishops of Halberstadt date from the thirteenth\r\ncentury. Reiner’s Annals are a section, ending in 1230, of a group of\r\nChronicles of Liége; Reiner himself was born in 1155. The Additions\r\nto the Salzburg Annals are absolutely worthless; they are full of\r\nabsurdities; and some of their statements about Richard are so\r\nobviously unhistorical that their German editor in his footnotes\r\ntwice denounces them as “fables”—“Hoc jam fabulis plena de Richardi\r\nregis gestis” (p. 238)—“Iterum fabulae sequuntur prioribus pejores”\r\n(p. 240). Peter of Ebulo and William of Armorica can only have had\r\ntheir information at—to say the least—second hand, and from sources\r\nhostile to Richard; Peter was the panegyrist of Henry VI, William\r\nthe historiographer of Philip Augustus; both, too, wrote in verse,\r\nand are open to the suspicion of a liberal use of poetic licence to\r\nexalt their respective heroes and diminish the glory of him who was\r\nthe most illustrious rival of those two sovereigns. Had we only these\r\nsix writers to deal with, we might be justified in treating the whole\r\nstory as a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of an act of homage\r\ndone to Henry by Richard for the kingdom of Burgundy, although, oddly\r\nenough, not one of them so much as mentions Burgundy at all. But\r\nRoger of Howden is not so easy to dispose of. He was a sober-minded\r\nand well-informed English historian, whose work in many places shows\r\nthat he had access to the best official sources of contemporary\r\ninformation; in his case misunderstanding and misrepresentation on\r\nthe subject are both alike almost inconceivable; and, moreover, his\r\nversion of the matter is indirectly corroborated by another writer\r\nwhose general accuracy and correct information rank as high, and\r\nwhose facilities for learning the truth on this particular point\r\nwere probably even greater than those of Roger himself. Ralf de\r\nDiceto (ii. 113) writes as follows: “Pactiones initae sunt plures\r\ninter imperatorem et regem, ad persolvendam non spectantes pecuniam,\r\nsed ad statum regis intervertendum; inter quas quicquid insertum est\r\nab initio vitiosum, quicquid contra leges, contra canones, contra\r\nbonos mores indubitanter conceptum, licet ex parte regis et suorum\r\nfidelium ad hoc observandum fuerit jusjurandum adauctum, emissa\r\nlicet patentia scripta, licet in mundum universitatis recepta,\r\nlicet a partibus absoluta, quia tamen contra jus elicita robur\r\nfirmitatis obtinere non debent in posterum, nec ullo tractu temporis\r\nconvalescere.” These words seem distinctly to point to something more\r\nthan homage merely for the kingdom of Arles, a homage which there\r\ncould surely be no reason for Ralf or anyone else to denounce as so\r\n“vicious from the outset, so contrary to law, morality, and right” as\r\nto be utterly null and void. We must also remember that Ralf was a\r\nclose friend of Archbishop Walter of Rouen, who was in correspondence\r\nwith him at this very time, and who was present at the whole ceremony\r\nof Richard’s release.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE VI\r\n\r\n_Richard, William of Longchamps, and the Great Seal_\r\n\r\nRoger of Howden in his account of the year 1194, after giving the\r\nterms of the truce made between the representatives of the two kings\r\non July 23 in the form of a proclamation addressed “to all whom it\r\nmay concern” by Drogo de Merlo the Constable of France, Anselm the\r\nDean of S. Martin’s at Tours, and Urse the French king’s chamberlain\r\n(iii. 257-60), diverges to English affairs (260-7) and then returns\r\nto continental ones as follows:\r\n\r\n“Deinde [Ricardus Rex] veniens in Normanniam moleste tulit quicquid\r\nfactum fuerit de supradictis treugis, et imputans cancellario suo\r\nhoc per eum fuisse factum, abstulit ab eo sigillum suum, et fecit\r\nsibi novum sigillum fieri, et mandavit per singulas terras suas quod\r\nnihil ratum foret quod fuerat per vetus sigillum suum; tum quia\r\ncancellarius ille operatus fuerat inde minus discrete quam esset\r\nnecesse, tum quia sigillum illud perditum erat quando Rogerus Malus\r\nCatulus, vice-cancellarius suus, submersus erat in mare ante insulam\r\nde Cipro. Et praecepit rex quod omnes qui cartas habebant venirent ad\r\nnovum sigillum suum ad cartas suas renovandas.” R. Howden, iii. 267.\r\n\r\nThis story is certainly not strictly accurate; it was not till 1198\r\nthat Richard changed his seal, and if the seal was withdrawn from\r\nWilliam of Ely in 1194, it was restored to him almost immediately,\r\nand he remained the king’s chancellor and trusted friend to the end\r\nof Richard’s life. Nevertheless, it seems clear that Richard did\r\nmomentarily contemplate in 1194 a change of seal and the consequent\r\nrequirement of confirmation of charters issued under the old seal.\r\nWhen this actually took place four years later, he himself stated\r\nhis reasons for it as follows: “Quod” [sc. primum sigillum nostrum]\r\n“quia aliquando perditum erat, et dum capti essemus in Alemannia\r\nin aliena potestate constitutum, mutatum est.” (Confirmation of a\r\ncharter to Ely, July 1, 1198, printed in _Ramsey Cartulary_, ed. Hart\r\nand Lyons, i. 115, and also in Round’s _Feudal England_, 542). Mr.\r\nRound dismisses Roger’s story as sheer fiction, on the ground that\r\nthe second reason here given by Richard is “wholly and essentially\r\ndifferent” from the first reason given by Roger. Even if this be so,\r\nit does not necessarily follow that the whole of Roger’s story is\r\neither a fiction, or a delusion, or misdated. Richard’s own statement\r\nof his motives is obviously a mere excuse; the self-evident fact that\r\nwhile he was in prison the seal was necessarily “in the power of\r\nanother” might be a ground for annulling acts passed under it during\r\nthat time, but could be no genuine reason for revoking likewise all\r\nother acts passed under it. One at least of his excuses, however,\r\nis far more likely to have been invented in 1194 than in 1198. The\r\nking’s temporary loss of control over the seal in 1193-4 might be a\r\ncolourable pretext for getting rid of the discredited instrument at\r\nthe earliest possible moment, but could in no way account for its\r\nrepudiation after it had been, without necessity, suffered to remain\r\nin use for four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abou Bekr, 251, 256\r\n\r\n  Achard of Châlus,

Richard (_Comtes de Poitou_, ii. 51) thinks Emma was only\r\nbetrothed, not married, to the duke. His arguments are not strong\r\nenough to convince me against the distinct statement of Geoffrey of\r\nVigeois.\r\n\r\n[13] “Lemovicæ comes” (_sic_) “habet feudum de abbate S. Martialis\r\ncastellum de Petra Buffiera et turrim de castello quod est super\r\nCharnix, Lemovicense castrum, vicariam de turre, Bernardii\r\ncastellum de Cambono S. Valeriæ. Pro his omnibus debent hominium\r\nfacere abbatibus cunctis omnes vicecomites qui feudum istud\r\ntenuerunt”—Geoffrey, the writer, had twice seen it performed—“...\r\nAbbas tamen dominium totius castri Lemovicini habere debet, vicecomes\r\nvicariam tantum.... Burgenses vero argenti pondere fulti vicecomiti\r\nvix obtemperant, quando minus monachis” Geoff. Vigeois, 333. For the\r\nsignificance of “castrum Lemovicense,” see the next footnote.\r\n\r\n[14] “Lite mota inter cives et hospites, Dux irritatus est; tunc\r\nmuros castri, qui non multo tempore fuerunt constructi, funditus\r\nevertit, pontemque disrupit.... Procurationem noluit Albertus Abbas\r\nin urbem facere Duci, dicens non debere extra septa reddere castri.”\r\nGeoff. Vigeois, 308. Limoges in those days, and long after, was a\r\nsort of double town of which one part, comprising the cathedral\r\nchurch and its precincts and seemingly called the “city,” belonged to\r\nthe bishop, and the other part to the abbot of S. Martial’s, under\r\nhomage to whom it was governed by the viscount. Each part had its own\r\nenclosure. There was no castle in the ordinary sense of that word;\r\nbut the abbot’s part, which was the more populous and important part\r\nof the town, seems to have taken the title of _castrum_. The case was\r\nsomewhat like that of the city of Tours and the _Castrum S. Martini_,\r\nor Châteauneuf.\r\n\r\n[15] Geoff. Vigeois, 308-10.\r\n\r\n[16] R.

It is possible that the royal family may have been\r\nthere also in September, and that the “festum filii Regis” may have\r\nbeen Richard’s birthday; but it is perhaps more likely to have been\r\nthat of young Henry, February 28.\r\n\r\n[19] R.

There was an Aimeric de Lusignan, and\r\nalso a Geoffrey de Lusignan, and there was furthermore a Geoffrey de\r\nRancogne of whom we shall hear again. To me it seems most probable\r\nthat the Lusignan here referred to was Aimeric, and that his\r\nChristian name has (owing to a confusion between him and his brother)\r\nbeen transposed with that of the lord of Rancogne.\r\n\r\n[29] R.

Vigeois, 318-19.\r\nGeoffrey does not give the year explicitly, but he does so implicitly\r\nby saying that Raymond of Toulouse did homage to Richard “anno\r\nsequenti.” S. Valeria’s body was at S. Martial’s abbey at Limoges;\r\n_ib._, 285. According to Geoffrey and the Chronicle of S. Martial’s\r\n(ed. Duplès-Agier), 209, she was the protomartyr not only of\r\nAquitaine but of Gaul.\r\n\r\n[41] _Gesta Hen._, i. 35-6. The presence of Eleanor and the date of\r\nthe homage—“Dominica qua cantatur Invocavit Me,” _i. e._ February\r\n25—are mentioned only by Geoff. Vigeois, 319, who adds: “Feria\r\nquarta, alias sexta, heroes qui per dies septem concilium celebravere\r\nLemovica discedunt ab urbe”; _i. e._ the kings and counts were at\r\nLimoges either from Thursday, February 22, to Wednesday, 28, or\r\nfrom Saturday, February 24, to Friday, March 2. This assembly of a\r\nweek’s duration at Limoges is clearly to be identified with the one\r\ndescribed by the local chronicler, Bernard Itier, in a very corrupt\r\npassage which his latest editor, M. Duplès-Agier, has printed (p.\r\n58) from the much mutilated MS. with conjectural emendations, thus:\r\n“Anno gracie MCLXXII ... [Alienor Regina] et filio Ricardo et com ...\r\n[et regibus de] Arragonia et de Navarra [venerunt] ... Lemovicas et\r\nper viii dies in ca[stro Lemovicensi moram] fecerunt.” February 1173\r\nin our reckoning would be February 1172 in Bernard’s reckoning, as\r\nin the kingdom of France the year began at Easter. I think that for\r\n“Alienor Regina” we should substitute “Rex cum Regina,” and supply\r\n“[ite Tolosæ]” after “com.” What the king of Navarre—Sancho VI,\r\nfather of Berengaria whom Richard ultimately married—had come for,\r\nthere is nothing to show. Count Gerard of Vienne, whom R. Diceto (i.\r\n353) adds to the list of those present, was a Provençal subfeudatary\r\nof Raymond of Toulouse, and so may have been concerned in Raymond’s\r\ndispute with Alfonso. The statement of R. Diceto (i. 353-4) that\r\n“quia Ricardus Dux Aquitaniæ, cui facturus esset homagium comes\r\nSancti Ægidii, presens non erat, usque ad octavas Pentecostes negotii\r\ncomplementum dilationem accepit,” is clearly erroneous.\r\n\r\n[42] _Gesta Hen._, i. 41-2.

I am uncertain whether “Montigernac” is meant\r\nfor Montignac, or Jarnac, or for both; very likely the latter, as the\r\ntwo places are close together, and the writer not being familiar with\r\nthe country may easily have run two names into one.\r\n\r\n[77] Cf. _Gesta_, 120, 121, with R.

Vigeois, 324, speaks as if she were still living at the time\r\nof its sale. She may have died soon after, and as she was childless\r\n(_ib._, and Chron. MS. printed in Duplès-Agier, _Chron. de Limoges_,\r\n188), whatever rights she might have claimed would die with her.\r\n\r\n[98] _Gesta_, i. 197; R. Howden, ii. 147-8; and cf. Geoff. Vigeois,\r\n324, and _Chron. S. Mart. Limoges_, 188, which gives the date October\r\n7, but Adalbert’s own charter (_Gesta_ and R. Howd., _ll.cc._) says\r\n“mense Decembri.” G. Vigeois gives the sum paid as 5000 marks;\r\nthe _Chron. S. Mart._, 189, R. Torigni a. 1177, and R. Diceto, i.\r\n425, make it 6000 marks of silver, and R. Torigni adds “terram ...\r\nvalentem, ut idem rex dixit, viginti millia marcas argenti.” The\r\n_Gesta_ and R. Howden both insert a copy of Adalbert’s charter, but\r\nthe writer of the former must have copied the figures wrongly, for\r\nhe makes the sum only fifteen pounds Angevin; in Roger’s version it\r\nis 15,000 pounds Angevin. Both versions add twenty mules and twenty\r\npalfreys.\r\n\r\n[99] R. Torigni, a. 1177.\r\n\r\n[100] He was with his father and brothers at Angers at Christmas,\r\n1177; R. Torigni, _ad ann._\r\n\r\n[101] “Cum magno exercitu _in Pictaviam_ profectus,” says our\r\nauthority, _Gesta_, i. 212; but clearly he must mean either “in\r\nGasconiam” or “ex Pictavia.”\r\n\r\n[102] _Gesta_, i. 212, 213.\r\n\r\n[103] _Ib._, 212.\r\n\r\n[104] R.

Some modern writers have taken it as intended to imply\r\nthat Richard was light of purpose, or of a wavering disposition.\r\nAs Clédat points out (Bertran de Born, 101-2), such an explanation\r\nwould be quite out of harmony not only with Richard’s real character\r\nas displayed in his actions from the very outset of his rule in\r\nAquitaine, but also with every other indication of Bertran’s opinion\r\nof him. We might almost more reasonably conjecture that although\r\nwhen Richard did swear he used some very extraordinary oaths (“Per\r\ngorgiam Dei,” Gir. Cambr. _De Instr. Princ._ dist. iii. c. 25, on\r\nwhich Gerald comments “quoniam his et similibus sacramentibus uti\r\nsolet”; “Par les gambes Dieu,” _Hist. G. le Mar._ ll. 8839, 9367),\r\nhis usual practice was to “swear not at all,” but so to act that a\r\nsimple statement from him of his will and purpose, “yea” or “nay,”\r\nwas recognized as being no less positive and final than if he had\r\nconfirmed it with an oath.\r\n\r\n[121] Cf. the character given by a Flemish chronicler, “Richard ...\r\nke otre toz les boins estoit preus e vaillans.” _Hist. des Ducs_, 84.\r\n\r\n[122] Gir. Cambr. _De Instr. Princ._, dist. iii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[123] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[124] Gir. Cambr. _De Instr. Princ._, dist. iii. c. 8. Cf. Bertrand\r\nde Born, “Ar ve la coindeta sazos,” ll. 33-5:\r\n\r\nBom sap l’usatge qu’a’l leos Qu’a re venenda non es maus, Mas contra\r\norgolh es orgolhos.—\r\n\r\nwhere the context shows that the “lion” stands for Richard.\r\n\r\n[125] Gir. Cambr. _De Instr. Princ._, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[126] _Ib._; Gerv. Cant. i. 303; and cf. R. Diceto, ii.\r\n19—“Pictaviensibus ... quos Ricardus indebitis vexationibus et\r\nviolenta dominatione premebat.”\r\n\r\n[127] His brutal treatment of his Breton and “Basque” prisoners in\r\n1183 is a wholly different matter. Those prisoners were not his\r\nown subjects; they were foreign invaders; the charge of cruelty\r\nmentioned above had no reference to them. Moreover, even their fate\r\ndoes not necessarily indicate that Richard was of a specially cruel\r\ndisposition, for that fate does not appear to have outraged the\r\npublic opinion of their day, at any rate in Aquitaine.\r\n\r\n[128] _Gesta_, i. 292.\r\n\r\n[129] Geoff. Vigeois, 317. It is a pity that Geoffrey’s rime,\r\n“Richardus, qui ad probitatis opera nunquam exstitit tardus,” cannot\r\nbe reproduced in an English translation; and also that “prowess”\r\nin its modern use conveys such an imperfect idea of the medieval\r\n_probitas_. The rime may be unintentional; but it is far more likely\r\nto be derived from some vernacular couplet current at the time “...\r\nEn Richartz, Qu’ad obras de proesa ja n’estet tartz,” or something\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\n[130] R. Torigni, a. 1179. See the various names applied to these\r\n“malignants,” “whose teeth and arms had nearly devoured Aquitaine,”\r\nin Geoff. Vigeois, 328, 334.\r\n\r\n[131] _Ib._, 325; for date see Clédat, _B. de Born_, 42, note.\r\n\r\n[132] See B. de Born’s _sirventes_, “Ges no me desconort,” ll. 22-3,\r\nwhere he speaks of “the three counts of Angoulême”—“li trei comte fat\r\nEngolmesi.”\r\n\r\n[133] Geoff. Vigeois, 326.\r\n\r\n[134] In p. 327 Geoffrey says in reference to a period which from\r\nthe context seems to be about the end of January 1181: “Tunc genus\r\ninimicitiarum Richardi et Alienoris in speciem amicitiae vertitur.”\r\nAs there is no indication elsewhere of “unfriendliness” between\r\nRichard and his mother, nor of anything which might have given\r\nrise to it, nor of anything likely to produce a change in their\r\nfeelings towards each other at this time; and as, moreover, their\r\nintercommunications must for the past seven years have been extremely\r\nlimited if not altogether non-existent, seeing that Eleanor had\r\nbeen throughout that time in confinement in England, I cannot but\r\nsuspect that this passage is corrupt. Possibly “Alienoris” may be a\r\ntranscriber’s mistake for “Ademari,” and the person really meant may\r\nbe Aimar of Limoges.\r\n\r\n[135] Geoff. Vigeois, 327.\r\n\r\n[136] R. Diceto, ii. 9; cf. Gerv. Cant., i. 297.\r\n\r\n[137] Geoff. Vigeois, 326; for the year see Clédat, _B. de Born_, 42,\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n[138] “Qui” (_i. e._ the Duke) “cum puella terram obtinere tentavit,”\r\nsays G. Vigeois, 326. A statement made by some modern writers that\r\nRichard wanted to marry the girl and thus annex her county seems to\r\nbe without authority.\r\n\r\n[139] G. Vigeois, 326.\r\n\r\n[140] Gerv. Cant. i. 303.\r\n\r\n[141] Hautefort was in the diocese of Périgord, but in the viscounty\r\nof Limoges; cf. the two biographies of Bertrand de Born, Thomas, _B.\r\nde Born_, li., Stimming (ed. 1892), 51; the “contradiction” which\r\nStimming (3) finds on this point exists only in his own imagination,\r\nand he is mistaken in branding as “false” the second biographer’s\r\nstatement that Bertrand “fu de Lemozi,” for Bertrand himself speaks\r\nof “Nos Lemozi” in his sirventes “Eu chant,” l. 44, Thomas, 21,\r\nStimming, 69.\r\n\r\n[142] _Razo_ of “Un sirventes cui motz no falh,” Thomas, 7; Stimming,\r\n6-7.\r\n\r\n[143] Provençal biography of B. de Born, No. I, Thomas, li.\r\n\r\n[144] _Sirventes_, “Lo coms m’a mandat,” ll. 45, 46, Thomas, 6.\r\n\r\n[145] See “Un sirventes cui motz no falh,” ll. 9-14.\r\n\r\n[146] Another Aimar, William, and Elias. It was the two former\r\nwho tried to get possession of Angoulême in succession to their\r\neldest brother Vulgrin (G. Vigeois, 326). Elias was still\r\nliving in January-February 1183, when “Helias et Sector Ferri”\r\nare coupled together by G. Vigeois (332) as “Vulgrini defuncti\r\ncomites Engolismensis fratres.” It is doubtful whether “Sector\r\nFerri”—Taillefer, a surname used by all the counts of Angoulême at\r\nthis period—here represents William or Aimar. Some modern writers\r\ndate William’s death in 1181. He was at any rate still alive in June\r\nof that year; G. Vigeois (326) says definitely “_Guillermus_ et\r\nAdemarus defuncto inhiabant succedere fratri,” _i. e._ to succeed\r\nVulgrin who died in June 1181, see Clédat, _B. de Born_, 42, note.\r\n\r\n[147] “Ges no mi desconort,” ll. 35-8.\r\n\r\n[148] “Tals me plevi sa fe No feses plait sens me,” _ib._ ll. 39-40.\r\nObviously this “pledging of faith” could not apply to Bertrand alone.\r\nNor was he the only one towards whom it was broken, as we shall see.\r\n\r\n[149] Cf. “Pois Ventadorn,” ll. 1-3, with “Ges no mi desconort,” ll.\r\n18-25.\r\n\r\n[150] _Razo_ of “Un sirventes cui motz no falh,” Thomas, 7.

Vigeois, 324.\r\n\r\n[154] He was there in February or March 1181, and again in May and on\r\nJune 24, 1182; _ib._ 326, 330.\r\n\r\n[155] “Pois Ventadorn,” l. 4.\r\n\r\n[156] G. Vigeois, 330, 331.\r\n\r\n[157] _Ib._, 320.\r\n\r\n[158] “Quod protinus adimpletur,” says G. Vigeois, 326.\r\n\r\n[159] See the last six lines of “Pois Ventadorn,” with the note of M.\r\nThomas, _B. de Born_, 15. I venture to think M. Thomas is mistaken\r\nin assuming that “Talhafer” represents either Elias or William. We\r\nknow from John’s treaty with Philip in 1193 that at some time or\r\nother Aimar had done homage to Philip (“Comes Engolismensis tenebit\r\nterram suam a Rege Franciae, illam scilicet de qua fecit se hominem\r\n[illius?]; a me,” _i. e._ John, “vero tenebit aliam terram quam a\r\nme debet tenere,” _Fœdera_ I. i. 57); there is nothing to show that\r\nhe was the youngest of the family; it seems more likely that he was\r\nthe next to Vulgrin in age, and therefore, if Maud’s claim was to be\r\nruled out, next to Vulgrin also in the line of succession.\r\n\r\n[160] G. Vigeois, 331.\r\n\r\n[161] The district in which Clairvaux stood—the Loudunais—had\r\noriginally belonged to Poitou; it was annexed to Anjou towards the\r\nend of the tenth century by Geoffrey Greygown, who held it under\r\nhomage to the Poitevin Count William III. This homage became obsolete\r\nafter Geoffrey Martel’s victory over William VIII in 1033. Richard\r\nmay possibly have had some idea of reviving the Poitevin claim to\r\nthe overlordship of the Loudunais; but it is more likely that he\r\nsimply did not know, and did not care to ascertain, exactly where the\r\nfrontier line ran.\r\n\r\n[162] “Pois Ventadorn,” ll. 33-40.\r\n\r\n[163] _Gesta_, i. 294; R. Diceto, ii. 18, where young Henry is made\r\nto say that Richard fortified Clairvaux “contra suam” (_i. e._ young\r\nHenry’s) “voluntatem.”\r\n\r\n[164] G. Vigeois, 332; Bern. Itier, a. 1182.\r\n\r\n[165] G. Vigeois, 332—“Olivarus frater Petri vicecomitis de\r\nCastellone,” _i. e._ Castillon in Périgord. A month earlier Aimar\r\nof Limoges had taken and destroyed the “Burgum S. Germani”; _ib._\r\nProbably this means S. Germain-les-Belles, near Limoges, and Aimar\r\nwas merely chastising a vassal of his own; at any rate there is\r\nnothing to imply that the matter concerned Richard in any way.\r\n\r\n[166] Cf. “Ges de disnar,” ll. 27, 28, and “Chazutz sui,” ll. 29-31.\r\n\r\n[167] “Chazutz sui,” ll. 25-36.\r\n\r\n[168] “Ges de disnar,” ll. 27, 28.\r\n\r\n[169] See “No posc mudar,” ll. 13-16, and Thomas, Introd. xv. I\r\nventure, however, to think that “Rancon” probably stands not for the\r\nplace now so called, in Haute-Vienne (Thomas, 77, note 4), _i. e._\r\nin the Limousin, but for Rancogne in the Angoumois, the home of the\r\nwell-known Geoffrey, lord also of Pons and of Taillebourg.\r\n\r\n[170] See “Ges no mi desconort,” ll. 11-14, with the reference to\r\n“quem disses [el coms, _i. e._ Richard] antan.”\r\n\r\n[171] _Gesta_, i. 291.\r\n\r\n[172] _Ib._, 294, 295.\r\n\r\n[173] _Ib._, 295.\r\n\r\n[174] _Gesta_, i. 295.\r\n\r\n[175] R.

Diceto, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[177] _I. e._, probably, to an explanation that the homage was not\r\nmeant to take effect till young Henry should be in his father’s place.\r\n\r\n[178] _Gesta_, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[179] _Ib._, 295.\r\n\r\n[180] “Vehementer excanduit, incongruum esse dicens, ut dicitur, cum\r\neodem ex patre, cum eadem ex matre, traxisset originem, si fratrem\r\nprimogenitum aliqua specie subjectionis superiorem agnosceret; sed\r\nsicut ipsi fratri suo regi lege primogenitorum bona debebantur\r\npaterna, sic in bonis maternis aequa lance successionem legitimam\r\nvindicabat,” R. Diceto, ii. 18, 19. That is to say, in fact, he\r\nclaimed to hold Aquitaine, _after his father’s death_, as a direct\r\nunderfief of the kingdom of France, and not as a part of the Angevin\r\ndominions at all. In other words, he claimed the right to break up\r\nthe Angevin empire; which was precisely what Henry II was trying to\r\nprevent.\r\n\r\n[181] _Gesta_, i. 292.\r\n\r\n[182] R. Diceto, ii. 19.\r\n\r\n[183] Cf. _Gesta_, i. 292 and 295.\r\n\r\n[184] “Transacta Purificatione B. Mariae,” G. Vigeois, 332. Geoffrey\r\ndates the quarrel between the king’s sons “tertio idus Decembris,\r\ncelebrata Domini Nativitate.” Can he mean “tertio idus Januarii,”\r\nJanuary 11? This might very well be the date of the final quarrel\r\nbetween young Henry and Richard.\r\n\r\n[185] _Gesta_, i. 296.\r\n\r\n[186] G. Vigeois, _l.c._; _Gesta_, i. 292, 293.\r\n\r\n[187] _Gesta_, i. 293. It is hardly possible that Geoffrey can have\r\nhad time to go in person into Britanny as the _Gesta_ imply; but\r\nit is clear from Bertrand de Born’s poem “D’un sirventes nom chal”\r\nthat he was deep in the Aquitanian plot before his eldest brother’s\r\nadhesion to it was known; no doubt, therefore, he had secretly made\r\nhis preparations beforehand for the crisis which had now come.\r\n\r\n[188] G. Vigeois, 332.\r\n\r\n[189] G. Vigeois, 332.\r\n\r\n[190] _Gesta_, i. 292. G. Vigeois, _l.c._, mentions among the\r\n“barones et principes” who “tunc temporis conspiraverunt adversus\r\nRicardum,” besides young Henry and Geoffrey of Britanny, Elias, and\r\n“Taillefer” of Angoulême, Aimar of Limoges, Raymond of Turenne, Peter\r\nviscount of Castillon and his brother Oliver of Chalais, Fulcaud of\r\nArchiac (in Saintonge) and Geoffrey of Lusignan. This last was now\r\nat Limoges, and in the most intimate counsels of the young king; see\r\n_Hist. G. le Mar._, ll. 6408-13.\r\n\r\n[191] R. Howden, ii. 274.\r\n\r\n[192] G. Vigeois, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[193] Saint Pierre du Queiroix, “de Quadrivio,” situated near the\r\nnorth-east angle of the old town or Castrum S. Martialis; _ib._\r\n\r\n[194] “Santius de Sarannas et Curbanus seu Curbaranus,” G. Vigeois,\r\n333; in all other places where Geoffrey mentions the latter he\r\nuses the longer form of the name. “Curbaran” is the name of a\r\nSaracen prince in the _Chanson d’Antioche_. In the printed editions\r\nof Geoffrey’s history the other leader figures as _Sautius_ and\r\n_Saucius_, but these are probably misreadings of _Santius_ and\r\n_Sancius_, Latin for Sancho or Sanchez. Sérannes or Serranes is the\r\nname of a cluster of hills in what is now the department of Héraut;\r\nmost likely this bandit chief had a favourite lurking-place there;\r\ncf. “Willekin of the Weald.”\r\n\r\n[195] G. Vigeois, 333, 334.\r\n\r\n[196] _Ib._, 333-4.\r\n\r\n[197] “Citramarinos principes.”\r\n\r\n[198] G. Vigeois, 335-6.\r\n\r\n[199] _Gesta_, i. 299.\r\n\r\n[200] G.

Bertrand’s modern commentators have assumed\r\nthat the nominative to “a cobrat e ... delivrat” is “lo reis joves,”\r\nand understood ll. 9-12 as referring to the invasion of the Angoumois\r\nand Saintonge by the Routiers in behalf of young Henry. I venture\r\nto suggest that the true nominative is “lo coms”—_i. e._, the count\r\nof Poitou. There could be no “recovery” of the Angoumois either\r\nby or for young Henry, who had never had any authority there. The\r\nwhole structure and context of the lines indicate that they refer to\r\nRichard. “Finibus Terra,” Finisterre, doubtless stands here, like\r\n“Broceliande” in another of Bertrand’s poems (“D’un sirventes nom\r\nchal,” l. 33), simply for Britanny.\r\n\r\n[202] “Eu chant,” ll. 5-12, 16-18.

During that period,\r\nhowever, such a betrothal would give Philip no lawful ground for\r\ncomplaint, although a mischief-maker might easily use it, either at\r\nthe time or some years later, to excite the French king’s resentment\r\nagainst a man who had thus failed to appreciate the honour of\r\nbecoming his brother-in-law and preferred a daughter of Navarre to a\r\ndaughter of France.\r\n\r\n[239] _Gesta_, i. 343, 344; date from R.

In\r\nmy _Angevin Kings_ I adopted Rigord’s date, but I now recognize that\r\nthis was an error, and that the editors of Vic and Vaissète are right\r\nin following William the Breton, who (ed. Delaborde, i. 187) places\r\nthe expedition “a short time after” (_modico post elapso tempore_) a\r\ncouncil which according to Rigord (_ib._, 84) was held at Paris in\r\nMarch. Otherwise there would not have been time for all the captures,\r\nnegotiations, etc. “Toulouse” here evidently means the county of\r\nToulouse proper; the Quercy was already in Richard’s hands, annexed\r\nby him to his ducal domains in 1186.\r\n\r\n[280] Rigord, 90; cf.

It is noticeable that the Angevin princes\r\nare at this period always represented as describing their Toulousan\r\nrival only by his ancestral title derived from the little county of\r\nS.

William the Breton in his _Philippis_, lib.\r\niii. ll. 410-624, gives a much longer account of this affair, with\r\na minute description of the personal struggle between Richard and\r\nWilliam des Barres, and no mention at all of the capture of William.\r\nThere can hardly be a doubt that the English prose writer’s brief\r\nversion is more trustworthy than the French poet-historiographer’s\r\nlengthy elaboration. The latter has, however, one interesting touch;\r\nin ll. 445-6 the poet makes William des Barres say of Richard:\r\n“Rictus agnosco leonum Illius in clypeo.”\r\n\r\n[301] _Gesta_, ii. 46.\r\n\r\n[302] This is an inference from the fact that Philip is said to have\r\ntaken Palluau after the conference in October, _Gesta_, ii. 49.\r\n\r\n[303] _Gesta_, ii. 49.\r\n\r\n[304] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[305] “Fo ordenatz per lor us parlamens ou foron ensems en la marcha\r\nde Torena e de Beiriu, els reis Felips si fetz mains reclams d’en\r\nRichart, dont amdui vengron a grans paraulas e a malas, si qu’en\r\nRichartz lo desmenti el clamet vil recrezen, e sis desfieron e sis\r\npartiron a mal.” _Razo_ of B. de Born’s _sirventes_ “Al dous nous,”\r\nThomas, 69, 70. Cf. Bertrand’s own words in the same _sirventes_, ll.\r\n28-31: “Guerra sens fuoc e sens sanc De rei ni de gran poesta Cui\r\ncoms laidis ne desmenta Non es ges paraula genta.”\r\n\r\n[306] _Gesta_, ii. 49.\r\n\r\n[307] R. Diceto, ii. 57.\r\n\r\n[308] Gerv. Cant., i. 435.\r\n\r\n[309] _Hist. G. le Mar._, ll. 8116-39. This writer’s story is\r\nhere somewhat confused; he gives to the conference a date which\r\nis certainly wrong—“a cluse Pasque, le mardi” (l. 8069), _i. e._,\r\nTuesday, April 18, 1189, instead of November 18, 1188.\r\n\r\n[310] “Proposuit rex Francorum quod ea quae post crucem susceptam\r\nceperat Anglorum regi restitueret, et post, omnia manerent in eo\r\nstatu quo fuerunt ante crucem susceptam.... Comes Pictavorum penitus\r\ncontradixit; sibi quidem videbatur incongruum quod hac servata\r\nconditione Cadurcum redderet et totum comitatum, et alia multa ...\r\npro feodo de Castro Radulfi et de castello de Hissoudun et Crazai,”\r\netc., R. Diceto, ii. 58. The two kings took the Cross in January\r\n1188. The date of Richard’s annexation of the Quercy is not certain,\r\nbut it must be either 1186 or spring 1188. Philip took Châteauroux in\r\nJune 1188; but he had won Issoudun and Graçay in the spring of 1187,\r\ntherefore these two places would not be included in a restoration\r\nof “ea quae post crucem susceptam ceperat.” The only possible\r\nexplanation of the discrepancy seems to be that Ralph de Diceto\r\nmomentarily confused the conference at which Philip and Henry took\r\nthe Cross, at Gisors in January 1188, with their meeting at the same\r\nplace on March 10, 1186.\r\n\r\n[311] Cf. R. Diceto, ii. 58, Rigord, 92, 93, Gerv. Cant., i. 435,\r\nand _Gesta_, ii. 50. The biographer of William the Marshal gives\r\n(ll. 8089-175) a somewhat different account of the conference; he\r\nsays nothing of any request made there by Richard to his father,\r\nbut represents Philip as urging Henry to increase Richard’s actual\r\npossessions by giving him Anjou, Touraine, and Maine, and asserts\r\nthat before the conference Philip had won Richard over to him by\r\npromising “qu’il li dorreit en demeine” those three counties, and\r\nRichard had privately done him homage for them. If we accept this\r\nstory, we must regard the whole conduct not only of Philip but also\r\nof Richard at Bonmoulins as a piece of utterly shameless acting,\r\nperformed with the deliberate purpose on Richard’s part of breaking\r\nfinally with his father; for no sane person could expect any other\r\nanswer than a refusal to such a request as this. The whole story of\r\nthe relations between Henry, Richard, and Philip is, however, only\r\ntouched upon in a very meagre and perfunctory way by the Marshal’s\r\nbiographer, whose subject it did not directly concern, and who\r\nhas almost certainly made one positive mistake with regard to the\r\nBonmoulins conference, in giving it a date which is five months too\r\nlate; I think therefore that the version of Rigord, Ralph de Diceto,\r\nand Gervase of Canterbury is to be in every way preferred to his.\r\n\r\n[312] R.

Cf. _Gesta_, ii. 67, where Maletable—“Malum Stabulum”—is probably\r\na mistake for Bonnétable, about half way between La Ferté and\r\nBeaumont. The Marshal’s biographer (ll. 8362-68), like the _Gesta_,\r\ndoes not mention Richard, and names only three castles as falling\r\ninto Philip’s hands—La Ferté, Ballon, and “Montfort le Retrot, qui\r\ngaires n’ert fort, E li fust tantost rendu, Unques ne fust defendu.”\r\nHe, however, certainly knew of Richard’s presence with the French\r\nhost, for we shall see that he expressly mentions him as engaged\r\nin the pursuit from Le Mans on June 12. If Beaumont was given up\r\nwithout resistance, its constable, not its owner the viscount, was\r\nprobably answerable for the surrender, since it was at another of\r\nthe viscount’s castles, La Frênaye, that Henry found shelter soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n[343] _Gesta_, ii. 67.\r\n\r\n[344] Cf. _Hist.

G. le Mar._, ll. 9350-1, says Richard bade the\r\nenvoys themselves “Si pernez garde de ma terre E de trestot mon autre\r\nafaire”; but the English chroniclers know nothing of this, and one\r\nof them distinctly asserts that Eleanor was made regent: “Alienor\r\nregina ... statuendi quae vellet in regno potestatem accepit a\r\nfilio. Datum siquidem est in mandatis regni principibus et quasi sub\r\nedicto generali statutum ut ad reginae nutum omnia disponerentur.”\r\nR. Diceto, ii. 66. (This passage is immediately followed by the one\r\nabout “aquila rupti fœderis.”) Cf. _Gesta_, 74.\r\n\r\n[363] _Hist. G. le Mar._, ll. 9361-408. Châteauroux, it will be\r\nremembered, had been in Philip’s hands since June 1187.\r\n\r\n[364] His very identity is a puzzle; under Henry II we read of\r\nStephen de Matha, Stephen de Marzay, Stephen of Turnham, and Stephen\r\n“de Turonis,” all bearing the title of “Seneschal of Anjou,” and it\r\nis doubtful whether or not all these names represent the same man. In\r\nthe passage now before us the _Gesta_ (71) call him “de Turonis,” but\r\nit is clear from other evidence that this means Turnham, not Tours.\r\nThe _Gesta_ continue (71, 72): “Et uxorem filii praedicti Stephani\r\npropter ignobilitatem mariti ab ipso separari fecit [rex] et alii\r\nmarito dari; minans se hujusmodi nobilium puellarum vel viduarum cum\r\nignobilibus contubernia sua auctoritate secundum leges separare.” Is\r\nit possible that Stephen’s crime consisted in having contrived or\r\nconnived at a ceremony of marriage, without licence from the Crown,\r\nbetween his son and some royal ward who had been committed to his\r\ncustody? Such a marriage, if merely formal and if the parties were\r\nunder age, might be voidable by a sentence of the king. According to\r\nR. Devizes, 6, 7 (ed. Stevenson), Richard brought Stephen over with\r\nhim, in chains, to England, and kept him in prison at Winchester till\r\nhe redeemed himself by a heavy fine. This fine may have been either\r\nfor the misdemeanour which I have suggested, or in remission of a vow\r\nof Crusade—which vow, however, Stephen fulfilled after all.\r\n\r\n[365] _Gesta_, 72.\r\n\r\n[366] Gerv.

G. le\r\nMar._, ll. 9173-200. Of course we must remember that Richard himself\r\nhad emptied that treasury two years before. This again implies that\r\nhe was at that time short of money in Aquitaine, and therefore not\r\nlikely to have since then accumulated anything in the way of a\r\nreserve fund there.\r\n\r\n[397] _Gesta_, 76, 77; R.

Howden, iii. xxv, note 4. The greater part of\r\nthis sum was derived from the miscellaneous profits, which were\r\nliable to fluctuation. The £500-£600 worth of other lands given to\r\nJohn would no doubt insure that this fluctuation should not reduce\r\nJohn’s total annual income from his English possessions (irrespective\r\nof his Gloucester earldom and honour) below £4000. Stubbs (_l.c._,\r\nxxiv, note 2) thought that “this promise of £4000 a year in land was\r\nnot regarded as fulfilled by the bestowal of the counties.... We\r\nfind that in 1195 when John had been removed from the government of\r\nthe counties, his income from the Exchequer was £8000 (Howden, iii.\r\n286), but ... in Angevin money and only equal to £2000 sterling.”\r\nHowden’s words in the place here cited are “Eodem anno Ricardus rex\r\nAngliae remisit Johanni fratri suo omnem iram et malivolentiam suam,\r\net reddidit ei comitatum de Moretonia et honorem de Eia, et comitatum\r\nGlocestriae, cum omni integritate eorum, exceptis castellis; et pro\r\nomnibus aliis comitatibus et terris suis dedit ei rex per annum\r\nocto millia librarum Andegavensis monetae.” To me these words seem\r\nto imply nothing definite as to the relative value of the counties\r\nand other lands of which John had been deprived and of the money\r\ncompensation given to him in their stead in 1195. Nor does Bishop\r\nStubbs’s further remark, “However, it is clear that whilst he was\r\nin charge of the counties he was receiving a large sum from the\r\nExchequer; R. Devizes, 26,” seem to me borne out by the passage to\r\nwhich he here gives a reference, and which runs thus: “Colloquium\r\nprimum inter comitem de Moretonio, fratrem regis, et cancellarium,\r\nde custodiis quorumdam castellorum et de pecunia comiti a fratre de\r\nscaccario concessa, apud Wintoniam ad Laetare Hierusalem” (_i. e._,\r\nMarch 4, 1191).\r\n\r\n[418] Or Geddington; R. Diceto, ii. 69.

Henricus rex per novas cartas et per\r\ncaptionem suam” (_i. e._, Willelmi) “extorsit.”\r\n\r\n[436] William had been captured, with some sixty of his men, when\r\nthe bulk of the force with which he was besieging Alnwick was out of\r\nreach, by a body of several hundred English knights who had ridden to\r\nthe place through a thick mist which prevented them from seeing where\r\nthey were and the Scots from discovering their approach till a sudden\r\nclearing of the air surprised both parties alike by revealing their\r\npresence to each other, and the little band of Scots, though they\r\nmade a splendid fight, were easily surrounded. W. Newb., lib. ii. c.\r\n33; Jordan Fantosme, ll. 1731-1839.\r\n\r\n[437] This is the date of Richard’s charter as printed from an\r\noriginal copy in _Fœdera_, I. i. 50. “He,” says Richard, “became our\r\nliegeman for all the lands for which his ancestors were liegemen of\r\nour ancestors, and he swore fealty to us and our heirs.” See also\r\n_Gesta_, 104.\r\n\r\n[438] _Gesta_, 100.\r\n\r\n[439] R. Diceto, ii. 73, makes the date December 14 and the\r\nlanding-place Gravelines; the _Gesta_ writer, 101, says “xi^o die\r\nDecembris, in vigilia S. Luciae,” which is self-contradictory, S.\r\nLucy’s day being December 13. For “in vigilia S. Luciae” Roger of\r\nHowden (iii. 28) substitutes “feria secunda,” which would be right\r\nfor December 11, 1189. Both these latter writers say that Richard\r\nlanded at Calais, and that the Count of Flanders met him on his\r\nlanding and escorted him “cum gaudio” into Normandy.\r\n\r\n[440] At Bures, according to _Gesta_, 104; at Lions, according to\r\n_Itin._, 145.\r\n\r\n[441] _Est. de la Guerre Ste._, ll. 247-50.\r\n\r\n[442] The proclamation inserted by R. Diceto, ii. 73, 74, is dated\r\nNonancourt, December 30; the _Gesta_, 104, places the meeting at the\r\nFord of S. Rémi. This was the usual place for conferences, and is\r\nclose to Nonancourt.\r\n\r\n[443] The _Gesta_, 105, and R. Diceto, ii. 74, say that S. John\r\nBaptist’s day was the date fixed at the second conference, which was\r\nheld on January 13 (_Gesta_, _l.c._). R. Diceto, however, elsewhere\r\n(ii. 77) gives Midsummer as the date fixed at the third conference,\r\nwhich he says took place on the day on which the Queen of France\r\ndied, or was buried; it is not clear which he means. She died on\r\nMarch 15; Rigord, 97. This is clearly the conference at which the\r\n_Estoire_, ll. 259-86, and _Itin._ 146, tell us the kings received\r\nthe news of her death (she died unexpectedly, in childbirth), and\r\nagreed to set out each from his own dominions on S. John Baptist’s\r\nday and meet at Vézelay for the final start together on the octave.\r\nThe _Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_ place this conference “at Dreux.”\r\nRichard was at Nonancourt on March 14 (_Fœdera_, I. i. 51); the Gué\r\nSt. Rémi is midway between these two towns and was no doubt the real\r\nmeeting-place.\r\n\r\n[444] _Gallia Christ._, i. 988.\r\n\r\n[445] Richard, _Comtes._, ii. 263.\r\n\r\n[446] R. Diceto, ii. 73. R. Coggeshall, 26, says December 12, but\r\nthere are several indications that Mandeville was dead before Richard\r\nleft England.\r\n\r\n[447] _Gesta_, 101. Roger of Howden, iii. 28, says: “Hugo Dunelmensis\r\net Willelmus Eliensis Episcopi remanserunt in Anglia summi\r\njusticiarii”; but the _Gesta_ and R. Devizes (11) distinctly imply\r\nthat at this time William of Ely, though practically viceroy, was\r\nnot titularly chief justiciar. He was, however, added to the number\r\nof assistant justiciars (_Gesta_, _l.c._), and probably this is what\r\nRoger really means.\r\n\r\n[448] _Gesta_, 105, 106. R. Howden, iii. 32.\r\n\r\n[449] _Gesta_, 106.\r\n\r\n[450] After March 27; see _Fœdera_, I. i. 51.\r\n\r\n[451] _Gesta_, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[452] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[453] R. Howden, iii. 8.\r\n\r\n[454] There is one rather curious-looking case of a ship which the\r\nking seems to have originally bought for £100, given to the Knights\r\nof the Hospital (in England), and bought back from them for £9.\r\nArcher, _Crusade of Richard I_, 13. But I do not feel quite sure of\r\nthe meaning of the passage.\r\n\r\n[455] See extract from Pipe Roll 2 Ric. II in Archer, _Crusade of\r\nRichard I_, 11-13. A captain’s pay was double that of a common\r\nsailor; _ib._ The total of ships enumerated in this passage,\r\nexclusive of smacks, whose number is not given, is forty-seven. The\r\ntotal of the fleet when it set out was 107 or 108 “besides some\r\nothers which followed”: _Est._, ll. 311-13, _Itin._ 47.\r\n\r\n[456] _Gesta_, 110, 111; R. Howden, iii. 36, 37. These ordinances are\r\ndated “apud Chinonem.” As in both the writers who record them they\r\nare inserted after some events which took place in England in June,\r\nand as Richard is known, from several sources, to have been at Chinon\r\non June 20, this is the date usually assigned for their issue. But\r\nit cannot be correct; for both our authorities say that the fleet\r\nsailed “statim post Pascha” (March 25), and that a part of it entered\r\nthe Bay of Biscay on Ascension day (May 6); _Gesta_, 116; R. Howden,\r\niii. 42. These ordinances, and the sailing order issued at the same\r\ntime with them, must therefore have been issued before Easter. We\r\nhave seen that Richard met Philip on the Norman border on March 15,\r\nthe Thursday before Palm Sunday; after that, we have no notice of his\r\nwhereabouts till April 17, when he was at Chinon (Richard, _Comtes_,\r\nii. 263, 264). In all likelihood he had been there for a month,\r\nalmost ever since his meeting with Philip.\r\n\r\n[457] _Gesta_, 111, 116. The _Itin._, 147, and _Est._, ll. 307-10,\r\nrepresent this order for immediate departure as issued much later\r\nstill, from Tours, just before the king himself set out thence for\r\nVézelay, _i. e._, at the end of June; but as has been shown in the\r\npreceding note, this is quite incompatible with the date at which the\r\nfleet actually sailed.\r\n\r\n[458] Endowment charter, dated Luçon, May 5 (1190); witnesses, Peter\r\nBertin, seneschal of Poitou (appointed not before February 21, 1190,\r\nRichard, _Comtes_, ii. 263, 265), Stephen de Marzay, Brother Miles\r\nthe duke’s almoner, Ralf FitzGeoffrey his chamberlain, and John of\r\nAlençon his vice-chancellor, who sealed the deed.

The earlier queen referred to is there called\r\nMatilda, but as the writer calls Stephen’s wife “Alicia,” it is\r\npossible that he has reversed the names and that the other queen whom\r\nhe intended to mention was not Maud of Scotland but Henry’s second\r\nwife, Adeliza of Louvain.\r\n\r\n[460] “Gourfaille, canton de Pissotte, Vendée,” Richard, _Comtes_,\r\n_l.c._, from _Archives du Poitou_, i. 120.\r\n\r\n[461] _Gall.

Diceto, ii. 83.\r\n\r\n[463] R. Howden, iii. 35. Roger calls this man William of “Chisi”;\r\nRichard, _Comtes_, ii. 263, says “Chis, Hautes Pyrénées,” and seems\r\nto date this expedition earlier, between February 21 and April 17;\r\nbut he gives no reason for so doing, and it seems therefore better to\r\naccept the sequence of events given by Roger, with which Richard’s\r\npresence at Bayonne on June 6 fits in very well.\r\n\r\n[464] Stapleton, _Norm. Exch. Rolls_, i. cxlv.\r\n\r\n[465] R. Devizes, 15.\r\n\r\n[466] R. Howden, iii. 36—miscalling the archbishop “William” as usual.\r\n\r\n[467] _Ib._, 37. There is documentary evidence of Richard’s presence\r\nat Tours on June 27, 1190; Teulet, _Layettes_, i. 158. Probably he\r\nwas there several days earlier, as otherwise Philip would hardly have\r\nhad time to visit him there and then go to Paris before setting out\r\nfor Vézelay.\r\n\r\n[468] _Est._, ll. 324-34.\r\n\r\n[469] On June 27 Richard went from Tours to Montrichard (_Fœdera_, I.\r\ni. 48) by way of Azay (on the Cher, close to Tours); _Itin._, 149.\r\nIn the next four days he passed through Selles (on the Cher) and La\r\nChapelle [d’Anguillon, in Berry] to Donzy, in the Nivernais (_Itin._,\r\n_l.c._), where he was on July 1 (_Fœdera_, _l.c._). He may have gone\r\nfrom Donzy to Vézelay on that day. He was certainly at Vézelay on\r\nJuly 3 (_Monast._ VI. i. 327). Rigord (i. 99) says: “Feria quarta\r\npost octavas S. Johannis Baptistae” [= Wednesday, July 4] “cum rege\r\nAnglorum Ricardo apud Vizeliacum venit [rex Francorum],” which looks\r\nas if the kings had met on the way and arrived together; but if so,\r\nRigord’s date is, as we have just seen, at least a day too late. The\r\n_Gesta Ric._ (111) say the two kings stayed at Vézelay two days,\r\nand the _Itinerarium_ (151) enumerates seven places through which\r\nthey passed “distinctis dietis” from there to Lyons (M. Gaston Paris\r\naccepts this passage in the _Itinerarium_ as authentic, believing\r\nit to be derived “from an official source”). This would mean their\r\nleaving Vézelay on July 6 and reaching Lyons on the 13th; but from\r\ncertain words in the _Gesta_ it seems possible, and I think even\r\nprobable, that the true dates are the 3rd and the 10th. The whole\r\nsentence in the _Gesta_ runs thus: “Ibi [sc. apud Vizeliacum] moram\r\nfecerunt [reges] per duos dies _in octavis S. Iohannis Baptistae_.”\r\nStrictly interpreted, this should mean “within the octave”; it might\r\nmean “beginning on the octave,” _i. e._, July 1-3; but it cannot\r\ncorrectly represent July 4-6. Either it is a blunder, or Rigord is\r\nwrong in dating Philip’s arrival on the 4th. I venture to think\r\nthe latter alternative the likelier of the two, as the English\r\nchroniclers appear to have followed their sovereign’s travels with\r\ngreat care, while Rigord is certainly far from being a specially\r\naccurate chronologist.\r\n\r\n[470] _Est._, ll. 365-75; _Itin._, 150.\r\n\r\n[471] _Gesta_, 111.\r\n\r\n[472] _Est._, ll. 377-8.\r\n\r\n[473] The stages are given in _Itin._ 151.

The\r\nauthor of the _Itinerarium_ enumerates (153) fifteen places which he\r\nsays “_we_ went through” (_transivimus_) from Lyons to Marseille;\r\nbut he does not (as in his account of the journey from Vézelay to\r\nLyons) specify how many days’ travelling these stages represent;\r\nand moreover, he is evidently here not describing Richard’s journey\r\nat all, for he ends “apud Marsiliam, ubi moram fecimus per tres\r\nhebdomadas; postea mare intravimus, scilicet die proxima post\r\nfestum Assumptionis Beatae Mariae,” _i. e._, August 16; that is, he\r\nrepresents himself as having reached Marseille on July 26. Supposing\r\nhis narrative to be authentic, he must therefore have travelled from\r\nLyons to Marseille not with the king, but in advance of him. On the\r\nother hand, if he was an impostor and not a Crusader at all, his\r\nevidence on this point is of no account. In either case, however, it\r\nis probable that the route he gives would occupy about a fortnight;\r\nRichard may therefore have set out from Lyons on July 17 or 18.\r\n\r\n[485] R.

This is quite in accord with the character of Richard, who\r\nas we shall see later was in the habit of doing his own scouting;\r\nand the attack could hardly have been so successful unless some\r\npreparations for it had been made beforehand. Still, as the writer\r\nof the _Itinerarium_ does not in this part of his work speak as\r\nan eye-witness, and the one writer who does so speak—Ambrose—does\r\nnot give this detail, I prefer to place it only in a footnote.\r\nRichard of Devizes, 23, says the town gates were broken down “admoto\r\nariete dicto citius.” But he was certainly not there, and his whole\r\naccount of the doings at Messina is too full of long speeches to be\r\naltogether trustworthy.\r\n\r\n[533] “Plus tost eurent il pris Meschines C’uns prestres n’ad dit ses\r\nmatines,” _Est._, ll. 809, 810.

Rigord (106), on the\r\nother hand, declares it was “thanks to King Philip’s intervention and\r\nefforts” that Tancred and Richard were reconciled—which is perhaps\r\ntrue in a sense, but not the sense in which Philip’s panegyrist meant\r\nit—and complains that of the forty thousand ounces of gold Philip\r\n“had only the third part, when he ought to have had half.”\r\n\r\n[558] _Gesta_, 129-32.\r\n\r\n[559] _Est._, ll. 1053-74; _Itin._, 171, 172. In the printed edition\r\nof the _Estoire_, line 1062 reads thus: “Richarz qui n’est aver\r\nne chinches.” If _est_ be really the reading of the MS., it of\r\ncourse places beyond all doubt the correctness of M. Gaston Paris’s\r\nassertion that the poet “a certainement écrit avant la mort de\r\nRichard” (introd., p. 1.). But M. Paris does not cite this line in\r\nsupport of his assertion, and in his modern French version of the\r\npoem he renders the line “Richard, qui _n’était_ pas chiche ni avare”\r\n(p. 347). We are therefore at present left in doubt whether _n’est_\r\nbe not here a misprint for _n’ert_.\r\n\r\n[560] _Gesta_, 157.\r\n\r\n[561] _Ib._, 146, 147.\r\n\r\n[562] _Est._, ll. 1080-1108; cf. _Gesta_, 150.\r\n\r\n[563] _Gesta_, 150, 151.\r\n\r\n[564] See above, p. 79.\r\n\r\n[565] _Gesta_, 155-7.\r\n\r\n[566] Rigord, 107.\r\n\r\n[567] _Est._, ll. 1145-8.\r\n\r\n[568] _Gesta_, 157; they are there said to have gone to Brindisi.\r\nFebruary 27 that year was Ash Wednesday; possibly Richard had hoped\r\nthey would arrive in time for the marriage to take place before Lent.\r\n\r\n[569] Rigord, 107.\r\n\r\n[570] So says _Itin._, 170, 171; in the _Gesta_, 158, he is said to\r\nhave gone “per consilium regis Franciae,” which from the sequel does\r\nnot seem very likely.\r\n\r\n[571] _Gesta_, 158, 159.\r\n\r\n[572] _Ib._, 159, 160.\r\n\r\n[573] Charter of Philip, in _Fœdera_, I. i. 54, dated “March 1190,”\r\nthe French year beginning on Lady day.\r\n\r\n[574] “Tertio kalendas Aprilis, sabbato,” _Gesta_, 161; “die Sabbati\r\npost Annunciationem B.

In p. 177, however, the author of the _Itinerarium_ says\r\nRichard sailed on the seventeenth day after Philip’s departure;\r\nwhich, as all authorities (this same writer included, _l.c._) date\r\nRichard’s departure from Messina on the Wednesday before Easter, _i.\r\ne._, April 10, ought to mean that Philip sailed on Lady day itself.\r\nR. Diceto, ii. 91, makes him sail “quarto kalendas Aprilis,” _i. e._,\r\nMarch 29; or, according to another MS., “tertio kalendas Aprilis,”\r\nagreeing with _Gesta_. This latter authority says (161) that Philip\r\nreached Acre on the twenty-second day of his voyage, viz. Saturday in\r\nEaster week, _i. e._, April 20.

Diceto, _l.c._,\r\nmentions among the contents of the ship “serpentium ignitorum plena\r\nvasa plurima”; I have thought it right to adopt the interpretation of\r\nthe “serpents” which these words imply, although a curious question\r\nseems to be suggested by comparing the story with an account in the\r\n_Morning Post_ of August 14, 1914, of a captured German liner whose\r\ncargo is there said to have included “about sixty alligators and\r\nreptiles.”\r\n\r\n[637] Bohadin, 221.\r\n\r\n[638] _Est._, ll. 2194-5.\r\n\r\n[639] Bohadin, 221.\r\n\r\n[640] _Est._, ll. 2305-8.\r\n\r\n[641] _Gesta_, 168; R.

Bohadin’s date, June 11 (p.\r\n220), is impossible. Ambrose goes on to say that after the wind\r\nchanged the king “jut devant Sor cil nuitie” (l. 2308); for which\r\nthe _Itin._ has “proxima nocte ante Tyrum fixis anchoris classis\r\npersistebat” (p. 210).\r\n\r\n[642] _Est._, ll. 2309-12.\r\n\r\n[643] Ibn Djobeïr, _Recueil, Hist.

Even Rigord does not go so far as this. It is certain that\r\nPhilip got his due share of the prisoners; and there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that he also got, as the English writers say, his due share of\r\nthe city and its contents.\r\n\r\n[703] _Gesta_, 182, 183.\r\n\r\n[704] _Ib._, 184; _Est._, ll. 5050-61; _Itin._, 235, 236.\r\n\r\n[705] _Gesta_, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[706] _Itin._, 236.\r\n\r\n[707] _Gesta_, _l.c._; _Est._, ll. 5054, 5055.\r\n\r\n[708] _Gesta_, _l.c._; _Est._, ll. 5056, 5057, 5062, 5063; _Itin._,\r\n235.

This would be\r\nthe fortieth day from the surrender—which is what the writer of the\r\n_Gesta_ asserts in p. 179 to have been the term originally fixed for\r\npayment of the whole ransom. Evidently he is correct in his implied\r\ndate, and wrong only in his mode of arriving at it.\r\n\r\n[731] _Gesta_, 188, 189. “Sui cum eo” in p. 189 must surely be an\r\nerror for either “sui cum me,” or, much more probably, “mei cum eo.”\r\n\r\n[732] The _Est._, ll. 5613-46. and _Itin._, 245, place Richard’s\r\nencampment outside the walls and the skirmish or skirmishes which\r\nfollowed it after the slaughter of the garrison, _i. e._ after\r\nAugust 20. But the whole narrative of the surrender of Acre and\r\nthe proceedings there is in the _Gesta_ arranged with such minute\r\nchronological order that it can hardly fail to be founded on\r\ndocumentary authority so far as its dates are concerned, while the\r\nchronology of both _Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_, just at this period,\r\nis vague and confused in the extreme.\r\n\r\n[733] Bohadin, 242, 243; cf. _Gesta_, 189; R.

Howden, iii. 131.\r\n\r\n[735] Bohadin, 243. As to the way in which the Frank soldiers had\r\ntreated the corpses, the statements in _Gesta_, 189 (copied in R.\r\nHowden, iii. 128) must be compared with Bohadin, _l.c._, whence it\r\nappears, first, that whatever was done to the bodies did not shock\r\nhim, for he makes no comment on it; and secondly, that the Saracens\r\nwho went to look at them next morning could quite well have taken\r\nthem away then, if they had chosen to do so.\r\n\r\n[736] Bohadin, 242.\r\n\r\n[737] “Quibus sub hac conditione vita concessa est, si Saladinus pro\r\nredemptione eorum 70,000 bisantiorum dare vellet,” R.

Devizes, 51.\r\n\r\n[738] _Gesta_, 179, followed by R. Howden, iii. 121.\r\n\r\n[739] See the curious statement in a letter written about this time\r\nby El-Fadhel, one of Saladin’s secretaries, to the Divan at Bagdad:\r\n“The number of barbaric tongues among these people from the west is\r\noutrageous, and outdoes everything that can be imagined. Sometimes,\r\nwhen we take a prisoner, we can only communicate with him through a\r\nseries of interpreters—one translates the Frank’s words to another,\r\nwho translates them again to a third.” Abu Shama, _Hist. des Crois._,\r\niv. 15.\r\n\r\n[740] “Si fud la chose esguardee A un concile ou assemblerent Li\r\nhalt home, qui esguarderent Que des Sarazins ocireient Le plus,”\r\netc., _Est._, ll. 5524-7; cf. _Itin._, 243. The _Gesta_, 189, and R.\r\nHowden, iii. 128, say expressly that the duke of Burgundy caused the\r\nFrench king’s share of the prisoners to be slaughtered likewise.\r\n\r\n[741] “E dont furent li cop vengie De quarels d’arbaleste a tor, Les\r\ngranz merciz al Creator!” _Est._, ll. 5540-2; cf. _Itin._, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[742] Extract from Imad-ed-Din, in Abu Shama, _Hist. des Crois._,\r\niv. 277, 278. It is probably to this that Bohadin alludes when he\r\nspeaks of “reprisals” as one of the motives to which the massacre at\r\nAcre was attributed; and it is he who adds (p. 243) that it was also\r\nascribed to Richard’s sense of the risk of leaving so many prisoners\r\nbehind him. The story told in the _Gesta_, 189, and R. Howden, iii.\r\n127, that Saladin had wantonly provoked the retaliation by beheading\r\non August 18 all the Christian prisoners who should have been\r\nexchanged for his own men next day, is obviously a fiction; and it is\r\nclear that the leaders of the host were not even misled by a false\r\nreport, for the _Estoire_ and the _Itinerarium_ make no mention of\r\nany such thing.\r\n\r\n[743] _Est._, ll. 5543-5, _Itin._, 244.\r\n\r\n[744] _Est._, ll. 5384-7; _Itin._, 240; cf.

Bohadin, 244, gives the date\r\nof the departure, 29 Rajab (= Thursday, August 22).\r\n\r\n[749] _Est._, ll. 5677-702; _Itin._, 248.\r\n\r\n[750] _Est._, ll. 5704-14; _Itin._, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[751] Bohadin, 244-6.\r\n\r\n[752] This is the date given by the _Est._, ll. 5721-33, and\r\n_Itin._, 249. Bohadin (244), Ibn Alathyr (_Recueil_, II. ii. 48),\r\nand Imad-ed-Din (in Abu Shama, _ib._, iv. 33) say 1 Jaban (= August\r\n24). From this point to the Crusaders’ departure from Caesarea, I\r\nfollow Bohadin’s reckoning for the movements of Saladin, on whom he\r\nwas in attendance, and the reckoning of the two Frank chroniclers\r\nof the Crusade (the writers of _Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_) for\r\nthe movements of the host, of which one of them is universally\r\nacknowledged to have been a member, and I personally believe the\r\nother to have been so likewise. We shall find that from August 30 to\r\nSeptember 6, 1191, Bohadin’s dates are confused; a like confusion may\r\nhave affected them for the whole period from August 24, but of this\r\nwe cannot be sure.\r\n\r\n[753] _Est._, ll. 5751-95; _Itin._, 249-51; cf. Bohadin, 244-5.\r\n\r\n[754] _Itin._, 251.\r\n\r\n[755] _Est._, ll. 5800-60; _Itin._, 251-2.\r\n\r\n[756] The difficulty is complicated by the contradictory descriptions\r\nof the site in _Est._, ll. 5889-90, and 5935, and in _Itin._, 253,\r\n254. The present native name of Athlit is Khirbet Dustrey. One is\r\ntempted to suggest that “Destreitz” might be an attempt to reproduce\r\nthe sound of, and give a meaning to, this native appellation; but\r\nas an Arabic scholar has been good enough to answer a question on\r\nthe subject by informing me that “it is quite impossible to trace\r\nthe word Dustrey” in that language, one is driven to conclude that\r\nthe corruption has taken place in the opposite direction, and that\r\n“Dustrey” is a modern Arab form of the old French “Destreitz” (Latin\r\n“Districtum).”\r\n\r\n[757] _Est._, ll. 5863-92, 5935-42; _Itin._, 253, 254.\r\n\r\n[758] Bohadin, 245, 246.\r\n\r\n[759] Its Arabic name is Nahr es Zerka, “blue” or “grey river.”\r\n\r\n[760] Bohadin, 247-50.\r\n\r\n[761] _Est._, ll. 5981-4; _Itin._, 256.\r\n\r\n[762] _Est._, ll. 5944-6004; _Itin._, 255-6. The date of the arrival\r\nof the host at Caesarea has to be made out by counting the days’\r\nmarches and halts, as given by these two writers, since the departure\r\nfrom Acre. A question arises whether Ambrose’s “deus jours de\r\nsejour” (l. 5936) at Casal des Destreitz means two whole days and\r\nthree nights, _i. e._, August 27-30, or two nights and one whole day\r\nbesides the day of arrival there, _i. e._, August 27-29. The word in\r\nthe _Itinerarium_—“biduo”—does not help to a decision; but Bohadin\r\ndoes help, though indirectly. He says (250) the Franks reached\r\nCaesarea on “Friday 6 Jaban.” This date is self-contradictory; the 6\r\nJaban (= August 29) was Thursday, and from this point to 14 Jaban (=\r\nSeptember 6) all Bohadin’s days of the week are one day in advance\r\nof his days of the month. On reaching the last date of the series,\r\nhowever, we shall find from other evidence that the day of the week,\r\nnot that of the month, is the correct one all through; therefore the\r\n“two days” are to be taken in the widest sense, and the entry into\r\nCaesarea was on Friday, August 30.\r\n\r\n[763] Bohadin, 250, 251; for the date, which he gives as 8 Jaban (=\r\nAugust 31), see preceding note. Imad-ed-Din, in Abu Shama, 34, gives\r\nit correctly, 9 Jaban = September 1.\r\n\r\n[764] Bohadin, 251, 252.\r\n\r\n[765] Bohadin, 253.\r\n\r\n[766] _Est._, ll. 6039-46; _Itin._, 257.\r\n\r\n[767] Bohadin, 255.\r\n\r\n[768] _Est._, ll. 6047-64; _Itin._, 258. Oddly enough, Richard soon\r\nafterwards forgot the date of his own wound, for in a letter inserted\r\nin R. Howden, iii. 130, he says it occurred on the third day before\r\nSaladin’s defeat (at Arsuf), _i. e._ on September 5. We shall see\r\nthat this date is impossible, because on September 5 there was no\r\nfighting at all.\r\n\r\n[769] _Est._, ll. 6071-90; _Itin._, 258, 259.\r\n\r\n[770] Bohadin, 255-7.\r\n\r\n[771] _Est._, ll. 6092-111; _Itin._, 259. Bohadin, 257, describes the\r\nsite as “a place called Birka” (the Pond, or Marsh), “whence the sea\r\nwas visible.” It is probably one of the streamlets which, when not\r\ndried up or choked up with sand, run into the Nahr el Falik, a little\r\ncreek about eight miles south of the mouth of the Salt River.\r\n\r\n[772] _Est._, ll. 6114-17; _Itin._, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[773] Bohadin, 258, calls it “Saturday 14 Jaban” (= September 6), but\r\nall the Frank writers show that the date of the battle was really\r\nSaturday September 7 = 15 Jaban.\r\n\r\n[774] _Est._, ll. 6191-4, 6204-8; _Itin._, 261.\r\n\r\n[775] Cf.

Arabic geographical lexicon which gives the name thus.\r\nIt is better known in the corrupt form Latroun. The place seems to\r\nbe identical with a ruined castle which the Christian inhabitants of\r\nthe land told early pilgrims was the abode of the Penitent Thief.\r\nThis raises a question whether the story was derived from Alatroun\r\nby way of _Latroun_ and _latro_, or _latro_ gave rise to Alatroun.\r\nQuatremère inclines to the latter view.\r\n\r\n[806] Bohadin, 270, 271.\r\n\r\n[807] On October 13; Bohadin, 273.\r\n\r\n[808] _Est._, ll. 7067-82; _Itin._, 286.\r\n\r\n[809] Cf. _Est._, ll. 7075-7, with Bohadin, 279, who says some\r\nFrankish ships with, “it was said,” five hundred men on board were\r\ncaptured by the Turkish fleet on October 26.\r\n\r\n[810] _Itin._, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[811] _Est._, ll. 7083-175; _Itin._, 286-8.\r\n\r\n[812] Bohadin, 274, 275.\r\n\r\n[813] Bohadin, 277-80.\r\n\r\n[814] _Itin._, 289.\r\n\r\n[815] _Est._, ll. 7207-32; _Itin._, 290.\r\n\r\n[816] “Car si a vos mescheiet E qui issi fust escheiet, Cristente\r\nsereit tuee,” _Est._, ll. 7341-3.\r\n\r\n[817] _Est._, ll. 7233-66; _Itin._, 291-4.\r\n\r\n[818] Bohadin, 284, 285.\r\n\r\n[819] _Ib._, 286.\r\n\r\n[820] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[821] _Itin._, 296.\r\n\r\n[822] Bohadin, _l.c._; cf.

But evidently this is impossible; it\r\nmust mean 21 Shawal = November 11.\r\n\r\n[826] Bohadin, 287-91. The accounts of these negotiations given\r\nin _Est._, ll. 7370-428, and _Itin._, 295-7, are obviously less\r\ntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n[827] Bohadin, 292, says he went to Tell el Jezer, _i. e._ “the Hill\r\nof the Bridge,” Stubbs, note 1 to _Itin._, 298; possibly a bridge\r\nover the little river that runs through the Wady Ali, between Natroun\r\nand Amwas. The Frank chroniclers say he went “dreit al Toron as\r\nChevalers,” _i. e._ Natroun, _Est._, ll. 7456-62; “versus Darum,”\r\n_Itin._, 298. Stubbs in a note suggested that “Darum” here was a\r\nphonetic error for “Toron”; this the _Estoire_ practically proves;\r\nand I venture to think the passage furnishes a little bit of evidence\r\non another question, for if the Latin “translator” had “al Toron\r\nas Chevalers” before his eyes, how came he to misrender it “versus\r\nDarum”? whereas if Ambrose found “Darum” in his friend’s notes, and\r\nnoticed that it was a mistake, he would of course correct it in his\r\nown version of the story.\r\n\r\n[828] See Note III at end.\r\n\r\n[829] _Est._, ll. 7429-41; cf. _Itin._, 297.\r\n\r\n[830] _Est._, ll. 7471-6; cf. _Itin._, 298.\r\n\r\n[831] _Est._, ll. 7477-8; _Itin._, 299, “verum non in deliciis.”\r\n\r\n[832] Bohadin, 292.\r\n\r\n[833] The later high road to Jerusalem from Joppa goes by Ramlah, but\r\nnot by Amwas and Beit Nuba; it passes further south, through the Wady\r\nAli.\r\n\r\n[834] _Itin._, 305.\r\n\r\n[835] See, _e. g._, the story of the fight in which the Earl of\r\nLeicester was nearly lost, _Est._, ll. 7480-604, _Itin._, 300-3.\r\n\r\n[836] See Note IV at end.\r\n\r\n[837] Cf.

Howden, iii. 179, who gives the date as S.\r\nHilary’s Day, January 13.

The\r\ncomments on the difficulties in the way of an effective blockade\r\nwhich he ascribes to Richard are almost verbally identical with those\r\nof the Knights as reported in _Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_.\r\n\r\n[847] Ibn Alathyr, _l.c._, 55; _Est._, ll. 7841-2; _Itin._, 310.\r\nThe exact date of the retirement is questionable, owing to the\r\ndoubt as to the date of the council. Ibn Alathyr (_l.c._) says the\r\nhost withdrew from Beit Nuba on 20 Dulheggia = January 8; Abu Shama\r\n(_Recueil_, V. 49) quotes from “_Récit du Cadi_” a statement that the\r\nwithdrawal was on 22 Dulheggia (= January 10), but there is no such\r\nthing in the printed editions of Bohadin. Perhaps Ibn Alathyr and\r\nRoger of Howden may have erred in different ways from making one and\r\nthe same mistake, viz., assuming that the return to Ramlah took place\r\non the same day as the council, which is not necessarily implied in\r\nany of the chronicles, Frank or Mussulman.\r\n\r\n[848] _Est._, ll. 7799-810; _Itin._, 309.\r\n\r\n[849] _Est._, ll. 7811-42; _Itin._, 310.\r\n\r\n[850] Otherwise called Yabneh, Jafna, in older days Jamnia, and,\r\nearlier still, Jabneel (Joshua xv. 2).\r\n\r\n[851] _Est._, ll. 7843-95; _Itin._, 311, 312. Both these writers say\r\nthe host spent a night at Ibelin on its way to Ascalon. Imad-ed-Din\r\n(_apud_ Abu Shama, 51) says “the Franks marched upon Ascalon on 3\r\nMoharrem,” _i. e._ January 20, the date given in _Itin._, 312, as\r\nthat of the arrival there. I venture to think that the difficulty\r\nsuggested by Stubbs (_Itin._, _l.c._, note 2), as to reconciling\r\nthese dates with the statement in _Itin._, 311, that the duke of\r\nBurgundy stayed eight days at the Casal des Plains, is an imaginary\r\none. Those eight days need not be crowded in before the setting out\r\nof the rest of the host; the two parties may have gone in opposite\r\ndirections almost at the same time, since we shall find that they did\r\nnot come together again until several weeks later.\r\n\r\n[852] _Est._ ll. 7967-8077; _Itin._, 315-17.\r\n\r\n[853] “Ipse manibus aedificando,” _Itin._, 317.

The earlier frontier—like the later one—was further to the\r\nsouth-west, and the “river of Egypt” then was the Wady el Arish, or,\r\nearlier still, another stream yet further westward.\r\n\r\n[856] _Est._, ll. 8092-141; cf. _Itin._, 318, 319.\r\n\r\n[857] _Est._, ll. 8143-54; _Itin._, 319, 320.\r\n\r\n[858] _Est._, ll. 5329-50; _Itin._, 239.

William of Newburgh, lib. v. c. 16, and Roger of Wendover,\r\ned. Coxe, iii. 74, 75, give a letter purporting to have been\r\nwritten by the “Old Man” to exculpate Richard from the charge of\r\nhaving contrived Conrad’s death. In William’s version the letter is\r\naddressed “principibus et omni populo Christianae religionis,” and\r\nprofesses to have been written spontaneously; in Roger’s version\r\nit is addressed to Duke Leopold of Austria, and Roger says (though\r\nthe letter itself does not say) that it was written at the request\r\nof Richard during his imprisonment in Germany. William says, “Has\r\n[literas] nimirum se vidisse atque legisse vir fide dignus mihi\r\nprotestatus est cum regi Francorum Parisius constituto solemniter\r\nfuissent oblatae”; he adds that Philip formally accepted the document\r\nas proof of Richard’s innocence; and he dates this transaction 1195.\r\nThe contents of the letter differ slightly in the two versions, but\r\nboth are substantially in agreement with the accounts in Ernoul and\r\nEracle of the circumstances which led to Conrad’s death. The letter\r\nis unquestionably a forgery. It may have been circulated in the East\r\nas well as in the West, and the “ultramarine” chroniclers may have\r\ntaken their story from it; there is, however, also a possibility that\r\nboth they and the composers of the letter—whoever these may have\r\nbeen—all alike derived their information from a genuine source.\r\n\r\n[890] “Li baron de France esteient En lor tentes hors de la vile,\r\nQue haut que bas, plus que dis mile; E li haut ensemble parlerent\r\nE a la marchise manderent Qu’ele lor rendist la citie Trestut en\r\npeis e en quitie En guarde a l’oes le reis de France; E el respondi\r\nsanz dotance Que quant li reis la revendreit Que mult volenters\r\nli rendreit, Si ainz n’i ad autre seignor.” _Est._, ll. 8912-23.\r\nFor the last four lines the _Itinerarium_ (342) has: “Quibus ipsa\r\nrespondit quod quando rex Ricardus ipsam visere veniret, ipsi potius\r\nredderet civitatem et nulli alii, sicut dominus suus moriens ei\r\npraeciperat.” The context in _Estoire_ clearly shows that by “li\r\nreis” in l. 8921 Ambrose meant not Richard but Philip; and it seems\r\nmost likely that this version is the correct one, although Ambrose,\r\nas well as the Latin chronicler, has previously stated that Conrad\r\nwhen dying had bidden Isabel “que la citie ne rendist Fors al cors le\r\nrei d’Engleterre Ou al dreit seignor de la terre” (ll. 8858-64)—“ut\r\ncivitati Tyro conservandae vigilanter intenderet, nec cuiquam hominum\r\nresignaret nisi regi Ricardo sive illi quem regnum jure contingebat\r\nhaereditario,” _Itin._, 340.

Richard and his companions\r\npassed through it on their way back to Ascalon (_Est._, l. 9389,\r\n_Itin._, 356), so its Moslem garrison, if it had had one, had\r\nevidently been withdrawn.\r\n\r\n[908] _Est._, ll. 8369-86; _Itin._, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[909] _Itin._, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[910] _Est._, ll. 9387-94; _Itin._, 356, 357.\r\n\r\n[911] Cf. _Est._, ll. 9395-407, and _Itin._, 357, 358.

Bohadin calls the castle\r\nMejdel Yaba; in Abu Shama’s compilation the name appears as Mejdel\r\nDjenab, but the compiler adds: “This is the name given by El Imad\r\nin the _Book of the Conquest_, but in _The Lightning_ we find\r\n‘Mejdel Yaba’”; while the text of Imad-ed-Din published by Count\r\nLandsberg has “Mejdel el Habab” (footnote to Abu Shama, _l.c._). Of\r\nthese Arabic names only one has been located—Mejdel Yaba, called by\r\nthe Franks Mirabel, which is so far from the Wady el Hesy that it\r\ncannot possibly be the place meant (G. Paris, Glossary to _Estoire_,\r\n_s.v._ “Fiier”). I am indebted to a distinguished Arabic scholar\r\nfor the information that Mejdel Yaba means “Glory of Yaba,” Mejdel\r\nDjenab “Glory of the district,” Mejdel el Habab “Glory of the\r\nlover”; and that the Arabic for Castle of Figs or Figtrees would be\r\nKalat-el-Tinat. It is possible that a place bearing one of the three\r\nformer Arabic names might be called Fig or Figtree Castle by the\r\nFranks for some reason quite independent of its native appellation,\r\nand that the narratives of the Christian and Moslem writers may be\r\nonly two different versions of one event; but there is also another\r\npossibility. Imad-ed-Din dates the disaster of the Franks at Mejdel\r\nDjenab (or Yaba, or El Habab) 14 Jomada I, _i. e._ May 28, the date\r\ngiven by Ambrose and the _Itinerarium_ for the capture of Figtree\r\nCastle; but Bohadin says it occurred “when the host had spent the\r\nfourteenth day of Jomada I” at El Hesy. This should apparently mean\r\nthat it took place on the following day, _i. e._ 15 Jomada I = May\r\n29. To me it seems more probable that this version is the correct\r\none, and that the Frank and the Moslem writers are here relating two\r\ndistinct events, one of which took place on May 28 and the other on\r\nMay 29. If so, it would not be unnatural that of two expeditions made\r\nwithin such a short period, each party should record only the one\r\nwhich terminated in their own favour.\r\n\r\n[914] _Est._, ll. 9433-508; _Itin._, 358-61.\r\n\r\n[915] “E dist a sei: S’or ne retornes, Veirement as terre perdue.”\r\n_Est._, ll. 9464-5.\r\n\r\n[916] Lib. xiv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[917] “Ço fu en juin” (“intrante jam mense Junio,” _Itin._) “Lors\r\ns’esmut l’ost de la Canoie Par mi les plains tut contre val Vers\r\nYbelin de l’Ospital, Joste Ebron,” _Est._, ll. 9509-14; _Itin._, 360.\r\nBohadin places this movement a little earlier; after mentioning an\r\nevent which he dates 17 Jomada I (= May 31) he continues “The enemy\r\nmeanwhile had moved from El Hesy, and was at the diverging-point\r\nof the ways of which one leads to Ascalon, one to Beit Djibrin,\r\nanother to the tents of Islam” (303). Stubbs (note to _Itin._, 360)\r\nsuggests Galatia, in Arabic Keratieh, as the place indicated. As\r\nBohadin frequently antedates by a day or two the movements of the\r\nFranks, he may have done so in this instance. “El Hesy” here, as in a\r\nlater passage, seems to stand for the Wady el Hesy as a whole; thus\r\nincluding of course the Canebrake.\r\n\r\n[918] _Est._, ll. 9519-52; _Itin._, 361.\r\n\r\n[919] _Est._, ll. 9553-680; cf. _Itin._, 361-4.

Such a thing is by no means impossible; but\r\nif it were a fact, it would probably have been known to the Franks,\r\nwhereas it was evidently not known even as a rumour to Ambrose, who\r\nwould surely have made the most of it in his poetic story.\r\n\r\n[945] Bohadin, 306, 307.\r\n\r\n[946] _Itin._, 385-7; cf. _Est._, ll. 10329-421.\r\n\r\n[947] Bohadin, 307, 308.\r\n\r\n[948] Cf.

He calls the day “Tuesday, 11th of Jomada II”;\r\nbut as 11 Jomada II in that year was a Wednesday, it is doubtful\r\nwhether he means Tuesday 10 (= June 23) or Wednesday 11 (= June 24).\r\nThe former is almost certainly the true date. Roger of Howden, iii.\r\n182, says the affair occurred “on the eve of S. John”; Imad-ed-Din,\r\n_apud_ Abu Shama, 55, says the Frank army set out on the night\r\npreceding June 22; the _Estoire_, l. 10304, says it set out “un seir\r\nde diemaine,” which thus seems to have been Sunday June 21; and both\r\n_Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_ clearly indicate that the fight took\r\nplace on the second morning after. Imad-ed-Din, _l.c._, locates it at\r\n“El Hesy”; but we cannot possibly set aside the plain and unanimous\r\ntestimony of Bohadin and the Frank writers as to Kuweilfeh. The\r\nFranks do not mention El Hesy at all on this occasion; Bohadin makes\r\nit clear that both parties passed through that locality on their way.\r\nIt seems plain also that in this case, as in an earlier one, “El\r\nHesy” stands not for the village now so called, but for the Wady, and\r\nmore especially for its western end, or head. In one place the actual\r\nphrase used is “the source of El Hesy” (“la source d’El Hasy,” French\r\nedition of Bohadin, _l.c._; “caput El Hissi,” Schultens’ edition,\r\n232).\r\n\r\n[951] Bohadin, 311-15.\r\n\r\n[952] Cf. Bohadin, 309, _Est._, ll. 10565-75, and _Itin._, 392.\r\nBohadin says they got back to their camp on “Friday, 16 Jomada II,”\r\nwhich is self-contradictory, as 16 Jomada II (= June 26) that year\r\nwas Monday. He may have meant either Monday June 26 or Friday 30; he\r\nmay even have meant both, and confused them together. The indications\r\nin _Estoire_ and _Itinerarium_ are vague, but they seem to imply a\r\ntwo days’ journey from the Round Cistern to Ramlah; thus Ramlah may\r\nhave been reached on the 26th and the “camp” proper, at Beit Nuba, on\r\nthe 30th. Richard seems not to have gone to Beit Nuba at all, but to\r\nhis former quarters at Castle Arnold; R. Coggeshall, 40.\r\n\r\n[953] _Est._, ll. 10576-626; _Itin._, 393, 394.\r\n\r\n[954] _Est._, ll. 10639-64; _Itin._, 394, 395.\r\n\r\n[955] R. Coggeshall, 39, 40. Ralf says Richard caused Saladin’s\r\ncaptured envoys to be shot to death with arrows by his own servants\r\nin the sight of the host, neither portion of it (that is, his own\r\nadherents or those of Burgundy) knowing whence the victims came nor\r\nwhy they were thus slain. It seems hardly possible that Ambrose\r\nshould have omitted to mention so strange an incident if it really\r\nwas seen by the Crusaders of whom he was one. Ralf further represents\r\nHugh as setting out for Acre with his forces immediately, and Richard\r\nwith the rest of the host following next day; whereas Ambrose\r\ndistinctly says that the French quitted Beit Nuba at the same time\r\nas the king (_Est._, ll. 10709-10). The _Itinerarium_, 397, says the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[956] Bohadin, 315.\r\n\r\n[957] “Quatre liues,” _Est._, l. 10690; “quatuor tantum nunc\r\ndistabant millia,” _Itin._, 396. Beit Nuba is about thirteen miles\r\nfrom Jerusalem. Seemingly “liues” and “millia” here must stand for\r\nhours of march, as Stubbs says they often do in Crusade history.\r\n\r\n[958] _Itin._, 376. This passage follows the account of an event\r\nwhich the same writer dates June 17, and other authorities June 16.\r\n\r\n[959] “Par la Porte David estoit la voie qui maine en Belleem. Em mi\r\nvoie estoit une Esglyze ou Seint Elie fu mananz,” _Contin. W. Tyr._,\r\nMS. Rothelin, _Recueil Hist. Occid._, ii. 512. R. Howden, iii. 182,\r\ncalls the place “capellam S. Elyae quae distat a Jerusalem per tres\r\nleucas.” As the distance between Jerusalem and Bethlehem is about\r\nsix miles, Roger must here have used the word _leuca_ as equivalent\r\nto a mile (as the author of the _Itinerarium_ seems to have done\r\nfrequently). On the other hand, there appears to be a mistake in the\r\npassage from the Rothelin MS.; seeing that “David’s Gate” was the\r\nwest gate of Jerusalem, and that Bethlehem lies south of that city,\r\nthe natural “way that leads to Bethlehem” would be by the “Gate of\r\nSion.”\r\n\r\n[960] _Est._, ll. 10089-135; _Itin._, 377, 378. Both writers give\r\nthe date as “the third day before S. John’s,” and the Latin one adds\r\n“die S. Albani,” _i. e._ June 22. On June 22, however, Richard was,\r\nas we have seen, at Galatia. Roger of Howden’s account of the affair\r\n(iii. 182) is obviously confused. He gives no date; but in his work,\r\nas in the _Estoire_ and the _Itinerarium_, the story is immediately\r\nfollowed by that of the Egyptian caravan. Probably therefore the true\r\ndate is Sunday, June 21.\r\n\r\n[961] R.

(The dates will appear\r\nfrom the sequel.) The former writer seems to imply, and the latter\r\ndistinctly states, that Richard had really and avowedly called his\r\nships together for the purpose of sailing at once for Europe, the\r\nattack on Beyrout being intended as a mere incident on the way.\r\nI cannot believe this view of the matter to be based on anything\r\nelse than an erroneous impression current among the lower ranks of\r\nthe host. Richard may very likely have hoped that the capture of\r\nBeyrout would lead to fresh overtures for peace on the part of the\r\nMoslems, and to such concessions from them as might enable him to\r\nmake a treaty which would end the war for a time, and thus set him\r\nhonourably free to depart before the date which he had fixed; he may\r\nhave made preparations for such a contingency, and if so, he would no\r\ndoubt make them openly because a possibility of their purpose being\r\nmisconstrued could hardly occur to his mind. Richard might break a\r\ntreaty or a contract without scruple, and also without appreciable\r\ndamage to his reputation in his own day; but a sudden desertion of\r\nthe Holy Land such as these writers supposed him to have contemplated\r\nwould have been a flagrant breach of what he and every other man\r\nof the world of chivalry held far more sacred than any treaty or\r\ncontract—his knightly word, solemnly and publicly pledged only a few\r\nweeks before. Such an act must infallibly have brought upon him, in\r\nhis own eyes and in the eyes of all true knights, a double share of\r\nthe “shame and everlasting contempt” which he had once denounced\r\nagainst Philip Augustus, and would be utterly irreconcileable with\r\nhis whole character. The Beyrout project seems really to have been\r\nmuch more definite and important than we should gather from the\r\ncasual way in which it is mentioned by the two Frank chroniclers. It\r\nhad evidently been planned in concert with the other leaders before\r\nRichard left Joppa, since as early as July 22—five days before the\r\nking reached Acre—Saladin had learned from his spies that “the Franks\r\nwere moving on Beyrout”; Bohadin, 322.\r\n\r\n[969] Bohadin, 322, 323; dates, which he gives in his usual\r\nself-contradictory fashion, corrected by help of _Est._, ll.\r\n10807-10, and _Itin._, 400, 401.\r\n\r\n[970] Cf.

Coggeshall’s information is derived from Hugh de\r\nNeville, who was in close attendance on the king during the fight,\r\nhis narrative is probably correct.\r\n\r\n[995] See details of the array in _Itin._, 416.\r\n\r\n[996] R.

Coggeshall, 46,\r\nsays six horses and one mule. Bohadin—after remarking “I was not\r\nthere, thank God!”—says some who were there told him the Christian\r\nknights numbered only nine, or at most seventeen (337); he, or his\r\ninformants, doubtless reckoned as “knights” only those who were\r\nhorsed. According to the _Itin._, 420, Richard gained two more\r\nhorses, as soon as he entered the town, by killing their Turkish\r\nriders.\r\n\r\n[999] “Un hardi serjant e nobile, Henri le Tyois, el conroi Portoit\r\nla baniere le roi,” _Est._, ll. 11432-4. “Serviens probissimus\r\nHernicus Teutonicus, regis signifer,” _Itin._, 415. “Rex ...\r\nassumptis secum sex strenuis militibus cum regio vexillo,” R.\r\nCoggeshall, 55.\r\n\r\n[1000] _Itin._, 420.

He says the truce was for three years and eight\r\nmonths from Wednesday 22 Shaban = October 1. Ibn Alathyr (_Recueil_,\r\nII. i. 65) says three years and eight months from September 1;\r\nImad-ed-Din (_apud_ Abu Shama, 78) says three years and three months,\r\nwithout any date; R. Diceto, ii. 305, and W. Newburgh, lib. iv. c.\r\n29, make the period three years, three months, three weeks, three\r\ndays and three hours from Easter 1193. Bohadin is unquestionably\r\nthe best authority on the matter, especially as the final proposals\r\non the Moslem side appear to have been actually written either by\r\nhis own hand, or by the hand of the writer—whoever this may have\r\nbeen—who made the revised edition of his work, published with a\r\nLatin translation by Dr. Schultens at Leyden; so at least we gather\r\nfrom Schultens, 259—“_Conscripsi_ quae convenerant, _exaravique_\r\nconditiones pacis.” The French version, which represents Bohadin’s\r\noriginal text, has merely “_On_ rédigea,” etc.; so we are left in\r\ndoubt whether the first person in the Leyden version represents\r\nBohadin himself or his reviser.\r\n\r\nRichard of Devizes (69-77) has a long and curious account of the\r\ncircumstances relating to the truce. According to him, the first\r\novertures were made and the preliminaries arranged by Hubert of\r\nSalisbury and Henry of Champagne without the knowledge of King\r\nRichard, and the matter was only referred to the king when it was\r\nso far advanced that, sick and bewildered as he was, he could do\r\nnothing but leave it in their hands and sanction their arrangements.\r\nThis in itself is not impossible, nor is it irreconcileable with\r\nBohadin’s narrative; but there are in Richard’s story details which\r\nare certainly incorrect—_e. g._, he makes Hubert and Henry apply to\r\nSafadin instead of Bedr-ed-Din, and introduces visits of Safadin in\r\nperson to the camp at Joppa and to the king himself, all of which are\r\nunquestionably fictitious or imaginary.\r\n\r\n[1030] _Est._, ll. 11801-26; _Itin._, 429, 430.\r\n\r\n[1031] Bohadin, 348.\r\n\r\n[1032] _Ib._, 349, 350; _Est._, ll. 11868-75; _Itin._, 432.\r\n\r\n[1033] R.

Howden, iii.\r\n306, when recording Guy’s death in 1195, says “cui Rex Angliae\r\nvendiderat insulam Cypri.” But Roger himself says elsewhere (181),\r\nthat when Henry was chosen King of Jerusalem “rex Angliae dedit in\r\nexcambium regi Guidoni insulam de Cypre in vita sua tenendam.” Ralf\r\nof Coggeshall, who also (36) places the transaction after Henry’s\r\nelection in April 1192, says, “Regi Guidoni concessit, accepto ejus\r\nhomagio”; and W. Newburgh (lib. iv. c. 29) says, “mera liberalitate\r\ndonavit.” The version given by all these latter writers can hardly\r\nfail to be the correct one; it is inconceivable that Guy could have\r\nhad means for the purchase.\r\n\r\n[1040] This in an inference from Rigord, 118, who seems to place the\r\nwhole transaction at this time.\r\n\r\n[1041] R.

Howden, iii. 185. Roger\r\ndates the arrival at Corfu, “infra mensem post diem illum,” _i.\r\ne._ the day on which Richard left Acre, October 9. R. Coggeshall,\r\nwhose information, being partly derived from the chaplain Anselm who\r\naccompanied the king on his voyage, is probably more accurate, says\r\n(53) that Richard had been six weeks at sea when he turned back to\r\nCorfu; so the date would be about November 20. According to the same\r\nwriter (_l.c._) the pirate galleys numbered two, not three as Roger\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n[1049] Twenty-one according to R. Howden, _l.c._ One of the party was\r\nAnselm, who told the story to R. Coggeshall, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[1050] R. Howden, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[1051] Document, dated 1598, from the archives of Ragusa, “ex lib.\r\nDiv.

Great Britain has known us ever since Richard received our\r\nhospitality and built for us a most beautiful church on the spot\r\nwhere our ancestors had saved him from shipwreck on his way back from\r\nthe Crusade,” said M. Vesnitch, the representative of Serbia, at a\r\ngreat public meeting in Paris on January 27, 1916.\r\n\r\n[1054] None of the authorities for Richard’s voyage mention more than\r\none landing after his departure from Corfu. “Accidit ut ventus, rupta\r\nnave sua in qua ipse erat, duceret eam versus partes Histriae, ad\r\nlocum qui est inter Aquileiam et Venetiam, ubi rex Dei permissione\r\npassus naufragium cum paucis evasit,” says the Emperor in a letter\r\nto Philip of France (R. Howden, iii. 195). Ansbert (ed. Dobrowsky,\r\n114; Stubbs, R. Howden, iii. introd. cxl.) says, “Ad Polam, civitatem\r\nYstriae, ad litus fertur et applicare cogitur.” R. Diceto (ii. 106)\r\nmakes the voyage end “in Sclavonia”; R. Coggeshall (54), “in partes\r\nSclavoniae, ad quandam villam nomine Gazaram”; R. Howden (iii.\r\n105) “prope Gazere apud Raguse.” This word _Gazere_, misunderstood\r\nas intended to represent Zara, has puzzled commentators, but is\r\nexplained by Wilkinson (_Dalmatia and Montenegro_, i. 301) as being\r\na corruption of an Arabic word meaning “island”; that is, it really\r\nstands here for Lacroma. The final landing was evidently not anywhere\r\nin “Slavonic parts” but in Istria, as the German authorities say; and\r\nof these the Emperor is the most likely to be correct.\r\n\r\n[1055] The narrative which we are here following—that of Richard’s\r\nchaplain and companion Anselm, as reported by R. Coggeshall,\r\n53-5—calls this personage merely “Dominus provinciae illius, qui\r\nnepos extitit Marchisii.” That he was the Count of Gorizia appears\r\nfrom the Emperor’s letter in R. Howden, iii. 195.\r\n\r\n[1056] R. Coggeshall, 54, 55.\r\n\r\n[1057] Gerv.

Coggeshall, 54; and also, as appears later (_ib._, 55),\r\nsome personal attendants of Richard’s.\r\n\r\n[1059] Letter of Henry VI, in R. Howden, iii. 195.\r\n\r\n[1060] Ansbert, ed.

The name of the town, Freisach, and that\r\nof the German lord, Frederic of Pettau, are not given by Ralf; they\r\nare supplied from the Emperor’s letter, _l.c._ Ralf makes the final\r\nhalting-place and the scene of the capture Vienna itself: “ad quandam\r\nvillam nomine Ginanam in Austria prope Danubium”; but the German\r\naccounts, including that of the Emperor, which must have been derived\r\nfrom Leopold of Austria, make it a neighbouring village: “juxta Wenam\r\nin villa viciniori, in domo despecta,” letter in R. Howden, _l.c._;\r\n“in quoddam diversorium juxta Viennam civitatem,” Otto of S. Blaise\r\n(Pertz, xx. 334); “circa Wiennam ... in vili hospitio,” Ansbert\r\n(ed. Dobrowsky, 114, R. Howden, iii. cxl). Kellner (_Gefangenschaft\r\nRichards I_, 29), calls the place “Erdberg, Dörfchen bei Wien”; but I\r\ncan find no authority for the name. Trivet, to whom he seems to refer\r\nfor it, says “in civitate Wienna” (ed. Eng. Hist. Soc., p. 148).\r\n\r\n[1063] R. Coggeshall, 56. R. Howden, iii, 186, says Richard was\r\ncaptured asleep; according to Otto of S. Blaise (Pertz, xx. 324),\r\nhe was roasting meat on a spit, thinking by this servile employment\r\nto avoid recognition, and was betrayed by a splendid ring which he\r\nhad forgotten to remove from his finger. This account of the matter\r\nhas a somewhat characteristic air; but it may have been founded on a\r\nconfused version of Ralf’s story of the ring offered to Mainard of\r\nGorizia. W. Newburgh’s narrative of Richard’s adventures (lib. iv.\r\nc. 31) seems to be based on the Emperor’s letter, which says nothing\r\nabout the circumstances of the capture; the details and speeches\r\nadded by William are obviously mere rhetoric of his own. The date\r\nis given by R. Coggeshall as December 21, by R. Diceto (ii. 106) as\r\nDecember 22.\r\n\r\n[1064] _Ann. Marbac._, Pertz, xvii. 165; Ansbert, ed. Dobrowsky, 112;\r\nR.

Dobrowsky, 78; for date see Kellner, 18, note 2.\r\nMilan does not appear in Philip’s itinerary in _Gesta Ric._, unless\r\nin the form of “Cassem Milan” (230), and this identification is\r\ndoubtful, as the name comes between “Monte Bardon” and “Furnos,” _i.\r\ne._ Farinovo. Some of the other names, however, seem to be out of\r\ngeographical order.\r\n\r\n[1074] This probably referred to Richard’s dealings with Saladin.\r\n\r\n[1075] R. Howden, iii. 198, 199; cf. W. Newb., lib. iv. c. 33. The\r\ndate of the assembly is from R. Diceto, ii. 106. The place was\r\nprobably Spire; Richard was there on Easter day and on the Tuesday in\r\nEaster week (March 28 and 30), _Epp. Cantuar._, 362-4. The statement\r\nof the Emperor’s poetical panegyrist, Peter of Eboli, that Richard\r\noffered to clear himself by ordeal of battle, a proposal by which\r\nHenry was so greatly impressed in his favour that he set him at\r\nliberty (_Petr. Ansolini de Ebulo Carmen_, _apud_ Muratori, _Rer.\r\nItal. Scriptt._ xxxi. 142), is probably a misunderstanding or a\r\npoetical embellishment of Richard’s offer to stand to right in the\r\ncourt of his French overlord.\r\n\r\n[1076] R. Diceto, ii. 106, 107.\r\n\r\n[1077] Stubbs, note to R. Howden, iii. 210.\r\n\r\n[1078] R. Coggeshall, 58. Ralf says Richard was imprisoned “primo\r\n_Treviris_, deinde Warmatiae.” _Treviris_ here seems to mean\r\nTriffels, as there is no other indication that Richard was ever at\r\nTreves; we shall see that he was at Worms later. Ralf is perhaps the\r\nbest authority as to the character of Richard’s imprisonment, as he\r\nprobably heard about it from Anselm the chaplain, who may very likely\r\nhave been, for a time at least, one of the attendants imprisoned with\r\ntheir sovereign. William of Newburgh (lib. iv. c. 37, lib. v. c. 31)\r\nis less to be trusted on the subject. Two German chroniclers say that\r\nRichard was kept “sub honorabili custodia” (_Ann. Aquicinct._, _Rer.\r\nGall. Scriptt._, xviii. 456), “in libera clausus custodia” (_Andr.\r\nMarchian._, _ib._ 557); but the chief German historian of the time,\r\nOtto of S. Blaise, says “Henricus [regem] Wormatiam asportari vinctum\r\nferroque onustum praecepit” (Pertz, xx. 324).\r\n\r\n[1079] R.

Howden, iii. 234; cf. Gislebert of Mons, Pertz’s small\r\nedition, 250. The duke of Suabia was the emperor’s brother; the\r\nmarquis of Montferrat was Boniface, brother and successor to Conrad.\r\nTo the duke of Louvain Richard also granted the lands in England\r\nwhich had belonged to count Matthew of Boulogne, father of the\r\nduke’s wife, “ipsique duci contra comitem Flandriae et Hanoniae\r\net marchisum Namurcensi auxilium promisit, ita quod saltem tantum\r\ncomiti Flandriae et Hanoniae guerram facerent quod comes nequaquam\r\ndomino regi Franciae auxilium ferre posset” (Gislebert, _l.c._). The\r\nFlemish chronicler adds: “Conventiones tamen eorum in nulla parte\r\nfuerunt observatae; nec mirum, cum rex Angliae nemini unquam vel\r\nfidem vel pactum servasset, nec omnes illi nominati cum quibus foedus\r\nfirmaverat conventiones suas observare consuevissent” (_ib._, 250,\r\n251). This is rather too sweeping, in view of the conduct of the\r\nallies in after-years. One of them at least, Boniface of Montferrat,\r\nreceived three hundred marks “de feodo suo” and ten marks as a\r\npresent from Richard in 1197 (Stapleton, _Norman Exchequer Rolls_,\r\nii. 301).\r\n\r\n[1120] W. Newb., lib. iv. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[1121] R. Howden, iii. 235.\r\n\r\n[1122] R.

Howden, iii. 235. R.\r\nDiceto, ii. 114, makes it a week later, Sunday March 20; but that\r\nthis is wrong is clear from Gervase of Canterbury, i. 524, where we\r\nare told that Richard was received at Canterbury on the 13th, having\r\nlanded at Sandwich on the 12th. Ralf of Coggeshall, 62, says he\r\nlanded “secunda hora diei,” on the Sunday after S. Gregory’s day, _i.\r\ne._ on March 13.\r\n\r\n[1124] R. Diceto, ii. 114; cf. R. Coggeshall, 63.\r\n\r\n[1125] W.

Newb., lib. iv. c. 42. “Rex Ricardus ... consilio\r\nprocerum suorum, _licet aliquantulum_ renitens, coronatus est,” R.\r\nCoggeshall, 64. It is hard to conceive what “ignominy” or “contumely”\r\ncould be thought to attach to the mere fact of Richard’s captivity,\r\nor why Richard should have been “reluctant” to revive a time-honoured\r\ncustom which would surely have appealed with double force to his\r\nwell-known love of pomp and splendour and of grand Church services,\r\nunless its revival was urged upon him for some special reason whose\r\ncogency he was unwilling to admit. On the other hand, it is curious\r\nthat R. Diceto (ii. 114) says nothing about this crown-wearing beyond\r\nthe bare statement that the king “in octavis Paschae regni diadema\r\nsuscepit de manibus Huberti Cantuariensis Archiepiscopi.”\r\n\r\n[1144] R.

Gervase of Canterbury, i. 593, calls the place\r\n“Nantrun”; a mistake which is explained by a “Fragmentum aliunde\r\nassutum” to the chronicle of Geoffrey of Vigeois, Labbe, _Thesaur._,\r\nii. 342, where we are told that Richard while lying sick before\r\nChâlus sent some of his troops to besiege two other castles in the\r\nLimousin, Nontron and Montagut.\r\n\r\n[1274] Rigord, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[1275] W. Armor., _Phil._, lib. v. vv. 513-19.\r\n\r\n[1276] Addition to Geoff. Vigeois, 342. W. Armor., _Phil._, lib. v.,\r\nv. 529, says there were six knights and nine “clientes.”\r\n\r\n[1277] R. Coggeshall, 94, 95.\r\n\r\n[1278] R. Howden, iv. 82.\r\n\r\n[1279] R. Coggeshall, 95.\r\n\r\n[1280] W. Arm., _Phil._, lib. v, vv. 572-6; cf. R. Howden, iv. 82.\r\n\r\n[1281] R. Coggeshall, _l.c._; cf. R. Howden, _l.c._; Gerv. Cant., i.\r\n592, and W. Armor., _Phil._, lib. v. v. 589.\r\n\r\n[1282] R. Howden, iv. 82.\r\n\r\n[1283] R. Coggeshall, 95; cf. R.

Howden, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[1287] Addition to G. Vigeois, 342.\r\n\r\n[1288] R. Coggeshall, 96.\r\n\r\n[1289] R. Howden, iv. 83.\r\n\r\n[1290] R. Howden, iv. 83; cf. Gerv. Cant., i. 593, and R. Coggeshall,\r\n96. Howden gives the name of Richard’s slayer as Bertrand de Gourdon;\r\nin the MSS. of W. Armor., _Phil._ (lib. v. v. 587), it appears in\r\ndifferent forms, which M. Delaborde takes to be misreadings of\r\n“Gurdo.” Gervase of Canterbury, i. 592, calls the man “juvenis\r\nquidem Johannes Sabraz agnomine”; R. Diceto, ii. 166, calls him\r\n“Petrus Basilii,” and is supported by the anonymous continuator of G.\r\nVigeois, 342, who says: “Unus de militibus” [_i. e._ the two knights\r\nin the castle] “vocatus Petrus Bru, alter Petrus Basilii, de quo\r\ndicitur quod sagittam cum arbalista tractam emisit qua percussus rex\r\nintra duodecimam diem vitam finivit.”\r\n\r\n[1291] R. Coggeshall, 96.\r\n\r\n[1292] Charter of Eleanor—summarized in Round’s _Calendar of\r\nDocuments relating to France_, i. 472—to the abbey of S. Mary at\r\nTorpenay, to which she grants an endowment “for the welfare of the\r\nsoul of her dearest son Richard, king of England, and for the yearly\r\ncelebration of his anniversary,” “because her beloved [Luke, abbot\r\nof Torpenay,] was present with her at the illness and funeral of her\r\ndearest son the king, and laboured above all others at his obsequies.”\r\n\r\n[1293] R. Howden, iv. 84.\r\n\r\n[1294] R. Coggeshall, 96. “Septima hora noctis,” says the continuator\r\nof G. Vigeois, 342. R. Coggeshall gives the day as April 7, but his\r\nown next words—“scilicet undecimo die a vulnere sibi illato”—show\r\nthis to be an error for April 6, the date given by the best English\r\nauthorities, R. Diceto, ii. 166, Gerv. Cant., i. 593, and R. Howden,\r\n_l.c._, and also by the Cont. G. Vigeois, _l.c._\r\n\r\n[1295] _Ann. Winton_, a. 1199.\r\n\r\n[1296] _Magna Vita S. Hugonis_, 286.\r\n\r\n[1297] Gerv. Cant., i. 593.\r\n\r\n[1298] W.
