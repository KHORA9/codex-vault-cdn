FOUNDED, A.D. 1897]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the hope that we have succeeded in some measure in living up to the\r\nhigh standard set by our honored predecessor, Thomas Hamilton Murray, in\r\nthe compiling of the Journal of the American Irish Historical Society,\r\nwe beg to offer Volume VIII.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that the illness and death of Mr. Murray\r\nmade it impossible to issue a Journal for 1908, and that a break was\r\nnecessitated in the series of interesting and ably-edited publications\r\nfor which he was responsible. It is hoped, therefore, that there will be\r\nfound enough of interest in the records here submitted to compensate in\r\nsome small degree for the lapse of a year in the spreading of the\r\nSociety’s records before its members. The last Volume by Mr. Murray was\r\nissued on December 31, 1907. Volume VIII contains nothing of the records\r\nof the subsequent year except the account of the annual meeting and\r\ndinner held at the Manhattan Hotel, New York, January 29, 1908. This\r\naccount was compiled through correspondence with various members who\r\nwere present at that time.\r\n\r\nThe present incumbent was appointed Acting Secretary-General of the\r\nSociety on November 18, 1908, by the President-General to serve until\r\nthe next annual meeting, January 16, 1909. At that time he was formally\r\nelected to the office for the ensuing year. There being no data previous\r\nto this election from which to compile a chronological index for this\r\nVolume, its omission has been necessary. Full accounts of all\r\nproceedings will be found, however, and every address delivered at any\r\nevent under the auspices of the Society is given in full, everything of\r\nthe sort having been reported stenographically by the Society’s\r\nstenographer. Many events of direct or indirect interest to our members\r\nhave also been touched upon.\r\n\r\nThe Society is at the present time in a most prosperous condition. Its\r\nfinancial status is satisfactory, and its membership is steadily\r\nincreasing, already numbering men of national and international\r\nprominence. Its influence is rapidly becoming national, and the\r\naccomplishment of its great primary object, “To Make Better Known the\r\nIrish Chapter in American History,” seems assured.\r\n\r\n                                            THOMAS ZANSLAUR LEE,\r\n                                                    _Secretary-General_.\r\n\r\nProvidence, R.

It is a work\r\nworthy of the sympathy and aid of every American who can rise above the\r\nenvironment of today and look into the broad future. Fidelity, truth,\r\nhonor are the watchwords of such a purpose, and under their noble\r\ninfluences should our work be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE II.\r\n                         OBJECTS AND PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe objects and purposes of this Society are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) The study of American history generally.\r\n\r\n  (2) To investigate, especially, the immigration of the people of\r\n  Ireland to this country, determine its numbers, examine the sources,\r\n  learn the places of its settlement, and estimate its influence on\r\n  contemporary events in war, legislation, religion, education and other\r\n  departments of human activity.\r\n\r\n  (3) To examine records of every character, wherever found, calculated\r\n  to throw light on the work of the Irish element in this broad land.\r\n\r\n  (4) To endeavor to correct erroneous, distorted and false views of\r\n  history, where they are known, and to substitute therefor the truth of\r\n  history, based on documentary evidence and the best and most\r\n  reasonable tradition, in relation to the Irish race in America.\r\n\r\n  (5) To encourage and assist the formation of local societies in\r\n  American cities and towns for the work of the parent society.\r\n\r\n  (6) To promote and foster an honorable and national spirit of\r\n  patriotism, which will know no lines of division, which will be based\r\n  upon loyalty to the laws, institutions and spirit of the republic to\r\n  whose upbuilding the Irish element has unselfishly contributed in\r\n  blood and treasure, a patriotism whose simple watchwords will be true\r\n  Americanism and human freedom and which has no concern for any man’s\r\n  race, color or creed, measuring him only by his conduct, effort and\r\n  achievement.\r\n\r\n  (7) To promote by union in a common high purpose a sincere fraternity,\r\n  a greater emulation in well doing, a closer confidence and mutual\r\n  respect among the various elements of the Irish race in America, that\r\n  by putting behind them the asperities of the past they may unite in a\r\n  common brotherhood with their fellow citizens for the honor of the\r\n  race and the glory of the republic.\r\n\r\n  (8) To place the result of its historical investigations and\r\n  researches in acceptable literary form; to print, publish and\r\n  distribute its documents to libraries, institutions of learning, and\r\n  among its members, in order that the widest dissemination of\r\n  historical truth may be obtained and placed within the reach of\r\n  historians and other writers and readers.\r\n\r\n  (9) To sift and discriminate every paper, sketch, document bearing on\r\n  the Society’s line of work before the same is accepted and given\r\n  official sanction in order that its publication may be a guarantee of\r\n  historical accuracy; to do its work without passion or prejudice, to\r\n  view accomplished facts in the true scientific historical spirit and\r\n  having reached the truth to give it to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE III.\r\n                              MEMBERSHIP.\r\n\r\nAny person of good moral character who is interested in the special work\r\nof this Society shall be deemed eligible for membership in the same.

The life membership\r\nfee is $50 (paid once). The fee for annual members is $5, paid yearly.\r\nIn the case of new annual members, the initiation fee, $5, also pays the\r\nmembership dues for the first year.\r\n\r\nThe government comprises a President-General, a Vice-President-General,\r\na Secretary-General, a Treasurer-General, a Librarian and Archivist, a\r\nHistoriographer and an Executive Council. There are also State\r\nVice-Presidents.\r\n\r\nThe Society has already issued several bound volumes and a number of\r\nother publications. These have been distributed to members, public\r\nlibraries, historical organizations and universities. Each member of the\r\nSociety is entitled, free of charge, to a copy of every publication\r\nissued from the time of his admittance. These publications are of great\r\ninterest and value, and are more than an equivalent for the membership\r\nfee.\r\n\r\nThe Society draws no lines of creed or politics. Being an American\r\norganization in spirit and principle, it welcomes to its ranks Americans\r\nof whatever race or descent, and of whatever creed, who take an interest\r\nin the objects for which the Society is organized. Membership\r\napplication blanks will be furnished on request to the Secretary-General\r\nat his office, 49 Westminster Street, Providence, R. I., or to John J.\r\nLenehan, Chairman of the Committee on Membership, 71 Nassau Street, New\r\nYork City. Blank applications found at the end of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe membership includes many people of prominence and occupies a\r\nposition in the front rank of American historical organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Society is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State\r\nof Rhode Island and is authorized to take, hold and convey real and\r\npersonal estate to the amount of $100,000.\r\n\r\nGifts or bequests of money for the uses of the Society are solicited. We\r\ndepend entirely on our membership fees and dues, and if we had a\r\nsuitable fund on hand its income would be most advantageously used for\r\nhistorical research, printing and issuing historical works and papers\r\nand adding to our library.

C.\r\n\r\n  T. H. MURRAY,\r\n      _Secretary-General_,\r\n          911 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nA goodly number of members responded to the notice, and the sale of\r\ntickets gave evidence that a large gathering would be present.\r\n\r\nThe Reception Committee was early in attendance and rendered much\r\nvaluable service. It greatly assisted the Secretary-General, who was\r\nill, in the performance of his duties, introduced the new members as\r\nthey appeared and arranged the seatings of members for the banquet.\r\n\r\nAt 6.30 p. m. the annual meeting was called to order by Hon. Thomas Z.\r\nLee, in the absence of the President-General and Vice-President-General,\r\nand, upon being elected President-General _pro tem_, presided throughout\r\nthe business meeting.\r\n\r\nTreasurer-General Dooley announced through the Chairman that the funds\r\nof the Society were deposited in the Union Trust Company, Providence, R.\r\nI., at the time of its suspension, and that a plan for its\r\nreorganization had been suggested, but not yet adopted. The funds were\r\ntherefore not available for our use and he could not tell when they\r\nwould be. In order that the Society might have its funds subject to its\r\ndisposal and not be obliged to await a more or less indefinite\r\nreorganization of the Union Trust Company, Mr. Dooley had drawn his\r\npersonal cheque for the total amount of our detained funds and deposited\r\nsame to the credit of the Society. He asked that we give him an\r\nassignment of our money in the Union Trust Company in order that he\r\ninstead of us might do the waiting and take the chances of being repaid.\r\n\r\nMr. Dooley’s generous offer was most cordially accepted, and a committee\r\nappointed by the Chairman for that purpose immediately executed the\r\nassignment of our detained funds as requested.\r\n\r\nUpon motion of Mr. Dennis H. Tierney, a vote of thanks was extended\r\nTreasurer-General Dooley for the transaction above mentioned, and\r\nremarks of a most complimentary nature were made by several previous to\r\nthe adoption of the vote.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Secretary-General was read and it was ordered\r\nthat the same be received and placed on file.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Treasurer-General showing receipts,\r\ndisbursements and balance on hand was read, and it was ordered that the\r\nsame be received and placed on file.\r\n\r\nA number of new members were elected, some of whom were present later at\r\nthe banquet.\r\n\r\nThe election of officers for the ensuing year was called for, and the\r\nfollowing gentlemen, having the unanimous endorsement of the Executive\r\nCouncil, were by ballot duly elected to the following offices:\r\n\r\n                          _President-General_,\r\n                   FRANCIS J.

Breen, New York City, and many others.\r\n\r\nPresident-General Quinlan opened the proceedings, and the Rev. Dr. John\r\nJ. McCoy said grace.\r\n\r\nA most eloquent speech was delivered by Mr. Henry J. Breen, son of Hon.\r\nMatthew P. Breen, and he was followed by Hon. John F. O’Connell of\r\nProvidence, who spoke concerning the Sullivan Memorial and the work of\r\nthe Society in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. John J. McCoy was then introduced, and his discourse was\r\ngraceful, eloquent and learned, and a beautiful tribute to the work of\r\nthe Society.\r\n\r\nHon. Patrick J. Ryan of Elizabeth, N. J., told in a most interesting\r\nmanner of the growth of New York and of his experiences as a boy romping\r\nabout on the present site of the hotel where the banquet was held.\r\n\r\nMr. T. Vincent Butler of New York made a short speech about our\r\nfellow-member, President Roosevelt, and proposed a toast to his health,\r\nwhich was drunk amid much enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nDr. M. F. Sullivan of Lawrence, Mass., gave a number of very practical\r\nsuggestions as to how the membership of the Society could be increased\r\nand the sphere of its work extended.\r\n\r\nMr. David Healy of New York spoke of the supreme importance of the work\r\nof the Society in centering the light of organized, intelligent and\r\npainstaking research upon Ireland’s part in the making of American\r\nhistory; of her contributions to America’s greatness, and the proud\r\nplace which has been honorably won by her children as an integral part\r\nof American life, American ideals, and American nationality.\r\n\r\n“One of the great disadvantages with which the Irish element in American\r\nlife has had to deal,” said Mr. Healy, “has been the fact that histories\r\nand school text-books, current in the English speaking world, have been\r\ntoo largely the product of minds influenced and prejudiced by inherited\r\nanti-Irish animosities and pro-English traditions.\r\n\r\n“The Irish have been considered as pre-eminently a martial race because\r\nof their persistent and unconquerable struggles for a score of\r\ngenerations to vindicate the principle of Irish nationality.\r\n\r\n“It is true that the Celtic race has also been universally awarded an\r\nexalted place in the realm of poetry, oratory and song, as well as in\r\ndevotion to family and in faithfulness to principle. It remains for the\r\nAmerican Irish Historical Society to show other and equally important\r\nand admirable characteristics of the Irish race, and to point to other\r\nfields wherein Irishmen have distinguished themselves in meeting the\r\ncurrent and pressing problems of America’s rapid and unparalleled\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n“It remains for us to realize and to show to others that not only was it\r\nthe Irishman’s pick that brought the earth’s hidden treasures to the\r\nsurface, his shovel that made ready for the iron rail across the\r\ncontinent, but it was Irish brain and enterprise largely that developed\r\nthe mines and constructed the steel pathway between the East and the\r\nWest, thus making a national unit qualified and competent to deal with\r\nthe nations of the world.\r\n\r\n“In the great life current of American nationality, the rich red blood\r\nof the Celt has been a dominant and fructifying tributary.\r\n\r\n“It also remains for us to realize our shortcomings and to aim for the\r\nhighest ideals, not to be content with a leading place in the world of\r\nmilitary renown, financial, industrial and commercial enterprise. We\r\nshould earnestly seek correspondingly high places in the realm of\r\nphilanthropy, moderation and universal brotherhood.”\r\n\r\nDuring the evening the Sullivan Memorial Committee having in charge the\r\nerection and dedication of a bronze memorial at the State House in Rhode\r\nIsland to Maj.-Gen. John Sullivan, made a report through Judge Lee, its\r\nchairman, showing substantial progress and an intention to dedicate the\r\nmemorial some time during the present year.\r\n\r\nMr. Dennis H. Tierney made stirring remarks concerning “The Star\r\nSpangled Banner” as a patriotic song taken as a whole, and deplored the\r\ndisposition of so many public bodies to leave out parts of it.\r\n\r\nAfter remarks by other members the company dispersed, having\r\nparticipated in one of the most entertaining and instructive banquets\r\never held by the Society.\r\n\r\n                                        THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,\r\n                                                    _Secretary-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         THE SULLIVAN MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISTINGUISHED GATHERING OF MEMBERS AND GUESTS PRESENT—PROCEEDINGS IN\r\n                                 FULL.\r\n\r\nAn event of much historical significance to Rhode Island, and indeed to\r\nthe entire country, took place under the auspices of the Society at the\r\nRhode Island State House on Wednesday, December 16, 1908, when an\r\nimpressive bronze memorial was dedicated to the memory of Major-General\r\nJohn Sullivan, one of Rhode Island’s Revolutionary heroes.\r\n\r\nThe memorial, which most appropriately commemorates the services of\r\nGeneral Sullivan to his race, his country and his State, is placed in a\r\nfitting position in the broad corridor of the main entrance to the\r\ncapitol. Large, beautifully designed and in every way worthy of its\r\nmission, it immediately claims the attention of everyone who enters the\r\nState House. It has already been the object of favorable comment from\r\nmany distinguished people, and is acknowledged to be a credit not only\r\nto the memory of the distinguished soldier, but also to the Society\r\nthrough whose efforts it was placed in its present position.\r\n\r\nThe exercises on the day of the unveiling were in every way worthy of\r\nsuch an occasion. People of distinction in every walk of life were\r\npresent, all the historical organizations of the State were represented\r\nby officers and members, and addresses befitting the event were\r\ndelivered by men of prominence in public life and in historical\r\nresearch. Col. David C. Robinson, of New York, a well-known student of\r\nhistory and a most eloquent speaker, was the orator of the day, and\r\ninspiring speeches were made by Dr. Francis J. Quinlan, of New York,\r\nPresident-General of the Society; Gov. James H. Higgins, of Rhode\r\nIsland; Governor-elect Aram J. Pothier; ex-Governor Charles Warren\r\nLippitt; Mayor Patrick J. McCarthy, of Providence; and Gen. William\r\nAmes, chairman of the State House Commission. Hon. Thomas Z. Lee, of\r\nProvidence, chairman of the Sullivan Memorial Committee, presided. The\r\nexercises took place in the presence of a large gathering and one\r\nthoroughly representative of the public and social life of the city and\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. THOMAS ZANSLAUR LEE,\r\n\r\n  Secretary-General of the American Irish Historical Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFollowing the dedicatory exercises luncheon was served at the\r\nNarragansett Hotel, the Society’s headquarters, and this also was\r\nfollowed by a number of brief addresses from well-known Rhode Islanders\r\nand members of the Society from other States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at the State House began at noon, Judge Lee making the\r\nopening address. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_Honored Guests, Members of the American Irish Historical Society,\r\n      Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\n  “We are assembled in the Rhode Island State House today to dedicate a\r\n  memorial in honor of Maj. Gen. John Sullivan whose service to the\r\n  country and this State during the war of the Revolution is familiar to\r\n  every American, and whose career as a soldier, statesman and jurist\r\n  will be eloquently depicted by those who will be presented to you\r\n  later. My remarks will be confined to a short history of the American\r\n  Irish Historical Society under whose auspices the memorial was\r\n  erected, and a reference to the movement and spirit which prompted the\r\n  work.\r\n\r\n  “The American Irish Historical Society was organized in Boston,\r\n  January 20th, 1897. Certain gentlemen interested in historical work,\r\n  believing that proper recognition had not always been given by\r\n  historians and others to the part taken in the settlement,\r\n  foundations, upbuilding and general affairs of the United States by\r\n  those of Irish descent, brought forth the idea of a society, national\r\n  in its scope, that should be devoted to making better known the Irish\r\n  Chapter in American history, by giving plain recitals of facts,\r\n  correcting errors, supplying omissions, discouraging prejudice,\r\n  establishing right and truth, and giving rightful place and just due\r\n  to historical matters concerning American citizens of Irish nativity,\r\n  blood or extraction. Invitations were sent out by these gentlemen, and\r\n  an enthusiastic meeting took place, at which representatives from\r\n  seventeen States were present; and the following were elected the\r\n  first officers of the Society:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Rear Admiral Richard Worsam Meade, U. S. Navy, of Washington,\r\n  President-General; Mr. Osborne Howes of Massachusetts,\r\n  Vice-President-General; Hon. John C. Linehan of New Hampshire,\r\n  Treasurer-General; Thomas Hamilton Murray of Rhode Island,\r\n  Secretary-General; and Thomas B. Lawler of New York, Librarian and\r\n  Archivist.\r\n\r\n  “The first Executive Council consisted of the foregoing and Mr. James\r\n  Jeffrey Roche of Boston, Hon. Robert Ellis Thompson of Philadelphia,\r\n  Hon. Theodore Roosevelt of New York, Hon. Edward A. Moseley of\r\n  Washington, Mr. Augustus St. Gaudens of New York, Mr. Joseph Smith of\r\n  Lowell, T. Russell Sullivan, a direct descendant of General Sullivan,\r\n  of Boston, and Hon. Maurice F. Egan of Washington.\r\n\r\n  “The first Board of State Vice-Presidents was as follows: Maine, Mr.\r\n  James Cunningham of Portland; New Hampshire, Mr. T. P. Sullivan of\r\n  Concord; Vermont, Mr. Thomas W. Moloney of Rutland; Massachusetts, Mr.\r\n  Osborne Howes of Boston; Rhode Island, Mr. M. Joseph Harson of\r\n  Providence; Connecticut, Mr. Joseph F. Swords of Hartford; New York,\r\n  General James R. O’Beirne of New York City; New Jersey, Hon. William\r\n  McAdoo, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, of Jersey City; Pennsylvania,\r\n  General St. Clair A. Mulholland of Philadelphia; South Carolina,\r\n  Ex-United States Senator M. C. Butler of Edgefield; Georgia, Ex-United\r\n  States Senator Patrick Walsh of Atlanta; Ohio, Rev. George W. Pepper\r\n  of Cleveland; Illinois, W. J. Onahan of Chicago; Michigan,\r\n  Ex-Congressman Thomas A. E. Weadock of Detroit; Minnesota, Mr. Daniel\r\n  W. Lawler of St. Paul; Missouri, Mr. Richard E. Kerens of St. Louis;\r\n  District of Columbia, Mr. J. D. O’Connell of Washington.\r\n\r\n  “The work that the Society has undertaken is worthy of the sympathy\r\n  and aid of every American who is interested in the past, present and\r\n  future of this, the greatest country on earth; and in doing its work\r\n  the watchwords of the Society are Fidelity, Truth and Honor, and we\r\n  feel and know what the influence and inspiration of these words mean.\r\n\r\n  “One of the preambles in the Constitution reads: ‘While we as loyal\r\n  citizens of this Republic are earnestly interested in all the various\r\n  phases of its history, we feel that we should be false to its honor\r\n  and greatness and recreant to our own blood if we did not make a\r\n  serious effort to leave to those generations which will follow us, a\r\n  clearer and better knowledge of the important work done by men and\r\n  women of the Irish race in the United States.’\r\n\r\n  “The broad scope of our work may be comprehended from a statement of\r\n  our objects and purposes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “(1) The study of American history generally.\r\n\r\n    “(2) To investigate, especially, the immigration of the people of\r\n    Ireland to this country, determine its numbers, examine the sources,\r\n    learn the places of settlement; and estimate the influence on\r\n    contemporary events in war, legislation, religion, education and\r\n    other departments of human activity.\r\n\r\n    “(3) To examine records of every character, wherever found,\r\n    calculated to throw light on the work of the Irish element in this\r\n    broad land.\r\n\r\n    “(4) To endeavor to correct erroneous, distorted and false views of\r\n    history, where they are known, and to substitute therefor the truth\r\n    of history, based on documentary evidence, and the best and most\r\n    reasonable tradition, in relation to the Irish race in America.\r\n\r\n    “(5) To encourage and assist the formation of local societies in\r\n    American cities and towns for the work of the parent Society.\r\n\r\n    “(6) To promote and foster an honorable and national spirit of\r\n    patriotism, which shall know no lines of division, which shall be\r\n    based upon loyalty to the laws, institutions and spirit of the\r\n    Republic to whose upbuilding the Irish element has unselfishly\r\n    contributed in blood and treasure, a patriotism whose simple\r\n    watchwords shall be ‘true Americanism’ and ‘human freedom,’ and\r\n    which has no concern for any man’s race, color or creed, measuring\r\n    him only by his conduct, effort and achievement.\r\n\r\n    “(7) To promote by union in a common high purpose, a sincere\r\n    fraternity, a greater emulation in well doing, a closer confidence\r\n    and mutual respect among the various elements of the Irish race in\r\n    America, that by putting behind it the asperities of the past, it\r\n    may unite in a common brotherhood with its fellows for the honor of\r\n    the race and the glory of the Republic.\r\n\r\n    “(8) To compile the results of its historical investigations in\r\n    suitable literary form; to print, publish and distribute its\r\n    documents among libraries, educational institutions and its own\r\n    membership with a view to the wide dissemination of historical\r\n    truths, and in order that such data may be placed within the reach\r\n    of historians and other writers and readers.\r\n\r\n    “(9) To discriminate every paper, sketch and document bearing on the\r\n    work of the Society before the same is accepted and given official\r\n    sanction, in order that its publication may be a guarantee of its\r\n    historical accuracy; to do its work without passion or prejudice, to\r\n    view acknowledged facts in the true scientific historical spirit;\r\n    and, having reached the truth, to give it to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Some two years ago the movement for the erection of this memorial was\r\n  started. The first suggestion came from Mr. Thomas Hamilton Murray,\r\n  the late honored Secretary-General of the Society. The Rhode Island\r\n  members at once manifested a deep interest, formed themselves into a\r\n  committee, and, in due time, solicited among their number\r\n  subscriptions for this memorial. These subscriptions came in very\r\n  satisfactorily, and, when we were assured that it was possible to\r\n  erect a suitable memorial, a sub-committee of the general committee\r\n  conferred with the Board of State House Commissioners, who assigned to\r\n  us the most appropriate space in the State House, beside the cases of\r\n  flags carried by Rhode Island regiments in the different wars.\r\n\r\n  “The memorial has been erected with the aid of Rhode Island\r\n  subscriptions, with one or two exceptions. It was designed by the\r\n  brilliant young sculptor, Mr. John G. Hardy, under whose direction it\r\n  was executed by the W. J. Feeley Company, of Providence.\r\n\r\n  “I now take great pleasure in behalf of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society and in behalf of its committee, in presenting to the State of\r\n  Rhode Island the Sullivan memorial, which Mr. Hardy will now unveil.\r\n  (At this point the flags draping the memorial were drawn aside by the\r\n  sculptor.)\r\n\r\n  “And now I have the great honor to present to you a gentleman\r\n  well-known and highly-honored by all Rhode Islanders, one who has\r\n  shown deep interest in this, as in all other worthy projects, Hon.\r\n  James H. Higgins, Governor of Rhode Island.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Higgins spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Ladies and Gentlemen_: In behalf of the State of Rhode Island, I am\r\n  not only pleased but proud indeed to accept this splendid memorial.\r\n  Rhode Island has a particular interest in the career and achievements\r\n  of General Sullivan. He was delegated to the command of the forces in\r\n  Rhode Island largely through the recommendation of General Greene, the\r\n  greatest soldier of all in the Revolution next to Washington. Through\r\n  the joint recommendations of Washington and Greene, Sullivan was\r\n  placed in command of the forces in this State.\r\n\r\n  “There was perhaps no State in the Union which, in proportion to its\r\n  size and population, suffered more of the hardships of that great\r\n  struggle than our own. Some historians have suggested that one section\r\n  of our State, Newport and the Island of Rhode Island, have never\r\n  recovered from the blow dealt it through the long occupation of that\r\n  section of the State by the British forces. We of Rhode Island,\r\n  therefore, have a particular interest in the efforts of General\r\n  Sullivan to expel the British from this State.\r\n\r\n  “We are proud, therefore, to know that the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society has taken this matter up and has shown such active interest in\r\n  perpetuating the memory and the exploits of General Sullivan. I am\r\n  sure that I can say on behalf of our united citizenship that the State\r\n  appreciates this activity, this patriotism, on the part of the\r\n  American Irish Historical Society, and we want to say to you, sirs,\r\n  that the fruit of your interest—this memorial—will ever be preserved\r\n  by our State as a remembrance of his splendid achievements, as well as\r\n  of the generosity and the patriotism of the organization which\r\n  prompted it. May your activity, my friends, be continued throughout\r\n  the length and breadth of the land and throughout the entire period of\r\n  your career in the same creditable and patriotic manner that has\r\n  characterized your work concerning General Sullivan.\r\n\r\n  “Again, sirs, I am pleased to accept in behalf of our State this\r\n  splendid remembrance, to assure you of our profound appreciation, and\r\n  to say that it shall ever remain as a memento of your patriotism and\r\n  character, of the gratitude and appreciation of our good State, as an\r\n  inspiration to all future generations and to all visitors to this\r\n  splendid Capitol, of the value and eternity of that thankfulness which\r\n  a grateful people feel for those who serve them well.\r\n\r\n  “It is now my pleasure to turn the memorial over to General William\r\n  Ames, the Chairman of the State House Commission, in whose trustworthy\r\n  hands this monument will be placed and from whom I am sure it will\r\n  receive the same careful and patriotic attention that all his other\r\n  duties have received in connection with the management of our splendid\r\n  State Capitol. I am pleased, therefore, to introduce to you one of our\r\n  most honored fellow citizens, General William Ames, who will accept in\r\n  behalf of the State House Commission.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Ames responded as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Your Excellency, Members of the American Irish Historical Society,\r\n  Ladies and Gentlemen_: As Chairman of the Commission having in its\r\n  care and keeping this beautiful State House it is my privilege to bid\r\n  you welcome here today. We are assembled, not for an ordinary\r\n  occasion, but for an extraordinary one. We are here to inscribe upon\r\n  this marble wall the name of one who was patriot, soldier and\r\n  statesman, the commander who planned and fought the Battle of Rhode\r\n  Island in 1778.\r\n\r\n  “General John Sullivan passed on long years ago to make his final\r\n  report to the great Commander of us all. Yet we have treasured his\r\n  memory, and through the years it has grown ever dearer to the hearts\r\n  of all patriotic Americans—to us of Rhode Island more than all. And\r\n  now that love has found fitting expression in this memorial, which\r\n  shall commemorate through the coming ages his patriotism, his\r\n  devotion, and his loyal services to his country.\r\n\r\n  “A State can perform no more graceful act than to make public record\r\n  of the deeds and accomplishments of its famous sons. It therefore\r\n  gives me great pleasure, and I deem it a high honor, to accept for the\r\n  State House Commission the custody and care of the beautiful memorial\r\n  placed upon these walls by the American Irish Historical Society.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of General Ames’ acceptance Chairman Lee introduced\r\nMayor McCarthy in the following words: “The thanks of the American Irish\r\nHistorical Society are due and are hereby tendered to General Ames and\r\nto Hon. James M. Scott and Col. J. Edward Studley, the other members of\r\nthe Board of State House Commissioners, for their great courtesy to us.\r\nIt was to them we first addressed ourselves for permission to place our\r\nmemorial to General Sullivan in the State House, and when it was ready\r\nfor its permanent position a few weeks ago, we went to them again\r\nconcerning the dedicatory exercises. Our comfortable seating was\r\nprovided for, the freedom of this beautiful capitol extended us and an\r\nample force of employees placed at our disposal. We may well be grateful\r\nfor the uniform courtesy and consideration that marked all the\r\nCommission’s dealing with our Society.\r\n\r\n“The Secretary of our committee is a very worthy member of the Society.\r\nAs I happened to be the Chairman, it was my privilege to sign my name\r\nover his in issuing the invitations. It is the first time I have ever\r\nhad an opportunity of putting my name before that of His Honor the\r\nMayor, and I enjoyed the opportunity. But now, after doing his work as\r\nSecretary of the committee very faithfully, he has tendered his\r\nresignation, which we have most regretfully accepted, in order that he\r\nmight do his duty as Chief Executive of the City of Providence. I have\r\nthe honor to introduce to you our esteemed fellow-member, Hon. Patrick\r\nJ. McCarthy of Providence, who will, I am sure, extend to us a warm\r\nwelcome to the principal city of the State over the destinies of which\r\nhe presides so ably.”\r\n\r\nMayor McCarthy said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Mr. Chairman, Fellow Members of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society, Ladies and Gentlemen_: I am deeply sensible of the honor my\r\n  official position and duty brings me on this occasion as Mayor of\r\n  Providence in greeting the representatives of The American Irish\r\n  Historical Society and its distinguished guests from many states; I\r\n  tender you a ‘Providence Welcome,’ and the freedom of the city.\r\n\r\n  “I thank the Society for its munificent gift of the beautiful bronze\r\n  memorial, which commemorates the heroic deeds of Major General John\r\n  Sullivan of the Continental Army and his services to his native State\r\n  (New Hampshire) as citizen, legislator, jurist and governor, and also\r\n  to the United States as a member of Congress.\r\n\r\n  “The people of Providence thank the State House Commissioners for\r\n  allotting space for the memorial in the Capitol Building of Rhode\r\n  Island; it is an appropriate place for a memento of the hero of the\r\n  Battle of Rhode Island. The good deeds of men live after them. General\r\n  Sullivan’s life was spent in the service of his state and country. He\r\n  was generously endowed by nature, with the mental and physical\r\n  qualities that are characteristic of his race, which enabled him to\r\n  perform his duty on the field, on the bench, as chief magistrate of\r\n  his State, and as a citizen, courageously and zealously with loyalty\r\n  to God and country—seeking honor only in the discharge of duty.\r\n\r\n  “The history of his life work survives him. We are assembled to honor\r\n  his memory. The memorial you have this day placed in this State House\r\n  is a page in bronze, of the history of the early struggles of our\r\n  countrymen for National Independence, equal rights, and freedom—a page\r\n  which future generations will read with inspiration to emulate the\r\n  honorable career of General Sullivan.\r\n\r\n  “We honor ourselves in dedicating this monument to his memory.\r\n  Providence is grateful to the Society for possession of it within the\r\n  city, and is modestly proud of the fact that it is the product of a\r\n  Providence artist and establishment.\r\n\r\n  “The dedication of permanent monuments in grateful recognition of the\r\n  noble service of good men inspires others to heroic deeds and\r\n  sacrifices, and perpetuates the history of such men and their\r\n  achievements.\r\n\r\n  “The American Irish Historical Society, in placing this beautiful\r\n  memorial in Rhode Island, commemorates one of the early battles in\r\n  support of the Declaration of Independence and for national separation\r\n  of the Colonies from Great Britain, fought by an American General of\r\n  the Irish race, ever loyal to the cause of freedom and equality and\r\n  commends the history of his life, and the history of the Irish race in\r\n  America to all men of good will.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chairman Lee: “A generous response to our invitations has been\r\n  received, nearly all our invited guests being present. We have\r\n  received letters of regret, however, from Rev. W. H. P. Faunce,\r\n  President of Brown University, Hon. Asa Bird Gardiner, Rt. Rev. Mathew\r\n  Harkins and one or two others whose letters are not this moment before\r\n  me. Our fellow-member, the President of the United States, in a letter\r\n  to us, tenders his regrets at being unable to be present, and cites\r\n  urgent business at home as the reason. Judging from the accounts in\r\n  the morning papers about his trouble with the yellow journals, I take\r\n  it he is pretty busy at this time in Washington.\r\n\r\n  “We have letters of regret from other members of the Society who are\r\n  unable to be present.

Cyrus Townsend Brady of Toledo, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  “Before presenting the orator of the day I desire to say to all\r\n  members who have not visited the Society’s headquarters at the\r\n  Narragansett Hotel that luncheon will be served there after the\r\n  ceremonies here; delegates of all the organizations represented in\r\n  response to our invitation are also cordially invited to join us at\r\n  luncheon. The headquarters are in room 10 at the hotel, and luncheon\r\n  will be served in the main dining-room immediately upon our arrival\r\n  there.\r\n\r\n  “The Society is fortunate in having secured for the principal speaker\r\n  today a gentleman who knows perhaps more about the life and works of\r\n  General Sullivan than does any other in the United States; a statesman\r\n  whose record is widely known, and whose voice has been heard in\r\n  discussion of historical and other matters in the New York capitol at\r\n  Albany on many occasions. The son of a former governor of New York, he\r\n  has always been identified with New York institutions and New York\r\n  laws. Through his efforts the Legislature of that State recently\r\n  appropriated $10,000 for the purpose of erecting a suitable memorial\r\n  to General Sullivan, and, while the purposes of that resolution have\r\n  not yet been fulfilled, it will be but a short time before a fitting\r\n  tribute is paid by the State of New York to the memory of Major\r\n  General Sullivan. And the credit for that tribute will be due in large\r\n  part to the gentleman I now have the honor to introduce, Col. David C.\r\n  Robinson, of Elmira, N. Y.”\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Robinson spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Mr. Chairman, Your Excellency the Governor, Members of the American\r\n  Irish Historical Society, Ladies and Gentlemen_: I should do less than\r\n  justice to the emotions of the hour if I did not, at the outset,\r\n  express my high appreciation of and my profound thanks for the honor\r\n  done me in the invitation from your Society to voice our mutual\r\n  sentiments upon so important an occasion as this. It is an honor to be\r\n  invited as a spectator to take part in such a ceremony as this; it is\r\n  a higher honor to be accounted worthy even by a few to say a word on\r\n  such an occasion; it is honor most of all that I have your unanimous\r\n  invitation to say that which I may be able to in memory of one of the\r\n  noblest and purest characters on whom the sun of history has ever\r\n  shone.\r\n\r\n  “It has been the habit of my life, my friends, to speak without a\r\n  note; the professional training of many years has made it easier. I do\r\n  remember many, very many things about Major General John Sullivan and\r\n  his life; I do not remember all that I should mention, for the line is\r\n  long, and I am, therefore, contrary to my usual custom, obliged to ask\r\n  you to bear with me while I refresh my recollection from time to time\r\n  with a memorandum of some of the most distinguished services with\r\n  which this man’s life was filled, to the end that I may impress the\r\n  lesson which speaks from this memorial, which speaks from the\r\n  long-drawn procession of brave and good and kind deeds with which the\r\n  life of the one whom we commemorate today is surrounded.\r\n\r\n  “And first, before I enter on that which I would say of this memorial\r\n  and of him to whose memory it is dedicated, I want to congratulate\r\n  this Society on that which it has even in the few years of its\r\n  existence accomplished, and on the labors, increased in volume every\r\n  year, by which it makes known the Irish chapter in American history.\r\n\r\n  “To trace that which we owe to the line of blood of which this man was\r\n  one of the most illustrious examples, is a duty which belongs to every\r\n  student of American history. Let us find, if we may, wherein lay that\r\n  in which he so far exceeded most of his fellowmen. Let us make it a\r\n  lesson not alone to say that this man was one of the greatest of\r\n  American Irish or Irish Americans, but that he illustrated a trait of\r\n  character which Americans and Irish American citizens all ought to\r\n  follow, ought to teach their children to follow, ought to endeavor to\r\n  perpetuate in the thoughts, the work, the labors of this land.\r\n\r\n  “Now we are met principally to do honor to the memory and the merits\r\n  of a brave and good man; that is our purpose; but in our acts and\r\n  words today, my friends, we do honor not only to him and to his\r\n  memory, but we do honor to ourselves and our countrymen. He belongs to\r\n  us and we appreciate it. The laurels which we lay on the graves of\r\n  such as he, who periled life, limb, fortune, happiness and health that\r\n  we might enjoy the blessings which are ours today, are laurels piled\r\n  upon our own characters, our own qualities.\r\n\r\n  “From this beautiful tablet, so fittingly placed in honor of him,\r\n  whose name in this hour fills all our hearts, the veil has just fallen\r\n  in your sight. I do not envy that American who, at such a time as\r\n  this, does not feel his heart swell with patriotic pride at the\r\n  thought of what this graven monument means to us and ours.\r\n\r\n  “A thousand recollections sparkle in the chambers of memory as we\r\n  recall the chivalry, the worth, the dauntless courage and self-denying\r\n  loyalty of him whose heart, stilled in its own earthly tenement for\r\n  more than a hundred years, yet lives and throbs and pulses in the\r\n  hearts of every lover of his land and of human liberty the wide world\r\n  around; and, although appreciating to the fullest extent all that your\r\n  Mayor has so well said and the Chairman so ably suggested of the\r\n  beauty of this memorial, I may be pardoned for saying that no work of\r\n  art, no accomplishment of high design, no costly metal, no skilful\r\n  chiseling, no beautiful moulding, can make a memorial worthy of such a\r\n  man as was Major General John Sullivan.\r\n\r\n  “For when I think of what he was and what he did, when there rises to\r\n  my sight the sacrifice and effort, the combat and the stern endurance,\r\n  the privation and the grief, the sorrow and the pain, which marked his\r\n  labor and his life throughout the years which spanned the rise of\r\n  freedom, yea, the hope of men upon this continent, I feel sure that\r\n  pen may not write, voice may not sound, nor can the chisel of art\r\n  produce token worthy of his high deserving.\r\n\r\n  “I would that the task of voicing our sentiments upon this occasion,\r\n  the impressions of this hour, had fallen to other and to abler hands\r\n  than mine. I wish that some peerless orator, born of that great race\r\n  from which he sprang, might tell us here whence came the greatness,\r\n  the nobility, the grace and loveliness which were so gloriously his,\r\n  and, in telling that, might teach our children how he came to that\r\n  high state of manly quality which all the world now knows was his.\r\n\r\n  “But, friends of this great Society, whose well-bent efforts have done\r\n  so much to give deserving heroes the credit which was rightly theirs,\r\n  I know you will not let the awakened and quickening memories of this\r\n  great soul for one moment hesitate in their progress toward wider and\r\n  better appreciation.\r\n\r\n  “I know that my own shortcomings will be more than complemented by\r\n  your larger opportunity of bringing within the circle of his admirers\r\n  every patriotic citizen of this Republic. Nay, more, I hope the day\r\n  will come when every State House in the land shall hold a tablet such\r\n  as this, when every schoolboy shall read lessons from his life, when\r\n  every human being who seeks partnership and title in the freedom of\r\n  his kind shall, in his memory, cherish the name of Major General John\r\n  Sullivan as one who deserves a niche unshadowed and a fame unscarred\r\n  among the scanty array of those great souls whom the genius of Liberty\r\n  proudly calls her own.\r\n\r\n  “This is not the fulsome word of hyperbole; it is not the sounding\r\n  tinkle of rhetoric or idle eulogy. It is the measured testimony of\r\n  those who have read aright the history of the great struggle for\r\n  Independence, and have found therein no light or shadow in which the\r\n  great soul of Major General Sullivan did not sparkle with the luster\r\n  of a flawless diamond. And in this hour, beneath the lofty dome\r\n  henceforth to shadow this memorial, in this free atmosphere which\r\n  seems even now to echo with the guns he fired against his country’s\r\n  foes, in this bright light, not purer than the soul he wore upon his\r\n  sleeve, let us trace out a few of those strands of character which\r\n  made him what he was, and, in our speaking, draw some inspiration from\r\n  a few of the many debts which Liberty and our common country owe to\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  “Ah, my friends, the account is long. We find him early trained as a\r\n  lawyer, and at the age of 32 Major of the New Hampshire Regiment; in\r\n  the spring of 1774, a member of the Provincial Assembly of New\r\n  Hampshire; in September of the same year and in 1775, a delegate to\r\n  the Continental Congress, by which he was in June, 1775, appointed a\r\n  Brigadier-General, and in 1776 a Major-General.\r\n\r\n  “Yet even while he was, at 34, only a New Hampshire Major, he had\r\n  accomplished perhaps the most daring personal feat of the Revolution\r\n  in the seizure of the powder and arms at Fort William and Mary in\r\n  Portsmouth Harbor. Do you realize what that meant? Little more than a\r\n  boy, anticipating, as he always anticipated, troubles to come, he\r\n  dealt a crushing blow to the greatest power on earth, a boy with a\r\n  dozen companions, and he sounded in that one daring act the keynote of\r\n  that grand chorus of Liberty whose majestic final chords were heard in\r\n  the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.\r\n\r\n  “I challenge the world to find a busier or more useful life than his\r\n  for the five years from 1774 to 1779. No wonder, my friends, that no\r\n  memorial can do justice to this. We find him on Winter’s Hill at the\r\n  siege of Boston, working with all the energy of a vigorous manhood and\r\n  high purpose; again at Portsmouth to advise and assist in warding off\r\n  a menaced attack from the British fleet; thence hastily ordered to New\r\n  York to aid General Putnam with a powerful detachment.\r\n\r\n  “The pressing needs of the imperiled American army in Canada caused\r\n  General Washington, in the spring of 1776, to hurry him off with six\r\n  regiments to join its Commander at the earliest possible moment. Do\r\n  you realize, my friends, what a journey to Canada with six regiments—a\r\n  hasty journey—meant in those days? Yet Sullivan was there, only to see\r\n  the death of the Commander whom he had been ordered to assist, from a\r\n  malignant attack of smallpox; and himself suddenly succeeded to the\r\n  place of Chief Commander of the entire expedition.\r\n\r\n  “Nothing could exceed the vigor and discretion of his work as\r\n  Commander of this most difficult expedition. Washington wrote of him\r\n  at this time—and I love to quote of this man who has always been my\r\n  historical ideal the words of the greatest mind in war and peace this\r\n  country has ever known—Washington wrote of him at this time: ‘He is\r\n  active, spirited and zealously attached to the cause. His wants are\r\n  common to us all. He wants experience to move upon a grand scale, for\r\n  the limited and contracted knowledge which any of us have in military\r\n  matters stands in very little stead.’\r\n\r\n  “But Washington’s most competent biographer, Washington Irving,\r\n  declares with emphasis and truth: ‘This want was overbalanced on the\r\n  part of General Sullivan by sound judgment, some acquaintance with men\r\n  and books, and an enterprising genius.’\r\n\r\n  “It is a source of profound regret to the thoughtful student of\r\n  American history that General Sullivan was not left in charge to work\r\n  out the problem of the Canadian expedition. True, he was only\r\n  thirty-six years of age and had had but limited experience, but his\r\n  successful combinations of a few years later leave it more than\r\n  possible that, with him as a leader, the whole of Canada might have\r\n  been added to the United States even at that early day, and the\r\n  Revolution there terminated in half the time it finally lasted.\r\n\r\n  “This was not destined so to be, for Congress somewhat hastily decided\r\n  to commit the command of the Northern army to the much older but, as\r\n  many of us now believe, far less competent hands of General Gates. I\r\n  should not do justice to General Sullivan’s character if I did not\r\n  concede that this replacement caused him some hurt, and I might say\r\n  grief, but his magnanimous and instant efforts in the very moment of\r\n  his return from Canada to serve his country by taking up as temporary\r\n  Commander the perilous work on Long Island which General Greene had\r\n  been compelled by illness to lay down, showed the soldier, the\r\n  gentleman and patriot as no less trying circumstances could.\r\n\r\n  “In the midst of the carnage of the disastrous battle of Long Island,\r\n  Sullivan was taken prisoner. At once paroled and soon after exchanged,\r\n  we find him in December, 1776, hastening to join General Washington.\r\n\r\n  “Let me now turn from the track of this all too historical resumé to\r\n  call your attention to the fact that, when Lord Howe paroled General\r\n  Sullivan, desirous then of accelerating and possibly terminating the\r\n  Rebellion without severance with the colonies, he selected John\r\n  Sullivan as the honored representative of the British Government to\r\n  convey his message to George Washington, and General Sullivan, under\r\n  his own parole, brought from Lord Howe to George Washington the\r\n  propositions which Lord Howe felt he could entrust to no more worthy\r\n  hands than those of this man who was the absolute and the untiring\r\n  enemy of Great Britain. That is a testimonial to General Sullivan\r\n  whose place no monument can take.\r\n\r\n  “In December, 1776, he hastened to join General Washington. On the\r\n  morning of the attack of Trenton, after a night of storm and cold so\r\n  bitter that some of his men were frozen to death and many of his guns\r\n  were rendered wet and useless, he reported to Washington the defective\r\n  condition of his muskets, as was his duty, but was ordered to advance\r\n  and charge, which he did with so much effect that his regiment was\r\n  really the first in action at the lower end of the town.\r\n\r\n  “Next we find him, September 11th, 1777, on the disastrous but\r\n  glorious field of Brandywine, every duty discharged with promptness,\r\n  cool courage and sound discretion and judgment, and even in the\r\n  closing hours of that struggle his was the foremost figure in the\r\n  desperate center of the fray.\r\n\r\n  “Brandywine and its disappointing finish was scarcely over before the\r\n  conflict at Germantown involved him with his division in another\r\n  desperate struggle, where an unfortunate and needless delay by General\r\n  Knox and the sudden rising of a dense and impenetrable fog snatched\r\n  from his hands a victory earned and well earned by every exhibition of\r\n  soldierly quality a commander could give. And even in the hour of\r\n  keenest personal disappointment, balked of a victory he had richly\r\n  earned, a victory which would have set his name ringing around the\r\n  world as its chief author and cause, his thoughts were not of himself,\r\n  but of the personal danger to Washington to whom he gave the lifelong\r\n  devotion which only lives in the breasts of noble men.\r\n\r\n  “Without a pang or plaint of his own peril and disappointment, he\r\n  writes: ‘I saw with great concern our brave Commander-inChief exposing\r\n  himself to the hottest fire of the enemy in such a manner that regard\r\n  for my country obliged me to ride to him and beg him to retire.’ And\r\n  in the longer account of which these words are a part, my friends, not\r\n  a suggestion can be found or guessed of the added peril which the\r\n  writer himself freely braved in the efforts to remove his Chief from\r\n  danger.\r\n\r\n  “This hasty and inadequate resumé of his service in the first two\r\n  years of the Revolution brings us to the great military operation of\r\n  which he was the chief and on which will always rest much of his\r\n  fame—the investment of Rhode Island and the series of movements of\r\n  which the State and coast of Rhode Island formed the picturesque\r\n  theater.\r\n\r\n  “The enterprise was a favorite one with Washington, who hoped, indeed,\r\n  that it would emphasize the French alliance at the outset by an\r\n  overwhelming and successful effect of an attack on the British army\r\n  almost within the sound of our voices. Its success was very dear to\r\n  Washington’s heart, and for it he chose three officers perhaps more\r\n  closely in his confidence and affection than any others in the\r\n  Revolutionary Army. Sullivan was in chief command, with Greene and\r\n  Lafayette as equal subordinate assistants, each having a division\r\n  comprising as nearly as possible half of the army.\r\n\r\n  “The plan of operations had been agreed upon between Washington and\r\n  the French Commander, and the conflict was laid out to be, as it\r\n  should have been, the first great effort of the allied French and\r\n  American forces against the British army of invasion.\r\n\r\n  “I am speaking to an audience whose youngest members should and\r\n  probably do know more of the details of these military movements than\r\n  I can ever hope to know.\r\n\r\n  “From first to last, down to the finest particular of necessary\r\n  prevision, General Sullivan was more than ready. All that a commander\r\n  could do to insure success, he had accomplished so well that the only\r\n  criticism made of his actions was that he had seized the British works\r\n  opposite the north end of the island one day ahead of time. At this,\r\n  the French General who had expected a joint attack to be made the next\r\n  day professed to believe his notions of military etiquette had been\r\n  shocked, but, as no harm resulted and a distinct gain in time had been\r\n  effected, he had small foundation for his complaint, which was soon\r\n  practically abandoned.\r\n\r\n  “There had been an excellent opportunity to make the joint undertaking\r\n  a magnificent success. If, as is now apparent, the attack had been\r\n  made in the latter part of July as it might easily have been in view\r\n  of Sullivan’s perfect preparations and the presence of the French\r\n  fleet, it is probable that the war would have reached a complete and\r\n  glorious close almost within sight of the ground upon which we stand\r\n  today. Postponed as it was from day to day until August 10th, the\r\n  British were given time to reinforce their fleet, hasten it to\r\n  Newport, and there engage the French fleet in dilatory manœuvering\r\n  which used up days of precious time and completely dissipated all hope\r\n  of substantial assistance from the French warships. The expected, or\r\n  that which should have been expected by the naval commanders, soon\r\n  happened; many of us who have spent much time around here would have\r\n  expected it to happen.\r\n\r\n  “About the twentieth of August, one of those storms for which the\r\n  region of Point Judith is famous, set in with almost unexampled fury.\r\n  Land and water forces were alike put out of condition for offensive or\r\n  defensive operations. The French fleet limped away to Boston to refit,\r\n  and Sullivan, deeply chagrined at the utter failure of his naval\r\n  auxiliaries to render any assistance, set to work to protect his army\r\n  and extricate it from a position made perilous by the departure of its\r\n  entire marine support and the consequent desertion of most of his\r\n  militia.\r\n\r\n  “The story of his great achievement in retiring his entire force in\r\n  the face of a vastly superior English army, of the masterly retreat\r\n  covered by his most skilfully selected position at Butts Hill, as I\r\n  believe it is called—as to its proper name, I shall not attempt to\r\n  correct a Rhode Island audience—a retreat effected finally so\r\n  completely that not a man was left behind and not a single article\r\n  lost, while, in the course of that retreat, signal and marked\r\n  punishment was inflicted upon the British army, will ever read like a\r\n  romance of model leadership, and, if General John Sullivan had no\r\n  other memory, my friends, than of what he did within a radius of sixty\r\n  miles of this Capitol, his fame could be no less great and no less\r\n  enduring than it is, and, what is more, would be richly deserved.\r\n\r\n  “Thus briefly, as becomes my scanty time, I have sketched the work of\r\n  John Sullivan to the close of 1778. I have not made the motive of my\r\n  story clear if it has not already appeared that this man was greater\r\n  in the hour of undeserved disappointment than most men in the\r\n  exaltation of victory. Again and again, the fruits of deserved and\r\n  brilliant success were held to his lips, only to be dashed away by the\r\n  folly of the foibles of some weaker spirit necessarily entangled in\r\n  his plans. Yet never for an instant did he yield to the despair and\r\n  mortification which would have sunk less noble souls. Each\r\n  disappointment seemed to but nerve him to stronger and more brilliant\r\n  efforts. And herein, my friends, to my mind, is illustrated and should\r\n  be made prominent one grand characteristic which we have taken from\r\n  the noble Irish race. The patience under disappointment which Major\r\n  General John Sullivan illustrates, the patience under disappointment\r\n  which again and again was manifestly the fault of men to whom he never\r\n  gave a word of rebuke or complaint, the steadfast iron determination\r\n  with which he set to work instantly to repair the ruin that some,\r\n  associated in common with him, had wrought, is the brightest leaf in\r\n  the chaplet which America has put upon his grave.\r\n\r\n  “It is an honor to belong to that grand old race, aye, even to hold\r\n  one drop of Irish blood in your veins, but, good friends all, with or\r\n  without it, I am proud to testify to what Irish friendship, Irish\r\n  loyalty and the matchless Irish courage can do. No man ever knew as I\r\n  have known what Irish friendship is, no man ever knew as I have known\r\n  what Irish hospitality is, no man ever knew as I have known what Irish\r\n  loyalty and patience is, without bowing in humble respect to it,\r\n  whether he drew his blood from France or from Russia, from America or\r\n  from England, each one of which owes Ireland a measureless debt. And\r\n  all who love truth in history and gratitude for priceless gifts\r\n  received, will urge your Society onward every day and hour you labor\r\n  in the work you have so well begun till every heroic son of this great\r\n  line who has helped to build the fabric of American liberty shall have\r\n  his rightful place in history and the laurels he has fairly won.\r\n\r\n  “I have now come to that which, in justice to Major General John\r\n  Sullivan, I think should be related. I shall ask you to turn from the\r\n  beautiful State in which you live to that far off region of beauty in\r\n  which I have the honor to hold my home. In 1778 occurred in Wyoming\r\n  that awful massacre whose horrors yet ring in the history of our\r\n  country and in the hearts of the descendants of those who lost part of\r\n  their families, who lost limb, who lost health, who were maimed, in\r\n  that most horrible of savage invasions. Early in 1779 Congress,\r\n  representing a country which had been shocked to the limit by those\r\n  terrible outrages, passed a resolution of unlimited vigor, calling\r\n  upon Washington to arrange for their punishment. It was suggested at\r\n  first to Washington that General Gates should have the command, but\r\n  Washington, whose knowledge of Indian warfare was complete, wanted\r\n  General Sullivan, and to that officer was entrusted the conduct of\r\n  that great fight.\r\n\r\n  “In the history of Indian warfare in this country there is nothing\r\n  more successful, more thoroughly creditable to the commanding officer,\r\n  than the history of what General John Sullivan and his command did in\r\n  the then wilderness reaching from Wyoming to the Genesee; and today,\r\n  think of him what you may, build to him tablets as beautiful as this,\r\n  recall his manifestly skilful work in the State where you stand, and\r\n  you cannot accord to him one half the veneration and the love which\r\n  the citizens of the counties around me, now a million in number, feel\r\n  towards General John Sullivan for the work which opened up that\r\n  magnificent line of valleys unequalled in their fertility, and whose\r\n  line of bordering hills to this day, one hundred and thirty years\r\n  after, is resounding with thanksgiving and praise for what General\r\n  John Sullivan did there.\r\n\r\n  “Every morning when I look out of my window in the far distance I can\r\n  see in the battlefield which decided the ownership of that region a\r\n  tall and stately monument built by private subscription to General\r\n  Sullivan, to commemorate his work on that bloody day, and just below\r\n  it stands a magnificent marker of granite, placed there by the Sons of\r\n  the American Revolution to mark the very center of the conflict which\r\n  took those valleys away from the possession of the Indians and turned\r\n  them over to civilization and happy and peaceful occupation; and those\r\n  who know the iron will and determined character of John Sullivan know,\r\n  as we do, that when he got through with the Indians and their\r\n  worthless white associates they had no more thirst for blood. Sullivan\r\n  served notice on them and carried it out that if there was any more\r\n  blood shed in that part of the country the Indians would furnish the\r\n  blood.\r\n\r\n  “So perhaps, in an humble way, I have alluded to that feature of\r\n  Sullivans’ life—his closing campaign, which identifies him with\r\n  Northern Pennsylvania and Central New York.\r\n\r\n  “With the close of the campaign of 1779, which may be said to have\r\n  terminated his military career, General Sullivan resigned his\r\n  commission and retired from the army. The constant strain of five\r\n  years almost constantly in active and perilous service had wrecked a\r\n  constitution never of the strongest, and he felt he had given all of\r\n  his life and strength to the cause of Independence.\r\n\r\n  “His resignation was accepted with profound regret, although it was\r\n  universally felt that the reasons for his retirement were imperative.\r\n  Although he lived for fifteen years after his resignation, his health\r\n  was not robust and he died in 1795 at the early age of fifty-four,\r\n  universally admired and lamented. He had, however, no sooner left the\r\n  army than his brilliant legal and forensic talent was seized upon, for\r\n  such services to the country as his health would permit, in the\r\n  legislative halls of the nation, the executive chair of his own State,\r\n  and later upon the Federal Bench.\r\n\r\n  “In 1780–1781 he was a delegate to Congress. In 1782 he was appointed\r\n  the Attorney-General of New Hampshire and was re-appointed to that\r\n  office on the adoption of the new constitution of that State in 1784.\r\n\r\n  “In 1786–1787 he was President and Chief Magistrate of the State of\r\n  New Hampshire, an office equivalent to that of Governor at the present\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  “In 1788 he was speaker of the House of Representatives of New\r\n  Hampshire and President of the Convention that ratified the\r\n  Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n  “In 1789 he was a presidential elector and voted for General\r\n  Washington for President of the United States, and in March of the\r\n  same year he was elected Chief Magistrate of the State for the third\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  “Later in 1789 he was appointed by Washington, his affectionate friend\r\n  and admirer during his whole life, as Judge of the United States\r\n  District Court of New Hampshire, an office which he held with honor to\r\n  himself and the Judiciary until his death in January, 1795.\r\n\r\n  “I have thus briefly sketched the outline of a life which deserves an\r\n  autobiography perfect in every detail and of the highest grade.\r\n  History shows this man in more varied and brilliant lines than almost\r\n  any character in Revolutionary annals. Consider him, my friends, as a\r\n  young lawyer, prompt, keen, resourceful and competent, and you have a\r\n  model of early professional life. Mark him as an active officer of the\r\n  line, reckless of danger, ready to dare all that could be dared,\r\n  willing to do all that he had dared. Mark him again as a commanding\r\n  general, reliable, faithful, prudent and dauntless, unswerved by\r\n  passion, unstained by chagrin, unmarred by envy and uninfluenced by\r\n  clamor, steady and well-poised in the hour of peril or in a moment of\r\n  undeserved injustice. Consider him again, my friends, when after years\r\n  of fierce combat he is chosen for the command of such an expedition as\r\n  I have indicated, which needs great skill in combination and with such\r\n  resources in provision for the needs of a frontier army that his\r\n  success seems impossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON.

CARTER.\r\n\r\n  United States Senator from Montana.\r\n\r\n  One of the Founders of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “And here let me digest for a moment words which, in my own hearing,\r\n  fell from the lips of the distinguished General Slocum, speaking of\r\n  General Sullivan’s great Indian campaign in the presence of General\r\n  Sherman thirty years ago on the one hundreth anniversary of the same.\r\n  General Slocum said:\r\n\r\n  “‘As I have sat listening to the speeches today, I have drawn a\r\n  parallel between those two expeditions. Sherman’s march was the longer\r\n  of the two, but, in many respects, he had greater advantages. While he\r\n  had a great distance to travel he had roads made for him by the enemy;\r\n  he had his produce brought by mule trains; while General Sullivan made\r\n  his march through trackless woods and carried his provisions upon the\r\n  backs of his soldiers. Sherman had good arms; General Sullivan had the\r\n  old flintlock musket. But after all, the spirit which prompted both\r\n  expeditions was the same. It was bold and daring, and, although there\r\n  was no great loss of life in either, yet the results of both were far\r\n  greater than many battles in which lives by the thousand and tens of\r\n  thousands were lost.’\r\n\r\n  “And on the same occasion—it is my excuse for quotations, my friends,\r\n  that I want you to hear these words from two of the greatest Generals\r\n  we have ever known—on the same occasion, remembering then, as we\r\n  remember today, how unjustly General Sullivan was at one time\r\n  criticised for the harshness of his treatment of the Indians on the\r\n  Susquehanna expedition, remembering, too, that he suffered these\r\n  criticisms in silence rather than to lay the blame upon his beloved\r\n  Chief, Washington, who had given him the orders which were condemned,\r\n  I quote from the words of General Sherman, spoken also in my hearing\r\n  on the same occasion:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “‘Our fathers, when they first landed upon this continent, came to\r\n    found an empire, based upon new principles, and all opposition to it\r\n    had to pass away, whether it were English or French on the north, or\r\n    Indians on the west; and no one knew it better than our father,\r\n    Washington. He gave General Sullivan orders to come here and punish\r\n    the Six Nations for their cruel massacre in the valley of Wyoming,\r\n    and to make it so severe that it would not occur again. And he did\r\n    so. General Sullivan obeyed his orders like a man and like a\r\n    soldier, and the result was from that time forward your people\r\n    settled up these beautiful valleys around here, and look at their\r\n    descendants here, a million almost. If it had not been for General\r\n    Sullivan and the men who followed him from Easton, and Clinton’s\r\n    forces that came across from Albany, probably some of you would not\r\n    have been here today.’\r\n\r\n    “I still read: ‘Battles are not measured by their death roll, but by\r\n    their results, and it makes no difference whether one man was killed\r\n    or five hundred if the same result follows. This valley was opened\r\n    to civilization. It came on the heels of General Sullivan’s army,\r\n    and has gone on and gone on until today. The same battle is raging\r\n    upon the Yellow Stone. The same men endowed by the same feelings\r\n    that General Sullivan’s army had today are contending with the same\r\n    causes and the same races two thousand miles west of here, not for\r\n    the purpose of killing, not for the purpose of shedding blood, not\r\n    for the purpose of doing wrong at all, but to prepare the way for\r\n    that civilization which must go along wherever yonder flag floats.’\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It might be thought perhaps, my friends, that this rehearsal of the\r\n  opinions of General Sherman and General Slocum, two of the greatest\r\n  military leaders of our country, might have been more properly used\r\n  here than on the dedication of a tablet somewhat, in its scope as a\r\n  memorial, limited to your own State, but it has been my purpose, my\r\n  friends, to illustrate General Sullivan as one of the most admirable\r\n  representatives of his race; and when I have set before you a parallel\r\n  drawn in the presence of General Sherman himself between the\r\n  difficulties and the success of Sullivan’s march from Wyoming to the\r\n  Genesee and Sherman’s own march to the sea, and have given you the\r\n  opinions of both General Sherman and General Slocum, I have\r\n  illustrated my proposition that of all the debts which America owes to\r\n  Ireland, God bless her, General John Sullivan, in his varied talents,\r\n  in that which he accomplished, in every spot and place in which we put\r\n  him, is entitled to rank with the noblest and purest contribution\r\n  which we, in America, have from the grand old Irish race.\r\n\r\n  “My friends, my words are in substance ended. I have detained you\r\n  longer than I meant to, but they who live around me could have told\r\n  you that you have only to mention the name and memory of Major-General\r\n  John Sullivan to set going any thoughtful student of American history\r\n  who lives in the magnificent valleys of the Susquehanna, the Wyoming,\r\n  and the Genesee. What we owe to this man we can never repay.\r\n\r\n  “I am proud and happy to have been allowed to participate in the\r\n  unveiling of such a tribute as this. As I said at the outset, I hope\r\n  the day will come when every State House in this land will have one,\r\n  and yet, when I think of what he was and what we owe him, I feel that\r\n  no monument can make him greater than he is in the affections of our\r\n  people a hundred and thirty years after his death. And yet I am proud\r\n  for our own sake, for the uplifting of our own people, that we have\r\n  thus recognized that which we know of his worth. I might have spoken\r\n  in his behalf with truth the words of the great Roman: ‘_Exegi\r\n  monumentum aere perennius_’—‘I have builded a monument more enduring\r\n  than brass.’”\r\n\r\n  Former Governor Lippitt was the next speaker, introduced by the\r\n  Chairman as follows: “One of our invited guests, representing the\r\n  Society of the Cincinnati, is obliged to go to a neighboring city\r\n  within the next hour to deliver an address, and we will not have the\r\n  pleasure of his company at our luncheon or the benefit of any words\r\n  from him afterwards. I will therefore introduce him at once.\r\n\r\n  “As General Sullivan was one of the original members of the Society of\r\n  the Cincinnati, it is singularly fitting that we call on an honored\r\n  Rhode Islander, whose father as well as himself has served the state\r\n  as Governor, and whose devotion to the history and affairs of the\r\n  commonwealth has given him a well deserved position as an authority on\r\n  his subject.\r\n\r\n  “It gives me great pleasure to introduce Hon. Charles Warren Lippitt,\r\n  ex-Governor of Rhode Island.”\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Chairman, Members of the American Irish Historical Society,\r\n  Ladies and Gentlemen: I feel surprised at finding myself somewhat\r\n  unexpectedly in this position, but will try to aid in honoring this\r\n  occasion.\r\n\r\n  “Veneration for General Sullivan, for his services on the Island of\r\n  Rhode Island, and for his noble victory, has always been mine. That he\r\n  was of Irish extraction, and that his ancestors, like those of all the\r\n  rest of us who are not descended from Indians, emigrated from a home\r\n  land to this new country in the western hemisphere, is well known. My\r\n  descent is from the English, with a strain of the French and the\r\n  German races rather than from the Irish. No one in any way familiar\r\n  with American history can hesitate an instant in according to the\r\n  Hibernians the honor of many noble actions and the respect due to\r\n  sacrifice of untold value, in every emergency of our common country.\r\n\r\n  “General Sullivan came of a sturdy race. His father was born during\r\n  the siege of Limerick, away back in 1691, of such good stock that he\r\n  outlived the century and did not pass away until 1796, at the age of\r\n  one hundred and five. It was his son that gave so much of his life and\r\n  energy, his intelligence and ability, to the cause of American\r\n  freedom. That he served with distinction in the Continental Army goes\r\n  without question. That he was at Trenton the night before Christmas\r\n  and aided in the defeat and capture of that hated Hessian contingent\r\n  that had been marauding up and down New Jersey is also an established\r\n  fact. It is equally true that with the three Rhode Island regiments,\r\n  forming a material part of Washington’s army, he braved the elements\r\n  in that historic night march from Trenton to Princeton, fought the\r\n  next morning in the battle of Princeton, and successfully assisted in\r\n  driving Cornwallis out of New Jersey. It was the crisis of the\r\n  Revolution. In that time of stress and doubt John Sullivan, the\r\n  descendant of an Irishman, like so many others of his race, stood\r\n  shoulder to shoulder with the descendants of the English and the\r\n  French in securing for us and the millions that have inhabited this\r\n  land the priceless privileges of liberty.\r\n\r\n  “His course in the Genesee Valley and the very proper punishment he\r\n  administered to the savages who committed the horrible massacre at\r\n  Wyoming has been eloquently traced. His campaign in Rhode Island has,\r\n  perhaps, been studied in rather more detail in this neighborhood than\r\n  in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\n  “History records and practically every American schoolboy can tell how\r\n  the Americans fought at the battle of Bunker Hill. Wherever the\r\n  Revolution is known there is an intimate knowledge of that great\r\n  conflict. We all of us glory in its story, and remember with gratitude\r\n  and sympathy the bravery of those untrained patriots who administered\r\n  such a fearful blow to British power and prestige.\r\n\r\n  “Compare for a moment the battle on Rhode Island and the results\r\n  secured by Sullivan’s generalship with the circumstances and the issue\r\n  on that hill near Boston. The loss of the English at Bunker Hill was\r\n  1,054 men, that of the Americans 449. Until the British entered the\r\n  redoubt, the Americans fought behind entrenchments. In the third\r\n  attack the British captured the redoubt, drove the Americans from the\r\n  hill, and retained undisputed control of the battlefield.\r\n\r\n  “In the campaign on Rhode Island the inability of the French to\r\n  control the sea obliged the Americans to retire to Butts Hill. In the\r\n  valley separating it from Quaker, Turkey and Anthony hills,\r\n  immediately south, a battle was fought, not behind entrenchments, but\r\n  in the broad open, where each army had equal advantages and success\r\n  was won by brilliant tactics and skill and spirit in using weapons. In\r\n  the retreat and in the battle between the nearby Rhode Island hills,\r\n  the English lost 1,023 and the Americans 211. After repulsing two\r\n  vigorously and pertinaciously pressed charges of the English army, the\r\n  Americans were obliged in the early afternoon to face a last violent\r\n  onset that almost broke the right wing of Sullivan’s army under the\r\n  immediate command of General Greene. Jackson’s regiment connected with\r\n  Colonel Livingston’s detachment, that had contested during the early\r\n  morning the British advance up the island, after a needed rest on the\r\n  north side of Butts hill were marched around the rear of the army, by\r\n  Sullivan’s direction, to the extreme right of General Greene’s\r\n  command. The British and Hessians charged down the slope of Anthony\r\n  hill and were met in the valley by Greene’s somewhat exhausted forces.\r\n  It was the final struggle for victory. At this critical moment Colonel\r\n  Livingston led Jackson’s regiment, using the cold steel, in a fierce\r\n  onslaught against the enemy’s flank that gave the British the final\r\n  blow and sent them scurrying up the slope of Anthony hill to their\r\n  entrenchments on the top. The Americans, closely following the flying\r\n  foe, captured Brady’s battery as an evidence of their victory.\r\n\r\n  “The Americans maintained absolute control of the battlefield. Colonel\r\n  Campbell of the Twenty-Second British Regiment sent to General\r\n  Sullivan the day after the battle and asked permission to search among\r\n  the dead for the body of his nephew, who had been killed the day\r\n  before by his side, but whose body he could not remove they were so\r\n  closely pursued.\r\n\r\n  “The Battle of Rhode Island was a gratifying success for the\r\n  Americans. Victory was due to the skill, the intelligence, the courage\r\n  and the audacity of General Sullivan, and to his brave officers and\r\n  men. Lafayette characterized it as ‘the best fought action of the\r\n  war,’ and the statement accords the highest compliment to the military\r\n  skill of General John Sullivan.\r\n\r\n  “It is a great pleasure to participate with so many friends in\r\n  expressing our high appreciation of the services of Sullivan that have\r\n  been so adequately and happily recognized by the American Irish\r\n  Historical Society. It is an intense gratification to contemplate the\r\n  success of these ceremonies and to sincerely join in congratulation\r\n  and in commendation of efforts that have resulted in adorning this\r\n  noble State House with this beautiful, substantial and enduring tablet\r\n  to our heroic dead.”\r\n\r\n  President-General Quinlan of the Society was then introduced by the\r\n  Chairman, as follows: “I have the pleasure now to call upon the\r\n  President-General of the American Irish Historical Society, under\r\n  whose careful and enthusiastic administration it has been possible to\r\n  erect and dedicate this tablet. There never has been a time when his\r\n  efforts, his energy, and all his powers were not at our disposal.\r\n  There never has been a time when we have called on him for anything\r\n  since the memorial has been under way that he has not promptly and\r\n  vigorously responded. I have the great honor of introducing to you,\r\n  ladies and gentlemen, our President-General, Francis J. Quinlan, M.\r\n  D., L. L. D., of New York City.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident-General Quinlan said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Chairman, your Excellency, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen:\r\n  Before I attempt to say a few words in honor of the auspicious event\r\n  of this day, I will take occasion to render the tribute of my personal\r\n  thanks and of the collective thanks of our Society to the\r\n  distinguished assemblage gathered here to do honor to our illustrious\r\n  hero by the loyal support of their presence.\r\n\r\n  “I take occasion, first of all, to thank the Ex-Governors, the present\r\n  Governor, the Governor-elect, and the Department of the G. A. R., an\r\n  association that to me is representative of the rarest and choicest\r\n  texture of the loom of American Independence. (I would rather wear\r\n  their button than be decorated by one hundred kings.) To those who\r\n  represent the Society of Colonial Wars I extend my heartfelt thanks\r\n  for their presence. To the Daughters of the American Revolution and to\r\n  the distinguished Sons, as well as to the Sons of Veterans and also\r\n  the illustrious Society whose early achievements in this country need\r\n  no word of commendation from me,—the Society of the Cincinnati,—to\r\n  them and to their representatives I extend my thanks and my greetings.\r\n  To the Rhode Island Citizens’ Historical Association I also offer\r\n  welcome. To those who are associated with none, but whose attendance\r\n  is due to their interest in these exercises, I am thankful for their\r\n  presence here today.\r\n\r\n  “Now, ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the stirring notes of\r\n  welcome that have rung out in this beautiful building, the tributes\r\n  that have been paid by those gentlemen, one of them with a line of\r\n  nine generations of pure and unsullied English blood. What further\r\n  tribute do we need, what other ratification or emphasis do we require\r\n  than that which comes from one whose nation held us in subjugation,\r\n  with its heel of tyranny upon our neck, for seven hundred years, when\r\n  this offspring, eager to forget past enmities, frankly tells us in\r\n  tones of eloquence that the Irish have been and always will remain\r\n  loyal and true and constant and devoted to every cause they espouse!\r\n  We need but little further argument to justify our existence, but it\r\n  behooves me, on an occasion of this kind, not apologetically, but in\r\n  bold words, to explain the purpose of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society.\r\n\r\n  “It has been truly said by the Chairman of this meeting that this\r\n  Society was born in the City of Boston in the year 1897, for the study\r\n  of American history generally, as well as to trace the immigration of\r\n  the people of Ireland to this country, to correct erroneous and\r\n  distorted views of history in relation to the Irish people in America,\r\n  and to encourage and promote the formation of local associations in\r\n  American cities and towns as aids in the work of the parent Society.\r\n  These purposes have been so enlarged upon by the Chairman that they\r\n  need no word of encouragement from me.\r\n\r\n  “You know that the tide of immigration turned to this country in the\r\n  last century. Irish people haven’t always been immigrants. Nine\r\n  hundred years before Columbus set sail from Palos, Spain, a bishop of\r\n  the old faith named Brendan left his home in Galway, sailed over the\r\n  sea, visited Iceland and Greenland, and there are today evidences of\r\n  this man’s presence in Delaware and Virginia—nine hundred years before\r\n  Columbus set foot on this continent. Even in the very crew which made\r\n  up the contingent in Columbus’ navy which manned the three ships there\r\n  was one to whom, when Columbus left, he gave the custody of one of\r\n  those ships, and this man’s record proves he was an Irishman, William\r\n  Ayer of Galway. We have historical facts; they cannot be gainsaid;\r\n  they stand out in bas-relief today; the story is plain and intelligent\r\n  men accept it.\r\n\r\n  “Immigration! Do you know that as the years have gone by they have\r\n  witnessed immigration from many lands? Germany has furnished us with\r\n  some of the best bone and sinew of its country. England, through her\r\n  unwise laws, through her erring principles of justice, exacted from\r\n  the Irish people something that they would not give—taxation without\r\n  representation, and surrender of civic and religious liberty. Deprived\r\n  of everything that men in common hold dear, deprived of education, of\r\n  religious worship, they were driven from the shores of Ireland and\r\n  found the arms of Columbia extended and ready to receive them as\r\n  children. We came here, and we thank England for sending us here. If\r\n  it hadn’t been for the conditions of a hundred and fifty years ago, we\r\n  might be toiling there today. It is a wise Providence that directs and\r\n  overrules conditions. We came, and this asylum was beautiful, the flag\r\n  of freedom and union waved for us, everything was lovely compared with\r\n  what we had left behind. Friends and kindred, religion and society\r\n  grew up within our own experiences. The warm heart of the Irishman\r\n  broadened; he grew, and when the country rang out the alarm, when the\r\n  country announced that it was menaced with danger, in that Irish boy’s\r\n  ears rang the traditions and the wrongs of ages. He buckled on his\r\n  belt; he took down the flintlock from the wall; he marched forward\r\n  anywhere, everywhere, under the command of Washington and\r\n  Sullivan,—Washington, the ideal, and Sullivan, the son of an Irish\r\n  exile. These were the traits exhibited.\r\n\r\n  “‘Theirs not to reason why—not to make reply—but to do and die.’ These\r\n  men made it possible for you and for me to live to enjoy the\r\n  conditions of today, to be here in this temple of local pride.\r\n\r\n  “I am reminded of the story so beautifully told in Roman history of\r\n  the mother who once paid a visit to a wealthy matron of that glorious\r\n  republic so many centuries ago. After dinner the matron said, ‘Now I\r\n  must show you my beautiful jewels.’ They were carefully guarded, but\r\n  she displayed them to the eyes of her visitor, and then remarked, ‘You\r\n  must show me your jewels when I go to your house.’ In turn she called\r\n  upon the mother, and stayed a little longer than is usual, awaiting\r\n  the exhibition of jewels. Finally she inquired, ‘Have you forgotten to\r\n  show me your jewels?’ ‘Oh, no,’ the mother replied. ‘Come this way,’\r\n  and as she threw open a door five beautiful children were revealed.\r\n  ‘These,’ she exclaimed, ‘are my jewels.’\r\n\r\n  “People of Rhode Island, these noble patriots and these scarred flags\r\n  are your sacred jewels. Guard their memory, defend it, and, as your\r\n  blood has the rich central vein of patriotism, so sacrifice all you\r\n  have to keep these jewels sacredly enshrined in your hearts forever.\r\n\r\n  “I would that Sullivan could get a day’s leave from his sacred parole.\r\n  I would that he could come back to us today, that he might obtain from\r\n  the St. Gabriel of St. Peter’s Gate a day’s leave of absence to look\r\n  at these pillars and to gaze about these corridors. We almost hear the\r\n  whisper, can almost note the footfall of a strange presence here. It\r\n  is the spirit of the Revolutionary hero that communes with us; it is\r\n  the lofty emotion that emanates from him, though unseen, and which\r\n  commends our spirit of patriotism and ratifies our act, not to him\r\n  individually but to the noble band of which he was Captain.\r\n\r\n  “This is a great day for Rhode Island. This is a great day for\r\n  America, because this afternoon and tomorrow the wave of thought that\r\n  is ours will extend beyond us and be carried everywhere to receptive\r\n  minds. The sunlight will dash it into every possible nook and corner\r\n  of the land; the rivers will take it down to the Mexican slope; the\r\n  whole country will vibrate with it. You who know the history of the\r\n  man we honor, cherish it in your memory, and when you recall these\r\n  exercises, congratulate yourself that in assisting at them you have\r\n  fulfilled a duty; one and all, you have paid the homage of a great and\r\n  noble State.\r\n\r\n  “One moment more, my friends. I have tarried long. This page stands\r\n  out alone in the history of this Society of which I have the honor and\r\n  rare privilege of being the Executive. Ladies and gentlemen, that\r\n  Society has one purpose; that purpose is written between the lines of\r\n  today’s event. We want to know the men who have lived, who have\r\n  fought, who have bled, who have given everything to the cause of the\r\n  American people. We want to record their deeds in order that the womb\r\n  of the future may bring forth a race, generations distant from us,\r\n  that will stand up and say, ‘I, too, am Irish, although I have six\r\n  generations separating me from that blood,’ a race that will cherish\r\n  everything Irish and will extend the open hand of welcome to everyone\r\n  who bears the hall mark of Ireland, whether his religion be Catholic\r\n  or Protestant.\r\n\r\n  “We are broad, we are honest, we are liberal. We want to attack no\r\n  man, but when we peruse the pages of American history, when we turn\r\n  over volume after volume, chapter after chapter, page after page, and\r\n  search paragraph after paragraph, line after line, syllable after\r\n  syllable, and see no recognition of the services of Irishmen, our\r\n  hearts bleed because the omission is culpable and not due to the fact\r\n  that the historian could find no achievements to make good his lines.\r\n\r\n  “We claim our place in this Republic. We have sacrificed everything in\r\n  the world for it. We would go further tomorrow and pledge every\r\n  security, sever ourselves from home, to protect our freedom and these\r\n  flags. The United States is ours, whether on the shores of California,\r\n  Maine, Texas, or Washington. There is one freedom, one brotherhood of\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n  “I could detain you longer, friends, but the time allotted me forbids.\r\n  I have lingered longer than I should, but I know of no sentiment with\r\n  which I might more fittingly conclude than that of one of your great\r\n  New England worthies, the man who is enshrined in the sanctuary of\r\n  your hearts, John Boyle O’Reilly. He says, in his own peculiar but\r\n  grand way:\r\n\r\n  “‘No treason we bring from Erin, nor bring we shame nor guilt!\r\n  The sword we hold may be broken, but we have not dropped the hilt.\r\n  The wreath we bear to Columbia is twisted to thorns, not bays;\r\n  And the songs we sing are saddened by thoughts of desolate days.\r\n  But the hearts we bring for freedom are washed in the surge of tears;\r\n  And we claim our right by a people’s fight outliving a thousand\r\n     years.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Doctor Quinlan’s address the Chairman declared the\r\nceremonies of dedication over, thanking all those present for their\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe several organizations were represented at the dedication as follows:\r\nSociety of the Cincinnati, Ex-Governor Charles Warren Lippitt,\r\nEx-Governor George H.

In my nomination of persons to fill office in the\r\n  Judicial Department, I have been guided by the importance of the\r\n  object, considering it of the first magnitude and the pillar upon\r\n  which our political fabric must rest.\r\n\r\n  “I have endeavored to bring into the high offices of its\r\n  administration such characters as will give stability and dignity to\r\n  our national Government; and I persuade myself that they will discover\r\n  a due desire to promote the happiness of our Country by a ready\r\n  acceptance of their several appointments. The laws which have passed\r\n  relative to your office accompany the Commission.\r\n\r\n               “I am Sir with very great esteem\r\n                           “Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                       “GEORGE WASHINGTON.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Committee having in charge the erection and dedication of the\r\nmemorial were: Thomas Zanslaur Lee, Chairman; Patrick J.

C., JANUARY 16, 1909, AND OF THE\r\n    RECEPTION TO THE SOCIETY BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt having been voted at the annual meeting at New York January 29, 1908,\r\nto hold the next annual meeting at Washington, D. C.; the Executive\r\nCouncil at a well-attended meeting thereof held at the residence of the\r\nPresident-General, December 5, 1908, considered the necessary\r\narrangements, and resolved to make this event a notable one in the\r\nSociety’s history. A committee previously appointed by the\r\nPresident-General to confer with Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, President of\r\nthe United States, and ascertain his pleasure as to a reception to the\r\nSociety and attendance later at the dinner, reported that owing to\r\npressure of official business President Roosevelt would be unable to\r\nattend the Society’s dinner, but would be pleased to meet his\r\nfellow-members at the White House and there make a short address.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the instruction of the Executive Council the\r\nSecretary-General opened correspondence with Mr. William Loeb, Jr.,\r\nSecretary to President Roosevelt, and the details of the reception were\r\npromptly arranged.\r\n\r\nPresident-General Quinlan thereupon appointed a Reception Committee to\r\nofficiate at the White House and afterwards be on duty at the Society’s\r\nheadquarters in Washington, and a Dinner Committee to arrange all the\r\ndetails of the annual banquet.\r\n\r\nThe appointees on these committees appear in the circular letter which\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe Dinner Committee carefully looked over the available places in\r\nWashington suitable for the annual banquet, and decided upon the Hotel\r\nRaleigh as most desirable, not only for this purpose but also for the\r\nheadquarters of the Society.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas J. Talty, the manager of the Hotel Raleigh, extended the\r\nCommittee every courtesy and made their work in the Society’s behalf\r\neasy and pleasant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. EDWARD J.

Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United\r\n  States, will receive the Society at the White House at 2.30 p. m.\r\n  Secretary Loeb requests us to be on time and provide each member with\r\n  a card of identification. Such a card is enclosed and must be\r\n  presented to the doorkeeper at the White House. Ladies and guests may\r\n  accompany members, and tickets for them can be obtained from the\r\n  Acting Secretary-General upon application of any member by mail or on\r\n  the day of the Reception.\r\n\r\n  Members whose convenience will permit will leave New York Saturday\r\n  morning, January 16, 1909, from West 23d Street station at 7.50 a. m.,\r\n  or from Liberty Street station at 8 a. m., to take the Royal Blue Line\r\n  train leaving Jersey City at 8.12 a. m., arriving in Washington at\r\n  1.12 p. m. Reduced round trip rates have been arranged for on this\r\n  line, a dining-car will be attached for our comfort and convenience,\r\n  and this is the only train landing us in Washington in time to get to\r\n  our quarters at the hotel and be in season for the President’s\r\n  Reception.\r\n\r\n  Immediately after the President’s Reception, the annual meeting of the\r\n  Society will be held in the parlors of the Hotel Raleigh, where the\r\n  Society’s headquarters will be established, for the election of\r\n  officers for the ensuing year, the receiving and acting upon\r\n  resolutions on the death of several prominent members of the Society,\r\n  including our deeply-lamented Secretary-General, and the transaction\r\n  of such other business as may come before the meeting. The resolutions\r\n  and eulogies to be offered are of a high order.\r\n\r\n  At the termination of the business meeting, opportunity will be given\r\n  to visit the capitol, Congressional Library, public buildings,\r\n  historical societies, and other points of interest in Washington.\r\n\r\n  The tickets for the dinner are $5.00 each and may be obtained from the\r\n  Acting Secretary-General, whose address is below. It is very important\r\n  that we know exactly how many members are to be present, and you are\r\n  earnestly requested to send your remittance for tickets promptly so\r\n  that we may notify Mr. Talty of the Hotel Raleigh how many he may\r\n  expect. Members may invite guests at the same price per ticket.\r\n\r\n  The Reception to the members of the Society by its officers will take\r\n  place in the parlors of the Hotel Raleigh at 6.30 p. m., and this will\r\n  be an excellent opportunity for exchange of good fellowship with the\r\n  new members, nearly one hundred and fifty of whom have been elected\r\n  during the past year.

I., Jan. 11, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large party of members and guests availed themselves of the pleasure\r\nof the special train, and our comfort was well cared for by Mr. Joyce,\r\nably assisted by Mr. P. Wilfred Heroy, Eastern Passenger Agent of the\r\nCentral Railroad of New Jersey, and a picked train crew.\r\n\r\nOwing to a severe snowstorm encountered _en route_, it became evident\r\nthe special would not reach Washington on scheduled time, and a telegram\r\nto Secretary Loeb was sent from Baltimore as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Special train of American Irish Historical Society unavoidably\r\n  delayed _en route_. Regret inability to reach White House before two\r\n  forty-five.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that no time should be lost, orders were given the train crew\r\nto take the baggage of each passenger to the Hotel Raleigh, there to be\r\ncared for until our return from the White House.\r\n\r\nThe following copy of the order given by C. H. English, Passenger\r\nTrainmaster of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, providing for\r\nthe running of the special train, is interesting and gives us an idea of\r\nthe amount of detail necessary to clear the way for the operation of a\r\ntrain on an up-to-date railroad, and the people to whom orders must go:\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n                            Central Division.\r\n\r\n                                   JERSEY CITY, N.

ENGLISH,\r\n                                                _Passenger Trainmaster_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dinner Committee was on hand to meet the train and special street\r\ncars were in readiness to take us to the Reception.\r\n\r\nNearly 300 members and guests were in attendance at the White House when\r\nPresident Roosevelt made his appearance, accompanied by his military\r\nattendants. He was in excellent spirits and pleased to see so large a\r\nrepresentation of the Society in Washington.\r\n\r\nIn introducing President Roosevelt to the assemblage, President-General\r\nQuinlan said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Ladies and Gentlemen, I am especially honored today in presenting to\r\n  you the gifted ruler of our great nation, one who at all times has\r\n  shown true sympathy with our cause and who has recorded his feeling by\r\n  associating himself with our Society. It is with feelings of mingled\r\n  pride and satisfaction that I introduce to you our fellow-member, Mr.\r\n  Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is a great pleasure to me to bid you welcome to Washington, and\r\n  especially to have the chance of saying a word of greeting to you here\r\n  in the White House. I am sorry we didn’t give you a little better\r\n  weather, and I especially regret that, in view of the fact that so\r\n  many of you have had the wisdom to bring your better halves with you;\r\n  for I have always insisted that, while the average American citizen is\r\n  a pretty good fellow, his wife is a still better fellow.\r\n\r\n  “I need scarcely say the great interest that I take in the work of\r\n  this body. Here on this continent we are building up a great new\r\n  nation, a nation akin to, but different from, each of the Old World\r\n  nations of middle and western Europe. To this country have come men of\r\n  many different origins, and here they are being fused together into a\r\n  new type, and it is greatly to be desired that we should have\r\n  historical associations like this which shall commemorate the\r\n  different strains in the national blood.\r\n\r\n  “It is a mistake to suppose, as is so often assumed, that at the time\r\n  of the Revolution our people were not of mixed blood. They were then,\r\n  just as they are now. Many different strains from the beginning\r\n  contributed to make up what is now American citizenship, and from the\r\n  beginning in this country the men who themselves, or whose fathers,\r\n  came from Ireland have played a great and leading part in the affairs\r\n  of the nation. I myself have some of that blood in me, and doubtless\r\n  this accounts for the difficulties with which I have found myself\r\n  confronted at times. It may also account for my disposition after\r\n  getting into a fight to let the other fellow know I was in it. I thank\r\n  you, ladies and gentlemen, for coming here.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was great applause and much enthusiasm upon the well-chosen words,\r\nand afterwards the assemblage formed in line and each person was\r\npresented to President Roosevelt by President-General Quinlan and Hon.\r\nEdward A.

This arrangement was made prior to the time when the date\r\n  of the reception to your Society was fixed, and it is incumbent upon\r\n  me to be present, and while I fully intended going to Washington and\r\n  attending the reception, and so expressed myself to Judge Dowling,\r\n  who, I understand, is to deliver an address, yet I now realize the\r\n  impracticability of being in two places at the same time, and will\r\n  therefore have to forego the pleasure of being there.\r\n\r\n  I trust you will appreciate my position, and I assure you that\r\n  ordinarily I would be only too glad to break any engagement I might\r\n  have and avail myself of the pleasure of being present on such an\r\n  occasion, but in reaching a decision I could not do otherwise than\r\n  give way in favor of the engagement which was prior in point of time.\r\n\r\n  I deeply appreciate your kind expressions, and the more than\r\n  attractive manner in which you urge me to be present, all of which\r\n  would be unnecessary in any matter in which you were concerned,\r\n  because the mere expression of your wish that you desired my\r\n  co-operation in any of the good works in which you are interested\r\n  would always receive from me a prompt response.\r\n\r\n  With kind regards personally, believe me to be,\r\n\r\n                                           Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n           FRANCIS J.

I.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Mr. Lee_: I have received your several communications in\r\n  regard to the meeting and annual dinner on January 16 at Washington,\r\n  and I planned to go, but things have so shaped themselves that I find\r\n  it impossible to leave at this time. I certainly regret very much my\r\n  inability to attend, but do wish you all possible success.\r\n\r\n           Believe me,         Yours respectfully,\r\n                                               THOMAS J.

I.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Judge_: I have to thank you for your letter of the 13th\r\n  inst., but regret that I shall not be able to leave New York on\r\n  Saturday to attend the meeting of our Society in Washington. Herewith\r\n  I give you my check for $5 to cover the amount of my dues for the\r\n  current year.\r\n\r\n  Wishing you a very delightful trip and a good time at the convention,\r\n  I remain,\r\n\r\n                                     Yours very truly,\r\n                                                         WILLIS B.

I.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Sir_: The Mayor has been sick since Friday of last week, and\r\n  although he is now out of bed the doctor positively forbids him to\r\n  make a trip to Washington. He sent a message to me requesting me to\r\n  notify you of this fact and to express to you his deep regret. I know\r\n  he was looking forward with very pleasant anticipation to this trip\r\n  and to his meeting with you again.\r\n\r\n  I find in the mail two tickets to the banquet and not appreciating the\r\n  situation fully I am enclosing them to you, thinking that you may be\r\n  able to make some use of them as long as the Mayor can not go, but if\r\n  these are sent out and charged to the persons to whom they are sent,\r\n  you will please advise the Mayor and he will send you the cost of the\r\n  same.\r\n\r\n                           Yours very respectfully,\r\n                                       JOS.

THOMAS Z. LEE,\r\n      Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Sir_: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of a ticket to\r\n  the annual banquet of the American Irish Historical Society, to be\r\n  held at Hotel Raleigh January 16, 1909, at 7 p. m., and sincerely\r\n  thank you for the favor.\r\n\r\n  Will endeavor to be present, but on account of business appointments\r\n  that I have about that time that will take me away from Washington and\r\n  probably will not allow my return in time, would suggest that you do\r\n  not figure on my making any remarks at the meeting.\r\n\r\n  With best wishes for the Society’s success,\r\n\r\n                                        Very truly yours,\r\n                                                        BIRD S.

I cannot, much as I regret it,\r\n  find a way to be with you and our friends to share in the festivities.\r\n  That you will have an edifying and jolly good time goes without saying\r\n  and I regret exceedingly my inability to share in it. With cordial\r\n  best wishes,\r\n\r\n                                      Sincerely yours,\r\n                                                          A. C.

THOMAS ZANSLAUR LEE,\r\n      Providence, Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Mr. Lee_: It is with sincere regret that I am compelled to\r\n  advise you of my inability to participate in the annual exercises of\r\n  the American Irish Historical Society in Washington, D. C., January\r\n  16. I assure you it is a grievous disappointment to me, but conditions\r\n  are such that it will be impossible for me to leave Utah at the\r\n  present time.\r\n\r\n  Please convey to my fellow-members my very best wishes for the\r\n  continued prosperity of the Society.

BARRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             29 BEACON STREET, BOSTON, January 13, 1909.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Judge Lee_: The meeting in Washington comes at the time of our\r\n  annual firm meeting and I regret exceedingly I shall not be able to be\r\n  with you. I trust you will have an enthusiastic meeting.\r\n\r\n                                           Cordially yours,\r\n                                                       THOMAS B. LAWLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        BOSTON, MASS., January 15, 1909.\r\n\r\n  MR. THOMAS Z. LEE,\r\n      _Acting Secretary-General, The American Irish Historical Society_,\r\n                                  49 Westminster Street, Providence, R.\r\n                                     I.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Mr. Lee_: Your esteemed favor of the 6th inst. reached me\r\n  during a trip in the West and I appreciate very much indeed your\r\n  remembrance of me by your kind invitation to be the guest of your\r\n  Society at the annual banquet in Washington, D. C., on the evening of\r\n  January 16, at the Hotel Raleigh, and also to attend with you a\r\n  reception at the White House by President Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n  Although it will be impossible for me to accept these courtesies, I\r\n  beg to express my great appreciation of the same and to assure you\r\n  that it will always be my pleasure to at any time entertain the\r\n  Society at my home in Lexington whenever it is their pleasure to visit\r\n  our good old town.\r\n\r\n                                     Very sincerely yours,\r\n                                                         GEO. W. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     ELIZABETH, N. J., January 15, 1909.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Judge_: My absence this evening I exceedingly regret. I trust\r\n  the dinner and meeting will be pleasant and interesting. What heart\r\n  does not dilate with feelings to this night’s occasion, and what a\r\n  host of interesting recollections spring up in the mind when we\r\n  reflect upon the time when Irishmen came to the shores of this country\r\n  in the spirit of holy zeal, leaving the land of their birth, braving\r\n  the winds of Heaven and the angry wrath of the mighty Atlantic,\r\n  landing in the wilderness and planting the seeds of a holy religion as\r\n  well as laying the foundation of the mighty and greatest of all\r\n  republics.\r\n\r\n  I am with you in spirit this evening and I hope the effects of our\r\n  good Society will establish its prestige in every city and town of\r\n  this country of ours.\r\n\r\n                                           Yours fraternally,\r\n                                                       JAMES L. O’NEILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NORFOLK, VA., January 15, 1909.\r\n\r\n  To the American Irish Historical Society,\r\n\r\n  Hotel Raleigh, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_: Until today it was my intention and hope to be with you\r\n  in Washington tomorrow. Conditions beyond control will prevent,\r\n  consequently my greetings must be conveyed by mail.\r\n\r\n                            Fraternally yours,\r\n                                        JAMES W. MCCARRICK,\r\n                                            Vice-President for Virginia.\r\n\r\n  Mr. T. Z. LEE,\r\n      _Acting Secretary-General_,\r\n          49 Westminster Street, Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Patrick M. Keating presented and read the following memorial to the\r\nlate Hon. Thomas J. Gargan, former President-General of the Society,\r\nwhich was adopted by unanimous vote:\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MEMORIAL OF THOMAS J. GARGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The members of the American Irish Historical Society by this memorial\r\n  desire to pay a tribute of love and respect to the memory of their\r\n  late associate and President-General, Thomas J. Gargan, and to express\r\n  their appreciation of his character and ability and their recognition\r\n  of the great loss the Society has sustained in his death.\r\n\r\n  “His parents were among the pioneer Irish emigrants who came to this\r\n  country in the early part of the nineteenth century and settled in\r\n  Boston, where he was born about sixty-six years ago.\r\n\r\n  “In early life he was engaged in mercantile pursuits, but the practice\r\n  of law strongly attracted him and he was admitted to the bar in the\r\n  year 1875. As a lawyer he was not merely a successful practitioner,\r\n  but an ornament to the profession, scorning to descend to dishonorable\r\n  tactics or to adopt the acts of a pettifogger.\r\n\r\n  “He filled various positions of honor and responsibility, both public\r\n  and private, faithfully and efficiently. He took an active part in\r\n  causes that brought into requisition the zeal, sympathy and interest\r\n  of worthy citizens and rendered valuable service to his city, state\r\n  and country. Whether it was a call for patriotic service for the\r\n  preservation of the republic or an invitation to join his fellow\r\n  citizens in aiding a people struggling for liberty, or in providing\r\n  relief for those who were afflicted by reason of some extraordinary\r\n  catastrophe—on all such occasions he responded cheerfully and\r\n  contributed his full share by word and by deed.\r\n\r\n  “While he rendered conspicuous public service as an American citizen\r\n  he was ever mindful of the land of his forefathers, and of the race\r\n  from which he sprung. In early manhood he became the president of the\r\n  Charitable Irish Society of Boston, which is one of the oldest\r\n  societies in this country, having been established in the year 1737,\r\n  and from the time the American Irish Historical Society was organized\r\n  he was interested in its welfare, and was honored about ten years ago\r\n  by being elected to the highest office within the gift of its members.\r\n\r\n  “His eloquence, copiousness of ideas and fluency of speech made his\r\n  orations edifying and instructive, and his voice, so rich and tender\r\n  and with depth of feeling, made the public addresses delivered by him\r\n  in memory of the late Mayor Collins and other distinguished men,\r\n  models of eulogistic oratory.\r\n\r\n  “But he was esteemed most highly by the members of this Society as a\r\n  true and kind friend, whose sunny temperament, sparkling wit, genial\r\n  humor and upright character won their love and admiration and will\r\n  long keep him alive in their memories.”\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That this memorial be entered upon the records of this\r\n  Society and that a copy thereof be sent to the widow of our late\r\n  fellow-member together with the assurance of the deep respect and\r\n  affection in which he was held by us and the expression of our\r\n  heartfelt sympathy in her sorrow and bereavement.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Keating’s eulogy followed the memorial and was an eloquent tribute\r\n  to our late President-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gargan was born at Boston, Mass., October 27, 1844, and died at\r\nBerlin, Germany, July 31, 1908.\r\n\r\nThe following memorial to the late Mr. James J. Phelan was presented and\r\nread by Mr. Edward J. McGuire, and it was unanimously voted that the\r\nsame be adopted and that a copy thereof be sent to the family of Mr.\r\nPhelan:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MEMORIAL OF JAMES J. PHELAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “James J. Phelan died at his country home at Allenhurst, New Jersey,\r\n  on August 3, 1908, in the sixty-first year of his age. He was a native\r\n  of the city of New York.\r\n\r\n  “His father was of Irish birth. His mother was a native of Maryland.\r\n  His father, John Phelan, came to New York in his early youth with his\r\n  father. They settled in Greenwich Village, afterwards known as the\r\n  “Old Ninth Ward,” early in the nineteenth century, and established a\r\n  successful business in the grocery trade. John Phelan was a man of\r\n  shrewdness and commercial ability, which qualities he transmitted to\r\n  his son. He was one of the Phelan family that distinguished itself in\r\n  the commerce of San Francisco in the pioneer days and still maintains\r\n  its high reputation there. John Phelan largely increased his fortune\r\n  by his relations to the trade with California in the decade between\r\n  1850 and 1860.\r\n\r\n  “James J. Phelan attended first the public schools and then the\r\n  commercial department of the College of St. Francis Xavier, of which\r\n  famous institution he remained a steadfast friend ever afterwards.\r\n\r\n  “In 1867, his father, intending him for a business career, established\r\n  him as the proprietor of a general store at Fordham, which was then a\r\n  village in Westchester County but which now forms one of the important\r\n  centers in the borough of the Bronx, New York City. He spent the\r\n  formative years of his business life in the conduct of this venture.\r\n\r\n  “In 1870, at the age of twenty-five, he formed the firm of Phelan and\r\n  Duval, which engaged in the wholesale wine and spirits trade and\r\n  became one of the important houses in its department. He continued in\r\n  active management of the affairs of this business until the year 1883,\r\n  when he took charge of even larger interests.\r\n\r\n  “The American Contracting and Dredging Company was formed about that\r\n  time among other things for construction work upon the Panama canal\r\n  under the French concessionaries. It controlled valuable patent rights\r\n  in dredging machinery. It secured several important contracts from\r\n  Count Ferdinand de Lesseps as president of the French company and\r\n  afterwards constructed fifteen miles of the Panama canal. It was most\r\n  successful financially and its careful management avoided serious\r\n  complications with the misfortunes of the Frenchmen. When its\r\n  contracts were completed it withdrew from the field. Mr. Phelan was\r\n  one of the master minds in this great work. Among his associates were\r\n  Eugene Kelly, Charles N. Fry and George Bliss of distinguished and\r\n  honorable memory in American finance, and Commander Gorringe of the\r\n  United States Navy, who will be remembered for his engineering success\r\n  in transporting the obelisk from Egypt to Central Park and setting it\r\n  in its place without a single mishap.\r\n\r\n  “This, however, was but one of the important enterprises carried on by\r\n  Mr. Phelan with success. His ability in commercial and corporate\r\n  affairs was rare and as his remarkable grasp of great affairs and his\r\n  skill in their administration became known he was invited into\r\n  enterprises of the most important and lucrative character. He achieved\r\n  from them a large fortune as well as a high reputation in finance. He\r\n  died a member of the Chamber of Commerce of the City of New York.\r\n\r\n  “His active business life did not absorb all his energies. He was a\r\n  man who from his youth took active part in the political life of the\r\n  city. He joined also the societies working in the field of religion\r\n  and morality. He was fond of his friends and of social life. He was\r\n  always faithful to the traditions of the old Irish race from which he\r\n  was descended and active in its cause.\r\n\r\n  “In 1890 he became a commissioner of the Dock Department of the City\r\n  of New York on the appointment of Mayor Hugh J. Grant. He left upon\r\n  that office the impress of his ability in one of the most important\r\n  divisions of the affairs of the world’s greatest seaport, at a time\r\n  when millions of dollars were available and were spent in providing\r\n  for the oceanic trade of the port of New York. His service lasted four\r\n  years, when he resigned with the praise and good wishes of the entire\r\n  municipality.\r\n\r\n  “He was identified almost from his youth with the work of the Xavier\r\n  Alumni Sodality, of the Catholic Club and of the St. Vincent de Paul\r\n  Society. He rendered each of them great service, both as an officer\r\n  and as a member. He was a trustee of the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum,\r\n  of the Catholic Benevolent Legion, of the Catholic Summer School and\r\n  of many other philanthropic societies. He was a member of many of them\r\n  in their struggling years and he gave his powers and his industry in\r\n  full measure to their proper development.\r\n\r\n  “He was a member of the American Irish Historical Society from its\r\n  establishment. He was always most interested in its work and devoted\r\n  to the cause for which it stood. His pleasant face will be missed from\r\n  its gatherings.\r\n\r\n  “He was married twice, the second time in 1881 to Marie Foran of New\r\n  York. He had four sons and four daughters, who with his widow survive\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  “James J. Phelan was an example of the truth that in proper conditions\r\n  the men of the Irish race surely rise to eminence in fields in which\r\n  the current prejudice and error of the age deny that excellence is\r\n  possible to them. From small beginnings and in conflict with adverse\r\n  circumstances he rose to great fortune and conspicuous position in the\r\n  metropolis by the exercise of thrift, temperance, honesty and\r\n  intelligence. He met all sorts and conditions of men and asking no\r\n  favor he conquered success, holding fast at the same time to the\r\n  ideals of the race from which he sprung and the ancient faith to which\r\n  he was ever loyal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following memorial to the late Thomas Hamilton Murray, former\r\nSecretary-General of the Society, was presented and read by the present\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Thomas Z. Lee, and it was unanimously voted that\r\nthe same be adopted and that a copy thereof be sent to the widow of Mr.\r\nMurray:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  MEMORIAL OF THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “On June 5, 1908, Thomas Hamilton Murray, editor, genealogist and\r\n  historian, died at his home in Sea View in the town of Marshfield,\r\n  Massachusetts, in the fifty-first year of his age.\r\n\r\n  “He was one of the founders of the American Irish Historical Society\r\n  and its Secretary-General from the date of its organization until his\r\n  death. During his administration the Society grew in numbers and\r\n  influence, pursuing its good work and historical researches into most\r\n  of the states of the Union, until he saw it occupying the foremost\r\n  place in this country of any organization engaged in similar work. He\r\n  was proud of the Society and gave it his best efforts. To him every\r\n  individual member was personally known, and he took pride in\r\n  stimulating each with a sense of the responsibility undertaken in\r\n  making better known the Irish chapter in American history.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Murray obtained his early education in the public schools of\r\n  Newton, Cambridge and Boston, Mass., and, when he reached his\r\n  majority, chose journalism as his profession. He was a close observer,\r\n  a ready writer and possessed a style direct and attractive. The seven\r\n  volumes of the JOURNAL edited by him bear eloquent testimony to his\r\n  literary ability. For a while he contributed educational, literary and\r\n  historical articles to the _Boston Pilot_ and enjoyed the coöperation\r\n  and friendship of its then editor, John Boyle O’Reilly; later he\r\n  became a member of the staff of the _Boston Globe_, where he remained\r\n  several years. Ben Palmer was editor of the _Globe_ at that time, and\r\n  the _Globe_ office was one of the best schools of journalism in the\r\n  country. With a well-regulated mind and a strong constitution, Mr.\r\n  Murray worked hard and the training there obtained well fitted him for\r\n  the life work he had undertaken and the filling of important positions\r\n  to which he was later called.\r\n\r\n  “After leaving the _Globe_, Mr. Murray became court reporter for the\r\n  _Boston Daily Star_, then editor of the _Roxbury Advocate_, and\r\n  afterwards editor of the _Daily Advertiser_, a morning paper at\r\n  Shelton, Conn. He next became night editor of the _Morning News_, of\r\n  Bridgeport, Conn., but soon returned to day work and became editor of\r\n  the _Daily Record_ at Meriden, Conn., where he remained until called\r\n  to the editorial chair of the _Evening and Sunday Telegram_ at\r\n  Providence, R. I. After five years in this position, he became editor\r\n  of the _Lawrence Daily Sun_, and four years later took charge of the\r\n  _Evening Call_ at Woonsocket.\r\n\r\n  “He had long taken a deep interest in historical studies, particularly\r\n  in relation to the events and epochs of persons of Irish extraction,\r\n  and his lectures and writings showed not only his devotion to his\r\n  subjects, but a wide range of learning and research as well as a high\r\n  order of literary ability. In addition to his invaluable work for this\r\n  Society he was the author of many historical works, some of which are\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Libraries of Boston: Public, Semi-Public and Probate.

The highest office in the Society he might have had\r\n  and political preferment could have been his from the appreciative\r\n  citizens of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, but he turned from them\r\n  lest his time and efforts might be diverted from that branch of\r\n  history he loved so well. As long as his strength held out, he was in\r\n  the harness serving the Society and, at our last annual meeting in New\r\n  York, unable to walk, he was carried from the Grand Central Depot to\r\n  the Manhattan Hotel, and there he conducted to the end the magnificent\r\n  dinner and entertainment that followed the meeting. The effort was\r\n  almost fatal, and during the night loving and tender friends watched\r\n  over him but, by determined will, he rallied and reached his pretty\r\n  villa at Sea View from which he never departed again in life. In all\r\n  his work for the Society, he was ably assisted by his noble wife, Mary\r\n  H. Sullivan Murray, a lady of great intelligence and refinement, who\r\n  took up the work of the Secretary-General and faithfully maintained it\r\n  until a member could be selected to relieve her. In paying our deep\r\n  tribute to her husband, it would be amiss not to mention the faithful\r\n  wife and assistant who now mourns with us his loss.\r\n\r\n  “We wish to record here the great benefits which we have received from\r\n  the work and services of our first Secretary-General and pay tribute\r\n  to his learning and ability; we further record the deep sorrow with\r\n  which we look upon his vacant place, and, lastly, we record our loving\r\n  tribute of affection for Thomas Hamilton Murray as a man, fearless,\r\n  honest and faithful, an upright citizen and an earnest member of the\r\n  Society.\r\n\r\n  “‘The soil out of which such men as he are made is good to be born on,\r\n  good to live on, good to die for and be buried in.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the American Irish Historical Society, in appreciation\r\nof the services and efforts in its behalf by Thomas Hamilton Murray,\r\nlate Secretary-General, unanimously adopts the minute prepared by Mr.\r\nLee, orders that it be spread in full upon the records of the Society,\r\nand that a copy of the same under the seal of the Society be presented\r\nto the widow, Mrs. Mary H. Sullivan Murray.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the many letters received by Mrs. Murray\r\nimmediately before and after the death of our late Secretary-General:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  NEW YORK, May 9, 1908.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Mrs. Murray_: I am pained to learn of Mr. Murray’s low\r\n  condition. You have my heartfelt sympathy. Mr. Magrath has just\r\n  called, and spoke of his visit.

D.\r\n\r\n  Bishop of Sioux City, Ia.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Iowa.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  We have all suffered a great loss in his death; and the noble work he\r\n  carried forward so devotedly in developing the Irish chapter in\r\n  American history will not readily find again as zealous or able an\r\n  advocate. He had been the steady reliance of the Society. The\r\n  patriotic work he did will long be a pride and glory to the race he\r\n  loved and the cause so faithfully served.\r\n\r\n  With profound regret and sincerely sympathizing with all his friends\r\n  and fellow members, I am,\r\n\r\n                                        Faithfully yours,\r\n                                                        JNO.

In looking back over the past it is consoling to\r\n  think his life has been a most exemplary one. How much better would\r\n  our communities be, if we had more such men as your husband. His good\r\n  and simple life was a model for all. He was a man whose character was\r\n  the soul of buoyancy and kindness.\r\n\r\n                               With deep grief,\r\n                                           I remain respectfully,\r\n                                                       JAMES L.

JORDAN,\r\n      3 DeWolfe Street, Dorchester, Mass.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_: Your telegram received, and I regret exceedingly that I\r\n  was unable to reach Boston in time for Secretary Murray’s funeral.\r\n\r\n  I was very, very sorry to hear of his death, and while it is a great\r\n  loss to his family, our Society has lost a very valuable member.\r\n  Please convey my sympathy to the family.\r\n\r\n  I do not know what the circumstances of the family are, but certainly\r\n  the Society if necessary should do something to assist them at this\r\n  time. I know that in his home loving hands did all they could for him\r\n  and it is for the Society to assist financially if necessary.\r\n\r\n                                         Very truly yours,\r\n                                                         PATRICK GARVAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 NEW YORK, June 9, 1908.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL J. JORDAN, Esq.,\r\n      3 DeWolfe Street, Dorchester, Mass.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Mr. Jordan_: Your telegram notifying me of the time of Mr.\r\n  Murray’s funeral reached me yesterday morning on my return to the\r\n  city. I regret exceedingly the untimely death of our friend. He was a\r\n  devoted and whole-souled worker in the cause of historic truth. I have\r\n  never met anyone who surpassed him in zeal and unselfishness. He\r\n  leaves vacant a place in the ranks of the lovers of the Irish race and\r\n  the adherents of the Catholic Church which it will be hard to fill.\r\n\r\n  I have not the address of his family. May I ask you kindly to extend\r\n  to them my heartfelt sympathy?\r\n\r\n                                              Yours very truly,\r\n                                                      Edward J.

THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,\r\n      Carlton Road, Sea View, Mass.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Mrs. Murray_: I am very sorry to learn of the death of Mr.\r\n  Murray. I did not hear of it till it was too late for me to attend the\r\n  funeral to show the respect and esteem I have felt for him from the\r\n  first time I met him, several years before the American Irish\r\n  Historical Society was organized. From that time to this our relations\r\n  were most cordial and my most sincere sympathy is extended to yourself\r\n  and your family for the great loss you have sustained. It is a great\r\n  loss. You and your family have not alone felt this loss, but everyone\r\n  who had or has any interest in American Irish history must also\r\n  recognize it. It will be hard to get a man to fill his place in this\r\n  latter capacity. Again let me express my sincere sympathy with you in\r\n  your bereavement.\r\n\r\n  Let me thank you for the return of the pictures that I received last\r\n  Saturday. I was thinking, before their receipt, where I would send a\r\n  letter addressed to you expressive of my sympathy at your loss but\r\n  could not make up my mind where to send it. I saw the Sea View\r\n  postmark on the envelope over the pictures and I send this to that\r\n  address.\r\n\r\n        Yours very respectfully, and in sincere sympathy,\r\n                                                            JAMES MORAN.\r\n\r\n  26 South Water Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND, July 9, 1908.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Mrs. Murray_: I have only now heard of dear Tom Murray’s death\r\n  and I am so grieved over it that I can hardly contain myself to write\r\n  you this letter.\r\n\r\n  While his demise was not entirely unexpected it is nevertheless a\r\n  great shock, and I hasten to extend my deep and heartfelt sympathy in\r\n  this your time of sorrow. You have lost a good and worthy husband and\r\n  I a true friend, of whom I was very fond, and I’m sorry that I was far\r\n  away from home when he was taken by loving and tender hands to his\r\n  last resting place.\r\n\r\n  A clipping from a newspaper sent by my mother told the sad story. She\r\n  sent it several days ago, but as I have been going about from place to\r\n  place the news missed me till now.\r\n\r\n  May God bless and protect you is my humblest wish for you this night.\r\n\r\n                                  Yours with much sorrow,\r\n                                                          THOMAS Z.

THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,\r\n      48 Carlton Road, Sea View, Mass.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Madam_: I am just in receipt of a journal of the American Irish\r\n  Historical Society with printed request that I acknowledge it to the\r\n  Secretary-General. Would that I could, and that he were still with us!\r\n  I learned some weeks ago of his death and I beg to offer you my\r\n  sincere sympathy and pray Our Lady, the Consoler of the Afflicted, to\r\n  comfort you and the Lord to grant him His reward, the reward of the\r\n  faithful and just.\r\n\r\n                                   Respectfully yours,\r\n                                                       D.

MURRAY,\r\n      Humarock Beach, Sea View, Mass.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Madam_: I received the JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL\r\n  SOCIETY, Volume VII, 1907, and beg leave to thank you for the same. It\r\n  is admirably gotten up in Mr. Murray’s usual good style and nicely\r\n  illustrated, and well bound.\r\n\r\n  It is like all the previous numbers, a monument to the great ability\r\n  and devoted industry of your husband. His loss to the Society is\r\n  indeed very great. His devotion to the work of this Society endeared\r\n  him to all who knew of his earnest efforts, and his work in its behalf\r\n  has made for him a most enduring monument.\r\n\r\n                                        Very truly yours,\r\n                                                        JNO. J. LENEHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following memorial to the late Major John Crane, prepared by Hon.\r\nEugene A. Philbin, was also unanimously adopted, and it was voted to\r\nsend a copy thereof to the family of Major Crane:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MEMORIAL OF JOHN CRANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It very rarely happens that it is given to a man to be a source of\r\n  inspiration to his fellowmen in more than one phase of human effort. A\r\n  man may, during his life, have given evidence of exalted and\r\n  self-denying patriotism, or have been conspicuous in the great field\r\n  of charity, or an example of the highest type of the successful and\r\n  upright business man, or a great leader in movements for the uplifting\r\n  of mankind, but the average man cannot hope to establish a claim for\r\n  recognition for more than one of these achievements. John Crane,\r\n  however, was entitled to credit for a distinguished career in all. He\r\n  was born in Morgan County, Ohio, on the 10th day of February, 1840.\r\n  His mother died while he was quite young and his father took the\r\n  family to the State of Wisconsin. War was declared between the North\r\n  and South when he had hardly attained manhood, but, with two other\r\n  young men, he organized a company of volunteers and was elected first\r\n  lieutenant. This company offered its services to the governor of the\r\n  State and was assigned to the Sixth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. The\r\n  regiment was ordered to the Army of the Potomac, and was incorporated\r\n  with other regiments which were known as the “Iron Brigade,” and as\r\n  such attained great distinction for noteworthy services during the\r\n  war. Mr. Crane served with the Sixth Wisconsin until the winter of\r\n  1862, when he resigned, but only for the purpose of aiding in the\r\n  organization of the Seventeenth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry, an Irish\r\n  regiment which was being raised in that State. He was successful in\r\n  organizing Company A, and became its first lieutenant. This regiment\r\n  in March, 1862, was ordered South, and their first stop was at St.\r\n  Louis, whence they went to Tennessee, arriving at Pittsburgh Landing,\r\n  Tennessee, a couple of days after the Battle of Shiloh. The regiment\r\n  was assigned to the division of General McArthur, with whom it served\r\n  during the campaign, taking part in numerous skirmishes and the Battle\r\n  of Corinth. About this time the Adjutant of the regiment resigned and\r\n  Lieutenant Crane was appointed Adjutant, which position he held until\r\n  the close of the war. Upon the organization of the Seventeenth Army\r\n  Corps, Gen. J. B. McPherson commanding (afterwards killed before\r\n  Atlanta), the regiment became one of the regiments of this Corps,\r\n  taking part in the campaign before the Siege of Vicksburg. They\r\n  participated in the siege, and the regiment, Lieut.-Col. Thomas\r\n  MacMahon commanding, joined with others in making the first assault on\r\n  the breastworks at Vicksburg, May 19, 1863. The regimental officers\r\n  and men were most highly commended by their commanding officer. John\r\n  Crane bore a distinguished part in this assault and was personally\r\n  complimented by the general commanding. The Seventeenth Corps was part\r\n  of the Army of the Tennessee under General Sherman and served in all\r\n  its campaign before Atlanta and on the march to the sea.\r\n  Notwithstanding the fact that John Crane was of a naturally impulsive\r\n  nature, during the battle his ability to command and exercise a\r\n  considerate supervision of his men was never affected. His bravery was\r\n  characterized by unfaltering fearlessness, but never marred by\r\n  recklessness. He remained in the service until the war was concluded.\r\n\r\n  “In the year 1868 Mr. Crane engaged in business with Colonel MacMahon,\r\n  to whom reference has been made. Later William A. MacMahon, who served\r\n  in the same regiment, entered the business, which was conducted under\r\n  the name of Crane & MacMahon at the time of Mr. Crane’s death, which\r\n  occurred on April 8, 1908, in New York City. The tie that had been\r\n  formed with the MacMahon brothers in the service was strengthened by\r\n  Mr. Crane’s marriage to their sister in the year 1866. She still\r\n  survives him.\r\n\r\n  “From the outset, even when his time was much taken in forming his\r\n  business relations and organizing his affairs, he was deeply and\r\n  practically interested in charity. He commenced then the practice\r\n  which was continued to the end of his life, not only of giving most\r\n  liberally, but also of devoting his time and personal attention to the\r\n  relief of the poor. For many years he was chairman of the finance\r\n  committee of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and it was largely due\r\n  to his gentle but firm persistency that persons able to do so were\r\n  made to contribute. It was rarely that a meeting of the committee was\r\n  held that there was not some practical suggestion by him towards\r\n  procuring those already interested to take a still greater interest or\r\n  to secure the sympathy of people who had not already contributed in\r\n  the great work. His effort in this important field was never limited\r\n  to satisfying the physical suffering of the moment, but included a\r\n  practical and effective course, having for its end not only the\r\n  provision for pecuniary resources, but the inspiration of new courage\r\n  and hope. The battle always became easier and the prospect more\r\n  hopeful after a visit from John Crane.\r\n\r\n             “Careless their merits or their faults to scan,\r\n             His pity gave ere charity began.”\r\n\r\n  “Since he carried into business the great elements of character that\r\n  had made him a distinguished and able soldier and was constantly\r\n  inspired by the broad spirit of charity which engendered the desire\r\n  for fair dealing, it was only natural that his efforts should meet\r\n  with success and that he and his associate should attain a position in\r\n  the business world distinguished for an honorable policy and ability\r\n  to produce effective results.\r\n\r\n  “The reward which attended his efforts in the great spheres of life,\r\n  to which reference has already been made, caused a deeper appreciation\r\n  of the value of spiritual inspiration. He realized that the battles\r\n  that he had fought on the field of war and in civic life had been won\r\n  because of his reliance not upon man or things, but upon the Supreme\r\n  Being. He took advantage of every opportunity to convey this great\r\n  lesson to his fellowmen. When about ten years before his death\r\n  Governor Roosevelt appointed him a member of the board of trustees of\r\n  the Soldiers’ Home in Steuben County, New York state, he was given an\r\n  opportunity that probably brought him more real gratification than any\r\n  other one thing in his philanthropic career. He organized at the\r\n  Soldiers’ Home religious societies which furnished spiritual\r\n  gratification to the veteran soldiers, and also gave them a new\r\n  occupation that tended to relieve the monotony of institutional life.\r\n  It seemed to him as if he were again, after the lapse of so many\r\n  years, participating with pathetic care and solicitation in the\r\n  careers and welfare of those who, under his guidance, were giving\r\n  their lives to their country. It is not difficult to imagine what this\r\n  opportunity meant to Major Crane. It is needless to say that the duty\r\n  was discharged, not only in a manner that gave happiness to the\r\n  inmates at the time, but also inaugurated methods that were so\r\n  meritorious as to remain permanently to the advantage of the Home.\r\n\r\n  “Major Crane never entered actively into politics, although he was a\r\n  man of clear and positive views as to public welfare. From time to\r\n  time he freely lent his voice and aid to movements having for their\r\n  object civic betterment.\r\n\r\n  “He was for many years the almoner of the Friendly Sons of St.\r\n  Patrick, and gave the same intelligent and able consideration to the\r\n  appeals made to the Society by the unfortunate as he had given to many\r\n  other cases of distress. He was a most active and faithful member of\r\n  the latter society, and, in fact, was deeply interested in anything\r\n  that concerned the Irish race and furnished evidence of the great\r\n  benefits it had conferred upon mankind.\r\n\r\n  “Major Crane was especially interested in American-Irish history\r\n  because of its eloquent testimony in support of Irish virtue and\r\n  ability. His own noble record will always be a bright page in the\r\n  annals of the race in this country.\r\n\r\n               “Unbounded courage and compassion join’d,\r\n                 Tempering each other in the victor’s mind,\r\n               Alternately proclaim him good and great,\r\n                 And make the hero and the man complete.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MEMORIAL OF HON. HUGH KELLY.\r\n\r\nIn the death of Hugh Kelly, President of the corporation of Hugh Kelly &\r\nCo., 79 Wall Street, New York City, the downtown business community of\r\nNew York lost a man of sound judgment of men and affairs, and a true\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly was born in Chicago, September 24th, 1858, and when a year old\r\ncame to New York, where he lived thereafter. He was graduated from the\r\nCollege of the City of New York with high honors and was later honored\r\nwith the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctors of Laws by Fordham\r\nUniversity. In 1871 he entered the West Indian trade and in 1884\r\nestablished the house of Hugh Kelly & Co., which is well-known\r\nthroughout the cane sugar world. He was very successful in designing and\r\nconstructing several of the largest and most modern sugar cane factories\r\nin Cuba, Porto Rico and Santo Domingo, and was one of the best known\r\nmerchants in that industry.\r\n\r\nHe was president of several sugar companies in the West Indies, but\r\nfound time also to devote himself to maritime and municipal affairs, and\r\nwas in the directorate of the United Fruit Company, The Emigrant\r\nIndustrial Savings Bank, the Nipe Bay Company, and other industrial\r\nenterprises. He was also a Trustee of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the Roman\r\nCatholic Orphan Asylum, Calvary Cemetery, the Sevilla Home for Children,\r\nand the Central Islip State Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly served the city as a member of the Board of Education from\r\n1895 to 1898, and was Treasurer of its Finance Committee.\r\n\r\nHe was Vice-President of the Maritime Exchange in 1894 and 1895,\r\nPresident in 1896 and 1897, and for seven years was on its directorate.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly was made president of The Oriental Bank in an effort to save\r\nit shortly before it failed last Winter. He was a director in the bank\r\nat the time of the financial depression, and when the bank was\r\nthreatened Mr. Kelly took up the task, two or three days after his\r\nreturn from Europe, of realizing on the bank’s assets and meeting the\r\nclaims against it. He was going along very well when fresh bank failures\r\ncaused a run on the Oriental, which led to its suspension.\r\nAttorney-General Jackson had receivers appointed but they were soon\r\nremoved by the Court. Full payment to every depositor was eventually\r\nmade through an arrangement with the Metropolitan Trust Company, which\r\ntook over the Oriental Bank’s assets. Mr. Kelly in his desire to keep\r\nthe bank on its feet when he accepted the presidency refused to accept a\r\ncent of remuneration, his sole desire being to keep the bank going. The\r\nstrain under which he labored at that time, and the many false rumors\r\nwhich those antagonistic to the bank had issued, preyed upon him\r\ngreatly, and an acute nervous ailment forced him to give up work three\r\nweeks before his death, which occurred October 30th, 1908, at 3 a. m.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was held at St. Patrick’s Cathedral on November 2d.\r\nArchbishop Farley celebrated solemn requiem mass. Some of the other\r\nchurch dignitaries who assisted in the service were Mgr. Lavelle, Mgr.\r\nHayes, Father McCluskey and Father McQuade.\r\n\r\nThe pall bearers were Joseph Rigney, Michael E. Bannin, Thomas E.\r\nMurray, Col. John McAnerney, Richard S. Treacy, James H. Post, President\r\nof the National Sugar Refining Company, Joseph W. Foster, Frank\r\nSchaffer, Vice-President of Hugh Kelly & Co., Thomas Mulry, President\r\nEmigrant Industrial Savings Bank and Myles Tierney, President of the\r\nHudson Trust Company. The interment was in Calvary Cemetery.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly is survived by his widow, three sons and four daughters.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Mr. Kelly was a quiet, hearty, genial man, easily\r\napproachable and warm-hearted, seeming to have time for every demand\r\nupon him in spite of his numerous responsibilities, and a host of\r\nfriends esteemed him most highly for his ability, integrity and sound\r\njudgment. In the business life of New York in which he moved, he will be\r\ndeeply missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following memorial to the late James Jeffrey Roche, Esq., was also\r\nunanimously adopted, and it was voted to send a copy thereof to his\r\nfamily:\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Smith of the _Boston Traveler_, one of the founders of the\r\nSociety, and at the invitation of its officers, presented the following\r\nmemorial to the late Hon. James Jeffrey Roche, LL. D., which was ordered\r\nspread upon the records and a copy thereof sent to the family of Dr.\r\nRoche:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE, LL.

One of the Founders of our\r\n    Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MEMORIAL OF JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE.\r\n\r\n       Under the skies of that brave mountain land,\r\n         Where Alpine shepherds feudal might defied,\r\n       Where struggling freedom warring cent’ries spanned,\r\n         There in the shadows of the hills he died.\r\n\r\n       He died as dies some long sweet summer day,\r\n         When fruits are golden on the burdened trees;\r\n       The sun’s pale glory on the sky’s blue gray,\r\n         And night comes fragrant on the cooling breeze.\r\n\r\n       They brought him home and laid him down to rest,\r\n         To sleep forever in his narrow bed,\r\n       Amid the scenes and friends that he loved best,\r\n         At rest forever with his sacred dead.\r\n                           JOSEPH SMITH, in the Boston Traveler.\r\n\r\nJames Jeffrey Roche was born in the little Quaker town of Mountmellick\r\nin Queen’s County, Ireland, the son of Edward and Mary (Doyle) Roche and\r\nwas taken while yet an infant of a few weeks, to Prince Edward’s Island,\r\nwhither his parents emigrated. He grew up in Charlottetown, where his\r\nfather Edward Roche, an accomplished scholar, conducted a school; and he\r\nsupplemented the training given him by his scholarly father by a course\r\nat the Jesuit College of St. Dunstan’s in Charlottetown, from which he\r\nwas graduated. Among his college classmates were Chief Justice Sullivan\r\nof Prince Edward’s Island and Archbishop O’Brien of Halifax, N. S.\r\n\r\nMr. Roche settled in Boston in 1866 and was engaged in business there\r\nfor some years; but his peculiar gifts and tastes drew him to journalism\r\nand letters; and in 1883 he became one of the staff of the _Pilot_,\r\nunder his brilliant friend John Boyle O’Reilly; and after his death he\r\nsucceeded to the post of editor-in-chief of the paper which he filled\r\nwith vigor and brilliancy, in full keeping with the traditions of such\r\npredecessors as Thomas D’Arcy Magee, O’Reilly and others. The _Pilot_\r\nwas the avowed champion not only of the Irish people and of their\r\nreligion, but it stood ready to do battle with persecution, injustice,\r\nintolerance and wrong, no matter against what race or creed they were\r\ndirected; and no individual paper in the world did better or more\r\neffective work for the men and cause of the Irish race; and under the\r\nmanagement of James Jeffrey Roche, zeal and fidelity to all good causes\r\nwere always fortified by sanity and justice and tempered by humor, good\r\ntemper and a fine inhospitality to passion and demagoguery.\r\n\r\nWhile devoting most of his time and talents to his editorial work and\r\nduty, he still found opportunities to turn to the field of letters of a\r\nmore enduring character. A writer of virile and picturesque prose, James\r\nJeffrey Roche will always be best known as a poet whose verse is marked\r\nby beauty, sweetness, lyrical quality and a _belle esprit_ all his own,\r\nand ranging in scope from the light, brilliant and witty _vers de\r\nsociété_ to such serious and compelling poems as his “Babylon.” His\r\n“Songs and Satires” is a volume that sparkles with wit and rapier-like\r\ntouches. His “Ballads of Blue Water” is a book for American men and\r\npatriots, unique and stirring; the ballads will live while Americans\r\nlook back with pride to the deeds of an heroic past; and no American\r\nsinger has written any better ballads of action than “The Armstrong\r\nPrivateer,” “The Constitution,” “The Alamo” and other stirring songs.\r\nHis “Life of John Boyle O’Reilly” was the tribute of a devoted friend\r\nand admirer to a man and comrade he loved and labored with, and is a\r\nbiography whose literary excellence is amazing when we consider the\r\npressure under which it was written. His other prose work varied from\r\nthe brilliant accuracy and gravity of “The Story of the Filibusters”\r\n(republished by the Harpers as “The Byways of War”) to those airy\r\nmedleys of fun and philosophy “Her Majesty the King” and “The Sorrows of\r\nSap’ed,” which have made the world laugh and think.\r\n\r\nA close personal friend and admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, he\r\nwas appointed by him American Consul at Genoa, Italy, in 1904, when his\r\nhealth being precarious, a change of work and climate became necessary;\r\nand in 1907 the President transferred him to the capital of Switzerland,\r\nBerne, where he lived until the final call came to him.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1896 I broached to a few interested friends the project of\r\nestablishing an organization which would bring together men of the Irish\r\nrace interested in gathering and perpetuating the record of the\r\nachievement of that race on this American continent, and preserving it\r\nin such form that historians could utilize it and thus ensure us our\r\nshare of the honor and credit of upbuilding the American Republic, I\r\nfound him sympathetic and enthusiastic in the matter; and out of those\r\ngatherings and discussions sprang the movement which resulted in the\r\nfoundation of the American Irish Historical Society. James Jeffrey\r\nRoche, John Linehan, Hamilton Murray and I drew up the call, signed it,\r\nsecured other signatures, called a meeting at the Revere House, Boston,\r\nMass., 20th January, 1897, and the Society was born. He became one of\r\nthe members of the Executive Council and for many years we attended its\r\nmeetings and outings until conditions and circumstances stopped our\r\nattendance without attenuating our interest in its progress.\r\n\r\nPersonally, James Jeffrey Roche was one of the most lovable and charming\r\nof men, who carried under a surface of wit and joyous frivolity a nature\r\nwhose depth, sincerity, devotion to ideals, capacity for friendship,\r\npassion for freedom, love of race and motherland, high-minded patriotism\r\nand loyalty to duty and honor, were understood only by those who knew\r\nhim intimately. He hated all meanness and dishonor; friendship was a\r\nsacred thing to him; and he had that clairvoyant vision of the poet\r\nwhich saw the humbug and pharisee under the skin of the charlatan, when\r\nmany a reputedly wiser and more sophisticated man accepted the demagogue\r\nand pretender at their own valuation.\r\n\r\nI knew him for many years; to me he was as my own flesh and blood; I\r\ncould not love a brother more; and his death was merely the final\r\nchapter in the grief I experienced when he went from Boston to represent\r\nthe Republic abroad, in such physical condition that I knew I would\r\nnever look upon his face again in life; and I know that in voicing my\r\nown sorrow I am but expressing the feelings of those who were comrades\r\nin the past and lovers of him always. He had reached the zenith of his\r\nliterary powers before he left the land of his adoption and love\r\nforever; and he himself realized that his work was done, and that only\r\nthe official duties of his consular position remained to preoccupy him\r\nuntil the final call.\r\n\r\nBesides a host of friends, he left a wife, a son and a daughter to mourn\r\nhis passing; and while the idle reader of contemporary literature may\r\ntime and again derive pleasure and profit from his joyous wit, and\r\ngentle philosophy, his intimates and brothers in soul will seldom meet\r\nwithout recalling with a hush and a sigh the friend and comrade who has\r\npassed and who awaits them where work and worry, sweat and sorrow, are\r\nno more forever.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in Holyhood Cemetery, Brookline, Mass., within a stone’s\r\nthrow of the spot where sleep his comrades in the flesh, John Boyle\r\nO’Reilly, Thomas J. Gargan and Patrick A. Collins, his grave marked by a\r\nhandsome granite column adorned with a bronze tablet, erected by a group\r\nof friends who loved him in life and mourn him in death. May he sleep in\r\npeace; for no gentler, sweeter spirit was ever added to the company of\r\nHeaven than James Jeffrey Roche.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list of applicants for membership in the Society was read\r\nby the secretary-general, and by unanimous vote they were duly elected\r\nmembers:\r\n\r\nJohn J.

Gargan, of whom I must speak later on,\r\n  was this: ‘To place the Irish element in its true light in American\r\n  history.’ It is not necessary to warn you, at this stage of our\r\n  existence as a body, that the American Irish Historical Society does\r\n  not live either to pick holes in the coats of others or to trail its\r\n  own coat over the sod by way of challenge. Rather, I may say, the\r\n  purpose of our organization is defensive; to employ the armory of\r\n  historical truth in vindicating for men of Irish blood that place in\r\n  American history of which it has been defrauded either wilfully or\r\n  through ignorance. Many causes have contributed to create\r\n  misrepresentation on the one hand and honest misconception on the\r\n  other. We need not discuss these causes in detail just at present. I\r\n  am here to deliver a general address and not a special lecture in\r\n  history. But we all know, and every well-informed American is aware,\r\n  that the ignorant and the vulgar not so very long ago had but two\r\n  well-defined ideas about Irishmen: One, that they wore red whiskers\r\n  and carried hods; the other, that they loved a fight. The former of\r\n  these errors we strive to dissipate—and I think we have succeeded\r\n  notably—by the very fact of the Society’s existence and by the\r\n  publication of the annual journal with its roster of membership. As to\r\n  the latter, we are not, I fear, in a position to deny it without some\r\n  reserve. It may, however, be fairly claimed that this Society has\r\n  already done much to proclaim its sympathy with the arts of peace in\r\n  electing a member of my profession to be the immediate successor of\r\n  such a man as Admiral McGowan.\r\n\r\n  “So far to establish what I take to be the solid reasons which justify\r\n  the existence of such a society as ours. Now let me call your\r\n  attention to an absolutely indispensable condition of our success in\r\n  the future, as it has been, I think, one great factor of our success\r\n  in the past. It is our aim to make better known the Irish pages of\r\n  American history. These pages do not refer, let us remember, to any\r\n  one section, type, class or creed of Irish-descended Americans, but to\r\n  all without discrimination. And this function of our Society evidently\r\n  will never be, could never have been, effectively discharged without a\r\n  hearty collective effort to sink all differences of religious belief\r\n  and of political connections. We must continue to act, within our own\r\n  body and in pursuit of our common object, independently of those\r\n  sectional, religious or political ties which bind us individually as\r\n  loyal citizens and as sincere Christians. From the days of Brian Boru\r\n  and of Dermot McMorough down to our own time we know that that little\r\n  isle where grows the ‘chosen leaf of bard and chief’ has been a prey\r\n  to the invader only because the invader knew how to foment dissension\r\n  among its native sons. Gentlemen, this essential quality of our\r\n  organization is both forcibly and happily borne in upon us in these\r\n  days when we hear that the land of our fathers is at last beginning to\r\n  assert its power as a political unit by realizing that very idea of\r\n  being ‘Irish first,’ that idea of national unity, her neglect of which\r\n  has been the comfort of her enemies in times past.\r\n\r\n  “Their proneness to dissension has been more or less facetiously\r\n  accounted for by the theory that the Irish are a nervously high-strung\r\n  race, who find a pleasant counter-irritant in the ‘man-enobling\r\n  conflict.’ It has been said that an Irishman would rather fight\r\n  another Irishman than a man of alien race, simply because he\r\n  recognizes in an antagonist of his own blood the most promising\r\n  opportunity of a truly exciting battle.\r\n\r\n  “The memory is still fresh upon me of that important event at which I\r\n  had the honor of assisting on the 16th of last month, the unveiling of\r\n  the beautiful tablet placed in the State House at Providence, Rhode\r\n  Island, to the glorious memory of Major-General John Sullivan of\r\n  Revolutionary fame. We all know that this splendid and public-spirited\r\n  memorial is one of the achievements of the past year on which our\r\n  Society has reason to congratulate itself. Let the still fresh memory\r\n  of that proud occasion be my excuse for dwelling at such great length\r\n  upon the warlike qualities of the Irish race. For these qualities, in\r\n  truth, are quite generally admitted by both friends and enemies. Our\r\n  more pressing call, it seems, is to emphasize the achievements of the\r\n  Irish race in peace. After listening to those eloquent tributes in the\r\n  Providence State House from the lips of Governor Higgins, Ex-Governor\r\n  Lippitt and others, it was borne in upon me how easily a public man’s\r\n  peaceful achievements may be eclipsed by his military exploits. John\r\n  Sullivan was, as our tablet records, a statesman of distinction; as a\r\n  jurist he left his mark upon the legal history of New Hampshire, and\r\n  yet it is almost exclusively as the patriot soldier that he lives\r\n  today in the popular mind.\r\n\r\n  “Another hero of the American Revolution whose memory we must tonight\r\n  recall with especial satisfaction was Commodore John Barry. We have\r\n  the right, gentlemen, and I think that we should insist upon it\r\n  strenuously in these days, to call Barry the Irish father of that\r\n  splendid American navy of which we are all so justly proud. And it is\r\n  matter for congratulation that, since our last annual meeting, and\r\n  largely through our own organized efforts, historical justice is now\r\n  at last to be done to the man who was a commissioned Captain in the\r\n  American navy when Paul Jones was only a Lieutenant. A prominent site\r\n  has been officially chosen for a statue of Barry at the national\r\n  capitol, and we have every reason to hope that the work will be\r\n  executed by some sculptor of great repute of Irish descent.\r\n\r\n  “But, proud as we must all feel of Irish services to the Republic ‘on\r\n  the decks of fame’ and on many a stricken field, is it not rather our\r\n  duty as an organization to shed the light of history upon Irish\r\n  services in the council chamber and the law court, in science and\r\n  scholarship, and the fine arts? In the retrospect of the year that is\r\n  gone, what Irish-descended American can fail to thrill with pride at\r\n  the spectacle of that distinguished and at the same time enthusiastic\r\n  assembly which paid honor to the memory of Augustus St. Gaudens, a\r\n  native of Dublin, and the foremost American sculptor of our own day?\r\n\r\n  “And in this retrospect we have to include at least one example of the\r\n  type of Irish descendant which rises to eminence in the peaceful\r\n  professions in our late-lamented and highly-respected\r\n  President-General, Thomas J. Gargan, whose obsequies in Boston last\r\n  fall were the occasion of so impressive a manifestation of civic\r\n  gratitude and esteem. Surely his life was in itself a powerful effort\r\n  to ‘place the Irish element in its true light in American history.’\r\n  Eminent in the legal profession in a community where the standards of\r\n  that profession are especially high, he also gave to the state of\r\n  Massachusetts as a trusted official such services as were duly\r\n  acknowledged by the presence in his funeral cortege of the Mayor of\r\n  Boston, the present and past Governors of Massachusetts, and an\r\n  immense multitude of citizens. And if this great lawyer’s career\r\n  brilliantly illustrated the truth that the Irish race excel in other\r\n  things besides fighting I must not pass over in silence that other\r\n  departed fellow-member, Major John Crane of New York, a man whose\r\n  career was illustrious both in war and in peace, a citizen who first\r\n  turned his back upon commercial success in order to take up arms for\r\n  what he considered the cause of the Republic, and then, when he had\r\n  won glory for himself in four years of active military service,\r\n  returned to the peaceful pursuits of commerce to achieve a place among\r\n  the leading merchants of New York, and at last to dispense his\r\n  honorably-acquired wealth and to apply his talents and his time in the\r\n  charitable relief of poverty and suffering.\r\n\r\n  “I have purposely left to the end of this retrospect my sincere\r\n  tribute to the memory of that man whose death, coming in the interval\r\n  since our last annual meeting, has been a peculiar loss to us as a\r\n  body. In addressing you two years ago, my distinguished predecessor,\r\n  Admiral McGowan, said, referring to our then Secretary, Thomas\r\n  Hamilton Murray: ‘A competent secretary is a priceless possession for\r\n  any society, and we have been especially fortunate in this respect.’\r\n  The distinguished Admiral was speaking in the presence of Mr. Murray\r\n  when he uttered those words. What may we not add now that death has\r\n  removed the restraints imposed in such circumstances by modesty and\r\n  good taste. Thomas Hamilton Murray was indeed a man to whom the\r\n  American Irish will forever owe a debt of gratitude for his work along\r\n  that line which we, as a society, have especially taken for our own.\r\n  He was a journalist by profession, an ornament, I may say, to American\r\n  journalism, as so many good American Irish have been; and before this\r\n  Society had come into existence he had already anticipated its aims,\r\n  by rendering out of his own initiative and his own exertions no\r\n  insignificant service toward placing the Irish element in its true\r\n  light in American history. From its very inauguration our Society was\r\n  aware that no other man in all the length and breadth of this country\r\n  could have held his position with so much advantage to the cause which\r\n  we have at heart. To say nothing of that which many of us must feel in\r\n  the removal of a dear friend, the Society cannot but be conscious of\r\n  the calamity it has sustained in the loss of this truly ‘priceless\r\n  possession’ to whom our rapid success in the past has been so largely\r\n  due.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL J. JORDAN.\r\n\r\n  Of Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Massachusetts.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “In the year that has passed our Society has singularly suffered from\r\n  the loss of many of its ardent and enthusiastic workers. These\r\n  pioneers of our organization have been summoned from our midst, but\r\n  the heritage they have left is beyond measure or computation. Their\r\n  memory will always be fragrant with the sweetness of their lives, and,\r\n  whilst we chant their requiem, may they enjoy the hosannas that are\r\n  sung for them in their happier abode.\r\n\r\n  “Coming now to the actual aspect of our life as an organization, we\r\n  may congratulate ourselves, I rejoice to say, upon a thoroughly sound\r\n  and vigorous condition. Most especially would I single out for mention\r\n  the astonishing success of our new membership committee. That\r\n  committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. John J. Linehan, was\r\n  appointed in New York City, I need hardly remind you, scarcely two\r\n  months ago, with the object of promoting the numerical increase of our\r\n  membership, while of course taking due care that its quality should\r\n  not fall below the standard which we had thus far maintained. So\r\n  zealously and efficiently has the work of the committee been done, so\r\n  just and cordial has been the appreciation of the Society’s aims, that\r\n  within one month 125 new and good names were added to our roster, and\r\n  the total increment, I believe, since the appointment of the\r\n  committee, amounts at the present moment to something over 200. I am\r\n  sure that we all heartily welcome these new recruits, and in voicing\r\n  that welcome let me express the hope that every man of the new squad\r\n  intends to do his utmost for the furtherance of our great aims.\r\n\r\n  “To do this, gentlemen, no mere machine action of the Society will be\r\n  adequate. Our work is, remember, a work of enlightenment, therefore a\r\n  work dealing with the intellect of our times and our country, and not\r\n  to be accomplished without intellectual exertion. Now while societies,\r\n  academies and universities have their immense value as a directive and\r\n  unifying apparatus, the intellectual forces which operate under their\r\n  control must of necessity be individual. To be effectual all effort\r\n  must be controlled by system, but the most perfect system without an\r\n  abundance of individual effort must be like an elaborately-constructed\r\n  piece of artillery without a sufficient supply of ammunition.\r\n\r\n  “Our system has now been elaborated by the inauguration of the\r\n  _Recorder_, to be published at stated periods and which will serve as\r\n  a vehicle for such notices on topics of American Irish history as the\r\n  zeal and enterprise of individual members may prompt. It is\r\n  confidentially hoped that the supply of such material will be both\r\n  abundant and rich in quality, and that our _Recorder_ will become in\r\n  itself a valuable magazine of information in those lines of research\r\n  which are the Society’s special province.\r\n\r\n  “Let me even urge on members the advantage to our cause that would be\r\n  attained if every one of us will make a point of forwarding to the\r\n  Secretary-General, Judge Lee, who has assumed, in addition to the many\r\n  exacting duties of his present office, that of editor of our\r\n  _Recorder_, any newspaper clippings or other material concerning\r\n  contemporary happenings relating to our work.\r\n\r\n  “Finally, gentlemen, it is in no perfunctory spirit that I here\r\n  publicly render thanks to the members of our official staff, without\r\n  whose zealous coöperation our year could not have been brought to the\r\n  happy and glorious conclusion in which we rejoice tonight. Since the\r\n  death of our beloved Secretary-General six months ago Judge Thomas Z.\r\n  Lee of Rhode Island has fulfilled in large measure the colossal duties\r\n  of that office, and to whom the Society owes more than mere words of\r\n  thanks. With him I associate in my heartfelt gratitude our esteemed\r\n  and respected Treasurer-General, Mr. Michael F. Dooley, whose devotion\r\n  to our work and our interests has been, I may say without\r\n  exaggeration, heroic. And, gentlemen, I must not conclude without\r\n  expressing in both my own behalf and that of the Society as a whole\r\n  those thanks which are fairly due to the various committees who have\r\n  so successfully carried out the work of organizing this meeting. I\r\n  hold that the manner in which that labor of love has been performed\r\n  has been in itself a very positive demonstration of the faculty of\r\n  concerted action which belongs to our race, at least on this side of\r\n  the Atlantic, if not everywhere and always. And now I conclude with my\r\n  personal thanks to all who are here tonight, especially the ladies,\r\n  who have given a fine atmosphere to this occasion and without whose\r\n  hearty and sympathetic countenances our gathering could not have been,\r\n  as I am confident it will be, a memorable one in the history of the\r\n  American Irish Historical Society.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. PATRICK J. MCCARTHY: “Rhode Island proposes three cheers for the\r\nladies.”\r\n\r\nThis suggestion met with a hearty response, and was quickly followed by\r\nsimilar proposals from representatives of Boston and New York.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: The first toast on the program is “The\r\nPresident of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt.”\r\n\r\nThis was drunk standing and was followed by three ringing cheers. The\r\norchestra then played “The Star Spangled Banner,” which was sung by the\r\nassemblage.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: We will now turn to the serious aspect of\r\nthis page in our history. This evening we are especially honored, ladies\r\nand gentlemen, by having at this table one of the most distinguished\r\nmen, not only in the United States, but in the world. Without further\r\nado, without further expression, because it is like carrying coals to\r\nNewcastle, I will go on and introduce to you Hon. Edward D. White,\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice White was greeted with hearty applause and cheering as he\r\narose, and, after order was restored, he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Mr. President-General, Gentlemen of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society, Ladies and Gentlemen_: When the privilege was extended to me\r\n  of coming here tonight there was also a request which was by me\r\n  declined, to respond to one of the set toasts. This was done because\r\n  it has been my wont since taking up judicial duty in Washington to\r\n  eschew as far as I could public speech-making, because the thought has\r\n  always been mine that if public speech-making were indulged in, even\r\n  occasionally, the habit might grow and thus I might become what it\r\n  seems to me is an abomination—a too loquacious and indiscreet\r\n  speech-making judge. Strange as it may seem to any of you who have had\r\n  to go over ponderous judicial opinions, the result of judicial work is\r\n  to cause one to hesitate about words. They come to the one who does\r\n  such work to be things which may be productive of great wrong if\r\n  misused or misapplied. True as this is as to judicial work generally,\r\n  it is more so when the character of that work in our own country is\r\n  considered. Under our system judicial duty is not confined to the\r\n  settlement of controversies between men. It is more extensive, since\r\n  it controls man in his relations to government and the relations of\r\n  government to the individual. It involves the power to limit\r\n  government itself, since upon it is cast the ultimate duty to maintain\r\n  the Constitution and apply its limitations. It, therefore, in a sense\r\n  not only restrains both the national and State governments, but\r\n  regulates their relations one to the other. From this all-embracing\r\n  extent of the judicial authority it must be apparent that in our own\r\n  country much more than in any other the discharge of judicial duty\r\n  involves the dealing with subjects of the most acute public concern,\r\n  where passion and political agitation are flagrant. When these things\r\n  are considered it is certain that the performance of the judicial\r\n  function in our country—to paraphrase the words of the Romans—involves\r\n  the science of all things human and divine, the knowledge of all\r\n  things good and evil.\r\n\r\n  “With these thoughts in my mind I stand up upon the generous\r\n  solicitation of your President and look into your kindly faces and\r\n  form the purpose to say a few words concerning your and my duty to\r\n  preserve the institutions of government with which we are blest, and\r\n  with the thought comes the admonition that I must be circumspect and\r\n  say nothing which ought not to be said. Indeed, as I speak, there\r\n  comes unbidden to my mind that beautiful prayer of the Catholic\r\n  Liturgy where the Priest, as he approaches the Gospel, invokes the aid\r\n  of Almighty God to cleanse his mouth as with a living coal in order\r\n  that his lips may be worthy to syllable the inspired subject which he\r\n  is about to approach.\r\n\r\n  “Before I say anything further, however, let me briefly establish my\r\n  right to be among you tonight upon a more intimate basis than that of\r\n  a mere guest. This can hardly be done because of my being an Irish\r\n  American, for I am only of Irish blood on my father’s side in the\r\n  fourth generation. But my right to be one of you from another point of\r\n  view is quite apparent. In the state in which I was born there lived\r\n  an Irish American bearing the name of White. At a public dinner—I do\r\n  not believe it was an Irish American affair—he sat near one whose name\r\n  was O’Rourke. Leaning over to him he said: ‘Mr. O’Rourke, what\r\n  countryman are you?’ ‘What countryman?’ said O’Rourke. ‘I am an\r\n  Irishman. Why do you ask me?’ ‘Because I thought from your name you\r\n  might be a Frenchman,’ was the reply. Quick came the retort: ‘That is\r\n  more than I can think of you, for I can kick a White out of every sod\r\n  in Ireland.’\r\n\r\n  “But there is a deeper claim than mere name on my part to be one of\r\n  you, since going back over my whole life from the time when I sat as a\r\n  boy learning to read out of a primer, down to this night, I can look\r\n  back to nothing of joy or sorrow, of success or failure, where some\r\n  Irish American friend did not stand near me aiding in the realization\r\n  or accomplishment of the one or sustaining and supporting in\r\n  submission to the other.\r\n\r\n  “When the French Republic was born some one asked a great French\r\n  orator to prove its existence. He said: ‘The Republic is like the sun;\r\n  blind is he who sees it not.’ And so tonight I shall not attempt to\r\n  recount the many and priceless services from the days of the\r\n  Revolution to this time which the Irish American has rendered to the\r\n  upbuilding of this great and free country which we possess and enjoy.\r\n  Why should this be done, since their services shine down the pathway\r\n  of our national life with an effulgence so bright that blind indeed\r\n  must he be who sees them not.\r\n\r\n  “The question which I ask myself, therefore, is not the superfluous\r\n  one of what the Irish Americans have done for our country, but what\r\n  they owe it. By what means were they enabled to render the great\r\n  services which they have rendered? The answer is clear. Their\r\n  possibilities arose from the wise, the free institutions which our\r\n  forefathers founded and under the shelter of which the Irish Americans\r\n  were enabled here to seek a haven and to establish their new homes,\r\n  thus affording them the opportunity of rendering the services which\r\n  they have rendered to the expansion and preservation of our\r\n  institutions.\r\n\r\n  “This being true, I ask myself the question, and I ask of each one of\r\n  you, how best can we honor them? How best can we show our appreciation\r\n  of the great work which they have done? The answer comes spontaneously\r\n  to the mind: By preserving and perpetuating those institutions which\r\n  have blessed them so much and which they have in return so helped to\r\n  establish and preserve.\r\n\r\n  “As I look, Mr. President, at present conditions in our country, there\r\n  are indications to my mind of great danger to our institutions. It\r\n  seems to me I observe a tendency in the minds of the people to forget\r\n  how vital to their perpetuation is the preservation of all the wise\r\n  limitations which our forefathers ordained. It seems to me that there\r\n  is a growing forgetfulness of the fact that the liberty which our\r\n  fathers founded was not license but a liberty restrained by law; that\r\n  the government which they established was one of limited powers and\r\n  divided authority, national and local, each fulfilling their separate\r\n  functions and each intended to move in their allotted sphere like the\r\n  orbs of the Sidereal universe, thus securing the plenitude of local\r\n  rights whilst at the same time obtaining national power and authority,\r\n  not unlimited, but confined to its allotted orbit.\r\n\r\n  “I say that it seems to me there is a tendency to forget these things\r\n  because it is observable at the present time that wherever an evil\r\n  obtains which needs remedying the tendency of the public mind is to\r\n  attribute the evil, not to a mistaken administration, but to the\r\n  existence of some one of those great safeguards upon the preservation\r\n  of which our institutions depend. So also it seems to me it is\r\n  observable that there is a great tendency in the public mind, whenever\r\n  it is deemed that a wrong requires remedy, to grow restive under the\r\n  restraints imposed by constitutional limitations, to regard them as\r\n  antiquated or obsolete, and thus seek to redress the wrong without\r\n  regard to those limitations, forgetful of the great truth that\r\n  whatever may be the temporary good to be accomplished by a disregard\r\n  of the fundamental limitations of our Constitution, such good is\r\n  insignificant in comparison with the untold harm which must result\r\n  from overthrowing the very foundations upon which our government rests\r\n  and by the adhering to which alone it can endure.\r\n\r\n  “Again, it seems to me that this tendency in the mind of the people\r\n  generally finds manifestation in the exertion of the powers of\r\n  government. There seems to me to be a growing tendency to chafe at the\r\n  limitations on power which the Constitution imposes; to seek to\r\n  accomplish some temporary good by means deemed to be the most direct,\r\n  wholly without reference to the question whether the resort to such\r\n  means will conflict with or set at naught those essential limitations\r\n  upon power which the Constitution was expressly adopted to secure.\r\n\r\n  “With this danger confronting us may I not say that if we would honor\r\n  and reverence the memory of the Irish Americans who have done so much\r\n  for the upbuilding of our institutions, that we may best do it by\r\n  seeing to it that the institutions which they have helped to build up\r\n  shall be preserved in all of their integrity. Ah, then, if we would\r\n  perform the duty of honoring those who have gone before, let us each\r\n  and all fix in our hearts the enduring purpose to see to it that these\r\n  evil tendencies are corrected and thereby renew and revivify our\r\n  resolution to preserve and perpetuate our institutions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. VICTOR J. DOWLING.\r\n\r\n  Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York.\r\n\r\n  Jurist, Author and Historian.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “With this in mind, before I take my seat let me propose to you a\r\n  toast: ‘The Irish American of today, and the Irish American to come.\r\n  May they honor and reverence the memory of their forerunners by\r\n  bringing the splendor of their courage, the generosity of their\r\n  devotion and the keenness of their intellect to the perpetuation of\r\n  the government which the fathers founded, embodying, as it does,\r\n  liberty restrained from license, government, both national and local,\r\n  with limited and defined powers in the continued existence of which\r\n  our future of peace and prosperity are bound up and in whose\r\n  perpetuation the hopes of all mankind who value true liberty are so\r\n  intimately involved.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Justice White’s eloquent and graceful address received the closest\r\nattention, and great applause and cheering followed the stirring toast\r\nat the end.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: “Ladies and Gentlemen, some time ago I was\r\npresent at an entertainment where the orator of the occasion bore an\r\ninternational reputation. The chairman of the evening took an hour and a\r\nquarter to introduce the gentleman, but his speech lasted only a quarter\r\nof an hour. Now I could take an hour and a half to introduce the next\r\nspeaker to you, but I will just announce his name, the Hon. Victor J.\r\nDowling, Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, who will\r\nrespond to the toast “Irish Pioneers in New York.””\r\n\r\n\r\n  Judge Dowling said:\r\n\r\n  “While we know that an Irishman was in Columbus’ crew on his first\r\n  voyage to the New World, we have no means of ascertaining whether any\r\n  of his countrymen were on the ships of either Verrazano, Gomez or\r\n  Hudson, upon the first three occasions when the Bay of New York was\r\n  seen by Europeans. The mystery which has enveloped the early life of\r\n  Hudson and which shrouded his end surrounds as well many of the\r\n  details of his memorable cruise. We do know that besides the captain\r\n  there were but two aboard that vessel out of its total equipment of\r\n  from sixteen to twenty men who spoke English—Robert Juet of Limehouse,\r\n  England, the captain’s clerk, who kept the journal of the voyage, and\r\n  one John Colman, a sailor, referred to as an Englishman by Juet, but\r\n  who may have been of Irish descent. He was evidently an experienced\r\n  seafaring man and a follower of Hudson’s, for in the first known\r\n  reference to the latter, which is the record of his voyage of\r\n  discovery for the Muscovy Company, April 19, 1607, in search of a\r\n  passage by way of the North Pole to Japan and China, Colman was one of\r\n  the sailors. As Hudson passed the Highlands of Navesink September 1,\r\n  1609, and entered the lower bay, he was so impressed with its beauty\r\n  that he described it as ‘a very good land to fall in with, and a\r\n  pleasant land to see.’ On September 6 a boat’s crew was dispatched\r\n  from the ship and, entering and passing the Narrows, beheld the first\r\n  view of Manhattan Island. The land encircling the bay was covered with\r\n  trees, grass and flowers and the air was filled with delightful\r\n  fragrance. On their return the crew were attacked by Indians in two\r\n  canoes, and John Colman was killed by an arrow piercing his throat—the\r\n  first blood offering to the approaching civilization which was to\r\n  revolutionize the hitherto peaceful scene.\r\n\r\n  “While the Dutch occupation of New Amsterdam continued, we find no\r\n  positive traces of Irish names or inhabitants, save in two instances.\r\n  One is the mention of the Irishman from Virginia who went to\r\n  confession to Father Jogues in 1643, while the latter was temporarily\r\n  sojourning in the town after his rescue by the Dutch from the hands of\r\n  the Indians, and who advised the latter of the presence of Jesuit\r\n  fathers in Virginia. The other is the name, several times appearing,\r\n  of ‘Thomas, the Irishman,’ concerning whom I have been able to collect\r\n  many scattered items. His real name was Thomas Lewis, although he is\r\n  to be found referred to at various times as ‘Thomas, the Irishman,’\r\n  ‘the Irishman,’ and Lodewycksen or Lodewycksz, as well as by his\r\n  proper name. He was the captain of one of Director Stuyvesant’s war\r\n  yachts, which served for a dispatch-boat as well.\r\n\r\n  “His was an interesting career, and I am glad to be able to present\r\n  some of its salient features, which may enjoy at least the merits of\r\n  novelty. He was born in Belfast, and becoming involved in the\r\n  Cromwellian wars, his family was dispersed, his two sisters first\r\n  flying to Holland for refuge, where they afterwards died. They were\r\n  followed by Lewis, who upon their death applied to the West India\r\n  Company at Amsterdam and was by them sent to New York. In the\r\n  Directors’ letter to Director Stuyvesant and his Council (June 14,\r\n  1656), they notify the latter: ‘In the ship _Blauwe Duiff_ (Blue Dove)\r\n  goes also over Thomas Lodewicksen, carpenter, for whom the Company,\r\n  too, paid the fare, on condition of his remaining in New Netherland\r\n  for three years, or if he leave before he must refund the passage\r\n  money to you in Holland coin or its equivalent.’ The _Blauwe Duiff_\r\n  arrived here September 5, 1656. Lewis appears to have gone to Albany\r\n  (then Fort Orange) for in 1658 he was in partnership there with\r\n  Reynier Wisselpennigh as carpenters and builders and they sued the\r\n  local church for 270 guilders for building the ‘Doop-huysie’\r\n  (baptistry) and received the full amount. In 1661 his partner and he\r\n  had differences over the cost of fitting out a sloop they were\r\n  building. He must have come to New Amsterdam shortly thereafter, as\r\n  the court records here show. In the meantime he had married, in Fort\r\n  Orange, Geesje Barents.\r\n\r\n  “On October 17, 1662, Reiner Wisselpenninck brought suit against\r\n  ‘Tomas, the Irishman’ in the Mayor’s Court at the City Hall, to\r\n  recover a balance of six beavers due for a half-interest in a bark,\r\n  and two beavers for a barrel of tar. Defendant counterclaimed and\r\n  plaintiff had judgment for three beavers only. On May 29, 1663,\r\n  certain tobacco contained in the bark of ‘Thomas, the Irishman’ and\r\n  belonging to Samuel Etsal was attached in a suit against the latter.\r\n  Hendrick Zanzen Smith sued Gysbert Frerickzen October 2, 1663, and in\r\n  that action an attachment was levied on moneys belonging to defendant\r\n  in the hands of ‘Thomas, the Irishman.’\r\n\r\n  “In June, 1663, Director Stuyvesant sailed from Manhattan to Wildwyck\r\n  (Kingston) on Lewis’ yacht, and on the 15th of the month while lying\r\n  in the ‘Long Reach’ (North River) he sent a message to the magistrates\r\n  at Fort Orange, in the course of which he noted ‘this is written in\r\n  haste on board of the Irishman’s yacht.’\r\n\r\n  “In the correspondence between Director Stuyvesant and Captain Cregier\r\n  at the Esopus and in the minutes of the government of the latter\r\n  reference is made five times in 1663 to the arrival of Lewis at ‘the\r\n  redoubt’ at Esopus from Manhattan; on August 5th, on September 1st\r\n  (when he and Claesje Hoorn came in their yachts) and on September\r\n  17th, 19th and 21st. On all these occasions he is referred to as\r\n  ‘Thomas, the Irishman.’ In an order of the Council, August 29, 1663,\r\n  Tomos Lodewyck and Claes Lock were ordered to await orders from\r\n  Captain Cregier before the Redoubt (Roudont). This was during the\r\n  Indian war in the Esopus.\r\n\r\n  “Thomas Lewis was an active and successful man, and in addition to\r\n  being a ship-owner and pilot was evidently engaged in trade and in the\r\n  sale of liquor. He first figured in the Mayor’s Court February 5,\r\n  1667, when he was sued by John Danrell, and the matter was referred to\r\n  arbitrators. On the 7th of the same month he contributed eight beaver\r\n  skins to the support of the minister. He was engaged in a long\r\n  controversy with Simon Turcq in 1668 over 230 planks, which he claimed\r\n  to have theretofore paid, and out of which rose a suit against Poulus\r\n  Leenderson for ninety of the same boards. In 1669 he was sued by\r\n  Warner Wessels, the city farmer, for taking into his house ’1 hogshead\r\n  of rum and 3 anckers of stilled waters’ without accounting therefor.\r\n  This suit he won. But he lost an action brought by Hendrick Obe to\r\n  recover f.79.5 in wampum for the excise duties on some wine and beer.\r\n  At a Council meeting held at Elizabethtown, New Jersey, November 7,\r\n  1671, it was ordered that no corn or provision be transported out of\r\n  the Delaware River except what was then aboard the sloop of Thomas\r\n  Lewis, then in the river, for which he was given a special license. In\r\n  1672 he sued William Waldron for borrowing his boat without his\r\n  consent, and then setting it adrift, when it was thereafter found by\r\n  John Benneco at Staten Island, who demanded salvage. The defendant was\r\n  mulcted in the salvage and was directed to turn the boat over to the\r\n  owner, who was to send his boy to the island to take possession of it.\r\n  At a council held at Fort James January 27, 1673, permission was given\r\n  to all vessels from this point to go up the Delaware River above New\r\n  Castle, upon producing the Governor’s certificate in consequence of a\r\n  complaint concerning Capt. Lewis’ sloop. During the Dutch\r\n  re-occupation of the city, when war again threatened, we find in the\r\n  ‘Records of New Amsterdam’ ‘that the Schout, Burgomasters and Schepens\r\n  being assembled “Collegialiter” in the City Hall of New Orange March\r\n  10, 1674, they sent for the skippers and barquers of the city, when\r\n  they were notified of the Governor General’s order that no more than\r\n  two sloops shall go at once to Willemstadt and Esopus, and one to the\r\n  South river, and that they sail alternately to be determined by lot;\r\n  also that no passengers be conveyed without passports.’ Whereupon the\r\n  skippers making known in turn their views, ‘Thomas Lewis is satisfied\r\n  with what the Governor and Council decree.’\r\n\r\n  “We find records of trips made by him to Virginia, Boston, Rhode\r\n  Island and the Delaware (South) River from 1665 to 1669, carrying\r\n  merchandise of all kinds. September 26, 1671, Governor Lovelace\r\n  promises ‘Mr. Tom’ at the Delaware to send him information by Peter\r\n  Alrick ‘who tomorrow will embark in Tom the Irishman’s yacht.’ In\r\n  1675, he was appointed to make a calculation of the expense for\r\n  building a new church in conjunction with Adolph Pieters and Abraham\r\n  Jansen. We find that in 1678 he owned a sloop called the _Katharine_.\r\n\r\n  “In a list of the richest inhabitants of New York made February 19,\r\n  1674, Thomas Lewis is credited with the possession of property valued\r\n  at 6,000 florins, Holland currency, only sixteen appearing therein as\r\n  being wealthier. At the time of the English occupation he owned real\r\n  estate on the west side of Pearl Street between Wall and William\r\n  streets, then known as the Water Side, then valued at $10,000; also on\r\n  the South Street (now William) between Hanover Square and Wall Street.\r\n\r\n  “From the records of the baptisms in the Dutch church we learn that he\r\n  had eight children, named, respectively, Barent, Cornelia, Leendert,\r\n  Catharina, Cornelia, Thomas, Cornelis and Rachel. Anthony Brockholst\r\n  was one of the witnesses at the baptism of the last named in 1678. The\r\n  descendants of Barent, Leendert (or Leonard) and Thomas are scattered\r\n  throughout the Hudson Valley, and the family name appears at various\r\n  times in the records as Lenwis, Leuis, Lieuwens, Lieuwes, Lieuwis,\r\n  Lievens, Lievenszen, Lieuens, Liewensen, Liewes, and Liewis. In the\r\n  New York Genealogical and Biographical Record (Volume XXXIV) the date\r\n  of Thomas Lewis’ death is given as September 24, 1684, and his age as\r\n  56. His will was admitted to probate under Governor Dougan, April 1,\r\n  1686, and letters testamentary were issued to his wife Geesie Lewis.\r\n  She then lived with her daughter Catharine along the Strand (Lang\r\n  Strant) and they were members of the Dutch church. Her sons then\r\n  living were Barent, Thomas and Leonard, with the eldest Lodiwick\r\n  (apparently born at Fort Orange) who at the time of his father’s death\r\n  was living with Lewis Thomson at Belfast, and thereupon returned to\r\n  New York, where he died without issue.\r\n\r\n  “But there are some names of merchants doing business here from 1643\r\n  to 1647 which, if not English, must be Irish, and while the present\r\n  ascertainment of their exact nationality seems hopeless, yet careful\r\n  research might still enroll them in the honor roll of Irish pioneers.\r\n  These were Rev. Francis Doughty, the English minister, residing in\r\n  Pearl Street, between Whitehall and State streets, who on March 28,\r\n  1647, received a grant of 6,666 (Dutch) acres of land at Mespath\r\n  (Newtown patent); Robert Butler, residing on the same street, between\r\n  Stone and Bridge streets; Michael Pickett, residing on Broad Street,\r\n  near Beaver; and Thomas Sanderson, residing on Beaver Street, who\r\n  received grants of land on this island July 13, 1643, October 25,\r\n  1653, and September 14, 1665.\r\n\r\n  “There was a Jan Patrickx or John Patrick here in 1653 and a James\r\n  Code or Cody in 1658. Thomas Higgins was sued for value of 275 pieces\r\n  of firewood on November 20, 1661, and by Thomas Hall for the return of\r\n  a saw January 31, 1662.\r\n\r\n  “Among the names of those to whom grants of land under the Dutch\r\n  occupancy were made were Thomas Hall, Thomas Chambers and George\r\n  Holmes, each receiving more than one grant; the first two took the\r\n  oath of allegiance to the English authorities between October 21 and\r\n  26, 1664.\r\n\r\n  “The English capture of New Amsterdam in 1664 did not, so far as we\r\n  have any records, lead to any influx of Irish settlers here. So novel\r\n  was their coming that we find reference made as a remarkable fact to\r\n  the presence of the person, unnamed, who is supposed to have been the\r\n  first direct Irish immigrant to New York, being an Irish girl, a\r\n  servant in the household of Isaac Allerton, a well-known English\r\n  tobacco merchant, and who was working therein in 1665, shortly after\r\n  the English occupation. Little could she have dreamt of the host of\r\n  her sister voyagers who brought to this country the spirit of\r\n  devotion, of self-sacrifice, of faithful discharge of duty, which\r\n  ultimately forced itself upon the grudgingly-given attention of the\r\n  community and admiration for which as well as for the tenderness and\r\n  purity of the women of the Irish race was the most potent force in\r\n  tearing down the wall of hostility and hatred which intolerance and\r\n  ignorance had reared in the way of the progress of the Irishmen in\r\n  this country towards recognition, equality and success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. JOHN J. DALY.\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  An Earnest and Helpful Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “Patrick Hayes must have been a resident of the city for some years.\r\n  He apparently came from the colony of Maryland. We find a record of\r\n  his service as a juryman in the Mayor’s Court on many occasions during\r\n  the year 1666. He evidently was a tapster and hotel-keeper, for he had\r\n  controversy with the excise in 1667. He must have been engaged in\r\n  general business as well, for in suits between third parties moneys\r\n  were attached in his hands in 1667 and he sued various parties for\r\n  goods sold in 1667 and 1668. In two of these cases Thomas Carr was a\r\n  joint plaintiff. In the action of William Urgent against John Ashman\r\n  for slander, June 2, 1668, he was a witness to prove his knowledge of\r\n  the plaintiff as a freeman in the province of Maryland. John Daaly was\r\n  a plaintiff in two suits in the Mayor’s Court in 1670. John Quigly\r\n  figures as a plaintiff in the Mayor’s Court against Ralph Huddison\r\n  August 15, 1671, when he sued successfully to recover £16, 10 sh., for\r\n  earthenware sold. He served as a juror in the same month, and was one\r\n  of the arbitrators appointed in the suit of Samuel Bach and David\r\n  Gomer against the Ketch Betty (attached). Dennis McKarty sued Thomas\r\n  Edwards, master of the Ketch ‘Society’ in the Mayor’s Court October\r\n  24, 1671, to recover £5 for cutting and chipping logwood, and\r\n  recovered judgment. He was himself sued by Samuel Hall November 14,\r\n  1671. Thomas Griffin was one of the public cartmen of the city\r\n  February 13, 1672.\r\n\r\n  “During the intervening years, until the Dutch re-occupation in 1673,\r\n  when its name was changed to New Orange, the city saw but few Irish\r\n  faces and the list of the burghers contains no Irish names. Upon the\r\n  re-cession of the city to England in 1674, when English rule became an\r\n  assured fact, it is reasonable to suppose that some Irish arrivals\r\n  must have been noted. Yet we can only surmise that from the names as\r\n  we afterwards find them on the rolls. So, in 1674, Andrew Clare is\r\n  recorded as owning land on Pearl Street, between Whitehall and State\r\n  streets; in 1677, we note as residing here, William Walsh; in 1680,\r\n  Abraham Corbett, a distiller, residing on Broadway near Exchange\r\n  Place, and William Cox, flour merchant, residing on Hanover Square; in\r\n  1691, Lawrence Reade; in 1695, John Morris and Peter Matthews; in\r\n  1698, William Morris; in 1702, Thomas Flynn, surgeon, and Patrick\r\n  Crawford; in 1703, John Barr, Thomas Carroll, Richard Flemming,\r\n  Bartholomew Hart, Henry Mooney and Peter Moran; in 1708, Anthony\r\n  Lynch; in 1710, Thomas Kearney; in 1711, James Maxwell. All these were\r\n  freemen. In 1696, the then Governor Fletcher returned to the home\r\n  authorities a list of eleven Irish Catholics residing in the city,\r\n  none of whom was a burgher nor a landowner. Captain Evans, of the\r\n  _Richmond_ frigate, who was here with the Governor, was the son of an\r\n  Irish shoemaker.\r\n\r\n  “It is significant that we first begin to notice Irish names after the\r\n  administration of Governor Dongan had commenced. The commanding\r\n  position held by an Irishman for the first time in Colonial history\r\n  must have attracted to this colony many of his less favored\r\n  compatriots, who found here not only a haven of refuge where they\r\n  could practise their religion, but a favored spot where under his\r\n  enlightened sway the hope of entire civil liberty was near\r\n  realization. The life and services of Thomas Dongan have never\r\n  received their just recognition at the hands of historians, nor do we\r\n  realize the debt, which, as citizens of a great city, we owe this man\r\n  whose conceptions of liberty were far in advance of his time. At the\r\n  risk of triteness I cannot forbear epitomizing his career, for it is\r\n  that of the first Irishman who not only figured prominently in the\r\n  city’s history, but, as well, moulded its future and made it possible\r\n  of achievement. Thomas Dongan, second Earl of Limerick, was born in\r\n  1634 at Castletown, County Kildare, Ireland, the youngest of the three\r\n  sons of Sir John Dongan, Baronet. His mother was a sister of Richard\r\n  Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel and Lieutenant-Governor of Ireland. The\r\n  family removed to France after the execution of Charles I, when Dongan\r\n  entered the army and was commissioned by Louis XIV, in an Irish\r\n  regiment, where he rose by degrees to the rank of Colonel. Returning\r\n  to England after the Restoration, after declining an offer of\r\n  preferment in the French Army, he was commissioned and an annual\r\n  pension of five hundred pounds given him. In the same year, 1678, he\r\n  was sent as Lieutenant-Governor to Tangier under Lord Inchiquin, where\r\n  he served for two years, returning to London to spend the life of a\r\n  man of society and a favorite at Court. Through the influence of the\r\n  Duke of York he was made Governor of the Province of New York, his\r\n  jurisdiction including parts of Maine besides Long Island, Martha’s\r\n  Vineyard, Nantucket and all the land from the Connecticut River to\r\n  Delaware Bay. He was also commissioned Vice-Admiral. Arriving in New\r\n  York August 25, 1683, from Nantasket, he had on the way hither\r\n  promised the inhabitants of the easterly end of Long Island that ‘no\r\n  laws or rates for the future should be imposed but by a General\r\n  Assembly’—but a slight foretaste of what he was really to accomplish.\r\n  The population of the city was then less than four thousand and it\r\n  extended from the Bay to the entrenchments along Wall Street. From the\r\n  Collect Pond (the site of the Tombs) to the northwest towards the\r\n  North River extended a marsh of seventy acres. From the Bouweries to\r\n  Harlem there stretched a wood haunted by bears and wolves, and within\r\n  the city walls themselves bear hunts took place in the orchards, one\r\n  located between Cedar Street and Maiden Lane. Under his rule, general\r\n  hunts were held to exterminate wolves from the city. The inhabitants\r\n  were largely Dutch, but there were many French Huguenots and some few\r\n  English. In this rather primitive community, great things were about\r\n  to be done for liberty. Pursuant to his instructions from the Duke,\r\n  Dongan ordered an election of a ‘General Assembly of all the\r\n  freeholders by the persons whom they shall choose to represent them,’\r\n  in order to consider with the Governor and Council ‘what laws are fit\r\n  and necessary to be made and established for the good weal and\r\n  government of the said colony and its dependencies and all the\r\n  inhabitants thereof,’ with full liberty of consultation and debate\r\n  among the members. All laws passed were to be subject to the veto of\r\n  the Governor, and if approved by him were to be submitted to the Duke\r\n  of York, remaining effective until disapproved by him. It is to the\r\n  glory of Dongan that he not only approved but initiated many of the\r\n  revolutionary measures afterwards enacted. On September 13, 1683, a\r\n  date memorable in the city’s history, the Freeholders of New York,\r\n  Long Island, Esopus, Albany and Martha’s Vineyard were notified to\r\n  elect representatives to meet in General Assembly in New York City on\r\n  October 17th. Seventeen delegates responded, whereof four were from\r\n  New York and Harlem. This first popular representative assembly met at\r\n  Fort James, and Matthias Nicoll was speaker. Fourteen acts were\r\n  passed, whereof the most important was, ‘The Charter of Liberties and\r\n  Privileges granted by His Royal Highness to the inhabitants of New\r\n  York and its dependencies.’ This was declared to be enacted ‘for the\r\n  better establishing the government of this province of New York, and\r\n  that justice and right may be equally done within the same.’ Among the\r\n  provisions of this well-named Charter of Liberties were those\r\n  providing for at least a triennial session of the General Assembly;\r\n  that every freeholder and freeman should have the elective franchise\r\n  without constraint or imposition; that majorities should decide every\r\n  issue; that representatives should be apportioned among the counties;\r\n  that the members should enjoy all the privileges of members of\r\n  Parliament; and in fine extending to the inhabitants of this colony\r\n  all the rights and privileges which Englishmen at home enjoyed under\r\n  Magna Charta and the provisions of English law. Entire freedom of\r\n  conscience and of religion were guaranteed to all peaceable persons\r\n  ‘which profess faith in God by Jesus Christ,’ and the privileges of\r\n  all existing churches and their discipline were protected. No tax was\r\n  to be levied without the consent of the Governor, Council and\r\n  Assembly, thus recognizing the principle which the people had wrested\r\n  from Mary of Burgundy, in 1477, by the charter called ‘The Great\r\n  Privilege.’ And thus, for the first time in America, the people were\r\n  recognized as having legislative power and authority. Accepted by the\r\n  Governor and proclaimed October 31, 1683, a new standard was set for\r\n  popular liberty and popular aspiration so that Governor Hunter was\r\n  able to write to Dean Swift, in 1704, ‘this is the plan of government\r\n  they all aim at and make no scruple to own.’ The Duke of York accepted\r\n  this charter October 4, 1684, but when he became King James II he\r\n  refused to confirm it as being too liberal and implying too much\r\n  recognition of the people as a political entity, and it died by his\r\n  veto October 4, 1684. But the seed had been sown, and its growth could\r\n  not be stopped. At the same session, courts of justice were by statute\r\n  provided for; the naturalization of aliens was prescribed, and twelve\r\n  counties were established in the province. To add to the other\r\n  landmarks of his administration, a charter was granted to New York\r\n  City April 27, 1686, which has since continued to be the basis of our\r\n  municipal laws, rights, privileges, public property and franchises.\r\n  ‘It was worded with care and showed that those who framed it were\r\n  possessed of a broad and enlightened sense of the sanctity of\r\n  corporate and private rights.’\r\n\r\n  “During all his busy rule, Dongan was kept occupied with questions of\r\n  statesmanship which none but an able and resourceful man could have\r\n  handled; whether adjusting boundary disputes with New Jersey,\r\n  Pennsylvania or Connecticut, or outgeneralling the Governor General of\r\n  Canada at his own game; whether negotiating with the Indians or\r\n  planning combinations with the other colonies to resist French\r\n  aggression or undertake offense operations;—in every phase of his\r\n  varied activities he displayed resourcefulness, tact and power.\r\n\r\n  “He was a humane man. Under the Duke’s laws, in force from 1665 to\r\n  1683, no Christian could keep a slave; but the New Yorkers, being\r\n  unable to keep pace with the New Englanders, who habitually used their\r\n  services, slaves were allowed to be kept by orders from England. But\r\n  in the instructions which Dongan issued May 29, 1686, it was directed\r\n  that no cruelty should be practised upon them, and the wilful killing\r\n  of Indians and negroes was to be punished with death. We find as well\r\n  on October 6, 1687, he proposed to his Council that some means be\r\n  found for releasing Spaniards and other free people who were held here\r\n  as slaves and that he forbade their masters either to sell or trade\r\n  such persons pending their appeal for liberty. Again, July 30, 1688,\r\n  he ordered that ‘all Indian slaves within the province, subjects of\r\n  the King of Spain, that can give an account of their Christian faith\r\n  and say the Lord’s Prayer shall be forthwith set at liberty, and sent\r\n  home at the first convenience, and likewise them that shall hereafter\r\n  come to this Province.’\r\n\r\n  “The troubles accumulating in England found their echo here and the\r\n  King prohibited the establishing of printing-presses here, and on\r\n  January 20, 1687, dissolved the popular Assembly. In that year Dongan\r\n  wrote ‘one of the most careful as well as most honest pictures of his\r\n  provincial government which an American subordinate ever sent home to\r\n  his English sovereign.’ In the course of it he says: ‘I believe for\r\n  these seven years past there has not come over into this province\r\n  twenty English, Scotch or Irish families.’\r\n\r\n  “The entire winter of 1687 he spent at Albany, supervising the\r\n  protection of the colony against the French, and being without\r\n  financial help from the other settlements, he pledged his personal\r\n  credit and mortgaged his farm on Staten Island for £2,000 to meet the\r\n  expenses of the expedition then raised.\r\n\r\n  “On March 23, 1688, he was superseded as Governor by Andros, who was\r\n  made Governor General of New England in America, comprising all of\r\n  British North America, except Pennsylvania. Dongan was offered the\r\n  rank of Major General, which he refused in order to remain in New\r\n  York. His homestead was at Hempstead, Long Island. He owned a hunting\r\n  lodge on his estates at Castleton, Staten Island, which were named\r\n  after his original home; and he had property at Martha’s Vineyard as\r\n  well. His city residence was on Broadway, between Maiden Lane and Ann\r\n  Street, where his flower garden was a special feature. Between these\r\n  places he spent his time, seeking to rebuild his fortune, severely\r\n  shattered by his expenditures for the protection of the colony he\r\n  loved, until the reins of power fell into the hands of Jacob Leisler,\r\n  after the flight of James II to France, when Dongan was hunted as a\r\n  rebel and enemy of the new régime, and driven to seek refuge on his\r\n  brigantine, on which he kept in hiding in the lower Bay. The winds\r\n  being adverse, he was unable to sail away, and flying to New York in\r\n  secret, thence to New London, to Hempstead, to New Jersey, and to\r\n  Boston the first advocate of popular rights was finally forced to\r\n  escape the persecutions of the people, whose liberties he had assured,\r\n  by sailing to England in 1691. Never repaid any considerable part of\r\n  the fortune he had spent to defend the honor of his country and the\r\n  safety of her colony, he died, without issue, December 14, 1715, at\r\n  the age of eighty-one years. With him the history of Irish activity in\r\n  New York may well be said to begin. While he came here as an official,\r\n  he identified himself with the Colony and with the City, and grew so\r\n  to love it that no honors appealed to him which involved leaving it.\r\n  To have been the means of assisting in conferring upon a people\r\n  popular government, civic liberty and religious freedom in an age of\r\n  despotism and persecution, is an honor which reflects credit upon the\r\n  race to which he belonged, as well as upon himself. He has been\r\n  characterized by historians as ‘an excellent and prudent magistrate’\r\n  (Winsor); ‘a man of integrity, moderation and genteel manners, who may\r\n  be classed among the best of our governors’ (Smith); ‘his firm and\r\n  judicious policy, his steadfast integrity and his pleasing and\r\n  courteous address soon won the affections of the people and made him\r\n  one of the most popular of the Royal governors’ (Booth); ‘of a noble,\r\n  praiseworthy mind and spirit’ (Gov. Hinckley); ‘a ruler who for\r\n  breadth of mind, wide sympathy and executive ability stands far in\r\n  advance of his times and measured by the system of government which he\r\n  inaugurated, is easily one of the most attractive and momentous\r\n  personages in American Colonial History’ (Driscoll). It is significant\r\n  that this great Irish pioneer should have been an office holder, a\r\n  tradition which the race did not forget when its hour of opportunity\r\n  arrived. It may be said at this time that three other royal governors\r\n  of the colony were of Irish birth, the Earl of Bellomont, who served\r\n  from 1698, and who was the son of Baron Coote of Colooney; William\r\n  Cosby, who arrived August 1, 1732, and who was an Equerry of the\r\n  Queen, Colonel of the Royal Irish Regiment and the tenth son of\r\n  Alexander Cosby of Stradbally, Queens County; and Sir William Tryon,\r\n  the last of the line. But no one of these ever identified himself with\r\n  the colony or is to be reckoned with as a constructive force.\r\n\r\n  “After Dongan departs from the scene, we again have a long period of\r\n  silence upon Irishmen in New York. The meagerness of detail as to\r\n  anything affecting their names, their activities or their achievements\r\n  is disheartening. Much of it may be attributed to the lack of wealth\r\n  or social standing upon the part of those who immigrated here in the\r\n  end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries.\r\n  Much may be charged to their desire to conceal themselves from\r\n  persecution and worse. There must have been refugees here from\r\n  Virginia, New England and the Barbadoes, where penal laws were\r\n  savagely enforced. Maryland must have furnished its quota when\r\n  religious liberty was abolished. But New York seems never to have been\r\n  so favorite a resort for the persecuted as Pennsylvania. Then again\r\n  many redemptioners must have come here, when their time of service had\r\n  expired. These were the immigrants who were unable to pay their\r\n  passage and who on arriving were sold for a specified time to those\r\n  who would reimburse the ship captain for their carriage.\r\n\r\n  “In October, 1700, a number of recruits arrived in New York from\r\n  Ireland, and one of them, Cottrill, a former ensign in King James’\r\n  army, was shot in the Fort here for participation in a mutiny. It is\r\n  evident from reading the record that these men had been impressed into\r\n  the service and coming here involuntarily, sought freedom on their\r\n  arrival. In the answers which Brigadier Hunter sent to Secretary\r\n  Popple, August 11, 1720, he wrote: ‘The inhabitants increase day by\r\n  day from New England, and of late from the North of Ireland.’\r\n\r\n  “Among the North of Ireland emigrants to New York are many who figured\r\n  prominently in the religious life of the colony. Rev. Charles Inglis,\r\n  afterwards Rector of Trinity Church, came here as a missionary in\r\n  1759. In 1766 Philip Embury arrived, and helped to found the John\r\n  Street Church. He is among the pioneers of the Methodist Episcopal\r\n  Church in America. In that year Paul Runkle, Luke Rose, Jacob Heck,\r\n  Peter Barkman and Henry Williams, all referred to as Irish Palatines,\r\n  landed. Charles White and Richard Sause, prominent in Methodist\r\n  circles, came from Dublin in 1766, and later, John McClaskey and Paul\r\n  Hick.\r\n\r\n  “Major Henry Dawson left Dublin in 1760 and resided here for many\r\n  years, serving as Clerk of the Common Council for twenty-six years.\r\n\r\n  “Among the freemen of the city we find the following significant\r\n  names: 1740, Bartholomew Ryan; 1741, John Ryan and John Lamb; 1743,\r\n  Patrick Phagan, John McGie, John Christie, John Brannigan, John\r\n  Connelly, Andrew Cannon, William Blake; 1744, Andrew Carroll, Anthony\r\n  Glin; 1745, Benjamin Daly, John Carr, Bryan Nevin; 1746, Donald McCoy,\r\n  Hugh Rogers; 1747, Timothy Allan, Hugh Mulligan, James Welch, Hugh\r\n  Gill, John McGoers, Jr., Alexander McCoy; 1748, Philip Hogan, Matthew\r\n  Morris; 1749, Alexander Connelly, physician. In 1761 the poll list\r\n  included seventy-four characteristic Irish names.\r\n\r\n  “Immigration from Ireland to the colonies in general did not become\r\n  noticeable until 1718. It was then a steady influx, though not very\r\n  large in numbers, until 1755, when it fell off and remained of less\r\n  amount until after the Revolution. At the outset, the Irish families\r\n  immigrating were almost entirely Presbyterians. The first Presbyterian\r\n  clergyman in New York was Rev. Francis McKemie, born in Ireland, who\r\n  arrived here in 1707. He was a brave and fearless man, whose pulpit\r\n  utterances led to his trial for libel, upon which he was acquitted.\r\n  The large Catholic exodus did not begin until after our Independence\r\n  had been achieved. A prominent citizen of New York in the eighteenth\r\n  century was Sir Peter Warren, born in County Meath in 1702, and the\r\n  uncle of the famous William Johnson, also born in County Meath in\r\n  1715, whose life is a romance. Warren was a very heavy real estate\r\n  holder in the city, owning 260 acres here, much of his holdings being\r\n  of land which since has become enormously valuable. Warren Street is\r\n  named after him. He was a prominent social figure in Colonial life.\r\n  Among the names of those who were active in commercial life in New\r\n  York City, prior to the Revolution, are many Irishmen, who figured as\r\n  some of the most successful and reputable merchants of their time.\r\n  Such were the two Wallaces, Alexander and Hugh, who were in business\r\n  from 1750, Hugh being the second President of the Chamber of Commerce;\r\n  Miles Sherbrooke, one of the founders of the Chamber in 1768, and a\r\n  member of the Committee of Correspondence, the advance guard of the\r\n  Revolution; Patrick McDavitt, an auctioneer in Kings Street, from\r\n  1768; Alexander Mulligan, an importer of Irish goods, beef, linen and\r\n  other commodities; Hercules Mulligan, a merchant tailor; Oliver\r\n  Templeton, an auctioneer; Daniel McCormick, also an auctioneer. During\r\n  the time of the Revolution and following it, we find the names of\r\n  Michael Connolly, dealer in lumber; William and James Constable, in\r\n  the West Indian, China and Indian trade; the Pollocks, Carlisle,\r\n  George and Hugh; John Haggerty, an auctioneer; William Edgar; John\r\n  Glover; John W. and Philip Kearney, commission merchandise; John and\r\n  Nathan McVickar, linen drapers; Alexander McComb, a fur dealer and\r\n  then a land speculator, who invested heavily in city real estate; and\r\n  Michael Hogan, in the commission and shipping business, who owned, and\r\n  in memory of his birthplace in County Clare, named the northern part\r\n  of his holdings, Claremont. All these men were representative,\r\n  flourishing men, who stood as high in public esteem as any of the\r\n  residents of the city of that day. They were all either Irish by birth\r\n  or by immediate descent. How many of their poorer fellow-countrymen\r\n  were then here we have no means of knowing, but it is significant that\r\n  while the Jews had a synagogue here from 1730, there was no Catholic\r\n  place of worship from the time when Dongan had Mass said within the\r\n  Fort until the year 1786.\r\n\r\n  “Lieutenant-General John Maunsell was born in 1724, the son of Richard\r\n  Maunsell of Limerick, a member of Parliament from 1741 to 1761.\r\n  Commissioned as an ensign in 1741, he was at the sieges of Louisburg,\r\n  Quebec, Montreal, Martinique and Havana, during which time he rose to\r\n  be Captain and finally in 1761 Major of the 60th or Royal Americans.\r\n  He was gazetted for gallantry Lieutenant-Colonel of the 83d Regiment\r\n  October 31, 1762, and was thereafter transferred to the 27th Foot\r\n  (Iniskillings). He had received for his services a grant of land\r\n  adjoining Major Skene’s at Whitehall (old Skenesborough). Coming to\r\n  New York City, he married for his second wife Elizabeth Stillwell,\r\n  widow of Captain Peter Wraxall, at Trinity Church, June 11, 1763. He\r\n  lived here with his wife at Greenwich, in the Ninth Ward, in property\r\n  belonging to Oliver DeLancey, until he sailed for England with other\r\n  loyalists in May, 1775, leaving his wife behind him. Returning for her\r\n  in 1776, he then went to Kinsale, in Ireland, where he had received an\r\n  appointment which he had requested in order to avoid serving against\r\n  the Colonies. October 19, 1781, he was gazetted Major-General on half\r\n  pay in the Irish Establishment. Living in London until 1784 he resided\r\n  in New York continuously thereafter, his city house being at 11\r\n  Broadway. He was made Lieutenant-General October 12, 1793. He owned a\r\n  farm of 60 acres on Harlem Heights, between Morris and Watkins places,\r\n  the site now being divided by St. Nicholas Avenue. He died July 27,\r\n  1795, and was buried in the Bradhurst vault in Trinity Cemetery.\r\n\r\n  “Another striking figure of pre-Revolutionary days, and an aggressive\r\n  if unpopular one, was Hugh Gaine, the printer. And it is strange that\r\n  after Bradford and Franklin, the two great figures in the early\r\n  history of printing in America should be those of Irishmen—Gaine in\r\n  New York and Matthew Carey in Philadelphia. Gaine has been a\r\n  much-abused man and was very unpopular during the Revolutionary\r\n  period, but he is an example of a successful business man. Born at\r\n  Belfast in 1726, he was apprenticed at an early age to James McGee, a\r\n  printer there. He emigrated to New York in 1745 ‘without basket or\r\n  burden,’ and secured employment with James Parker at wages of $1.25 a\r\n  week. He went into the business of bookselling in 1752 in partnership\r\n  with William Weyman, a former apprentice of William Bradford. A\r\n  characteristic advertisement of the period is the following: ‘To be\r\n  sold by Weyman & Gaine at their House on Hunters’ Key, next door but\r\n  one to Mr. Perry’s, Watchmaker; Bibles of different Sizes, with and\r\n  without the Common Prayer; gilt and plain Common Prayers of most\r\n  sorts, Church and Meeting Psalm Books, History of the New Testament,\r\n  History of the Five Indian Nations, Account of the Earthquake at Lima,\r\n  Ovid’s Metamorphosis, Virgil, Cornelius Nepos, Mariners’ Compasses,\r\n  Scales and Dividers, Writing paper by the Quire or Sheet, also choice\r\n  good Bonnet Papers.’ On August 3, 1752, Gaine alone commenced the\r\n  publication of the _New York Mercury_ at the same store, the\r\n  subscription being twelve shillings per year, and advertisements of a\r\n  moderate length were published for five shillings each. He sold books\r\n  and stationery as well at this time, and his was one of two stores\r\n  where theatre tickets were sold. After various migrations the business\r\n  was finally located at the Bible and Crown in Hanover Square in 1745.\r\n  During a bitter controversy caused by the attempt of the Presbyterians\r\n  to curb what they thought was the undue dominance of the\r\n  Episcopalians, a letter in the form of a petition ostensibly coming\r\n  from the Irish residents in New York, was sent by a committee for\r\n  insertion in the _Mercury_, to be published anonymously; but the\r\n  letter was in bad English, misspelled and full of ridiculous\r\n  exaggerations—all purposely done—and Gaine refused to print it as a\r\n  reflection on the Irish nation, of which he was proud. _The Mercury_,\r\n  in 1758, in announcing the fall of Louisburg, printed a wood cut\r\n  diagram of the fortress—an unusual piece of enterprise for the times.\r\n  That printers did not then consider advertising the principal feature\r\n  of their papers may be inferred from his apology in an issue of 1759:\r\n  ‘We hope those of our customers whose advertisements are omitted this\r\n  week will not take it amiss, it being occasioned by the agreeable\r\n  advice received from the Fleet and Army at Quebec.’ In this connection\r\n  it may be noted that in 1755 he had offered for sale ‘A very few brass\r\n  mounted Broad Swords, late the property of his Most Christian Majesty;\r\n  so that the purchaser, in case of a French war, will have the\r\n  advantage of his enemies, as he can encounter them with their own\r\n  weapons.’ He offered for sale at various times corkscrews, razors and\r\n  wafers; playing cards, blacking balls and liquid blacking; boots,\r\n  pumps and shoes; hogs’ fat, shaving soap and German flutes; a parcel\r\n  of choice Irish butter, lottery tickets and patent medicines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. EDMOND J. CURRY.\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  A Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “Many books issued from his press, including a series of almanacs. But\r\n  his bookselling and newspaper furnished his chief source of wealth.\r\n  His paper was delivered in the city by messenger. We find him\r\n  advertising in 1780: ‘Wanted, a Person that will engage to deliver\r\n  this paper to the Customers in Town for twelve months or longer. Good\r\n  encouragement will be given. He need not attend more than four hours\r\n  every Monday.’ Printing paper being scarce, he continually advertised\r\n  for rags to be brought to him for purchase and in 1760 he commenced\r\n  advertising in this form: ‘Ready money for clean Linen Rags to be had\r\n  at H. Gaines’.’ In 1773 a paper mill was established at Hempstead by\r\n  him and two of his friends.\r\n\r\n  “Among the important printing done by his press was ‘The Votes and\r\n  Proceedings of the General Assembly,’ whereof the first volume\r\n  appeared in 1764, the second in 1766. Appointed Public Printer by the\r\n  colony, January 15, 1768, he also became the official City printer.\r\n  General Gage’s famous proclamation of June 12, 1775, was printed by\r\n  him, the work being done here that it might remain a secret in Boston\r\n  until published. Up to this time Gaine had given every proof of being\r\n  in sympathy with the cause of freedom, so that he was forced to fly to\r\n  Newark when the British occupied New York in 1776. The authorities\r\n  seized his printing plant here and published the _New York Gazette_\r\n  therefrom, using his name for a time as proprietor. Tiring of his\r\n  exile, he evidently made terms with the invaders, for he returned to\r\n  New York and his business was restored to him, the first issue of the\r\n  resumed paper dating from November 11, 1776, leaving behind him his\r\n  press at Newark, which was promptly seized by the patriots and a paper\r\n  printed thereon for some time. From this time on he was a thorough\r\n  going Tory, and was the subject of particularly virulent attack from\r\n  the Americans, the _Pennsylvania Journal_ in 1777 for example\r\n  enquiring: ‘Who is the greatest liar upon earth? Hugh Gaine of New\r\n  York.’ But he lived through the turmoil and after freedom was\r\n  obtained, he continued doing business. In 1788, against violent\r\n  protest, he received the contract for printing the paper money for the\r\n  State of New York. He was Treasurer and Vice-President of the St.\r\n  Patrick’s Society, a vestryman of Trinity Church and an active Mason.\r\n  He owned a country home at Kings Bridge Road, and a large tract of\r\n  land at Canajoharie. He bought and sold land in the city, there being\r\n  records of twenty-four parcels of land sold by himself or his\r\n  executors.\r\n\r\n  “Gaine died April 27, 1807, at the ripe age of eighty-one, and was\r\n  buried in Trinity Churchyard. Two of his children had predeceased him,\r\n  and three survived, as well as his second wife. His executors were his\r\n  son-in-law, John Kemp, and his friends Richard Harrison and Daniel\r\n  McCormick, the latter already referred to. His lines had not fallen in\r\n  pleasant places during the Revolution and his abandonment of the\r\n  patriot cause was never entirely forgiven, but as a business man his\r\n  integrity was never questioned.\r\n\r\n  “It is not my purpose to refer to Irish activity in the city during\r\n  Revolutionary days, for that would be a field worthy of independent\r\n  study and treatment. The roll of the martyrs of the _Jersey_ prison\r\n  ship, for example, is studded with Irish names. Nor is it pertinent to\r\n  our subject, for no pioneers came here then, as the tide of\r\n  immigration practically stopped during the war, although it is worthy\r\n  of note that Richard Montgomery, destined to undying fame, bought a\r\n  farm at Kingsbridge in 1773, and had intended to make this city his\r\n  home. He was born at Swords, near Feltrim, Ireland. Like nearly all\r\n  the Irish of New York, he did not hesitate a moment before casting his\r\n  life and fortune into the balance when the call to arms came.\r\n\r\n  “But after the declaration of peace the Irish Catholic influx began.\r\n  Among those whose names have survived, no one stands higher than\r\n  Dominick Lynch. Born in Galway in 1754, he received a thorough\r\n  education and went to Bruges in Flanders to open a commercial house,\r\n  in which he accumulated a fortune. There he met Don Thomas Stoughton\r\n  (afterwards his brother-in-law and Spanish Consul at New York) with\r\n  whom he entered into partnership for the establishment of business in\r\n  New York. Stoughton came here first, arriving in 1783, and Lynch\r\n  followed in 1785, with his fortune in ready money, the largest sum\r\n  brought to the colonies in many years. The firm dissolved in 1795.\r\n  Lynch lived in luxury, occupying a house on Broadway, near the\r\n  Battery, adjoining that of the Spanish Minister. He was a prominent\r\n  figure in assisting in the establishment of the first Catholic Church\r\n  in New York. Tradition has it that the first Catholic congregation\r\n  worshipped in Ann Street, where they were ministered to by Rev.\r\n  Ferdinand Farmer, and we find later a record of another composed of\r\n  Frenchmen and Spaniards, who met in a building in Warren Street, known\r\n  as Vaux Hall, where Rev. Charles Whelan, a Capuchin, was their pastor\r\n  in 1784. St. Peter’s Church was incorporated, succeeding them, June\r\n  10, 1785. Lynch helped from his private purse to meet their needs and\r\n  was one of the trustees and incorporators. He issued an appeal to the\r\n  people of Galway for funds to help in building the church, most of the\r\n  Irish in the fold coming from that County. He was one of the laymen\r\n  authorized by Bishop Carroll to receive subscriptions for the\r\n  establishment of Georgetown Academy (now the University) and was one\r\n  of the signers of the address on behalf of the Catholics of America to\r\n  General George Washington, four being laymen, and Bishop Carroll, the\r\n  fifth. One of his sons was baptized in St. Peter’s Church—Alexander\r\n  Didacus—born April 23, 1788, and for whom His Excellency Didacus de\r\n  Gardoqui, Ambassador of Spain, was a sponsor. He owned two thousand\r\n  acres of land adjoining Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk River, where he\r\n  laid out a village called Lynchville, which afterwards became the city\r\n  of Rome. His county seat was in Westchester County, on the site of the\r\n  present Sacred Heart Academy, at Classon-on-the-Sound, said to have\r\n  been the place where Mass was first said in that county. He died June,\r\n  1825, and was buried in Old Saint Patricks. His son, Dominick, was a\r\n  vocalist, musician, musical critic and general society favorite, whose\r\n  house was the favored resort of the most brilliant people of his time.\r\n  He lived in Greenwich Street, near the Battery, and is thought to have\r\n  been instrumental with Lorenzo da Ponte, the librettist of “Don\r\n  Giovanni” and “Le Nozze di Figaro,” in having brought to New York the\r\n  first Italian Grand Opera troupe under Garcia, when Mme. Malibran\r\n  first won success and laid the foundation of her fame.\r\n\r\n  “Cornelius Heeney, born in Kings County, Ireland, in 1754, was another\r\n  contemporaneous successful merchant. He was a bookkeeper for William\r\n  Backhous, an English Quaker furrier, at 40 Little Dock (now Water)\r\n  Street. John Jacob Astor was a porter and salesman there. When\r\n  Backhous retired from business he turned it over to Astor and Heeney,\r\n  who afterwards dissolved partnership. He was a very wealthy and a very\r\n  charitable man, and his benefactions still continue, through the\r\n  agencies he created, to maintain them. He was one of those who took\r\n  title to new Saint Patricks, the other being Andrew Morris, a\r\n  successful soapmaker, also born in Ireland.\r\n\r\n  “A trio of great men who came to New York after the rising of ’98 were\r\n  Thomas Addis Emmet, Dr. William James McNevin and William Sampson. The\r\n  lives, high professional attainments and success of the first two are\r\n  too well known to require more than a passing reference. They did\r\n  immeasurable good in instilling respect for Irish characteristics and\r\n  admiration for Irish genius. Emmet exercised a potent influence on the\r\n  early political history of the country. His location in this city,\r\n  instead of going to Ohio as he had intended, was due to the advice of\r\n  Governor George Clinton, and was followed by his election as\r\n  Attorney-General of the State within eight years after his reaching\r\n  these shores. The monument to his memory in St. Paul’s churchyard is a\r\n  fitting companion to the memorial to General Montgomery. He\r\n  collaborated with Doctor MacNevin in the production of ‘Pieces of\r\n  Irish History.’ Doctor MacNevin, in the midst of a busy and highly\r\n  lucrative practice, and while acting as a professor in a medical\r\n  college, found time to establish a bureau to obtain places for Irish\r\n  servant girls, and to publish “Directions or Advice to Irishmen\r\n  Arriving in America.” William Sampson, the third of the number, was\r\n  born in Londonderry, Ireland, January 17, 1764. He held a commission\r\n  in the Irish Volunteers, after studying at Dublin University and being\r\n  admitted as a barrister. His sympathy with the patriots and his\r\n  brilliant professional defense of members of the United Irishmen led\r\n  to his arrest after the uprising and his confinement in prison for\r\n  some time. After his release he was re-arrested in Portugal, whither\r\n  he had gone for safety, and was imprisoned on the complaint of the\r\n  British Government. Secretly taken to France, he finally came to New\r\n  York, arriving here July 4, 1806. He then practised stenography, as\r\n  well as his profession of the law, ranking second only to Thomas\r\n  Lloyd, the great reporter of Congress, as a shorthand writer. His\r\n  notes furnished the basis of many volumes of reports. But as a lawyer\r\n  he was especially successful and made a reputation for wit,\r\n  forcefulness, ability and integrity. His daughter married a son of\r\n  Theobold Wolf Tone. When Sampson removed to Washington in 1825, he was\r\n  presented with an address from the citizens of New York, among the\r\n  signers being James Kent and DeWitt Clinton.\r\n\r\n  “The years after the Revolution were fruitful of steady Irish\r\n  arrivals, without much of great note occurring. A careful study of the\r\n  statistics of the first third of the nineteenth century, so far as\r\n  they are available, would doubtless be productive of good results. By\r\n  1833 there were 40,000 Irish-born residents here, it was then\r\n  estimated. This growth had been gradual, but hardly remarked, and\r\n  certainly was not expected. This may well be realized when we know\r\n  that the graveyard in the rear of St. Peter’s Church answered all the\r\n  purposes of burial for the Irish Catholics at the outset, and, until\r\n  old St. Patrick’s site was bought from St. Peter’s Church in 1801, to\r\n  serve for a general Catholic burial ground. It is also worthy of note\r\n  that no move for a larger cemetery was made until 1826, when the site\r\n  of the present Cathedral was bought at a cost of $5,500 for that\r\n  purpose by the parishes of St. Peter’s, St. Patrick’s and St. Mary’s,\r\n  but was abandoned after a few years’ trial as being too far out in the\r\n  country. Of course, a tremendous tide of Irish immigration set in\r\n  after the famine years of 1846, 1847 and 1848. But before that time,\r\n  the period of the pioneers had ceased, and that of construction had\r\n  begun. It ended in New York with the arrival of Bishop John Hughes.\r\n  Under his masterful guidance the position of the Irish here completely\r\n  changed; from the dwarfed and apologetic attitude which many of his\r\n  people had theretofore assumed, they rose to man’s estate. He asserted\r\n  their rights and made them realize the justice of their appeal for\r\n  fair treatment and decent consideration. He courageously defended them\r\n  from unjust attack and took every possible occasion to announce the\r\n  splendor of their history and the value to American citizenship of\r\n  their racial characteristics. Impressing himself on the country, and\r\n  finally winning its confidence, he did more than any other one man has\r\n  ever done to make the Irish people an active, useful, aggressive force\r\n  in the community. He pointed out the way by which they have since\r\n  risen from poverty, misery and persecution—from an isolation worse\r\n  than the Ghetto—to a position so commanding as to seem almost\r\n  miraculous.\r\n\r\n  “There is an impression that Irish immigration is a matter of only\r\n  half a century. From this hasty sketch we have seen that it is a\r\n  matter of gradual growth, the earlier citizens being successful\r\n  merchants, adding to their capital, the later being the industrious,\r\n  if humble, whom necessity had driven abroad from a land which no other\r\n  force could have induced them to leave. Let us hope that the\r\n  inspiration of this Society may lead some one to undertake this\r\n  seemingly hopeless task of wresting from the past the record of those\r\n  who, today unknown, did the work whose fruits we are all enjoying. All\r\n  honor to the early exiles, whose very names are forgotten, and yet\r\n  who, hungry, exhausted from toil, hated and despised, with their very\r\n  heartstrings throbbing with the grief of a sensitive race justly proud\r\n  of its glorious traditions, then scorned and derided,—yet in silence\r\n  and resignation built deep and solid the foundations of the free\r\n  institutions of our country. Without these pioneers the history of\r\n  Irish genius and its accomplishments would have been the less\r\n  glorious, but without them there would have been as well a different\r\n  tale to write of this latest experiment in human freedom. New York\r\n  owes that race a particular debt of gratitude, which gave to the State\r\n  its first Governor, George Clinton, the son of a County Longford\r\n  emigrant, and his kinsman, DeWitt Clinton, the father of the Erie\r\n  Canal; which gave to the city its first mayor, James Duane, an\r\n  Irishman’s son; and which gave to the city fame as the scene of the\r\n  first successful attempt to conquer a way over the waters by the use\r\n  of steam, when the son of a Kilkenny man, Robert Fulton, saw the\r\n  fruition of his dreams as the _Clermont_ sailed the Hudson, August 11,\r\n  1807.\r\n\r\n  “Irishmen and their sons have always been fond of the city which to\r\n  them symbolized the freedom and opportunity of the West. New York has\r\n  been the haven of their hopes. Here their eyes, still dim with tears\r\n  at the thought of Erin, first saw the glimmerings of hope and\r\n  confidence. She has honored and enriched their sons, and they have not\r\n  been ungrateful nor unworthy. From tens of thousands of Irish hearts,\r\n  when the hour for the closing of their earthly pilgrimage was near at\r\n  hand, has gone up an aspiration for her continued prosperity who had\r\n  not forgotten the stranger within her gates. Many an Irishman has\r\n  voiced the wish which Diedrich Knickerbocker was represented as\r\n  uttering as the expression of the Dutchman’s love: ‘Haply this frail\r\n  compound of dust, which while alive may have given birth to nothing\r\n  but unprofitable weeds, may form a humble sod of the valley, whence\r\n  may spring many a sweet wild flower to adorn my beloved island of\r\n  Mannahata!’”\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Dowling’s address met with hearty applause and he received many\r\ncompliments upon the masterly manner with which he handled the difficult\r\nsubject assigned him.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: “Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure\r\nin announcing to you that the next speaker of the evening, who comes\r\nfrom the garden spot of the Middle West and who will respond to the\r\ntoast of ‘The Irish Pioneers of the West and Their Descendants,’ is the\r\nHon. Maurice T. Moloney, Ex-Attorney General of the State of Illinois.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Maurice T. Moloney:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society_:\r\n\r\n\r\n“The subject suggested for me to talk on, ‘The Pioneer Irish of the West\r\nand Their Descendants,’ is one of great latitude, yet it is one that has\r\nnot been historically treated as it deserves. I hope, however, in the\r\nshort time I propose to devote to it, I will not fall into the same line\r\nof thought as did one of Moore’s characters. In the Veiled Prophet of\r\nKorassan, the great chamberlain, Fadladeen, when about to criticise the\r\nyoung poet’s story, said: ‘In order to convey with clearness my opinion\r\nof the story this young man has related, it is necessary to take a\r\nreview of all the stories that have ever’—and when at this point he was\r\ninterrupted by the good Princess, he became mortified at not being\r\nallowed to show how much he knew about everything but the subject\r\nimmediately before him. Bearing in mind, then, Fadladeen’s misadventure,\r\nstill, we should not be unmindful of our migration hither, and some of\r\nthe causes that led to it.\r\n\r\n“The successive misfortunes that have overtaken that unfortunate people\r\never since Nicholas Brekespear gave a quit-claim deed of them to Henry\r\nII constitute even in the blood-stained pages of English history some of\r\nthe greatest tragedies of ancient or modern times, and should lead some\r\nat least of those good people who believe in future rewards and\r\npunishments to consign that same Brekespear to a warm abode.\r\n\r\n“It is needless, no doubt, to tell Irishmen or their descendants, or\r\nthose interested in Irish history, of the many migrations from that\r\ncountry. During the latter part of the seventeenth and the first part of\r\nthe eighteenth centuries, hundreds of thousands of them filled the\r\ncontinental armies and many other thousands, young and old, were\r\nbanished to the West Indies and the colonies, as helots, under the\r\ndirection of that brutal, canting knave, Cromwell, and others. I will\r\ncall your attention, however, for a few moments only, to some of the\r\nmigrations of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n“I find on an examination of the Report of the Devon Commission to\r\nParliament in 1845, that in the decade from 1831 to 1841, 430,963\r\nemigrants left Ireland. I further find from an examination of Irish\r\nImmigration Statistics, that in the following decade from 1841 to 1851,\r\n1,508,454 left the Island, and from 1851 to 1907, 4,130,015 persons\r\nemigrated from that unfortunate country, making a total leaving the\r\nIsland in seventy odd years of 6,069,432. The present population of that\r\ncountry is about four and a half millions—a little less. What a terrible\r\nindictment of England and her seven centuries of oppression! No language\r\nthat I am capable of using could more eloquently depict her continued\r\ninfamies than that contained in these statistics.\r\n\r\n“Of course, all of these people did not come to this country. Some went\r\nto other countries, especially to the Antipodes, but the great bulk of\r\nthem came to the Great Republic, where many thousands of their kith and\r\nkin had preceded them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. HUGH McCAFFREY.\r\n\r\n  Philadelphia, President McCaffrey File Co.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Pennsylvania.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“It would be interesting as well as instructive to follow up and trace\r\nthe careers and fortunes of those Irish exiles and their descendants who\r\nthronged the shores and trod the soil of the Republic. It has never been\r\ndone so far as I know. McGee, in the fifties, and Maguire, in the\r\nsixties, each wrote a small volume on the subject, and they are of some\r\nvalue to the student of history. Of this great swarm, how many crossed\r\nthe Alleghanies and steered their course for the West? It is difficult\r\nto say. We have not even approximately correct data on the subject.\r\n\r\n“I think, however, I am safe in saying that half of those who came to\r\nthis country within the last named period did so. In the Middle West, in\r\nthe great states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Iowa,—indeed,\r\nin all the great western states—there is not a county, city or village\r\nwhere they or their descendants are not to be found in goodly numbers.\r\nThank Heaven! race suicide has not as yet overtaken them.\r\n\r\n“Maguire, in his work written in the sixties, advised his countrymen to\r\nsettle in the West, especially in the state of California. His advice,\r\nno doubt, carried great weight and influenced many of them in seeking\r\nWestern homes.\r\n\r\n“I remember, as a boy in Ireland, reading his lectures on the subject,\r\nand subsequently, after graduating at the University of Virginia, I\r\ndetermined to go to California, but straightened conditions intervening,\r\nI was compelled to remain in Illinois. Hence, I am fairly familiar with\r\nthe people of that great State, and I think the history of the Irish\r\nthere would be fairly typical of them in other Western States.\r\n\r\n“And now I think I hear you ask—what of them? What have they done, and\r\nwhat are they doing, in what many of you Eastern gentlemen are pleased\r\nto call the ‘wild and woolly West.’ To be frank, taking into\r\nconsideration their old home conditions, and the circumstances attending\r\ntheir coming, they are doing and have done fairly well. They were mostly\r\nof the tenant farming class and day laborers. Manufacturing in Ireland\r\nlong prior to this time ceased to be a factor, having been either\r\nabolished, or prevented by successive English Parliaments. They were of\r\nnecessity very poor, they and their forebears for centuries having been\r\nplundered by heartless tyrants. No people prefer indigence and want to\r\nprosperity. It was artificially enforced poverty that compelled them to\r\nemigrate.\r\n\r\n“On arriving in the West, therefore, they were for the most part forced\r\nto occupy the hard lot of the unskilled laborer, and I may say without\r\nfear of contradiction, what they undertook to do they did well. They dug\r\nour great canals, built our great lines of railroads, erected our\r\ntelegraph lines from Chicago to San Francisco and helped to operate\r\nthem. They engaged in farming and stock raising and have been successful\r\nin both. There is not a public utility in the West whose physical\r\nstructure at least does not owe its existence in the main to Irish\r\nhands; and let it not be forgotten, too, that gradually, as these men\r\nwere able to put by a little of their hard earnings, they tried to\r\nelevate themselves and their children in the various walks of life. They\r\ndid not rest content with their lot. They knew their natural\r\ncapabilities and tried to and did improve them. Many of them, too, were\r\nmen of initiative. Of course, the rich and the learned, as a rule, were\r\nnot among them. People of that kind do not have to leave their country\r\nto seek homes in other climes. Labor, however, manual or otherwise, is\r\nno disgrace; rather is it a badge of respectability.\r\n\r\n             “‘Honor and shame from no condition rise,\r\n             Act well your part, there all the honor lies.’\r\n\r\n“Of course many of them,—alas, too many,—fell by the way.\r\n\r\n“As to the work done by our people in the West, take as an illustration\r\nthe Illinois & Michigan Canal, which begins at Chicago on the southern\r\nbend of Lake Michigan and enters the Illinois River at La Salle, a\r\ndistance of a hundred miles. From its inception to its close the work\r\nwas mainly done by Irish emigrants. It has been to Illinois and the West\r\na great benefit. Not only was this great work done by the labor of\r\nIrishmen, but its successful accomplishment in a financial way was due\r\nto the exertions of one of them. In 1842 work on the canal had to be\r\nabandoned because of the financial condition of the State Treasury. At\r\nthat time the counties of La Salle, Grundy and De Kalb constituted a\r\nSenatorial District, and a young Irishman twenty-six years of age, one\r\nMichael Ryan, was elected State Senator from there. He was, even at that\r\nearly age, easily the peer of any man in the West. So thoroughly did he\r\nmaster the subject both as to the necessities of the canal and its\r\nresources that he introduced and carried through the State Legislature,\r\nnot without opposition, however, a bill enabling the State to borrow one\r\nmillion, six hundred thousand dollars, to complete the work. The\r\nGovernor at the time, recognizing his great ability, appointed him and a\r\nMr. Oakley agents for the State to proceed to London and borrow that\r\nsum—no small amount for those days. They succeeded in doing so. It is\r\nsaid of him (and there are those still living in my home town who knew\r\nhim well and speak of him with affection) that he was a brilliant man,\r\nkind and courteous, an honest man. To him did the State of Illinois\r\nmainly owe its success in raising the means to complete that great\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n“Another leading Irishman in Illinois in those days was one William\r\nReddick, a State Senator for many years, a leading temperance advocate,\r\nand a man of whom any people might be proud. He left a large fortune to\r\nthe city of Ottawa for library purposes. Many of the younger emigrants\r\nlearned trades and became skilled workmen. Many of them engaged in the\r\nmercantile business, at the beginning in a small way, but eventually\r\nbecame prosperous. So, too, did they engage in manufacturing. Many of\r\nthem owned coal mines and of course many, very many, were miners. The\r\nKilgubbin coal shaft, as it was called, a valuable property in the\r\ncounty I reside in, was owned and operated by one Nicholas Duncan, a\r\nCork man.\r\n\r\n“Of course, of the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen who have lived and\r\nstill live with their descendants in the great city of Chicago, it is\r\nnot possible for me to give more than a passing glance, and say that\r\nthey are among the leading business men, lawyers, doctors and financiers\r\nof that great metropolis. Volumes might be written about them.\r\n\r\n“There were not many professional men among those early emigrants. There\r\nwas one, however, who deserves special mention. His name was E. G. Ryan.\r\nHe was born in Dublin and came to Illinois in the thirties. He practised\r\nlaw in that State and was recognized at once as being among the leaders\r\nof the bar. He afterwards moved to Wisconsin and there became Chief\r\nJustice of the Court of Last Resort of that State. He was a profound\r\nlawyer, a regular encyclopædia of learning. He was probably the greatest\r\njurist of the West, and there are those who say that he would bear\r\nfavorable comparison with the great John Marshall. He has been dead for\r\nsome few years.\r\n\r\n“Very many of the descendants of those pioneers entered the different\r\nprofessions. In law and medicine they easily hold their own in the West.\r\nThe ablest, all-around lawyer I ever met was Thomas A. Moran of Chicago,\r\nfor a time Judge of the Circuit and Appellate Courts in that State. He,\r\ntoo, has passed out into the Great Beyond.\r\n\r\n“Another who made history might also be mentioned.\r\n\r\n“In early days, as we say out West, one John H. Mulkey, then about\r\ntwenty years old, came to the southern part of the State of Illinois\r\nfrom the State of Tennessee, as an itinerant Methodist preacher. Being a\r\nman of good sense, he soon abandoned the ministry and took up the study\r\nand afterwards the practice of the law. He met with great success. He\r\nhad a splendid career. He was elected to the Supreme Court and served as\r\nan honored member of that body for a number of years. In 1896, while I\r\nrepresented the State, he came to my office (he was then practising law)\r\nand sought a continuance of a case in the Supreme Court. I readily\r\nconsented, and he dictated to my stenographer the agreement for a\r\ncontinuance. While he was doing so it occurred to me that he had a very\r\npeculiar name indeed, and when he got through I said rather abruptly, I\r\nconfess: ‘Judge, where in the world did you get that name? I can’t think\r\nto what nation your ancestors could have belonged.’ He looked at me,\r\nlaughed, and said, ‘I am as Irish as you are, but an ancestor changed\r\nthe good old Irish name of Mulcahey to Mulkey, and’ he added, ‘he didn’t\r\nimprove it.’\r\n\r\n“Mulkey had a high sense of honor. He had a solicitous regard for the\r\nreputation of his profession. He was a scholarly man, a conscientious\r\njurist. He detested a dishonest man and especially a dishonest lawyer.\r\nApropos of this, it may not be uninteresting if I relate a few of the\r\ncircumstances attending a dissenting opinion which he wrote while on the\r\nBench. It seems that two men, one named Hughes and the other Appleton,\r\nwere neighbors and both practised law in Chicago. Hughes conveyed the\r\ntitle to a piece of property worth eight to ten thousand dollars to\r\nAppleton, without consideration. The latter was merely a trustee.\r\nAppleton disposed of the property and converted the proceeds to his own\r\nuse. The Attorney-General of Illinois filed an information in the\r\nSupreme Court setting up these facts and asking for the disbarment of\r\nAppleton. On a final hearing that Court denied the application on the\r\nground that the relation of attorney and client did not exist between\r\nthem. Mulkey not being able to agree with the majority of the Court\r\nwrote a unique dissenting opinion, in which among other things, he said:\r\n‘This defense so forcibly reminds me of the old story of the profane\r\nbishop who had the good fortune to be a duke also, I cannot refrain from\r\ntelling it. An acquaintance who happened to overhear him using profane\r\nlanguage asked him how it was that he, being a bishop, could be guilty\r\nof swearing. “Ah, my friend,” replied his reverence, “I swear as a duke\r\nand not as a bishop.” “But,” retorted the other, “when the devil comes\r\nto get the duke, what will become of the bishop?” So, in this case, when\r\nhis Satanic Majesty calls for Appleton the trustee, I should like to\r\nknow what will become of Appleton the attorney.’ I might add that some\r\nyears after his admission to the bar, he became a Catholic, and died in\r\nthat faith.\r\n\r\n“I wonder how many Irish names have been mutilated like that of the good\r\njudge. I fear too many.\r\n\r\n“In the management of railroads, our people have excelled in the West.\r\nThe children of two Irishmen, brothers, named Egan, born within about\r\nthirty miles of where I reside, have been important, if not chief\r\nfactors in the management of many railroads. They have been connected\r\nwith the Grand Trunk, the Illinois Central and other roads. I remember\r\nwell, in 1894, when the great strike, almost an incipient insurrection,\r\noccurred in Chicago, that one of these Egans was selected by the\r\nofficers and directors of all the railroads centering in that great\r\ncity, to take entire control of their properties and manage them during\r\nthe strike. This was quite a tribute to the son of a poor Irishman.\r\nAnother, still comparatively young, might be mentioned. He was born in\r\nthe town I live in. I remember him as a poor boy, a brakeman on a branch\r\nline running through our city. His name is Patrick Houlihan. A brochure\r\nhas been written on his career and is entitled, I believe, ‘From Water\r\nCarrier to General Manager.’ He has on different lines, successively\r\noccupied the positions between that of water boy and superintendent, and\r\nis now general manager of the Toledo, St. Louis & Western and the\r\nChicago & Alton Railroad Companies, with headquarters at Chicago. He is\r\nbright and brainy, with years of usefulness before him. He is a credit\r\nto our race.\r\n\r\n“In literature, we have fairly well held our own. I do not mean to say\r\nthat we have written as many novels, good bad and indifferent, as\r\nothers, but the Rileys, the Finnertys, the Sullivans, the Clearys and\r\nDunns, and men and women of such names have left their impress upon our\r\nliterature. Many of you no doubt have met and all must have with\r\npleasure, read that Western product, the discoverer of Mr. Dooley and\r\nArchie Avenue road, that droll, inimitable writer of ‘dialect’ a\r\nphilosopher in his way—Finley Peter Dunn, who like other good men, has\r\nrecently gone wrong, in having against the advice of Greeley and all the\r\nsages of the republic, migrated backwards as it were until now Gotham\r\nclaims him for her own.\r\n\r\n“And now a few words as to the tillers of the soil.\r\n\r\n“Many of those emigrants settled upon the lands of the West, though\r\nunder disadvantageous circumstances. There are many townships in my\r\ncounty, and in adjoining counties, and indeed scattered all over the\r\nWest, that have been settled almost exclusively by them. Those lands are\r\nnow worth on an average $150 per acre. Measurably, this is true of the\r\nMiddle West. It is literally true of Illinois.\r\n\r\n“Nebraska settlement, as it was called, embracing all that territory\r\nfrom Kansas to Canada, and from the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, was\r\nthrown open for settlement in 1854. A large number of Irish were among\r\nthe early settlers. In 1857 a convention was held in Buffalo to perfect\r\nplans for establishing Irish colonies in the West. Delegates assembled\r\nfrom all over the country. Three large colonies started as a result of\r\nthis convention—one led by Father Trecy founded St. Patrick’s Colony in\r\nNebraska, now Jackson. Another, under Father Powers, of Pennsylvania,\r\nwent to Missouri, and a third went to Minnesota. In the latter state,\r\nadditional Irish colonies have been established. They endured almost\r\nuntold trials and hardships in a new and wild country. Father Trecy’s\r\ncolony celebrated its Golden Jubilee in July, 1907, a dozen of the\r\noriginal settlers being present. Greeley County, Nebraska, is\r\npractically an Irish county, being settled almost exclusively by\r\nIrishmen, especially is this true of the towns of Greeley Center,\r\nO’Connor, Spalding and O’Neill.\r\n\r\n“Instances of this kind might be indefinitely extended. Notwithstanding\r\nthis fact, we have been criticised for not going in larger numbers upon\r\nthe broad prairies and fertile lands of the West. I admit the farmer’s\r\nlife is the ideal one, but it took something more than hands and limbs\r\nand brains, too, to go upon a farm. It required money even when land was\r\ncheapest. How could a family in Ireland, turned out on the roadside by\r\nthe crowbar brigade, who with the greatest difficulty could scrape\r\nenough together to pay their passage to America, be expected upon their\r\narrival to purchase land and agricultural implements, to go farming\r\nwith? It was hardly within the possibilities. Even if the father came\r\nalone, as he often did, he was compelled to go to work on the first\r\nopportunity to provide for his immediate wants and save something to\r\nsend to the half-starving family at home or pay the passage to America.\r\nAnd, if it was a son or daughter who managed to come, they were ever\r\nstriving to send for one more of the family or likely enough, to send\r\nthe greater part of their hard earnings to pay the exorbitant rent of\r\nthe heartless landlord. I know whereof I speak. I am a living witness of\r\nthose happenings. As a boy, I was compelled to leave the land of my\r\nbirth, and I can say without affectation, that I never experienced more\r\nreal joy than I did when making my first remittance to Ireland. Though I\r\nknew the ultimate destination of most of it was the landlord’s pocket,\r\nstill I think I had more pleasure in sending than he had in receiving\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                “‘More true joy Marcellus exiled feels,\r\n                Than Caesar with a Senate at his heels.’\r\n\r\n“Of the gold seekers of ’49 who rushed to the coast, many of them were\r\nIrish. Many settled down in different parts of that slope and as you\r\nknow, many of them became millionaires. I need only mention the names of\r\nFlood, O’Brien, Mackey, Phelan and others, to conjure up visions of\r\nwealth. But, _cui bono_. The richest people are not always the most\r\ninteresting even when the wealth is honestly acquired, and here I may\r\nremark (though a little foreign to the subject) if the wealth of many of\r\nour multi-millionaires were tomorrow turned into the National Treasury,\r\nit would not begin to compensate for the moral shame and degradation\r\ntheir practices have brought on the republic. Kerosene colleges will\r\nnever make straight, or light, Heaven’s pathway.\r\n\r\n“When the greatest crime of the nineteenth century was about to be\r\nperpetrated in the dismemberment of this Union the Irish people of the\r\nWest, in goodly numbers, rushed to its defense and sealed with their\r\nblood, their love of the republic. You all, no doubt, have heard of a\r\nSheridan, a Shields, a Corcoran, a Lawler, and others of the West, who\r\ndied that the Union might live. Ingratitude has never been the failing\r\nof Irishmen. Gratitude for favors, even small ones, adherence to\r\nprinciple, through good and evil times, have ever been characteristic of\r\nthe race. Prior to that war, the hereditary enemy of our people despised\r\nAmerica. Since its termination, they have hated, but fear it. You know\r\nGladstone, when Jefferson Davis was inaugurated President, exclaimed\r\nthat a new nation had been born. We may in the future as we sometimes\r\nhave in the past, send de-natured Americans to London, but no occasional\r\nslobbering over the great republic by perfidious Albion can disguise\r\nthat hatred. Napoleon said, scratch a Russian and you will find a\r\nTartar, scratch an Englishman or an Irishman of the garrison, and almost\r\ninvariably you will find a hater of America.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion, let me say, and I say it with some pride, but in no\r\nboastful spirit, that the Irish people in the West, though having to\r\nstruggle from the lowest rung of the ladder, are physically,\r\nintellectually, morally, and I might add, financially, the peers of\r\ntheir neighbors. They are not a dying race. I wish some competent hand\r\nwould write their history.”\r\n\r\nMr. Moloney’s address was greeted with much applause and cheering, and\r\nat this point Senator Carter of Montana arrived in the hall and was\r\nescorted to his place at the head table by the Secretary-General and Mr.\r\nMoseley.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: “We are honored this evening by the presence\r\nof one of our most earnest members, whose distinguished services to his\r\ncountry in the United States Senate and earnest and unselfish devotion\r\nto the work of our Society endears him to all. It is with pleasure I\r\nintroduce Hon. Thomas H. Carter, United States Senator from Montana.”\r\n\r\nSENATOR CARTER: “_Mr. Toastmaster, Fellow Members of the Society, Ladies\r\nand Gentlemen_: I am billed upon this program to deliver a ‘Capital\r\nWelcome.’ I at once disclaim ability to do that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RIGHT REVEREND M. C. LENIHAN.\r\n\r\n  Bishop of Great Falls, Montana.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Montana.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“‘Capital Welcome’ seems to imply a good or excellent welcome, and that\r\naccomplishment is beyond me,—but I most cheerfully extend to you a\r\ncordial welcome to this, the Capital City of our common country, and I\r\nsincerely hope that as you each depart from here, you will not feel\r\nimpelled to write upon the register a sentiment similar to that written\r\nby one of our distinguished fellow-countrymen upon leaving a\r\nwatering-place in England. Each of the party was called upon to write on\r\nthe register of the hostelry a sentiment, and one bright member wrote\r\nthese words: ‘I came here for change and rest; the porter has the\r\nchange, the landlord the rest.’\r\n\r\n“The man who wrote that was not the same man whom Brother Lee desires me\r\nto tell about, who described the kind of a man that Casey was. The man\r\nat the head of the table said ‘What kind of a man is Casey?’ ‘Well,’\r\nsays Murphy, ‘I’ll tell you what kind of a man Casey is. I went over to\r\nCasey’s house. Says he to me, “Murphy, will you have a drink?” I says,\r\n“Of course I will, Mr. Casey.” He says, “Murphy, shall I pour or will\r\nyou pour?” “Pour yourself,” says I, “Mr. Casey.” He says, “All right,\r\ntell me when to stop.” He poured out a drop or two, and out of\r\npoliteness I said “Stop, Casey,” and Casey stopped. That’s the kind of a\r\nman Casey is.’\r\n\r\n“This Society needs no welcome to the Capitol City of this nation.\r\nWheresoever you may turn in viewing our parks or avenues or historic\r\nhalls, you will see in bronze and in marble mute evidences of the\r\nappreciation expressed by a grateful people of the achievements and\r\ncontributions of the Irish and the Irish Americans, in building up and\r\nmaintaining this great Republic.\r\n\r\n“In LaFayette Square, immediately in front of the White House, is a\r\nstatue of Andrew Jackson, a renowned President of the United States who\r\nwas the son of an Irishman. Out in the northwest part of the city, but a\r\nfew days ago, we assembled to unveil an equestrian statue to a man whom\r\nGeneral Grant pronounced the greatest soldier of any time, the son of an\r\nIrishman, Philip Sheridan. Come down but a little farther and you will\r\nfind a square adorned with trees and flowers, and in its center a\r\nbeautiful statue to Admiral Farragut, of Irish blood on his mother’s\r\nside. Over in Iowa circle, to the northeast of this point, is the statue\r\nof General John A. Logan, the son of an Irishman. Pennsylvania Avenue\r\nhas been gazed upon for years and years by the sightless eyes of a\r\nbronze statue of General John A. Rawlins, the confidential friend of the\r\npeerless victor of Appomattox. General Rawlins was of Irish extraction.\r\n\r\n“Across Pennsylvania Avenue from this hotel is a great building in which\r\nthrobs the heart of the mighty postal system of the country for which we\r\nwill expend two hundred and thirty millions of dollars during this\r\nfiscal year. The first Postmaster-General admitted to the Cabinet of a\r\nPresident was John Barry, the son of an Irishman. And that reminds me of\r\nthe way Cabinet officers are selected. It is generally supposed that the\r\nPresident’s Cabinet is organized in conformity with law, but such is not\r\nthe fact. One day Postmaster Barry received a note reading thus:\r\n‘Tomorrow and hereafter you will attend Cabinet meetings.’ Signed\r\n‘Andrew Jackson.’ It was that which established the custom of calling in\r\nthe Postmaster-General as one of the counselors of the President of the\r\nUnited States, and that custom has been maintained to this day.\r\n\r\n“Go through the hall of statuary in our Capitol, and there you will find\r\nin marble men of proud fame in this country’s history—General Louis\r\nCass, Henry Wilson, General Shields and others, making a long roll of\r\nmen of Irish birth or lineage which I will not undertake to call here\r\ntonight.\r\n\r\n“Just across the Potomac River, when the life of the nation was\r\nassailed, Colonel Corcoran of New York was the first to move forward\r\nwith the Stars and Stripes. When the Capitol was menaced from the\r\nsouthwest, ‘Phil’ Sheridan was there with his cavalry to meet the enemy.\r\nWhen the fate of the nation was trembling in the balance upon the\r\nhistoric field of Gettysburg, the Union Army was directed by the\r\nmasterful mind of General Meade of Irish blood.\r\n\r\n“I will not go back to the early days of the country’s history. It is\r\nsufficient to say that in a parliamentary inquiry as to the conduct of\r\nthe war against the colonies by a committee of the House of Commons of\r\nwhich Edmund Burke was a member, this interesting fact was brought\r\nforth. In the cross-examination of Major General Robertson, Mr. Burke\r\nasked the question, ‘Of what elements is the Continental Army composed?’\r\nRobertson said, ‘On authority of General Lee, I inform you that more\r\nthan half the Continental Army is made up of Irishmen.’\r\n\r\n“The illustrious names that adorn our country’s history are entitled to\r\nimperishable renown because of great deeds well done in that\r\nRevolutionary struggle. Among them is a list of men of Irish birth,\r\nbeginning with the man who struck the first blow, General Sullivan, and\r\ncontinuing along the line to the close of the war. And when I think of\r\nthe contributions made, the common sufferings endured, and the\r\nsacrifices made without limit as to time or circumstance, I say the\r\nIrish and their descendants are entitled to the privilege of claiming\r\nwith proud confidence that this is their own country.\r\n\r\n“The history of Ireland is confined to an island with its curious, sad\r\nand heroic circumstances, but the history of the Irish people is limited\r\nonly by the inhabitable portions of the globe.\r\n\r\n“I have been, as you have been, chagrined to perceive the disposition to\r\nrob these people of the credit which is truly and justly their due. Who\r\ncan read of Burke and Goldsmith and Johnson and Sheridan and Tyndale as\r\nEnglish authors without a feeling that some one has been guilty of grand\r\nlarceny and misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n“Who can read the page of history which places Arthur Wellesley as an\r\nEnglishman without feeling that the hero of Waterloo has been misplaced?\r\nWhy deny to this island, bereft of the right to control its own destiny,\r\nthe privilege of claiming the honor and distinction properly due to the\r\nachievements of its distinguished sons?\r\n\r\n“It is desirable that a society like unto this should be established in\r\nEngland to change the trend which leads to error and confusion. What we\r\nundertake here should be undertaken there. I am glad that this Society\r\nhas taken up the work of developing the history of the Irish and their\r\ndescendants in the United States, for it is a great and glorious feature\r\nin American history. While proud of the past, while proud of the\r\nachievements of those whose deeds we record, it is important, I think,\r\nthat we should at the same time bear in mind the duty we owe to the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n“I would that the Americans of Irish birth and descent in this country\r\ncould unite their energies and make of this force in American life a\r\nleading force for higher conceptions of civic duty, a force looking to\r\nbetter living, a force working for a civilization such as has not been\r\ndreamed of by those who have struggled in the past. This we may do while\r\nrecording that which has gone by with fidelity and truth. Let us be true\r\nto ourselves by working for such conditions as will make our race more\r\ndistinguished henceforth in its achievements than it has been in the\r\nsplendid work of the past.”\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: The next and last toast of the evening is\r\n“Advantages of Historical Research to Irish Americans.” The response\r\nwill be made by a noble American of Irish ancestry, who comes from the\r\ngranary belt of the great Northwest, the land of Sitting Bull and the\r\nbrave Sioux, where the ardent flames of patriotism burn with the\r\nintensity of true Americanism.\r\n\r\n                   What means this gathering here tonight,\r\n                     What Spirit moves along\r\n                   This crowded hall and touching light\r\n                     Each heart among the throng\r\n                   Awakes as tho’ a trumpet blast\r\n                     Had sounded in their ears\r\n                   The recollection of the past,\r\n                   The memories of the years.\r\n   Oh, ’tis the spirit of the West, the spirit of the Celt,\r\n   The breed that spurned the alien breast and every wrong has felt,\r\n   And still tho’ far from fatherland, we never can forget\r\n   To tell ourselves with heart and hand,\r\n                   We’re Irish yet,\r\n                       We’re Irish yet.\r\n\r\nI take great pleasure in introducing to you, ladies and gentlemen, Hon.\r\nRobert J. Gamble, United States Senator from South Dakota.\r\n\r\nSENATOR GAMBLE: _Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen_: I accept the\r\nkindly and humorous felicitations of your President. I admit I hail from\r\nSouth Dakota, once the land of the Sioux, of Red Cloud and Sitting Bull.\r\nIn these later years, however, it has been transformed with marvelous\r\nrapidity into an empire of wealth, of productiveness, of social and\r\ncivic development, and with ideals at least equal to those of any in the\r\nSisterhood of States. In her wonderful prosperity she has been as\r\njealous of the one as the other. In her Constitution and in her laws she\r\nhas sought to make liberty secure, to foster and provide for the\r\neducation of her children, to encourage the highest ideals of\r\ncitizenship, to inspire a patriotism worthy of the opportunities of her\r\npeople. Along all of these lines we feel South Dakota has met with a\r\nhigh degree of success. She stands almost the lowest in the percentage\r\nof illiteracy of her population. Pauperism is scarcely observable.\r\nWealth and comfort are very generally diffused amongst her people. Her\r\nschools and colleges are equal to the necessities of the state. The door\r\nof opportunity is open to all. For more than a decade she has produced\r\neach year more wealth per capita than any other state in the Union.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. President, at this late hour I give you assurance of brevity in what\r\nI have to say. I appreciate very much the compliment of your invitation,\r\nand indeed it is a great pleasure to be present on this occasion and to\r\nrespond to the toast to which I have been assigned.\r\n\r\nThe history of Ireland in itself is a sad one, but the high purpose and\r\ninvincible courage of her manhood and her womanhood, their high ideals\r\nand devotion to liberty and to national integrity, have been fraught\r\nwith blessings and have brought encouragement to human liberty the world\r\nover. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWithin the circumscribed limits of their own nationality success rarely\r\ncrowned the patriotic efforts and heroic struggle for liberty of the\r\nIrish people. Their field of activity, however, has not been confined to\r\nthe land of their birth, and has been limited only wherever humanity has\r\nasserted itself against tyranny and in a struggle for better conditions\r\nand for orderly liberty.\r\n\r\nAmerica owes a wonderful debt of gratitude to the Irish race. We must\r\nrecognize that preceding American independence there was a strong\r\nelement of our population composed of Irish Americans.\r\n\r\nAmong the strongest advocates for American independence were Irishmen,\r\nor the descendants of Irishmen. Hancock and Rutledge and the Carrolls\r\nand their co-workers contributed vastly to the development of a National\r\nspirit. The work of these strong, patriotic and efficient men had much\r\nto do with drawing the colonies together in united effort and cementing\r\ntheir interests in the common cause. Their voices had long been raised\r\nin protest against the Mother Country before the musketry was heard at\r\nLexington. These brave and courageous men, and their associates, with\r\ntheir large vision and patriotic purpose, pointed out the way and\r\ncrystalized the sentiment for national independence. The work they\r\nperformed for the cause of national independence, though different in\r\ncharacter, was as important in its way as that of the actual\r\nparticipants in the field, of the general or the soldier.\r\n\r\nAs indicative of the high character of the Irish race, and of their\r\nactivities and large influence in the formative period of our National\r\nhistory it is gratifying and with a sense of pride in this presence to\r\nstate that in the First Continental Congress, with a membership of\r\nfifty-four, eleven were Irish or of Irish descent. The same race has\r\nalso to its credit three presidents of the Republic whose ancestors came\r\nfrom the Emerald Isle. And Roosevelt, an honored member of this Society,\r\nnot only our President, but the most distinguished citizen of the world,\r\ntakes pride in the fact that he can trace his lineage to this\r\nindomitable people. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOf the membership of the Continental Congress that put forth the\r\nimmortal Declaration of Independence, twenty per cent was Irish or of\r\nIrish descent. The hand of Thompson that first transcribed it upon\r\nparchment was Irish; the first signature that was placed to it as\r\nPresident was that of John Hancock, an Irishman-American; and when those\r\nimmortal words were read for the first time to the assembled multitude\r\nfrom the balcony of Continental Hall at Philadelphia, it was by the\r\nvoice of an Irishman, Mr. Nixon; and when it was placed in type for the\r\nfirst time it was by one Dunlap, an Irish printer.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1777, when Congress appointed eighteen\r\nbrigadier-generals, six of those who were thus commissioned were Irish\r\nby birth or descent. Among the number were the dashing and brilliant Mad\r\nAnthony Wayne and the strong and courageous Clinton. I need only speak\r\nof the accomplished Montgomery, whose valor has been justly praised and\r\nwho died a hero’s death upon the plains of Quebec, or of Sullivan, the\r\nsplendid leader and the associate of Washington, upon whom the latter\r\nleaned more than upon any other, and for whose great service the thanks\r\nof Congress were extended; of Knox and Stark and many others who were\r\nideal and successful leaders in the great Revolutionary struggle. It has\r\nbeen asserted, but undoubtedly with very much exaggeration, that half of\r\nthe Continental Army were Irish or of Irish descent. Even if this be not\r\ntrue it must be admitted that the race had a large representation in the\r\nArmy, and it speaks well for their patriotism and devotion to the cause\r\nof American Independence.\r\n\r\nThe Irish race I think can take a just pride in the accomplishments of\r\nits people, not only as statesmen and leaders in contributing vastly\r\ntowards shaping the policies of the colonies in the formative period of\r\nour history with a view to the ultimate forming of the Federal Union,\r\nand also in leadership and on men in the field of battle.\r\n\r\nBut it was not alone upon the land that the heroism of the race asserted\r\nitself in the cause for National Independence. If not the first, at\r\nleast among the first naval fights of the Revolution was the capture of\r\nthe British ship _Margaretta_ at Machias Bay on the Coast of Maine on\r\nMay 11, 1775. The Americans were commanded by Captain O’Brien, the son\r\nof an Irish immigrant. This victory has frequently been called “The\r\nLexington of the Seas.”\r\n\r\nIt was John Barry, a native of Ireland, who received one of the first\r\nnaval commissions from Congress. Through his ability and leadership and\r\nhis many well earned victories he brought the highest credit to America\r\nupon the seas. Commodore Barry today is justly called “The Father of the\r\nAmerican Navy.” He was the great naval commander of the Revolution. I\r\nmight name many other distinguished officers of this nationality who\r\nrendered conspicuous service to their country and added to the fame of\r\nthe Navy in the war of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIrish womanhood also gave evidence of its devotion and heroism in the\r\nperson of Mollie Pitcher, who took the place at the cannon of her fallen\r\nhusband and is accorded a hero’s place in the battle of Monmouth.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of those of Irish blood did not exhaust itself in the cause\r\nof the Revolution alone. In the War of 1812 it contributed some of its\r\nmost conspicuous figures. It was Jackson at New Orleans, Commodore\r\nStewart on the sea with his _Constitution_, McDonough on Lake Champlain\r\nand Perry on Lake Erie that won imperishable glory for the American Army\r\nand Navy in that War.\r\n\r\nIn the war with Mexico the men of this race had representatives in the\r\npersons of Generals Kearney and Shields. The latter also received the\r\nexceptional distinction of having been elected to a seat in the United\r\nStates Senate on three different occasions in separate elections from\r\nthree different states.\r\n\r\nIn the recent war, among the most illustrious names is that of General\r\nSheridan, the son of an Irishman, and although less conspicuous others\r\nof the same blood rendered high service to their country, and amongst\r\nthem are such honored names as Meade, Logan, Meagher, Mulligan, Shields\r\nand Corcoran.\r\n\r\nIt is no idle boast to assert that the names of the men of Irish blood\r\nadorn the most conspicuous pages of the history of the Republic. They\r\naided as wise, safe and patriotic counsellors in laying the foundations\r\nof our institutions. They fought with heroism and devotion in the\r\nstruggle for independence, both upon the land and upon the sea. In every\r\ntrial and test that has come to us in our history they have made willing\r\nand great sacrifice to defend the honor of their country and to\r\nperpetuate and sustain her institutions.\r\n\r\nIreland has contributed much to the Republic. In a high degree the race\r\nhas been unselfish. The devotion of the race has not alone been confined\r\nto the United States. It has been frequently and truthfully said though\r\nnot always gratefully and freely admitted that she gave a Wellington to\r\nEngland and in these later years she has also contributed a Wolsey, a\r\nRoberts and a Kitchener. To France she gave McMahon, and to Spain an\r\nO’Donnell.\r\n\r\nMany of her brave and devoted men followed Bolivar in South America and\r\naided materially in laying the foundations of the Republic in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nOn every field of human endeavor the Irish name has a conspicuous place.\r\nIn statesmanship she has given Burke, who enriched our language with his\r\noratory. She supplied also Phillips, Grattan and O’Connell.\r\n\r\nIn literature she has been most generous in giving to the world\r\nGoldsmith, Moore, Collins, Knowles, Sheridan and a host of others. In\r\nthe sciences she has contributed Lardner, Rowe, Proctor, Tyndall,\r\nFaraday and our own Fulton.\r\n\r\nNor has she been lacking in the field of Art, but America adopted as her\r\nown the gifted St. Gaudens. In philosophy and theology she has many\r\ndistinguished names.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in conclusion I would state I believe “The advantages of\r\nHistorical research to Irish Americans” will give them a more just\r\nappreciation of the Irish character, of the services they have rendered\r\nin founding, sustaining and perpetuating our institutions and in\r\nmaintaining the highest ideals of our common country.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: One final word. The Secretary-General wishes\r\nto say something, and I know it will interest you all.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY-GENERAL LEE: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the thanks of the\r\nAmerican Irish Historical Society be tendered the speakers of the\r\nevening for their excellent services in our behalf, and that the entire\r\naddress of each be printed in the Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Motion carried by unanimous vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY-GENERAL LEE: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the thanks of the\r\nSociety and its invited guests are justly due and are hereby tendered\r\nMr. Thomas J. Talty, Manager of the Hotel Raleigh, for his careful\r\npersonal attention to the banquet and its details, and for his uniform\r\ncourtesy to members and guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Motion carried by unanimous vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY-GENERAL LEE: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the thanks of the\r\nSociety be tendered to our fellow-member, Mr. Henry L. Joyce, Manager of\r\nthe Marine Department of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, to\r\nMr. W. C.

I thank you one and all for your\r\nattendance. The next annual dinner will take place in the city of New\r\nYork, and we hope you will all be with us there and that the attendance\r\nwill be even greater than tonight.\r\n\r\nThere being no further business before the Society, I declare this\r\nmeeting adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\nThe Committee in charge of the entire proceedings in Washington were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DINNER COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n  HON.

I., and by her transcribed. Within a\r\nfew days afterwards, a copy of his speech was furnished each speaker, so\r\nthat it would come to the hands of the Editor of the _Journal_ exactly\r\nas the speaker wished it finally to read.\r\n\r\nThe stenographic report and transcription were absolutely complete and\r\nwithout error.\r\n\r\nThe floral decorations on the tables and walls were beautiful and\r\nlavish, and at the termination of the dinner some of the nice pieces\r\nwere sent to the quarters of our lady guests, while the remainder were\r\nsent to the hospitals.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening music was furnished by a good orchestra. The words of\r\n“Star Spangled Banner,” “Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,” “Wearing of\r\nthe Green,” “Minstrel Boy,” and “Yankee Doodle” were printed on the\r\nprogram, and the assemblage, accompanied by the musicians, sung these\r\nsongs with a will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON.

In the dining car\r\na special dinner was prepared and served under the supervision of\r\nConductor Lewis A. Herring, which was enjoyed by nearly all who returned\r\non that train, and he made the occasion enjoyable by pointing out\r\nseveral interesting bits of scenery _en route_, among which was the\r\nplace where Washington crossed the Delaware. The menu was as follows:\r\n\r\n                        Broiled Sardines on Toast\r\n                        Blue Points on Half Shell\r\n  Ox Joint, Anglaise                                Consomme, Macedoine\r\n        Celery                                              Olives\r\n                       Baked Mackerel, Royal Sauce\r\n                            Potatoes, Julienne\r\n Lamb Chops, with Green Peas                       French Pancake, au Rum\r\n                         Prime Roast Beef, au Jus\r\n     Mashed Potatoes                                   Fried Parsnips\r\n                      Roast Turkey, Cranberry Sauce\r\n   String Beans                                      Spinach, with Egg\r\n                               Claret Punch\r\n                       Chicken Salad, au Mayonnaise\r\n                      Tapioca Pudding, Custard Sauce\r\n     Vanilla Ice Cream                                 Assorted Cake\r\n                               Sugar Wafers\r\n                        Roquefort and Edam Cheese\r\n     Toasted Water Crackers                            Saltine Wafers\r\n                               Black Coffee\r\n                               Benedictine\r\n\r\n                                    WASHINGTON, D.

C., this day at 1.30 p. m.,\r\nPresident-General Quinlan in the chair.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. Donovan of New York, it was voted to revise the\r\nconstitution and by-laws of the Society, and the President-General was\r\ninstructed to appoint a committee of five to do this work, they to\r\nreport to the Executive Council.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. T. Vincent Butler of New York, the thanks of the\r\nSociety were tendered to the President-General and the Secretary-General\r\nfor their efficient services in preparing for “the grandest meeting the\r\nSociety has ever held.” Mr. Butler, in support of his motion, made\r\ninteresting remarks concerning our fellow-member, President Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nThe President-General later announced that he had appointed the\r\nfollowing gentlemen members of the Committee to Revise the Constitution\r\nand By-Laws: Messrs. Michael J. Jordan, Patrick J. McCarthy, Joseph T.\r\nRyan, John E. O’Brien and Thomas Z.

GREENE OF PROVIDENCE, R. I.\r\n\r\n  HONORARY STATE REGENT FOR RHODE ISLAND, NATIONAL SOCIETY DAUGHTERS OF\r\n    THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, GREAT-GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER OF THOMAS HUGHES,\r\n    CAPTAIN IN THE WAR OF THE REVOLUTION AND MAJOR IN THE WAR OF 1812\r\n    AND AN ORIGINAL MEMBER OF THE RHODE ISLAND SOCIETY OF THE\r\n    CINCINNATI—A MAN OF IRISH PARENTAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho that visits Italy can fail to be inspired by the ruins of the Forum\r\nand the palaces of the Cæsars on the Palatine? The Italian Government\r\nhas done wisely in making its work of excavation a work also of\r\nrestoration by replacing as far as possible the statues and monuments of\r\nancient time in their original positions, and in entrusting visitors to\r\nthe care of guides educated for their duties by a university course in\r\nthe history and archæology of the Eternal City. Such a guide, after a\r\nwhole day spent in enthusiastic descriptions of the temples, public\r\nbuildings, rostra and tombs of the Forum, was asked, “How happens it\r\nthat you are so very enthusiastic over all this, when it is your duty to\r\nmake this round day after day?” Never will the hearer forget his reply\r\nas, drawing himself up to his full height, he exclaimed with the\r\nproudest, loftiest accent, “_I am a Roman_.”\r\n\r\n“The grandeur that was Rome” was the spirit of her citizens, their\r\nexpression in the life of their city, of their high ideals. When these\r\nideals failed to inspire, Rome fell.\r\n\r\nThat which makes a State is the character of its citizens. One of the\r\nstrongest influences in the moulding of character is the example of the\r\nheroes of the past. Preservation of the history of those who helped to\r\nmake and mould the nation is, therefore, essential to the maintenance of\r\npatriotism. Indeed, it is essential to the true moral development of the\r\nnation,—to the very preservation of the nation.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of the memorial tablet and the statue over the printed\r\npage is that the former are seen and understood by all, while the pages\r\nof history are only turned by those who have a certain degree of\r\neducation and interest. “What mean ye by these stones?” the children in\r\nthe land of Canaan would ask, gazing upon the heap of twelve smooth\r\nstones by the banks of the Jordan. Then would the fathers in Israel\r\nreply, “Because the waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the\r\nCovenant of the Lord, and these stones from the bed of the river are for\r\na memorial forever of Jehovah’s leadership of his people through the dry\r\nbed of the river into the promised land.”\r\n\r\nThe historical and patriotic societies of the United States are doing a\r\nmuch needed work by the erection of tablets and the marking of historic\r\nspots. A want of reverence for those who founded our nation and fought\r\nto establish it; a carelessness as to the lessons to be learned from the\r\nearly history of the country; a desecration of places consecrated by the\r\nblood of our heroes, had much to do with making us, in appearance, a\r\nflippant, boastful people, glorying only in the “bigness” of our country\r\nand what our own generation was doing, in short, the boastful Yankee\r\ncaricatured by our European kinsmen.\r\n\r\nThat temper has changed. While the greater seriousness with which the\r\nAmerican people undertake their problems of government is no doubt in\r\npart due to territorial expansion and greater international relations,\r\ncredit must also be given to the impressive influence of the memorials\r\nplaced in our State houses, our parks, along our streets, commemorating\r\nthe worthy deeds of our ancestors.\r\n\r\nIt is then a direct benefit to the State, and aid to good government, and\r\nto the realization of the highest civic ideals, to place, where all can\r\nsee, memorials reciting the virtues and the heroic deeds of men like\r\nWashington, Lincoln, Greene, Sullivan, Sherman and a host of others\r\nwhose splendid achievements, in war and in peace, are a part of our\r\nheritage as American citizens, and are the inspiration of our youth to\r\ngive also of their best, in talents and in loyal, patriotic effort; to\r\nmake our country great in the best sense,—great in the character of its\r\ncitizens, great in the accomplishment of high ideals; great in the\r\nenjoyment by all of the blessings of liberty.\r\n\r\nProvidence, R.

It\r\nnumbered men and women prominent in the business and social life of the\r\ncity, as well as others interested in charitable work.\r\n\r\nAfter Bishop Harkins, wearing the purple robes of his office, had taken\r\na seat on the stage, with Fr. Dowling on his right and Rev. William Pyne\r\non his left, Mr. Carter made the following speech in presenting the\r\nstructure to the Bishop:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MR. CARTER’S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n“Bishop Harkins: In my own name and that of Mrs. Carter I have great\r\npleasure in handing over to you this morning, as the representative of\r\nNazareth home and the head of the diocese of Providence, the keys of the\r\nEdward A. Carter Memorial, the receipted bills for its cost and a\r\npaid-up five years’ policy of insurance on the building for $15,000.\r\n\r\n“I am sure it is a happy moment for Mrs. Carter and for me; I may say,\r\nthe proudest moment of our lives, to be in a position to commemorate in\r\nthis way our son who gave such promise in his youth, and who was taken\r\nfrom us so suddenly.\r\n\r\n“A little more than a year ago we laid him away in St. Francis Cemetery\r\nand with him the hopes that we had built upon, but the money which would\r\nhave been his to invest in business had he lived we have resolved to lay\r\naside for his memory in another kind of investment.\r\n\r\n“This is our only stipulation—that it be administered prudently,\r\nscientifically, but with mercy and in the spirit of Christian charity.\r\n\r\n“We have no fear, Bishop, that the money which we have given to the\r\nNazareth Home will ever be diverted from the purpose for which we intend\r\nit. We require no bonds from you, for your high standing makes the\r\nordinary safeguard of business in this case unnecessary. Into whatever\r\nhands you entrust it, we feel certain that they will execute what we\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n“You, ladies of the Queen’s Daughters, honor us with your presence here\r\ntoday. You have presided at the formation of this work; your ideas are\r\nhere incorporated and you have pledged yourselves to its support;\r\ntherefore, may I be the first to welcome you to its hospitality.\r\n\r\n“Let me then, Bishop Harkins, in closing, hand over to you these\r\nevidences that the building so happily completed is entirely\r\nunencumbered; and let me assure you that while in doing so I now resign\r\nthe responsibility which has been my preoccupation and pleasure for\r\nseveral months, still, while either Mrs. Carter or myself live, our\r\nhearts are in this building, both for the name it bears and for the work\r\nwhich we have confidence it will never fail to do in our community.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RESPONSE OF BISHOP.\r\n\r\nIn response Bishop Harkins said in part: “Mr. and Mrs. Carter, I receive\r\nvery willingly and gratefully these evidences of your generosity. I\r\nexpress to you my thanks and those of the entire community. There may\r\nhave been other cases in the United States like this, but this is the\r\nfirst case that has come to my knowledge where a memorial of this kind\r\nhas been reared to an apparently lost, but not really lost, son.\r\n\r\n“This is a very special, a very peculiar case. It shows not only a very\r\nstrong affection, but a very lively faith. It is that faith that is\r\nnecessary, a faith in the future, a realization that death does not end\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“Your son was a Cathedral boy, and when I say that I speak with a\r\nconsiderable degree of pride. He was one of us and we knew him and loved\r\nhim. You determined that he should live on in a certain way and live\r\njust about where he lived when he was here. So you have made your boy to\r\nlive; you have given him a kind of earthly immortality, if I may use\r\nthat term.\r\n\r\n“He will live in the persons of the poor children who will be cared for\r\nhere. They will have the uplifting influence of the good sisters, the\r\nQueen’s Daughters, the clergy, and all who can help them in any way. Yet\r\nit will be he who will be living here.\r\n\r\n“I thank you in my own name and in the name of the diocese of\r\nProvidence. I am sure that all those here present agree that no better\r\nexample can be given a community than that given here today. There is\r\ngratitude in the hearts of all the citizens of Providence for this gift.\r\n\r\n“In the name of the sisters who will have charge of this institution, I\r\nwish to thank you. I welcomed them to our city here in Providence, for I\r\nknew that I could not do greater service than to bring here the wise and\r\ncareful administration of charitable work they have always shown. They\r\nwill be mothers to the children. They will try to give, and will\r\nwell-nigh succeed in giving, all the maternal love that is given\r\nchildren in the most favored homes. They will train them not only in\r\ntheir duties to the church, but in every duty they must perform in civil\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Bishop Harkins paid a tribute to the Queen’s Daughters,\r\nthe organization which has assumed the maintenance of the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DONORS ARE HONORED.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bishop’s address, Miss Mary A. McArdle, President of the\r\nQueen’s Daughters, made a brief address, in which she stated that Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Carter had been elected honorary members of the Daughters of\r\nthe Queen of Heaven, concluding by presenting to Mrs. Carter a bouquet\r\nof roses, in number the same as the years of life of the son in whose\r\nmemory the structure was given.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter responded briefly and the visitors then inspected the\r\nbuilding, many registering in the book provided for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAmong those present were: Mgr. Thomas F. Doran, Vicar General of the\r\ndiocese; Rev. Owen F. Clarke, Rev. Edward E. Seagrave, Rev. D. F.\r\nLowney, Rev. James C. Walsh, Rev. M. J. McCabe, Mayor P. J. McCarthy,\r\nMayor-elect Henry Fletcher, Attorney-General William B. Greenough,\r\nAssistant Attorney-General Harry P. Cross, Cyrus P. Brown, Col. Cyrus M.\r\nVan Slyck, Judge Frank E. Fitzsimmons, Judge Thomas Z. Lee, John E.\r\nCanning and Thomas F. Monahan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MODEL INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThis nursery, said to be one of the finest institutions of its kind in\r\nthe country, has been erected for the accommodation of poor children,\r\nregardless of race, creed or color. The Queen’s Daughters, a body of\r\nCatholic women with a membership of 700, which was organized in January\r\nof the present year for the performance of charitable works, has assumed\r\nits maintenance. The organization is affiliated with the Queen’s\r\nDaughters of St. Louis, formed in 1889 by thirty-two women of that city\r\nfor charitable purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Sisters of the Holy Ghost, also known as the White Sisters, to whom\r\nthe institution was donated, first came to work among the sick poor in\r\nthis city in September, 1907. In their errands of mercy they found that\r\na day nursery was very much needed in the section in which their home is\r\nlocated. The two day nurseries already established have been unable to\r\ntake care of all the children, both having long waiting lists, and the\r\nbuilding blessed yesterday will relieve the situation to a considerable\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe building is admirably arranged, the purpose for which it will be\r\nused having been taken into careful consideration by the architects,\r\nStone, Carpenter & Sheldon, and the ideas of the architects being\r\nfaithfully carried out by the builder, M. J. Houlihan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VICTOR HERBERT.\r\n\r\n  Of New York.\r\n\r\n  The Eminent Composer and High Authority on Music.\r\n\r\n  A New Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Carter’s intelligent liberality has rendered possible in Providence\r\na charity of peculiar value. The handsome building is a better monument\r\nto his son’s memory than the most costly sarcophagus would be. It bids\r\nfair for many years to come to minister to the needs of great numbers of\r\nchildren of tender age whose parents cannot care for them during the\r\nworking hours of the day; and the community would have double reason to\r\ncongratulate itself if the example set by these donors were to inspire\r\nother citizens of Providence to similar generous gifts. There are\r\ntwenty-three thousand women in this city who are employed in gainful\r\noccupations, and many of them are married, with small children to\r\nprovide for. It is difficult to think of a more useful institution than\r\none that helps to lighten the domestic anxieties of these workers during\r\ntheir enforced absence from home.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter is a member of the American Irish Historical Society and of\r\nits Executive Council and served on the Reception Committee at the\r\nevents in Washington January 16, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WAR RECORD OF COLONEL JAMES QUINLAN.\r\n\r\n ONE OF THE EARLIEST MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n       BY FRANCIS J. QUINLAN, M. D., L. L. D., PRESIDENT-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Volume VI of the Journal appeared a short sketch of Colonel Quinlan’s\r\nlife, in which his military record was incomplete and the date of birth\r\nand receipt of certain commissions were incorrectly stated. The data\r\nhaving been carefully collected and verified, a revised sketch is hereby\r\nsubmitted:\r\n\r\nJames Quinlan was born in Tipperary, Ireland, September 13, 1833, and\r\ncame to New York in 1850 and there studied engineering. In 1853 he\r\njoined the National Guard and became a member of the Sixty-Ninth\r\nRegiment, being commissioned a Lieutenant in 1855, under Charles S. Roe,\r\nand commissioned Captain in 1856.\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 1861, a few days after the fall of Fort Sumter, he left New\r\nYork with the Sixty-Ninth as Captain of Engineers. He was present at the\r\nbattle of Blackburn’s Ford, July 18th, and Bull Run July 21st, where he\r\nwas severely wounded. After this battle Acting Brigadier-General T. F.\r\nMeagher recruited the celebrated Irish Brigade, and he was commissioned\r\nMajor of the Eighty-Eighth New York Infantry, one of the regiments of\r\nthat organization, in 1861, and ordered by General Meagher to proceed to\r\nFort Schuyler and take command there until further orders. (As far as we\r\nknow, he was the first volunteer officer to take command of a Fort in\r\nthe Civil War.) He was present in all the battles of that famous Brigade\r\nin the Peninsular Campaign and commanded the regiment all through the\r\nSeven Days’ fighting. He won his Medal of Honor by leading a charge on a\r\nConfederate battery at Savage Station, Va., June 29, 1862. The battery\r\nin question was one of six guns, and had been very annoying to the Union\r\ntroops. Several other regiments had made efforts to silence it, but\r\nwithout avail. General W. W. Burns, U. S. A., who was in command on that\r\nmemorable day, wrote at the time Major Quinlan received his Medal of\r\nHonor as follows: “The Medal of Honor won by your gallant charge which\r\nsilenced the enemy’s battery at Savage Station and closed that desperate\r\nattack upon the rear of the Army of the Potomac, June 29, 1862, is a\r\njust reward and memento for conspicuous bravery due from a grateful\r\nRepublic to the brave leader of the gallant Eighty-Eighth New York. No\r\none can feel more satisfaction for this signal proof of distinction and\r\nglory than your old Commander of that day. The Eighty-Eighth saved the\r\nlives of many gallant soldiers by that forlorn-hope charge, and cleared\r\nour way to victory that day. It commemorated the charge of the Irish\r\nBrigade at Fontenoy.” In the Circular “Medals of Honor” issued by the\r\nWar Department October 31, 1897, the ground of award of Major Quinlan’s\r\nmedal is as follows: “Led his regiment on the enemy’s battery, silenced\r\nthe guns, held the position against overwhelming numbers, and covered\r\nthe retreat of the Second Army Corps.” He was honorably mentioned by\r\nGeneral McClellan for bravery at Malvern Hill and Antietam. He was\r\ncommissioned Lieutenant-Colonel on September 22, 1862, and received his\r\nhonorable discharge for disability on medical certificate February 4,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks’ illness of heart trouble he died at his home, 104\r\nEast 96th Street, August 29, 1906.\r\n\r\nAnd so has passed into history the name of a citizen of foreign birth,\r\nwho owed allegiance to the whole of his adopted country, and when her\r\ntroubles came he was found early at the front, dedicating his all to her\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\nA firm, honest friend, a devoted Christian, a loyal brave soldier went\r\nto his rest when James Quinlan joined the soldiers of our great Republic\r\nwho had gone before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH O’CONNOR, EDITOR, AUTHOR AND POET, WHO DECEASED AT ROCHESTER, N.\r\n                         Y., OCTOBER 9TH, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SKETCH OF HIS LIFE. ONE OF HIS FAVORITE POEMS.\r\n\r\nA great editor laid down forever a brilliant, beautiful and useful pen\r\nwhen Joseph O’Connor, the Rochesterian, passed into Eternity from his\r\nhome in Rochester on the night of October 9, 1908.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours the news had flashed to all points of the compass,\r\nbringing a pause and a hush of sadness to thousands of homes, from Maine\r\nto California, wherein his unique personality was known and loved\r\nthrough his nearly forty years of journalistic leadership.\r\n\r\nBorn in New York State of Irish parents in 1841, he was educated in the\r\nbest schools of his native State for the practice of the law, but he\r\nearly chose journalism instead of law for his life work and he made a\r\nmagnificent success of it.\r\n\r\nHe brought to the work a mind well-stocked with more of the true history\r\nof the world than falls to the lot of most students of history. He\r\nbrought to his work a mind imbued with the true Christian philosophy of\r\nthe Catholic catechism. He had formed from youth up a habit of broad,\r\nkindly outlook on things in general. He assumed and maintained a manly\r\nattitude in politics, uncompromising in principle, but tolerant of other\r\nmen’s opinions. He had a born poet’s appreciation of true poetry, and a\r\nliterary judgment that came to be universally respected. He had a gift\r\nof expression as a model of unique, finished, sincere writing. And his\r\nhumility was the best of it all.\r\n\r\nHe won his readers to his way of seeing things as much by the very\r\napparent unconsciousness of his own superiority as by his logical\r\npresentation of his subject.\r\n\r\nThrough all his long life of varied editorship and many degrees of\r\npolitical and literary success, there is no pessimism charged to his\r\naccount, no animosity, no bitterness; not even discourtesy.\r\n\r\nMany a time in the heat of a political campaign he had to strike at a\r\nchampion of the other side, but his blow was always leonine. It was a\r\nsettler of the subject in dispute, but it left no ugly memories—no\r\ngalling personalities ever marred his political battles.\r\n\r\nHe scored his successes by the friendly hand shakes of his worsted\r\nantagonists.\r\n\r\nHe prized his independence in politics, and never jeopardized it by\r\naccepting favors or honors from friend or foe.\r\n\r\nWith one or two exceptions, every change that he made in his position\r\nwas due to his insistent desire to maintain his personal independence as\r\na writer. He left the _Indianapolis Sentinel_ because he did not wish to\r\nconform to its political policy. His editorial work on the _New York\r\nWorld_ became irksome on this same account. He broke with the managers\r\nof the _Buffalo Courier_ in 1886 because he disliked Grover Cleveland\r\nand because he did not propose to stultify his editorial utterances in a\r\nnewspaper whose proprietor was specially friendly at the time to the\r\nBuffalo President. He is said to have refused a flattering offer from\r\nCharles A. Dana to become editorial writer on the _New York Sun_ because\r\nhe did not believe he could conform to Mr. Dana’s ideas, however much he\r\nmight admire the genius of that brilliant editor.\r\n\r\nHe set his editorial chair on a calm high level and from it addressed\r\ndaily a clientele that loyally followed him in all his journeyings\r\nthrough fields of philosophy, history, poetry, romance and even the\r\ncommon things of everyday life. To read him once was to seek him again\r\nand remain his disciple.\r\n\r\nHe might have made his fame rest on his poetry, but he subordinated that\r\ngift to his passion for regular, constant work in his editorial chair,\r\nindulging in flights of fancy only as a pastime.\r\n\r\nMr. O’Connor was a master of the English language; indeed, it is\r\ndoubtful if any man on the American press ever wrote it better. Some\r\ntwenty years ago a correspondent of the _New York Sun_ asked Mr. Dana\r\nfor information regarding literary style. In the course of his reply he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Among the newspaper writers of our own country and of the present day,\r\nperhaps the best style is that of Mr. Joseph O’Connor, the editor of\r\n_The Post Express_ of Rochester. It is terse, lucid, calm,\r\nargumentative, and without a trace of effort or affectation.”\r\n\r\nAfter quoting this tribute, said Father Cronin of the _Buffalo Union and\r\nTimes_: “It is no small source of pride and gratification to us to know\r\nthat one of the great princes of American journalism is an Irish\r\nAmerican. Mr. O’Connor’s pen is like the Damascene blade, polished and\r\nbeautiful, yet withal so smooth and keen that the victim of its blow is\r\nsevered in twain almost without realizing the catastrophe. Long may\r\nJoseph O’Connor wield it, as he has always wielded it, a menace to evil\r\nand a swift and sure protection to the right.”\r\n\r\nAll over the State of New York the daily and weekly papers, the day\r\nafter his death, contained most flattering and affectionate tributes to\r\nhis memory, and these were echoed and reinforced since by the press of\r\nthe whole country, for “The Rochesterian” gave the key to the right\r\nsolution of many a question to hundreds of editors who sought in the\r\nexchanges for “J. O’C’s” latest.\r\n\r\nSaid the _Rochester Times_: “For intelligence and insight he had few\r\npeers among the great journalists of his time; but in addition he had\r\nwhat some more renowned than he have lacked—absolute bravery of\r\nconviction. His pen was unconditionally consecrated to truth as he saw\r\ntruth; and nothing could weaken his allegiance. It is familiar history\r\nthat he could have held some of the highest posts in American journalism\r\nhad he been willing to bend his honor or relax his sincerity.”\r\n\r\n“Intellectually,” says the _Syracuse Herald_, “he was one of the\r\nfrankest and bravest of men, never hesitating to champion a cause that\r\nappealed to his reason or humanity because it happened to be temporarily\r\nunpopular.”\r\n\r\n“Journalism,” says the _Troy Press_, “loses a philosophical writer, a\r\nbrilliant scholar and a veritable ‘knowledge-box’ in the death of Joseph\r\nO’Connor of _The Post Express_. He was one of the few editors whose\r\ntalent and resources were so abounding that adequately to replace him is\r\npractically out of the question.”\r\n\r\n“He set before the men of his profession,” says the _Rochester Herald_,\r\n“an example of frankness, courage, and independence which is emulated\r\nwherever it is possible to follow it, and is admired and envied where\r\nconditions do not permit of its acceptance. The utterances of\r\nnewspapers, elsewhere in the country as well as here, are more sincere,\r\nmore fearless, and freer from cant and sham because of the ideals\r\nrevered and upheld by Joseph O’Connor.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. O’Connor,” says the _Rochester Times_, “was a man of extensive\r\nacquaintance, of legions of friends but with few ‘cronies.’ Among these\r\nfavored few might be numbered Rev. Louis A. Lambert of Scottsville,\r\neditor-in-chief of the _New York Freeman’s Journal_; Rev. John L. Codyre\r\nof Fairport, Judge John D. Lynn, and a few others. His friendships were\r\nfor literary characters and their conversation was of the ultra\r\nintellectual thought. Abstruse theological and philosophical problems\r\nwere discussed with as much freedom as ordinary persons talk of the\r\nweather. Yet Mr. O’Connor in his kindly, lovable, winsome way could talk\r\nentertainingly on the commonest topic with any acquaintance and his was\r\nthe tactful manner which never made one feel his smallness before him.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the tribute paid him by the _Rochester, N. Y., Herald_ of\r\nOctober 10th, 1908, in its editorial column.\r\n\r\nThe Society, in response to its request for further information for its\r\narchives, received the following communication from Mr. O’Connor’s\r\nlifelong friend, Edmond Redmond, Esq., which we print in full:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  230 Spencer St., Rochester, N. Y.,\r\n                                                      November 13, 1908.\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Thomas Z. Lee, Secretary-General American Irish Historical\r\n     Society,\r\n      Providence, R. I._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: I duly received your letter of the 5th instant requesting\r\n  such material as I may have in relation to a biographical sketch of\r\n  the late Joseph O’Connor.\r\n\r\n  I assume that you have seen the notices printed in Rochester and other\r\n  newspapers immediately following his decease. I regret that I can add\r\n  but little to those eulogies, which were, I have reason to believe,\r\n  written by intimate associates and came from the heart.\r\n\r\n  I thought that less was said by his recent friends about his interest\r\n  in Ireland and her cause than deserves to be known. And on that point\r\n  I can testify from acquaintance with him that few things were nearer\r\n  or dearer to him than the land of his ancestors. His pen and voice\r\n  were ever ready to work in the cause of Ireland, and I have no doubt\r\n  that his personal fortunes, in the ordinary commercial sense, suffered\r\n  from the persistence with which, all through life, he continued to\r\n  bring to the attention of an indifferent public the wrongs inflicted\r\n  on the people of the island. It was, however, a labor of love with\r\n  him, and his zeal in the cause continued to the end. He had no\r\n  confidence in secret societies effecting any great good in Irish\r\n  politics; but he gave hearty support to the Land League in Parnell’s\r\n  day. He was a delegate to the famous Land League convention of 1886 in\r\n  Chicago, and was urged by friends to let them propose him for\r\n  President of the American branch of the Society. He has been heard to\r\n  say that he was indebted to the Land League for the experience which\r\n  enabled him in later years to feel at home on his feet while engaged\r\n  in public speaking on other subjects.\r\n\r\n  His regard for Ireland could not have been stronger had he been a\r\n  native of the land, and it was evidently inherited. Years ago he heard\r\n  a friend humming “As Slow Our Ship Her Foamy Track,” and said that\r\n  when his father was leaving Ireland a group gathered about him on the\r\n  deck of the ship as he sung that song, and before it was finished they\r\n  were all in tears.\r\n\r\n  Although usually slow to anger, he was liable to be moved on hearing\r\n  the creditable deeds of plain Irishmen ascribed, as they are so often,\r\n  to the “Scotch-Irish,”—a designation which he detested, employed as it\r\n  usually is to detract from Ireland the reflected honor to which she is\r\n  entitled from the worthy fame of her children.\r\n\r\n  If the nature and scope of the work which you have in hand permits of\r\n  eulogy, it would be impossible to speak too highly of O’Connor’s\r\n  character. In both public and private life he was the soul of honor.\r\n  His talents were of the first order and always exerted toward good\r\n  ends. His integrity was unbounding. Like Gay his “manners were gentle,\r\n  his affections mild.” In a word he was a really great and uncommonly\r\n  good citizen, a true and noble man. One of his favorite poets was\r\n  Goldsmith and I cannot better end this too brief sketch than with what\r\n  the author of “The Deserted Village” said of Reynolds:—\r\n\r\n                       To tell you my mind.\r\n               He has not left a greater or better behind.\r\n\r\n                                             Very truly yours,\r\n                                                         EDMOND REDMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. O’Connor was the author of many poems, and in 1895 the Putnams\r\nbrought out a little volume of his modestly entitled “Poems.” Many of\r\nthe shorter poems in the book are characterized by delicate fancy and\r\ngraceful rhyming; such poems as “Her Hands,” “Water Lilies,” and the\r\n“Wine Song.” He favored these smaller, slighter children of his fancy.\r\nHe thought the best poem he ever wrote was “The Cavalier Sword,” and\r\nnext in order he placed “The Fount of Castaly.” In our opinion “Her\r\nHands” is the sweetest and most graceful of them all, and we print it\r\nherewith:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HER HANDS.\r\n\r\n               Sometimes I sit and try to trace\r\n                 In memory’s records dim and faint,\r\n               The features of my mother’s face,\r\n               With the calm look of gentle grace\r\n                 That marked our house’s quiet saint.\r\n\r\n               The innocence of her blue eyes,\r\n                 The winning smile about her lips,\r\n               Child-simple and yet woman-wise,\r\n               Her shining hair, her modest guise,\r\n                 All come in turn; each fades and slips.\r\n\r\n               I try to fix them, but in vain;\r\n                 They waver, and yet will not fuse,\r\n               Howe’er imagination strain,\r\n               To form the face that it would feign—\r\n                 Till on a sudden, as I muse\r\n\r\n               There comes a thought of her dear hands,\r\n                 All wrinkled, tanned and labor-worn—\r\n               And there the simple woman stands,\r\n               To meet her duty’s hard demands,\r\n                 Among the children she has borne.\r\n\r\n               No work nor written word remains,\r\n                 Nor picture worthy to approve;\r\n               But read in knotted joints and veins,\r\n               And tendons strong, and honest stains,\r\n                 The tale of service and of love.\r\n\r\n               O hands of ministry, that wrought\r\n                 In constant care, through weal and woe,\r\n               Nor rest by crib or coffin caught,\r\n               This pang is mine—I never thought\r\n                 To kiss your fingers long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           CHIEF EGAN’S WAR RECORD WRITTEN FOR STATE ARCHIVES\r\n\r\n                        FROM PROVIDENCE JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Irwin of San Francisco, an Irishman, formerly First Lieutenant of\r\nCompany F, Third Rhode Island Heavy Artillery, who served under Gen.\r\nCharles R. Brayton, a guest and speaker at the dedication of the Society\r\nof the Sullivan Memorial December 16, 1908, has recently written a\r\nsketch of his service in the Army, and while compiling the story ran\r\nacross several notes of incidents in Army life which directly concern\r\nChief of Police Patrick Egan, of Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\nMr. Irwin has forwarded the information to General Brayton, in order\r\nthat it may be preserved in the archives of the State. In his letter Mr.\r\nIrwin says: “Being a native of the Emerald Isle, I claim the right to\r\nmake a little Irish bull by saying that when I enlisted at Providence\r\nthe only man I knew in my regiment was a boy fifteen years old. The day\r\nthat I made up my mind to be one of the ’200,000 more’ called for by\r\nPresident Lincoln, I went into the workshop where this boy was learning\r\nthe shoe trade and said to him, ‘Patsy, I am going to enlist. Don’t you\r\nwant to go?’\r\n\r\n“He looked up with a smile on his face and replied: ‘Yes, if you will.’\r\n\r\n“‘All right,’ I said, ‘come along. I’m going.’\r\n\r\n“I can imagine I see him now getting up from his bench, taking off his\r\napron, throwing it down and putting on his coat.\r\n\r\n“Away we went to the recruiting office and signed the roll, he giving\r\nhis age as seventeen, which no one doubted. He was tall for his years.\r\n\r\n“I had hoped we would be placed in the same company, that I might be\r\nnear him and keep an eye on him, for I felt somewhat responsible for\r\ntaking him away from his widowed mother, but fate or fortunes of war\r\nwilled it otherwise. I was assigned to Company G and he to Company C,\r\nwhich was afterward mounted as a light battery. However, he soon proved\r\nto be well able to take care of himself, except, perhaps, on one\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n“That was soon after the Port Royal, S. C., expedition,” Mr. Irwin\r\nexplains, “of which our regiment was a part, sailed from Hampton Roads\r\nlate in October, 1861, the land forces, consisting of about 12,500 men,\r\nbeing under Gen. Thomas W. Sherman, and a fleet of seventeen warships\r\nand thirty transports and supply vessels, commanded by Commodore Samuel\r\nF. DuPont.\r\n\r\n“About a week before sailing our regiment embarked on an old steamship,\r\nwhich had been used for carrying cotton from New Orleans to New York.\r\nPatsy’s company happened to be assigned to the poorest quarters on the\r\nship—the lower hold. The accommodations for 1,000 men were none too\r\ngood, consequently, we had more or less sickness on board.\r\n\r\n“Hearing one day that Patsy was ill, I went in search of him, and found\r\nhim in a dark, poorly ventilated hole. He was a very sick boy. I took\r\nhim up to my company’s quarters and put him into a berth near the\r\nhatchway, where he got better air, and, with a little care—the best we\r\ncould give him under the circumstances, as we were then off Cape\r\nHatteras and having very stormy weather—he soon recovered and in a few\r\ndays he was himself again.\r\n\r\n“It may not be out of place to relate here a little incident which took\r\nplace one night during the height of the storm. About midnight the rain\r\nwas coming down in sheets, the sea running high and the wind blowing a\r\ngale, when, in an instant, over went the old ship on her beam’s end.\r\nThis caused quite a commotion among the boys—we were all called ‘boys’\r\nthen—some of whom rushed to the hatchway to get on deck, but were\r\nprevailed upon to remain below. One of the foremost of them, ‘Jim’\r\nBurns, a countryman of mine, dropped on his knees on the stairs and\r\ncommenced praying like a good fellow. The others quieted down and paid\r\nall due respect to Jim and his prayers. In a few minutes the ship\r\nrighted again, and in a short time the worst of the storm was over.\r\n\r\n“Next day things looked a little brighter and some of the boys thought\r\nthey might have a little fun at Jim’s expense. Being First Sergeant of\r\nthe company, they suggested that I appoint Jim Chaplain of the company,\r\nseeing he had made such a good prayer the night before. When I told him\r\nof their wishes, he looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and replied:\r\n\r\n“‘No you don’t appoint me Chaplain. Let them go to the ‘divil,’ and do\r\ntheir own prayin’.’\r\n\r\n“After losing four of our supply vessels during the storm, we arrived at\r\nour destination on the morning of November 7, 1861, and witnessed the\r\nsame day the bombardment and capture by the Navy of Fort Walker on\r\nHilton Head, and Fort Beauregard on Bay Point, S. C. We landed on the\r\n‘sacred soil’ late in the afternoon, our regiment taking possession of\r\nthe abandoned rebel fortifications.\r\n\r\n“I saw but little of Patsy after this. Active operations were soon\r\ncommenced, our regiment was broken up and the companies scattered over\r\nthe islands and swamps about Charleston and Savannah, where they took a\r\nprominent part in the following: Siege and surrender of Fort Pulaski,\r\nGa., from January 1 to April 15, 1862; battle of Secessionville, James\r\nIsland, near Charleston, June 16, 1862; battle of Pocotaligo, S. C., on\r\nthe Charleston and Savannah Railroad, October 21, 1862; capture of\r\nMorris Island and Fort Wagner, and in the bombardment and memorable\r\nsiege of Fort Sumter, 1863, and many other smaller engagements.\r\n\r\n“In the spring of 1863 I met his captain (Brayton), who had been a\r\nLieutenant in my company and afterward Colonel of the regiment, and\r\nasked him how ‘Patrick Egan’—that was the boy’s name—‘was getting\r\nalong.’\r\n\r\n“He answered, ‘Egan is getting along all right. He is one of my best\r\nboys. I have just made him a corporal.’\r\n\r\n“The first time I met Patsy after this was on the disastrous battlefield\r\nof Olustee, Florida, February 20, 1864. He was then a Sergeant and had\r\ncharge of a section of his battery, which was temporarily attached to a\r\nfour-gun Battery M of the First United States Artillery. When I was\r\nordered to retire from the field with the remnant of the battery in\r\nwhich I was then serving, E, Third United States Artillery, by the late\r\nSenator Hawley, who was then Colonel of the Seventh Connecticut, and\r\nActing Brigadier-General, we passed near to where young Egan was, with\r\nhis two guns in position.\r\n\r\n“I rode up to him and exclaimed, ‘Patsy, what are you doing here?’\r\n\r\n“His reply was, ‘We are doing the best we can.’\r\n\r\n“Not seeing any officers present, I then said to him, ‘You had better\r\nget out of here as soon as possible, or you and your men and guns will\r\nall be captured.’\r\n\r\n“He limbered up, withdrew a short distance and fired a few more shots of\r\ncannister which, I have no doubt, checked, at a critical moment, the\r\nadvance of the enemy.\r\n\r\n“It was now dark, and I believe these were the last guns fired at the\r\nBattle of Olustee, where the Union troops under Gen. Truman Seymour lost\r\n1,900 men in killed, wounded and missing, and five pieces of artillery,\r\nout of a force of about 4,500 men engaged.\r\n\r\n“The Confederates were supposed to have about 6,000 troops, commanded by\r\nGeneral Finnegan, and their loss was reported to be little over 900.\r\n\r\n“This engagement seemed to be more like an ambuscade than anything else.\r\nIt was so unexpected—like a thunderclap out of a clear sky. We were\r\nmarching leisurely through a swampy, thickly-wooded country from early\r\nmorning until 3 p. m., when we came to a clearing and found the enemy,\r\nwho had been retreating for several days, posted in a very strong,\r\nwell-chosen position, partly intrenched and sheltered by thick woods,\r\nwhile we were exposed to their deadly fire in the open field, which\r\naccounts for the great difference in the losses.\r\n\r\n“We retired in good order during the night and next day to Jacksonville,\r\nforty miles distant, with but little trouble from the ‘Johnnies.’ Here\r\nyoung Egan joined his own battery, turned over his section to the\r\ncommanding officer and reported a loss of one man killed, six wounded\r\nand twelve horses killed or disabled. He was slightly wounded himself\r\nand had a horse shot under him. The battery to which his section was\r\nattached lost about thirty-five men in killed, wounded and missing and\r\nthree out of their four guns.\r\n\r\n“I will now quote an incident of camp life taken from his narrative of\r\nthe Florida campaign:\r\n\r\n“‘A few days after our arrival in Jacksonville the battery, together\r\nwith Barton’s Brigade, was ordered to Palatka. Palatka is a small town\r\nseventy miles from Jacksonville, on the St. John’s River, and is, at the\r\npresent time, a winter resort for invalids. It was here that the famous\r\n‘cow incident’ took place, and ‘Who killed the cow?’ afterward became a\r\nby-word in the brigade, especially when Colonel Barton was within\r\nhearing distance.\r\n\r\n“‘It came about in this way: When we occupied Palatka, the only white\r\nperson in the village was an old lady, who had a fine residence, and\r\nColonel Barton, the commander of the brigade, made his headquarters\r\nthere. This woman had a very nice cow, the only one in the village, and\r\nBarton was dependent upon her for milk.\r\n\r\n“‘During the day the cow would feed in the dooryards and on the lawns,\r\nand sometimes she would come around to where Battery C was camped. One\r\nday some of the boys thought what a nice steak and liver they could get\r\nfrom the cow, and, at the same time, get square with Barton, he not\r\nbeing a favorite with the boys. They thought they might kill two birds\r\nwith one stone by getting the steak and liver, and, at the same time,\r\ncut off Barton’s milk supply. So the next day, when the cow came along,\r\none of the boys drove her into a back-yard near the camp, and, in a\r\nshort time, that cow was a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n“‘Steaks and liver were cut out for those who had done the work and for\r\ntheir friends, and the rest of the meat was sent to the cook house,\r\nwhere all had nice beef stew. Everything was all right until\r\nmilking-time, when the cow failed to show up. Then the fun began. Men\r\nwere sent out from headquarters and also from the Provost Marshal’s\r\noffice to try to find the cow and to make inquiries.\r\n\r\n“‘Of course, the men of Battery C knew nothing about her. But they were\r\neventually suspected, for the next morning the Provost Marshal came to\r\nour quarters asking all sorts of questions. Some of the boys, including\r\nyour humble servant, knew nothing about it and were sorry for the\r\nColonel. The following morning Colonel Barton sent for the\r\nnon-commissioned officers and told us that he was satisfied that the\r\nlast seen of the cow was near Battery C’s camp. He also said that all he\r\nwanted was the name of the man who killed the cow, and that some of the\r\nnon-commissioned officers must know something about it. He then asked\r\neach one the name of the man who killed the cow, but each denied all\r\nknowledge of it.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, someone must have given the whole thing away, for the next day\r\nCaptain James had the “assembly” blown and the company fell in. He then\r\ncalled the names of nine men, comprising one Sergeant, one Corporal, and\r\nseven privates. The Sergeant and Corporal were reduced to the ranks,\r\nand, with the other seven, were confined in the guard house, put on a\r\ndiet of bread and water, and made a “spread eagle” of until someone\r\nshould tell who killed the cow.\r\n\r\n“‘Morning and evening they were asked who killed the cow, but they\r\ndenied they knew who did it. This was carried on for three days, when\r\nsomeone put up a job with the pickets, and on the afternoon of the third\r\nday they began firing, the long roll was sounded and the prisoners were\r\nreleased to man the guns. No Johnnies appeared, it being a bluff to get\r\nthe men released. They could not be punished again for the same offence,\r\nso thus ended the cow incident, but Colonel Barton never found out who\r\nkilled the cow.\r\n\r\n“‘In justice to Colonel Barton, who has joined the “Grand Army above,” I\r\nwish to say that I knew him very well and served under him for nearly a\r\nyear, and found him to be a nice gentleman, a strict disciplinarian, a\r\ngood and a brave officer. I will also state that I have good reason for\r\nbelieving that Comrade Egan took no part in “cutting off the Colonel’s\r\nmilk supply” and that the old lady was compensated for the loss of the\r\ncow.’\r\n\r\n“In April, 1864, his battery was ordered to Fort Monroe, Va., where it\r\njoined General Butler’s Army of the James and participated in all the\r\nbattles, sieges and operations around Petersburg and Richmond from May 4\r\nto the close of the war, having fought for the Union in four of the\r\nseceding States—South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Virginia. He was\r\nhonorably discharged when in sight of the steeples of Richmond, October,\r\n1864. At the close of the war his old battery was the first volunteer\r\nbattery to enter that long-coveted and hard-fought-for city—Richmond. To\r\nCapt. Martin S. James of this battery was assigned the honor of\r\ndismantling the fortifications around this famous stronghold and capital\r\nof the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n“When next we met, August, 1904, at the National Encampment, G. A. R.,\r\nin Boston, Mass., I could hardly believe he was the same boy I last\r\nsaw—more than forty years before—on the battlefield of Olustee. He was\r\nthen (1904) a fine specimen of manhood; stood six feet, one and one half\r\ninches, and weighed 240 pounds.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  W. J. O’HAGAN, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Of Charleston, S. C.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for South Carolina.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDLY SONS OF ST. PATRICK IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n                          BY JOHN J. LENEHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in the City of New York\r\nwas instituted on March 17, 1784. It had its origin among Irish officers\r\nconnected with the armies of the American Revolution. On November 25,\r\n1783, the last British soldier departed from the shores of Manhattan,\r\nthe British flag which had been nailed to the flagpole of Fort George\r\nwas hauled down, the American flag was run up in its place, and the\r\nContinental Army entered the city. It was led by George Washington, then\r\nan adopted member of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Philadelphia.\r\nAt his side rode the Governor, General George Clinton, the son of an\r\nIrishman; and the advance battalion was commanded by General Henry Knox,\r\nalso the son of an Irishman, and a member of the Friendly Sons of St.\r\nPatrick of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn the environment produced by these conditions, in the atmosphere of\r\nliberty and Constitutional government that followed the advent of the\r\nAmerican army into its final possession of New York City, was born the\r\nSociety of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick. Daniel McCormick was its\r\nfounder and its president for many years. The objects of the Society\r\nwere to assist poor and distressed natives, and descendants of natives,\r\nof Ireland, and promote friendly, social feelings among its members.\r\n\r\nWith these laudable purposes, on March 17, 1784, the first St. Patrick’s\r\nDay following the evacuation of New York by the British, the Society\r\ninaugurated its festive functions at “Cape’s Tavern.” In the _New York\r\nPacket and Advertiser_ of Thursday, March 18, 1784, the following\r\nappears:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yesterday, being the anniversary of St. Patrick, his patriotic sons\r\n  met at Cape’s Tavern, where they gave an elegant entertainment to his\r\n  Excellency the Governor, Lieut.-Governor, Chancellor and a number of\r\n  other respectable gentlemen of this State. The day and evening were\r\n  spent in festivity and mirth, and a number of suitable toasts were\r\n  drunk upon this joyful occasion. The greatest unanimity and\r\n  conviviality pervaded this numerous and jovial company, and perhaps\r\n  this great Saint was never honoured with a concourse of more generous\r\n  and truly patriotic sons than this assembly afforded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus commenced (in the words of Curran), “those happy meetings when the\r\nswelling heart conceived and communicated the pure and generous purpose,\r\nthe innocent enjoyment of social mirth expanded into the nobler warmth\r\nof social virtue, and the horizon of the board became enlarged into the\r\nhorizon of man.” Almost uninterruptedly since quarterly and anniversary\r\nmeetings of the Society have been held. Many of the leading men of the\r\nCity and State are enrolled among its members, and the records of the\r\nSociety from the beginning contain names prominent in the early history\r\nof the Republic. Social and friendly intercourse was promoted and\r\nmaintained among the natives of Ireland and their kinsmen and\r\ndescendants. Numbers of deserving, but less fortunate fellow-countrymen,\r\nwere relieved by the bounty of the Society, implements and materials for\r\ndomestic manufacture were furnished to the industrious poor. The needy\r\nwere assisted with money, medicine, clothing and fuel, the destitute\r\nwere provided with homes and, when necessary, were furnished with\r\nsufficient funds to enable them to return to their native land.\r\n\r\nThe design of the badge worn by members of the Society, and which\r\nappears on the cover of this book, is a _facsimile_ of the “reverse” of\r\nthe medal worn by the members of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1771. The following in reference to that medal is from\r\n_Haverty’s American Almanac_:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Each member was required to furnish himself with a gold medal of the\r\n  value of three guineas, agreeably to the following description: On the\r\n  right, HIBERNIA; on the left, AMERICA; in the center, LIBERTY joining\r\n  the hands of HIBERNIA and AMERICA, represented by the usual figures of\r\n  a female supported by a harp, for HIBERNIA; an Indian with his quiver\r\n  on his back and his bow slung, for AMERICA; underneath, UNITE. On the\r\n  reverse, ST. PATRICK tramping on a snake, a cross in his hand, dressed\r\n  in pontificalibus, the motto, “HIER.”\r\n\r\n  These devices, designed some years before the Revolution, were\r\n  certainly ominous, if not prophetic. The Goddess of LIBERTY joining\r\n  the hands of HIBERNIA and AMERICA, with the superscription “UNITE,”\r\n  was sufficiently significant, considering that the effect of that\r\n  union powerfully promoted the subsequent dismemberment of the British\r\n  Empire and the liberty and independence of America. The motto, HIER,\r\n  or, without the aspirate, IER, in the Celtic language signifies\r\n  “West,” and from it came the name of the country, Ere, Erin, or\r\n  Ireland, and Ierna, aspirated Hibernia. But the word HIER had in it a\r\n  duplicate and equivocal signification, peculiarly appropriate as the\r\n  motto of a society whose object was to “_Unite_” in fellowship the\r\n  sons of the _little_ isle of the “_West_” with those of the _great_\r\n  continent of the “West.” This medal the members were obliged to wear\r\n  at the meeting of the Society under the penalty of 7s. 6d. for neglect\r\n  to do so on St. Patrick’s day, and 5s. on the days of the quarterly\r\n  meetings.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Philadelphia was founded in 1771.\r\n  George Washington, adopted a member December 17, 1781, dined with the\r\n  Society on St. Patrick’s Day, 1782, and characterized it as “_a\r\n  society distinguished for the firm adherence of its members to the\r\n  glorious cause in which we are embarked_.” Other members were Generals\r\n  Moylan, Shee, Wayne, Knox, Butler, Irvine, Hand; Commodore Barry, John\r\n  Mease, who crossed the Delaware with General Washington on the\r\n  memorable night of December 25, 1776, and surprised the Hessians; and\r\n  his brother, Matthew, who commanded the quarter deck guns under Paul\r\n  Jones in the _Bonhomme Richard’s_ fight with the _Serapis_.\r\n\r\n  On June 17, 1780, twenty-seven of its members subscribed 103,500\r\n  pounds sterling to furnish provisions for the army, Robert Morris and\r\n  Blair McClenachan each subscribing 10,000 pounds. William Constable,\r\n  another member, an aid of Lafayette and partner of Robert Morris, was\r\n  one of the founders of the New York Society.—_Hood’s Friendly Sons of\r\n  St. Patrick_, 43–49 (Phila., 1844); _Crimmins’ Early Celebrations of\r\n  St. Patrick’s Day_, 215 (N. Y., 1902).\r\n\r\nThe original records of the Society from 1784 to 1835, except the\r\nTreasurer’s Book from 1804, were lost by fire in August, 1835, being at\r\nthat time in possession of the Secretary, whose place of business was\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Society has been true to the principles on which it was founded. It\r\nhas helped the needy and distressed, and has been the means of cementing\r\nlifelong friendships among its members and among those who participated\r\nin its festivities. From the Society grew the Irish Emigrant Society and\r\nthe Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank. Uniting to the charitable and\r\nhumane the friendly and social feelings, it seeks to keep ever vigorous\r\nthe love of Ireland and of the Irish character. It celebrates the\r\nfestival of St. Patrick as a national and immemorial custom, to\r\ncommemorate the glory of Ireland, to drop a tear upon her sorrows and to\r\nexpress a hope for her regeneration. It has entertained illustrious and\r\ndistinguished guests at its banquets. Among those of recent years may be\r\nmentioned President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, and president-elect\r\nWilliam H. Taft in 1908. A notable dinner was given on May 29, 1902, to\r\nthe French Governmental Mission attending the Rochambeau Monument\r\nceremonies, in acknowledgement of which the Republic of France presented\r\nto the Society a magnificent Sèvres vase, now in the Metropolitan Museum\r\nof Art.\r\n\r\nAmong the Society’s members have been many of the great merchants,\r\nbusiness and professional men of the city.

PATRICK GARVAN.\r\n\r\n  Of Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\n  A Life Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTE.\r\n\r\nMr. Lenehan is the Chairman of the Membership Committee of the American\r\nIrish Historical Society, through whose efforts and ability 250 members\r\nhave been added to the Society’s rolls between the time of his\r\nappointment in June, 1908, and January 16th, 1909, the date of the\r\neleventh annual meeting in Washington, D. C. New applications from him\r\nhave been coming in almost daily since the latter date. We look forward\r\nto at least an equal number of new members being admitted during 1909,\r\nand the Society hereby expresses the highest praise of Mr. Lenehan for\r\nhis faithful and fruitful efforts in its behalf. Under his guidance, the\r\nprinted matter which has gone forth during 1908 throughout the country\r\nhas been prepared and circulated, and in his work he is receiving the\r\ncordial support of all the members.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the midst of a busy life as a successful practising lawyer,\r\nMr. Lenehan finds time to give valuable assistance by word and deed to\r\nthese two great national societies, The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick and\r\nthe American Irish Historical Society, both of which claim him as an\r\nhonored member.\r\n\r\n                                                                 EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EARLY MARINE “WIRELESS.”\r\n\r\n                        BY EDGAR STANTON MACLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot the least valuable of the many practical lessons taught by the\r\ncruise of the Atlantic battleship fleet around the world was the\r\ndemonstration of the possibility of following from Washington almost\r\nevery day’s move of the great white ships from their departure from\r\nHampton Roads to their return, by means of wireless telegraphy and other\r\nmethods of transmitting information. It is a cardinal point in the\r\nstrategy of naval warfare to be thoroughly advised, first, of the\r\nlocation, disposition and conditions of your own ships and, second, the\r\nsame of your adversary’s.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the stupendous advances made in this most important detail\r\nmay be gained by a comparison with the “wireless” marine telegraphy of a\r\ncentury ago when, although electricity had not been harnessed to the\r\nnews bureau, ingenious methods of maintaining a “marine telegraph” were\r\noperative which, in some instances, were most surprising in their\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the War of 1812 our government planned a crushing\r\nblow at British commerce. A fleet of 100 English merchantmen from\r\nJamaica was expected to pass close to the North American coast and the\r\nmost formidable squadron we could then assemble, consisting of the\r\nfrigates _President_, _United States_ and _Congress_, with the sloop and\r\nbrig _Hornet_ and _Argus_, under the command of Captain John Rodgers,\r\nwas held in New York ready to sail. As soon as war was declared, June\r\n18, 1812, a courier set out from Washington and in three days arrived in\r\nNew York—quick work for those days, but the information now could be\r\nflashed in a few seconds.\r\n\r\nOne hour after receiving the news Rodgers got under way and on the\r\nmorning of the second day out spoke an American vessel and learned from\r\nher master that he had seen the Jamaica fleet only two days before.\r\nRodgers made sail in the direction indicated, but he was drawn away in a\r\nfutile chase after the British frigate _Belvidera_. Afterward, however,\r\nhe resumed his pursuit of the merchant fleet and on July 1 he detected\r\n“quantities of cocoanut shells and orange peels” in the water, which\r\nshowed that he was in the wake of the fleet. He followed this sea-trail\r\nseveral days and was rapidly overtaking the chase, when he lost it in\r\nthe fogs on the Newfoundland Banks.\r\n\r\nFloating bottles, pieces of wreckage, cask-heads and other ship debris\r\nwere the “clicks” of the first “marine wireless” that assisted our early\r\nmariners in discovering the whereabouts of friend or foe on the high\r\nseas. And even a marine “postoffice” was a service recognized early in\r\nthe 19th century—many years before it came into general use on land.\r\nWhen our 32-gun frigate _Essex_ was making her memorable cruise in the\r\nPacific Ocean, 1813–1814, Captain David Porter records that he stopped\r\nat Charles Island of the Galapagos in the southern Pacific Ocean to\r\nexamine the “postoffice”—a box nailed to a tree in which whalers and\r\nother craft deposited records of their cruises and intended movements.\r\n\r\nThat these ocean “postoffices” were sometimes used for “misinformation”\r\nis shown in the case of this same Captain Porter. One of these “postal\r\nstations” in the Atlantic was the penal island of Fernando de Noronha,\r\noff the extreme eastern limit of Brazil. This was a point usually\r\ntouched by vessels bound for the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn. While\r\nPorter was cruising in the south Atlantic under orders to join the\r\n_Constitution_ and _Hornet_, he hove-to off this port on December 14,\r\n1812, and sending a boat ashore learned that there was a letter there\r\naddressed to “Sir James Yeo, of the British 32-gun frigate\r\n_Southampton_.” He also learned that only the week before the English\r\n44-gun frigate “_Acasta_ and the 20-gun sloop of war _Morgiana_” had\r\nstopped at that port and had sailed for Rio de Janeiro, leaving a letter\r\naddressed to “Sir James Yeo.”\r\n\r\nBefore sailing from the United States Porter had been instructed to pose\r\nas Sir James Yeo and was to join the _Constitution_ and _Hornet_, which\r\ntwo vessels were to pass as the _Acasta_ and _Morgiana_, off Cape Frio,\r\nBrazil. This was done to deceive the enemy. When Porter learned that\r\nthere was a letter at Fernando de Noronha addressed to “Sir James Yeo,”\r\nhe at once sent a present of porter and cheese to the governor of the\r\nisland and received the coveted letter. It was found to contain the\r\nusual references of a voyage by a British commander, but some “key\r\nwords” induced Porter to hold the letter to the flame of a candle, when\r\nthe following instructions, written in sympathetic ink, became legible:\r\n“I am bound off Bahia, thence off Cape Frio, where I intend to cruise\r\nuntil the 1st of January. Go off Cape Frio, to the northward of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and keep a lookout for me. Your friend.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Porter did as ordered, but on December 29 the _Constitution_\r\ncaptured, after a hard fight, the British frigate _Java_, and soon\r\nafterward the _Hornet_ sank the English sloop of war _Peacock_. This\r\nleft the _Essex_ free to choose her own course and the result was her\r\nmemorable cruise of two years in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable instance of early marine wireless was that of\r\nthe chase after the _Constitution_ from Boston, across the Atlantic, by\r\na powerful British squadron, which, on March 10, 1815, cornered _Old\r\nIronsides_ in Port Praya, near the extreme western coast of Africa, on\r\nthe very day she entered that harbor and just seventy-six days after the\r\nhostile vessels had sailed from the blockade of the New England port.\r\n\r\nFor more than eight months British cruisers had been holding the dreaded\r\n_Constitution_—then commanded by Captain Charles Stewart—in the Hub,\r\nbut, late in December, 1814, she gave them the slip and once again was\r\nin blue water. Running down to Bermuda, where he captured the merchant\r\nship _Lord Nelson_, Stewart stood across the Atlantic to the Madeiras\r\nand then cruised for several days within sight of the Rock of Lisbon.\r\nShaping her course southward again the _Constitution_, on February 20,\r\n1815, after a brilliant fight, captured the British cruisers _Cyane_ and\r\n_Levant_ and with his two prizes entered Port Praya on the morning of\r\nMarch 10.\r\n\r\nSoon after the _Constitution_ made her escape from Boston, a terrific\r\nsnow storm, lasting several days, compelled the English blockading\r\nsquadron to take refuge in Cape Cod Bay. On December 22, while the\r\nBritish officers were making themselves as comfortable as they could in\r\nthe bitter cold, the English 18-gun brig sloop _Arab_, Captain Henry\r\nJane, arrived with the startling information that the _Constitution_ had\r\nescaped. At once there was a hurrying and scurrying for immediate\r\npursuit. Provisions, bought at an exorbitant price from the canny\r\nlandfolk, were hurried aboard and every preparation was made for a chase\r\nof indefinite length.\r\n\r\nBut in what direction were they to pursue? Absolutely nothing is\r\nrecorded in the log of the British flagship as to what course the\r\n_Constitution_ had taken. Here nautical sagacity, aided by the “wireless\r\ntelegraphy” then so remarkably in use on the high seas, came to the aid\r\nof the British senior officer of the blockading force—Sir George\r\nCollier, of the 50-gun frigate _Leander_. Sir George sagely conjectured\r\nthat the _Flying Yankee_ would most likely take a southern course so as\r\nto escape the bitterly cold winter of New England. In those days there\r\nwere no means for heating the cabins, wardroom, steerage or berth decks\r\nof ships, so a prolonged stay in the higher latitudes was a problem to\r\nbe seriously considered. Selecting the 50-gun frigate _Newcastle_,\r\nCaptain Lord George Stuart, and the 40-gun frigate _Acasta_, Captain\r\nKerr, to accompany him, Sir George, on December 24th, made sail in a\r\nblind chase southward.\r\n\r\nIt seems that on the night of December 21st the famous American\r\nprivateer, _Prince de Neuchâtel_, also escaped from Boston and made the\r\nsame course the _Constitution_ had taken. When only a day or so out she\r\nran into the same storm that drove the English blockading ships into\r\nCape Cod Bay.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 28, just as the gale was abating and only\r\nfour days after the British squadron sailed, Sir George overtook the\r\n_Prince de Neuchâtel_ and captured her; and from some of the Englishmen\r\nwho were aboard the privateer learned somewhat of the proposed itinerary\r\nof the _Constitution_. With this first direct trace of his game, the\r\nBritish commander shaped his course across the Atlantic for the coast of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nHow eager the English were to capture the _Constitution_, above all\r\nother American frigates, may be seen in the record of a sailor who was\r\nin the _Prince de Neuchâtel_ at the time. He says that after being taken\r\naboard the _Leander_ as a prisoner he noticed a large placard nailed to\r\nher mainmast, which read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 REWARD.\r\n\r\n  “A reward of One Hundred pounds sterling to the man who shall first\r\n  descry the American frigate _Constitution_, provided she can be\r\n  brought to, and a smaller reward should they not be enabled to come up\r\n  with her.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis same sailor writes: “Every one [in the _Leander_] was eager in his\r\ninquiries about this far-famed frigate and most of the men appeared\r\nanxious to fall in with her, she being a constant theme of conversation,\r\nspeculation and curiosity. There were, however, two seamen and a\r\nmarine—one of whom had had his shin sadly shattered from one of her\r\ngrape-shot—who were in the frigate _Java_ when she was captured. These I\r\nhave often heard say, in return to their shipmates’ boastings: ‘If you\r\nhad seen as much of the _Constitution_ as we have, you would give her a\r\nwide berth, for she throws her shot almighty careless, fires quick, aims\r\nlow and is, altogether, an ugly customer.’”\r\n\r\nContinuing on his trail of the much-coveted Yankee frigate, Sir George,\r\non January 4, 1815,—seven days after sailing—while off the Western\r\nIsles, received another “wireless click” when he picked up a prize brig\r\nbelonging to the American privateer _Perry_ and from her master learned\r\nthat the _Perry_ had spoken the _Constitution_ only a few days before,\r\non a course that would indicate that she was making for the coast of\r\nSpain. As a matter of fact, this powerful British squadron was at that\r\nmoment only a few hours’ sail from the _Constitution_.\r\n\r\nTouching at the port of Fayal, January 13th, 1815, Sir George’s chase\r\nafter _Old Ironsides_ nearly terminated in disaster. A record left by\r\none of the American prisoners in the _Leander_ says: “We ran in with a\r\nsouthwest wind that had freshened to a stiff breeze till coming under\r\nthe lee of the Peak of Pico, opposite to Fayal. This aided a little in\r\nbreaking the wind and the heavy swell which came rolling in from the\r\nopen sea beyond. Immediately to leeward was a rocky, perpendicular bluff\r\nof three hundred feet in height, which the sea was breaking against with\r\nthe greatest fury.\r\n\r\n“I had taken my perch upon the booms so as to have a chance of clearly\r\nseeing the working of the frigate, as well as the different objects of\r\ncuriosity within my range.... The anchor was let go and the cable spun\r\nout to its entire length with the most fearful swiftness. But when all\r\nwas out the frigate still went, stern-on, toward the bluff, as though\r\nthe anchor was yet at the cathead. When she had drifted so as to be\r\nwithout the shelter of the Peak and exposed to the wind and heavy swell,\r\nboth driving her on to inevitable destruction, unless suddenly checked\r\nin her course, none was so blind as not to see the peril, the almost\r\ninstant annihilation with which the frigate was threatened, and in a\r\ntwinkling it was known that the anchor had not taken hold, but was\r\ndragging.\r\n\r\n“What means were adopted for the safety of the ship I know not, for my\r\ncuriosity had full employment in following the old commodore [Sir George\r\nCollier] about the deck in his mad ravings. I have read and heard much\r\nof the coolness, intrepidity and readiness of the English naval officers\r\nin all sudden cases of emergency and danger; and this commodore was one\r\nof the oldest in commission and a staunch veteran in the service. He had\r\nseen long service, fought many a fight, been slashed and cut to\r\ndisfiguration—as his numerous scars plainly told—had had one of his legs\r\nbroken at three different places, at three separate periods between the\r\nhip and knee, each setting worse than the last, making his leg crooked,\r\nmore crooked, most crooked.\r\n\r\n“When he saw that the frigate was gathering sternway toward the bluff,\r\nhe raved, stormed and swore at the ship, cable, anchor, officers, men,\r\nboys, hell and the devil, clinching each oath separately by a whack of\r\nhis cane at and on everything within his reach. Now he was running\r\ntoward the wheel at the stern, then furiously driving across the deck to\r\nthe hawseholes at the bow, tacking first to larboard, then to the\r\nstarboard side of the ship; yelling at the first lieutenant for not\r\nmaking the anchor hold on, swearing at the anchor for not obeying the\r\nlieutenant, damning the cable for not being longer, the water for being\r\nso deep, the bottom for lying so low; and, at last, when he had nothing\r\nelse to crisp with his red-hot blessings, he blasted his own eyes,\r\nheart, liver and lights, winding up with a curse upon the prisoners,\r\nconveying their souls in a trice to the lower regions without benefit of\r\nclergy, for being the cause of all the disasters in store for him and\r\nhis frigate—henceforth and forever.\r\n\r\n“I was as fully sensible of the danger of our situation as any one, but\r\nI could not suppress my laughter at the antics which this hero of many\r\nwars was cutting about the decks. I have no simile nor comparison for\r\nhis movements, for, verily, there is none. It was not a\r\nhitch-and-go-ahead, nor a half-hitch and side lurch; neither was it a\r\nback-and-fill, balance-haul or a bob-and-hop, straddling slide. No more\r\nlike a cock-and-primed, tip-toe dance than a toe-and-heel,\r\nfore-and-after is like a cut-and-thrust, forward-spring, a\r\nback-staggering or blinker-wiper. It partook of the whole in about equal\r\nparts. In fact, I could liken his run with his crooked leg to nothing\r\nbut the effort of the crab to walk upright upon a slippery surface,\r\ndoggedly intent to win the wager of the half-blown terrapin, who, in the\r\nsame attitude, is being balked in his first trial at the double-shuffle\r\nby attempting it in a wig, gown and Wellingtons instead of short-cuts\r\nand pumps and going at it with sleeves rolled up as an honest one\r\nshould.\r\n\r\n“At last the second anchor brought her up, and lucky it was that it did,\r\nfor she had drifted within a few minutes’ distance of the bluff, where\r\nthe frigate would not have held together five minutes. With the\r\nfreshened winds and lashing waves throwing the spray mast-high, every\r\nsoul on board must have been lost, for the water was deep and the first\r\nthing the frigate would have struck was the perpendicular cliff—three\r\nhundred feet high and of unknown depth below.”\r\n\r\nAfter this narrow escape Sir George transferred his prisoners to the\r\nsloop of war _Pheasant_ and, after replenishing his stores, resumed his\r\nchase after the Yankee frigate. Just what course was pursued by the\r\ncommander from this point is not shown in American or British records.\r\nIt is a fact, however, that the presence of the _Constitution_ in\r\nEuropean waters was known in many ocean ports and that several British\r\ncruisers were sent out from Lisbon, Gibraltar and other nearby ports to\r\nintercept her.\r\n\r\nIt was, undoubtedly, by means of this “wireless marine telegraphy” that\r\nSir George so shaped his course, after leaving Fayal, that he arrived\r\noff Port Praya, March 10, 1815, only a few hours after the\r\n_Constitution_ with her two prizes, the _Cyane_ and _Levant_, had\r\nentered that harbor. The miraculous escape of the American frigate from\r\nSir George’s overwhelming force in the offing of Port Praya is a matter\r\nof history. It is recorded that he was so chagrined over the\r\nextraordinary escape of the _Constitution_—after he had so successfully\r\nfollowed her, by means of the first “marine wireless,” across the\r\nAtlantic—that ten years afterward, on being reminded of the incident, he\r\ncommitted suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SKETCHES OF WILLIAM DUNLAP, THOMAS P. JOHNSON AND THOMAS SHARP,\r\n       DISTINGUISHED IRISH AMERICANS DURING REVOLUTIONARY TIMES.\r\n\r\n   BY JAMES L. O’NEILL OF ELIZABETH, N. J., A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE\r\n                                COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nThe following short series of articles relate to distinguished people of\r\nour race who played prominent parts in the stirring scenes during the\r\nRevolution, and whose memoirs are full of interesting anecdotes and\r\ndescriptions of those times.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunlap, son of Samuel Dunlap, who was a native of Ireland,\r\nThomas P. Johnson, one of the prominent members of the New Jersey Bar\r\n100 years ago, and others are referred to. Mr. Dunlap himself, in his\r\nmemoirs, gives a graphic description of Revolutionary scenes in New\r\nJersey. Another of the articles is a history by Thomas Sharp, a member\r\nof the Society of Friends, of Newton, Gloucester County, N. J. The brief\r\nhistory is here quoted exactly as compiled by the ancient author, and\r\nits quaint language, with its disregard for spelling and construction,\r\nis interesting. Thatcher, a military writer of that time, gives a\r\ncharacteristic anecdote of Washington, which is here appended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  REVOLUTIONARY TIMES IN PERTH AMBOY.\r\n\r\nPerth Amboy, N. J., was the home of Governor Franklin, who was made a\r\nprisoner by the Colonials in the Revolution, and sent to Connecticut for\r\nsafe-keeping.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunlap, painter and author, was also a native of Perth Amboy,\r\nand a graphic description of “olden times” is contained in his own\r\nmemoirs in his “History of the Arts of Design.” He says:\r\n\r\n“I was born in the city of Perth Amboy and province of New Jersey. My\r\nfather, Samuel Dunlap, was a native of the north of Ireland and son of a\r\nmerchant of Londonderry. In youth he was devoted to the army and bore\r\nthe colors of the Forty-seventh Regiment, ‘Wolfe’s Own,’ on the Plains\r\nof Abraham. He was borne wounded from the field on which his commander\r\ntriumphed and died. After the French war, Dunlap, then a lieutenant in\r\nthe Forty-Seventh, and stationed at Perth Amboy, married Margaret\r\nSargent, of that place, and retired from the army to the quiet of a\r\ncountry town and country store. The 19th of February, 1766, is\r\nregistered as the date of my birth, and being an only child, the\r\nanniversary of the important day was duly celebrated by my indulgent\r\nparents. Of education I had none, in the usual sense of the word, owing\r\nto circumstances I shall mention, and much of that which is to the child\r\nmost essential was bad.\r\n\r\n“Holding negroes in slavery was, in those days, the common practice, and\r\nthe voices of those who protested against the custom were not heeded.\r\nEvery house in my native place where any servants were to be seen\r\nswarmed with black slaves. My father’s kitchen had several families of\r\nthem, of all ages and all born in the family except one, who was called\r\na new negro, and who had his face tattooed. His language was scarcely\r\nintelligible, though he had been long in the country, and was an old\r\nman. These blacks indulged me, of course, and I sought the kitchen as\r\nthe place to find playmates and amusements suited to my taste. Thus in\r\nthe mirth and games of the negroes, and the variety of visitors of the\r\nblack race who frequented the place, my desires were shaped. This may be\r\nconsidered my first school, and, indeed, such was the education of many\r\na boy in the states where the practice of slavery continued. The infant\r\nwas taught to tyrannize, the boy was taught to despise labor, the mind\r\nof the child was contaminated by hearing and seeing that which, perhaps,\r\nwas not understood at the time but which remained in the memory. These\r\nkitchen associations were increased during a part of the Revolution by\r\nsoldiers, who found their mess fare improved by visiting the negroes,\r\nand by servants of officers billeted in the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Perth Amboy being now in the possession of the British, my father\r\nreturned with his family to his home, and I saw in my native town,\r\nparticularly after the battles of Princeton and Trenton, all the\r\ndiscomforts of a crowded camp and garrison. An army which had recently\r\npassed in triumph from the sea to the banks of the Delaware, and chosen\r\nits winter quarters at pleasure, was now driven in, crowded upon a shore\r\nwashed by the Atlantic, and defended by the guns of the ships which had\r\nborne it thence.\r\n\r\n“I have elsewhere compared the scenes I now witnessed to the dramatic\r\nscenes of Wallenstein’s Lager. Here was centered in addition to the\r\nsoldiery cantoned at the place all those drawn in from the Delaware,\r\nPrinceton and Brunswick, together with the flower of the army, English,\r\nScotch, and German, which had been brought in from Rhode Island. Here\r\nwas to be seen a party of the Forty-Second Highlanders in national\r\ncostume, and there a regiment of Hessians, their dress and arms a wide\r\ncontrast to the first. The slaves of Anspach and Waldeck were there, the\r\nfirst somber as night, the second gaudy as noonday. Here dashed by a\r\nparty of the Seventeenth dragoons, and there scampered a party of\r\nYagers. The trim, neat and graceful English Grenadier, the careless and\r\nhalf-savage Highlander, with his flowing robes and naked knees, and the\r\nstiff German, could hardly be taken as members of one army. Here might\r\nbe seen soldiers driving in cattle, and others guarding wagons loaded\r\nwith household furniture instead of the hay and oats they had been sent\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n“The landing of the grenadiers and light infantry from the ships which\r\ntransported the troops from Rhode Island; their proud march into the\r\nhostile neighborhood, to gather the produce of the farmer for the\r\ngarrison; the sound of the musketry, which soon rolled back upon us; the\r\nreturn of the disabled veterans who could retrace their steps; and the\r\nheavy march of the discomfited troops, with their wagons of groaning\r\nwounded, in the evening, are all impressed on my mind as pictures of the\r\nhorrors and the soul-stirring events of war.\r\n\r\n“These scenes and others more disgusting—the flogging of English men and\r\nthumping and caning of German—which even my tender years could not\r\nprevent me from seeing all around, and the increased disorder among my\r\nfathers’ negroes, from mingling with the servants of officers, these\r\nwere my sources of instruction in the winter of 1776–1777.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES H. DEVLIN. Jr.,\r\n\r\n  Of Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n  President of the Boston Charitable Irish Society, now in its 172d\r\n    Year.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n         THOMAS P. JOHNSON, NOTED LAWYER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished men who have adorned the New Jersey bar few, in\r\ntheir day, were held in higher repute for eloquence and extensive legal\r\nknowledge, and especially for intellectual vigor and versatility of\r\ntalent, than Thomas P. Johnson.\r\n\r\nHe was born about the year 1761. His parents were Friends. His father,\r\nWilliam Johnson, a native of Ireland, emigrated to this country about\r\n1747. He married Ruth Potts, of Trenton. Thomas was their second child.\r\nWhen he was quite small the family removed to Charleston, S. C., where\r\nthe father established a flourishing boarding-school and gained much\r\nrepute by his lectures on various branches of Natural Philosophy. His\r\nfondness for such studies seemed to have been inherited by the son, who\r\neven in his later years continued to turn his attention to them. The\r\nfather died in the South, after a residence of some years there. The\r\nmother, with five children, returned to her native state, and with the\r\naid of her brother opened a store in Trenton. There Thomas was placed an\r\napprentice to a carpenter[3] and joiner. After following this business\r\nsome time he was compelled, by a rupture of a blood vessel in the lungs,\r\nto abandon it. He then engaged in teaching in Hunterdom County and\r\nafterwards in Bucks County, Pa.—later then in Philadelphia. For this\r\nprofession he had rare qualifications. Few men had such powers of\r\ncommunication; few could so simplify truth, and throw an interest around\r\nit to captivate the youthful mind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The annexed anecdote was communicated to the compiler by a resident of\r\n  Trenton: At one of the neighboring courts a dispute arose between\r\n  Johnson and his opponent respecting a point of law, during which the\r\n  latter remarked in a taunting, derisive manner, “That he was not to be\r\n  taught law by a carpenter.” “May it please your honors,” replied Mr.\r\n  Johnson, “the gentleman has been pleased to allude to my having been a\r\n  carpenter. True, I was a carpenter. I am proud of it. So was our Lord\r\n  and Saviour. And I could yet, given a block of wood, a mallet and a\r\n  chisel, hew something that would very much resemble that gentleman’s\r\n  head. True, I could not put in brains, but it would have more\r\n  manners.”\r\n\r\nWhile in Philadelphia a mercantile house took him in partnership, and\r\nsent him to Richmond, Va., where the firm opened a large store. There he\r\nbecame well acquainted with Chief Justice Marshall, and often had the\r\nprivilege of listening to the first lawyers in the Old Dominion. This\r\nprobably led to his turning his thoughts to the bar. After a few years\r\nthe loss of his store and goods by fire caused him to return to the\r\nscenes of his youthful days. He took up his residence at Princeton,\r\nthere married a daughter of Robert Stockton, and entered his name as a\r\nstudent of law in the office of the Hon. Richard Stockton. In due time\r\nhe was admitted to the bar as an attorney and counselor. His career was\r\nbrilliant. Whether arguing points of law, or spreading a case before a\r\njury, he was always heard with fixed attention and lively interest. So\r\nlucid was he in arranging and expressing his thoughts, so quick to seize\r\nhold of strong points in a case, and, when he pleased, so well able to\r\ntouch the chords of feeling, that he rarely failed to produce an\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nHe was no indifferent student of the great political questions. With the\r\nmajority of the New Jersey bar, he belonged to the Washington school,\r\nand exerted all his energies in what he honestly conceived to be his\r\ncountry’s real interests. For his brethren of the New Jersey bar he\r\ncherished a warm attachment, and they were forward in evincing their\r\nhigh esteem of his worth. A few years before his death a number of them\r\nobtained the services of an artist and had a full-length portrait of him\r\nexecuted. This now hangs over the judge’s chair in the court-room at\r\nFlemington. He died March 12, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n              HISTORY OF NEWTON, GLOUCESTER COUNTY, N. J.\r\n\r\nNewton, Gloucester County, N. J., was early settled by the society of\r\nFriends. The following history was written by Thomas Sharp, the first\r\nconveyancer and surveyor of the county:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Let it be remembered. It having wrought upon ye minds of some,\r\n  Friends that dwelt in Ireland, a pressure having laid upon them for\r\n  some years which they could not get from under the weight of until\r\n  they gave upp to leave their friends and relations there, together\r\n  with a comfortable subsistence to transport themselves and familys\r\n  into this wilderness part of America, and there by expose themselves\r\n  to difficulties, which, if they could have been easy where they were,\r\n  in all probability might never have been met with; and in order\r\n  thereunto, sent from Dublin in Ireland to one Thomas Lurtin a friend\r\n  in London commander of a Pink, who accordingly came, and made an\r\n  agreement with him to transport them and their familys into New\r\n  Jersey, viz.; Mark Newby and family. Thomas Thackarg and family,\r\n  William Bate and family, George Goldsmith an old man, and Thomas\r\n  Sharp, a young man, but no familys; and whilst the ship abode in\r\n  Dublin harbor providing for the voyage, said Thomas Lurtin was taken\r\n  so ill that could not perform ye same, so that his mate, John Dagger,\r\n  undertook it. And upon the 19 day of September, in the year of our\r\n  Lord, 1681, we sett sail, from the place aforesaid, and through the\r\n  good Providence of God towards us we arrived at Elsinburg, in the\r\n  country of Salem, upon the 19 day of November following, where we were\r\n  well entertained at the houses of the Thomsons, who came from Ireland\r\n  about four years before, who, by their industry, were arrived to a\r\n  very good degree of living, and from thence we went to Salem, where\r\n  were several houses yet were vacant of persons who had left the town\r\n  to settle in ye country, which serve to accommodate them for ye\r\n  winter, proving moderate, we at Wickacog, among us, purchased a boat\r\n  of the Swansons, and so went to Burlington to the commissioners, of\r\n  whom we obtained a warrant of ye surveyor general, which then was\r\n  Daniel Leeds; and after some considerable search to and fro in that\r\n  then was called the third or Irish tenth, we at last pitched upon the\r\n  place now called Newton, which was before the settlement of Phila; Pa;\r\n  and then applied to S,d Surveyor, who came and laid it out for us; and\r\n  the next Spring, being the beginning of the year 1682 we all removed\r\n  from Salem together with Robert Lane, that had been settled there, who\r\n  came along from Ireland with the Thomsons before hinted, and having\r\n  expectation of our coming only bought a lot in Salemtown, upon the\r\n  which he seated himself until our coming, whose proprietary right and\r\n  ours being of the same nature, could not then take it up in Fenwicks\r\n  tenth, and so began our settlement; and although we were at times\r\n  pretty hard bestead, having all our provisions as far as Salem to\r\n  fetch by water, yet, through the mercy and kindness of God, we were\r\n  preserved in health and from any extreme difficulties.\r\n\r\n  “And immediately there was a meeting sett upp and kept at the house of\r\n  Mark Newby, and in a short time it grew and increased, unto which\r\n  William Cooper and family, that lived at the Poynte resorted, and\r\n  sometimes the meeting was kept at his house, who had been settled\r\n  sometime before. Zeal and fervency of spirit was what, in some degree,\r\n  at that time abounded among friends, in commemoration of our\r\n  prosperous success and eminent preservation, both in our coming over\r\n  the great deep as also that whereas we were but few at that time, and\r\n  the Indians many, where by it put a dread upon our spirits,\r\n  considering they were a savage people; but ye Lord, that hath the\r\n  hearts of all in his hands, which cannot be otherwise accounted but to\r\n  be the Lord doings in our favor, which we had cause to praise his name\r\n  for.\r\n\r\n  “And that the rising generation may consider that the Settlement of\r\n  the country was directed by an impulse upon tranquility, but rather\r\n  for the posterity yet should be after, and that the wilderness being\r\n  planted with a good seed, might grow and increase to the satisfaction\r\n  of the good husbandman. But instead thereof, if for wheat it should\r\n  bring forth tares, they themselves will suffer loss.\r\n\r\n  “This narration I have thought good and requisite to leave behind, as\r\n  having had knowledge of things from the beginning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ANECDOTE OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThatcher, in his Military Journal, gives a vivid description of the\r\nsufferings of the troops during “the hard winter of 1779–1780,” at\r\nMorristown, N. J. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Morristown, January 1st, 1780. A new year commences, but brings no\r\n  relief to the sufferings and privations of our army. Our canvass\r\n  covering affords but a miserable security from storms of rain and\r\n  snow, and a great scarcity of provisions still prevails, its effects\r\n  being felt even at headquarters, as appears by the following anecdote:\r\n  ‘We have nothing but the rations to cook, Sir,’ said _Mrs. Thomson_, a\r\n  very worthy _Irish woman_, and _housekeeper_ to _General Washington_.\r\n  ‘Well, Mrs. Thomson, you must then cook the rations, for I have not a\r\n  farthing to give you.’ ‘If you please, Sir, let one of the gentlemen\r\n  give me an order for six bushels of salt.’ ‘Six bushels of salt for\r\n  what?’ ‘To preserve the fresh beef, Sir.’ One of the aids gave the\r\n  order and the next day his Excellency’s table was amply provided. Mrs.\r\n  Thomson was sent for, and told that she had done very wrong to expend\r\n  her own money, for it was not known when she could be repaid. ‘I owe\r\n  you,’ said his Excellency, ‘too much already to permit the debt being\r\n  increased, and our situation is not at this moment such as to induce\r\n  sanguine hope.’ ‘Dear Sir,’ said the good old lady, ‘it is always\r\n  darkest just before the daylight, and I hope your Excellency will\r\n  forgive me for bartering the salt for other necessaries which are now\r\n  on the table.’ Salt was eight dollars a bushel, and it might always be\r\n  exchanged with the country people for articles of provision.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON.

SOME POINTED COMMENTS ON THE\r\nMANNER OF TAKING SAME AND THE RESULTS THEREOF. AN INTERESTING PAPER ON A\r\n             SUBJECT NOT HERETOFORE TOUCHED BY THE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n  BY MICHAEL J. O’BRIEN OF NEW YORK CITY, AUTHOR OF “A GLANCE AT SOME\r\n PIONEER IRISH IN THE SOUTH,” IN VOLUME VII OF THE JOURNAL, AND OF MANY\r\n                  OTHER WORKS OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy an Act of Congress, entitled “An act providing for the enumeration of\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States,” and which was signed by President\r\nWashington on March 1, 1790, the marshals of the judicial districts\r\nthroughout the United States were “authorized and required to cause the\r\nnumber of the inhabitants within their respective districts to be taken,\r\nomitting in such enumeration Indians not taxed, and distinguishing free\r\npersons, including those bound to service for a term of years, from all\r\nothers.” These returns they were instructed to file with the clerks of\r\ntheir respective District Courts, who were directed to carefully\r\npreserve them.\r\n\r\nThis was the FIRST CENSUS taken of the inhabitants of the United States,\r\nbut it was far from complete, for the reason that “heads of families”\r\nonly were recorded.\r\n\r\nEighteen months were allowed in which to complete the enumeration. The\r\ncensus-taking was supervised by the marshals of the several judicial\r\ndistricts, who employed assistant marshals to act as enumerators.\r\n\r\nWhen the schedules were all gathered in, they were turned over to the\r\nPresident, who, on October 27, 1791, transmitted to Congress a summary\r\nof the result, which was published in what is now a very rare little\r\nvolume that has not been reprinted for public use. The original\r\nschedules are contained in 26 bound volumes and are still preserved in\r\nthe Census Office. They form a curious and most interesting collection,\r\nwritten as they were by the assistant marshals, “on such paper as they\r\nhappened to have, and binding the sheets together. In some cases printed\r\nblanks furnished by the States were used, in others merchants’ account\r\npaper, and now and then the schedules were bound in wall paper.”\r\n\r\nA complete set of schedules for each State, with a summary for the\r\nCounties, and in many cases for towns, was filed in the State\r\nDepartment, but, unfortunately, they are not now complete, “the returns\r\nfor the States of Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, Tennessee and\r\nVirginia having been destroyed when the British burned the Capitol at\r\nWashington during the War of 1812.”\r\n\r\nIn 1907, Congress authorized the Director of the Census to publish, in a\r\npermanent form, the First Census of the United States. “These\r\nschedules,” says the Director of the Census, “form a unique inheritance\r\nfor the nation, since they represent for each of the States a complete\r\nlist of the heads of families in the United States at the time of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution. The framers were the statesmen and leaders\r\nof thought, but those whose names appear upon the schedules of the First\r\nCensus were in general the plain citizens, who, by their conduct in war\r\nand peace, made the Constitution possible, and by their intelligence and\r\nself-restraint put it into successful operation.”\r\n\r\nThe First Census has a peculiar interest for Americans of Irish blood or\r\ndescent, for here we find irrefutable evidence of the racial origin of a\r\nlarge part of the people of the United States a few years after the\r\nclose of the Revolutionary war. There is, of course, no standard, or\r\nfixed rule or principle, by which an absolutely correct judgment on the\r\nquestion of the racial composition of the early inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States can now be formed. The available statistics on the subject\r\nare incomplete and confusing.\r\n\r\nBut, if names are to be accepted as a criterion, those who examine the\r\nCensus Returns, in conjunction with the records of land grants, the\r\nparochial registers, the Colonial Records that have been collected and\r\nedited by the secretaries of state, the court and church records, the\r\nRevolutionary rosters, the old newspapers, the Registers of Historical\r\nAssociations, and other similarly reliable records, must at once\r\nconclude that a goodly percentage of the people were of old Irish stock.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind also that the Census enumerators made no\r\nreturns of unmarried persons. This fact is important, when we place\r\nbeside it the statements of reliable historians that the Irish exodus of\r\nthe 18th century largely comprised the youth of the country. From the\r\nrecords which we have already quoted, we know that thousands of the\r\nIrish youth became indentured servants after their arrival in the\r\nColonies, and it is not likely that these people, even though married\r\nwhile still in servitude, were considered of sufficient importance by\r\nthe census enumerators to be included in the lists of the “heads of\r\nfamilies.”\r\n\r\nOne who examines these records for traces of the Irish settlers will be\r\nsurprised to find a most inviting field of retrospect and research ever\r\nwidening before him. We do not need to wander into the field of romance,\r\nas some writers occasionally do, in search of proof that at the\r\nbeginnings of the Nation the Celtic element figured to a larger extent\r\nthan it has been credited with at the hands of our historians.\r\n\r\nThere is so much of dry fact concerning them in these hitherto obscure\r\nrecords as to make it a perplexing thought for the investigator where to\r\nbegin upon an exposition of the part played by the Irish Colonists and\r\ntheir descendants in shaping the destinies of the future Republic.\r\nTheirs is generally a prosaic story of trials bravely borne, of\r\nvictories snatched from rude nature in the face of many difficulties.\r\nThe pioneer settlers lived a simple but rude life on the frontiers of\r\ncivilization, free from the artificialities of our latter-day mode of\r\nliving, but they made the wilderness which they found to blossom as the\r\nrose and to become a fair habitation for the generations that have\r\nsucceeded them.\r\n\r\nTheir story would hardly be worth relating were it not for the fact that\r\nit affords the proof that men and women of our race and blood were of\r\nthe “warp and woof” from which has been evolved the new and composite\r\nrace, miscalled “Anglo-Saxon,” which has made this Western Hemisphere\r\nthe leader among the nations of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Census of the Southern States that Irish names appear in\r\nthe greatest numbers. During the first half of the 18th century there\r\nwere large immigrations of Irish people to the Carolinas, who spread\r\nthemselves over an immense area, reaching from the Santee river to the\r\neastern boundary line of Georgia, and as far north as the dividing line\r\nof North Carolina. Doubtless, the majority of those on the Census\r\nReturns bearing Irish names were descendants of those early settlers,\r\nrather than natives of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe historian Lossing says: “Between the years 1730 and 1740 an Irish\r\nsettlement was planted near the Santee river in South Carolina, to which\r\nwas given the name of Williamsburg Township. Up the Pedee, Santee,\r\nEdisto, Savannah and Black rivers settlements spread rapidly, and soon\r\nthe axe and the plough were plying with mighty energy, and from the\r\nNorth of Ireland such numbers departed for Carolina that the\r\ndepopulation of whole districts was threatened.”\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg he calls a “hotbed of rebellion” during the Revolutionary\r\nwar. As soon as General Francis Marion received his commission from\r\nGovernor Rutledge, we are told, “he sped to the district of Williamsburg\r\nbetween the Santee and Pedee to lead its rising patriots to the field of\r\nactive military duties.” (The rosters of General Marion’s brigade\r\ncontain a large number of Irish names.)\r\n\r\nRamsay also refers to these Irish settlements and deals with them at\r\nlength in his History of South Carolina. He says that the district was\r\nnamed Williamsburg by an Irishman named James, who came to the Colony\r\nwith his father in 1733. It is now called Kingstree, and the county in\r\nwhich it is situated is still named Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nSims’ _Life of General Marion_ says: “the people of Williamsburg were\r\nsprung generally from Irish parentage. They inherited in common with all\r\nthe descendants of the Irish in America a hearty detestation of the\r\nEnglish name and authority. This feeling rendered them excellent\r\npatriots and daring soldiers wherever the British lion was the object of\r\nhostility.”\r\n\r\nOther local historians of the South also refer to the Irish settlements\r\nin this territory, which continued with but intermittent intervals down\r\nto the closing years of the 18th century. When we turn to the Census\r\nschedules we find that the statements of the historians are amply\r\ncorroborated.\r\n\r\nIn the Williamsburg district, that “hotbed of rebellion,” we find\r\nmention of such Irish families as Burke, Barrett, Biggen, Butler,\r\nBarron, Bryan, Broaderick, Boland, Brady, Bradley, Cain, Cummins,\r\nConnor, Cunningham, Collins, Conway, Callihan, Cronan, Cantey, Corbett,\r\nConnell, Castlelaw, Creed, Conally, Cochran, Dunn, Dempsey, Dawson,\r\nDollard, Downing, Donoho, Donnally, Delaney, Dillin, Dailey, Dulon,\r\nDogharty, Earley, Flin, Foley, Fitzpatrick, Faning, Gorman, Galaspy,\r\nGibbons, Gallivant, Ganey, Gowen, Gavin, Gallaher, Gill, Garven, Hagan,\r\nHart, Harrington, Hayes, Hainey, Joice, Jordan, Kennedy, Keenan, Kelly,\r\nKelty, Keen, Keefe, Kerns, Kailey, Lynch, Leysath, Murphy, McCalvey,\r\nMcCartney, McGill, McFarlin, Manning, McCormic, McKenny, McDowell,\r\nMcKee, McGinney, McCauley, McBride, McMullan, Mulhollen, Mitchel,\r\nMcConnell, McClare, McIlveen, McGee, McFadden, Moore, McCottery,\r\nMcElroy, McMelly, McCleary, McDaniel, McDonald, McCarthy, McCall,\r\nMcSwain, McWilliams, Morrison, McGraw, McCausland, McCune, McElhaney,\r\nMcFail, McClendon, McGrath, McElduff, McAdams, McCoy, McCary, McCain,\r\nMahon, O’Brian, O’Neil, O’Cain, O’Bannon, Phelon, Powers, Quinn, Rogers,\r\nRoach, Riley, Reidy, Rial, Ryan, Sullivan, Shealds, Swiney, Steele,\r\nShannon, Timmons, Toole, Ward and Walsh.\r\n\r\nThese are not all. Of the Murphys alone there were in the Williamsburg\r\ndistrict eleven families, nine Kellys and several distinct families\r\nnamed O’Brian, O’Neil, O’Bannon and McCarty.\r\n\r\nWe have selected only one of each name, in order to show that the Irish\r\nsettlements spoken of by Lossing, Sims and Ramsay were drawn from the\r\nSouth, East and West, as well as from the North of Ireland. American\r\nhistorians are in the habit of saying that the immigrants from Ireland\r\nwere mainly the so-called “Scotch-Irish” element from the northern\r\ncounties. While it is true there were large settlements of Scotch Gaels\r\nin the Carolinas, it is seen from the foregoing list that nearly every\r\ncounty of Celtic Ireland was represented in the “hotbed of rebellion” of\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nWe see from the Census Returns that the collectors wrote down the names\r\nphonetically in most cases, having paid little or no attention to\r\nspelling, or the use of capital letters where they were needed. Some\r\npeculiar transformations in names resulted from the carelessness or\r\nignorance of the enumerators. For instance, we find O’Neill spelled\r\n“onailes” and “Ownaile”; O’Brien spelled “Obrient” and “Obriant”;\r\nO’Farrell as “Opherl,” and Casey as “Caycey”; Donovan is down as\r\n“Dunnevant” and “Dunnaphant”; Doherty as “Dehoitey” and “Dohoty”; Nolan\r\nas “noling”; Sullivan as “Sellivent,” “Swillevaun” and “Sewlovan”;\r\nMurphy as “Murff,” “Murph,” “Murpry” and “Murfree”; Gallagher as\r\n“Gollerhorn”; Flynn as “Phlyn” and “Fling”; Kinsella as “Kincheloe”;\r\nMcLaughlin as “Maklafflin”; O’Hara as “Oharroe”; and O’Ryan as “Orion.”\r\n\r\nTo the prefix “Mac” the enumerators, in many cases, gave the sound of\r\n“Mag.” Thus we have such name transformations as “Magnamee” and\r\n“Magmanous.” We also find “Makmain” for McMahon and “Muckleroy” for\r\nMcElroy, and so on. Fitzgeralds are down as “Fitzjarrel” and “Jarrel”;\r\nFitzpatrick as “Fitchparterack” and “Pitch Patrick”; Reilly as “Royley”\r\nand “Royalley”; Cassidy as “Casaty.” In some Southern city directories\r\nwe have come across the name of “Pitch,” and we wonder if some of these\r\nare not descendants of the “Pitch Patricks” or Fitzpatricks!\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to think of an old Irish name that is not\r\nrepresented in the First Census, and which was not, at some time or\r\nother, translated into something very different in appearance, and\r\nsometimes only partially retaining the sound of the original name. In\r\nthe mutations of time, even these new names became still further\r\nchanged, so that many of the present-day descendants of the Irish\r\npioneers of the Carolinas cannot be recognized as at all of the old\r\nGaelic race.\r\n\r\nThe most numerous Irish name on the First Census of South Carolina is\r\nMurphy, there having been 50 distinct families of that name, although\r\nthe 48 Kelly families gave them a close race. The Gill and McGill\r\nfamilies run nip and tuck with the O’Neills and the Nealls. There were\r\n34 of the former to 33 of the latter. The O’Briens and O’Bryans ran the\r\ngauntlet of many changes. The Census enumerators failed to appreciate\r\nthe significance of the regal prefix “O,” so they wrote down the name\r\nObrient, Obriant, Bryan and Briant. There were 53 of these in South\r\nCarolina in 1790.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. ALEXANDER C. EUSTACE.\r\n\r\n  Elmira, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  Ex-President New York Civil Service Commission.\r\n\r\n  A worthy Member from New York State.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Celtic “Macs” make a great showing. There are upwards of one\r\nthousand of such families in all, the “Macs” that are indigenous to\r\nIreland being more numerous than those that are supposed to be\r\nexclusively native to Scotland. When we consider that, in 1790, the\r\ntotal number of free white males of 16 years and upwards in South\r\nCarolina was only 35,756, we can readily understand that one thousand\r\nheads of families, with their wives and children, must have constituted\r\na large percentage of the total population. An examination of the Census\r\nReturns indicates that the average number of children to each of the\r\nIrish-named families was five, so that, on a conservative estimate, the\r\n“Macs” alone must have contributed nearly 20 per cent to the population\r\nof South Carolina!\r\n\r\nWe find 40 Ward families, 26 McClure families, 26 McDaniels, 23 McKees,\r\n22 McCoys, 20 McDowells, 19 Cauleys and McCauleys, 19 Mahons and\r\nMcMahons, 18 McCalls, 17 McBrides, 17 McConnells, 16 McCarts and\r\nMcCartys, 12 McNeills, 11 McFaddens, and 10 McMullan families. There are\r\nalso numbers of McCormacks, McGees, McGowens, McGraws, McGuires,\r\nMcCrackens, McCanns, McCartneys, McCarys, McClearys, McClendons,\r\nMcCollums, McElroys, McKennys, McKelveys, McLaughlins, McManus, and many\r\nother similar Irish family names.\r\n\r\nThere are 41 distinct families of Bradleys recorded, 29 Harts, 24\r\nSullivans, 28 Reynolds, 22 Canes and Kains, 22 Hayeses, 22 Hendricks, 21\r\nDunns, 23 Connors and O’Connors, 21 Carrolls, 20 Logans, 20 Reillys and\r\nRoyleys, 17 Dawsons, 14 Gilmores, 16 Manions and Mannings, 12 Hagans, 13\r\nWalshes and Welches, 13 Higginses, and 11 Lynch and Linch families.\r\n\r\nAmong names that are common to Ireland and England, there are 113\r\nfamilies named Moore in the First Census of South Carolina, 80 Rogers\r\nand Rodgers, 24 Morrows, 46 Collinses, 42 Butlers and 41 Fords. There\r\nare 43 heads of families named Mitchell, 41 Montgomery, 26 McDonald, 26\r\nCunningham, 18 Gillespie, 17 Cochran and 22 Kennedy families, some of\r\nwhom, no doubt, were Scotch.\r\n\r\nSuch names as Brady, Burke, Casey, Connelly, Corbett, Cassidy, Callahan,\r\nCleary, Cummings, Curry, Daly, Doherty, Donnelly, Dempsey, Dowling,\r\nDuggan, Doyle, Donovan, Ennis, Fitzgerald, Fogarty, Fitzpatrick, Flinn,\r\nGarrett, Garvin, Gorman, Hogan, Jordan, Kearns, Lyons, Malone, Mulligan,\r\nMadden, Morrison, Nolan, O’Bannon, Quinn, Regan, Roach, Ryan, Rutledge,\r\nShannon and Shiels, as well as others of ancient Irish origin, occur\r\nquite frequently in the Census Returns, and in all parts of the state.\r\nIndeed, we might say, with startling frequency, if they are examined by\r\nthat set of persons who are so fond of telling us that the American\r\npeople are of Anglo-Saxon origin!\r\n\r\nBesides the old Irish clan names, it is seen that a very large number of\r\nthe early inhabitants of South Carolina bore names that have been common\r\nin Ireland for centuries, although not all of Irish origin. There are\r\nmany Browns, Grays, Greens, Whites, Griffins, Grimeses, Rices, Savages,\r\nSteeles, Glovers, Raineys, Rays, Flemings, Staffords, Shaws, Gastons,\r\nParnells, Mileses, Reeds, Fergusons, Coxs, Courtneys, Clarks, Carrs,\r\nKerrs, Allens, Pattersons, Berrys, Hails, Henrys, Morrises, Martins,\r\nLowrys, Hollands, Morrows, Jacksons, Laceys, Masseys and Leonards.\r\n\r\nThat some of these people were Irish seems beyond doubt, particularly\r\nwhen we find such distinctive Irish Christian names as Darby, Malachi,\r\nPatrick, Brian, Cormac, Connor and the like. And when we see O’Bryan\r\nSmiths, Patrick Smiths, and Michael and Jeremiah Smiths, and other\r\nsimilar name combinations, we can safely assume that in the majority of\r\ncases they were of Irish origin or birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 MEMORIAL TO JERSEY PRISON SHIP HEROES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince many prominent Irish Americans played an important part in the\r\nsuccess of the project for a fitting memorial to the heroes of the\r\nBritish prison-ships of the Revolution, it is fit that reference be made\r\nhere to this noble tribute and the manner of its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent monument, costing in the neighborhood of $200,000, was\r\ndedicated at Fort Greene Park, Borough of Brooklyn, New York, on\r\nNovember 14, 1908, in the presence of one of the most distinguished and\r\nrepresentative gatherings which ever honored a like occasion in this\r\ncountry. Addresses were made by President-elect Taft, by Governor Hughes\r\nof New York, Secretary Luke E. Wright of the Navy, and by other\r\ndistinguished men, including Patrick F. McGowan, Chairman of the Board\r\nof Aldermen of the City of New York, and Daniel F. Cohalan, Grand Sachem\r\nof the Tammany Society of New York, an organization which did much\r\ntoward the success of the project and which contributed a substantial\r\namount.\r\n\r\nThe monument itself is one of the finest memorials in the world. It\r\nstands in the center of a broad plaza, reached by three flights of 34\r\nsteps each, 100 feet in width. The height from the bottom of the plaza\r\nto the top of the monument is nearly 200 feet. The top is accessible and\r\nis reached by an electric elevator. The monument is constructed of white\r\ngranite from New York state, and the steps from granite quarried at\r\nStonington, Penobscot Bay, Maine. The architects were McKim, Mead and\r\nWhite, and the work is said to have been the last of an extensive nature\r\nby the late Stanford White.\r\n\r\nThe funds for the erection of this noteworthy tribute were obtained\r\nthrough a government appropriation of half the amount, a state\r\nappropriation of $25,000, an appropriation by the city of twice that\r\namount, and the rest through subscriptions from societies and historical\r\nand patriotic organizations. The Tammany Society contributed the final\r\n$1,000 to complete the required amount. This well-known organization was\r\nthe very first to secure a proper recognition of the courage and\r\npatriotism of the prison ship martyrs more than one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nAmong the heroes of the British prison-ships were many of Irish birth or\r\nextraction, and it is therefore a subject for pride and satisfaction to\r\nus as a race that their valor has at last been recognized, and\r\nespecially that an organization largely controlled by our people has\r\nplayed so important a part in the accomplishment of such recognition.\r\nNever in the history of the world have prisoners of war been made the\r\nvictims of such unexampled cruelties as those practised on the Americans\r\nby the British in the Revolution, and it is a striking and\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten commentary on British methods toward their enemies\r\nin war that the record of the prison-ships of the Revolution is deemed\r\nby all the world a black mark on English history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE IRISH IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.\r\n\r\n  SHORT ADDRESS DELIVERED BY MASTER KARL EGAN, AT THE IOWA OPERA HOUSE,\r\n    EMMETSBURG, IOWA, MARCH 17, 1909, DURING THE PRESENTATION OF THE\r\n    IRISH DRAMA, “THE HERO OF WICKLOW,” UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE\r\n    ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS. SOME FACTS OF INTEREST TO THE PEOPLE OF\r\n    IRISH BIRTH OR ANCESTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies and Gentlemen_: On this important anniversary, which is\r\nassociated with so many achievements of interest to the people of our\r\nrace, it is fitting to enquire what part the Irish took in the\r\nRevolutionary War. What did they do for the cause of human liberty at\r\nthis most critical time in the world’s history? All we ask is the truth.\r\nFor some reason our ordinary school histories have never given us any\r\ncredit for the prominent part our ancestors took in that great struggle.\r\nWhat I shall say will bear the closest historical investigation.\r\n\r\nIt was Patrick Henry, who, by his soul-stirring speech, aroused the\r\nmembers of the Virginia Assembly to a sense of patriotic duty. In 1776\r\nhe ran for governor on the Independence ticket and carried that\r\nimportant colony for the Revolutionary cause. Still, he claimed that\r\nJohn Rutledge of South Carolina was the greatest American orator of his\r\ntime. The latter was also elected president of South Carolina in 1776,\r\non the same ticket. John Rutledge and Patrick Henry were both sons of\r\nIrishmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. WILLIAM J. FEELEY.\r\n\r\n  Of Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n  One of the Committee in charge of the Sullivan Memorial and under\r\n    whose guidance the Memorial was designed and executed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War men of Irish birth or ancestry served as\r\ngovernors in South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nNew Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. They were among\r\nthe most ardent and fearless of the patriots of that history-making\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt was in John Duggan’s tavern in Boston that the Boston Tea Party was\r\nplanned. Several Irishmen were in the execution of the plan.\r\n\r\nEleven of the fifty-four members of the first Continental Congress were\r\nIrishmen and sons of Irishmen. Thomas Johnson, who nominated George\r\nWashington for commander-in-chief of the American forces, was a Celt of\r\nthe old school.\r\n\r\nThe war began April, 1775, but it was not officially declared until July\r\n4, 1776. October 15, 1775, Congress sent a committee to interview\r\nGeneral Washington and to decide as to the advisability of continuing\r\nthe struggle. Of the five who participated in that most important\r\nconference, Joseph Reed and Thomas Lynch were Irish. The other members\r\nwere Benjamin Franklin, Colonel Harrison and General Washington.\r\n\r\nA rough draft of the Declaration of Independence was prepared by Thomas\r\nJefferson. It was re-written and carefully revised by Charles Thompson,\r\nwho was styled the Samuel Adams of Philadelphia, and the life of the\r\ncause of liberty. When the Declaration was first proclaimed, it was\r\nsigned by John Hancock, as president of the Continental Congress, and by\r\nCharles Thompson, as secretary. The other names were attached later.\r\nThompson was an Irishman and Hancock an Irish American. John Nixon first\r\npublicly read it and Thos. Dunlap first printed it and published it to\r\nthe world. Both were Celtic to the backbone. Who periled most in signing\r\nthe immortal document? History answers, Charles Carroll of Carrollton,\r\nanother Irish American.\r\n\r\nWho fought the hardest in the British House of Parliament for the rights\r\nof American colonists? Edmond Bourk, an Irishman, and one of the\r\ngreatest statesmen the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nIn placing his most important officers, General Washington had Morgan\r\nand Hand leading his rifles, Knox at the head of his artillery, John\r\nDunlap as his life guard, Edward Hand as his adjutant-general, Andrew\r\nLewis as his brigadier-general, Stephen Moylan and John Fitzgerald as\r\nhis aids, and Ephraim Blaine as his quartermaster. All were Irish by\r\nbirth or ancestry. When Washington was retreating through New Jersey, he\r\nsent word to Thomas Johnson, a Maryland Celt, that he had not enough men\r\nto fight the British and too few to run away with. Johnson raised a\r\nforce of 1,800 men and hurried to his assistance.\r\n\r\nAll students of American history have read of the gallant Richard\r\nMontgomery, Mad Anthony Wayne, John Sullivan, Daniel Morgan, Stephen\r\nMoylan, John Fitzgerald, Henry Knox, Wm. Irvine, Richard Butler, and\r\nGenerals Cochran, Campbell, McDowell, McCall, McClary, Jasper, Graham,\r\nHazelett, Colonel Pickens, and many others who were among the most\r\nvaliant and successful officers in that eventful conflict. All belonged\r\nto our liberty-loving, heroic race. It has been officially ascertained\r\nthat out of 131 of the most prominent officers in the war for American\r\nIndependence, 20 were of English ancestry, 25 of French, 10 of German\r\nand Dutch, 8 of Scotch, 2 of Polish, and 84 of Irish and Welch.\r\nCommodores Barry, Perry, McDonough and Stewart, of the wars of 1776 and\r\n1812, were scions of brave-hearted exiles from the Emerald Isle.\r\n\r\nJune 16, 1779, Joseph Galloway, speaker of the Pennsylvania House of\r\nRepresentatives, who had to fly to England because of his sympathy with\r\nthe Tories, was examined as a witness by a committee of the British\r\nHouse of Parliament, and he testified that the Irish constituted\r\none-half of the American army, the native Americans one-fourth and that\r\nthe other one-fourth were English and Scotch. This statement is\r\ncorroborated by Lecky, the English historian, Lord Mountjoy, General\r\nLee, Count Rochambeau, Col. J. C. Custis, the adopted son of General\r\nWashington, and Rev. P. Allison, the Presbyterian chaplain of\r\nWashington’s army. They are competent authorities. President Roosevelt\r\nand James G. Blaine, in public addresses, have acknowledged, in\r\nsubstance, the accuracy of this testimony. Hutchinson, the last royal\r\ngovernor of Massachusetts, declared that his colony would never have\r\nvoted for independence, had it not been for the rebellious Irish.\r\n\r\nThere were 15 Irish in the battle of Lexington and 258 at Bunker Hill.\r\nThe monument at Bunker Hill is covered with Irish names. Captain Parker,\r\nwho commanded at Lexington, and who was killed, was Irish. Colonels\r\nBarrett, Smith and Davis, who commanded at Concord, were also Irish.\r\nWhen the American forces took possession of Boston, John Sullivan was\r\nofficer of the day and the countersign was “St. Patrick.”\r\n\r\nAfter the treason of Benedict Arnold, General Washington ordered that\r\nnone but the Irish be placed on guard at West Point.\r\n\r\nWhen the soldiers of Lafayette were half naked and starving, the Irish\r\npeople of Baltimore, then a place of only one hundred homes, gave them\r\nfood and clothing. In 1780, when the finances of the struggling republic\r\nwere at the lowest ebb, when it took from $30 to $50 in paper to make $1\r\nin specie, after our soldiers had suffered at Valley Forge and\r\nelsewhere, the business men of Philadelphia raised 315,000 lbs. sterling\r\nand gave it to Congress. Twenty-seven Irishmen of that city contributed\r\n103,500 pounds of that amount. They were members of the Friendly Sons of\r\nSt. Patrick, which gave 399 officers of the highest rank to the city,\r\nstate and nation during its early history. Washington became an honorary\r\nmember of that patriotic organization.\r\n\r\nWhen our country so badly needed assistance, Bishop Carroll accompanied\r\nBenjamin Franklin to France to seek the aid of that country. It was\r\nsecured. History gives Franklin the credit, but does not mention the\r\nname of Bishop Carroll, who really made the mission a successful one.\r\nBishop Carroll also accompanied Franklin to the French Canadian\r\nprovinces for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nThere were twelve Irish delegates to the convention that adopted the\r\nConstitution, and there were five Irishmen in the first United States\r\nSenate of twenty-two members.\r\n\r\nDr. Hugh Knox educated Alexander Hamilton, who was a poor boy. Doctor\r\nKnox was a big-hearted Irishman. It was Matthew P. Lyon, an Irishman,\r\nwho was sold as a slave in Connecticut when a mere boy, who, on the\r\nthirty-sixth ballot, as a congressman from Vermont, later in life, cast\r\nthe deciding vote that elected Thomas Jefferson president of the United\r\nStates over Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\nMany who came with the French to assist the Americans were sons of\r\nIrishmen, who had been driven to France with Patrick Sarsfield after the\r\ntreachery of the British at Limerick in 1691.\r\n\r\nFrom 1691 to 1791, over 400,000 different Irishmen served in the French\r\narmy. When the Revolutionary War broke out, they petitioned the French\r\nWar Department to come to America to fight their national foes. There\r\nwere entire Irish regiments in the French army when Cornwallis\r\nsurrendered at Yorktown. A young Irishman, Robert Wilson, was appointed\r\nto take charge of the surrendered flags and the news of the great\r\nvictory was sent in haste to President Thomas McKean, of the Continental\r\nCongress at Philadelphia. McKean was one of the foremost Irish Americans\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nMolly Pitcher and Nancy Hart, two Irish women who participated in the\r\nRevolutionary War, deserve rank with the greatest heroines in history.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were among the leading educators, journalists, theologians,\r\nhistorians, scientists, canal constructors, and railway builders of the\r\ndecades subsequent to the Revolutionary War. They were leaders in laying\r\nsubstantially the broad foundation for our material, educational and\r\nmoral greatness. They gave us such statesmen as James Monroe, Andrew\r\nJackson, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, and many others, who were among\r\nthe very ablest national leaders in the early history of our republic.\r\n\r\nI shall not refer to the part the Irish took in the War of 1812, the\r\nMexican War, the great Civil conflict, or the Spanish-American struggle\r\nfor supremacy. All I ask is for you to reflect on their great fight for\r\nliberty from 1775 to 1783—that struggle that has been felt around the\r\nworld—and to tell the facts to your children, to your friends, and to\r\nyour fellow citizens, for they will not, for some unknown reason, find\r\nit in ordinary histories. I can do no better than to quote, in closing,\r\nthe words of Colonel John Parke Custis, the adopted son of General\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n“Then honored be the old and good services of the sons of Erin in the\r\nwar of independence. Let the shamrock be entwined with the laurels of\r\nthe Revolution; and truth and justice, guiding the pen of history,\r\ninscribe on the tablets of American remembrance: ‘Eternal gratitude to\r\nIrishmen.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. THOMAS HASSETT.\r\n\r\n  New York.\r\n\r\n  Elected a Life Member in 1908.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HON. ELI THAYER, ONE OF THE EARLY MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN IRISH\r\nHISTORICAL SOCIETY. A MOST DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN, KNOWN THE WORLD OVER.\r\n                  A FEW FACTS ABOUT HIS LIFE AND WORK.\r\n\r\n                       BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Eli Thayer was born in the town of Mendon, in the state of\r\nMassachusetts, June 11, 1819, and deceased at Worcester, in that state,\r\nApril 15, 1899, aged eighty years.\r\n\r\nHe was elected a member of the American Irish Historical Society in\r\n1897, shortly after its first meeting, and was an active and interested\r\nmember at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer was a descendant in the seventh generation from Thomas Thayer\r\nand seventh in descent from John Alden of _Mayflower_ fame, through\r\nRuth, daughter of Rev. Noah Alden of Bellingham, Mass., who married his\r\ngrandfather, Benjamin Thayer. John Alden was an Irishman and Thomas\r\nThayer was Irish on the side of one of his parents.\r\n\r\nHe was the eldest of eight children. He received his early education in\r\nthe district schools of Mendon, and at the Bellingham High School. Later\r\nhe attended the academy at Amherst and the manual training school at\r\nWorcester, afterwards the Worcester Academy. He always ranked high in\r\nhis scholarship, and in 1835–’36 taught school in Douglass, and for the\r\nfour succeeding years assisted his father in a country store at\r\nMillville. In May, 1840, he re-entered the manual labor school, in order\r\nto fit for Brown University. Two years later he taught school at\r\nHopkinton, Rhode Island, and while there was elected a member of the Phi\r\nBeta Kappa fraternity, an honor seldom conferred before the senior year.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1844, the superintendent of schools in Providence, Nathan\r\nBishop, induced him to take charge of the boys’ high school for the\r\nremainder of the year for $600, a large salary for that period. This\r\nschool had proven for some time unmanageable in the hands of several\r\nmasters, but he reduced it to order and subjection. By accepting this\r\nposition, he lost a year at Brown University, but was able to graduate\r\nin 1845, the second in his class. After his graduation, he immediately\r\ncame to Worcester and became a teacher at the Academy, and was later its\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 he purchased of John Jaques four acres and ninety rods of land\r\nin Worcester, on what was then called Goat Hill. In 1848 he began the\r\nerection of the building called the Oread, which was completed in 1852.\r\nIt is built of the stone underlying the hill. At first only the north\r\ntower was completed, and it was in this portion of the building that he\r\nestablished the famous school for young women, which he conducted with\r\ngreat success until he entered upon his later political work.\r\n\r\nAt the time that the school was opened, it was the only institute in the\r\ncountry that promised a full college course for women. It was the\r\nforerunner of Vassar, Smith and Wellesley. The name Oread means “the\r\nabode of the mountain nymphs.” The south tower was completed in 1850,\r\nand the connecting portion of the building a year or two later.\r\n\r\nThe towers are 40 feet in diameter and four stories high, while the\r\nentire length of the building is 250 feet. It was constructed after\r\ndesigns entirely Mr. Thayer’s own, without the aid of an architect, and\r\nthe beauty of the building and the charming location have been remarked\r\nby strangers from all over the country.\r\n\r\nHe entered political life in 1852, when he was elected a member of the\r\nschool board. Later he was a member of the board of aldermen and served\r\nduring the years of 1853–’54 in the state legislature. It was during his\r\nfirst year in the state House of Representatives that he became\r\nconspicuous by the introduction of a bill to incorporate the Bank of\r\nMutual Redemption, which was hailed with delight by bankers and monied\r\nmen throughout the state, as it seemed to afford a means of release from\r\nthe autocratic rule of the Suffolk Bank of Boston.\r\n\r\nThis bill was passed in the course of years and the Bank of Mutual\r\nRedemption loaned the money to the government when Andrew was governor\r\nduring the Civil War.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until 1854 that Mr. Thayer accomplished the great\r\nact of his life, the one which enrolls his name among the benefactors of\r\nmankind, in originating the plan which saved Kansas and other\r\nterritories to the Union and perhaps settled the destiny of the nation,\r\nfor if the southern leaders had secured the territories, it would have\r\ngiven them the balance of power for many years to come and there would\r\nhave been no rebellion. The North would have acquiesced, as it always\r\nhad, in the decision of the congressional majority. In his original idea\r\nof making Kansas free, he actually settled the destinies of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was at a meeting to protest against the repeal of the Missouri\r\ncompromise, held in the old city hall on the evening of March 11, 1854,\r\nthat Mr. Thayer announced his celebrated “plan of freedom.” In effect it\r\nwas simply to take possession by lawful means of the new territories\r\nthrough organized immigration of free-state men sustained by a base of\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer defined this plan as “business anti-slavery,” distinguished\r\nfrom sentimental and political anti-slavery, both of which had been\r\ntried for many years and found to be faulty, slavery in the meantime\r\nconstantly growing stronger. He clearly saw that whichever side gained\r\nthe majority of the settlers would control the situations of the new\r\nsection, in spite of all efforts to establish others among them, and to\r\nthe purpose of securing this majority for freedom he devoted all his\r\nenergies and all of his means until that end was accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs the first means toward fortifying himself for this undertaking he\r\nimmediately secured the passage of an act to incorporate the\r\nMassachusetts Emigrant Aid Company and before the vote to repeal the\r\nMissouri compromise was taken, hired a hall in Boston and began to speak\r\nafternoon and evening in behalf of his undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe intense excitement and strong opposition which followed the first\r\nannouncement of the purpose to repeal the compromise in a great measure\r\nsubsided after that act was accomplished, and he found extreme\r\ndifficulty in the succeeding months in persuading a sufficient number of\r\nmen to join in his enterprise to form the first colony.\r\n\r\nThe Know-Nothing frenzy absorbed the public mind so fully that other\r\nconsiderations were almost entirely excluded, and the Free Soil vote of\r\n1854 dwindled to a few thousands, the Republican candidate for governor\r\nhimself deserting his party and voting with the native Americans. The\r\nKnow-Nothing organization had controlled the state for three years, and\r\nthe frenzy had seized the public mind to such an extent that no man who\r\naspired to public office had a chance of election unless he was\r\naffiliated with that party.\r\n\r\nEvery member of Congress belonged to it, and it has been commonly said\r\nthat Henry Wilson and other prominent office-holders of that time were\r\nelected upon that platform. The national Know-Nothing party did not\r\nagitate the slavery question, but maintained that Congress ought not to\r\nlegislate on the question of slavery, which was regulated by the\r\nstatutes of the various states.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the Republicans of the Massachusetts congressional district in\r\nwhich Worcester is situated came to the front, but, feeling that they\r\nstood no show of winning at the pending elections, made alliances with\r\nthe Know-Nothing party, whereby the offices were to be divided, and Col.\r\nAlexander Dewitt made an agreement with Henry Chapin that he would not\r\nrun against him. At the last moment, however, Governor Gardiner sent\r\nword that he must make the run against Chapin. It was at this crisis\r\nthat Charles White, a party manager, nominated Eli Thayer for Congress,\r\nand took a carriage and went to the Oread to notify him of his\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer was warmly greeted in the convention and, although it was but\r\nfive days before the election, he announced his determination to stump\r\nthe district and called for means of transportation to the various towns\r\nand villages. During the five days he made on an average four speeches a\r\nday. At the close of the campaign Dr. Joseph Sargent said to Mr. Thayer\r\nthat no man could do what he had done and live, but he replied that he\r\nwas prepared to undertake the same ordeal again in the same cause.\r\n\r\nDuring this campaign he would speak at Clinton in the morning, at\r\nLeominster at noon, at Ashburnham in the afternoon and at Fitchburg in\r\nthe evening, and it was in this way that he covered the entire Worcester\r\ndistrict in the short space of five days. The result of this bitter\r\ncontest was most gratifying to Mr. Thayer, who won by a vote of nearly\r\ntwo to one. The election was in November, 1856, but Mr. Thayer did not\r\ntake his seat until the December of the following year.\r\n\r\nAt this time a new matter was interesting the southern members—the\r\nretention of the state of Kansas in the Democratic column. The notable\r\nsouthern propagandists, of which Quitman of Mississippi was the\r\nrepresentative, had, in order to amend the neutrality laws, put on foot\r\na scheme for the unification of Mexico, Cuba and Central America and the\r\nformation of an immense slave empire. This was regarded by the northern\r\nrepresentatives with a great deal of apprehension, but much to the\r\nsurprise of everyone Mr. Thayer came out in favor of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. WILLIAM J. FARRELL.\r\n\r\n  Of New York.\r\n\r\n  A New Life Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe said to the southern leaders that he intended to colonize this new\r\nempire with New England Yankees. His speeches on Central American\r\ncolonization, on the “Suicide of Slavery,” and on the “Admission of\r\nOregon” brought him great fame. Against the caucus decision of his own\r\nparty he secured the admission of Oregon into the Union, and in this\r\nact, though in opposition to partisan dictation, he was sustained by\r\nleading Republican organs throughout the country, although he received\r\nsome censure in his own district.\r\n\r\nSoon after these speeches his political enemies in the district began to\r\norganize against him, but his popularity was not to be overcome and he\r\nwas returned with a flattering endorsement. During his second term in\r\nCongress he was instrumental in the admission of Oregon as a state to\r\nstatehood. The Republicans were of the opinion that the admission of\r\nOregon into the Union would mean heavier Democratic representation. Mr.\r\nThayer, however, argued that the best way to make Oregon a Republican\r\nstate would be to admit it into the Union. Succeeding events proved that\r\nhis view of the matter was correct, but at the time the Republicans in\r\nthe House opposed the admission.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer, during the discussion of the bill, went to Alexander H.\r\nStephens, then chairman of the Committee on Territories of the House,\r\nand told him that he should work for the passage of the bill and it was\r\nto his everlasting credit that Oregon was admitted to the Union by a\r\nmajority of eleven votes, of which fourteen had been won over by the\r\nuntiring efforts of Mr. Thayer.\r\n\r\nHe was assailed at home for his stand in this matter, as his\r\nconstituents considered that he had voted for a measure which provided\r\nfor the admission of a state whose constitution excluded the negro from\r\nall political rights. As a direct result of his stand in this matter,\r\nthe district failed to send him as a delegate to the national convention\r\nin 1860, which placed in nomination Abraham Lincoln for the presidency.\r\n\r\nTogether with Horace Greeley, however, he was a member of the\r\nconvention, representing Oregon, the state for whose admission he had so\r\nearnestly worked, and whose people appreciated his services in its\r\nbehalf. He worked with Greeley for the nomination of Lincoln in a\r\nconvention which was replete with startling incidents, not the least of\r\nwhich was the motion of Joshua R. Giddings, aiming at the admission of a\r\nclause in the platform providing that all men are free and equal.\r\n\r\nOn account of this outspoken stand in several important measures, it was\r\napparent to Mr. Thayer that he would fail of a renomination, and in the\r\nspring of 1860 he announced himself as an independent Republican\r\ncandidate. As the campaign developed, a candidate in opposition to Mr.\r\nThayer was found in the person of Goldsmith F. Bailey of Fitchburg, but\r\nno speaker in the state could be found who was willing to meet the\r\narguments on important questions advanced by Mr. Thayer. Such men as\r\nHenry Wilson and Charles Sumner refused to meet him on the stump in\r\njoint debate, and he was obliged to fight it out alone. The result was\r\nthat he was defeated by a very small majority. So great was his\r\npopularity throughout the country during his second term that he was\r\nprominently spoken of as a possible senator from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBailey, who defeated him for Congress, was in advanced stages of\r\nconsumption when he was nominated and was unable to take the stump\r\nagainst Mr. Thayer. The voters of Worcester at last became so vigorous\r\nin their demands to see the candidate that to quiet them a meeting was\r\narranged at which he was to be presented to them from the platform. When\r\nBailey arrived in the city he was such a haggard and ghastly spectacle\r\nthat it was feared by the party managers that if seen by the voters as\r\nhe was, it would make votes for Thayer.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained by those who seem to know that Bailey was taken into\r\nGeorge R. Spear’s drug store before the meeting. There his face was\r\npainted and touched up with cosmetics until he looked like a thing of\r\nlife instead of a specter. He sat in Congress but one day, and then\r\nreturned to his home and died.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Mr. Thayer originated a southern colonization scheme, which had\r\nfor its object the settling of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and\r\nthe border states and driving the slaves toward the Gulf. He enlisted\r\nthe services of James Gordon Bennett of the _New York Herald_, and\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant of the _New York Evening Post_ in his project. He\r\nwent South at the head of the colonists and founded the town of Ceredo\r\nin Virginia, now a sizable place.\r\n\r\nAt the time he was charged by the Southerners with coming down into the\r\nSouth to interfere with slavery, but he and his colonists disclaimed any\r\nsuch purpose, saying that he neither intended to interfere nor have any\r\npart in the slavery movement. He said further that he could support the\r\nnegro power and a steam engine for $10 a year, while it was costing the\r\nsouthern slaveholders $150 a year, and that at the time he came into\r\nVirginia land was worth but 50 cents to $1.50 an acre, but that his free\r\nsettlement had made it worth $50 an acre.\r\n\r\nA man named Jenkins, afterwards a rebel officer, appealed to Gov. Henry\r\nA. Wise to exterminate this colony of abolitionists, but the governor\r\nsaid that they came into the state in a peaceful way and that anything\r\nwhich tended to increase the wealth should be protected. Considerable\r\nprogress with the colonization scheme was made in other states,\r\nespecially in North Carolina, but the John Brown raid and the opening of\r\nthe rebellion brought the enterprise to an end. After the war Charles B.\r\nHoard, a member of Congress with Mr. Thayer, came into possession of the\r\nproperty at Ceredo. The project caused Mr. Thayer a loss of $118,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer was appointed a special and confidential agent of the\r\ntreasury department and served as such in 1861–’62. In 1862 he proposed\r\nto Secretary Stanton a plan for the military colonization of Florida,\r\nwhich was approved by President Lincoln, all of the members of the\r\npresident’s cabinet excepting Seward, and by nearly every Republican\r\nmember of Congress, as well as by Generals Hunter, Hooker and Garfield.\r\nAccording to the plan, Mr. Thayer was to go as military governor and\r\nGeneral Garfield as commander of the forces.\r\n\r\nThis plan was under consideration for several months by the president’s\r\ncabinet and was sustained by great meetings in New York City and\r\nBrooklyn by such speakers as William Cullen Bryant and Cassius M. Clay\r\nand others of equal note. Capitalists came forward with offers of\r\nsteamships, and other means and regiments were offered from several of\r\nthe states, but, like other notable plans which were never carried out,\r\nthis plan was prevented from being put into operation by exigencies of\r\nthe times.\r\n\r\nHe remained with the Republican party until the impeachment of President\r\nJohnson. He was a Democratic candidate for Congress in this district in\r\n1874, and also later, in the first instance nearly defeating Senator\r\nGeorge F. Hoar, reducing the Republican majority from 7,000 to 300.\r\n\r\nHe was interested in the solution of the polygamy question in Utah, and,\r\nin connection with such men as Amos A. Lawrence, Edward Everett Hale and\r\nother members of the old Emigrant Aid Society, was concerned with plans\r\nfor the elimination of the evil by the principle formerly put into force\r\nin Kansas. In recent years he has written much of history, illustrating\r\nhis life work and the principles which have governed his actions in\r\npolitical and philanthropic work. He kept fully abreast of the times,\r\nwith a keen interest in current events, and was always in sympathy with\r\ngenuine progress.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer was engaged after leaving Congress by the Hanibal and St. Joe\r\nRailroad Company, at a very large salary, to act as its land agent in\r\nNew York City. He was there from about 1864 until 1870. He was also an\r\nexpert in matters of invention, acting as a referee in such cases, for\r\nwhich he received large sums. He studied law, but was never admitted to\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\nDuring the war time he originated a plan for the establishment of a\r\ngreat port of entry on the peninsular between the York and the James\r\nrivers in Virginia, and obtained a bond for a deed of the land. He\r\nconsidered the natural advantages of that locality a rival to New York.\r\nHis plan, however, was divulged to certain heavy capitalists in New\r\nYork, and they by some means obtained possession of the property and\r\nfrustrated his scheme. He said he would have carried the thing through\r\nhad he obtained the land, but the capitalists undertook it and failed.\r\n\r\nHe had a very keen sense of humor and a sharp wit. It was most amusing\r\nof itself to hear him tell humorous stories and preserve his grim\r\ncountenance from the suspicion of a smile.\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer took the initiative in developing the south end of Worcester\r\nfor manufacturing by erecting, more than fifty years ago, the building\r\nformerly known as the Adriatic mills on Southgate Street. He was\r\ninfluential in the erection of the junction shop formerly the property\r\nof the late Col. James Estabrook, and for many years occupied by the\r\nKnowles loom works on Jackson Street. This building, like the Oread\r\nInstitute, was constructed of the stone taken from Oread Hill. He laid\r\nout and improved several streets and tracts of land in the vicinity of\r\nthe Oread and had under consideration at the time of his death the\r\nopening up of a large area on the summit of Pakachoag Hill, at the rear\r\nof Holy Cross College.\r\n\r\nHe was the last surviving member of the Emigrant Aid Society, director\r\nof the Mutual Redemption Bank, member of the Worcester Society of\r\nAntiquity and the American Irish Historical Society. Belonging to no\r\nclubs, he was essentially a home man. Throughout the country he was\r\nfamiliarly known as the “Father of Kansas.”\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1846 to Cardina M. Capron of Millville, Mass., and\r\nseven children were born as a result of the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE PUBLICATIONS ON HISTORY OF INTEREST TO THE MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN\r\n                       IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                       BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC BLOCKADE. By ALBERT E. HOGAN, LL. D.\r\n\r\nThis is the only treatise in English exclusively upon this subject, and\r\nthe author has discussed a minor topic of international law fully and\r\nfairly. His views are briefly that pacific blockade (the right to\r\nblockade the ports of another state in time of peace and without war\r\nnecessarily resulting) is too new a practice to have become entirely\r\nregularized; that the state blockaded as well as the blockader, but not\r\nthe third powers affected, may decline to look upon a specific case of\r\npacific blockade as consistent with peace, and thus consider war to be a\r\nfact; that notice, effectiveness, days of grace, etc., are to be\r\nobserved much as in ordinary blockade; that, unlike ordinary blockade,\r\nit may be limited to a certain commodity or a certain traffic; that the\r\nships of third powers, attempting to run a pacific blockade, can only be\r\nturned back or at most detained, never seized and confiscated as if war\r\nexisted; that this kind of coercion is better than war for all parties.\r\n\r\nDoctor Hogan is an Irishman and a professor of law at the University of\r\nOxford in England, but his book and his views are being much discussed\r\nand widely criticised by American historical authorities.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY OF THE PINCKNEY DRAUGHT. By HON. CHARLES C. NOTT, formerly\r\nChief Justice of the United States Court of Claims.\r\n\r\nThis work is interesting throughout. Pinckney was not a great\r\nconstructive statesman, but in the work of the convention he rendered\r\nvaluable service in formulating many of the details embodied in the\r\nConstitution. It was not so much a new instrument of government that\r\nPinckney framed in his original plan as it was a revision of the\r\nArticles of Confederation. In the preparation of his plan, Pinckney drew\r\nextensively upon the Articles of Confederation and the various state\r\nconstitutions, especially that of New York. On May 29th, 1787, Charles\r\nPinckney presented to the Federal Convention “the draft of a federal\r\ngovernment to be agreed upon between the free and independent states of\r\nAmerica”; that the records note simply its submission to the convention,\r\nits reference on the same day to the Committee of the Whole House, and\r\nlater to the Committee of Detail; and that when John Quincy Adams in\r\n1818 applied to Pinckney for a copy of the missing plan, he received in\r\nreply a document so strikingly similar to the draft of a constitution\r\nreported by the Committee of Detail on August 6th that it was evident\r\none document must have been taken from the other. The conclusion has\r\nbeen almost universally unfavorable to Pinckney. Judge Nott in his work\r\ntakes the other side, and in an elaborate argument declares that the\r\noriginal Pinckney plan is lost to the world because it was used as\r\n“printer’s copy” by the Committee of Detail.\r\n\r\nTHE WORKS OF JAMES BUCHANAN, COMPRISING HIS SPEECHES, STATE PAPERS AND\r\nPRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE. Collected and edited by PROF. JOHN BASSETT\r\nMOORE. Volumes V and VI, 1841–1844, 1844–1846.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan was an Irishman, and Professor Moore has undertaken a\r\nmost meritorious work in bringing forth the speeches, state papers and\r\nprivate correspondence of this great American citizen. The volume now\r\nissued is the fifth, and covers part of the period that Mr. Buchanan was\r\nin the United States Senate, where his continued membership of the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations and Committee on Manufactures brought him\r\ninto close contact with many of the most pressing questions of the time.\r\nThe great issues covered by these volumes were those of the northeastern\r\nand northwestern boundaries and the annexation of Texas. In 1844\r\nBuchanan was a presidential possibility, and his letters, though few in\r\nnumber, show him willing to take, but unwilling to seek, this high\r\noffice. An excellent review of these volumes has recently been made by\r\nProfessor William MacDonald of Brown University, Providence, R. I., a\r\nmember of the Executive Committee of the American Historical\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHAUNCEY OLCOTT.\r\n\r\n  Of New York City, the Famous Actor.\r\n\r\n  A Life Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOLD TIMES ON THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI: THE RECOLLECTIONS OF A STEAMBOAT\r\nPILOT FROM 1854 TO 1863. BY GEORGE BYRON MERRICK.\r\n\r\nThe author’s family were whalers from Nantucket. Mr. Merrick is a good\r\nstory-teller, and his book abounds with tales of traffic on the\r\nMississippi River from 1854 to 1863.\r\n\r\nThe author originally came from Nantucket, and began as a pantry boy on\r\nthe Mississippi, occupying every position in the steamboat and flat-boat\r\nbusiness for a great many years, and his tales of war-times are\r\nintensely interesting. The book is not well named, however, because\r\nsteamboating was a large business for over thirty years before the\r\nnarrative begins. He tells interestingly of bringing to the front in\r\nApril, 1861, Sherman’s Flying Artillery, the most famous organization in\r\nthe old army, stationed at the time at Fort Ridgely, high up the\r\nMinnesota River. The _Fanny Harris_, the largest boat which had ever\r\ngone up the stream, received the battery on board, its commander then\r\nbeing no other than John C. Pemberton of Pennsylvania, at first a loyal\r\nUnion officer, although afterwards the Confederate lieutenant-general at\r\nVicksburg. His lieutenant was Romeyn B. Ayres, than whom no Federal\r\nofficer of the Civil War was braver. The river was at flood, the perils\r\nof navigation great, but the emergency was pressing. The _Fanny Harris_\r\ndashed on at full speed, sometimes in the tortuous channel, sometimes\r\ncrashing through narrow barriers of land into inundated bottoms and even\r\nwoods, the battery-men meantime exclaiming that the risk to life in\r\nbattle was far less than among those pouring waters. Three hundred miles\r\ndown the current was accomplished in two days. The boat was almost\r\nstripped of smokestacks, light upper work, and nearly all of her guards,\r\nbut the battery was delivered, guns and men, at Prairie du Chien. Its\r\nstyle is simple, but very interesting, and the book is beautifully\r\nillustrated and printed.\r\n\r\nTEXTS OF THE PEACE CONFERENCES AT THE HAGUE, 1899 AND 1907, with English\r\ntranslation and appendix of related documents. Edited by JAMES BROWN\r\nSCOTT, technical delegate of the United States to the Second Peace\r\nConference at The Hague.\r\n\r\nThe volume is published by Ginn & Company of Boston and New York, of\r\nwhich our Librarian and Archivist, Mr. Thomas B. Lawler, is a partner.\r\nThere is a twenty-five page introduction, giving an analysis and\r\ndiscussion of the work of the conferences. Most of the documents have\r\nbeen published elsewhere, and some of them many times, but it is well\r\nworth while to have them brought together in this convenient form.\r\nEx-Secretary Root thinks the work of the Second Conference presents the\r\ngreatest advance ever made at any single time towards the reasonable and\r\npeaceful regulation of international conduct, unless it be the advance\r\nmade at The Hague Conference of 1899. The volume is complete and treats\r\nof the important factors in both conferences, and publishes the very\r\nvaluable documents.\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLIOGRAPHER’S MANUAL OF AMERICAN HISTORY, containing an account of\r\nall state, territory, town and county histories, etc., compiled by\r\nTHOMAS LINDSLEY BRADFORD, M. D.\r\n\r\nThree volumes have thus far been issued, and each volume shows\r\nimprovement over its predecessor. It is a valuable work and a most\r\nexcellent compilation of documents of great advantage to students of\r\nAmerican history, and furnishes a good means of observation to the\r\nmembers of the American Irish Historical Society to take in at a glance\r\nthe history of so many places in this country.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN EXECUTIVE AND EXECUTIVE METHODS. By JOHN H. FINLEY,\r\nPresident of the College of the City of New York, and JOHN F. SANDERSON,\r\nmember of the Pennsylvania Bar.\r\n\r\nThe joint authors of this book have maintained the high standard of\r\nscholarship that has characterized the series of which the volume under\r\nreview is the final number. There are fourteen chapters upon the\r\nexecutive department of the American state, and the other eight deal\r\nwith the federal executive, to which is added an appendix upon the\r\npresidential electoral system. Throughout the work reference is made to\r\nthe excellent achievements of many Pennsylvania Irishmen, but Mr.\r\nMarshall S. Brown, who prints a review of the work, finds, among other\r\nthings, that the book reflects somewhat the defects inherent in a work\r\nof dual authorship.\r\n\r\nWINTHROP’S JOURNAL, 1630–1649. Edited by JAMES KENDALL HOSMER. Two\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the series of “Original Narratives of Early American\r\nHistory.” The old title, “History of New England,” is given in this\r\nedition only as a sub-title, and the volumes appear to be what they\r\nare—a journal. Nevertheless, the work is interesting throughout, and\r\nwould be a valuable addition to the Society’s library.\r\n\r\nTHE PROVINCE OF NEW JERSEY, 1664–1738. By EDWIN P. TANNER, PH. D.,\r\ninstructor in history in Syracuse University.\r\n\r\nThis is a detailed history of the political affairs and institutions of\r\nNew Jersey during two generations of its provincial life. The peculiar\r\nland system of the proprietors in each of the two Jerseys, elements of\r\nthe population, the personnel, legal position and activities of\r\nexecutive, council and assembly respectively, and their conflicts, the\r\njudicial system, financial affairs, militia system, etc., are carefully\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF JAMES MADISON. Edited by GAILLARD HUNT.\r\n\r\nThis is much on the plan and fully as extensive as “The Works of James\r\nBuchanan” heretofore referred to, and eight volumes at present have been\r\nissued. The notes are excellent in respect to information and judgment,\r\nbut not much of the matter set out is new, the author merely contenting\r\nhimself by copying the writings of President Madison without making any\r\nspecious comment on the same.\r\n\r\nA CALENDAR OF CONFEDERATE PAPERS, WITH A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SOME\r\nCONFEDERATE PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nThis is a preliminary report of the Southern Historical Manuscripts\r\nCommission, and is one of the really monumental historical enterprises\r\nin the South. The commission is actively collecting, arranging and\r\npublishing various kinds of material relating to the Civil War, and to\r\nthoroughly appreciate the truly marvelous changes one should have known\r\nthe conditions in the southern capitals a quarter of a century ago.\r\nThose directing this enterprise are so energetic, intelligent and\r\nambitious that we believe the best fruits are yet to be gathered,\r\nalthough there is no room to doubt the value of several large\r\ncollections already made. Mr. Douglas Southall Freeman is the director,\r\nand this calendar, orderly throughout and supplemented by careful notes,\r\nis very complimentary to him. Much historical data can be gathered for\r\nthe Society from the southern states, where the recognition of Irishmen\r\nand their achievements was more free than in the New England states.\r\n\r\nTHE ADOPTION OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. By HORACE EDGAR FLACK, PH. D.\r\n\r\nIs a part of the Johns Hopkins University studies in historical and\r\npolitical science. So much has been heretofore said about these studies\r\nin the current magazines that we assume the members of the Society are\r\nfamiliar with them.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS AND RESEARCHES MADE BY THE MICHIGAN PIONEER AND HISTORICAL\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe Society has been at work many years, and now publishes its\r\nthirty-sixth volume. The usefulness of this work to members of our\r\nSociety in Michigan who desire to record the history and achievements of\r\nAmericans of Irish birth or descent cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS OF THE STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nThis is the eighteenth volume of the publications, and is edited by\r\nDoctor Thwaites, Secretary and Superintendent of the Society. The\r\nWisconsin History Commission, consisting of the governor of the state,\r\nthe professor of American history in the state university, the secretary\r\nof the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, the secretary of the\r\nLibrary Commission, and a representative of the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic, work with the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, and have\r\nalready gathered and arranged the material for a history of Wisconsin’s\r\npart in the Civil War. A series of “Original Papers” has been\r\ninaugurated, on the line of the papers presented at our last meeting in\r\nWashington by Mr. Justice Dowling and Ex-Attorney-General Moloney, and\r\nare very interesting.\r\n\r\nLIVES OF THE GOVERNORS OF MINNESOTA.\r\n\r\nIs Volume XIII of the publications of the Minnesota Historical Society\r\nCollections, and is by James H. Baker, A. M., who has occupied several\r\npolitical positions in his state and has been closely associated with\r\nthe men whose lives he has sketched. Mr. Baker is almost eighty years of\r\nage, and he has personal acquaintance with the governors from Ramsey,\r\nthe first territorial governor in 1849, up to the present incumbent. Mr.\r\nBaker’s sketches of Gorman, territorial governor from 1853 to 1857;\r\nSibley, first state governor from 1858 to 1860; Swift, third state\r\ngovernor from 1863 to 1864; McGill, 1887 to 1889; and Clough, 1895 to\r\n1899; men of Irish extraction, are thorough and entertaining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON.

Martin. Fifty-six essays by nearly as many\r\nwriters are presented. Several of the productions are composed of\r\nseparate papers, such as the collections of biographical sketches of\r\nmembers of early legislatures, etc. A wealth of original material, well\r\nworth the notice of historians outside of the state of Kansas, is\r\nrevealed, and forty-eight maps, plans, portraits and landscapes\r\nillustrate the text.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CITY OF VINCENNES, 1702–1901:\r\n\r\nAn important contribution to the local history of Indiana, and a well\r\nwritten and authentic account of the oldest town in that state.

Bryant.\r\n\r\nProfessor Edward Channing of Harvard University has two volumes of a\r\nHistory of the United States already issued of a series of eight\r\nvolumes. The title of Volume I is “The Planting of a Nation in the New\r\nWorld, 1000 to 1660”; Volume II, “A Century of Colonial History, 1660 to\r\n1760.” The titles to Volumes III and IV, not yet issued, are “The\r\nAmerican Revolution, 1760–1789,” and “Federalists and Republicans,\r\n1789–1812,” while the titles to Volumes V to VIII have not as yet been\r\nselected.\r\n\r\n“Dr. John McLoughlin, the Victor of Oregon,” an authoritative\r\nbiographical sketch, with abundant documents, by Frederick V. Holman.\r\n\r\n“A Documentary Source-Book of American History,” by Professor William\r\nMacDonald of Brown University, author of “Select Charters,” “Select\r\nDocuments,” and “Select Statutes,” etc. The work is in one volume, and\r\nincludes all the most important documents contained in Professor\r\nMacDonald’s large works, but in some cases shortened by immaterial\r\nomissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GENERAL HISTORICAL ITEMS.\r\n\r\nA very interesting document is the Report of the Committee on the\r\nDocumentary Historical Publications of the United States Government,\r\nappointed by President Roosevelt in February, 1908, as an assistant\r\ncommittee to the Committee on Department Methods. Hon. Lawrence O.\r\nMurray, now Comptroller of the Currency at Washington, D. C., and at\r\nthat time in the Department of Commerce and Labor, is a member of this\r\ncommittee, and the Society acknowledges with its thanks the receipt from\r\nhim of a copy.\r\n\r\nOn February 11th, the President sent it to Congress with a message, and\r\nmessage and report have since been printed as Senate Document No. 714 of\r\nthe session concluded March 4th.\r\n\r\nThe report contains a review of the course hitherto pursued by the\r\ngovernment in the matter of historical publications; a general survey of\r\nthe publications hitherto made, and of the gaps still existing between\r\nor among them; a body of recommendations for filling such gaps,\r\nespecially by the inception of a series of National State Papers; and\r\nfinally a series of suggestions for the organization of a permanent\r\nCommission on National Historical Publications, with a bill which, it is\r\nhoped, will be introduced in the sixty-first Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Branch of the American\r\nHistorical Association was held at the University of California November\r\n21st last. Papers were read by Professor E. D. Adams of Stanford\r\nUniversity concerning the annexation of California, Mr. Don E. Smith and\r\nProfessor J. N. Bowman of the University of California, and by Mr. F. J.\r\nTaggart. The proceedings lasted the entire day, sessions being held in\r\nthe morning and afternoon, followed by a banquet in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publications of the American Association for International\r\nConciliation are being sent forward to the members of our Society, and\r\nare readable and interesting documents by learned authorities upon the\r\nsubjects they present. At the suggestion of the Secretary of the\r\nAssociation, the addresses of our members were sent him, and he has\r\nwritten each that the publications of the Association will go forward to\r\nthem if they so request it. All that it is necessary to do to receive\r\nthem is to write the Secretary. His address is: “F. P. Keppel,\r\nSecretary, Sub-Station 84, New York City.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas W. Bicknell, Providence, R. I., President of the Rhode\r\nIsland Citizens’ Historical Association and an applicant for membership\r\nin our Society, has recently published in the Journal of American\r\nHistory an interesting article entitled “First White Owners of Land in\r\nAmerica.” Mr. Bicknell is also the author of “Sowans,” a work treating\r\nof the early history of Barrington and Warren in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the contents of the last issue of the _American Historical\r\nMagazine_ is “Heroes of the Battle of Point Pleasant,” by Delia A.\r\nMcCulloch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the January issue of the _Essex Institute Historical Collections_ is\r\nan article on “Captain John Manley of Marblehead, a Man of Irish\r\nDescent,” by Robert E. Peabody.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS.\r\n\r\nIt has been the custom of the Society since its organization to have one\r\nannual meeting and two or more field days each year. The annual meeting\r\nin each instance has been called for the early evening, and the business\r\naffairs finished in a few minutes; then a short reception would take\r\nplace, followed by a dinner, on the completion of which some historical\r\npapers would be read and addresses of interest made.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding is not calculated to sufficiently advance the interests\r\nof the Society, or enable it to truly do the work for which it is\r\norganized. Some historical associations have annual meetings at which\r\nthere is a morning and afternoon session, followed by a dinner in the\r\nevening, while others have sessions lasting two or three days. It is\r\nimpossible to crowd into a single evening, part of which has been taken\r\nup in partaking of a good dinner, any significant number of historical\r\npapers, much less to have a discussion on them.\r\n\r\nValuable addresses have been made that have not been printed in the\r\nJournal, and all that is left of them in the minds of the members is\r\nhardly more than pleasant recollections of the speakers. All the leading\r\nhistorical associations procure valuable papers from members, and, after\r\nthey are read, discussion upon the subject-matter is thrown open, the\r\ngood points gathered, and all reported in print later for the use of the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThis Society could profitably take a day and an evening for its annual\r\nmeeting. A morning session should be had, called to order at ten\r\no’clock. Two or three papers could be read and discussion had upon each,\r\nfollowed by a recess from one to three p. m. Further papers and\r\ndiscussion might then be entertained and the meeting adjourned, with all\r\nthe business completely transacted, in time for the dinner in the\r\nevening, at which short and interesting speeches, good music and general\r\nrecreation after the day’s work would be in order.\r\n\r\nThese annual conventions should take place in different parts of the\r\ncountry, and those interested in our work will be sure to be on hand. In\r\nlooking over some of our old records, it appears that requests have been\r\nmade by members for meetings to take place in Richmond, Va., Charleston,\r\nS. C., and Detroit, Mich. In neither of these places has an annual\r\nmeeting or a field day of the Society taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of the Society are earnestly requested to furnish the\r\nSecretary-General with correct addresses. When a member removes or\r\nchanges his address, the Secretary-General should be notified\r\nimmediately, otherwise the publications and communications of the\r\nSociety may be lost or fall into unauthorized hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessity for prompt payment of dues ought to be manifest to every\r\nmember. The Society has no income except from the $5 a year contributed\r\nby the annual members. No officer or member receives any salary, and the\r\nfinances are carefully and economically managed by the Executive\r\nCouncil. We have no expense for rental for the Society’s headquarters,\r\nand have no recent record of any officer of the Society accepting even\r\nhis traveling expenses in matters connected with the Society.\r\nNevertheless, the income is small, and our expenditures for printing the\r\nannual volume, gathering historical matter, postage, stationery and\r\ntypewriting are large and do not leave the Society at the end of the\r\nyear with any substantial balance in the Treasurer-General’s hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COL.

SANDERS (Deceased).\r\n\r\n  Gainesville, Ga.\r\n\r\n  Late Member of the Executive Council.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nDonations of money or bequests by will or otherwise are earnestly and\r\nrespectfully solicited, and any member who will take the trouble to read\r\nthe constitution and note the purposes for which the Society is\r\nincorporated can readily see the great and lasting service to our people\r\nand American history in general that could be made, in addition to what\r\nthe Society is now doing, to make better known the Irish Chapter in\r\nAmerican History.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome members well able to pay are in arrears from two to four years in\r\ntheir dues, notwithstanding the fact that several tactful circulars and\r\nrepeated statements have been forwarded them by committees and officers\r\nof the Society. The attention of members is called to section 8 of the\r\nby-laws, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“8. A member neglecting for two years to pay his annual fee shall be\r\nnotified of such omission by the Secretary-General. Still neglecting for\r\nthree months to pay the dues, such delinquent member shall be dropped as\r\nno longer belonging to the Society.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of our members belong to other historical associations, and, by\r\nkeeping in touch with their works, become of greater service to us. The\r\nAmerican Historical Association, the headquarters of which are at the\r\nSmithsonian Institute in Washington, D. C., and the leading state\r\nhistorical associations are cordially recommended to our members.\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers are earnestly requested to furnish the Secretary-General with\r\nbiographical sketches. It is necessary to have these for our archives,\r\nand we hope that no member will allow his feeling of modesty to\r\ninterfere with keeping the records of the Society complete. These\r\nsketches will not be published in the Journal if a member shall so\r\ndirect. Read over your biographical sketches in the membership roll, and\r\nif they are not correct or should have additions, notify the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent items of interest relating to the doings of Americans of Irish\r\nextraction are solicited from every member by the Secretary-General. If\r\na good article is met with in a newspaper or magazine, it will be\r\nthankfully received and filed in the archives if you will send it\r\nforward. It is by keeping abreast with the current history that we\r\nfulfil one of our greatest duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nDonations of historical works, ancient or modern, or, in fact, books of\r\nany description, are solicited for the Society’s library. Copies or\r\noriginals of old deeds, wills, bills of sale of slaves, curiosities in\r\nAmerican or Confederate money, plate, postage stamps, old prints,\r\npictures and the like are also solicited. When received, they will be\r\ncarefully indexed and filed, with the name of the donor attached. Every\r\nmember can readily find something of interest to send, and the\r\naggregation will form a nucleus for a good library and possibly a\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolumes I, II, IV, V and VI of the JOURNAL of the Society are out of\r\nprint. We have fifty copies of Volume III and ten copies of Volume VII\r\nleft.

A WORTHY AND\r\n                        DISTINGUISHED ASSOCIATE.\r\n\r\n By A. W. VAN HOOSE, PRESIDENT BRENAU COLLEGE-CONSERVATORY, GAINESVILLE,\r\n                                   GA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 3d, 1908, there died at his home in Gainesville, Ga., one of\r\nthe most remarkable men that it has been my good fortune to meet.\r\n\r\nDescended on his father’s side from Rev. Moses Sanders, a Baptist\r\npreacher who emigrated from England to this country in the year 1765,\r\nand on his mother’s side from Thomas Smythe, a man distinguished for his\r\ngreat learning and for the many sweet poems that came from his pen, an\r\nIrishman, who with a party of friends, left Dublin, Ireland, in 1798 and\r\nmade his home in Charleston, S. C., Colonel Sanders combined in his\r\nnature, disposition and temperament, the very best characteristics of\r\nthe English and Irish, whose descendant he was.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years I knew him intimately, and I have no hesitation in\r\nmaking the statement that he was one of the most remarkable men of the\r\ngeneration in which he lived.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked in what respects he was remarkable, I would answer,\r\nFirst in his broad patriotism and deep love of country. Although he was\r\nlittle more than a boy when Georgia, in which state his parents had\r\nsettled, seceded and issued her call for her sons to take up arms in\r\ndefense of principles which they knew to be right, young Sanders, who\r\nhad received a splendid military training at the Georgia Military\r\nAcademy, was one of the first to respond to his country’s call, and\r\nduring all those years of carnage and bloodshed, he gave his best\r\nstrength, mental and physical, to the cause of the Confederacy. For\r\ndistinguished bravery and great ability in military matters, he was soon\r\nmade Colonel of the 24th Regiment of Georgia Volunteers and in the\r\nbattles of Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Cold Harbor, Malvern Hill,\r\nFredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Harper’s Ferry, The Wilderness,\r\nSpottsylvania Court House and other great struggles, the Confederacy had\r\nno braver soldier or more efficient officer than he. At Spottsylvania,\r\nhe was severely wounded and his command suffered greatly; he was\r\ncaptured at Sailor’s Creek, May 6, ’65, and until July 25th, suffered\r\nthe awful horrors of the Federal Prison at Johnston’s Island. During the\r\nwar, he was offered the rank of Brigadier-General, but with that modesty\r\nwhich characterized his whole life, he declined the honor.\r\n\r\nWhile he loved the cause of the Confederacy with all the ardor of his\r\ngreat soul, when Lee surrendered at Appomatox, Colonel Sanders ceased\r\nfighting and applied himself diligently to building up the waste places\r\nof his beloved country and to making a competency for himself and\r\nfamily, and the great success which attended his efforts in both\r\ninstances is the second reason that I would assign for calling him a\r\nremarkable man. In 1871, he married Miss Fannie Amelia Scarborough, who\r\nuntil the day of his death, was a blessing and an inspiration to him.\r\nTogether they came to Gainesville, a little mountain village, in 1871,\r\nimmediately after their marriage, to build their home and fortune. By\r\nindustry, economy and great business ability, Colonel Sanders succeeded\r\nin amassing a splendid estate, and at the same time was always first in\r\nhis contributions to any public enterprise or private charity. No one\r\nwill ever know how many cases of distress he relieved; for he obeyed the\r\nScriptural injunction and never allowed his left hand to know what his\r\nright hand was doing. The writer of this sketch, was often at the State\r\nBank, of which Colonel Sanders was President for many years, and has\r\nseen numbers of the old veterans, unfortunate men of all classes and\r\neven the negroes of the city, ask for aid and never once were they\r\nrefused. On the day that he died, I heard numbers of men, with tears in\r\ntheir eyes, say, “I have lost the best friend that I ever knew”; his\r\nfuneral services were attended by every class of people in our city and\r\ncountry, and after his more intimate friends came and with streaming\r\neyes looked into the face of him who had befriended them for so long.\r\nSuch a funeral has been accorded but few men in our country. Colonel\r\nSanders was also remarkable for his literary and scientific attainments.\r\nAlthough he professed to be only a business man, he was a great student\r\nof men and affairs; he was a great reader of history and the record of\r\nall nations, from the earliest period to the present day, was an open\r\nbook to him; he had traveled extensively and the literature and\r\ncivilization of Europe and Egypt and the Holy Land, were so fully and\r\naccurately impressed upon him, that he could entertain his friends by\r\nhours in recounting his experience as a traveler. But best of all,\r\nColonel Sanders was remarkable in his childlike devotion to and faith in\r\nJesus Christ, the Man of Galilee, in whose footsteps he had followed for\r\nmany years. He was one of the very few men of my acquaintance who,\r\nthough devoted to his business, always kept a Bible in the President’s\r\noffice of the State Bank, and oftentimes have I called to see him only\r\nto find him immersed in the beauties of the great prophecies of Isaiah,\r\nor reading the Songs of David, the sweet singer of Israel, or studying\r\nthe life and character of Him who came into the world to save men from\r\ntheir sins. For years, he was a pillar in the Baptist Church of this\r\ncity; he always taught a class in Sunday School and his presence there\r\nwas always an inspiration to the Superintendent. During an intimate\r\nacquaintance for more than twenty years, I do not think that I ever\r\nheard him speak an unkind word of any one and when the summons came, his\r\nhouse was in order and he was ready to meet his Master and give an\r\naccount of the deeds done in the body. I was with him very often during\r\nhis last illness and his faith in the promises of Him whom he had served\r\nso long and so faithfully, was beautiful and sublime. Not a word of\r\nbusiness care or anxiety was heard around the sick bed of Colonel\r\nSanders; he seemed in constant communion with God, and though he had\r\nlarge financial interests, in these last days he made no mention of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo the writer of this sketch, his death was a great personal loss; when\r\nI began the work of building a school for girls in Gainesville nearly\r\ntwenty-five years ago, Colonel Sanders was my friend and supporter;\r\nduring all the years of struggle and trial in the early days of the\r\nschool he gave me the benefit of his advice and counsel and never\r\nrefused any financial assistance when called upon to extend it. It was\r\nhis confidence in a struggling young man that often nerved my arm and\r\nheart to continue the work which I had undertaken. And when the end had\r\ncome, and I looked upon that face, calm and sweet, having the appearance\r\nof one who had only fallen asleep, I thought of the words of the great\r\npoet and said to myself:\r\n\r\n          “His life was gentle,\r\n          And the elements so mixed in him,\r\n          That Nature might stand up and say to all the world,\r\n          Here was a _man_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PATRICK J. McTIGHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA worthy member of the American Irish Historical Society was deceased at\r\nBinghamton, N. Y., August 4, 1908.\r\n\r\nPatrick J. McTighe was born in Kilrush, County Clare, Ireland, in 1840,\r\nand received his education in a university at Dublin. His parents\r\narrived in this country about fifty-five years ago, settled in\r\nBinghamton and were among the few pioneer Irish Catholic residents of\r\nthat section. About forty-five years ago Mr. McTighe followed his\r\nparents to Binghamton and secured a position as teacher in one of the\r\npublic schools. After teaching about two years he entered the employ of\r\nthe wholesale grocery firm of Jackson, Denton & Marks. This firm changed\r\nseveral times and many different partners were admitted and retired\r\nwhile Mr. McTighe was connected with the business.\r\n\r\nFollowing are a few of the firm names which the original house passed\r\nthrough before Mr. McTighe acquired the present business: Jackson &\r\nMarks, Marks & Bean, Bean & Company, McTighe, Truesdell & Davidge. Mr.\r\nMcTighe was a silent partner in the firm of Bean & Company, and was an\r\nactive partner in the firm which he later bought out and reorganized\r\nunder the present name of the McTighe Grocery Company, with offices and\r\nwarehouses at No. 69 Fayette Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. JOHN G. HARDY.\r\n\r\n  Of the William J. Feeley Company.\r\n\r\n  Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n  The Talented Sculptor of the Sullivan Memorial.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. McTighe had been prominent in political, religious and social\r\ncircles in this city for many years. In addition to his membership in\r\nthe American Irish Historical Society, he was a member of the Catholic\r\nClub of New York, the Knights of Columbus, and many other orders and\r\nsocieties. He was president of the local branch of the old Land League\r\nduring the season of its most effective work; a former president of the\r\nBinghamton Board of Trade for several years, and was a police\r\ncommissioner of that city. During the presidential election of 1892 Mr.\r\nMcTighe served as a presidential elector when Grover Cleveland was made\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nHe had been a devout communicant and a member of the board of trustees\r\nof St. Patrick’s Church since the time when this church was the only\r\nRoman Catholic edifice in Binghamton. Aside from being a moving spirit\r\nin the church proper he took a lively interest in the many branch\r\nsocieties of St. Patrick’s.\r\n\r\nHe is survived by his widow, whose maiden name was Miss Mary A.\r\nMcDonald; two sisters, Mrs. Anne Wall and Mrs. Mary Murphy; a nephew and\r\na niece, John and Florence McDonald, whom he brought up from childhood\r\nas his own children; two nephews, Patrick and John McTighe; and two\r\nnieces, Frances McTighe and Elizabeth Wall.\r\n\r\nMr. McTighe always kept green his memories of the “Ould Sod,” and was in\r\ntouch with all movements to better the condition of the Irish people.\r\nHis recent efforts to aid the Kerry fishermen were especially\r\npraiseworthy.\r\n\r\nMr. McTighe was the leader in the movement to raise the fund raised in\r\nBinghamton to aid the Quilty fishermen, who rescued the sailors of the\r\n_Leo XIII_ last autumn. The editor of _The Binghamton Press_ was made\r\ntreasurer of the fund, in recognition of the sermonette editorial, based\r\nupon the thrilling story of the wreck, while Mr. McTighe took active\r\ncharge of raising the money and sending it to Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn business Mr. McTighe was a hard worker and a keen, methodical\r\nbusiness man. He had the reputation everywhere of having a very high\r\nregard for his word. In his long life and connection with the grocery\r\nbusiness he was associated with many of the pioneers of Binghamton\r\nbusiness life and many of the old aristocrats of the business circle.\r\n\r\nHe was a well educated and well read man, being a scholar in Latin,\r\nSpanish, Celtic and French. He was always improving his mind, and, it is\r\nsaid, started in to learn Greek when past the age of sixty, finally\r\nmastering it so that he read it with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe decease of this estimable man has left vacant a place hard to fill,\r\nand the entire city of Binghamton was filled with sorrow at his sudden\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [_These blanks may be separated and used for membership application_]\r\n\r\n\r\n _To the EXECUTIVE COUNCIL of the AMERICAN-IRISH\r\n           HISTORICAL SOCIETY_:\r\n\r\n _Application for life/annual membership is hereby made by the\r\n    undersigned_\r\n\r\n      _Name_\r\n\r\n                                        (_Write legibly_)\r\n\r\n      _Address_\r\n\r\n      _Occupation_\r\n\r\n _Recommended by_\r\n\r\n\r\n _Application for membership must be accompanied by cheque for $50.00 for\r\n  life membership or $5.00 for annual membership, payable to Michael F.\r\n                       Dooley, Treasurer-General._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       MEMBERSHIP ROLL OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n             [For officers of the Society see pages 19–21.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ADAMS, HON.

He was born in\r\n  County Cavan, Ireland, 1842; came to this country when he was but ten\r\n  years of age, and spent much of his youth at East Dennis, Cape Cod,\r\n  Mass. His early love for the sea was gratified later in life when he\r\n  became captain of some of the finest deep-water ships sailing from\r\n  Baltimore, Boston and elsewhere. His first command was the bark _May\r\n  Queen_, a regular Baltimore and Rio packet, 1872. He then had command\r\n  of the ship _Pilgrim_ of Boston, and made several voyages to the East\r\n  Indies. In 1884 he was given command of the _Charger_, a larger and\r\n  finer ship than the _Pilgrim_, and sailed to ports in Japan. He next\r\n  had command of the _South American_, “the commodore’s ship,” of the\r\n  Hastings fleet (Boston), and took her to Australia and other parts. He\r\n  made several record voyages during his career, and some of these\r\n  records still stand, having never been equalled. On one occasion he\r\n  was wrecked off the coast of Africa; he and his wife upon being\r\n  rescued were hospitably entertained by the Boers of the adjacent\r\n  country. Returning to East Dennis, Mass., his wife’s health became\r\n  poor and so he removed with her to Coronado, Cal., hoping that the\r\n  change of climate would benefit her, but she died in 1901. She had\r\n  accompanied her husband on several of his voyages, and had with him\r\n  visited many parts of the world. Captain Connolly has written much and\r\n  entertainingly. He has at present in manuscript form a novel of ocean\r\n  life entitled “The Magic of the Sea”; is Vice-President of the Society\r\n  for California.\r\n\r\n  CONNOLLY, REV.

C., born in Lismore, County of\r\n  Waterford, Ireland, August 4, 1856, the son of John Corbett, a small\r\n  farmer and contractor; was educated in the national schools and\r\n  remained in Ireland until his eighteenth year, arriving in Wilmington,\r\n  N. C., March 28, 1878, where he has since resided. He entered the\r\n  commission business, and in due course became a partner in the firm of\r\n  W. I. Gore & Company; later, on the withdrawal of Mr. Gore, the\r\n  commission business, which had largely increased, was incorporated\r\n  under the name and style of The Corbett Company, under which the\r\n  business is now conducted. Mr. Corbett is one of the most potent\r\n  factors in the industrial life of Wilmington, and, in addition to the\r\n  successful conduct of his regular business, has been largely\r\n  instrumental in the promotion, organization and management of many\r\n  important and flourishing enterprises in Wilmington; is Vice-President\r\n  and one of the original directors of the People’s Savings Bank; one of\r\n  the original directors of the Murchison National Bank; President of\r\n  the Wilmington, Southport & Little River Company; member of the firm\r\n  of Stone & Company, and one of the Board of Managers of the James\r\n  Walker Memorial Hospital; is a member of the Cape Fear Club, Carolina\r\n  Yacht Club and Cape Fear Golf Club. In 1884 Mr. Corbett was married to\r\n  Miss Mary Josephine Deans, and to her inspiration and counsel\r\n  attributes in a large measure the credit for his success in life. The\r\n  union has been signally blessed, ten children having been born to\r\n  them, nine of whom are still living. Is Vice-President of the Society\r\n  for North Carolina.\r\n\r\n  COSGROVE, HON. JAMES, was born at Charleston, S. C., Aug. 28, 1861.\r\n  His father, a native of Bally Connell, County Cavan, Ireland, settled\r\n  in Charleston in February, 1839; became a prosperous merchant; was one\r\n  of the aldermen of the city for two terms and one of the\r\n  Representatives from Charleston County in the General Assembly of\r\n  South Carolina in 1874–’75. His mother was Catherine Daily. The family\r\n  have been Charlestonians for over seventy years and during this period\r\n  father and son have been closely identified with the commercial and\r\n  political life of the community. Mr. Cosgrove attended first a private\r\n  school, then the parochial school attached to St. Finbar’s Cathedral\r\n  and later the high school of Charleston, where he was graduated at the\r\n  age of sixteen years. He then went into his father’s office and later\r\n  established himself in the real estate and general insurance business,\r\n  which he still successfully conducts. About twenty years ago he became\r\n  interested in the experiments conducted by Sir Patrick Manson, an\r\n  Irishman, Leveran, a Frenchman, and the Italians Celli, Golgi and\r\n  Bignam, concerning the inoculation of the human body with the virus of\r\n  malaria fever by the bite of a species of the mosquito known as the\r\n  “Anopheles.” He followed the investigations closely and as a result of\r\n  what was proven commenced agitation for the drainage of wet and low\r\n  lands of the United States, to remove breeding places of this species\r\n  of insect. At that time there was a “death line” around the coastal\r\n  section of the Southern States and many other sections of the United\r\n  States, within which line it was thought to be dangerous to live in\r\n  the summer for fear of malarial fever. At first his efforts met with\r\n  poor success, and in 1898 he determined to become a candidate for the\r\n  State Legislature to have enacted legislation necessary for the proper\r\n  and systematic drainage of the wet lands of South Carolina. He was\r\n  re-elected in 1900, but such was the opposition to the new movement\r\n  that not until 1902 did he succeed in having created for Charleston\r\n  County “The Sanitary and Drainage Commission.” Indeed, it required a\r\n  man of the most untiring industry and indomitable will to have\r\n  successfully carried his purpose during these four years of\r\n  antagonism. The work of sanitary drainage in Charleston County was\r\n  commenced under the direction of this commission, but it was soon\r\n  found that it absolutely required some one to take the direction of\r\n  the work who would be willing to sacrifice his self-interest for the\r\n  good of the public. The commissioners, comprising some of the best\r\n  citizens of the city, with one accord turned to Mr. Cosgrove and\r\n  requested him to take entire direction. He did so, and has since\r\n  remained in charge. The result is that thousands of acres of fertile\r\n  lands have been made habitable, affording dwelling places, and\r\n  manufacturing enterprises have been inaugurated, affording employment\r\n  to thousands on land, which a few years ago was worthless. In 1902 Mr.\r\n  Cosgrove was defeated for re-election by a small majority, owing to\r\n  opposition to the idea of drainage. He determined to retire from\r\n  politics, but in 1906, answering the call of his people as voiced in\r\n  leading editorials in the press of Charleston, he consented to again\r\n  become a candidate and was elected by a flattering vote and re-elected\r\n  by a still larger vote in 1908. He is chairman of the Charleston\r\n  Delegation in the House of Representatives and chairman of the\r\n  Committee on Banking and Insurance. Mr. Cosgrove’s efforts in behalf\r\n  of the drainage of the low lands of the United States have been\r\n  recognized by his appointment as member of the Executive Committee of\r\n  the National Drainage Congress and Honorary Vice-President of the\r\n  Seventeenth National Irrigation Congress. As a corollary of his\r\n  drainage work, Mr. Cosgrove has been giving much attention to the\r\n  subject of good roads, and has now on the calendar of the Legislature\r\n  a measure providing for state aid to the building of good roads. In\r\n  1885 Mr. Cosgrove was married to Miss Mathilde Griffith Forsythe,\r\n  daughter of a prominent and wealthy dry goods merchant of Charleston.\r\n\r\n  COUGHLIN, JOHN, 177 Water Street, Augusta, Me.\r\n\r\n  COX, HUGH M., M.

Davies and Rebecca Tappan Davies, was born in New York City, March\r\n  21, 1842. He received a collegiate education at Trinity College,\r\n  Hartford, Conn., from which he graduated in 1860. He also studied at\r\n  the University of Leipsic, Germany. Mr. Davies read law with Slosson,\r\n  Hutchins and Platt, and was admitted to the bar in May, 1863, and at\r\n  once entered earnestly upon the pursuit of the profession his father\r\n  had so greatly adorned. During the Civil War, then raging, he served\r\n  in the Twenty-second Regiment, New York Militia, during the Gettysburg\r\n  campaign. Mr. Davies’ first partnership in practice was formed with\r\n  Henry H. Anderson, but on August 1, 1866, the partnership was\r\n  dissolved, and Mr. Davies entered the service of the Mutual Life\r\n  Insurance Company of New York. The law department of that corporation\r\n  was fully organized in September, 1870, with Mr. Pruyn as solicitor\r\n  and Mr. Davies as his assistant. He remained in that position until\r\n  May 20, 1885, at which time he became the head of the department.\r\n  During the succeeding quarter of a century Mr. Davies, as counsel for\r\n  one of the leading insurance companies, was largely instrumental in\r\n  establishing rules of law on insurance matters as they exist today. He\r\n  resigned in December, 1893, in order to resume the active practice of\r\n  his profession. He was one of the commissioners on the widening of Elm\r\n  Street, New York, and extending the street from Great Jones Street to\r\n  the City Hall. Mr. Davies joined the American Irish Historical Society\r\n  in 1898 and is a member of the New York Historical Society, the New\r\n  York Biographical and Genealogical Society, the Medicolegal Society,\r\n  the New England Society, the Society of the Sons of the Revolution,\r\n  the New England Historical Genealogical Society, the Virginia\r\n  Historical Society, the Phi Beta Kappa Alumni Association, the\r\n  Liederkranz Society, the Society of Colonial Wars, the Century\r\n  Association, and the Union University Lawyers, Manhattan, Tuxedo,\r\n  Grolier, Democratic and St. Nicholas Clubs.

He is unmarried.\r\n\r\n  DIXON, RICHARD, insurance, 52–54 William Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  DIXON, SAMUEL GIBSON, M. D., LL. D., Bryn Mawr, Pa., was born of\r\n  Quaker parentage in the city of Philadelphia in the family homestead\r\n  below Bartram’s Botanical Gardens, March 23, 1851. His early education\r\n  was received at the Friends’ Schools in that city and was supplemented\r\n  by private tutors, by whom he was prepared for Harvard College. His\r\n  health failing, however, he went abroad for recreation and study.\r\n  Returning home he set himself to acquire a thorough knowledge of\r\n  business principles, taking a course at the Mercantile College. On the\r\n  conclusion of this he studied conveyancing under the late Edward\r\n  Bedlock of Philadelphia. He then studied law in the office of his\r\n  brother, Edwin Saunders Dixon, Esq., attended the law course of the\r\n  University of Pennsylvania, and was admitted to practice at the bar of\r\n  Philadelphia June 30, 1877, continuing in the active practice of that\r\n  profession for ten years. The practice of law left him with\r\n  trusteeships of importance which have necessarily kept him well to the\r\n  front in affairs. Under the stress of desk and office work his health\r\n  again failed, and his tastes inclining him to make a hobby of\r\n  scientific medicine he matriculated in the Medical Department of the\r\n  University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, from which he was\r\n  graduated with honor in 1886. While still an undergraduate, however,\r\n  he received the unusual compliment of an appointment by the trustees\r\n  to the position of Assistant Demonstrator of Physiology. During his\r\n  last year in the medical school he suffered from a serious attack of\r\n  typhoid fever, which made a foreign trip again desirable in the\r\n  opinion of his physicians. Being greatly interested in the infant\r\n  science of bacteriology, as soon as his strength permitted, he entered\r\n  the Bacteriological Department of King’s College, London, from which\r\n  he was graduated. He also took a course in the College of State\r\n  Medicine, London, under Professor Klein, and it was while prosecuting\r\n  observations under that master in bacteriology that he made the\r\n  discovery of branched forms of tubercle bacilli hitherto unnoticed. He\r\n  also studied under Pottenkofer, in Munich, and made a careful study of\r\n  the methods of filtration of water and disposition of sewage then in\r\n  vogue in the capitals of Great Britain and Europe. Returning to\r\n  Philadelphia in 1888, his alma mater recognized the value of his\r\n  attainments by appointing him the first Professor of Hygiene in the\r\n  newly created chair in the Medical Department, and also Dean of the\r\n  Auxiliary Department of Medicine. While in this position he embraced\r\n  the opportunity to establish the first Laboratory of Hygiene in the\r\n  University. Two years later he resigned these positions to accept the\r\n  appointment of Professor of Bacteriology and Microscopical Technology\r\n  at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, of which\r\n  institution he became Executive Curator in 1892 and President in 1896.\r\n  During this period his mind reverted constantly to the problem of the\r\n  branched tubercle bacillus and the possibility which he had conceived\r\n  of obtaining immunity to that disease by the introduction into the\r\n  human economy of attenuated bacilli or of fluid extracts from the\r\n  same, and he prosecuted original researches on this subject\r\n  untiringly. On October 19, 1889, he published in the _Medical News_ of\r\n  Philadelphia the results which he had then reached in producing\r\n  immunity to that disease in the lower animals, and has constantly kept\r\n  the profession informed of his investigations by means of addresses\r\n  and contributions to medical and scientific journals. The two theses\r\n  or propositions on which he based this theory of possible immunity to\r\n  the tubercle bacillus are as follows: “First. It is possible that by a\r\n  thorough filtering out of bacilli from tubercular material a filtrate\r\n  might be obtained and attenuated so that by systematic inoculations a\r\n  change might be produced in living animal tissues that would enable\r\n  them to resist virulent tubercle bacilli. Second. To bring about a\r\n  chemical or physical change in living tissues that would resist\r\n  tubercular phthisis it is possible that inoculations with the bacillus\r\n  would have to be made; yet, before this could be done, the power of\r\n  the virulent bacilli would have to be diminished; otherwise the result\r\n  would be most disastrous.” In the autumn of 1890, Doctor Dixon,\r\n  inspired by the announcement of Professor Koch that he had succeeded\r\n  in developing a substance which possessed the power of preventing the\r\n  growth of the tubercle bacillus in the human economy, again visited\r\n  Europe in order to assure himself of the accuracy of the reports and\r\n  in the interest of humanity as well as of the various scientific and\r\n  medical institutions with which he was connected, and had interviews\r\n  with Koch, Virchow and Dubois Raymond. That Doctor Dixon has always\r\n  recognized the claims of the community as a whole on members of his\r\n  profession is sufficiently proven by the fact that he is officially\r\n  connected with so large a number of scientific, philanthropic and\r\n  educational institutions. He has been for eighteen years Executive\r\n  Curator of the Philadelphia Academy of the Natural Sciences, and for\r\n  fourteen years its President. For a number of years he was a member of\r\n  the Board of Education of the city of Philadelphia an as Chairman of\r\n  the Committee on Hygiene devoted much time to improving the sanitary\r\n  condition of the schools. He is an officer of the Ludwick Institute,\r\n  the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in Pennsylvania, the\r\n  Zoological Society of Philadelphia and the Grandom Institution, a\r\n  member of the Council of the American Philosophical Society and of the\r\n  Historical Society of Pennsylvania, a director of the Wistar Institute\r\n  of Anatomy of the University of Pennsylvania, a Fellow of the College\r\n  of Physicians of Philadelphia, a member of the American Medical\r\n  Association, the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania, the\r\n  Philadelphia County Medical Society, the American Association for the\r\n  Advancement of Science and the American Archeological and Asiatic\r\n  Society, and one of the originators of the Geographical Society of\r\n  Philadelphia. An enthusiast on field sports from his early boyhood,\r\n  many of his vacations have been spent in salmon and trout fishing and\r\n  the hunting of big game. He has been an enthusiastic and successful\r\n  breeder of choice cattle and sporting dogs. He is a member of the\r\n  American Kennel Club, of which he was the first Secretary, and\r\n  President of the Philadelphia Kennel Club. Among the social clubs of\r\n  the country he is a member of the Philadelphia Club, the Merion\r\n  Cricket Club, the University Club, the Tarrantine Golf Club and the\r\n  Radnor Hunt.\r\n\r\n  DOLAN, JAMES A., 346 Broadway, New York City.\r\n\r\n  DOLAN, THOMAS E., M.

Doyle & Sons, 45 William Street, New York\r\n  City. (Life member of the Society and a member of its Executive\r\n  Council.) Mr. Doyle is the senior member of the real estate firm of\r\n  John F. Doyle & Sons. He was born in New York City, 1837, a son of\r\n  James Doyle, who participated in the Irish revolution of 1798, and who\r\n  came to the United States early in 1806. This James Doyle, the\r\n  immigrant, had a son who was killed in the Florida war of 1837, and a\r\n  grandson who fell in 1861, fighting for the Union. John F. Doyle, the\r\n  subject of this sketch and member of the Society, entered the law\r\n  office of Alexander Hamilton, grandson of the first Secretary of the\r\n  Treasury, afterwards the firm of Hamilton, Rives & Rogers, and\r\n  remained with them from 1853 to 1869, in the meantime studying law and\r\n  being admitted to the bar in 1862. Alexander Hamilton, Francis R.\r\n  Rives, a son of William C. Rives, of Virginia, at one time minister to\r\n  France and senator, and Nathan Pendleton Rogers, all of the old\r\n  Revolutionary stock, were members of the firm. Mr. Doyle’s management\r\n  of some Wall Street properties for them at this period became so\r\n  conspicuous that he was urged by them to assume the management of\r\n  their estates, which he did. Shortly afterwards followed the\r\n  acquisition of the estates of such well-known people as Mrs. Harriet\r\n  L. Langdon, granddaughter-in-law of the first John Jacob Astor, John\r\n  Pyne March, Mrs. Morgan L. Livingston, George L. Schuyler, James M.\r\n  Pendleton, A. Newbold Morris, James H. Jones, John Steward, Jr., Royal\r\n  Phelps, deceased, Royal Phelps Carroll, Robert S. Minturn, estate of\r\n  Gertrude L. Lowndes, deceased, William H. King, of Newport, R. I., and\r\n  others too numerous to mention in detail. A feature of his career as a\r\n  successful manager lies in the fact that the business associations and\r\n  connections formed by him in the beginning are still held intact.\r\n  Among the notable sales made by him are those from William H. Morris\r\n  to John Jacob Astor in 1880 conveying 150 acres of lots in the\r\n  twenty-third ward on and adjacent to Harlem River; the great sale of\r\n  South Brooklyn lots at Gowanus Bay in 1884. Mr. Doyle represents today\r\n  the same old and well-known families and estates represented by him so\r\n  many years ago. During his career Mr. Doyle has met and done business\r\n  with some of the most notable men connected with families famous in\r\n  American history, such as three of the four sons of the first\r\n  Alexander Hamilton, Admiral Farragut, Capt. Percival Drayton, Rawlins\r\n  Lowndes, of South Carolina, William C. Rives, U. S. senator from\r\n  Virginia, at one time minister to France, George L. Schuyler, grandson\r\n  of Philip Schuyler, and owner of the famous yacht _America_, Philip\r\n  Schuyler, his son, Henry Grinnell of Arctic fame, Robert J. and\r\n  Mortimer Livingston, Hon. John Lee Carroll, Commodore Wm. K.\r\n  Vanderbilt, and scores of others equally well known, besides\r\n  representing branches now of four lineal descendants of signers of the\r\n  Declaration of Independence. His two sons, Col. John F. Doyle, Jr.,\r\n  and Alfred L. Doyle, have been with him in business for years past and\r\n  all three enjoy an enviable reputation for integrity, ability and\r\n  prudence in all their undertakings.\r\n\r\n  DOYLE, COL.

Was born on the corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly\r\n  Place, New York City, April 27, 1859, of Irish parents, who though\r\n  born and brought up in Dublin did not meet till they reached New York,\r\n  where in due course they were married in the old St. Joseph’s Church\r\n  on lower Sixth Avenue. Mr. Farrell was educated at St. Francis’\r\n  College, conducted in Brooklyn by the Franciscan Brothers, and after\r\n  graduating therefrom obtained a position as clerk with a Spanish firm\r\n  whose business it was to import corks and corkwood. On the death of\r\n  his employers he succeeded to the business, which he has carried on\r\n  ever since, having branch houses in Cataluna and Andalucia.

C., to Palatka, Fla.; bought out the business in 1877;\r\n  founded the house of John Flannery & Company; became director and\r\n  President of the Southern Bank of the State of Georgia; is\r\n  ex-President of the Southern Cotton Exchange; captain, 1872–’98, of\r\n  the Jasper Greens.\r\n\r\n  FLYNN, COL. DAVID M., Princeton, N. J., is cashier of the First\r\n  National Bank of Princeton. He is probably the youngest officer in the\r\n  National Guard of New Jersey to hold the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel,\r\n  being only thirty-three years of age, born in Princeton in 1876. In\r\n  the Guard, as well as in business life, Colonel Flynn has come up from\r\n  the ranks. He was one of the moving spirits in the organization of\r\n  Company L of the Second Regiment, which has distinguished itself on\r\n  the rifle range at Sea Girt. He enlisted in the company as a private\r\n  in 1900; was made a corporal in 1901, battalion sergeant-major in\r\n  1903; re-enlisted in 1905; was made captain and paymaster of the\r\n  Second Brigade by Colonel Collins December 10, 1906; major and\r\n  paymaster, Second Brigade, December 10, 1907, and major and inspector\r\n  of small arms practice, July 9, 1908. Colonel Flynn’s success in a\r\n  business way has been as remarkable and gratifying as his military\r\n  success. Owing to the death of his father, he began work in a store at\r\n  the age of thirteen, where by his industry and integrity he attracted\r\n  attention to himself. He studied at night, and when nineteen years of\r\n  age passed a United States civil service examination, and was named\r\n  registry clerk in the Princeton postoffice, which position he held\r\n  until about ten years ago, when he was chosen teller of the First\r\n  National Bank. Later he was made cashier of the bank and he has more\r\n  than made good. Since his connection with the bank the number of\r\n  depositors has more than tripled and the deposits have more than\r\n  doubled. Colonel Flynn possesses an attribute valuable in all walks of\r\n  life, but more especially in the banking world—he has never touched\r\n  liquor of any kind. He is Treasurer of the Citizens’ Association,\r\n  Treasurer of the Princeton Militia Company, Treasurer of the Princeton\r\n  Fish and Game Association, chairman of the Committee on Collections of\r\n  the New Jersey Bankers’ Association, Past Grand Knight of the Knights\r\n  of Columbus and is publisher of the _Bankers’ Loose Leaf Discount\r\n  Ledger_.\r\n\r\n  FOGARTY, JAMES A., 264 Blatchley Avenue, New Haven, Conn., recently a\r\n  police commissioner of New Haven.\r\n\r\n  FOGARTY, JEREMIAH W., Assessing Department, Registry of Deeds, City\r\n  Hall, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n  FORD, HON.

FRANCIS P., Assistant District Attorney, 23 Fifth Avenue,\r\n  New York City.\r\n\r\n  GARVAN, HON. PATRICK, 236 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, Conn. (A life\r\n  member of the Society and a member of the Executive Council.) He was\r\n  born in Ireland March 8, 1836, and came to this country in May, 1851,\r\n  and since 1852 has resided in Hartford. At the age of twenty-one Mr.\r\n  Garvan began his business career as a contractor and builder and\r\n  continued at the same for a period of twenty-one years. Many of the\r\n  public buildings and churches east of the Connecticut River were built\r\n  by him during this time. He was also a partner in a paper and paper\r\n  stock business carried on in Hartford under the name of E. J. Carroll\r\n  & Company. From 1877 to 1906, having purchased the interest of Mr.\r\n  Carroll, he conducted under his own name a paper and paper stock\r\n  business exclusively. In 1906 the business was incorporated under the\r\n  name of P. Garvan, Inc., and is at the present time carried on under\r\n  that name. It has grown to such proportion that at the present time it\r\n  occupies four warehouses on State Street in Hartford, with offices at\r\n  205 and 207 State Street, and one large storage plant at Holyoke,\r\n  Mass. Recently the firm has opened offices at 261 Broadway, New York\r\n  City, and its interests are cared for by Thomas F. Garvan, who has\r\n  been associated with his father for eighteen years. Mr. Garvan is also\r\n  identified with several mills, being President of the Eastern Straw\r\n  Board Company at Versailles, Conn., Hartford Board Company of\r\n  Hartford, Conn., and the Newington Paper Company of Newington, Conn.\r\n  Three of his sons, Thomas F., Edward J., and John S., are associated\r\n  in business with him. Mr. Garvan has always been a staunch Republican.\r\n  During his residence in East Hartford he held many positions of honor\r\n  and trust, having been chairman of the School Board of that town for\r\n  twelve years; was President of both Village Improvement and Street\r\n  Lighting Associations; trustee and Treasurer of the Raymond Library,\r\n  and for several years chairman of the Republican Town Committee. In\r\n  1884 he represented the town in the House of Representatives, and was\r\n  re-elected as its first representative in 1885, serving as chairman of\r\n  the School Fund Committee of that year, and as a member of the Finance\r\n  Committee in 1884. In 1890 he was elected State Senator from the\r\n  Second Senatorial District by the largest Republican majority given\r\n  any candidate in this district up to that time. For some years\r\n  previous to 1894 he was a member of the Republican State Central\r\n  Committee from the Second District, but resigned that office upon his\r\n  removal to Hartford. He was selected by the Connecticut Convention as\r\n  a delegate to the Republican Convention at Chicago which nominated\r\n  President Taft. When the Park Department of this city was reorganized,\r\n  the Legislature provided for the appointment of a commission to have\r\n  sole charge of this important work. Mr. Garvan was named as one of the\r\n  commissioners for the term of ten years. The Board of Park\r\n  Commissioners particularly entrusted to Commissioner Garvan the\r\n  purchase of lands for and the development of Riverside Park. In 1898,\r\n  as President of this board, he delivered the dedicatory address at the\r\n  services attending the opening of Riverside Park to the public. This\r\n  park has become one of the most useful pleasure grounds in this city,\r\n  giving, as it does, a place of recreation and rest for the poorer\r\n  classes and children of the East Side. Mr. Garvan has always taken a\r\n  great interest in educational matters, three of his sons having\r\n  graduated from Yale University and his daughters having finished their\r\n  educations abroad. Two of his sons entered the profession of law,\r\n  Frank P. Garvan, the present Assistant District Attorney of New York,\r\n  and Edward J. Garvan, who was Judge of the Hartford Police Court for\r\n  five years. The latter is now identified with his father’s business\r\n  interests. Mr. Garvan enjoys the respect and esteem of a very wide\r\n  circle of friends and acquaintances, not only throughout the State of\r\n  Connecticut, but wherever his large business interests extend. He is a\r\n  self-made, practical business man, cautious, conservative and strictly\r\n  honorable in all his dealings, and through his native genius and his\r\n  untiring energy he has been uniformly successful in all his business\r\n  affairs. He is now a director of St. Francis Hospital, director of the\r\n  State Bank and the Riverside Trust Company; is a trustee of the\r\n  Society for Savings at Hartford and of the Cathedral parish, Hartford.\r\n  In January, 1861, Mr. Garvan married Miss Mary A. Carroll of East\r\n  Hartford, and ten children were born to them, eight of whom, four sons\r\n  and four daughters, are living at the present time. His wife died in\r\n  September, 1906.\r\n\r\n  GELSHENEN, WILLIAM H., 100 William Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  GEOGHEGAN, CHARLES A., 537–539 West Broadway, New York City.\r\n\r\n  GEOGHEGAN, JOSEPH, Salt Lake City, Utah.

D., Rutland, Vt., a native of County Limerick,\r\n  Ireland; was graduated in medicine from the University of the City of\r\n  New York, 1867; in June, 1861, he was, on examination (not having\r\n  graduated), appointed surgeon in the United States Navy, and served\r\n  through the entire Civil War. The vessels on which he served did duty\r\n  mostly on the rivers of Virginia and North Carolina, where he served\r\n  with the army as well as the navy, thereby having the benefit and\r\n  experience of both branches of the service, especially in the surgical\r\n  line. In August, 1863, the vessel on which he was serving was captured\r\n  at the mouth of the Rappahannock River and all on board made\r\n  prisoners. They were taken overland to Richmond where they were\r\n  confined in Libby Prison. At that time the Confederates were very\r\n  short of surgeons and medical supplies, and he was asked if he would\r\n  go over to Belle Island and attend the Union prisoners. After\r\n  consulting his fellow-prisoners he consented, and for six weeks he\r\n  attended the sick and wounded Union prisoners faithfully, under very\r\n  great disadvantages, as the appliances were very limited. After that\r\n  he was paroled. While a prisoner of war he was treated with the\r\n  greatest courtesy and consideration by the medical staff and officers\r\n  of the Confederacy.

D., 130 East Twenty-seventh Street, New York\r\n  City.\r\n\r\n  KELLY, JOHN FORREST, PH. D., Pittsfield, Mass.; born near\r\n  Carrick-on-Suir, Ireland. He was educated in Stevens Institute of\r\n  Technology, Hoboken, N. J., received the degree of B. L. in 1878 and\r\n  that of Ph. D. in 1881. His first occupation was as assistant to\r\n  Thomas A. Edison, in Menlo Park laboratory, his work then principally\r\n  relating to the chemistry of rare earths. Late in 1879 Mr. Kelly\r\n  became electrical engineer of the New York branch of the Western\r\n  Electric Company. This was the time when the telephone was being\r\n  generally introduced, and when dynamos were being first applied to\r\n  telegraphic purposes. In the construction and installment of\r\n  instruments for telegraphy and telephones and of such measuring\r\n  instruments as were then known, Mr. Kelly received a thorough\r\n  training. In 1882 he became laboratory assistant to Edward Weston,\r\n  then chief electrician of the United States Electric Lighting Company,\r\n  and, with the exception of a year which he spent in connection with\r\n  the Remingtons, Mr. Kelly continued his association with Mr. Weston\r\n  until July, 1886. Some of the most important work, such as the\r\n  research which ended in the discovery of high resistance alloys of\r\n  very low or even negative temperature co-efficients, were\r\n  substantially carried out by Mr. Kelly under general directions from\r\n  Mr. Weston, whom Mr. Kelly succeeded as chief electrician of the\r\n  United States Electric Lighting Company, which, in 1889, passed to the\r\n  Westinghouse interests; but Mr. Kelly retained his position as chief\r\n  electrician until January, 1892, when he resigned to join William\r\n  Stanley in experimental work. The work done by Mr. Kelly, in this\r\n  connection, gave a great impetus to the alternating current business.\r\n  Mr. Kelly’s inventive work is partially represented by eighty patents.\r\n  The art of building transformers and generators of alternating\r\n  currents was revolutionized, and Mr. Kelly and his colleagues were the\r\n  first to put polyphase motors into actual commercial service. That\r\n  success naturally led to long-distance transmission work, and the\r\n  first long-distance transmission plants in California (indeed the\r\n  first in the world), were undertaken on Mr. Kelly’s recommendation and\r\n  advice. He was the first to make a hysteretically stable steel, a\r\n  matter of vastly more importance than the comparatively spectacular\r\n  transmission work. Mr. Kelly at present occupies the position of\r\n  President of the John F. Kelly Engineering Company, President of the\r\n  Cokel Company and President of the Telelectric Company, as well as\r\n  President of the Conchas River Power Company and director of the\r\n  Southwestern Exploration Company. The Cokel Company is organized to\r\n  exploit the invention of Mr. E. W. Cooke, by means of which foodstuffs\r\n  may be perfectly dehydrated, losing on the average ninety per cent in\r\n  weight. Foods dehydrated by this process, although free from all\r\n  chemical preservatives, are entirely stable, and yet preserve their\r\n  pristine freshness through extremes of temperature, and when served\r\n  are indistinguishable from fresh foods of the ordinary type. The\r\n  Telelectric Company is organized for the manufacture of electric piano\r\n  players, which are either entirely automatic or entirely controllable\r\n  at will. Mr. Kelly was married to Miss Helen Fischer, in New York\r\n  City, in 1892, and they have two children—Eoghan and Domnall. Mr.\r\n  Kelly is a thorough and unswerving Irish Nationalist, and his splendid\r\n  generosity to the cause is well-known.\r\n\r\n  KELLY, JOSEPH THOMAS, was born at Enniskeen, County Cavan, Ireland,\r\n  January 3, 1887, and is the son of William and Anne (O’Connor) Kelly.\r\n  Removed in August, 1893, to New Haven, Conn.; in October, 1895, to\r\n  Union City, Conn.; in April, 1900, returned to New Haven. Educated in\r\n  Irish National Schools and in the public and parochial schools of the\r\n  United States; was graduated in 1903 from Hillhouse High School, New\r\n  Haven. In July, 1903, entered the employ of the New York, New Haven\r\n  and Hartford Railroad Company as a stenographer; and is at present\r\n  Secretary to the general counsel of that company.

He\r\n  received his early educational training from the Christian Brothers in\r\n  his native town and at St. Colman’s College, Fermoy. From early\r\n  boyhood he exhibited tokens of more than ordinary talents. He was fond\r\n  of books, particularly those on ancient and modern history, literature\r\n  and biography. He is today probably one of the best read men in\r\n  Anglo-Irish literature and Irish history in America; but he is by no\r\n  means less informed on the history, literature and politics of his\r\n  adopted country, for he is an American to the very backbone, and is\r\n  proud of his citizenship. He came to America in 1883, and lost no time\r\n  in becoming a full-fledged American citizen, immediately after which\r\n  he affiliated himself with the Democratic party. He had only been a\r\n  citizen two weeks when, during the presidential campaign of 1888, he\r\n  was placed on the list of campaign speakers by the Democratic State\r\n  Committee of New York. In the early nineties, he was an expert debater\r\n  in the leading literary societies of New York. Previous to that, he\r\n  was a member of the Young Men’s Congress of Boston. He is also a\r\n  writer and lecturer of ability. His lectures on “Christian Education,”\r\n  “The Golden Age of Ireland,” “Charles Carroll, of Carrollton,” “The\r\n  American Stage,” “General Thomas Francis Meagher,” “Irishmen in the\r\n  American Revolution,” “Jefferson and Lincoln,” “The Catholic Chapter\r\n  in American History,” “The Irish Renaissance,” “St. Brendan, America’s\r\n  First Discoverer,” “Christian Democracy,” “Wendell Phillips,”\r\n  “Socialism and Individualism” and “Newfoundland and Her People,” are\r\n  masterpieces. His eulogy on Leo XIII is a classic. Mr. Lonergan has\r\n  been with the _New York World_ for the past fifteen years, and is at\r\n  present manager of the Bronx office. He possesses not only literary\r\n  but executive abilities of a high order. During his residence in the\r\n  Bronx he has made hosts of friends and is well liked by all with whom\r\n  he comes in contact.\r\n\r\n  LOUGHLIN, PETER J., 150 Nassau Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  LOVELL, DAVID B., M.

R. F., 82 Court Street, Binghamton, N. Y.; a commissioner\r\n  of the department of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\n  MCCARTHY, HON. PATRICK JOSEPH, Mayor of the city of Providence, R. I.,\r\n  1907 and 1908. Was born in County Sligo, Ireland, 1848, and was about\r\n  two years of age when his parents, Patrick and Alice (Cullen)\r\n  McCarthy, crossed the ocean. But they were destined to never reach the\r\n  mainland of free America, for both father and mother died while\r\n  waiting in quarantine, at Deer Island, Boston Harbor. Patrick J. was\r\n  the youngest of seven sons. He became the ward of a society connected\r\n  with the Catholic Cathedral in Boston, and remained with this society\r\n  until he was eight years old. During this time he attended the public\r\n  schools. Winters of following years, until he was fourteen, he\r\n  attended day school in Somerville, Mass., and night school at\r\n  Cambridge. About this time Professor Charles Elliot Norton, and some\r\n  of his college associates, one of whom was Charles William Eliot,\r\n  ex-President of Harvard University, organized a night school in old\r\n  Cambridge for working boys, and admitted boys residing in Somerville.\r\n  Advantage of this opportunity was taken and whenever speaking of this\r\n  period of his life, Mayor McCarthy expresses his admiration and\r\n  gratitude for Professor Norton. It was this association with true men\r\n  that did more to mould his character and direct his mind and thoughts\r\n  in the right direction than any other influence of his youth. In 1863\r\n  he removed to Providence, and while making his home with his brother\r\n  learned the trade of brass finisher. His ambition was to become master\r\n  of a business on his own account, and encouraged by a few successful\r\n  ventures in real estate, determined to qualify himself for business in\r\n  a proper manner. Realizing that a knowledge of law would be of great\r\n  advantage to him, he read and studied Blackstone’s and Kent’s\r\n  Commentaries on Law and made up his mind to choose law as a profession\r\n  instead of engaging in business, and after suitable preparation\r\n  entered the Law School of Harvard University. His accumulated savings\r\n  supported him during the time of the course of study, and he graduated\r\n  with the degree of LL. B. in 1876. Returning to Providence, Mr.\r\n  McCarthy was admitted to the Bar of Rhode Island. He was soon\r\n  possessed of a good clientage, and later was admitted to the Circuit\r\n  Court and Supreme Court of the United States. Being an ardent reader\r\n  and endowed with histrionic ability, the stage appealed to him, and\r\n  his evenings were spent in the congenial society of those interested\r\n  in amateur theatricals, Shakespearian readings, etc., and\r\n  notwithstanding his preference for serious characters, was frequently\r\n  cast for the comedian’s part. In 1875 he married Miss Anne M.\r\n  McGinney, of Providence, but this happy union was of short duration,\r\n  as she died in 1880, leaving one of three children, Mary Josephine,\r\n  wife of William H. Bannon, of Central Falls, R. I., surviving her.\r\n  Although a Democrat, Mr. McCarthy has always been a firm believer in\r\n  the principles of equitable protection, reciprocity and sound money.\r\n  He was frequently urged to accept nomination for various public\r\n  offices, but persistently declined until the fall of 1889, when he was\r\n  nominated on a fusion ticket and elected to the Providence City\r\n  Council, where he served during the years 1890–1892 and 1894. In 1891,\r\n  1892 and 1903 he was elected to the House of Representatives of Rhode\r\n  Island, and made a good record in the Legislature. He was opposed to\r\n  granting special privileges to public service corporations without\r\n  adequate compensation to the public for franchises in public highways.\r\n  In November, 1906, he was elected Mayor of the city of Providence, and\r\n  the best tribute to his first year’s record in that office is that he\r\n  was re-elected in 1907 by a greatly increased plurality. While Mayor\r\n  McCarthy is a firm believer in the principles of Democracy and\r\n  appreciative of the honors the Democratic party has conferred on him,\r\n  he has always felt it to be his first duty to observe the wishes of\r\n  the people as a whole, rather than those of a party or faction. He has\r\n  been fearless in his disregard of partisanship and has won the respect\r\n  and admiration of all good citizens by his official acts as Mayor. Mr.\r\n  McCarthy is a many-sided man. As an official he is conspicuously\r\n  successful. He has always represented the whole people, and never\r\n  attempted to gain favor by the sacrifice of principle. He is a sound\r\n  lawyer, enjoying the respect of the Court and the confidence of his\r\n  clients. Better than that, he is a true friend, warm-hearted,\r\n  clear-headed and helpful, and a loyal, patriotic American citizen.\r\n  Address, 49 Westminster Street, Providence, R. I.

Mr. McClure was admitted to the bar in December, 1869, in New\r\n  York City, where he has since resided. His practice has brought him\r\n  very prominently before the courts and public during the last\r\n  thirty-six years as counsel in cases which have attracted much\r\n  attention. He has been counsel in many contested will cases, including\r\n  those of Merrill, Schuyler Skatts, Charles B. Beck and Mary Johnson.\r\n  In the Livingston, De Meli and General Burnside litigation he was also\r\n  prominent. He has been connected with many large corporation\r\n  foreclosure suits, including those of the Denver Water Company, the\r\n  New York & Northern Railroad Company, Omaha Water Company, the Toledo,\r\n  Ann Arbor & Northern Michigan, the Northern Pacific, the New York,\r\n  Lake Erie & Western, the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company, the\r\n  Oregon Improvement Company, the Chicago & Northern Pacific Company,\r\n  the Bankers and Merchants’ Telegraph Company, and the Memphis &\r\n  Charleston Railroad Company. He is regarded as one of the most\r\n  successful trial lawyers at the bar in New York. Mr. McClure for more\r\n  than a quarter of a century has been counsel for the Farmers Loan &\r\n  Trust Company, the oldest and largest trust company in the United\r\n  States, organized in 1821; and for many years of the Consolidated Gas\r\n  Company, one of the largest public service corporations in the\r\n  country. He is also counsel for the West Side Savings Bank, several\r\n  fire insurance companies and other banks. He was one of the counsel\r\n  for the Mutual Life Insurance Company during the presidency of F. S.\r\n  Winston. For years he was a director in the Lawyers Surety Company,\r\n  and he is on the board of the Title Insurance Company of New York. He\r\n  was a prominent and active member of the State Constitution Convention\r\n  of 1894, in which body he introduced and carried through the amendment\r\n  providing for protection of the forests of New York. He years ago\r\n  declined elevation to the bench of the Court of Appeals, the highest\r\n  court in the state of New York, and several times to other positions;\r\n  also appointment to the offices of corporation counsel of the city of\r\n  New York, and district attorney of the United States. Mr. McClure was\r\n  appointed, in 1893, receiver of the National Bank of Deposit, in the\r\n  city of New York, and in spite of the stringent financial condition\r\n  which prevailed during the summer of that year, dividends aggregating\r\n  seventy-five per cent were paid within three months. The entire\r\n  indebtedness, principal and interest, was paid and the receivership\r\n  closed out within one year. In 1892 he was a delegate from the State\r\n  of New York to the National Democratic Convention which, at Chicago,\r\n  nominated Grover Cleveland as candidate for the office of President of\r\n  the United States, and during the campaign of that year he was much\r\n  discussed by the press of New York as the probable nominee of his\r\n  party for the office of Mayor of the city. In that year he was\r\n  designated by the General Term of the Supreme Court, chairman of the\r\n  first commission appointed to determine whether a subway passing under\r\n  Broadway and other streets through the city should be constructed, his\r\n  associates being Robert Maclay, President of the Knickerbocker Trust\r\n  Company, and Benjamin Perkins. Prior to the adoption by the United\r\n  States government of the Panama Canal project, and during the\r\n  Presidency of Mr. McKinley, one of the largest, if not the largest,\r\n  syndicates of moneyed men ever gathered together obtained a concession\r\n  from the government of Nicaragua for the construction of a canal known\r\n  as the Nicaragua Canal. This syndicate, which proposed to build the\r\n  canal without government aid, was composed of the Messrs. Vanderbilt,\r\n  Astor, Rockefeller, Mills, Stillman, Grace, Crimmins, and others of\r\n  equal standing, and was represented before the committee of Congress\r\n  upon the question of recognition and protection, by Mr. McClure as its\r\n  counsel, he having organized the corporation under which it was\r\n  proposed to operate. Mr. McClure is a member of the Manhattan, New\r\n  York Athletic and other clubs, and the Bar Association, of which he\r\n  has been a member of the judiciary and other committees. He has also\r\n  been honored with the presidency of the Metropolitan Surety Company.\r\n\r\n  MCCONWAY, WILLIAM, of the McConway & Torley Company, Pittsburg, Pa.\r\n  (Life member of the Society.)\r\n\r\n  MCCORMICK, EDWARD R., 15 West Thirty-eighth Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  MCCORMICK, JAMES W., of the Judkins & McCormick Company, importers of\r\n  millinery goods, 10–16 West Twentieth Street, New York City;\r\n  residence, 79 New England Avenue, Summit, N.

S. N., retired, 1420 Sixteenth Street,\r\n  N. W., Washington, D. C. (Life member of the Society.) He was born at\r\n  Port Penn, Del., August 4, 1843. He is the son of John and Catherine\r\n  (Caldwell) McGowan. He was educated in the public schools of\r\n  Philadelphia, Pa., 1848–’53, and in private schools in Elizabeth, N.\r\n  J., 1854–’59. Entering the navy, he was appointed acting master’s\r\n  mate, March 8, 1862; was promoted to acting master May 8, 1862, and\r\n  ordered to command the U. S. S. _Wyandank_ in the Potomac flotilla. He\r\n  served on the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers until February, 1863,\r\n  when he was detached from the _Wyandank_ and ordered to the _Florida_\r\n  as navigator. He served on the _Florida_ in the blockage off\r\n  Wilmington, N. C., until October, 1864, when the ship went to New York\r\n  for repairs. In November, of the same year, he was detached from the\r\n  _Florida_ and ordered to the U. S. S. _State of Georgia_ as navigator;\r\n  arrived off Wilmington, N. C., the day after the capture of Fort\r\n  Fisher, his ship being then ordered to reinforce the fleet off\r\n  Charleston, S. C. While there he took part in the Bulls Bay\r\n  Expedition, which was one of the causes of the evacuation of\r\n  Charleston by the Confederates. Soon after the evacuation, the _State\r\n  of Georgia_ was ordered to Aspinwall (Colon) to protect American\r\n  interests on the Isthmus of Panama. Before sailing for Aspinwall,\r\n  McGowan succeeded Lieutenant Manly as executive officer of the ship.\r\n  In November, 1865, he was ordered to the U. S. S. _Monongahela_ as\r\n  watch and division officer; served on the _Monongahela_ in the West\r\n  Indies until January, 1867, when he was detached and, a few days\r\n  later, joined the U. S. S. _Tacony_, Commander Roe, fitting out for\r\n  duty in the Gulf Squadron. He was at Vera Cruz nearly all the summer\r\n  of 1867, which witnessed the fall of Maximilian’s empire. After the\r\n  death of Maximilian, and the surrender of Vera Cruz to the Liberals,\r\n  the _Tacony_ returned to Pensacola, Fla., but, yellow fever breaking\r\n  out aboard, the ship went to Portsmouth, N. H., where, after\r\n  undergoing quarantine, the officers were detached and ordered to their\r\n  homes the latter part of September, 1867. In October of the same year,\r\n  McGowan was ordered to duty on board the receiving-ship at the\r\n  Philadelphia navy yard. He commanded the U. S. S. _Constellation_\r\n  there, and was afterward executive officer of the frigate _Potomac_,\r\n  also a receiving ship, at Philadelphia. In March, 1868, while on the\r\n  _Potomac_, he received a commission as master in the regular navy, and\r\n  in October, 1868, was ordered to duty with the Asiatic fleet. On\r\n  reporting to the admiral, he was ordered to duty as executive officer\r\n  of the U. S. S. _Unadilla_; succeeded to the command of the _Unadilla_\r\n  in June, 1869, and in November of that year was detached from the\r\n  _Unadilla_ and ordered to the U. S. S. _Iroquois_; returned in her to\r\n  the United States, the ship going out of commission in April, 1870. In\r\n  April, 1870, he was promoted to be lieutenant-commander and while in\r\n  that grade served on the double-turreted monitor _Terror_, the\r\n  _Wachusetts_, _Juniata_ and _Marion_ as executive officer, and at the\r\n  League Island, Philadelphia and Brooklyn navy yards. In January, 1887,\r\n  he was promoted to commander; commanded the _Swatara_, _St. Mary’s_,\r\n  _Portsmouth_ and _Alliance_, and was also commandant of the naval\r\n  training station at Newport, R. I., from December, 1896, to July,\r\n  1899. He was promoted captain, February, 1899, and in August took\r\n  command of the U. S. S. _Monadnock_ at Manila. In November, 1900, he\r\n  was ordered to duty as commandant of the naval station at Key West,\r\n  Fla. In April, 1901, he was detached and ordered before the\r\n  retiring-board. He was retired, with the rank of rear admiral, in\r\n  April, 1901. In October, 1871, he wedded Evelyn Manderson of\r\n  Philadelphia. Admiral McGowan is a member of the military order of the\r\n  Loyal Legion, of the Order of Foreign Wars, the Sons of the\r\n  Revolution, and of the Society of Marine Engineers and Naval\r\n  Architects. He is also a member of the following clubs: Metropolitan\r\n  and Chevy Chase of Washington, D. C.; Rittenhouse of Philadelphia,\r\n  Union of New York, and New York Yacht Club. Admiral McGowan’s father,\r\n  Capt. John McGowan, was appointed a lieutenant in the revenue cutter\r\n  service by President Andrew Jackson. He was at Charleston, S. C.,\r\n  during the nullification period, served in the Seminole War, in the\r\n  War with Mexico, and in the Civil War. He commanded the steamer _Star\r\n  of the West_ in the attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter in 1861. He died\r\n  January, 1891, aged 85 years.

At\r\n  fifteen years of age he was induced by his honorable cousin, Thomas R.\r\n  Wilson, Attorney at Killarney, to enter his office and prepare for the\r\n  study of law. He soon grew discontented with the tedious forms and\r\n  complexities of the law, returned to Tralee and entered the Classical\r\n  School conducted by Charles McCarthy, a graduate of Trinity College,\r\n  Dublin. At seventeen, it next became his fortune to come to America\r\n  and he settled in the West, “Where the mighty Missouri rolls down to\r\n  the sea.” With true Irish courage he accommodated himself to\r\n  circumstances, looked neither to the right or to the left until he\r\n  reached the goal of his pious ambition, receiving Holy Orders at the\r\n  hands of Archbishop Ryan, then of St. Louis, in May, 1873.

Y.\r\n\r\n  O’NEIL, HON. GEORGE F., Binghamton, N. Y. (Life member of the\r\n  Society.) Was born in Ireland, and came to America at a very early age\r\n  with his parents. After learning the machinery trade in Binghamton, he\r\n  went West and engaged in mining in California. Retiring to Binghamton,\r\n  he went into the grocery business and real estate business and bought\r\n  a controlling interest in a Democratic paper, which naturally brought\r\n  him into politics. Never having had any taste for public office, he\r\n  was, however, named as a presidential elector in 1892 for Grover\r\n  Cleveland. He was appointed a member of the state committee, and\r\n  served as a commissioner for the World’s Fair at Chicago by\r\n  appointment of Governor Flower of New York. Having confidence in the\r\n  growth of Binghamton, he became interested in its progress and general\r\n  development. He became a stockholder in the electric light plant, a\r\n  director in the First National Bank, and a trustee of the Susquehanna\r\n  Valley Savings Bank. He is a prominent member of the Chamber of\r\n  Commerce and attends to his large real estate investments, being at\r\n  the present time the largest tax-payer in the city of Binghamton and\r\n  county of Broome.\r\n\r\n  O’NEIL, HON.

G., Red Lodge, Montana, born near Bantry, Ireland, February\r\n  6, 1862, of native parents. Attended the rudimentary schools of the\r\n  locality until 13 years of age; then employed for six years in a small\r\n  mercantile establishment in the town of Bantry. Hon. T. M. Healy was\r\n  at that time a clerk in this store, and one of Mr. O’Shea’s\r\n  instructors at the Bantry school was Hon. Timothy Harrington, later a\r\n  prominent member of the Irish Parliamentary party, and also Lord Mayor\r\n  of Dublin. Bantry being a town where the revolutionary spirit was much\r\n  in evidence, there was a secret society there of which Mr. O’Shea\r\n  became a member while still a boy; he also participated actively in\r\n  the doings of the Land League. He came to America in March, 1881, and\r\n  after several months of searching about for a suitable opening,\r\n  settled in Montana, where he has since resided. The state was then\r\n  very sparsely settled, and there were no railroads. Mr. O’Shea spent\r\n  some time in prospecting and working in mines, etc., and in 1887 went\r\n  to Red Lodge with the pioneers of that locality. He entered the employ\r\n  of the Rocky Fork Coal Company, remaining with that concern for 15\r\n  years until it was absorbed by the Northern Pacific Railway. He then\r\n  engaged in banking and real estate, and has since been connected with\r\n  affairs of that nature. He was married in 1901 to Miss Eleanor\r\n  Cavenagh, a native of Dublin, and at that time living in Chicago.\r\n  There are three children, two boys and a girl.\r\n\r\n  O’SHEA, JAMES, 31 West Eighty-eighth Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  O’SULLIVAN, HUMPHREY, Treasurer of the O’Sullivan Rubber Company,\r\n  Lowell, Mass.\r\n\r\n  O’SULLIVAN, JAMES, President of the O’Sullivan Rubber Company, Lowell,\r\n  Mass.\r\n\r\n  O’SULLIVAN, JOHN, with the H.

A., M. D., President of the Home Savings Bank of Vicksburg,\r\n  P. O. Box 234, Vicksburg, Miss. Is Vice-President of the Society for\r\n  Mississippi.\r\n\r\n  QUINLAN, FRANCIS J., A. M., M. D., LL. D., eighth President-General of\r\n  the American Irish Historical Society, was born in the City of New\r\n  York, December 24th, 1853. Both his parents were Irish born, coming to\r\n  these shores when the great exodus took place, about 1845. His early\r\n  education was obtained at the Parochial School of St. Francis Xavier,\r\n  under the guidance of the Christian Brothers. Later he attended\r\n  Manhattan Academy, then at Thirty-second Street, and afterwards the\r\n  College of St. Francis Xavier. While preparing for the study of\r\n  medicine he taught school. In 1878 he was graduated from the College\r\n  of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia College, and soon after accepted\r\n  an appointment at St. Vincent’s Hospital, which he shortly resigned to\r\n  enter the United States Indian Service, serving on the frontier four\r\n  years. In 1883 Doctor Quinlan returned to New York and devoted himself\r\n  especially to diseases of the ear, nose and throat. Such was the skill\r\n  he displayed that in a comparatively few years he was among the most\r\n  prominent of his profession and today is a recognized authority in his\r\n  specialty. Doctor Quinlan’s prominence in the medical field is\r\n  attested by the number of important posts he holds. He is Professor of\r\n  diseases of the nose and throat in the medical department of Fordham\r\n  University and the New York Polyclinic; attending Laryngologist and\r\n  Otologist to the New York City and the St. Vincent Hospitals;\r\n  Consulting Throat and Nose Surgeon of the New York Foundling Hospital,\r\n  St. Joseph’s Hospital, Yonkers, and Jamaica Hospital, N. Y., and\r\n  Consulting Ear, Throat and Nose Surgeon of St. Agnes Hospital, White\r\n  Plains, N. Y. He is President of the New York Celtic Medical Society,\r\n  Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine, a member of the American\r\n  Medical and the State Medical Associations, the New York Otological\r\n  and the Medico Surgical Societies, the Society of Medical\r\n  Jurisprudence and a former President of the New York County Medical\r\n  Association. In addition to these organizations of his profession, he\r\n  is President of the Alumni Sodality of the College of St. Francis\r\n  Xavier; is a member of the society of the Friendly Sons of St.\r\n  Patrick, the Catholic Club of New York, of which he is a former\r\n  President, the Manhattan, New York Athletic and Lambs’ Clubs and is\r\n  connected with various religious, racial and charitable organizations\r\n  of New York City. Doctor Quinlan is a liberal contributor to the\r\n  periodicals of his department of medicine and has devised many\r\n  ingenious surgical instruments. Since his election to the office of\r\n  President-General, the American Irish Historical Society has steadily\r\n  gained favor with our people, and it is safe to say that the increase\r\n  of three hundred members since he has been at the head of the Society\r\n  is due in a great measure to his untiring efforts and a genial\r\n  disposition which earns for him wherever he goes a host of friends. As\r\n  an orator Doctor Quinlan is above mediocrity. His delivery is\r\n  enthusiastic and has the true ring of sincerity, carrying along\r\n  conviction. Especially was this noticeable in his addresses delivered\r\n  at Washington and Providence. Doctor Quinlan is an ardent lover of the\r\n  beautiful in nature, and is an art enthusiast, and although one of the\r\n  busiest men in the great metropolis, he manages occasionally to find\r\n  leisure to examine rare pieces of art that have found their way to the\r\n  art collector’s, and to add to his already large collection of\r\n  statuary and paintings. So judicious is the taste he displays that he\r\n  is regarded as a connoisseur, and his artistic opinion has, on various\r\n  occasions, been solicited. In 1906 Doctor Quinlan was the recipient of\r\n  the Lætare Medal.\r\n\r\n  QUINN, JOHN, attorney at law, 31 Nassau Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  RAMSEY, CLARENCE J., 132 West Twelfth Street, New York City; public\r\n  appraiser; ex-President Catholic Club of New York.\r\n\r\n  REARDON, EDMUND, manufacturer, Cambridge, Mass.\r\n\r\n  REARDON, TIMOTHY, 726 Dayton Avenue, St. Paul, Minn.\r\n\r\n  REGAN, JOHN H., attorney at law, 261 Broadway, Manhattan, New York\r\n  City.\r\n\r\n  REGAN, W.

WILLIAM FRANCIS, 16 East Fifty-sixth Street, New York\r\n  City, was born in the City of Buffalo, N. Y., of Irish parents, on\r\n  November 6, 1859. His father, William Sheehan, and his mother, Honora\r\n  Crowley, were born in Cork, Ireland. At an early age both came to this\r\n  country. He was educated in the public schools and graduated from St.\r\n  Joseph’s College, Buffalo. He was admitted to the Bar in 1881, and\r\n  practised law in Buffalo for thirteen years. At the same time he was\r\n  active in politics, and became the leader of the Democratic party in\r\n  Erie County, and in the western part of the State. He was elected a\r\n  member of the New York Assembly from Erie County in the year 1884 and\r\n  was successively elected in each of the six ensuing years, thus having\r\n  had seven years of service in the Assembly, during six years of which\r\n  he was Democratic leader. In 1891 he was the Speaker of the Assembly.\r\n  In the fall of 1891 he was elected Lieutenant-Governor on the\r\n  Democratic State ticket, with Roswell P. Flower as Governor, and was\r\n  therefore presiding officer of the Senate for the years 1892, 1893 and\r\n  1894. He was the New York representative on the Democratic National\r\n  Committee from 1891 to 1896. At the end of his term as\r\n  Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Sheehan removed to New York City and there\r\n  engaged in the practice of his profession as senior member of the firm\r\n  of Sheehan & Collin. In the fall of 1905 the firm of Sheehan & Collin\r\n  was dissolved and Mr. Sheehan joined with former Judge Alton B.\r\n  Parker, former Judge Edward W. Hatch and with Charles H.

At the age of fourteen, Mr.\r\n  Sullivan was compelled to leave school to become a breadwinner on his\r\n  own account. Three years later he was enabled to return to school, and\r\n  entered the Holyoke High School in 1892, and at the same time began\r\n  the study of law in the office of Hon. Christopher T. Callahan of\r\n  Holyoke. For the next four years he pursued both his high school and\r\n  law courses, graduating from the High school in June, 1896, and was\r\n  admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in October of the same year. So far\r\n  as now known, this is the first time in the history of Massachusetts\r\n  high schools when one of the students was admitted to the practice of\r\n  any of the learned professions the same year of graduation. He\r\n  immediately formed a partnership with Mr. Callahan, which continued\r\n  until January, 1900. A few months prior to this time, Mr. Sullivan had\r\n  occasion to visit the Far West, as a result of which he determined to\r\n  dissolve his Eastern partnership and move permanently to Colorado with\r\n  its vast wealth of undeveloped resources. With no assets except a\r\n  willingness to work, he took up the practice of his profession in\r\n  Denver in the spring of 1900. He has succeeded in building up an\r\n  extensive practice, principally in matters relating to irrigation. Mr.\r\n  Sullivan is one of the few young men raised in America who speaks the\r\n  Irish tongue fluently. He is a member of several clubs, an\r\n  enthusiastic horseman and all-around sportsman; is passionately loyal\r\n  to his friends and possesses to a very large degree “that\r\n  characteristic Irish pertinacity that never saw night too dark, hour\r\n  too late or road too rough to interfere with rendering a favor to a\r\n  friend—or a blow to an enemy.”\r\n\r\n  SULLIVAN, JOHN J., attorney at law, 203 Broadway, New York City.\r\n\r\n  SULLIVAN, HON.
