Both\r\ntheir lives were sorrowful, both ended tragically, the one at the hands\r\nof an assassin, the other upon the guillotine. Elizabeth will not be\r\nremembered in history as a sovereign, for everything connected with the\r\nthrone and with court life was distasteful to her, but rather as the\r\nbeautiful, sorrowful daughter of the Wittelsbachs. She was not only one\r\nof the most beautiful women of her time, but an accomplished scholar and\r\nlinguist, a good musician, and well versed in history, science, and art.\r\nShe was a passionate lover of the woods and mountains, and was happiest\r\nwhen she was walking or riding among them, or associating with the\r\nHungarian people. She was no more at home with the Viennese than was\r\nMarie Antoinette with the Parisians. Her domestic life was saddened by\r\nestrangement from her husband, by lack of sympathy among her relatives,\r\nby the terrible tragedy which ended the life of her son, Prince Rudolph,\r\nand by other tragedies which involved the happiness and sometimes the\r\nlives of those nearest to her. At last her sufferings were ended by the\r\ndagger of a cruel anarchist assassin. As the author of this volume says:\r\n“She died as she had often wished to die, swiftly and painlessly and\r\nunder the open sky. Who can say that her last breath was not a sigh of\r\nthankfulness and peace?”\r\n\r\n                                                                G. P.

Maximilian Joseph, the head of the ducal\r\nline of Vorpfalz-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld, and his wife Ludovica (Louise),\r\ndaughter of King Maximilian First of Bavaria and his second wife,\r\nCaroline of Baden, celebrated on that day their diamond wedding, both\r\nbride and groom having been barely twenty years old at the time of their\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nFew princely couples have been closely connected with so many of the\r\nreigning families of Europe. Their eldest son, Ludwig Wilhelm, renounced\r\nthe succession to wed an actress, Henrietta Mendel, who had received the\r\ntitle of Countess Wallersee. Helene, the eldest daughter, married the\r\nHereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and their daughter Louise, by her\r\nalliance with Frederick of Hohenzollern, formed new ties between the\r\nWittelsbachs and the royal house of Prussia. The next daughter was\r\nElizabeth of Austria-Hungary, whose son in his turn took for his bride\r\nthe King of Belgium’s daughter, Stephanie. After Elizabeth, in the\r\nfamily, came Karl Theodore, well known as an oculist, and, on his\r\nfather’s death, the head of the ducal line of Wittelsbach. He first\r\nmarried his cousin Sophie, daughter of King John of Saxony; the second\r\nand present wife is Marie Josepha, Princess of Portugal. Two other\r\ndaughters, Marie and Mathilde, allied themselves with the younger branch\r\nof the Bourbons. Marie became the wife of King Francis Second of Naples\r\nand Mathilde married his half-brother, Count Louis of Trani. The\r\nyoungest daughter, Sophie, was betrothed at one time to her cousin, King\r\nLudwig Second of Bavaria, but afterwards married Duke Ferdinand\r\nd’Alençon, nephew of Louis Philippe of France, while the youngest son,\r\nMax Emanuel, married Amélie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, thereby becoming\r\nconnected by marriage with Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe Wittelsbachs have always been eccentric. Mental disorders have been\r\ncommon with them, and during the last century between twenty and thirty\r\nmembers of the family have died insane. Yet in spite of their\r\npeculiarities and eccentricities they have always been exceedingly\r\npopular with their subjects, as much for their personal charm as for\r\ntheir devotion to the happiness and welfare of their people. The annals\r\nof Bavaria have little to record of treason or conspiracy against the\r\nprinces of the land, but tell much of the loyalty and sacrifices of life\r\nand property on the part of the people.\r\n\r\nDuke Maximilian Joseph was born at Bamberg, December 4, 1808. He was the\r\nson of the weak-minded Duke Pius Augustus of Bavaria and his wife,\r\nAmélie Louise, Princess of Arenberg. “The good Duke Max,” as he was\r\ncalled by the people, was the only direct descendant of his grandfather,\r\nwhile his wife, on the other hand, was the youngest of a large family of\r\nsisters. Two had been princesses of Saxony and one a Queen of Prussia,\r\nwhile the fourth was the mother of the Emperor Francis Joseph of\r\nAustria-Hungary. King Ludwig First of Bavaria was a half-brother, and\r\nthere were also two half-sisters. One was married first to the King of\r\nWürtemberg and afterwards to the Emperor Francis First of\r\nAustria-Hungary; the other became the wife of Napoleon’s stepson, Eugene\r\nBeauharnais, and the grandmother of Kings Charles Fifteenth and Oscar\r\nSecond of Norway and Sweden.\r\n\r\nThus most of the dynasties of Europe were interested in the festivities\r\nin honor of the aged pair, and sent congratulations to the secluded spot\r\non Starnberg Lake, where the event was celebrated, and where many\r\ntouching proofs of the loyalty of the people of Bavaria were also\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nMaximilian Joseph belonged to the most eccentric and popular branch of\r\nthe Bavarian royal family. Educated directly under the eye of his\r\ngrandfather, his childhood had been spent partly in Bamberg, partly in\r\nMunich. At the age of eighteen he entered the University of Munich,\r\nwhere he applied himself assiduously to the study of history, natural\r\nscience, and political economy, and on coming of age he was given, as\r\nprovided by the Bavarian constitution, a seat in the Senate chamber. But\r\nhe did not aspire to fame, either as orator or statesman; nor did he\r\nstrive for military distinction, though at the age of thirty he was\r\nassigned to the command of a regiment of cavalry and in 1857 was\r\ninvested with the rank of general. His natural love for science,\r\nliterature, and art more often led him to exchange his uniform for the\r\nsimple civilian dress.\r\n\r\nDuring the youth of the Duke a musician, named Johann Petzmacher,\r\ncreated a great stir. He was born in 1803, the son of an innkeeper in\r\nVienna, and in his eighteenth year accidentally learned to play the\r\nhomely zither with which the mountaineers of the Austrian and Bavarian\r\nhighlands accompany their folk songs. He soon became so absorbed in the\r\npossibilities of this instrument that he gave up everything else to\r\ndevote himself to it. His fame as a performer soon spread far and wide.\r\nHe played before the most select circles of Vienna and even at court,\r\nand made tours throughout Germany, being received everywhere with the\r\ngreatest enthusiasm. Duke Max first heard him in 1837 at a concert in\r\nBamberg, and determined to learn to play the zither under the master’s\r\ndirection. Petzmacher was introduced to the would-be virtuoso, and from\r\nthat time until his death made his home with his art-loving patron. The\r\nDuke in 1838 undertook a long journey through Asia and Africa, and his\r\nmusician friend accompanied him. Savages listened with delight to his\r\nplaying, and as the two friends sat on the top of the Egyptian pyramids\r\nor camped in the hot desert sands, the homely melodies carried their\r\nthoughts back to loved ones in Germany, and dangers and hardships were\r\nforgotten. While on this journey Duke Max wrote several musical\r\ncompositions which were afterwards performed in public and received with\r\ngreat applause. Under the name of “Phantasus,” he wrote a collection of\r\ndramatic poems and novels that showed no small literary talent. More\r\nnoteworthy than these, however, is his “Travels in the Orient,” a book\r\nof considerable merit. On his return to Bavaria he had a circus ring\r\nconstructed in the rear of his palace in the Ludwigstrasse, at Munich,\r\nwhich aroused much curiosity, where he frequently made his appearance as\r\nringmaster with members of the Bavarian nobility as circus riders and\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\nIt was only during the winter months that he remained in Munich. All\r\nthrough the Summer and Autumn he lived with his family at his castle\r\nPossenhoffen, beautifully situated on Lake Starnberg. This picturesque\r\nregion, shut in by a chain of lofty Alps, seems as if created to inspire\r\npoetical sentiment, and various members of the art-loving Bavarian royal\r\nfamily have built summer palaces there.\r\n\r\nMax Joseph was an enthusiastic hunter and spent whole days roaming\r\nthrough the forests and mountains about Possenhoffen. Enjoyment of the\r\nbeauties of nature was one of his passions, and he often came out in the\r\nWinter for a few days at a time. On these excursions he wore a simple\r\nhunting costume,—short gray jacket, open shirt with suspenders,\r\nfeathered cap, knickerbockers with long stockings, and heavy-soled\r\nshoes. He generally went about on foot, but sometimes made use of the\r\nmail-coach, the usual mode of conveyance at that time. His fellow\r\ntravellers seldom suspected that the good-natured huntsman who chatted\r\nso freely with them was a duke and the brother-in-law of their\r\nsovereign. He was continually besieged with petitions, and rarely did\r\nany one appeal in vain to the comparatively poor but warm-hearted\r\nprince. His benevolence was one of the chief causes for his popularity\r\nin Munich, though he was most beloved by the people as the gay zither\r\nplayer who with his instrument under his arm would enter their cottages\r\nquite like one of themselves, and play for the young people who were\r\nnever weary of dancing to his music.\r\n\r\nHis wife was very different. She had not his artistic, impulsive\r\ntemperament, and the good-humored simplicity with which he mingled with\r\nthe common people did not altogether meet with her approval. The proper\r\nmaintenance of her position seemed no more than a duty due to her high\r\nbirth and rank, and for this reason she was never as popular as her\r\nhusband, though her many admirable qualities commanded the greatest\r\nrespect and admiration during the sixty years that she remained mistress\r\nof Possenhoffen. She was naturally endowed with a good mind and had been\r\ncarefully educated. Honesty and love of truth were among her most marked\r\ncharacteristics, and all her life she held firmly to what after mature\r\nreflection she believed to be right. Like the Duke, she preferred the\r\nseclusion of the country to city life, and all through their happy\r\nmarried life she acted as a balance to her loving but restless husband\r\nas well as friend and adviser of her children, who adored and looked up\r\nto her always. Her glance was keen but kindly. Smiles came easily to her\r\nlips, and there was an air of distinction about her that sprang from\r\ntrue nobility of heart. She was one of those strong souls born to help\r\nothers, but in little need of support themselves. She was by no means\r\nunambitious for her children, though the trials suffered because of them\r\ntaught her by degrees to place less value upon outward splendor. She\r\ndisliked to excite personal attention and cared only to live as quietly\r\nand modestly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter II\r\n              Birth and Childhood of Elizabeth of Bavaria\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the Christmas Eve of 1837. The bells of Munich were proclaiming\r\nthe festival when Max Joseph, wandering about in one of the poorer\r\nquarters of the city, met a woman dragging herself painfully toward him\r\nwith a bundle of firewood on her back. She addressed him with the usual\r\nBavarian greeting,\r\n\r\n“Praised be Jesus Christ!”\r\n\r\n“For ever and ever, Amen!” replied the Duke, adding kindly, “Why are you\r\ncarrying such a load upon your back this holy Christmas Eve?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you why, gracious Duke,” said the woman; “it is because my\r\nchildren have no Christmas gifts, and I have been in the forest\r\ngathering wood so that they may at least enjoy a warm room.”\r\n\r\n“You did right,” returned the Duke. “As for me, I have already received\r\nmy Christmas gift, for my wife presented me to-day with a charming\r\nlittle daughter who is to be called Liese, and I am so happy over it I\r\nwish you too to have a Merry Christmas.”\r\n\r\nHe wrote her name and address in his notebook, and after the darkness\r\nhad fallen two servants appeared at the poor woman’s dwelling with two\r\nheavy baskets filled with food. At the bottom of each was a banknote for\r\na considerable sum.\r\n\r\nThe child born on this day was Elizabeth, afterward Empress of Austria\r\nand Queen of Hungary. In many countries it is regarded as a sign of\r\nmisfortune to be born on Christmas Eve, but the happy childhood of the\r\nlittle princess had no foreshadowing of the experiences of her after\r\nlife. Most of her early years were spent at Possenhoffen, which her\r\nfather had bought some time before her birth. The great park and\r\nsurrounding forests were the child’s first playgrounds, and developed in\r\nher sensitive soul a deep love of nature and of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess’s chief concern was the education of her eldest daughter, of\r\nwhom she had great hopes. Helene was nearly four years older than her\r\nsister and was the favorite of the mother, whom she resembled both in\r\ncharacter and appearance. Overshadowed by her seemingly superior\r\ntalents, with no interest in books and ignorant of the requirements of\r\ncourt life, Elizabeth—or “Sissi,” as she was called—grew up almost\r\nunnoticed. She loved her sister with the enthusiasm of youth and with\r\nthe natural tendency of the ignorant to look up to those more clever\r\nthan themselves, but her father and brothers were dearer to her than\r\neither sister or mother.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was the darling of the Duke. She had inherited his love\r\nof nature, roamed about constantly with him through the mountains,\r\nvisiting the peasants’ huts, and learned to look at life and people\r\nthrough his eyes. Her bringing up in no way fitted her for the high\r\nstation she was afterward to occupy. At the end of her fifth year she\r\nwas given a governess, but “Sissi,” though an unusually gentle and\r\nlovable child, soon learned how to wind her teacher round her finger and\r\nconcerned herself little about study, for which she had no love. The\r\nEmpress used to declare that in her youth she was the most ignorant\r\nprincess in Europe, and the little she did know had been learned as she\r\nsat on her father’s knee. But if not over-taxed with lessons, her\r\neducation in other branches was by no means neglected. The Duke was\r\ndetermined that his children should be well developed physically, and\r\none of the best dancing masters of the time was summoned to Possenhoffen\r\nto teach Elizabeth and her sisters to dance and carry themselves\r\nproperly. Even in her later years the Empress was an excellent walker\r\nand famous for her easy, graceful carriage.\r\n\r\n“Walking never tires me,” she said once to one of her attendants, “and I\r\nhave my father to thank for it. He was an indefatigable hunter and\r\nwanted my sisters and myself to be able to leap and spring like the\r\nchamois.” She also learned to swim and ride and dearly loved to sit a\r\nhorse and feel the wind blowing through her hair. She was never happier\r\nthan when riding about Lake Starnberg on her little pony, and in the\r\nwinter, when forced to stay in the capital, it was her greatest joy to\r\nescape to the stables, where she would mount the most unmanageable\r\nhorses that could be found. One day while playing circus, as she often\r\ndid, she was thrown by a wild, full-blooded animal. Her governess\r\nuttered a shriek of terror, but Elizabeth quickly rose to her feet,\r\nneither frightened nor hurt, and laughingly besought permission to mount\r\nthe horse again, which the terrified governess refused to grant. The\r\nhappiest time in the whole year to her was when the warm spring days\r\nmade it possible for them to return to Possenhoffen and she could enjoy\r\nunlimited freedom once more. She was passionately fond of flowers, and\r\nit is still told among the Bavarian Alps how “Liese of Possenhoffen”\r\nused to scramble about the wild unbeaten mountain paths to return at\r\nlast with her arms full of edelweiss.\r\n\r\nHer father taught her to play the zither, and she often went with him on\r\nlong tramps among the Alps, stopping now and then for rest and\r\nrefreshment at some hut where they would play dance music on their own\r\ninstruments or on some they found there. On one occasion they had done\r\nthis in a remote region where the huntsman and his daughter were not\r\nknown, and the people gave the pretty child a piece of money in payment.\r\nElizabeth always kept it. “It is the only money I ever earned,” she once\r\nsaid, when showing it to an acquaintance. There was never much pocket\r\nmoney for her to buy presents with, and she used often to spend the\r\nevenings knitting stockings for her mountain friends or sewing on some\r\npiece of needlework. The country folk about Possenhoffen idolized the\r\nlittle Liese, and when overtaken by one of the autumn storms she would\r\noften take refuge in their huts, quite alone, and sit down by the fire\r\nto chat and laugh with old or young. Her parents saw nothing amiss in\r\nthis. Duke Max liked nothing better than to enter into the lives of his\r\npeople, and when the mother was told how her daughter ran about with her\r\nbrothers or played the zither in hovels while the peasants danced she\r\nbut smiled indulgently, saying: “She is only a child. I will take her\r\neducation in hand later on.”\r\n\r\nThis free life at Possenhoffen taught the little Elizabeth to regard the\r\nwoods and mountains as her second home, and the most splendid halls of\r\nthe palace seemed small and stifling to her in comparison. It no doubt\r\nexerted a marked influence on her later development, and possibly\r\nfurnished a clue to her character as Empress of Austria. Had her\r\nchildhood been different, she would unquestionably have been better\r\nfitted for the position she was soon to occupy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter III\r\n                    Betrothal of Princess Elizabeth\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first journeys Elizabeth made with her parents and sisters\r\nwas to Ischl. It was there that Franz Joseph’s parents were in the habit\r\nof spending the summer months, and the two sisters, the Archduchess\r\nSophie and the Duchess Ludovica, had agreed to meet here in the Summer\r\nof 1853. The five years that had passed since the Emperor’s accession to\r\nthe throne had been years of struggle and anxiety. Only a few months\r\nbefore, he had been wounded by the dagger of an assassin. The internal\r\ndisorders of the Empire, however, had not prevented his name from being\r\nlinked with that of various European princesses,—reports which were\r\nfinally silenced by his clever and strong-willed mother, who swayed him\r\ncompletely and had determined that a princess of her own house should\r\nshare her son’s double throne. This was natural enough. Both the\r\nWittelsbachs and Hapsburgs are among the oldest reigning families of\r\nEurope, both have remained loyal to the Roman Catholic Church, and for\r\nsix hundred years alliances between them have been common.\r\n\r\nThe Archduchess had heard much of the talent and amiability of her\r\nsister’s daughter Helene. She and the Duchess Ludovica were on the best\r\nof terms and had already secretly decided on the marriage. It only\r\nremained for the young people to meet and take a fancy to each other,—a\r\nmatter of some concern to the Emperor, who, though an obedient son, was\r\nalso a passionate admirer of the fair sex. It was certainly mutual\r\nattraction that drew Franz Joseph and Elizabeth together, though there\r\nare many tales told of how their betrothal came about. The following\r\naccount, however, is probably nearest the truth.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of August, 1853, the Emperor went to visit his parents\r\nat Ischl and meet Max Joseph’s family. As the travelling carriage rolled\r\nalong the dusty highway, his adjutant suddenly uttered a cry of\r\nadmiration:\r\n\r\n“Look, your Majesty, look yonder!”\r\n\r\nFranz Joseph drew out his field glass and caught a glimpse of a\r\nbeautiful child playing with a flock of goats on a meadow near by. The\r\nnext instant the road turned and the town appeared in sight.\r\n\r\nAn hour later he was sitting with his mother when a young girl burst\r\ninto the room, unannounced, with a bunch of wild roses in her hand. She\r\nwore a short white frock, and a mass of silky chestnut hair fell in soft\r\nwaves about her slender figure. It was the same youthful beauty he had\r\nseen from the carriage. It was the first time they had met, but she\r\nrecognized him at once from the portraits she had seen, and without a\r\ntrace of embarrassment approached and greeted him, saying heartily:\r\n\r\n“How do you do, cousin?”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” inquired the Emperor, almost fearing lest the lovely\r\napparition might vanish before his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I am Elizabeth!”\r\n\r\nThe smile in the wonderful blue eyes won his heart upon the spot.\r\n\r\nA few hours later he was presented to the Princess Helene, who, if not\r\nbeautiful, was a bright, intelligent-looking girl with an air of great\r\ndistinction. Had not Franz Joseph seen Elizabeth first, Helene would\r\nundoubtedly have become his Empress. The same day he was to dine with\r\nhis aunt and uncle. As he entered their hotel in Ischl, he heard two\r\nvoices from behind a half-closed door.\r\n\r\n“I beg of you not to go out, Princess!” said one; “you know it has been\r\nforbidden.”\r\n\r\n“That is the very reason why I want to,” retorted the other in soft\r\ngirlish tones which he recognized; and the next moment Elizabeth stood\r\nbefore him, all smiles and blushes.\r\n\r\n“Why must you not go out?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Because I am only a child and am not expected to appear till my older\r\nsister is married. It is all your fault, and I shall have to eat by\r\nmyself, too!”\r\n\r\n“Princess, what are you thinking of?” cried the governess, who now made\r\nher appearance, crimson with anger. “Pardon, your Majesty!” she added,\r\nturning to the Emperor, “but I have had strict orders.”\r\n\r\nWithout heeding her, he offered his arm to the young girl.\r\n\r\n“Let us go out together, cousin,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No, no, I dare not!” she replied in alarm. “Papa would be furious.”\r\n\r\n“Come back!” cried the governess, and taking advantage of her pupil’s\r\nmomentary hesitation, she drew her into the room and closed the door\r\nwith a low courtesy to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the meal Franz Joseph turned to the Duke. “I have a\r\nfavor to ask of my kind host,” he said. “Is it not the custom in Bavaria\r\nfor the children to come in after dinner? I would like to become better\r\nacquainted with your second daughter, whom I saw for a moment at my\r\nmother’s this morning.”\r\n\r\nAll exchanged glances, and there was a moment’s silence, as Duchess\r\nLudovica felt all her hopes for Helene slipping away. The Duke replied:\r\n\r\n“It shall be as you wish, your Majesty,” and in a few moments Elizabeth\r\nmade her appearance, blushing and frightened.\r\n\r\nFranz Joseph had not a high opinion of women as a rule. Young as he was,\r\nhe had already had some experience of them, but this lovely, innocent\r\nchild wrought a sudden change in him, and through the political clouds\r\nthat darkened the first years of his reign love flashed like lightning\r\ninto his heart. That evening the Archduchess Sophie gave a ball at which\r\nboth nieces were present. The court, suspecting that fateful events were\r\nbrewing, watched the Bavarian princesses curiously. The Archduchess\r\nshowed marked favor to Helene; the son devoted himself to both. When\r\nduring the cotillion he handed Elizabeth a magnificent bouquet of roses,\r\nthe interest increased. Would the mother yield to the son, or the son\r\ngive way to the mother?\r\n\r\nFranz Joseph’s choice was already made, however, and at the close of the\r\nball he announced that he would have no one but Elizabeth for his wife.\r\nThe Archduchess’ surprise and chagrin at the failure of her cherished\r\nplan knew no bounds, but she determined not to oppose her son’s choice.\r\nShe had wanted him to marry her other niece, hoping to rule her as she\r\ndid him; if the crown were to go to an immature child of sixteen instead\r\nof her clever sister of twenty, no doubt it would be so much the easier.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock the next morning the royal carriage stopped before Max\r\nJoseph’s door. The Emperor hastened up the steps, asked for an interview\r\nwith the Duke and the Duchess, and then and there made a formal request\r\nfor the hand of Princess Elizabeth. This was an affront to Helene that\r\nneither her father nor her mother found it easy to endure, but the\r\nsuitor was persistent. If he could not have the one he loved, then he\r\nwould not marry at all, and at length they were forced to yield. Franz\r\nJoseph wanted Elizabeth to be notified at once, but they would not\r\nconsent to force her in any way. She was still as much a child in heart\r\nand feeling as in appearance, and when first told of the Emperor’s\r\nwishes she clasped her hands in dismay, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“It is impossible! I am much too young!”\r\n\r\nLove had entered her dreams, however, even if her heart was not yet\r\nawakened. Franz Joseph’s impetuous wooing appealed to her impulsive\r\nnature. She was attracted by his person and his temperament, and without\r\npausing to reflect, she joyfully promised to be his wife. The betrothal\r\ntook place on the Emperor’s twenty-third birthday, August 18, 1853.\r\n\r\nGreat were the public rejoicings when the news reached Vienna. The\r\nglamour of romance that enveloped the affair appealed to the popular\r\nfancy, and a thousand tales were woven about the lovely child who was to\r\nbe the bride of their young sovereign. Her pictures were scattered\r\nbroadcast throughout the Empire, and people were never weary of dwelling\r\non her beauty and the simple home life of her early days. During the\r\nmonth that the betrothed pair remained at Ischl with their parents,\r\ncrowds flocked thither daily to gaze upon their future Empress, and\r\nreturned full of praises of her modesty and charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter IV\r\n                         The Wedding Ceremonies\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of April, 1854, Elizabeth, accompanied by her parents\r\nand her two oldest sisters, started on her bridal journey to Vienna.\r\nPeasants from all the surrounding country thronged the streets of her\r\nnative city through which she passed, and, overcome with the grief of\r\nparting, she stood up in her carriage and waved a tearful farewell to\r\nthe cheering crowds.\r\n\r\nThe steamboat _Stadt Regensburg_ conveyed the party from Straubing to\r\nLiutz. Work was everywhere suspended as on a holiday, and nothing was\r\nthought of but the coming of the long-awaited princess. At Liutz they\r\nhad to go ashore to change boats, and there Franz Joseph met them,\r\nhurrying back to Vienna, however, so as to be there to welcome his\r\nbride. The town was buried in flowers. A magnificent arch had been\r\nerected. Bonfires burned on all the surrounding heights, while\r\ntorchlight processions, theatrical performances, and serenades concluded\r\nthe festivities of the day.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, April 22, the journey down the Danube was resumed. The\r\n_Franz Joseph_, which carried them from Liutz to Mussdorf, was covered\r\nwith roses from stem to stern, the cabin hung with purple velvet, and\r\nthe deck transformed into a flower garden. It was a beautiful spring\r\nmorning. Banners waved from every roof and tower, and the river banks\r\nwere lined on either side with cheering throngs, eager to catch a\r\nglimpse of their future Empress. What they saw was a slender,\r\nwhite-robed figure hastening from one side of the vessel to the other\r\nand bowing continually in response to the storms of greeting of which\r\nshe never seemed to tire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at Mussdorf, the landing place for Vienna, great preparations\r\nhad been made to welcome her. Since early morning crowds had been\r\nflocking thither, waiting with imperturbable patience and struggling to\r\nkeep the places so hardly won. Near the bridge a pavilion had been\r\nerected with a wide portico whose gilded turrets and cupolas gleamed\r\nafar, and by noon it was filled with nobles, prelates, high officials,\r\nand deputies from the middle classes. Stationed upon a terrace to the\r\nright were the foreign ambassadors with their ladies; on the left sat\r\nrepresentatives from Vienna and other cities under the Hapsburg rule.\r\nThe weather had been threatening in the early part of the day, but\r\ntowards noon heavy gusts of wind scattered the clouds, leaving the\r\nbluest of skies to welcome the bridal party. At half-past six the boat\r\ntouched the shore amid the booming of cannon, strains of music, and the\r\nsolemn pealing of bells. Franz Joseph hastened forward to embrace his\r\nbride, closely followed by his parents, the Archduke Franz Karl and the\r\nArchduchess Sophie, who embraced Elizabeth and then led her back to the\r\nbridegroom.\r\n\r\nAt last came the long-awaited moment when Elizabeth, leaning on the\r\nEmperor’s arm, entered the Austrian capital. From thousands of throats\r\ncame the shout, “Long live the Emperor’s bride!” The sound was so\r\noverwhelming that Elizabeth stood for some moments by her lover’s side\r\nas if spellbound; then, as her glance swept slowly over the excited\r\nthrong, she smiled charmingly and waved her handkerchief to the\r\ndelighted spectators. Many years have passed since that day, many\r\nmisfortunes have overtaken Austria and the house of Hapsburg, but\r\neyewitnesses are still living who remember that moment and tell of the\r\npicture the fair young princess made as she then appeared in all her\r\nexquisite loveliness.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH in his twenty-eighth year_]\r\n\r\nThe progress from Mussdorf to Schönbrunn was a continuous ovation. At\r\nhalf-past seven they reached the gates of the old palace, where the\r\nEmperor once more bade his bride welcome before leading her up the great\r\nstaircase, which was decorated from top to bottom with tropical plants\r\nand flowers. On the following day the state entry into Vienna took\r\nplace. Every house had been decorated by loving hands, and the streets\r\nthrough which the bride was to pass were perfect rivers of flowers. The\r\nElizabeth Bridge, which connected Vienna with the suburb of Wieden or\r\n“An der Wien,” was opened that day and given the name of the Empress.[1]\r\nHere the mayor and council of the city were stationed to welcome her.\r\nAbout the eight statues of famous men which adorned the bridge,\r\nthousands of rare shrubs and blossoms from the hothouses of Princes\r\nLichtenstein and Schwarzenberg, the fragrance of which filled the whole\r\ntown, had been effectively arranged. As far as the Corinthian gate\r\nstretched a triple wall of citizens, and at short intervals young girls\r\nstood strewing flowers.\r\n\r\nThe thunder of cannon and pealing of bells from every church tower in\r\nVienna and its suburbs proclaimed the starting of the procession. The\r\ngolden state coach was drawn by eight milk-white horses with tall white\r\nplumes on their heads; the harnesses were covered with gold, and the\r\ncoachman, footmen, and postilions wore white wigs. On the back seat sat\r\nthe bride with her mother. Her dress was of red satin, embroidered in\r\nsilver, and over it she wore a white cloak trimmed with garlands of\r\nroses. About her neck was a lace handkerchief, and in her beautiful hair\r\nsparkled a circlet of diamonds, twined in which was a wreath of red\r\nroses. Never had Elizabeth more fitly deserved the name so often given\r\nher, never had she more perfectly looked “The Rose of Bavaria.”\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of April 24, 1854, Te Deums were celebrated in all\r\nthe churches of Vienna and the august pair attended high mass in the\r\ncourt chapel. By three o’clock in the afternoon the crowds about the\r\nHofburg and the Church of the Augustins, where the ceremony was\r\nperformed, were so great that barriers had to be erected to keep a way\r\nclear for the coaches to pass. From all parts of the Empire and of\r\nEurope guests had been pouring into the capital. On the preceding day\r\nalone, seventy-five thousand strangers arrived, a most extraordinary\r\nnumber for those days. Even the Orient—Alexandria, Smyrna, and\r\nSalonica—sent representatives to the wedding.\r\n\r\nThe famous old Church of the Augustins was gorgeously decorated for the\r\noccasion. Above the high altar rose a canopy of white velvet embroidered\r\nwith gold, under which were placed two prie-dieux, also of white velvet.\r\nThe walls and columns of the church were hung with damask and costly\r\ntapestry and the floor was carpeted. From a hundred candelabra countless\r\ntapers shed a soft but brilliant light. The Augustin Gallery, which led\r\nfrom the inner apartments of the Hofburg to the church, was similarly\r\ndecorated and illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was to take place at seven o’clock in the evening. By six\r\nevery available space in the church was filled with invited guests. The\r\ngay uniforms of the officers, the many-colored and picturesque court\r\ndresses of the Hungarian and Polish nobles, the sparkling jewels of the\r\nladies, the gold-embroidered coats of the ministers and distinguished\r\nguests, the red robes of the cardinals, the fantastic costumes of many\r\nof the Oriental emissaries, all united to form a scene of incredible\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time Prince Archbishop Rauscher, the Emperor’s former\r\ntutor, with more than seventy bishops and archbishops in their\r\ngold-embroidered vestments, assembled in the sacristy. The master of\r\nceremonies informed his Majesty that all was ready, and the procession\r\nentered the Augustin Gallery. First came the pages, stewards, and\r\ngentlemen-in-waiting; next the privy councillors and high court\r\nofficials; then the Archdukes with their chamberlains; and, last of all,\r\nthe Emperor himself, in the uniform of a field marshal and wearing all\r\nhis orders. Directly behind the bridegroom came his mother, leading the\r\nbride on her left. On Elizabeth’s left was her own mother, Duchess\r\nLudovica, and after them followed the ladies of the court led by the\r\nLord Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nThe bride of sixteen was radiant with all the beauty and happiness of\r\nyouth. Her wedding gown was of heavy white silk, richly embroidered with\r\ngold and silver, over which she wore a loose garment of the same\r\nmaterial with long sleeves. A diamond clasp held the long veil of\r\nBrussels point lace, and the bridal wreath of fresh myrtle and orange\r\nblossoms was secured by a magnificent coronet of diamonds which her\r\nmother-in-law had worn at her own marriage and given to Elizabeth as a\r\nwedding gift. A diamond necklace encircled her throat, and upon her\r\nbreast she wore the Bavarian order of Theresa and the Austrian order of\r\nthe Starry Cross, together with a bunch of white roses.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and his bride were met at the door of the church by the\r\nPrince Archbishop, who sprinkled them with holy water, after which they\r\nknelt on the prie-dieux while the other members of the two royal\r\nfamilies took their places. After a short prayer Franz Joseph and\r\nElizabeth advanced to the high altar, made their responses, exchanged\r\nrings, and clasped hands. As the Archbishop pronounced the Church’s\r\nblessing at the close of the ritual, a salvo of musketry sounded from\r\nthe regiment of infantry stationed on the Josephsplatz, and the next\r\ninstant the thunder of cannon proclaimed that Austria had an Empress and\r\nHungary a Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter V\r\n                             First Troubles\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of her marriage Elizabeth was said to be not only the\r\nyoungest but also the most beautiful Empress that had ever sat on the\r\nthrone of the Hapsburgs. Her figure was tall and slender, her hands and\r\nfeet small and well shaped, her features regular and delicate. She had a\r\ncharming smile, wonderfully expressive dark blue eyes, a beautiful\r\ncomplexion, and a mass of waving chestnut hair that fell about her, when\r\nloosened, like a veil, and which she wore either hanging in eight heavy\r\nbraids or wound like a coronet around her head. With no experience of\r\nthe world and full of the confidence of youth, she looked forward to her\r\nmarried life as one long holiday. Crowned with love, all hearts should\r\nbow before her and she would be the good genius of her people.\r\n\r\nBut disappointment followed close upon the heels of the first\r\nintoxication. If the lower classes were charmed with their Empress, this\r\nwas far from being the case with an aristocracy that claims to be the\r\nmost exclusive in Europe, and there were many at court who felt that\r\nneither by age nor rank was this daughter of a non-royal Duke fitted to\r\nbe their sovereign. Instead of being welcomed with open arms, therefore,\r\nshe encountered only a wall of opposition and intrigue. Far from being\r\nthe brilliant centre of homage and admiration, as she had dreamed, she\r\nwas grieved and mortified to find those about her anxious only to\r\ndeprive her of the honors and influence that were her due. It was most\r\nunfortunate that she should have been placed so early in a position\r\nrequiring the utmost tact and knowledge without having had any training\r\nto fit her for it,—a poor bird that had left the home nest before it had\r\nlearned to fly! In Bavaria she had been a happy, care-free child,\r\nbeloved by every one and so full of the joy of life that she seemed to\r\ncarry with her wherever she went a breath of those woods and mountains\r\nshe so dearly loved. A Wittelsbach by both lines of descent, she had\r\ninherited the characteristics of the race, their pride and independence,\r\nhonesty and courage, to a striking degree. Even these virtues, however,\r\nwere but so many dangers, since they made it difficult for her to adapt\r\nherself to the rules laid down by court life. Her very youth and\r\nfreshness were out of place at Schönbrunn and the Hofburg. Her ignorance\r\nand inexperience, which were well known in Vienna, made it seem probable\r\nthat she would prove an easy tool at court, provided she were only\r\namused and flattered sufficiently. But this error was soon discovered.\r\nWith the peculiarities of her race she had also inherited their marked\r\nmental gifts, and young as she was, her mind was quick to grasp whatever\r\ninterested her and to choose or reject with certainty.\r\n\r\nSuch a nature could not but rebel against the restraint and monotony of\r\ncourt life. Its pomps and ceremonies wearied her from the first, and\r\nlittle as she resembled Marie Antoinette in other ways, she hated\r\netiquette even more than did that unfortunate Queen. The court of\r\nVienna, which had lived by its conventional usages from time immemorial,\r\nregarded as natural and necessary the forms that Elizabeth considered\r\nridiculous and childish. She once aroused a storm of indignation by\r\nrefusing to appear at the customary state breakfast, which consisted of\r\nvarious hot dishes, and ordering some bread and sausage and a glass of\r\nMunich beer to be brought to her in her own apartments. On another\r\noccasion, when presiding at one of her first court ceremonials, she took\r\noff her gloves, contrary to all custom and tradition. An elderly court\r\ndame hastened to remind her of her mistake.\r\n\r\n“Why should I not?” inquired the Empress.\r\n\r\n“Because it is against the rules of etiquette,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Then in future let it be proper to break the rule!” she declared.\r\n\r\nNo young husband could have been more devoted than Franz Joseph was to\r\nthe bride he had found for himself without the aid of ambassador or\r\nenvoy. “I am beloved as if I were a lieutenant, and as happy as a god!”\r\nhe wrote to a friend just after the wedding.\r\n\r\nAnd Elizabeth did truly love him, but not as he did her. In spite of the\r\nintensity of feeling that showed itself in after life, there was a\r\ncertain inborn coldness in her nature that made it impossible for her to\r\nshare his ardor or to understand him always. But it often taxed his\r\ndevotion and patience to reconcile this freedom-loving child of nature\r\nto the restraints and obligations of her new position, and he was many\r\ntimes called upon to make peace between the older court ladies and their\r\nyoung mistress. He would gladly have loosened her bonds somewhat, but\r\ndared not introduce new ways and customs.\r\n\r\nThe Archduchess Sophie had hitherto reigned supreme at court. She was a\r\nremarkably clever woman, and all through the first difficult years of\r\nher son’s reign had proved a valuable support to him, and acquired an\r\ninfluence which she had no intention of surrendering into the hands of\r\nher seventeen-year-old niece. Two women, though of the same blood, could\r\nscarcely have been more different. The Archduchess was ambitious and\r\nworldly; the Empress cared nothing for place or power. Sophie was\r\ncompletely under the influence of the priesthood; Elizabeth worshipped\r\nGod in nature, but avoided all religious ceremonies and hated priests.\r\nThe older woman expected to find it easy to govern this child who had so\r\nunexpectedly received the imperial crown, through her vanity and\r\ninexperience, but finding herself mistaken, she resorted to other means.\r\nElizabeth, as we have seen, had come to Vienna full of hopes and dreams,\r\nexpecting naturally to occupy the first place in her husband’s life and\r\ncourt; but every attempt to assert her right as Empress was deliberately\r\nset aside by the Archduchess, who crushed her hopes and dispelled her\r\ndreams with a cruel hand, regardless of her feelings.\r\n\r\nAs for the court, “Madame Mère,” as she was called, was a power whose\r\nfriendship it was prudent to possess. It was believed, moreover, that\r\nFranz Joseph, whose fickleness and susceptibility in matters of the\r\nheart were well known, would soon tire of his young wife. Elizabeth’s\r\ninexperience made it impossible for her to battle successfully with\r\ncourt intrigues, and it was plain that the mother-in-law would be\r\nvictorious in the struggle between them. The Emperor always treated his\r\nwife with the greatest care and consideration, but misunderstandings\r\ngradually arose between them, fostered by wounded pride on her side and\r\non his by the Archduchess Sophie’s constant efforts to lower her in the\r\neyes of her son. Dearly as she loved Franz Joseph, Elizabeth held\r\nherself more and more aloof from him for fear of seeming the troublesome\r\nchild her mother-in-law called her, and an expression of quiet sadness\r\ngrew upon her. But there were moments, too, of hot revolt against the\r\ncold, selfish world in which she lived, and these did not mend matters\r\nfor her. Rash and thoughtless, she struggled against this unceasing\r\npersecution. She treated the Archduchess’ followers with marked disdain\r\nand gave her confidence to others who deceived and betrayed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter VI\r\n                          Travels and Sorrows\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing had been originally farther from the wishes of the young Empress\r\nthan to fill her throne in solitary state, surrounded only by a few\r\nchosen families of noble birth. What she most wanted was to go about\r\namong the people and get acquainted with her new subjects, and during\r\nthe early part of her married life she was often seen in the streets of\r\nVienna. Wherever she went crowds gathered, struggling and pushing\r\ngood-naturedly to get as near a view of her as possible. One day she\r\nwent out to walk, accompanied only by one of her ladies-in-waiting and\r\nwithout informing any one of her intention. On one of the principal\r\nsquares, seeing something in a window that attracted her, she entered\r\nthe shop, but on turning to go out again was unpleasantly surprised to\r\nfind hundreds of faces peering in at the door and windows, and it was\r\nonly with the aid of the police that she was able to reach the street\r\nagain. This incident excited the greatest disapproval at court.\r\n\r\n“Her Majesty seems to imagine herself still in the mountains of Bavaria.\r\nShe forgets that she is the Empress of Austria and what she owes to her\r\nhusband’s position,” was whispered about her.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged at the result of her attempts to mingle with the people, she\r\nthenceforth avoided appearing in public as much as possible, confining\r\nher walks to the secluded portions of the palace gardens or the park\r\nabout Schönbrunn. But even this did not satisfy the court, which now\r\nfound fault with her for neglecting to show herself before the people on\r\nevery possible occasion. This hostility and opposition that met the\r\nyoung Empress at every turn only made her retire the more within\r\nherself, and really inflicted an irreparable wrong, for it developed in\r\nher an inherited love of solitude that, once acquired, soon became too\r\nfixed ever to be renounced.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the outlying portions of the Empire—Bohemia, Moravia, Galicia,\r\nand Hungary—were waiting anxiously to welcome the imperial pair, and\r\nsoon after the wedding they began a series of short journeys.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1856, they made a visit to the Austrian Alps that is still\r\nremembered and talked of even in the remotest mountain valleys. From\r\nHeiligenblut, where they spent the night, the Emperor and Empress\r\nclimbed the Grossglockner. About four o’ clock in the morning, after\r\nhearing mass in the little parish church, they began the ascent,\r\naccompanied by two experienced guides, Elizabeth riding part of the way,\r\nwhile her husband walked. During the walk he gathered a bunch of\r\nedelweiss growing on a steep cliff and handed it to his wife, saying,\r\n“This is the first edelweiss I ever picked.”\r\n\r\nAt the Wallner Hut, as it was then called, the Empress stopped to rest,\r\nwhile Franz Joseph climbed to the lofty Glockner-saddle, and it was in\r\nremembrance of this visit that the Wallner Hut received the name of\r\nElisabeth-ruhe. From there they went to Steiermark and thence to Gratz,\r\nwhere they arrived on the eleventh of September, and where, as at all\r\nother places, they were received with the greatest enthusiasm. In\r\nNovember of the same year they visited the Italian provinces which at\r\nthat time formed part of their dominions. Owing to the political\r\ndisturbances of the period and the feeling of the Italians against\r\nAustria, it was feared the sovereigns would meet with a cold reception;\r\nbut the “mistress of the Adriatic” had decked herself magnificently to\r\ngreet the young Empress. The streets and market-places were brilliantly\r\nilluminated and gorgeous masked balls were given in her honor. All\r\nhearts were won by Elizabeth’s beauty and charm of manner, and the\r\ndelighted Emperor said to her:\r\n\r\n“Your smile has done more toward conquering the people than all my\r\narmies have been able to accomplish!”\r\n\r\nFranz Joseph, as we have seen, was a mere youth when his uncle, the\r\nEmperor Ferdinand, abdicated in his favor and retired to Prague to end\r\nhis days. The young sovereign had scarcely ascended the throne when\r\nrebellion broke out in Hungary, and unable to quell the disturbance\r\nalone he was forced to seek aid from Russia. Czar Nicholas placed one\r\nhundred thousand men at his disposal, and the revolt of 1848-1849 was\r\ncrushed with a firm hand. Countless towns, villages, and estates were\r\nlaid in ashes, and the country was left bleeding from almost incurable\r\nwounds. The people bore their hard fate in sullen defiance, and five\r\nyears later, when the Emperor married, time had done little to soften\r\ntheir hatred of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe pardon that Franz Joseph had granted on his wedding day to all\r\npolitical offenders in his dominions formed one step toward\r\nreconciliation, but the first real signs of a more friendly feeling were\r\ndue not to him but to the Queen. It was her smile that finally appeased\r\nthe wrath of the Hungarians, her beauty and goodness that laid the\r\nfoundation of more amicable relations between them and their sovereign.\r\nShe devoted herself assiduously to the study of their language, one of\r\nthe most difficult in Europe, interested herself in the art and customs\r\nof the country, and showed such deep concern for their welfare that she\r\nis said to have wept on occasions when her husband refused to grant\r\ntheir wishes.\r\n\r\nThe reason for Elizabeth’s sudden and strong attachment to this hitherto\r\nunknown country could have been only a psychological one. When she first\r\ncame to Vienna, she was impressed with the violent prejudice that\r\nexisted at court against the Hungarians. Each attempt of that\r\nliberty-loving people to throw off their chains was regarded as a fresh\r\ncrime by the Archduchess Sophie and her adherents, and the Empress heard\r\nmuch harsh criticism of her subjects beyond the Leytha. Her natural\r\nperversity and independence, however, led her to investigate the matter\r\nfor herself, and she soon gained a very different idea of the\r\nopen-hearted, chivalrous Hungarians, whose natural character was so like\r\nher own. Hoping to learn more of the inner life of the people by means\r\nof the language, she began the study of it with a zeal and industry that\r\nshrank from no difficulties till in time she acquired perfect mastery of\r\nit even to speaking it like a native.\r\n\r\n“Queen Elizabeth speaks our language without a trace of foreign accent,”\r\nsaid the Hungarian poet, Maurus Jókai, “speaks it like a peasant woman\r\nand without any of the affectation common with most of our court\r\nladies.”\r\n\r\nHer first teacher was an old professor named Homokh, with whom she\r\nlearned the grammar and to read easily. But this did not satisfy her.\r\nShe wanted a thorough knowledge of Hungarian literature and engaged as\r\nher instructor Dr. Max Falk, at that time a journalist in Vienna. His\r\nmethods were far less tedious than those of Homokh, and she began to\r\nread the best passages of Scripture, together with a history of the\r\npeople. He also gave her for translation into Hungarian the French\r\ncorrespondence between Joseph Second of Austria and Catherine Second of\r\nRussia, published by Arnath, a task she found most delightful. Her tutor\r\nwas charmed with her enthusiasm and the accuracy with which she\r\nperformed her duties as pupil. One morning as she handed him her written\r\ntranslation, she said:\r\n\r\n“All day yesterday my time was taken up with audiences, and in the\r\nevening there was a court concert. After that I was so tired I went\r\ndirectly to bed, but no sooner had I lain down than I remembered my\r\nHungarian translation had not been written. So I tore a leaf from the\r\nalmanac that lay on a table beside my bed and did it there. Excuse the\r\npencil.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until May, 1857, however, that she made her first visit to\r\nHungary. Her arrival was hailed with enthusiasm, and the young Queen was\r\neverywhere greeted with shouts of joy. An extensive tour of the country\r\nhad been planned by the sovereigns, but a sad event forced them to\r\nabandon it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and Empress had two children at this time, the little\r\nArchduchesses Sophie and Gisela. Scarcely had the court established\r\nitself in the royal palace at Ofen when word was received of the illness\r\nof the two-year-old Sophie. The physicians’ first reports were\r\nreassuring, but on reaching Debreczin, May 28, the despatches announced\r\na change for the worse. The anxious parents hastened back to Budapest,\r\nwhere on the next evening they heard that their oldest child was dead.\r\n\r\nElizabeth left Hungary with tears in her eyes. Her first great sorrow\r\nhad befallen her on her first visit among the Magyars, and it may have\r\nbeen that grief attached her still more closely to this people whom in\r\nafter years she loved so well and by whom she was adored as a sovereign\r\nand reverenced as a guardian angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter VII\r\n                      Birth of Crown Prince Rudolf\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only the Emperor and his family but the whole nation were anxious\r\nfor an heir to the throne, and the disappointment was great when on May\r\n5, 1855, the Empress gave birth to a daughter, who was called Sophie\r\nDorothea, after the Emperor’s mother. Elizabeth was too young and\r\ninexperienced to understand this, though she could not fail to read the\r\nevidences of it in the faces of those about her. Still greater\r\ndissatisfaction greeted the birth of a second daughter, Gisela, in July,\r\n1856. This daughter was married in 1873 to Prince Leopold of Bavaria,\r\nsecond son of the present Prince Regent.\r\n\r\nThe Empress looked forward to her maternal duties with the greatest\r\nhappiness, and asked nothing more than to devote herself to her\r\nchildren. But even this was not to be allowed her. The Archduchess\r\nSophie had the little girls removed almost immediately to a remote wing\r\nof the Hofburg, leaving the young mother alone in her splendid\r\napartments, where she had always felt herself so much a stranger.\r\nInvoluntarily she compared her lot with that of her mother, the mistress\r\nof Possenhoffen, whose busy life was filled with work and noble\r\nsacrifices for her flock of children, while the Empress of Austria had\r\nnothing left her but to preserve her beauty and exhibit her toilettes.\r\nThe importance of providing the Empire with an heir was impressed upon\r\nher so constantly that she was puzzled and asked her own mother once in\r\na moment of confidence:\r\n\r\n“If I should have no son, do you suppose that Franz would follow\r\nNapoleon’s example and cause our marriage to be annulled?”\r\n\r\n“Do not think of such things, my child,” replied the Duchess. “You know\r\nthat Franz loves you devotedly.” Then she continued: “There are two\r\nsorts of women in this world,—those who always get their own way and\r\nthose who never get it. You seem to me to be one of the latter. You have\r\ngreat abilities and do not lack character. But you have not the faculty\r\nof stooping to the level of your associates, or adapting yourself to\r\nyour environment. You belong to another period, that in which saints and\r\nmartyrs existed. Do not attract notice by being too obviously the first\r\nor break your own heart by fancying yourself the latter.”\r\n\r\nAt last, shortly before her twenty-first birthday, her dearest wishes\r\nwere gratified, and on August 21, 1858, a son was born to the imperial\r\npair, a beautiful child though somewhat delicate, in whose cradle the\r\ndelighted father hastened to lay the Order of the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the good news was carried by telegraph to every corner\r\nof the world, a salute of a hundred and one guns was fired from all the\r\nfortresses in Austria and Hungary, and the signal was echoed from a\r\nmillion throats, while public enthusiasm was still further increased\r\nwhen the Crown Prince, at his christening, received the name of his\r\ngreat ancestor Rudolf of Hapsburg. The popularity of the Empress was at\r\nonce restored. Her enemies were silenced, her mother-in-law contented,\r\nand she herself for a time was happy.\r\n\r\n“No one has seemed to need me until now,” she declared pathetically,\r\n“not even my little girl whom they keep from me as much as possible. But\r\nI will not permit my boy to be taken away and given to the care of\r\nstrangers. He will need me and we will be happy in each other.”\r\n\r\nAgain, however, she was mistaken. Rudolf was installed as soon as\r\npossible in a remote part of the palace, the Archduchess insisting that\r\nit was not suitable for the heir to a great empire to be brought up by a\r\nyoung mother who as yet did not even know how to conduct herself. When\r\nElizabeth begged to be allowed the care of her own child and dwelt on\r\nthe comfort it would be to her, her mother-in-law declared indignantly\r\nthat it was absurd to talk of the need for comfort when she had\r\neverything in the world to make her happy. From Sophie’s point of view\r\nindeed this was perhaps true, but Elizabeth was of a different stamp,\r\nand no outward luxury could make up to her for disappointed hopes or an\r\nempty heart. Matters grew still worse for her when in the Summer of 1857\r\nthe Emperor’s second brother, Ferdinand Maximilian, married Charlotte,\r\nthe daughter of King Leopold First of Belgium. This aspiring princess\r\nattached herself at once to the court party and became a great favorite\r\nwith her mother-in-law.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile heavy clouds were gathering on the political horizon. Among\r\nFranz Joseph’s Italian subjects the ferment was strongest, but\r\nthroughout the whole Empire there was great discontent. It was well\r\nknown that the Archduchess Sophie held the reins of power, and that it\r\nwas she who declared war or concluded peace,—a state of things that\r\ncaused much opposition in diplomatic circles, while all classes united\r\nin condemning this so-called “petticoat government.”\r\n\r\nWhen the war with France and Sardinia broke out in 1859, it was less a\r\nquestion of the country’s incontestable rights than of the maintenance\r\nof the power of the Jesuits. Elizabeth plainly saw the mistake her\r\nhusband was making in allowing himself to be guided so much by his\r\nmother in political matters and longed to use her influence with him to\r\nprevent it, but she was powerless. No one asked her advice, no one cared\r\nfor her opinion; so she held her peace. While Franz Joseph was fighting\r\nat Solferino and his mother corresponded with foreign courts or held\r\nlong conferences with statesmen and diplomats, the Empress had to\r\ncontent herself with visiting wounded soldiers and officers from the\r\nItalian battlefields. Like an angel of mercy she went about among the\r\nhospitals, tasting the food that had been prepared and distributing\r\nmoney and cigars. Her gentle words of pity and cheer carried the more\r\nweight since they had none of the sanctimonious tone so common at that\r\ntime. The halo of piety with which the Archduchess Sophie enveloped all\r\nher actions was most distasteful to Elizabeth, who did not attempt to\r\nconceal her dislike of the clergy.\r\n\r\nOnce at a court ball, her train became entangled around the feet of the\r\npapal nuncio, who happened to be standing near. With an angry glance the\r\nEmpress jerked it toward her with such force that the prelate barely\r\nescaped a fall,—a scene that was the cause of much suppressed merriment,\r\nfor it was well known that Her Majesty would quite as gladly have\r\ndeprived him of his influence at court as upset his person in the\r\nball-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter VIII\r\n               Elizabeth’s Illness and Sojourn in Madeira\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estrangement between the Emperor and Empress gradually increased.\r\nAffairs of state, the distractions of court life, together with Franz\r\nJoseph’s growing disposition to return to the habits and pleasures of\r\nhis bachelor life, all tended to widen the breach between them. The\r\nEmperor was naturally kind and affectionate, but he also had weaknesses\r\nwhich on closer acquaintance proved him to be far from the ideal\r\ncharacter his young wife had imagined. She was too proud to stoop to\r\nunworthy means to retain his attachment for her, and her increasing\r\nsadness and reserve as well as her disinclination to take part in the\r\nfestivities of the court, only wearied and helped to estrange him the\r\nmore, as he felt in it a silent reproach.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had expected to find complete happiness in his love, and her\r\nsolitary position at court in an atmosphere so hostile had made her\r\ncling yet more closely to this hope. By this time, however, reality had\r\ndispelled this illusion. She did not feel that she had lost her power\r\nover him or even his love, but her faith in him was shaken and her\r\nconfidence destroyed. To be pitied was unendurable to the proud daughter\r\nof the Wittelsbachs. She hid her disappointment from the world and\r\nretired more and more within herself. At length her health began to give\r\nway. She struggled bravely against her growing weakness, but was finally\r\nseized with an illness which her physicians could neither understand nor\r\ncure. After repeated consultations it was decided that her lungs were\r\naffected, and a journey to Madeira was advised, that place being at the\r\ntime regarded as the most favorable one for troubles of that kind. For a\r\nlong time she refused to follow their advice, but finally early in the\r\nyear 1861 she consented to go. Those who saw her start doubted whether\r\nshe would ever return, and she herself had little hope of regaining her\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nShe left Europe wrapped in mist and cold. When she landed in Madeira, a\r\nweek later, she was greeted by blue skies, brilliant sunshine, and\r\ntropical vegetation. The villa she was to occupy was charmingly\r\nsituated, with wide verandas, terraces overlooking the sea, and a chain\r\nof mountains stretching behind it. Under these new conditions the\r\nEmpress began at once to improve and by the first of March was able to\r\nmake daily excursions about the island, which was now ablaze with\r\nflowers. She even grew to look upon her illness as a deliverer. It had\r\nenabled her to escape from the oppression of court life, and the quiet\r\nsolitude taught her patience and gave her strength to bear the trials\r\nstill in store for her. She lived over the struggles of her life at\r\nVienna, so different from the happy days of childhood in her peaceful\r\nBavarian home, the memory of which, together with the tales and legends\r\nshe had heard at her father’s knee, returned so often and so vividly to\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nShe rose early every morning, studied, and practised her music, wrote\r\ndaily letters to her husband and her parents, and took long walks upon\r\nthe shore. Once during her stay on the island she had a visit from her\r\nsister Helene, who had married the Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Vessels\r\nrarely stopped there, and her life was most uneventful; but nature,\r\nwhich she had always loved, now became doubly dear. It was there too\r\nthat she discovered a new interest in the world of poetry, and books\r\nsoon became like friends to her. In the long solitary evenings she would\r\ntake refuge in them from the restless longings of her heart and forget\r\nfor the time her cares and troubles. Meanwhile, in Vienna, news of the\r\nEmpress’ death was daily expected, but instead came word that her cough\r\ngrew better, and at last it was announced that the climate of Madeira\r\nhad done its work and she would be allowed to come back after a stay of\r\nfour months.\r\n\r\nOn the way home in the middle of May a frightful storm arose, and the\r\nyacht _Victoria and Albert_ (which had been loaned her by Queen Victoria\r\nof England for the return voyage) was tossed about like a nutshell on\r\nthe angry sea. The Empress, however, refused to leave the deck in spite\r\nof all entreaties and the mountainous waves that threatened to sweep her\r\nover the side of the vessel. She even had herself fastened to the mast\r\nthat she might safely enjoy the wonderful spectacle. On the eighteenth\r\nof May she was met off Trieste by the Emperor, who had come out on a\r\nwarship to welcome her with an escort of five steamboats carrying\r\nnotables and citizens with bands of music. At ten o’clock a shot from\r\nthe castle announced the approach of the flotilla, and amid thundering\r\nsalutes from batteries and warships the Emperor and Empress entered the\r\nharbor and landed near Miramar, the pleasure palace built for Archduke\r\nMaximilian, afterward Emperor of Mexico. A celebrated painting depicts\r\nthe meeting between the young Archduchess Charlotte and Elizabeth on the\r\ngreat marble terrace overlooking the sea.\r\n\r\nAt Baden Elizabeth saw her mother-in-law and children again, and five\r\ndays later the imperial pair entered Vienna, the railway station of\r\nwhich was decorated with flowers in honor of the occasion. They drove to\r\nthe palace in an open carriage amid the cheers of the populace, whose\r\njoy over the Empress’ recovery found further expression the following\r\nday in praise services held in all the churches of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter IX\r\n                    The Empress’ Flight from Vienna\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth’s sojourn in Madeira did not bring the permanent improvement\r\nthat was hoped for. A few weeks after her return to Austria the cough\r\nreturned, and fearing that the nature of her illness had been mistaken,\r\nher parents’ physician who had had the care of her in her youth was sent\r\nfor. He decided that she was suffering from acute indigestion and that a\r\nchange was imperative. This time the place of resort chosen was the\r\nisland of Corfu, where she arrived safely soon afterward, accompanied by\r\nher physician. The Empress was charmed with the villa that had been\r\nsecured for her, about half an hour’s drive from the capital. It was\r\nsurrounded with gardens and large grounds, and in a shorter time even\r\nthan at Madeira she began to show the beneficial effects of the climate.\r\n\r\nNot far from the house was the mountain Aja Kyriahi, on the summit of\r\nwhich stood a small church surrounded with cypresses. Every morning\r\nbefore sunrise she climbed to this spot, and whenever in after years she\r\ncame back to Corfu she always visited it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two months her health was quite restored, and toward the\r\nclose of October she left for Venice, where she held her court that\r\nWinter. Her return to Vienna the following August, after a sojourn in\r\nthe Tyrol, was the occasion for almost as much enthusiasm as on her\r\nwedding day, the people everywhere showing the most touching proofs of\r\ntheir sympathy and devotion.\r\n\r\nBut again her stay in Vienna was destined to be of short duration, for\r\nafter the lapse of a few weeks, unexpectedly and without confiding her\r\nintentions to any one, she left the capital, to seek refuge in travel\r\nfrom the troubles and complications of her position there. The Emperor\r\nfollowed to try and bring about a reconciliation, but she refused to\r\nmeet him, and he returned at length to Vienna weary and disheartened.\r\nWith her capacity for loving and her pride Elizabeth must have suffered\r\nintensely from the slights and disappointments of her married life, and\r\nfresh persecutions on the part of her mother-in-law, who had already\r\nsucceeded in estranging her husband and children from her, no doubt led\r\nher to this step.\r\n\r\nMonths went by, and still the Empress continued her wanderings. There\r\nwas a general feeling of sympathy for the Emperor, but in spite of this\r\nmany began to take the part of his young wife, and when the Archduchess\r\nSophie condemned her too harshly, believed that had it not been for\r\n“Madame Mère,” her daughter-in-law would never have gone away. The\r\nestrangement lasted for several years, but Elizabeth, at the urgent\r\nentreaties not only of the court but of her own family, agreed to return\r\nto Vienna once or twice a year to fulfil the state duties required of\r\nher. She remained no longer than necessary, however. The joys of travel\r\nhad become too dear to her, the constraints of court life too irksome.\r\n\r\nFranz Joseph meanwhile was growing more and more unreconciled to this\r\nstate of affairs. The health of the Crown Prince was causing some\r\nanxiety, and his Majesty was urged to make his peace with the Empress.\r\nElizabeth accordingly was approached by her mother, the Duchess\r\nLudovica, for whose opinion she had the greatest respect, and who\r\nfinally convinced her that it was her duty to go back to her children.\r\nTime and loneliness too had softened the bitterness of her feelings and\r\nawakened a mutual desire for reconciliation. Outside events also helped\r\nto bring about the reunion. Misfortune had overtaken Austria: the war of\r\n1866 had driven the Hapsburgs from Italy and Germany, and Elizabeth,\r\nroused to sympathy, turned her face homeward, feeling that her place was\r\nwith the Emperor and his people. Though still young in years her sorrows\r\nand trials had robbed her of her youth, and she came back a woman strong\r\nand self-reliant, caring little for court life, but devoting herself to\r\nhospital work among the wounded soldiers with an energy and\r\nself-sacrifice that earned her the reverence of all. Day after day she\r\nspent at the bedsides of the suffering, speaking to each in his own\r\nlanguage and seeking to satisfy his wants. One man, named Joseph Feher,\r\nhad refused to have his arm amputated, but the Empress begged him so\r\nearnestly to consent to the operation that he finally yielded, and she\r\nwrote to his mother that she would have her son taken to the palace of\r\nLaxenburg and provide for his future. Another day she came upon a\r\nsoldier whose head had been so nearly severed that the physicians had no\r\nhope of saving him. Sitting down beside him, she asked if he had any\r\nlast requests that she might fulfil for him. In a faltering voice he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“Since I have had the happiness of seeing the Empress at my death-bed,\r\nthere is nothing left to wish for in this world. I die happy!”\r\n\r\nWherever she appeared the weakest tried to lift themselves at her\r\napproach. Arms were outstretched to touch her as she passed, and when\r\nshe left, there was a general murmur of—\r\n\r\n“God bless our Elizabeth!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter X\r\n                       The Coronation in Hungary\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain the Archduchess Sophie’s schemes for the house of Hapsburg proved\r\ndisastrous, and Franz Joseph’s eyes were opened at last to the fact that\r\nher sway had been as unfortunate for the country as it was fatal to his\r\ndomestic happiness. In these bitter days of defeat and humiliation he\r\nlearned to value the Empress at her true worth. She now became his real\r\ncompanion. In the latter years of her life he often consulted her in\r\nregard to affairs of state, and she might have exercised a much greater\r\npower in politics had she so desired. But the only matter of government\r\nin which she ever cared to have a voice was in regard to Hungary, in\r\nwhose welfare she always felt the deepest interest. After the Austrian\r\nlosses in 1866 she once said to Count Julius Andrassy:\r\n\r\n“It distresses me to have things go wrong in Italy, but if anything were\r\nto happen to Hungary it would kill me!”\r\n\r\nOne Summer while visiting some baths, she climbed a near-by mountain on\r\nthe summit of which a small chalet had been built. As they entered, her\r\ncompanion, seeing a visitor’s book on the table, wrote in it “Elizabeth,\r\nEmpress of Austria.” Thereupon her mistress drew off her gloves and,\r\ntaking the pen, added in Hungarian, “Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary.”\r\n\r\nThis mutual attachment proved a valuable safeguard during the war of\r\n1866, when the Prussians threatened to advance on Vienna. It was thought\r\nsafest for Elizabeth and the little Crown Prince to retire to Budapest,\r\nwhere she was received with an enthusiasm little short of Maria\r\nTheresa’s memorable reception. There is no doubt that the devotion of\r\nthe people to the Queen was largely instrumental in bringing about a\r\nbetter feeling between Austria and Hungary, while still another proof of\r\nthis devotion was their special request that she might be crowned\r\ntogether with the King, an event that had never before occurred in the\r\nhistory of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the eighth of June, 1867, however, that the coronation\r\ntook place. The ancient city of Pressburg had been the scene of all\r\nformer coronations, but on this occasion the ceremonies were to be held\r\nfor the first time in Ofen and Pesth, or Budapest, as it is now called,\r\nwhich had been made the capital in 1848. The city is one of the most\r\nbeautifully situated in all Europe. On an almost perpendicular rock\r\nstands the royal castle, an imposing structure of great antiquity, and\r\nat its foot, surrounding it on three sides, lies Ofen. The flat and more\r\nmodern town of Pesth is to the left, and beyond it extend boundless\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nBoth cities were in gala attire to welcome the sovereigns. In every\r\ndirection as far as the eye could reach was a sea of waving flags and\r\npennants, and on the spire of the Rathshaus gleamed a huge crown of St.\r\nStephen. The evening before the ceremony was to take place Franz Joseph\r\nand his wife made a visit to the cathedral, which had been magnificently\r\ndecorated for the occasion, and were greeted everywhere with the wildest\r\nenthusiasm. As they were about to leave the church an old man fell from\r\na ladder on which he had perched himself in order to obtain a view of\r\n“the good Queen of Hungary.” Elizabeth, who saw him fall, hastened at\r\nonce to his assistance,—an act that called forth renewed cheers when it\r\nreached the ears of those outside.\r\n\r\nThe town was crowded with Magyars from all parts of the kingdom, and\r\nsixty thousand troops lined the streets from the railway station to the\r\nroyal castle, a distance of six kilometres. It was a most brilliant\r\nsight as the procession wound slowly down from the castle and crossed\r\nthe bridge. Franz Joseph made a stately and imposing figure in his crown\r\nand coronation robes, but Elizabeth was the centre of all eyes. The\r\nsides of the coach were of glass so that she could be seen from all\r\ndirections. It was surmounted by a large crown and drawn by six\r\nmagnificent white horses, their long manes and tails interwoven with\r\ngold. Elizabeth at this time was in the prime of her majestic\r\nloveliness, having not yet reached her thirtieth year, and was\r\nconsidered the most beautiful princess in the whole civilized world.\r\nDeafening “Eljens” greeted her all the way to the cathedral, cannon\r\nthundered, and white-clad maidens showered roses in her path.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the Queen followed a mounted escort of two hundred\r\nyoung nobles in the gorgeous costume of the Hungarian magnate, covered\r\nwith gold and precious stones. Their reins and stirrups were similarly\r\nadorned, and over the left shoulder they wore a leopard skin. The King\r\nand his suite had already taken their places in the cathedral when the\r\nQueen entered. She wore a dress of white brocaded satin and a black\r\nvelvet bodice covered with diamonds. The coronation robe was also of\r\nblack velvet, bordered with white satin. About her neck was a Hungarian\r\nnecklace of diamonds, and on her head she wore the Hapsburg coronet that\r\nhad been made originally for Maria Theresa. It is composed entirely of\r\npearls and diamonds and is valued at three million gulden. While the\r\nKing was being crowned, she remained seated with clasped hands absorbed\r\nin prayer, after which she in turn went through her part of the\r\nceremony. As she resumed her place upon the throne beside the Emperor\r\nwith orb and sceptre in hand, the whole assemblage joined in a mighty Te\r\nDeum which re-echoed from the vaulted roof of the old church.\r\n\r\nThe coronation ceremonies and the enthusiasm with which she was\r\neverywhere received made such an impression upon Elizabeth that she\r\ncould never afterward speak of them without emotion and always regarded\r\nthe occasion as one of the happiest times of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter XI\r\n                     The Archduchess Marie Valerie\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years following the coronation in Hungary were without doubt among\r\nthe happiest of the Empress Elizabeth’s life. She interested herself in\r\nthe details of her children’s education, shared her husband’s\r\noccupations and anxieties, and resumed her place at court with a dignity\r\nand loftiness of purpose that completely silenced her enemies.\r\nConditions too had changed. The Archduchess Sophie had not only ceased\r\nto be a ruling power, but was completely crushed by the death of her\r\nsecond son, Maximilian, in Mexico, where he had been condemned to death\r\nand shot in 1867, after he had reluctantly accepted the throne. His\r\nunhappy wife, whose ambition was partly responsible for these tragic\r\nevents, became hopelessly insane and it fell to Elizabeth’s lot to\r\nsupport and comfort the grief-stricken family.\r\n\r\nThe following year, April 22, 1868, another daughter was born to the\r\nimperial pair at the royal castle at Ofen. It was the first time for a\r\ncentury that a child of the royal house had been born in Hungary, and\r\nthe enthusiasm of the Magyars knew no bounds. All night the streets were\r\nfilled with excited throngs shouting “Eljens” for the King and Queen and\r\nthe new-born Princess.\r\n\r\nThe Archduchess Marie Valerie, as she was christened, became the\r\nEmpress’ favorite child. The two older ones had been kept away from her\r\nso long that at first they were completely estranged and it required\r\nmuch patience and devotion on her part to gain their affection and\r\nconfidence. The Crown Prince, who was ten years old at that time, was a\r\nmost interesting child and already a universal favorite, but under his\r\ngrandmother’s influence he had developed a mixture of wayward pride and\r\nvanity that troubled his mother greatly and which she strove hard to\r\ncorrect. Fortunately, however, Rudolf was tender-hearted and easily\r\ninfluenced, and she succeeded at last to a large extent in overcoming\r\nthe evil effects of the adulation and flattery with which the little\r\nheir had been surrounded. With Valerie she determined it should be\r\ndifferent, and from earliest babyhood her training and education became\r\nthe Empress’ chief care. She was a delicate child, and the mother\r\nwatched over her with a devotion that seemed almost like a reparation\r\nfor what she had failed to give her other children. She was present at\r\nthe lessons of the two elder ones whenever possible and took the\r\ngreatest interest in their education, repeatedly impressing on their\r\nteachers that she did not want them favored or spoiled. She taught the\r\nlittle girls to dance, and the first dance that Valerie learned was the\r\nHungarian Czardas. She tried to implant in them her own love for Hungary\r\nand urged their tutors and governesses “to make them as little German as\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\nChristmas was the most joyful time in the year for the imperial family,\r\nand Christmas Eve, being also Elizabeth’s birthday, was celebrated as a\r\ndouble feast. There were always two trees, the smaller of which the\r\nEmpress decorated with her own hands for the children. She spent days\r\nlooking for appropriate gifts for them and the Emperor, as well as the\r\nvarious members of the court, whose individual tastes she always tried\r\nto gratify. One day, shortly before Christmas, Marie Valerie came to her\r\nmother with a beseeching air and begged that the presents intended for\r\nher might be given to some poor children. Much touched by the idea,\r\nElizabeth consented, and from that time there was always another tree\r\nladen with gifts for the unfortunates.\r\n\r\nThe Empress adored flowers. During her rambles she would gather whole\r\narmfuls, and even when riding would often spring from her horse to pick\r\nwild flowers and fasten them to the pommel of her saddle. Her rooms were\r\nalways filled with them, and if any choice blossom chanced to please her\r\nespecially she would carry it at night into her own bedroom. “Mutzerl,”\r\nas Marie Valerie was called, inherited this passion of her mother’s, and\r\nalmost as soon as she could walk she started little gardens of her own\r\nat the different places where the court stayed in turn. She was her\r\nmother’s constant companion and there was the most touching sympathy and\r\ndevotion between them. “Valerie is not only a daughter to me,” Elizabeth\r\nonce said, “but my best friend and companion.”\r\n\r\nThe Archduchess was remarkable for her simplicity and lack of\r\nself-consciousness, as well as for her dignity and kindness of heart.\r\nElizabeth was a firm believer in the virtues of physical exercise and\r\nhad her daughter taught to ride, fence, and shoot; but Valerie did not\r\naltogether share her love of long walks and rides. She had the\r\nWittelsbach love of art and literature, was devoted to poetry and even\r\nas a child wrote verses of some merit. Remembering the mortifications\r\nher own lack of education had caused her in her early married life, the\r\nEmpress took special interest in Valerie’s education. She had her taught\r\nLatin and Greek, besides several modern languages, and shared her\r\nstudies as much as possible, often poring over some difficult passage in\r\nGreek Scripture with her or learning by heart the most beautiful verses.\r\nThe young poetess looked upon her mother as her most valuable critic and\r\nshowed her all her poems which filled several volumes, deferring always\r\nto the Empress’ judgment and finding in her praise her greatest reward.\r\nShe was devoted to both her parents, but as time went on became almost a\r\nsecond self to her mother—the living token of the reconciliation between\r\nherself and the Emperor, and a consolation for all her loneliness and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter XII\r\n                         The Castle of Gödöllö\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after their wedding the Emperor and Empress visited an\r\nexhibition of paintings in Vienna. Franz Joseph was anxious to purchase\r\nsome of them, but left the choice entirely to his wife, who went back\r\naccordingly a few days later with one of her ladies and selected\r\ntwenty-four, every one of which when sent to the palace proved to be of\r\nhorses. Both at the Hofburg and at Schönbrunn her chief interest was in\r\nthe imperial stables, where she spent most of her mornings trying\r\ndifferent mounts. She loved exercise of all kinds, but riding was her\r\ngreatest delight and her skill and daring as a horsewoman were\r\nremarkable. Authorities in these matters have declared that she outshone\r\nany rider of her own sex, for she had a singular, almost hypnotic power\r\nover horses, and even the most vicious ones would allow her to approach\r\nand stroke them. Her slender wrists were like steel, and there was no\r\nhorse she could not ride when once she had made up her mind to do so.\r\nFear and fatigue were alike unknown to her, and she used often to\r\nterrify the director of the riding-school in Vienna by asking him to\r\nsend her one or two of his wildest specimens to try. A cavalry officer\r\nonce expressed his surprise to the Emperor at his allowing the Empress\r\nof Austria to spend so much time in the stables and make companions of\r\njockeys and circus riders. “Ah, my young friend,” replied the Emperor\r\nkindly, “it is evident you do not know women. They usually do as they\r\nplease without waiting for our permission.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth never appeared to better advantage than when on horseback. Her\r\nhabit, which seemed as if moulded to her figure, was usually dark blue,\r\ntrimmed with fur. She also wore a low round hat and heavy riding-gloves,\r\nbut never a flower or bow or anything superfluous except a black fan,\r\nwhich she carried in her hand or hung by a strap to her saddle.\r\nStrangers generally supposed this was to protect her complexion, but her\r\nfriends were well aware that it was merely to guard herself from the\r\ninevitable photographers who pursued her everywhere. “I hate being\r\nphotographed,” she once declared: “every time in my life that I have\r\nbeen, something dreadful has happened to me.” She liked to attend to her\r\nhorses personally and visited them every morning, taking sugar and\r\ncarrots in her pocket for them, sometimes even going into their stalls\r\nto pet or rub them down. At Schönbrunn she had a room the walls of which\r\nwere completely covered with pictures of horses. “Look,” she once said\r\nto her Greek teacher when showing him this room, “all these are friends\r\nI have lost. Many of them have died for me, which is more than I can say\r\nof any human being. People would far rather have me killed.” She was\r\nnever so happy as when in the saddle, dashing through the forests of\r\nAustria or the wide Hungarian plains. But these long rides also served\r\nanother purpose. On both sides of the house she had relatives whose\r\nlives were darkened by the fatal inheritance of the Wittelsbachs; so it\r\nwas not strange that as she grew older her sensitive nature should have\r\nbrooded over the fear of developing the family disorder. To banish these\r\nterrible fits of depression she would gallop for hours, insensible to\r\nweather or physical exhaustion, sometimes drenched to the skin, and it\r\nwas only when she felt her horse quiver under her with fatigue that she\r\nwould slacken her pace.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the coronation the Hungarians presented to their Queen\r\nthe castle of Gödöllö, situated in the depths of the forest, not far\r\nfrom Budapest, and for many years it was her favorite residence. Here\r\nthere was nothing to break the peaceful seclusion but the plaintive\r\nnotes of the Zingaris’ violins. Here she was her own mistress, spending\r\nlong, happy, care-free days. She usually rose at four o’clock, and was\r\nin the saddle from five till eleven, when she breakfasted. It was an\r\nideal country for riding, and she became familiar with every forest\r\npathway for miles around, often stopping at some camp of the Czikos to\r\nchat with these half-savage Bedouins of the Hungarian Puszta, in whom\r\nshe felt the greatest interest. She brought them gifts of tobacco, and\r\nwas always welcomed with delight by these strange herdsmen.\r\n\r\nBut there were gay times also at Gödöllö in those days, when her husband\r\nand children were there and the castle was full of guests. Her stag\r\nhunts were famous, and the walls were covered with trophies of the\r\nchase. “There is a tree at Gödöllö,” she once said to a companion, “who\r\nis one of my best friends. He knows all my inmost thoughts, and whenever\r\nI go back there I tell him all that has happened to me since we parted.”\r\n\r\nWherever she might be her thoughts turned longingly toward her beloved\r\nHungary, where she was happiest, and among whose romantic, impulsive\r\npeople she always felt most at home. All classes in Budapest adored\r\ntheir beautiful Queen, who wore the national costume of the country and\r\nlost no opportunity of remaining among them. Her courage, gentleness,\r\nand open-hearted generosity made her universally beloved. She would go\r\nabout among the poorest and vilest quarters of the city, helping the\r\nsuffering and needy, quite unconscious of danger or fear. The wretched\r\ncreatures often little suspected who she was, but she was welcomed\r\neverywhere as an angel of mercy, and could go unharmed where even the\r\npolice would scarcely venture.\r\n\r\nOne evening she was riding with a companion through the outskirts of\r\nBudapest, and was just passing a hovel set back a little from the main\r\nroad when they were startled by hearing piercing shrieks from within.\r\nThe voice was that of a woman evidently in the greatest distress. On the\r\nimpulse of the moment they leaped from their horses, and rushing to the\r\ndoor and bursting it open, found themselves in a low, dirty room, where\r\na huge ruffian of a man was dragging a woman about the floor by her\r\nlong, unbound hair, kicking her vigorously as he did so. Without a\r\nmoment’s thought Elizabeth dealt him a blow in the face with her heavy\r\nhunting-crop, which so surprised the fellow that he dropped his victim\r\nand stared at her in blank amazement. Elizabeth’s own astonishment was\r\nstill greater, however, when the ill-used woman arose and sprang at her\r\nlike a tiger, overwhelming her at the same time with the vilest abuse\r\nfor presuming to attack her husband. The Empress burst into a peal of\r\nlaughter, and taking a gold piece from her pocket she handed it to the\r\nman, exclaiming: “Beat her, my friend. Beat her all she wants; she\r\ndeserves it for being so loyal to you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter XIII\r\n                         The Empress in Vienna\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1873 was a memorable one to Franz Joseph and Elizabeth. Their\r\neldest daughter, Gisela, was married, April 20, to Prince Leopold of\r\nBavaria in the Church of the Augustins, where the imperial pair had\r\ncelebrated their union nineteen years before. The bride was led to the\r\naltar by her mother and left that same afternoon with her husband for\r\nMunich. The Viennese overwhelmed the Archduchess with gifts and\r\nentertainments, and the streets were lined with crowds eager to witness\r\nthe departure of the young couple.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward, May 1, 1873, the Emperor and Empress opened the\r\nWorld’s Exposition at Vienna, an event that was celebrated with all\r\nsorts of festivities and made the occasion of a perfect jubilee. The\r\nExhibition was a great success as well as a source of pride to Austria,\r\nas it demonstrated what the country could accomplish in the way of arts\r\nand manufactures in a comparatively short space of time. Many of the\r\ncrowned heads of Europe came as guests to the capital. The old Emperor\r\nWilliam and his clever wife Augusta visited at the Hofburg and\r\nSchönbrunn; Czar Alexander Second of Russia and King Victor Emmanuel of\r\nItaly also came, as did the Shah of Persia and many others.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, however, cared little for people of her own rank. “Titles\r\nmean nothing,” she declared; “they are only the trappings with which we\r\ntry to hide our nakedness; they do not change our real selves.” Little\r\nto her taste as court ceremonies were, she bore her part in them with\r\nease and dignity and was always the centre of interest and admiration\r\nwherever she went. Some years before the fall of the French Empire, the\r\nAustrian sovereigns met Napoleon and Eugénie at Salzburg. The French\r\nEmpress was then at the zenith of her beauty, but Elizabeth with her\r\nglorious eyes and hair and the wonderful charm of her personality did\r\nnot suffer by comparison with the Spaniard nor even with younger\r\nprincesses.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the twenty-fifth anniversary of Franz Joseph’s accession to the\r\nthrone was celebrated with great rejoicings, the festivities culminating\r\nin the evening by the triumphal progress of the imperial pair with the\r\nCrown Prince through the streets of Vienna, which were brilliantly\r\nilluminated and decorated and filled with cheering throngs. But even on\r\nthis occasion it was evident Elizabeth found it an effort to appear in\r\npublic, and she avoided the noise and confusion as much as possible. Her\r\ngrowing reserve and dislike of self-display were taken as a personal\r\noffence by the spectacle-loving Viennese and added to her unpopularity.\r\nShe was considered cold and proud and was taxed with heartlessness and\r\nindifference, a fact of which she was well aware and which only added to\r\nher melancholy.\r\n\r\nShe adored children, rich and poor alike, and at the close of the Vienna\r\nExposition took into her service a little Berber boy named Mahmoud, who\r\nhad acted as page in the Cairene house erected in the Prater by the\r\nKhedive of Egypt and afterward presented to the Empress. Mahmoud adored\r\nhis mistress and she was exceedingly kind to him. When the climate of\r\nVienna affected his lungs and he fell ill with pneumonia, she nursed and\r\ntended him herself, and he became the favorite playmate of the\r\nArchduchess Valerie, greatly to the horror of the Austrian aristocracy.\r\nPatience was not one of the Wittelsbach virtues, and so many false and\r\ncruel reports were circulated about her in Vienna by careless tongues\r\nthat when Elizabeth was informed of the indignation she had aroused by\r\nher kindness to Mahmoud she responded by having the two children\r\nphotographed together and the picture displayed in public. This act of\r\ndefiance naturally added to the number of her detractors, and many even\r\nbegan to hint that the Empress’ restlessness and eccentricities were\r\ncertain signs of approaching insanity.\r\n\r\nBut there was still another reason for the Empress’ unpopularity in the\r\nAustrian capital. Her husband’s German subjects keenly felt her lack of\r\nsympathy with them and resented her unconcealed preference for Hungary.\r\nIt was even rumored that she intended to bestow all her Austrian\r\npossessions upon the Magyars, but this was a rank injustice to\r\nElizabeth, for throughout the Empire, Austria as well as Hungary, there\r\nwas scarcely a charitable institution or cause that she did not aid or\r\nsupport, nor a case of suffering and need that she did not attempt to\r\nrelieve. When Austria took possession of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878,\r\nthe Empress found a fresh field for her energies in caring for the\r\nwounded soldiers and providing for the families of those who were\r\nkilled; and when cholera and smallpox broke out in Budapest, she\r\ninsisted upon accompanying the Emperor, who was obliged to go there for\r\nthe opening of the National Assembly, declaring that in time of danger\r\nher place was at her husband’s side.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Franz Joseph and Elizabeth celebrated their silver wedding, an\r\noccasion not unmixed with sadness to them both, as they looked back on\r\nthe trials and disappointments of their married life. They had requested\r\nthat there should be no public observance of the day, and that the sums\r\ncontributed for that purpose should be given to charity. An exception to\r\nthis was made, however, in Vienna, where a great ovation had been\r\nprepared for the imperial pair. On the spot where the Emperor had been\r\nattacked by Libeny, the Hungarian, a church had been erected to\r\ncommemorate his fortunate escape, and this was to be formally dedicated\r\nas part of the ceremonies of the day. The city was _en fête_, and crowds\r\nhad gathered to salute the Emperor and Empress as they drove to and from\r\nthe church. There was little in their appearance to suggest the storms\r\nthat had shaken their lives, for Franz Joseph was still in the prime of\r\nhis manhood and Elizabeth the youngest and most beautiful of\r\ngrandmothers (her eldest daughter Gisela had several children at that\r\ntime). The festivities, which lasted several days, concluded on the\r\ntwenty-seventh of April with an historical pageant, arranged by the\r\ncelebrated painter Hans Makart and carried out on the most magnificent\r\nscale. Every class, institution, and province in the kingdom was\r\nrepresented, and the various groups costumed with historical accuracy,\r\nthe whole procession making a most imposing spectacle as it moved slowly\r\nalong the Ringstrasse amid the deafening cheers of the spectators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter XIV\r\n                    Marriage of Crown Prince Rudolf\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Franz Joseph and Elizabeth were very proud of their only son, whose\r\nwinning ways and kindness of heart had made him wonderfully popular with\r\nall classes. He had inherited his mother’s impatience of restraint as\r\nwell as her literary and artistic tastes, and, like her, cared little\r\nfor people of his own rank. His own intimate circle was composed of\r\npoets, artists, and journalists, and he had an enthusiastic friend and\r\nteacher in the celebrated naturalist, Brehm. According to the custom of\r\nAustrian princes, he had been required to learn some trade and chose\r\nthat of printing, but he possessed a marked talent for writing and\r\npublished several books of real merit. He adored his mother, and the\r\nrelation between them was one of the closest confidence and intimacy,\r\nbut Elizabeth’s love for her son did not blind her to his faults, and\r\nshe fully realized that he had all his father’s youthful susceptibility\r\nand love of pleasure. Both she and the Emperor were agreed as to the\r\nnecessity of his marrying early, not only to insure the succession, but\r\nalso because they hoped it would steady the rather wild and headstrong\r\nyoung prince. Franz Joseph, however, had political advantages most in\r\nmind in the choice of a wife for his son, while Elizabeth was chiefly\r\nconcerned as to his prospects of domestic happiness. She felt the\r\nimportance of his marrying some one with sufficient beauty and\r\nintelligence to restrain his somewhat errant fancy and win his respect\r\nas well as affection.\r\n\r\nThere were but few marriageable princesses in Europe at that time\r\n(Rudolf was then in his twentieth year), and the Emperor’s choice was\r\nfar from satisfactory to Elizabeth, for it fell on the Belgian princess\r\nStephanie, a seventeen-year-old girl of very ordinary mind and not at\r\nall attractive in appearance. Elizabeth had no liking either for King\r\nLeopold Second of Belgium or his wife, an Austrian archduchess, who\r\nplayed rather an unenviable role at her husband’s court, and bitterly\r\nopposed the match; but the Queen’s sister, the Archduchess Elizabeth\r\n(mother of the Queen Regent of Spain and a favorite cousin of the\r\nEmperor’s) brought all her influence to bear in her niece’s favor, and\r\nthe Empress’ objections were overruled, Rudolf himself, meanwhile,\r\nseeming to regard the whole affair with perfect indifference.\r\n\r\nThe wedding took place May 10, 1881. All through the festivities that\r\npreceded the great event Elizabeth played her part perfectly as mother\r\nof the bridegroom, though her cold and distant manner toward her future\r\ndaughter-in-law as well as the King and Queen of Belgium was only too\r\nevident. Part of the ceremonies consisted of a state procession through\r\nthe streets of the capital, and during the whole progress she hardly\r\nspoke once to Queen Henriette, who rode beside her, but sat erect,\r\nbowing continuously in acknowledgment of the cheers of the populace,\r\nwith a look almost of absentmindedness on her lovely face. In the middle\r\nof the marriage ceremony her self-control gave way completely, however,\r\nand she burst into a violent fit of weeping. This was her last public\r\nappearance in Vienna.\r\n\r\nGay, frivolous, and fond of admiration, Stephanie was a princess to\r\nplease the taste of the Viennese. Her arrival at court was hailed with\r\ndelight, and when on the third of September, 1883, a daughter was born\r\nto the young couple, the public enthusiasm was a proof of their\r\npopularity. A change in the relations of Rudolf and his mother after his\r\nmarriage was inevitable. Though he continued to make her his confidante,\r\nshe was not long in discovering that he was far from happy in his\r\nmarriage. Wretched over this unfortunate state of affairs and feeling\r\nless at home than ever in the Hofburg, she now rarely visited Vienna,\r\nsometimes spending only a few weeks there in the winter.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: _CROWN PRINCE RUDOLF_]\r\n\r\nShe had never liked the Hofburg nor Schönbrunn, where the Emperor always\r\nspent the spring months, and now determined to have a residence of her\r\nown somewhere in the neighborhood of the capital. The spot chosen was\r\nthe beautiful park of Lainz, hidden from the public gaze by high stone\r\nwalls and further protected by a thick, impenetrable hedge surrounding\r\nthe gardens. During the two years that “Waldesruhe,” as she called the\r\nSchloss, was being built it was rigidly guarded from intrusion of any\r\nkind, and even after it was finished no one but the servants and the\r\nfamily were allowed to enter the park or gardens. The building itself is\r\nin the style of the Renaissance, the _façade_ adorned with balconies and\r\nterraces which in the Empress’ time were always a mass of flowers. A\r\nwide marble staircase covered with red velvet carpet led to the first\r\nfloor, which contained the apartments of the Emperor and Empress,\r\nconnected by a great salon or reception hall. Elizabeth’s spacious\r\nsleeping chamber was on the corner, with two windows to the east and two\r\ntall ones to the south, giving upon a balcony. The bed was placed in the\r\ncentre of the room, protected at the head by a large screen, upon the\r\nreverse side of which was a painting of the Virgin Mary. A figure also\r\nrepresenting the Blessed Virgin stood in one corner, holding in her\r\nhands a magnificent antique rosary. Opposite the bed was an exquisite\r\nstatue of Niobe, the pedestal buried in growing plants and lighted with\r\ngreen incandescent lamps so arranged that as the Empress lay in bed she\r\ncould see no light in the room but the green glimmer that fell on the\r\nNiobe. Breakfast was served on the balcony, which was like a flower\r\ngarden. Here too in later years she placed a favorite work of art, a\r\nsmall reproduction of the marble statue of Heine made by the Danish\r\nsculptor Hasselriis for her villa Achilleon at Corfu. Adjoining her\r\nbedchamber and also giving upon the balcony was the Empress’ study,\r\nfilled with photographs of her family and friends, and a picturesque\r\nlitter of casts, sketches, bronzes, souvenirs of travel, and porcelain\r\nvases filled with flowers. Over the great square writing-table hung a\r\nstriking portrait of her cousin King Ludwig Second of Bavaria. A fire\r\nwas always burning on the wide hearth, and the Emperor and Empress used\r\noften to sit there together in the evenings watching the glowing logs\r\nand talking over the events of the day. The guest chambers and\r\napartments of the Archduchess Marie Valerie were on the floor below, as\r\nwas the Empress’ gymnasium. Physical exercise was so necessary to her\r\nthat she always had a room fitted up in this way wherever she happened\r\nto be staying.\r\n\r\nAnother favorite retreat of Elizabeth’s was Miramar, the Emperor\r\nMaximilian’s palace, where for several years after his death she used to\r\nmake frequent visits. Built of the purest white marble, it stands on a\r\nrocky promontory overlooking the sea, and near by is the pavilion used\r\nas a residence by the Empress Charlotte when she returned from Mexico a\r\nwidow and hopelessly insane.\r\n\r\nAt the time Elizabeth was first sent to Corfu to recuperate, the beauty\r\nof the country made a deep impression upon her, and her love for the\r\nshores of Greece after repeated visits in later years decided her to\r\nbuild a villa upon the island, the planning and furnishing of which\r\nshould reflect her own individual taste. Near the idyllic village of\r\nGasturi accordingly there rose the masterpiece of architecture which she\r\ncalled Achilleon. It stands on a hill facing the sea, the slopes of\r\nwhich are covered with olive and lemon trees and laid out as gardens on\r\nwide terraces. The house contains one hundred and twenty-eight rooms,\r\nfilled with treasures of Greek and Pompeian art, and there are\r\naccommodations in the stables for fifty horses. All the rooms are filled\r\nwith classic treasures. The Empress’ own apartments were entirely apart\r\nfrom the rest of the building, with a private entrance so that she could\r\ncome and go at will. She used to rise at five and after her bath would\r\ngo for a walk, usually alone, with a book under her arm. The mornings\r\nwere devoted to study, the afternoons to long rambles. She knew every\r\nroad for miles about, but loved best to explore the steepest and most\r\ndangerous mountain paths, the silent grandeur and beauty of the heights\r\nseeming to soothe for a time the restless cravings of her spirit. At\r\nnine she would retire after another bath in the marble basin which was\r\nbrought from the Villa Borghese in Rome. Heine’s Book of Songs was\r\nalways under her pillow, and often she would rise in the middle of the\r\nnight, unable to sleep, and wander about through the dark avenues. At\r\nAchilleon, as elsewhere, she was most anxious to escape observation, and\r\na high wall of marble with a screen of olive trees hid the palace from\r\nthe public gaze. It was not people, however, that she disliked so much\r\nas being the object of their curiosity.\r\n\r\n“All I ask of people,” she often said, “is that they will leave me in\r\npeace.”\r\n\r\nShe was always kind and gracious to the poor, and the peasants used to\r\nkneel in the dust before her when she approached, calling aloud in their\r\nmelodious language, “O Queen of Beauty, may God bless thine every step!”\r\nAll heads were uncovered when she passed, and the children who watched\r\nfor her coming would run to meet her with their hands full of blossoming\r\norange and almond boughs. On the heights above Achilleon stood a\r\nmonastery where she often used to go and talk with the monks. She asked\r\none of them once if he ever went to the village.\r\n\r\n“There is always the marketing to do,” he answered. “Man is but human,\r\nand the body suffers from cold or hunger; but except for that, what\r\nshould one do in the village? It is far better and more beautiful up\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said the Empress; “undoubtedly you have chosen the\r\nbetter part.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter XV\r\n                     King Ludwig Second of Bavaria\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough all her sorrows and troubles Elizabeth never lost her love for\r\nher Bavarian home or for her own family, with whom she corresponded\r\nregularly. For many years she was in the habit of spending part of every\r\nsummer at Possenhoffen, revisiting the scenes of her childhood and going\r\nabout among her peasant friends, who always spoke of her as “our\r\nEmpress,” forgetful of the fact that this title properly belonged to the\r\nQueen of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe years had brought many sorrows and misfortunes to Duke Max Joseph\r\nand his wife. Their oldest son married an actress of doubtful\r\nreputation. The Princess of Thurn and Taxis early lost her husband and\r\noldest child and was left with the burden of managing the vast family\r\nestates. The third daughter, Marie, like Elizabeth, was elevated to a\r\nthrone at the age of seventeen, by becoming the wife of Francis Second,\r\nKing of the Two Sicilies; but barely a year later Garibaldi’s freelances\r\nrobbed her unworthy husband of his crown and made her a queen without a\r\ncountry. A scarcely happier fate befell her sister Mathilde, who was\r\nmarried at eighteen to Count Louis of Trani, a broken-down _roué_ who\r\nafterward died by his own hand. Neither of these Princesses had seen\r\ntheir husbands before their marriage.\r\n\r\nSophie, Duchess d’Alençon, the youngest of the five sisters, was very\r\nbeautiful and resembled the Empress Elizabeth in appearance, though not\r\nat all in disposition, for those who knew her as a young girl describe\r\nher as being full of animation and vivacity. She became engaged to her\r\ncousin Ludwig Second of Bavaria a year after his accession to the\r\nthrone, and the betrothal met with general approval. He was a strikingly\r\nhandsome young man of twenty at this time, and so desperately in love\r\nwith his cousin that he had a bust made of her by a famous sculptor and\r\nplaced in his winter garden where he could always look at it. Just\r\nbefore the wedding was to take place, however, he suddenly broke the\r\nengagement without a word of preparation or explanation, because he\r\nsuspected that she was untrue to him. There is no doubt that the\r\nPrincess was the victim of a deliberate plot to rob her of the King’s\r\naffection, but Ludwig made no attempt at reparation of any kind and his\r\nbehavior made a breach between him and Duke Max’s family which was never\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nLudwig himself, fed by continual flattery and admiration and with a\r\nmorbid idea of his own dignity, was deeply injured by the supposed\r\nfaithlessness of his _fiancée_. In the first transports of his rage he\r\nseized the bust of the Princess and flung it out of the window, dashing\r\nit to pieces on the stones of the courtyard. Even at the beginning of\r\nhis reign he had shown signs of mental unsoundness, but from this time\r\nhe began to shun the society of his fellow creatures and lived a\r\nsolitary life. He would have nothing more to do with women, and except\r\nfor a few chosen companions would see no one. Even when obliged to\r\nreceive his ministers, he would hide behind a screen. The only exception\r\nhe made was in favor of his cousin Elizabeth, with whom he was a great\r\nfavorite in spite of his erratic ways, and who also was devoted to him\r\nuntil his death. They were much alike in temperament as well as in\r\nappearance, and he always looked forward to her arrival each summer at\r\nFeldafing, near which was one of his favorite retreats, “Roseninsel,” a\r\nsmall island shut in by dense shrubbery and lofty trees. In olden times\r\nit had been the site of a heathen temple which was replaced later by a\r\nRoman Catholic chapel. The gardens, which were laid out by King\r\nMaximilian Second, were greatly enlarged and beautified by his son\r\nLudwig and are said to contain sixteen thousand of the choicest\r\nvarieties of roses, the perfume of which is wafted far out across the\r\nlake. The Hermitage, a small villa in the Italian style, and the\r\ngardener’s cottage are now the only buildings left in this wilderness of\r\nflowers, so overgrown that it is almost impossible to approach the\r\nlittle wharf where King Ludwig used to land from his yacht _Tristan_.\r\nHere he collected all his favorite authors and spent long happy days\r\ndreaming over them or working in the garden, and here too he and\r\nElizabeth would meet and pour out their hearts to each other, alone and\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nAfter all, who can say with certainty where human reason ends and\r\ninsanity begins? “I am not sure,” the Empress once said, in speaking of\r\nShakespeare’s Hamlet, “that those persons who are called mad are not the\r\nreally wise ones.” King Ludwig’s eccentricities became so pronounced,\r\nhowever, that in 1886 he was forced to resign the government and was\r\nsent to Schloss Berg on Lake Starnberg under the care of a physician.\r\nOne June evening they went out to walk together as usual, and when,\r\nafter waiting in vain for their return, a search was made, the bodies of\r\nboth were found at length at the bottom of the lake. Elizabeth happened\r\nto be staying at Feldafing when the catastrophe occurred and was deeply\r\naffected by the King’s tragic death. She hastened at once to the castle,\r\nand entering the room where his lifeless body lay, requested to be left\r\nalone with it. For an hour her attendants waited, and at length, alarmed\r\nat the delay, ventured to enter the apartment, where they found their\r\nmistress stretched upon the floor, apparently lifeless. It was only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty that she was restored to consciousness, and when\r\nat last she did open her eyes, she stared wildly about her for some\r\nmoments, then cried in a shaking voice: “For God’s sake, release the\r\nKing from the mortuary chapel! He is not dead—he is only pretending to\r\nbe so, that he may be left in peace and not tormented any longer.”\r\n\r\nLudwig’s body was carried back to Munich, where he lay in state, the\r\nbier heaped about with wreaths and floral offerings, but on the breast\r\nof the dead King lay a simple spray of jasmine, Elizabeth’s last gift to\r\nher friend and kinsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter XVI\r\n                          The Empress’ Travels\r\n\r\n\r\nUrged by her love of nature and of new scenes as well as by her inborn\r\nrestlessness, Elizabeth, as is well known, spent a great part of her\r\ntime travelling about incognito from place to place like any ordinary\r\ntourist. She never tired of studying strange lands and peoples, and the\r\nconstant change and communion with nature calmed her tortured spirit as\r\nnothing else could. “One should never stay indoors except when\r\nabsolutely necessary,” she declared, “and our homes should be so ordered\r\nas not to destroy the illusions we bring in with us.” The sea had an\r\nirresistible attraction for her, and she would pace up and down the deck\r\nof her yacht for hours sometimes, ordering no one to speak to or\r\napproach her. “The sea is my father confessor,” she used to say; “it\r\nremoves all my cares and troubles and has taught me all I know.” Her\r\nyacht _Miramar_, on which she spent so much of her time, was elegantly\r\nand conveniently fitted up with every comfort. On the deck was a large\r\nround pavilion of glass commanding a view of the sea in all directions,\r\nfor her use in wet weather, but the Empress’ favorite spot was the after\r\ndeck, which was shut off from the rest of the yacht with sail cloth so\r\nthat there should be nothing to interfere with her outlook over the sea.\r\n\r\nShe usually travelled under the name of Countess of Hohenembs, her\r\nMajesty’s thirty-eighth title in the Court Calendar. She loved to\r\nexplore strange, out-of-the-way places, and displayed wonderful\r\nenthusiasm and endurance as a traveller. Of all lands, however, she\r\nloved the East the best. Her favorite cities were Tunis, Algiers, Cairo,\r\nand Alexandria, and she was the first European sovereign to visit Troy.\r\n\r\nHer talent for languages was remarkable. Besides German and Hungarian,\r\nshe had mastered French, English, and Greek, and had a fair knowledge of\r\nLatin. She never cared to learn Italian, indeed she had the greatest\r\ndislike to everything pertaining to Italy, having been subjected to\r\nseveral outrages at the hands of the people of that country. She had\r\nnarrowly escaped death at Trieste in the early eighties, when a bomb was\r\nthrown into the citadel where she was staying.\r\n\r\nOwing to the Empress’ reluctance to appear in public, her features were\r\nnot generally known in Austria, a fact which led to many absurd\r\nsituations. One day when taking the train at Mödling she sent her\r\nservant to order the station-master to have the train stopped at a small\r\nstation near her palace at Lainz. Seeing that the train was about to\r\nstart, she called to the guard: “Tell that man in the black coat to make\r\nhaste!” Whereupon the officer bawled out, “Here, hurry up, you! or else\r\nyour good woman will go off and leave you!” evidently taking the Empress\r\nfor the horrified servant’s wife. It was not always easy to preserve her\r\nincognito on her travels, though she made every effort to do so because\r\nof her keen enjoyment of the adventures which it brought about.\r\n\r\nIn her younger days she used to spend much time in Scotland and Ireland,\r\nwhere she delighted in the hunting. During one of these visits in\r\nIreland the fox she was pursuing sprang over the wall of Maynooth\r\nCollege, near which the chase had led her, and dashed across the\r\nexercise ground where the students were sauntering peacefully about.\r\nGreat was their amazement the next moment when the wall was also cleared\r\nby several hounds and a horsewoman on a magnificent hunter, who had\r\nevidently followed the fox through a pond, for she was dripping wet. The\r\nfox was quickly captured, and the rider dismounted and asked to see the\r\nhead of the college, to whom she explained her identity, requesting to\r\nbe shown to a room where she could change her clothes. No feminine\r\ngarments were to be found, however, in a seminary for young priests and\r\nshe was forced to borrow one of the doctors’ cassocks. While her clothes\r\nwere drying she invited the professors to have tea with her, charmed\r\nthem all with her graciousness, and caused much merriment by her comical\r\nappearance and lively descriptions of her adventures.\r\n\r\nOnce while in Amsterdam, where she occasionally went to be treated by an\r\neminent specialist in nervous disorders, she entered a toy shop to buy a\r\ndoll, saying to her companion:\r\n\r\n“I am sure my granddaughter will be delighted when she gets this.”\r\n\r\nThe shop-keeper, thinking it impossible that this slender,\r\nyouthful-looking person could be a grandmother, made some remark to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I have four grandchildren,” said the Empress, “and to prove it\r\nI will come again soon and buy some toys for the other three. You may\r\nsend them to my daughter, the Princess Gisela in Munich.”\r\n\r\nThe poor shop-keeper was dumfounded and humbly apologized for his\r\nrudeness.\r\n\r\n“You were not rude,” said Elizabeth kindly; “on the contrary, you were\r\nvery flattering.”\r\n\r\nShe was usually regarded as somewhat eccentric in Amsterdam, from her\r\nhabit of always holding a fan before her face in the street, and once a\r\nstreet urchin ran up to her and snatched it away, crying, “Let me see\r\nyour face!” But in spite of the unpleasant experiences which her\r\nincognito occasionally created, she could never be induced to abandon it\r\nand was much displeased when people did not respect her wishes in this\r\nmatter. When one of the servants at a Spanish hotel, where she had\r\nregistered as “Frau Folna of Corfu,” addressed her as “Your Highness,”\r\nshe retorted sharply, “There are no Highnesses in my apartments.”\r\n\r\nShe would often start off on the spur of the moment to see some work of\r\nart of which she had heard without telling any of her suite where they\r\nwere going. Her Greek teacher, Professor Rhousso Rhoussopoulos, relates\r\nthat on one occasion when the Empress was staying at Wiesbaden for the\r\nbaths, he suddenly received orders to get ready to accompany herself and\r\nthe Archduchess Marie Valerie on a journey, and not until they reached\r\nthe railway station did he learn that their destination was\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main, where Elizabeth wanted to see Thorwaldsen’s\r\nreliefs and Danecker’s “Ariadne,” which were in the Rothschild\r\ncollection there. Luncheon had been ordered for them at the station\r\nrestaurant at Frankfort. The Empress was in high spirits, and taking her\r\ndaughter’s arm, walked up and down, watching the people and enjoying the\r\nbustle of the station. She was delighted that no one recognized her and\r\nate the first part of her luncheon with great relish. But when the\r\nsecond course arrived it was specially served on gold plate with extra\r\nattendants; evidently her identity had been discovered. Instantly her\r\ncheerfulness vanished and she hastily finished the meal in order to\r\nescape as soon as possible. There was nothing she disliked so much as\r\nbeing stared at.\r\n\r\nAs Professor Rhoussopoulos was walking with her one day in a North\r\nGerman city, she suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Look how that woman across the street is staring at us! What do you\r\nsuppose it means?”\r\n\r\n“Probably it is only a bad habit she has, your Majesty,” replied the\r\nprofessor; but before the words were out of his mouth the Empress had\r\nrushed across the street and the next moment the two women were in each\r\nother’s arms. It was her sister, the Countess of Trani, who was almost\r\nas fond of travelling as Elizabeth herself.\r\n\r\nWherever she went the Empress was perpetually at warfare with the police\r\nauthorities whose duty it was to watch over her safety. She resorted to\r\nall sorts of devices to elude and mislead them, and their task was no\r\neasy one. Once when she and the Emperor were staying at Mentone, she\r\nsent for the chief of police there and told him that it annoyed her\r\nexceedingly to be continually followed about by detectives and she\r\nwished it stopped. The officer replied that he was compelled to perform\r\nhis duties, and if it displeased Her Majesty there was nothing left for\r\nhim but to resign his position.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” said the Empress. “Remain in Mentone, by all means, and devote\r\nyourself to protecting my husband, for his life is most necessary to his\r\nsubjects. As for me, what am I? A mere stranger and far too unimportant\r\nto attract any attention.”\r\n\r\nAn English journalist was glancing over some books one day in front of a\r\nsecond-hand bookshop in Monza, when the dealer came out and asked him to\r\ngo away, as the lady inside did not wish to be followed about, evidently\r\nsupposing him to be a detective. Curious to know who the lady was, he\r\ncast a searching glance through the window and recognized the Empress.\r\nTaking out one of his cards, he handed it to the dealer with the request\r\nthat he inform his illustrious customer of her mistake. An hour later,\r\nas he was strolling through the palace grounds, he saw Her Majesty a\r\nshort distance in front of him. Not wishing to arouse her suspicions a\r\nsecond time, he was about to turn down a side path, when she beckoned\r\nhim to approach and with much dignity and graciousness explained to him\r\nthe annoyance she was subjected to by the officiousness of the police,\r\nand apologized for the scene at the bookshop. Late the next evening, as\r\nthe journalist entered a well-known restaurant in Milan, great was his\r\namazement to find the Empress seated at one of the tables quite alone\r\nand unattended. As he took his seat near by, one of the waiters came to\r\nher and said:\r\n\r\n“It is rather late, signora, to get anything good; almost everything is\r\ngone.”\r\n\r\n“But I am hungry,” replied Elizabeth; “you will have to find me\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\nThe man disappeared and was back again in a moment. “There is just one\r\ncourse left, signora,” he said, “but it is the best of all. I can\r\nrecommend it, for I have just eaten some of it myself. But it is a\r\ntrifle dear!”\r\n\r\n“How much does this superior dish cost?” asked the Empress, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Eighty centesimi,” said the waiter doubtfully.\r\n\r\nElizabeth laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n“The signora need not laugh,” he went on in an offended tone; “most\r\npeople find it so dear they order only a half portion!”\r\n\r\nThe journalist had sat all this time hidden behind his newspaper, but\r\nthe Empress recognized him at once and addressing him pleasantly with\r\n“Good-evening, Herr Journalist,” continued to converse with him during\r\nthe meal.\r\n\r\nShe was extremely fond of Paris and rarely failed to go there when on\r\nher European tours, though always as Countess of Hohenembs and never as\r\nEmpress of Austria. She would often meet her sisters, the Duchess\r\nd’Alençon and the Countess of Trani, and go about with them, as she\r\ncould do so there without fear of annoyance. One day she took a fancy to\r\nride on an omnibus, but when the driver came to collect her fare she\r\ngave him two pieces of gold, an act of munificence that stunned the\r\nfrugal Parisians and led to her being recognized. Annoyed at the curious\r\ninterest of the other passengers, she hastily alighted and took refuge\r\nin the nearest house, where she waited till the crowd had dispersed and\r\nthen drove back to her hotel in a closed carriage with the shades\r\nclosely drawn, vowing it was the last time she would ever attempt to\r\nride on an omnibus in a city like Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter XVII\r\n                      The Empress’ Literary Tastes\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth was passionately fond of both music and poetry. From her\r\nfather she had acquired a perfect mastery of the zither, but she had\r\nalso a beautiful voice and was a piano pupil of Liszt, and often sung\r\nand played at court charity concerts. Her favorite composers were\r\nRubinstein, Chopin, and Wagner, to the latter of whom she proved a true\r\nfriend by sending him a large sum of money at one of his times of\r\ngreatest need, and after his death she made one of her incognito trips\r\nto Bayreuth to hear the Wagner productions there.\r\n\r\nFor art, too, she had the greatest enthusiasm. Both Makart and Munkacsy\r\nwere warm personal friends of hers and she would often spend hours in\r\ntheir studios. She never went to the theatre in her later years, but\r\nalways manifested great interest in the foremost actors and actresses in\r\nAustria and showed them many kindnesses on various occasions.\r\n\r\nIt was in literature, however, and poetry in particular, that she found\r\nher greatest inspiration and distraction. She was never without a book\r\nin her hand and would sit or wander about for hours so absorbed in her\r\nreading as to completely forget the passage of time, while as for her\r\ngeneral knowledge competent judges have declared it to be amazing. “To\r\nconverse intelligently with the Empress,” said Hasenauer, “one should be\r\nwell versed in history, science, and art.”\r\n\r\nShe translated the whole of Schopenhauer into modern Greek and was an\r\nearnest student of Rousseau and Voltaire. But her prime favorite in the\r\nliterary world was Heinrich Heine, for whom she had the greatest\r\nreverence and admiration; she possessed all his works, many of them in\r\nmanuscript, and many touching instances are told of her kindness to the\r\ngreat poet’s family. She had learned to love his poems soon after her\r\nmarriage, in her first days of sorrow and disillusionment, and they\r\nalways found a responsive echo in her heart. Anxious that his memory\r\nshould be honored publicly, she interested herself in the erection of a\r\nmonument to him in some German city, heading the subscription list\r\nherself with a large sum. The plan was in a fair way to succeed, when a\r\nletter arrived from Bismarck to the cabinet in Vienna, expressing his\r\nsurprise that the ruler of a friendly neighboring country should wish to\r\ndo public honor to a poet who had insulted the Hohenzollerns. As a rule,\r\nFranz Joseph and Elizabeth respected each other’s peculiarities and\r\ndifferences of taste, but in this case, on account of the Triple\r\nAlliance, the Emperor was obliged to ask his wife to remove her name\r\nfrom the list, and, thanks to this episode, it remains for the future to\r\nerect a monument to Heine in Germany. But Elizabeth was determined not\r\nto be thwarted and had her revenge, for, learning that the Danish\r\nsculptor Hasselriis in Rome had already prepared designs for a statue of\r\nher favorite poet, she commissioned him to execute it in marble and had\r\nit placed in front of her palace at Corfu. Apparently the Hohenzollerns\r\ndid not resent this, however, for the then Emperor of Germany was most\r\nattentive to her whenever she was travelling in that country. He always\r\nmade a point of calling upon her with his wife and is said to have\r\nconsidered her one of the cleverest women he ever met.\r\n\r\nThere were not many books that she cared for, but she loved to read her\r\nfavorites again and again. Heine was the only one of the German poets\r\nwhose works she understood and treasured. Neither Goethe nor Schiller\r\nappealed to her, nor did the modern French poets interest her, although\r\nshe thought highly of Lamartine. In English she specially admired\r\nShakespeare and Byron, Shakespeare indeed ranking only second to Heine\r\nin her affections. She made excellent translations of several of his\r\nplays and could repeat whole scenes from them by heart. “Hamlet” and\r\n“Midsummer Night’s Dream” were her favorites, and she had a painting of\r\nTitania and her lover with the ass’s head hanging in each of her\r\npalaces. “Our illusions are the asses’ heads that we all kiss,” she used\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nShe wrote charmingly herself, and while on the long journeys that\r\nconsumed so much of her time she would send long letters every week to\r\nher husband and children, containing brilliant descriptions of her\r\ntravels, bits of poetry or translations, often illustrated with\r\nexquisite pen-and-ink or water-color sketches. These valuable souvenirs\r\nare all preserved in the Hofburg, together with what she called her\r\n“day-book,” a sort of diary covering many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter XVIII\r\n                       Daily Life of the Empress\r\n\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the hereditary disease of the Wittelsbachs, now known\r\nas neurasthenia, which for generations had manifested itself in one form\r\nor another, became more and more pronounced in the Empress Elizabeth.\r\nHer passion for solitude, her aversion to mingling with people, and\r\nconstant craving for change must certainly be regarded as inherited\r\npeculiarities, though she was more ill than was generally suspected. A\r\ncomplication of disorders together with neuritis made her later years a\r\nperpetual martyrdom, yet she bore her sufferings with a patience and\r\nfortitude that her physicians pronounced almost superhuman.\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter sacrifice for her to give up her riding, but fortunately\r\nshe was still able to take the walks and climbs that meant so much to\r\nher. Often, indeed, it was not so much the love of exercise as the\r\neffort to find relief in physical exhaustion from the sleeplessness that\r\ntortured her and secure the rest so necessary to her overwrought nerves.\r\n\r\nAlways a remarkably small eater, her tastes were extremely simple. For\r\nweeks at a time she would live on nothing but milk, and even at state\r\nbanquets often took nothing but a slice or two of wheat bread, a cup of\r\nbouillon, and some fruit. She detested liquor of any sort, and never\r\ntasted it except when the physicians insisted upon her drinking a little\r\nwine for her health. As a rule, she had little respect for medical\r\nknowledge and much preferred to treat herself with her own remedies. She\r\nhad a morbid horror of getting stout. Every day she had herself weighed,\r\nand if her usual weight increased at all she would live on oranges till\r\nit was reduced to the proper amount, in spite of her physicians’\r\nwarnings of the danger of so slender a diet. But although Elizabeth\r\ncared so little for eating, when at home she gave much attention to the\r\nmenus presented to her each morning by the chef, which she often altered\r\nto suit herself. No table could be served more daintily and artistically\r\nthan that of the Austrian court when the Empress was present. She\r\nselected the costliest porcelain and glass and had gold and silver\r\nservices for all her palaces, though they were rarely used owing to her\r\nlong absences.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa had sixteen children, and her son the Emperor Leopold\r\nSecond seventeen; so the Austrian imperial family is a large one, aside\r\nfrom the numbers of foreign princes in Vienna who are related to the\r\nhouse of Hapsburg-Lorraine. But except on one or two state occasions in\r\nthe course of the winter these distant connections rarely saw either\r\nFranz Joseph or Elizabeth. Absorbed in cares of state and caring for\r\nlittle but his shooting trips in later years, the Emperor led almost as\r\nsolitary a life as his wife. When they were together with their\r\nchildren, the Empress always strove to make these reunions as happy and\r\ncheerful as possible, as if to make up in some degree for the family\r\nlife her long absences deprived him of. They would spend long cosey\r\nevenings on the terraces or by the fireside, and Rudolf would often join\r\nthe party, or, if the Emperor were busy, Elizabeth would entertain\r\nherself with Marie Valerie and some of her ladies-in-waiting. The court\r\nin general, however, kept aloof from her. Her manner was cold and\r\nforbidding to those she did not like, though her intimate companions had\r\nthe deepest love and admiration for her and she was worshipped by her\r\nservants, none of whom was too humble to share her sympathy and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nOne morning in Vienna it was learned that one of Elizabeth’s maids had\r\ndied during the night, and very harsh comments were made on the fact of\r\nthe Empress having been seen riding in the Prater on that very same\r\nafternoon. It was not told, however, that she had spent the whole of the\r\nprevious night at the dying woman’s bedside, and it was only when death\r\nhad ended the maid’s sufferings that the Empress had gone out into the\r\nfresh air.\r\n\r\nNature endowed Elizabeth with great beauty, a noble nature, and a good\r\nmind; fate gave her wealth and the most exalted position a woman can\r\noccupy, and she seemed to have been destined for a life of ease and\r\nhappiness. Perfect as she seemed in outward appearance, however, her\r\ncharacter was full of contradictions. She loved nothing so much as\r\nfreedom and solitude, yet when forced to appear in public, no princess\r\nin Europe could equal her for grace and majesty. Simple and economical\r\nin her own tastes and habits, in many respects she had no idea of money,\r\nas, for instance, when she furnished her cousin Ludwig of Bavaria with\r\nenormous sums to gratify his passion for building palaces. Her\r\ngenerosity was boundless, and wherever she went she scattered gifts and\r\nmoney broadcast. She never followed the freaks of fashion, yet her\r\nslender figure was the delight and envy of modistes. She dressed as\r\nsimply as any of her attendants, but whatever she wore it was impossible\r\nto conceal her inborn dignity and air of distinction. Her favorite\r\ncostume for every-day wear was a short, close-fitting skirt with loose\r\nwaist, and she never put on her elaborate court dresses except when\r\nabsolutely necessary, though even these always bore the stamp of her\r\nindividuality. In her later years she was rarely seen in anything but\r\nblack or white; on a few special occasions she would wear light gray or\r\nlilac, but never bright colors. Her hair never lost its beauty, though\r\nbefore her death it began to show a trace of silver here and there,—much\r\nto her annoyance, for she had a horror of growing gray. When loosened,\r\nit fell far below her knees and enveloped her like a mantle. She used to\r\nhave it brushed for hours every day and often grew impatient of the\r\ntrouble it caused her.\r\n\r\n“My hair tires me,” she said one day to her Greek teacher, running her\r\nhands through its waves as if to relieve herself of a burden, “it is\r\nsuch a weight upon my head.”\r\n\r\n“It is Your Majesty’s crown!” was the courtly answer.\r\n\r\n“But not so easy to remove as the other kind of a crown!” she retorted\r\nwith a melancholy smile.\r\n\r\nAnother time she declared impatiently: “I am a perfect slave to my hair!\r\nI think I shall have it all cut off sometime.”\r\n\r\nBut remarks such as these were made only in moments of annoyance and\r\nweariness. As a matter of fact, she was very proud of her magnificent\r\ntresses. It was almost the only sign of vanity she ever displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter XIX\r\n                      Death of Crown Prince Rudolf\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of January, 1889, a terrible affliction befell the\r\nEmperor and Empress in the sudden and violent death of their only son.\r\nThe tragedy of Mayerling is well known in its main points, and hundreds\r\nof different stories have been told concerning it, but the real\r\ncircumstances of the affair are wrapped in impenetrable secrecy, and\r\nperhaps it is just as well if what the King of Belgium wrote to his\r\nbrother, the Count of Flanders, is true.\r\n\r\n“Any report,” he said, “is better than that the real truth should be\r\nrevealed.”\r\n\r\nAll that is known with certainty is that the Crown Prince was found dead\r\nin his bed with a frightful wound in his head at his hunting lodge at\r\nMayerling, near Vienna, where he had been spending a few days. In the\r\nsame room lay the body of a young girl, the Baroness Vetsera, with whom\r\nhe had been in love. It was difficult to believe that both had committed\r\nsuicide, and there are facts which seem to indicate that Rudolf may have\r\nbeen murdered. The rest is all conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Prince was extremely popular with all classes and had\r\nmany brilliant qualities, but after his marriage he developed habits\r\nwhich caused some anxiety as to his future. There was one person,\r\nhowever, who never lost faith in him, and that was his mother. She had\r\nwisely and carefully prepared him for the position he was to occupy in\r\nthe world, and it was to her training and influence that he owed much of\r\nhis early popularity. All Vienna was paralyzed with horror on the cold\r\ngray morning when word was brought from Mayerling of the Crown Prince’s\r\ndeath. No one knew just what had happened. No details of the affair were\r\npublished and the confusion was indescribable. It was thought best to\r\nconvey the news at once to the Empress, though many feared the shock\r\nmight destroy her life or reason. As events proved, however, her mind\r\nand nerves were stronger than those of most people. She seemed stunned\r\nat first and turned away without speaking, her face drawn and colorless,\r\nbut collecting herself she inquired in a dry, unnatural tone where her\r\nson was. Then her thoughts flew at once to her husband, who as yet knew\r\nnothing of what had happened. No one had the courage to tell him, but\r\nwhile the matter was being discussed Elizabeth stepped forward, pale but\r\nquite self-possessed, and declaring that it was her place to break it to\r\nthe Emperor, left the room immediately. During the terrible days that\r\nfollowed the Empress gave ample proof, if it were needed, of her true\r\nnobility and strength of character. With heroic courage she stifled her\r\nown feelings to soothe and comfort her grief-stricken husband, and\r\nsupported him bravely all through the endless ceremonies that\r\naccompanied the burial of their unfortunate child with whom so many\r\nhopes had perished. Well might Franz Joseph say, as he did when\r\nexpressing his thanks to the people of Vienna for their sympathy: “What\r\nI owe to the courage and devotion of my beloved wife in this time of\r\ntrouble, I can never adequately express, and I thank God with all my\r\nheart for bestowing on me so noble a consort.” Ten days later, the\r\nimperial pair, accompanied by Marie Valerie, left Vienna for Hungary.\r\n\r\nRudolf had been the first prince of the reigning house to give promise\r\nof being a really constitutional monarch. He wrote and spoke the\r\nHungarian language like a native, was thoroughly familiar with all parts\r\nof the country, and well liked by both the people and the aristocracy.\r\nIn his death Hungary suffered an irreparable loss, and throughout the\r\nkingdom there was genuine grief over his tragic fate, while the depth of\r\npublic sympathy for the afflicted parents was shown in the warmth of the\r\nreception they received in Budapest. In a conversation with Dr.\r\nChristomanos some years before her death Elizabeth declared: “In every\r\nhuman life there is a moment when one dies inwardly and that need not\r\nnecessarily be the time when death actually takes place.” This moment to\r\nher was when they brought her the news of her son’s death. She was never\r\nthe same afterward. At the time of the catastrophe she had shown the\r\ncourage of a heroine, but after her wonderful self-control had given\r\nway, the reaction was terrible and her despair heart-breaking. “I have\r\nno longer the strength to live nor the desire to die,” she said. It was\r\nreported in Berlin that her reason was destroyed, nor would it have been\r\nsurprising if this had been the case after such a shock. Of course it\r\nwas not true, but she did begin to develop symptoms of a serious heart\r\ntrouble from which she suffered until her death. She never wished to see\r\nthe Crown Princess Stephanie again, nor could she endure the presence of\r\nthe little Archduchess Elizabeth, the grandchild who had inherited her\r\nfather’s nature with the features of a mother to whose behavior the\r\nEmpress attributed the changes in Rudolf’s way of life and his tragic\r\nfate. She shrank from contact with people more and more and often\r\nwounded her husband and children by her craving for solitude. Even her\r\nfavorite palace of Lainz failed to attract her for more than a few\r\nweeks, while at Gödöllö the roses drooped and faded and the grass grew\r\nthick upon her once-loved bridle paths.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: _EMPRESS ELIZABETH in later years_]\r\n\r\nOn the Christmas Eve following the death of the Crown Prince, her\r\nmother’s fifty-second birthday, the Archduchess Marie Valerie was\r\nbetrothed to her cousin Franz Salvator, Duke of Tuscany, an event that\r\nwas a cause of happiness and satisfaction to all concerned. Next to her\r\nparents’ blessing she was anxious to have that of her grandmother, and\r\nthe day after Christmas accordingly she left for Munich, accompanied by\r\nher mother and her lover. Duke Max had died in 1888, shortly after the\r\ndiamond wedding celebration at Possenhoffen, but the Duchess Ludovica,\r\nthough bowed with age and many sorrows, had lost none of her mental\r\nacuteness and the meeting between the old lady and her daughter and\r\ngranddaughter was most touching. From there they went to Wiesbaden and\r\nHeidelberg, where they spent the spring months. As they were returning\r\nto Vienna, they narrowly escaped death by the derailing of the train\r\nnear Frankfort. Several of the coaches were overturned and crushed, but\r\nnone of the imperial party, strange to say, was injured. Scarcely had\r\nthe Empress reached home when she was called to Regensburg by the sudden\r\ndeath there of her eldest sister, Helene of Thurn and Taxis, and after\r\nthe funeral she went again to Munich to comfort her grief-stricken\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Marie Valerie and Franz Salvator that summer was one of\r\nthe few happy events of Elizabeth’s later life. On that occasion she\r\nlaid aside her mourning for a pale gray silk gown, and for the first\r\ntime since Rudolf’s death made an effort to smile and appear cheerful.\r\nBut the brief gleam soon vanished. The Archduchess had been the one\r\nbright spot in her life, and even though she was to remain in the\r\ncountry as the wife of an Austrian prince, Elizabeth realized that the\r\nrelations between them could never be the same again. She had lost her\r\ndearest companion.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of January, 1892, her burden of sorrow was increased\r\nby the death of her mother, and she retired to Achilleon, where she had\r\nhad a monument erected to her unfortunate son that she might be alone\r\nwith memories of her beloved dead. Even her attendants saw her for only\r\na short time each day, and she lived mostly in a world of dreams. Her\r\nfavorite poets still afforded her solace and diversion, but she grew to\r\ncare less for books than for the solitude, which she peopled with\r\ncreations of her own fancy. Her reader sometimes tried to interest her\r\nin new authors, but her thoughts would soon wander and her absent\r\nexpression prove the uselessness of such attempts. Only Shakespeare or\r\nHeine had power to fix her attention, and she would often interrupt her\r\nreading to recite favorite verses or passages to herself.\r\n\r\nThe only court ceremony at which the Empress appeared after the death of\r\nher son was on the occasion of the visit of the present Czar and Czarina\r\nof Russia to Vienna. Her presence at the state reception given in their\r\nhonor excited even more interest and curiosity than did that of the\r\nyoung Czarina herself, and all eyes were fixed upon her as she entered\r\non the arm of the Russian Emperor, smiling and bowing graciously to\r\nthose about her. She was dressed in black, as usual, but looked twenty\r\nyears younger than any of her contemporaries. In spite of all her\r\nsorrows and sufferings she could still be truthfully called the most\r\nbeautiful woman at her court. But her thoughts were continually straying\r\nfrom her guests and from the brilliant scene about her.\r\n\r\n“There often seems to be a thick veil between me and the world, as if I\r\nwere masquerading in the costume of an Empress,” she once remarked.\r\n“When I am with people I only show the part of me that we have in\r\ncommon, and they are surprised that I am so much like them when I talk\r\nabout the weather and the price of candy. It is like taking a dress out\r\nof the wardrobe and putting it on for certain occasions.”\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Hungary celebrated her thousandth anniversary. Elizabeth was\r\neven more miserable than usual at the time, and did not feel that she\r\ncould be present, but it was urged that her absence would cast a shadow\r\nover the festivities, and, ill as she was both in body and mind, she\r\nfinally was persuaded and appeared beside her husband on the throne.\r\nDressed all in black, with a long veil worn Hungarian fashion over her\r\nhair, she sat pale and motionless as a statue, her long eyelashes\r\ndrooping and an expression of unspeakable sadness on her lovely face.\r\nNot a muscle moved as the speaker began his address of welcome. She\r\nseemed neither to see nor hear until he spoke the word “Elizabeth” and a\r\nmighty shout went up from the whole assembly that seemed to shake the\r\nmarble walls of the throne room. Then the majestic head was lowered\r\nslightly, almost imperceptibly, but with wonderful grace and charm in\r\nacknowledgment of this tribute. Again the cheers rose louder than before\r\nand lasted several minutes, even the highest nobles of the kingdom\r\nwaving their tufted kalpaks high in the air.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s head sank, her deadly pallor giving place to a faint flush.\r\nHer eyes opened wide with a flash of their old brilliancy, and a tear\r\nrolled slowly down her cheek. It was plain that the affection between\r\nElizabeth and her Hungarian subjects had undergone no change. The\r\nspeaker went on with his address, the flush slowly faded from her\r\ncheeks, and soon she sat beside the Emperor, a Mater Dolorosa once more.\r\nIt was her last visit to Hungary and her last appearance on the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter XX\r\n                          Death of the Empress\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Empress Elizabeth had no fear of death, though the thought of it was\r\noften in her mind. “I am ready to die,” she used to say; “all I ask is\r\nthat I may not live to suffer.” She had a presentiment that she was to\r\ndie an unnatural death and believed it would be by drowning. Sometimes\r\nwhen walking along the shore or on the deck of her yacht she would say:\r\n“The sea will have me some day; I know I belong to it.” Her forebodings\r\nwere destined to be fulfilled, though in a manner that neither she nor\r\nany one else could have foreseen, for the life that began so like a\r\nsummer idyl ended in a tragedy.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1897 a terrible fate befell her sister Sophie while\r\nassisting at a charity bazar held in Paris by the ladies of the French\r\naristocracy. About four o’clock in the afternoon of the fourth of May\r\nthe lamp of a cinematograph exploded, setting fire to some draperies.\r\nThe hall was a flimsily built structure, and the flames spread with such\r\nrapidity that in a few moments the whole place was a sea of fire and the\r\ngreater part of those present were unable to escape. One hundred and\r\nthirty people perished in this frightful disaster, among them the\r\nDuchess d’Alençon, Ludwig of Bavaria’s former _fiancée_. It was known\r\nthat she must have perished, for her wedding ring was found among the\r\nruins soon after the conflagration, though it was not till some days\r\nlater that her body was found and identified.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Naples and Mathilde of Trani were now Elizabeth’s only\r\nsurviving sisters, and of these the latter was her favorite. They had\r\nmany traits in common, particularly their aversion to society and their\r\nlove of travel. The Countess of Trani, who spent most of her time at\r\nhotels and watering-places, usually went by the modest title of\r\n“Fräulein Nelly Schmidt.” The last Christmas of Elizabeth’s life the two\r\nsisters spent together in Paris, but an acute attack of neuritis forced\r\nthe Empress to hasten southward, and taking her yacht _Miramar_ at\r\nMarseilles, they went to San Remo. Here they stayed for two months,\r\nleaving on the first of March for Territet in Switzerland, where they\r\nparted never to meet again.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was fond of returning to familiar places, and Lake Geneva was\r\none of her favorite spots. From Territet she used to go every day by\r\nrail to Glion and from there on foot to Mont de Caux, accompanied only\r\nby one of her ladies or her reader, a young man named Frederick Barker.\r\n\r\nAfter a six weeks’ stay in Switzerland she returned to Vienna and went\r\nwith the Emperor to Lainz. Never had her mind appeared so clouded as\r\nnow. The veil of melancholia had settled over her thicker and heavier\r\nthan ever. Her glance was restless, there was an unspeakable weariness\r\nin her expression, and hard and bitter lines had appeared about her\r\nmouth. Constant suffering made life a torment to her and she could find\r\nno rest day or night.\r\n\r\nEarly in August she went as usual with her husband and Valerie’s family\r\nto Ischl to celebrate the Emperor’s birthday. It was the only day in the\r\nyear on which she laid aside her mourning, and the imperial pair usually\r\nwent together to church. This time, however, she left earlier and went\r\nto Mannheim to take some special massage treatment recommended by her\r\nphysicians. Her health improved so much that she was able to eat and\r\nsleep again and to resume her excursions about the neighborhood, though\r\nstill too weak to take the long walks and climbs she was so fond of.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of August she went back to Switzerland, this time by\r\nspecial train to Mont de Caux, where she could be more quiet than at\r\nTerritet. She seemed unusually well, and those who met the slender\r\nblack-robed foreign lady, chatting familiarly with her one companion,\r\nlittle surmised that she was the sovereign of one of the greatest powers\r\nof Europe and ruler over more than forty million people. In a letter to\r\nthe Emperor written at this time she expressed regret that he was not\r\nsharing the peace and pleasure of her stay here and urged him to join\r\nher, declaring that she was feeling so much better she hoped to be\r\npresent at his approaching jubilee, the fiftieth anniversary of his\r\naccession to the throne.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of September she suddenly decided to make a visit to\r\nPregny, a beautiful villa on the shores of Lake Geneva, that had once\r\nbelonged to Joseph Bonaparte, but is now in the possession of the\r\nRothschild family. The Baroness Adolph Rothschild had been very kind to\r\nthe Queen of Naples in her days of misfortune, and Elizabeth was anxious\r\nto show her some attention.\r\n\r\nShe had gone for a stroll the preceding afternoon in the neighborhood of\r\nTerritet with her reader, Mr. Barker, who had taken with him a basket of\r\nfruit for her refreshment. Seating herself on some moss-grown rocks, the\r\nEmpress peeled a peach, half of which she offered to her companion. Just\r\nas she was in the act of handing it to him, a huge raven flew down from\r\na tree near by, flapping its wings almost in her face and knocking the\r\npeach from her hand. Remembering the famous legend of the raven, which\r\nis always said to appear to the Hapsburgs as a forerunner of misfortune,\r\nthe startled reader sprang to his feet in alarm and begged her to\r\nabandon the trip to Geneva.\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid, my friend,” replied Elizabeth. “We must all meet our\r\nfate sooner or later, and whatever is destined to happen will happen.\r\nNothing we can do will alter it. You know I am a fatalist.”\r\n\r\nThe next day she went to Pregny, as she had planned, accompanied only by\r\nher Hungarian lady-in-waiting, the Countess Sztaray. She was in a\r\nremarkably cheerful mood, most gracious and friendly with the Baroness\r\nand much pleased with her visit. Late in the afternoon she arrived at\r\nthe Hôtel Beaurivage, where she was in the habit of staying. Every\r\nprecaution had been taken as usual to preserve her incognito, though the\r\nservants, remembering her from former visits, were no doubt well aware\r\nof her identity. On her first arrival in Switzerland the police of the\r\ncanton had been charged to watch over her safety, but she had wished as\r\nusual to be spared their espionage and left to go her own way.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the tenth of September, 1898, she left the hotel with her\r\nlady-in-waiting to take the steamer to Mont de Caux. They were a little\r\nlate, and the Countess Sztaray hurried on in advance of her mistress to\r\nsignal the captain to wait for them. Just at that moment a man arose\r\nfrom a bench on the quay where he had been sitting as they passed. It\r\nwas the Italian Luigi Luccheni, a dangerous anarchist on whom the Swiss\r\nauthorities had been warned to keep a watchful eye. With one bound he\r\nflung himself upon the Empress and plunged a dagger into her breast. The\r\nCountess was unaware that anything had happened, but turning just in\r\ntime to see her mistress stagger, ran and caught her in her arms.\r\n\r\n“Is Your Majesty ill?” she asked in alarm.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“Will Your Majesty take my arm?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I do not think I need it.”\r\n\r\nThough ghastly pale, she walked to the steamer without assistance,\r\ncrossed the gang-plank, and then fell fainting to the deck. The steamer\r\nstarted, and the Countess Sztaray with some of the women on board\r\nendeavored to restore her to consciousness. No one suspected that she\r\nhad been wounded until the Countess, loosening her dress to give her\r\nmore air, discovered stains of blood on her clothing. Just then\r\nElizabeth opened her eyes and in a clear, distinct voice asked, “What\r\nhas happened?” then sank again into unconsciousness. Now thoroughly\r\nalarmed, the Countess informed the captain of her mistress’ identity,\r\nand the boat was turned back at once to Geneva, where Elizabeth was\r\ncarried on a stretcher to the hotel and laid upon her bed. Three\r\nphysicians who happened to be staying there at the time were hastily\r\nsummoned and did all in their power to revive her, but in vain: about\r\nthree o’clock she gave one or two deep sighs and passed away quietly and\r\npainlessly, as she had so often expressed a wish to do.\r\n\r\nSo cold-blooded and unprovoked an assault in broad daylight and in the\r\npublic street of a large city was one of the most shocking crimes of\r\nmodern times and aroused the horror and indignation of the whole\r\ncivilized world. Elizabeth of Austro-Hungary had no enemies. She had\r\nexerted no influence in politics, directly or indirectly, nor was she\r\ninterested in state affairs. As her grief-stricken husband said of her,\r\n“she had done much good and never harmed a human being.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress’ salon in the hotel was quickly transformed into a mortuary\r\nchapel. The walls were hung with black, tall candles placed about the\r\ncoffin, at the foot of which knelt monks reciting prayers for the dead,\r\nand over the bier fell a purple velvet pall, in the corner of which some\r\nyoung Swiss girls had embroidered the words “_Répose en paix._”\r\nElizabeth was dressed as she had been in life, in black, her hands\r\nfolded over a rosary and an ivory crucifix. The beautiful features were\r\nnot altered, but had changed their look of suffering to an expression of\r\nwonderful majesty and peace.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the eleventh of September a special train bearing her\r\nremains left Geneva and passed slowly through Switzerland and Austria\r\namid the tolling of bells, and was met at every stop by sorrowing\r\nthrongs eager to pay a last tribute to the dead Empress.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was overwhelmed with messages of sympathy from all parts of\r\nthe globe. Flowers and funeral wreaths came from high and low alike in\r\nevery land that she had visited. Even China and the Transvaal sent\r\nofferings to lay upon the Empress’ coffin. From Cairo came a wreath made\r\nof desert blooms, hundreds of Jericho roses, the old Christian emblem of\r\nthe resurrection, and lotus blossoms, symbolic of eternity.\r\n\r\nHer death made almost as deep an impression in most of the foreign\r\ncapitals as in Vienna, where for years she had been so little seen that\r\nher Austrian subjects had almost forgotten how she looked, and her\r\nassassination aroused less sorrow than rage against the wretch who could\r\nhave slain a defenceless woman.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, however, the public mourning was deep and profound. Every\r\nflag was at half-mast and the streets were full of sobbing men and\r\nwomen. The great autumn manœuvres were abandoned, and it was decreed\r\nthat her biography should be recorded in the national archives, so that\r\nher memory might be forever preserved in the history of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Elizabeth’s personal fortune was a large one. Her jewels\r\nalone—presents from Franz Joseph and other royal personages—were valued\r\nat four million gulden. Her will was made at Budapest in 1896. It was\r\nvery short and written in her own hand. Her palace at Lainz was\r\nbequeathed to her daughter Valerie; Achilleon, in Corfu, to the elder,\r\nGisela. All her servants and ladies-in-waiting received legacies, and a\r\nnumber of old friends were also remembered. To her old reader and\r\ncompanion, Ida von Ferenczy, who had been with her for thirty years, she\r\nleft an annuity, besides a considerable sum of money and a life\r\nresidence in the imperial palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn earlier days Elizabeth had expressed a wish to be buried at Gödöllö,\r\nthen her favorite residence, but in her will she mentioned Achilleon as\r\nher chosen place of burial. Her desire was not fulfilled, however.\r\nIndulgent as Franz Joseph had been toward his wife’s eccentricities\r\nduring her lifetime, he was not willing that her hatred of\r\nconventionality should be exhibited in her death, and determined that\r\nher body should be laid to rest with those of former Empresses and\r\nmembers of his family.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of Vienna there stands an insignificant-looking chapel\r\nbelonging to the Capuchins. Above a side door are the words “Imperial\r\nVaults,” and a flight of well-worn steps leads down into the dim\r\nburial-place of the royal race of Hapsburg. It was into this chamber\r\nthat the great Maria Theresa used to force her gay young daughters to\r\ndescend to meditate on the perishability of all earthly greatness, and\r\nhere she herself would spend hours beside the tomb of her husband. At\r\nthe end of a cross passage stands the tomb of the murdered Empress,\r\nbetween that of her brother-in-law, the murdered Emperor of Mexico, and\r\nher son Rudolf, who also met with a violent end.\r\n\r\nIn life she had shunned all religious observances; now masses are said\r\nday and night for the repose of her soul. Every morning the gates of the\r\ncrypt are opened, and she who in life so loved solitude and seclusion is\r\na mark for the gaze of hundreds of curious sightseers.\r\n\r\nHow much more fitting a place of rest for the nature-loving Empress the\r\nsunny shores of her Greek island would have been than the gloomy burial\r\nchamber of the Capuchins! How much finer a requiem the sighing of winds\r\nand waters than the chantings of vestured priests!\r\n\r\nTo the world in general Elizabeth of Austria and Hungary will be little\r\nremembered as the queenly sovereign in all the insignia of her lofty\r\nrank, but rather as the beautiful and unfortunate daughter of the\r\nWittelsbachs, following her solitary way through life, her lonely spirit\r\never seeking rest and peace in vain. Terrible as it seemed to die by the\r\nhand of an assassin in a foreign country, far from all she loved, the\r\ndagger of Luccheni was but the instrument of fate, and death came to her\r\nalmost as a friend. She died, as she had often wished to die, swiftly\r\nand painlessly and under the open sky. Who shall say that her last\r\nearthly breath was not a sigh of thankfulness and peace?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Footnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]A few days before the death of the Empress Elizabeth, in 1898, this\r\n   bridge was torn down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Appendix\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a chronological statement of important events connected\r\nwith the life of Elizabeth, Empress of Austria:\r\n\r\n    1837     Birth of Elizabeth.\r\n    1853     Betrothal to Franz Joseph.\r\n    1854     Marriage.\r\n    1856     Visit to Austrian Alps.\r\n    1855     Birth of Sophie Dorothea.\r\n    1856     Birth of second daughter, Gisela.\r\n    1858     Birth of Crown Prince Rudolf.\r\n    1859     Sardinian War.\r\n    1866     Estrangement of Emperor and Empress.\r\n    1866     War with Prussia.\r\n    1867     Elizabeth Crowned Queen of Hungary.\r\n    1868     Birth of Marie Valerie.\r\n    1878     War with Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n    1881     Marriage of Prince Rudolf.\r\n    1889     Death of Prince Rudolf.\r\n    1896     Hungary Celebrated Thousandth Anniversary.\r\n    1898     Elizabeth Killed by an Assassin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LIFE STORIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE\r\n\r\n                    _Translated from the German by_\r\n                            GEORGE P.
