While developing\r\nthe rich resources with which nature has so munificently endowed her,\r\nshe ought not to neglect her past, which teaches so many useful lessons,\r\nand carries with it so many proud recollections. Her documentary\r\nhistory, lying, much of it, scattered and fragmentary, in part\r\nslumbering in the dusty oblivion of Transatlantic archives, ought to be\r\ncollected with pious care, and embalmed in the perpetuity of print.\r\n\r\nThe work now presented to the reader will be found to be written in\r\nconformity with the following maxim of Lord Bacon: \"It is the office of\r\nhistory to represent the events themselves, together with the counsels,\r\nand to leave the observations and conclusions thereupon, to the liberty\r\nand faculty of every man's judgment.\"\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to express my acknowledgments to Hugh B.\r\nGrigsby, Esq., (who has contributed so much to the illustration of\r\nVirginia history by his own writings,) for many valuable suggestions,\r\nand for having undergone the trouble of revising a large part of the\r\nmanuscript of this work.\r\n\r\n  PETERSBURG, VA., _September 2d, 1859_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.--Early Voyages of Discovery.

To Columbus belongs the glory of\r\nhaving made the first certain discovery of the New World, in the year\r\n1492; but it was the good fortune of the Cabots to be the first who\r\nactually reached the main land. In 1497, John Cabot, a Venetian\r\nmerchant, who had become a resident of Bristol in England, with his son\r\nSebastian, a native of that city, having obtained a patent from Henry\r\nthe Seventh, sailed under his flag and discovered the main continent of\r\nAmerica, amid the inhospitable rigors of the wintry North. It was\r\nsubsequent to this that Columbus, in his third voyage, set his foot on\r\nthe main land of the South. In the following year, Sebastian Cabot\r\nagain crossed the Atlantic, and coasted from the fifty-eighth degree of\r\nnorth latitude, along the shores of the United States, perhaps as far as\r\nto the southern boundary of Maryland. Portuguese, French, and Spanish\r\nnavigators now visited North America.\r\n\r\nDreadful circumstances attended the foundation of the ancient St.\r\nAugustine. The blood of six hundred French Protestant refugees has\r\nsanctified the ground at the mouth of St. John's River, where they were\r\nmurdered \"not as Frenchmen, but as heretics,\" by the ruthless Adelantado\r\nof Florida, Pedro Menendez, in the year 1565.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the ensuing year he sent a captain, with thirty\r\nsoldiers and two Dominican monks, \"to the bay of Santa Maria, which is\r\nin the latitude of thirty-seven degrees,\" together with the Indian\r\nbrother of the cacique, or chief of Axacan, (who had been taken thence\r\nby the Dominicans, and baptized at Mexico, by the name of the Viceroy\r\nDon Luis de Velasco,) to settle there, and undertake the conversion of\r\nthe natives. But this expedition sailed to Spain instead of landing.\r\n\r\nThis region of Axacan comprised the lower part of the present State of\r\nNorth Carolina. The Spanish sound of the word is very near that of\r\nWocokon, the name of the place, according to its English pronunciation,\r\nwhere the colony sent out by Raleigh subsequently landed.[18:A]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1570 Father Segura and other Jesuit missionaries,\r\naccompanied by Don Luis, visited Axacan, but were treacherously cut off\r\nby him. In the same year, or the following, the Spaniards repaired to\r\nthe place of their murder and avenged their death.[18:B]\r\n\r\nIn 1573 Pedro Menendez Morquez, Governor of Florida, explored the Bay of\r\nSanta Maria, \"which is three leagues wide, and is entered toward the\r\nnorthwest. In the bay are many rivers and harbors on both sides, in\r\nwhich vessels may anchor. Within its entrance on the south the depth is\r\nfrom nine to thirteen fathoms, (about five feet nine inches English,)\r\nand on the north side from five to seven; at two leagues from it in the\r\nsea, the depth is the same on the north and the south, but there is more\r\nsand within. In the channel there are from nine to thirteen fathoms; in\r\nthe bay fifteen, ten, and six fathoms; and in some places the bottom\r\ncannot be reached with the lead.\" Barcia describes the voyage of Morquez\r\nfrom Santa Helena \"to the Bay of Santa Maria, in the latitude of\r\nthirty-seven degrees and a half,\"[19:A] and makes particular mention of\r\nthe shoal running out from what is now Cape Lookout, and that near Cape\r\nHatteras, the latitude and distances given leaving no doubt but that the\r\nBay of Santa Maria is the same with the Chesapeake.[19:B] Ten years will\r\nprobably include the period of these early Spanish visits to Axacan and\r\nthe Chesapeake; and these explorations appear to have been unknown to\r\nthe English, and Spain made no claim on account of them. Had she set\r\nforth any title to Virginia, Gondomar would not have failed to urge it,\r\nand James the First would have been, probably, ready to recognize it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1578 Sir Humphrey Gilbert obtained from Queen Elizabeth\r\nletters patent, authorizing him to discover and colonize remote heathen\r\ncountries unpossessed by any Christian prince. After one or two\r\nunsuccessful expeditions, Sir Humphrey again set sail in 1583, from\r\nPlymouth, with a fleet of five small vessels. The largest of these, the\r\nbark Raleigh, was compelled in two days to abandon the expedition, on\r\naccount of an infectious disease that broke out among the crew.\r\n\r\nAfter Cabot's discovery, for many years the vessels of various flags had\r\nfrequented the northern part of America for the purpose of fishing, and\r\nwhen Sir Humphrey reached St. John's Harbor, the thirty-six fishing\r\nvessels found there at first refused him admittance; but upon his\r\nexhibiting the queen's commission they submitted. He then entered the\r\nharbor, landed, and took formal possession of the country for the crown\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nAs far as time would admit, some survey of the country was made, the\r\nprincipal object of which was the discovery of mines and minerals; and\r\nthe admiral listened with credulity to the promises of silver. The\r\ncompany being dispersed abroad, some were taken sick and died; some hid\r\nthemselves in the woods, and others cut one of the vessels out of the\r\nharbor and carried her off. At length the admiral, having collected as\r\nmany of his men as could be found, and ordered one of his vessels to\r\nremain and take off the sick, set sail with three vessels, intending to\r\nvisit Cape Breton and the Isle of Sable; but one of his vessels being\r\nlost on a sand-bank, he determined to return to England. The Squirrel,\r\nin which he had embarked for the survey of the coast, was very small and\r\nheavily laden, yet this intrepid navigator persisted in remaining on\r\nboard of her, notwithstanding the urgent entreaties of his friends in\r\nthe other and larger vessel, the Hind; in reply to which, he declared,\r\nthat he would not desert his little crew on the homeward voyage, after\r\nhaving with them passed through so many storms and perils. And after\r\nproceeding three hundred leagues, the little bark, with the admiral and\r\nall her crew, was lost in a storm. When last seen by the company of the\r\nHind, Sir Humphrey, although surrounded by imminent perils, was seated\r\ncomposedly on the deck with a book in his hand, and as often as they\r\napproached within hearing was heard to exclaim: \"Be of good cheer, my\r\nfriends; it is as near to heaven by sea as by land.\" At midnight the\r\nlights of the little vessel suddenly disappeared, and she was seen no\r\nmore. Sir Humphrey Gilbert was descended from an ancient family in\r\nDevonshire; his father was Otho Gilbert, Esq., of Greenway, and his\r\nmother, Catharine, daughter of Sir Philip Champernon, of Modbury. He was\r\neducated at Oxford, and became distinguished for courage, learning, and\r\nenterprise. Appointed colonel in Ireland, he displayed singular energy\r\nand address. In the year 1571 he was a member of the House of Commons\r\nfrom Compton, his native place. He strenuously defended the queen's\r\nprerogative against the charge of monopoly, alleged by a Puritan member\r\nagainst an exclusive grant made to some merchants. He was the author of\r\nseveral publications on cosmography and navigation. Having attracted the\r\nattention of the queen in his boyhood, she at length knighted him, and\r\ngave him one of her maids of honor in marriage. When he was preparing\r\nfor his voyage she sent him a golden anchor with a large pearl at the\r\npeak, which he ever after prized as a singular honor. Raleigh\r\naccompanied this present, which was sent through his hands with this\r\nletter: \"I have sent you a token from her majesty--an anchor guided by a\r\nlady, as you see; and farther, her highness willed me to send you word\r\nthat she wished you as great hap and safety to your ship as if herself\r\nwere there in person, desiring you to have care of yourself as of that\r\nwhich she tendereth. Farther, she commandeth that you leave your picture\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\nNot daunted by the fate of his heroic kinsman, Raleigh adhered to the\r\ndesign of effecting a settlement in America, and being now high in the\r\nqueen's favor, obtained letters patent for that purpose, dated March,\r\n1584. Aided by some gentlemen and merchants, particularly by his gallant\r\nkinsman Sir Richard Grenville, and Mr. William Sanderson, who had\r\nmarried his niece, Raleigh succeeded in providing two small vessels.\r\nThese were put under the command of Captains Philip Amadas and Arthur\r\nBarlow. Barlow had already served with distinction under Raleigh in\r\nIreland. The two vessels left the Thames in April, 1584, and pursuing\r\nthe old circuitous route by the Canaries, reached the West Indies. After\r\na short stay there they sailed north, and early in July, as they\r\napproached the coast of Florida, the mariners were regaled with the\r\nodors of flowers wafted from the fragrant shore. Amadas and Barlow,\r\nproceeding one hundred and twenty miles farther, landed on the Island of\r\nWocokon, in the stormy region of Cape Hatteras, one of a long series of\r\nnarrow, low, sandy islands--breakwaters apparently designed by nature to\r\ndefend the mainland from the fury of the ocean. The English took\r\npossession of the country in the queen's name. The valleys were wooded\r\nwith tall cedars, overrun with vines hung in graceful festoons, the\r\ngrapes clustering in rich profusion on the ground and trailing in the\r\nmurmuring surges of the sea. For two days no inhabitant was seen; on\r\nthe third a canoe with three men approached, one of whom was readily\r\npersuaded to come on board, and some presents gained his confidence.\r\nGoing away, he began to fish, and having loaded his canoe, returned, and\r\ndividing his cargo into two parts, signified that one was for the ship,\r\nthe other for the pinnace. On the next day they were visited by some\r\ncanoes, in which were forty or fifty men, among whom was Granganameo,\r\nthe king's brother. The king Wingina himself lay at his chief town, six\r\nmiles distant, confined by wounds received in a recent battle. At this\r\ntown the English were hospitably entertained by Granganameo's wife. She\r\nwas small, pretty, and bashful, clothed in a leathern mantle with the\r\nfur turned in; her long dark hair restrained by a band of white coral;\r\nstrings of beads hung from her ears and reached to her waist. The\r\nmanners of the natives were composed; their disposition seemed gentle;\r\npresents and traffic soon conciliated their good will. The country was\r\ncalled Wingandacoa.[22:A] The soil was productive; the air mild and\r\nsalubrious; the forests abounded with a variety of sweet-smelling trees,\r\nand oaks superior in size to those of England. Fruits, melons, nuts, and\r\nesculent roots were observed; the woods were stocked with game, and the\r\nwaters with innumerable fish and wild-fowl.\r\n\r\nAfter having discovered the Island of Roanoke on Albemarle Sound, and\r\nexplored as much of the interior as their time would permit, Amadas and\r\nBarlow sailed homeward, accompanied by two of the natives, Manteo and\r\nWanchese. Queen Elizabeth, charmed with the glowing descriptions of the\r\nnew country, which the enthusiastic adventurers gave her on their\r\nreturn, named it, in allusion to her own state of life, VIRGINIA. As\r\nhitherto all of North America as far as discovered was called Florida,\r\nso henceforth all that part of it lying between thirty-four and\r\nforty-five degrees of north latitude came to be styled Virginia, till\r\ngradually by different settlements it acquired different names.[22:B]\r\n\r\nRaleigh was shortly after returned to Parliament from the County of\r\nDevon, and about the same time knighted. The queen granted him a patent\r\nto license the vending of wines throughout the kingdom. Such a monopoly\r\nwas part of the arbitrary system of that day. Nor was Sir Walter\r\nunconscious of its injustice, for when, some years afterwards, a spirit\r\nof resistance to it showed itself in the House of Commons and a member\r\nwas warmly inveighing against it, Sir Walter was observed to blush. He\r\nvoted afterwards for the abolition of such monopolies, and no one could\r\nhave made a more munificent use of such emoluments than he did in his\r\nefforts to effect the discovery and colonization of Virginia. He fitted\r\nout, in 1585, a fleet for that purpose, and entrusted the command to his\r\nrelative, Sir Richard Grenville. This gallant officer, like Cervantes,\r\nshared in the famous battle of Lepanto, and after distinguishing himself\r\nby his conduct during the Irish rebellion, had become a conspicuous\r\nmember of Parliament. He was accompanied by Thomas Cavendish, afterwards\r\nrenowned as a circumnavigator of the globe; Thomas Hariot, a friend of\r\nRaleigh and a profound mathematician; and John Withe, an artist, whose\r\npencil supplied materials for the illustration of the works of De Bry\r\nand Beverley. Late in June the fleet anchored at Wocokon, but that\r\nsituation being too much exposed to the dangers of the sea, they\r\nproceeded through Ocracock Inlet to the Island of Roanoke, (at the mouth\r\nof Albemarle Sound,) which they selected as the seat of the colony. The\r\ncolonists, one hundred and eight in number, were landed there. Manteo,\r\nwho had returned with them, had already been sent from Wocokon to\r\nannounce their arrival to his king, Wingina. Grenville, accompanied by\r\nLane, Hariot, Cavendish and others, explored the coast for eighty miles\r\nsouthward, to the town of Secotan, in the present County of Craven,\r\nNorth Carolina. During this excursion the Indians, at a village called\r\nAquascogoc, stole a silver cup, and a boat being dispatched to reclaim\r\nit, the terrified inhabitants fled to the woods, and the English,\r\nregardless alike of prudence and humanity, burned the town and destroyed\r\nthe standing corn. Grenville in a short time re-embarked for England\r\nwith a valuable cargo of furs, and on his voyage captured a rich Spanish\r\nprize.\r\n\r\nLane extended his discoveries to the northward, as far as the town of\r\nChesapeakes, on Elizabeth River, near where Norfolk stands, and about\r\none hundred and thirty miles from the Island of Roanoke. The Chowan\r\nRiver was also explored, and the Roanoke, then known below the falls as\r\nthe Moratoc. Lane, although a good soldier, seems to have wanted some of\r\nthe qualities indispensable in the founder of a new plantation. The\r\nIndians grew more hostile; conspiracies were entered into for the\r\ndestruction of the whites, and the rash and bloody measures employed to\r\ndefeat their machinations aggravated the mischief. The colonists, filled\r\nwith alarm, became impatient to escape from a scene of so many\r\nprivations and so much danger. Owing to a scarcity of provisions, Lane\r\ndistributed the colonists at several places. At length Captain Stafford,\r\nwho was stationed at Croatan, near Cape Lookout, descried twenty-three\r\nsail, which proved to be Sir Francis Drake's fleet. He was returning\r\nfrom a long cruise--belligerent, privateering, and exploratory--and, in\r\nobedience to the queen's orders, now visited the Colony of Virginia to\r\nrender any necessary succor. Upon learning the condition of affairs, he\r\nagreed to furnish Lane with vessels and supplies sufficient to complete\r\nthe discovery of the country and to insure a safe return home, should\r\nthat alternative be found necessary. Just at this time a violent storm,\r\nraging for four days, dispersed and shattered the fleet, and drove out\r\nto sea the vessels that had been assigned to Lane. The tempest at length\r\nsubsiding, Drake generously offered Lane another vessel with supplies.\r\nBut the harbor not being of sufficient depth to admit the vessel, the\r\ngovernor, acquiescing in the unanimous desire of the colonists,\r\nrequested permission for them all to embark in the fleet, and return to\r\nEngland. The request was granted; and thus ended the first actual\r\nsettlement of the English in America.\r\n\r\nDuring the year which the colony had passed at Roanoke, Withe had made\r\ndrawings from nature illustrative of the appearance and habits of the\r\nnatives; and Hariot had accurately observed the soil and productions of\r\nthe country, and the manners and customs of the natives, an account of\r\nwhich he afterwards published, entitled, \"A briefe and true report of\r\nthe new found land of Virginia.\" He (Lane) and some others of the\r\ncolonists learned from the Indians the use of a narcotic plant called by\r\nthem uppowoc; by the English tobacco. The natives smoked it; sprinkled\r\nthe dust of it on their fishing weirs, to make them fortunate; burned it\r\nin sacrifices to appease the anger of the gods, and scattered it in the\r\nair and on the water to allay the fury of the tempest. Lane carried some\r\ntobacco to England, supposed by Camden to have been the first ever\r\nintroduced into that kingdom. Sir Walter Raleigh, by his example, soon\r\nrendered the use of this seductive leaf fashionable at court; and his\r\ntobacco-box and pipes were long preserved by the curiosity of\r\nantiquaries. It is related, that having offered Queen Elizabeth some\r\ntobacco to smoke, after two or three whiffs she was seized with a\r\nnausea, upon observing which some of the Earl of Leicester's faction\r\nwhispered that Sir Walter had certainly poisoned her. But her majesty in\r\na short while recovering, made the Countess of Nottingham and all her\r\nmaids smoke a whole pipe out among them. It is also said that Sir Walter\r\nmade a wager with the queen, that he could calculate the weight of the\r\nsmoke evaporated from a pipeful of tobacco. This he easily won by\r\nweighing first the tobacco, and then the ashes, when the queen\r\nacknowledged that the difference must have gone off in smoke. Upon\r\npaying the wager, she gayly remarked, that \"she had heard of many\r\nworkers in the fire who had turned their gold into smoke, but that Sir\r\nWalter was the first that had turned his smoke into gold.\" Another\r\nfamiliar anecdote is, that a country servant of Raleigh's, bringing him\r\na tankard of ale and nutmeg into his study as he was intently reading\r\nand smoking, was so alarmed at seeing clouds of smoke issuing from his\r\nmaster's mouth, that, throwing the ale into his face, he ran down stairs\r\ncrying out that Sir Walter was on fire.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh never visited Virginia himself, although it has been\r\nso represented by several writers. Hariot's \"Report of the new found\r\nland\" was translated by a Frenchman[25:A] into Latin, and this\r\ntranslation refers to those \"qui generosum D. Walterum Raleigh in eam\r\nregionem comitati sunt.\" The error of the translator in employing the\r\nwords \"comitati sunt,\" has been pointed out by Stith, and that error\r\nprobably gave rise to the mistake which has been handed down from age to\r\nage, and is still prevalent. A few days after Drake's departure, a\r\nvessel arrived at Roanoke with supplies for the colony; but finding it\r\nabandoned, she set sail for England. Within a fortnight afterwards, Sir\r\nRichard Grenville, with three relief vessels fitted out principally by\r\nRaleigh, arrived off Virginia; and, unwilling that the English should\r\nlose possession of the country, he left fifteen men on the island, with\r\nprovisions for two years. These repeated disappointments did not abate\r\nRaleigh's indomitable resolution. During the ensuing year he sent out a\r\nnew expedition of three vessels to establish a colony chartered by the\r\ntitle of \"The Governor and Assistants of the City of Raleigh in\r\nVirginia.\" John White was sent out as governor with twelve counsellors,\r\nand they were directed to plant themselves at the town of Chesapeakes,\r\non Elizabeth River. Reaching Roanoke near the end of July, White found\r\nthe colony deserted, the bones of a man scattered on the beach, the fort\r\nrazed, and deer couching in the desolate houses or feeding on the rank\r\nvegetation which had overgrown the floor and crept up the walls.\r\nRaleigh's judicious order, instructing White to establish himself on the\r\nbanks of Elizabeth River, was not carried into effect, owing to the\r\nrefusal of Ferdinando, the naval-officer, to co-operate in exploring the\r\ncountry for that purpose.\r\n\r\nOne of the English having been slain by the savages, a party was\r\ndispatched to avenge his death, and by mistake unfortunately killed\r\nseveral of a friendly tribe. Manteo, by Raleigh's direction, was\r\nchristened, and created Lord of Roanoke and Dassamonpeake. On the\r\neighteenth of August, the governor's daughter, Eleanor, wife to Ananias\r\nDare, one of the council, gave birth to a daughter, the first Christian\r\nchild born in the country, and hence named _Virginia_. Dissensions soon\r\narose among the settlers; and, although not in want of stores, some,\r\ndisappointed in not finding the new country a paradise of indolent\r\nfelicity, as they had fondly anticipated, demanded permission to return\r\nhome; others vehemently opposed; at length all joined in requesting\r\nWhite to sail for England, and to return thence with supplies. To this\r\nhe reluctantly consented; and setting sail in August, 1587, from\r\nRoanoke, where he left eighty-nine men, seventeen women, and eleven\r\nchildren, he arrived in England on the fifth of November.\r\n\r\nHe found the kingdom wholly engrossed in taking measures of defence\r\nagainst the threatened invasion of the Spanish Armada, and Raleigh,\r\nGrenville, and Lane assisting Elizabeth in her council of war--a\r\nconjuncture most unpropitious to the interests of the infant colony.\r\nRaleigh, nevertheless, found time even in this portentous crisis of\r\npublic affairs to dispatch White with supplies in two vessels. But\r\nthese, running after prizes, encountered privateers, and, after a bloody\r\nengagement, one of them was so disabled and plundered that White was\r\ncompelled to put back to England, while it was impossible to refit,\r\nowing to the urgency of more important matters. But, even after the\r\ndestruction of the Armada, Sir Walter Raleigh found it impracticable to\r\nprosecute any further his favorite design of establishing a colony in\r\nVirginia; and in 1589 he formed a company of merchants and adventurers,\r\nand assigned to it his proprietary rights. This corporation included\r\namong its members Thomas Smith, a wealthy London merchant, afterwards\r\nknighted; and Richard Hakluyt, dean of Westminster, the compiler of a\r\ncelebrated collection of voyages. He is said to have visited Virginia,\r\nand Stith gives it as his opinion that he must have come over in one of\r\nthe last-mentioned abortive expeditions. Raleigh, at the time of making\r\nthis assignment, gave a hundred pounds for propagating Christianity\r\namong the natives of Virginia. After experiencing a long series of\r\nvexations, difficulties, and disappointments, he had expended forty\r\nthousand pounds in fruitless efforts for planting a colony in Virginia.\r\nAt length, disengaged from this enterprise, he indulged his martial\r\ngenius, and bent all his energies against the colossal ambition of\r\nSpain, who now aspired to overshadow the world.\r\n\r\nMore than another year was suffered to elapse before White returned to\r\nsearch for the long-neglected colony. He had now been absent from it for\r\nthree years, and felt the solicitude not only of a governor, but also of\r\na parent. Upon his departure from Roanoke it had been concerted between\r\nhim and the settlers, that if they should abandon that island for\r\nanother seat, they should carve the name of the place to which they\r\nshould remove on some conspicuous object; and if they should go away in\r\ndistress, a cross should be carved above the name. Upon his arrival at\r\nRoanoke, White found not one of the colonists; the houses had been\r\ndismantled and a fort erected; goods had been buried in the earth, and\r\nin part disinterred and scattered; on a post within the fort the word\r\nCROATAN was carved, without a cross above it. The weather proving\r\nstormy, some of White's company were lost by the capsizing of a boat;\r\nthe stock of provisions grew scanty; and no further search was then\r\nmade. Raleigh, indeed, sent out parties in quest of them at five\r\ndifferent times, the last in 1602, at his own charge; but not one of\r\nthem made any search for the unfortunate colonists. None of them were\r\never found; and whether they perished by famine, or the Indian tomahawk,\r\nwas left a subject of sad conjecture. The site of the colony was\r\nunfortunate, being difficult of access, and near the stormy Cape\r\nHatteras, whose very name is synonymous with peril and shipwreck. Thus,\r\nafter many nobly planned but unhappily executed expeditions, and\r\nenormous expense of treasure and life, the first plantation of Virginia\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1591 Sir Richard Grenville fell, in a bloody action with a\r\nSpanish fleet near the Azores. Mortally wounded, he was removed on board\r\none of the enemy's ships, and in two days died. In the hour of his death\r\nhe said, in the Spanish language, to those around him: \"Here I, Richard\r\nGrenville, die with a joyous and quiet mind, for that I have ended my\r\nlife as a true soldier ought to do, fighting for his country, queen,\r\nreligion, and honor, my soul willingly departing from this body, leaving\r\nbehind the lasting fame of having behaved as every valiant soldier is in\r\nhis duty bound to do.\" His dying words may recall to mind the familiar\r\nverses of Campbell's Lochiel:--\r\n\r\n     \"And leaving in death no blot on my name,\r\n      Look proudly to heaven for a death-bed of fame.\"\r\n\r\nSir Richard Grenville was, next to his kinsman, Sir Walter Raleigh, the\r\nprincipal person concerned in the first settlement of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn 1602, the forty-third and last year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nCaptain Bartholomew Gosnold, deviating from the usual oblique route by\r\nthe Canaries and the West Indies, made a direct voyage in a small bark\r\nacross the Atlantic, and in seven weeks reached Massachusetts Bay. It\r\nwas on this occasion that Englishmen, for the first time, landed on the\r\nsoil of New England. Gosnold returned to England in a short passage of\r\nfive weeks. In these early voyages the heroism of the navigators is the\r\nmore admirable when we advert to the extremely diminutive size of their\r\nvessels and the comparative imperfection of nautical science at that\r\nday. Encouraged by Gosnold's success, the mayor, aldermen, and merchants\r\nof Bristol sent out an expedition under Captain Pring, in the same\r\ndirection, in 1603, the year of the accession of James I. to the throne.\r\nDuring the same year a bark was dispatched from London under Captain\r\nBartholomew Gilbert, who fell in with the coast in latitude 37°, and, as\r\nsome authors say, ran up into the Chesapeake Bay, where the captain and\r\nfour of his men were slain by the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn 1605 Captain Weymouth came over under the auspices of Henry, Earl of\r\nSouthampton, and Lord Thomas Arundel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18:A] Memoir on the first discovery of the Chesapeake Bay.

After having been some time a scholar at the free schools of\r\nAlford and Louth, when aged thirteen, his mind being bent upon bold\r\nadventures, he sold his satchel, books, and all he had, intending to go\r\nprivately to sea; but his father's death occurring just then prevented\r\nthe execution of that scheme. Having some time before lost his mother,\r\nhe was now left an orphan, with a competent hereditary estate, which,\r\nbeing too young to receive, he little regarded. At fifteen he was bound\r\napprentice to Thomas Sendall, of Lynn, the greatest merchant of all\r\nthose parts; but in a short time, disgusted with the monotony of that\r\nlife, he quit it, and accompanied a son of Lord Willoughby to France.\r\nWithin a month or six weeks, he was dismissed, his service being\r\nneedless, with an allowance of money to take him back to England; but he\r\ndetermined not to return. At Paris, meeting with a Scottish gentleman,\r\nDavid Hume, he received from him an additional supply of money and\r\nletters, which might recommend him to the favor of James the Sixth of\r\nScotland. Young Smith, proceeding to Rouen, and finding his money\r\nnearly all gone, made his way to Havre de Grace, and there began to\r\nlearn the military art, during the reign of the warlike Henry the\r\nFourth. From France the adventurer went to the Low Countries, where he\r\nserved for four years under the standard of the patriot army against\r\nSpain, in the war that eventuated in their independence. Embarking\r\nthence for Scotland, with the letters of recommendation previously given\r\nto him, and after suffering shipwreck and illness, Smith at length\r\nreached Scotland, where he was hospitably entertained \"by those honest\r\nScots at Kipweth and Broxmouth,\" but finding himself without money or\r\nmeans to make himself a courtier, he returned to his native place,\r\nWilloughby. Here he soon grew weary of much company; and indulging a\r\nromantic taste, retired into a forest, and in its recesses, near a\r\npretty brook, he built for himself a pavilion of boughs, where he\r\nstudied Machiavel's Art of War, and Marcus Aurelius, and amused his\r\nleisure by riding, throwing the lance, and hunting. His principal food\r\nwas venison, which he thus provided for himself, like Shakespeare, with\r\nbut little regard for the game-laws; and whatever else he needed was\r\nbrought to him by his servant. The country people wondered at the\r\nhermit; and his friends persuaded an Italian gentleman, rider to the\r\nEarl of Lincoln, to visit him in his retreat; and thus he was induced to\r\nreturn to the world, and after spending a short time with this new\r\nacquaintance at Tattersall's, Smith now repaired a second time to the\r\nLow Countries. Having made himself sufficiently master of horsemanship,\r\nand the use of arms and the rudiments of war, he resolved to go and try\r\nhis fortunes against the Turks, having long witnessed with pain the\r\nspectacle of so many Christians engaged in slaughtering one another.\r\n\r\nProceeding to St. Valery, in France, by collusion between the master of\r\nthe vessel and some French gallants, his trunks were plundered there in\r\nthe night, and he was forced to sell his cloak to pay for his passage.\r\nThe other passengers expressed their indignation against this villany,\r\nand one of them, a French soldier, generously supplied his immediate\r\nnecessities, and invited Smith to accompany him to his home in Normandy.\r\nHere he was kindly welcomed by his companion and the Prior of the\r\nancient abbey of St. Stephen, (where repose the remains of William the\r\nConqueror,) and others; and the story of his misfortunes reaching the\r\nears of some noble lords and ladies, they replenished his purse; and he\r\nmight have enjoyed their hospitality as long as he pleased, but this\r\nsuited not his restless, energetic and independent spirit. Wandering now\r\nfrom port to port in quest of a man-of-war, he experienced some\r\nextraordinary turns of fortune. Passing one day through a forest, his\r\nmoney being spent, worn out with distress of mind, and cold, he threw\r\nhimself on the ground, at the side of a fountain of water, under a tree,\r\nscarce hoping ever to rise again. A farmer finding him in this\r\ncondition, relieved his necessities, and enabled him to pursue his\r\njourney. Not long afterwards, meeting in a grove one of the gallants who\r\nhad robbed him, without a word on either side, they drew their swords,\r\nand fought in view of the inmates of a neighboring antique ruinous\r\ntower. In a short while the Frenchman fell, and, making confessions and\r\nexcuses, Smith, although himself wounded, spared his life. Directing his\r\ncourse now to the residence of \"the Earl of Ployer,\" with whom he had\r\nbecome acquainted while in the French service, he was by him better\r\nrefurnished than ever.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting many parts of France and Navarre, he came to Marseilles,\r\nwhere he embarked for Italy, in a vessel carrying a motley crowd of\r\npilgrims of divers nations, bound for Rome. The winds proving\r\nunfavorable, the vessel was obliged to put in at Toulon, and sailing\r\nthence the weather grew so stormy that they anchored close to the Isle\r\nof St. Mary, opposite Nice, in Savoy. Here the unfeeling provincials and\r\nsuperstitious pilgrims showered imprecations on Smith's head,\r\nstigmatizing him as a Huguenot, and his nation as all pirates, and Queen\r\nElizabeth as a heretic; and, protesting that they should never have fair\r\nweather as long as _he_ was on board, they cast him into the sea to\r\npropitiate heaven. However, he swam to the Islet of St. Mary, which he\r\nfound inhabited by a few cattle and goats. On the next day he was taken\r\nup by a privateering French ship, the captain of which, named La Roche,\r\nproving to be a neighbor and friend of the Earl of Ployer, entertained\r\nhim kindly. With him, Smith visited Alexandria in Egypt, Scanderoon, the\r\nArchipelago, and coast of Greece. At the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, a\r\nVenetian argosy, richly laden, was captured and plundered, after a\r\ndesperate action, in which Smith appears to have participated. He landed\r\nin Piedmont with five hundred sequins and a box of jewels, worth about\r\nas much more--his share of the prize. Embarking for Leghorn, he\r\ntravelled in Italy, and here met with his friends, Lord Willoughby and\r\nhis brother, both severely wounded in a recent bloody fray. Going to\r\nRome, Smith surveyed the wonders of the Imperial City, and saw the Pope,\r\nwith the cardinals, ascend the holy staircase, and say mass in the\r\nChurch of St. John de Lateran. Leaving Rome, he made the tour of Italy,\r\nand embarking at Venice, crossed over to the wild regions of Albania and\r\nDalmatia. Passing through sterile Sclavonia, he found his way to Gratz,\r\nin Styria, the residence of the Archduke Ferdinand, afterwards Emperor\r\nof Germany. Here he met with an Englishman and an Irish Jesuit, by whose\r\nassistance he was enabled to join a regiment of artillery, commanded by\r\nCount Meldritch, whom he accompanied to Vienna, and thence to the seat\r\nof war. At this time, 1601, there was a bloody war going on between\r\nGermany and the Turks, and the latter had gained many signal advantages,\r\nand the Crescent, flushed with victory, was rapidly encroaching upon the\r\nconfines of Christendom. Canissia having just fallen, it was at the\r\nsiege of Olympach, beleaguered by the Turks, that Smith first had an\r\nopportunity of displaying the resources of his military genius, for\r\nwhich he was put in command of two hundred and fifty horse.\r\n\r\nThat siege being raised, after some interval of suspended hostilities,\r\nthe Christian forces, in their turn, besieged Stowle Wessenburg, which\r\nsoon fell into their hands. Mahomet the Third, hearing of this disaster,\r\ndispatched a formidable army to retrieve or avenge it; and in the bloody\r\nbattle that ensued on the plains of Girke, Smith had a horse shot under\r\nhim, and was badly wounded. At the siege of Regal he encountered and\r\nslew, in a tournament, three several Turkish champions, Turbashaw,\r\nGrualgo, and Bonny Mulgro. For these exploits he was honored with a\r\ntriumphal procession, in which the three Turks' heads were borne on\r\nlances. A horse richly caparisoned was presented to him, with a cimeter\r\nand belt worth three hundred ducats; and he was promoted to the rank of\r\nmajor.\r\n\r\nIn the bloody battle of Rottenton, he was wounded and made prisoner.\r\nWith such of the prisoners as escaped massacre, he was sold into slavery\r\nat Axiopolis, and fell into the hands of the Bashaw Bogall, who sent\r\nhim, by way of Adrianople, to Constantinople, a present to his youthful\r\nmistress, Charatza Tragabigzanda. Captivated with her prisoner, she\r\ntreated him tenderly; and to prevent his being sold again, sent him to\r\nremain for a time with her brother, the Tymour Bashaw of Nalbritz, in\r\nTartary, who occupied a stone castle near the Sea of Azof. Immediately\r\non Smith's arrival, his head was shaved, an iron collar riveted on his\r\nneck, and he was clothed in hair-cloth. Here long he suffered cruel\r\nbondage; at length one day, while threshing in a barn, the Bashaw having\r\nbeaten and reviled him, he turned and slew him on the spot, with the\r\nthreshing bat; then put on his clothes, hid his body in the straw,\r\nfilled a sack with corn, closed the doors, mounted the Bashaw's horse,\r\nand rode off. After wandering for some days, he fell in with a highway,\r\nand observing that the roads leading toward Russia were indicated by a\r\ncross, he followed that sign, and in sixteen days reached Ecopolis, a\r\nRussian frontier post on the Don. The governor there took off his irons,\r\nand he was kindly treated by him and his wife, the lady Callamata.\r\nTraversing Russia and Poland, he returned to Transylvania in December,\r\n1603, where he met many friends, and enjoyed so much happiness that\r\nnothing less than his desire to revisit his native country could have\r\ntorn him away.\r\n\r\nProceeding through Hungary, Moravia, and Bohemia, he went to Leipsic,\r\nwhere he found Prince Sigismund, who gave him fifteen hundred golden\r\nducats to repair his losses. Travelling through Germany, France, and\r\nSpain, from Gibraltar he sailed for Tangier, in Africa, and to the City\r\nof Morocco. Taking passage in a French man-of-war, he was present in a\r\nterrible sea-fight with two Spanish ships; and after touching at Santa\r\nCruz, Cape Goa, and Mogadore, he finally returned to England in\r\n1604.[34:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34:A] \"The True Travels, Adventures, and Observations of Captain John\r\nSmith,\" in his History of Virginia.

Gosnold, who had already, in\r\n1602, made a voyage to the northern parts of Virginia, afterwards called\r\nNew England, for many years fruitlessly labored to set on foot an\r\nexpedition for effecting an actual settlement. At length he was\r\nreinforced in his efforts by Captain Smith; Edward Maria Wingfield, a\r\nmerchant; Robert Hunt, a clergyman, and others; and by their united\r\nexertions certain of the nobility, gentry, and merchants, became\r\ninterested in the project, and King James the First, who, as has been\r\nbefore mentioned, had, in 1603, succeeded Elizabeth, was induced to lend\r\nit his countenance. April 10th, 1606, letters patent were issued,\r\nauthorizing the establishment of two colonies in Virginia and other\r\nparts of America. All the country from 34° to 45° of north latitude,\r\nthen known as Virginia, was divided into two colonies, the First or\r\nSouthern, and the Second or Northern.\r\n\r\nThe plantation of the Southern colony was intrusted to Sir Thomas Gates\r\nand Sir George Somers, knights; Richard Hackluyt, clerk, prebendary of\r\nWestminster; Edward Maria Wingfield, and others, mostly resident in\r\nLondon. This company was authorized to plant a colony wherever they\r\nmight choose between 34° and 41° of north latitude; and the king vested\r\nin them a right of property in the land extending along the sea-coast\r\nfifty statute miles on each side of the place of their first plantation,\r\nand reaching into the interior one hundred miles from the sea-coast,\r\ntogether with all islands within one hundred miles of their shores. The\r\nSecond, or Northern colony of Virginia, was in like manner intrusted to\r\nThomas Hanham, and others, mostly residents of Bristol, Exeter, and\r\nPlymouth. These were authorized to plant a colony wherever they might\r\nchoose between 38° and 45° of north latitude, and he gave to them a\r\nterritory of similar limits and extent to that given to the first\r\ncolony. He provided, however, that the plantation of whichever of the\r\nsaid two colonies should be last effected, should not be within one\r\nhundred miles of the other that might be first established. The company\r\nof the Southern colony came to be distinguished as the London company,\r\nand the other as the Plymouth company. But eventually these names were\r\ndropped; and the name of Virginia, which had been at first common to the\r\ntwo colonies, was appropriated to the Southern colony only; while the\r\nNorthern colony was now called New England.[36:A]\r\n\r\nIn the charter granted to Sir Thomas Gates and his associates, it was\r\nprovided that the colony should have a council of its own, subject to a\r\nsuperior council in England. The subordinate council was authorized to\r\nsearch for and dig mines, coin money, carry over adventurers, and repel\r\nintruders. The president and council were authorized to levy duties on\r\nforeign commodities; the colonists were invested with all the rights and\r\nprivileges of English subjects, and the lands granted to settlers in\r\nfree and common soccage.[36:B]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November, 1606, instructions were given by the crown for\r\nthe government of the two colonies, directing that the council in\r\nEngland should be appointed by the crown; the local council by the\r\nsuperior one in England; the local one to choose a president annually\r\nfrom its own body; the Christian religion to be preached; lands to\r\ndescend as in England; trial by jury secured in criminal causes; and the\r\ncouncil empowered to determine all civil actions; all produce and goods\r\nimported to be stored in magazines; a clerk and treasurer, or\r\ncape-merchant, to be appointed for the colony. The stockholders, styled\r\nadventurers, were authorized to organize a company for the management of\r\nthe business of the colony, and to superintend the proceedings of the\r\nlocal council. The colonists were enjoined to treat the natives kindly,\r\nand to endeavor by all means to convert them to Christianity.[37:A] Sir\r\nThomas Smith was appointed treasurer of the company, and the chief\r\nmanagement of their affairs intrusted to him. He was an eminent London\r\nmerchant; had been chief of Sir Walter Raleigh's assignees; was about\r\nthis time governor of the East India Company, and had been ambassador to\r\nRussia.[37:B]\r\n\r\nThe frame of government thus provided for the new colony was cumbrous\r\nand complicated, the legislative and administrative powers being so\r\ndistributed between the local council, the crown, and the company, as to\r\ninvolve the danger of delays, uncertainty, conflict, and\r\nirresponsibility. By the words of the charter the colonists were\r\ninvested with the rights of Englishmen; yet, as far as political rights\r\nwere concerned, there being no security provided by which they could be\r\nvindicated, they might often prove to be of no more real value than the\r\nparchment on which they were written. However, the government of such an\r\ninfant colony must, of necessity, have been for the most part arbitrary;\r\nthe political rights of the colonists must, for a time, have lain in\r\nabeyance. Their civil rights were protected in criminal causes by the\r\ntrial by jury, and lands were to be held by a free tenure.\r\n\r\nAt length three vessels were fitted out for the expedition, one of\r\ntwenty tons, one of forty, the third of one hundred tons, and they were\r\nput under the command of Captain Christopher Newport, a navigator\r\nexperienced in voyages to the New World. Orders being put on board\r\ninclosed in a sealed box, not to be opened until their arrival in\r\nVirginia, they set sail from Blackwall on the 19th of December, 1606.\r\nFor six weeks they were detained by headwinds and stormy weather in the\r\nDowns, within view of the English coast, and during this interval,\r\ndisorder, threatening a mutiny, prevailed among the adventurers.\r\nHowever, it was suppressed by the interposition of the clergyman, Robert\r\nHunt. The winds at length proving favorable, the little fleet proceeded\r\nalong the old route by the Canaries, which they reached about the\r\ntwenty-first of April, and on the twenty-sixth sailed for the West\r\nIndies, upon arriving at which it appears that Captain Smith was\r\nactually in command of the expedition, for,[38:A] writing afterwards in\r\n1629, he says: \"Because I have ranged and lived among those islands,\r\nwhat my authors cannot tell me, I think it no great error in helping\r\nthem to tell it myself. In this little Isle of Mevis, more than twenty\r\nyears ago, I have remained a good time together, to wood and water, and\r\nrefresh _my men_.\" This isle was, on this occasion, the scene of a\r\nremarkable incident in his life, and one which appears to have escaped\r\nthe notice of our historians. \"Such factions here we had as commonly\r\nattend such voyages, that a pair of gallows was made; but Captain Smith,\r\nfor whom they were intended, could not be persuaded to use them. But not\r\nany of the inventors but their lives by justice fell into his power to\r\ndetermine of at his pleasure, whom, with much mercy, he favored, that\r\nmost basely and unjustly would have betrayed him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter passing three weeks in the West Indies they sailed in quest of\r\nRoanoke Island, and having exceeded their reckoning three days without\r\nfinding land, the crew grew impatient, and Ratcliffe, captain of the\r\npinnace, proposed to steer back for England.\r\n\r\nAt this conjuncture a violent storm, compelling them to scud all night\r\nunder bare poles, providentially drove them into the mouth of Chesapeake\r\nBay. The first land that they came in sight of, April 26th, 1607, they\r\ncalled Cape Henry, in honor of the Prince of Wales, eldest son of King\r\nJames, as the opposite point, Cape Charles, was named after the king's\r\nsecond son, then Duke of York, afterwards Charles the First. A party of\r\ntwenty or thirty, with Newport, landing here, found a variety of pretty\r\nflowers and goodly trees. While recreating themselves on the shore they\r\nwere attacked by five of the savages, who came creeping upon all-fours\r\nfrom the hills like bears, and with their arrows wounded two, but\r\nretired at the discharge of muskets.[39:A]\r\n\r\nThat night the sealed box was opened, when it appeared that the members\r\nof council appointed were--Bartholomew Gosnold, John Smith, Edward Maria\r\nWingfield, Christopher Newport, John Ratcliffe, John Martin and George\r\nKendall. They were instructed to elect, out of their own number, a\r\npresident for one year; he and the council together were invested with\r\nthe government; affairs of moment were to be examined by a jury, but\r\ndetermined by the council.\r\n\r\nSeventeen days were spent in quest of a place for the settlement. A\r\npoint on the western side of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay they named\r\nPoint Comfort, because they found a good harbor there, which, after the\r\nrecent storm, put them in good comfort. Landing there, April 30th, they\r\nsaw five Indians, who were at first alarmed; but seeing the captain lay\r\nhis hand upon his heart, they came boldly up and invited the strangers\r\nto Kecoughtan, now Hampton, their town, where they were entertained with\r\ncorn-bread, tobacco and pipes, and a dance. May 4th, the explorers were\r\nkindly received by the Paspaheghs. The chief of a neighboring tribe sent\r\na guide to conduct the English strangers to his habitation. Percy calls\r\nthem the Rappahannas; but as no such tribe is mentioned by Smith as\r\nbeing near the James River, they were probably the Quiqoughcohanocks,\r\nwho dwelled on the north side of the river, about ten miles above\r\nJamestown.[39:B] Upon the arrival of the English this chief stood on the\r\nbank of the river to meet them, when they landed, \"with all his train,\"\r\nsays Percy, \"as goodly men as any I have seen of savages, or Christians,\r\nthe Werowance [chief] coming before them, playing on a flute made of a\r\nreed, with a crown of deer's hair, colored red, in fashion of a rose,\r\nfastened about his knot of hair, and a great plate of copper on the\r\nother side of his head, with two long feathers, in fashion of a pair of\r\nhorns, placed in the midst of his crown. His body was painted all with\r\ncrimson, with a chain of beads about his neck; his face painted blue,\r\nbesprinkled with silver ore, as we thought; his ears all behung with\r\nbracelets of pearl, and in either ear a bird's claw through it, beset\r\nwith fine copper or gold. He entertained us in so modest a proud\r\nfashion, as though he had been a prince of civil government, holding his\r\ncountenance without laughter, or any such ill behavior. He caused his\r\nmat to be spread on the ground, where he sate down with a great majesty,\r\ntaking a pipe of tobacco, the rest of his company standing about him.\r\nAfter he had rested awhile he rose, and made signs to us to come to his\r\ntown: he went foremost, and all the rest of his people and ourselves\r\nfollowed him up a steep hill, where his palace was settled. We passed\r\nthrough the woods in fine paths having most pleasant springs, which\r\nissued from the mountains [hills.] We also went through the goodliest\r\ncorn-fields that ever were seen in any country. When we came to\r\nRappohanna town, he entertained us in good humanity.\" While this\r\nhospitable, unsophisticated chief was piping a welcome to the English\r\nstrangers, how little did he anticipate the tragic scenes of war and\r\nblood which were so soon to ensue!\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May the English went farther up the river to the country\r\nof the Appomattocks, who came forth to meet them in a most warlike\r\nmanner, with bows and arrows, and formidable war-clubs; but the whites,\r\nmaking signs of peace, were suffered to land unmolested.[40:A] At length\r\nthey selected for the site of the colony a peninsula lying on the north\r\nside of the James River, and about forty miles from its mouth. The\r\nwestern end of this peninsula, where it is connected by a little isthmus\r\nwith the main land, was the spot pitched upon for the erection of a\r\ntown, which was named, in honor of the king, Jamestown. Some contention\r\noccurred between Wingfield and Gosnold in regard to the selection of\r\nthis place, Gosnold objecting to it. Smith conceived it a fit place for\r\na great city. Gosnold exhibited in this matter the better judgment. The\r\nsituation, eligible in some points, was extremely unhealthy, being low\r\nand exposed to the malaria of extensive marshes covered with water at\r\nhigh-tide. The bank of the river there is marked by no striking or\r\npicturesque feature. According to the terms of the charter, the\r\nterritory now appropriated to the colony comprised a square of a base of\r\none hundred miles, and including an area of ten thousand square miles,\r\nof which Jamestown was the centre, so to speak.\r\n\r\nThe settlers landed at Jamestown on the 13th day of May, 1607. This was\r\nthe first permanent settlement effected by the English in North America,\r\nafter the lapse of one hundred and ten years from the discovery of the\r\ncontinent by the Cabots, and twenty-two years after the first attempt to\r\ncolonize it, made under the auspices of Walter Raleigh. Upon landing,\r\nthe council took the oath of office; Edward Maria Wingfield was elected\r\npresident, and Thomas Studley, cape-merchant or treasurer of the\r\ncolony.[41:A] Smith was excluded from the council upon some false\r\npretences. Dean Swift says: \"When a great genius appears in the world,\r\nthe dunces are all in confederacy against him.\"\r\n\r\nAll hands now fell to work, the council planning a fort, the rest\r\nclearing ground for pitching tents, preparing clapboard for freighting\r\nthe vessels, laying off gardens, and making fishing-nets. The Indians\r\nfrequently visited them in a friendly way. The president's overweening\r\njealousy would allow no military exercise or fortification, save the\r\nboughs of trees thrown together in a semicircle by the energy of Captain\r\nKendall.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of June, Newport, Smith, and twenty others were dispatched\r\nto discover the head of the river on which they were seated, called by\r\nthe Indians, Powhatan, and by the English, the James. The natives\r\neverywhere received them kindly, dancing, and feasting them with bread,\r\nfish, strawberries, and mulberries, for which Newport requited them with\r\nbells, pins, needles, and looking-glasses, which so pleased them that\r\nthey followed the strangers from place to place. In six days they\r\nreached a town called Powhatan, one of the seats of the great chief of\r\nthat name, whom they found there. It consisted of twelve wigwams,\r\npleasantly situated on a bold range of hills overlooking the river, with\r\nthree islets in front, and many corn-fields around. This picturesque\r\nspot lies on the north bank of the river, about a mile below the falls,\r\nand still retains the same name.\r\n\r\nOn the day of their arrival, the tenth of June, the party visited the\r\nfalls, and again on the day following, Whitsunday, when they erected a\r\ncross there to indicate the farthest point of discovery. Newport, in\r\nreturn for Powhatan's hospitality, presented him with a gown and a\r\nhatchet. Upon their return, the Indians first gave occasion for distrust\r\nat Weyanoke, within twenty miles of Jamestown. Arriving there on the\r\nnext day, June the twentieth, they found that a boy had been killed, and\r\nseventeen men, including the greater part of the council, had been\r\nwounded by the savages; that during the assault a cross-bar shot from\r\none of the vessels had struck down a bough of a tree among them and made\r\nthem retire, but for which all the settlers there would probably have\r\nbeen massacred, as they were at the time of the attack planting corn in\r\nsecurity, and without arms. Wingfield now consented that the fort should\r\nbe palisaded, cannon mounted, and the men armed and exercised. The\r\nattacks and ambuscades of the natives were frequent, and the English, by\r\ntheir careless straggling, were often wounded, while the fleet-footed\r\nsavages easily escaped.\r\n\r\nThus the colonists endured continual hardships, guarding the workmen by\r\nday and keeping watch by night. Six weeks being passed in this way,\r\nNewport was now about to return to England. Ever since their departure\r\nfrom the Canaries, save for a while in the West Indies, Smith had been\r\nin a sort of duress upon the false and scandalous charges of some of the\r\nprincipal men in the expedition, who, envying his superiority, gave out\r\nthat he intended to usurp the command, murder the council, and make\r\nhimself king; that his confederates were distributed in the three\r\nvessels; and that divers of them, who had revealed it, would confirm it.\r\nUpon these accusations Smith had been arrested, and had now lain for\r\nseveral months under the cloud of these suspicions. Upon the eve of\r\nNewport's departure, Smith's accusers affecting through pity to refer\r\nhis case to the council in England, rather than overwhelm him on the\r\nspot by an exposure of his criminal designs, he defied their malice,\r\ndefeated their base machinations, and so bore himself throughout the\r\nwhole affair, that all saw his innocence and the malignity of his\r\nenemies. The very witnesses suborned to accuse him charged his enemies\r\nwith subornation of perjury. Kendall, the ringleader of them, was\r\nadjudged to pay him two hundred pounds in damages, which Smith\r\ncontributed to the common stock of the colony. During these disputes\r\nHunt, the chaplain, used his exertions to reconcile the parties, and at\r\nhis instance Smith was admitted into the council on the twentieth day of\r\nJune, and on the next day they all received the communion. The Indians\r\nnow sued for peace, and two days after Newport weighed anchor, leaving\r\nat Jamestown one hundred settlers, with provisions sufficient, as was\r\nsupposed, for more than three months.[43:A]\r\n\r\nNot long after his departure a fatal sickness began to prevail at\r\nJamestown, engendered by the insalubrity of the place, the exposure of\r\nthe settlers, and the scarcity and bad quality of their food. Hitherto\r\nthey had procured provisions from the vessels, but now, for some time,\r\nthe daily allowance of each man was a pint of damaged wheat or barley.\r\n\"Our drink was water, and our lodgings castles in the air.\" By September\r\nfifty of them, being one-half of the colony, died; the rest made out to\r\nsubsist upon sturgeon and crabs. Among the victims of disease was\r\nBartholomew Gosnold, the projector of the expedition, whose name is well\r\nworthy to be ranked with Smith and Raleigh. The sick, during this\r\ncalamitous season, received the faithful attentions of Thomas Wotton,\r\nsurgeon-general.\r\n\r\nWingfield, the president, after engrossing, as it was alleged, the\r\npublic store of provisions to his own use, attempted to escape from the\r\ncolony in the pinnace, and return to England. This baseness roused the\r\nindignation even of the emaciated survivors, and they deposed him, and\r\nappointed Captain John Ratcliffe in his place, and displaced Kendall, a\r\nconfederate of Wingfield, from the council.\r\n\r\nIn a manuscript journal of these early incidents, written by Wingfield\r\nhimself, and preserved in the Lambeth Library, he undertakes to\r\nexculpate himself from the charge of engrossing the common store in the\r\nfollowing terms: \"As I understand, by report, I am much charged with\r\nstarving the colony; I did always give every man his allowance\r\nfaithfully, both of corn, oil, aquavitæ, etc., as was by the council\r\nproportioned; neither was it bettered after my time, until toward the\r\nend of March a biscuit was allowed to every workingman for his\r\nbreakfast, by means of the provision brought us by Captain Newport, as\r\nwill appear hereafter. It is further said I did much banquet and riot; I\r\nnever had but one squirrel roasted, whereof I gave a part to Mr.\r\nRatcliffe, then sick; yet was that squirrel given me. I did never heat a\r\nflesh-pot but when the common-pot was so used likewise; yet how often\r\nMr. Presidents and the councillors have, night and day, been endangered\r\nto break their backs, so laden with swans, geese, ducks, etc. How many\r\ntimes their flesh-pots have swelled, many hungry eyes did behold, to\r\ntheir great longing; and what great thieves and thieving there hath been\r\nin common store since my time, I doubt not but is already made known to\r\nhis majesty's council for Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nAt length their stores were almost exhausted, the small quantity of wine\r\nremaining being reserved for the communion-table; the sturgeon gone, all\r\nfurther effort abandoned in despair, and an attack from the savages each\r\nmoment expected. At this hopeless conjuncture, a benignant Providence\r\nput it into the hearts of the Indians to supply the famished sufferers\r\nwith an abundance of fruits and provision. Mankind, in trying scenes,\r\nrender an involuntary homage to superior genius. Ratcliffe, the new\r\npresident, and Martin, finding themselves incompetent and unpopular,\r\nintrusted the helm of affairs to Smith, who, acting as cape-merchant,\r\nset the colonists to work, some to mow, others to build houses and\r\nthatch them, he himself always performing the heaviest task. In a short\r\ntime habitations were provided for the greater part of the survivors,\r\nand a church was built. Smith next embarked in a shallop to go in quest\r\nof supplies. Ignorance of the Indian language, the want of sails for\r\nthe boat, and of clothing for the men and their small force, were\r\ndiscouraging impediments, but they did not dishearten him. With a crew\r\nof six or seven he went down the river to Kecoughtan, a town of eighteen\r\ncabins. Here he replied to a scornful defiance, by a volley of musketry\r\nand capturing their okee--an idol stuffed with moss, and painted and\r\nadorned with copper chains--so terrified them, that they quickly brought\r\nhim a supply of venison, wild-fowl, and bread. Having procured a supply\r\nof corn, on his return he discovered the town and county of\r\nWarrasqueake, where he procured a further supply. After this, in several\r\njourneys, he explored the borders of the Chickahominy River. During his\r\nabsence, Wingfield and Kendall, leaguing with the sailors and others,\r\nseized the pinnace in order to escape to England; but Smith, returning\r\nunexpectedly, opened so hot a fire upon them as compelled them to stay\r\nor sink. For this offence Kendall was tried by a jury, convicted, and\r\nshot.[45:A] Not long after, Ratcliffe and Captain Gabriel Archer made a\r\nsimilar attempt, and it was foiled by Smith's vigilance and resolution.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of winter the rivers of Virginia abounded with\r\nwild-fowl, and the English now were well supplied with bread, peas,\r\npersimmons, fish, and game. But this plenty did not last long; for what\r\nSmith carefully provided the colonists carelessly wasted. The idlers at\r\nJamestown, including some of the council, now began to mutter complaints\r\nagainst Smith for not having discovered the source of the Chickahominy,\r\nit being supposed that the South Sea or Pacific Ocean lay not far\r\ndistant, and that a communication with it would be found by some river\r\nrunning from the northwest. The Chickahominy flowed in that direction,\r\nand hence the solicitude of these Jamestown cosmographers to trace that\r\nriver to its head. To allay this dissatisfaction of the council, Smith\r\nmade another voyage up that river, and proceeded until it became\r\nnecessary, in order to pass, to cut away a large tree which had fallen\r\nacross the stream. When at last the barge could advance no farther, he\r\nreturned eight miles and moored her in a wide bay out of danger, and\r\nleaving orders to his men not to venture on shore until his return,\r\naccompanied by two of his men and two Indian guides, and leaving seven\r\nmen in the barge, he went still higher up in a canoe to the distance of\r\ntwenty miles. In a short time after he had parted from the barge the men\r\nleft in her went ashore, and one of them, George Cassen, was surprised\r\nand killed. Smith, in the mean while, not suspecting this disaster,\r\nreached the marshy ground toward the head of the river, \"the slashes,\"\r\nand went out with his gun to provide food for the party, and took with\r\nhim one of the Indians. During his excursion his two men, Robinson and\r\nEmry, were slain; and he himself was attacked by a numerous party of\r\nIndians, two of whom he killed with a pistol. He protected himself from\r\ntheir arrows by making a shield of his guide, binding him fast by the\r\narm with one of his garters. Many arrows pierced his clothes, and some\r\nslightly wounded him. Endeavoring to reach the canoe, and walking\r\nbackward with his eye still fixed on his pursuers, he sunk to his waist\r\nin an oozy creek, and his savage with him. Nevertheless the Indians were\r\nafraid to approach, until, being now half-dead with cold, he threw away\r\nhis arms, when they drew him forth, and led him to the fire where his\r\ntwo companions were lying dead. Here the Indians chafed his benumbed\r\nlimbs, and having restored the vital heat, Smith inquired for their\r\nchief, and they pointed him to Opechancanough, the great chief of\r\nPamunkey. Smith presented him a mariner's compass; the vibrations of the\r\nmysterious needle astonished the untutored sons of the forest. In a\r\nshort time they bound the prisoner to a tree, and were about to shoot\r\nhim to death, when Opechancanough holding up the compass, they all laid\r\ndown their bows and arrows. Then marching in Indian file they led the\r\ncaptive guarded, by fifteen men, about six miles, to Orapakes, a hunting\r\ntown in the upper part of the Chickahominy swamp, and about twelve miles\r\nnortheast from the falls of James River (Richmond.) At this town,\r\nconsisting of thirty or forty houses, built like arbors and covered with\r\nmats, the women and children came forth to meet them, staring in\r\namazement at Smith. Opechancanough and his followers performed their\r\nmilitary exercises, and joined in the war-dance. Smith was confined in a\r\nlong house under a guard, and an enormous quantity of bread and venison\r\nwas set before him, as if to fatten him for sacrifice, or because they\r\nsupposed that a superior being required a proportionately larger supply\r\nof food. An Indian who had received some toys from Smith at Jamestown,\r\nnow, in return, brought him a warm garment of fur--a pleasing instance\r\nof gratitude, a sentiment often found even in the breast of a savage.\r\nAnother Indian, whose son had been mortally wounded by Smith, made an\r\nattempt to kill him in revenge, and was only prevented by the\r\ninterposition of his guards.\r\n\r\nOpechancanough meditating an assault upon Jamestown, undertook to entice\r\nSmith to join him by offers of life, liberty, land, and women. Being\r\nallowed to send a message to Jamestown, he wrote a note on a leaf of a\r\nbook, giving information of the intended assault, and directing what\r\nmeans should be employed to strike terror into the messengers, and what\r\npresents should be sent back by them. Three men dispatched with the note\r\nreturned with an answer and the presents, in three days, notwithstanding\r\nthe rigor of the season; it being the midst of the winter of 1607,\r\nremarkable for its extraordinary severity, and the ground being covered\r\nwith snow. Opechancanough and his people looked upon their captive as\r\nsome supernatural being, and were filled with new wonder on seeing how\r\nthe \"paper could speak.\" Abandoning the design of attacking Jamestown,\r\nthey conducted Smith through the country of the Youghtanunds,\r\nMattapanients, Payanketanks, Nantaughtacunds, and Onawmanients, on the\r\nbanks of the Rappahannock, and Potomac. Thence he was taken to\r\nPamaunkee, at the junction of the Matapony and Pamunkey--the residence\r\nof Opechancanough. Here, for three days, they engaged in their horrid\r\norgies and incantations, with a view to divine their prisoner's secret\r\ndesigns whether friendly or hostile. They also showed him a bag of\r\ngunpowder, which they were reserving till the next spring, when they\r\nintended to sow it in the ground, as they were desirous of propagating\r\nso useful an article.\r\n\r\nSmith was hospitably entertained by Opitchapan, (Opechancanough's\r\nbrother,) who dwelt a little above, on the Pamunkey. Finally, the\r\ncaptive was taken to Werowocomoco, probably signifying chief place of\r\ncouncil, a favorite seat of Powhatan, on the York River, then called the\r\nPamaunkee or Pamunkey. They found this chief in his rude palace,\r\nreclining before the fire, on a sort of throne, resembling a bedstead,\r\ncovered with mats, his head adorned with feathers and his neck with\r\nbeads, and wearing a long robe of raccoon skins. At his head sate a\r\nyoung female, and another at his feet; while, on each side of the\r\nwigwam, sate the men in rows, on mats; and behind them as many young\r\nwomen, their heads and shoulders painted red, some with their heads\r\ndecorated with the snowy down of birds, and all with strings of white\r\nbeads falling over their shoulders. On Smith's entrance they all raised\r\na terrific yell; the queen of Appomattock brought him water to wash, and\r\nanother, a bunch of feathers for a towel. After feasting him, a long\r\nconsultation was held. That ended, two large stones were brought, and\r\nthe one laid upon the other, before Powhatan; then as many as could lay\r\nhold, seizing Smith, dragged him to the stones, and laying his head on\r\nthem, snatched up their war-clubs, and, brandishing them in the air,\r\nwere about to slay him, when Pocahontas, Powhatan's favorite daughter, a\r\ngirl of only twelve or thirteen years of age,[48:A] finding all her\r\nentreaties unavailing, flew, and, at the hazard of her life, clasped the\r\ncaptive's head in her arms, and laid her own upon his. The stern heart\r\nof Powhatan was touched--he relented, and consented that Smith might\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nWerowocomoco, the scene of this celebrated rescue, lies on the north\r\nside of York River, in the County of Gloucester, about twenty-five miles\r\nbelow the fork of the river, and on a bay into which three creeks\r\nempty.[48:B] This is Timber-neck Bay, on the east bank of which stands a\r\nremarkable old stone chimney, traditionally known as \"Powhatan's\r\nchimney,\" and its site corresponds exactly with the royal house of that\r\nchief, as laid down on Smith's Map of Virginia. Werowocomoco is only a\r\nfew miles distant from the historic field of Yorktown, which is lower\r\ndown the river, and on the opposite side. The lapse of time will\r\ncontinually heighten the interesting associations of Werowocomoco, and\r\nin ages of the distant future the pensive traveller will linger at the\r\nspot graced with the lovely charms of nature, and endeared by\r\nrecollections of the tender heroism of Pocahontas.\r\n\r\nWithin two days after Smith's rescue, Powhatan suffered him to return to\r\nJamestown, on condition of sending him two great guns and a grindstone,\r\nfor which he promised to give him the country of Capahowosick, and\r\nforever esteem him as his own favorite son Nantaquoud. Smith,\r\naccompanied by Indian guides, quartered at night in some old hunting\r\ncabins of Paspahegh, and reached Jamestown on the next morning about\r\nsunrise. During the journey, as ever since his capture, he had expected\r\nat almost every moment to be put to death. Returning, after an absence\r\nof seven weeks, he was joyfully welcomed back by all except Archer and\r\ntwo or three of his confederates. Archer, who had been illegally\r\nadmitted into the council, had the insolent audacity to indict Smith,\r\nupon a chapter of Leviticus, for the death of his two men slain by the\r\nIndians on the Chickahominy. He was tried on the day of his return, and\r\nsentenced to be hanged on the next day, or the day after the next, when\r\nNewport's opportune arrival on the very night after Smith's return,\r\nprovidentially saved him from this ignominious fate. Wingfield\r\nattributes the saving of _his_ life likewise to Newport, who released\r\nhim from the pinnace, where he was in duress.[49:A]\r\n\r\nSmith now treated his Indian guides kindly, and showing Rawhunt, a\r\nfavorite servant of Powhatan, two pieces of cannon and a grindstone,\r\ngave him leave to carry them home to his master. A cannon was then\r\nloaded with stones, and discharged among the boughs of a tree hung with\r\nicicles, when the Indians fled in terror, but upon being persuaded to\r\nreturn, they received presents for Powhatan, his wives and children, and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Smith's return to Jamestown, he found the number of the\r\ncolonists reduced to forty. Of the one hundred original settlers,[49:B]\r\nseventy-eight are classified as follows: fifty-four gentlemen, four\r\ncarpenters, twelve laborers, a blacksmith, a sailor, a barber, a\r\nbricklayer, a mason, a tailor, a drummer, and a \"chirurgeon.\" Of the\r\ngentlemen, the greater part were indolent, dissolute reprobates, of good\r\nfamilies; and they found themselves not in a golden El Dorado, as they\r\nhad fondly anticipated, but in a remote wilderness, encompassed by want,\r\nexposure, fatigue, disease, and danger.\r\n\r\nThe return of Smith, and his report of the plenty that he had witnessed\r\nat Werowocomoco, and of the generous clemency of Powhatan, and\r\nespecially of the love of Pocahontas, revived the drooping hopes of the\r\nsurvivors at Jamestown. The arrival of Newport at the same juncture with\r\nstores and a number of additional settlers, being part of the first\r\nsupply sent out from England by the treasurer and council, was joyfully\r\nwelcomed. Pocahontas too, with her tawny train of attendants, frequently\r\nvisited Jamestown, with presents of bread, and venison, and raccoons,\r\nsent by Powhatan for Smith and Newport. However, the improvident traffic\r\nallowed between Newport's mariners and the natives, soon extremely\r\nenhanced the price of provisions, and the too protracted detention of\r\nhis vessel made great inroads upon the public store. Newport, not long\r\nafter his arrival, accompanied by Smith, Scrivener, newly arrived, and\r\nmade one of the council, and thirty or forty picked men, visited\r\nPowhatan at Werowocomoco. Upon their arrival, Smith landed with a party\r\nof men, and after crossing several creeks on bridges of poles and bark,\r\n(for it appears that he had mistaken the right landing place, having\r\nprobably passed up a little beyond the mouth of Timberneck Bay,) they\r\nwere met and escorted to the town by Opechancanough, Nantaquaus,\r\nPowhatan's son, and two hundred warriors. Powhatan was found seated on\r\nhis bedstead throne of mats, with his buckskin pillow or cushion,\r\nembroidered with beads. More than forty trays of bread stood without, in\r\nrows on each side of the door. Four or five hundred Indians were\r\npresent. Newport landed on the next day, and some days were past in\r\nfeasting, and dancing, and trading, in which last Powhatan exhibited a\r\ncurious mixture of huckstering cunning, and regal pride. Smith gave him\r\na suit of red cloth, a white greyhound, and a hat. Charmed with some\r\nblue beads, for one or two pounds of them he gave in exchange two or\r\nthree hundred bushels of corn. Newport presented him a boy named Thomas\r\nSalvage, in return for an Indian named Namontack. Smith acted as\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\nThe English next visited Opechancanough, at his seat, Pamunkey. The blue\r\nbeads came to be in great request, and none dared to wear them save the\r\nchiefs and their families. Having procured a further supply of corn at\r\nthis place, Newport and his party returned to Jamestown, which was now\r\ndestroyed by an accidental fire. Originating in the public storehouse,\r\nthe flames spread rapidly over the cabins, thatched with reeds,\r\nconsuming even the palisades, some eight or ten yards distant. Arms,\r\napparel, bedding, and much of their private provision, were consumed, as\r\nwas also a temporary church, which had been erected. \"The minister,\r\nHunt, lost all his library, and all that he had but the clothes on his\r\nback; yet none ever heard him repine at his loss. Upon any alarm he was\r\nas ready for defence as any, and till he could not speak, he never\r\nceased to his utmost to animate us constantly to persist; whose soul,\r\nquestionless, is with God.\"[51:A] As no further mention is made of him\r\nat Jamestown, it is probable that he did not live long after this fire.\r\nDr. Hawks, however, conjectures that he survived long enough to\r\nofficiate in the first marriage in Virginia, which took place in the\r\nyear 1608.[51:B] He appears to have resided in the County of Kent,\r\nEngland, where, in January, 1594, he was appointed to the vicarage of\r\nReculver, which he resigned in 1602. But he probably still continued to\r\nreside there, or to consider that his home, until he embarked for\r\nVirginia, because when in the Downs, which are opposite to Kent, he was\r\nonly twenty miles \"from his habitation.\" Of his appointment as chaplain\r\nto the expedition, Wingfield, in his journal referred to before, gives\r\nthe following account: \"For my first work, (which was to make a right\r\nchoice of a spiritual pastor,) I appeal to the remembrance of my Lord of\r\nCanterbury's Grace, who gave me very gracious audience in my request.\r\nAnd the world knoweth whom I took with me, truly a man, in my opinion,\r\nnot any way to be touched with the rebellious humor of a papist spirit,\r\nnor blemished with the least suspicion of a factious schismatic.\" My\r\nLord of Canterbury was that persecuting prelate, Archbishop Bancroft,\r\nwho persecuted the Puritan dissenters till they desired to come over to\r\nVirginia to get out of his reach, and which they were prohibited from\r\ndoing by a royal proclamation, issued at his instance. Rev. Robert Hunt,\r\nby all the notices of him that are given, appears to have been a pious,\r\ndisinterested, resolute, and exemplary man.\r\n\r\nWhen the English first settled at Jamestown, their place of worship\r\nconsisted of an awning, or old sail, suspended between three or four\r\ntrees, to protect them from the sun; the area covered by it was inclosed\r\nby wooden rails; the seats were unhewed trees, till plank was cut; the\r\npulpit was a wooden crosspiece nailed to two neighboring trees. In\r\ninclement weather an old decayed tent served for the place of worship.\r\nAfter awhile, by the zeal of the minister Hunt, and the assistance of\r\nNewport's seamen, a homely structure like a barn was erected, \"set upon\r\ncrachets, covered with rafts, sedge, and earth,\" as likewise were the\r\nsides, the best of the houses being constructed after the same fashion,\r\nand the greater part of them worse than the church, so that they were\r\nbut a poor defence against wind or rain. Nevertheless, the service was\r\nread daily, morning and evening, and on Sunday two sermons were\r\npreached, and the communion celebrated every three months, till the Rev.\r\nMr. Hunt died. After which prayers were still said daily, and a homily\r\nread on Sunday, and so it continued until the arrival of other preachers\r\nsome two or three years afterwards. The salary allowed Mr. Hunt appears\r\nto have been £500 a year, appropriated by the council of the Virginia\r\nCompany in England, consented to by the council in Virginia, and\r\nconfirmed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1605, to Richard Hackluyt,\r\nPrebend of Westminster, who, by his authority, sent out Mr. Hunt, \"an\r\nhonest, religious, and courageous divine, during whose life our factions\r\nwere oft qualified, our wants and greatest extremities so comforted,\r\nthat they seemed easy in comparison of what we endured after his\r\nmemorable death.\"[52:A]\r\n\r\nThe stock of provisions running low, the colonists at Jamestown were\r\nreduced to a diet of meal and water, and this, together with their\r\nexposure to cold, after the loss of their habitations, cut off upwards\r\nof one-half of them. Their condition was made still worse by a rage for\r\ngold that now seized them. \"There was no talk, no hope, no work, but dig\r\ngold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold.\" Smith, not indulging in these\r\nempty dreams of imaginary wealth, laughed at their infatuation in\r\nloading \"such a drunken ship with gilded dust.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Newport, after a delay of three months and a half, being now\r\nready to sail for England, and the planters having no use for\r\nparliaments, places, petitions, admirals, recorders, interpreters,\r\nchronologers, courts of plea, nor justices of the peace, sent Master\r\nWingfield and Captain Archer home with him, so that they, who had\r\ningrossed all those titles to themselves, might seek some better place\r\nof employment. Newport carried with him twenty turkeys, which had been\r\npresented to him by Powhatan, who had demanded and received twenty\r\nswords in return for them. This fowl, peculiar to America, had been many\r\nyears before carried to England by some of the early discoverers of\r\nNorth America.[53:A]\r\n\r\nAfter Newport's departure, Ratcliffe, the president, lived in ease,\r\npeculating on the public store. The spring now approaching, Smith and\r\nScrivener undertook to rebuild Jamestown, repair the palisades, fell\r\ntrees, prepare the fields, plant and erect another church. While thus\r\nengaged they were joyfully surprised by the arrival of the Phoenix,\r\ncommanded by Captain Nelson, who had left England with Newport, about\r\nthe end of the year 1607, and after coming within sight of Cape Henry,\r\nhad been driven off to the West Indies. He brought with him the\r\nremainder of the first supply, which comprised one hundred and twenty\r\nsettlers. Having found provisions in the West Indies, and having\r\neconomically husbanded his own, he imparted them generously to the\r\ncolony, so that now there was accumulated a store sufficient for half a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nPowhatan having effected so advantageous an exchange with Newport,\r\nafterwards sent Smith twenty turkeys, but receiving no swords in return,\r\nhe was highly offended, and ordered his people to take them by fraud or\r\nforce, and they accordingly attempted to seize them at the gates of\r\nJamestown. The president and Martin, who now ruled, remained inactive,\r\nunder pretence of orders from England not to offend the natives; but\r\nsome of them happening to meddle with Smith, he handled them so roughly,\r\nby whipping and imprisonment, as to repress their insolence.\r\n\r\nPocahontas, in beauty of feature, expression, and form, far surpassed\r\nany of the natives; and in intelligence and spirit \"was the nonpareil of\r\nher country.\" Powhatan, hearing that some of his people were kept\r\nprisoners at Jamestown, sent her, with Rawhunt, (who was as remarkable\r\nfor his personal deformity, but shrewd and crafty,) with presents of a\r\ndeer and some bread to sue for their ransom. Smith released the\r\nprisoners, and Pocahontas was dismissed with presents. Thus the scheme\r\nof Powhatan to destroy the English with their own swords, was happily\r\nfrustrated.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix was freighted with a cargo of cedar, and the unserviceable,\r\ngold-hunting Captain Martin, concluded to return with her to England. Of\r\nthe 120 settlers brought by Newport and Nelson, there were 33 gentlemen,\r\n21 laborers, (some of them only footmen,) 6 tailors, 2 apothecaries, 2\r\njewellers, 2 gold-refiners, 2 goldsmiths, a gunsmith, a perfumer, a\r\nsurgeon, a cooper, a tobacco-pipe maker, and a blacksmith.[54:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36:A] See charter in Stith's Hist. of Va., Appendix; \"Notes as to the\r\nLimits of Virginia,\" by Littleton Waller Tazewell, in Va.

The party embarked in an open barge of\r\nless than three tons, and dropping down the James River, parted with the\r\nPhoenix off Cape Henry, and crossing over thence to the Eastern Shore,\r\ndiscovered and named, after their commander, \"Smith's Isles.\" At Cape\r\nCharles they met some grim, athletic savages, with bone-headed spears in\r\ntheir hands, who directed them to the dwelling-place of the Werowance of\r\nAccomac, who was found courteous and friendly, and the handsomest native\r\nthat they had yet seen. His country pleasant, fertile, and intersected\r\nby creeks, affording good harbors for small craft. The people spoke the\r\nlanguage of Powhatan. Smith pursuing his voyage, came upon some\r\nuninhabited isles, which were then named after Dr. Russel, surgeon of\r\nthe party, but now are known as the Tangier Islands. Searching there for\r\nfresh water, they fell in with the River Wighcomoco, now called\r\nPocomoke; the northern point was named Watkins' Point, and a hill on\r\nthe south side of Pocomoke Bay, Keale's Hill, after two of the soldiers\r\nin the barge. Leaving that river they came to a high promontory called\r\nPoint Ployer, in honor of a French nobleman, the former friend of Smith.\r\nThere they discovered a pond of hot water. In a thunder-storm the\r\nbarge's mast and sail were blown overboard, and the explorers, narrowly\r\nescaping from the fury of the elements, found it necessary to remain for\r\ntwo days on an island, which they named Limbo, but it is now known as\r\none of Watts' Islands. Repairing the sails with their shirts, they\r\nvisited a river on the Eastern Shore called Cuskarawaok, and now, by a\r\nsingular transposition of names, called Wighcocomoco. Here the Indians\r\nran along the banks in wild amazement, some climbing to the tops of\r\ntrees and shooting their arrows at the strangers. On the following day a\r\nvolley of musquetry dispersed the savages, and the English found some\r\ncabins, in which they left pieces of copper, beads, bells and\r\nlooking-glasses. On the ensuing day a great number of Indians, men,\r\nwomen, and children, thronged around Smith and his companions with many\r\nexpressions of friendship. These savages were of the tribes Nause,\r\nSarapinagh, Arseek, and Nantaquak, of all others the most expert in\r\ntrade. They were of small stature like the people of Wighcocomoco; wore\r\nthe finest furs, and manufactured a great deal of Roenoke, or Indian\r\nmoney, made out of shells. The Eastern Shore of the bay was found low\r\nand well wooded; the Western well watered, but hilly and barren; the\r\nvalleys fruitful, thickly wooded, and abounding in deer, wolves, bears,\r\nand other wild animals. A navigable stream was called Bolus, from a\r\nparti-colored gum-like clay found on its banks, it is now known as the\r\nPatapsco.\r\n\r\nThe party having been about a fortnight voyaging in an open boat,\r\nfatigued at the oar, and subsisting on mouldy bread, now importuned\r\nSmith to return to Jamestown. He at first refused, but shortly after,\r\nthe sickness of his men, and the unfavorable weather, compelled him\r\nreluctantly to turn back, where the bay was about nine miles wide and\r\nnine or ten fathoms deep. On the sixteenth of June they fell in with the\r\nmouth of the Patawomeke, or Potomac, where it appeared to be seven miles\r\nwide; and the tranquil magnificence of that majestic river reanimated\r\ntheir drooping spirits, and the sick having now recovered, they agreed\r\nto explore it.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty miles above the mouth, near the future birth-place of\r\nWashington, two Indians conducted them up a small creek, toward Nominy,\r\nwhere the banks swarmed with thousands of the natives, who, with their\r\npainted bodies and hideous yells, seemed so many infernal demons. Their\r\nnoisy threats were soon silenced by the glancing of the English bullets\r\non the water and the report of the muskets re-echoing in the forests,\r\nand the astonished red men dropped their bows and arrows, and, hostages\r\nbeing exchanged, received the whites kindly. Toward the head of the\r\nriver they met some canoes laden with bear, deer, and other game, which\r\nthe Indians shared with the English.\r\n\r\nOn their return down the river, Japazaws, chief of Potomac, having\r\nfurnished them with guides to conduct them up the River Quiyough, at the\r\nmouth of which he lived, (supposed by Stith[57:A] to be Potomac Creek,)\r\nin quest of Matchqueon, a mine, which they had heard of, the party left\r\nthe Indian hostages in the barge, secured by a small chain, which they\r\nwere to have for their reward. The mine turned out to be worthless,\r\ncontaining only a sort of antimony, used by the natives to paint\r\nthemselves and their idols, and which gave them the appearance of\r\nblackamoors powdered with silver-dust. The credulous Newport had taken\r\nsome bags of it to England as containing silver. The wild animals\r\nobserved were the beaver, otter, mink, marten, and bear; of fish they\r\nmet with great numbers, sometimes lying in such schools near the surface\r\nthat, in absence of nets, they undertook to catch them with a\r\nfrying-pan; but, plenty as they were, they were not to be caught with\r\nfrying-pans. The barge running aground at the mouth of the Rappahannock,\r\nSmith amused himself \"spearing\" them with his sword, and in taking one\r\nfrom its point it stung him in the wrist. In a little while the symptoms\r\nproved so alarming that his companions concluded his death to be at\r\nhand, and sorrowfully prepared his grave in a neighboring island by his\r\ndirections. But by Dr. Russel's judicious treatment the patient quickly\r\nrecovered, and supped that evening upon the offending fish. This\r\nincident gave its name to Stingray Island. The fish was of the ray\r\nspecies, much like a thornback, but with a long tail like a horse-whip,\r\ncontaining a poisoned sting with a serrate edge.\r\n\r\nThe party returned to Jamestown late in July, and found sickness and\r\ndiscontent still prevalent there. Ratcliffe, the president, was deposed\r\nin favor of Smith, who, of the council, was next entitled to succeed;\r\nbut Smith substituted Scrivener in his stead, and embarked again to\r\ncomplete his discoveries.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of July he set out for the Chesapeake Bay, his\r\ncompany consisting of six gentlemen, including Anthony Bagnall, surgeon,\r\nand six soldiers. Detained some days at Kecoughtan, (Hampton,) they were\r\nhospitably entertained by the Indians there, who were astonished by some\r\nrockets thrown up in the evening. Reaching the head of the bay, the\r\nexplorers met some canoes manned by Massawomeks, who, after their first\r\nalarm being propitiated by the present of two bells, presented Smith\r\nwith bear's meat, venison, fish, bows, arrows, targets, and bear-skins.\r\nStith supposed this nation to be the same with the Iroquois, or Five\r\nNations.[58:A]\r\n\r\nOn the River Tockwogh (now Sassafras) Smith came to an Indian town,\r\nfortified with a palisade and breastworks, and here men, women, and\r\nchildren, came forth to welcome the whites with songs and dances,\r\noffering them fruits, furs, and whatever they had, spreading mats for\r\nthem to sit on, and in every way expressing their friendship. They had\r\ntomahawks, knives, and pieces of iron and copper, which, as they\r\nalleged, they had procured from the Sasquesahannocks, a mighty people\r\ndwelling two days' journey distant on the borders of the Susquehanna.\r\nSuckahanna, in the Powhatan language, signifies \"water.\"[58:B]\r\n\r\nTwo interpreters being dispatched to invite the Sasquesahannocks to\r\nvisit the English, in three or four days sixty of that gigantic people\r\narrived, with presents of venison, tobacco-pipes three feet long,\r\nbaskets, targets, bows and arrows. Five of their chiefs embarked in the\r\nbarge to cross the bay. It being Smith's custom daily to have prayers\r\nwith a psalm, the savages were filled with wonder at it, and in their\r\nturn performed a sort of adoration, holding their hands up to the sun,\r\nand chanting a wild unearthly song. They then embraced Captain Smith,\r\nadoring him in the like manner, apparently looking upon him as some\r\ncelestial visitant, and overwhelming him with a profusion of presents\r\nand abject homage.\r\n\r\nThe highest mountain seen by the voyagers to the northward they named\r\nPeregrine's Mount; and Willoughby River derived its name from Smith's\r\nnative town. At the extreme limits of discovery crosses were carved in\r\nthe bark of trees, or brass crosses were left. The tribes on the\r\nPatuxent were found very tractable, and more civil than any others. On\r\nthe banks of the picturesque Rappahannock, Smith and his party were\r\nkindly treated by the Moraughtacunds; and here they met with Mosco, one\r\nof the Wighcocomocoes, who was remarkable for a bushy black beard,\r\nwhereas the natives in general had little or none. He proved to be of\r\ngreat service to the English in exploring the Rappahannock. Mr. Richard\r\nFetherstone, a gentleman of the company, died during this part of the\r\nvoyage, and was buried on the sequestered banks of this river, where a\r\nbay was named after him. The river was explored to the falls, (near\r\nFredericksburg,) where a skirmish took place with the Rappahannocks.\r\n\r\nSmith next explored the Pianketank, where the inhabitants were, for the\r\nmost part, absent on a hunting excursion, only a few women, children,\r\nand old men being left to tend the corn. Returning thence the barge\r\nencountered a tremendous thunder-storm in Gosnold's Bay, and running\r\nbefore the wind, the voyagers could only catch fitful glimpses of the\r\nland, by the flashes of lightning, which saved them from dashing to\r\npieces on the shore, and directed them to Point Comfort. They next\r\nvisited Chesapeake, now Elizabeth River, (on which Norfolk is situated,)\r\nsix or seven miles from the mouth of which they came upon two or three\r\ncultivated patches and some cabins. After this they sailed seven or\r\neight miles up the Nansemond, and found its banks consisting mainly of\r\noyster-shells. Skirmishing here with the Chesapeakes and Nansemonds,\r\nSmith procured as much corn as he could carry away. September the 7th,\r\n1608, the party arrived at Jamestown, after an absence of upwards of\r\nthree months, and found some of the colonists recovered, others still\r\nsick, many dead, Ratcliffe, the late president, under arrest for mutiny,\r\nthe harvest gathered, but the stock of provisions damaged by rain.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer, Smith, with a few men, in a small barge, in his\r\nseveral voyages of discovery traversed a distance of not less than three\r\nthousand miles.[60:A] He had been at Jamestown only three days in three\r\nmonths, and had, during this interval, explored the whole of Chesapeake\r\nBay and of the country lying on its shores, and made a map of them.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1607 the Plymouth Company, under the direction of Lord Chief\r\nJustice Popham, dispatched a vessel to inspect their territory of North\r\nVirginia. That vessel being captured by the Spaniards, Sir John Popham,\r\nat his own expense, sent out another, which, having returned with a\r\nfavorable report of the country, he was enabled to equip an expedition\r\nfor the purpose of effecting a settlement there. Under the command of\r\nhis brother, Henry Popham, and of Raleigh Gilbert, a nephew of Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert, a hundred emigrants, embarking May, 1607, in two\r\nvessels, repaired to North Virginia, and seated themselves at the mouth\r\nof the River Sagahadock, where they erected Fort St. George. However,\r\nafter enduring a great deal of sickness and hardship, and losing several\r\nof their number, including their president, Henry Popham, and hearing by\r\na supply-vessel of the death of their chief patrons, Sir John Popham,\r\nand Sir John Gilbert, (brother of Raleigh Gilbert,) they gladly\r\nabandoned the colony, and returned to England in the spring of 1608.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year that Henry Hudson, an Englishman, employed by the\r\nDutch East India Company, after entering the Chesapeake, and remarking\r\nthe infant settlement of the English, discovered the beautiful river\r\nwhich still retains the name of that distinguished navigator. The Dutch\r\nafterwards erected near its mouth, and on the Island of Manhattan, the\r\nfort and cabins of New Amsterdam, the germ of New York.\r\n\r\nSmith had hitherto declined, but now consented, September, 1608, to\r\nundertake the office of president. Ratcliffe was under arrest for\r\nmutiny; and the building of the fine house which he had commenced for\r\nhimself in the woods, was discontinued. The church was repaired, the\r\nstorehouse newly covered, magazines for supplies erected, the fort\r\nreduced to a pentagon figure, the watch renewed, troops trained; and the\r\nwhole company mustered every Saturday in the plain by the west bulwark,\r\ncalled \"Smithfield.\" There, sometimes, more than a hundred dark-eyed and\r\ndark-haired tawny Indians would stand in amazement to see a file of\r\nsoldiers batter a tree, where a target was set up to shoot at.\r\n\r\nNewport arrived with a second supply, and brought out also presents for\r\nPowhatan, a basin and ewer, bedstead and suit of scarlet clothes.\r\nNewport, upon this voyage, had procured a private commission in which he\r\nstood pledged to perform one of three impossibilities; for he engaged\r\nnot to return to England without either a lump of gold, a certainty of\r\nthe South Sea, or one of Sir Walter Raleigh's lost colonists. Newport\r\nbrought also orders to discover the Manakin (originally Monacan)\r\ncountry, and a barge constructed so as to be taken to pieces, which they\r\nwere to carry beyond the falls, so as to convey them down by some river\r\nrunning westward to the South Sea or Pacific Ocean. Vasco Nunez, in\r\n1513, crossing the Isthmus of Darien, from the summit of a mountain\r\ndiscovered, beyond the other side of the continent, an ocean, which,\r\nfrom the direction in which he saw it, took the name of the \"South Sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe cost of this last supply brought out by Newport was two thousand\r\npounds, and the company ordered that the vessels should be sent back\r\nfreighted with cargoes of corresponding value, and threatened, in case\r\nof a failure, that the colonists should be left in Virginia as banished\r\nmen. It appears that the Virginia Company had been deeply incensed by a\r\nletter received by Lord Salisbury, (Sir Robert Cecil,) Secretary of\r\nState, reporting that the planters intended to divide the country among\r\nthemselves. It is altogether improbable that they had conceived any\r\ndesign of appropriating a country which so few of them were willing to\r\ncultivate, and from which so many of them were anxious to escape. The\r\nfolly of the instructions was only surpassed by the inhumanity of the\r\nthreat, and this folly and inhumanity were justly exposed by Smith's\r\nletter in reply.[61:A]\r\n\r\nNewport brought over with him Captains Peter Wynne and Richard Waldo,\r\ntwo veteran soldiers and valiant gentlemen; Francis West, brother of\r\nLord Delaware; Raleigh Crashaw; Thomas Forest with Mrs. Forest, and Anne\r\nBurras, her maid; the first Englishwomen that landed at Jamestown.[62:A]\r\nSome Poles and Germans were sent out to make pitch, tar, glass, soap,\r\nashes, and erect mills. Waldo and Wynne were admitted into the council;\r\nand Ratcliffe was restored to his seat.\r\n\r\nThe time appointed for Powhatan's coronation now drawing near, Smith,\r\naccompanied by Captain Waldo, and three others, went overland to a point\r\non the Pamaunkee (York) River, opposite Werowocomoco, to which they\r\ncrossed over in an Indian canoe. Upon reaching Werowocomoco, Powhatan\r\nbeing found absent, was sent for, and, in the mean time, Smith and his\r\ncomrades were being entertained by Pocahontas and her companions. They\r\nmade a fire in an open field, and Smith being seated on a mat before it,\r\npresently a hideous noise and shrieking being heard in the adjoining\r\nwoods, the English snatched up their arms, and seized two or three aged\r\nIndians; but Pocahontas immediately came, and protested to Smith that he\r\nmight slay her if any surprise was intended, and he was quickly\r\nsatisfied that his apprehensions were groundless. Then thirty young\r\nwomen emerged from the woods, all naked, save a cincture of green\r\nleaves, their bodies being painted; Pocahontas wearing on her head a\r\nbeautiful pair of buck's horns, an otter's skin at her girdle and\r\nanother on her arm; a quiver hung on her shoulder, and she held a bow\r\nand arrow in her hand. Of the other nymphs, one held a sword, another a\r\nclub, a third a pot-stick, with the antlers of the deer on their heads,\r\nand a variety of other savage ornaments. Bursting from the forest, like\r\nso many fiends, with unearthly shrieks, they circled around the fire\r\nsinging and dancing, and thus continued for an hour, when they again\r\nretired to the woods. Returning, they invited Smith to their\r\nhabitations, where, as soon as he entered, they all crowded around,\r\nhanging about him with cries of \"Love you not me? love you not me?\" They\r\nthen feasted their guest; some serving, others singing and dancing, till\r\nat last, with blazing torches of light-wood, they escorted him to his\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, Powhatan having arrived, Smith informed him of the\r\npresents that had been sent out for him; restored to him Namontack, who\r\nhad been taken to England, and invited the chief to visit Jamestown to\r\naccept the presents, and with Newport's aid to revenge himself upon his\r\nenemies, the Monacans. Powhatan, in reply, refused to visit Jamestown,\r\nsaying that he, too, was a king; but he consented to wait eight days to\r\nreceive presents; as for the Monacans, he was able to avenge his\r\ngrievances himself. In regard to the salt water beyond the mountains, of\r\nwhich Smith had spoken, Powhatan denied that there was any such, and\r\ndrew lines of those regions on the ground. Smith returned to Jamestown,\r\nand the presents being sent round to Werowocomoco by water, near a\r\nhundred miles, Newport and Smith, with fifty men, proceeded thither by\r\nthe direct route across the neck of land that separates the James from\r\nthe York.\r\n\r\nAll being assembled at Werowocomoco, the ensuing day was set for the\r\ncoronation, when the presents were delivered to Powhatan--a basin, ewer,\r\nbed, and furniture ready set up. A scarlet cloak and suit of apparel\r\nwere with difficulty put upon him, Namontack, meanwhile, insisting that\r\nit would not hurt him. Still more strenuous efforts were found necessary\r\nto make him kneel to receive the crown, till, at last, by dint of urgent\r\npersuasions, and pressing hard upon his shoulders, he was induced,\r\nreluctantly, to stoop a little, when three of the English placed the\r\ncrown upon his head. At an appointed signal a volley of musketry was\r\nfired from the boats, and Powhatan started up from his seat in alarm,\r\nfrom which, however, he was in a few moments relieved. As if, by way of\r\nbefitting satire upon so ridiculous a ceremony, Powhatan graciously\r\npresented his old moccasins and mantle to Newport, and some corn; but\r\nrefused to allow him any guides except Namontack. The English having\r\npurchased, in the town, a small additional supply of corn, left\r\nWerowocomoco, and returned to Jamestown.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Newport, contrary to Smith's advice, undertook to\r\nexplore the Monacan country, on the borders of the upper James River,\r\nwith one hundred and twenty picked men, commanded by Captain Waldo,\r\nLieutenant Percy, Captain Wynne, Mr. West, and Mr. Scrivener. Smith,\r\nwith eighty or ninety men, some sick, some feeble, being left at\r\nJamestown; Newport and his party, embarking in the pinnace and boats,\r\nwent up to the falls of the river, where, landing, they marched forty\r\nmiles beyond on the south side in two days and a half, and returned by\r\nthe same route, discovering two towns of the Monacans--Massinacak, and\r\nMowchemenchouch. The natives, \"the Stoics of the woods,\" evinced neither\r\nfriendship nor enmity; and the English, out of abundant caution, took\r\none of their chiefs, and led him bound at once a hostage and a guide.\r\nHaving failed to procure any corn from the Indians, Newport's party\r\nreturned from the exploration of this picturesque, fertile, well-watered\r\nregion, more than half of them sick or lame, and disheartened with\r\nfatigue, stinted rations, and disappointed hopes of finding gold.\r\n\r\nSmith, the president, now set the colonists to work; some to make glass,\r\nothers to prepare tar, pitch, and soap-ashes; while he, in person,\r\nconducted thirty of them five miles below the fort to cut down trees and\r\nsaw plank. Two of this lumber-party happened to be young gentlemen, who\r\nhad arrived in the last supply. Smith sharing labor and hardship in\r\ncommon with the rest, these woodmen, at first, became apparently\r\nreconciled to the novel task, and seemed to listen with pleasure to the\r\ncrashing thunder of the falling trees; but when the axes began to\r\nblister their unaccustomed hands, they grew profane, and their frequent\r\nloud oaths echoed in the woods. Smith taking measures to have the oaths\r\nof each one numbered, in the evening, for each offence, poured a can of\r\nwater down the offender's sleeve; and this curious discipline, or\r\nwater-cure, was so effectual, that after it was administered, an oath\r\nwould scarcely be heard in a week. Smith found that thirty or forty\r\ngentlemen who volunteered to work, could do more in a day than one\r\nhundred that worked by compulsion; but, he adds, that twenty good\r\nworkmen would have been better than the whole of them put together.\r\n\r\nSmith finding so much time wasted, and no provisions obtained, and\r\nNewport's vessel lying idle at heavy charge, embarked in the discovery\r\nbarge, taking with him eighteen men and another boat, and leaving orders\r\nfor Lieutenant Percy to follow after him, went up the Chickahominy.\r\nBeing overtaken by Percy, he procured a supply of corn. Upon his return\r\nto Jamestown, Newport and Ratcliffe, instigated by jealousy, attempted\r\nto depose Smith from the presidency, but he defeated their schemes. The\r\ncolony suffered much loss at this time by an illicit trade carried on\r\nbetween the sailors of Newport's vessel, dishonest settlers, and the\r\nIndians. Smith threatened to send away the vessel and to oblige Newport\r\nto remain a year in the colony, so that he might learn to judge of\r\naffairs by his own experience, but Newport submitting, and acknowledging\r\nhimself in the wrong, the threat was not executed. Scrivener visiting\r\nWerowocomoco, by the said of Namontack procured another supply of corn\r\nand some puccoons, a root which it was supposed would make an excellent\r\ndye, as the Indians used its red juice to stain their faces.\r\n\r\nNewport at last sailed for England, leaving at Jamestown two hundred\r\nsouls, carrying a cargo of such pitch, tar, glass, and soap-ashes as the\r\ncolonists had been able to get ready. Ratcliffe, whose real name was\r\ndiscovered to be Sicklemore, was sent back at the same time. Smith in\r\nhis letter to the council in England, exhibited, in caustic terms, the\r\npreposterous folly of expecting a present profitable return from\r\nVirginia. He sent them also his map of the country, drawn with so much\r\naccuracy, that it has been taken as the groundwork of all succeeding\r\nmaps of Virginia.\r\n\r\nNot long after Newport's departure, Anne Burras was married at Jamestown\r\nto John Laydon, the first marriage in Virginia. Smith finding the\r\nprovisions running low, made a voyage to Nansemond, and afterwards went\r\nup the James, and discovered the river and people of Appomattock, who\r\ngave part of their scanty store of corn in exchange for copper and toys.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Powhatan sent an invitation to Smith to visit him, and a\r\nrequest that he would send men to build him a house, and give him a\r\ngrindstone, fifty swords, some guns, a cock and hen, with much copper,\r\nand many beads, in return for which he promised to load his vessel with\r\ncorn. Having dispatched by land a party of Englishmen and four Dutchmen\r\nto build the house, Smith, accompanied by the brave Waldo, set out for\r\nWerowocomoco on the twenty-ninth of December, with the pinnace and two\r\nbarges manned with forty-six men. Smith went in a barge with six\r\ngentlemen and as many soldiers, while in the pinnace were Lieutenant\r\nPercy and Francis West, with a number of gentlemen and soldiers. The\r\nlittle fleet dropping down the James arrived on the first night at\r\nWarrasqueake, from which place Sicklemore, a veteran soldier, was\r\ndispatched with two Indian guides in quest of Sir Walter Raleigh's lost\r\ncompany, and of silk grass. Smith left Samuel Collier, his page, at\r\nWarrasqueake to learn the language. The party being detained, by\r\ninclement weather, a week at Kecoughtan, spent the holidays there among\r\nthe natives, feasting on oysters, venison, wild-fowl, and good bread,\r\nenjoying also excellent fires in the dry, smoky cabins. While here Smith\r\nand two others killed one hundred and forty-eight wild-fowl in three\r\nshots.\r\n\r\nAt Kiskiack, (now Chescake, pronounced Cheese-cake,) the severity of the\r\ncold again compelled the English to take shelter in the Indian wigwams.\r\nOn the twelfth day of January they reached Werowocomoco. The York River\r\nbeing frozen over near half a mile from the shore, Smith, to lose no\r\ntime, undertook to break his way through the ice; but the tide ebbing,\r\nleft the barge aground on a shoal. In this dilemma, although the cold\r\nwas extreme, Smith jumping into the icy river, set the example to his\r\nmen of wading near waist deep to the shore, where, quartering in the\r\nfirst cabins that they reached, they sent to Powhatan for provisions. On\r\nthe following day he supplied them abundantly with bread, wild turkeys,\r\nand venison. Like Nestor of old, he told Smith somewhat extravagantly,\r\nthat he had seen the death of all of his people thrice; that he was now\r\nold and must ere long die; that his brothers, Opitchapan,\r\nOpechancanough, and Kekataugh, his two sisters, and their two daughters,\r\nwere to be his successors. He deprecated war, and declared that when he\r\nand his people, forced to fly by fear of the English, lay in the woods,\r\nexposed to cold and hunger, if a twig but broke, every one cried out,\r\n\"There comes Captain Smith.\" At length, after a long dialogue, Powhatan\r\nstill obstinately insisting that the English should lay aside their\r\narms, Smith gave orders privately to his people in the boat to approach\r\nand capture him. Discovering their design he fled with his women and\r\nchildren, while his warriors beset the cabin where Smith was. With\r\npistol, sword, and target, he rushed out among them and fired; some fell\r\none over another, the rest escaped.\r\n\r\nPowhatan, finding himself in Smith's power, to make his peace sent him,\r\nby an aged orator, a large bracelet and a string of beads, and in the\r\nmean while the savages, goodly, well-formed fellows, but grim-looking,\r\ncarried the corn on their backs down to the boats. The barges of the\r\nEnglish being left aground by the ebb-tide, they were obliged to wait\r\ntill the next high-water; and they returned ashore to lodge in some\r\nIndian wigwams.\r\n\r\nPowhatan, and the treacherous Dutchmen who had been sent to build him a\r\nhouse, and who were attracted by the abundant good cheer that they\r\nenjoyed at Werowocomoco, now together plotted Smith's destruction. But\r\nPocahontas, the chieftain's dearest jewel, in that dark night, passing\r\nthrough the gloomy woods, told Smith that great cheer would soon be sent\r\nto him, but that her father with all his force would quickly come and\r\nkill him and all the English, with their own weapons, while at supper;\r\nthat therefore, if he would live, she wished him to go at once. Smith\r\nwould have given her such toys as she delighted in; but, with tears\r\nstreaming down her cheeks, she said that she would not dare to be seen\r\nto have them, for if her father should know it she would die; and so she\r\nran away by herself as she had come. The attempt to surprise Smith was\r\naccordingly soon after made; but, forewarned, he readily defeated the\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the tide, Smith and his party embarked for Pamaunkee,\r\nat the head of the river, leaving with Powhatan Edward Boynton, to kill\r\nfowl for him, and the Dutchmen, whose treachery was not as yet\r\nsuspected, to finish his house. As the party sent forward to build the\r\nhouse had been there about two weeks, and as the chimney is erected\r\nafter the house, it may be probably inferred that \"Powhatan's Chimney\"\r\nwas built by the Dutchmen. It indeed looks like a chimney of one of\r\nthose Dutch houses described by Irving in his inimitable \"Legend of\r\nSleepy Hollow.\" It is the oldest relic of construction now extant in\r\nVirginia, and is associated with the most interesting incident in our\r\nearly history. This chimney is built of stone found on the banks of\r\nTimberneck Bay, and easily quarried; it is eighteen and a half feet\r\nhigh, ten and a half wide at the base, and has a double flue. The\r\nfire-place is eight feet wide, with an oaken beam across. The chimney\r\nstands on an eminence, and is conspicuous from every quarter of the bay;\r\nand itself a monumental evidence of no inconsiderable import. That the\r\ncolonists would construct for Powhatan's house a durable and massive\r\nchimney there is every reason to believe, and here is such a one still\r\nextant, and still retaining, through all the mutations of time, the\r\ntraditional name of \"Powhatan's Chimney.\" There is no other such chimney\r\nin all that region, nor the remains of such a one. At the foot of the\r\nyard, and at a short distance from the chimney, which is still in use,\r\nbeing attached to a modern farm-house, is a fine spring, formerly shaded\r\nby a venerable umbrageous red-oak, of late years blown down. In the\r\nrivulet that steals along a ravine from the spring, Pocahontas sported\r\nin her childhood. Her name, according to Heckwelder, signifies \"a\r\nrivulet between two hills,\" but this is denied by others.\r\n\r\nIn the early annals of Virginia, Werowocomoco is second only to\r\nJamestown in historical and romantic interest; as Jamestown was the seat\r\nof the English settlers, so Werowocomoco was the favorite residence of\r\nthe Indian monarch Powhatan. It was here that, when Smith was about to\r\nmeet his fate,\r\n\r\n     \"An angel knelt in woman's form\r\n      And breathed a prayer for him.\"\r\n\r\nIt was here that Powhatan was crowned by the conceited Newport; here\r\nthat supplies for the colony were frequently procured; here that\r\noccurred so many interviews and rencontres between the red men and the\r\nwhites. Here, two centuries and a half ago, dwelt the famous old\r\nPowhatan, tall, erect, stern, apparently beardless, his hair a little\r\nfrosted with gray. Here he beheld, with barbarous satisfaction, the\r\nscalps of his enemies recently massacred, suspended on a line between\r\ntwo trees, and waving in the breeze; here he listened to recitals of\r\nhunting and blood, and in the red glare of the council-fire planned\r\nschemes of perfidy and revenge; here he sate and smoked, sometimes\r\nobserving Pocahontas at play, sometimes watching the fleet canoe coming\r\nin from the Pamaunkee. Werowocomoco was a befitting seat of the great\r\nchief, overlooking the bay, with its bold, picturesque, wood-crowned\r\nbanks, and in view of the wide majestic flood of the river, empurpled by\r\ntransient cloud-shadows, or tinged with the rosy splendor of a summer\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57:A] Stith, 65.\r\n\r\n[58:A] Stith, 67.\r\n\r\n[58:B] Smith, i. 147.\r\n\r\n[60:A] Smith, i. 191.\r\n\r\n[61:A] Stith, 82; Smith, 200.\r\n\r\n[62:A] Smith, i. 193.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1608-1609.\r\n\r\n     Smith visits Pamaunkee--Seizes Opechancanough--Goes back to\r\n     Werowocomoco--Procures Supplies--Returns to Jamestown--Smith's\r\n     Rencontre with Chief of Paspahegh--Fort built--\"The Old Stone\r\n     House\"--Colonists dispersed to procure Subsistence--\r\n     Tuckahoe-root--Smith's Discipline--New Charter--Lord Delaware\r\n     appointed Governor--Fleet dispatched for Virginia--Sea-Venture;\r\n     cast away on Island of Bermuda--Seven Vessels reach Virginia--\r\n     Disorders that ensued--Smith's Efforts to quell them--He\r\n     Embarks for England--His Character, Life, and Writings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH and his party had no sooner set sail from Werowocomoco, up the\r\nriver, than Powhatan returned, and dispatched two of the Dutchmen to\r\nJamestown. The two emissaries, by false pretences and the assistance of\r\nsome of the colonists, who confederated with them, succeeded in\r\nprocuring a supply of arms and ammunition, which were conveyed to\r\nPowhatan by some of his people who were at hand for that purpose. In the\r\nmean time the other Dutchman, who had been retained by Powhatan as a\r\nhostage, provided him with three hundred stone tomahawks. Edward Boynton\r\nand Thomas Savage, discovering the treachery, attempted to make their\r\nescape back to Jamestown, but were apprehended and taken back, and\r\nexpected every moment to be put to death.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval, Smith having arrived at Pamunkey, at the junction\r\nof the Pamunkey and the Matapony, landed with Lieutenant Percy and\r\nothers, to the number of fifteen, and proceeded to Opechancanough's\r\nresidence, a quarter of a mile back from the river. The town was found\r\ndeserted by all, except a lame man and a boy, and the cabins stripped of\r\neverything. In a short time the chief of the warlike Pamunkies returned,\r\naccompanied by some of his people, armed with bows and arrows. After\r\nsome conference, Smith finding himself deceived as to the supply of corn\r\nwhich had been promised, reproached the chief for his treachery.\r\nOpechancanough, to veil his designs, agreed to sell what scanty\r\ncommodities he then had, at Smith's own price, and promised to bring on\r\nthe morrow a larger supply. On the next day Smith, with the same party,\r\nmarched again up to Opechancanough's residence, where they found four or\r\nfive Indians, who had just arrived, each carrying a large basket. Soon\r\nafter the chief made his appearance, and with an air of frankness began\r\nto tell what pains he had been at to fulfil his promise, when Mr. Russel\r\nbrought word that several hundred of the Indians had surrounded the\r\nhouse where the English were. Smith, perceiving that some of his party\r\nwere terrified, exhorted them \"to fight like men and not die like\r\nsheep.\" Reproaching Opechancanough for his murderous designs, he\r\nchallenged him to decide the dispute in single combat on a neighboring\r\nisland. The wily chief declining that mode of settlement, endeavored to\r\ninveigle Smith into an ambuscade, when his treachery being manifest, the\r\npresident seized him by the forelock, and with a cocked pistol at his\r\nbreast, led him, trembling, in the midst of his own people. Overcome\r\nwith terror, Opechancanough surrendered his vambrace, bow, and arrows;\r\nand his dismayed followers threw down their arms. Men, women, and\r\nchildren, now brought in their commodities to trade with the English.\r\nSmith, overcome with fatigue, retired into a cabin to rest; and while he\r\nwas asleep, a party of the Indians, armed with swords and tomahawks,\r\nmade an attempt to surprise him, but starting up at the noise, he, with\r\nthe help of some of his comrades, soon put the intruders to flight.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Scrivener, misled by letters received from England,\r\nbegan to grow ambitious of supplanting Smith, who was cordially attached\r\nto him; and setting out from Jamestown for Hog Island, on a stormy day,\r\nin company of Captain Waldo, Anthony Gosnold, and eight others, the boat\r\nwas sunk and all were lost. When no one else could be found willing to\r\nconvey this intelligence to Smith, Richard Wyffin volunteered to\r\nundertake it. At Werowocomoco he was shielded from danger by Pocahontas,\r\nwho, in every emergency, still proved herself the tutelary angel of the\r\ncolony. Wyffin having overtaken Smith at Pamunkey, he concealed the news\r\nof the recent disaster from his party, and, releasing Opechancanough,\r\nreturned down the river. On the following morning, a little after\r\nsunrise, the bank of the river swarmed with Indians, unarmed, carrying\r\nbaskets, to tempt Smith ashore, under pretence of trade. Smith, landing\r\nwith Percy and two others, was received by Powhatan at the head of two\r\nor three hundred warriors formed in two crescents; some twenty men and a\r\nnumber of women carrying painted baskets. Smith attempted to inveigle\r\nPowhatan into an ambuscade, but the savages, on a nearer approach,\r\ndiscovering the English with arms in their hands, fled. However, the\r\nnatives, some days afterwards, from all parts of the country, within a\r\ncircuit of ten or twelve miles, in the snow brought, on their naked\r\nbacks, corn for Smith's party.\r\n\r\nSmith next went up the Youghtanund (now Pamunkey) and the Matapony. On\r\nthe banks of this little river the poor Indians gave up their scanty\r\nstore of corn with such tears and lamentations of women and children as\r\ntouched the hearts of the English with compassion.[72:A]\r\n\r\nReturning, he descended the York as far as Werowocomoco, intending to\r\nsurprise Powhatan there, and thus secure a further supply of corn; but\r\nPowhatan had abandoned his new house, and had carried away all his corn\r\nand provisions; and Smith, with his party, returned to Jamestown. In\r\nthis expedition, with twenty-five pounds of copper and fifty pounds of\r\niron, and some beads, he procured, in exchange, two hundred pounds of\r\ndeer suet, and delivered to the Cape-merchant four hundred and\r\nseventy-nine bushels of corn.\r\n\r\nAt Jamestown the provision of the public store had been spoiled by\r\nexposure to the rain of the previous summer, or eaten by rats and worms.\r\nThe colonists had been living there in indolence, and a large part of\r\ntheir implements and arms had been trafficked away to the Indians. Smith\r\nundertook to remedy these disorders by discipline and labor, relieved by\r\npastimes and recreations; and he established it as a rule, that he who\r\nwould not work, should not eat. The whole government of the colony was\r\nnow, in effect, devolved upon him--Captain Wynne being the only other\r\nsurviving councillor, and the president having two votes. Shortly after\r\nSmith's return, he met the Chief of Paspahegh near Jamestown, and had a\r\nrencontre with him. This athletic savage attempting to shoot him, he\r\nclosed and grappled, when, by main strength, the chief forced him into\r\nthe river to drown him. They struggled long in the water, until Smith,\r\ngrasping the savage by the throat, well-nigh strangled him, and, drawing\r\nhis sword, was about to cut off his head, when he begged for his life so\r\npiteously that Smith spared him, and led him prisoner to Jamestown,\r\nwhere he put him in chains. He was daily visited by his wives, and\r\nchildren, and people, who brought presents to ransom him. At last he\r\nmade his escape. Captain Wynne and Lieutenant Percy were dispatched,\r\nwith a party of fifty, to recapture him, failing in which they burned\r\nthe chief's cabin, and carried away his canoes. Smith now going out to\r\n\"try his conclusions\" with \"the salvages,\" slew some, and made some\r\nprisoners, burned their cabins, and took their canoes and fishing weirs.\r\nShortly afterwards the president, passing through Paspahegh, on his way\r\nto the Chickahominy, was assaulted by the Indians; but, upon his firing,\r\nand their discovering who he was, they threw down their arms, and sued\r\nfor peace. Okaning, a young warrior, who spoke in their behalf, in\r\njustifying the escape of their chief from imprisonment at Jamestown,\r\nsaid: \"The fishes swim, the fowls fly, and the very beasts strive to\r\nescape the snare, and live.\" Smith's vigorous measures, together with\r\nsome accidental circumstances, dismayed the savages, that from this time\r\nto the end of his administration, they gave no further trouble.\r\n\r\nA block-house was now built in the neck of the Jamestown Peninsula; and\r\nit was guarded by a garrison, who alone were authorized to trade with\r\nthe Indians; and neither Indians nor whites were suffered to pass in or\r\nout without the president's leave. Thirty or forty acres of land were\r\nplanted with corn; twenty additional houses were built; the hogs were\r\nkept at Hog Island, and increased rapidly; and poultry was raised\r\nwithout the necessity of feeding. A block-house was garrisoned at Hog\r\nIsland for the purpose of telegraphing shipping arrived in the river.\r\nCaptain Wynne, sole surviving councillor, dying, the whole government\r\ndevolved upon Smith. He built a fort, as a place of refuge in case of\r\nbeing compelled to retreat from Jamestown, on a convenient river, upon a\r\nhigh commanding hill, very hard to be assaulted, and easy of defence.\r\nBut the scarcity of provisions prevented its completion.[74:A] This is,\r\nno doubt, the diminutive structure known as \"the Old Stone House,\" in\r\nJames City County, on Ware Creek, a tributary of York River. It stands\r\nabout five miles from the mouth of the creek, and twenty-two from\r\nJamestown. It is built of sandstone found on the bank of the creek, and\r\nwithout mortar. The walls and chimney still remain. This miniature\r\nfortress is eighteen and a half feet by fifteen in size, and consists of\r\na basement under ground, and one story above. On one side is a doorway,\r\nsix feet wide, giving entrance to both apartments. The walls are pierced\r\nwith loop-holes, and the masonry is exact. This little fort stands in a\r\nwilderness, on a high, steep bluff, at the foot of which Ware Creek\r\nmeanders. The Old Stone House is approached only by a long, narrow\r\nridge, surrounded by gloomy forests and dark ravines overgrown with ivy.\r\nIt is the oldest house in Virginia; and its age and sequestered\r\nsituation have connected with it fanciful stories of Smith and\r\nPocahontas, and the hidden treasures of the pirate Blackbeard.\r\n\r\nThe store of provisions at Jamestown was so wasted by rats, introduced\r\nby the vessels, that all the works of the colonists were brought to an\r\nend, and they were employed only in procuring food. Two Indians that had\r\nbeen some time before captured by Smith, had been until the present time\r\nkept fettered prisoners, but made to perform double tasks, and to\r\ninstruct the settlers in the cultivation of corn. The prisoners were\r\nreleased for want of provision, but were so well satisfied as to remain.\r\nFor upwards of two weeks the Indians from the surrounding country\r\nsupplied the colony daily with squirrels, turkeys, deer, and other game,\r\nwhile the rivers afforded an abundance of wild-fowl. Smith also bought\r\nfrom Powhatan half of his stock of corn. But, nevertheless, it was found\r\nnecessary to distribute the settlers in different parts of the country\r\nto procure subsistence. Sergeant Laxon, with sixty or eighty of them,\r\nwas sent down the river to live upon oysters; Lieutenant Percy with\r\ntwenty, to find fish at Point Comfort; West, brother of Lord Delaware,\r\nwith an equal number, repaired to the falls, where, however, nothing\r\nedible was found but a few acorns. Hitherto the whole body of the\r\ncolonists had been provided for by the courage and industry of some\r\nthirty or forty.\r\n\r\nThe main article of their diet was, for a time, sturgeon, an abundant\r\nsupply of which was procured during the season. It not only served for\r\nmeat, but when dried and pounded, and mixed with herbs, supplied the\r\nplace of bread. Of the spontaneous productions of the soil, the\r\nprincipal article of sustenance was the tuckahoe-root, of which one man\r\ncould gather enough in a day to supply him with bread for a week. The\r\ntockawhoughe, as it is called by Smith, was, in the summer, a principal\r\narticle of diet among the natives. It grows in marshes like a flag, and\r\nresembles, somewhat, the potato in size and flavor. Raw it is no better\r\nthan poison, so that the Indians were accustomed to roast it, and eat it\r\nmixed with sorel and corn-meal.[75:A] There is another root found in\r\nVirginia called tuckahoe, and confounded with the flag-like root\r\ndescribed above, and erroneously supposed by many to grow without stem\r\nor leaf. It appears to be of the convolvulus species, and is entirely\r\nunlike the root eaten by the Jamestown settlers.[75:B]\r\n\r\nSuch was the indolence of the greater number of the colonists, that it\r\nseemed as if they would sooner starve than take the trouble of procuring\r\nfood; and at length their mutinous discontents arose to such a pitch\r\nthat Smith arrested the ringleader of the malecontents, and ordered that\r\nwhoever failed to provide daily as much food as he should consume,\r\nshould be banished from Jamestown as a drone. Of the two hundred\r\nsettlers, many were billeted among the Indians, and thus became familiar\r\nwith their habits and manner of life.\r\n\r\nSicklemore, who had been dispatched to Chowanock, returned, after a\r\nfruitless search for Sir Walter Raleigh's people. He found the Chowan\r\nRiver not large; the country generally overgrown with pines; pemminaw,\r\nor silk-grass growing here and there. Two other messengers, sent to the\r\ncountry of the Mangoags in quest of the lost settlers, learned that they\r\nwere all dead. Guides had been supplied by the hospitable chief of the\r\nQuiyoughcohannocks to convoy the messengers. This chief was of all\r\nothers most friendly to the whites; although a superstitious worshipper\r\nof his own gods, yet he acknowledged that they were as inferior to the\r\nEnglish God in power as the bow and arrow were inferior to the English\r\ngun; and he often sent presents to Smith, begging him \"to pray to the\r\nEnglish God for rain, else his corn would perish, for his gods were\r\nangry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Company in England, mainly intent on pecuniary gain and\r\nquick returns, were discouraged by the disasters that had befallen the\r\ncolony, and disappointed in their visionary hopes of the discovery of\r\ngold mines, and of a passage to the South Sea. They therefore took\r\nmeasures to procure from King James a new charter, abrogating the\r\nexisting one, and investing them with ampler powers. Having associated\r\nwith themselves a numerous body of additional stockholders, or\r\nadventurers, as they were then styled, including many persons of rank,\r\nand wealth, and influence, they succeeded in obtaining from the king a\r\nnew charter, dated May 23d, 1609, transferring to the Company several\r\nimportant powers before reserved to the crown. By this charter the\r\nextent of Virginia was much enlarged, the eastern boundary being a line\r\nextending two hundred miles north of Point Comfort, and two hundred\r\nmiles south of it, the northern and southern boundaries being parallels\r\ndrawn through the extremities of the eastern boundary back to the South\r\nSea or Pacific--the western boundary being the Pacific.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of the new charter the Virginia Company became indeed\r\napparently more independent and republican, but under the new system the\r\ngovernor of the colony was indued with arbitrary power, and authorized\r\nto declare martial-law; and the condition of the colonists became even\r\nworse than before. This sudden repeal of the former charter evinced an\r\ningratitude for the services of Smith and his associates, who, under\r\nit, had endured the toil, and privations, and dangers of the first\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Council in England, now chosen by the stockholders\r\nthemselves, appointed Sir Thomas West, Lord Delaware, Governor and\r\nCaptain-General of Virginia. He was the third Lord Delaware, and the\r\npresent (1843) Earl Delaware, John George West, is his lineal\r\ndescendant. Sir Thomas Gates was appointed Lieutenant-Governor, and Sir\r\nGeorge Somers, Admiral. Sir George was a member of Parliament, but upon\r\nbeing appointed to a colonial post his seat was declared vacant.\r\n\r\nNine vessels were speedily fitted out, with supplies of men and women,\r\nfive hundred in number, and provisions and other stores for the colony.\r\nNewport, who was entrusted with the command of the fleet, and Gates and\r\nSomers, were each severally authorized, whichever might happen first\r\nto reach Jamestown, to supersede the existing administration there\r\nuntil the arrival of Lord Delaware, who was not to embark for several\r\nmonths, and who did not reach Virginia until the lapse of more than a\r\nyear. This abundant caution defeated itself, for Newport, and the\r\nlieutenant-governor, and the admiral, finding it impossible to adjust\r\nthe point of precedence among themselves, embarked together by way of\r\ncompromise, in the same vessel, the Sea-Venture.[77:A]\r\n\r\nThe expedition sailed from Plymouth toward the end of May, 1609, and\r\ngoing, contrary to instructions, by the old circuitous route, via the\r\nCanaries and the West Indies, late in July, when in latitude thirty\r\ndegrees north, and, as was supposed, within eight days' sail of\r\nVirginia, they were caught \"in the tail of a hurricane,\" blowing from\r\nthe northeast, accompanied by an appalling darkness, that continued for\r\nforty-four hours. Some of the vessels lost their masts, some their sails\r\nblown from the yards, the sea breaking over the ships.\r\n\r\n     \"When rattling thunder ran along the clouds,\r\n      Did not the sailors poor and masters proud\r\n      A terror feel, as struck with fear of God?\"[78:A]\r\n\r\nA small vessel was lost, July twenty-fourth, and the Sea-Venture, with\r\nNewport, Gates, Somers, and one hundred and fifty settlers, destined for\r\nVirginia, was separated from the other vessels of the expedition. The\r\nother vessels, shattered by the storm, and having suffered the loss of\r\nthe greater portion of their supplies, and many of their number by\r\nsickness, at length reached Jamestown in August, 1609. They brought back\r\nRatcliffe, or Sicklemore, who had been remanded to England on account of\r\nhis mutinous conduct, also Martin and Archer, together with sundry other\r\ncaptains, and divers gentlemen of good means and high birth, and about\r\nthree hundred settlers, the greater part of them profligate youths,\r\npacked off from home to escape ill destinies, broken-down gentlemen,\r\nbankrupt tradesmen, and the like, \"decayed tapsters, and ostlers\r\ntrade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and long peace.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the appearance of this fleet near Jamestown, Smith, not expecting\r\nsuch a supply, took them to be Spaniards, and prepared to encounter\r\nthem, and the Indians readily offered their assistance. The colony had\r\nalready, before the arrival of the fleet, been threatened with anarchy,\r\nowing to intelligence of the premature repeal of the charter, brought\r\nout by Captain Argall, and the new settlers had now no sooner landed\r\nthan they gave rise to new confusion and disorder. The factious leaders,\r\nalthough they brought no commission with them, insisted on the\r\nabrogation of the existing charter, rejected the authority of Smith,\r\nwhom they hated and feared, and undertook to usurp the government. Their\r\ncapricious folly equalled their insolence; to-day the old commission\r\nmust rule, to-morrow the new, the next day neither--thus, by continual\r\nchange, plunging all things into anarchy.\r\n\r\nSmith, filled with disgust, would cheerfully have embarked for England,\r\nbut seeing little prospect of the arrival of the new commission, (which\r\nwas in the possession of Gates on the Island of Bermudas,) he resolved\r\nto put an end to these incessant plots and machinations. The\r\nringleaders, Ratcliffe, Archer, and others, he arrested; to cut off\r\nanother source of disturbance, he gave permission to Percy, who was in\r\nfeeble health, to embark for England, of which, however, he did not\r\navail himself. West, with one hundred and twenty picked men, was\r\ndetached to the falls of James River, and Martin, with nearly the same\r\nnumber, to Nansemond. Smith's presidency having expired about this time,\r\nhe had been succeeded by Martin, who, conscious of his incompetency, had\r\nimmediately resigned it to Smith. Martin, at Nansemond, seized the\r\nchief, and, capturing the town, occupied it with his detachment; but\r\nowing to want of judgment, or of vigilance, he suffered himself to be\r\nsurprised by the savages, who slew many of his party, rescued the chief,\r\nand carried off their corn. Martin not long after returned to Jamestown,\r\nleaving his detachment to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nSmith going up the river to West's settlement at the falls, found the\r\nEnglish planted in a place not only subject to the river's inundation,\r\nbut \"surrounded by many intolerable inconveniences.\" To remedy these, by\r\na messenger he proposed to purchase from Powhatan his seat of that name,\r\na little lower down the river. The settlers scornfully rejected the\r\nscheme, and became so mutinous that Smith landed among them and arrested\r\nthe chief malcontents. But overpowered by numbers, being supported by\r\nonly five men, he was forced to retire on board of a vessel lying in the\r\nriver. The Indians daily supplied him with provisions, in requital for\r\nwhich the English plundered their corn, robbed their cultivated ground,\r\nbeat them, broke into their cabins, and made them prisoners. They\r\ncomplained to Captain Smith that the men whom he had sent there as their\r\nprotectors, \"were worse than their old enemies, the Monacans.\" Smith\r\nembarking, had no sooner set sail for Jamestown than many of West's\r\nparty were slain by the savages.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, that before Smith's vessel had dropped a mile and a half\r\ndown the river, she ran aground, whereupon, making a virtue of\r\nnecessity, he summoned the mutineers to a parley, and they, now seized\r\nwith a panic, on account of the assault of a mere handful of Indians,\r\nsubmitted themselves to his mercy. He again arrested the ringleaders,\r\nand established the rest of the party at Powhatan, in the Indian\r\npalisade fort, which was so well fortified by poles and bark as to defy\r\nall the savages in Virginia. Dry cabins were also found there, and\r\nnearly two hundred acres of ground ready to be planted, and it was\r\ncalled Nonsuch, as being at once the strongest and most delightful place\r\nin the country. Nonsuch was the name of a royal residence in England.\r\n\r\nWhen Smith was now on the eve of his departure, the arrival of West\r\nagain threw all things aback into confusion. Nonsuch was abandoned, and\r\nall hands returned to the falls, and Smith, finding all his efforts\r\nabortive, embarked in a boat for Jamestown. During the voyage he was\r\nterribly wounded while asleep, by the accidental explosion of a bag of\r\ngunpowder, and in the paroxysm of pain he leapt into the river, and was\r\nwell-nigh drowned before his companions could rescue him. Arriving at\r\nJamestown in this helpless condition, he was again assailed by faction\r\nand mutiny, and one of his enemies even presented a cocked pistol at him\r\nin his bed; but the hand wanted the nerve to execute what the heart was\r\nbase enough to design.\r\n\r\nRatcliffe, Archer, and their confederates, laid plans to usurp the\r\ngovernment of the colony, whereupon Smith's faithful soldiers, fired\r\nwith indignation at conduct so infamous, begged for permission to strike\r\noff their heads; but this he refused. He refused also to surrender the\r\npresidency to Percy. For this, Smith is censured by the historian Stith,\r\nwho yet acknowledges that Percy was in too feeble health to control a\r\nmutinous colony. Anarchy being triumphant, Smith probably deemed it\r\nuseless to appoint a governor over a mob. He at last, about Michaelmas,\r\n1609, embarked for England, after a stay of a little more than two years\r\nin Virginia,[80:A] to which he never returned.\r\n\r\nHere, then, closes the career of Captain John Smith in Virginia, \"the\r\nfather of the colony,\" and a hero like Bayard, \"without fear and without\r\nreproach.\" One of his comrades, in deploring his departure, describes\r\nhim as one who, in all his actions, made justice and prudence his\r\nguides, abhorring baseness, idleness, pride, and injustice; that in no\r\ndanger would he send others where he would not lead them himself; that\r\nwould never see his men want what he had, or could by any means procure;\r\nthat would rather want than borrow, and rather starve than not pay; that\r\nloved action more than words, and hated falsehood and avarice worse than\r\ndeath; \"whose adventures were our lives, and whose loss our deaths.\"\r\nAnother of his soldiers said of him:--\r\n\r\n     \"I never knew a warrior but thee,\r\n      From wine, tobacco, debts, dice, oaths, so free.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Smith's departure from Virginia to the year 1614,\r\nlittle is known of him. In that year he made his first voyage to New\r\nEngland. In the following year, after many disappointments, sailing\r\nagain in a small vessel for that country, after a running fight with,\r\nand narrow escape from, two French privateers, near Fayal, he was\r\ncaptured, near Flores, by a half-piratical French squadron. After long\r\ndetention he was carried to Rochelle, in France, and there charged with\r\nhaving burned Port Royal, in New France, which act had been committed by\r\nCaptain Argall. Smith, at length, at the utmost hazard, escaped from his\r\ncaptors, and being assisted by several of the inhabitants of Rochelle,\r\nespecially by Madame Chanoyes, he was enabled to return to England. The\r\nprotective sympathy exhibited toward him, at several critical\r\nconjunctures, is thus mentioned in some complimentary verses prefixed to\r\nhis History of Virginia:--\r\n\r\n     \"Tragabigzanda, Callamata's love,\r\n      Deare Pocahontas, Madam Shanoi's too,\r\n      Who did what love with modesty could do.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1616 Smith published his \"Description of New England,\" composed while\r\nhe was a prisoner on board of the French piratical vessel, in order, as\r\nhe says, to keep his perplexed thoughts from too much meditation on his\r\nmiserable condition. The Plymouth Company now conferred upon him the\r\ntitle of Admiral of New England. It was during this year that Pocahontas\r\nvisited England. After this time, Smith never again visited America.\r\nWhen, in 1622, the news of the massacre reached England, he proposed to\r\ncome over to Virginia with a proper force to reduce the savages to\r\nsubjection, but his proposal was not accepted. Captain Smith received\r\nlittle or no recompense for his colonial discoveries, labors, and\r\nsacrifices; and after having spent five years, and more than five\r\nhundred pounds, in the service of Virginia and New England, he complains\r\nthat in neither of those countries has he one foot of land, nor even the\r\nhouse that he built, nor the ground that he cultivated with his own\r\nhands, nor even any content or satisfaction at all, while he beheld\r\nthose countries bestowed upon men who neither could have them, nor even\r\nknow of them but by his descriptions. It is remarkable that in his\r\n\"Newes from Virginia,\" published in 1608, no allusion is made to his\r\nrescue by Pocahontas. In 1612 appeared his work entitled \"A Map of\r\nVirginia, with a Description of the Country, Commodities, People,\r\nGovernment, and Religion, etc.,\" and in 1620, \"New England Trials.\" In\r\n1626 was published his \"General History of Virginia, New England, and\r\nthe Summer Isles,\" the greater part of which had already been published\r\nin 1625, by Purchas, in his \"Pilgrim.\" The second and sixth books of\r\nthis history were composed by Smith himself; the third was compiled by\r\nRev. William Simons, Doctor of Divinity, and the rest by Smith from the\r\nletters and journals of about thirty different writers. During the year\r\n1625 he published \"An Accidence, or the Pathway to Experience necessary\r\nfor all young Seamen,\" and in 1627 \"A Sea Grammar.\" In 1630 he gave to\r\nthe public \"The True Travels, Adventures, and Observations of Captain\r\nJohn Smith, in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, from 1593 to 1629.\"\r\nThis work, together with \"The General History,\" was republished by Rev.\r\nDr. John H. Rice, in 1819, at Richmond, Virginia. The copy is exact and\r\ncomplete, except some maps and engravings of but little value. The\r\nobsolete orthography and typography of the work confines it to a limited\r\ncircle of readers. It is now out of print and rare. In 1631 Smith\r\npublished \"Advertisements for the unexperienced planters of New England,\r\nor anywhere,\" etc., said to be the most elaborate of his productions.\r\nThe learned, judicious, and accurate historian, Grahame, considers\r\nSmith's writings on colonization, superior to those of Lord Bacon. At\r\nthe time of his death, Smith was engaged in composing a \"History of the\r\nSea.\" So famous was he in his own day, that he complains of some\r\nextraordinary incidents in his life having been _mis_represented on the\r\nstage. He was gifted by nature with a person and address of singular\r\nfascination. He married, and the author of a recent interesting English\r\nbook of travels, a lineal descendant, refers with just pride to his\r\ndistinguished ancestor: \"On the upper waters of the Alt, near the\r\ncelebrated Rothen Thurm, (or Red Tower,) several severe engagements\r\nushered in the seventeenth century. It was at this time that the wave of\r\nMohammedan conquest rolled on, and broke over Hungary, Transylvania, and\r\nWallachia, and, whether advancing or retiring, swept those unfortunate\r\nlands with equal severity. Sigismund Bathori, after holding his own for\r\nawhile in Transylvania against the emperor, was obliged to succumb; the\r\nVoyvode of Wallachia, appointed by the Porte, aroused, by his cruelties,\r\nan insurrection against him, and the moment appeared favorable for\r\nthrusting back the Turkish power beyond the Danube. The Austrian party\r\nnot only appointed a new Voyvode, but marched a large army, chiefly\r\nHungarian, into the country, and were at first victorious, in a\r\nwell-contested battle. But, at length, between the river and the heights\r\nof the Rothen Thurm range, the Christian army was attacked with\r\nimpetuosity by a far greater number, composed principally of Tartars,\r\nand was entirely cut to pieces. In this catastrophe several English\r\nofficers, serving with the Hungarian army, were slain; and _an ancestor\r\nof the author's_, who was left for dead on the field, after describing\r\nthis 'dismall battell,' gives their names, and observes that 'they did\r\nwhat men could do, and when they could do no more, left there their\r\nbodies in testimony of their mind.'\"[83:A]\r\n\r\nCaptain John Smith died at London, 1631, in the fifty-second year of his\r\nage. He was buried in St. Sepulchre's Church, Skinner Street, London;\r\nand from Stowe's Survey of London, printed in 1633, it appears there was\r\na tablet erected to his memory in that church, inscribed with his motto,\r\n\"Vincere est vivere,\" and the following epitaph:--\r\n\r\n     Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\r\n     Subdued large territories, and done things\r\n     Which, to the world, impossible would seem,\r\n     But that the truth is held in more esteem.\r\n     Shall I report his former service done\r\n     In honor of God and Christendom,\r\n     How that he did divide from pagans three\r\n     Their heads and lives, types of his chivalry;\r\n     For which great service, in that climate done,\r\n     Brave Sigismundus, (King of Hungarion,)\r\n     Did give him a coat of arms to wear,\r\n     Those conquered heads got by his sword and spear?\r\n     Or shall I tell of his adventures since\r\n     Done in Virginia, that large continent,\r\n     How that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\r\n     And made those heathens fly as wind doth smoke,\r\n     And made their land, being of so large a station,\r\n     A habitation for our Christian nation,\r\n     Where God is glorified, their wants supplied,\r\n     Which else for necessaries might have died?\r\n     But what avails his conquest? now he lies\r\n     Interred in earth, a prey for worms and flies.\r\n     O may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep\r\n     Until the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\r\n     Return to judgment, and that after thence\r\n     With angels he may have his recompense.\r\n\r\nThe tablet was destroyed by the great fire in the year 1666, and all now\r\nremaining to the memory of Captain Smith is a large flat stone, in front\r\nof the communion-table, engraved with his coat of arms, upon which the\r\nthree Turks' heads are still distinguishable.[84:A] The historian\r\nGrahame concludes a notice of him in these words: \"But Smith's renown\r\nwill break forth again, and once more be commensurate with his desert.\r\nIt will grow with the growth of men and letters in America, and whole\r\nnations of its admirers have yet to be born.\" A complete edition of his\r\nworks would be a valuable addition to American historical literature.\r\nThe sculptor's art ought to present a fitting memorial of him and of\r\nPocahontas, in the metropolis of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72:A] The word Matapony is said to signify \"no bread at all.\" The four\r\nconfluents of this river, on modern maps, are whimsically named Ma, Ta,\r\nPo, and Ny, being the four component syllables of the word. Captain\r\nSmith calls it the Matapanient.\r\n\r\n[74:A] Smith, i. 227.\r\n\r\n[75:A] Smith, i. 123; Beverley's Hist. of Va., iii. 15.

These heir-looms of dim, oblivious centuries, seem to\r\nwhisper mysteriously of a shadowy race, populous, nomadic, not\r\naltogether uncivilized, idolatrous, worshipping \"in high places.\" The\r\nAnglo-Saxon ploughshare is busy in obliterating these memorials, but\r\nmany yet survive, and many, perhaps, remain yet to be discovered.\r\nWhether they were the work of the progenitors of the Indians, or of a\r\nrace long since extinct, is a question for such as have taste and\r\nleisure for such abstruse inquiries. The general absence of written\r\nlanguage and of architectural remains, indicates a low grade of\r\ncivilization, and yet the relics that have been disinterred, and the\r\nenormous extent of some of their earth-works, would argue a degree of\r\nart, and of collective industry, to which the Indians are entire\r\nstrangers. We may, at the least, conclude that either they, in the lapse\r\nof ages, have greatly degenerated, or that the mound-makers were a\r\ndistinct and superior race. Some of these mounds are found in Virginia.\r\nThe most remarkable of these is the Mammoth Mound, in the County of\r\nMarshall. Mr. Jefferson[85:A] was of opinion that there is nothing\r\nextant in Virginia deserving the name of an Indian monument, as he would\r\nnot dignify with that name their stone arrow-points, tomahawks, pipes,\r\nand rude images. Of labor on a large scale there is no remain, unless it\r\nbe the barrows, or mounds, of which many are found all over this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThey are of different sizes; some of them constructed of earth, and\r\nsome of loose stones. That they were repositories of the dead is\r\nobvious, but on what occasion they were constructed is a matter of\r\ndoubt. Mr. Jefferson opened one of them near Monticello, and found it\r\nfilled with human bones. The Mammoth Mound in Marshall County is 69 feet\r\nhigh, 900 in circumference at the base; in shape the frustrum of a cone,\r\nwith a flat top 50 feet in diameter. An oak standing on the top has been\r\nestimated to be five hundred years old. In the interior have been\r\ndiscovered vaults, with pieces of timber, human skeletons, ivory beads,\r\nand other ivory ornaments, sea-shells, copper bracelets around the\r\nwrists of skeletons, with laminated mica, and a stone with hieroglyphic\r\ncharacters inscribed on it, in the opinion of some, of African origin.\r\nThe whole mass of the mound is studded with blue spots, supposed to have\r\nbeen occasioned by deposites of the remains of human bodies consumed by\r\nfire. Seven lesser mounds are connected with the main one by low\r\nentrenchments. Some rude towers of stone, greatly dilapidated, are also\r\nfound in the neighborhood. Porcelain beads are picked up, and a stone\r\nidol has been found, as also tubes of lead, blue steatite, syphon-like,\r\ndrilled, twelve inches long, and finely polished.\r\n\r\nThe places of habitation of the Indians may yet be identified along the\r\nbanks of rivers, by the deposites of shells of oysters and muscles,\r\nwhich they subsisted upon, as also of ashes and charred wood,\r\narrow-points, fragments of pottery, pipes, tomahawks, mortars, etc.\r\nVestiges may be traced of their moving back their cabins when urged by\r\nthe accumulation of shells and ashes. Standing on such a spot one's\r\nfancy may almost repeople it with the shadowy forms of the aborigines,\r\nand imagine the flames of the council-fire projecting its red glare upon\r\nthe face of the York or the James, and hear their wild cries mingling\r\nwith the dash of waves and the roar of the forest. Here they rejoice\r\nover their victories, plan new enterprises of blood, and celebrate the\r\nwar-dance by the rude music of the drum and the rattle, commingled with\r\ntheir own discordant yells.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Virginia were tall, erect, and well-proportioned, with\r\nprominent cheek-bones; eyes dark and brilliant, with an animal\r\nexpression, and a sort of squint; their hair dark and straight. The\r\nchiefs were distinguished by a long pendant lock. The Indians had little\r\nor no beard, and the women served as barbers, eradicating the beard, and\r\ngrating away the hair with two shells. Like all savages, they were fond\r\nof toys and tawdry ornaments. The principal garment was a mantle, in\r\nwinter dressed with the fur in, in summer with it out; but the common\r\nsort had scarce anything to hide their nakedness, save grass or leaves,\r\nand in summer they all went nearly naked. The females always wore a\r\ncincture around the middle. Some covered themselves with a mantle of\r\ncuriously interwoven turkey feathers, pretty and comfortable. The\r\ngreater part went barefoot; some wore moccasins, a rude sandal of\r\nbuckskin. Some of the women tattooed their skins with grotesque figures.\r\nThey adorned the ear with pendants of copper, or a small living snake,\r\nyellow or green, or a dead rat, and the head with a bird's wing, a\r\nfeather, the rattle of a rattlesnake, or the hand of an enemy. They\r\nstained the head and shoulder red with the juice of the puccoon.\r\n\r\nThe red men dwelt for the most part on the banks of rivers. They spent\r\nthe time in fishing, hunting, war, or indolence, despising domestic\r\nlabor, and assigning it to the women. These made mats, baskets, pottery,\r\nhollowed out stone-mortars, pounded the corn in them, made bread,\r\ncooked, planted corn, gathered it, carried burdens, etc. Infants were\r\ninured to hardship and exposure. The Indians kindled a fire quickly \"by\r\nchafing a dry pointed stick in a hole of a little square piece of wood,\r\nwhich, taking fire, sets fire to moss, leaves, or any such dry thing.\"\r\nThey subsisted upon fish, game, the natural fruits of the earth, and\r\ncorn, which they planted. The tuckahoe-root, during the summer, was an\r\nimportant article of diet in marshy places. Their cookery was not less\r\nrude than their other habits, yet _pone_ and _hominy_ have been borrowed\r\nfrom them, as also, it is said, the mode of _barbecuing_ meat. _Pone_,\r\naccording to the historian Beverley, is derived \"not from the Latin\r\npanis, but from oppone,\" an Indian word; according to Smith, _ponap_\r\nsignifies meal-dumplings. The natives did not refuse to eat grubs,\r\nsnakes, and the insect locust. Their bread was sometimes made of wild\r\noats, or the seed of the sunflower, but mostly of corn. Their salt was\r\nonly such as could be procured from ashes. They were fond of roasting\r\nears of corn, and they welcomed the crop with the festival of the\r\ngreen-corn dance. From walnuts and hickory-nuts, pounded in a mortar,\r\nthey expressed a liquid called pawcohiccora. The hickory-tree is\r\nindigenous in America. Beverley has fallen into a curious mistake in\r\nsaying that the peach-tree is a native of this country. Indian-corn and\r\ntobacco, although called indigenous, appear to have grown only when\r\ncultivated. They are never found of wild spontaneous growth. In their\r\njourneys the Indians were in the habit of providing themselves with\r\nrockahominy, or corn parched and reduced to a powder.\r\n\r\nThey dwelt in towns, the cabins being constructed of saplings bent over\r\nat the top and tied together, and thatched with reeds, or covered with\r\nmats or bark, the smoke escaping through an aperture at the apex. The\r\ndoor, if any, consisted of a pendant mat. They sate on the ground, the\r\nbetter sort on matchcoats or mats. Their fortifications consisted of\r\npalisades ten or twelve feet high, sometimes encompassing an entire\r\ntown, sometimes a part. Within these enclosures they preserved, with\r\npious care, their idols and relics, and the remains of their chiefs. In\r\nhunting and war they used the bow and arrow--the bow usually of locust,\r\nthe arrow of reed, or a wand. The Indian notched his arrow with a\r\nbeaver's tooth set in a stick, which he used in the place of a file. The\r\narrow was winged with a turkey-feather, fastened with a sort of glue\r\nextracted from the velvet horns of the deer. The arrow was headed with\r\nan arrow-point of stone, often made of white quartz, and exquisitely\r\nformed, some barbed, some with a serrate edge. These are yet to be found\r\nin every part of the country. For knives the red men made use of\r\nsharpened reeds, or shells, or stone; and for hatchets, tomahawks of\r\nstone, sharpened at one end or both. Those sharpened only at one end, at\r\nthe other were either curved to a tapering point, or spheroidally\r\nrounded off, so as to serve the purpose of a hammer for breaking or\r\npounding. In the middle a circular indenture was made, to secure the\r\ntomahawk to the handle. They soon, however, procured iron hatchets from\r\nthe English. Trees the Indians felled by fire; canoes were made by dint\r\nof burning and scraping with shells and tomahawks. Some of their canoes\r\nwere not less than forty or fifty feet long. Canoe is a West Indian\r\nword, the Powhatan word is quintan, or aquintan.[89:A] The women\r\nmanufactured a thread, or string of bark, or of a kind of grass called\r\npemminaw, or of the sinews of the deer. A large pipe, adorned with the\r\nwings of a bird, or with beads, was the symbol of friendship, called the\r\npipe of peace. A war-chief was styled werowance, and a war-council,\r\nmatchacomoco. In war, like all savages, they relied mainly on surprise,\r\ntreachery, and ambuscade; in the open field they were timid; and their\r\ncruelty, as usual, was proportionate to their cowardice.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Indians were of course idolatrous, and their chief idol,\r\ncalled Okee, represented the spirit of evil, to appease whom they burnt\r\nsacrifices. They were greatly under the influence and control of their\r\npriests and conjurors, who wore a grotesque dress, performed a variety\r\nof divinations, conjurations, and enchantments, called powwowings, after\r\nthe manner of wizards, and by their superior cunning and shrewdness, and\r\nsome scanty knowledge of medicine, contrived to render themselves\r\nobjects of veneration, and to live upon the labor of others. The\r\nsuperstition of the savages was commensurate with their ignorance. Near\r\nthe falls of the James River, about a mile back from the river, there\r\nwere some impressions on a rock like the footsteps of a giant, being\r\nabout five feet apart, which the Indians averred to be the footprints of\r\ntheir god. They submitted with Spartan fortitude to cruel tortures\r\nimposed by their idolatry, especially in the mysterious and horrid\r\nordeal of huskanawing. The avowed object of this ordeal was to\r\nobliterate forever from the memory of the youths subjected to it all\r\nrecollection of their previous lives. The house in which they kept the\r\nOkee was called Quioccasan, and was surrounded by posts, with human\r\nfaces rudely carved and painted on them. Altars on which sacrifices were\r\noffered, were held in great veneration.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of the Indians were not numerous; their remedies few and\r\nsimple, their physic consisting mainly of the bark and roots of trees.\r\nSweating was a favorite remedy, and every town was provided with a\r\nsweat-house. The patient, issuing from the heated atmosphere, plunged\r\nhimself in cold water, after the manner of the Russian bath.\r\n\r\nThe Indians celebrated certain festivals by pastimes, games, and songs.\r\nThe year they divided into five seasons, Cattapeak, the budding time of\r\nspring; Messinough, roasting ear time; Cohattayough, summer; Taquitock,\r\nthe fall of the leaf; and Popanow, winter, sometimes called Cohonk,\r\nafter the cry of the migratory wild-geese. Engaged from their childhood\r\nin fishing and hunting, they became expert and familiar with the haunts\r\nof game and fish. The luggage of hunting parties was carried by the\r\nwomen. Deer were taken by surrounding them, and kindling fires enclosing\r\nthem in a circle, till they were killed; sometimes they were driven into\r\nthe water, and there captured. The Indian, hunting alone, would stalk\r\nbehind the skin of a deer. Game being abundant in the mountain country,\r\nhunting parties repaired to the heads of the rivers at the proper\r\nseason, and this probably engendered the continual hostilities that\r\nexisted between the Powhatans of the tide-water region and the Monacans,\r\non the upper waters of the James, and the Mannahoacks, at the head of\r\nthe Rappahannock. The savages were in the habit of exercising themselves\r\nin sham-fights. Upon the first discharge of arrows they burst forth in\r\nhorrid shrieks and the war-whoop, so that as many infernal hell-hounds\r\ncould not have been more terrific. \"All their actions, cries, and\r\ngestures, in charging and retreating,\" says Captain Smith, \"were so\r\nstrained to the height of their quality and nature, that the strangeness\r\nthereof made it seem very delightful.\" For their music they used a thick\r\ncane, on which they piped as on a recorder. They had also a rude sort of\r\ndrum, and rattles of gourds or pumpkins. The chastity of their women was\r\nnot held in much value, but wives were careful not to be suspected\r\nwithout the consent of their husbands.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were hospitable, in their manners exhibiting that\r\nimperturbable equanimity and uniform self-possession and repose which\r\ndistinguish the refined society of a high civilization. Extremes meet.\r\nYet the Indians were in everything wayward and inconstant, unless where\r\nrestrained by fear; cunning, quick of apprehension, and ingenious; some\r\nwere brave; most of them timorous and cautious; all savage. Not\r\nungrateful for benefits, they seldom forgave an injury. They rarely\r\nstole from each other, lest their conjurors should reveal the offence,\r\nand they should be punished.[91:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85:A] Notes on Va., 104, ed. 1853.\r\n\r\n[89:A] Strachey's Virginia Britannica.\r\n\r\n[91:A] Smith, ii. 129, 137; Beverley, B. iii.; Drake's Book of the\r\nIndians; Thatcher's Lives of the Indians; Bancroft's History of U.

Lord Bacon says: \"It is a shameful and unblessed thing to take\r\nthe scum of people, wicked, condemned men, with whom you plant; and not\r\nonly so, but it spoileth the plantation, for they will ever live like\r\nrogues, and not fall to work, but be lazy and do mischief; spend\r\nvictuals and be quickly weary.\"[92:B] Immediately upon Smith's\r\ndeparture the Indians renewed their attacks. Percy, the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland's brother, for a time administered the government; but it\r\nsoon fell into the hands of the seditious malecontents. Provisions\r\ngrowing scarce, West and Ratcliffe embarked in small vessels to procure\r\ncorn. Ratcliffe, inveigled by Powhatan, was slain with thirty of his\r\ncompanions, two only escaping, of whom one, a boy, Henry Spilman, a\r\nyoung gentleman well descended, was rescued by Pocahontas, and he\r\nafterwards lived for many years among the Patawomekes, acquired their\r\nlanguage, and often proved serviceable as an interpreter for his\r\ncountrymen. He was slain by the savages, on the banks of the Potomac, in\r\n1622. The loss of Captain Smith was soon felt by the colonists: they\r\nwere now continually exposed to the arrow and the tomahawk; the common\r\nstore was consumed by the commanders and the savages; swords and guns\r\nwere bartered with the Indians for food; and within six months after\r\nSmith's departure the number of English in Virginia was reduced from\r\nfive hundred to sixty men, women, and children. These found themselves\r\nin a starving condition, subsisting on roots, herbs, acorns, walnuts,\r\nberries, and fish. Starch became an article of diet, and even dogs,\r\ncats, rats, snakes, toadstools, and the skins of horses. The body of an\r\nIndian was disinterred and eaten; nay, at last, the colonists preyed on\r\nthe dead bodies of each other. It was even alleged that a husband\r\nmurdered his wife for a cannibal repast; upon his trial, however, it\r\nappeared that the cannibalism was feigned, to palliate the murder. He\r\nwas put to death--being burned according to law. This was long\r\nafterwards remembered as \"the starving time.\" Sir Thomas Smith,\r\ntreasurer of the Virginia Company, was bitterly denounced by the\r\nsufferers for neglecting to send out the necessary supplies. The\r\nhappiest day that many of them expected ever to see, was when the\r\nIndians had killed a mare, the people wishing, while the carcass was\r\nboiling, \"that Sir Thomas was upon her back in the kettle.\" It seemed to\r\nthem as if the Earl of Salisbury's threat of abandoning the colony to\r\nits fate, was now to be actually carried into effect; but it is to be\r\nrecollected that a large portion of ample supplies, that had been sent\r\nout from England for the colony, had been lost by storm and shipwreck.\r\n\r\nIt has before been mentioned, that toward the end of July, 1609, in a\r\nviolent tempest, the Sea-Venture, with Newport, Gates, and Somers, and\r\none hundred and fifty souls, had been separated from the rest of the\r\nfleet. Racked by the fury of the sea, she sprang a leak, and the water\r\nsoon rose in her hold above two tiers of hogsheads that stood over the\r\nballast, and the crew had to stand up to their waists in the water, and\r\nbail out with buckets, baricos, and kettles. They continued bailing and\r\npumping for three days and nights without intermission, yet the water\r\nappeared rather to gain upon them than decrease; so that all hands,\r\nbeing at length utterly exhausted, came to the desperate resolution to\r\nshut down the hatches and resign themselves to their fate; and some\r\nhaving \"good and comfortable waters fetched them, and drank to one\r\nanother as taking their last farewell.\" During all this time the aged\r\nSir George Somers, sitting upon the quarter-deck, scarce taking time to\r\neat or sleep, bearing the helm so as to keep the ship as upright as\r\npossible, but for which she must have foundered,--at last descried land.\r\nAt this time many of the unhappy crew were asleep, and when the voice of\r\nSir George was heard announcing \"land,\" it seemed as if it was a voice\r\nfrom heaven, and they hurried up above the hatches to look for what they\r\ncould scarcely credit. On finding the intelligence true, and that they\r\nwere, indeed, in sight of land,--although it was a coast that all men\r\nusually tried to avoid,--yet they now spread all sail to reach it. Soon\r\nthe ship struck upon a rock, till a surge of the sea dashed her off from\r\nthence, and so from one to another till, at length, fortunately, she\r\nlodged (July twenty-eighth) upright between two rocks, as if she was\r\nlaid up in a natural dry-dock. Till this, at every lurch they had\r\nexpected instant death; but now, all at once, the storm gave place to a\r\ncalm, and the billows, which at each successive dash had threatened\r\ndestruction, were stilled; and, quickly taking to their boats, they\r\nreached the shore, distant upwards of a league, without the loss of a\r\nsingle man out of upwards of one hundred and fifty. Their joy at an\r\nescape so unexpected and almost miraculous, arose to the pitch of\r\namazement. Yet their escape was not more wonderful in their eyes than\r\ntheir preservation after they had landed on the island; for the\r\nSpaniards had always looked upon it as more frightful than purgatory\r\nitself; and all seamen had reckoned it no better than an enchanted den\r\nof Furies and devils--the most dangerous, desolate, and forlorn place in\r\nthe whole world; instead of which it turned out to be healthful,\r\nfertile, and charming.\r\n\r\nThe Bermudas are a cluster of islands lying in the Atlantic Ocean, at\r\nthe distance of six hundred miles from the American Continent,\r\nextending, in crescent form, from east to west; in length, twenty miles;\r\nin breadth, two and a half. On the coast of the principal of these\r\nislands, Bermuda, the Sea-Venture was wrecked; and, on landing, the\r\nEnglish found, instead of those gloomy horrors with which a\r\nsuperstitious fancy had invested it, a terrestrial paradise blessed with\r\nall the charms of exquisite scenery, luxuriant vegetation, and a\r\nvoluptuous atmosphere, which have since been celebrated in the verse of\r\na modern poet. Here they remained for nearly a year. Fish, fowl, turtle,\r\nand wild hogs supplied the English with abundant food; the palmetto leaf\r\nfurnished a cover for their cabins. They had daily morning and evening\r\nprayers, and on Sunday divine service was performed and two sermons\r\npreached by the chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Bucke. He was a graduate of\r\nOxford, and received the appointment of chaplain to the Virginia\r\nexpedition upon the recommendation of Dr. Ravis, Bishop of London. Mr.\r\nBucke was the second minister sent out from England to Virginia, being\r\nsuccessor to Rev. Robert Hunt. The company of the Sea-Venture were\r\nsummoned to worship by the sound of the church-going bell, and the roll\r\nwas called, and absentees were duly punished. The clergyman performed\r\nthe ceremony of marriage once during the sojourn on the island, the\r\nparties being Sir George Somers' cook and a maid-servant, (of one Mrs.\r\nMary Horton,) named Elizabeth Persons. The communion was once\r\ncelebrated. The infant child of one John Rolfe--a daughter, born on the\r\nisland--was christened, February eleventh, by the name of Bermuda,\r\nCaptain Newport, the Rev. Mr. Bucke, and Mrs. Horton being witnesses. It\r\nwould seem from this, that John Rolfe was a widower when he afterwards\r\nmarried Pocahontas. Another infant, born on the island, a boy, was\r\nchristened by the name of Bermudas. Six of the company, including the\r\nwife of Sir Thomas Gates, died there. Living in the midst of peace and\r\nplenty in this sequestered and delightful place of abode, after escaping\r\nfrom the yawning perils of the deep, many of the English lost all desire\r\never to leave the island, and some were even mutinously determined to\r\nremain there. Gates, however, having decked the long-boat of the\r\nSea-Venture with the hatches, dispatched the mate, Master Raven, an\r\nexpert mariner, with eight men, to Virginia for succor; but the boat was\r\nnever more heard of. Discord and insubordination found a place among the\r\nexiles of the Bermudas; and even the leaders, Gates and Somers, lived\r\nfor awhile asunder. At length, while Somers was engaged in surveying the\r\nislands, Gates completed a vessel of about eighty tons, constructed\r\nsomewhat after the manner of Robinson Crusoe, partly from the timber of\r\nthe Sea-Venture, and the rest of cedar. A small bark was also built\r\nunder the direction of Sir George Somers, of cedar, without the use of\r\nany iron, save a bolt in her keel. These two vessels were named, the one\r\nthe \"Patience,\" the other the \"Deliverance.\" Finally, on the 10th day of\r\nMay, 1610, after the lapse of nine months spent on the island, and\r\nnearly a year since their departure from England, harmony being\r\nrestored, and the leaders reconciled, they embarked in these cedar\r\nvessels for Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe name of Sir Thomas West, afterwards Lord la Ware, or De la War, or\r\nDelaware, appears in the commission appointed in the year of James the\r\nFirst, for inquiring into the case of all such persons as should be\r\nfound openly opposing the doctrines of the Church of England. Such was\r\nthe spirit of that age, by which standard the men of that age ought to\r\nbe judged. Lord Delaware was, nevertheless, distinguished for his\r\nvirtues and his generous devotion to the welfare of the infant colony of\r\nVirginia--a man of approved courage, temper, and experience. The Rev.\r\nWilliam Crashaw, father of the poet of that name, at the period of Lord\r\nDelaware's appointment to the place of Governor of Virginia, was\r\npreacher at the Temple; and he delivered a sermon before his lordship,\r\nand others of his majesty's council for the Colony of Virginia, and the\r\nrest of the adventurers or stockholders in that plantation, upon\r\noccasion of his lordship's embarkation for Virginia, on the 21st day of\r\nFebruary, 1609-10. The text was from Daniel, xii. 3: \"They that turn\r\nmany to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.\" This\r\nsermon was printed by William Welby, and sold in Paul's Churchyard, at\r\nthe sign of the Swan, 1610, and is the first missionary sermon preached\r\nin England to any of her sons embarking for Virginia. Crashaw, in this\r\ndiscourse, urges it warmly upon his countrymen to aid the enterprise of\r\nplanting the colony; rejects, with indignant scorn, the more sordid\r\nmotives of mere lucre, and appeals to loftier principles, and the more\r\nelevated motives of Christian beneficence. But although he rejects\r\nmotives of mere profit, he tells his auditors that if they will pursue\r\ntheir object, animated by these enlarged views, they will probably find\r\nthe plantation eventually a source of pecuniary profit, the soil being\r\ngood, the commodities numerous and necessary for England, the distance\r\nnot great, and the voyage easy, so that God's blessing was alone wanting\r\nto make it gainful. In his peroration, the preacher, apostrophizing Lord\r\nDelaware, excites his generous emulation by a personal appeal, reminding\r\nhim of the gallant exploit of his ancestor, Sir Roger la Warr, who,\r\nassisted by John de Pelham, captured the King of France at the battle of\r\nPoictiers. In memory of which exploit, Sir Roger la Warr--Lord la Warr\r\naccording to Froissart--had the crampet or chape of his sword for a\r\nbadge of that honor. Crashaw bitterly denounces the Papists, and the\r\nBrownists, and factious separatists, and exhorts the Virginia Company\r\nnot to suffer such to have any place in the new colony. Rome and Geneva\r\nwere the Scylla and Charybdis of the Church of England.[97:A] Lord\r\nDelaware sailed in February for Virginia.\r\n\r\nGates and Somers, after leaving the Bermudas in May, in fourteen days\r\nreached Jamestown, where they found only sixty miserable colonists\r\nsurviving. Sir Thomas Gates, Lieutenant-Governor, landing on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of May, caused the church-bell to be rung; and such as\r\nwere able repaired thither, and the Rev. Mr. Bucke delivered an earnest\r\nand sorrowful prayer upon their finding so unexpectedly all things so\r\nfull of misery and misgovernment. At the conclusion of the religious\r\nservice the new commission of Gates was read; Percy, the acting\r\npresident, scarcely able to stand, surrendered up the former charter\r\nand his commission. The palisades of the fort were found torn down; the\r\nports open; the gates distorted from the hinges; the houses of those who\r\nhad died, broken up and burned for firewood, and their store of\r\nprovision exhausted. Gates reluctantly resolved to abandon the\r\nplantation, and to return to England by way of Newfoundland, where he\r\nexpected to receive succor from English fishing vessels. June seventh,\r\nthey buried their ordnance and armor at the gate of the fort, and, at\r\nthe beat of drum, embarked in four pinnaces. Some of the people were,\r\nwith difficulty, restrained from setting fire to the town; but Sir\r\nThomas Gates, with a select party, remained on shore until the others\r\nhad embarked, and he was the last man that stepped into the boat. They\r\nfired a farewell volley; but not a tear was shed at their departure from\r\na spot associated with so much misery. How often is the hour of despair\r\nbut the deeper darkness that immediately precedes the dawn! At noon they\r\nreached Hog Island, and on the next morning, while anchored off Mulberry\r\nIsland, they were met by a long-boat with dispatches from Lord Delaware,\r\nwho had arrived with three vessels, after a voyage of three months and a\r\nhalf from England.[98:A] Upon this intelligence Gates, with his company,\r\nreturned up the river to Jamestown on the same day. Lord Delaware\r\narrived there with his three vessels on the ninth, and on the morning of\r\nthe following day (Sunday) he landed at the south gate of the fort, and\r\nalthough the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Thomas Gates, with his company,\r\nwere drawn up to meet him, he fell on his knees, and remained for some\r\ntime in silent prayer. After this he repaired to the church, and heard a\r\nsermon delivered by the Rev. Mr. Bucke. A council was then called, and\r\nthe governor delivered an address to the colonists. The hand of a\r\nsuperintending and benignant Providence was plainly manifested in all\r\nthese circumstances. The arrival of Sir Thomas Gates rescued the colony\r\nfrom the jaws of famine; his prudence preserved the fort at Jamestown,\r\nwhich the unhappy colonists, upon abandoning the place, wished to\r\ndestroy, so as to cut off all possibility of a return; had their return\r\nbeen longer delayed, the savages might have destroyed the fort; had\r\nthey set sail sooner, they would probably have missed Lord Delaware's\r\nfleet, as they had intended to sail by way of Newfoundland, in a\r\ndirection contrary to that by which Lord Delaware approached.[99:A]\r\n\r\nLord Delaware, Governor and Captain-General, was accompanied by Sir\r\nFerdinand Waynman, Master of the Horse, who died shortly afterwards;\r\nCaptain Holcroft; Captain Lawson; and other gentlemen. Lord Delaware\r\nwas the first executive officer of Virginia with the title of Governor;\r\nand the titles of Governor and Captain-General were ever after given to\r\nthe colonial chief magistrates of Virginia. Under Lord Delaware's\r\ndiscreet and energetic management, discipline and industry were speedily\r\nrestored, the hours of labor being set from six o'clock in the morning\r\nto ten, and from two to four in the afternoon. The store of provisions\r\nthat he had brought over with him was sufficient to supply four hundred\r\nmen for twelve months. He gave orders for repairing the church. Its\r\nlength was sixty feet, and its breadth twenty-four, and it was to have a\r\nchancel of cedar and a communion-table of black-walnut, and the pews of\r\ncedar, with handsome wide windows, to shut and open according to the\r\nweather, made of the same wood; as also a pulpit with a font hewed out\r\nhollow like a canoe, with two bells at the west end. The building was so\r\nconstructed as to be very light within; and the Lord Governor and\r\nCaptain-General caused it to be kept passing sweet, and trimmed up with\r\ndivers flowers. There was also a sexton belonging to it. Every Sunday\r\nthere were two sermons delivered, and every Thursday one--there being\r\ntwo preachers who took their weekly turns. In the morning of every day,\r\nat the ringing of the bell at ten o'clock, the people attended prayers;\r\nand also again at four in the afternoon, before supper. On Sunday, when\r\nthe Governor went to church, he was accompanied by the councillors,\r\nofficers, and all the gentlemen, with a guard of halberdiers in his\r\nlordship's livery, handsome red cloaks, to the number of fifty on each\r\nside, and behind him. In the church his lordship had his seat in the\r\nchoir, in a green velvet chair, with a cloth, and also a velvet cushion\r\nlaid on the table before him on which he knelt. The council and officers\r\nsate on each side of him, and when he returned to his house he was\r\nescorted back in the same manner. The newly appointed council consisted\r\nof Sir Thomas Gates, whose title was changed from that of\r\nLieutenant-Governor to that of Lieutenant-General; Sir George Somers,\r\nAdmiral; Captain George Percy; Sir Ferdinando Wayman, Master of the\r\nOrdnance; Captain Newport, Vice-Admiral; and Mr. Strachey, Secretary and\r\nRecorder. Strachey, who appears to have been a scholar, published an\r\ninteresting account of the colony at this period. Some of the houses at\r\nJamestown were covered with boards; some with Indian mats. They were\r\ncomfortable, and securely protected from the savages by the forts. Lord\r\nDelaware was a generous friend of the colony; but it was as yet quite\r\ntoo poor and too much in its infancy to maintain the state suitable to\r\nhim and his splendid retinue. The fashions of a court were preposterous\r\nin a wilderness. On the ninth of June, Sir George Somers was dispatched,\r\nin compliance with his own suggestion, in his cedar vessel to the\r\nBermudas, accompanied by Argall in another vessel, to procure further\r\nsupplies for the colony. Captain Argall, in consequence of adverse winds\r\nand heavy fogs, returned to Jamestown. Sir George Somers, after much\r\ndifficulty, reached his destination, where he shortly after died, at a\r\nspot on which the town of St. George commemorates his name. The islands\r\nthemselves received the designation of his surname, and were afterwards\r\ncalled the Summer Islands. It is said that the Bermudas were at first\r\nnamed in England \"Virginiola,\" but shortly after the \"Summer Islands,\"\r\npartly in allusion to their temperature, and partly in honor of Sir\r\nGeorge.[102:A] It was remarked of him that he was \"a lamb upon land; a\r\nlion at sea.\" As his life had been divided between the Old World and\r\nthe New, so after his death his remains were buried, part at Bermuda,\r\npart at Whitchurch, Dorsetshire, in England.\r\n\r\nLord Delaware dispatched Captain Argall to the Potomac for corn, which\r\nhe succeeded in procuring by the aid of the youthful prisoner, Henry\r\nSpilman. His lordship erected two forts, called Henry and Charles, after\r\nthe king's sons. These forts were built on a level tract bordering\r\nSouthampton River, and it was intended that settlers arriving from\r\nEngland should first land there, to refresh themselves after the\r\nconfinement of the voyage. Sir Thomas Gates, who had before sent his\r\ndaughters back to England, now returned there himself, in order to\r\nrender to the council an account of all that had happened. Captain Percy\r\nwas dispatched with a party to chastise the Paspaheghs, for some\r\ndepredations; they fled before the English, who burnt their cabins,\r\ncaptured their queen and her children, and shortly after barbarously\r\nslew them. Lord Delaware, visiting the falls with a party of soldiers,\r\nwas attacked by the Indians, who killed some of his men.\r\n\r\nHis lordship having suffered much sickness, and finding himself in a\r\nstate of extreme debility, embarked,[103:A] in company of Dr. Bohun and\r\nCaptain Argall, and about fifty others, for the Island of Mevis, in the\r\nWest Indies. Contrary winds drove them to the north, and having put in\r\nat the mouth of a large river, then called Chickohocki, it hence derived\r\nits name of the Delaware.\r\n\r\nLord Delaware upon leaving the colony, committed the charge of it to\r\nCaptain George Percy, an honorable and resolute gentleman, but in infirm\r\nhealth, and deficient in energy. The number of colonists was at this\r\nperiod about two hundred; the stock of provisions sufficient for ten\r\nmonths, and the Indians peaceable and friendly. Before Lord Delaware\r\nreached England, the Virginia Council, discouraged by so many disasters\r\nand disappointments, were at a loss to decide whether they should use\r\nany further efforts to sustain the ill-fated colony, or should abandon\r\nthe enterprise, and recall the settlers from Virginia. But Sir Thomas\r\nGates made so strenuous an appeal in favor of sustaining the plantation,\r\nthat Sir Thomas Dale was dispatched with three vessels, cattle, hogs,\r\nand other supplies. The title given to Dale was that of High Marshal of\r\nVirginia, indicative of the martial authority with which he was\r\ninvested. He was a military man, and had served in the Low Countries,\r\nand he brought over with him an extraordinary code of \"laws divine,\r\nmoral, and martial,\" compiled by William Strachey, secretary of the\r\ncolony, for Sir Thomas Smith, from the military laws observed during the\r\nwars in the Low Countries. This code was sent over by Sir Thomas Smith,\r\ntreasurer or governor of the Virginia Company, without the company's\r\nsanction, as it has been alleged; but since the company in no way\r\ninterposed its authority in contravention to the new code, their\r\nsanction of it may be presumed. Several of these laws were barbarous,\r\ninhuman, written in blood.\r\n\r\nArriving in Virginia in the month of May, 1611, Dale touched at\r\nKiquotan, and set all hands there to planting corn. Reaching Jamestown\r\non the tenth of May, he found the settlers busily engaged in their usual\r\noccupation, playing at bowls in the streets. He set them to work felling\r\ntrees, repairing houses, and providing materials for enclosing the new\r\ntown, which he proposed to build. To find a site for it he surveyed the\r\nNansemond River and the James as far as the falls, and finally pitched\r\nupon a high ground, with steep banks, on the north side of the river,\r\nnear Arrohattock, and about twelve miles below the falls of the river.\r\nThe site was on a peninsula, known as Farrar's Island, in Varina Neck.\r\nSir Thomas was prevented for a time from founding the new town by the\r\ndisturbances that prevailed in the colony, and to restore order he\r\nenforced martial law with rigor. Eight of the colonists appear to have\r\nbeen convicted of treasonable plots and conspiracies, and executed by\r\ncruel and unusual modes, before midsummer. Among these was Jeffrey\r\nAbbot, who had served long in the army in Ireland and in the\r\nNetherlands; had been a sergeant of Captain John Smith's company in\r\nVirginia, who avers that he never knew there a better soldier or more\r\nloyal friend of the colony. It must be acknowledged that rigorous\r\nmeasures were necessary, and it was fortunate for the colony that the\r\ncruel and despotic code of laws, to which it was now subjected, was\r\nadministered by so discreet and upright a governor as Dale.\r\n\r\nEarly in August, 1611, Sir Thomas Gates, commissioned to take charge of\r\nthe government of the colony, came over with six vessels, three hundred\r\nmen, and abundant supplies. He was accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Glover,\r\nan approved preacher in Bedford and Huntingdonshire, a graduate of\r\nCambridge, in easy circumstances, and somewhat advanced in years.\r\nArriving at Jamestown early in August, during the sickly season, he soon\r\nafter died.\r\n\r\nDale, relieved from the cares of the chief post, cheerfully occupied a\r\nsubordinate position, and now turned his attention to the establishment\r\nof new settlements on the banks of the James, at some distance above\r\nJamestown. Furnished by Gates with three hundred and fifty men, he\r\nsailed up the river early in September, and on the spot selected before,\r\nhe founded the town of Henrico, so called in honor of the heir-apparent,\r\nPrince Henry, eldest son of James the First. The peninsula on which it\r\nwas built is formed by a remarkable bend, styled the \"Dutch Gap,\" where\r\nthe river, after sweeping a circuit of seven miles, returns within one\r\nhundred and twenty yards from the point of departure. The site commands\r\nan extensive and picturesque view of the winding river, which in this\r\npart of it is called the \"Corkscrew.\" The fertile tract of land there\r\nproduced tobacco nearly resembling the Spanish Varinas, and hence\r\nreceived the appellation of Varina, the name of a well-known plantation.\r\nThis was afterwards the residence of the Rev. William Stith, the best of\r\nour early historians, who dates the preface of his History of Virginia\r\nthere, in 1746.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the river, was impaled\r\nacross the isthmus from water to water. There were three streets of\r\nwell-framed houses, a handsome church of wood completed, and the\r\nfoundation laid of a better one to be built of brick, besides\r\nstore-houses, watch-houses, etc. Upon the river edge there were five\r\nhouses, in which lived \"the honester sort of people,\" as farmers in\r\nEngland, and they kept continual watch for the town's security. About\r\ntwo miles back from the town was a second palisade, near two miles in\r\nlength, from river to river, guarded by several commanders, with a good\r\nquantity of corn-ground impaled, and sufficiently secured.\r\n\r\nThe breastwork thrown up by Sir Thomas Dale is still to be traced, and\r\nvestiges of the town are indicated by scattered bricks, showing the\r\npositions of the houses.[106:A] Burk[106:B] and Keith[106:C] have fallen\r\ninto singular mistakes as to the situation of this town.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the river a plantation was established, called Hope\r\nin Faith and Coxendale, with forts, named, respectively, Charity,\r\nElizabeth, Patience, and Mount Malady, and a guest-house for sick\r\npeople, on the spot where afterwards, in Stith's time, Jefferson's\r\nchurch stood. On the same side of the river the Rev. Alexander Whitaker,\r\nsometimes styled the \"Apostle of Virginia,\" established his parsonage, a\r\nwell-framed house and one hundred acres of land, called Rock\r\nHall.[106:D]\r\n\r\nThe work of William Strachey, already referred to, entitled \"The History\r\nof Travel into Virginia Britannia,\" etc., appears to have been written\r\nbefore 1616, and two manuscripts of it exist, one in the British Museum,\r\nthe other in the Ashmolean manuscripts at Oxford.[106:E]\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Dale, when he came over to Virginia, was accompanied by Rev.\r\nAlexander Whitaker, the son of Dr. William Whitaker, Master of St.\r\nJohn's College, Cambridge, and also Regius Professor of Divinity there.\r\nThe doctor distinguished himself by his controversial writings against\r\nthe Church of Rome, and took a leading part in framing and maintaining\r\nthe Lambeth Articles, which were Calvinistic, and had they been\r\nestablished, might have gone far toward healing the divisions between\r\nthe Church of England and the Presbyterians. Rev. Alexander Whitaker,\r\nwhen he reached Virginia, had been a graduate of Cambridge some five or\r\nsix years, and had been seated in the North of England, where he was\r\nheld in great esteem. He had property of his own and excellent prospects\r\nof promotion; but, animated by a missionary spirit, he came over to\r\nVirginia. The voyage is described as speedy and safe, \"being scarce\r\neight weeks long.\"\r\n\r\nThe Appomattox Indians having committed some depredations, Sir Thomas\r\nDale, about Christmas, 1611, captured their town, near the mouth of the\r\nAppomattox River where it empties into the James. The town was five\r\nmiles distant from Henrico. Sir Thomas, pleased with the situation,\r\nestablished a plantation there, and called it Bermudas, the third town\r\nerected in Virginia, now known as Bermuda Hundred, the port of Richmond\r\nfor ships of heavy burden. He laid out several plantations there, the\r\nUpper and Lower Rochdale, West Shirley, and Digges' Hundred. In\r\nconformity with the code of martial law each hundred was subjected to\r\nthe control of a captain. The Nether Hundred was enclosed with a\r\npalisade two miles long, running from river to river, and here, within a\r\nhalf mile of each other, were many neat houses already built. Rochdale,\r\nor Rock's Dale, enclosed by a palisade four miles in length, was dotted\r\nwith houses along the enclosure; here the hogs and cattle enjoyed a\r\nrange of twenty miles to graze in securely. About fifty miles below\r\nthese settlements stood Jamestown, on a fertile peninsula, with two rows\r\nof framed houses, some of them with two stores and a garret, and three\r\nlarge store-houses. The town was well enclosed, and it and the\r\nneighboring region were well peopled. Forty miles below Jamestown, at\r\nKiquotan, the settlers enjoyed an abundance of fish, fowl, and\r\nvenison.[107:A]\r\n\r\nCaptain Argall now arriving from England, in a vessel with forty men,\r\nwas sent to the Potomac to trade for corn, and he contrived to\r\ningratiate himself with Japazaws, a friendly chief, and from him learned\r\nthat Pocahontas was there. She had never visited Jamestown since Smith's\r\ndeparture, and on the remote banks of the Potomac she thought herself\r\nunknown. Japazaws, easily bribed, betrayed the artless and unsuspecting\r\ngirl into Argall's hands. When she discovered the treachery she burst\r\ninto tears. Argall, having sent a messenger to inform Powhatan that his\r\nfavorite daughter was a prisoner, and must be ransomed with the men and\r\narms, conveyed her to Jamestown. Three months thereafter Powhatan\r\nrestored seven English prisoners and some unserviceable muskets, and\r\nsent word that if his daughter was released he would make restitution\r\nfor all injuries, and give the English five hundred bushels of corn, and\r\nforever remain in peace and amity.[108:A] They refused to surrender\r\nPocahontas until full satisfaction was rendered.\r\n\r\nPowhatan was deeply offended, and nothing more was heard from him for a\r\nlong time. At length Governor Dale, with Argall's vessel and some\r\nothers, manned with one hundred and fifty men, went up the York River,\r\ntaking the young captive with him, to Werowocomoco. Here, meeting with a\r\nscornful defiance, the English landed, burnt the cabins, and destroyed\r\neverything. On the next day Dale, proceeding up the river, concluded a\r\ntruce with the savages. He then sailed up to Matchot, another residence\r\nof Powhatan, on the south side of the Pamunkey, where it unites with the\r\nMatapony. Matchot is supposed to be identical with Eltham, the old seat\r\nof the Bassets, in the County of New Kent, and which borrows its name\r\nfrom an English seat in the County of Kent. At this place, where several\r\nhundred warriors were found, the English landed, and the savages\r\ndemanded a truce till Powhatan could be heard from, which being granted,\r\ntwo of Powhatan's sons went on board the vessel to see their sister\r\nPocahontas. Finding her well, contrary to what they had heard, they were\r\ndelighted, and promised to persuade their father to make peace, and\r\nforever be friends with the English.\r\n\r\nJohn Rolfe, and another of the Englishmen named Sparks, were dispatched\r\nto let Powhatan know these proceedings. He entertained them hospitably,\r\nbut would not admit them into his presence; they, however, saw his\r\nbrother Opechancanough, who engaged to use his influence with Powhatan\r\nin favor of peace. It now being April, the season for planting corn, Sir\r\nThomas Dale returned to Jamestown, intending not to renew hostilities\r\nuntil the next crop was made.\r\n\r\nMarch 12th, 1612, another charter was granted to the Virginia Company,\r\nextending the boundaries of the colony, so as to include all islands\r\nlying within three hundred leagues of the continent. The object of this\r\nextension was to embrace the Bermudas, or Summer Islands; but the\r\nVirginia Company shortly afterwards sold them to one hundred and twenty\r\nof its own members, who became incorporated into a distinct\r\ncompany.[109:A]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of November, 1612, died Henry, Prince of Wales, a gallant and\r\ngenerous spirit, the friend of Raleigh, and the idol of the nation; and\r\nhis premature death was deplored like that of the Black Prince before,\r\nand the Princess Charlotte in more modern times. He appears to have been\r\na warm friend of the infant plantation of Virginia, and Sir Thomas Dale\r\nspeaks of him \"as his glorious master, who would have enamelled with his\r\nfavors the labors which were undertaken for God's cause,\" and laments\r\nthat the \"whole frame of the enterprise seemed fallen into his grave.\"\r\n\r\nMr. John Rolfe, a worthy gentleman, who appears to have been a widower,\r\nhad been for some time in love with Pocahontas, and she with him; and,\r\nagitated by the conflicting emotions of this singular and romantic\r\nattachment, in a letter he requested the advice of Sir Thomas Dale, who\r\nreadily gave his assent to the proposed union. Pocahontas likewise\r\ncommunicated the affair to her brother; so that the report of the\r\nmarriage soon reached Powhatan, and it proved likewise acceptable to\r\nhim. Accordingly, within ten days he sent Opachisco, an aged uncle of\r\nPocahontas, and her two brothers, to attend the wedding, and fill his\r\nplace at the ceremony. The marriage took place early in April, 1613, at\r\nJamestown, and the rites were no doubt performed by the Rev. Mr.\r\nWhitaker.[109:B]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable union became a happy link of peace and harmony between\r\nthe red man and the white; and the warlike Chickahominies now came to\r\npropose a treaty of peace.[110:A] This fierce and numerous tribe,\r\ndwelling on the borders of the Chickahominy River, and near neighbors to\r\nthe English, had long maintained their independence, and refused to\r\nacknowledge the sceptre of Powhatan. They now sent two runners to\r\nGovernor Dale with presents, apologizing for all former injuries, and\r\noffering to submit themselves to King James, and to relinquish the name\r\nof Chickahominies, and be called Tassautessus (English.) They desired,\r\nnevertheless, still to be governed by their own laws, under the\r\nauthority of eight of their own chiefs. Governor Dale, with Captain\r\nArgall and fifty men, on the banks of the Chickahominy, concluded a\r\ntreaty of peace with them, and they ratified it by acclamation. An aged\r\nwarrior then arose and explained the treaty, addressing himself\r\nsuccessively to the old men, the young, and the women and children. The\r\nChickahominies, apprehensive of being reduced under the despotism of\r\nPowhatan, sheltered themselves under the protection of the whites--a\r\nstriking proof of the atrocious barbarity of a race whose imaginary\r\nvirtues have been so often celebrated by poets, orators, and historians,\r\nand who have been described as renewing the golden age of innocent\r\nfelicity.\r\n\r\nThe system of working in common, and of being provided for out of the\r\npublic store, although unavoidable at first, had hitherto tended to\r\nparalyze industry, and to retard the growth of the colony. An important\r\nalteration in this particular was now effected; Sir Thomas Dale allotted\r\nto each man three acres of cleared ground, from which he was only\r\nobliged to contribute to the public store two and a half barrels of\r\ncorn. These regulations, raising the colonists above the condition of\r\nabsolute dependence, and creating a new incentive to exertion, proved\r\nvery acceptable and beneficial.[110:B]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1614 Sir Thomas Gates returned again to England, and\r\nSir Thomas Dale reassumed the government of the colony. The French\r\nsettlers of Acadia had, as early as 1605, built the town of Port Royal,\r\non the Bay of Fundy; St. Croix was afterwards erected on the other side\r\nof the bay. Dale, looking upon these settlements as an encroachment upon\r\nthe territory of Virginia, which extended to the forty-fifth degree of\r\nlatitude, dispatched his kinsman, Argall, an enterprising and\r\nunscrupulous man, with a small force, to dislodge the intruders. The\r\nFrench colony was found situated on Mount Desert Island, near the\r\nPenobscot River, and within the bounds of the present State of Maine.\r\nThe French, surprised while dispersed in the woods, soon yielded to\r\nsuperior force, and Argall, as some accounts say, furnished the\r\nprisoners with a fishing vessel, in which they returned to France,\r\nexcept fifteen, including a Jesuit missionary, who were brought to\r\nJamestown. According to other accounts, their vessels were captured, but\r\nthe colonists escaped, and went to live among the Indians. On his\r\nreturn, Argall visited the Dutch settlement near the site of Albany, on\r\nthe Hudson, and compelled the governor there to surrender the place; but\r\nit was reclaimed by the Dutch not long afterwards, and during the next\r\nyear they erected a fort on Manhattan Island, on which is now seated the\r\ncommercial metropolis of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92:A] The colony was provided with fishing-nets, working tools,\r\napparel, six mares and a horse, five or six hundred swine, with some\r\ngoats and sheep. Jamestown was strongly fortified with palisades, and\r\ncontained fifty or sixty houses. There were, besides, five or six other\r\nforts and plantations. There was only one carpenter in the colony; three\r\nothers were learning that trade. There were two blacksmiths and two\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\n[92:B] Bacon's Essays, 123.\r\n\r\n[97:A] Anderson's Hist. of Col. Church, i. 232.\r\n\r\n[98:A] Anderson's Hist. of Col. Church, i. 263.\r\n\r\n[99:A] The wreck of the Sea-Venture appears to have suggested to\r\nShakespeare the groundwork for the plot of \"The Tempest,\" several\r\nincidents and passages being evidently taken from the contemporary\r\naccounts of that disaster, as narrated by Jordan and the Council of the\r\nVirginia Company.\r\n\r\n     \"Boatswain, down with the top-mast, yare\r\n      Lower, lower; bring her to try with the main course.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith, in his Sea-Grammar, published 1627, under the article how\r\nto handle a ship in a storm, says: \"Let us lie as try with our main\r\ncourse--that is, to haul the tack aboard, the sheet close aft, the\r\nboling set up, and the helm tied close aboard.\" Again, the boatswain\r\nsays: \"Lay her a-hold, a-hold; set her two courses.\" The two courses are\r\nthe mainsail and the foresail; and to lay a ship a-hold is to bring her\r\nto lie as near the wind as she can. These, and other nautical orders,\r\nare such as the brave old Somers probably gave when trying to keep the\r\nship as upright as possible.\r\n\r\n     \"We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.\"\r\n\r\nThis was suggested to the poet by the recorded incident of part of the\r\ncrew of the Sea-Venture having undertaken to drown their despair in\r\ndrunkenness.\r\n\r\n           \"Farewell, my wife and children!\r\n            Farewell, brother!\r\n\r\n     _Ant._ Let's all sink with the king.\r\n\r\n     _Seb._ Let's take leave of him.\"\r\n\r\nThese answer to the leave-taking of the Sea-Venture's crew. Jordan, in\r\nhis narrative, says: \"It is reported that this land of Bermudas, with\r\nthe islands about it, are enchanted and kept by evil and wicked\r\nspirits,\" etc. Shakespeare accordingly employs Prospero, Ariel, and\r\nCaliban to personate this fabled enchantment of the island. Ariel's task\r\nis, at Prospero's bidding--\r\n\r\n                                 \"To fly,\r\n     To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\r\n     On the curled clouds.\"\r\n\r\nThe tempest, in which the ship was wrecked, is thus described by\r\nAriel:--\r\n\r\n     \"I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\r\n      Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\r\n      I flamed amazement: sometimes I'd divide,\r\n      And burn in many places; on the top-mast,\r\n      The yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\r\n      Then meet and join; Jove's lightnings, the precursors\r\n      O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\r\n      And sight-outrunning were not; the fire, and cracks\r\n      Of sulphurous roaring, the most mighty Neptune\r\n      Seemed to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n                              \"Not a soul\r\n     But felt a fever of the mad and played\r\n     Some tricks of desperation.\"\r\n\r\nThe almost miraculous escape of all from the very jaws of impending\r\ndeath, is thus alluded to by Ariel in her report to Prospero:--\r\n\r\n                        \"Not a hair perished;\r\n     On their sustaining garments not a blemish,\r\n     But fresher than before: and as thou bad'st me,\r\n     In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.\"\r\n\r\nThe particular circumstances of the wreck are given quite exactly in the\r\nfamiliar verses:--\r\n\r\n                               \"Safely in harbor\r\n     Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once\r\n     Thou call'st me up at midnight to fetch dew\r\n     From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she's hid.\"\r\n\r\nBermoothes, the Spanish pronunciation of Bermudas, or Bermudez, the\r\noriginal name of the island, taken, as is said, from that of a Spanish\r\ncaptain wrecked there. Another real incident is referred to in the\r\nfollowing verses, the time only being transposed:--\r\n\r\n     \"The mariners all under hatches stowed;\r\n      Whom, with a charm joined to their suffered labor,\r\n      I have left asleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe return of the other seven vessels of the fleet is described with a\r\nchange, however, of the sea in which they sailed, and in their place of\r\ndestination:--\r\n\r\n              \"And for the rest of the fleet,\r\n     Which I dispersed, they all have met again;\r\n     And are upon the Mediterranean flote,\r\n     Bound sadly home for Naples;\r\n     Supposing that they saw the king's ship wrecked\r\n     And his great person perish.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly a year after the Sea-Venture's separation from the fleet, it\r\nwas believed, in Virginia and in England, that she and her company were\r\nlost. Smith and Pocahontas may have suggested some materials for the\r\ncharacters of Ferdinand and Miranda.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, after abandoning the stage, in 1607 or 1608, about the time\r\nof the first landing at Jamestown, remained in London for some four or\r\nfive years. Smith, and the early colonists of Virginia, had many of them\r\nprobably witnessed the theatrical performances at the Globe or Black\r\nFryars; Beggars' Bush, now Jordan's Point, an early plantation on the\r\nJames River, derived its name from a comedy of Fletcher's. Shakespeare\r\nwas, no doubt, quite familiar with the more remarkable incidents of the\r\nfirst settlement of the colony: the early voyages; the first discovery;\r\nthe landing; Smith's rencontres with the Indians; his rescue by\r\nPocahontas; the starving time, etc. Smith, indeed, as has been before\r\nmentioned, complained of his exploits and adventures having been\r\nmisrepresented on the stage, in London. That Shakespeare makes few or no\r\nallusions to these incidents, is because they occurred after nearly all\r\nhis plays had been composed. \"The Tempest,\" however, was written several\r\nyears after the landing at Jamestown, being one of his latest\r\nproductions--a creation of his maturest intellect.\r\n\r\n[102:A] Court and Times of James the First, 160.\r\n\r\n[103:A] March 28th, 1611.\r\n\r\n[106:A] Va.

Powhatan\r\nrecognizing the boy Thomas Savage, said to him: \"My child, I gave you\r\nleave, being my boy, to go see your friends; and these four years I have\r\nnot seen you nor heard of my own man, Namontack, I sent to England,\r\nthough many ships have been returned from thence.\" Turning then to\r\nHamor, he demanded the chain of beads which he had sent to Sir Thomas\r\nDale at his first arrival, with the understanding that whenever he\r\nshould send a messenger, he should wear that chain about his neck;\r\notherwise he was to be bound, and sent home. Sir Thomas _had_ made such\r\nan arrangement, and on this occasion had directed his page to give the\r\nnecklace to Hamor; but the page had forgotten it. However, Hamor being\r\naccompanied by two of Powhatan's own people, he was satisfied, and\r\nconducted him to the royal cabin, where a guard of two hundred bowmen\r\nstood always in attendance. He offered his guest a pipe of tobacco, and\r\nthen inquired after his brother, Sir Thomas Dale, and his daughter,\r\nPocahontas, and his unknown son-in-law, Rolfe, and \"how they lived and\r\nloved.\" Being answered that Pocahontas was so well satisfied, that she\r\nwould never live with him again, he laughed, and demanded the object of\r\nhis visit. Hamor gave him to understand that his message was private, to\r\nbe made known only to him and to Papaschicher, one of the guides who was\r\nin the secret. Forthwith Powhatan ordered out all his people, except his\r\ntwo queens \"that always sit by him,\" and bade Hamor deliver his message.\r\nHe then, by his interpreter, let him know that Sir Thomas Dale had sent\r\nhim pieces of copper, strings of white and blue beads, wooden combs,\r\nfish-hooks, and a pair of knives, and would give him a grindstone, when\r\nhe would send for it; that his brother Dale, hearing of the charms of\r\nhis younger daughter, desired that he would send her to Jamestown, as\r\nwell because he intended to marry her, as on account of the desire of\r\nPocahontas to see her, and he believed that there could be no better\r\nbond of peace and friendship than such a union. While Hamor was\r\nspeaking, Powhatan repeatedly interrupted him, and when he had ended,\r\nthe old chief replied: \"I gladly accept your salute of love and peace\r\nwhich, while I live, I shall exactly keep. His pledges thereof I receive\r\nwith no less thanks, although they are not so great as I have received\r\nbefore. But, for my daughter, I have sold her within these few days to a\r\ngreat werowance, three days journey from me, for two bushels of\r\nrawrenoke.\" Hamor: \"I know your highness, by returning the rawrenoke,\r\nmight call her back again, to gratify your brother, Sir Thomas Dale, and\r\nthe rather because she is but twelve years old. Besides its forming a\r\nbond of peace, you shall have in return for her, three times the value\r\nof the rawrenoke, in beads, copper, and hatchets.\" Powhatan: \"I love my\r\ndaughter as my life, and though I have many children, I delight in none\r\nso much as her, and if I should not often see her I could not possibly\r\nlive, and if she lived at Jamestown I could not see her, having resolved\r\non no terms to put myself into your hands, or go among you. Therefore, I\r\ndesire you to urge me no further, but return my brother this answer: I\r\ndesire no firmer assurance of his friendship than the promise he hath\r\nmade. From me he _has_ a pledge, one of my daughters, which, so long as\r\nshe lives, shall be sufficient; when _she_ dies, he shall have another.\r\nI hold it not a brotherly part to desire to bereave me of my two\r\nchildren at once. Further, tell him that though he had no pledge at all,\r\nhe need not fear any injury from me or my people; there have been too\r\nmany of his men and mine slain; and, by my provocation, there never\r\nshall be any more, (I who have power to perform it, have said it,) even\r\nif I should have just cause, for I am now old, and would gladly end my\r\ndays in peace; if you offer me injury, my country is large enough for me\r\nto go from you. This, I hope, will satisfy my brother. Now, since you\r\nare weary and I sleepy, we will here end.\" So Hamor and his companions\r\nlodged at Matchot that night. While there they saw William Parker, who\r\nhad been captured three years before at Fort Henry. He had grown so like\r\nan Indian in complexion and manner, that his fellow-countrymen\r\nrecognized him only by his language. He begged them to intercede for his\r\nrelease, but upon their undertaking it, Powhatan replied: \"You have one\r\nof my daughters, and I am satisfied; but you cannot see one of your men\r\nwith me, but you must have him away, or break friendship; but if you\r\nmust needs have him, you shall go home without guides, and if any evil\r\nbefall you, thank yourselves.\" They answered him that if any harm befell\r\nthem he must expect revenge from his brother Dale. At this Powhatan, in\r\na passion, left them; but returning to supper, he entertained them with\r\na pleasant countenance. About midnight he awoke them, and promised to\r\nlet them return in the morning with Parker, and charged them to remind\r\nhis brother Dale to send him ten large pieces of copper, a\r\nshaving-knife, a frowl, a grindstone, a net, fish-hooks, and other such\r\npresents. Lest they might forget, he made them write down the list of\r\narticles in a blank book that he had. They requesting him to give them\r\nthe book, he declined doing so, saying, \"it did him much good to show it\r\nto strangers.\"[114:A]\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1614 Sir Walter Raleigh published his \"History of the\r\nWorld;\" Captain John Smith made a voyage to North Virginia, and gave it\r\nthe name of New England; and the Dutch, as already mentioned, effected a\r\nsettlement near the site of Albany, on the Hudson River. Sir Thomas\r\nGates, upon his return to England, reported that the plantation of\r\nVirginia would fall to the ground unless soon reinforced with\r\nsupplies.[114:B] Martin, a lawyer, employed by the Virginia Company to\r\nrecommend some measure to the House of Commons, having spoken\r\ndisparagingly of that body, was arraigned at the bar of the House; but,\r\nupon making due acknowledgment upon his knees, was pardoned.[115:A]\r\nDuring this year died Richard Hakluyt, the compiler of a celebrated\r\ncollection of voyages and discoveries. He was of an ancient family in\r\nHerefordshire, and, after passing some time at Westminster School, was\r\nelected to a studentship at Oxford, where he contracted a friendship\r\nwith Sir Philip Sydney, to whom he inscribed his first collection of\r\nVoyages and Discoveries printed in 1582. Having imbibed a taste for the\r\nstudy of geography and cosmography from a cousin of the same name, a\r\nstudent of law at the Temple, he applied himself to that department of\r\nlearning with diligence, and was at length appointed to lecture at the\r\nUniversity on that subject. He contributed valuable aid in fitting out\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert's expedition. Soon after, taking holy orders, he\r\nproceeded to Paris as chaplain to Sir Edward Stafford, the English\r\nAmbassador. During his absence he was appointed to a prebendal stall at\r\nBristol, and upon his return to England he frequently resided there. He\r\nwas afterwards preferred to the rectory of Witheringset, in Suffolk. In\r\n1615 he was appointed a prebendary of Westminster, and became a member\r\nof the council of the Virginia Company. He continued to watch over the\r\naffairs of the colony until his death. He was buried in Westminster\r\nAbbey. Hakluyt's Voyages consist of five volumes, folio.\r\n\r\nPocahontas was now carefully instructed in the Christian religion, and\r\nsuch was the change wrought in her, that after some time she lost all\r\ndesire to return to her father, and retained no longer any fondness for\r\nthe rude society of her own people. She had already, before her\r\nmarriage, openly renounced the idolatry of her country, confessed the\r\nfaith of Christ, and had been baptized. Master Whitaker, the preacher,\r\nin a letter dated June 18th, 1614, expresses his surprise that so few of\r\nthe English ministers, \"that were so hot against the surplice and\r\nsubscription,\" came over to Virginia, where neither was spoken of. At\r\nthe end of June Captain Argall returned to England with tidings of the\r\nmore auspicious state of affairs. The Virginia Company now proceeded to\r\ndraw the lottery, which had been made up to promote the interests of the\r\ncolony, and twenty-nine thousand pounds were thus contributed; but\r\nParliament shortly after prohibited this pernicious practice. It has\r\nbeen said that this is the first instance of raising money in England by\r\nlottery;[116:A] but this is erroneous, for there had been a lottery\r\ndrawn for the purpose of repairing the harbors of the kingdom as far\r\nback as 1569.[116:B]\r\n\r\nThe year 1615 is remarkable in Virginia history for the first\r\nestablishment of a fixed property in the soil, fifty acres of land being\r\ngranted by the company to every freeman in absolute right.[116:C] This\r\nsalutary reform was brought about mainly by the influence of Sir Thomas\r\nDale, one of the best of the early governors. Sir Thomas having now,\r\nafter a stay of five years in Virginia, established good order at\r\nJamestown, appointed George Yeardley to be deputy governor in his\r\nabsence, and embarked for England, accompanied by John Rolfe and his\r\nwife, the Princess Pocahontas, and other Indians of both sexes. They\r\narrived at Plymouth on the 12th of June, 1616, about six weeks after the\r\ndeath of Shakespeare, who died on the twenty-third of April. The arrival\r\nis thus noticed in a news-letter: \"Sir Thomas Dale is arrived from\r\nVirginia, and brought with him some ten or twelve old and young of that\r\ncountry, among whom is Pocahontas, daughter of Powhatan, a king or\r\ncacique of that country, married to one Rolfe, an Englishman. I hear not\r\nof any other riches or matter of worth, but only some quantity of\r\nsassafras, tobacco, pitch, tar, and clapboard--things of no great value,\r\nunless there were plenty and nearer hand. All I can hear of it is, that\r\nthe country is good to live in, if it were stored with people, and might\r\nin time become commodious. But there is no present profit to be\r\nexpected.\"[116:D]\r\n\r\nReverting to the condition of affairs in the colony, it is to be\r\nobserved, that the oligarchical government of the president and council,\r\nwith all its odious features, had long before this come to an end; order\r\nand diligence had now taken the place of confusion and idleness; peace\r\nwith the Indians had given rise to a free trade with them, and the\r\nEnglish acquired their commodities by lawful purchase instead of\r\nextorting them by force of arms. The places inhabited by the whites, at\r\nthis time, were Henrico and the limits, Bermuda Nether Hundred, West and\r\nShirley Hundred, Jamestown, Kiquotan, and Dale's Gift. At Henrico there\r\nwere thirty-eight men and boys, of whom twenty-two were farmers. The\r\nRev. William Wickham was the minister of this place. It was the seat of\r\nthe college established for the education of the natives; they had\r\nalready brought hither some of their children, of both sexes, to be\r\ntaught. At Bermuda Nether Hundred (Presquile) the number of inhabitants\r\nwas one hundred and nineteen. Captain Yeardley, deputy governor, lived\r\nhere for the most part. The minister here was Master Alexander Whitaker.\r\nAt West and Shirley Hundred there were twenty-five men under Captain\r\nMadison. At Jamestown fifty, under Captain Francis West; the Rev. Mr.\r\nBucke minister. At Kiquotan Captain Webb commanded; Rev. Mr. Mease the\r\nminister. Dale's Gift, on the sea-coast, near Cape Charles, was occupied\r\nby seventeen men under Lieutenant Cradock. The total population of the\r\ncolony, at this time, was three hundred and fifty-one.[117:A] Yeardley\r\ndirected the attention of the colony to tobacco, as the most saleable\r\ncommodity that they could raise, and its cultivation was introduced into\r\nVirginia in this year, 1616, for the first time. The English now found\r\nthe climate to suit their constitutions so well, that fewer people died\r\nhere in proportion than in England. The Chickahominies refusing to pay\r\nthe tribute of corn agreed upon by the treaty, Yeardley went up their\r\nriver with one hundred men, and, after killing some and making some\r\nprisoners, brought off much of their corn. On his return he met\r\nOpechancanough at Ozinies, about twelve miles above the mouth of the\r\nChickahominy. In this expedition Henry Spilman, who had been rescued\r\nfrom death by Pocahontas, now a captain, acted as interpreter.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Pocahontas was kindly received in London; by the care\r\nof her husband and friends she was, by this time, taught to speak\r\nEnglish intelligibly; her manners received the softening influence of\r\nEnglish refinement, and her mind was enlightened by the truths of\r\nreligion. Having given birth to a son, the Virginia Company provided for\r\nthe maintenance of them both, and many persons of quality were very kind\r\nto her. Before she reached London, Captain Smith, who was well\r\nacquainted at court, and in especial favor with Prince Charles, in\r\nrequital for her former preservation of his life, had prepared an\r\naccount of her in a small book, and he presented it to Queen Anne. But,\r\nat this time, being about to embark for New England, he could not pay\r\nher such attentions as he desired and she well deserved. Nevertheless,\r\nlearning that she was staying at Brentford, where she had repaired in\r\norder to avoid the smoke of the city, he went, accompanied by several\r\nfriends, to see her. After a modest salutation, without uttering a word,\r\nshe turned away, and hid her face, as if offended. In that posture she\r\nremained for two or three hours, her husband and Smith and the rest of\r\nthe company having, in the mean while, gone out of the room, and Smith\r\nnow regretting that he had written to the queen that Pocahontas could\r\nspeak English. At length she began to talk, and she reminded Captain\r\nSmith of the kindness she had shown him in her own country, saying: \"You\r\ndid promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to\r\nyou; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and for the\r\nsame reason so I must call you.\" But Smith, on account of the king's\r\noverweening and preposterous jealousy of the royal prerogative, felt\r\nconstrained to decline the appellation of \"father,\" for she was \"a\r\nking's daughter.\" She then exclaimed, with a firm look: \"Were you not\r\nafraid to come into my father's country, and cause fear in him and all\r\nhis people (but me,) and fear you here that I should call you father? I\r\ntell you then I will, and you shall call me child, and I will be forever\r\nand ever your countrywoman. They did tell us always you were dead, and I\r\nknew no other till I came to Plymouth; yet Powhatan did command\r\nUttomattomakkin to seek you, and know the truth, because your countrymen\r\nwill lie much.\" It is remarkable that Rolfe, her husband, must have been\r\nprivy to the deception thus practised on her; are we to attribute this\r\nto his secret apprehension that she would never marry him until she\r\nbelieved that Smith was dead?\r\n\r\nTomocomo, or Uttamattomakkin, or Uttamaccomack, husband of Matachanna,\r\none of Powhatan's daughters, being a priest, and esteemed a wise and\r\nknowing one among his people, Powhatan, or, as Sir Thomas Dale supposed,\r\nOpechancanough, had sent him out to England, in company of Pocahontas,\r\nto number the people there, and bring back to him an account of that\r\ncountry. Upon landing at Plymouth he provided himself, according to his\r\ninstructions, with a long stick, and undertook, by notching it, to keep\r\na tally of all the men he could see; but he soon grew weary of the task,\r\nand gave it out in despair. Meeting with Captain Smith in London,\r\nUttamattomakkin told him that Powhatan had ordered him to seek him out,\r\nthat he might show him the English God, the king, queen, and prince.\r\nBeing informed that he had already seen the king, he denied it; but on\r\nbeing convinced of it, he said: \"You gave Powhatan a white dog, which\r\nPowhatan fed as himself; but your king gave me nothing, and I am better\r\nthan your white dog.\" On his return to Virginia, when Powhatan\r\ninterrogated him as to the number of people in England, he is said to\r\nhave replied: \"Count the stars in the heavens, the leaves on the trees,\r\nthe sands on the sea-shore.\" Whether this and other such figurative\r\nexpressions attributed to the Indians, were actually uttered by them, or\r\nwhether they have received some poetical embellishment in the course of\r\ninterpretation, the judicious reader may determine for himself.\r\n\r\nDuring Smith's brief stay in London, many courtiers and others of his\r\nacquaintance daily called upon him for the purpose of being introduced\r\nto Pocahontas, and they expressed themselves satisfied that the hand of\r\nProvidence was manifest in her conversion, and declared that they had\r\nseen many English ladies worse favored, proportioned, and behaviored.\r\nShe was presented at Court by Lady Delaware, attended by the lord her\r\nhusband, and other persons of quality, and was graciously received. Her\r\nmodest, dignified, and graceful deportment, excited the admiration of\r\nall, and she received the particular attentions of the king and queen.\r\n\r\nIt is said, upon the authority of a well-established tradition, that\r\nKing James was at first greatly offended at Rolfe for having presumed to\r\nmarry a princess without his consent; but that upon a fuller\r\nrepresentation of the matter, his majesty was pleased to express himself\r\nsatisfied. There is hardly any folly so foolish but that it may have\r\nbeen committed by \"the wisest fool in Christendom.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Virginia woman, Pocahontas, with her father counsellor, have been\r\nwith the king, and graciously used, and both she and her assistant well\r\nplaced at the masque.\"[120:A] She was styled the \"Lady Pocahontas,\" and\r\ncarried herself \"as the daughter of a king.\" Lady Delaware and other\r\nnoble persons waited on her to masquerades, balls, plays, and other\r\npublic entertainments. Purchas, the compiler of Voyages and Travels, was\r\npresent at an entertainment given in honor of her by the Bishop of\r\nLondon, Doctor King, which exceeded in pomp and splendor any other\r\nentertainment of the kind that the author of \"The Pilgrim\" had ever\r\nwitnessed there.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, after thirteen years' confinement in the Tower, had\r\nbeen released on the seventeenth of March preceding, and, upon gaining\r\nhis liberty, he went about the city looking at the changes that had\r\noccurred since his imprisonment. It is not improbable that he may have\r\nseen Pocahontas.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1617 John Rolfe prepared to embark for Virginia, with his wife\r\nand child, in Captain Argall's vessel, the George. Pocahontas was\r\nreluctant to return. On the eve of her embarkation it pleased God to\r\ntake her unexpectedly from the world. She died at Gravesend, on the\r\nThames, in the latter part of March. As her life had been sweet and\r\nlovely, so her death was serene, and crowned with the hopes of religion.\r\n\r\n\"The Virginia woman, whose picture I sent you, died this last week at\r\nGravesend, as she was returning home.\"[120:B] The parish register of\r\nburials at Gravesend, in the County of Kent, contains the following\r\nentry: \"1616, March 21, Rebecca Wrothe, wyffe of Thomas Wrothe, Gent. A\r\nVirginia Lady borne, was buried in the Chancell.\" The date, 1616,\r\ncorresponds with the historical year 1617. It appears that there was\r\nformerly a family of the name of Wrothe resident near Gravesend. This\r\nname might therefore easily be confounded with that of Rolfe, the sound\r\nbeing similar. Nor is the mistake of Thomas for John at all improbable.\r\nGravesend Church, in which Pocahontas was buried, was destroyed by fire\r\nin 1727, and no monument to her memory remains, if any ever\r\nexisted.[121:A]\r\n\r\nAccording to Strachey, a good authority, the Indians had several\r\ndifferent names given them at different times, and Powhatan called his\r\nfavorite daughter when quite young, Pocahontas, that is, \"Little\r\nWanton,\" but at a riper age she was called Amonate. According to\r\nStith,[121:B] her real name was Matoax, which the people of her nation\r\nconcealed from the English, and changed it to Pocahontas from a\r\nsuperstitious fear, lest, knowing her true name, they should do her some\r\ninjury. Others suppose Matoax to have been her individual name,\r\nPocahontas her title. After her conversion she was baptized by the name\r\nof Rebecca, and she was sometimes styled the \"Lady Rebecca.\" The\r\nceremony of her baptism has been made the subject of a picture, (by\r\nChapman,) exhibited in the rotundo of the Capitol at Washington.\r\n\r\nOf the brothers of Pocahontas, Nantaquaus, or Nantaquoud, is especially\r\ndistinguished for having shown Captain Smith \"exceeding great courtesy,\"\r\ninterceding with his father, Powhatan, in behalf of the captive, and he\r\nwas the \"manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit,\" Smith ever saw in a\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\nOf the sisters of Pocahontas two are particularly mentioned, Cleopatre\r\nand Matachanna. Strachey has recorded the names of the numerous wives\r\nand children of Powhatan, the greater part of which are harsh and\r\nguttural, and apparently almost incapable of being pronounced by the\r\nvocal organs of civilized man.\r\n\r\nSmith says that Pocahontas, \"with her wild train, visited Jamestown as\r\nfreely as her father's habitation.\" In these visits she had to cross\r\nthe York River, some two miles wide, in a canoe, (\"quintan\" in the\r\nPowhatan language,) and then walk some ten or twelve miles across to\r\nJamestown. She is described as \"being of a great spirit, however her\r\nstature;\" from which it may be inferred that she was below the middle\r\nheight.[122:A] She died at the age of twenty-two, having been born about\r\nthe year 1595. Her infant son, Thomas Rolfe, was left for a time at\r\nPlymouth, under the care of Sir Lewis Stukely, Vice-Admiral of Devon,\r\nwho afterwards, by his base treachery toward Sir Walter Raleigh, covered\r\nhimself with infamy, and by dishonest and criminal practices reduced\r\nhimself to beggary. The son of Pocahontas was subsequently removed to\r\nLondon, where he was educated under the care of his uncle, Henry Rolfe,\r\na merchant.[122:B]\r\n\r\nThomas Rolfe came to Virginia and became a person of fortune and note in\r\nthe colony. It has been said that he married in England a Miss Poyers;\r\nhowever that may have been, he left an only daughter, Jane Rolfe, who\r\nmarried Colonel Robert Bolling. He lies buried at Farmingdale, in the\r\nCounty of Prince George.[122:C] This Colonel Robert Bolling was the son\r\nof John and Mary Bolling, of Alhallows, Barkin Parish, Tower Street,\r\nLondon. He was born in December, 1646, and came to Virginia in October,\r\n1660, and died in July, 1709, aged sixty-two years. Colonel Robert\r\nBolling, and Jane Rolfe, his wife, left an only son, Major John Bolling,\r\nfather of Colonel John Bolling and several daughters, who married\r\nrespectively, Col. Richard Randolph, Colonel John Fleming, Doctor\r\nWilliam Gay, Mr. Thomas Eldridge, and Mr. James Murray.\r\n\r\nCensure is sometimes cast upon Captain Smith for having failed to marry\r\nPocahontas; but history no where gives any just ground for such a\r\nreproach. The rescue of Smith took place in the winter of 1607, when he\r\nwas twenty-eight years of age, and she only twelve or thirteen.[123:A]\r\nSmith left Virginia early in 1609, and never returned. Pocahontas was\r\nthen about fourteen years of age; but if she had been older, it would\r\nhave been impossible for him to marry her unless by kidnapping her, as\r\nwas done by the unscrupulous Argall some years afterwards--a measure\r\nwhich, if it had been adopted in 1609, when the colony was so feeble,\r\nand so rent by faction, would probably have provoked the vengeance of\r\nPowhatan, and overwhelmed the plantation in premature ruin. It was in\r\n1612 that Argall captured Pocahontas on the banks of the Potomac, and\r\nfrom the departure of Smith until this time she never had been seen at\r\nJamestown, but had lived on the distant banks of the Potomac. In the\r\nspring of 1613 it is stated, that long before that time \"Mr. John Rolfe\r\nhad been in love with Pocahontas, and she with him.\" This attachment\r\nmust, therefore, have been formed immediately after her capture, if it\r\ndid not exist before; and the marriage took place in April, 1613. It is\r\ntrue that Pocahontas had been led to believe that Smith was dead, and in\r\npractising this deception upon her, Rolfe must have been a party; but\r\nSmith was in no manner whatever privy to it; he cherished for her a\r\nfriendship animated by the deepest emotions of gratitude; and\r\nfriendship, according to Spenser, a cotemporary poet, is a more exalted\r\nsentiment than love.\r\n\r\nPocahontas appears to have regarded Smith with a sort of filial\r\naffection, and she accordingly said to him, in the interview at\r\nBrentford, \"I tell you then, I _will_ call you father, and you _shall_\r\ncall me child.\" The delusion practised on her relative to Smith's death\r\nwould, indeed, seem to argue an apprehension on the part of Rolfe and\r\nhis friends that she would not marry another while Smith was alive, and\r\nthe particular circumstances of the interview at Brentford would seem to\r\nconfirm the existence of such an apprehension. Yet, however that may\r\nhave been, the honor and integrity of Smith remain untarnished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112:A] Smith, ii. 19.

He sailed\r\nfor Virginia early in 1617, accompanied by Ralph Hamor, his\r\nvice-admiral, and arrived at Jamestown in May. Argall was welcomed by\r\nCaptain Yeardley and his company, the right file of which was led by an\r\nIndian. At Jamestown were found but five or six habitable houses, the\r\nchurch fallen, the palisades broken, the bridge foundrous, the well\r\nspoiled, the storehouse used for a church; the market-place, streets,\r\nand other vacant ground planted with tobacco; the savages as frequent in\r\nthe houses as the English, who were dispersed about as each man could\r\nfind a convenient place for planting corn and tobacco. Tomocomo, who\r\n(together with the other Indians that had gone out to England in the\r\nsuite of Pocahontas, as may be presumed, although the fact is not\r\nexpressly mentioned,) had returned with Argall, was immediately, upon\r\nhis arrival, sent to Opechancanough, who came to Jamestown, and received\r\na present with great joy and thankfulness. But Tomocomo denounced\r\nEngland and the English in bitter terms, especially Sir Thomas Dale.\r\nPowhatan having some time before this resigned the cares of government\r\ninto the hands of Opechancanough, went about from place to place, still\r\ncontinuing in friendship with the English, but greatly lamenting the\r\ndeath of Pocahontas. He rejoiced, nevertheless, that her child was\r\nliving, and he and Opechancanough both expressed much desire to see him.\r\nDuring this year a Mr. Lambert introduced the method of curing tobacco\r\non lines instead of in heaps, as had been the former practice.[125:A]\r\nArgall's energetic measures procured from the Indians, by trade, a\r\nsupply of corn. The whole number of colonists now was about four\r\nhundred, with numerous cattle, goats, and swine. The corn contributed to\r\nthe public store was about four hundred and fifty bushels, and from the\r\ntributary Indians seven hundred and fifty, being considerably less than\r\nthe usual quantity. Of the \"Company's company\" there remained not more\r\nthan fifty-four, including men, women, and children. Drought, and a\r\nstorm that poured down hailstones eight or nine inches in circumference,\r\ngreatly damaged the crops of corn and tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe following is found among the early records:--\r\n\r\n     \"BY THE ADMIRAL, ETC.\r\n\r\n     \"To all to whom these presents shall come, I, Samuel Argall,\r\n     Esq., admiral, and for the time present principal Governor of\r\n     Virginia, send greeting in our Lord God everlasting, si'thence\r\n     in all places of wars and garrison towns, it is most expedient\r\n     and necessary to have an honest and careful provost marshall,\r\n     to whose charge and safe custody all delinquents and prisoners\r\n     of what nature or quality soever their offences be, are to be\r\n     committed; now know ye that for the honesty, sufficiency, and\r\n     carefulness in the execution and discharge of the said office,\r\n     which I conceived of William Cradock, I do by these presents\r\n     nominate, constitute, ordain, and appoint the said William\r\n     Cradock to be provost marshall of the Bermuda City, and of all\r\n     the Hundred thereto belonging, giving and granting unto the\r\n     said William Cradock, all power and authority to execute all\r\n     such offices, duties, and commands belonging to the said place\r\n     of provost marshall; with all privileges, rights, and\r\n     preëminences thereunto belonging, and in all cases which\r\n     require his speedy execution of his said office, by virtue of\r\n     these presents, he shall require all captains, officers,\r\n     soldiers, or any other members of this colony, to be aiding\r\n     and assisting to him, to oppose all mutinies, factions,\r\n     rebellions, and all other discords contrary to the quiet and\r\n     peaceable government of this Commonwealth, as they will answer\r\n     the contrary at their peril.\r\n\r\n     \"Given at Bermuda City this twentieth of February, in the 15th\r\n     year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord James, by the Grace of\r\n     God, King of England, and of Scotland the 51st, and in the\r\n     11th year of this Plantation.

Secy's office.\"]\r\n\r\nTo reinforce the colony the Company sent out a vessel of two hundred and\r\nfifty tons, well stored, with two hundred and fifty people, under\r\ncommand of Lord Delaware. They set sail in April, 1618; during the\r\nvoyage thirty died, and among them Lord Delaware, a generous friend of\r\nthe colony. The intelligence of his death reached London October fifth.\r\nStith[126:A] says: \"And I think I have somewhere seen that he died about\r\nthe mouth of Delaware Bay, which thence took its name from him.\" Stith\r\nfell into a mistake on this point, and Belknap, equally distinguished\r\nfor his general accuracy, has followed him.[126:B] Delaware Bay (the\r\nmouth of the river called by the Indians Chihohocki) and River were\r\nnamed as early as 1611, when Lord Delaware put in there, during his\r\nhomeward voyage.[126:C] According to Strachey, the bay was discovered in\r\n1610, by Captain Argall, and he named Cape Delaware, \"where he caught\r\nhalibut, cod, and ling fish, and brought some of them to Jamestown.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship's family name was West, and persons descended from the same\r\nstock are yet found in Virginia bearing the name. West-Point, at the\r\nhead of York, derived its name from the same source, and it was at first\r\ncalled Delaware. Lord Delaware married, in 1602, the daughter of Sir\r\nThomas Shirley, of Whiston; and, perhaps, the name of Shirley, the\r\nancient seat on James River, may be traced to this source.\r\n\r\nMartial law had already been established in Virginia by Dale; Argall\r\ncame over invested with powers to make the government still more\r\narbitrary and despotic, and bent upon acquiring gain by all possible\r\nmeans of extortion and oppression. He decreed that goods should be sold\r\nat an advance of twenty-five per cent., and tobacco rated at the\r\nProcrustean value of three shillings--the penalty for rating it either\r\nhigher or lower being three years slavery to the colony; that there\r\nshould be no trade or intercourse with the Indians, and that none of\r\nthem should be taught the use of fire-arms; the penalty for violating\r\nwhich ordinance was death to teacher and learner. Yet it has been\r\ncontended by some, that the use of fire-arms by the savages hastened\r\ntheir extermination, because they thus became dependent on the whites\r\nfor arms and ammunition; when their guns came to be out of order they\r\nbecame useless to them, for they wanted the skill to repair them; and,\r\nlastly, fire-arms in their hands when effective, were employed by\r\nhostile tribes in mutual destruction.\r\n\r\n     \"The white faith of history cannot show\r\n      That e'er a musket yet could beat a bow.\"[127:A]\r\n\r\nArgall also issued edicts that no one should hunt deer or hogs without\r\nhis leave; that no man should fire a gun before a new supply of\r\nammunition, except in self-defence, on pain of a year's slavery; absence\r\nfrom church on Sundays or holidays, was punished by confinement for the\r\nnight and one week's slavery to the colony; for the second offence the\r\noffender should be a slave for a month; and for the third, for a year\r\nand a day. Several of these regulations were highly judicious, but the\r\npenalties of some of them were excessive and barbarous, and the vigorous\r\nenforcement of these, and his oppressive proceedings, rendered Argall\r\nodious to the colony, and a report of his tyranny and extortions having\r\nreached England, Sir Thomas Smith, Alderman Johnson, deputy treasurer,\r\nSir Lionel Cranfield, and others of the council, addressed a letter\r\ndated August 23, 1618, to him, in which they recapitulated a series of\r\ncharges against him of dishonesty, corruption, and oppression. At the\r\nsame time a letter, of the same purport, was written to Lord Delaware,\r\nand he was told, that such was the indignation felt by the stockholders\r\nin the Virginia Company against Argall that they could hardly be\r\nrestrained from going to the king, although on a distant progress, and\r\nprocuring his majesty's command for recalling him as a malefactor. The\r\nletter contained further instructions to Lord Delaware to seize upon all\r\nthe goods and property in Argall's possession. These letters, by Lord\r\nDelaware's death, fell into Argall's hands, and finding his sand running\r\nlow, he determined to make the best of his remaining time, and so he\r\nmultiplied his exactions, and grew more tyrannical than ever. The case\r\nof Edward Brewster was a remarkable instance of this. A person of good\r\nrepute in the colony, he had the management of Lord Delaware's estate.\r\nArgall, without any rightful authority, removed the servants from his\r\nlordship's land, and employed them on his own. Brewster endeavored to\r\nmake them return, and upon this being flatly refused by one of them,\r\nthreatened him with the consequences of his contumacy. Brewster was\r\nimmediately arrested by Argall's order, charged with sedition and\r\nmutiny, and condemned to death by a court-martial. The members of the\r\ncourt, however, and some of the clergy, shocked at such a conviction,\r\ninterceded earnestly for his pardon, and Argall reluctantly granted it\r\non condition that Brewster should depart from Virginia, with an oath\r\nnever to return, and never to say or do anything to the disparagement of\r\nthe deputy governor. Brewster, nevertheless, upon his return to England,\r\ndiscarding the obligation of an oath extorted under duress, appealed to\r\nthe Company against the tyranny of the deputy governor, and the inhuman\r\nsentence was reversed. John Rolfe, a friend of Argall, made light of the\r\naffair.[128:A]\r\n\r\nDuring this year, 1618, a ship called the Treasurer was sent out from\r\nEngland by Lord Rich, who had now become Earl of Warwick, a person of\r\ngreat note afterwards in the civil wars, and commander of the fleet\r\nagainst the king. This ship was manned with recruits from the colony,\r\nand dispatched on a semi-piratical cruise in the West Indies, where she\r\ncommitted some depredations on the Spanish possessions.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving intelligence of the death of Lord Delaware, the Virginia\r\nCompany appointed Captain George Yeardley, who was knighted upon this\r\noccasion, Governor and Captain-General of Virginia. Before his arrival\r\nin the colony Argall embarked for England, in a vessel laden with his\r\neffects, and being a relation of Sir Thomas Smith, and a partner in\r\ntrade of the profligate Earl of Warwick, he escaped with impunity. In\r\n1620 Argall commanded a ship-of-war in an expedition fitted out against\r\nthe Algerines, and in 1623 was knighted by King James. Argall's\r\ncharacter has been variously represented; he appears to have been an\r\nexpert mariner of talents, courage, enterprise, and energy, but selfish,\r\navaricious, unscrupulous, arbitrary and cruel.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1618, Powhatan died, being upwards of seventy years of age. He\r\nwas, perhaps, so called from one of his places of residence;[129:A] he\r\nwas also sometimes styled Ottaniack, and sometimes Mamanatowick,[129:B]\r\nbut his proper name was Wahunsonacock. The country subject to him was\r\ncalled Powhatan, as was likewise the chief river, and his subjects were\r\ncalled Powhatans. His hereditary domain consisted only of Powhatan,\r\nArrohattox, Appamatuck, Youghtanund, Pamunkey, and Matapony, together\r\nwith Werowocomoco and Kiskiack. All the rest were his conquests, and\r\nthey consisted of the country on the James River and its branches, from\r\nits mouth to the falls, and thence across the country to the north,\r\nnearly as high as the falls of all the great rivers over the Potomac, as\r\nfar as to the Patuxent in Maryland. Some nations on the Eastern Shore\r\nalso owned subjection to this mighty werowance. In each of his several\r\nhereditary dominions he had houses built like arbors, thirty or forty\r\nfeet long, and whenever he was about to visit one of these, it was\r\nsupplied beforehand with provision for his entertainment. The English\r\nfirst met with him at a place of his own name, (which it still retains,)\r\na short distance below the falls of James River, where now stands the\r\npicturesque City of Richmond.[129:C] His favorite residence was\r\nWerowocomoco, on the east bank of what is now known as Timberneck Bay,\r\non York River, in the County of Gloucester; but in his latter years,\r\ndisrelishing the increasing proximity of the English, he withdrew\r\nhimself to Orapakes, a hunting-town in the \"desert,\" as it was called,\r\nmore properly the wilderness, between the Chickahominy and the Pamunkey.\r\nIt is not improbable that he died and was buried there, for a mile from\r\nOrapakes, in the midst of the woods, he had a house where he kept his\r\ntreasure of furs, copper, pearl, and beads, \"which he storeth up against\r\nthe time of his death and burial.\"[130:A] This place is about twelve\r\nmiles northeast from Richmond.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the first settlement of the colony, Powhatan was usually\r\nattended, especially when asleep, by a body-guard of fifty tall\r\nwarriors; he afterwards augmented the number to about two hundred. He\r\nhad as many wives as he pleased, and when tired of any one of them, he\r\nbestowed her on some favorite. In the year 1608, by treachery, he\r\nsurprised the Payanketanks, his own subjects, while asleep in their\r\ncabins, massacred twenty-four men, and made prisoners their werowance\r\nwith the women and children, who were reduced to slavery. Captain Smith,\r\nhimself a prisoner, saw at Werowocomoco the scalps of the slain\r\nsuspended on a line between two trees. Powhatan caused certain\r\nmalefactors to be bound hand and foot, then a great quantity of burning\r\ncoals to be collected from a number of fires, and raked round in the\r\nform of a cock-pit, and the victims of his barbarity thrown in the midst\r\nand burnt to death.[130:B] He was not entirely destitute of some better\r\nqualities; in him some touches of princely magnanimity are curiously\r\nblended with huckstering cunning, and the tenderness of a doating father\r\nwith the cruelty of an unrelenting despot.\r\n\r\nPowhatan was succeeded by his second brother, Opitchapan, sometimes\r\ncalled Itopatin, or Oeatan, who, upon his accession, again changed his\r\nname to Sasawpen; as Opechancanough, upon the like occasion, changed\r\nhis to Mangopeomen. Opitchapan being decrepid in body and inert in mind,\r\nwas in a short time practically superseded in the government by his\r\nyounger, bolder, and more ambitious brother, the famous Opechancanough;\r\nthough for a time he was content to be styled the Werowance of\r\nChickahominy. Both renewed the assurances of continued friendship with\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125:A] Stith, 147.\r\n\r\n[126:A] Stith, 147.\r\n\r\n[126:B] Belknap, ii. 115.\r\n\r\n[126:C] Anderson's Hist. of Col.

He was born at Hayes, a farm in the\r\nParish of Budley, Devonshire, 1552, being the fourth son of Walter\r\nRaleigh, Esq., of Fardel, near Plymouth, and Catharine, daughter of Sir\r\nPhilip Champernon, and widow of Otho Gilbert, of Compton, Devonshire.\r\nAfter passing some time at Oriel College, Oxford, about the year 1568,\r\nwhere he distinguished himself by his genius and attainments, at the age\r\nof seventeen he joined a volunteer company of gentlemen, under Henry\r\nChampernon, in an expedition to assist the Protestant Queen of Navarre.\r\nHe remained in France five years, and while in Paris, under the\r\nprotection of the English embassy, he witnessed the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew's day. On returning to England he was for a while in the\r\nMiddle Temple; but whether as a student is uncertain. His leisure hours\r\nwere devoted to poetry. In the year 1578 he accompanied Sir John Norris\r\nto the Netherlands. In the following year he joined in Sir Humphrey\r\nGilbert's first and unsuccessful voyage. Now, when at the age of\r\ntwenty-seven, it is said that of the twenty-four hours he allotted four\r\nto study and only five to sleep; but this is rather improbable, for so\r\nmuch activity of employment as always characterized him, demanded a\r\nproportionate degree of repose. In 1580 he served in Ireland as captain\r\nof horse, under Lord Grey, and became familiar with the dangers and\r\natrocities of civil war. In 1581, the following year, he became\r\nacquainted with the poet Spenser, then resident at Kilcolman. Disgusted\r\nwith a painful service, Raleigh returned to England during this year,\r\nand it was at this period that he exhibited a famous piece of gallantry\r\nto the queen. She, in a walk, coming to a \"plashy place,\" hesitated to\r\nproceed, when he \"cast and spread his new plush cloak on the ground\" for\r\nher to tread on. By his graceful wit and fascinating manners, he rose\r\nrapidly in Elizabeth's favor, and \"she took him for a kind of oracle.\"\r\nHis munificent and persevering efforts in the colonization of Virginia\r\nought to have moderated the too sweeping charge of levity and fickleness\r\nbrought against him by Hume.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1583 Raleigh became member of Parliament for Devonshire;\r\nwas knighted, and made Seneschal of Cornwall and Warden of the\r\nStanneries. Engaged in the expedition whose object was to place Don\r\nAntonio on the throne of Portugal, Sir Walter for his good conduct\r\nreceived a gold chain from the queen. The rivalship of the Earl of Essex\r\nhaving driven Raleigh into temporary exile in Ireland, he there renewed\r\nhis acquaintance with the author of the \"Faëry Queen,\" who accompanied\r\nhim on his return to England.\r\n\r\nSir Walter was arrested in 1592, and confined in the Tower, on account\r\nof a criminal intrigue with one of the maids of honor, who was\r\nimprisoned at the same time; and this incident is alluded to in Sir\r\nWalter Scott's \"Fortunes of Nigel.\" The lady was Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nSir Nicholas Throckmorton, and a celebrated beauty, whom Raleigh\r\nafterwards married. In a letter written from the Tower, and addressed to\r\nSir Robert Cecil, Raleigh indulged in a vein of extravagant flattery of\r\nthe queen: \"I that was wont to behold her riding like Alexander, hunting\r\nlike Diana, walking like Venus--the gentle wind blowing her fair hair\r\nabout her pure cheeks like a nymph; sometime sitting in the shade like a\r\ngoddess; sometime singing like an angel; sometime playing like\r\nOrpheus.\" Elizabeth was at this time about sixty years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1593 she granted him the Manor of Sherborne, in Dorsetshire. About\r\nthis period he distinguished himself in the House of Commons. In 1595 he\r\ncommanded an expedition to Guiana, in quest of the golden El Dorado, and\r\nanother in the following year. In an expedition against Cadiz he led the\r\nvan in action, and received a severe wound in the leg. Upon his return\r\nto England he embarked in his third voyage to Guiana. In 1597 he was\r\nrestored to his place of captain of the guard, and entirely reinstated\r\nin the queen's favor.\r\n\r\nEssex having engaged in a rash treasonable conspiracy, the object of\r\nwhich was to seize upon the queen's person, so as thereby to control the\r\ngovernment, Raleigh aided in defeating his designs. But after the\r\nexecution of his popular rival, Raleigh's fortune began to wane.\r\nNevertheless, in 1600 he was made Governor of the Isle of Jersey. In the\r\nfollowing year, in a speech made in Parliament on an act for sowing\r\nhemp, Sir Walter said: \"For my part, I do not like this constraining of\r\nmen to manure or use their grounds at our wills, but rather let every\r\nman use his ground to that which it is most fit for, and therein use his\r\ndiscretion.\" Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, and Raleigh's happiness ended\r\nwith her life.\r\n\r\nJames the First came to the throne of Great Britain prejudiced against\r\nRaleigh. He was also at this time extremely unpopular, and especially\r\nodious to the friends of the highly gifted, but rash and unfortunate\r\nEarl of Essex. In three months after the arrival of King James in\r\nEngland, Sir Walter was arrested on a charge of high treason, in\r\nconspiring with the Lords Cobham and Grey to place the Lady Arabella\r\nStuart on the throne. Arraigned on charges frivolous and contradictory,\r\ntried under circumstances of insult and oppression, he was found guilty\r\nwithout any sufficient evidence. By their conduct on this occasion, Sir\r\nEdward Coke, Lord Chief Justice Popham, and Sir Robert Cecil proved\r\nthemselves fit tools for the abject and heartless James. Raleigh, though\r\nreprieved, remained a prisoner in the Tower at the king's mercy.\r\n\r\nLady Raleigh and her son were not excluded from the Tower, and Carew,\r\nthe youngest, was born there. During his long confinement, Sir Walter\r\ndevoted himself to literature and science, and enjoyed the society of a\r\nfew friends, among them Hariot and the Earl of Northumberland, who was\r\nlikewise a State prisoner. Sir Walter was also frequently visited by\r\nPrince Henry, the heir-apparent, who was devotedly attached to him, and\r\nwho said that \"none but his father would keep such a bird in a cage.\"\r\nPrince Charles, on the contrary, appears to have entertained a strong\r\ndislike to him. In the Tower Raleigh composed his great work, the\r\n\"History of the World,\" the first volume of which appeared in the year\r\n1614; it extended from the creation to the close of the Macedonian war,\r\nand embraced a period of about four thousand years. It was dedicated to\r\nPrince Henry. Raleigh intended to compose two other volumes, but owing\r\nto the untimely death of that prince, and to the suppression of it by\r\nKing James, on the ground that it censured princes too freely, and\r\nperhaps to the magnitude of the task, he proceeded no further than the\r\nfirst volume. Oliver Cromwell recommended this work to his son.\r\n\r\nDuring his confinement the king gave away Raleigh's estate of Sherborne\r\nto his favorite, Sir Robert Carr, afterwards the infamous Viscount\r\nRochester and Earl of Somerset, who swayed the influence at Court from\r\n1611 to 1615, when he was supplanted by the equally corrupt George\r\nVilliers, Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Raleigh, with her children around her, kneeling in tears,\r\nbesought James to restore this estate, the only answer she received was,\r\n\"I maun have the land, I maun have it for Carr.\" At length, owing in\r\npart to the death of some of his enemies, and in part to the influence\r\nof money, Sir Walter Raleigh was released from the Tower for the purpose\r\nof making another voyage to Guiana. The expedition failed in its object,\r\nand Sir Walter, after losing his son in an action with the Spaniards,\r\nreturned to England, where he was arrested.\r\n\r\nJames was now wholly bent on effecting a match between his son, Prince\r\nCharles, afterwards Charles the First, and the Spanish Infanta, and to\r\ngratify the Court of Spain and his own malignity, he resolved to\r\nsacrifice Raleigh. He was condemned, after a most eloquent defence,\r\nunder the old conviction of 1603, notwithstanding that he had been\r\nrecently commissioned commander of a fleet and Governor of Guiana,\r\nwhich had unquestionably annulled that conviction. \"He was condemned\r\n(said his son Carew) for being a friend of the Spaniards, and lost his\r\nlife for being their bitter enemy.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Anne, then in declining health, interceded for him, not long\r\nbefore his execution, in the following note, addressed to the Marquis of\r\nBuckingham:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY KIND DOG:--\r\n\r\n     \"If I have any power or credit with you, in dealing sincerely\r\n     and earnestly with the king, that Sir Walter Raleigh's life\r\n     may not be called in question. If you do it so that the\r\n     success answer my expectation, assure yourself that I will\r\n     take it extraordinarily kindly at your hands, and rest one\r\n     that wisheth you well, and desires you to continue still (as\r\n     you have been) a true servant to your master.\r\n\r\n                                            \"ANNE R.\"[136:A]\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh was executed on the twenty-ninth day of October,\r\n1618, in the Old Palace Yard. He died with Christian heroism.\r\nDistinguished as a navigator and discoverer, a naval and military\r\ncommander, an author in prose and verse, a wit, a courtier, a statesman\r\nand philosopher, there is perhaps in English history no name associated\r\nwith such lofty and versatile genius, so much glorious action, and so\r\nmuch wise reflection. He was indeed proud, fond of splendor, of a\r\nrestless and fiery ambition, sometimes unscrupulous. An ardent\r\nimagination, excited by the enthusiasm of an extraordinary age, infused\r\nan extravagance and marvellousness into some of his relations of his\r\nvoyages and discoveries, that gave some occasion for distrust. The ardor\r\nof his temperament and an over-excited imagination involved him in\r\nseveral projects that terminated unhappily. But with his weaknesses and\r\nhis faults he united noble virtues, and Virginia will ever be proud of\r\nso illustrious a founder.[136:B]\r\n\r\nThe Queen Anne, of Denmark, who had in vain employed her kind offices\r\nin his behalf, did not long survive him; she died in March, 1619.\r\nWithout any extraordinary qualities, she was accomplished, distinguished\r\nfor the easy elegance of her manners, amiable, and the generous friend\r\nof the oppressed and unfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136:A] Miss Strickland's Lives of Queens of England, vii. 357.\r\n\r\n[136:B] Oldy's Life of Raleigh, 74; Belknap, i. art.

Educated at Oxford\r\nunder the care of \"the judicious Hooker,\" he obtained a prebend in the\r\nchurch of York. He afterwards travelled in foreign countries, and\r\npublished his observations in a work entitled \"Europæ Speculum, or a\r\nView of the State of Religion in the Western World.\" He resigned his\r\nprebend in 1602, was subsequently knighted by James, in 1603, and\r\nemployed in diplomatic trusts. His appointment as treasurer gave great\r\nsatisfaction to the colony; for free principles were now, under his\r\nauspices, in the ascendant. His name is spelt sometimes Sandis,\r\nsometimes Sands. Sir Thomas Smith was shortly after reappointed, by the\r\nVirginia Company, President of the Somers Islands.\r\n\r\nWhen Argall, in April, stole away from Virginia, he left for his deputy,\r\nCaptain Nathaniel Powell,[138:B] who had come over with Captain Smith in\r\n1607, and had evinced courage and discretion. He was one of the writers\r\nfrom whose narratives Smith compiled his General History. Powell held\r\nhis office only about ten days, when Sir George Yeardley, recently\r\nknighted, arrived as Governor-General, bringing with him new charters\r\nfor the colony. He added to the council Captain Francis West, Captain\r\nNathaniel Powell, John Rolfe, William Wickham, and Samuel\r\nMacock.[139:A] John Rolfe, who had been secretary, now lost his place,\r\nprobably owing to his connivance at Argall's malepractices, and was\r\nsucceeded by John Pory. He was educated at Cambridge, where he took the\r\ndegree of Master of Arts, in April, 1610. It is supposed that he was a\r\nmember of the House of Commons. He was much of a traveller, and was at\r\nVenice in 1613, at Amsterdam in 1617, and shortly after at Paris. By the\r\nEarl of Warwick's influence he now procured the place of Secretary for\r\nthe Colony of Virginia, having come over in April, 1619, with Sir George\r\nYeardley, who appointed him one of his council.\r\n\r\nIn June, Governor Yeardley summoned the first legislative assembly that\r\never met in America. It assembled at James City or Jamestown, on Friday,\r\nthe 30th of July, 1619, upwards of a year before the Mayflower left\r\nEngland with the Pilgrims. A record of the proceedings is preserved in\r\nthe London State Paper Office, in the form of a Report from the Speaker,\r\nJohn Pory.[139:B]\r\n\r\nJohn Pory, Secretary of the Colony, was chosen Speaker, and John Twine,\r\nClerk. The Assembly sate in the choir of the church, the members of the\r\ncouncil sitting on either side of the Governor, and the Speaker right\r\nbefore him, the Clerk next the Speaker, and Thomas Pierse, the Sergeant,\r\nstanding at the bar.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing business, prayer was said by Mr. Bucke, the minister.\r\nEach burgess then, as called on, took the oath of supremacy. When the\r\nname of Captain Ward was called, the Speaker objected to him as having\r\nseated himself on land without authority. Objection was also made to the\r\nburgesses appearing to represent Captain Martin's patent, because they\r\nwere, by its terms, exempted from any obligation to obey the laws of the\r\ncolony. Complaint was made by Opochancano, that corn had been forcibly\r\ntaken from some of his people in the Chesapeake, by Ensign Harrison,\r\ncommanding a shallop belonging to this Captain John Martin, \"Master of\r\nthe Ordinance.\" The Speaker read the commission for establishing the\r\nCouncil of State and the General Assembly, and also the charter brought\r\nout by Sir Thomas Yeardley. This last was referred to several committees\r\nfor examination, so that if they should find anything \"not perfectly\r\nsquaring with the state of the colony, or any law pressing or binding\r\ntoo hard,\" they might by petition seek to have it redressed, \"especially\r\nbecause this great charter is to bind us and our heirs forever.\" Mr.\r\nAbraham Persey was the Cape-merchant. The price at which he was to\r\nreceive tobacco, \"either for commodities or upon bills,\" was fixed at\r\nthree shillings for the best and eighteen pence for the second rate.\r\nAfter inquiry the burgesses from Martin's patent were excluded, and the\r\nAssembly \"humbly demanded\" of the Virginia Company an explanation of\r\nthat clause in his patent entitling him to enjoy his lands as amply as\r\nany lord of a manor in England, adding, \"the least the Assembly can\r\nallege against this clause is, that it is obscure, and that it is a\r\nthing impossible for us here to know the prerogatives of all the manors\r\nin England.\" And they prayed that the clause in the charter guaranteeing\r\nequal liberties and immunities to grantees, might not be violated, so as\r\nto \"divert out of the true course the free and public current of\r\njustice.\" Thus did the first Assembly of Virginia insist upon the\r\nprinciple of the Declaration of Rights of 1776, that \"no man or set of\r\nmen are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from\r\nthe community, but in consideration of public services.\" Certain of the\r\ninstructions sent out from England were \"drawn into laws\" for protection\r\nof the Indians from injury, and regulating intercourse with them, and\r\neducating their children, and preparing some of the most promising boys\r\n\"for the college intended for them; that from thence they may be sent to\r\nthat work of conversion;\" for regulating agriculture, tobacco, and\r\nsassafras, then the chief merchantable commodities raised. Upon Captain\r\nPowell's petition, \"a lewd and treacherous servant of his\" was sentenced\r\nto stand for four days with his ears nailed to the pillory, and be\r\nwhipped each day. John Rolfe complained that Captain Martin had made\r\nunjust charges against him, and cast \"some aspersion upon the present\r\ngovernment, which is the most temperate and just that ever was in this\r\ncountry--too mild, indeed, for many of this colony, whom unwonted\r\nliberty hath made insolent, and not to know themselves.\" On the last day\r\nof the session were enacted such laws as issued \"out of every man's\r\nprivate conceit.\" \"It shall be free for every man to trade with the\r\nIndians, servants only excepted upon pain of whipping, unless the master\r\nwill redeem it off with the payment of an angel.\" \"No man to sell or\r\ngive any of the greater hoes to the Indians, or any English dog of\r\nquality, as a mastiff, greyhound, bloodhound, land or water spaniel.\"\r\nAny man selling arms or ammunition to the Indians, to be hanged so soon\r\nas the fact is proved. All ministers shall duly \"read divine service,\r\nand exercise their ministerial function according to the ecclesiastical\r\nlaws and orders of the Church of England, and every Sunday, in the\r\nafternoon, shall catechise such as are not ripe to come to the\r\ncommunion.\" All persons going up or down the James River were to touch\r\nat James City, \"to know whether the governor will command them any\r\nservice.\" \"All persons whatsoever, upon the Sabbath days, shall frequent\r\ndivine service and sermons, both forenoon and afternoon; and all such as\r\nbear arms shall bring their pieces, swords, powder, and shot.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Henry Spellman, charged by Robert Poole, interpreter, with\r\nspeaking ill of the governor \"at Opochancano's court,\" was degraded from\r\nhis rank of captain, and condemned to serve the colony for seven years\r\nas interpreter to the governor. Paspaheigh, embracing three hundred\r\nacres of land, was also called Argallstown, and was part of the tract\r\nappropriated to the governor. To compensate the speaker, clerk,\r\nsergeant, and provost marshal, a pound of the best tobacco was levied\r\nfrom every male above sixteen years of age. The Assembly prayed that the\r\ntreasurer, council, and company would not \"take it in ill part if these\r\nlaws, which we have now brought to light, do pass current, and be of\r\nforce till such time as we may know their further pleasure out of\r\nEngland; for otherwise this people (who now at length have got their\r\nreins of former servitude into their own swindge) would, in short time,\r\ngrow so insolent as they would shake off all government, and there would\r\nbe no living among them.\" They also prayed the company to \"give us power\r\nto allow or disallow of their orders of court, as his majesty hath given\r\n_them_ power to allow or reject _our_ laws.\" So early did it appear,\r\nthat from the necessity of the case, the colony must in large part\r\nlegislate for itself, and so early did a spirit of independence manifest\r\nitself. Owing to the heat of the weather, several of the burgesses fell\r\nsick, and one died, and thus the governor was obliged abruptly, on the\r\nfourth of August, to prorogue the Assembly till the first of\r\nMarch.[142:A] There being as yet no counties laid off, the\r\nrepresentatives were elected from the several towns, plantations, and\r\nhundreds, styled boroughs, and hence they were called burgesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[138:A] Court and Times of James the First, i. 161.\r\n\r\n[138:B] A Welsh name.\r\n\r\n[139:A] Macocks, the seat on James River, opposite to Berkley, was\r\ncalled after this planter, who was the first proprietor.\r\n\r\n[139:B] This interesting document, discovered by Mr. Bancroft, was\r\npublished by the New York Historical Society in 1857, and a number of\r\ncopies were sent to Richmond by George Henry Moore, Esq., Secretary of\r\nthat Society, for distribution among the members of the Assembly.

They were thought to have been\r\nvery judiciously framed, but the company's committee found them\r\n\"exceeding intricate and full of labor.\" There was granted to the old\r\nplanters an exemption from all compulsive service to the colony, with a\r\nconfirmation of their estates, which were to be holden as by English\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that from about 1614, for some seven years, James the\r\nFirst had governed England without a parliament; and the Virginia\r\nCompany was during this period a rallying point for the friends of civil\r\nand religious freedom, and the colony enjoyed the privilege, denied to\r\nthe mother country, of holding a legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nYeardley finding a scarcity of corn, undertook to promote the\r\ncultivation of it, and this year was blessed with abundant crops of\r\ngrain. But an extraordinary mortality carried off not less than three\r\nhundred of the people. Three thousand acres of land were allotted to the\r\ngovernor, and twelve thousand to the company. The Margaret, of Bristol,\r\narrived with some settlers, and \"also many devout gifts.\" The Trial\r\nbrought a cargo of corn and cattle. The expenditure of the Virginia\r\nCompany at this period, on account of the colony, was estimated at\r\nbetween four and five thousand pounds a year.\r\n\r\nA body of English Puritans, persecuted on account of their\r\nnonconformity, had, in 1608, sought an asylum in Holland. In 1617 they\r\nconceived the design of removing to America, and in 1619 they obtained\r\nfrom the Virginia Company, by the influence of Sir Edward Sandys, the\r\ntreasurer, \"a large patent,\" authorizing them to settle in Virginia.\r\nThey embarked in the latter part of the year 1620, in the Mayflower,\r\nintending to settle somewhere near the Hudson River, which lay within\r\nthe Virginia Company's territory. The Pilgrims were, however, conducted\r\nto the bleak and barren coast of Massachusetts, where they landed on the\r\ntwenty-second day of December, (new style,) 1620, on the rock of\r\nPlymouth. Thus, thirteen years after the settlement of Jamestown, was\r\nlaid the foundation of the New England States. The place of their\r\nlanding was beyond the limits of the Virginia Company.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1619, a Dutch man-of-war visited Jamestown and\r\nsold the settlers twenty negroes, the first introduced into Virginia.\r\nSome time before this, Captain Argall sent out, at the expense of the\r\nEarl of Warwick, on a \"filibustering\" cruise to the West Indies, a ship\r\ncalled the Treasurer, manned \"with the ablest men in the colony,\" under\r\nan old commission from the Duke of Savoy against the Spanish dominions\r\nin the western hemisphere. She returned to Virginia after some ten\r\nmonths, with her booty, which consisted of captured negroes, who were\r\nnot left in Virginia, because Captain Argall had gone back to England,\r\nbut were put on the Earl of Warwick's plantation in the Somer\r\nIslands.[144:A]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the planters who purchased the negroes from the\r\nDutch man-of-war reasoned but little on the morality of the act, or if\r\nany scruples of conscience presented themselves, they could be readily\r\nsilenced by reflecting that the negroes were heathens, descendants of\r\nHam, and consigned by Divine appointment to perpetual bondage.[145:A]\r\nThe planters may, if they reasoned at all on the subject, have supposed\r\nthat they were even performing a humane act in releasing these Africans\r\nfrom the noisome hold of the ship. They might well believe that the\r\ncondition of the negro slave would be less degraded and wretched in\r\nVirginia than it had been in their native country. This first purchase\r\nwas probably not looked upon as a matter of much consequence, and for\r\nseveral ages the increase of the blacks in Virginia was so\r\ninconsiderable as not to attract any special attention. The condition of\r\nthe white servants of the colony, many of them convicts, was so abject,\r\nthat men, accustomed to see their own race in bondage, could look with\r\nmore indifference at the worse condition of the slaves.\r\n\r\nThe negroes purchased by the slavers on the coast of Africa were brought\r\nfrom the interior, convicts sold into slavery, children sold by heathen\r\nparents destitute of natural affection, kidnapped villagers, and\r\ncaptives taken in war, the greater part of them born in hereditary\r\nbondage. The circumstances under which they were consigned to the\r\nslave-ship evince the wretchedness of their condition in their native\r\ncountry, where they were the victims of idolatry, barbarism, and war.\r\nThe negroes imported were usually between the ages of fourteen and\r\nthirty, two-thirds of them being males. The new negro, just transferred\r\nfrom the wilds of a distant continent, was indolent, ignorant of the\r\nmodes and implements of labor, and of the language of his master, and\r\nperhaps of his fellow-laborers.[145:B] To tame and domesticate, to\r\ninstruct in the modes of industry, and to reduce to subordination and\r\nusefulness a barbarian, gross, obtuse, perverse, must have demanded\r\npersevering efforts and severe discipline.\r\n\r\nWhile the cruel slave-trade was prompted by a remorseless cupidity, an\r\ninscrutable Providence turned the wickedness of men into the means of\r\nbringing about beneficent results. The system of slavery, doubtless,\r\nentailed many evils on slave and slave-holder, and, perhaps, the greater\r\non the latter. These evils are the tax paid for the elevation of the\r\nnegro from his aboriginal condition.\r\n\r\nAmong the vessels that came over to Virginia from England, about this\r\ntime, is mentioned a bark of five tons. A fleet sent out by the Virginia\r\nCompany brought over, in 1619, more than twelve hundred settlers.[146:A]\r\nThe planters at length enjoyed the blessings of property in the soil,\r\nand the society of women. The wives were sold to the colonists for one\r\nhundred and twenty pounds of tobacco, and it was ordered that this debt\r\nshould have precedence of all others. The price of a wife afterwards\r\nbecame higher. The bishops in England, by the king's orders, collected\r\nnearly fifteen hundred pounds to build a college or university at\r\nHenrico, intended in part for the education of Indian children.[146:B]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1620, the population of the colony was estimated at four\r\nthousand. One hundred \"disorderly persons\" or convicts, sent over during\r\nthe previous year by the king's order, were employed as servants.[147:A]\r\nFor a brief interval the Virginia Company had enjoyed freedom of trade\r\nwith the Low Countries, where they sold their tobacco; but in October,\r\n1621, this was prohibited by an order in council; and from this time\r\nEngland claimed a monopoly of the trade of her plantations, and this\r\nprinciple was gradually adopted by all the European powers as they\r\nacquired transatlantic settlements.[147:B]\r\n\r\nTwo persons unknown presented plate and ornaments for the\r\ncommunion-table at the college, and at Mrs. Mary Robinson's Church, so\r\ncalled because she had contributed two hundred pounds toward the\r\nfounding of it. Another person unknown gave five hundred and fifty\r\npounds for the education of Indian children in Christianity; he\r\nsubscribed himself \"Dust and Ashes;\" and was afterwards discovered to be\r\nMr. Gabriel Barber, a member of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[144:A] Belknap, art.

It has never been\r\npublished until recently, and is the first document of the kind ever\r\nissued in England for the benefit of the colonies. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Most reverend father in God, right, trusty, and well-beloved\r\n     counsellor, we greet you well. You have heard ere this time of\r\n     the attempt of divers worthy men, our subjects, to plant in\r\n     Virginia, (under the warrant of our letters patents,) people\r\n     of this kingdom as well as for the enlarging of our dominions,\r\n     as for the propagation of the gospel amongst infidels: wherein\r\n     there is good progress made and hope of further increase; so\r\n     as the undertakers of that plantation are now in hand with the\r\n     erecting of some churches and schools for the education of the\r\n     children of those barbarians, which cannot but be to them a\r\n     very great charge and above the expense which, for the civil\r\n     plantation, doth come to them. In which we doubt not but that\r\n     you and all others who wish well to the increase of Christian\r\n     religion, will be willing to give all assistance and\r\n     furtherance, you may, and therein to make experience of the\r\n     zeal and devotion of our well-minded subjects, especially\r\n     those of the clergy. Wherefore we do require you, and hereby\r\n     authorize you to write your letters to the several bishops of\r\n     the dioceses in your province, that they do give order to the\r\n     ministers and other zealous men of their dioceses, both by\r\n     their own example in contribution and by exhortation to others\r\n     to move our people within their several charges to contribute\r\n     to so good a work, in as liberal a manner as they may; for the\r\n     better advancing whereof our pleasure is, that those\r\n     collections be made in all the particular parishes, four\r\n     several times within these two years next coming; and that the\r\n     several accounts of each parish, together with the moneys\r\n     collected, be returned from time to time to the bishops of the\r\n     dioceses, and by them be transmitted half yearly to you; and\r\n     so to be delivered to the treasurer of that plantation to be\r\n     employed for the godly purposes intended, and no other.\"\r\n     (_Anderson's Hist. of Col. Church_, i. 315; _Stith's Hist. of\r\n     Va._, 159.)\r\n\r\n[147:A] Mr. Jefferson appears to have fallen into a mistake as to the\r\nperiod of time when malefactors were first shipped over to this country\r\nfrom England, for he says: \"It was at a late period of their history\r\nthat the practice began.\" (_Writings of Jefferson_, i. 405.)\r\n\r\n[147:B] Chalmers' Introduc., i. 15.

There are nearly fifty\r\n     more that are shortly to come, and are sent by our honorable\r\n     lord and treasurer, the Earl of Southampton, and certain\r\n     worthy gentlemen, who, taking into consideration that the\r\n     plantation can never flourish till families be planted, and\r\n     the respect of wives and children for their people on the\r\n     soil, therefore having given this fair beginning; reimbursing\r\n     of whose charges it is ordered that every man that marries\r\n     them, give one hundred and twenty pounds of best leaf tobacco\r\n     for each of them.\r\n\r\n     \"We desire that the marriage be free according to nature, and\r\n     we would not have those maids deceived and married to\r\n     servants, but only to such freemen or tenants as have means to\r\n     maintain them. We pray you, therefore, to be fathers of them\r\n     in this business, not enforcing them to marry against their\r\n     wills.\" (_Hubbard's note in Belknap_, art.

The election was by ballot. The day for it having arrived, the\r\ncompany met, consisting of twenty peers of the realm, near one hundred\r\nknights, together with as many more of gallant officers and grave\r\nlawyers, and a large number of worthy citizens--an imposing array of\r\nrank, and wealth, and talents, and influence. Sir Edwin Sandys being\r\nfirst nominated as a candidate, a lord of the bedchamber and another\r\ncourtier announced that it was the king's pleasure not to have Sir Edwin\r\nSandys chosen; and because he was unwilling to infringe their right of\r\nelection, he (the king) would nominate three persons, and permit the\r\ncompany to choose one of them. The company, nevertheless, voted to\r\nproceed to an election, as they had a right to do under the charter. Sir\r\nEdwin Sandys withdrew his name from nomination, and, at his suggestion\r\nit was finally agreed that the king's messengers should name two\r\ncandidates, and the company one. Upon counting the ballots, it was\r\nascertained that one of the royal candidates received only one vote, and\r\nthe other only two. The Earl of Southampton received all the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Company was divided into two parties, the minority enjoying\r\nthe favor of the king, and headed by the Earl of Warwick; the other, the\r\nliberal, or opposition, or reform party, headed by the Earl of\r\nSouthampton. The Warwick faction were greatly embittered against\r\nYeardley, and their virulence was increased by his having intercepted a\r\npacket from his own secretary, Pory, containing proofs of Argall's\r\nmisconduct, to be used against him at his trial, which the secretary\r\nhad been bribed by his friend, the Earl of Warwick, to convey to him.\r\nThe mild and gentle Yeardley, overcome by these annoyances, at length\r\nrequested leave to retire from the cares of office. His commission\r\nexpired in November, 1621; but he continued in the colony, was a member\r\nof the council, and enjoyed the respect and esteem of the people. During\r\nhis short administration, many new settlements were made on the James\r\nand York rivers; and the planters, being now supplied with wives and\r\nservants, began to be more content, and to take more pleasure in\r\ncultivating their lands. The brief interval of free trade with Holland\r\nhad enlarged the demand for tobacco, and it was cultivated more\r\nextensively.\r\n\r\nSir George Yeardley's term of office having expired, the company's\r\ncouncil, upon the recommendation of the Earl of Southampton, appointed\r\nSir Francis Wyat governor, a young gentleman of Ireland, whose\r\neducation, family, fortune, and integrity, well qualified him for the\r\nplace. He arrived in October, 1621, with a fleet of nine sail, and\r\nbrought over a new frame of government constituted by the company, and\r\ndated July the 24th, 1621, establishing a council of State and a general\r\nassembly--vesting the governor with a negative upon the acts of the\r\nassembly; this body to be convoked by him in general once a year, and to\r\nconsist of the council of State and of two burgesses from every town,\r\nhundred, or plantation; the trial by jury secured; no act of the\r\nassembly to be valid unless ratified by the company in England; and, on\r\nthe other hand, no order of the company to be obligatory upon the colony\r\nwithout the consent of the assembly. This last feature displays that\r\nspirit of constitutional freedom which then pervaded the Virginia\r\nCompany. A commission bearing the same date with the new frame of\r\ngovernment recognized Sir Francis Wyat as the first governor under it;\r\nand this famous ordinance became the model of every subsequent\r\nprovincial form of government in the Anglo-American colonies.[150:A]\r\n\r\nWyat brought with him also a body of instructions intended for the\r\npermanent guidance of the governor and council. He was to provide for\r\nthe service of God in conformity with the Church of England as near as\r\nmay be; to be obedient to the king, and to administer justice according\r\nto the laws of England; not to injure the natives, and to forget old\r\nquarrels now buried; to be industrious, and to suppress drunkenness,\r\ngaming, and excess in clothes; not to permit any but the council and\r\nheads of hundreds to wear gold in their clothes, or to wear silk, till\r\nthey make it themselves; not to offend any foreign prince; to punish\r\npirates; to build forts; to endeavor to convert the heathen; and each\r\ntown to teach some of the Indian children fit for the college which was\r\nto be built; to cultivate corn, wine, and silk; to search for minerals,\r\ndyes, gums, and medicinal drugs, and to draw off the people from the\r\nexcessive planting of tobacco; to take a census of the colony; to put\r\n'prentices to trades and not let them forsake them for planting tobacco,\r\nor any such useless commodity; to build water-mills; to make salt,\r\npitch, tar, soap, and ashes; to make oil of walnuts, and employ\r\napothecaries in distilling lees of beer; to make small quantity of\r\ntobacco, and that very good.\r\n\r\nWyat, entering on the duties of his office on the eighteenth of\r\nNovember, dispatched Mr. Thorpe to renew the treaties of peace and\r\nfriendship with Opechancanough, who was found apparently well affected\r\nand ready to confirm the pledges of harmony. A vessel from Ireland\r\nbrought in eighty immigrants, who planted themselves at Newport's News.\r\nThe company sent out during this year twenty-one vessels, navigated with\r\nupwards of four hundred sailors, and bringing over thirteen hundred men,\r\nwomen, and children. The aggregate number of settlers that arrived\r\nduring 1621 and 1622 was three thousand five hundred.\r\n\r\nWith Sir Francis Wyat came over George Sandys, treasurer in Virginia,\r\nbrother of Sir Edwin Sandys, treasurer of the company in England. George\r\nSandys, who was born in 1577, after passing some time at Oxford, in\r\n1610, travelled over Europe to Turkey, and visited Palestine and Egypt.\r\nHe published his travels, at Oxford, in 1615, and they were received\r\nwith great favor. The first poetical production in Anglo-American\r\nliterature was composed by him, while secretary of the colony; and in\r\nthe midst of the confusion which followed the massacre of 1622,--\"by\r\nthat imperfect light which was snatched from the hours of night and\r\nrepose,\"--he translated the Metamorphoses of Ovid and the First Book of\r\nVirgil's Æneid, which was published in 1626, and dedicated to King\r\nCharles the First. He also published several other works, and enjoyed\r\nthe favor of the literary men of the day. Dryden pronounced Sandys the\r\nbest versifier of his age. Pope declared that English poetry owed much\r\nof its beauty to his translations; and Montgomery, the poet, renders his\r\nmeed of praise to the beauty of the Psalms translated by him. Having\r\nlived chiefly in retirement, he died in 1643, at the house of Sir\r\nFrancis Wyat, in Bexley, Kent. A fine copy of the translation of Ovid\r\nand Virgil, printed in 1632, in folio, elegantly illustrated, once the\r\nproperty of the Duke of Sussex, is now in the library of Mr. Grigsby.\r\nMr. Thomas H. Wynne, of Richmond, also has a copy of this rare work.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150:A] Chalmers' Introduc., i. 13-16; Belknap, art.

During the year 1619\r\nthe company in England imported twenty thousand pounds of tobacco, the\r\nentire crop of the preceding year. James the First endeavored to draw a\r\n\"prerogative\" revenue from what he termed a pernicious weed, and against\r\nwhich he had published his \"Counterblast;\" but he was restrained from\r\nthis illegal measure by a resolution of the House of Commons. In 1607 he\r\nsent a letter forbidding the use of tobacco at St. Mary's College,\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nSmoking was the first mode of using tobacco in England, and when Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh first introduced the custom among people of fashion, in\r\norder to escape observation he smoked privately in his house, (at\r\nIslington,) the remains of which were till of late years to be seen, as\r\nan inn, long known as the Pied Bull. This was the first house in England\r\nin which it was smoked, and Raleigh had his arms emblazoned there, with\r\na tobacco-plant on the top. There existed also another tradition in the\r\nParish of St. Matthew, Friday Street, London, that Raleigh was\r\naccustomed to sit smoking at his door in company with Sir Hugh\r\nMiddleton. Sir Walter's guests were entertained with pipes, a mug of\r\nale, and a nutmeg, and on these occasions he made use of his\r\ntobacco-box, which was of cylindrical form, seven inches in diameter and\r\nthirteen inches long; the outside of gilt leather, and within a receiver\r\nof glass or metal, which held about a pound of tobacco. A kind of collar\r\nconnected the receiver with the case, and on every side the box was\r\npierced with holes for the pipes. This relic was preserved in the museum\r\nof Ralph Thoresby, of Leeds, in 1719, and about 1843 was added, by the\r\nlate Duke of Sussex, to his collection of the smoking utensils of all\r\nnations.[154:A]\r\n\r\nAlthough Sir Walter Raleigh first introduced the custom of smoking\r\ntobacco in England, yet its use appears to have been not entirely\r\nunknown before, for one Kemble, condemned for heresy in the time of\r\nQueen Mary the Bloody, while walking to the stake smoked a pipe of\r\ntobacco. Hence the last pipe that one smokes was called the Kemble pipe.\r\n\r\nThe writer of a pamphlet, supposed to have been Milton's father,\r\ndescribes many of the play-books and pamphlets of that day, 1609, as\r\n\"conceived over night by idle brains, impregnated with tobacco smoke and\r\nmulled sack, and brought forth by the help of midwifery of a caudle next\r\nmorning.\" At the theatres in Shakespeare's time, the spectators were\r\nallowed to sit on the stage, and to be attended by pages, who furnished\r\nthem with pipes and tobacco.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the settlement of Jamestown, in 1607, the\r\ncharacteristics of a man of fashion were, to wear velvet breeches, with\r\npanes or slashes of silk, an enormous starched ruff, a gilt-handled\r\nsword, and a Spanish dagger; to play at cards or dice in the chamber of\r\nthe groom-porter, and to smoke tobacco in the tilt-yard, or at the\r\nplayhouse.\r\n\r\nThe peers engaged in the trial of the Earls of Essex and Southampton\r\nsmoked much while they deliberated on their verdict. It was alleged\r\nagainst Sir Walter Raleigh that he used tobacco on the occasion of the\r\nexecution of the Earl of Essex, in contempt of him; and it was perhaps\r\nin allusion to this circumstance that when Raleigh was passing through\r\nLondon to Winchester, to stand his trial, he was followed by the\r\nexecrations of the populace, and pelted with tobacco-pipes, stones, and\r\nmud. On the scaffold, however, he protested that during the execution of\r\nEssex he had retired far off into the armory, where Essex could not see\r\nhim, although he saw Essex, and shed tears for him. Raleigh used tobacco\r\non the morning of his own execution.\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 1610 tobacco was in general use in England. The\r\nmanner of using it was partly to inhale the smoke and blow it out\r\nthrough the nostrils, and this was called \"drinking tobacco,\" and this\r\npractice continued until the latter part of the reign of James the\r\nFirst. In 1614 the number of tobacco-houses in or near London was\r\nestimated at seven thousand. In 1620 was chartered the Society of\r\nTobacco-pipe Makers of London; they bore on their shield a tobacco-plant\r\nin full blossom.\r\n\r\nThe \"Counterblast against Tobacco,\" attributed to James the First, if in\r\nsome parts absurd and puerile, yet is not without a good deal of just\r\nreasoning and good sense; some fair hits are made in it, and those who\r\nhave ridiculed that production might find it not easy to controvert some\r\nof its views. King James, in his Counterblast, does not omit the\r\nopportunity of expressing his hatred toward Sir Walter Raleigh, in terms\r\nworthy of that despicable monarch. He continued his opposition to\r\ntobacco as long as he lived, and in his ordinary conversation oftentimes\r\nargued and inveighed against it.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia tobacco in early times was imported into England in the\r\nleaf, in bundles, as at present; the Spanish or West Indian tobacco in\r\nballs. Molasses or other liquid preparation was used in preparing those\r\nballs. Tobacco was then, as now, adulterated in various ways. The nice\r\nretailer kept it in what were called lily-pots, that is, white jars. The\r\ntobacco was cut on a maple block; juniper-wood, which retains fire well,\r\nwas used for lighting pipes, and among the rich silver tongs were\r\nemployed for taking up a coal of it. Tobacco was sometimes called the\r\nAmerican Silver Weed.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Vizier thrust pipes through the noses of smokers; and the\r\nShah of Persia cropped the ears and slit the noses of those who made use\r\nof the fascinating leaf. The Counterblast says of it: \"And for the\r\nvanity committed in this filthy custom, is it not both great vanity and\r\nuncleanness, that at the table--a place of respect of cleanliness, of\r\nmodesty--men should not be ashamed to sit tossing of tobacco-pipes and\r\npuffing of smoke, one at another, making the filthy smoke and stink\r\nthereof to exhale athwart the dishes, and infect the air, when very\r\noften men who abhor it are at their repast? Surely smoke becomes a\r\nkitchen far better than a dining-chamber; and yet it makes the kitchen\r\noftentimes in the inward parts of man, soiling and infecting them with\r\nan unctuous and oily kind of soot, as hath been found in some great\r\ntobacco-takers that after their deaths were opened.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Counterblast to Tobacco,\" by James the First, King of England, was\r\nfirst printed in quarto, without name or date, at London, 1616. In the\r\nfrontispiece was engraved the tobacco-smoker's coat of arms, consisting\r\nof a blackamoor's head, cross-pipes, cross-bones, death's-head, etc. It\r\nis not improbable that it was intended to foment the popular prejudice\r\nagainst Sir Walter Raleigh, who first introduced the use of tobacco into\r\nEngland, and who was put to death in the same year, 1616. King James\r\nalludes to the introduction of the use of tobacco and of Raleigh as\r\nfollows: \"It is not so long since the first entry of this abuse among us\r\nhere, as that this present age cannot very well remember both the first\r\nauthor and the form of the first introduction of it among us. It was\r\nneither brought in by king, great conqueror, nor learned doctor of\r\nphysic. With the report of a great discovery for a conquest, some two or\r\nthree savage men were brought in together with this savage custom; but\r\nthe pity is, the poor wild barbarous men died, but that vile barbarous\r\ncustom is still alive, yea, in fresh vigor; so as it seems a miracle to\r\nme how a custom springing from so vile a ground, and brought in by a\r\nfather so generally hated, should be welcomed upon so slender a\r\nwarrant.\"\r\n\r\nThe king thus reasons against the Virginia staple: \"Secondly, it is, as\r\nyou use or rather abuse it, a branch of the sin of drunkenness, which is\r\nthe root of all sins,[156:A] for as the only delight that drunkards love\r\nany weak or sweet drink, so are not those (I mean the strong heat and\r\nfume) the only qualities that make tobacco so delectable to all the\r\nlovers of it? And as no man loves strong heavy drinks the first day,\r\n(because nemo repente fuit turpissimus,) but by custom is piece and\r\npiece allured, while in the end a drunkard will have as great a thirst\r\nto be drunk as a sober man to quench his thirst with a draught when he\r\nhath need of it; so is not this the true case of all the great takers of\r\ntobacco, which therefore they themselves do attribute to a bewitching\r\nquality in it? Thirdly, is it not the greatest sin of all that you, the\r\npeople of all sorts of this kingdom, who are created and ordained by God\r\nto bestow both your persons and goods for the maintenance both of the\r\nhonor and safety of your king and commonwealth, should disable yourself\r\nto this shameful imbecility, that you are not able to ride or walk the\r\njourney of a Jew's Sabbath but you must have a reeky coal brought you\r\nfrom the next poor-house to kindle your tobacco with? whereas he cannot\r\nbe thought able for any service in the wars that cannot endure oftimes\r\nthe want of meat, drink, and sleep; much more then must he endure the\r\nwant of tobacco.\" A curious tractate on tobacco, by Dr. Tobias Venner,\r\nwas published at London in 1621. The author was a graduate of Oxford,\r\nand a physician at Bath, and is mentioned in the Oxoniæ\r\nAthenienses.[157:A]\r\n\r\nThe amount of tobacco imported in 1619 into England, from Virginia,\r\nbeing the entire crop of the preceding year, was twenty thousand pounds.\r\nAt the end of seventy years there were annually imported into England\r\nmore than fifteen millions of pounds of it, from which was derived a\r\nrevenue of upwards of £100,000.[157:B]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1621, the House of Commons debated whether it was expedient to\r\nprohibit the importation of tobacco entirely; and they determined to\r\nexclude all save from Virginia and the Somer Isles. It was estimated\r\nthat the consumption of England amounted to one thousand pounds per\r\ndiem. This seductive narcotic leaf, which soothes the mind and quiets\r\nits perturbations, has found its way into all parts of the habitable\r\nglobe, from the sunny tropics to the snowy regions of the frozen pole.\r\nIts fragrant smoke ascends alike to the blackened rafters of the lowly\r\nhut, and the gilded ceilings of luxurious wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[154:A] Introduction to \"A Counterblast to Tobacco, by James the First,\r\nKing of England,\" published at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1843.\r\n\r\n[156:A] And one from which the king himself was not free.\r\n\r\n[157:A] A copy of this rare pamphlet was lent me by N.

Mr. Copeland, Chaplain on board of the Royal James, East\r\nIndiaman, on the return voyage from the East Indies, prevailed upon the\r\nofficers and crew of that ship to contribute seventy pounds toward the\r\nestablishment of a church and school in Virginia, and Charles City\r\nCounty was selected as the site of it, and it was to be called the East\r\nIndia School, and to be dependent upon the college at Henrico. The\r\nVirginia Company allotted one thousand acres of land for the maintenance\r\nof the master and usher, and presented three hundred acres to Mr.\r\nCopeland. Workmen were accordingly sent out early in 1622, to begin the\r\nbuilding. The clergymen in Virginia at this time were Messrs. Whitaker,\r\nMease, Wickham, Stockham, and Bargrave.[158:A]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1622 very favorable intelligence from Virginia reached\r\nEngland, and upon this occasion, on the seventeenth of April, the Rev.\r\nMr. Copeland, by appointment, preached before the Virginia Company, at\r\nBow Church. He was shortly afterwards appointed a member of the Virginia\r\nCouncil and rector of the college established for the conversion of the\r\nIndians; but all these benevolent purposes and hopeful anticipations\r\nwere suddenly darkened and defeated by the news of a catastrophe which\r\nhad, in a few hours, blasted the labors of so many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158:A] The following is found in the early records:--\r\n\r\n     THE CORPORATION OF HENRICO.\r\n\r\n     On the northerly ridge of James River, from the falls down to\r\n     Henrico, containing ten miles in length, are the public lands,\r\n     surveyed and laid out; whereof, ten thousand acres for the\r\n     university lands, three thousand acres for the company's\r\n     lands, with other lands belonging to the college.

He was reckoned by his own people\r\ninvulnerable to the arms of the English. This Nemattanow coming to the\r\nstore of one of the settlers named Morgan, persuaded him to go to\r\nPamunkey to trade, and murdered him by the way. Nemattanow, in two or\r\nthree days, returned to Morgan's house, and finding there two young men,\r\nMorgan's servants, who inquired for their master, answered them that he\r\nwas dead. The young men, seeing their master's cap on the Indian's head,\r\nsuspected the murder, and undertook to conduct him to Mr. Thorpe, who\r\nthen lived at Berkley, on the James River, since well known as a seat of\r\nthe Harrisons, and originally called \"Brickley.\" Nemattanow so\r\nexasperated the young men on the way that they shot him, and he falling,\r\nthey put him into a boat and conveyed him to the governor at Jamestown,\r\ndistant seven or eight miles. The wounded chief in a short time died.\r\nFeeling the approaches of death, he entreated the young men not to\r\ndisclose that he had been mortally wounded by a bullet: so strong is the\r\ndesire for posthumous fame even in the breast of a wild, untutored\r\nsavage!\r\n\r\nOpechancanough, the ferocious Indian chief, agitated with mingled\r\nemotions of grief and indignation at the loss of his favorite\r\nNemattanow, at first muttered threats of revenge; but the retorted\r\ndefiance of the English made him for a time smother his resentment and\r\ndissemble his dark designs under the guise of friendship. Accordingly,\r\nupon Sir Francis Wyat's arrival, all suspicion of Indian treachery had\r\ndied away; the colonists, in delusive security, were in general\r\ndestitute of arms; the plantations lay dispersed, as caprice suggested,\r\nor a rich vein of land allured, as for as the Potomac River;[161:A]\r\ntheir houses everywhere open to the Indians, who fed at their tables and\r\nlodged under their roofs. About the middle of March, a messenger being\r\nsent upon some occasion to Opechancanough, he entertained him kindly,\r\nand protested that he held the peace so firm that \"the sky should fall\r\nbefore he broke it.\" On the twentieth of the same month, the Indians\r\nguided some of the English safely through the forest, and the more\r\ncompletely to lull all suspicion, they sent one Brown, who was\r\nsojourning among them for the purpose of learning their language, back\r\nhome to his master. They even borrowed boats from the whites to cross\r\nthe river when about holding a council on the meditated attack. The\r\nmassacre took place on Friday, the twenty-second of March, 1622. On the\r\nevening before, and on that very morning, the Indians, as usual, came\r\nunarmed into the houses of the unsuspecting colonists, with fruits,\r\nfish, turkeys, and venison for sale: in some places they actually sate\r\ndown to breakfast with the English. At about the hour of noon the\r\nsavages, rising suddenly and everywhere at the same time, butchered the\r\ncolonists with their own implements, sparing neither age, nor sex, nor\r\ncondition; and thus fell in a few hours three hundred and forty-nine\r\nmen, women, and children. The infuriated savages wreaked their vengeance\r\neven on the dead, dragging and mangling the lifeless bodies, smearing\r\ntheir hands in blood, and bearing off the torn and yet palpitating limbs\r\nas trophies of a brutal triumph.\r\n\r\nAmong their victims was Mr. George Thorpe, (a kinsman of Sir Thomas\r\nDale,) who had been of the king's bedchamber, deputy to the college\r\nlands, and one of the principal men of the colony--a pious gentleman,\r\nwho had labored zealously for the conversion of the Indians, and had\r\ntreated them with uniform kindness. As an instance of this, they having\r\nat one time expressed their fears of the English mastiff dogs, he had\r\ncaused some of them to be put to death, to the great displeasure of\r\ntheir owners. Opechancanough inhabiting a paltry cabin, Mr. Thorpe had\r\nbuilt him a handsome house after the English manner.[162:A] But the\r\nsavage miscreants, equally deaf to the voice of humanity and the\r\nemotions of gratitude, murdered their benefactor with every circumstance\r\nof remorseless cruelty. He had been forewarned of his danger by a\r\nservant, but making no effort to escape, fell a victim to his misplaced\r\nconfidence. With him ten other persons were slain at Berkley.\r\n\r\nAnother of the victims was Captain Nathaniel Powell, one of the first\r\nsettlers, a brave soldier, and who had for a brief interval filled the\r\nplace of governor of the colony. His family fell with him. Nathaniel\r\nCausie, another of Captain Smith's old soldiers, when severely wounded\r\nand surrounded by the Indians, slew one of them with an axe, and put the\r\nrest to flight. At Warrasqueake a colonist named Baldwin, by repeatedly\r\nfiring his gun, saved himself and family, and divers others. The savages\r\nat the same time made an attempt upon the house of a planter named\r\nHarrison, (near Baldwin's,) where were Thomas Hamor with some men, and a\r\nnumber of women and children. The Indians tried to inveigle Hamor out of\r\nthe house, by pretending that Opechancanough was hunting in the\r\nneighboring woods and desired to have his company; but he not coming\r\nout, they set fire to a tobacco-house; the men ran toward the fire, and\r\nwere pursued by the Indians, who pierced them with arrows and beat out\r\ntheir brains. Hamor having finished a letter that he was writing, and\r\nsuspecting no treachery, went out to see what was the matter, when,\r\nbeing wounded in the back with an arrow, he returned to the house and\r\nbarricaded it. Meanwhile Harrison's boy, finding his master's gun\r\nloaded, fired it at random, and the Indians fled. Baldwin still\r\ncontinuing to discharge his gun, Hamor, with twenty-two others, withdrew\r\nto his house, leaving their own in flames. Hamor next retired to a new\r\nhouse that he was building, and there defending himself with spades,\r\naxes, and brickbats, escaped the fury of the savages. The master of a\r\nvessel lying in the James River sent a file of musqueteers ashore, who\r\nrecaptured from the enemy the Merchant's store-house. In the\r\nneighborhood of Martin's Hundred seventy-three persons were butchered;\r\nyet a small family there escaped, and heard nothing of the massacre\r\nuntil two days after.\r\n\r\nThus fell in so short a space of time one-twelfth part of the colonists\r\nof Virginia, including six members of the council. The destruction might\r\nhave been universal but for the disclosure of a converted Indian, named\r\nChanco, who, during the night preceding the massacre, revealed the plot\r\nto one Richard Pace, with whom he lived. Pace, upon receiving this\r\nintelligence, after fortifying his own house, repaired before day to\r\nJamestown, and gave the alarm to Sir Francis Wyat, the Governor; his\r\nvigilance saved a large part of the colony from destruction.[163:A]\r\nEleven were killed at Berkley, fifty at Edward Bonit's plantation, two\r\nat Westover, five at Macocks, four on Appomattox River, six at\r\nFlower-de-Hundred, twenty-one of Sir George Yeardley's people at\r\nWeyanoke, and seventy-three at Martin's Hundred, seven miles from\r\nJamestown.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of famine threatened to follow in the train of massacre, and\r\nthe consternation of the survivors was such that twenty or thirty days\r\nelapsed before any plan of defence was concerted. Many were urgent to\r\nabandon the James River, and take refuge on the eastern shore, where\r\nsome newly settled plantations had escaped. At length it was determined\r\nto abandon the weaker plantations, and to concentrate their surviving\r\npopulation in five or six well fortified places, Shirley,\r\nFlower-de-Hundred, Jamestown, with Paspahey, and the plantations\r\nopposite to Kiquotan, and Southampton Hundred. In consequence a large\r\npart of the cattle and effects of the planters fell a prey to the enemy.\r\nNevertheless, a planter, \"Master Gookins,\" at Newport's News, refused to\r\nabandon his plantation, and with thirty-five men resolutely held it.\r\n\r\nThe family of Gookins is ancient, and appears to have been found\r\noriginally at Canterbury, in Kent, England. The name has undergone\r\nsuccessive changes--Colkin, Cockin, Cockayn, Cocyn, Cokain, Cokin,\r\nGockin, Gokin, Gookin, Gookins, Gooking, and others. The early New\r\nEngland chroniclers spelled it \"Goggin.\"[164:A] Daniel Gookin removed to\r\nCounty Cork, in Ireland, and thence to Virginia, arriving in November,\r\n1621, with fifty men of his own and thirty passengers, exceedingly well\r\nfurnished with all sorts of provision and cattle, and planted himself at\r\nNewport's News. In the massacre he held out with a force of thirty-five\r\nmen against the savages, disregarding the order to retire. It is\r\nprobable that he affected to make a settlement independent of the civil\r\npower of the colony, and it appears to have been styled by his son a\r\n\"lordship.\" It was above Newport's News, and was called \"Mary's\r\nMount.\"[164:B]\r\n\r\nTo return to the incidents of the massacre. Samuel Jordan, with the aid\r\nof a few refugees, maintained his ground at Beggar's Bush;[164:C] as\r\nalso did Mr. Edward Hill, at Elizabeth City. \"Mrs. Proctor, a proper,\r\ncivil, modest gentlewoman,\" defended herself and family for a month\r\nafter the massacre, until at last constrained to retire by the English\r\nofficers, who threatened, if she refused, to burn her house down; which\r\nwas done by the Indians shortly after her withdrawal. Captain Newce, of\r\nElizabeth City, and his wife, distinguished themselves by their\r\nliberality to the sufferers. Several families escaped to the country\r\nafterwards known as North Carolina, and settled there.[164:D]\r\n\r\nWhen intelligence of this event reached England, the king granted the\r\nVirginia Company some unserviceable arms out of the Tower, and \"_lent_\r\nthem twenty barrels of powder;\" Lord St. John of Basing gave sixty coats\r\nof mail; the privy council sent out supplies, and the City of London\r\ndispatched one hundred settlers.[165:A]\r\n\r\nOne effect of the massacre was the ruin of the iron-works at Falling\r\nCreek, on the south side of the James River, (near Ampthill in the\r\npresent County of Chesterfield,) where, of twenty-four people, only a\r\nboy and girl escaped by hiding themselves.[165:B] Lead was found near\r\nthese iron-works. King James promised to send over four hundred soldiers\r\nfor the protection of the colony; but he never could be induced to\r\nfulfil his promise. Captain John Smith offered, if the company would\r\nsend him to Virginia, with a small force, to reduce the savages to\r\nsubjection, and protect the colony from future assaults. His project\r\nfailed on account of the dissensions of the company, and the niggardly\r\nterms proposed by the few members that were found to act on the matter.\r\nThe Rev. Jonas Stockham, in May, 1621, previous to the massacre, had\r\nexpressed the opinion that it was utterly in vain to undertake the\r\nconversion of the savages, until their priests and \"ancients\" were put\r\nto the sword. Captain Smith held the same opinion, and he states that\r\nthe massacre drove all to believe that Mr. Stockham was right in his\r\nview on this point.[165:C] The event justified the policy of Argall in\r\nprohibiting intercourse with the natives, and had that measure been\r\nenforced, the massacre would probably have been prevented. The violence\r\nand corruption of such rulers as Argall serve to disgrace and defeat\r\neven good measures; while the virtues of the good are sometimes\r\nperverted to canonize the most pernicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[161:A] Beverley, 39.\r\n\r\n[162:A] The chief was so charmed with it, especially with the lock and\r\nkey, that he locked and unlocked the door a hundred times a day.\r\n\r\n[163:A] Purchas, his Pilgrim, iv. 1788; Smith, ii. 65: a list of the\r\nslain may be found on page 70.\r\n\r\n[164:A] ARMS.

Japazaws communicated the message to\r\nCrashaw, and he thereupon sent Opechancanough word \"that he would\r\nnakedly fight him, or any of his, with their own swords.\" The challenge\r\nwas declined. Not long afterwards Captain Madison, who occupied a fort\r\non the Potomac River, suspecting treachery on the part of the tribe\r\nthere, rashly killed thirty or forty men, women, and children, and\r\ncarried off the werowance and his son, and two of his people, prisoners\r\nto Jamestown. The captives were in a short time ransomed.\r\n\r\nWhen the corn was ripe, Sir George Yeardley, with three hundred men,\r\ninvaded the country of the Nansemonds, who, setting fire to their\r\ncabins, and destroying whatever they could not carry away, fled;\r\nwhereupon the English seized their corn, and completed the work of\r\ndevastation. Sailing next to Opechancanough's seat, at the head of York\r\nRiver, Yeardley inflicted the same chastisement on the Pamunkies. In New\r\nEngland it was said: \"Since the news of the massacre in Virginia, though\r\nthe Indians continue their wonted friendship, yet are we more wary of\r\nthem than before, for their hands have been embrued in much English\r\nblood, only by too much confidence, but not by force.\"[166:A]\r\n\r\nThe red men of Virginia were driven back, like hunted wolves, from\r\ntheir ancient haunts. While their fate cannot fail to excite\r\ncommiseration, it may reasonably be concluded that the perpetual\r\npossession of this country by the aborigines would have been\r\nincompatible with the designs of Providence in promoting the welfare of\r\nmankind. A productive soil could make little return to a people so\r\ndestitute of the art and of the implements of agriculture, and\r\nhabitually indolent. Navigable rivers, the natural channels of commerce,\r\nwould have failed in their purpose had they borne no freight but that of\r\nthe rude canoe; primeval forests would have slept in gloomy inutility,\r\nwhere the axe was unknown; and the mineral and metallic treasures of the\r\nearth would have remained forever entombed. In Virginia, since the\r\naboriginal population was only about one to the square mile, they could\r\nnot be justly held occupants of the soil. However well-founded their\r\ntitle to those narrow portions which they actually occupied, yet it was\r\nfound impossible to take possession of the open country, to which the\r\nsavages had no just claim, without also exterminating them from those\r\nparticular spots that rightfully belonged to them. This inevitable\r\nnecessity actuated the pious Puritans of Plymouth as well as the less\r\nscrupulous settlers of Jamestown; and force was resorted to in all the\r\nAnglo-American settlements except in that effected, at a later day, by\r\nthe gentle and sagacious Penn. The unrelenting hostility of the savages,\r\ntheir perfidy and vindictive implacability, made sanguinary measures\r\nnecessary. In Virginia, the first settlers, a small company, in an\r\nunknown wilderness, were repeatedly assaulted, so that resistance and\r\nretaliation were demanded by the natural law of self-defence. Nor were\r\nthese settlers voluntary immigrants; the bulk of them had been sent\r\nover, without regard to their choice, by the king or the Virginia\r\nCompany. Nor did the king or the company authorize any injustice or\r\ncruelty to be exercised toward the natives; on the contrary, the\r\ncolonists, however unfit, were enjoined to introduce the Christian\r\nreligion among them, and to propitiate their good will by a humane and\r\nlenient treatment. Smith and his comrades, so far from being encouraged\r\nto maltreat the Indians, were often hampered in making a necessary\r\nself-defence, by a fear of offending an arbitrary government at home.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by Mr. Jefferson,[168:A] that it is not so general\r\na truth, as has been supposed, that the lands of Virginia were taken\r\nfrom the natives by conquest, far the greater portion having been\r\npurchased by treaty. It may be objected, that the consideration was\r\noften inadequate; but a small consideration may have been sufficient to\r\ncompensate for a title which, for the most part, had but little\r\nvalidity; besides, a larger compensation would oftentimes have been\r\nthrown away upon men so ignorant and indolent. Groping in the dim\r\ntwilight of nature, and slaves of a gross idolatry, their lives were\r\ncircumscribed within a narrow uniform circle of animal instincts and the\r\nnecessities of a precarious subsistence. Cunning, bloody, and\r\nrevengeful, engaged in frequent wars, they were strangers to that\r\nArcadian innocence and the Elysian scenes of a golden age of which\r\nyouthful poets so fondly dream. If an occasional exception occurs, it is\r\nbut a solitary ray of light shooting across the surrounding gloom. Yet\r\nwe cannot be insensible to the many injuries they have suffered, and\r\ncannot but regret that their race could not be united with our own. The\r\nIndian has long since disappeared from Virginia; his cry no longer\r\nechoes in the woods, nor is the dip of his paddle heard on the water.\r\nThe exterminating wave still urges them onward to the setting sun, and\r\ntheir tribes are fading one by one forever from the map of existence.\r\nGeology shows that in the scale of animal life, left impressed on the\r\nearth's strata, the inferior species has still given place to the\r\nsuperior: so likewise is it with the races of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[166:A] Purchas, iv. 1840.\r\n\r\n[168:A] Notes on Va., 102.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n1622-1625.\r\n\r\n     James the First jealous of Virginia Company--Gondomar--The\r\n     King takes Measures to annul the Charter--Commissioners\r\n     appointed--Assembly Petitions the King--Disputes between\r\n     Commissioners and Assembly--Butler's Account of the Colony--\r\n     Nicholas Ferrar--Treachery of Sharpless, and his Punishment--\r\n     The Charter of Virginia Company dissolved--Causes of this\r\n     Proceeding--Character of the Company--Records of the Company--\r\n     Death of James the First--Charles the First succeeds him--The\r\n     Virginia Company--Earl of Southampton--Sir Edwin Sandys and\r\n     Nicholas Ferrar--The Rev.

He remarked to King James, of the Virginia Company,\r\nthat \"they were deep politicians, and had further designs than a\r\ntobacco-plantation; that as soon as they should get to be more numerous,\r\nthey intended to step beyond their limits, and, for aught he knew, they\r\nmight visit his master's mines.\" The massacre afforded an occasion to\r\nthe enemies of the company to attribute all the calamities of the colony\r\nto its mismanagement and neglect, and thus to frame a plausible pretext\r\nfor dissolving the charter.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nathaniel Butler, a dependent of the Earl of Warwick, had, by\r\nhis influence, been sent out Governor of Bermudas for three years, where\r\nhe exercised the same oppression and extortion as Argall had exhibited\r\nin Virginia. Upon finding himself compelled to leave those islands, he\r\ncame to Virginia, in the midst of the winter succeeding the massacre. He\r\nwas hospitably entertained by Governor Wyat, which kindness he proved\r\nhimself wholly unworthy of, his conduct being profligate and disorderly.\r\nHe demanded a seat in the council, to which he was in no way entitled.\r\nHe went up the James as far as to the mouth of the Chickahominy, where\r\n\"he plundered Lady Dale's cattle;\" and after a three months' stay, he\r\nset sail for England. Upon his return, Butler was introduced to the\r\nking, and published \"The Unmasked Face of our Colony in Virginia, as it\r\nwas in the Winter of 1622,\" in which he took advantage of the\r\nmisfortunes of the colony, and exaggerated its deplorable condition. The\r\nRev. William Mease, (who had been for ten years resident in the colony,)\r\nwith several others, replied to this defamatory pamphlet.[170:A]\r\n\r\nThe company was divided into two parties, the one headed by the Earl of\r\nSouthampton, Lord Cavendish, Sir Edward Sackville, Sir John Ogle, Sir\r\nEdwin Sandys, with several others of less note; on the other side, the\r\nleaders were the Earl of Warwick, Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Nathaniel Rich,\r\nSir Henry Mildmay, Alderman Johnson, etc. They appeared before the king,\r\nthe Earl of Warwick's faction presenting their accusations against the\r\ncompany, and the other side defending it; and Sir Edward Sackville used\r\nsuch freedom of language that \"the king was fain to take him down\r\nsoundly and roundly.\" However, by the lord treasurer's intervention, the\r\nmatter was reconciled on the next day.[170:B]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1623, a commission was issued authorizing Sir William Jones, a\r\njustice of the common pleas, Sir Nicholas Fortescue, Sir Francis Goston,\r\nSir Richard Sutton, Sir William Pitt, Sir Henry Bourchier, and Sir Henry\r\nSpilman,[170:C] to inquire into the affairs of the colony. By an order\r\nof the privy council the records of the company were seized, and the\r\ndeputy treasurer, Nicholas Ferrar, imprisoned, and on the arrival of a\r\nship from Virginia, her packets were seized and laid before the privy\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nNicholas Ferrar, Jr., was born in London in 1592, educated at Cambridge,\r\nwhere he was noted for his talents, acquirements, and piety.[171:A]\r\nUpon leaving the university he made the tour of Europe, winning the\r\nesteem of the learned, passing through many adventures and perils with\r\nChristian heroism, and maintaining everywhere an unsullied character.\r\nUpon his return to England, in 1618, he was appointed king's counsel for\r\nthe Virginia Plantation. In the year 1622 he was chosen deputy treasurer\r\nof the Virginia Company, (which office his brother John also filled for\r\nsome years,) and so remained till its dissolution. In the House of\r\nCommons he distinguished himself by his opposition to the political\r\ncorruption of that day, and abandoned public life when little upwards of\r\nthirty years of age, \"in obedience to a religious fancy he had long\r\nentertained,\" and formed of his family and relations a sort of little\r\nhalf-popish convent, in which he passed the remainder of his\r\nlife.[171:B]\r\n\r\nCarlyle[171:C] thus describes this singular place of retirement:\r\n\"Crossing Huntingdonshire in his way northward, his majesty[171:D] had\r\nvisited the establishment of Nicholas Ferrar, at Little Gidding, on the\r\nwestern border of that county. A surprising establishment now in full\r\nflower, wherein above fourscore persons, including domestics, with\r\nFerrar and his brother, and aged mother at the head of them, had devoted\r\nthemselves to a kind of Protestant monachism, and were getting much\r\ntalked of in those times. They followed celibacy and merely religious\r\nduties; employed themselves in binding of prayer-books, embroidering of\r\nhassocks, in almsgiving also, and what charitable work was possible in\r\nthat desert region; above all, they kept up, night and day, a continual\r\nrepetition of the English liturgy, being divided into relays and\r\nwatches, one watch relieving another, as on shipboard, and never\r\nallowing at any hour the sacred fire to go out.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1623, the king declared his intention to grant a new charter\r\nmodelled after that of 1606. This astounding order was read three\r\ntimes, at a meeting of the company, before they could credit their own\r\nears; then, by an overwhelming vote, they refused to relinquish their\r\ncharter, and expressed their determination to defend it.\r\n\r\nThe king, in order to procure additional evidence to be used against the\r\ncompany, appointed five commissioners to make inquiries in Virginia into\r\nthe state and condition of the colony. In November, 1623, when two of\r\nthese commissioners had just sailed for Virginia, the king ordered a\r\nwrit of _quo warranto_ to be issued against the Virginia Company.\r\n\r\nIn the colony, hitherto, the proclamations of the governors, which had\r\nformed the rule of action, were now enacted into laws; and it was\r\ndeclared that the governor should no more impose taxes on the colonists\r\nwithout the consent of the Assembly, and that he should not withdraw the\r\ninhabitants from their private labor to any service of his; and further,\r\nthat the burgesses should be free from arrest during the session of the\r\nAssembly. These acts of the legislature of the infant colony, while\r\nunder the control of the Virginia Company, render it certain that there\r\nwas more of constitutional and well-regulated freedom in Virginia then,\r\nthan in the mother country.\r\n\r\nOf the commissioners appointed to make inquiries in Virginia, John\r\nHarvey and John Pory arrived there early in 1624; Samuel Matthews and\r\nAbraham Percy were planters resident in the colony, and the latter a\r\nmember of the House of Burgesses; John Jefferson, the other\r\ncommissioner, did not come over to Virginia, nor did he take any part in\r\nthe matter, being a hearty friend to the company.[172:A] Thomas\r\nJefferson, in his memoir of himself,[172:B] says that one of his name\r\nwas secretary to the Virginia Company. The Virginia planters at first\r\nlooking on it as a dispute between the crown and the company, in which\r\nthey were not essentially interested, paid little attention to it; but\r\ntwo petitions, defamatory of the colony and laudatory of Sir Thomas\r\nSmith's arbitrary rule, having come to the knowledge of the Assembly, in\r\nFebruary, 1624, that body prepared spirited replies, and drafted a\r\npetition to the king, which, with a letter to the privy council, and\r\nother papers, were entrusted to Mr. John Pountis, a member of the\r\ncouncil.[173:A] He died during the voyage to England. The letter\r\naddressed to the privy council prayed \"that the governors may not have\r\nabsolute power, that they might still retain the liberty of popular\r\nassemblies, than which nothing could more conduce to the public\r\nsatisfaction and public utility.\" At the same time the Virginia Company,\r\nin England, presented a petition to the House of Commons against the\r\narbitrary proceedings of the king; but although favorably received, it\r\nwas withdrawn as soon as the king's disapprobation was announced.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the commissioners refused to exhibit their commission and\r\ninstructions, and the Assembly therefore refused to give them access to\r\ntheir records. Pory, one of the commissioners, who had formerly lost his\r\nplace of secretary of the colony by betraying its secrets to the Earl of\r\nWarwick, suborned Edward Sharpless, clerk of the council, to expose to\r\nhim copies of the journal of that body, and of the House of Burgesses.\r\nSharpless being convicted of this misdemeanor was sentenced to the\r\npillory, with the loss of his ears.[173:B] Only a part of one ear was\r\nactually cut off.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, having failed to obtain from the Assembly a\r\ndeclaration of their willingness to submit to the king's purpose of\r\nrevoking the charter, made a report against the company's management of\r\nthe colony and the government of it, as too popular, that is,\r\ndemocratic, under the present charter. The king, by a proclamation\r\nissued in July, suppressed the meetings of the company, and ordered for\r\nthe present a committee of the privy council, and others, to sit every\r\nThursday, at the house of Sir Thomas Smith, in Philpot Lane, for\r\nconducting the affairs of the colony. Viscount Mandeville was at the\r\nhead of this committee: Sir George Calvert, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Sir\r\nSamuel Argall, John Pory, Sir John Wolstenholme, and others, were\r\nmembers. At the instance of the attorney-general, to enable the company\r\nto make a defence, their books were restored and the deputy treasurer\r\nreleased. In Trinity term, 1624, the writ of _quo warranto_ was tried\r\nin the Court of King's Bench, and the charter of the Virginia Company\r\nwas annulled. The case was determined only upon a technicality in the\r\npleadings.\r\n\r\nIn one of the hearings against the company, before the privy council,\r\nthe Marquis of Hamilton said of the letters and instructions of the\r\ncompany, written by Nicholas Ferrar, Jr.: \"They are papers as admirably\r\nwell penned as any I ever heard.\" And the Earl of Pembroke remarked:\r\n\"They all deserve the highest commendation: containing advices far more\r\nexcellent than I could have expected to have met with in the letters of\r\na trading company. For they abound with soundness of good matter and\r\nprofitable instruction, with respect both to religion and policy; and\r\nthey possess uncommon elegance of language.\"[174:A]\r\n\r\nThe company had been long obnoxious to the king's ill will for several\r\nreasons; it had become a nursery for rearing and training leaders of the\r\nopposition, many of its members being likewise members of parliament. It\r\nwas a sort of reform club. The king, in a speech, swore that \"the\r\nVirginia Company was a seminary for a seditious parliament.\" The company\r\nhad chosen a treasurer in disregard of the king's nomination; and in\r\nelecting Carew Raleigh, a member, they had made allusions to his father,\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, which were doubtless unpalatable to the author of\r\nhis judicial murder. The king was greedy of power and of money, which he\r\nwanted the sense and the virtue to make a good use of; and he hoped to\r\nfind in Virginia a new field for extortion. Fortunately for the history\r\nof the colony, copies of the company's records were made by the\r\nprecaution of Nicholas Ferrar: these being deposited in the hands of the\r\nEarl of Southampton, after his death, which took place in 1624,\r\ndescended to his son. After his death, in 1667, they were purchased from\r\nhis executors, for sixty guineas, by the first Colonel William Byrd,\r\nthen in England. From these two folio volumes, in possession of Sir John\r\nRandolph, and from the records of the colony, Stith compiled much of his\r\nHistory of Virginia, which comes down to the year 1624.[174:B]\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of April, 1625, died King James the First, aged\r\nfifty-nine, after a reign of twenty years. By his consort, Anne of\r\nDenmark, he had issue, Henry and Robert, who died young, Charles, his\r\nsuccessor, and Elizabeth, who married Frederic the Fifth, elector\r\nPalatine. Charles the First succeeding to the crown and the principles\r\nof his father, took the government of Virginia into his own hands.\r\n\r\nThe company thus dissolved, had expended one hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds in establishing the colony, and had transported nine thousand\r\nsettlers without the aid of government. The number of stockholders was\r\nabout one thousand; and the annual value of exports from Virginia was,\r\nat the period of the dissolution of the charter, only twenty thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe company embraced much of the rank, wealth, and talents of the\r\nkingdom--near fifty noblemen, several hundred knights, and many\r\ngentlemen, merchants, and citizens. Among the leaders in its courts were\r\nLord Cavendish, afterwards Earl of Devonshire; Sir Edwin Sandys; and Sir\r\nEdward Sackville, afterwards the celebrated Earl of Dorset; and, above\r\nall, the Earl of Southampton, the friend of Essex, and the patron of\r\nShakespeare. Henry Wriothesley, third Earl of Southampton, in 1601, was\r\nimplicated with the Earl of Essex in his hair-brained and abortive\r\nconspiracy to seize the person of Queen Elizabeth. Essex lost his life.\r\nSouthampton was convicted, attainted and imprisoned during the queen's\r\nlife. Upon the accession of James the First he was liberated, and\r\nrestored in 1603. He was afterwards made Captain of the Isle of Wight\r\nand Governor of Carisbroke Castle; and in 1618 a member of the privy\r\ncouncil. Brave and generous, but haughty and impetuous, he was by no\r\nmeans adapted to the court and cabinet of James, where fawning servility\r\nand base intrigue were the ordinary stepping-stones of political\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1619, the Earl of Southampton was imprisoned through the\r\ninfluence of Buckingham, \"whom he rebuked with some passion for speaking\r\noften to the same thing in the house, and out of order.\" In 1620 he was\r\nchosen Treasurer, or Governor of the Virginia Company, contrary to the\r\nking's wishes; but he, nevertheless, continued in that office until the\r\ncharter was dissolved, and at its meetings, and in parliament, opposed\r\nthe measures of a feeble and corrupt court. He and Sir Edwin Sandys, the\r\nleaders, together with the bulk of the members of the company, shared\r\nlargely in the spirit of civil and religious freedom, which was then\r\nmanifesting itself so strongly in England. In the hostile course pursued\r\nagainst the company, the attacks were especially directed against the\r\nearl and his associates Sir Edwin Sandys and Nicholas Ferrar. These\r\nthree were celebrated: Lord Southampton for wisdom, eloquence, and sweet\r\ndeportment; Sir Edwin Sandys for great knowledge and integrity; and\r\nNicholas Ferrar for wonderful abilities, unwearied diligence, and the\r\nstrictest virtue.[176:A] The earl and Sir Edwin were particular objects\r\nof the king's hatred. Sir Edwin, a member of the House of Commons, was\r\narbitrarily imprisoned in 1621, during the session of parliament; and\r\nthe earl was arrested after its dissolution. Spain had, at this time,\r\nacquired the ascendancy in the English Court, and this malign influence\r\nwas skilfully maintained by the intrigues of her crafty ambassador,\r\nCount Gondomar. It was believed by many that James was even willing to\r\nsacrifice the interests of the English colonies for the benefit of those\r\nof Spain. The Rev. Jonas Stockham, a minister in Virginia, in a letter\r\ndated in May, 1621, and addressed to the Council of the Virginia\r\nCompany, said: \"There be many Italianated and Spaniolized Englishmen\r\nenvies our prosperities, and by all their ignominious scandals they can\r\ndevise, seeks to dishearten what they can those that are willing to\r\nfurther this glorious enterprise. To such I wish, according to the\r\ndecree of Darius, that whosoever is an enemy to our peace, and seeketh\r\neither by getting monipolical patents, or by forging unjust tales to\r\nhinder our welfare--that his house were pulled down, and a pair of\r\ngallows made of the wood, and he hanged on them in the place.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Southampton was grandson of Wriothesley, the famous\r\nChancellor of Edward the Sixth, father to the excellent and noble\r\nTreasurer Southampton, grandfather to Rachel Lady Russel. In his later\r\nyears he commanded an English regiment in the Dutch service, and died in\r\nthe Netherlands, 1624. Shakespeare dedicated some of his minor poems to\r\nhim; the County of Southampton, in Virginia, probably also took its name\r\nfrom him. Captain Smith, who had been unjustly displaced by the company,\r\napproved of the dissolution of their charter. Yet, as no compensation\r\nwas rendered for the enormous expenditure incurred, it can be looked\r\nupon as little better than confiscation effected by chicane and tyranny.\r\nA parliamentary committee, of which Sir Edwin Sandys was a member, in\r\nthe same year, 1624, drew up articles of impeachment against Lord\r\nTreasurer Cranfield for his agency in bringing about the dissolution of\r\nthe charter.[177:A] Nevertheless, the result was undoubtedly favorable\r\nto the colony, as is candidly acknowledged by that honest chronicler,\r\nStith, although no one could be more strenuously opposed to the\r\narbitrary means employed.\r\n\r\nAn Assembly had been held in March, 1624, and its acts are preserved:\r\nthey are brief and simple, coming directly to the point, without the\r\nredundancy of modern statutes; and refer mainly to agriculture, the\r\nchurch establishment, and defence against the Indians.[177:B] The\r\nfollowing is a list of the members of this early Assembly:--\r\n\r\n                 Sir Francis Wyat, Knt., Governor, etc.\r\n     Captain Francis West,      |   John Pott,\r\n     Sir George Yeardley,       |   Captain Roger Smith,\r\n     George Sandys, Treasurer,  |   Captain Ralph Hamor,\r\n                   And John Pountis, _of the Council_.\r\n\r\n         BURGESSES.             |      BURGESSES.\r\n     William Tucker,            |  Nathaniel Bass,\r\n     Jabez Whitakers,           |  John Willcox,\r\n     William Peeine,            |  Nicolas Marten,\r\n     Raleigh Crashaw,           |  Clement Dilke,\r\n     Richard Kingsmell,         |  Isaac Chaplin,\r\n     Edward Blany,              |  John Chew,\r\n     Luke Boyse,                |  John Utie,\r\n     John Pollington,           |  John Southerne,\r\n     Nathaniel Causey,          |  Richard Bigge,\r\n     Robert Adams,              |  Henry Watkins,\r\n     Thomas Harris,             |  Gabriel Holland,\r\n     Richard Stephens,          |  Thomas Morlatt,\r\n                                           R.

The eleven members of the\r\ncouncil were, Francis West, Sir George Yeardley, George Sandys, Roger\r\nSmith, Ralph Hamor, who had been of the former council, with the\r\naddition of John Martin, John Harvey, Samuel Matthews, Abraham Percy,\r\nIsaac Madison, and William Clayborne. Several of these were then, or\r\nbecame afterwards, men of note in the colony. This is the first mention\r\nof William Clayborne, who was destined to play an important part in the\r\nfuture annals of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThus in effect a royal government was now established in Virginia;\r\nhitherto she had been subject to a complex threefold government of the\r\ncompany, the crown, and her own president or governor and\r\ncouncil.[179:A]\r\n\r\nFrom 1624 to 1628 there is no mention in the statute-book of Virginia,\r\nor in the journal of the Virginia Company, of any assembly having been\r\nheld in the colony, and in 1628 appeals were made to the governor and\r\ncouncil; whereas had there been an assembly, it would have been the\r\nappellate court.\r\n\r\nThe French had established themselves as early as 1625 in Canada; the\r\nDutch were now colonizing the New Netherlands; a Danish colony had been\r\nplanted in New Jersey; the English were extending their confines in New\r\nEngland (where New Plymouth numbered thirty-two houses and one hundred\r\nand eighty settlers) and Virginia; while the Spaniards, the first\r\nsettlers of the coast, still held some feeble posts in Florida.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wyat, the governor of the colony of Virginia, on the death of\r\nhis father, Sir George Wyat, returning, in 1626, to Ireland, to attend\r\nto his private affairs there, was succeeded by Sir George Yeardley. He,\r\nduring the same year, by proclamation, which now again usurped the place\r\nof law, prohibited the selling of corn to the Indians; made some\r\ncommercial regulations, and directed houses to be palisaded. Yeardley\r\ndying, was succeeded in November, 1627, by Francis West, elected by the\r\ncouncil. He was a younger brother of Lord Delaware.[180:A]\r\n\r\nAt a court held at James City, November the sixteenth, Lady Temperance\r\nYeardley came and confirmed the conveyance made by her late husband, Sir\r\nGeorge Yeardley, knight, late governor, to Abraham Percy, Esq., for the\r\nlands of Flowerdieu Hundred, being one thousand acres, and of Weanoke,\r\non the opposite side of the water, being two thousand two hundred acres.\r\nThis lady's Christian name is Puritanical; another such was Obedience\r\nRobins, a burgess of Accomac in 1630.\r\n\r\nJames the First had extorted a revenue from the tobacco of Virginia by\r\nan arbitrary resort to his prerogative, and in violation of the charter.\r\nCharles the First, in a letter dated June, 1628, proposed that a\r\nmonopoly of the tobacco trade should be granted to him, and recommended\r\nthe culture of several new products, and desired that an assembly\r\nshould be called to take these matters into consideration. The ensuing\r\nassembly replied, demanding a higher price and more favorable terms than\r\nhis majesty was disposed to yield. As to the introduction of new\r\nstaples, they explained why, in their opinion, that was impracticable.\r\nThis letter was signed by Francis West, Governor, five members of the\r\ncouncil, and thirty-one members of the House of Burgesses.\r\n\r\nSir George Yeardley, the late governor, with two or three of the\r\ncouncil, had resided for the most part at Jamestown; the rest of the\r\ncouncil repaired there as occasion required. There was a general meeting\r\nof the governor and council once in every three months. The population\r\nof the colony was estimated at not less than fifteen hundred; they\r\ninhabited seventeen or eighteen plantations, of these the greater part,\r\nlying toward the falls of the James River, were well fortified against\r\nthe Indians by means of palisades. The planters dwelling above\r\nJamestown, found means to procure an abundant supply of fish. On the\r\nbanks of that river the red men themselves were now seldom seen, but\r\ntheir fires were occasionally observed in the woods.[181:A]\r\n\r\nThere was no family in the colony so poor as not to have a sufficient\r\nstock of tame hogs. Poultry was equally abundant; bread plenty and good.\r\nFor drink the colonists made use of a home-made ale; but the better sort\r\nof people were well supplied with sack, aqua-vitæ, and good English\r\nbeer. The common diet of the servants was milk-hominy, that is, bruised\r\nIndian-corn, pounded and boiled thick, and eaten with milk. This dish\r\nwas also in esteem with the better sort. Hominy, according to Strachey,\r\nis an Indian word; Lord Bacon calls it \"the cream of maize,\" and\r\ncommends it as a nutritious diet. The planters were generally provided\r\nwith arms and armor, and on every holiday each plantation exercised its\r\nmen in the use of arms, by which means, together with hunting and\r\nfowling, the greater part of them became excellent marksmen. Tobacco was\r\nthe only staple cultivated for sale. The health of the country was\r\ngreatly improved by clearing the land, so that the sun had power to\r\nexhale up the humid vapors. Captain Francis West continued governor till\r\nMarch, 1628, and he then being about to embark for England, John Pott\r\nwas elected governor by the council.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1629 most of the land about Jamestown was cleared; little\r\ncorn planted; but all the ground converted into pasture and gardens,\r\n\"wherein doth grow all manners of English herbs and roots and very good\r\ngrass.\" Such is the cotemporaneous statement, but after the lapse of\r\nmore than two centuries Eastern Virginia depends largely on the Northern\r\nStates for her supply of hay. The greater portion of the cattle of the\r\ncolony was kept near Jamestown, the owners being dispersed about on\r\nplantations, and visiting Jamestown as inclination prompted, or, at the\r\narrival of shipping, come to trade. In this year the population of\r\nVirginia amounted to five thousand, and the cattle had increased in the\r\nlike proportion. The colony's stock of provisions was sufficient to feed\r\nfour hundred more than its own number of inhabitants. Vessels procured\r\nsupplies in Virginia; the number of arrivals in 1629 was twenty-three.\r\nSalt fish was brought from New England; Kecoughtan supplied peaches.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pearce, an honest industrious woman, after passing twenty years in\r\nVirginia, on her return to England reported that she had a garden at\r\nJamestown, containing three or four acres, where in one year she had\r\ngathered a hundred bushels of excellent figs, and that of her own\r\nprovision she could keep a better house in Virginia, than in London for\r\nthree or four hundred pounds a year, although she had gone there with\r\nlittle or nothing. The planters found the Indian-corn so much better for\r\nbread than wheat, that they began to quit sowing it.\r\n\r\nAn assembly met at Jamestown in October, 1629; it consisted of John\r\nPott, Governor, four councillors, and forty-six burgesses, returned from\r\ntwenty-three plantations. Pott was superseded in the same year by Sir\r\nJohn Harvey, at some time between October and March. In March, the\r\nquarter court ordered an assembly to be called, to meet Sir John Harvey\r\non the twenty-fourth of that month; and nothing was done in Pott's name\r\nafter October, so far as can be found in the records.\r\n\r\nThe late governor was, during the ensuing year, Rob-Roy-like, convicted\r\nof stealing cattle. The trial commenced on the ninth of July, 1630; the\r\nnumber of jurors was thirteen, of whom three were members of the\r\ncouncil. The first day was wholly spent in pleading, the next in\r\nunnecessary disputations, Dr. John Pott endeavoring to prove Mr.\r\nKingsmell, one of the witnesses against him, a hypocrite by the story of\r\n\"Gusman of Alfrach, the Rogue.\" Pott was found guilty, but in\r\nconsideration of his rank and station, judgment was suspended until the\r\nking's pleasure should be known; and all the council became his\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nSir John Harvey, the new governor, had been one of the commissioners\r\nsent out by King James to Virginia, in 1623, for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating the state and condition of the colony, and of procuring\r\nevidence which might serve to justify the dissolution of the charter of\r\nthe Virginia Company. Harvey had also been a member of the provisional\r\ngovernment in the year 1625. Returning now to Virginia, no doubt with\r\nembittered recollections of the collisions with the assembly in which he\r\nhad been formerly involved, he did not fail to imitate the arbitrary\r\nrule that prevailed \"at home,\" and to render himself odious to the\r\ninhabitants of the colony.\r\n\r\nSir George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, descended from a noble\r\nfamily in Flanders, born at Kipling, in Yorkshire, England, was educated\r\npartly at Trinity College, Oxford, and partly on the continent. Sir\r\nRobert Cecil, lord treasurer, employed him as his secretary, and he was\r\npromoted to the clerkship of the council. In 1618 he was knighted, and\r\nin the succeeding year he was made a secretary of state, and one of the\r\ncommittee of trade and plantations, with a pension of one thousand\r\npounds. Through the influence of Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl\r\nof Strafford, he was chosen a member of Parliament. Receiving a patent\r\nfor the southeastern peninsula of Newfoundland, he undertook to\r\nestablish, in 1621, the plantation of Ferryland, which he called the\r\nProvince of Avalon--a name derived from some mediæval legend. In 1624 he\r\nprofessed the Romish faith, and resigned his place of secretary of\r\nstate; but James the First still retained this strenuous defender of\r\nroyal prerogative as a member of his privy council, and created\r\nhim[183:A] Baron of Baltimore, in the County of Longford, in Ireland,\r\nhe being at this time the representative of the University of Oxford in\r\nthe House of Commons. Still bent upon establishing a colony in America,\r\nfor the promotion of his private interests, and to provide an asylum for\r\nthe unmolested exercise of his religion, embarking in a ship lent him by\r\nKing Charles the First, he came over to Virginia in the year 1629.\r\n\r\nVirginia was founded by men devoted to the principles of the\r\nReformation, amid vivid recollections of the persecutions of Mary, the\r\nSpanish armada, and the recent gunpowder plot, and when horror of\r\npapists was at its height. The charter of the colony expressly required\r\nthat the oaths of allegiance and supremacy should be taken for the\r\npurpose of guarding against \"the superstitions of the Church of\r\nRome.\"[184:A]\r\n\r\nThe assembly being in session at the time of Lord Baltimore's arrival,\r\nproposed these oaths to him and those with him. He declined complying\r\nwith the requisition, submitting, however, a form which he was ready to\r\naccept, whereupon the assembly determined to refer the matter to the\r\nprivy council. The virtues of this able and estimable nobleman did not\r\nsecure him from personal indignity. In the old records is found this\r\nentry: \"March 25th, 1630, Thomas Tindall to be pilloried two hours for\r\ngiving my Lord Baltimore the lie, and threatening to knock him\r\ndown.\"[184:B]\r\n\r\nFinding the Virginians unanimously averse to the very name of papist, he\r\nproceeded to the head of Chesapeake Bay, and observing an attractive\r\nterritory on the north side of the Potomac River unoccupied, returned to\r\nEngland, and, in violation of the territorial rights of Virginia,\r\nobtained from Charles the First a grant of the country, afterwards\r\ncalled Maryland,[184:C] but before the sealing of his patent.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1629-30 ministers were ordered to conform\r\nthemselves in all things \"according to the canons of the Church of\r\nEngland.\" It would appear that Puritanism had begun to develope itself\r\namong the clergy as well as the laity of the colony. Measures were\r\nadopted for erecting a fort at Point Comfort; new-comers were exempted\r\nfrom military service during the first five years after their arrival;\r\nengrossing and forestalling were prohibited. For the furtherance of the\r\nproduction of potashes and saltpetre, experiments were ordered to be\r\nmade; to prevent a scarcity of corn, it was enacted that two acres of\r\nland, or near thereabouts, be planted for every head that works in the\r\nground; regulations were established for the improvement of the staple\r\nof tobacco. An act provided that the war commenced against the Indians\r\nbe effectually prosecuted, and that no peace be concluded with\r\nthem.[185:A]\r\n\r\nThe first act of the session of February, 1632, provides that there be a\r\nuniformity throughout this colony, both in substance and circumstance,\r\nto the canons and constitution of the Church of England, as near as may\r\nbe, and that every person yield ready obedience to them, upon penalty of\r\nthe pains and forfeitures in that case appointed. Another act directs\r\nthat ministers shall not give themselves to excess in drinking, or riot,\r\nspending their time idly, by day or night, playing at dice, cards, or\r\nany other unlawful game. Another order was, that all the council and\r\nburgesses of the assembly shall in the morning be present at divine\r\nservice, in the room where they sit, at the third beating of the drum,\r\nan hour after sunrise. No person was suffered to \"tend\" above fourteen\r\nleaves of the tobacco-plant, nor to gather more than nine leaves, nor to\r\ntend any slips of old stalks of tobacco, or any of the second crop; and\r\nit was ordained that all tobacco should be taken down before the end of\r\nNovember. No person was permitted to speak or parley with the Indians,\r\neither in the woods or on any plantation, \"if he can possibly avoid it\r\nby any means.\" The planters, however, were required to observe all terms\r\nof amity with them, taking care, nevertheless, to keep upon their guard.\r\nThe spirit of constitutional freedom exhibited itself in an act\r\ndeclaring that the governor and council shall not lay any taxes or\r\nimpositions upon the colony, their land, or commodities, otherwise than\r\nby authority of the grand assembly, to be levied and employed as by the\r\nassembly shall be appointed.\r\n\r\nAct XL. provides, that the governor shall not withdraw the inhabitants\r\nfrom their private labors to service of his own, upon any color\r\nwhatsoever. In case of emergency, the levying of men shall be ordered by\r\nthe governor, with the consent of the whole body of the council. For the\r\nencouragement of men to plant a plenty of corn, it was enacted, that the\r\nprice shall not be restricted, but it shall be free for every man to\r\nsell it as dear as he can. Men were not allowed to work in the grounds\r\nwithout their arms, and a sentinel on guard; due watch to be kept at\r\nnight when necessary; no commander of any plantation shall either\r\nhimself spend, or suffer others to spend, powder unnecessarily, that is\r\nto say, in drinking or entertainments. All men fit to bear arms were\r\nrequired to bring their pieces to the church on occasion of public\r\nworship. No person within the colony, upon any rumor of supposed change\r\nand alteration, was to presume to be disobedient to the present\r\ngovernment, nor servants to their private officers, masters, and\r\noverseers, at their uttermost peril. No boats were permitted to go and\r\ntrade to Canada or elsewhere that be not of the burthen of ten tons, and\r\nhave a flush deck, or fitted with a grating and a tarpauling, excepting\r\nsuch as be permitted for discovery by a special license from the\r\ngovernor.[186:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[179:A] Chalmers' Introduction, i. 22. Beverley, B. i. 47, says\r\nexpressly that an assembly was allowed. Burk, ii. 15, asserts that\r\n\"assemblies convened and deliberated in the usual form, unchecked and\r\nuninterrupted by royal interference, from the dissolution of the\r\nproprietary government to the period when a regular constitution was\r\nsent over with Sir W. Berkeley in 1639.\" For authority reference is made\r\nto a document in the Appendix, which document, however, is not to be\r\nfound there. The opinions of Chalmers--who, as clerk of the privy\r\ncouncil, had access to the archives in England--and Hening, confirmed by\r\na corresponding hiatus in the records, appear conclusive against the\r\nunsupported statements of Beverley and Burk.\r\n\r\n[180:A] Belknap, art. WYAT, errs in making Sir John Harvey the\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\n[181:A] The number of cattle amounted to several thousand head; the\r\nstock of goats was large, and their increase rapid; the forests abounded\r\nwith wild hogs, which were killed and eaten by the savages.\r\n\r\n[183:A] 1625.\r\n\r\n[184:A] Burk, ii. 25; Hen., i. 73, 97.\r\n\r\n[184:B] 1 Hen., 552.\r\n\r\n[184:C] Belknap, iii. 206; Allen's Biog.

The commissioners were Edward, Earl of\r\nDorset, Henry, Earl of Derby, Dudley, Viscount Dorchester, Sir John\r\nCoke, Sir John Davers, Sir Robert Killegrew, Sir Thomas Rowe, Sir Robert\r\nHeath, Sir Kineage Tench, Sir Dudley Diggs, Sir John Holstenholm, Sir\r\nFrancis Wyat, Sir John Brooks, Sir Kenelm Digby, Sir John Tench, John\r\nBanks, Esq., Thomas Gibbs, Esq., Samuel Rott, Esq., George Sands, Esq.,\r\nJohn Wolstenholm, Esq., Nicholas Ferrar, Esq., Gabriel Barber, and John\r\nFerrar, Esquires.[187:A]\r\n\r\nElaborate acts passed by the Colonial Legislature at this period, for\r\nimproving the staple of tobacco and regulating the trade in it, evince\r\nthe increasing importance of that crop. Tithes were imposed of tobacco\r\nand corn; and the twentieth \"calfe, kidd of goates and pigge\" granted\r\nunto the minister. During the year 1633 every fortieth man in the neck\r\nof land between the James River and the York, (then called the Charles,)\r\nwas directed to repair to the plantation of Dr. John Pott, to be\r\nemployed in building of houses and securing that tract of land lying\r\nbetween Queen's Creek, emptying into Charles River, and Archer's Hope\r\nCreek, emptying into James River. This was Middle Plantation, (now\r\nWilliamsburg,) so called as being midway between the James River and the\r\nYork. Each person settling there was entitled to fifty acres of land and\r\nexemption from general taxes. All new-comers were ordered to pay\r\nsixty-four pounds of tobacco toward the maintenance of the fort at Point\r\nComfort.[188:A] Thus far, under Harvey's administration, the Assembly\r\nhad met regularly, and several judicious and wholesome acts had been\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThe Chesapeake Bay is supposed to have been discovered by the Spaniards\r\nas early as the year 1566 or before, being called by them the Bay of\r\nSanta Maria.[188:B] It was discovered by the English in 1585, when Ralph\r\nLane was Governor of the first Colony of Virginia. In 1620 John Pory\r\nmade a voyage of discovery in the Chesapeake Bay, and found one hundred\r\nEnglish happily settled on its borders, (in what particular place is not\r\nknown,) animated with the hope of a very good trade in furs.[188:C]\r\nDuring the years 1627, 1628, and 1629 the governors of Virginia gave\r\nauthority to William Clayborne, \"Secretary of State of this Kingdom,\" as\r\nthe Ancient Dominion was then styled, to discover the source of the bay,\r\nor any part of that government from the thirty-fourth to the forty-first\r\ndegree of north latitude.[188:D] In May, 1631, Charles the First granted\r\na license to \"our trusty and well-beloved William Clayborne,\" one of the\r\ncouncil and Secretary of State for the colony, authorizing him to make\r\ndiscoveries, and to trade. This license was, by the royal instructions,\r\nconfirmed by Governor Harvey; and Clayborne shortly afterwards\r\nestablished a trading post on Kent Island, in the Chesapeake Bay, not\r\nfar from the present capital of Maryland, Annapolis; and subsequently\r\nanother at the mouth of the Susquehanna River. In the year 1632 a\r\nburgess was returned from the Isle of Kent to the Assembly at\r\nJamestown.[189:A] In 1633 a warehouse was established in Southampton\r\nRiver for the inhabitants of Mary's Mount, Elizabeth City, Accomac, and\r\nthe Isle of Kent.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, George, the elder Lord Baltimore, dying on the\r\nfifteenth of April, 1632, aged fifty, at London, before his patent was\r\nissued, it was confirmed June twentieth of this year, to his son\r\nCecilius, Baron of Baltimore. The new province was named Maryland in\r\nhonor of Henrietta Maria, Queen Consort of Charles the First of England,\r\nand daughter of Henry the Fourth of France. For eighteen months from the\r\nsigning of the Maryland charter, the expedition to the new colony was\r\ndelayed by the strenuous opposition made to the proceeding. The\r\nVirginians felt no little aggrieved at this infraction of their\r\nchartered territory; and they remonstrated to the king in council in\r\n1633, against the grant to Lord Baltimore, alleging that \"it will be a\r\ngeneral disheartening to them, if they shall be divided into several\r\ngovernments.\" Future events were about to strengthen their sense of the\r\njustice of their cause. In July of this year the case was decided in the\r\nStar Chamber, the privy council, influenced by Laud, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and the Earl of Strafford, deeming it fit to leave Lord\r\nBaltimore to his patent and the complainants to the course of law\r\n\"according to their desire,\" recommending, at the same time, a spirit of\r\namity and good correspondence between the planters of the two colonies.\r\nSo futile a decision could not terminate the contest, and Clayborne\r\ncontinued to claim Kent Island, and to abnegate the authority of the\r\nproprietary of Maryland.\r\n\r\nAt length, Lord Baltimore having engaged the services of his brother,\r\nLeonard Calvert, for founding the colony, he with two others, one of\r\nthem probably being another brother, were appointed commissioners. The\r\nexpedition consisted of some twenty gentlemen of fortune, and two or\r\nthree hundred of the laboring class, nearly all of them Roman\r\nCatholics. Imploring the intercession of the Blessed Virgin, St.\r\nIgnatius, and all the guardian angels of Maryland, they set sail from\r\nCowes, in the Isle of Wight, in November, 1633, St. Cecilia's day. The\r\ncanonized founder of the order of the Jesuits, Ignatius Loyola, was the\r\npatron saint of the infant Maryland. February twenty-seventh, 1634, they\r\nreached Point Comfort, filled with apprehensions of the hostility of the\r\nVirginians to their colonial enterprise. Letters from King Charles and\r\nthe chancellor of the exchequer conciliated Governor Harvey, who hoped,\r\nby his kindness to the Maryland colonists, to insure the recovery of a\r\nlarge sum of money due him from the royal treasury. The Virginians were\r\nat this time all under arms expecting the approach of a hostile Spanish\r\nfleet. Calvert, after a hospitable entertainment, embarked on the third\r\nof March for Maryland. Clayborne, who had accompanied Harvey to Point\r\nComfort to see the strangers, did not fail to intimidate them by\r\naccounts of the hostile spirit which they would have to encounter in the\r\nIndians of that part of the country to which they were destined.\r\nCalvert, on arriving in Maryland, was accompanied in his explorations of\r\nthe country by Captain Henry Fleet, an early Virginia pioneer, who was\r\nfamiliar with the settlements and language of the savages, and in much\r\nfavor with them; and it was under his guidance and direction that the\r\nsite of St. Mary's, the ancient capital of Maryland, was\r\nselected.[190:A] White, a Jesuit missionary, says of Fleet: \"At the\r\nfirst he was very friendly to us; afterwards, seduced by the evil\r\ncounsels of a certain Clayborne, who entertained the most hostile\r\ndisposition, he stirred up the minds of the natives against us.\"[190:B]\r\nWhite mentions that the Island of Monserrat, in the West Indies, where\r\nthey touched, was inhabited by Irishmen who had been expelled by the\r\nEnglish of Virginia \"on account of their profession of the Catholic\r\nfaith.\"\r\n\r\nIn a short time after the landing of Leonard Calvert in Maryland, Sir\r\nJohn Harvey, Governor of Virginia, visited him at St. Mary's. His\r\narrival attracted to the same place the Indian chief of Patuxent, who\r\nsaid: \"When I heard that a great werowance of the English was come to\r\nYoacomoco, I had a great desire to see him; but when I heard the\r\nwerowance of Pasbie-haye was come thither also to see him, I presently\r\nstart up, and without further counsel came to see them both.\"[191:A]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1634, at a meeting of the governor and council, Clayborne\r\ninquired of them how he should demean himself toward Lord Baltimore and\r\nhis deputies in Maryland, who claimed jurisdiction over the colony at\r\nKent Isle. The governor and council replied that the right of his\r\nlordship's patent being yet undetermined in England, they were bound in\r\nduty and by their oaths to maintain the rights and privileges of the\r\ncolony of Virginia. Nevertheless, in all humble submission to his\r\nmajesty's pleasure, they resolved to keep and observe all good\r\ncorrespondence with the Maryland new-comers.[191:B]\r\n\r\nThe Maryland patent conferred upon Lord Baltimore, a popish recusant,\r\nthe entire government of the colony, including the patronage and\r\nadvowson of all churches, the same to be dedicated and consecrated\r\naccording to the ecclesiastical law. This charter was illegal, inasmuch\r\nas it granted powers which the king himself did not possess; the grantee\r\nbeing a papist could not conform to the ecclesiastical laws of England;\r\nand, therefore, the provisions of this extraordinary instrument could\r\nnot be, and were not designed to be, executed according to the plain and\r\nobvious meaning. Such was the character of the instrument by which King\r\nCharles the First despoiled Virginia of so large a portion of her\r\nterritory. It is true, indeed, that the Virginia charter had been\r\nannulled, but this was done upon the condition explicitly and\r\nrepeatedly declared by the royal government, that vested rights should\r\nreceive no prejudice thereby.[192:A]\r\n\r\nClayborne, rejecting the authority of the new plantation, Lord Baltimore\r\ngave orders to seize him if he should not submit himself to the\r\nproprietary government of Maryland. The Indians beginning to exhibit\r\nsome indications of hostility toward the settlers, they attributed it to\r\nthe machinations of Clayborne, alleging that it was he who stirred up\r\nthe jealousy of the savages, persuading them that the new-comers were\r\nSpaniards and enemies to the Virginians, and that he had also infused\r\nhis own spirit of insubordination into the inhabitants of Kent Island. A\r\ntrading vessel called the Longtail, employed by Clayborne in the Indian\r\ntrade in the Chesapeake Bay, was captured by the Marylanders. He\r\nthereupon fitted out an armed pinnace with a crew of fourteen men under\r\none of his adherents, Lieutenant Warren, to rescue the vessel. Two armed\r\npinnaces were sent out by Calvert under Captain Cornwallis; and in an\r\nengagement that ensued in the Potomac, or, as some accounts have it, the\r\nPocomoke River, one of the Marylanders fell, and three of the\r\nVirginians, including Lieutenant Warren. The rest were carried prisoners\r\nto St. Mary's. Clayborne was indicted although not arrested, and\r\nconvicted of murder and piracy, constructive crimes inferred from his\r\nopposition. The chief of Patuxent was interrogated as to Clayborne's\r\nintrigues among the Indians.[192:B]\r\n\r\nHarvey, either from fear of the popular indignation, or from some better\r\nmotive, refused to surrender the fugitive Clayborne to the Maryland\r\ncommissioners, and according to one authority[192:C] sent him to\r\nEngland, accompanied by the witnesses. Chalmers, good authority on the\r\nsubject, makes no allusion to the circumstance, and it appears more\r\nprobable that Clayborne having appealed to the king, went voluntarily to\r\nEngland.[192:D] It is certain that he was not brought to trial there.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[187:A] 2 Burk's Hist. of Va., 35.\r\n\r\n[188:A] 1 Hening, 188, 190, 199, 208, 222.

The original name of Pamaunkee, or Pamunkey, had then been\r\nsuperseded by Charles River, which afterwards gave way to the present\r\nname of York. Pamunkey, at first the name of the whole river, is now\r\nrestricted to one of its branches. The word Pamaunkee is said to signify\r\n\"where we took a sweat.\"\r\n\r\nThe grant of Maryland to Lord Baltimore opened the way for similar\r\ngrants to other court-favorites, of lands lying to the north and to the\r\nsouth of the settled portion of the Ancient Colony and Dominion of\r\nVirginia. While Charles the First was lavishing vast tracts of her\r\nterritory upon his favorites, Sir John Harvey, a worthy pacha of such a\r\nsultan, in collusion with the royal commissioners, imitated the royal\r\nmunificence by giving away large bodies not only of the public, or crown\r\nlands, but even of such as belonged to private planters.[193:A] In the\r\ncontests between Clayborne and the proprietary of Maryland, while the\r\npeople of Virginia warmly espoused their countryman's cause, Harvey\r\nsided with Baltimore, and proved himself altogether a fit instrument of\r\nthe administration then tyrannizing in England. He was extortionate,\r\nproud, unjust, and arbitrary; he issued proclamations in derogation of\r\nthe legislative powers of the assembly; assessed, levied, held, and\r\ndisbursed the colonial revenue, without check or responsibility;\r\ntransplanted into Virginia exotic English statutes; multiplied penalties\r\nand exactions, and appropriated fines to his own use; he added the\r\ndecrees of the court of high commission of England to the ecclesiastical\r\nconstitutions of Virginia. The assembly, nevertheless, met regularly;\r\nand the legislation of the colony expanded itself in accordance with the\r\nexigencies of an increasing population. Tobacco was subjected, by royal\r\nordinances, to an oppressive monopoly; and in those days of prerogative,\r\na remonstrance to the Commons for redress proved fruitless.\r\n\r\nAt length, in July, 1634, the council's committee for the colonies,\r\neither from policy or from compassion, transmitted instructions to the\r\ngovernor and council, saying: \"That it is not intended that interests\r\nwhich men have settled when you were a corporation, should be impeached;\r\nthat for the present they may enjoy their estates with the same freedom\r\nand privilege as they did before the recalling of their patents,\" and\r\nauthorizing the appropriation of lands to the planters, as had been the\r\nformer custom.[194:A]\r\n\r\nWhether these concessions were inadequate in themselves, or were not\r\ncarried into effect by Harvey, upon the petition of many of the\r\ninhabitants, an assembly was called to meet on the 7th of May, 1635, to\r\nhear complaints against that obnoxious functionary. There is hardly any\r\npoint on which a people are more sensitive than in regard to their\r\nterritory, and it may therefore be concluded, that one of Harvey's chief\r\noffences was his having sided with Lord Baltimore in his infraction of\r\nthe Virginia territory.\r\n\r\nBurk, in his History of Virginia, has stigmatized Clayborne as \"an\r\nunprincipled incendiary\" and \"execrable villain;\" other writers have\r\napplied similar epithets to him. It appears to have been only his\r\nresolute defence of his own rights and those of Virginia that subjected\r\nhim to this severe denunciation. He was long a member of the council;\r\nlong filled the office of secretary; was held in great esteem by the\r\npeople, and was for many years a leading spirit of the colony.\r\nBurk[195:A] denounces Sir John Harvey for refusing to surrender the\r\nfugitive Clayborne to the demand of the Maryland Commissioners, and\r\nadds: \"But the time was at hand when this rapacious and tyrannical\r\nprefect (Harvey) would experience how vain and ineffectual are the\r\nprojects of tyranny when opposed to the indignation of freemen.\" Thus\r\nthe governor, who excited the indignation of the Virginians by his\r\ncollusion with the Marylanders, was afterwards reprobated by historians\r\nfor sympathizing with Clayborne in his defence of the rights of\r\nVirginia, and opposition to the Marylanders. If Harvey, in violation of\r\nthe royal license granted to Clayborne in 1631, had surrendered him to\r\nthe Maryland Commissioners, he would have exposed himself to the royal\r\nresentment; and nothing could have more inflamed the indignation of\r\nfreemen than such treatment of the intrepid vindicator of their\r\nterritorial rights.\r\n\r\nBefore the assembly (called to hear complaints against the governor)\r\nmet, Harvey, having consented to go to England to answer them, was\r\n\"thrust out of the government\" by the council on the 28th of April,\r\n1635, and Captain John West was authorized to act as governor until the\r\nking's pleasure should be known. The assembly having collected the\r\nevidence, deputed two members of the council to go out with Harvey to\r\nprefer the charges against him. It was also ordered that during the\r\nvacancy in the office of governor, the secretary (Clayborne) should sign\r\ncommissions and passes, and manage the affairs of the Indians.[195:B]\r\n\r\nKing Charles the First, offended at the presumption of the council and\r\nassembly, reinstated Sir John, and he resumed his place, in or before\r\nthe month of January, 1636. Chalmers[195:C] says that he returned in\r\nApril, 1637. Thus the first open resistance to tyranny, and vindication\r\nof constitutional right, took place in the colony of Virginia; and the\r\ndeposition of Harvey foreshadowed the downfall of Charles the First. The\r\nlaws that had been enacted by the first assembly of Maryland, having\r\nbeen sent over to England for his approval, he rejected them, on the\r\nground that the right of framing them was vested in himself; and he\r\ndirected an assembly to be summoned to meet in January, 1638, to have\r\nhis dissent announced to them.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1637 a court was established by the Maryland authorities, in\r\nKent Island, and toward the close of that year Captain George Evelin was\r\nappointed commander of the island. Many of Clayborne's adherents there\r\nrefused to submit to the jurisdiction of Lord Baltimore's colony, and\r\nthe governor, Leonard Calvert, found it necessary to repair there in\r\nMarch, 1638, in person, with a military force, to reduce to submission\r\nthese Virginia malecontents. The Maryland legislature, convened in\r\ncompliance with Lord Baltimore's orders, refused to acquiesce in his\r\nclaim of the legislative power, and in the event they gained their\r\npoint, his lordship being satisfied with a controlling influence in the\r\nchoice of the delegates, and his veto.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians captured by Cornwallis in his engagement with Warren, had\r\nbeen detained prisoners without being brought to trial, there being no\r\ncompetent tribunal in the colony. At length Thomas Smith, second in\r\ncommand to Warren, was brought to trial for the murder of William\r\nAshmore, (who had been killed in the skirmish,) and was found guilty,\r\nand sentenced to death; but it is not certain that he was executed.\r\nClayborne was attainted, and his property confiscated; and these\r\nproceedings probably produced those disturbances in Kent Island which\r\nrequired the governor's presence.\r\n\r\nHarvey, after his restoration, continued to be governor of Virginia for\r\nabout three years, during which period there appears to have been no\r\nmeeting of the assembly, and of this part of his administration no\r\nrecord is left.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1638, Charles the First addressed a letter to Lord Baltimore,\r\nreferring to his former letters to \"Our Governor and Council of\r\nVirginia, and to others, our officers and subjects in these parts, (in\r\nwhich) we signified our pleasure that William Clayborne, David Morehead,\r\nand other planters in the island near Virginia, which they have\r\nnominated Kentish Island, should in no sort be interrupted by you or any\r\nother in your right, but rather be encouraged to proceed in so good a\r\nwork.\" The king complains to Baltimore that his agents, in spite of the\r\nroyal instructions, had \"slain three of our subjects there, and by force\r\npossessed themselves by night of that island, and seized and carried\r\naway both the persons and estates of the said planters.\" His majesty\r\nconcludes by enjoining a strict compliance with his former\r\norders.[197:A]\r\n\r\nIn 1639 Father John Gravener, a Jesuit missionary, resided at Kent\r\nIsland. In April of this year the Lords Commissioners of Plantations,\r\nwith Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, at their head, held a meeting at\r\nWhitehall, and determined the controversy between Clayborne and Lord\r\nBaltimore. This decision was made in consequence of a petition presented\r\nin 1637 by Clayborne to the king, claiming, by virtue of discovery and\r\nsettlement, Kent Island and another plantation at the mouth of the\r\nSusquehanna River, and complaining of the attempts of Lord Baltimore's\r\nagents there to dispossess him and his associates, and of outrages\r\ncommitted upon them. The decision was now absolute in favor of\r\nBaltimore; and Clayborne, despairing of any peaceable redress, returned\r\nto Virginia, and having in vain prayed for the restoration of his\r\nproperty, awaited some future opportunity to vindicate his rights, and\r\nto recover property amounting in value to six thousand pounds, of which\r\nhe had been despoiled.[197:B]\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Maryland, engaged in hostilities with the Indians,\r\nobtained a supply of arms, ammunition, and provision from the Governor\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nCharles the First, bred in all the arts of corrupt and arbitrary\r\ngovernment, had now for many years governed England by prerogative,\r\nwithout a parliament, until at length his necessities constrained him to\r\nconvene one; and his apprehensions of that body, and the revolt of the\r\nScotch, and other alarming ebullitions of discontent, admonished him and\r\nhis advisers to mitigate the high-handed measures of administration. The\r\nseverity of colonial rule was also relaxed, and in November, 1639, the\r\nunpopular Sir John Harvey was displaced, and succeeded by Sir Francis\r\nWyat.[198:A] But Harvey remained in Virginia, and continued to be a\r\nmember of the council. About this time mention is made of the\r\nexportation of cattle from Virginia to New England.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[193:A] Beverley, B. i. 50.\r\n\r\n[194:A] By the words \"for the present,\" was probably intended \"at\r\npresent,\" \"now,\" otherwise their interests might be impeached at a\r\nfuture day, although not immediately.

The arbitrary temper of Charles the First\r\nexcited so great dissatisfaction in the people, and such a strenuous\r\nopposition in parliament, as to exact at length his assent to the\r\n\"Petition of Right.\" The public indignation was carried to a high pitch\r\nby the forced levying of ship-money, that is, of money for the building\r\nof ships-of-war, and John Hampden stood forth in a personal resistance\r\nto this unconstitutional mode of raising money. The Puritans found\r\nwithin the pale of the Established Church, as well as without, were\r\narrayed against the despotic rule of the crown and the hierarchy; and\r\nScotland was not less offended against the king, who undertook to\r\nobtrude the Episcopal liturgy upon the Presbyterian land of his birth.\r\nIn the year 1640 Charles the First found himself compelled to call\r\ntogether the Long Parliament. Virginia meantime remained loyal; the\r\ndecrees of the courts of high commission were the rule of conduct, and\r\nthe authority of Archbishop Laud was as absolute in the colony as in the\r\nfatherland. Stephen Reekes was pilloried for two hours, with a label on\r\nhis back signifying his offence, fined fifty pounds, and imprisoned\r\nduring pleasure, for saying \"that his majesty was at confession with the\r\nLord of Canterbury,\" that is, Archbishop Laud.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1641, the Earl of Strafford was executed, and Archbishop Laud\r\nsent to the Tower, where he was destined to remain until he suffered\r\nthe same fate. The massacre of the Protestants in Ireland occurring in\r\nthe latter part of this year, rendered still more portentous the\r\nthreatening storm. January tenth, the king left London, to which he was\r\nnot destined to return till brought back a prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1642, Sir Francis Wyat gave way to Sir William Berkley,\r\nwhose destiny it was to hold the office of governor for a period longer\r\nthan any other governor, and to undergo extraordinary vicissitudes of\r\nfortune. His commission and instructions declared that it was intended\r\nto give due encouragement to the plantation of Virginia, and that\r\necclesiastical as well as temporal matters should be regulated according\r\nto the laws of England; provision was also made for securing to England\r\na monopoly of the trade of the colony. By some salutary measures which\r\nSir William Berkley introduced shortly after his arrival, and by his\r\nprepossessing manners, he soon rendered himself very acceptable to the\r\nVirginians.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1642, the assembly made a declaration against the restoration\r\nof the Virginia Company then proposed, denouncing the company as having\r\nbeen the source of intolerable calamities to the colony by its illegal\r\nproceedings, barbarous punishments, and monopolizing policy. They\r\ninsisted that its restoration would cause them to degenerate from the\r\ncondition of their birthright, and convert them from subjects of a\r\nmonarchy to the creatures of a popular and tumultuary government, to\r\nwhich they would be obliged to resign their lands held from the crown;\r\nwhich they intimate, if necessary, would be more fitly resigned to a\r\nbranch of the royal family than to a corporation. They averred that the\r\nrevival of the company would prove a deathblow to freedom of trade, \"the\r\nlife-blood of a commonwealth.\" Finally, the assembly protested against\r\nthe restoration of the company, and decreed severe penalties against any\r\nwho should countenance the scheme.[200:A]\r\n\r\nAt a court holden at James City, June the 29th, 1642, present Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley, knight, governor, etc., Captain John West, Mr. Rich.\r\nKemp, Captain William Brocas, Captain Christopher Wormley, Captain\r\nHumphrey Higginson. The commission for the monthly court of Upper\r\nNorfolk was renewed, and the commissioners appointed were, Captain\r\nDaniel Gookin, commander, Mr. Francis Hough, Captain Thomas Burbage, Mr.\r\nJohn Hill, Mr. Oliver Spry, Mr. Thomas Den, Mr. Randall Crew, Mr. Robert\r\nBennett, Mr. Philip Bennett. The captains of trained bands: Captain\r\nDaniel Gookin, Captain Thomas Burbage.[201:A]\r\n\r\nAmong the converts made by one of the New England missionaries, named\r\nThompson, was Daniel Gookin (son of the early settler of that name.) He\r\nremoved to Boston in May, 1644, being probably one of those who were\r\ndriven away from Virginia for non-conformity. He went away with his\r\nfamily in a ship bought by him from the governor, and was received with\r\ndistinction at Boston. He soon became eminent in New England, and\r\nafterwards enjoyed the confidence of Cromwell, of whom he was a devoted\r\nadherent. He was author of several historical works. He died in March,\r\n1686-7[201:B].\r\n\r\nThe alarming crisis in the affairs of Charles the First strongly\r\ndictated the necessity of a conciliatory course; and the remonstrance,\r\ntogether with a petition, being communicated to him, then at York, just\r\non the eve of the \"Grand Rebellion,\" he replied to it, firmly engaging\r\nnever to restore the Virginia Company.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the king's letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"C. R.\r\n\r\n     \"Trusty and well-beloved, we greet you all. Whereas, we have\r\n     received a petition from you, our governor, council and\r\n     burgesses of the grand assembly in Virginia, together with a\r\n     declaration and protestation of the first of April, against a\r\n     petition presented in your names to our House of Commons in\r\n     this our kingdom, for restoring of the letters patent for the\r\n     incorporation of the late treasurer and council, contrary to\r\n     our intent and meaning, and against all such as shall go about\r\n     to alienate you from our immediate protection. And whereas,\r\n     you desire by your petition that we should confirm this your\r\n     declaration and protestation under our royal signet, and\r\n     transmit the same to that our colony; these are to signify,\r\n     that your acknowledgments of our great bounty and favors\r\n     toward you, and your so earnest desire to continue under our\r\n     immediate protection, are very acceptable to us; and that as\r\n     we had not before the least intention to consent to the\r\n     introduction of any company over that our colony; so we are by\r\n     it much confirmed in our former resolutions, as thinking it\r\n     unfit to change a form of government wherein (besides many\r\n     other reasons given, and to be given,) our subjects there\r\n     (having had so long experience of it) receive so much content\r\n     and satisfaction. And this our approbation of your petition\r\n     and protestation we have thought fit to transmit unto you\r\n     under our royal signet.\r\n\r\n     \"Given at our Court, at York, the 5th of July, 1642.\r\n\r\n     \"To our trusty and well-beloved our Governor, Council, and\r\n     Burgesses of the Grand Assembly of Virginia.\"[202:A]\r\n\r\nIt was in this year that the name of Charles City County was changed\r\ninto York.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1619 a small party of English Puritans had come over to\r\nVirginia; and a larger number would have followed them, but they were\r\nprevented by a royal proclamation issued at the instance of Bancroft,\r\nthe persecuting Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1642 a deputation was sent\r\nfrom some Virginia dissenters to Boston, soliciting a supply of pastors\r\nfrom the New England churches; three clergymen were accordingly sent,\r\nwith letters recommending them to the governor, Sir William Berkley. On\r\ntheir arrival in Virginia they began to preach in various parts of the\r\ncountry, and the people flocked eagerly to hear them. The following year\r\nthe assembly passed the following act: \"For the preservation of the\r\npurity of doctrine and unity of the church, it is enacted, that all\r\nministers whatsoever, which shall reside in the colony, are to be\r\nconformable to the orders and constitutions of the Church of England and\r\nthe laws therein established; and not otherwise to be admitted to teach\r\nor preach, publickly or privately; and that the governor and council do\r\ntake care, that all non-conformists, upon notice of them, shall be\r\ncompelled to depart the colony with all convenience.\"[203:A] Sir William\r\nBerkley, equally averse to the religious tenets and political principles\r\nof the Puritan preachers, issued a proclamation in consonance with this\r\nexclusive act. Mather says of the three New England missionaries: \"They\r\nhad little encouragement from the rulers of the place, but they had a\r\nkind entertainment with the people;\" and Winthrop: \"Though the State did\r\nsilence the ministers, because they would not conform to the order of\r\nEngland, yet the people resorted to them in private houses to hear\r\nthem.\" In a short time the preachers returned to their own country.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, whose hatred to the whites, although dissembled, had never\r\nbeen abated, headed by Opechancanough, committed a second massacre on\r\nthe 18th day of April, 1644. It was attributed to the encroachments made\r\nupon them by some of Sir John Harvey's grants; but it was suspected by\r\nsome that Opechancanough was instigated to this massacre by certain of\r\nthe colonists themselves, who informed him of the civil war then raging\r\nin England, and of the dissensions that disturbed the colony, and told\r\nhim, that now was his time or never, to root out all of the English.\r\nThis is improbable. Had the Indians followed up the first blow, the\r\ncolonists must have all been cut off; but after their first treacherous\r\nonslaught, their courage failed them, and they fled many miles from the\r\nsettlements. The colonists availed themselves of this opportunity to\r\ngather together, call an assembly, secure their cattle, and to devise\r\nsome plan of defence and attack.\r\n\r\nOpechancanough, the fierce and implacable enemy of the whites, was now\r\nnearly a hundred years old, and the commanding form, which had so often\r\nshone conspicuous in scenes of blood, was worn down by the fatigues of\r\nwar, and bending under the weight of years. No longer able to walk, he\r\nwas carried from place to place by his warriors in a litter. His body\r\nwas emaciated, and he could only see when his eyelids were opened by his\r\nattendants. Sir William Berkley at length moving rapidly with a party of\r\nhorse, surprised the superannuated chief at some distance from his\r\nresidence, and he was carried a prisoner to Jamestown, and there kindly\r\ntreated. He retained a spirit unconquered by decrepitude of body or\r\nreverse of fortune. Hearing one day footsteps in the room where he lay,\r\nhe requested his eyelids to be raised, when, perceiving a crowd of\r\npersons attracted there by a curiosity to see the famous chief, he\r\ncalled for the governor, and upon his appearance, said to him: \"Had it\r\nbeen my fortune to take Sir William Berkley prisoner, I would have\r\ndisdained to make a show of him.\" He, however, had made a show of\r\nCaptain Smith when he was a prisoner. About a fortnight after\r\nOpechancanough's capture, one of his guards, for some private revenge,\r\nbasely shot him in the back. Languishing awhile of the wound, he died at\r\nJamestown, and was probably buried there. His death brought about a\r\npeace with the Indian savages, which endured for many years without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley left Virginia for England in June, 1644, and\r\nreturned in June, 1645, his place being filled during his absence by\r\nRichard Kemp.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of freedom long gaining ground, like a smothered fire, began\r\nnow to flame up and burst forth in England. Charles the First,\r\nincomparably superior to his father in manners, habits, and tastes--a\r\nmodel of kingly grace and dignity, yet was a more determined and\r\ndangerous enemy to the rights of the people. On the 19th of March, 1642,\r\nhaving escaped from insurgent London, he reached the ancient capital,\r\nYork, and on the twenty-fifth day of August raised his standard, under\r\ninauspicious omens, at Nottingham. The royal forces under Prince Rupert\r\nsuffered a disastrous defeat at Marston Moor, July 2d, 1644; and while\r\nSir William Berkley was crossing the Atlantic, the king was overthrown\r\nat Naseby, on the 4th of June, 1645. In this eventful year, and so\r\ndisastrous to the king, of whom the Berkleys were such staunch\r\nsupporters, Gloucester, the chief city of the county where they resided,\r\nand which had been ravaged and plundered by Rupert, was now in the hands\r\nof the parliamentary forces, and Cromwell had been early in the year\r\nconvoying ammunition thither.[204:A] A sad time for the visit of the\r\nloyal Berkley!\r\n\r\nDuring the troubles in England the correspondence of the colony was\r\ninterrupted, supplies reduced, trade obstructed; and the planters looked\r\nforward with solicitude to the issue of such alarming events.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Lord Baltimore, taking advantage of the weakness of\r\nthe crown, had shown some contempt for its authority, and had drawn upon\r\nhimself the threat of a _quo warranto_.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1645, Clayborne, profiting by the distractions of the mother\r\ncountry, and animated by an indomitable, or, as his enemies alleged, a\r\nturbulent spirit, and by a sense of wrongs long unavenged, at the head\r\nof a band of insurgents, expelled Leonard Calvert, deputy governor, from\r\nMaryland, and seized the reins of government. In the month of August,\r\n1646, Calvert, who had taken refuge in Virginia, regained command of\r\nMaryland. Nevertheless, Clayborne and his confederates, with but few\r\nexceptions, emerged in impunity from this singular contest.\r\n\r\nOpechancanough was succeeded by Necotowance, styled \"King of the\r\nIndians,\" and in October, 1646, a treaty was effected with him, by which\r\nhe agreed to hold his authority from the King of England, (who was now\r\nbereft of his own,) while the assembly engaged to protect him from his\r\nenemies; in acknowledgment whereof, he was to deliver to the governor\r\na yearly tribute of twenty beaver skins at the departure of the\r\nwild-geese.[205:A] By this treaty it was further agreed, that the\r\nIndians were to occupy the country on the north side of York River, and\r\nto cede to the English all the country between the York and the James,\r\nfrom the falls to Kiquotan; death for an Indian to be found within this\r\nterritory, unless sent in as a messenger; messengers to be admitted into\r\nthe colony by means of badges of striped cloth; and felony for a white\r\nman to be found on the Indian hunting-ground, which was to extend from\r\nthe head of Yapin, the Blackwater, to the old Mannakin town, on the\r\nJames River; badges to be received at Fort Royal and Fort Henry, alias\r\nAppomattox. Fort Henry had been established not long before this, at the\r\nfalls of the Appomattox, now site of Petersburg; Fort Charles at the\r\nfalls of the James; Fort James on the Chickahominy. This one was under\r\ncommand of Lieutenant Thomas Rolfe, son of Pocahontas.[206:A] Fort Royal\r\nwas on the Pamunkey.\r\n\r\nThe colony bore a natural resemblance to the mother country, no little\r\nmodified by new circumstances, and followed her, yet not with equal\r\nstep. The government and the people were apparently, in the main, loyal,\r\nbut there was a growing Puritan party, and William Clayborne appears to\r\nhave been at the head of it. In 1647 certain ministers, refusing to read\r\nthe Common Prayer on the Sabbath, were declared not entitled to tythes.\r\nTwo years before, mercenary attorneys had been, by law, expelled from\r\nthe courts, and now attorneys were prohibited from receiving any\r\ncompensation for their services, and the courts were directed not to\r\nallow any professional attorneys to appear in civil causes. In case\r\nthere appeared danger of a party suffering in his suit by reason of his\r\nweakness, the court was directed to appoint some suitable person in his\r\nbehalf from the people. It has been suggested in modern times, as an\r\nimprovement in the administration of justice, to allow the parties to\r\nmake their own statements.\r\n\r\nThere were in Virginia, in 1648, about fifteen thousand English, and of\r\nnegroes that had been imported, three hundred good servants. Of cows,\r\noxen, bulls, and calves, \"twenty thousand, large and good;\" and the\r\ncolonists made plenty of butter and good cheese. The number of horses\r\nand mares, of good breed, was two hundred; of asses fifty. The sheep\r\nnumbered three thousand, producing good wool; there were five thousand\r\ngoats. Hogs, tame and wild, innumerable, and the bacon excellent;\r\npoultry equally abundant. Wheat was successfully cultivated. The\r\nabundant crop of barley supplied malt, and there were public\r\nbrew-houses, and most of the planters brewed a good and strong beer for\r\nthemselves. Hops were found to thrive well. The price-current of beef\r\nwas two pence halfpenny (about five cents) a pound, pork six cents.\r\nCattle bore about the same price as in England; most of the vessels\r\narriving laid in their stores here. Thirty different sorts of river and\r\nsea fish were caught. Thirty species of birds and fowls had been\r\nobserved, and twenty kinds of quadrupeds; deer abundant. The varieties\r\nof fruit were estimated at fifteen, and they were comparable to those of\r\nItaly. Twenty-five different kinds of trees were noticed, suitable for\r\nbuilding ships, houses, etc. The vegetables were potatoes, asparagus,\r\ncarrots, parsnips, onions, artichokes, peas, beans, and turnips, with a\r\nvariety of garden herbs and medicinal flowers. Virginia (or Indian) corn\r\nyielded five hundred fold; it was planted like garden-peas; it made good\r\nbread and furmity, and malt for beer, and was found to keep for seven\r\nyears. It was planted in April or May, and ripened in five months. Bees,\r\nwild and domestic, supplied plenty of honey and wax. Indigo was made\r\nfrom the leaves of a small tree, and great hopes were entertained that\r\nVirginia would in time come to supply all Christendom with the commodity\r\nwhich was then procured \"from the Mogul's country.\" The Virginia tobacco\r\nwas in high esteem, yet the crop raised was so large that the price was\r\nonly about three pence, or six cents, a pound. A man could plant enough\r\nto make two thousand pounds, and also sufficient corn and vegetables for\r\nhis own support. The culture of hemp and flax had been commenced. Good\r\niron-ore was found, and there were sanguine anticipations of the profits\r\nto be derived from that source. There were wind-mills and water-mills,\r\nhorse-mills and hand-mills: a saw-mill was greatly needed, it being\r\nconsidered equivalent to the labor of twenty men. There came yearly to\r\ntrade above thirty vessels, navigated by seven or eight hundred men.\r\nThey brought linens, woollens, stockings, shoes, etc. They cleared in\r\nMarch, with return cargoes of tobacco, staves, and lumber. Many of the\r\nmasters and chief mariners of these vessels had plantations, houses, and\r\nservants, in the colony. Pinnaces, boats, and barges were numerous, the\r\nmost of the plantations being situated on the banks of the rivers. Pitch\r\nand tar were made. Mulberry-trees abounded, and it was confidently\r\nbelieved that silk could be raised in Virginia as well as in France.\r\nHopeful anticipations of making wine from the native grape were\r\nentertained, but have never been realized. Virginia was now considered\r\nhealthy; the colonists being so amply provided with the necessaries and\r\ncomforts of life, the number of deaths was believed to be less,\r\nproportionally, than in England. The voyage from England to Virginia\r\noccupied about six weeks; the outward-bound voyage averaging about\r\ntwenty-five days.\r\n\r\nAt this time a thousand colonists were seated upon the Accomac shore,\r\nnear Cape Charles, where Captain Yeardley was chief commander. The\r\nsettlement was then called Northampton; the name of Accomac having been\r\nchanged in 1643 to Northampton, but the original name was afterwards\r\nrestored. Lime was found abundant in Virginia; bricks were made, and\r\nalready some houses built of them. Mechanics found profitable\r\nemployment, such as turners, potters, coopers, sawyers, carpenters,\r\ntilemakers, boatwrights, tailors, shoemakers, tanners, fishermen, and\r\nthe like. There were at this time twelve counties. The number of\r\nchurches was twenty, each provided with a minister, and the doctrine and\r\norders after the Church of England. The ministers' livings were worth\r\none hundred pounds, or five hundred dollars, per annum, paid in tobacco\r\nand corn. The colonists all lived in peace and love, happily exempt by\r\ndistance from the horrors of civil war that convulsed the mother\r\ncountry. The Virginia planters were intending to make further\r\ndiscoveries to the south and west. A colony of Swedes had made a\r\nsettlement on the banks of the Delaware River, within the limits of\r\nVirginia, and were carrying on a profitable traffic in furs. The Dutch\r\nhad also planted a colony on the Hudson River, within the Virginia\r\nterritory, and their trade in furs amounted to ten thousand pounds per\r\nannum. Cape Cod was then looked upon as the point of demarcation between\r\nVirginia and New England. Cattle, corn, and other commodities were\r\nshipped from Virginia to New England. Sir William Berkley had made an\r\nexperiment in the cultivation of rice, and found that it produced thirty\r\nfold, the soil and climate being well adapted to it, as the negroes\r\naffirmed, who, in Africa, had subsisted mostly on that grain. There were\r\nnow many thousands of acres of cleared land in Virginia, and about one\r\nhundred and fifty ploughs at work. Captain Brocas of the council, a\r\ngreat traveller, had planted a vineyard, and made excellent wine.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, 1647, there were in the James River ten vessels from\r\nLondon, two from Bristol, twelve from Holland, and seven from New\r\nEngland. Mr. Richard Bennet expressed twenty butts of excellent cider\r\nfrom apples of his own orchard. They began now to engraft on the\r\ncrab-apple tree, which was found indigenous. Another planter had for\r\nseveral years made, from pears of his own raising, forty or fifty butts\r\nof perry. The governor, Sir William Berkley, in his new orchard, had\r\nfifteen hundred fruit trees, besides his apricots, peaches, mellicotons,\r\nquinces, wardens, and the like.\r\n\r\nCaptain Matthews, an old planter, of above thirty years' standing, one\r\nof the council, and \"a most deserving commonwealth man,\" had a fine\r\nhouse, sowed much hemp and flax, and had it spun; he kept weavers, and\r\nhad a tannery, where leather was dressed; and had eight shoemakers at\r\nwork; had forty negro servants, whom he brought up to mechanical trades;\r\nhe sowed large crops of wheat and barley. The wheat he sold at four\r\nshillings (about a dollar) a bushel. He also supplied vessels trading in\r\nVirginia, with beef. He had a plenty of cows, a fine dairy, a large\r\nnumber of hogs and poultry. Captain Matthews married a daughter of Sir\r\nThomas Hinton, and \"kept a good house, lived bravely, and was a true\r\nlover of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a free school, with two hundred acres of land appurtenant, a\r\ngood house, forty milch cows, and other accommodations. It was endowed\r\nby Mr. Benjamin Symms. There were, besides, some small schools in the\r\ncolony, probably such as are now known as \"old-field schools.\"[209:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200:A] 1 Hening, 230; Burk, ii. 68.\r\n\r\n[201:A] Art. by J.

At Newport's\r\nNews he was hospitably entertained by Captain Matthews, Mr. Fantleroy,\r\nand others, finding free quarter everywhere. The Indian war was now\r\nended by the courage of Captain Marshall and the valiant Stillwell, and\r\nby the resolute march of Sir William Berkley, who had made the veteran\r\nOpechancanough prisoner. The explorer went to Chicaoen, on the Potomac,\r\nand found Maryland involved in war with the Sasquesahannocks and other\r\nIndians, and at the same time in a civil war. Kent Island appeared to be\r\ntoo wet, and the water was bad.[210:A]\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1648, Nickotowance, the Indian chief, visited\r\nGovernor Berkley, at Jamestown, accompanied by five other chiefs, and\r\npresented twenty beaver skins to be sent to King Charles as tribute.\r\nAbout this time the Indians reported to Sir William Berkley that within\r\nfive days' journey to the southwest there was a high mountain, and at\r\nthe foot of it great rivers that run into a great sea; that men came\r\nhither in ships, (but not the same as the English;) that they wore\r\napparel, and had red caps on their heads, and rode on beasts like\r\nhorses, but with much longer ears. These people were probably the\r\nSpaniards. Sir William Berkley prepared to make an exploration with\r\nfifty horse and as many foot,[211:A] but he was disappointed in this\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nAt this period the settlement of all the New England States had been\r\ncommenced; the Dutch possessed the present States of New York, New\r\nJersey, and part of Connecticut, and they had already pushed their\r\nsettlements above Albany; the Swedes occupied the shores of Pennsylvania\r\nand Delaware; Maryland was still in her infancy; Virginia was\r\nprosperous; the country now known as the Carolinas belonged to the\r\nassignees of Sir Robert Heath, but as yet no advances had been made\r\ntoward the occupation of it.[211:B]\r\n\r\nUpon complaint of the necessities of the people, occasioned by barren\r\nand over-wrought land, and want of range for cattle and hogs, permission\r\nwas granted them to remove during the following year to the north side\r\nof Charles (York) and Rappahannock rivers.[211:C]\r\n\r\nThe congregation of dissenters collected by the three missionaries\r\nbefore mentioned from Massachusetts, amounted in 1648 to one hundred and\r\neighteen members. They encountered the continual opposition of the\r\ncolonial authorities. Mr. Durand, their elder, had already been banished\r\nby the governor; and in the course of this year their pastor, Harrison,\r\nbeing ordered to depart, retired to New England. On his arrival there he\r\nrepresented that many of the Virginia council were favorably disposed\r\ntoward the introduction of Puritanism, and that \"one thousand of the\r\npeople, by conjecture, were of a similar mind.\"[211:D] The members\r\nof the council at that time were Captain John West, Richard Kempe,\r\nsecretary, Captain William Brocas, Captain Thomas Pettus, Captain\r\nWilliam Bernard, Captain Henry Browne, and Mr. George Ludlow. When the\r\nprevalence of Puritanism in the mother country is considered, and the\r\nnumerous ties of interest and consanguinity that connected it with the\r\ncolony, the estimate of the number favorably disposed toward Puritanism\r\ndoes not appear improbable. John Hammond afterwards gave an account of\r\nthe proceedings against the Puritans in Virginia.[212:A] According to\r\nhim, during the reign of Charles the First, Virginia \"was wholly for\r\nmonarchy.\" A congregation of people calling themselves Independents\r\nhaving organized a church, (probably in Nansemond County,) and daily\r\nincreasing, several consultations were held by the authorities of the\r\ncolony how to suppress and extinguish them. At first their pastor was\r\nbanished, next their other teachers, then many were confined in prison;\r\nnext they were generally disarmed, which was a very harsh measure in\r\nsuch a country, where they were surrounded by the Indian savages;\r\nlastly, the non-conformists were put in a condition of banishment, so\r\nthat they knew not how in those straits to dispose of themselves. The\r\nleader in this persecution, according to Hammond, was Colonel Samuel\r\nMatthews, member of the council in 1643, and subsequently agent for\r\nVirginia to the parliament. A number of these dissenters having gained\r\nthe consent of Lord Baltimore and his deputy governor of Maryland,\r\nretired to that colony, and settled there. Among these, one of the\r\nprincipal was Richard Bennet, a merchant and a Roundhead. For a time\r\nthese refugees prospered and remained apparently content with their new\r\nplace of abode; and others, induced by their example, likewise removed\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nKing Charles the First, after having been a prisoner for several years,\r\nwas beheaded in front of Whitehall Palace, on the 30th day of January,\r\n1648. He died with heroic firmness and dignity.[212:B] The Commonwealth\r\nof England now commenced, and continued till the restoration of Charles\r\nthe Second, in 1660. Upon the dissolution of the monarchy in England,\r\nthere were not wanting those in Virginia who held that the colonial\r\ngovernment, being derived from the crown, was itself now extinct; but\r\nthe assembly, by an act of October of the same year, declared that\r\nwhoever should defend the late traitorous proceedings against the king,\r\nshould be adjudged an accessory after the fact, to his death, and be\r\nproceeded against accordingly; to asperse the late most pious king's\r\nmemory was made an offence punishable at the discretion of the governor\r\nand council; to express a doubt of the right of succession of Charles\r\nthe Second, or to propose a change of government, or to derogate from\r\nthe full power of the government of the colony, was declared to be high\r\ntreason.[213:A] The principle, however, that the authority of the\r\ncolonial government ceased with the king's death, was expressly\r\nrecognized at the surrender of the colony to the parliamentary naval\r\nforce in 1651.\r\n\r\nColonel Norwood, a loyal refugee in Holland, having formed a plan with\r\ntwo comrades, Major Francis Morrison and Major Richard Fox, to seek\r\ntheir fortunes in Virginia, they met in London, August, 1649, for the\r\npurpose of embarking. At the time when they had first concerted their\r\nscheme, Charles the First was a prisoner at Carisbrook Castle, in the\r\nIsle of Wight. He had since been executed; the royalists, thunderstruck\r\nat this catastrophe, saw their last gleam of hope extinguished; and\r\nNorwood and his friends were eager to escape from the scene of their\r\ndisasters. At the Royal Exchange, whose name was now for a time to be\r\naltered to the \"Great Exchange,\" the three forlorn cavaliers engaged a\r\npassage to Virginia in the \"Virginia Merchant,\" burden three hundred\r\ntons, mounting thirty guns or more. The charge for the passage was six\r\npounds a head, for themselves and servants. The colony of Virginia they\r\ndeemed preferable for them in their straitened pecuniary circumstances;\r\nand they brought over some goods with them for the purpose of mercantile\r\nadventure. September the 23d, 1649, they embarked in the \"Virginia\r\nMerchant,\" having on board three hundred and thirty souls. Touching at\r\nFayal, Norwood and his companions met with a Portuguese lady of rank\r\nwith her family returning, in an English ship, the \"John,\" from the\r\nBrazils to her own country. With her they drank the healths of their\r\nkings, amid thundering peals of cannon. The English gentlemen\r\ndiscovered a striking resemblance between the lady's son and their own\r\nprince, Charles, which filled them with fond admiration, and flattered\r\nthe vanity of the beautiful Portuguese. Passing within view of the\r\ncharming Bermuda, the \"Virginia Merchant\" sailing for Virginia, struck\r\nupon a breaker early in November, near the stormy Cape Hatteras.\r\nNarrowly escaping from that peril, she was soon overtaken by a storm,\r\nand tossed by mountainous towering northwest seas. Amid the horrors of\r\nthe evening prospect, Norwood observed innumerable ill-omened porpoises\r\nthat seemed to cover the surface of the sea as far as the eye could\r\nreach. The ship at length losing forecastle and mainmast, became a mere\r\nhulk, drifting at the mercy of the winds and waves. Some of the\r\npassengers were swept overboard by the billows that broke over her; the\r\nrest suffered the tortures of terror and famine. At last the tempest\r\nsubsiding, the ship drifted near the coast of the Eastern Shore. Here\r\nNorwood and a party landing on an island, were abandoned by the Virginia\r\nMerchant. After enduring the extremities of cold and hunger, of which\r\nsome died, Norwood and the survivors in the midst of the snow were\r\nrescued by a party of friendly Indians. In the mean while the ship\r\nhaving arrived in the James River, a messenger was dispatched by\r\nGovernor Berkley in quest of Norwood and his party. Conducted to the\r\nnearest plantation, they were everywhere entertained with the utmost\r\nkindness. Stephen Charlton (afterwards, in 1652, burgess from\r\nNorthampton County,) would have the Colonel to put on a good farmer-like\r\nsuit of his own. After visiting Captain Yeardley, (son of Sir George\r\nYeardley, the former governor,) the principal person in that quarter of\r\nthe colony, Norwood crossed the Chesapeake Bay in a sloop, and landed at\r\n'Squire Ludlow's plantation on York River. Next he proceeded to the\r\nneighboring plantation of Captain Ralph Wormley, at that time burgess\r\nfrom York County, and member of his majesty's council. At Captain\r\nWormley's he found some of his friends, who had likewise recently\r\narrived from England, feasting and carousing. The cavaliers had changed\r\ntheir clime but not their habits. These guests were Sir Thomas\r\nLundsford, Sir Henry Chicheley, (pronounced Chickley,) Sir Philip\r\nHoneywood, and Colonel Hammond. Sir Thomas Lundsford lies buried in the\r\nchurchyard of Williamsburg. At Jamestown Norwood was cordially welcomed\r\nby Sir William Berkley, who took him to his house at Greenspring, where\r\nhe remained for some months. Sir William, on many occasions, showed\r\ngreat respect to all the royal party who made that colony their refuge;\r\nand his house and purse were open to all such. To Major Fox, who had no\r\nother friend in the colony to look to for aid, he exhibited signal\r\nkindness; to Major Morrison he gave command of the fort at Point\r\nComfort, and by his interest afterwards advanced him to be governor of\r\nthe colony. In 1650 Governor Berkley dispatched Norwood to Holland to\r\nfind the fugitive king, and to solicit for the place of treasurer of\r\nVirginia, which Sir William took to be void by \"the delinquency\" of\r\nWilliam Clayborne, the incumbent, who had long held that place. The\r\ngovernor furnished Norwood with money to defray the charge of the\r\nsolicitation, which was effectual, although Prince Charles was not found\r\nin Holland, he having gone to Scotland. Charles the Second was crowned\r\nby the Scotch at Scone, in 1651.[215:A]\r\n\r\nBennet and other dissenting Virginians, who had settled in Maryland,\r\nwere not long there before they became dissatisfied with the proprietary\r\ngovernment. The authority of Papists was irksome to Puritans, and they\r\nbegan to avow their aversion to the oath of allegiance imposed upon\r\nthem; for by the terms of it Lord Baltimore affected to usurp almost\r\nroyal authority, concluding his commissions and writs with \"We,\" \"us,\"\r\nand \"given under our hand and greater seal of arms, in such a year of\r\nour dominion.\" The Protestants of Maryland, no doubt saw, in the\r\npolitical character of the Commonwealth of England, a fair prospect of\r\nthe speedy subversion of Baltimore's power; nor were they disappointed\r\nin this hope.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1650, the Long Parliament passed an ordinance prohibiting\r\ntrade with Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda, and Antigua. The act recited\r\nthat these colonies were, and of right ought to be, subject to the\r\nauthority of Parliament; that divers acts of rebellion had been\r\ncommitted by many persons inhabiting Virginia, whereby they have most\r\ntraitorously usurped a power of government, and set themselves in\r\nopposition to this commonwealth. It therefore declared such persons\r\nnotorious robbers and traitors; forbade all correspondence or commerce\r\nwith them, and appointed commissioners, and dispatched Sir George\r\nAyscue, with a powerful fleet and army, to reduce Barbadoes, Bermuda,\r\nand Antigua to submission.\r\n\r\nCharles the Second having invaded England at the head of a Scottish\r\narmy, was utterly defeated and overthrown by Cromwell, at Worcester,\r\nSeptember the 3d, 1651. Charles himself, not long after, with difficulty\r\nand in disguise, escaped to France. In September of the same year the\r\ncouncil of state, of which Bradshaw was president, issued instructions\r\nfor Captain Robert Dennis, Mr. Richard Bennet, Mr. Thomas Steg,[216:A]\r\nand Captain William Clayborne, appointed commissioners, for the\r\nreducement of Virginia and the inhabitants thereof, to their due\r\nobedience to the Commonwealth of Virginia. A fleet was put under command\r\nof Captain Dennis, and the commissioners embarked in the Guinea frigate.\r\nThey were empowered to assure pardon and indemnity to all the\r\ninhabitants of the said plantations that shall submit unto the present\r\ngovernment and authority, as it is established in the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland. In case they shall not submit by fair ways and means, the\r\ncommissioners were to use all acts of hostility that lay in their power\r\nto enforce them; and if they should find the people so to stand out as\r\nthat they could by no other ways or means reduce them to their due\r\nobedience, they, or any two or more of them, whereof Captain Robert\r\nDennis was to be one, had the power to appoint captains and other\r\nofficers, and to raise forces within each of the aforesaid plantations,\r\nfor the furtherance of the service; and such persons as should come in\r\nand serve as soldiers, if their masters should stand in opposition to\r\nthe government of the English Commonwealth, might be discharged and set\r\nfree from their masters, by the commissioners. A similar measure was\r\nadopted by Lord Dunmore in 1776. In case of the death of Captain\r\nDennis, his place was to be filled by Captain Edmund Curtis, commander\r\nof the Guinea frigate.[217:A] It is a mistake to suppose that the\r\nmembers of the Long Parliament were all of them, or a majority of them,\r\nPuritans, in the religious sense of the term; but they were so in\r\npolitical principles.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1652, Captain Dennis arrived at Jamestown, and demanded a\r\nsurrender of the colony. It is said by some historians that Sir William\r\nBerkley, either with a hope of repelling them, or of commanding better\r\nterms, prepared for a gallant resistance, and undertook to strengthen\r\nhimself by making use of several Dutch ships,[217:B] which happened to\r\nbe there engaged in a contraband trade, and which he hired for the\r\noccasion; that there chanced to be on board of the parliament's fleet\r\nsome goods belonging to two members of the Virginia council, and that\r\nDennis sent them word that their goods should be forfeited if the colony\r\nwas not immediately surrendered; and that the threat kindled dissensions\r\nin the council, and the governor found himself constrained to yield on\r\ncondition of a general amnesty.[217:C]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of several chroniclers, but it appears to be based\r\nonly on a loose and erroneous tradition. It would have been a mere empty\r\ngasconade for Sir William Berkley to oppose the English naval force, and\r\nthe truth appears to be, that as soon as the parliamentary squadron\r\nentered the Chesapeake Bay, all thoughts of resistance were laid aside.\r\nIf the story of the preparation for resistance were credited, it must at\r\nthe same time be believed that this chivalry and loyalty suddenly\r\nevaporated under the more potent influence of pecuniary interest.[217:D]\r\n\r\nThe capitulation was ratified on the 12th of March, 1652, by which it\r\nwas agreed that the Colony of Virginia should be subject to the\r\nCommonwealth of England; that the submission should be considered\r\nvoluntary, not forced nor constrained by a conquest upon the country;\r\nand that \"they shall have and enjoy such freedoms and privileges as\r\nbelong to the free-born people of England;\" the assembly to meet as\r\nformerly, and transact the affairs of the colony, but nothing to be done\r\ncontrary to the government of the Commonwealth of England; full\r\nindemnity granted for all offences against the Parliament of England;\r\nVirginia to have and enjoy the ancient bounds and limits granted by the\r\ncharters of former kings; \"and that we shall seek a new charter from the\r\nParliament to that purpose, against any that have entrenched upon the\r\nrights thereof,\" alluding no doubt to Lord Baltimore's intrusion into\r\nMaryland; that the privilege of having fifty acres of land for every\r\nperson transported to the colony, shall continue as formerly granted;\r\nthat the people of Virginia shall have free trade, as the people of\r\nEngland do enjoy, to all places, and with all nations, according to the\r\nlaws of that Commonwealth; and that Virginia shall enjoy all privileges\r\nequally with any English plantation in America.\r\n\r\nThe navigation act had been passed in the preceding October, forbidding\r\nany goods, wares, or merchandise, to be imported into England, except\r\neither in English ships, or in ships of the country where the\r\ncommodities were produced--a blow aimed at the carrying-trade of the\r\nDutch. It was further agreed by the articles of surrender, that Virginia\r\nwas to be free from all taxes, customs, and impositions whatsoever, and\r\nnone to be imposed on them without consent of the grand assembly; and so\r\nthat neither forts nor castles be erected, or garrisons maintained,\r\nwithout their consent: no charge to be made upon Virginia on account of\r\nthis present fleet; the engagement or oath of allegiance to be tendered\r\nto all the inhabitants of Virginia; recusants to have a year's time to\r\nremove themselves and their effects out of Virginia, and in the mean\r\ntime, during the said year, to have equal justice as formerly; the use\r\nof the Book of Common Prayer to be permitted for one year, with the\r\nconsent of a majority of a parish, provided that those things which\r\nrelate to kingship, or that government, be not used publicly; and\r\nministers to be continued in their places, they not misdemeaning\r\nthemselves; public ammunition, powder and arms, to be given up,\r\nsecurity being given to make satisfaction for them; goods already\r\nbrought hither by the Dutch to remain unmolested; the quit-rents granted\r\nby the late king to the planters of Virginia for seven years, to be\r\nconfirmed; finally, the parliamentary commissioners engage themselves\r\nand the honor of the Parliament for the full performance of the\r\narticles, the governor and council and burgesses making the same pledge\r\nfor the colony.[219:A]\r\n\r\nOn the same day some other articles were ratified by the commissioners\r\nand the governor and council, exempting the governor and council from\r\ntaking the oath of allegiance for a year, and providing that they should\r\nnot be censured for praying for, or speaking well of the king, for one\r\nwhole year in their private houses, or \"neighboring conference;\" Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley was permitted to send an agent to give an account to his\r\nmajesty of the surrender of the country; Sir William and the members of\r\nthe council were permitted to dispose of their estates, and transport\r\nthemselves \"whither they please.\" Protection of liberty and property\r\nwere guaranteed to Sir William Berkley.\r\n\r\nMajor Fox, (comrade of Norwood,) commander of the fort, at Point\r\nComfort, was allowed compensation for the building of his house on Fort\r\nIsland. A general amnesty was granted to the inhabitants, and it was\r\nagreed that in case Sir William or his councillors should go to London,\r\nor any other place in England, that they should be free from trouble or\r\nhindrance of arrests, or such like, and that they may prosecute their\r\nbusiness there for six months. It would seem that some important\r\narticles of surrender were not ratified by the Long Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Article was, \"That Virginia shall have and enjoy the ancient\r\nbounds and limits granted by the charters of the former kings, and that\r\nwe shall seek a new charter from the Parliament to that purpose, against\r\nany that entrenched against the rights thereof.\" This article was\r\nreferred in August, 1652, to the committee of the navy, to consider what\r\npatent was fit to be granted to the inhabitants of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Article was, \"That the people of Virginia have free trade,\r\nas the people of England do enjoy, to all places and with all nations,\r\naccording to the laws of that commonwealth; and that Virginia shall\r\nenjoy all privileges equal with any English plantations in America.\" The\r\nlatter clause was referred to the same committee.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Article was, \"That Virginia shall be free from all taxes,\r\ncustoms, and impositions, whatsoever, and none to be imposed on them\r\nwithout consent of the grand assembly, and so that neither forts nor\r\ncastles be erected, or garrisons maintained, without their consent.\"\r\nThis was also referred to the navy committee, together with several\r\npapers relative to the disputes between Virginia and Maryland. The\r\ncommittee made a report in December, which seems merely confined to the\r\nFourth Article, relative to the question of boundary and the contest\r\nwith Lord Baltimore. In the ensuing July the Long Parliament was\r\ndissolved.[220:A]\r\n\r\nThe articles of surrender were subscribed by Richard Bennet, William\r\nClayborne, and Edmund Curtis, commissioners in behalf of the Parliament.\r\nBennet, a merchant and Roundhead, driven from Virginia by the\r\npersecution of Sir William Berkley's administration, had taken refuge in\r\nMaryland. Having gone thence to England, his Puritanical principles and\r\nhis knowledge of the colonies of Virginia and Maryland, had recommended\r\nhim for the place of commissioner. Clayborne, too, who had formerly been\r\nobliged to fly to England, and whose office of treasurer of Virginia Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley had held to be forfeited by delinquency, and which the\r\nfugitive Charles had bestowed on Colonel Norwood--this impetuous and\r\nindomitable Clayborne was another of the commissioners sent to reduce\r\nthe colonies within the Chesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\nA new era was now opening in these two colonies; and the prominent parts\r\nwhich Bennet and Clayborne were destined to perform in this novel scene,\r\nexhibit a signal example of the vicissitudes of human fortune. The drama\r\nthat was enacted in the mother country was repeated on a miniature\r\ntheatre in the colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[210:A] Description of New Albion, in Force's Hist.

After effecting a reduction of the infant province,\r\nthey, with singular moderation, agreed to a compromise with those who\r\nheld the proprietary government under Lord Baltimore. Stone, the\r\ngovernor, and the council, part of them Papists, none well affected to\r\nthe Commonwealth of England, were allowed, until further instructions\r\nshould be received, to retain their places, on condition of issuing all\r\nwrits in the name of the Keepers of the Liberty of England.[222:A] Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley, upon the surrender of the colony, betook himself into\r\nretirement in Virginia, where he remained free from molestation; and his\r\nhouse continued to be a hospitable place of resort for refugee\r\ncavaliers. There was, no doubt, before the surrender, a considerable\r\nparty in Virginia, who either secretly or openly sympathized with the\r\nparliamentary party in England; and upon the reduction of the colony\r\nthese adherents of the Commonwealth found their influence much\r\naugmented.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, 1652, Bennet and Clayborne, commissioners,\r\ntogether with the burgesses of Virginia, organized a provisional\r\ngovernment, subject to the control of the Commonwealth of England.\r\nRichard Bennet, who had been member of the council in 1646, nephew of an\r\neminent London merchant largely engaged in the Virginia trade,[223:A]\r\nwas made governor, April 30, 1652; and William Clayborne, secretary of\r\nstate for the colony. The council appointed consisted of Captain John\r\nWest, Colonel Samuel Matthews, Colonel Nathaniel Littleton, Colonel\r\nArgal Yeardley, Colonel Thomas Pettus, Colonel Humphrey Higginson,\r\nColonel George Ludlow, Colonel William Barnett,[223:B] Captain Bridges\r\nFreeman, Captain Thomas Harwood, Major William Taylor, Captain Francis\r\nEppes, and Lieutenant-Colonel John Cheesman. The governor, secretary,\r\nand council were to have such power and authorities to act from time to\r\ntime as should be appointed and granted by the grand assembly.[223:C]\r\nThe government of the mother country was entitled \"the States,\" as the\r\nUnited States are now styled in Canada. The act organizing the\r\nprovisional government concludes with: \"God save the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland, and this country of Virginia.\" The governor and councillors\r\nwere allowed to be, ex-officio, members of the assembly. On the fifth\r\nday of May, this body, while claiming the right to appoint all officers\r\nfor the colony, yet for the present, in token of their implicit\r\nconfidence in the commissioners, referred all the appointments not\r\nalready made to the governor and them. The administration of Virginia\r\nwas now, for the first time, Puritan and Republican. The act authorizing\r\nthe governor and council to appoint the colonial officers was renewed in\r\nthe following year. The oath administered to the burgesses was: \"You and\r\nevery of you shall swear upon the holy Evangelist, and in the sight of\r\nGod, to deliver your opinions faithfully and honestly, according to your\r\nbest understanding and conscience, for the general good and prosperity\r\nof the country, and every particular member thereof, and to do your\r\nutmost endeavor to prosecute that without mingling with it any\r\nparticular interest of any person or persons whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor and members of the council were declared to be entitled to\r\nseats in the assembly, and were required to take the same oath. This\r\nassembly, which met on the 20th of April, 1652, appears to have sat\r\nabout ten days. There were thirty-five burgesses present from twelve\r\ncounties, namely: Henrico, Charles City, James City, Isle of Wight,\r\nNansemond, (originally called Nansimum,) Lower Norfolk, Elizabeth City,\r\nWarwick, York, Northampton, Northumberland, and Gloucester--Lancaster\r\nnot being represented.[224:A] Rappahannock County was formed from the\r\nupper part of Lancaster in 1656.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the ensuing session of the assembly, which met in\r\nOctober, 1652, Mr. John Hammond, returned a burgess from Isle of Wight\r\nCounty, was expelled from the assembly as being notoriously a scandalous\r\nperson, and a frequent disturber of the peace of the country by libel\r\nand other illegal practices. He had passed nineteen years in Virginia,\r\nand now retired to Maryland; he was the author of the pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Leah and Rachel.\"[224:B] Mr. James Pyland, another burgess, returned\r\nfrom the same county, was expelled, and committed to answer such charges\r\nas should be brought against him as an abettor of Mr. Thomas Woodward,\r\nin his mutinous and rebellious declaration, and concerning his the said\r\nMr. Pyland's blasphemous catechism. These offenders appear to have been\r\nof the royalist party.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1653 there were fourteen counties in Virginia, Surry being\r\nnow mentioned for the first time, and the number of burgesses was\r\nthirty-four. The people living on the borders of the Appomattox River\r\nwere authorized to hold courts, and to treat with the Indians. Colonel\r\nWilliam Clayborne, Captain Henry Fleet, and Major Abram Wood were\r\nempowered to make discoveries to the west and south. In July, some\r\ndifference occurred between the governor and council on the one side,\r\nand the house of burgesses on the other, relative to the election of\r\nspeaker. The affair was amicably arranged, the governor's views being\r\nassented to. Bennet appears to have enjoyed the confidence of the\r\nVirginians. He was too generous to retaliate upon Sir William Berkley\r\nand the royalists who had formerly persecuted him. Some malecontents\r\nwere punished for speaking disrespectfully of him, and refusing to pay\r\nthe castle duties. From the charges brought against one of these, it\r\nappears that the Virginians considered themselves, under the articles of\r\nsurrender, entitled to free trade with all the world, the navigation act\r\nto the contrary notwithstanding; and that act does not appear to have\r\nbeen enforced against Virginia during the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland.[225:A] By the articles of surrender the use of the prayer-book\r\nwas permitted, with the consent of a majority of the people of the\r\nparish, for one year; so that it would seem that its use was prohibited\r\nafter March 12th, 1653; but the prohibition was not enforced, and public\r\nworship continued as before without interruption.[225:B] In April, 1653,\r\nOliver Cromwell dissolved the Long Parliament, and in December, in the\r\nsame year, assumed the office of Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland. Owing to the war with Holland, Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley's departure from Virginia was delayed, and, in\r\nconformity with the articles of convention of 1651, he now became\r\nsubject to arrest. But the assembly passed an act, stating that as the\r\nwar between England and Holland had prevented the confirmation of the\r\nconvention of 1651, in England, or the coming of a ship out of Holland,\r\nand Sir William Berkley desiring a longer time, namely, eight months\r\nfurther, to procure a ship out of Flanders, in respect of the war with\r\nHolland, and that he should be exempted from impost duty on such tobacco\r\nas he should lade in her; \"it is condescended that his request shall be\r\ngranted.\" Some seditious disturbances having taken place in Northampton\r\nCounty, on the Eastern Shore, in which Edmund Scarburgh was a\r\nringleader, it was found necessary for Governor Bennet, Secretary\r\nClayborne, and a party of gentlemen, to repair thither for the purpose\r\nof restoring order. Roger Green, and others, living on the Nansemond\r\nRiver, received a grant of land on condition of their settling the\r\ncountry bordering on the Moratuck or Roanoke River,[226:A] and on the\r\nsouth side of the Chowan. Divers gentlemen requesting permission, were\r\nauthorized, in 1653, to explore the mountains. The ship Leopoldus, of\r\nDunkirk, was confiscated for the use of the Commonwealth of England, for\r\nviolating the navigation act; and the proceeds, amounting to four\r\nhundred pounds sterling, were given to Colonel Samuel Matthews, agent\r\nfor Virginia at the court of the Protector, Colonel William Clayborne,\r\nsecretary, and other officers, in return for their services in the\r\nmatter of the forfeited ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain Francis Yeardley, who has been mentioned before, was a son of\r\nSir George Yeardley, some time governor of Virginia, and Lady\r\nTemperance, his wife, and was born in Virginia. A letter dated in May,\r\n1654, was addressed by him to John Ferrar, at Little Gidding, in\r\nHuntingdonshire, brother to Nicholas Ferrar, whose name is so honorably\r\nconnected with the early annals of Virginia. The younger Yeardley\r\ndescribes the country as very fertile, flourishing in all the exuberance\r\nof nature, abounding especially in the rich mulberry and vine, with a\r\nserene air and temperate clime, and rich in precious minerals. A young\r\nman engaged in the beaver trade having been accidentally separated from\r\nhis own sloop, had obtained a small boat and provisions from Yeardley,\r\nand had gone with his party to Roanoke, at which island he hoped to find\r\nhis vessel. He there fell in with a hunting party of Indians, and\r\npersuaded them and some of the other tribes, both in the island and on\r\nthe mainland, to go back with him and make peace with the English. He\r\nbrought some of these Indians with the great man, or chief of Roanoke,\r\nto Yeardley's house, which was probably on the Eastern Shore, where his\r\nfather had lived before him. The Indians passed a week at Yeardley's.\r\nWhile there, the \"great man\" observing Yeardley's children reading and\r\nwriting, inquired of him whether he would take his only son, and teach\r\nhim \"to speak out of the book, and make a writing.\" Yeardley assured him\r\nthat he would willingly do so; and the chief at his departure expressing\r\nhis strong desire to serve the God of the Englishmen, and his hope that\r\nhis child might be brought up in the knowledge of the same, promised to\r\nbring him back again in four months. In the mean time Yeardley had been\r\ncalled away to Maryland; and the planters of the Eastern Shore\r\nsuspecting, from the frequent visits and inquiries of the Indian, that\r\nYeardley was carrying on some scheme for his own private advantage, were\r\ndisposed to maltreat the chief. Upon one occasion, when Yeardley's wife\r\nhad brought him to church with her, some over-busy justices of the\r\npeace, after sermon, threatened to whip him, and send him away. The\r\n\"great man\" being terrified, the lady taking him by the hand, resolutely\r\nstood forth in his defence, and pledged her whole property, as a\r\nguarantee, that no harm to the settlement was intended, or was likely to\r\narise from the Indian's alliance. Upon Yeardley's return from Maryland,\r\nhe dispatched, with his brother's assistance, a boat with six men, one\r\nbeing a carpenter, to build the great man an English house; and two\r\nhundred pounds for the purchase of Indian territory. The terms of the\r\npurchase were soon agreed upon, and Yeardley's people \"paid for three\r\ngreat rivers and also all such others as they should like of,\r\nsoutherly.\" In due form they took possession of the country in the name\r\nof the Commonwealth of England, receiving as a symbol of its surrender,\r\na turf of earth with an arrow shot into it. The territory thus given up\r\nby the Indians was a considerable part of what afterwards became the\r\nprovince of North Carolina. As soon as the natives had withdrawn from it\r\nto a region farther south, Yeardley built the great commander a handsome\r\nhouse, which he promised to fit up with English utensils and furniture.\r\n\r\nYeardley's people were introduced to the chief of the Tuscaroras, who\r\nreceived them courteously, and invited them to visit his country, of\r\nwhich he gave an attractive account; but his offer could not be\r\naccepted, owing to the illness of their interpreter. Upon the\r\ncompletion of his house, the Roanoke chief came, with the Tuscarora\r\nchief and forty-five others, to Yeardley's house, presented his wife and\r\nson and himself for baptism, and offered again the same symbol of the\r\nsurrender of his whole country to Yeardley; and he in his turn tendering\r\nthe same to the Commonwealth of England, prayed only \"that his own\r\nproperty and pains might not be forgotten.\" The Indian child was\r\npresented to the minister before the congregation, and having been\r\nbaptized in their presence, was left with Yeardley to be bred a\r\nChristian, \"which God grant him grace (he prays) to become.\" The charges\r\nincurred by Yeardley in purchasing and taking possession of the country,\r\nhad already amounted to three hundred pounds.[228:A]\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the assembly in November, 1654, William Hatcher being\r\nconvicted of having stigmatized Colonel Edward Hill, speaker of the\r\nhouse, as an atheist and blasphemer, (from which charges he had been\r\nbefore acquitted by the quarterly court,) was compelled to make\r\nacknowledgment of his offence, upon his knees, before Colonel Hill and\r\nthe assembly. This Hatcher appears to have been a burgess of Henrico\r\nCounty in 1652. More than twenty years afterwards, in his old age, he\r\nwas fined eight thousand pounds of pork, for the use of the king's\r\nsoldiers, on account of alleged mutinous words uttered shortly after\r\nBacon's rebellion.\r\n\r\nUpon the dissolution of the Long Parliament and the establishment of the\r\nProtectorate, Lord Baltimore took measures to recover the absolute\r\ncontrol of Maryland; and Stone, (who since June, 1652, had continued in\r\nthe place of governor of Maryland,) in obedience to instructions\r\nreceived from his lordship, violated the terms of the agreement, which\r\nhad been arranged with Bennet and Clayborne, acting in behalf of the\r\nParliament, and set them at defiance. These commissioners having\r\naddressed a letter to Stone proposing an interview, he refused to accede\r\nto it, and gave it as his opinion, that they were \"wolves in sheep's\r\nclothing.\" Bennet and Clayborne, claiming authority derived from his\r\nHighness the Lord Protector, seized the government of the province, and\r\nentrusted it to a board of ten commissioners.[229:A]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Baltimore received intelligence of this proceeding, he wrote\r\nto his deputy, (Stone,) reproaching him with cowardice, and peremptorily\r\ncommanded him to recover the colony by force of arms. Stone and the\r\nMarylanders now accordingly fell to arms, and disarmed and plundered\r\nthose that would not accept the oath of allegiance to Baltimore. The\r\nprovince contained, as has been mentioned before, among its inhabitants\r\na good many emigrants from Virginia of Puritan principles, and these\r\ndwelt mainly on the banks of the Severn and the Patuxent, and on the\r\nIsle of Kent. They were disaffected to the proprietary government, and\r\nprotested that they had removed to Maryland, under the express\r\nengagement with Governor Stone, that they should enjoy freedom of\r\nconscience, and be exempt from the obnoxious oath. These recusants now\r\ntook up arms to defend themselves, and civil war raged in infant\r\nMaryland. Stone, to reduce the malecontents, embarking for Providence\r\nwith his men, landed on the neck, at the mouth of the Severn. Here, on\r\nthe 25th of March, 1654, he was attacked by the Protestant adherents of\r\nBennet and Clayborne, and utterly defeated; the prisoners being nearly\r\ndouble of the number of the victors, twenty killed, many wounded, and\r\n\"all the place strewed with Papist beads where they fled.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the action, a New England vessel seized the boats, provision, and\r\nammunition of the governor and his party. Among the prisoners was this\r\nfunctionary, who had been \"shot in many places.\" Several of the\r\nprisoners were condemned to death by a court-martial; and four of the\r\nprincipal, one of them a councillor, were executed on the spot. Captain\r\nWilliam Stone, likewise sentenced, owed his escape to the intercession\r\nof some women, and of some of Bennet and Clayborne's people.[229:B] John\r\nHammond, (the same who had been, two years before, expelled from the\r\nVirginia Assembly,) also one of the condemned, fled in disguise, and\r\nescaped to England in the ship Crescent. The master of this vessel was\r\nafterwards heavily fined by the Virginia assembly for carrying off\r\nHammond without a pass. Of the four that were shot, three were\r\nRomanists; and the Jesuit fathers, hotly pursued, escaped to Virginia,\r\nwhere they inhabited a mean low hut.[230:A]\r\n\r\nThus Maryland became subject to the Protectorate. The administration of\r\nthe Puritan commissioners was rigorous, and the Maryland assembly\r\nexcluded Papists from the pale of religious freedom. Such were even\r\nMilton's views of toleration;[230:B] but Cromwell, the master-spirit of\r\nhis age, soared higher, and commanded the commissioners \"not to busy\r\nthemselves about religion, but to settle the civil government.\" He\r\naddressed the following letter, dated at Whitehall, in January, 1654, to\r\nRichard Bennet, Esq., Governor of Virginia:--\r\n\r\n     \"SIR:--Whereas, the differences between the Lord Baltimore and\r\n     the inhabitants of Virginia, concerning the bounds by them\r\n     respectively claimed, are depending before our council and yet\r\n     undetermined; and whereas, we are credibly informed you have,\r\n     notwithstanding, gone into his plantation in Maryland, and\r\n     countenanced some people there in opposing the Lord\r\n     Baltimore's officers; whereby and with other forces from\r\n     Virginia, you have much disturbed that colony and people, to\r\n     the engendering of tumults and much bloodshed there, if not\r\n     timely prevented:\r\n\r\n     \"We, therefore, at the request of the Lord Baltimore and\r\n     divers other persons of quality here, who are engaged by great\r\n     adventures in his interest, do, for preventing of disturbances\r\n     or tumults there, will and require you, and all others\r\n     deriving any authority from you, to forbear disturbing the\r\n     Lord Baltimore, or his officers, or people in Maryland, and to\r\n     permit all things to remain as they were before any\r\n     disturbance or alteration made by you, or by any other, upon\r\n     pretence of authority from you, till the said differences,\r\n     above mentioned, be determined by us here, and we give farther\r\n     order herein.\r\n\r\n                                \"We rest, your loving friend,\r\n                                                     \"OLIVER, P.\"\r\n\r\nCromwell was now endeavoring to heal the wounds of civil war, to allay\r\nanimosities, and to strengthen his power by a generous and conciliatory\r\npolicy, blended with irresistible energy of action. In return for Lord\r\nBaltimore's ready submission to his authority, the Protector apparently\r\nrecognized his proprietary rights in Maryland, yet at the same time, he\r\nsustained and protected his commissioners, only curbing the violent\r\ncontest that had arisen between Virginia and Maryland respecting their\r\nboundary. His policy as to the internal government of these colonies was\r\none of a masterly inactivity.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Commissioners of Maryland._\r\n\r\n                                \"WHITEHALL, 26th September, 1655.\r\n\r\n     \"SIRS:--It seems to us, by yours of the twenty-ninth of June,\r\n     and by the relation we received by Colonel Bennet, that some\r\n     mistake or scruple hath arisen concerning the sense of our\r\n     letters of the twelfth of January last; as if by our letters\r\n     we had intimated that we should have a stop put to the\r\n     proceedings of those commissioners who were authorized to\r\n     settle the civil government of Maryland. Which was not at all\r\n     intended by us; nor so much as proposed to us by those who\r\n     made addresses to us to obtain our said letter.

On the 1st of August,\r\n1656, the day following the anniversary, a number of Protestant\r\nsoldiers, aroused by the nocturnal report of the cannon, issued from\r\ntheir fort, five miles distant, rushed upon the habitations of the\r\nPapists, broke into them, and plundered whatever there was found of arms\r\nor powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[222:A] \"Virginia and Maryland,\" 11, 34; Force's Hist.

He was of an ancient and distinguished family,\r\nand had been made a member of the council in November, 1654, \"he having\r\ngiven a signal testimony of his fidelity to this colony and Commonwealth\r\nof England.\" He succeeded Bennet, who had held the office since April,\r\n1652, and who was now appointed the colony's agent at London.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1656, six or seven hundred Ricahecrian Indians having come\r\ndown from the mountains, and seated themselves near the falls of the\r\nJames River, Colonel Edward Hill, the elder, was put in command of a\r\nbody of men, and ordered to dislodge them. He was reinforced by\r\nTotopotomoi, chief of Pamunkey, with one hundred of his tribe. A creek\r\nenclosing a peninsula in Hanover County, retains the name of\r\nTotopotomoy; and Butler, in Hudibras, alludes to this chief:--\r\n\r\n     \"The mighty Tottipotimoy\r\n      Sent to our elders an envoy,\r\n      Complaining sorely of the breach\r\n      Of league held forth by brother Patch.\"\r\n\r\nHill was disgracefully defeated, and the brave Totopotomoi, with the\r\ngreater part of his warriors, slain. It appears probable that Bloody\r\nRun, near Richmond, derived its name from this sanguinary battle. The\r\naction in which so many Indians were afterwards massacred by Bacon and\r\nhis men, and with which a loose tradition has identified Bloody Run, did\r\nnot occur near the falls of the James River. Hill, in consequence of his\r\nbad conduct in this affair, was subsequently, by unanimous vote of the\r\ncouncil and the house of burgesses, condemned to pay the expenses of\r\neffecting a peace with the Indians, and was disfranchised.[234:A] During\r\nthis year an act was passed allowing all free men the right of voting\r\nfor burgesses, on the ground that \"it is something hard and unagreeable\r\nto reason that any persons shall pay equal taxes, and yet have no votes\r\nin elections.\" So republican was the elective franchise in Virginia,\r\nunder the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell two centuries ago! In this\r\nyear, 1656, Colonel Thomas Dew, of Nansemond, sometime before speaker of\r\nthe house of burgesses, and others, were authorized to explore the\r\ncountry between Cape Hatteras and Cape Fear. The County of Nansemond had\r\nlong abounded with non-conformists.\r\n\r\nThe salary of the governor, as ordered at this time, consisted of\r\ntwenty-five thousand pounds of tobacco, worth two hundred and fifty\r\npounds sterling, together with certain duties levied from masters of\r\nvessels, called castle duties, and marriage license fees. A reward of\r\ntwenty pounds was offered to any one who should import a minister;\r\nministers, with six servants each, were exempted from taxes, it being\r\nprovided that they should be examined by Mr. Philip Mallory and Mr. John\r\nGreen, and should be recommended by them to the governor and council,\r\nwho were invested with discretionary control of the matter.[234:B]\r\nLetters were sent to Matthews, Virginia's agent at the Protector's\r\ncourt, directing him to suspend for the present the further prosecution\r\nof the long and fruitless controversy with Lord Baltimore respecting the\r\ndisputed boundary.[234:C] Matthews, returning from England, was elected\r\nby the assembly to succeed Digges in the office of governor, who was now\r\nemployed as agent. Colonel Francis Morrison, speaker, was desired by the\r\nassembly to write a letter to the Protector, and another to the\r\nsecretary of state, which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS,--\r\n\r\n     \"We could not find a fitter means to represent the condition\r\n     of this country to your highness, than this worthy person, Mr.\r\n     Digges, our late governor, whose occasions calling him into\r\n     England, we have instructed him with the state of this place\r\n     as he left it; we shall beseech your highness to give credit\r\n     to his relations, which we assure ourselves shall be faithful,\r\n     having had many experiences of his candor in the time of his\r\n     government, which he hath managed under your highness, with so\r\n     much moderation, prudence, and justice, that we should be much\r\n     larger in expressing this truth, but that we fear to have\r\n     already too much trespassed, by interrupting your highness'\r\n     most serious thoughts in greater affairs than what can concern\r\n     your highness' most humble, most devoted servants.\r\n\r\n     \"Dated from the Assembly of Virginia, 15th December, 1656.\"\r\n\r\n     Superscribed, for his \"Highness, the Lord Protector.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter to the secretary of state was as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"RIGHT HONORABLE,--\r\n\r\n     \"Though we are persons so remote from you, we have heard so\r\n     honorable a character of your worth, that we cannot make a\r\n     second choice without erring, of one so fit and proper as\r\n     yourself to make our addresses to his Highness, the Lord\r\n     Protector. Our desires we have intrusted to that worthy\r\n     gentleman, Mr. Digges, our late governor; we shall desire you\r\n     would please to give him access to you and by your highness.\r\n     And as we promise you will find nothing but worth in him, so\r\n     we are confident he will undertake for us that we are a people\r\n     not altogether ungrateful, but will find shortly a nearer way\r\n     than by saying so, to express really how much we esteem the\r\n     honor of your patronage, which is both the hopes and ambition\r\n     of your very humble and then obliged servants.\r\n\r\n     \"From the Assembly of Virginia, 15th December, 1656.\"\r\n\r\n     Superscribed, to the \"Right Honorable John Thurlow, Secretary\r\n     of State.\"\r\n\r\nThe allusion in the close of the letter appears to be to a douceur which\r\nit was intended to present to the secretary.\r\n\r\nDigges was instructed to unite with Matthews and Bennet, in London, and\r\nto treat with the leading merchants in the Virginia trade, and to let\r\nthem know how much the assembly had endeavored to diminish the quantity,\r\nand improve the quality of the tobacco; and to see what the merchants,\r\non their part, would be willing to do in giving a better price; for if\r\nthe planters should find that the bad brought as high a price as the\r\ngood, they would of course raise that which could be raised the most\r\neasily.[236:A] It appears that Digges was appointed agent conjointly\r\nwith Bennet. Matthews was elected by the assembly to succeed Digges as\r\ngovernor; but the latter was requested to hold the office as long as he\r\nshould remain in Virginia. Digges departing for England toward the close\r\nof 1655, would appear to have co-operated for a short while with both\r\nMatthews and Bennet. By a singular coincidence, Digges, Matthews, and\r\nBennet, who were the first three governors of Virginia under the\r\nCommonwealth of England, were transferred from the miniature metropolis,\r\nJamestown, and found themselves together near the court of his Highness\r\nthe Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\nDigges was succeeded as governor by Matthews, early in the year 1656.\r\nThe laws of the colony were revised, and reduced into one volume,\r\ncomprising one hundred and thirty-one acts, well adapted to the wants of\r\nthe people and the condition of the country. Of the transactions from\r\n1656 to 1660, the year of the restoration, Burk says there is an entire\r\nchasm in the records; Hening, on the contrary, declares that, \"in no\r\nportion of the colonial records under the Commonwealth, are the\r\nmaterials so copious as from 1656 to 1660.\" The editor of the Statutes\r\nat Large is the better authority on this point.\r\n\r\nThe church government was settled by giving the people the entire\r\ncontrol of the vestry; while the appointment of ministers and church\r\nwardens, the care of the poor, and parochial matters, were entrusted to\r\nthe people of each parish. An act was passed for the keeping holy the\r\nSabbath, and another against divulgers of false news. The ordinary\r\nweight of a hogshead of tobacco at this time did not exceed three\r\nhundred and fifty pounds, and its dimensions by law were forty-three\r\ninches long and twenty-six wide. Letters, superscribed \"For the Public\r\nService,\" were ordered to be conveyed from one plantation to another,\r\nto the place of destination. A remedy was provided for servants\r\ncomplaining of harsh usage, or of insufficient food or raiment. The\r\npenalty for selling arms or ammunition to the Indians was the forfeiture\r\nof the offender's whole estate. It was enacted that no sheriff, or\r\ndeputy sheriff, then called under-sheriff, should hold his office longer\r\nthan one year in any one county. The penalty of being reduced to\r\nservitude was abolished. The twenty-second day of March and the\r\neighteenth of April were still kept as holy days, in commemoration of\r\nthe deliverance of the colonists from the bloody Indian massacres of\r\n1622 and 1644. The planters were prohibited from encroaching upon the\r\nlands of the Indians. The vessels of all nations were admitted into the\r\nports of Virginia; and an impost duty of ten shillings a hogshead was\r\nlaid on all tobacco exported, except that laden in English vessels, and\r\nbound directly for England; from the payment of which duty vessels\r\nbelonging to Virginians were afterwards exempted. An act was passed to\r\nprohibit the kidnapping of Indian children.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1656 all acts against mercenary attorneys were repealed; but\r\ntwo years afterwards attorneys were again expelled from the\r\ncourts,[237:A] and no one was suffered to receive any compensation for\r\nserving in that capacity. The governor and council made serious\r\nopposition to this act, and the following communication was made to the\r\nhouse of burgesses: \"The governor and council will consent to this\r\nproposition so far as shall be agreeable to Magna Charta. WM.\r\nCLAYBORNE.\" The burgesses replied, that they could not see any such\r\nprohibition contained in Magna Charta; that two former assemblies had\r\npassed such a law, and that it had stood in force upwards of ten years.\r\nIt thus appears that Magna Charta was held to be in force in the colony.\r\n\r\nThe ground leaves of tobacco, or lugs, were declared to be not\r\nmerchantable; and it was ordered that no tobacco should be planted after\r\nthe tenth day of July, under the penalty of a fine of ten thousand\r\npounds of that staple. The exportation of hides, wool, and old iron, was\r\nforbidden. The salary of the governor, derived from the impost duty on\r\ntobacco exported, was fixed at sixteen hundred pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nThe burgesses having rescinded the order admitting the governor and\r\ncouncil as members of the house, and having voted an adjournment,\r\nMatthews, on the 1st of April, 1658, declared a dissolution of the\r\nassembly. The house resisted, and declared that any burgess who should\r\ndepart at this conjuncture, should be censured as betraying the trust\r\nreposed in him by his country; and an oath of secrecy was administered\r\nto the members. The governor, upon receiving an assurance that the\r\nbusiness of the house would be speedily and satisfactorily concluded,\r\nrevoked the order of dissolution, referring the question in dispute, as\r\nto the dissolving power, to his Highness the Lord Protector. The\r\nburgesses, still unsatisfied, appointed a committee, of which Colonel\r\nJohn Carter, of Lancaster County, was chairman, to draw up a resolution\r\nasserting their powers; and in consonance with their report the\r\nburgesses made a declaration of popular sovereignty: that they had in\r\nthemselves the full power of appointing all officers, until they should\r\nreceive an order to the contrary from England; that the house was not\r\ndissolvable by any power yet extant in Virginia but their own; that all\r\nformer elections of governor and council should be void; that the power\r\nof governor for the future should be conferred on Colonel Samuel\r\nMatthews, who by them was invested with all the rights and privileges\r\nbelonging to the governor and captain-general of Virginia; and that a\r\ncouncil should be appointed by the burgesses then convened, with the\r\nadvice of the governor.\r\n\r\nThe legislative records do not disclose the particular ground on which\r\nthe previous elections of governor and appointments of councillors under\r\nthe provisional government were annulled; but from the exclusion of the\r\ngovernor and council from the house, it might be inferred that it was\r\nowing to a jealousy of these functionaries being members of the body\r\nthat elected them. Yet Bennet, the first of the three governors, and his\r\ncouncil, were, in 1652, expressly allowed to be _ex officio_ members of\r\nthe assembly. An order was also made, April 2d, 1758, by the assembly,\r\nin the name of his Highness the Lord Protector, to the sheriff of James\r\nCity, and sergeant-at-arms, to obey no warrant but those signed by the\r\nspeaker of the house; and William Clayborne, secretary of state, (under\r\nBennet, Digges, and Matthews,) was directed to deliver the records to\r\nthe assembly. The oath of office was administered to Governor Matthews\r\nby the committee before mentioned, and the members of the council\r\nnominated by the governor and approved by the house, took the same\r\noath.[239:A]\r\n\r\nThe number of burgesses present at the session commencing in March,\r\n1659, was thirty. Colonel Edward Hill, who had been disfranchised,\r\nwas now unanimously elected speaker. Colonel Moore Fantleroy, of\r\nRappahannock County, not being present at the election, \"moved against\r\nhim, as if clandestinely elected, and taxed the house of unwarrantable\r\nproceedings therein.\" He was suspended until the next day, when,\r\nacknowledging his error, he was readmitted.\r\n\r\nAny member absent from the house was subject to a penalty of twenty\r\npounds of tobacco. A member \"disguised with overmuch drink\" forfeited\r\none hundred pounds of tobacco. A burgess was required to rise from his\r\nseat, and to remain uncovered, while speaking. The oath was administered\r\nto the burgesses by a committee of three sent from the council.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[234:A] Hening, i. 402, 422; Burk's Hist. of Va., ii. 107.\r\n\r\n[234:B] Hening, i. 424.\r\n\r\n[234:C] Burk's Hist. of Va., ii. 116.

But it hath pleased the Lord, on Friday,\r\n     the third of this month, to take him out of the world, his\r\n     said highness having in his lifetime, according to the humble\r\n     petition and advice, appointed and declared the most noble and\r\n     illustrious lord, the Lord Richard, eldest son to his late\r\n     highness, to be his successor, who hath been accordingly, with\r\n     general consent and applause of all, proclaimed Protector of\r\n     this Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the\r\n     dominions and territories thereunto belonging. And, therefore,\r\n     we have thought fit to signify the same unto you, whom we\r\n     require, according to your duty, that you cause his said\r\n     Highness, Richard, Lord Protector, forthwith to be proclaimed\r\n     in all parts of your colony. And his highness' council have\r\n     thought fit hereby to assure you, that the settlement of that\r\n     colony is not neglected; and to let you know, that you may\r\n     expect shortly to receive a more express testimony of his\r\n     highness' care in that behalf; till the further perfecting\r\n     whereof, their lordships do, will, and require you, the\r\n     present governor and council there, to apply yourselves with\r\n     all seriousness, faithfulness, and circumspection, to the\r\n     peaceable and orderly management of the affairs of that\r\n     colony, according to such good laws and customs (not repugnant\r\n     to the laws of England) as have been heretofore used and\r\n     exercised among you, improving your best endeavors as for\r\n     maintaining the civil peace, so for promoting the interest of\r\n     religion, wherein you will receive from hence all just\r\n     countenance and encouragement. And if any person shall\r\n     presume, by any undue ways, to interrupt the quiet or hazard\r\n     the safety of his highness' people there, order will be taken,\r\n     upon the representation of such proceedings, to make further\r\n     provision for securing of your peace in such a way as shall be\r\n     found meet and necessary, and for calling those to a strict\r\n     account who shall endeavor to disturb it.\r\n\r\n     \"Signed in the name and by the order of the council.\r\n\r\n                                       \"H. LAWRENCE, _President_.\r\n\r\n     \"Whitehall, 7th September, 1658.\"\r\n\r\n     Superscription, to the \"Governor and Council of his Highness'\r\n     Colony of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the reading of this letter, the governor and council withdrew from\r\nthe assembly; and the house of burgesses unanimously acknowledged their\r\nobedience to his Highness, Richard, Lord Protector, and fully recognized\r\nhis power.[241:A] So much truth is there in Mr. Jefferson's\r\nremark,[241:B] that in the contest with the house of Stuart, Virginia\r\naccompanied the footsteps of the mother country. The government of\r\nVirginia under the Commonwealth of England was wholly provisional. By\r\nthe convention of March the 12th, 1652, Virginia secured to herself her\r\nancient limits, and was entitled to reclaim that part of her chartered\r\nterritory which had been unjustly and illegally given away to Lord\r\nBaltimore. In this, however, owing to the perplexed condition of affairs\r\nin England, Virginia was disappointed; but she secured, by the articles\r\nof convention, free trade, exemption from taxation, save by her own\r\nassembly, and exclusion of military force from her borders. Yet all\r\nthese rights were violated by subsequent kings and parliaments.[242:A]\r\n\r\nThe administration of the colonial government, under the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland, was judicious and beneficent; the people were free, harmonious,\r\nand prosperous; and while Cromwell's sceptre commanded the respect of\r\nthe world, he exhibited toward the infant and loyal colony a generous\r\nand politic lenity; and during this interval she enjoyed free trade,\r\nlegislative independence, civil and religious freedom, republican\r\ninstitutions, and internal peace. The Governors Bennet, Digges, and\r\nMatthews, by their patriotic virtues, enjoyed the confidence, and\r\naffection, and respect of the people; no extravagance, rapacity,\r\ncorruption, or extortion was charged against their administration;\r\nintolerance and persecution were unknown. But rapine, corruption,\r\nextortion, intolerance, and persecution were all soon to be revived\r\nunder the restored dynasty of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nRichard Cromwell resigned the Protectorate on the 22d day of April,\r\n1659. Matthews, the governor, had died in the preceding January. England\r\nwas without a monarch; Virginia without a governor. It was during this\r\ninterval that public opinion in England was in suspense, the result of\r\naffairs depending upon the line of conduct which might be pursued by\r\nGeneral Monk. The Virginia assembly, convening on the 13th day of March,\r\n1660, declared by their first act that as there was then in England no\r\nresident, absolute, and generally acknowledged power, therefore the\r\nsupreme government of the colony should rest in the assembly; and writs\r\npreviously issued in the name of his Highness, the Lord Protector, now\r\nissued in the name of the Grand Assembly of Virginia. By the second act,\r\nSir William Berkley was elected governor; he was required to call a\r\ngrand assembly once in two years at the least, and was restricted from\r\ndissolving the assembly without its consent. The circumstances of\r\nthis reappointment of Sir William Berkley have been frequently\r\nmisrepresented; historians from age to age following each other in\r\nfabulous tradition, erroneous conjecture, or wilful perversion, have\r\nasserted that Sir William was hurried from retirement by a torrent of\r\npopular enthusiasm, and made governor by acclamation, and that Charles\r\nthe Second was boldly proclaimed in Virginia, and his standard reared\r\nseveral months, some say sixteen, before the restoration; and thus the\r\nVirginians, as they had been the last of the king's subjects who\r\nrenounced their allegiance, so they were the first who returned to\r\nit![243:A]\r\n\r\nError in history is like a flock of sheep jumping over a bridge; if one\r\ngoes, the rest all follow. Sir William Berkley, as has been before\r\nmentioned, was not elected by a tumultuary assemblage of the people, but\r\nby the assembly; the royal standard was not raised upon the occasion,\r\nnor was the king proclaimed. The bulk of the Virginia planters\r\nundoubtedly retained their habitual attachment to monarchy and to the\r\nEstablished Church; and some royalist refugees had been driven hither\r\nby the civil war. Yet, as the colonists had formerly been greatly\r\ndissatisfied with some acts of the government during the reign of\r\nCharles the First, they certainly had much reason to approve of the\r\nwise, and liberal, and magnanimous policy of Cromwell. Besides this, a\r\ngood many republicans and Puritans had found their way to Virginia. The\r\npredominant feeling, however, in Virginia as in England, was in favor of\r\nthe restoration of Charles the Second. Sir William Berkley, in his\r\nspeech addressed to the assembly on their proffer of the place of\r\ngovernor, said: \"I do, therefore, in the presence of God and you, make\r\nthis safe protestation for us all, that if any supreme settled power\r\nappears, I will immediately lay down my commission, but will live most\r\nsubmissively obedient to any power God shall set over me, as the\r\nexperience of eight years has shewed I have done.\" In his address to the\r\nhouse of burgesses, he alludes to the late king, as \"my most gracious\r\nmaster, King Charles, of ever blessed memory,\" and as \"my ever honored\r\nmaster, who was put to a violent death.\" The Berkleys were staunch\r\nadherents of Charles the First, and extreme royalists. Referring in his\r\naddress to the surrender of the colony, Sir William said, that the\r\nparliament \"sent a small power to force my submission, which, finding me\r\ndefenceless, was quietly (God pardon me) effected.\" Of the several\r\nparliaments and the protectorate he remarked: \"And I believe, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, (Theodorick Bland,) you think, if my voice had been prevalent\r\nin most of their elections, I would not voluntarily have made choice of\r\nthem for my supremes. But, Mr. Speaker, all this I have said, is only to\r\nmake this truth apparent to you, that in and under all these mutable\r\ngovernments of divers natures and constitutions, I have lived most\r\nresignedly submissive. But, Mr. Speaker, it is one duty to live obedient\r\nto a government, and another of a very different nature, to command\r\nunder it.\" It thus appears that Sir William accepted the place hoping\r\nfor the restoration of Charles the Second; but with an explicit pledge,\r\nthat he would resign in case that event should not occur.[244:A] This\r\nspeech was made March the nineteenth, and on the twenty-first the\r\ncouncil unanimously concurred in his election. The members were Richard\r\nBennet, (late Puritan Governor,) William Bernard, John Walker, George\r\nReade, Thomas Pettus, William Clayborne, Edward Hill, Thomas Dew, Edward\r\nCarter, Thomas Swan, and Augustine Warner. Nearly all of these were\r\ncolonels. The title of colonel and member of the council appears to have\r\nbeen a sort of order of nobility in Virginia. Sir William Berkley was\r\nelected two months before the restoration of Charles the Second, which\r\ntook place on the 20th of May, 1660, that being his birth-day. Yet the\r\nword \"king\" or \"majesty\" nowhere occurs in the legislative records, from\r\nthe commencement of the Commonwealth of England until the 11th day of\r\nOctober, 1660, more than four months after the restoration.[244:B]\r\nVirginia was indeed loyal, but she was too feeble to avow her loyalty.\r\n\r\nAn act was passed, entitled an act for the suppressing the Quakers; the\r\npreamble of which describes them as an unreasonable and turbulent sort\r\nof people, who daily gather together unlawful assemblies of people,\r\nteaching lies, miracles, false visions, prophecies, and doctrines\r\ntending to disturb the peace, disorganize society, and destroy all law,\r\nand government, and religion. Masters of vessels were prohibited from\r\nbringing in any of that sect, under the penalty of one hundred pounds of\r\ntobacco; all of them to be apprehended and committed, until they should\r\ngive security that they would leave the colony; if they should return,\r\nthey should be punished, and returning the third time should be\r\nproceeded against as felons. No person should entertain any Quakers that\r\nhad been questioned by the governor and council; nor permit any assembly\r\nof them in or near his house, under the penalty of one hundred pounds\r\nsterling; and no person to publish their books, pamphlets, and\r\nlibels.[245:A] This act was passed in March, 1660, shortly after the\r\nelection of Sir William Berkley.\r\n\r\nOf late years, certain masters of vessels trading to Virginia, in\r\nviolation of the laws and of the articles of surrender granting the\r\nprivilege of free trade, had \"molested, troubled, and seized divers\r\nships, sloops, and vessels, coming to trade with us.\" The assembly\r\ntherefore required every master to give bond not to molest any person\r\ntrading under the protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nAct XVI. establishes free trade: \"Whereas, the restriction of trade hath\r\nappeared to be the greatest impediment to the advance of the estimation\r\nand value of our present only commodity, tobacco, _be it enacted and\r\nconfirmed_, That the Dutch, and all strangers of what Christian nation\r\nsoever, in amity with the people of England, shall have free liberty to\r\ntrade with us for all allowable commodities.\" And it was provided, \"That\r\nif the said Dutch, or other foreigners, shall import any negro slaves,\r\nthey, the said Dutch, or others, shall, for the tobacco really produced\r\nby the sale of the said negro, pay only the impost of two shillings per\r\nhogshead, the like being paid by our own nation.\" The regular impost\r\nbeing ten shillings, this exemption was a bounty of eight shillings per\r\nhogshead for the encouragement of the importation of negroes.[245:B]\r\n\r\nWhen Argall, in 1614, returning from his half-piratical excursion\r\nagainst the French at Port Royal, entered what is now New York Bay, he\r\nfound three or four huts erected there by Dutch mariners and fishermen,\r\non the Island of Manhattan. Near half a century had since elapsed, and\r\nthe colony planted there had grown to an importance that justified\r\nsomething of diplomatic correspondence. In the spring of 1660 Nicholas\r\nVarleth and Brian Newton were sent by Governor Stuyvesant, celebrated by\r\nKnickerbocker, from Fort Amsterdam to Virginia, for the purpose of\r\nforming a league acknowledging the Dutch title to New York. Sir William\r\nBerkley evaded the proposition in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,--I have received the letter you were pleased to send me\r\n     by Mr. Mills his vessel, and shall be ever ready to comply\r\n     with you in all acts of neighborly friendship and amity; but\r\n     truly, sir, you desire me to do that concerning your letter\r\n     and claims to land in the northern part of America which I am\r\n     incapable to do, for I am but a servant of the assembly's;\r\n     neither do they arrogate any power to themselves further than\r\n     the miserable distractions of England force them to. For when\r\n     God shall be pleased in His mercy to take away and dissipate\r\n     the unnatural divisions of their native country, they will\r\n     immediately return to their own professed obedience. What then\r\n     they should do in matters of contract, donation, and\r\n     confession of right, would have little strength or\r\n     signification; much more presumptive and impertinent would it\r\n     be in me to do it, without their knowledge or assent. We shall\r\n     very shortly meet again, and then, if to them you signify your\r\n     desires, I shall labor all I can to get you a satisfactory\r\n     answer.\r\n\r\n                            \"I am, sir, your humble servant,\r\n                                                \"WILLIAM BERKLEY.\r\n\r\n     \"Virginia, August 20th, 1660.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant, the last of the Dutch governors of New Amsterdam,\r\nwithin a few years was dispossessed by a small English squadron, and the\r\ncaptured colony was retained. Sir William Berkley's letter was written\r\nnearly three months after the actual restoration, and yet, not having\r\nreceived intelligence of it, he alludes to the English government as in\r\na state of interregnum, and writes not one word in present recognition\r\nof his majesty Charles the Second; on the contrary, he expressly avows\r\nhimself a servant of the assembly.\r\n\r\nTea was introduced into England about this time; the East India Company\r\nmade the king a formal present of two pounds and two ounces.[247:A]\r\n\r\nThe address of the Parliament and General Monk to Charles the Second,\r\nthen at Breda, in Holland, was carried over by Lord Berkley, of Berkley\r\nCastle. On the eighth of May Charles was proclaimed in England king, and\r\nhe returned in triumph to London on the twenty-ninth of that month,\r\nbeing his birth-day. The restored monarch transmitted a new commission,\r\ndated July the 31st, 1660, at Westminster, to his faithful adherent Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley. He had remained in Virginia during the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland under various pretexts, and it is probable that he kept up a\r\nsecret correspondence with refugee royalists, and it is said that he\r\neven invited Charles to come over to Virginia. This tradition, however,\r\nis without proof or plausibility; had the exiled Charles sought refuge\r\nin Virginia, an English frigate would have found it easy to make him a\r\nprisoner. Virginia would have presented few attractions to the royal\r\nprofligate; and it could have hardly been a matter of regret to the\r\nVirginians that he never came here. Sir William Berkley's letter of\r\nacknowledgment, written in March, 1661, is extravagantly loyal. He\r\napologizes for having accepted office from the assembly thus: \"It was no\r\nmore, may it please your majesty, than to leap over the fold to save\r\nyour majesty's flock, when your majesty's enemies of that fold had\r\nbarred up the lawful entrance into it, and enclosed the wolves of schism\r\nand rebellion, ready to devour all within it,\" etc. By \"the wolves of\r\nschism and rebellion\" he probably meant the Puritan and Republican party\r\nin Virginia, and he appears to have looked upon them as formidable\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nCharles the Second, in the first year of his reign, that is, in the\r\nfirst year after the death of his father, for he was considered or\r\nimagined to have reigned all the while, had granted all the tract of\r\nland lying between the Rappahannock and the Potomac, known as the\r\nNorthern Neck, to Lord Hopton, the Earl of St. Albans, Lord Culpepper,\r\nand others, to hold the same forever, paying yearly six pounds thirteen\r\nshillings and four pence to the crown.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-American colonies now established, Virginia, New England, and\r\nMaryland, contained eighty-five thousand inhabitants. The navigation act\r\nhad not been recognized by Virginia as obligatory on her; had been\r\nopposed by Massachusetts as an invasion of her rights; and had been\r\nevaded by Maryland. James the First, Charles the First, and the\r\nCommonwealth, had expressly exempted the colonies from direct taxation,\r\nbut the Restoration parliament extended the customs of tonnage and\r\npoundage to every part of the dominion of the crown; and the colonists\r\ndid not for years resist the collection of those imposts.[248:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[241:A] Hening, i. 509.\r\n\r\n[241:B] Preface to T.

The plantations lay dispersed along the banks\r\nof rivers and creeks, those on the James stretching westward, above a\r\nhundred miles into the interior. Each parish extended many miles in\r\nlength along the river-side, but in breadth ran back only a mile. This\r\nwas the average breadth of the plantations, their length varying from\r\nhalf a mile to three miles or more. The fifty parishes comprehending an\r\narea supposed to be equal to one-half of England, it was inevitable that\r\nmany of the inhabitants lived very remote from the parish church. Many\r\nparishes, indeed, were as yet destitute of churches and glebes; and not\r\nmore than ten parishes were supplied with ministers. Hammond[249:A]\r\nsays: \"They then began to provide, and send home for gospel ministers,\r\nand largely contributed for their maintenance; but Virginia savoring not\r\nhandsomely in England, very few of good conversation would adventure\r\nthither, (as thinking it a place wherein surely the fear of God was\r\nnot,) yet many came, such as wore black coats, and could babble in a\r\npulpit, roar in a tavern, exact from their parishioners, and rather by\r\ntheir dissoluteness destroy than feed their flocks.\" Hammond's\r\nstatements are not to be unreservedly received. Where there were\r\nministers, worship was usually held once on Sunday; but the remote\r\nparishioners seldom attended. The planters, either from indifference or\r\nfrom the want of means, were remiss in the building of churches and the\r\nmaintenance of ministers. Through the licentious lives of many of them,\r\nthe Christian religion was dishonored, and the name of God blasphemed\r\namong the heathen natives, (who were near them and often among them,)\r\nand thus their conversion hindered.[250:A]\r\n\r\nIn 1661 the Rev. Philip Mallory was sent over to England as Virginia's\r\nagent to solicit the cause of the church. The general want of schools,\r\nlikewise owing to the sparseness of the population, was most of all\r\nbewailed by parents. The children of Virginia, naturally of beautiful\r\npersons, and generally of more genius than those in England, were doomed\r\nto grow up unserviceable for any great employments in church or state.\r\nAs a principal remedy for these ills, the establishment of towns in each\r\ncounty was recommended. It was further proposed to erect schools in the\r\ncolony, and for the supply of ministers to establish, by act of\r\nparliament, Virginia fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge, with an\r\nengagement to serve the church in Virginia for seven years. To raise the\r\nfunds necessary for this purpose, it was proposed to take up a\r\ncollection in the churches of Great Britain; and the assembly ordered a\r\npetition to the king to that end, to be drawn up.[250:B] Another feature\r\nof this plan was to send over a bishop, so soon as there should be a\r\ncity for his see. These recommendations, although urged upon the\r\nattention of the bishop of London, seem, from whatever cause, to have\r\nproved fruitless. The Virginia assembly, in no instance, expressed any\r\ndesire for the appointment of a bishop; they remembered with abhorrence\r\nthe cruelties that had been exercised by the prelates in England.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson remarked that the legislature of Virginia has frequently\r\ndeclared that there should be towns in places where nature had declared\r\nthat they should not be. The scheme of compelling the planters to\r\nabandon their plantations, and to congregate in towns, built by\r\nlegislation, was indeed chimerical. The failure of the schemes proposed\r\nin the Virginia assembly for the establishment of towns, is attributed\r\nby the author of \"Virginia's Cure\" to the majority of the house of\r\nburgesses, who are said to have come over at first as servants, and who,\r\nalthough they may have accumulated by their industry competent estates,\r\nyet, owing to their mean education, were incompetent to judge of public\r\nmatters, either in church or state. Yet many of the early laws appear to\r\nhave been judicious, practical, and well adapted to the circumstances of\r\na newly settled country. The legislature, eventually finding the scheme\r\nof establishing towns by legal enactments impracticable, declared it\r\nexpedient to leave trade to regulate itself.\r\n\r\nThe assembly of March, 1661, consisted in the main of new members. At\r\nanother session held in October of the same year, there appeared still\r\nfewer of the members who had held seats during the Commonwealth; and it\r\nmay be reasonably inferred that the bulk of the retiring members were\r\nwell affected to the Commonwealth of England. Intelligence of the\r\nrestoration of Charles the Second had already reached Virginia, and was\r\njoyfully received. The word \"king,\" or \"majesty,\" was used in the public\r\nacts now for the first time, since the commencement of the Commonwealth\r\nof England--an interval of twelve years.\r\n\r\nAn address was sent to the king, praying him to pardon the inhabitants\r\nof Virginia for having yielded to a force--which they could not resist.\r\nForty-four thousand pounds of tobacco, worth two thousand and two\r\nhundred dollars, were appropriated to Major-General Hammond and Colonel\r\nGuy Molesworth, for \"being employed in the address.\" Sir Henry Moody was\r\ndispatched on an embassy \"to the Manados,\" or Manhattan. Colonel Carter\r\nwas required to declare what passed between him and Colonel William\r\nClayborne at the assembly of 1653 or 1654, relative to the making an act\r\nof non-address to the Right Honorable Sir William Berkley; but the\r\nparticulars of this affair have not been handed down. The rent paid for\r\nthe use of the house where the assembly met, was three thousand five\r\nhundred pounds of tobacco, equivalent to one hundred and seventy-five\r\ndollars. Four thousand pounds of tobacco, worth two hundred dollars,\r\nwere paid for the rent of the room where the governor and council held\r\ntheir meetings. The name of Monroe occurs at this early day in the\r\nCounty of Westmoreland as one of the commissioners, or justices of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe assembly strove to display its loyalty by bountiful appropriations\r\nto the governor and the leading royalists; the restoration in England\r\nwas reflected by the restoration in Virginia. The necessity of the case\r\nhad made the government of the colony republican; she was as free and\r\nalmost as independent during the Commonwealth of England as after the\r\nrevolution of 1776. For a short time even Sir William Berkley appears to\r\nhave been identified with this system. He and the new assembly were now\r\neagerly running in an opposite tack, and were impatient to wipe out all\r\ntraces of their late forced disobedience and involuntary recognition of\r\nthe popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nSir William continued as governor till the 30th of April, 1661, when\r\nbeing about to visit England, Colonel Francis Morrison was elected by\r\nthe council in his place. Sir William, it is said, was dispatched to\r\nEngland as agent to defend the colony against the monopoly of the\r\nnavigation act, which threatened to violate their \"freedoms,\" as is\r\ndeclared by the first act of the assembly held at James City, on the 23d\r\nof March, 1661. Sir William was heartily opposed to the restrictions on\r\nthe commerce of Virginia; but any efforts that he may have used in\r\nopposition to them were fruitless.\r\n\r\nHe embarked in May for England, and returned in the fall of the\r\nfollowing year, 1662. His pay on account of this mission was two hundred\r\nthousand pounds of tobacco, or five hundred and seventy-one hogsheads,\r\nthe average weight of a hogshead at this period being three hundred and\r\nfifty pounds.[252:A] This quantity of tobacco was worth two thousand\r\npounds sterling, or ten thousand dollars.[253:A] The ordinary salary of\r\nthe governor consisted of castle duties, license fees, tobacco, corn,\r\nand customs, and probably amounted to not less than twelve thousand\r\ndollars per annum.[253:B]\r\n\r\nThe assembly's tone was now altered; during the Commonwealth of England,\r\nOliver Cromwell had been addressed as \"His Highness,\" and the burgesses\r\nhad subscribed themselves his \"most humble, most devoted servants;\" nor\r\nhad Richard Cromwell been treated with a less obsequious and respectful\r\nsubmission. But now the following language was employed: \"Whereas, our\r\nlate surrender and submission to that execrable power, that so bloodily\r\nmassacred the late King Charles the First of ever blessed and glorious\r\nmemory, hath made us, by acknowledging them, guilty of their crimes; to\r\nshow our serious and hearty repentance and detestation of that barbarous\r\nact, be it enacted, That the thirtieth of January, the day the said king\r\nwas beheaded, be annually solemnized with fasting and prayers, that our\r\nsorrows may expiate our crime, and our tears wash away our\r\nguilt.\"[253:C] Their compulsory acknowledgment of the sovereign power of\r\nthe Commonwealth of England, if they all the while remained in their\r\nhearts loyal, could not have implicated them in the execution of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nColonel Francis Morrison continued to fill the place of Sir William\r\nBerkley until his return, which took place some time between September\r\nand the 21st of November, 1662.\r\n\r\nAn act was passed, entitled \"Women causing scandalous suits, to be\r\nducked:\" \"Whereas, oftentimes many brabbling women often slander and\r\nscandalize their neighbors, for which their poor husbands are often\r\nbrought into chargeable and vexatious suits, and cast in great damages;\r\nbe it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in actions of\r\nslander occasioned by the wife, as aforesaid, after judgment passed for\r\nthe damages, the woman shall be punished by ducking; and if the slander\r\nbe so enormous as to be adjudged at a greater damage than five hundred\r\npounds of tobacco, then the woman to suffer a ducking for each five\r\nhundred pounds of tobacco against the husband adjudged, if he refuse to\r\npay the tobacco.\" A ducking-stool had been already established in each\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary both of the birth and the restoration of Charles the\r\nSecond was established as a holiday. The navigation act was now enforced\r\nin Virginia, and in consequence the price of tobacco fell very low,\r\nwhile the cost of imported goods was also augmented. An act prohibiting\r\nthe importation of luxuries seems to have been negatived by the\r\ngovernor. It was ordered that \"no person shall trade with the Indians\r\nfor any beaver, otter, or any other furs, unless he first obtain a\r\ncommission from the governor.\" This act gave great offence to the\r\npeople; it was in effect conferring on the governor an indirect monopoly\r\nof the fur-trade. By a still more high-handed measure the governor and\r\ncouncil were empowered to lay taxes for the ensuing three years, unless\r\nin the mean time some urgent occasion should necessitate the calling\r\ntogether of the assembly. Thus taxation was dissevered from\r\nrepresentation; the main safeguard of freedom was given to the\r\nexecutive. Major John Bond, a magistrate in Isle of Wight County, was\r\ndisfranchised for \"factious and schismatical demeanors.\" He had\r\nrepeatedly been returned as one of the burgesses of his county during\r\nthe Commonwealth of England. An act making provision for a college,\r\nappears to have remained a dead letter; other acts equally futile,\r\npassed at ensuing sessions, frequently recur. The assembly ventured to\r\ndeclare that the king's pardon did not extend to a penalty incurred for\r\nplanting tobacco contrary to law.\r\n\r\nColonel William Clayborne, secretary of state, was displaced by Thomas\r\nLudwell, commissioned by the king. Colonel Francis Morrison and Henry\r\nRandolph, clerk of the assembly, were appointed revisers of the laws.\r\nBeverley[254:A] says that Morrison made an abridgement of the laws. In\r\nthis revised code the common law of England is, for the first time,\r\nexpressly adopted, being spoken of as \"those excellent and oft-refined\r\nlaws of England.\"[254:B] But it has been seen that Magna Charta had been\r\npreviously recognized as of force in Virginia. In making a revision of\r\nthe laws it was ordered that all acts which \"might keep in memory our\r\nforced deviation from his majesty's obedience,\" should be repealed \"and\r\nexpunged.\" In the absence of ministers it was enacted that readers\r\nshould be appointed, where they could be found, with the advice and\r\nconsent of the nearest ministers, to read the prayers and homilies, and\r\ncatechise children and servants, as had been practised in the time of\r\nQueen Elizabeth. Although not more than one-fifth of the parishes were\r\nsupplied with ministers, yet the laws demanded a strict conformity, and\r\nrequired all to contribute to the support of the established church. But\r\nthe right of presentation still remained in the people. The number of\r\nthe vestry was limited to twelve, elected by the people, but they were\r\nnow invested with the power of perpetuating their own body by filling\r\nvacancies themselves.[255:A] Vestries were ordered to procure\r\nsubscriptions for the support of the ministry. The number of burgesses\r\nto represent each county was limited to two; the number of magistrates\r\nto twelve. The assembly confirmed an order of the quarter court\r\nprohibiting \"Roger Partridge and Elizabeth, his wife, from keeping any\r\nmaid-servant for the term of three years.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly say, that \"they have set down certain rules to be observed\r\nin the government of the church, until God shall please to turn his\r\nmajesty's pious thoughts\" toward them, and \"provide a better supply of\r\nministers.\" \"The pious thoughts\" of Charles the Second were never turned\r\nto this remote corner of his empire. Magistrates, heretofore called\r\ncommissioners, were now styled \"justices of the peace,\" and their courts\r\n\"county courts.\"[255:B] A duty was laid on rum, because \"it had, by\r\nexperience, been found to bring diseases and death to divers people.\" An\r\nimpost, first established during the Commonwealth of England, was still\r\nlevied on every hogshead of tobacco exported; this became a permanent\r\nsource of revenue, and rendered the executive independent of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThe numerous acts relating to the Indians were reduced into one:\r\nprohibiting the English from purchasing Indian lands; securing their\r\npersons and property; preventing encroachments on their territory;\r\nordering the English seated near to assist them in fencing their\r\ncorn-fields; licensing them to oyster, fish, hunt, and gather the\r\nnatural fruits of the country; prohibiting trade with them without\r\nlicense, or imprisonment of an Indian chief without special warrant;\r\nbounds to be annually defined; badges of silver and copper plate to be\r\nfurnished to Indian chiefs; no Indian to enter the English confines\r\nwithout a badge, under penalty of imprisonment, till ransomed by one\r\nhundred arms'-length of roanoke; Indian chiefs tributary to the English,\r\nto give alarm of approach of hostile Indians; Indians not to be sold as\r\nslaves.[256:A]\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that a copy of the revised laws should be sent to Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley in England, that he might procure the king's\r\nconfirmation of them. Beverley mentions a tradition that the king, in\r\ncompliment to Virginia, wore, at his coronation, a robe made of Virginia\r\nsilk, and adds, that this was all the country received in return for\r\ntheir loyalty, the parliament having re-enacted the navigation act,\r\n(first enacted during the Commonwealth,) with still severer restrictions\r\nand prohibitions. Even the traditional compliment of the king's wearing\r\na robe of Virginia silk appears to be unfounded.\r\n\r\nWahanganoche, chief of Potomac, charged with treason and murder by\r\nCaptain Charles Brent, before the assembly, was acquitted; and Brent,\r\ntogether with Captain George Mason and others, were ordered to pay that\r\nchief a certain sum in roanoke, or in matchcoats, (from matchkore, a\r\ndeerskin,) in satisfaction of the injuries. Brent, Mason, and others\r\nwere afterwards punished by fines, suspension from office, and\r\ndisfranchisement, for offences committed against the Indians, and for\r\nshowing contempt to the governor's warrant in relation to the chief of\r\nPotomac. The counties of Westmoreland and Northumberland were especially\r\nexposed to Indian disturbances at this time. Colonel Moore Fantleroy was\r\ndisfranchised for maltreating the Rappahannock Indians; Mrs. Mary Ludlow\r\nwas restrained from encroaching on the lands of the Chesquiack Indians\r\nat Pyanketanke; Colonel Goodrich was charged with burning the English\r\nhouse of the chief of the Matapony Indians. George Harwood was ordered\r\nto ask forgiveness in open court on his knees, for speaking\r\ndisrespectfully of the right honorable governor, Francis Morrison; and,\r\nat the next court held in Warwick County, to ask forgiveness of Captain\r\nJohn Ashton for defaming him, and to pay two thousand pounds of tobacco.\r\n\r\nIt was during this year, 1662, that Charles the Second married\r\nCatherine, the Portuguese Infanta.\r\n\r\nThe court of Boston, in New England, having discharged a servant\r\nbelonging to William Drummond, an inhabitant of Virginia, the assembly\r\nordered reprisal to be made on the property belonging to inhabitants of\r\nthe Northern colony to the amount of forty pounds sterling.[257:A]\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley returned in the fall of 1662 from England, having\r\naccomplished nothing for the colony, but having secured for himself an\r\ninterest in a part of the Virginia territory, now North Carolina,\r\ngranted to himself and other courtiers and court favorites. He brought\r\nout with him instructions from the crown, comprising directions relative\r\nto church matters; that the Book of Common Prayer should be read, and\r\nthe sacrament administered according to the rites of the Church of\r\nEngland; that the churches should be well and orderly kept; that the\r\nnumber of them should be increased as the means might justify; that a\r\ncompetent maintenance should be assigned to each minister, and a house\r\nbuilt for him, and a glebe of one hundred acres attached. It was further\r\ndirected that no minister should be preferred by the governor to any\r\nbenefice, without a certificate from the Lord Bishop of London; and that\r\nministers should be admitted into their respective vestries; that the\r\noaths of obedience and supremacy should be administered to all persons\r\nbearing any part of the government, and to all persons whatsoever of age\r\nin the colony. The last of these instructions is in the following words:\r\n\"And because we are willing to give all possible encouragement to\r\npersons of different persuasions in matters of religion, to transport\r\nthemselves thither with their stocks, you are not to suffer any man to\r\nbe molested or disquieted in the exercise of his religion, so he be\r\ncontent with a quiet and peaceable enjoying it, not giving therein\r\noffence or scandal to the government; but we oblige you in your own\r\nhouse and family to the profession of the Protestant religion, according\r\nas it is now established in our kingdom of England, and the recommending\r\nit to all others under your government, as far as it may consist with\r\nthe peace and quiet of our said colony. You are to take care that\r\ndrunkenness and debauchery, swearing, and blasphemy, be discountenanced\r\nand punished; and that none be admitted to publick trust and employment\r\nwhose ill fame and conversation may bring scandal thereupon.\"[258:A]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of toleration expressed in these instructions was insincere\r\nand hypocritical, and dictated by the apprehensions of a government yet\r\nunstable, and by a temporizing policy. In December, 1662, the assembly\r\ndeclared that \"many schismatical persons, out of their averseness to the\r\northodox established religion, or out of the new-fangled conceits of\r\ntheir own heretical inventions, refuse to have their children baptized,\"\r\nand imposed on such offenders a fine of two thousand pounds of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe act for the suppression of the sect of Quakers was now extended to\r\nall separatists, and made still more rigorous. Persons attending their\r\nmeetings were fined, for the first offence, two hundred pounds of\r\ntobacco; for the second, five hundred; and for the third, banished. In\r\ncase the party convicted should be too poor to pay the fine, it was to\r\nbe levied from such of his sect as might be possessed of ampler means.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Durand, elder in a Puritan \"very orthodox church,\" in Nansemond\r\nCounty, had been banished from Virginia in 1648. In 1662, the Yeopim\r\nIndians granted to \"George Durant\" the neck of land in North Carolina\r\nwhich still bears his name. He was probably the exile. In April, 1663,\r\nGeorge Cathmaid claimed from Governor Berkley a large tract of land on\r\nthe borders of Albemarle Sound, in reward of having colonized a number\r\nof settlers in that province. In the same year Sir William Berkley was\r\ncommissioned to organize a government over this newly settled region,\r\nwhich, in honor of the perfidious General Monk, now made Duke of\r\nAlbemarle, received the name which time has transferred to the Sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[249:A] \"Leah and Rachel,\" published at London in 1656, in Force's\r\nHistorical Tracts, iii.\r\n\r\n[250:A] Virginia's Cure, (_Force's Hist.

The\r\ndispute turned on the true site of Watkins' Point, which was admitted to\r\nbe the southern limit of Maryland on that shore. The Virginia assembly,\r\nin 1663, declared the true site of Watkins' Point to be on the north\r\nside of Wicocomoco River, at its mouth, and ordered publication thereof\r\nto be made by Colonel Edmund Scarburgh, his majesty's surveyor-general,\r\ncommanding, in his majesty's name, all the inhabitants south of that\r\nPoint, \"to render obedience to his majesty's government of Virginia.\" A\r\nconference with Lord Baltimore's commissioners was proposed in case he\r\nshould be dissatisfied, and Colonel Scarburgh, Mr. John Catlett, and Mr.\r\nRichard Lawrence were appointed commissioners on the part of Virginia.\r\nLawrence will reappear in Bacon's Rebellion. The surveyor-general was\r\nfurther directed \"to improve his best abilities in all other his\r\nmajesty's concerns of land relating to Virginia, especially that to the\r\nnorthward of forty degrees of latitude, being the utmost bounds of the\r\nsaid Lord Baltimore's grant, and to give an account of his proceedings\r\ntherein to the right honorable governor and council of Virginia.\"[259:A]\r\n\r\nColonel Scarburgh's report of his proceedings on this occasion is\r\npreserved.[259:B] He set out with \"some of the commission, and about\r\nforty horsemen,\" an escort which he deemed necessary \"to repel the\r\ncontempt\" which, as he was informed, \"some Quakers and a fool in office\r\nhas threatened to obtrude.\" The party reached Anamessecks on Sunday\r\nnight, the eleventh of October. On the next day, at the house of an\r\nofficer of the Lord Baltimore, the surveyor-general began to publish the\r\nassembly's commands by repeatedly reading the act to the officer, who\r\nlabored under the disadvantage of being unable to read. He declared that\r\nhe would not be false to the trust put in him by the Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nMaryland. To this Colonel Scarburgh replied, \"that there could be no\r\ntrust where there was no intrust,\" (interest.) The officer declining to\r\nsubscribe his obedience, lest he might be hanged by the Governor of\r\nMaryland, was arrested and held to security (given by some of\r\nScarburgh's party) to appear before the governor and council of\r\nVirginia, and \"the broad arrow\" was set on his door. This matter being\r\nso satisfactorily adjusted, the colonel and his company proceeded to the\r\nhouse of a Quaker, where the act was published \"with a becoming\r\nreverence;\" but the Quakers scoffing and deriding it, and refusing their\r\nobedience, were arrested, to answer \"their contempt and rebellion,\" and\r\nit being found impracticable to obtain any security, \"the broad arrow\r\nwas set on the door.\" At Manokin the housekeepers and freemen, except\r\ntwo of Lord Baltimore's officers, subscribed. \"One Hollinsworth,\r\nmerchant, of a northern vessel,\" at this juncture, \"came and presented\r\nhis request for liberty of trade;\" which, Scarburgh suspecting to be\r\n\"some plan of the Quakers,\" to defeat their design, \"presumed, in their\r\ninfant plantation, to give freedom of trade without impositions.\"\r\nScarburgh gives a descriptive list of those who stood out against\r\nsubmitting to the jurisdiction of Virginia: one was \"the ignorant yet\r\ninsolent officer, a cooper by profession, who lived long in the lower\r\nparts of Accomac; once elected a burgess by the common crowd, and thrown\r\nout of the assembly for a factious and tumultuous person.\" George\r\nJohnson was \"the Proteus of heresy,\" notorious for \"shifting\r\nschismatical pranks.\" \"He stands arrested,\" and \"bids defiance.\"\r\n\"Thomas Price, a creeping Quaker, by trade a leather-dresser,\" and\r\n\"saith nothing else but that he would not obey government, for which he\r\nalso stands arrested.\" \"Ambrose Dixon, a caulker by profession,\" \"often\r\nin question for his Quaking profession,\" \"a prater of nonsense,\" \"stands\r\narrested, and the broad arrow at his door, but bids defiance.\" \"Henry\r\nBoston, an unmannerly fellow, that stands condemned on the records for\r\nfighting and contemning the laws of the country; a rebel to government,\r\nand disobedient to authority, for which he received a late reward with a\r\nrattan, and hath not subscribed; hides himself, so scapes arrest.\"\r\n\"These are all, except two or three loose fellows that follow the\r\nQuakers for scraps, whom a good whip is fittest to reform.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th day of November, 1663, the county court of Accomac\r\nauthorized Captain William Thorn and others to summon the good subjects\r\nof Manokin and other parts of the county, so far as Pocomoke River, to\r\ncome together and arm themselves for defence against any that might\r\ninvade them, in consequence \"of the rumors that the Quakers and factious\r\nfools have spread, to the disturbance of the peace and terror of the\r\nless knowing.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts, from the records of the county court of Accomac,\r\nexemplify the simplicity of the times, and the quaint orthography, and\r\nthe verbosity of the records of courts; while the final decision of the\r\ncase is not less equitable than those of Sancho Panza, sometime Governor\r\nof the Island of Barataria, or those celebrated in Knickerbocker's\r\nHistory of New York.\r\n\r\n     \"At a Court held in Accomack County, y{e} 16{th} of November,\r\n     by his ma{ties} Justices of y{e} Peace for y{e} s{d} County,\r\n     in y{e} Seaventeenth yeare of y{e} Reigne of o{r} Sovraigne\r\n     Lord Charles y{e} Second, By y{e} Grace of God, of Great\r\n     Britaine, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of y{e} Faith,\r\n     &c.: And in y{e} Yeare of o{r} Lord God 1665.\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, Cornelius Watkinson, Philip Howard, and William\r\n     Darby, were this Day accused by Mr. Jno.

The conspiracy was attributed to certain\r\nCromwellian soldiers, who had been sent out to Virginia as servants; but\r\nthe real grounds and true character of it can now hardly be ascertained.\r\nThe plot was discovered only the night before that appointed for its\r\nexecution, (the assembly being then in session,) by one of the\r\nconspirators named Birkenhead, a servant to Mr. Smith, of Purton, in\r\nGloucester County. Poplar Spring, near that place, was the appointed\r\nrendezvous. As soon as the information reached Sir William Berkley, who\r\nwas then at his residence, Green Spring, he issued secret orders to a\r\nparty of militia, to meet at Poplar Spring, and anticipate the outbreak.\r\nOnly a few were taken, of whom four were hanged. Birkenhead was\r\nrewarded[263:B] with his freedom and five thousand pounds of tobacco;\r\nBeverley[263:C] makes the reward two hundred pounds sterling. The\r\nthirteenth of September, the day fixed for the execution of the plot,\r\nwas set apart by the assembly as an anniversary thanksgiving. The news\r\nof this affair being transmitted to the king, he sent orders for the\r\nbuilding of a fort at Jamestown; but the Virginians thinking that the\r\ndanger had blown over, only erected a battery of some small pieces of\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nThe Indian chief of Potomac, and other northern werowances and mangais,\r\nwere required to give hostages of their children and others, who were to\r\nbe kindly treated and instructed in English, as far as practicable.\r\nMeasures were taken to bring Indian murderers to justice, especially the\r\nhostile Doeggs. The chief of Potomac was inhibited from holding any\r\nmatchacomico, or council, with any strange tribe, before the delivery of\r\nhostages.\r\n\r\nJohn Bland, a London merchant, and brother of Theodoric Bland, a leading\r\nman in Virginia, received the thanks of the assembly for goods advanced\r\nfor the use of the colony. In this year, 1663, a conference was held, by\r\nroyal command, at Mr. Aleston's, at Wicocomico, in Virginia, in May, by\r\ncommissioners appointed by Governor Berkley, and Charles Calvert,\r\nGovernor of Maryland, for the purpose of devising means of improving the\r\nstaple of tobacco. The Virginia commissioners were Thomas Ludwell,\r\nsecretary, Richard Lee, John Carter, Robert Smith, and Henry Corbin. The\r\nMaryland commissioners were Philip Calvert, Henry Sewall, secretary,\r\nEdward Koydes, and Henry Coursey. They recommended that in the year 1664\r\nno tobacco should be planted after the twentieth day of June.\r\n\r\nIn 1665 further acts were passed to prevent the depredations of Indians.\r\nIf a white should be murdered, the nearest Indian town was held\r\nresponsible; the Indian werowances to be in future appointed by the\r\ngovernor; colonists to go armed to church, court, and other public\r\nmeetings; Indians south of the James River, not to cross a line\r\nextending from the head of Blackwater River to the Appomattox Indian\r\ntown, (probably where Petersburg now stands,) and thence across to the\r\nMannakin town.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1665 Charles the Second, instigated by France, engaged in an\r\nunprovoked war with Holland, the object being mainly to strike a blow at\r\nthe Protestant interest.[264:A] During the same year the plague raged in\r\nLondon, the victims for some time perishing at the rate of ten thousand\r\nweekly. In this fatal year Secretary Bennet, a plausible man, of good\r\naddress, but mediocre capacity, was made Lord Arlington. The English\r\nmonopolizing laws now reduced the condition of the planters of Virginia\r\nso low, that they proposed to discontinue the planting of tobacco for\r\none year, so as to enhance the price of it; and an act was passed\r\npreparatory to a \"stint or cessation.\" To render this remedy effectual,\r\nit appeared necessary to obtain the co-operation of the colonies of\r\nMaryland and North Carolina. For some years it was found impracticable\r\nto effect this object, and in the mean time, in order to prevent\r\nVirginia from receiving any supplies, save those sent from England, and\r\nalso for defence against the Dutch, the king sent directions that forts\r\nshould be built on the rivers, and that ships should lie under them, and\r\nthat those places alone should be ports of trade. These instructions\r\nwere obeyed for a year; breast-works were erected at places appointed by\r\nthe assembly, and the shipping lay at them for a time; but the great\r\nfire and plague occurring in London at this juncture, rendered their\r\nsupplies very uncertain, and the fear of the plague being brought over\r\nwith the goods imported, prevented the people from living at those\r\nports, and thus all were again at liberty.[265:A]\r\n\r\nThe Virginia planters supposed that by lessening the quantity of\r\ntobacco, called a \"stint,\" they would improve the quality and enhance\r\nthe price of it. The merchants, to whom the planters were indebted, were\r\nfavorable to a stint; but although they would certainly be benefited by\r\nits operation, yet they were apparently not willing to abate any part of\r\ntheir claims against their debtors. The nett proceeds derived from the\r\nsale of the staple were barely enough to furnish the planters with\r\nclothing. As some remedy for this state of things, the legislature\r\nordered looms and work-houses to be set in operation at the charge of\r\neach county. Bounties were again offered for encouragement of the\r\nraising of silk, and measures were adopted to foster the culture of flax\r\nand hemp.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1666, while London was desolated by fire and depopulated by\r\nthe plague, war added her horrors. A government imbecile and corrupt, a\r\ncourt frivolous and debauched, darkened the shadows of the gloomy\r\npicture. The English colonies shared in the miseries of the mother\r\ncountry. It is remarkable that a book published in England many years\r\nbefore contained a prediction that the year 1666 would be the very\r\nclimax of public disaster.[266:A] It was not unreasonable to conclude,\r\nthat the wickedness of men had been directly avenged by a visitation of\r\nHeaven. Evelyn[266:B] says: \"These judgments we highly deserved for our\r\nprodigious ingratitude, burning lusts, dissolute court, profane and\r\nabominable lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly met in September, 1664, by prorogation from the preceding\r\nSeptember--a compendious mode of dispensing with the popular election.\r\nHowever, in act vi., the assembly, declaring that the principal end of\r\ntheir coming together was to provide for the people's safety, and to\r\nredress their grievances, ordered that in future due notice of the\r\nconvening of the burgesses should be given to the people by publication\r\nin the parish churches, so that they may then make known their\r\ngrievances. The act for a \"cessation\" passed in June, 1666, commanded\r\nthat no tobacco should be planted between the 1st of February, 1667, and\r\nthe 1st of February, 1668.[266:C] The governor of Carolina at this time,\r\nand the first governor of that province, was William Drummond, a native\r\nof Scotland.\r\n\r\nSimilar acts were passed by Maryland and Carolina, but the latter\r\nprovince, owing to trouble with the Indians, not having given formal\r\nnotice by the day agreed upon, Maryland availed herself of the\r\ninformality to decline enforcing the cessation. Thus, as has been before\r\nmentioned, action was long delayed. Virginia, nevertheless, adhering to\r\nthe scheme, again, at the session of October of the same year, confirmed\r\nher former act, and by dint of negotiation it was finally consummated.\r\n\r\nThe County of Stafford is mentioned in this year for the first time,\r\nand it was now represented by a burgess, Colonel Henry Mees.\r\n\r\nThe petition of William Drum, probably a misprint for Drummond,\r\nconcerning a grant of land in what was commonly called \"the governor's\r\nland,\" in the main reserve, was rejected, the house being of opinion\r\nthat such grants appertained only to the governor and council. The\r\nassembly asserted their right to assess the levy without the\r\ninterposition of the governor and council; and Sir William Berkley\r\nassented to this decision; the sincerity of the terms in which he\r\nexpressed his willing acquiescence may well be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch about this time appear to have surprised several vessels,\r\nladen with tobacco, in the James River; and it was determined to erect\r\nseveral forts: one on James River, one on Nansemond River, one on York\r\nRiver at Tindall's Point, (now Gloucester Point,) one on the\r\nRappahannock at Corotoman, and one on the Potomac at Yeohocomico.\r\n\r\nIt was declared that baptism did not exempt slaves from bondage. As the\r\nreducing of negroes to slavery was justified on the ground that they\r\nwere heathens, so the opinion prevailed among some that when they ceased\r\nto be heathens they were, by the very fact, released from slavery.\r\n\r\nIn 1668, peace being restored, vessels were relieved from the necessity\r\nof anchoring under the forts. The war with the Dutch, unjustly commenced\r\nby the English, ended very disgracefully to them. A day of humiliation\r\nwas appointed, and all persons were required to attend the parish\r\nchurches, \"with fasting and prayers, to implore God's mercy, and\r\ndeprecate the evils justly impending over us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that work-houses should be built in each county, for the\r\ninstruction of poor children in spinning, weaving, and other useful\r\noccupations and trades. An act was passed for the \"suppressing and\r\nrestraint of the exhorbitant number of ordinaries and tippling houses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians were required to bring in one hundred and forty-five wolves'\r\nheads annually, the reward for each head being one hundred pounds of\r\ntobacco and cask. To prevent fraud, the ears were cut off from the heads\r\nof the wolves.[268:A]\r\n\r\nThe elective franchise was restricted, in 1670, to freeholders and\r\nhousekeepers.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley sent out a company of fourteen English and as many\r\nIndians, under Captain Henry Batt, to explore the country to the west.\r\nSetting out from the Appomattox River, in seven days they reached the\r\nfoot of the mountains. The first ridge was not found very high or steep,\r\nbut after crossing that they encountered others that seemed to touch the\r\nclouds, and so steep that in a day's march they could not advance more\r\nthan three miles. They came upon extensive valleys of luxuriant verdure,\r\nabounding with turkeys, deer, elk, and buffalo, gentle and, as yet,\r\nundisturbed by the fear of man. Grapes were seen of the size of plums.\r\nAfter crossing the mountains they discovered a charming level country,\r\nand a rivulet that flowed westward. Following this for some days, they\r\nreached old fields and cabins recently occupied by the natives; in these\r\nBatt left toys. Not far from the cabins, at some marshes, the Indian\r\nguides halted and refused to go any farther, saying that not far off\r\ndwelt a powerful tribe, that never suffered strangers, who discovered\r\ntheir towns, to escape. Batt was therefore reluctantly compelled to\r\nreturn. Upon receiving his report, Sir William Berkley resolved to make\r\nan exploration himself, but his intention was frustrated by the troubles\r\nthat shortly after fell upon the country.[269:A] Beverley alone gives an\r\naccount of Batt's explorations, leaving the date of it uncertain between\r\n1666 and 1676. Burk dates it in 1667.\r\n\r\nThe Algonquin tribes are said to have been included within lines\r\nextending from Cape Hatteras to the head of the Mississippi, and thence\r\neastward to the coast north of Newfoundland, and thence along the\r\nAtlantic shore to the cape first mentioned.[269:B] The bulk of the\r\nIndians within this triangle spoke various dialects of the same generic\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe thirty tribes of Indians comprised within the Powhatan confederacy,\r\nsouth of the Potomac, at the time of the landing at Jamestown, are\r\nconjecturally estimated at about eight thousand souls, being one to the\r\nsquare mile.[269:C] The population of the mountain country was probably\r\nsparser than that of the country east of the mountains. The number of\r\nsquare miles in Virginia at the present day is upwards of sixty-five\r\nthousand. The number of warriors belonging to the tribes tributary to\r\nVirginia in 1669, as has been before mentioned, was seven hundred and\r\ntwenty-five, and their proportion to the entire population being\r\nreckoned as three to ten, their aggregate number was about twenty-four\r\nhundred. Thus in about sixty years the diminution of their numbers\r\namounted to about five thousand six hundred; of these, part had perished\r\nfrom disease, exposure, famine, and war; the rest were driven back into\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1670 complaints were made to the general court by members of\r\nthe council and others, being gentlemen, of the counties of York,\r\nGloucester, and Middlesex, representing their apprehensions of danger\r\nfrom the great number of felons, and other desperate villains, sent\r\nhither from the prisons of England. Masters of vessels were prohibited\r\nfrom landing any such convicts or jail-birds. In 1671 Captain Bristow\r\nand Captain Walker were required to give security in the sum of one\r\nmillion pounds of tobacco and cask, that Mr. Nevett should send out the\r\nNewgate-birds within two months. Mr. Jefferson[270:A] has made the\r\nfollowing remark: \"The malefactors sent to America were not sufficient\r\nin number to merit enumeration as one class out of three which peopled\r\nAmerica. It was at a late period of their history that the practice\r\nbegan. I have no book by me which enables me to point out the date of\r\nits commencement; but I do not think the whole number sent would amount\r\nto two thousand.\" And he supposed that they and their descendants did\r\nnot, in 1786, exceed four thousand, \"which is little more than\r\none-thousandth part of the whole inhabitants.\" Mr. Jefferson appears to\r\nhave been mistaken in his opinion, that malefactors were not sent over\r\nuntil a late period in the annals of Virginia; and he probably\r\nunderrated the number of their descendants.\r\n\r\nThe acts prohibiting the exportation of wool, hides, and iron, were\r\nrepealed, and every one was \"permitted to make the best he can of his\r\nown commodity.\" The preamble to the act for the naturalization of\r\nforeigners declares, that \"nothing can tend more to the advancement of a\r\nnew plantation, either to its defence or prosperity, nor nothing more\r\nadd to the glory of a prince, than being a gracious master of many\r\nsubjects; nor any better way to produce those effects than the inviting\r\nof people of other nations to reside among us by communication of\r\nprivileges.\"[270:B]\r\n\r\nIn 1672 the assembly provided for the defence of the country by\r\nrebuilding and repairing of forts. Repeated and vigorous laws were\r\nenacted providing for the apprehension of runaways; rewards were offered\r\nthe Indians for apprehending them. A negro slave was valued at four\r\nthousand five hundred pounds of tobacco; an Indian slave at three\r\nthousand pounds of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[263:A] Hening, ii. 188.\r\n\r\n[263:B] Ibid., ii. 204.\r\n\r\n[263:C] Beverley, B. i. 61.\r\n\r\n[264:A] Evelyn's Diary, i. 391.\r\n\r\n[265:A] Beverley, B. i. 63.\r\n\r\n[266:A] Pepys' Diary, ii.\r\n\r\n[266:B] Diary, ii. 17.\r\n\r\n[266:C] The commissioners appointed to treat with Maryland and Carolina\r\non this subject were, of the council, Thomas Ludwell, Esq., secretary of\r\nVirginia, Major-General Robert Smith, and Major-General Richard Bennet;\r\nand of the burgesses, Robert Wynne, speaker, Colonel Nich.

Alington, T. Clifford, S. Trevor, Orlando\r\nBridgeman, C. S. Sandwich, president, Thomas Grey, ---- Titus, A.\r\nBroucher, H. Slingsby, secretary, Hum. Winch, and Edmund Waller. These,\r\nduring this year, propounded inquiries to Sir William Berkley, governor,\r\nrespecting the state and condition of Virginia; and his answers made in\r\nthe year following present a satisfactory statistical account of the\r\ncolony. The executive consisted of a governor and sixteen councillors,\r\ncommissioned by the king, to determine all causes above fifteen pounds;\r\ncauses of less amount were tried by county courts, of which there were\r\ntwenty. The assembly met every year, composed of two burgesses from each\r\ncounty. Appeals lay to the assembly; and this body levied the taxes.\r\n(This power was delegated for some years to the executive.) The\r\nlegislative and executive powers rested in the governor, council,\r\nassembly, and subordinate officers. The secretary of the colony sent the\r\nacts of the assembly to the lord chancellor, or one of the principal\r\nsecretaries of state. All freemen were bound to muster monthly in their\r\nown counties; the force of the colony amounted to upwards of eight\r\nthousand horsemen. There were five forts: two on the James, and one on\r\neach of the three rivers, Rappahannock, York, and Potomac; the number of\r\ncannon was thirty. His majesty, during the late Dutch war, had sent over\r\nthirty more, but the most of them were lost at sea. The Indians were in\r\nperfect subjection. The eastern boundary of Virginia, on the sea-coast,\r\nhad been reduced from ten degrees to half of one degree. Tobacco was\r\nthe only commodity of any great value; exotic mulberry-trees had been\r\nplanted, and attempts made to manufacture silk. There was plenty of\r\ntimber; of iron ore but little discovered. The whole population was\r\nforty thousand; of which two thousand were negro slaves, and six\r\nthousand white servants. (The negroes had increased one hundredfold in\r\nfifty years, since 1619, when the first were imported.) The average\r\nannual importation of servants was about fifteen hundred; most of them\r\nEnglish, a few Scotch, fewer Irish; and not more than two or three ships\r\nwith negroes in seven years. New plantations were found sickly, and in\r\nsuch four-fifths of the new settlers died. Eighty vessels arrived yearly\r\nfrom England and Ireland for tobacco; a few small coasters came from New\r\nEngland. Virginia had not more than two vessels of her own, and those\r\nnot over twenty tons. Sir William Berkley complains bitterly of the act\r\nof parliament restricting the commerce of Virginia to the British\r\nkingdom--a policy injurious to both parties; and he adds that \"this is\r\nthe cause why no small or great vessels are built here; for we are most\r\nobedient to all laws, while the New England men break through and trade\r\nto any place that their interest leads them to.\" Sir William gave it as\r\nhis opinion, that nothing could improve the trade of Virginia, unless\r\nshe was allowed to export her staves, timber, and corn to other places\r\nbesides the king's dominions. The only duty levied was that of two\r\nshillings on every hogshead of tobacco exported; the exportation of the\r\nyear 1671 amounting to fifteen thousand hogsheads. Out of this revenue\r\nthe king allowed the governor one thousand pounds, to which the assembly\r\nadded two hundred more, making twelve hundred pounds, which was\r\nfour-fifths of the entire customs revenue for that year. Yet he\r\ncomplains: \"I can knowingly affirm, that there is no government of ten\r\nyears' settlement but has thrice as much allowed him. But I am supported\r\nby my hopes, that his gracious majesty will one day consider me.\"\r\n\r\nThe king had no revenue in the colony except quit-rents; these were not\r\nof much value, and the king gave them to Colonel Henry Norwood. Every\r\nman instructed his children at home according to his ability. \"There\r\nwere forty-eight parishes, and our ministers are well paid; by my\r\nconsent should be better, if they would pray oftener, and preach less.\r\nBut as of all other commodities, so of this, the worst are sent us; and\r\nwe have had few that we could boast of, since Cromwell's tyranny drove\r\ndivers men hither. But I thank God there are no free schools, nor\r\nprinting, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years; for learning\r\nhas brought disobedience into the world, and printing has divulged them\r\nand libels against the best governments. God keep us from both!\"[273:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[273:A] Hening, ii. 511.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n1673-1675.\r\n\r\n     Acts of Assembly--The Northern Neck--Earl of Arlington--\r\n     Threatened Revolt in 1674--Agents sent to England to solicit\r\n     a Revocation of the Grants of Territory and to obtain a\r\n     Charter--The effort fruitless.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE acts of a session were headed as follows: \"At a Grand Assembly\r\nholden at James City, by prorogation from the 24th day of September,\r\n1672, to the 20th of October, Annoque Regni Regis Caroli Secundi Dei\r\nGratia Angliæ, Scotiæ, Franciæ et Hiberniæ, Regis, fidei Defensoris,\r\n&c., Anno Domini 1673. To the glory of Almighty God and public weal, of\r\nthis his majesty's colony of Virginia, were enacted as followeth.\"\r\n\r\nProvision was made during this year for a supply of arms and ammunition.\r\nThe commissioners appointed for determining the boundaries of the\r\nCounties of Northumberland and Lancaster were Colonel John Washington,\r\nCaptain John Lee, Captain William Traverse, William Mosely, and Robert\r\nBeverley.\r\n\r\nThe restoration, that worst of all governments, re-established an\r\narbitrary and oppressive administration in Virginia in church and state;\r\nand as soon as reinstated, tyranny, confident of its power, rioted in\r\nwanton and unbridled license.\r\n\r\nThe grant which had been made by Charles the Second in the first year of\r\nhis reign, dated at St. Germain en Laye, of the Northern Neck, including\r\nfour counties and a half, to Lord Hopton, the Earl of St. Albans, Lord\r\nCulpepper, etc., was surrendered, in May, 1671, to the crown, and new\r\nletters-patent were issued, with some alterations, to the Earl of St.\r\nAlbans, Lord Berkley, Sir William Morton, and others,--to hold the same\r\nforever, paying annually the quit-rent of six pounds thirteen shillings\r\nand four pence to his majesty and his successors. In February, 1673, the\r\nking granted to the Earl of Arlington and Thomas, Lord Culpepper, the\r\nentire territory of Virginia, not merely the wild lands, but private\r\nplantations long settled and improved, for the term of thirty-one\r\nyears, at the yearly rent of forty shillings. The patents entitled them\r\nto all rents and escheats, with power to convey all vacant lands,\r\nnominate sheriffs, escheators, surveyors, etc., present to all churches\r\nand endow them with lands, to form counties, parishes, etc. Although the\r\ngrants to these noblemen were limited to a term of years, yet they were\r\npreposterously and illegally authorized to make conveyances in fee\r\nsimple.[275:A]\r\n\r\nHenry Bennet, Earl of Arlington, said to have been the best bred person\r\nat court, like his master, as far as he had any pretension whatever to\r\nreligion, was a disguised Papist. He became allied to the monarch as\r\nfather-in-law to the first Duke of Grafton, the king's son by Lady\r\nCastlemaine. Arlington had received, while fighting on the royal side in\r\nthe civil war, a wound on the nose, the scar of which was covered with a\r\nblack patch. Barbara Villiers, only daughter of William, Viscount\r\nGrandison, and wife of Roger Palmer, created Earl of Castlemaine in\r\n1661, distinguished for her beauty and her profligacy, becoming mistress\r\nto Charles at his restoration, was made, in 1670, Duchess of Cleveland.\r\nHenry Bennet was created Baron of Arlington in 1663, and Viscount\r\nHetford and Earl of Arlington in 1672. He was also Knight of the Garter\r\nand chamberlain to the king, his chief favorite, companion in profligate\r\npleasure, and political adviser. He and Culpepper were members of the\r\ncommission of trade and plantations.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians grew so impatient under their accumulated grievances that\r\na revolt was near bursting forth in 1674, but no person of note taking\r\nthe lead, it was suppressed by the advice of \"some discreet persons,\"\r\nand the insurgents were persuaded to disperse in compliance with the\r\ngovernor's proclamation. The movement was not entirely ineffectual, for\r\njustices of the peace were prohibited from levying any more taxes for\r\ntheir own emolument.[275:B] The assembly determined to make an humble\r\naddress \"to his sacred majesty,\" praying for a revocation of the\r\nfore-mentioned grants of her territory, and for a confirmation of the\r\nrights and privileges of the colony. Francis Morrison, Thomas Ludwell,\r\nand Robert Smith were appointed agents to visit England and lay their\r\ncomplaints before the king; and their expenses were provided for by\r\nonerous taxes, which fell heaviest on the poorer class of people. These\r\nexpenses included douceurs to be given to courtiers; for without money\r\nnothing could be effected at the venal court of Charles the\r\nSecond.[276:A] Besides the revocation of the patents, the Virginia\r\nagents were instructed to endeavor to obtain a new charter for the\r\ncolony. They prayed \"that Virginia shall no more be transferred in\r\nparcels to individuals, but may remain forever dependent on the crown of\r\nEngland; that the public officers should be obliged to reside within the\r\ncolony; that no tax shall be laid on the inhabitants except by the\r\nassembly.\" This petition affords a curious commentary on the panegyrics\r\nthen but recently lavished by \"his majesty's most loyal colony\" upon his\r\n\"most sacred majesty,\" who repaid their fervid loyalty by an unrelenting\r\nsystem of oppression. The negotiations were long, and display evidence\r\nof signal diplomatic ability, together with elevated and patriotic views\r\nof colonial rights and constitutional freedom. After many evasions and\r\nmuch delay, the mission eventually proved fruitless.[276:B] Application\r\nwas also made to Secretary Coventry to secure the place of governor to\r\nSir William Berkley for life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[275:A] Hening, ii. 519.\r\n\r\n[275:B] Ibid., ii. 315.\r\n\r\n[276:A] Account of Bacon's Rebellion in Va.

It was written by the Rev. Morgan Godwyn, who had\r\nserved some time in Virginia; and he had given a copy of it to each of\r\nthe bishops. The agents make mention of him as \"the fellow,\" and \"the\r\ninconsiderable wretch.\" They sent a copy of it to Virginia, thinking it\r\nnecessary that a reply should be prepared, and addressed to the Bishop\r\nof Winchester and the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is probable that this\r\npamphlet is no longer extant; but the character of its contents may be\r\ninferred from a letter addressed by the author to Sir William Berkley,\r\nand appended to a pamphlet published by him in 1680, entitled the\r\n\"Negro's and Indian's Advocate.\" Indeed this letter may have been itself\r\nthe libellous pamphlet circulated in England in 1674, and referred to by\r\nthe Virginia agents. In this letter Godwyn gives the following account\r\nof the state of religion, as it was in that province some time before\r\nthe late rebellion, _i.e._ Bacon's, which occurred in 1676. Godwyn\r\nacknowledges that Berkley had, \"as a tender father, nourished and\r\npreserved Virginia in her infancy and nonage. But as our blessed Lord,\"\r\nhe reminds him, \"once said to the young man in the gospel, 'Yet lackest\r\nthou one thing;' so,\" he adds, \"may we, and I fear too truly, say of\r\nVirginia, that there is one thing, the propagation and establishing of\r\nreligion in her, wanting.\" And this he essays to prove in various ways:\r\nsaying that \"the ministers are most miserably handled by their plebeian\r\njuntos, the vestries, to whom the hiring (that is the usual word there)\r\nand admission of ministers is solely left. And there being no law\r\nobliging them to any more than to procure a lay reader, (to be obtained\r\nat a very moderate rate,) they either resolve to have none at all, or\r\nreduce them to their own terms; that is, to use them how they please,\r\npay them what they list, and to discard them whensoever they have a mind\r\nto it. And this is the recompense of their leaving their hopes in\r\nEngland, (far more considerable to the meanest curate than what can\r\npossibly be apprehended there,) together with the friends and relations\r\nand their native soil, to venture their lives into those parts among\r\nstrangers and enemies to their profession, who look upon them as a\r\nburden; as being with their families (where they have any) to be\r\nsupported out of their labor. So that I dare boldly aver that our\r\ndiscouragements there are much greater than ever they were here in\r\nEngland under the usurper.\" After citing various evidences in support of\r\nthese statements, among which he specifies the hiring of the clergy from\r\nyear to year, and compelling them to accept of parishes at under-rates,\r\nGodwyn thus proceeds: \"I would not be thought to reflect herein upon\r\nyour excellency, who have always professed great tenderness for\r\nchurchmen. For, alas! these things are kept from your ears; nor dare\r\nthey, had they opportunity, acquaint you with them, for fear of being\r\nused worse. And there being no superior clergyman, neither in council\r\nnor any place of authority, for them to address their complaints to, and\r\nby his means have their grievances brought to your excellency's\r\nknowledge, they are left without remedy. Again, two-thirds of the\r\npreachers are made up of leaden lay priests of the vestry's ordination;\r\nand are both the shame and grief of the rightly ordained clergy there.\r\nNothing of this ever reaches your excellency's ear; these hungry patrons\r\nknowing better how to benefit by their vices than by the virtues of the\r\nother.\" And here Godwyn cites an instance of a writing-master, who came\r\ninto Virginia, professing to be a doctor in divinity, showing feigned\r\nletters of orders, and under different names continuing in various\r\nplaces to carry on his work of fraud. He states also that owing to a law\r\nof the colony, which enacted that four years' servitude should be the\r\npenalty exacted of any one who permitted himself to be sent thither free\r\nof charge, some of the clergy, through ignorance of the law, were left\r\nthereby under the mastery of persons who had given them the means of\r\ngratuitous transport; and that they could only escape from such bondage\r\nby paying a ransom four or five times as large as that to which the\r\nexpenses of their passage would have amounted. Moreover, he describes\r\nthe parishes as extending, some of them, sixty or seventy miles in\r\nlength, and lying void for many years together, to save charges.\r\nJamestown, he distinctly states, had been left, with short intervals, in\r\nthis destitute condition for twenty years. \"Laymen,\" he adds, \"were\r\nallowed to usurp the office of ministers, and deacons to undermine and\r\nthrust out presbyters; in a word, all things concerning the church and\r\nreligion were left to the mercy of the people.\" And, last of all: \"To\r\npropagate Christianity among the heathen--whether natives or slaves\r\nbrought from other parts--although (as must piously be supposed) it were\r\nthe only end of God's discovering those countries to us, yet is that\r\nlooked upon by our new race of Christians, so idle and ridiculous, so\r\nutterly needless and unnecessary, that no man can forfeit his judgment\r\nmore than by any proposal looking or tending that way.\" Such is the Rev.\r\nMr. Godwyn's account of the state of religion and the condition of the\r\nclergy in Virginia during Sir William Berkley's administration.[279:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[279:A] Anderson's Hist. of Col. Church, first edition, ii. 558, 561.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n1675.\r\n\r\n     Lands at Greenspring settled on Sir William Berkley--Indian\r\n     Incursions--Force put under command of Sir Henry Chicheley--\r\n     Disbanded by Governor's Order--The Long Parliament of Virginia\r\n     --Colonial Grievances--Spirit of the Virginians--Elements of\r\n     Disaffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE lands at Greenspring, near Jamestown, were settled during this year\r\non Sir William Berkley, the preamble to the act reciting among his\r\nmerits, \"the great pains he hath taken and hazards he has run, even of\r\nhis life, in the government and preservation of the country from many\r\nattempts of the Indians, and also in preserving us in our due allegiance\r\nto his majesty's royal father of blessed memory, and his now most sacred\r\nmajesty, against all attempts, long after all his majesty's other\r\ndominions were subjected to the tyranny of the late usurpers; and also\r\nseriously considering that the said Sir William Berkley hath in all time\r\nof his government, under his most sacred majesty and his royal father,\r\nmade it his only care to keep his majesty's country in a due obedience\r\nto our rightful and lawful sovereign,\" etc. The Rev. John Clayton,\r\n(supposed to be father of the Virginia naturalist,) writing in 1688,\r\nsays: \"There is a spring at my Lady Berkley's called Green Spring,\r\nwhereof I have been often told, so very cold, that 'tis dangerous\r\ndrinking thereof in summer time, it having proved of fatal consequence\r\nto several. I never tried anything of what nature it is of.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians having renewed their incursions upon the frontier, the\r\npeople petitioned the governor for protection. Upon the meeting of the\r\nassembly, war was declared against them in March, 1676; five hundred\r\nmen enlisted, and the forts garrisoned. The force raised was put\r\nunder command of Sir Henry Chicheley, who was ordered to disarm the\r\nneighboring Indians. The forts were on the Potomac, at the falls of the\r\nRappahannock, (now Fredericksburg,) on the Matapony, on the Pamunkey, at\r\nthe falls of the Appomattox, (now Petersburg,) either at Major-General\r\nWood's, or at Fleets', on the opposite side of the river, on the\r\nBlackwater, and at the head of the Nansemond. Provision was made for\r\nemploying Indians; articles of martial law were adopted; arms to be\r\ncarried to church; the governor authorized to disband the troops when\r\nexpedient; days of fasting appointed. The Indians having been emboldened\r\nto commit depredations and murders by the arms and ammunition which they\r\nhad received, contrary to law, from traders, a rigorous act was passed\r\nto restrain such. When Sir Henry Chicheley was about to march against\r\nthe Indians he was ordered by Sir William Berkley to disband his forces,\r\nto the general surprise and dissatisfaction of the colony.\r\n\r\nThere had now been no election of burgesses since the restoration, in\r\n1660, the same legislature since that time having continued, to hold its\r\nsessions by prorogation. It may be called the Long Parliament of\r\nVirginia in respect to its duration. Among its members may be mentioned\r\nColonel William Clayborne, Captain William Berkley, Captain Daniel\r\nParke, Adjutant-General Jennings, Colonel John Washington, Colonel\r\nEdward Scarburgh. Robert Wynne was made speaker shortly after the\r\nrestoration, and so continued until 1676, when he was succeeded by\r\nAugustine Warner, of Gloucester. James Minge, of Charles City, was now\r\nthe clerk, and had been for several years.\r\n\r\nThe price of tobacco was depressed by the monopoly of the English\r\nnavigation act, and the cost of imported goods, enhanced. Duties were\r\nlaid on the commerce between one colony and another, and the revenue\r\nthence derived was absorbed by the collecting officers. The planters, it\r\nis said,[281:A] had been driven to seek a remedy by destroying the crop\r\nin the fields, called \"plant cutting.\" The endeavors of the agents in\r\nEngland to obtain a release from the grants to the lords and a new\r\ncharter, appeared abortive. The Indian incursions occurring at this\r\nconjuncture, filled the measure of panic and exasperation. Groaning\r\nunder exactions and grievances, and tortured by apprehensions, the\r\nVirginians began to meditate violent measures of relief. Many of the\r\nfeudal institutions of England, the hoary buttresses of mediæval power,\r\ncould have no existence in America; a new position gradually moulded a\r\nnew system; and men transplanted to another hemisphere changed opinions\r\nas well as clime. Thus, in Virginia, the most Anglican, oldest, and most\r\nloyal of the colonies, a spirit of freedom and independence infused\r\nitself into the minds of the planters. The ocean that separated them\r\nfrom England lessened the terror of a distant sceptre. The supremacy of\r\nlaw being less firmly established, especially in the frontier, a wild\r\nspirit of justice had arisen which was apt to decline into contempt of\r\nauthority. Added to this, the colony contained malecontent Cromwellian\r\nsoldiers reduced to bondage, perhaps some of them men of heroic soul,\r\nvictims of civil war, ripe for revolt. The Indian massacres of former\r\nyears made the colonists sensitive to alarms, and impatient of\r\nindifference to their cruel apprehensions, which can hardly be realized\r\nby those who have never been subjected to such dangers. The fatigues,\r\nprivations, hardships, perils of a pioneer life, imparted energy; the\r\nwild magnificence of nature, the fresh luxuriance of a virgin soil,\r\nunpruned forests, great rivers and hoary mountains, these contributed to\r\nkindle a love of liberty and independence. Moreover, the disaffection of\r\nthe colonists was somewhat emboldened by the civil dissensions of\r\nEngland, which appeared now again to threaten the stability of the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[281:A] Account of Bacon's Rebellion, in Va.

The one was a large comet, every evening for a week or\r\nmore at southwest, thirty-five degrees high, streaming like a horse-tail\r\nwestward, until it reached (almost) the horizon, and setting toward the\r\nnorthwest. Another was flights of wild pigeons, in breadth nigh a\r\nquarter of the mid-hemisphere, and of their length was no visible end;\r\nwhose weights broke down the limbs of large trees whereon these rested\r\nat nights, of which the fowlers shot abundance, and ate them; this sight\r\nput the old planters under the more portentous apprehensions because the\r\nlike was seen (as they said) in the year 1644, when the Indians\r\ncommitted the last massacre; but not after, until that present year,\r\n1675. The third strange phenomenon was swarms of flies about an inch\r\nlong, and big as the top of a man's little finger, rising out of spigot\r\nholes in the earth, which ate the new-sprouted leaves from the tops of\r\nthe trees, without other harm, and in a month left us.\"[283:A]\r\n\r\nThe author of this account, whose initials are T. M., says of himself,\r\nthat he lived in Northumberland County, on the lower part of the\r\nPotomac, where he was a merchant; but he had a plantation, servants,\r\ncattle, etc., in Stafford County, on the upper part of that river; and\r\nthat he was elected a burgess from Stafford in 1676, Colonel Mason being\r\nhis colleague. T. M., perhaps, was Thomas Matthews, son of Colonel\r\nSamuel Matthews, some time governor. He owned lands acquired from the\r\nWicocomoco Indians in Northumberland, and it is probable that his son,\r\nThomas Matthews, came into possession of them.[284:A] He appears to have\r\nlived at a place called Cherry Point, probably on the Potomac, in\r\n1681.[284:B]\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday morning, in the summer of 1675, a herdsman, named Robert\r\nHen, together with an Indian, was slain in Stafford County, by a party\r\nof the hostile tribe of Doegs, and the victims were found by the people\r\non their way to church.[284:C] Colonel Mason and Captain Brent, with\r\nsome militia, pursued the offenders about twenty miles up the river, and\r\nthen across into Maryland, and, coming upon two parties of armed\r\nwarriors, slaughtered indiscriminately a number of them and of the\r\nSusquehannocks, a friendly tribe. These latter, recently expelled from\r\ntheir own country, at the head of the Chesapeake Bay, by the Senecas, a\r\ntribe of the Five Nations, now sought refuge in a fort of the\r\nPiscataways, a friendly tribe near the head of the Potomac, supposed to\r\nbe near the spot where now stands the City of Washington. In a short\r\ntime several Marylanders were murdered by the savages, and some\r\nVirginians in the County of Stafford. The fort on the north bank of the\r\nPiscataway consisted of high earth-works having flankers pierced with\r\nloop-holes, and surrounded by a ditch. This again was encircled by a row\r\nof tall trees from five to eight inches in diameter, set three feet in\r\nthe earth and six inches apart, and wattled in such a manner as to\r\nprotect those within, and, at the same time, to afford them apertures\r\nfor shooting through. It was probably an old fort erected by Maryland as\r\na protection to the frontier, but latterly unoccupied. The\r\nSusquehannocks, to the number of one hundred warriors, with their old\r\nmen, women, and children, entrenched themselves in this stronghold.\r\nToward the end of September they were besieged by a thousand men from\r\nVirginia and Maryland, united in a joint expedition, at the instance of\r\nthe latter. The Marylanders were commanded by Major Thomas Truman, the\r\nVirginians by Colonel John Washington.[285:A] John Washington had\r\nemigrated from Yorkshire, England, to Virginia in 1657, and purchased\r\nlands in Westmoreland. Not long after, being, as has been conjectured, a\r\nsurveyor, he made a location of lands, which, however, was set aside\r\nuntil the Indians, to whom these lands had been assigned, should vacate\r\nthem. In the year 1667 he was a member of the house of burgesses.[285:B]\r\n\r\nTo return to the siege: six of the Indian chiefs were sent out from the\r\nfort on a parley proposed by Major Truman. These chiefs, on being\r\ninterrogated, laid the blame of the recent outrages perpetrated in\r\nVirginia and Maryland upon the Senecas. Colonel Washington, Colonel\r\nMason, and Major Adderton now came over from the Virginia encampment,\r\nand charged the chiefs with the murders that had been committed on the\r\nsouth side of the Potomac. On the next day the Virginia officers renewed\r\nthe charges against the Susquehannock chiefs; at this juncture a\r\ndetachment of rangers arrived, bringing with them the mangled bodies of\r\nsome recent victims of Indian cruelty. Five of the chiefs were instantly\r\nbound, and put to death--\"knocked on the head.\" The savages now made a\r\ndesperate resistance; but their sorties were repelled, and they had to\r\nsubsist partly on horses captured from the whites. At the end of six\r\nweeks, seventy-five warriors, with their women and children, (leaving\r\nonly a few decrepid old men behind,) evacuated the fort during the\r\nnight, marching off by the light of the moon, killing ten of the militia\r\nfound asleep, as they retired, and making the welkin ring with the\r\nwar-whoop and yells of defiance. They pursued their way by the\r\nhead-waters of the Potomac, the Rappahannock, the York, and the James,\r\njoining with them the neighboring Indians, slaying such of the\r\ninhabitants as they met with on the frontier, to the number of\r\nsixty--sacrificing ten ordinary victims for each one of the chiefs they\r\nhad lost. The Susquehannocks now sent a message to Governor Berkley,\r\ncomplaining of the war waged upon them, and of the murder of their\r\nchiefs, and proposing, if the Virginians, their old friends, would make\r\nthem reparation for the damages which they had suffered, and dissolve\r\ntheir alliance with the Marylanders, they would renew their ancient\r\nfriendship; otherwise they were ready for war.[286:A]\r\n\r\nAt the falls of the James the savages had slain a servant of Nathaniel\r\nBacon, Jr., and his overseer, to whom he was much attached. This was not\r\nthe place of Bacon's residence; Bacon Quarter Branch, in the suburbs of\r\nRichmond, probably indicates the scene of the murder. Bacon himself\r\nresided at Curles, in Henrico county, on the lower James River.[286:B]\r\nIt is said that when he heard of the catastrophe he vowed vengeance. In\r\nthat time of panic, the more exposed and defenceless families,\r\nabandoning their homes, took shelter together in houses, where they\r\nfortified themselves with palisades and redoubts. Neighbors banding\r\ntogether, passed in co-operating parties, from plantation to plantation,\r\ntaking arms with them into the fields where they labored, and posting\r\nsentinels, to give warning of the approach of the insidious foe. No man\r\nventured out of doors unarmed. Even Jamestown was in danger. The red\r\nmen, stealing with furtive glance through the shade of the forest, the\r\nnoiseless tread of the moccasin scarce stirring a leaf, prowled around\r\nlike panthers in quest of prey. At length the people at the head of\r\nthe James and the York, having in vain petitioned the governor for\r\nprotection, alarmed at the slaughter of their neighbors, often murdered\r\nwith every circumstance of barbarity, rose tumultuously in self-defence,\r\nto the number of three hundred men, including most, if not all the\r\nofficers, civil and military, and chose Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., for their\r\nleader. According to another authority, Bacon, before the murder of his\r\noverseer and servant, had been refused the commission, and had sworn\r\nthat upon the next murder he should hear of, he would march against the\r\nIndians, \"commission or no commission.\" And when one of his own family\r\nwas butchered, \"he got together about seventy or ninety persons, most\r\ngood housekeepers, well armed,\" etc. Burk[287:A] makes their number\r\n\"near six hundred men,\" and refers to ancient (MS.) records.\r\n\r\nBacon had been living in the colony somewhat less than three years,\r\nhaving settled at Curles, on the lower James, in the midst of those\r\npeople who were the greatest sufferers from the depredations of the\r\nIndians, and he himself had frequently felt the effects of their\r\ninroads. In the records of the county court of Henrico there is a deed\r\nfrom Randolph to Randolph, dated November 1st, 1706, conveying a tract\r\nof land called Curles, lately belonging to Nathaniel Bacon, Esq., and\r\nsince found to escheat to his majesty. At the breaking out of these\r\ndisturbances he was a member of the council. He was gifted with a\r\ngraceful person, great abilities, and a powerful elocution, and was the\r\nmost accomplished man in Virginia; his courage and resolution were not\r\nto be daunted, and his affability, hospitality, and benevolence,\r\ncommanded a wide popularity throughout the colony.\r\n\r\nThe men who had put themselves under Bacon's command made preparations\r\nfor marching against the Indians, but in the mean time sent again to\r\nobtain from the governor a commission of general for Bacon, with\r\nauthority to lead out his followers, at their own expense, against the\r\nenemy. He then stood so high in the council, and the exigency of the\r\ncase was so pressing, that Sir William Berkley, thinking it imprudent to\r\nreturn an absolute refusal, concluded to temporize. Some of the leading\r\nmen about him, it was believed, took occasion to foment the difference\r\nbetween him and Bacon, envying a rising luminary that threatened to\r\neclipse them. This conduct is like that of some of the leading men in\r\nVirginia who, one hundred years later, compelled Patrick Henry to resign\r\nhis post in the army.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley sent his evasive reply to the application for a\r\ncommission, by some of his friends, and instructed them to persuade\r\nBacon to disband his forces. He refused to comply with this request, and\r\nhaving in twenty days mustered five hundred men, marched to the falls of\r\nthe James. Thereupon the governor, on the 29th day of May, 1676, issued\r\na proclamation, declaring all such as should fail to return within a\r\ncertain time, rebels. Bacon likewise issued a declaration, setting\r\nforth the public dangers and grievances, but taking no notice of the\r\ngovernor's proclamation.[288:A] Upon this the men of property, fearful\r\nof a confiscation, deserted Bacon and returned home; but he proceeded\r\nwith fifty-seven men. Sir William Berkley, with a troop of horse from\r\nMiddle Plantation, pursued Bacon as far as the falls, some forty miles,\r\nbut not overtaking him, returned to Jamestown, where the assembly was\r\nsoon to meet. During his absence the planters of the lower country rose\r\nin revolt, and declared against the frontier forts as a useless and\r\nintolerable burden; and to restore quiet they were dismantled, and the\r\nassembly, the odious Long Parliament of Virginia, was at last dissolved,\r\nand writs for a new election issued. This revolt in the lower country,\r\nwith which Bacon had no immediate connection, demonstrates how widely\r\nthe leaven of rebellion, as it was styled, pervaded the body of the\r\npeople, and how unfounded is the notion, that it was the result merely\r\nof personal pique and ambition in Bacon. Had he never set his foot on\r\nthe soil of Virginia there can be little doubt but that an outbreak\r\nwould have occurred at this time. There was no man in the colony with\r\na brighter prospect before him than Bacon, and he could hardly have\r\nengaged in this popular movement without a sacrifice of selfish\r\nconsiderations, nor with out incurring imminent risk. The movement was\r\nrevolutionary--a miniature prototype of the revolution of 1688 in\r\nEngland, and of 1776 in America. But Bacon, as before mentioned, with a\r\nsmall body of men proceeded into the wilderness, up the river, his\r\nprovisions being nearly exhausted before he discovered the Indians. At\r\nlength a tribe of friendly Mannakins were found entrenched within a\r\npalisaded fort on the further side of a branch of the James. Bacon\r\nendeavoring to procure provisions from them and offering compensation,\r\nthey put him off with delusive promises till the third day, when the\r\nwhites had eaten their last morsel. They now waded up to the shoulder\r\nacross the branch to the fort, again soliciting provisions and tendering\r\npayment. In the evening one of Bacon's men was killed by a shot from\r\nthat side of the branch which they had left, and this giving rise to a\r\nsuspicion of collusion with Sir William Berkley and treachery, Bacon\r\nstormed the fort, burnt it and the cabins, blew up their magazine of\r\narms and gunpowder, and with a loss of only three of his own party, put\r\nto death one hundred and fifty Indians. It is difficult to credit,\r\nimpossible to justify, this massacre. The Virginians, a hundred years\r\nafterwards, suspected Governor Dunmore of colluding with Indians. Bacon\r\nwith his followers returned to their homes, and he was shortly after\r\nelected one of the burgesses for the County of Henrico. Brewse or Bruce,\r\nhis colleague and a captain of the insurgents, was not less odious to\r\nthe governor. It was subsequently charged by the king's commissioners\r\nthat the malecontent voters on this occasion illegally returned freemen,\r\nnot being freeholders, for burgesses.[289:A] The charge was well\r\nfounded. It is probable also that others were allowed to vote besides\r\nfreeholders and housekeepers. Bacon, upon being elected, going down the\r\nJames River with a party of his friends, was met by an armed vessel,\r\nordered on board of her, and arrested by Major Howe, High Sheriff of\r\nJames City, who conveyed him to the governor at that place, by whom he\r\nwas accosted thus: \"Mr. Bacon, you have forgot to be a gentleman.\" He\r\nreplied, \"No, may it please your honor.\" The governor said, \"Then I'll\r\ntake your parole;\" which he accordingly did, and gave him his liberty;\r\nbut a number of his companions, who had been arrested with him, were\r\nstill kept in irons.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th day of June, 1676, the members of the new assembly, whose\r\nnames are not recorded, met in the chamber over the general court, and\r\nhaving chosen a speaker, the governor sent for them down, and addressed\r\nthem in a brief abrupt speech on the Indian disturbances, and in\r\nallusion to the chiefs who had been slain, exclaimed: \"If they had\r\nkilled my grandfather and my grandmother, my father and mother, and all\r\nmy friends, yet if they had come to treat of peace, they ought to have\r\ngone in peace.\" After a short interval, he again rose and said: \"If\r\nthere be joy in the presence of the angels over one sinner that\r\nrepenteth, there is joy now, for we have a penitent sinner come before\r\nus. Call Mr. Bacon.\" Bacon appearing, was compelled upon one knee, at\r\nthe bar of the house, to confess his offence, and beg pardon of God, the\r\nking, and governor, in the following words:[290:A] \"I, Nathaniel Bacon,\r\nJr., Esq., of Henrico County, in Virginia, do hereby most readily,\r\nfreely, and most humbly acknowledge that I am, and have been guilty of\r\ndivers late unlawful, mutinous, and rebellious practices, contrary to my\r\nduty to his most sacred majesty's governor, and this country, by beating\r\nup of drums; raising of men in arms; marching with them into several\r\nparts of his most sacred majesty's colony, not only without order and\r\ncommission, but contrary to the express orders and commands of the Right\r\nHonorable Sir William Berkley, Knt., his majesty's most worthy governor\r\nand captain-general of Virginia. And I do further acknowledge that the\r\nsaid honorable governor hath been very favorable to me, by his several\r\nreiterated gracious offers of pardon, thereby to reclaim me from the\r\npersecution of those my unjust proceedings, (whose noble and generous\r\nmercy and clemency I can never sufficiently acknowledge,) and for the\r\nre-settlement of this whole country in peace and quietness. And I do\r\nhereby, upon my knees, most humbly beg of Almighty God and of his\r\nmajesty's said governor, that upon this my most hearty and unfeigned\r\nacknowledgment of my said miscarriages and unwarrantable practices, he\r\nwill please to grant me his gracious pardon and indemnity, humbly\r\ndesiring also the honorable council of state, by whose goodness I am\r\nalso much obliged, and the honorable burgesses of the present grand\r\nassembly to intercede, and mediate with his honor, to grant me such\r\npardon. And I do hereby promise, upon the word and faith of a Christian\r\nand a gentleman, that upon such pardon granted me, as I shall ever\r\nacknowledge so great a favor, so I will always bear true faith and\r\nallegiance to his most sacred majesty, and demean myself dutifully,\r\nfaithfully, and peaceably to the government, and the laws of this\r\ncountry, and am most ready and willing to enter into bond of two\r\nthousand pounds sterling, and for security thereof bind my whole estate\r\nin Virginia to the country for my good and quiet behavior for one whole\r\nyear from this date, and do promise and oblige myself to continue my\r\nsaid duty and allegiance at all times afterwards. In testimony of this,\r\nmy free and hearty recognition, I have hereunto subscribed my name, this\r\n9th day of June, 1676.\r\n\r\n                                                   \"NATH. BACON.\"\r\n\r\nThe intercession of the council was in the following terms: \"We, of his\r\nmajesty's council of state of Virginia, do hereby desire, according to\r\nMr. Bacon's request, the right honorable the governor, to grant the said\r\nMr. Bacon his freedom.\r\n\r\n                       PHIL. LUDWELL,             HEN. CHICHELEY,\r\n                       JAMES BRAY,                NATHL. BACON,\r\n                       WM. COLE,                  THOS. BEALE,\r\n                       RA. WORMELEY,              THO. BALLARD,\r\n                                     JO. BRIDGER.\r\n\r\n\"Dated the 9th of June, 1676.\"\r\n\r\n       +       +       +       +       +\r\n\r\nWhen Bacon had made his acknowledgment, the governor exclaimed: \"God\r\nforgive you, I forgive you;\" repeating the words thrice. Colonel Cole,\r\nof the council, added, \"and all that were with him.\" \"Yea,\" echoed the\r\ngovernor, \"and all that were with him.\" Sir William Berkley, starting up\r\nfrom his chair for the third time, exclaimed: \"Mr. Bacon, if you will\r\nlive civilly but till next quarter court, I'll promise to restore you\r\nagain to your place there,\" (pointing with his hand to Mr. Bacon's\r\nseat,) he having, as has been already mentioned, been of the council\r\nbefore those troubles, and having been deposed by the governor's\r\nproclamation. But instead of being obliged to wait till the quarter\r\ncourt, Bacon was restored to his seat on that very day; and intelligence\r\nof it was hailed with joyful acclamations by the people in Jamestown.\r\nThis took place on Saturday. Bacon was also promised a commission to go\r\nout against the Indians, to be delivered to him on the Monday following.\r\nBut being delayed or disappointed, a few days after (the assembly being\r\nengaged in devising measures against the Indians) he escaped from\r\nJamestown. He conceived the governor's pretended generosity to be only a\r\nlure to keep him out of his seat in the house of burgesses, and to quiet\r\nthe people of the upper country, who were hastening down to Jamestown to\r\navenge all wrongs done him or his friends. According to another account,\r\nhe obtained leave of absence to visit his wife, \"sick, as he pretended;\"\r\nbut from T. M.'s Account, and others, this version appears to be\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\nThere was in the council at this time one Colonel Nathaniel Bacon, a\r\nnear relative of Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., who was not yet thirty years of\r\nage. The elder Bacon was a wealthy politic old man, childless, and\r\nintending to make his namesake and cousin his heir. It was by the\r\npressing solicitations of this old gentleman, as was believed, that\r\nyoung Bacon was reluctantly prevailed upon to repeat at the bar of the\r\nhouse the recantation written by the old gentleman. It was he also, as\r\nwas supposed, who gave timely warning to the young Bacon to fly for his\r\nlife. Three or four days after his first arrest, many country people,\r\nfrom the heads of the rivers, appeared in Jamestown; but finding him\r\nrestored to his place in the council, and his companions at liberty,\r\nthey returned home satisfied. But in a short time the governor, seeing\r\nall quiet, issued secret warrants to seize him again, intending probably\r\nto raise the militia, and thus prevent a rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[283:A] T.

Sir William Berkley summoned the York train-bands to\r\ndefend Jamestown, but only one hundred obeyed the summons, and they\r\narrived too late, and one-half of them were favorable to Bacon.\r\nExpresses almost hourly brought tidings of his approach, and in less\r\nthan four days he marched into Jamestown unresisted, at two o'clock\r\nP.M., and drew up his force, (now amounting to six hundred men,) horse\r\nand foot, in battle array on the green in front of the state-house, and\r\nwithin gunshot. In half an hour the drum beat, as was the custom, for\r\nthe assembly to meet, and in less than thirty minutes Bacon advanced,\r\nwith a file of fusileers on either hand, near to the corner of the\r\nstate-house, where he was met by the governor and council. Sir William\r\nBerkley, dramatically baring his breast, cried out, \"Here! shoot\r\nme--fore God, fair mark; shoot!\" frequently repeating the words. Bacon\r\nreplied, \"No, may it please your honor, we will not hurt a hair of your\r\nhead, nor of any other man's; we are come for a commission to save our\r\nlives from the Indians, which you have so often promised, and now we\r\nwill have it before we go.\" Bacon was walking to and fro between the\r\nfiles of his men, holding his left arm akimbo, and gesticulating\r\nviolently with his right, he and the governor both like men distracted.\r\nIn a few moments Sir William withdrew to his private apartment at the\r\nother end of the state-house, the council accompanying him. Bacon\r\nfollowed, frequently hurrying his hand from his sword-hilt to his hat;\r\nand after him came a detachment of fusileers, who, with their guns\r\ncocked and presented at a window of the assembly chamber, filled with\r\nfaces, repeating in menacing tone, \"We will have it, we will have it,\"\r\nfor half a minute, when a well-known burgess, waving his handkerchief\r\nout at the window, exclaimed, three or four times, \"You shall have it,\r\nyou shall have it;\" when, uncocking their guns, they rested them on the\r\nground, and stood still, till Bacon returning, they rejoined the main\r\nbody. It was said that Bacon had beforehand directed his men to fire in\r\ncase he should draw his sword. In about an hour after Bacon re-entered\r\nthe assembly chamber, and demanded a commission, authorizing him to\r\nmarch out against the Indians. Godwyn, the speaker,[294:A] who was\r\nhimself a Baconian, as were a majority of the house, remaining silent in\r\nthe chair, Brewse, (or Bruce,)[294:B] the colleague of Bacon, alone\r\nfound courage to answer: \"'Twas not in our province, or power, nor of\r\nany other, save the king's vicegerent, our governor.\" Bacon,\r\nnevertheless, still warmly urged his demand, and harangued the assembly\r\nfor nearly half an hour on the Indian disturbances, the condition of the\r\npublic revenues, the exorbitant taxes, abuses and corruptions of the\r\nadministration, and all the grievances of their miserable country.\r\nHaving concluded, and finding \"no other answer, he went away\r\ndissatisfied.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day the governor directed the house to take measures to\r\ndefend the country against the Indians, and advised them to beware of\r\ntwo rogues among them, meaning Lawrence and Drummond, who both lived at\r\nJamestown. But some of the burgesses, in order to effect a redress of\r\nsome of the grievances that the country labored under, made motions for\r\ninspecting the public revenues, the collector's accounts, etc., when\r\nthey received pressing messages from the governor to meddle with nothing\r\nelse till the Indian business was disposed of. The debate on this matter\r\nrose high, but the governor's orders were finally acquiesced in.\r\n\r\nWhile the committee on Indian affairs was sitting, the Queen of\r\nPamunkey, a descendant of Opechancanough, was introduced into their\r\nroom. Accompanied by an interpreter and her son, a youth of twenty\r\nyears, she entered with graceful dignity. Around her head she wore a\r\nplait of black and white wampum-peake, a drilled purple bead of shell,\r\nthree inches wide, after the manner of a crown. There is preserved at\r\nFredericksburg a silver frontlet, purchased from some Indians, with a\r\ncoat of arms, and inscribed \"The Queen of Pamunkey,\" \"Charles the\r\nSecond, King of England, Scotland, France, Ireland, and Virginia,\" and\r\n\"Honi soit qui mal y pense.\" She was clothed in a mantle of dressed\r\nbuckskin, with the fur outward, and bordered with a deep fringe from\r\nhead to foot. Being seated, the chairman asked her \"How many men she\r\nwould lend the English for guides and allies?\" She referred him to her\r\nson, who understood English, being the reputed son of an English\r\ncolonel. But he declining to answer, she burst forth in an impassioned\r\nspeech of a quarter of an hour's length, often repeating the words,\r\n\"Totopotomoi dead,\" referring to her husband, who, as has been seen, had\r\nfallen while fighting under Colonel Hill, the elder. The chairman,\r\nuntouched by this appeal, roughly repeated the inquiry, how many men she\r\nwould contribute. Averting her head with a disdainful look she sate\r\nsilent, till the question being pressed a third time, she replied in a\r\nlow tone, \"Six.\" When still further importuned she said \"Twelve,\"\r\nalthough she had then one hundred and fifty warriors in her town. She\r\nretired silent and displeased.\r\n\r\nThe assembly went on to provide for the Indian war, and made Nathaniel\r\nBacon, Jr., general and commander-in-chief, which was ratified by the\r\ngovernor and council. An act was also passed indemnifying Bacon and his\r\nparty for their violent acts; and a highly applausive letter was\r\nprepared, justifying Bacon's designs and proceedings, addressed to the\r\nking and subscribed by the governor, council, and assembly. Sir William\r\nBerkley at the same time communicated to the house a letter addressed to\r\nhis majesty, saying: \"I have above thirty years governed the most\r\nflourishing country the sun ever shone over, but am now encompassed with\r\nrebellion like waters, in every respect like that of Massaniello, except\r\ntheir leader.\" Massaniello, or Thomas Anello, a fisherman of Naples,\r\nborn 1623, exasperated by the oppressive taxes imposed by Austria upon\r\nhis countrymen, at the head of two thousand young men, armed with canes,\r\noverthrew the viceroy, seized upon the supreme power, and after holding\r\nit for some years, fell by the hands of assassins in 1647. Some of the\r\nburgesses also wrote to the king, setting forth the circumstances of the\r\noutbreak. The amnesty extended from the 1st day of March to the 25th day\r\nof June, 1676, and excepted only offences against the law concerning the\r\nIndian trade.[296:A] The assembly did not restrict itself to measures\r\nfavorable to Bacon. According to the letter of the law, at least, he had\r\nbeen guilty of rebellion in assuming a military command and marching\r\nagainst the savages without a commission, and he had so acknowledged.\r\nYet he was not more guilty than the bulk of the people of the colony,\r\nand probably not more so than a majority of the assembly itself; and the\r\npopular movement seemed justified by an urgent necessity of\r\nself-defence, and an intolerable accumulation of public grievances. On\r\nthe other hand, Sir William Berkley had violated his solemn engagement\r\nto grant the commission. Besides, it did not escape the notice of the\r\nassembly that the term of ten years for which, it was believed, he had\r\nbeen appointed, had expired; and this circumstance, although it might\r\nnot be held absolutely to terminate his authority, served at the least\r\nto attenuate it. The assembly adopted measures with a view at once to\r\nvindicate the supremacy of the law; to heal the wounded pride of the\r\naged governor; to protect the country; to screen Bacon and his\r\nconfederates from punishment, and to reform the abuses of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the resolutions, instructing the Virginia\r\ndelegates in Congress to declare the colonies free and independent, were\r\npassed in June, 1776, and that the assembly, under Bacon's influence,\r\nmet in June, 1676. The first act of this session declared war against\r\nthe hostile Indians, ordering a levy of one thousand men, and\r\nauthorizing General Bacon to receive volunteers; and if their number\r\nshould prove sufficient, to dispense with the regular force; Indians\r\ntaken in war to be made slaves; the forces divided into southern and\r\nnorthern, and such officers to be appointed to command these divisions\r\nas the governor should commission. An act was then passed for the\r\nsuppressing of tumults, the preamble reciting that there had of late\r\n\"been many unlawful tumults, routs, and riots, in divers parts of this\r\ncountry, and that certain ill-disposed and disaffected people of late\r\ngathered, and may again gather themselves together, by beat of drum and\r\notherwise, in a most apparent rebellious manner, without any authority\r\nor legal commission, which may prove of very dangerous consequences,\"\r\netc. The act for regulating of officers and offices, shows how many\r\nabuses and how much rapacity had crept into the administration. By this\r\nact it was declared that no person, not being a native or minister,\r\ncould hold any office until he had resided in the colony for three\r\nyears. The democratic spirit of this assembly displayed itself in a law\r\n\"enabling freemen to vote for burgesses;\" and another making the church\r\nvestries eligible by the freemen of the parish, once in three years.\r\nRepresentatives were to be chosen by the people in each parish to vote\r\nwith the justices in laying the county levy, and in making by-laws. The\r\ncounty courts were authorized to appoint their own collectors; and\r\nmembers of the council were prohibited from voting with the justices. An\r\nact for suppressing of ordinaries, or country taverns, suppressed all\r\nexcept three, one at James City, and one at each side of York River, at\r\nthe great ferries; and these were prohibited from retailing any liquors,\r\nexcept beer and cider. Lieutenant-Colonel Hill, and Lieutenant John\r\nStith, both of the parish of Westover, and County of Charles City, were\r\ndisabled from holding office in that county, for having fomented\r\nmisunderstandings between the honorable governor and his majesty's good\r\nand loyal subjects, the inhabitants of the Counties of Charles City and\r\nHenrico, and having been instrumental in levying unjust and exorbitant\r\ntaxes.[297:A] In evidence of the excitement and suspicion then\r\nprevailing, it was observed that some of the burgesses wore distinctive\r\nbadges; a hundred years afterwards the opposite parties walked on\r\nopposite sides of the street.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the assembly was dissolved by the governor, who, seeing\r\nhow great Bacon's influence was, apprehended only further mischief from\r\ntheir proceedings. A number of the burgesses, intending to depart on the\r\nmorrow, having met in the evening to take leave of each other, General\r\nBacon, as he now came to be styled, entered the room with a handful of\r\npapers, and, looking around, inquired, \"Which of these gentlemen shall I\r\ninterest to write a few words for me?\" All present looking aside, being\r\nunwilling to act, Lawrence, Bacon's friend, pointing to one of the\r\ncompany, (the author of T. M.'s Account,) said: \"That gentleman writes\r\nvery well,\" and he, undertaking to excuse himself, Bacon, bowing low,\r\nsaid: \"Pray, sir, do me the honor to write a line for me;\" and he now\r\nconsenting, was detained during the whole night, filling up commissions\r\nobtained from the governor, and signed by him. These commissions Bacon\r\nfilled almost altogether with the names of the militia officers of the\r\ncountry, the first men in the colony in fortune, rank, and influence.\r\n\r\nHis vigorous measures at once restored confidence to the planters, and\r\nthey resumed their occupations. Bacon, at the head of a thousand men,\r\nmarched against the Pamunkies, killing many and destroying their towns.\r\nMeanwhile the people of Gloucester, the most populous and loyal county,\r\nhaving been disarmed by Bacon, petitioned the governor for protection\r\nagainst the savages. Reanimated by this petition, he again proclaimed\r\nBacon a rebel and a traitor, and hastened over to Gloucester. Summoning\r\nthe train-bands of that county and Middlesex, to the number of twelve\r\nhundred men, he proposed to them to pursue and put down the rebel\r\nBacon--when the whole assembly unanimously shouted, \"Bacon! Bacon!\r\nBacon!\" and withdrew from the field, still repeating the name of that\r\npopular leader, the Patrick Henry of his day, and leaving the aged\r\ncavalier governor and his attendants to themselves. The issue was now\r\nfairly joined between the people and the governor. Francis Morryson,\r\nafterwards one of the king's commissioners, in a letter dated at London,\r\nNovember 28th, 1677, and addressed to Secretary Ludwell, says: \"I fear\r\nwhen that part of the narrative comes to be read that mentions the\r\nGloucester petitions, your brother may be prejudiced, for there are two\r\nor three that will be summoned, will lay the contrivance at your\r\nbrother's door and Beverley's, but more upon your brother, who, they\r\nsay, was the drawer of it. For at the first sight, all the lords judged\r\nthat that was the unhappy accident that made the Indian war recoil into\r\na civil war; for the reason you alleged that bond and oath were\r\nproffered the governor, intended not against Bacon but the Indians,\r\nconfirmed the people that Bacon's commission was good, it never being\r\nbefore disavowed by proclamation, but by letters writ to his majesty in\r\ncommendation of Bacon's acting, copies thereof dispersed among the\r\npeople.\"[299:A] According to another authority[299:B] the people of\r\nGloucester refused to march against Bacon, but pledged themselves to\r\ndefend the governor against him, if he should turn against Sir William\r\nBerkley and his government, which they hoped would never happen. From\r\nthe result of this affair of the Gloucester petitions, we may conclude\r\nthat either they contained nothing unfavorable to Bacon, or if they did,\r\nthat they were gotten up by designing leaders without the consent of the\r\npeople. It is certain that now, when Bacon's violent proceedings at\r\nJamestown were known, the great body of the people espoused his cause\r\nand approved his designs.\r\n\r\nBacon, before he reached the head of York River, hearing from Lawrence\r\nand Drummond of the governor's movements, exclaimed, that \"it vexed him\r\nto the heart, that while he was hunting wolves which were destroying\r\ninnocent lambs, the governor and those with him should pursue him in the\r\nrear with full cry; and that he was like corn between two mill-stones,\r\nwhich would grind him to powder if he didn't look to it.\" He marched\r\nimmediately back against the governor, who finding himself abandoned,\r\nagain, on the twenty-ninth of July, proclaimed Bacon a rebel, and made\r\nhis escape, with a few friends, down York River and across the\r\nChesapeake Bay to Accomac, on the Eastern Shore. A vindication of Sir\r\nWilliam, afterwards published, says: \"Nor is it to be wondered at that\r\nhe did not immediately put forth proclamations to undeceive the people,\r\nbecause he had then no means of securing himself, nor forces to have\r\nmaintained such a proclamation by; but he took the first opportunity he\r\ncould of doing all this, when Gloucester County, having been plundered\r\nby Bacon before his going out against the Indians, made an\r\naddress.\"[300:A]\r\n\r\nBacon, upon reaching Gloucester, sent out parties of horse to patrol the\r\ncountry, and made prisoners such as were suspected of disaffection to\r\nhis Indian expedition; releasing on parole those who took an oath to\r\nreturn home and remain quiet. This oath was strict in form but\r\npractically little regarded.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there was detected in Bacon's camp a spy, who pretended\r\nto be a deserter from the opposite party, and who had repeatedly changed\r\nsides. Upon his being sentenced to death by a court-martial, Bacon\r\ndeclared that \"if any one in the army would speak a word to save him, he\r\nshould not suffer;\" but no one interceding, he was put to death. Bacon's\r\nclemency won the admiration of the army, and this was the only instance\r\nof capital punishment under his orders, nor did he plunder any private\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHaving now acquired the command of a province of forty-five thousand\r\ninhabitants, and from which the crown derived a revenue of a hundred\r\nthousand pounds, he sate down with his army at Middle Plantation, and\r\nsent out an invitation, subscribed by himself and four of the council,\r\nto all the principal gentlemen of the country, to meet him in a\r\nconvention at his headquarters, to consult how the Indians were to be\r\nproceeded against, and himself and the army protected against the\r\ndesigns of Sir William Berkley.[300:B] Bacon also put forth a reply to\r\nthe governor's proclamations, demanding whether those who are entirely\r\ndevoted to the king and country, can deserve the name of rebels and\r\ntraitors? In vindication of their loyalty, he points to the peaceable\r\nconduct of his soldiers, and calls upon the whole country to witness\r\nagainst him if they can. He reproaches some of the men in power with the\r\nmeanness of their capacity; others with their ill-gotten wealth; he\r\ninquires what arts, sciences, schools of learning or manufactures they\r\nhad promoted; he justifies his warring against the Indians, and\r\ninveighs against Sir William Berkley for siding with them; insisting\r\nthat he had no right to interfere with the fur-trade, since it was a\r\nmonopoly of the crown, and asserting that the governor's factors on the\r\nfrontier trafficked in the blood of their countrymen, by supplying the\r\nsavages with arms and ammunition, contrary to law. He concludes by\r\nappealing to the king and parliament.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Bacon's invitation, a great convention, including\r\nmany of the principal men of the colony, assembled at his quarters in\r\nAugust, 1676, at Middle Plantation. In preparing an oath to be\r\nadministered to the people, the three articles proposed were read by\r\nJames Minge, clerk of the house of burgesses: First, that they should\r\naid General Bacon in the Indian war; second, that they would oppose Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley's endeavors to hinder the same; third, that they would\r\noppose any power sent out from England, till terms were agreed to,\r\ngranting that the country's complaint should be heard against Sir\r\nWilliam before the king and parliament. A \"bloody debate\" ensued,\r\nespecially on this last article, and it lasted from noon till midnight,\r\nBacon and some of the principal men supporting it, and he protested that\r\nunless it should be adopted he would surrender his commission to the\r\nassembly. Some report[301:A] that Bacon contended in this debate\r\nsingle-handed against \"a great many counted the wisest in the country.\"\r\nWith what interest would we read a report of his speech! But his\r\neloquence, like Henry's, lives only in tradition. In this critical\r\nconjuncture, when the scales of self-defence and of loyalty hung in\r\nequipoise, the gunner of York Fort brought sudden news of fresh murders\r\nperpetrated by the Indians in Gloucester County, near Carter's Creek,\r\nadding that a great number of poor people had taken refuge in the fort.\r\nBacon demanded, \"How it could be possible that the chief fort in\r\nVirginia should be threatened by the Indians?\" The gunner replied, \"That\r\nthe governor on the day before had conveyed all arms and ammunition out\r\nof the fort into his own vessel.\" This probably took place on the\r\ntwenty-ninth of July. Dunmore removed the gunpowder a century\r\nafterwards. The disclosure produced a deep sensation, and the\r\nconvention now became reconciled to the oath. Among the subscribers on\r\nthis occasion were Colonel Ballard, Colonel Beale, Colonel Swan, and\r\n'Squire Bray, of the council; Colonels Jordan, Smith, of Purton,\r\nScarburgh, Miller, Lawrence, and William Drummond. He had been recently\r\ngovernor of North Carolina. It has been supposed that he was a\r\nPresbyterian. He was a Scotchman; but the command of a colony would\r\nhardly at that time have been intrusted to a Presbyterian.[302:A] Writs\r\nwere issued in his majesty's name for an assembly to meet on the fourth\r\nday of September; they were signed by the four members of the council.\r\nThe oath was administered to the people of every rank, except servants,\r\nand it was as follows: \"Whereas, the country hath raised an army against\r\nour common enemy, the Indians, and the same, under the command of\r\nGeneral Bacon, being upon the point to march forth against the said\r\ncommon enemy, hath been diverted and necessitated to move to the\r\nsuppressing of forces by evil-disposed persons raised against the said\r\nGeneral Bacon purposely to foment and stir up civil war among us, to the\r\nruin of this, his majesty's country. And whereas, it is notoriously\r\nmanifest that Sir William Berkley, Knight, governor of the country,\r\nassisted counselled, and abetted by those evil-disposed persons\r\naforesaid, hath not only commanded, fomented, and stirred up the people\r\nto the said civil war, but failing therein hath withdrawn himself, to\r\nthe great astonishment of the people and the unsettlement of the\r\ncountry. And whereas, the said army raised by the country for the causes\r\naforesaid remain full of dissatisfaction in the middle of the country,\r\nexpecting attempts from the said governor and the evil counsellors\r\naforesaid. And since no proper means have been found out for the\r\nsettlement of the distractions, and preventing the horrid outrages and\r\nmurders daily committed in many places of the country by the barbarous\r\nenemy; it hath been thought fit by the said general to call unto him all\r\nsuch sober and discreet gentlemen as the present circumstances of the\r\ncountry will admit, to the Middle Plantation, to consult and advise of\r\nre-establishing the peace of the country. So we, the said gentlemen,\r\nbeing, this 3d of August, 1676, accordingly met, do advise, resolve,\r\ndeclare, and conclude, and for ourselves do swear in manner following:\r\nFirst, That we will at all times join with the said General Bacon, and\r\nhis army, against the common enemy in all points whatsoever. Secondly,\r\nThat, whereas, certain persons have lately contrived, and designed the\r\nraising forces against the said general and the army under his command,\r\nthereby to beget a civil war, we will endeavor the discovery and\r\napprehending all and every of those evil-disposed persons, and them\r\nsecure until further order from the general. Thirdly, And whereas, it is\r\ncredibly reported, that the governor hath informed the king's majesty\r\nthat the said general and the people of the country in arms under his\r\ncommand, their aiders and abettors, are rebellious and removed from\r\ntheir allegiance, and that upon such like information, he, the said\r\ngovernor, hath advised and petitioned the king to send forces to reduce\r\nthem: we do further declare, and believe in our consciences, that it\r\nconsists with the welfare of this country, and with our allegiance to\r\nhis most sacred majesty, that we, the inhabitants of Virginia, to the\r\nutmost of our power, do oppose and suppress all forces whatsoever of\r\nthat nature, until such time as the king be fully informed of the state\r\nof the case by such person or persons as shall be sent from the said\r\nNathaniel Bacon, in the behalf of the people, and the determination\r\nthereof be remitted hither. And we do swear that we will him, the said\r\ngeneral, and the army under his command, aid and assist\r\naccordingly.\"[303:A]\r\n\r\nDrummond advised that Sir William Berkley should be deposed, and Sir\r\nHenry Chicheley substituted in his place; his counsel not being approved\r\nof, he said: \"Do not make so strange of it, for I can show from ancient\r\nrecords, that such things have been done in Virginia,\" referring\r\nprobably to the case of Sir John Harvey. But it was agreed that the\r\ngovernor's withdrawal should be taken for an abdication. Sarah Drummond,\r\na patriot heroine, was no less enthusiastic in Bacon's favor than her\r\nhusband. She exclaimed, \"The child that is unborn shall have cause to\r\nrejoice for the good that will come by the rising of the country.\"\r\nRalph Weldinge said: \"We must expect a greater power from England that\r\nwould certainly be our ruin.\" But Sarah Drummond remembered that England\r\nwas divided into two hostile factions between the Duke of York and the\r\nDuke of Monmouth. Picking up from the ground a small stick and breaking\r\nit, she added: \"I fear the power of England no more than a broken\r\nstraw.\" Looking for relief from the odious navigation act, she declared:\r\n\"Now we can build ships, and, like New England, trade to any part of the\r\nworld;\" for New England evaded that act, which her people considered an\r\ninvasion of their rights, they not being represented in parliament.\r\n\r\nBacon also issued proclamations, commanding all men in the land, in case\r\nof the arrival of the forces expected from England, to join his standard\r\nand to retire into the wilderness, and resist the troops, until they\r\nshould agree to treat of an accommodation of the dispute.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentleman in Virginia, Giles Bland, only son of John Bland,\r\nan eminent London merchant, who was personally known to the king, and\r\nhad a considerable interest at court. He was, as has been seen, also a\r\ngenerous friend of Virginia. His brother, Theodorick Bland, sometime a\r\nmerchant at Luars, in Spain, came over to Virginia in 1654, where,\r\nsettling at Westover, upon James River, in Charles City County, he died,\r\nin April, 1671, aged forty-five years, and was buried in the chancel of\r\nthe church, which he built, and gave, together with ten acres of land, a\r\ncourt-house and prison for the county and parish. He lies buried in the\r\nWestover churchyard between two of his friends, the church having long\r\nsince fallen down. He was of the king's council and speaker of the house\r\nof burgesses, and was, in fortune and understanding, inferior to no man\r\nof his time in the country. He married Ann, daughter of Richard Bennet,\r\nsometime governor of the colony.[304:A] When John Bland sent out his son\r\nGiles Bland to Virginia to take possession of the estate of his uncle\r\nTheodorick, he got him appointed collector-general of the customs. The\r\ngovernors had hitherto held this office, and it was in 1676 that a\r\ncollector of the revenue was first sent over from England under\r\nparliamentary sanction, and it is therefore probable that the\r\nappointment of Bland diminished the perquisites of Governor Berkley.\r\nGiles Bland, in his capacity of collector, had a right to board any\r\nvessel whenever he might think it proper. He was a man of talents,\r\neducation, courage, and haughty bearing, and having before quarrelled\r\nwith the governor, now sided warmly with Bacon. There happened to be\r\nlying in York River a vessel of sixteen guns, commanded by a Captain\r\nLaramore, and Bland went on board of her with a party of armed men,\r\nunder pretence of searching for contraband goods, and seizing the\r\ncaptain, confined him in the cabin. Laramore, discovering Bland's\r\ndesigns, resolved to deceive him in his turn, and entered into his\r\nmeasures with such apparent sincerity that he was restored to the\r\ncommand of his vessel. With her, another vessel of four guns, under\r\nCaptain Carver, and a sloop, Bland, now appointed Bacon's\r\nlieutenant-general, sailed with two hundred and fifty men for Accomac,\r\nand after capturing another vessel, appeared off Accomac with four sail.\r\n\r\nThis peninsula, separated from the main land of Virginia by the wide\r\nChesapeake Bay, was then hardly accessible by land, owing to the great\r\ndistance and the danger of Indians. The position was therefore\r\ngeographically advantageous for the fugitive governor; but as yet few of\r\nthe inhabitants had rallied to his standard. They indeed shared in the\r\ngeneral disaffection, and availed themselves of this occasion to lay\r\ntheir grievances before Sir William Berkley, who found himself unable to\r\nredress his own. Some of the inhabitants of the Eastern Shore at this\r\ntime were engaged in committing depredations on the estates of the\r\nplanters on the other side of the bay, just as the adherents of Lord\r\nDunmore acted a century afterwards. Upon the appearance of Bland and his\r\nlittle squadron, Sir William Berkley, having not a single vessel to\r\ndefend him, was overwhelmed with despair; but at this juncture he\r\nreceived a note from Laramore, offering, if he would send him some\r\nassistance, to deliver Bland, with all his men, prisoners into his\r\nhands. The governor, having no high opinion of Laramore, suspected that\r\nhis note might be only a bait to entrap him; but upon advising with his\r\nfriend Colonel Philip Ludwell, he knowing Laramore and having a good\r\nopinion of him, counselled the governor to accept the offer as the best\r\nalternative now left him, and gallantly undertook to engage in the\r\nenterprise at the hazard of his life. Sir William consenting, Ludwell,\r\nwith twenty-six well-armed men, appeared at the appointed time alongside\r\nof Laramore's vessel. Laramore was prepared to receive the loyalists,\r\nand Ludwell boarded her without the loss of a man, and soon after\r\ncaptured the other vessels. According to T. M.'s Account, Captain Carver\r\nwas at this time, upon Sir William's invitation, holding an interview\r\nwith him on shore. Bland, Carver, and the other chiefs were sent to the\r\ngovernor, and the rest of the prisoners secured on board of the vessels.\r\nBland's expedition appears to have been very badly managed, and the\r\ndrunkenness of his men probably rendered his party so easy a\r\nprey.[306:A] The greater part of the prisoners screened themselves from\r\npunishment by entering into the governor's service. When Laramore waited\r\non the governor, he clasped him in his arms, called him his deliverer,\r\nand gave him a large share of his favor. In a few days the brave old\r\nCarver was hanged on the Accomac shore. Sir William Berkley afterwards\r\ndescribed him as \"a valiant man and stout seaman, miraculously delivered\r\ninto my hand.\" Sir Henry Chicheley, the chief of the council, who, with\r\nseveral other gentlemen, was a prisoner in Bacon's hands, afterwards\r\nexclaimed against this act of the governor as most rash and cruel, and\r\nhe expected, at the time, to be executed in the same manner by way of\r\nretaliation. Bland was put in irons and badly treated, as it was\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gardner, sailing from the James River, went to the governor's\r\nrelief with his own vessel, the Adam and Eve, and ten or twelve sloops,\r\nwhich he had collected upon hearing of Bland's expedition. Sir William\r\nBerkley, by this unexpected turn of affairs, raised from the abyss of\r\ndespair to the pinnacle of hope, resolved to push his success still\r\nfurther. With Laramore's vessel and Gardner's, and sixteen or seventeen\r\nsloops, and a motley band of six hundred, or, according to another\r\naccount, one thousand men in arms, \"rogues and royalists,\" the governor\r\nreturned in triumph to Jamestown, September 7th, 1676, where, falling\r\non his knees, he returned thanks to God, and again proclaimed Bacon and\r\nhis adherents rebels and traitors. There were now in Jamestown nine\r\nhundred Baconites, as they had come to be styled, under command of\r\nColonel Hansford, commissioned by Bacon. Berkley sent in a summons for\r\nsurrender of the town, with offer of pardon to all except Drummond and\r\nLawrence. Upon this, all of them retired to their homes except Hansford,\r\nLawrence, Drummond, and a few others, who made for the head of York\r\nRiver, in quest of Bacon, who had returned to that quarter.\r\n\r\nDuring these events Bacon was executing his designs against the Indians.\r\nAs soon as he had dispatched Bland to Accomac, he crossed the James\r\nRiver at his own house, at Curles, and surprising the Appomattox\r\nIndians, who lived on both sides of the river of that name, a little\r\nbelow the falls, (now Petersburg,) he burnt their town, killed a large\r\nnumber of the tribe, and dispersed the rest.[307:A] Burk[307:B] places\r\nthis battle or massacre on Bloody Run, a small stream emptying into the\r\nJames at Richmond, but he refers to no authority, and probably had none\r\nbetter than a loose tradition. The Appomattox Indians, it appears,\r\noccupied both sides of the river in question, and it is altogether\r\nimprobable that Indians still inhabited the north bank of the James\r\nRiver near Curles. Besides, if they had still inhabited that side, it\r\nwould have been unnecessary to cross the James before commencing the\r\nattack. Curles was a proper point for crossing the James with a view of\r\nattacking the Indians on the Appomattox.\r\n\r\nFrom the falls of the Appomattox, Bacon traversed the country to the\r\nsouthward, destroying many towns on the banks of the Nottoway, the\r\nMeherrin, and the Roanoke. His name had become so formidable, that the\r\nnatives fled everywhere before him, and having nothing to subsist upon,\r\nsave the spontaneous productions of the country, several tribes\r\nperished, and they who survived were so reduced as to be never\r\nafterwards able to make any firm stand against the Long-knives, and\r\ngradually became tributary to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[294:A] Hening, ii. 606.\r\n\r\n[294:B] Breviarie and Conclusion, in Burk, ii. 250.

Upon receiving intelligence of the\r\ngovernor's return, Bacon, collecting a force variously estimated at one\r\nhundred and fifty, three hundred, and eight hundred, harangued them on\r\nthe situation of affairs, and marched back upon Jamestown, leading his\r\nIndian captives in triumph before him. The contending parties came now\r\nto be distinguished by the names of Rebels and Royalists. Finding the\r\ntown defended by a palisade ten paces in width, running across the neck\r\nof the peninsula, he rode along the work, and reconnoitred the\r\ngovernor's position. Then, dismounting from his horse, he animated his\r\nfatigued men to advance at once, and, leading them close to the\r\npalisade, sounded a defiance with the trumpet, and fired upon the\r\ngarrison. The governor remained quiet, hoping that want of provisions\r\nwould soon force Bacon to retire; but he supplied his troops from Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley's seat, at Greenspring, three miles distant. He\r\nafterwards complained that \"his dwelling-house at Greenspring was almost\r\nruined; his household goods, and others of great value, totally\r\nplundered; that he had not a bed to lie on; two great beasts, three\r\nhundred sheep, seventy horses and mares, all his corn and provisions,\r\ntaken away.\"\r\n\r\nBacon adopted a singular stratagem, and one hardly compatible with the\r\nrules of chivalry. Sending out small parties of horse, he captured the\r\nwives of several of the principal loyalists then with the governor, and\r\namong them the lady of Colonel Bacon, Sr., Madame Bray, Madame Page, and\r\nMadame Ballard. Upon their being brought into the camp, Bacon sends one\r\nof them into Jamestown to carry word to their husbands that his purpose\r\nwas to place their wives in front of his men in case of a sally.[309:A]\r\nColonel Ludwell[309:B] reproaches the rebels with \"ravishing of women\r\nfrom their homes, and hurrying them about the country in their rude\r\ncamps, often threatening them with death.\" But, according to another and\r\nmore impartial authority,[309:C] Bacon made use of the ladies only to\r\ncomplete his battery, and removed them out of harm's way at the time of\r\nthe sortie. He raised by moonlight a circumvallation of trees, earth,\r\nand brush-wood, around the governor's outworks. At daybreak next morning\r\nthe governor's troops, being fired upon, made a sortie; but they were\r\ndriven back, leaving their drum and their dead behind them. Upon the top\r\nof the work which he had thrown up, and where alone a sally could be\r\nmade, Bacon exhibited the captive ladies to the views of their husbands\r\nand friends in the town, and kept them there until he completed his\r\nworks. The peninsula of Jamestown is formed by the James River on the\r\nsouth, and a deep creek on the north encircling it within ten paces of\r\nthe river. This island, for it is so styled, is about two miles long,\r\neast and west, and one mile broad. It is low, consisting mainly of\r\nmarshes and swamps, and in consequence very unhealthy. There are no\r\nsprings, and the water of the wells is brackish. Jamestown stood along\r\nthe river bank about three-quarters of a mile, containing a church, and\r\nsome sixteen or eighteen well-built brick houses. The population of this\r\ndiminutive metropolis consisted of about a dozen families, (for all of\r\nthe houses were not inhabited,) \"getting their living by keeping of\r\nordinaries at extraordinary rates.\"\r\n\r\nBacon, after completing his works, in which he was much assisted by the\r\nconspicuous white aprons of the ladies, now mounted a small battery of\r\ntwo or three cannon, according to some commanding the shipping, but not\r\nthe town, according to others commanding both. Sir William Berkley had\r\nthree great guns planted at the distance of about one hundred and fifty\r\npaces. But such was the cowardice of his motley crowd of followers, the\r\nbulk of them mere spoilsmen, \"rogues and royalists,\" intent only on the\r\nplunder of forfeited estates promised them by \"his honor,\" that although\r\nsuperior to Bacon's force in time, place, and numbers, yet out of six\r\nhundred of them, only twenty gentlemen were found willing to stand by\r\nhim. So great was their fear, that in two or three days after the sortie\r\nthey embarked in the night with all the town people and their goods, and\r\nleaving the guns spiked, weighing anchor secretly, and dropping silently\r\ndown the river; retreating from a force inferior in number, and which,\r\nduring a rainy week of the sickliest season, had been exposed, lying in\r\nopen trenches, to far more hardship and privation than themselves. At\r\nthe dawn of the following day, Bacon entered, where he found empty\r\nhouses, a few horses, two or three cellars of wine, a small quantity of\r\nIndian-corn, \"and many tanned hides.\" It being determined that it should\r\nbe burned, so that the \"rogues should harbor there no more,\" Lawrence\r\nand Drummond, who owned two of the best houses, set fire to them in the\r\nevening with their own hands, and the soldiers, following their example,\r\nlaid in ashes Jamestown, including the church, the first brick one\r\nerected in the colony. Sir William Berkley and his people beheld the\r\nflames of the conflagration from the vessels riding at anchor, about\r\ntwenty miles below.\r\n\r\nBacon now marched to York River, and crossed at Tindall's (Gloucester)\r\nPoint, in order to encounter Colonel Brent, who was marching against him\r\nfrom the Potomac, with twelve hundred men. But the greater part of his\r\nmen, hearing of Bacon's success, deserting their colors declared for\r\nhim, \"resolving with the Persians, to go and worship the rising\r\nsun.\"[310:A] Bacon, making his headquarters at Colonel Warmer's, called\r\na convention in Gloucester, and administered the oath to the people of\r\nthat county, and began to plan another expedition against the Indians,\r\nor, as some report, against Accomac, when he fell sick of a dysentery\r\nbrought on by exposure. Retiring to the house of a Dr. Pate, and,\r\nlingering for some weeks, he died. Some of the loyalists afterwards\r\nreported that he died of a loathsome disease, and by a visitation of\r\nGod; which is disproven by T. M.'s Account, by that published in the\r\nVirginia Gazette, and by the Report of the King's Commissioners. Some of\r\nBacon's friends suspected that he was taken off by poison; but of this\r\nthere is no proof. In his last hours he requested the assistance of a\r\nminister named Wading, whom he had arrested not long before for his\r\nopposition to the taking of the oath in Gloucester, telling him that \"it\r\nwas his place to preach in the church, and not in the camp.\"\r\n\r\nThe place of Bacon's interment has never been discovered, it having been\r\nconcealed by his friends, lest his remains should be insulted by the\r\nvindictive Berkley, in whom old age appears not to have mitigated the\r\nfury of the passions. According to one tradition, in order to screen\r\nBacon's body from indignity, stones were laid on his coffin by his\r\nfriend Lawrence, as was supposed; according to others, it was\r\nconjectured that his body had been buried in the bosom of the majestic\r\nYork where the winds and the waves might still repeat his requiem:--\r\n\r\n     \"While none shall dare his obsequies to sing\r\n      In deserved measures; until time shall bring\r\n      Truth crowned with freedom, and from danger free,\r\n      To sound his praises to posterity.\"[311:A]\r\n\r\nLord Chatham, in his letters addressed to his nephew, the Earl of\r\nCamelford, advises him to read \"Nathaniel Bacon's Historical and\r\nPolitical Observations, which is, without exception, the best and most\r\ninstructive book we have on matters of that kind.\" This book, though at\r\npresent little known, formerly enjoyed a high reputation. It is written\r\nwith a very evident bias to the principles of the parliamentary party,\r\nto which Bacon adhered. It was published in 1647, again in 1651,\r\nsecretly reprinted in 1672, and again in 1682, for which edition the\r\npublisher was indicted and outlawed. The author was probably related to\r\nthe great Lord Bacon.[312:A] Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., came over to\r\nVirginia about the year 1672, when the third edition of that work was\r\nsecretly reprinted in England. In the quarto edition the author,\r\nNathaniel Bacon, is said to have been of Gray's Inn. It was published\r\nduring the Protectorate. He appears probably to have been, in Oliver\r\nCromwell's time, recorder of the borough of Ipswich, and to have lived\r\nat Freston, near Saxmundham, in Suffolk. His son, Nathaniel Bacon, Jr.,\r\nstyled the Rebel, married, against the consent of his father, who\r\nviolently exhibited his disapprobation, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of\r\nSir Edward Duke, and sister to Sir John Duke, of Benhill-lodge, near\r\nSaxmundham. Ray, who set out upon his travels into foreign parts in\r\n1663, says he was accompanied by Mr. Willoughby, Sir Philip Skippon, and\r\nMr. Nathaniel Bacon, \"a hopeful young gentleman.\"[312:B] He owned lands\r\nin England of the yearly value of one hundred and fifty pounds; and\r\nafter his marriage, being straitened for money, he applied to Sir Robert\r\nJason for assistance, conveyed the lands to him for twelve hundred\r\npounds sterling,[312:C] and removed with his wife to Virginia. Dying, he\r\nleft Elizabeth a widow, and children. She afterwards married in Virginia\r\nThomas Jervis, a merchant, who lived in Elizabeth City County, on the\r\nwest side of Hampton River,[312:D] and upon his death she became his\r\nexecutrix, and in 1684 claimed her jointure out of the lands sold to\r\nJason, under a settlement thereof made by Bacon on his marriage, in\r\nconsideration of her portion.[312:E] Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., was cousin to\r\nThomas, Lord Culpepper,[312:F] subsequently governor of Virginia. Jervis\r\nappears to have been owner of a vessel, the \"Betty,\" (so called after\r\nhis wife,) in which Culpepper sailed from Virginia for Boston, August\r\n10th, 1680. Elizabeth, relict of Jervis, married third a Mr. Mole. There\r\nare, at the present day, persons in Virginia of the name of Bacon, who\r\nclaim to be lineal descendants of the rebel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[309:A] Mrs. Cotton's Letter.\r\n\r\n[309:B] Letter in Chalmers' Annals, 349.\r\n\r\n[309:C] Narrative of Indian and Civil Wars.\r\n\r\n[310:A] Mrs. Cotton's Letter.\r\n\r\n[311:A] Extract from verses on his death, attributed to a servant, or\r\nattendant, who was with him in his last moments, and entitled \"Bacon's\r\nEpitaph made by his Man.\" (_Force's Hist.

Ingram, supported by George Wakelet, or Walklett,\r\nhis major-general, who was very young, Langston, Richard Lawrence, and\r\ntheir adherents, took possession of West Point, at the head of York\r\nRiver, fortified it, and made it their place of arms. West Point, or\r\nWest's Point, so called from the family name of Lord Delaware, was at\r\none time known as \"De la War,\" and is so laid down on John Henry's Map,\r\ndated 1770. There is still extant there[313:A] a ruinous house of\r\nstone-marl, which was probably occupied by Ingram and his confederates.\r\nA bake-oven serves to strengthen the conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Berkley heard of Bacon's death, he sent over Robert Beverley,\r\nwith a party, in a sloop to York River, where they captured Colonel\r\nHansford and some twenty soldiers, at the house where Colonel Reade had\r\nlived, which appears to have been at or near where Yorktown now stands.\r\nHansford was taken to Accomac, tried, and condemned to be hanged, and\r\nwas the first native of Virginia that perished in that ignominious form,\r\nand in America the first martyr that fell in defending the rights of the\r\npeople. He was described by Sir William Berkley as \"one Hansford, a\r\nvaliant stout man, and a most resolved rebel.\" When he came to the place\r\nof execution, distant about a mile from the place of his confinement,\r\nhe appeared well resolved to bear his fate, complaining only of the\r\nmanner of his death. Neither during his trial before the court-martial,\r\nnor afterwards, did he supplicate any favor, save that \"he might be shot\r\nlike a soldier, and not hanged like a dog;\" but he was told that he was\r\ncondemned not as a soldier, but as a rebel. During the short respite\r\nallowed him after his sentence, he professed repentance and contrition\r\nfor all the sins of his past life, but refused to acknowledge what was\r\ncharged against him as rebellion, to be one of them; desiring the people\r\npresent to take notice that \"he died a loyal subject and lover of his\r\ncountry, and that he had never taken up arms but for the destruction of\r\nthe Indians, who had murdered so many Christians.\" His execution took\r\nplace on the 13th of November, 1676.[314:A]\r\n\r\nCaptain Wilford, Captain Farloe, and several others of less note, were\r\nput to death in Accomac. Wilford, younger son of a knight who had lost\r\nhis estate and life in defence of Charles the First, had taken refuge in\r\nVirginia, where he became an Indian interpreter, in which capacity he\r\nwas very serviceable to Bacon. Farloe had been made an officer by Bacon,\r\nupon the recommendation of Sir William Berkley, or some of the council.\r\nHe was a mathematical scholar, and of a peaceable disposition, and his\r\nuntimely end excited much commiseration. Major Cheesman died in prison,\r\nprobably from ill usage. His wife took to herself the entire blame for\r\nhis having joined Bacon, and on her bended knees implored Sir William\r\nBerkley to put her to death in his stead. The governor answered by\r\napplying to her an epithet of infamy. Several other prisoners came to\r\ntheir death in prison in the same way with Cheesman.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley now repaired to York River with four merchant-ships,\r\ntwo or three sloops, and one hundred and fifty men.[314:B] According to\r\nanother account,[314:C] he sent Colonel Ludwell with part of his forces\r\nto York River, while he himself with the rest repaired to Jamestown; but\r\nthis appears to be erroneous. Sir William proclaimed a general pardon,\r\nexcepting certain persons named, especially Lawrence and Drummond.\r\nGreenspring, the governor's residence, still held out, being garrisoned\r\nwith a hundred men under a captain Drew, previously a miller, the\r\napproaches barricaded, and three pieces of cannon planted. A party of\r\none hundred and twenty, dispatched by the governor to surprise at night\r\na guard of about thirty men and boys, under Major Whaley, at Colonel\r\nBacon's house on Queen's Creek, were defeated, with the loss of their\r\ncommander, named Farrel. Colonel Bacon and Colonel Ludwell were present\r\nat this affair. Major Lawrence Smith, with six hundred Gloucester men,\r\nwas likewise defeated by Ingram at Colonel Pate's house, Smith saving\r\nhimself by flight, and his men being all made prisoners. The officer\r\nnext in command under Smith was a minister. Captain Couset with a party\r\nbeing sent against Raines, who headed the insurgents on the south side\r\nof James River, Raines was killed, and his men captured.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ingram, Wakelet, and their companions in arms, foraged with\r\nimpunity on the estates of the loyalists, and bade defiance to the aged\r\ngovernor. They defended themselves against the assaults of Ludwell and\r\nothers with such resolution and gallantry, that Berkley, fatigued and\r\nexhausted, at length sent, by Captain Grantham, a complaisant letter to\r\nWakelet--or, as some say, to Ingram--offering an amnesty, on condition\r\nof surrender. This was agreed to, and in reward for his submission,\r\nBerkley presented to Wakelet all the Indian plunder deposited at West\r\nPoint. Greenspring was also surrendered by Drew upon terms offered by\r\nSir William Berkley. A court-martial was held on board of a vessel in\r\nYork River, January the 11th, 1676-7.[315:A] Four of the insurgents were\r\ncondemned by this court: one of them, by name Young, had, according to\r\nSir William Berkley, held a commission under General Monk long before he\r\ndeclared for the king; another, a carpenter, who had formerly been a\r\nservant of the governor, but had been made a colonel in Bacon's army;\r\none, Hall, was a clerk of a county court, but, by his writings, \"more\r\nuseful to the rebels than forty armed men.\"\r\n\r\nWhen West Point was surrendered, Lawrence and Drummond were at the\r\nBrick-house in New Kent, on the opposite side of the river. On the\r\nnineteenth day of January, Drummond was taken in the Chickahominy Swamp,\r\nhalf famished, and on the following day was brought in a prisoner to Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley, who was then on board of a vessel at Colonel Bacon's,\r\non Queen's Creek. The governor, who, through personal hostility, had\r\nvowed that Drummond should not live an hour after he fell into his\r\npower, upon hearing of his arrival, immediately went on shore and\r\nsaluted him with a courtly bow, saying, \"Mr. Drummond, you are very\r\n_un_welcome; I am more glad to see you than any man in Virginia. Mr.\r\nDrummond, you shall be hanged in half an hour.\" He replied, \"What your\r\nhonor pleases.\" A court-martial was immediately held, in time of peace,\r\nat the house of James Bray, Esq., whither the prisoner was conveyed in\r\nirons. He was stripped; and a ring--a pledge of domestic affection--was\r\ntorn from his finger before his conviction; he was condemned without any\r\ncharge being alleged, and although he had never borne arms; and he was\r\nnot permitted to defend himself. Condemned at one o'clock, he was\r\nhurried away to execution on a gibbet at four o'clock, at Middle\r\nPlantation, with one John Baptista, \"a common Frenchman, that had been\r\nvery bloody.\" Drummond was a sedate Scotch gentleman, who had been\r\ngovernor of the infant colony of North Carolina, of estimable character,\r\nunsullied integrity, and signal ability. He had rendered himself\r\nextremely obnoxious to the governor's hatred by the lively concern which\r\nhe had always evinced in the public grievances. Sir William Berkley\r\nmentions him as \"one Drummond, a Scotchman, that we all suppose was the\r\noriginal cause of the whole rebellion.\" When afterwards the petition of\r\nhis widow, Sarah Drummond, depicting the cruel treatment of her husband,\r\nwas read in the king's council in England, the lord chancellor, Finch,\r\nsaid: \"I know not whether it be lawful to wish a person alive, otherwise\r\nI could wish Sir William Berkley so, to see what could be answered to\r\nsuch barbarity; but he has answered it before this.\"[317:A]\r\n\r\nMrs. Afra Behn celebrated Bacon's Rebellion in a tragi-comedy, entitled\r\n\"The Widow Ranter, or the History of Bacon in Virginia.\" Dryden honored\r\nit with a prologue. The play failed on the stage, and was published in\r\n1690; there is a copy of it in the British Museum.[317:B] It sets\r\nhistorical truth at defiance, and is replete with coarse humor and\r\nindelicate wit. It is probable that Sarah Drummond may have been\r\nintended by \"The Widow Ranter.\" It appears that one or two expressions\r\nin the Declaration of Independence occur in this old play.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of January, 1677, six other insurgents were condemned to\r\ndeath at Greenspring, and executed. Henry West was banished for seven\r\nyears, and his estate confiscated, save five pounds allowed him to pay\r\nhis passage. William West and John Turner, sentenced to death at the\r\nsame time, escaped from prison. William Rookings, likewise sentenced,\r\ndied in prison. Richard Lawrence, with four companions, disappeared\r\nfrom the frontier, proceeding on horseback and armed, through a deep\r\nsnow, preferring to perish in the wilderness rather than to share\r\nDrummond's fate. Lawrence was educated at Oxford, and for wit, learning,\r\nand sobriety, was equalled by few there. He had been one of the\r\ncommissioners for adjusting the boundary line between Maryland and\r\nVirginia in 1663. He had been defrauded of a handsome estate by\r\nBerkley's corrupt partiality in behalf of a favorite. The rebellion, as\r\nit was called, was by most people mainly attributed to Lawrence; and it\r\nis said that he had before thrown out intimations that he hoped to find\r\nmeans by which he not only should be able to repair his own losses, but\r\nalso see the country relieved from the governor's \"avarice and French\r\ndespotic modes.\" Lawrence had married a rich widow, who kept a large\r\nhouse of entertainment at Jamestown, which gave him an extensive\r\ninfluence. Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., probably had lodged at his house when\r\nsearch was made for him on the morning of his escape. The author of T.\r\nM.'s Account says: \"But Mr. Bacon was too young, too much a stranger\r\nthere, and of a disposition too precipitate, to manage things to that\r\nlength those were carried, had not thoughtful Mr. Lawrence been at the\r\nbottom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[313:A] 1847.\r\n\r\n[314:A] Ingram's Proceedings, 33; Force's Hist.

Sir William Berkley held an interview with them at Kiquotan,\r\non board of the Bristol; and these three were associated in a commission\r\nto investigate the causes of the late commotions and to restore order.\r\nThey were instructed to offer a reward of three hundred pounds to any\r\none who should arrest Bacon, who was to be taken by \"all ways of force,\r\nor design.\" And the other colonies were commanded by the king not to aid\r\nor conceal him; and it was ordered, in case of his capture, that he\r\nshould be brought to trial here; or, if his popularity should render it\r\nexpedient, be sent to England for trial and punishment. They were\r\nauthorized to pardon all who would duly take the oath of obedience, and\r\ngive security for their good behavior. Freedom was to be offered to\r\nservants and slaves who would aid in suppressing the revolt.[319:A]\r\nThe same measure had been before adopted by the Long Parliament, and\r\nwas resorted to a century afterwards by Governor Dunmore. It is\r\nthe phenomenon of historical pre-existence. The general court and\r\nthe assembly having now met, several more of Bacon's adherents\r\nwere convicted by a civil tribunal held at Greenspring, and put to\r\ndeath--most of them men of competent fortune and respectable character.\r\nAmong them was Giles Bland, whose friends in England, it was reported,\r\nhad procured his pardon to be sent over with the fleet; but if so, it\r\navailed him nothing. It was indeed whispered that he was executed under\r\nprivate orders brought from England, the Duke of York having declared,\r\nwith an oath, that \"Bacon and Bland shall die.\" Bland was convicted\r\nMarch eighth, and executed on the fifteenth, at Bacon's Trench, near\r\nJamestown, with another prisoner, Robert Jones. Three others were put to\r\ndeath on another day at the same place. Anthony Arnold was hung on the\r\nfifteenth of March, in chains, at West Point. Two others suffered\r\ncapitally on the same day, but at what place does not appear, probably\r\nin their own counties.[320:A]\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, Secretary Ludwell wrote to Coventry, the English\r\nsecretary of state, \"that the grounds of this rebellion have not\r\nproceeded from any real fault in the government, but rather from the\r\nlewd disposition of desperate fortunes lately sprung up among them,\r\nwhich easily seduced the willing minds of the people from their\r\nallegiance, in the vain hopes of taking the country wholly out of his\r\nmajesty's hands into their own. Bacon never intended more by the\r\nprosecution of the Indian war than as a covert to his villanies.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, who assisted in the trial of these prisoners, now\r\nproceeded to inquire into the causes of the late distractions; they sat\r\nat Swan's Point. The insurgents, who comprised the great body of the\r\npeople of Virginia, had found powerful friends among the people of\r\nEngland, and in parliament; and the commissioners discountenanced the\r\nexcesses of Sir William Berkley, and the loyalists, and invited the\r\nplanters in every quarter to bring in their grievances without fear.\r\nJeffreys, one of the commissioners, was about to succeed Governor\r\nBerkley. In their zeal for investigation the commissioners seized the\r\njournals of the assembly; and the burgesses in October, 1677, demanded\r\nsatisfaction for this indignity, declaring that such a seizure could not\r\nhave been authorized even by an order under the great seal, because\r\n\"they found that such a power had never been exercised by the king of\r\nEngland\"--an explicit declaration of the legislative independence of the\r\ncolony. Their language was stigmatized by Charles the Second as\r\nseditious.[321:A]\r\n\r\nThe number of persons executed was twenty-three,[321:B] of whom twelve\r\nwere condemned by court-martial. The jails were crowded with prisoners,\r\nand in the general consternation many of the inhabitants were preparing\r\nto leave the country. During eight months Virginia had suffered civil\r\nwar, devastation, executions, and the loss of one hundred thousand\r\npounds,--so violent was the effort of nature to throw off the malady of\r\ndespotism and misrule. Charles the Second, in October, issued two\r\nproclamations, authorizing Berkley to pardon all except Nathaniel Bacon,\r\nJr.; and afterwards another, declaring Sir William's of February, 1677,\r\nnot conformable to his instructions, in excepting others besides Bacon\r\nfrom pardon, and abrogating it. Yet the king's commissioners assisted in\r\nthe condemnation of several of the prisoners. An act of pardon, under\r\nthe great seal, brought over by Lord Culpepper, was afterwards\r\nunanimously passed by the assembly in June, 1680, and several persons\r\nare excepted in it who were included in Sir William's \"bloody bill\" in\r\nFebruary, 1677.[321:C]\r\n\r\nThe people complained to the commissioners of the illegal seizing of\r\ntheir estates by the governor and his royalist supporters; and of their\r\nbeing imprisoned after submitting themselves upon the governor's\r\nproclamation of pardon and indemnity; and of being compelled to pay\r\nheavy fines and compositions by threats of being brought to trial, which\r\nwas in every instance tantamount to conviction. Berkley and some of the\r\nroyalists that sat on the trial of the prisoners, were forward in\r\nimpeaching, accusing, and reviling them--accusing and condemning, both\r\nat once. Sir William Berkley caused Drummond's small plantation to be\r\nseized upon and given to himself by his council, removing and embezzling\r\nthe personal property, and thus compelling his widow, with her children,\r\nto fly from her home, and wander in the wilderness and woods until they\r\nwere well-nigh reduced to starvation, when relieved by the arrival of\r\nthe commissioners. At length the assembly, in an address to the\r\ngovernor, deprecated any further sanguinary punishments, and he was\r\nprevailed upon, reluctantly, to desist. All the acts of the assembly of\r\nJune, 1676, called \"Bacon's Laws,\" were repealed, as well by the order\r\nand proclamation of King Charles, as also by act of the assembly held at\r\nGreenspring, in February, 1677.[322:A]\r\n\r\nThe assembly granted indemnity and pardon for all acts committed since\r\nthe 1st of April, 1676, excepting Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., and about fifty\r\nothers, including certain persons deceased, executed, escaped, and\r\nbanished. The principal persons excepted were Cheesman, Hunt, Hansford,\r\nWilford, Carver, Drummond, Crewes, Farloe, Hall, William and Henry West,\r\nLawrence, Bland, Whaley, Arnold, Ingram, Wakelet, Scarburgh, and Sarah,\r\nwife of Thomas Grindon. Twenty were attainted of high treason, and their\r\nestates confiscated. The provisoes of the act virtually left the whole\r\npower of punishment still in the hands of the governor and council.\r\nMinor punishments were inflicted on others; some were compelled to sue\r\nfor pardon on their knees, with a rope about the neck; others fined,\r\ndisfranchised, or banished. These penalties did not meet with the\r\napprobation of the people, and were in several instances evaded by the\r\nconnivance of the courts. John Bagwell and Thomas Gordon, adjudged to\r\nappear at Rappahannock Court with halters about their necks, were\r\nallowed to appear with \"small tape;\" in the same county William Potts\r\nwore \"a Manchester binding,\" instead of a halter.\r\n\r\nThe assembly, in accordance with one of Bacon's laws, declared Indian\r\nprisoners slaves, and their property lawful prize. An order was made for\r\nbuilding a new state-house at Tindall's (Gloucester) Point, on the north\r\nside of York River, but it was never carried into effect. Many of the\r\nacts of this session are almost exact copies of \"Bacon's Laws,\" the\r\ntitles only being altered--a conclusive proof of the abuses and\r\nusurpations of those in power, and of the merits of acts passed by those\r\nstigmatized and punished as rebels and traitors. Such likewise was the\r\nconduct of the British Parliament in relation to the legislation of the\r\nCommonwealth of England. The fourth of May was appointed a fast-day, and\r\nAugust the twenty-second a day of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley, worn down with agitations which his age was unequal\r\nto, and in feeble health, being recalled by the king, ceased to be\r\ngovernor on the 27th of April, 1677, and returned in the fleet to\r\nLondon, leaving Colonel Herbert Jeffreys in his place, who was sworn\r\ninto office on the same day. His commission was dated November the 11th,\r\n1676--the twenty-eighth year of Charles the Second. In July, 1675, Lord\r\nCulpepper had been appointed governor-in-chief of Virginia, but he did\r\nnot arrive till the beginning of 1680; had he come over when first\r\nappointed, it might have prevented Bacon's Rebellion.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley died on the thirteenth of July, 1677, of a broken\r\nheart, as some relate,[323:A] without ever seeing the king, having been\r\nconfined to his chamber from the day of his arrival. According to\r\nothers, King Charles expressed his approbation of his conduct, and the\r\nkindest regard for him, and made frequent inquiry respecting his\r\nhealth.[323:B] Others again, on the contrary, report that the king said\r\nof him: \"That old fool has hanged more men in that naked country than I\r\nhave done for the murder of my father.\"[323:C] Sir William Berkley was a\r\nnative of London, and educated at Merton College, Oxford, of which he\r\nwas afterwards a fellow, and in 1629 was made Master of Arts. He made\r\nthe tour of Europe in the year 1630. He held the place of governor of\r\nVirginia from 1639 to 1651, and from 1659 to 1677--a period of thirty\r\nyears, a term equalled by no other governor of the colony. He published\r\na tragi-comedy, \"The Lost Lady,\" in 1639, the year in which he came\r\nfirst to Virginia. Pepys, in his Diary, mentions seeing it acted. Sir\r\nWilliam published also, in 1663, \"A Discourse and View of Virginia.\" He\r\nwas buried at Twickenham, since illustrated by the genius of Pope. Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley left no children. By a will, dated May the 2d, 1676, he\r\nbequeathed his estate to his widow. He declares himself to have been\r\nunder no obligation whatever to any of his kindred except his sister,\r\nMrs. Jane Davies, (of whom he appears to have been fond,) and his\r\nbrother, Lord Berkley. Sir William married the widow of Samuel Stephens,\r\nof Warwick County, Virginia. She, after Sir William's death, was sued by\r\nWilliam Drummond's widow for trespass, in taking from her land a\r\nquantity of corn, and in spite of a strenuous defence, a verdict was\r\nfound against the defendant. In 1680 she intermarried with Colonel\r\nPhilip Ludwell, of Rich Neck, but still retained the title of \"Dame (or\r\nLady) Frances Berkley.\"\r\n\r\nSamuel Stephens was the son of Dame Elizabeth Harvey (widow of Sir John\r\nHarvey) by a former marriage.[324:A]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear when Colonel William Clayborne, first of the name in\r\nVirginia, died, or where he was buried, but probably in the County of\r\nNew Kent. There is a novel entitled \"Clayborne the Rebel.\"[324:B]\r\n\r\nColonel William Clayborne, Jr., eldest son of the above mentioned, was\r\nprobably the one appointed (1676) to command a fort at Indiantown\r\nLanding, in New Kent, together with Major Lyddal,[324:C] as the father\r\nwas probably then too old for that post. Some suppose also that it was\r\nthe son that sat on the trial of the rebels. A certificate of the valor\r\nof William Clayborne, Jr., is recorded in King William County\r\nCourt-house, signed by Sir William Berkley, dated in March, 1677,\r\nattested by Nathaniel Bacon, Sir Philip Ludwell, Ralph Wormley, and\r\nRichard Lee.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Thomas Clayborne, only brother of William Clayborne,\r\nJr., lies buried not far from West Point, in King William County. He was\r\nkilled by an Indian arrow which wounded him in the foot. It appears that\r\neach of the sons of Secretary Clayborne had a son named Thomas. Colonel\r\nThomas Clayborne, son of Captain Thomas Clayborne, is said to have\r\nmarried three times, and to have been father of twenty-seven children.\r\nOne of his daughters married a General Phillips of the British army, and\r\nis said to have been the mother of Colonel Ralph Phillips, of the\r\nBritish army, who fell at Waterloo, and of the distinguished Irish\r\norator who died recently. Another son, William Clayborne, married a Miss\r\nLeigh, of Virginia, and was father of William Charles Cole Clayborne,\r\nGovernor of Louisiana, and of General Ferdinand Leigh Clayborne, late of\r\nMississippi. He assisted General Jackson in planning the battle of New\r\nOrleans. The widow of this Governor Clayborne married John R. Grymes,\r\nEsq., the eminent New Orleans lawyer. And a daughter of the governor\r\nmarried John H. B. Latrobe, Esq., of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nColonel Augustine Clayborne, son of Colonel Thomas Clayborne, was\r\nappointed clerk of Sussex County Court in the year 1754, by William\r\nAdair, secretary of the colony. His son, Buller Clayborne, was\r\naid-de-camp to General Lincoln, and is said to have received a wound\r\nwhile interposing himself between the general and a party of British\r\nsoldiers. Mary Herbert, a sister of Buller Clayborne, married an uncle\r\nof General William Henry Harrison. Herbert Clayborne, eldest son of\r\nColonel Augustine Clayborne, married Mary, daughter of Buller Herbert,\r\nof Puddledock, near Petersburg. Puddledock is the name of a street in\r\nLondon. Herbert Augustine Clayborne was second son of Herbert Clayborne,\r\nof Elson Green, King William County, and Mary Burnet, eldest daughter of\r\nWilliam Burnet Browne, of Elson Green, and before of Salem,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable William Browne, of Massachusetts, married Mary Burnet,\r\ndaughter of William Burnet, (Governor of New York and of Massachusetts,)\r\nand Mary, daughter of Dean Stanhope, of Canterbury. William Burnet was\r\neldest son of Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, and Mrs. Mary Scott,\r\nhis second wife. Thus it appears that Herbert Clayborne married a\r\ndescendant of Bishop Burnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[319:A] Chalmers' Annals, 336.\r\n\r\n[320:A] Burk, ii. 255.\r\n\r\n[321:A] Chalmers' Revolt, i. 163, and Annals, 337.\r\n\r\n[321:B] Hening, ii. 370.\r\n\r\n[321:C] Hening, ii. 366, 428, 458.\r\n\r\n[322:A] Hening, ii. 365.\r\n\r\n[323:A] Chalmers' Introduction, i. 164.\r\n\r\n[323:B] Beverley, B. i. 79.\r\n\r\n[323:C] T.

By the report of the committee for plantations, adopted by\r\nthe king in council, and twice ordered to be passed into a new charter\r\nunder the great seal, it was provided, \"that no imposition or taxes\r\nshall be laid or imposed upon the inhabitants and proprietors there, but\r\nby the common consent of the governor, council, and burgesses, as hath\r\nbeen heretofore used,\" reserving, however, to parliament the right to\r\nlay duties upon commodities shipped from the colony. The news of the\r\nrebellion frustrated this scheme; the promised charter slept in the\r\nHamper[326:A] office; and the one actually sent afterwards was meagre\r\nand unsatisfactory. Colonel Jeffreys, successor to Berkley, effected a\r\ntreaty of peace with the Indians, each town agreeing to pay three arrows\r\nfor their land, and twenty beaver skins for protection, every year. He\r\nconvened an assembly at the house of Captain Otho Thorpe, at Middle\r\nPlantation, in October, 1677, being the twenty-ninth year of Charles the\r\nSecond. William Traverse was speaker, and Robert Beverley clerk. The\r\nsession lasted for one month. According to instructions given to Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley, dated in November, 1676, the governor was no longer\r\nobliged to call an assembly yearly, but only once in two years, and the\r\nsession was limited to fourteen days, unless the governor should see\r\ngood cause to continue it beyond that time; and the members of the\r\nassembly were to be elected only by freeholders. During this session\r\nregulations were adopted for the Indian trade, and fairs appointed for\r\nthe sale of Indian commodities; but the natives being suspicious of\r\ninnovations, these provisions soon became obsolete.\r\n\r\nIn 1677 Colonel Nathaniel Bacon, Sr., by a warrant from the treasury in\r\nEngland, was appointed auditor of the public accounts. At this time\r\nColonel Norwood was treasurer, but the governor and council, from\r\nmotives of economy, united his office with that of auditor.\r\n\r\nIt has before been mentioned that the king, by proclamation in 1677,\r\nrevoked and abrogated Sir William Berkley's proclamation of February of\r\nthe same year, as containing \"an exception and exclusion from pardon of\r\ndivers and sundry persons in his said proclamation named, for which he\r\nhath no ground or authority from our foresaid proclamation, the same\r\nbeing free and without exception of any person besides the said\r\nNathaniel Bacon, who should submit themselves according to the tenor of\r\nour said proclamation.\"[327:A]\r\n\r\nThis appears to be unjust to the governor; for the words of the king's\r\nproclamation of October are: \"And we do by these presents give and grant\r\nfull power and authority to you, our said governor, for us and in our\r\nname to pardon, release, and forgive unto all such our subjects (other\r\nthan the said Nathaniel Bacon) as you shall think fit and convenient for\r\nour service, all treasons, felonies,\" etc., evidently investing the\r\ngovernor with discretionary powers. The capitulation agreed upon with\r\nIngram and Walklet, at West Point, appears to have been violated by\r\nGovernor Berkley and the assembly. Colonel Philip Ludwell, alleging that\r\nhe had suffered loss by Walklet's incursions, sued him in New Kent\r\nfor damages. The defendant appealing to Jeffreys, he granted him a\r\nprotection. Whereupon, Ludwell declared that \"the governor, Jeffreys,\r\nwas a worse rebel than Bacon, for he had broke the laws of the country,\r\nwhich Bacon never did; that he was perjured in delaying or preventing\r\nthe execution of the laws, contrary to his oath of governor; that he was\r\nnot worth a groat in England; and that if every pitiful little fellow\r\nwith a periwig that came in governor to this country had liberty to make\r\nthe laws, as this had done, his children, nor no man's else, could be\r\nsafe in the title or estate left them.\" Jeffreys having laid these\r\ncharges and criminations before the council, they submitted the case to\r\na jury who found Ludwell guilty. The matter was referred to the king in\r\ncouncil; and in the mean while the accused was compelled to give\r\nsecurity in the penalty of a thousand pounds, to abide the determination\r\nof the case, and five hundred for his good behavior to the governor.\r\n\r\nWestmoreland was the only county that declared that it had no grievances\r\nto complain of, and the sincerity of this declaration may well be\r\ndoubted. Accomac claimed as a reward for her loyalty an exemption from\r\ntaxation for a period of twenty years. A letter, bearing date December\r\nthe 27th, 1677, addressed by the king to Jeffreys, informed him that\r\nLord Culpepper had been appointed governor, but that while he (Jeffreys)\r\ncontinued to perform the duties of the office, he should be no loser,\r\nand stating the arrangement which had been made as to the payment of\r\ntheir salaries. Jeffreys dying in December, 1678, was succeeded by the\r\naged Sir Henry Chicheley, deputy governor, who entered upon the duties\r\non the thirteenth of that month, his commission being dated February\r\n28th, 1674.\r\n\r\nThomas, Lord Culpepper, Baron of Thorsway, had been appointed in July,\r\n1675, governor of Virginia for life--an able, but artful and covetous\r\nman.[328:A] He had been one of the commissioners for plantations some\r\nyears before. He was disposed to look upon his office as a sinecure, but\r\nbeing reproved in December, 1679, by the king for remaining so long in\r\nEngland, he came over to the colony in 1680, and was sworn into office\r\non the tenth of May. He found Virginia tranquil. He brought over several\r\nbills ready draughted in England to be passed by the assembly, it being\r\n\"intended to introduce here the modes of Ireland.\"[329:A] His lordship\r\nbeing invested with full powers of pardon, found it the more easy to\r\nobtain from the people whatever he asked. After procuring the enactment\r\nof several popular acts, including one of indemnity and oblivion, he\r\nmanaged to have the impost of two shillings on every hogshead of tobacco\r\nmade perpetual, and instead of being accounted for to the assembly, as\r\nformerly, to be disposed of as his majesty might think fit. Culpepper,\r\nnotwithstanding the impoverished condition of the colony, contrived to\r\nenlarge his salary from one thousand pounds to upwards of two thousand,\r\nbesides perquisites amounting to eight hundred more. After the\r\nrebellion, the governor was empowered to suspend a councillor from his\r\nplace. It was also ordered, that in case of the death or removal of the\r\ngovernor, the president, or oldest member of the council, with the\r\nassistance of five members of that body, should administer the\r\ngovernment until another appointment should be made by the crown.[329:B]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1680 Charles the Second granted to William Blathwayt the\r\nplace of surveyor and auditor-general of all his revenues in America,\r\nwith a salary of five hundred pounds to be paid out of the same,\r\nVirginia's share of the salary being one hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nIn August of this year, Lord Culpepper returned to England, by way of\r\nBoston, in the ship \"Betty,\" belonging to Jervis, who married the widow\r\nof Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., (a cousin of Culpepper,) Jervis being also a\r\npassenger. Elizabeth, or Betty, was the Christian name of Bacon's widow.\r\nThe vessel having run aground in the night, his lordship landed on the\r\nwild New England shore, one hundred and thirty miles from Boston, with\r\ntwo servants, each carrying a gun, and made his way twenty miles to\r\nSandwich, where he was furnished with horses and a guide, and so reached\r\nBoston, where the Betty arrived ten days thereafter. In a letter, dated\r\nSeptember the twentieth, addressed to his sister, he mentions that he\r\nhas with him, \"John Polyn, the cook, the page, the great footman, and\r\nthe little one that embroiders.\" The Betty conveyed soldiers, servants,\r\nplate, goods, and furniture. Culpepper was received at Boston by twelve\r\ncompanies of militia; and was well pleased with the place, \"finding no\r\ndifference between it and Old England, but only want of company.\"[330:A]\r\n\r\nVirginia now enjoyed repose, and large crops of tobacco were raised, and\r\nthe price again fell to a low ebb. The discontents of the planters were\r\naggravated by the act \"for cohabitation and encouragement of trade and\r\nmanufacture,\" restricting vessels to certain prescribed ports where the\r\ngovernment desired to establish towns.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1680 Charleston was founded, the metropolis of the infant\r\ncolony of South Carolina. By the grant of Pennsylvania, made by Charles\r\nthe Second to William Penn, dated in March, 1681, Virginia lost another\r\nlarge portion of her territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[326:A] Hening, ii. 531; Hamper, _i.e._ Hanaper.\r\n\r\n[327:A] The direction of this proclamation is as follows: \"To our trusty\r\nand well-beloved Herbert Jeffreys, Esq., Lieutenant-Governor, and the\r\ncouncil of our colony and plantation of Virginia in the West Indies.\"\r\n\r\n[328:A] Account of Va. in Mass.

The colonial revenue consisted--First, of parish\r\nlevies, \"commonly managed by sly cheating fellows, that combine to cheat\r\nthe public.\" Secondly, public levies raised by act of assembly, both\r\nderived from tithables or working hands, of which there were about\r\nfourteen thousand. The cost of collecting this part of the revenue was\r\nestimated at not less than twenty per centum. Thirdly, two shillings per\r\nhogshead on tobacco exported, which, together with some tonnage duties,\r\namounted to three thousand pounds a year. The county courts held three\r\nsessions in the year, an appeal lying to the governor and council, and\r\nfrom them, in actions of three hundred pounds sterling value, to his\r\nmajesty; in causes of less consequence, to the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical affairs of the colony were subject to the control\r\nof the governor, who granted probates of wills, and had the right\r\nof presentation to all livings, the ordinary value of which was\r\nsixty pounds per annum; but at that particular time, owing to the\r\nimpoverishment of the country and the low price of tobacco, not worth\r\nhalf that sum. The number of livings was seventy-six. Lord Culpepper\r\nadds: \"And the parishes paying the ministers themselves, have used to\r\nclaim the right of presentation, (or rather of not paying,) whether the\r\ngovernor will or not, which must not be allowed, and yet must be managed\r\nwith great caution.\" There was no fort in Virginia defensible against a\r\nEuropean enemy, nor any security for ships against a superior sea force.\r\nThere were perhaps fifteen thousand fighting men in the country.[332:A]\r\n\r\nHis lordship describes the north part of Carolina as \"the refuge of our\r\nrenegades, and till in better order, dangerous to us.\" Yet it is certain\r\nthat some of the early settlers of this part of North Carolina were of\r\nexemplary character, and were driven from Virginia by intolerance and\r\npersecution. According to his lordship, \"Maryland is now in a ferment,\r\nand not only troubled with our disease, poverty, but in a great danger\r\nof falling to pieces.\" The colony of Virginia was at peace with the\r\nIndians; but long experience had taught, in regard to that treacherous\r\nrace, that when there was the least suspicion then was there the\r\ngreatest danger. But the most ruinous evil that afflicted the colony was\r\nthe extreme low price of the sole commodity, tobacco. \"For the market is\r\noverstocked, and every crop overstocks it more. Our thriving is our\r\nundoing, and our buying of blacks hath extremely contributed thereto by\r\nmaking more tobacco.\"[332:B]\r\n\r\nEmancipated Indian or negro slaves were prohibited from buying Christian\r\nservants, but were allowed to buy those of their own nation. Negro\r\nchildren imported had their ages recorded by the court, and became\r\ntithable at the age of twelve years. In June, 1680, an act was passed\r\nfor preventing an insurrection of the negro slaves, and it was ordered\r\nthat it should be published twice a year at the county courts of the\r\nparish churches.[332:C] Negroes were not allowed to remain on another\r\nplantation more than four hours without leave of the owner or overseer.\r\n\r\nAfter \"his excellency,\" Lord Culpepper, went away from Virginia in\r\nAugust, 1680, leaving Sir Henry Chicheley deputy governor, tranquillity\r\nprevailed until the time for shipping tobacco in the following year,\r\nwhen the trade was greatly obstructed by the act for establishing towns,\r\nwhich required vessels to be laden at certain specified places. The act\r\nbeing found impracticable, was disobeyed, and much disturbance ensued.\r\nIn compliance with the petitions of several dissatisfied counties, an\r\nassembly was called together in April, 1682, by Sir Henry Chicheley,\r\nwithout the consent of the council. The session being occupied in\r\nagitating debates, the body was dissolved, and another summoned,\r\naccording to an order just received from the crown, to meet in November,\r\n1682, by which time Culpepper was commanded to return to Virginia. The\r\ndisaffected in the petitioning counties, Gloucester, New Kent, and\r\nMiddlesex, in May proceeded riotously to cut up the tobacco-plants in\r\nthe beds, especially the sweet-scented, which was produced nowhere else.\r\nTo put a stop to this outbreak, the deputy governor issued sundry\r\nproclamations.[333:A]\r\n\r\nLord Culpepper having arrived, the assembly met shortly afterwards. He\r\ndemanded of the council an account of their administration during his\r\nabsence, and it was rendered. In his address to the assembly, he\r\nenlarged upon the king's generous and undeserved concessions to the\r\ncolony; he announced the king's high displeasure at the declaration made\r\nby them that the seizing of their records by the king's commissioners\r\nwas an unwarrantable violation of their privileges, and, in the king's\r\nname, ordered the same to be expunged from the journal of the house, and\r\nproposed to them a bill asserting the right of the king and his officers\r\nto call for all their records and journals whenever they should think it\r\nnecessary for the public service.\r\n\r\nThe governor claiming authority to raise the value of the coin, the\r\nassembly warmly opposed it, as a dangerous encroachment on their\r\nconstitutional rights; and a bill was brought in for regulating the\r\nvalue of coins, which was interrupted by the governor, who claimed that\r\npower as belonging to the royal prerogative. He issued a proclamation,\r\nin 1683, raising the value of crowns, rix dollars, and pieces of eight,\r\nfrom five to six shillings, half pieces to three shillings, quarter\r\npieces to eighteen pence, and the New England coin to one shilling,\r\ndeclaring money at this rate a lawful tender, except for the duty of two\r\nshillings a hogshead on tobacco, the quit-rents, and other duties\r\npayable to his majesty, and for debts contracted for bills of exchange.\r\nHis own salary and the king's revenues were, in this way, in a period\r\nof distress, exempted from the operation of the act, a proceeding\r\ncharacteristic of the reign of Charles the Second, in which official\r\nenergy was mainly exhibited in measures of injustice and extortion.\r\n\r\nThe ringleaders in the plant cutting were arrested, and some of them\r\nhanged upon a charge of treason; and this, together with the enactment\r\nof a riot act, and making the offence high treason, put a stop to the\r\npractice.[334:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[332:A] The number of half-armed train-bands, in 1680, were 7268 foot\r\nand 1300 horse--total, 8568.--_Chalmers' Annals_, 357.\r\n\r\n[332:B] Chalmers' Annals, 355.\r\n\r\n[332:C] Hening, ii. 481, 492.\r\n\r\n[333:A] Hening, ii. 561.\r\n\r\n[334:A] Chalmers' Annals, 340; Hening, iii. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n1683-1688.\r\n\r\n     Persecution of Robert Beverley--Plots and Executions in\r\n     England--Culpepper returns to England--Spencer, President--\r\n     Culpepper is displaced--Succeeded by Effingham--Beverley,\r\n     found guilty, asks Pardon, and is released--Miscellaneous\r\n     Affairs--Death of Charles the Second--Succeeded by James the\r\n     Second--Beverley again Clerk--Duke of Monmouth beheaded--\r\n     Adherents of Monmouth sent Prisoners to Virginia--Instructions\r\n     respecting them--Death of Robert Beverley--Despotism of James\r\n     the Second--Servile Insurrection prevented--Virginia refuses\r\n     to contribute to the erection of Forts in New York--Commotions\r\n     in Virginia--Effingham's Corruption and Tyranny--He embarks\r\n     for England--Ludwell dispatched to lay Virginia's Grievances\r\n     before the Government--Abdication of James the Second.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE vengeance of the government fell heavily upon Major Robert Beverley,\r\nclerk of the house of burgesses, as the chief instigator of these\r\ndisturbances. He had incurred the displeasure of the governor and\r\ncouncil by refusing to deliver up to them copies of the legislative\r\njournals, without permission of the house. Beverley had rendered\r\nimportant services in suppressing Bacon's rebellion, and had won the\r\nspecial favor of Sir William Berkley; but as circumstances change, men\r\nchange with them, and now by a steady adherence to his duty to the\r\nassembly, he drew down upon his head unrelenting persecution. In the\r\nmonth of May, 1682, he was committed a close prisoner on board the ship\r\nDuke of York, lying in the Rappahannock.[335:A] Ralph Wormley, Matthew\r\nKemp, and Christopher Wormley, were directed to seize the records in\r\nBeverley's possession, and to break open doors if necessary. He\r\ncomplained, in a note addressed to the captain, and claimed the rights\r\nof a freeborn Englishman. He was transferred from the Duke of York to\r\nCaptain Jeffries, commander of the Concord, and a guard set over him. He\r\nwas next sent on board of Colonel Custis's sloop, to be taken to\r\nNorthampton. Escaping from the custody of the sheriff of York, the\r\nprisoner was retaken at his own house in Middlesex, and sent to\r\nNorthampton, on the Eastern Shore. Some months after, he applied for a\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_, which was refused; and in a short time, being\r\nagain found at large, he was remanded to Northampton. In January, 1683,\r\nnew charges were brought against him: First, that he had broken open\r\nletters addressed to the secretary's office; Secondly, that he had made\r\nup the journal, and inserted his majesty's letter therein,\r\nnotwithstanding it had first been presented at the time of the\r\nprorogation; Thirdly, that in 1682 he had refused copies of the journal\r\nto the governor and council, saying \"he might not do it without leave of\r\nhis masters.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1680, England was agitated and alarmed with the \"Popish\r\nplot;\" and the Earl of Stafford and divers others were executed on the\r\ninformation of Oates and other witnesses. In July, 1683, Lord Russell\r\nwas beheaded on a charge of treason, and others suffered the same fate\r\nas being implicated in what was styled the \"Protestant plot.\"\r\n\r\nCulpepper, after staying about a year in Virginia, returned to England,\r\nleaving his kinsman, secretary Nicholas Spencer, president. Thus, again,\r\nquitting the colony in violation of his orders, he was arrested\r\nimmediately on his arrival; and having received presents from the\r\nassembly, contrary to his instructions, a jury of Middlesex found that\r\nhe had forfeited his commission. This example having shown that he who\r\nacts under independent authority will seldom obey even reasonable\r\ncommands, no more governors were appointed for life.[336:A]\r\nBeverley[336:B] gives a different account: \"The next year, being 1684,\r\nupon the Lord Culpepper refusing to return, Francis, Lord Howard of\r\nEffingham, was sent over governor.\" But Chalmers, having access to the\r\nrecords of the English government, appears to be the better authority.\r\n\r\nLord Culpepper having it in view, as was said, to purchase the propriety\r\nof the Northern Neck, lying between the Rappahannock and the Potomac, in\r\norder to further his design, had fomented a dispute between the house of\r\nburgesses and the council; and the quarrel running nigh, his lordship\r\nprocured from the king instructions to abolish appeals from the general\r\ncourt to the assembly, and transfer them to the crown. However,\r\nCulpepper being a man of strong judgment, introduced some salutary\r\namendments to the laws. During his time, instead of fixed garrisons,\r\nrangers were employed in guarding the frontier. In October died\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Thomas Clayborne, (son of Colonel William Clayborne,)\r\nmortally wounded in an engagement with the Indians, which took place\r\nnear West Point, at the head of York River; he lies buried on the same\r\nspot, in compliance with his dying request. The son appears to have\r\ninherited the spirit of his father.\r\n\r\nLord Culpepper was succeeded by Francis, Lord Howard of Effingham, whose\r\nappointment was the last act of Charles the Second in relation to the\r\ncolony of Virginia. Lord Effingham was appointed in August, 1683, the\r\nthirty-fifth year of the king's reign, commissioned in September, and\r\narriving in Virginia during February, 1684, entered upon the duties of\r\nthe office in April. The assembly met on the following day. Acts were\r\npassed to prevent plant cutting, and preserve the peace; to supply the\r\ninhabitants with arms and ammunition; to repeal the act for\r\nencouragement of domestic manufactures; to provide for the better\r\ndefence of the colony; laying for the first time an impost on liquors\r\nimported from other English plantations; exempting such as were imported\r\nby Virginians for their own use, and in their own vessels. The\r\nburgesses, in behalf of the inhabitants of the Northern Neck, then\r\ncalled Potomac Neck, prayed the governor to secure them by patent in\r\ntheir titles to their lands, which had been invaded by Culpepper's\r\ncharter. The governor replied that he was expecting a favorable decision\r\non the matter from the king.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the name of Zach. Taylor, a surveyor, is mentioned, an\r\nancestor of General Zachary Taylor, some time President of the United\r\nStates.[337:A]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1684, Robert Beverley was found guilty of high misdemeanors,\r\nbut judgment being respited, and the prisoner asking pardon on his\r\nbended knees, was released, upon giving security for his good behavior.\r\nHis counsel was William Fitzhugh, of Stafford County, a lawyer of\r\nreputation, and a planter. Beverley was charged with having led the\r\npeople to believe that there would be a \"cessation\" of the tobacco crop\r\nin 1680, and such appears to have been the general impression in the\r\nsummer of that year.[338:A] The abject terms in which he now sued for\r\npardon form a singular contrast to his former constancy; and it is\r\ncurious to find the loyal Beverley, the strenuous partizan of Berkley,\r\nnow the victim of the tyranny which he had formerly defended with so\r\nmuch energy and success.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth day of May, of this year, Lord Baltimore was at\r\nJamestown on a visit to the governor, with a view of embarking there for\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOwing to the incursions of the Five Nations upon the frontiers of\r\nVirginia, it was deemed expedient to treat with them through the\r\ngovernor of New York; and for this purpose Lord Effingham, Governor of\r\nVirginia, leaving the administration in the hands of Colonel Bacon, of\r\nthe council, and accompanied by two councillors, sailed, June the\r\ntwenty-third, in the \"Quaker Ketch,\" to New York, and thence repaired to\r\nAlbany, in July. There he met Governor Dongan, of New York, the agent of\r\nMassachusetts, the magistrates of Albany, and the chiefs of the warlike\r\nMohawks, Oneidas, Onondagos, and Cayugas. The tomahawk was buried, the\r\nchain of friendship brightened, and the tree of peace planted. It was\r\nduring this year that the charter of Massachusetts was dissolved by a\r\nwrit of _quo warranto_. In the same year Talbot, a kinsman of the\r\nCalverts, and a member of the Maryland Council, killed, in a private\r\nrencontre, Rousby, the collector of the customs for that province; he\r\nwas tried in Virginia, and convicted, but subsequently pardoned by James\r\nthe Second.\r\n\r\nEvelyn[338:B] says: \"I can never forget the inexpressible luxury, and\r\nprofaneness, gaming, and all dissoluteness, and, as it were, total\r\nforgetfulness of God, (it being Sunday evening,) which this day\r\nse'nnight I was witness of, the king sitting and toying with his\r\nconcubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Mazarine, etc., a French boy\r\nsinging love-songs in that glorious gallery, while about twenty of the\r\ngreat courtiers, and other dissolute persons, were at basset round a\r\nlarge table, a bank of at least two thousand pounds in gold before them;\r\nupon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made reflections with\r\nastonishment. Six days after, all was in the dust.\"\r\n\r\nRochester, in his epigram, described Charles the Second as one\r\n\r\n     Who never said a foolish thing, and never did a wise one.\r\n\r\nBut it is much easier to discover the foolish things that he did, than\r\nthe wise things that he said. He was good-natured, free from\r\nvindictiveness, and had some appreciation of science.\r\n\r\nThe succession of James the Second to the throne was proclaimed in the\r\nAncient Dominion of Virginia \"with extraordinary joy.\" The enthusiasm of\r\ntheir loyalty was soon lowered, for the assembly meeting on the 1st day\r\nof October, 1685, and warmly resisting the negative power claimed by the\r\ngovernor, was prorogued on the same day to the second of November\r\nfollowing. Robert Beverley was again clerk. Strong resolutions,\r\ncomplaining of the governor's veto, were passed. After sitting for some\r\ntime this and other bills were presented to him for his signature, which\r\nhe refused to give, and appearing suddenly in the house prorogued it\r\nagain to the 20th of October, 1686.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Monmouth, an illegitimate son of Charles the Second, failing\r\nin a rash insurrection, was beheaded, July the fourteenth of this year.\r\n\r\nThe first parliament of the new reign laid an impost on tobacco; the\r\nplanters, in abject terms, supplicated James to suspend the duty imposed\r\non their staple; but he refused to comply. They also took measures to\r\nencourage domestic manufactures, which were disapproved of by the lords\r\nof the committee of colonies, as contrary to the acts of navigation.\r\nNevertheless, on the reception of the news of the defeat of the Duke of\r\nMonmouth, the Virginians sent a congratulatory address to the king.\r\n\r\nA number of the prisoners taken with Monmouth, and who had escaped the\r\ncruelty of Jeffreys, were sent to Virginia; and King James instructed\r\nEffingham on this occasion in the following letter:[340:A]\r\n\r\n     \"RIGHT TRUSTY AND WELL-BELOVED,--We greet you well. As it has\r\n     pleased God to deliver into our hands such of our rebellious\r\n     subjects as have taken up arms against us, for which\r\n     traitorous practices some of them have suffered death\r\n     according to law; so we have been graciously pleased to extend\r\n     our mercy to many others by ordering their transportation to\r\n     several parts of our dominions in America, where they are to\r\n     be kept as servants to the inhabitants of the same; and to the\r\n     end their punishment may in some measure answer their crimes,\r\n     we do think fit hereby to signify our pleasure unto you, our\r\n     governor and council of Virginia, that you take all necessary\r\n     care that such convicted persons as were guilty of the late\r\n     rebellion, that shall arrive within that our colony, whose\r\n     names are hereunto annexed,[340:B] be kept there, and continue\r\n     to serve their masters for the space of ten years at least.\r\n     And that they be not permitted in any manner to redeem\r\n     themselves by money or otherwise until that term be fully\r\n     expired. And for the better effecting hereof, you are to frame\r\n     and propose a bill to the assembly of that our colony, with\r\n     such provisions and clauses as shall be requisite for this\r\n     purpose, to which you, our governor, are to give your assent,\r\n     and to transmit the same unto us for our royal confirmation.\r\n     Wherein expecting a ready compliance, we bid you heartily\r\n     farewell. Given at our court at Whitehall, the 4th of October,\r\n     1685, in the first year of our reign.\r\n\r\n                                                    \"SUNDERLAND.\"\r\n\r\nVirginia made no law conformable to the requisitions of the king.\r\n\r\nJames the Second, strongly resenting the too democratical proceedings of\r\nthe Virginia assembly, ordered their dissolution, and that Robert\r\nBeverley, as chief promoter of these disputes, should be disfranchised\r\nand prosecuted,[340:C] and directed that in future the appointment of\r\nthe clerk of the house of burgesses should be made by the governor.\r\nSeveral persons were punished about this time for seditious and\r\ntreasonable conduct. In May, 1687, the assembly was dissolved. In the\r\nspring of this year Robert Beverley died--the victim of tyranny and\r\nmartyr of constitutional liberty: long a distinguished loyalist, he\r\nlived to become still more distinguished as a patriot. It is thus in\r\nhuman inconsistency that extremes meet.\r\n\r\nThe English merchants engaged in the tobacco trade, in August, 1687,\r\ncomplained to the committee of the colonies of the mischiefs consequent\r\nupon the exportation of tobacco in bulk; and the committee advised the\r\nassembly to prohibit this practice. The assembly refused compliance; but\r\nthe regulation was subsequently established by parliament. A meditated\r\ninsurrection of the blacks was discovered in the Northern Neck just in\r\ntime to prevent its explosion. In November a message had been received\r\nfrom the Governor of New York, communicating the king's instructions to\r\nhim to build forts for the defence of that colony, and the king's desire\r\nthat Virginia should contribute to that object, as being for the common\r\ndefence of the colonies. This project of James, it was suspected, had\r\nits origin in his own proprietary interest in New York. The Virginians\r\nreplied, that the Indians might invade Virginia without passing within a\r\nhundred miles of those forts, and the contribution was refused. In\r\nDecember, William Byrd succeeded Colonel Nathaniel Bacon, Sr., as\r\nauditor of the accounts of his majesty's revenue in Virginia; he\r\ncontinued to hold that place for seventeen years. His MS. accounts are\r\nstill preserved.\r\n\r\nJames the Second, influenced by the counsels and the gold of France, and\r\nin violation of the most solemn pledges made to the parliament when he\r\nascended the throne, showed himself incorrigibly bent upon introducing\r\nabsolute government and establishing the Roman Catholic religion in\r\nEngland. In Virginia the council displayed, as usual, servility to\r\npower. Upon the dissolution of the assembly, the colony was agitated\r\nwith apprehensions and alarm. Rumors were circulated of terrible plots,\r\nnow of the Papists, then of the Indians. The County of Stafford was\r\ninflamed by the bold harangues of John Waugh, a preacher of the\r\nestablished church, and three councillors were dispatched to allay the\r\ncommotions. Part of Rappahannock County was in arms. Colonel John\r\nScarburgh, of the Eastern Shore, was prosecuted for saying to the\r\ngovernor that \"his majesty King James would wear out the Church of\r\nEngland, for that when there were any vacant offices he supplied them\r\nwith men of a different persuasion.\" Scarburgh was discharged by the\r\ncouncil. Others were prosecuted and imprisoned; and James Collins was\r\nput in irons for treasonable words uttered against the king.\r\n\r\nEffingham, no less avaricious and unscrupulous than his predecessor\r\nCulpepper, by his extortions and usurpations aroused a general spirit of\r\nindignation. He prorogued and dissolved the assembly; he erected a new\r\ncourt of chancery, making himself a petty lord chancellor; he multiplied\r\nfees, and stooped to share them with the clerks, and silenced the\r\nvictims of his extortions by arbitrary imprisonment. The house of\r\nburgesses, preparing to petition the king against the new invention of a\r\nseal, by which his lordship extracted from the country one hundred\r\nthousand pounds of tobacco per annum of extraordinary fees and\r\nperquisites, and the governor getting wind of it, sent for them, and\r\nthey, knowing that his object was to dissolve them, completed the\r\npetition, signed it, and ordered their clerk and one of their members to\r\ntransmit it to Whitehall for the king. But instead of being delivered to\r\nhis majesty, the original petition was sent back from England to the\r\ngovernor, with an account of the manner in which it had been\r\ntransmitted. In consequence whereof, Colonel Thomas Milner, being a\r\nsurveyor and clerk of the house, was removed from those offices, and the\r\nburgess being a lawyer, was prohibited from practising at the\r\nbar.[342:A]\r\n\r\nAt length, the complaints of the Virginians having reached England,\r\nEffingham embarked, in 1688, for that country, and the assembly\r\ndispatched Colonel Ludwell to lay their grievances before the\r\ngovernment; but before they reached the mother country, the revolution\r\nhad taken place, and James the Second[342:B] had closed a short and\r\ninglorious reign, spent in preposterous invasions of civil and religious\r\nliberty, by abdicating the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[335:A] Hening, iii. 540.\r\n\r\n[336:A] Chalmers' Annals, 345.\r\n\r\n[336:B] Beverley, B. i. 89.\r\n\r\n[337:A] One of the James River merchant-vessels mentioned by the first\r\nWilliam Byrd, was called the \"Zach.

The coronation took place on the eleventh day of April. They had\r\nbeen for several months seated on the throne before they were proclaimed\r\nin Virginia. The delay was owing to the reiterated pledges of fealty\r\nmade by the council to James, and from an apprehension that he might be\r\nrestored to the kingdom. Some of the Virginians insisted that, as there\r\nwas no king in England, so there was also an interregnum in the\r\ngovernment of the colony. At length, in compliance with the repeated\r\ncommands of the privy council, William and Mary were proclaimed, at\r\nJames City, in April, 1689, Lord and Lady of Virginia. This glorious\r\nevent, with the circumstances connected with it, was duly announced to\r\nthe lords commissioners of plantations, in a letter, dated on the\r\ntwenty-ninth of that month, by Nicholas Spencer, secretary of state.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the Prince of Orange dispelled the clouds of discontent\r\nand alarm, and inspired the people of the colony with sincere joy. For\r\nabout seventy years Virginia had been subject to the house of Stuart,\r\nand there was little in the retrospect to awaken regret at their\r\ndownfall. They had cramped trade by monopolies and restrictions,\r\nlavished vast bodies of land on their profligate minions, and often\r\nentrusted the reigns of power to incompetent, corrupt, and tyrannical\r\ngovernors. The dynasty of the Stuarts fell buried in the ruins of\r\nmisused power.\r\n\r\nWhen the last of the Stuart governors, Lord Howard of Effingham,\r\nreturned to England, he had left the administration in the hands of\r\nColonel Nathaniel Bacon, Sr., president of the council. Upon the\r\naccession of William and Mary, England being on the eve of a war with\r\nFrance, the president and council of Virginia were directed by the Duke\r\nof Shrewsbury to put the colony in a posture of defence.\r\n\r\nColonel Philip Ludwell, who had been sent out as an agent of the colony\r\nto prefer complaints against Lord Howard of Effingham before the privy\r\ncouncil, now at length obtained a decision in some points rather\r\nfavorable to the colony, but the question of prerogative was determined\r\nin favor of the crown, and it was declared that an act of 1680 _was_\r\nrevived by the king's disallowing the act of repeal.\r\n\r\nBacon's administration was short; he had now obtained an advanced age.\r\nIn his time the project of a college was renewed, but not carried into\r\neffect. President Bacon resided in York County. He married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Richard Kingsmill, Esq., of James City County. Leaving no\r\nissue, by his will he bequeathed his estates to his niece, Abigail\r\nBurwell, and his \"riding horse, Watt, to Lady Berkley,\" at that time\r\nwife of Colonel Philip Ludwell. President Bacon died on the 16th of\r\nMarch, 1692, in the seventy-third year of his age, and lies buries on\r\nKing's Creek,[344:A] as does also Elizabeth, his wife, who died in the\r\nyear 1691, aged sixty-seven.[344:B] The name of the wife of Nathaniel\r\nBacon, Jr., was likewise Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1690 Lord Effingham, reluctant to revisit a province where\r\nhe was so unacceptable, being still absent from Virginia on the plea of\r\nill health, Francis Nicholson, who had been driven from New York by a\r\npopular outbreak, came over as lieutenant-governor. He found the colony\r\nready for revolt. The people were indignant at seeing Effingham still\r\nretained in the office of governor-in-chief, believing that Nicholson\r\nwould become his tool. The revolution in England seemed as yet\r\nproductive of no amendment in the colonial administration. Nicholson,\r\nhowever, now courted popularity; he instituted athletic games, and\r\noffered prizes to those who should excel in riding, running, shooting,\r\nwrestling, and fencing. The last alone could need any encouragement in\r\nsuch a country as Virginia. He proposed the establishment of a\r\npost-office, and recommended the erection of a college, but refused to\r\ncall an assembly to further the scheme, being under obligations to\r\nEffingham to stave off assemblies as long as possible, for fear of\r\ncomplaints being renewed against his arbitrary administration.[345:A]\r\nNevertheless, Nicholson and the council headed a private subscription,\r\nand twenty-five hundred pounds were raised, part of this sum being\r\ncontributed by some London merchants. The new governor made a progress\r\nthrough the colony, mingling freely with the people, and he carried his\r\nindulgence to the common people so far as frequently to suffer them to\r\nenter the room where he was entertaining company at dinner, and diverted\r\nhimself with their scrambling among one another and carrying off the\r\nviands from the table--like Sancho Panza's on the Island of Barataria.\r\nThere is but one step from the courtier to the demagogue.\r\n\r\nVirginia felt the embarrassments which war had brought upon England, and\r\nacts were passed for encouraging domestic manufactures, for which\r\nNicholson found an apology in the scanty supplies imported. The assembly\r\ncongratulated the Prince of Orange on his accession, and thanking him\r\nfor his present of warlike stores, begged for further favors of the\r\nroyal bounty.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Nicholson entered on the duties of governor, the Rev. James\r\nBlair, a native of Scotland, newly appointed commissary of Virginia,\r\nassumed the supervision of the churches of the colony. He came over to\r\nthis country in 1685, and settled in the County of Henrico, where he\r\nremained till 1694, when he removed to Jamestown. The functions of\r\ncommissary, who was a deputy of the Bishop of London, had been\r\npreviously discharged by the Rev. Mr. Temple, but he was not regularly\r\ncommissioned.\r\n\r\nAt the instance of the Rev. Mr. Blair, in 1691 the assembly entered\r\nheartily into the scheme of a college, and in the same year he was\r\ndispatched with an address to their majesties, King William and Queen\r\nMary, soliciting a charter.\r\n\r\nThe first assembly under the new dynasty met at James City, in April,\r\n1691, being the third year of their reign. Acts were passed for putting\r\nthe colony in a better state of defence, for reducing the poll tax, and\r\nlaying a duty on liquors, and for appointing a treasurer. Colonel Edward\r\nHill was appointed to that office. The same assembly met again by\r\nprorogation, in April of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nCommissary Blair was graciously received at court, and in February,\r\n1692, their majesties granted the charter.[346:A] The college was named\r\nin honor of their majesties. The king gave about two thousand pounds\r\ntoward the building, out of the quit-rents. Seymour, the English\r\nattorney-general, having received the royal commands to prepare the\r\ncharter of the college, which was to be accompanied with a grant of\r\nmoney, remonstrated against this liberality, urging that the nation was\r\nengaged in an expensive war; that the money was wanted for better\r\npurposes, and that he did not see the slightest occasion for a college\r\nin Virginia. The Rev. Mr. Blair, in reply, represented to him that its\r\nintention was to educate and qualify young men to be ministers of the\r\ngospel; and begged Mr. Attorney would consider that the people of\r\nVirginia had souls to be saved as well as the people of England.\r\n\"Souls!\" exclaimed the imperious Seymour; \"damn your souls!--make\r\ntobacco.\"[346:B]\r\n\r\nThe site selected for the college was in the Middle Plantation Old\r\nFields, near the church. The college was endowed by the crown with\r\ntwenty thousand acres of land in Pamunkey Neck, and on the south side of\r\nBlackwater Swamp; the patronage of the office of surveyor-general;\r\ntogether with the revenue arising from a duty of one penny a pound on\r\nall tobacco exported from Virginia and Maryland to the other\r\nplantations, the nett proceeds being two hundred pounds. The college\r\nwas also allowed to return a burgess to the assembly. The assembly\r\nafterwards added to the revenue a duty on skins and furs.[347:A] Dr.\r\nBlair was the first president of the college, being appointed under the\r\ncharter to hold the office for life. The plan of the building was the\r\ncomposition of Sir Christopher Wren. The objects proposed by the\r\nestablishment of the college were declared to be the furnishing of a\r\nseminary for the ministers of the gospel, and that the youth may be\r\npiously educated in good letters and manners, and that the Christian\r\nfaith should be propagated among the Western Indians.[347:B] In addition\r\nto the five professorships of Greek and Latin, the mathematics, moral\r\nphilosophy, and two of divinity provided for by the charter, a sixth,\r\ncalled the Brafferton, from an estate in England which secured the\r\nendowment, had been annexed by the celebrated Robert Boyle, for the\r\ninstruction and conversion of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe trustees met with many difficulties in their undertaking during the\r\nadministration of Governor Andros, and were involved in a troublesome\r\ncontroversy concerning the lands appropriated to the institution, with\r\nSecretary Wormley, the most influential man in the colony, next to the\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1692, died John Page, of Rosewell, of the king's council in\r\nthe colony, aged sixty--a learned and pious man; first of the name in\r\nVirginia, and father of the Honorable Colonel Matthew Page, who was also\r\nof the council. A religious work, entitled \"A Deed of Gift for my Son,\"\r\nby this John Page, has been published.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year Governor Nicholson was succeeded by Sir Edmund\r\nAndros, whose high-handed course had rendered him so odious to the\r\npeople of New England that they had lately imprisoned him. He was,\r\nnevertheless, kindly received by the Virginians, whose solicitations to\r\nKing William for warlike stores he had promoted. He soon gave offence by\r\nordering ships to cruise against vessels engaged in contraband trade. In\r\nthe year 1693 an act was passed for the organizing of a post-office\r\nestablishment in Virginia, to consist of a central office, and a\r\nsub-office in each county, fixing the rates of postage to be paid to\r\nThomas Neale, Esq., who was authorized by an act of parliament to\r\nestablish post-offices in the colonies. The postage on a letter\r\nconsisting of one sheet, for a distance not exceeding eighty miles, was\r\nthree pence. Four companies of rangers protected the frontiers, while\r\nEnglish frigates guarded the coast; and the colony enjoyed a long\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nThe amiable and excellent Queen Mary died on the 28th day of December,\r\n1694; and the king now assumed the title of William the Third. Since the\r\ndissolution of the Virginia Company, the superintendence of the colonies\r\nhad been entrusted to a committee of the privy council; in 1696 the\r\nboard of trade was established for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[344:A] James City Records, cited in \"Farmer's Register\" for 1839, p.\r\n407\r\n\r\n[344:B] Dr. Williamson, of Williamsburg, obligingly sent me the\r\ninscription and the coat of arms, as copied by him from her tombstone,\r\nwhich was ploughed up on the banks of Queen's Creek.\r\n\r\n[345:A] Beverley, B. i. 92.\r\n\r\n[346:A] The following gentlemen, nominated by the assembly, were\r\nconstituted a senate, or board of trustees: Francis Nicholson,\r\nlieutenant-governor of the colony; William Cole, Ralph Wormley, William\r\nByrd, Esquires, of the council; John Leare, James Blair, John Farnifold,\r\nStephen Fauce, and Samuel Gray, clerks (clergymen;) Thomas Milner,\r\nChristopher Robinson, Charles Scarburgh, John Smith, Benjamin Harrison,\r\nMiles Cary, Henry Hartwell, William Randolph, and Matthew Page,\r\ngentlemen and burgesses.\r\n\r\n[346:B] Franklin's Correspondence.\r\n\r\n[347:A] Hening, iii. 123, 241, 356: Catalogue of William and Mary\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n[347:B] Anderson's Hist. of Church of England in the Colonies, second\r\ned., iii. 108.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n1696-1698.\r\n\r\n     State and Condition of Virginia--Exhausting Agriculture--\r\n     Depression of Mechanic Art--Merchants--Current Coin--Grants of\r\n     Land--Powers of Governor--The Council--Court of Claims--County\r\n     Courts--General Court--Secretary, Sheriffs, Collectors, and\r\n     Vestries--Revenue--The Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following statistical account of Virginia appears to have been\r\nreported by Lord Culpepper, in 1781, to the Committee of the colonies.\r\nIt is to be found in the Historical Collections of Massachusetts,[349:A]\r\nthe manuscript having been communicated by Carter B. Harrison, Esq., of\r\nVirginia, by the hands of the Rev. John Jones Spooner, corresponding\r\nmember. The picture is harsh, but drawn by a vigorous hand, without\r\nfear, favor, or affection.\r\n\r\nIn point of natural advantages Virginia was surpassed by few countries\r\non the globe, but in commerce, manufactures, education, government in\r\nchurch and state, was one of the poorest and most miserable. The staple\r\ntobacco swallowed up every thing, so that the markets were often glutted\r\nwith bad tobacco, which became a mere drug, and would not pay freight\r\nand customs. Perhaps not one hundredth part of the land was yet cleared,\r\nand none of the marsh or swamp drained. As fast as the soil was worn out\r\nby exhausting crops of tobacco and corn, it was left to grow up again in\r\nwoods. The plough was not much used, in the first clearing the roots and\r\nstumps being left, and the ground tilled only with hoes, and by the time\r\nthe stumps were decayed the ground was worn out. Manure was neglected.\r\nOf grain the planters usually raised only enough for home consumption,\r\nthere being no market for it, and scarce any money. But their main labor\r\nin this crop being in the summer, they fell into habits of indolence\r\nfor the rest of the year. The circumstances of the country, destitute of\r\ntowns, and consisting of dispersed plantations, were unfavorable for\r\nmechanics, then called tradesmen. The depression of this useful and\r\nimportant class although lessened, continues in the present day, and\r\nappears to be inevitably connected with the system of negro slavery. It\r\nis a tax paid by the whites for the elevation of the black race. The\r\nmerchants were the most prosperous class in the colony, but they labored\r\nunder great disadvantages, being obliged to sell on credit, and to carry\r\non \"a pitiful retail trade,\" and to depend on the receivers who went\r\nabout among the planters to receive the tobacco due, and this mode of\r\ncollecting was subject to great delays and losses. The native-born\r\nVirginians, who for the most part had never been out of the colony, were\r\naverse to town life, and felt dissatisfied, like Daniel Boone in more\r\nmodern times, whenever \"the settlements became too thick.\" The scarcity\r\nof money was aggravated by the governor, who found it to his interest to\r\nbe paid in tobacco. The current coin of the dominion of Virginia\r\nconsisted of pieces of eight, the value of which was fixed by law at\r\nfive shillings; and the value being made greater in Pennsylvania money,\r\nthey were consequently drained from Virginia, as at the present day gold\r\nand silver are ostracised by a depreciated paper currency.\r\n\r\nThe method of settling the colonial territory was by the king's grant of\r\nfifty acres to every actual settler, but this rule was evaded and\r\nperverted in various ways, and rights for that quantity of land could\r\neasily be purchased from the clerks in the secretary's office at from\r\none to five shillings each. The powers of the governor were extensive;\r\nhe was a sort of viceroy, being commander-in-chief and vice-admiral,\r\nlord treasurer in issuing warrants for the paying of moneys, lord\r\nchancellor or lord keeper as passing grants under the colony's seal,\r\npresident of the council, chief justice of the courts, with some powers\r\nof a bishop or ordinary. The governors managed to evade the king's\r\ninstructions, and by official patronage to silence the opposition of the\r\ncouncil, and even to hold the burgesses in check. The governor and\r\ncouncillors were all colonels and honorable, and their adherents\r\nmonopolized the offices. The governor's salary was for many years one\r\nthousand pounds per annum, to which the assembly added perquisites,\r\namounting to five hundred more, and a further addition of two hundred\r\npounds was made to Sir William Berkley's salary, making the whole salary\r\nseventeen hundred pounds. The council, in effect the creatures and\r\nclients of the governor, being appointed at his nomination, and\r\nreceiving office and place from him, had the powers of council of state,\r\n(in case of vacancy of the governor the oldest of them _ex officio_\r\nacting as president _ad interim_,) of upper house of assembly or house\r\nof lords, in the general court of supreme judges, and as colonels,\r\nanswering to the English lord-lieutenants of counties. The councillors\r\nwere also naval officers in the customs department, collectors of the\r\nrevenue, farmers of the king's quit-rents; out of the council were\r\nchosen the secretary, auditor, and escheators; the councillors were\r\nexempt from arrests, and had a compensation of three hundred and fifty\r\npounds divided among them, according to their attendance. They met\r\ntogether after the manner of the king and council. Their clerk received\r\nfifty pounds per annum salary, besides perquisites. The office of\r\ncollector, held by members of the council, was indeed incompatible with\r\ntheir office of judge, and their office of councillor unfitted them for\r\nauditing their own accounts as collectors, and in different capacities\r\nthey both bought and sold the royal quit-rents.[351:A]\r\n\r\nUpon the election of burgesses there was commonly held a court, called a\r\ncourt of claims, where all who had any claims against the public might\r\npresent them to the burgesses, together with any propositions or\r\ngrievances, \"all which the burgesses carry to the assembly.\" There was\r\nat that early day much confusion in the laws, and it was difficult to\r\nknow what laws were in force and what were not. All causes were decided\r\nin the county court or in the general court. The county court consisted\r\nof eight or ten gentlemen, receiving their commission from the governor,\r\nwho renewed it annually. They met once a month, or once in two months,\r\nand had cognizance of all causes exceeding in value twenty shillings, or\r\ntwo hundred pounds of tobacco. These country gentlemen, having no\r\neducation in law, not unfrequently fell into mistakes in substance and\r\nin form. The insufficiency of these courts was now growing more apparent\r\nthan formerly, since the old stock of gentry, who were educated in\r\nEngland, were better acquainted with law and with the business of the\r\nworld than their sons and grandsons, who were brought up in Virginia,\r\nand commonly knew only reading, writing, and arithmetic, and were not\r\nvery proficient in them.\r\n\r\nThe general court, so called because it had jurisdiction of causes from\r\nall parts of the colony, was held twice a year, in April and October, by\r\nthe governor and council as judges, at Jamestown. This court was never\r\ncommissioned, but grew up by custom or usurpation; from it there was no\r\nappeal, except in cases of over three hundred pounds sterling value, to\r\nthe king, which was for most persons impracticable, on account of the\r\ndistance and the expensiveness. Virginia appears to have been the only\r\ncolony where the executive constituted the supreme court. The general\r\ncourt tried all causes of above sixteen pounds sterling, or sixteen\r\nhundred pounds of tobacco in value, and all appeals from the county\r\ncourts, and it had cognizance of all causes in chancery, in king's\r\nbench, the common pleas, the exchequer, the admiralty, and spirituality.\r\nThe forms of proceeding in the general court were quite irregular. The\r\nduties of the secretary were as multifarious as those of the governor;\r\nit was, however, for the most part a sinecure, the business being\r\nperformed by a clerk, styled the clerk of the general court, who also\r\nemployed one or two clerks under him. The secretary, who was properly\r\nthe clerk of the court, yet sate as judge of that court.\r\n\r\nThe governor signed all patents or deeds of land, and there was a\r\nrecital in them that he granted the land \"by and with the consent of the\r\ncouncil,\" yet the patents were never read by the governor, nor did the\r\ncouncil take any notice of them. He likewise countersigned the patents\r\nafter the words \"compared, and agrees with the original,\" yet the\r\nsecretary never read or compared them, and indeed the patent which he\r\nsigned was itself the original. \"Men make laws, but we live by custom.\"\r\nThe sheriffs collected all money duties. The auditor audited the\r\naccounts of the collectors, and was receiver-general of all public\r\nmoneys. The parish levy, for the support of the church and of the poor,\r\nwas assessed by the vestry, about the month of October, when tobacco was\r\nready; the whole amount assessed was divided by the number of tithables\r\nof the parish, and collected from the heads of families. The county levy\r\nfor county expenses was assessed by the justices of the peace, and the\r\nsum divided by the number of tithables in the county. The public levy\r\nwas assessed by the assembly for the general expenses of the colony, and\r\nthe sum was divided by the number of tithables in the colony, amounting\r\nin the year 1690 to about twenty thousand. The three levies were all\r\ncollected by the sheriffs; they averaged about one hundred pounds of\r\ntobacco for each tithable, the aggregate amounting to two millions of\r\npounds per annum.\r\n\r\nThe revenues and customs that came into the auditor's hands were of four\r\nkinds: First, the quit-rents, being one shilling per annum on every\r\nfifty acres of land, payable in tobacco, at one penny per pound, or\r\ntwenty-four pounds of tobacco for every hundred acres. In the Northern\r\nNeck, lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock, the quit-rents were\r\npaid by the heirs of Lord Culpepper. The tobacco due for quit-rents was\r\nsold by the auditor to the several members of the council, who paid for\r\nit in money, or bills of exchange, according to the quantity. The\r\nquit-rent revenue amounted to about eight hundred pounds sterling per\r\nannum. The second source of revenue consisted of two shillings per\r\nhogshead, export duty, on tobacco, and fort duties, being fifteen pence\r\nper ton on all vessels arriving. These amounted to three thousand pounds\r\nsterling per annum. Ten per cent. of this amount was paid to masters of\r\nvessels, to induce them to give a true account. The collectors received\r\nten per cent. for collecting, and the auditor seven per cent. The third\r\nsource of revenue was one penny per pound upon tobacco exported from\r\nVirginia to any other English plantation in America. This, as has been\r\nmentioned, was, in 1692, granted to the college of William and Mary. The\r\ncollege paid for collecting it no less than twenty per cent., and to the\r\nauditor five per cent. The nett proceeds were worth one hundred pounds\r\nannually. The fourth source of revenue was any money duty that might be\r\nraised by the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe governor was lieutenant-general, the councillors lieutenants of\r\ncounties, with the title of colonel, and in counties where no councillor\r\nresided, some other person was appointed, with the rank of major. The\r\npeople in general professed to be of the Church of England. The only\r\ndissenters were three or four meetings of Quakers and one of\r\nPresbyterians. There were fifty parishes, and in each two, and sometimes\r\nthree, churches and chapels. The division of the parishes was unequal\r\nand inconvenient. The governor had always held the government of the\r\nchurch, as of everything else, in his hands. Ministers were obliged to\r\nproduce their orders to him, and show that they had been episcopally\r\nordained. The power of presentation was, by a colonial law, in the\r\nvestry, but by a custom of hiring preachers by the year, it came to pass\r\nthat presentation rarely took place. The consequence was that a good\r\nminister either would not come to Virginia, or if he did, was soon\r\ndriven away by the high-handed proceedings of the vestry. The minister\r\nwas obliged to be careful how he preached against the vices that any\r\ngreat man of the vestry was guilty of, else he would be in danger of\r\nlosing his living at the end of the year. They held them by a precarious\r\ntenure, like that of chaplains; they were mere tenants at sufferance.\r\nThere were not half as many ministers in Virginia as parishes. The\r\ngovernor connived at this state of things. The minister's salary was\r\nsixteen thousand pounds of tobacco per annum. King Charles the Second\r\ngave the Bishop of London jurisdiction over the church in the\r\nplantations, in all matters except three, viz.: marriage licenses,\r\nprobates of wills, and induction of ministers, which were reserved to\r\nthe governor. The bishop's commissary made visitation of the churches\r\nand inspection of the clergy. He received no salary, but was allowed, by\r\nthe king, one hundred pounds per annum out of the quit-rents.[355:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[349:A] First Series, v. 124.\r\n\r\n[351:A] The council, in the time of Governor Andros, consisted of Ralph\r\nWormley, collector and naval officer of Rappahannock River; Colonel\r\nRichard Lee, collector and naval officer of upper district of Potomac\r\nRiver--these two having been appointed while Sir William Berkley was\r\ngovernor; Colonel William Byrd, who was appointed auditor during Lord\r\nCulpepper's administration; Colonel Christopher Wormley, collector and\r\nnaval officer of the lower district of the Potomac River, appointed\r\nwhile Lord Effingham was governor; Colonel Edward Hill, collector and\r\nnaval officer of upper district of James River; Colonel Edmund Jennings,\r\ncollector and naval officer of York River--these two being appointed in\r\nLord Effingham's time; Colonel Daniel Parke, collector and naval officer\r\nof the lower district of James River, and escheator between York and\r\nRappahannock Rivers; Colonel Charles Scarburgh, collector and naval\r\nofficer on the Eastern Shore, and Mr. John Lightfoot, who had lately\r\narrived in the country--these last four appointed while Sir Edmund\r\nAndros was governor.\r\n\r\n[355:A] Account of Va., in Mass.

He was a patron of\r\nmanufactures; but the acts for establishing fulling-mills were rejected\r\nby the board of trade. He encouraged the culture of cotton, which,\r\nhowever, fell into disuse.\r\n\r\nBy royal instructions, Andros was invested with the powers of ordinary,\r\nor representative of the king and the bishop of London, in the affairs\r\nof the church. This brought him into collision with Commissary Blair,\r\nand in 1694 the governor arbitrarily suspended him from his place in the\r\ncouncil, to which he had been appointed in the preceding year. While in\r\nEngland on the business of the college, in 1695, the doctor preferred\r\ncharges against Andros as an enemy to religion, to the church, the\r\nclergy, and the college. The charges and the proofs covered thirty-two\r\nfolio pages of manuscript, and were drawn up with ability. But Blair had\r\nto contend with formidable opposition, for Governor Andros sent over to\r\nLondon, in his defence, Colonel Byrd, of Westover, Mr. Harrison, of\r\nSurry County, Mr. Povey, who was high in office in the colony, and a Mr.\r\nMarshall, to arraign the Rev. Commissary himself before the Bishop of\r\nLondon and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Two days were spent at Lambeth\r\nPalace, in the examination, the charges and answers filling fifty-seven\r\nfolio pages of manuscript, and Dr. Blair's accusers were signally\r\ndiscomfited. Much of the prejudice against him was owing to his being a\r\nScotchman--a prejudice at that time running very high in England. The\r\nresult was that Blair returned after successfully accomplishing the\r\nobject of his mission, and having been reinstated in the council by the\r\nking. He was, nevertheless, again removed upon a pretence equally\r\nfrivolous.[357:A] Andros was sent back to England to answer in person\r\nthe charges alleged against him, and eventually, they being\r\nsubstantiated, he was removed from his office of deputy governor of\r\nVirginia.[357:B]\r\n\r\nWilliam the Third, by the treaty of Ryswick, in 1697, obtained an\r\nacknowledgment of his right to the crown, and vindicated the principles\r\nof constitutional freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Hugo Jones, author of a work entitled \"Present State of\r\nVirginia,\" writing from Maryland in this year, says of the people there:\r\n\"They are, generally speaking, crafty, knavish, litigious, dissemblers,\r\nand debauched. A gentleman (I mean one of a generous Cambro-Briton\r\ntemper) is _rara avis in terris_. A man must be circumspect and prudent\r\nif he will maintain his reputation among them. Of dealing, it is very\r\ntrue what was told me by a man at London, that none is fit to deal with\r\na Virginian but a Virginian; however, I having made it my business both\r\nin London and at sea to inquire into the nature of the people, that I\r\nmight know the better how to behave myself among them, have gained as\r\ngood a reputation as in modesty I could expect; neither have I been much\r\nimposed upon in my bargains. As to the people's disposition in matters\r\nof religion, they will follow none out of the path of interest, and they\r\nheartily embrace none but such as will fill the barn and the basket.\r\nMost sects are here professed, but in general they are practical\r\natheists.\"[357:C]\r\n\r\nThe uncharitable judgments of this narrow-minded writer are not\r\nentitled to much weight. Among a people requiring so much ministerial\r\ncare, he found ample time to devote to the study of natural history, and\r\nwas curious in the examination of \"fishes' bones\" and \"petrified\r\nmushrooms.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1698 died Thomas Ludwell, Esq., some time secretary of\r\nVirginia. He was born at Bruton, County Somerset, England. Sir Edmund\r\nAndros was succeeded in November, 1698, by Colonel Nicholson,\r\ntransferred from the government of Maryland. He entertained a plan of\r\nconfederating the colonies together, and aspired to become himself the\r\nviceroy of the contemplated union. Finding himself thwarted in these\r\nprojects, his conduct became self-willed and overbearing. In a memorial\r\nsent to England, he stated that tobacco bore so low a price as not to\r\nyield even clothes to the planters; yet, in the same paper, advised\r\nparliament to prohibit the plantations from making their own clothing;\r\nin other words, proposing that they should be left to go naked.[358:A]\r\nIndeed, he appeared to be quite altered from what he had been during his\r\nformer administration in Virginia; and the change was thought to be not\r\na little owing to a disappointment in love. He had become passionately\r\nattached to a daughter of Lewis Burwell, Jr., and failing to win her\r\nfavor or that of her parents, in his suit, he became infuriated, and\r\npersisted, Quixotically, for years in his fruitless purpose. The young\r\nlady's father, and her brothers, and Commissary Blair, and the Rev. Mr.\r\nFouace, minister of the parish, were especial objects of his vengeance.\r\nTo the young lady he threatened the death of her father and her\r\nbrothers, if she did not yield to his suit. He committed other outrages\r\nno less extraordinary.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of a healthier situation, Governor Nicholson removed the\r\nseat of government from Jamestown, now containing only three or four\r\ngood inhabited houses, to Middle Plantation, so called from its lying\r\nmidway between James and York Rivers. Here he projected a large town,\r\nlaying out the streets in the form of a W and M, in honor of King\r\nWilliam and Queen Mary. This plan, however, appears to have been\r\nabandoned, or only partially carried out.[359:A] According to the\r\ncontemporary historian Beverley, Nicholson declared openly to the lower\r\norder of people \"that the gentlemen imposed upon them; that the servants\r\nhad all been kidnapped, and had a lawful action against their masters.\"\r\nIn the year 1700 Mr. Fowler, the king's attorney-general for the colony,\r\ndeclaring some piece of service against law, the governor seized him by\r\nthe collar, and swore \"that he knew no laws they had, and that his\r\ncommands should be obeyed without hesitation or reserve.\" He committed\r\ngentlemen who offended him to prison without any complaint, and refused\r\nto allow bail; and some of them having intimated to him that such\r\nproceedings were illegal, he replied, \"that they had no right at all to\r\nthe liberties of English subjects, and that he would hang up those that\r\nshould presume to oppose him, with magna charta about their necks.\" He\r\noften extolled the governments of Fez and Morocco, and at a meeting of\r\nthe governors of the college, told them \"that he knew how to govern the\r\nMoors, and would beat them into better manners.\" At another time he\r\navowed that he knew how to govern the country without assemblies, and if\r\nthey should deny him anything after he had obtained a standing army, \"he\r\nwould bring them to reason with halters about their necks.\" His outrages\r\nmade him jealous, and to prevent complaints being sent to England\r\nagainst him, he is said to have intercepted letters, employed spies, and\r\neven played the eavesdropper himself. He sometimes held inquisitorial\r\ncourts to find grounds of accusation against such as incurred his\r\ndispleasure.[359:B]\r\n\r\nRobert Beverley, author of a \"History of Virginia,\" published the first\r\nedition of it in 1705. He was a son of Robert Beverley, the persecuted\r\nclerk, who died in 1687. This may account somewhat for his extreme\r\nacrimony against Culpepper and Effingham, who had persecuted his father,\r\nand against Nicholson, who was Effingham's deputy. In his second\r\nedition, when time had, perhaps, mitigated his animosities, Beverley\r\nomitted many of his accusations against these governors. In favor of\r\nNicholson, it is also to be observed, that his administration in\r\nMaryland and in South Carolina was more satisfactory. But it is certain\r\nthat he was an erratic, Quixotic, irascible man, who could not bear\r\nopposition, and an extreme high churchman.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh year of William the Third an act was passed for the\r\nrestraining and punishing of pirates and privateers, the preamble\r\nreciting that \"nothing can more conduce to the honor of his most sacred\r\nmajesty than that such articles of peace as are concluded in all\r\ntreaties should be kept and preserved inviolable by his majesty's\r\nsubjects in and over all his majesty's territories and dominions, and\r\nthat great mischief and depredations are daily done upon the high seas\r\nby pirates, privateers, and sea-robbers, in not only taking and\r\npillaging several ships and vessels belonging to his majesty's subjects,\r\nbut also in taking, destroying, and robbing several ships belonging to\r\nthe subjects of foreign princes, in league and amity with his majesty;\"\r\nand they prayed that crimes committed on the high seas should be\r\npunished as if committed on land, in Virginia.[360:A] A committee was\r\nappointed during the same session \"to revise the laws of this his\r\nmajesty's ancient and great colony and dominion of Virginia.\"[360:B]\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects upon which a tax was laid for the building of a\r\ncapitol, were servants imported, not being natives of England or Wales,\r\nfifteen shillings per poll, and twenty shillings on every negro or other\r\nslave. Colonel Robert Carter, speaker of the house, was elected to fill\r\nthe office of treasurer; and it came to be the custom for the two\r\noffices of speaker and treasurer to be held by the same person. The\r\nestablishment of the office of a treasurer appointed by the assembly,\r\ngiving that body control of the colonial purse, added much to the\r\nindependence of its legislative power.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of Nicholson's administration a piratical vessel was\r\ncaptured within the capes of Virginia. She had taken some\r\nmerchant-vessels in Lynhaven Bay, and a small vessel happening to\r\nwitness an engagement between her and a merchantman, conveyed\r\nintelligence of it to the Shoram, a fifth-rate man-of-war, commanded by\r\nCaptain Passenger, and newly arrived. Nicholson chanced to be at\r\nKiquotan sealing up his letters, and, going on board the Shoram, was\r\npresent in the engagement that followed. The Shoram, by daybreak, having\r\ngot in between the capes and the pirate, intercepted her, and an action\r\ntook place on the 29th of April, 1700, when the pirate surrendered upon\r\ncondition of being referred to the king's mercy. In this affair fell\r\nPeter Heyman, grandson of Sir Peter Heyman, of Summerfield, in the\r\nCounty of Kent, England. Being collector of the customs in the lower\r\ndistrict of James River, he volunteered to go on board the Shoram, and\r\nafter behaving with undaunted courage, standing on the quarter-deck near\r\nthe governor, was killed by a small shot.\r\n\r\nDuring this year died the Honorable Colonel Edward Hill, of Shirley, on\r\nthe James River, in the sixty-third year of his age; he was of the\r\ncouncil, colonel and commander-in-chief of the Counties of Charles City\r\nand Surry, judge of his majesty's high court of admiralty, and some time\r\ntreasurer of Virginia. He lies buried at Shirley, and a portrait of him\r\nand his wife is preserved there.\r\n\r\nIn the year preceding this, Protestant dissenters, qualified according\r\nto the toleration act of the first year of William and Mary, were\r\nexempted from penalties for not repairing to the parish church, if they\r\nattended some legal place of worship once in two months.[361:A] The\r\npress was not yet free in Virginia, and the writ of _habeas corpus_ was\r\nstill withheld.\r\n\r\nThere was a commencement at William and Mary College in the year 1700,\r\nat which there was a great concourse of people; several planters came\r\nthither in coaches, and others in sloops from New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nand Maryland, it being a new thing in that part of America to hear\r\ngraduates perform their exercises. The Indians themselves had the\r\ncuriosity, some of them, to visit Williamsburg upon that occasion; and\r\nthe whole country rejoiced as if they had some relish of learning.\r\nFifty-eight years before this there had been celebrated a commencement\r\nat Harvard College, in Massachusetts.[362:A]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1701 Colonel Quarry, surveyor-general of the customs, wrote\r\nto the board of trade: \"This malignant humor is not confined to\r\nVirginia, formerly the most remarkable for loyalty, but is universally\r\ndiffused.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the month of March of this year died William the Third. His\r\nmanner was taciturn, reserved, haughty; his genius military; his\r\ndecision inflexible. In his fondness of prerogative he showed himself a\r\ngrandson of the first Charles; as the defender of the Protestant\r\nreligion, and Prince of Orange, he displayed toleration toward all\r\nexcept Papists. The government of Virginia under him was not materially\r\nimproved. He was succeeded by Anne, daughter of James the Second. Louis\r\nthe Fourteenth having recognized the Pretender as lawful heir to the\r\nBritish crown, Anne, shortly after she succeeded to the throne, in 1702,\r\ndeclared war against France, and its ally Spain; but Virginia was not\r\ndirectly affected by the long conflict that ensued. In compliance with\r\nthe requests of the assembly, the queen granted the colony warlike\r\nstores, to the value of three thousand and three hundred pounds, which\r\nthe governor was directed to pay from the revenue of quit-rents. Her\r\nmajesty, at the same time, renewed the requisition formerly made by the\r\ncrown for an appropriation in aid of the defences of New York; but the\r\nburgesses still steadily refused.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of William the Third the commerce of Virginia had been\r\nseriously interrupted, and her customary supplies withheld; she,\r\ntherefore, encouraged the domestic manufacture of linen and wool; but an\r\nact for the establishment of fulling-mills was rejected by the board of\r\ntrade, as also was one for \"the better securing the liberty of the\r\nsubject.\" Governor Nicholson, in a memorial to the council of trade,\r\ndescribed the people of Virginia as numerous, rich, and of republican\r\nprinciples, such as ought to be lowered in time; that then or never was\r\nthe time to maintain the queen's prerogative, and put a stop to those\r\npernicious notions, which were increasing daily, not only in Virginia,\r\nbut in all her majesty's other governments, and that a frown from her\r\nmajesty now would do more than an army thereafter; and he insisted on\r\nthe necessity of a standing army.[363:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[357:A] Account of Va. in Mass.

The burgesses having complied\r\nwith this order, his excellency was pleased to let them know that her\r\nmost sacred majesty having been pleased to renew his commission to be\r\nher majesty's lieutenant and governor-general of this her majesty's most\r\nancient and great colony and dominion of Virginia, he would cause the\r\nsaid commission to be read to them. This being done, he read them that\r\npart of his instructions wherein the council are nominated, and informed\r\nthe house that upon the death of Colonel Page, the number of councillors\r\nhaving fallen under nine, he had appointed one to supply that vacancy.\r\nThe governor next mentioned to the house that he had commissioned some\r\nof her majesty's honorable council to administer the oath to the\r\nburgesses. Whereupon they withdrew, and the oath was administered by the\r\nHonorable William Byrd, John Lightfoot, and Benjamin Harrison. These\r\ngentlemen returning to the council chamber, the clerk of the assembly\r\nwas ordered to wait again upon the house of burgesses, and acquaint them\r\nthat his excellency commanded their immediate attendance on him. The\r\nhouse of burgesses complying with this order, the governor made the\r\nfollowing speech:--\r\n\r\n     \"HONORABLE GENTLEMEN,--\r\n\r\n     \"God Almighty, I hope, will be graciously pleased so to\r\n     direct, guide, and enable us, as that we may, to all intents\r\n     and purposes, answer her majesty's writ by which this assembly\r\n     was called, and by prorogation is now met in this her majesty\r\n     Queen Anne her royal capitol; which being appointed by law for\r\n     holding general assemblies and general courts, my hopes\r\n     likewise are that they may continue to be held in this place\r\n     for the promoting of God's glory, her majesty, and her\r\n     successors' interest and service with that of the inhabitants\r\n     of this her majesty's most ancient and great colony and\r\n     dominion of Virginia, so long as the sun and moon endure.\r\n     Gentlemen, her most sacred majesty having been graciously\r\n     pleased to send me her royal picture and arms for this her\r\n     colony and dominion, I think the properest place to have them\r\n     kept in, will be this council chamber; but it not being as yet\r\n     quite finished, I cannot have them so placed as I would.\r\n\r\n     \"By private accounts which I have from England, I understand\r\n     her majesty hath lately thought fit to appoint a day of public\r\n     fasting and humiliation there; but I have not yet seen her\r\n     majesty's royal proclamation for it, which makes me not\r\n     willing to appoint one here till I have. And had it not been\r\n     for this, I designed that her majesty's royal picture and arms\r\n     should have been first seen by you on St. George his day, and\r\n     to have kept it as a day of public thanksgiving, it being the\r\n     day on which her majesty was crowned, and bearing the name of\r\n     his royal highness the Prince of Denmark, and likewise of the\r\n     patron of our mother kingdom of England.\r\n\r\n     \"Honorable gentlemen, I don't in the least doubt but that you\r\n     will join with me in paying our most humble and dutiful\r\n     acknowledgments and thanks to her most sacred majesty for this\r\n     great honor and favor which she hath been pleased to bestow\r\n     upon your country, and in praying that she may have a long,\r\n     prosperous, successful, and victorious reign, as also that she\r\n     may in all respects not only equal, but even outdo her royal\r\n     predecessor, Queen Elizabeth, of ever-glorious memory, in the\r\n     latter end of whose reign this country was discovered, and in\r\n     honor of her called Virginia.\r\n\r\n     \"It is now within two years of a century since its being first\r\n     seated, at which time, if God Almighty and her majesty shall\r\n     be so pleased, I design to celebrate a jubilee, and that the\r\n     inhabitants thereof may increase exceedingly, and also abound\r\n     with riches and honors, and have extraordinary good success in\r\n     all their undertakings, but chiefly that they may be exemplary\r\n     in their lives and conversations, continue in their religion\r\n     of the Church of England as by law established, loyal to the\r\n     crown thereof, and that all these things may come to pass, I\r\n     question not but you will most cordially join with me in our\r\n     most unfeigned and hearty prayers to God Almighty for them.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of this verbose speech, the burgesses returned to their\r\nhouse, and the council adjourned.[366:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[364:A] A meeting of the council was held, consisting of his Excellency\r\nFrancis Nicholson, Esq., lieutenant and governor-general, and William\r\nByrd, John Lightfoot, Benjamin Harrison, Robert Carter, John Custis,\r\nPhilip Ludwell, William Basset, Henry Duke, Robert Quarry, and John\r\nSmith, Esquires.\r\n\r\n[366:A] Documents in S.

In Virginia,\r\non the contrary, the salary being levied directly from the people by the\r\nvestries, they fell upon the expedient, as has been repeatedly\r\nmentioned, of employing a minister for a year. Governor Nicholson, an\r\nextreme high-churchman, procured from the attorney-general, Northy, an\r\nopinion against this custom, and it was sent to all the vestries,\r\nwith directions to put it on record. The vestries, nevertheless,\r\npertinaciously resisted this construction of the law. In two important\r\npoints the church establishment in Virginia differed from that in\r\nEngland--in the appointment of the minister by the vestry, according to\r\nthe act of 1642, and in the absence of a bishop.\r\n\r\nIn recent times the disruption of the Scottish general assembly resulted\r\nin the Free Church of Scotland, which thus, by sacrificing the\r\ntemporalities, vindicated its independence of the government in things\r\nspiritual. In Virginia the vestries virtually maintained a like\r\nindependence. In Scotland the contest arrayed against each other\r\nschismatic parties in the established kirk, known as the Evangelical and\r\nthe Moderates, whereas in Virginia it was a mere contest for power\r\nbetween the vestries and the government. The Free Church of Scotland, at\r\nthe time of the disruption, was still in theory in favor of an\r\nestablishment in which the clergy should be chosen by the people and\r\npaid by the government.[368:A] Even in England, under the constitution\r\nof the established church, the ministers of certain exceptional chapels\r\nwere formerly elected by the freeholders of the parish, subject to the\r\napproval of the vicar, and the violation of their rights in this\r\nparticular was sometimes resented in the ruder districts of Yorkshire,\r\nby outrageous insults offered to the new incumbent during the time of\r\nservice, and by brutal personal assaults upon the minister.[368:B]\r\n\r\nBefore the beginning of the eighteenth century the proprietary\r\ngovernment, granted by Charles the First to Lord Baltimore, had at\r\nlength been abolished, and the Church of England established there.\r\nThere was less tolerance under this establishment than before. In\r\nMaryland as in Virginia, the discipline of the church was loose, the\r\nclergy by no means exemplary, and their condition precarious and\r\ndependent.\r\n\r\nThe differences between Dr. Blair and Governor Nicholson led to a\r\ntedious controversy, in which charges of malfeasance in official duty\r\nand private misconduct, especially in the affair of his attachment for\r\nMiss Burwell, and his maltreatment of the Rev. Mr. Fouace, were\r\ntransmitted to the government in England, covering forty-four pages\r\nfolio of manuscript. The controversy produced no little excitement and\r\ndisturbance in the colony; a number of the clergy adhered to the\r\ngovernor, being those with whom Commissary Blair was unpopular, and whom\r\nthe governor had ingratiated by siding with them against the vestries,\r\nand by representing the commissary as less favorable to their cause.\r\nGovernor Nicholson ordered a convocation to be assembled, and during its\r\nsession held private interviews with his adherents among the clergy, who\r\nsigned a paper denying the charges made by the commissary and the\r\ncouncil. A public entertainment given to them was satirized in a ballad,\r\nsetting forth their unclerical hilarity, and depicting some of them in\r\nunfavorable colors. This ballad soon appeared in London. In this\r\nconvocation seventeen of the clergy were opposed to the commissary, and\r\nonly six in his favor. Nevertheless his integrity and indomitable\r\nperseverance and energy triumphed; and at length, upon the complaint\r\nmade by him, together with six members of the council and some of the\r\nclergy, particularly the Rev. Mr. Fouace, Colonel Nicholson was\r\nrecalled.[369:A] He ceased to be governor in August, 1705. Before\r\nentering on the government of Virginia he had been lieutenant-governor\r\nof New York under Andros, and afterwards at the head of administration\r\nfrom 1687 to 1689, when he was expelled by a popular tumult. From 1690\r\nto 1692 he was lieutenant-governor of Virginia. From 1694 to 1699 he\r\nheld the government of Maryland, where, with the zealous assistance of\r\nCommissary Bray, he busied himself in establishing Episcopacy. Returning\r\nto the government of Virginia, Governor Nicholson remained until 1705.\r\nIn the year 1710 he was appointed general and commander-in-chief of the\r\nforces sent against Fort Royal, in Acadia, which was surrendered to him.\r\nDuring the following year he headed the land force of another expedition\r\ndirected against the French in Canada. The naval force on this occasion\r\nwas commanded by the imbecile Brigadier Hill. The enterprise was corrupt\r\nin purpose, feeble in execution, and abortive in result. This failure\r\nwas attributable to the mismanagement and inefficiency of the fleet. In\r\n1713 Colonel Nicholson was governor of Nova Scotia. Having received the\r\nhonor of knighthood in 1720, Sir Francis Nicholson was appointed\r\ngovernor of South Carolina, where during four years, it is said, he\r\nconducted himself with a judicious and spirited attention to the public\r\nwelfare, and this threw a lustre over the closing scene of his long and\r\nactive career in America. Returning to England, June, 1725, he died\r\nat London in March, 1728. He is described as an adept in colonial\r\ngovernments, trained by long experience in New York, Virginia, and\r\nMaryland; brave, and not penurious, but narrow and irascible; of loose\r\nmorality, yet a fervent supporter of the church.[369:B]\r\n\r\nUpon the revocation of the edict of Nantes, by Louis the Fourteenth, in\r\n1685, more than half a million of French Protestants, called Huguenots,\r\nfled from the jaws of persecution to foreign countries. About forty\r\nthousand took refuge in England. In 1690 William the Third sent over a\r\nnumber of them to Virginia, and lands were allotted to them on James\r\nRiver. During the year 1699 another body came over, conducted by their\r\nclergyman, Claude Philippe de Richebourg. He and others were naturalized\r\nsome years afterwards. Others followed in succeeding years; the larger\r\npart of them settled at Manakintown, on the south bank of the James\r\nRiver, about twenty miles above the falls, on rich lands formerly\r\noccupied by the Monacan Indians. The rest dispersed themselves over the\r\ncountry, some on the James, some on the Rappahannock. The settlement at\r\nManakintown was erected into the parish of King William, in the County\r\nof Henrico, and exempted from taxation for many years. The refugees\r\nreceived from the king and the assembly large donations of money and\r\nprovisions; and they found in Colonel William Byrd, of Westover, a\r\ngenerous benefactor. Each settler was allowed a strip of land running\r\nback from the river to the foot of the hill. Here they raised cattle,\r\nundertook to domesticate the buffalo, manufactured cloth, and made\r\nclaret wine from wild grapes. Their settlement extended about four miles\r\nalong the river. In the centre they built a church; they conducted their\r\npublic worship after the German manner, and repeated family worship\r\nthree times a day. Manakintown was then on the frontier of Virginia, and\r\nthere was no other settlement nearer than the falls of the James River,\r\nyet the Indians do not appear to have ever molested these pious\r\nrefugees. There was no mill nearer than the mouth of Falling Creek,\r\ntwenty miles distant, and the Huguenots, having no horses, were obliged\r\nto carry their corn on their backs to the mill.\r\n\r\nMany worthy families of Virginia are descended from the Huguenots, among\r\nthem the Maurys, Fontaines, Lacys, Munfords, Flournoys, Dupuys, Duvalls,\r\nBondurants, Trents, Moncures, Ligons, and Le Grands. In the year 1714\r\nthe aggregate population of the Manakintown settlement was three\r\nhundred. The parish register of a subsequent date, in French, is\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[368:A] Memoirs of Dr. Chalmers, iv. 287, 316.\r\n\r\n[368:B] Mrs. Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronté.\r\n\r\n[369:A] Old Churches, etc., i. 158; ii. 291.\r\n\r\n[369:B] Bancroft, ii. 82.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n1702-1708.\r\n\r\n     Parishes--The Rev. Francis Makemie--Dissenters--Toleration\r\n     Act--Ministers--Commissary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year 1702 there were twenty-nine counties in Virginia, and\r\nforty-nine parishes, of which thirty-four were supplied with ministers,\r\nfifteen vacant. In each parish there was a church, of timber, brick, or\r\nstone; in the larger parishes, one or two Chapels of Ease; so that the\r\nwhole number of places of worship, for a population of sixty thousand,\r\nwas about seventy. In every parish a dwelling-house was provided for the\r\nminister, with a glebe of two hundred and fifty acres of land, and\r\nsometimes a few negroes, or a small stock of cattle. The salary of\r\nsixteen thousand pounds of tobacco was, in ordinary quality, equivalent\r\nto £80; in sweet-scented, to £160. It required the labor of twelve\r\nnegroes to produce this amount. There were in Virginia, at this time,\r\nthree Quaker congregations, and as many Presbyterian; two in Accomac\r\nunder the care of Rev. Francis Makemie; the other on Elizabeth River.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Francis Makemie, who is styled the father of the American\r\nPresbyterian Church, was settled in Accomac County before the year 1690,\r\nwhen his name first appears upon the county records. He appears to have\r\nbeen a native of the north of Ireland, being of Scotch extraction, and\r\none of those called Scotch-Irish. Licensed by the presbytery of Lagan in\r\n1680, and in two or three years ordained as an evangelist for America,\r\nhe came over, and labored in Barbadoes, Maryland, and Virginia. The\r\nfirst mention of his name on the records of the county court of Accomac\r\nbears date in 1690, by which he appears to have brought suits for debts\r\ndue him in the business of merchandise. He married Naomi, eldest\r\ndaughter of William Anderson, a wealthy merchant of Accomac, and thus\r\nacquired an independent estate. In the year 1699 he obtained from the\r\ncourt of that county a certificate of qualification as a preacher under\r\nthe toleration act, the first of the kind known to be on record in\r\nVirginia. At the same time, upon his petition, two houses belonging to\r\nhim were licensed as places of public worship.[372:A] In a letter\r\nwritten in 1710 by the presbytery of Philadelphia to that of Dublin, it\r\nis said: \"In all Virginia we have one small congregation on Elizabeth\r\nRiver, and some few families favoring our way in Rappahannock and York.\"\r\nTwo years after, the Rev. John Macky was the pastor of the Elizabeth\r\nRiver congregation. It is probable that the congregations organized by\r\nMr. Makemie, in 1690, were not able to give him a very ample support;\r\nbut, prosperous in his worldly affairs, he appears to have contributed\r\nliberally from his own means to the promotion of the religious interests\r\nin which he was engaged. According to tradition, he suffered frequent\r\nannoyances from the intolerant spirit of the times in Virginia; but he\r\ndeclared that \"he durst not deny preaching, and hoped he never should,\r\nwhile it was wanting and desired.\" Beverley, in his \"History of\r\nVirginia,\" published in 1705, says: \"They have no more than five\r\nconventicles among them, namely, three small meetings of Quakers, and\r\ntwo of Presbyterians. 'Tis observed that those counties where the\r\nPresbyterian meetings are produce very mean tobacco, and for that reason\r\ncan't get an orthodox minister to stay among them; but whenever they\r\ncould, the people very orderly went to church.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it may be inferred that the Eastern Shore, where Makemie was\r\nsettled, produced poor tobacco, and that in consequence of it there was\r\nno minister of the established church in his neighborhood. He is\r\nsupposed to have had four places of preaching; his labors proved\r\nacceptable; his hearers and congregations increased in number, and there\r\nwas a demand for other ministers of the same denomination. Mr. Makemie,\r\nabout the year 1704, returned to the mother country and remained there\r\nabout a year. During the following year two ministers, styled his\r\nassociates, were licensed, by authority of Governor Seymour, to preach\r\nin Somerset County, in Maryland, notwithstanding the opposition of the\r\nneighboring Episcopal minister. Makemie's imprisonment in New York (by\r\nLord Cornbury) for preaching in that city, and his able defence upon his\r\ntrial, are well known. He died in 1708, leaving a large estate. His\r\nlibrary was much larger than was usually possessed by Virginia clergymen\r\nin that day, and included a number of law books. He appointed the\r\nHonorable Francis Jenkins, of Somerset County, Maryland, and Mary\r\nJenkins, his lady, executors of his last will and testament, and\r\nguardians of his children.[373:A]\r\n\r\nIn 1699 a penalty of five shillings was imposed on such persons in\r\nVirginia as should not attend the parish church once in two months; but\r\ndissenters, qualified according to the toleration act of the first year\r\nof William and Mary, were exempted from this penalty, provided they\r\nshould attend at \"any congregation, or place of religious worship,\r\npermitted and allowed by the said act of parliament, once in two\r\nmonths.\"[373:B] Hening remarks of this law: \"It is surely an abuse of\r\nterms to call a law a toleration act which imposes a religious test on\r\nthe conscience, in order to avoid the penalties of another law equally\r\nviolating every principle of religious freedom. The provisions of this\r\nact may be seen in the fourth volume of Blackstone's Commentaries, page\r\n53. Nothing could be more intolerant than to impose the penalties by\r\nthis act prescribed for not repairing to church, and then to hold out\r\nthe idea of exemption, by a compliance with the provisions of such a law\r\nas the statute of 1 William and Mary, adopted by a mere general\r\nreference, when not one person in a thousand could possibly know its\r\ncontents.\" It was an age when the state of religion was low in England,\r\nand of those ministers sent over to Virginia not a few were incompetent,\r\nsome openly profligate; and religion slumbered in the languor of moral\r\nlectures, the maxims of Socrates and Seneca, and the stereotyped routine\r\nof accustomed forms. Altercations between minister and people were not\r\nunfrequent; the parson was a favorite butt for aristocratic ridicule.\r\nSometimes a pastor more exemplary than the rest was removed from\r\nmercenary motives, or on account of a faithful discharge of his duties.\r\nMore frequently the unfit were retained by popular indifference. The\r\nclergy, in effect, did not enjoy that permanent independency of the\r\npeople which properly belongs to a hierarchy. The vestry, a\r\nself-perpetuated body of twelve gentlemen, thought themselves \"the\r\nparson's master,\" and the clergy in vain deplored the precarious tenure\r\nof their livings. The commissary's powers were few, limited, and\r\ndisputed; he was but the shadow of a bishop; he could not ordain nor\r\nconfirm; he could not depose a minister. Yet the people, jealous of\r\nprelatical tyranny, watched his feeble movements with a vigilant and\r\nsuspicious eye. The church in Virginia was destitute of an effective\r\ndiscipline.[374:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[372:A] It appears from his will, dated in 1708, that he also owned a\r\nhouse and lot in the new town in Princess Anne County, on the eastern\r\nbranch of Elizabeth River, and a house and lot in the new town on\r\nWormley's Creek, called Urbanna. Whether he used these houses for\r\nmerchandise, or for public worship, is not known. It appears from\r\nCommissary Blair's report on the state of the church in Virginia, that\r\nthe congregation on Elizabeth River existed before the year 1700. From\r\nthe fact of Mr. Makemie's directing, in his will, that his\r\ndwelling-house and lot on that river should be sold, it has been\r\ninferred that he had resided there before he moved to the opposite shore\r\nof the Chesapeake, and that the church in question was gathered by him;\r\nif so, it must have been formed before 1690; for in that year he was\r\nresiding on the Eastern Shore. Others have supposed that the\r\ncongregation on Elizabeth River was composed of a small company of\r\nScotch emigrants, whose descendants are still to be found in the\r\nneighborhood of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n[373:A] Foote's Sketches of Va., first series, 40, 58, 63, 84; and\r\nForce's Historical Tracts, iv.\r\n\r\n[373:B] Hening, iii. 171.\r\n\r\n[374:A] Hawks; Bancroft; Beverley, B. iv. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n1704-1710.\r\n\r\n     Edward Nott, Lieutenant-Governor--Earl of Orkney, Titular\r\n     Governor-in-chief--Nott's Administration--Robert Hunter\r\n     appointed Lieutenant-Governor--Captured by the French--The\r\n     Rev. Samuel Sandford endows a Free School--Lord Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the 13th day of August, 1704, the Duke of Marlborough gained a\r\ncelebrated victory over the French and Bavarians at Blenheim.[375:A]\r\nDuring the same month Edward Nott came over to Virginia,\r\nlieutenant-governor under George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney, who had been\r\nappointed governor-in-chief, and from this time the office became a\r\npensionary sinecure, enjoyed by one residing in England, and who, out of\r\na salary of two thousand pounds a year, received twelve hundred. The\r\nEarl of Orkney, who enjoyed this sinecure for forty years, having\r\nentered the army in his youth, was made a colonel in 1689-90, and in\r\n1695-6 was created Earl of Orkney, in consideration of his merit and\r\ngallantry. He was present at the battles of the Boyne, Athlone,\r\nLimerick, Aghrim, Steinkirk, Lauden, Namur, and Blenheim, and was a\r\ngreat favorite of William the Third. In the first year of Queen Anne's\r\nreign he was made a major-general, and shortly after a Knight of the\r\nThistle, and served with distinction in all the wars of her reign. As\r\none of the sixteen peers of Scotland he was a member of the house of\r\nlords for many years. He married, in 1695, Elizabeth, daughter to Sir\r\nEdward Villiers, Knight, (Maid of Honor to Queen Mary,) sister to\r\nEdward, Earl of Jersey, by whom he had three daughters, Lady Anne, who\r\nmarried the Earl of Inchequin, Lady Frances, who married Sir Thomas\r\nSanderson, Knight of the Bath, Knight of the Shire of Lincoln, and\r\nbrother to the Earl of Scarborough, and Lady Harriet, married to the\r\nEarl of Orrery.\r\n\r\nNott, a mild, benevolent man, did not survive long enough to realize\r\nwhat the people hoped from his administration. In the fall after his\r\narrival he called an assembly, which concluded a general revisal of the\r\nlaws that had been long in hand. Some salutary acts went into operation,\r\nbut those relating to the church and clergy proving unacceptable to the\r\ncommissary, as encroaching on the confines of prerogative, were\r\nsuspended by the governor, and thus fell through. Governor Nott procured\r\nthe passage of an act providing for the building of a palace for the\r\ngovernor, and appropriating three thousand pounds to that object, and he\r\ndissented to an act infringing on the governor's right of appointing\r\njustices of the peace, by making the concurrence of five of the council\r\nnecessary. An act establishing the general court was afterwards\r\ndisallowed by the board of trade, because it did not recognize the\r\nappellate rights of the crown. This assembly passed a new act for the\r\nestablishment of ports and towns, \"grounding it only upon encouragements\r\naccording to her majesty's letter;\" but the Virginia merchants\r\ncomplaining against it, this measure also failed.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of Nott's administration the College of William\r\nand Mary was destroyed by fire.[376:A] The assembly had held their\r\nsessions in it for several years. Governor Nott died in August, 1706,\r\naged forty-nine years. The assembly erected a monument to his memory in\r\nthe graveyard of the church at Williamsburg. In the inscription he is\r\nstyled, \"His Excellency, Edward Nott, the late Governor of this Colony.\"\r\nIt appears that he and his successors were allowed to retain the chief\r\ntitle, as giving them more authority with the people, the Earl of Orkney\r\nbeing quite content with a part of the salary.\r\n\r\nEngland having now adopted the French policy of appointing military men\r\nfor the colonial governments, in 1708 Robert Hunter, a brigadier-general,\r\na scholar, and a wit--a friend of Addison and Swift--was appointed\r\nlieutenant-governor of Virginia; but he was captured on the voyage by\r\nthe French. Dean Swift, in January, 1708-9, writes to him, then a\r\nprisoner in Paris, that unless he makes haste to return to England and\r\nget him appointed Bishop of Virginia, he will be persuaded by Addison,\r\nnewly appointed secretary of state for Ireland, to accompany him.[377:A]\r\nTwo months later he writes to him: \"All my hopes now terminate in being\r\nmade Bishop of Virginia.\" In the year 1710 Hunter became Governor of New\r\nYork and the Jerseys, and his administration was happily conducted.\r\n\r\nSamuel Sandford, who had been some time resident in Accomac County: by\r\nhis will, dated at London in this year, he leaves a large tract of land,\r\nthe rents and profits to be appropriated to the education of the\r\nchildren of the poor. It appears probable that he had served as a\r\nminister in Accomac, and at the time of the making of his will was a\r\nminister in the County of Gloucester, England.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1709, Benedict Calvert, Lord Baltimore, abandoned the\r\nChurch of Rome and embraced Protestantism. To Charles Calvert, his son,\r\nlikewise a Protestant, the full privileges of the Maryland charter were\r\nsubsequently restored by George the First.[377:B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[375:A] In the following year appeared the first American newspaper,\r\n\"The Boston News-Letter.\"\r\n\r\n[376:A] The same disaster has recently befallen this venerable\r\ninstitution, on the 8th of February, 1859.

He was descended from the\r\nancient Scottish family of Spottiswoode. The surname is local, and was\r\nassumed by the proprietors of the lands and Barony of Spottiswoode, in\r\nthe Parish of Gordon, and County of Berwick, as soon as surnames became\r\nhereditary in Scotland. The immediate ancestor of the family was Robert\r\nde Spotswood, born during the reign of King Alexander the Third, who\r\nsucceeded to the crown of Scotland in 1249. Colonel Alexander Spotswood\r\nwas born in 1676, the year of Bacon's Rebellion, at Tangier, then an\r\nEnglish colony, in Africa, his father, Robert Spotswood, being physician\r\nto the governor, the Earl of Middleton, and the garrison there. The\r\ngrandfather of Alexander was Sir Robert Spotswood, Lord President of the\r\nCollege of Justice, and Secretary of Scotland in the time of Charles the\r\nFirst, and author of \"The Practicks of the Laws of Scotland.\" He was the\r\nsecond son of John Spotswood, or Spottiswoode, Archbishop of St.\r\nAndrews, and author of \"The History of the Church of Scotland.\" The\r\nmother of Colonel Alexander Spotswood was a widow, Catharine Elliott;\r\nhis father died at Tangier in 1688, leaving this his only child.[378:A]\r\nColonel Alexander Spotswood was bred in the army from his childhood, and\r\nuniting genius with energy, served with distinction under the Duke of\r\nMarlborough.\r\n\r\nHe was dangerously wounded in the breast by the first fire which the\r\nFrench made on the Confederates at the battle of Blenheim. He served\r\nduring the heat of that sanguinary war as deputy quartermaster-general.\r\nIn after-life, while governor of Virginia, he sometimes showed to his\r\nguests a four-pound ball that struck his coat. Blenheim Castle is\r\nrepresented in the background of a portrait of him, preserved at\r\nChelsea, in the County of King William.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Governor Spotswood in Virginia was hailed with joy,\r\nbecause he brought with him the right of Habeas Corpus--a right\r\nguaranteed to every Englishman by Magna Charta, but hitherto denied to\r\nVirginians. He entered upon the duties of his office in June, 1710. The\r\ntwo houses of the assembly severally returned thanks for an act\r\naffording them \"relief from long imprisonments,\" and appropriated\r\nupwards of two thousand pounds for completing the governor's palace. In\r\nthe following year Spotswood wrote back to England: \"This government is\r\nin perfect peace and tranquillity, under a due obedience to the royal\r\nauthority and a gentlemanly conformity to the Church of England.\" The\r\nassembly was continued by several prorogations to November, 1711. During\r\nthe summer of this year, upon an alarm of an intended French invasion of\r\nVirginia, the governor exerted himself to put the colony in the best\r\nposture of defence. Upon the convening of the assembly their jealousy of\r\nprerogative power revived, and they refused to pay the expense of\r\ncollecting the militia, or to discharge the colonial debt, because, as\r\nSpotswood informed the ministry, \"they hoped by their frugality to\r\nrecommend themselves to the populace.\" The assembly would only consent\r\nto levy twenty thousand pounds, by duties laid chiefly on British\r\nmanufactures; and notwithstanding the governor's message, they insisted\r\non giving discriminating privileges to Virginia owners of vessels in\r\npreference to British subjects proper, saying that the same exemption\r\nhad always existed. The governor declined the proffered levy, and\r\nfinding that nothing further could be obtained, dissolved the assembly,\r\nand in anticipation of an Indian war was obliged to solicit supplies\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the feuds that raged in the adjoining province of\r\nNorth Carolina, threatening to subvert all regular government there,\r\nHyde, the governor, called upon Spotswood for aid. He at first sent\r\nClayton, a man of singular prudence, to endeavor to reconcile the\r\nhostile factions. But Cary, the ringleader of the insurgents, having\r\nrefused to make terms, Spotswood ordered a detachment of militia toward\r\nthe frontier of North Carolina, while he sent a body of marines, from\r\nthe coast-guard ships, to destroy Cary's naval force. In a dispatch,\r\nSpotswood complained to Lord Dartmouth of the reluctance that he found\r\nin the inhabitants of the counties bordering on North Carolina, to march\r\nto the relief of Governor Hyde. No blood was shed upon the occasion, and\r\nCary, Porter, and other leaders in those disturbances retiring to\r\nVirginia, were apprehended by Spotswood in July, 1711, and sent\r\nprisoners to England, charged with treason. In the ensuing year Lord\r\nDartmouth addressed letters to the colonies, directing the governors to\r\nsend over no more prisoners for crimes or misdemeanors, without proof of\r\ntheir guilt.\r\n\r\nIn the Tuscarora war, commenced by a massacre on the frontier of North\r\nCarolina in September of this year, Spotswood again made an effort to\r\nrelieve that colony, and prevented the tributary Indians from joining\r\nthe enemy. He felt that little honor was to be derived from a contest\r\nwith those who fought like wild beasts, and he rather endeavored to work\r\nupon their hopes and fears by treaty. To allay the clamors of the public\r\ncreditors the governor convened the assembly in 1712, and demonstrated\r\nto them that during the last twenty-two years the permanent revenue had\r\nbeen so deficient as to require seven thousand pounds from the monarch's\r\nprivate purse to supply it. In the month of January, 1714, he at length\r\nconcluded a peace with these ferocious tribes, who had been drawn into\r\nthe contest, and, blending humanity with vigor, he taught them that\r\nwhile he could chastise their insolence he commiserated their fate.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day of November the governor, in his address to the\r\nassembly, announced the death of Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart\r\nmonarchs, and the succession of George the First, the first of the\r\nGuelfs, but maternally a grandson of James the First.\r\n\r\nThe frontier of the colony of Virginia was now undisturbed by Indian\r\nincursions, so that the expenditure was reduced to one-third of what had\r\nbeen previously required. A settlement of German Protestants had\r\nrecently been effected under the governor's auspices, in a region\r\nhitherto unpeopled, on the Rapidan.[381:A] The place settled by these\r\nGermans was called Germanna, afterwards the residence of Spotswood.\r\nThese immigrants, being countrymen of the new sovereign, could claim an\r\nadditional title to the royal favor on that account. Spotswood was at\r\nthe time endeavoring to extend the blessings of a Christian education to\r\nthe children of the Indians, and although the beneficial result of this\r\nscheme might to some appear too remote, he declared that for him it was\r\na sufficient encouragement to think that posterity might reap the\r\nbenefit of it. The Indian troubles, by which the frontier of Virginia\r\nhad of late years suffered so much, the governor attributed mainly to\r\nthe clandestine trade carried on with them by unprincipled men. The same\r\nevil has continued down to the present day. In the before-mentioned\r\naddress to the assembly, Spotswood informed them that since their\r\npreceding session he had received a supply of ammunition, arms, and\r\nother necessaries of war, sent out by the late Queen Anne.\r\n\r\nDuring eleven years, from 1707 to 1718, while other colonies were\r\nburdened with taxation for extrinsic purposes, Virginia steadily adhered\r\nto a system of rigid economy, and during that interval eighty-three\r\npounds of tobacco per poll was the sum-total levied by all acts of\r\nassembly.[381:B] The Virginians now began to scrutinize, with a jealous\r\neye, the circumstances of the government, and the assembly \"held itself\r\nentitled to all the rights and privileges of an English parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThe act of 1642, reserving the right of presentation to the parish, the\r\nlicense of the Bishop of London, and the recommendation of the governor,\r\navailed but little against the popular will, and there were not more\r\nthan four inducted ministers in the colony. Republicanism was thus\r\nfinding its way even into the church, and vestries were growing\r\nindependent. The parish sometimes neglected to receive the minister;\r\nsometimes received but did not present him, the custom being to employ a\r\nminister by the year. In 1703 it was decided that the minister was an\r\nincumbent for life, and could not be displaced by the parish, but the\r\nvestries, by preventing his induction, excluded him from acquiring a\r\nfreehold in his living, and he might be removed at pleasure. The\r\nministers were not always men who could win the esteem of the people or\r\ncommand their respect. The Virginia parishes were so extensive that\r\nparishioners sometimes lived at the distance of fifty miles from the\r\nparish church, and the assembly would not augment the taxes by narrowing\r\nthe bounds of the parishes, even to avoid the dangers of \"paganism,\r\natheism, or sectaries.\" Schism was threatening \"to creep into the\r\nchurch, and to generate faction in the civil government.\"[382:A] \"In\r\nVirginia,\" says the Rev. Hugh Jones,[382:B] \"there is no ecclesiastical\r\ncourt, so that vice, profaneness, and immorality are not suppressed. The\r\npeople hate the very name of bishop's court.\" \"All which things,\" he\r\nadds, \"make it absolutely necessary for a bishop to be settled there, to\r\npave the way for mitres in English America.\"\r\n\r\nThere is preserved the record of the trial of Grace Sherwood, in the\r\nCounty of Princess Anne, for witchcraft. Being put in the water, with\r\nher hands bound, she was found to swim. A jury of old women having\r\nexamined her, reported that \"she was not like them.\" She was ordered by\r\nthe court to be secured \"by irons, or otherwise,\" in jail for farther\r\ntrial. The picturesque inlet where she was put in the water is still\r\nknown as \"Witch Duck.\" The custom of nailing horse-shoes to the doors to\r\nkeep out witches is not yet entirely obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians at this time were deterred from sending their children\r\nacross the Atlantic to be educated, through fear of the smallpox.[382:C]\r\n\r\nFrom the statistics of the year 1715, it appears that Virginia was, in\r\npopulation second only to Massachusetts,[383:A] which exceeded her in\r\ntotal number by one thousand, and in the number of whites by twenty-two\r\nthousand. All the colonies were at this time slave-holding; the seven\r\nNorthern ones comprising an aggregate of 12,150 slaves, and the four\r\nSouthern ones 46,700. The proportion of whites to negroes in Virginia\r\nwas upwards of four to one. Their condition was one of rather rigorous\r\nservitude. The number of Africans imported into Virginia during the\r\nreign of George the First was upwards of ten thousand. In addition to\r\nthe slaves, the Virginians had three kinds of white servants,--some\r\nhired in the ordinary way; others, called kids, bound by indenture for\r\nfour or five years; the third class consisted of convicts. The two\r\ncolonies, Virginia and Maryland, supplied the mother country, in\r\nexchange for her manufactures, with upwards of twenty-five millions of\r\npounds of tobacco, of which there were afterwards exported more than\r\nseventeen millions, leaving for internal consumption more than eight\r\nmillions. Besides the revenue which Great Britain derived from this\r\nsource, in a commercial point of view, Virginia and Maryland were at\r\nthis period of more consequence to the fatherland than all the other\r\nnine colonies combined. Virginia exchanged her corn, lumber, and salted\r\nprovisions, for the sugar, rum, and wine of the West Indies and the\r\nAzores.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[378:A] Douglas's Peerage of Scotland; Burke's Landed Gentry of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, ii., Art.

Mr. Griffin,\r\n     Teacher--Governor Spotswood visits Christanna--Description of\r\n     the School and of the Saponey Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SPOTSWOOD, who was a proficient in the mathematics, built the\r\nOctagon Magazine, rebuilt the College, and made improvements in the\r\ngovernor's house and gardens. He was an excellent judge on the bench. At\r\nhis instance a grant of £1000 was made by the governors and visitors of\r\nWilliam and Mary College in 1718, and a fund was established for\r\ninstructing Indian children in Christianity,[384:A] and he erected a\r\nschool for that purpose on the southern frontier, at fort Christanna,\r\nestablished on the south side of the Meherrin River, in what is now\r\nSouthampton County.[384:B] This fort, built on a rising ground, was a\r\npentagon enclosure of palisades, and instead of bastions, there were\r\nfive houses, which defended each other; each side of the fort being\r\nabout one hundred yards long. It was mounted with five cannon, and had a\r\ngarrison of twelve men. The Rev. Charles Griffin had charge of the\r\nschool here, being employed, in 1715, by Governor Spotswood to teach the\r\nIndian children, and to bring them to Christianity. The Rev. Hugh\r\nJones[384:C] says that he had seen there \"seventy-seven Indian children\r\nat school at a time, at the governor's sole expense, I think.\" This\r\nappears to be a mistake. The school-house was built at the expense of\r\nthe Indian Company.[384:D] They were taught the English tongue, and to\r\nrepeat the catechism, and to read the Bible and Common Prayers, and to\r\nwrite. These some of them learned tolerably well. The majority of them\r\ncould repeat the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and Ten Commandments, behaved\r\nreverently at prayers, and made the responses. The Indians became so\r\nfond of this worthy missionary, that they would sometimes lift him up in\r\ntheir arms; and they would have chosen him chief of their tribe, the\r\nSaponeys. They alone remained steadfastly at peace with the whites. They\r\nnumbered about two hundred persons, and lived within musket-shot of Fort\r\nChristanna. They had recently been governed by a queen, but she dying\r\nthey were now governed by twelve old men. When Governor Spotswood\r\nvisited them in April, 1716, these old men waited on him at the Fort,\r\nand laid several skins at his feet, all bowing to him simultaneously.\r\nThey complained through their interpreter of fifteen of their young men\r\nhaving been surprised, and murdered, by the Genitoes, and desired the\r\ngovernor's assistance in warring against them until they killed as many\r\nof them. They governor agreed that they might revenge themselves, and\r\nthat he would furnish them with ammunition. He also made restitution to\r\nthem for losses which they complained they had suffered by being cheated\r\nby the English. Sixty young men next made their appearance with feathers\r\nin their hair and run through their ears, their faces painted with blue\r\nand vermilion, their hair cut in fantastic forms, some looking like a\r\ncock's-comb; and they had blue and red blankets wrapped around them.\r\nThis was their war-dress, and it made them look like furies. They made\r\nno speech. Next came the young women with long, straight, black hair\r\nreaching down to the waist, with a blanket tied round them, and hanging\r\ndown like a petticoat. Most of them had nothing to cover them from the\r\nwaist upwards; but some wore a mantle over the shoulders, made of two\r\ndeer-skins sewed together. These Indians greased their bodies and heads\r\nwith bear's oil, which, with the smoke of their cabins, gave them a\r\ndisagreeable odor. They were very modest and faithful to their husbands.\r\n\"They are straight and well-limbed, of good shape and extraordinary good\r\nfeatures, as well the men as the women. They look wild, and are mighty\r\nshy of an Englishman, and will not let you touch them.\"[385:A]\r\n\r\nThe Saponey town was situated on the bank of the Meherrin, the houses\r\nall joining one another and making a circle. This circle could be\r\nentered by three passages, each about six feet wide. All the doors are\r\non the inside of the circle, and the level area within was common for\r\nthe diversion of the people. In the centre was a large stump of a tree,\r\non which the head men stood when making a speech. The women bound their\r\ninfants to a board cut in the shape of the child; the top of the board\r\nwas round, and there was a hole for a string, by which it is hung to the\r\nlimb of a tree, or to a pin in a post, and there swings and diverts\r\nhimself out of harm's way. The Saponeys lived as lazily and as miserably\r\nas any people in the world. The boys with their bows shot at the eye of\r\nan axe, set up at twenty yards distance, and the governor rewarded their\r\nskill with knives and looking-glasses. They also danced the war-dance;\r\nafter which the governor treated them to a luncheon, which they devoured\r\nwith animal avidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[384:A] Keith's Hist of Va., 173.\r\n\r\n[384:B] Huguenot Family, 271, and map opposite page 357.

Robert Beverley, in the\r\npreface to the second edition of his \"History of Virginia,\" published at\r\nLondon in 1722, says: \"I was with the present governor[387:A] at the\r\nhead-spring of both those rivers,[387:B] and their fountains are in the\r\nhighest ridge of mountains.\" The governor, accompanied by John Fontaine,\r\nwho had been an ensign in the British army, and who had recently come\r\nover to Virginia, started from Williamsburg, on his expedition over the\r\nAppalachian Mountains, as they were then called. Having crossed the York\r\nRiver at the Brick-house, they lodged that night at the seat of Austin\r\nMoore, now Chelsea, on the Matapony River, a few miles above its\r\njunction with the Pamunkey. On the following night they were hospitably\r\nentertained by Robert Beverley, the historian, at his residence in\r\nMiddlesex. The governor left his chaise there, and mounted his horse for\r\nthe rest of the journey; and Beverley accompanied him in the\r\nexploration. Proceeding along the Rappahannock they came to the\r\nGermantown, ten miles below the falls, where they halted for some days.\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of August Spotswood was joined here by several\r\ngentlemen, two small companies of rangers, and four Meherrin Indians.\r\nThe gentlemen of the party appear to have been Spotswood, Fontaine,\r\nBeverley, Colonel Robertson, Austin Smith, who returned home owing to a\r\nfever, Todd, Dr. Robinson, Taylor, Mason, Brooke, and Captains Clouder\r\nand Smith. The whole number of the party, including gentlemen, rangers,\r\npioneers, Indians, and servants, was probably about fifty. They had\r\nwith them a large number of riding and pack-horses, an abundant supply\r\nof provisions, and an extraordinary variety of liquors. Having had their\r\nhorses shod, they left Germantown on the twenty-ninth of August, and\r\nencamped that night three miles from Germanna. The camps were named\r\nrespectively after the gentlemen of the expedition, the first one being\r\ncalled \"Camp Beverley,\" where \"they made great fires, supped, and drank\r\ngood punch.\"\r\n\r\nAroused in the morning by the trumpet, they proceeded westward, each day\r\nbeing diversified by the incidents and adventures of exploration. Some\r\nof the party encountered hornets; others were thrown from their horses;\r\nothers killed rattlesnakes. Deer and bears were shot, and the venison\r\nand bear-meat were roasted before the fire upon wooden forks. At night\r\nthey lay on the boughs of trees under tents. At the head of the\r\nRappahannock they admired the rich virgin soil, the luxuriant grass, and\r\nthe heavy timber of primitive forests. Thirty-six days after Spotswood\r\nhad set out from Williamsburg, and on the fifth day of September, 1716,\r\na clear day, at about one o'clock, he and his party, after a toilsome\r\nascent, reached the top of the mountain. It is difficult to ascertain at\r\nwhat point they ascended, but probably it was Swift Run Gap.\r\n\r\nAs the company wound along, in perspective caravan line, through the\r\nshadowy defiles, the trumpet for the first time awoke the echoes of the\r\nmountains, and from the summit Spotswood and his companions beheld with\r\nrapture the boundless panorama that lay spread out before them, far as\r\nthe eye could reach, robed in misty splendor. Here they drank the health\r\nof King George the First, and all the royal family. The highest summit\r\nwas named by Spotswood Mount George, in honor of his majesty, and the\r\ngentlemen of the expedition, in honor of the governor, named the next in\r\nheight, Mount Spotswood, according to Fontaine, and Mount Alexander,\r\naccording to the Rev. Hugh Jones.[388:A] The explorers were on the\r\nwater-shed, two streams rising there, the one flowing eastward and the\r\nother westward. Several of the company were desirous of returning, but\r\nthe governor persuaded them to continue on. Descending the western side\r\nof the mountain, and proceeding about seven miles farther, they reached\r\nthe Shenandoah, which they called the Euphrates, and encamped by the\r\nside of it. They observed trees blazed by the Indians, and the tracks of\r\nelks and buffaloes, and their lairs. They noticed a vine bearing a sort\r\nof wild cucumber, and a shrub with a fruit like the currant, and ate\r\nvery good wild grapes. This place was called Spotswood Camp. The river\r\nwas found fordable at one place, eighty yards wide in the narrowest\r\npart, and running north. It was here that the governor undertook to\r\nengrave the king's name on a rock, and not on Mount George.\r\n\r\nFinding a ford they crossed the river, and this was the extreme point\r\nwhich the governor reached westward. Recrossing the river, some of the\r\nparty using grasshoppers for bait, caught perch and chub fish; others\r\nwent a hunting and killed deer and turkeys. Fontaine carved his name on\r\na tree by the river-side; and the governor buried a bottle with a paper\r\ninclosed, on which he wrote that he took possession for King George the\r\nFirst of England. Dining here they fired volleys, and drank healths,\r\nthey having on this occasion a variety of liquors--Virginia red wine\r\nand white wine, Irish usquebaugh, brandy, shrub, two kinds of rum,\r\nchampagne, canary, cherry punch, cider, etc. On the seventh the rangers\r\nproceeded on a farther exploration, and the rest of the company set out\r\non their return homeward. Governor Spotswood arrived at Williamsburg\r\non the seventeenth of September, after an absence of about six weeks.\r\nThe distance which they had gone was reckoned two hundred and\r\nnineteen miles, and the whole, going and returning, four hundred and\r\nthirty-eight. \"For this expedition,\" says the Rev. Hugh Jones, \"they\r\nwere obliged to provide a great quantity of horseshoes, things seldom\r\nused in the eastern parts of Virginia, where there are no stones. Upon\r\nwhich account the governor upon his return presented each of his\r\ncompanions with a golden horseshoe, some of which I have seen covered\r\nwith valuable stones resembling heads of nails, with the inscription on\r\none side, 'Sic juvat transcendere montes.' This he instituted to\r\nencourage gentlemen to venture backward and make discoveries and\r\nsettlements, any gentleman being entitled to wear this golden horseshoe\r\non the breast who could prove that he had drank his majesty's health on\r\nMount George.\" Spotswood instituted the Tramontane Order for this\r\npurpose; but it appears to have soon fallen through. According to\r\nChalmers, the British government penuriously refused to pay the cost of\r\nthe golden horseshoes. A novel called the \"Knight of the Horseshoe,\" by\r\nDr. William A. Caruthers, derives its name and subject from Spotswood's\r\nexploit.[390:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[387:A] Spotswood.\r\n\r\n[387:B] York and Rappahannock.\r\n\r\n[388:A] He says that Spotswood graved the king's name on a rock on Mount\r\nGeorge; but, according to Fontaine, \"the governor had graving-irons, but\r\ncould not grave anything, the stones were so hard.\"\r\n\r\n[390:A] Memoirs of a Huguenot Family, 281, 292; Introduction to\r\nRandolph's edition of Beverley's Hist. of Va., 5; Rev. Hugh Jones'\r\nPresent State of Virginia. The miniature horseshoe that had belonged to\r\nSpotswood, according to a descendant of his, the late Mrs. Susan Bott,\r\nof Petersburg, who had seen it, was small enough to be worn on a\r\nwatch-chain. Some of them were set with jewels. One of these horseshoes\r\nis said to be still preserved in the family of Brooke. A bit of colored\r\nglass, apparently the stopper of a small bottle, with a horseshoe\r\nstamped on it, was dug up some years ago in the yard at Chelsea, in King\r\nWilliam County, the residence of Governor Spotswood's eldest daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\n1715-1718.\r\n\r\n     Condition of the Colonies--South Carolina appeals to Virginia\r\n     for Succor against the Indians--Proceedings of the Council and\r\n     the Assembly--Disputes between them--Dissensions of Governor\r\n     and Burgesses--He dissolves them--Blackbeard, the Pirate--\r\n     Maynard's Engagement with him--His Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE twenty-five counties of the Ancient Dominion were under a government\r\nconsisting of a governor and twelve councillors appointed by the king,\r\nand fifty burgesses elected by the freeholders. The permanent revenue,\r\nestablished at the restoration, now amounted to four thousand pounds\r\nsterling, and this sum proving inadequate to the public expenditure,\r\nthe deficit was eked out by three hundred pounds drawn from the\r\nquit-rents--private property of the king. Relieved from the dangers of\r\nIndian border warfare, and blessed with the able administration of\r\nGovernor Spotswood, Virginia, under the tranquil reign of the first\r\nGeorge, advanced in commerce, population, wealth, and power, more\r\nrapidly than any of her sister colonies.\r\n\r\nA few of the principal families affected to establish an aristocracy or\r\noligarchy, and Spotswood, at his first arrival, discovered that it\r\nwas necessary \"to have a balance on the Bench and the Board.\" He\r\nsubsequently warned the ministers, \"that a party was so encouraged by\r\ntheir success in removing former governors, that they are resolved no\r\none shall sit easy who doth not entirely submit to their dictates; this\r\nis the case at present, and will continue, unless a stop is put to their\r\ngrowing power, to whom not any one particular governor, but government\r\nitself, is equally disagreeable.\"\r\n\r\nAt a council held at Williamsburg on the 26th day of May, 1715, the\r\ngovernor presented a letter, received by express, from Governor Craven,\r\nof South Carolina, representing the deplorable condition of that colony\r\nfrom the murderous inroads of the Indians, the several tribes having\r\nconfederated together and threatened the total destruction of the\r\ninhabitants, and requesting a supply of arms and ammunition. The council\r\nunanimously agreed to the request, and, conceiving that Virginia was\r\nalso in imminent danger of invasion, desired the Indian Company to\r\ntake from the magazine so much ammunition as was necessary for South\r\nCarolina, and to return the same \"by the first conveniency, that so this\r\ncolony may not be unprovided for its necessary defence.\" It was further\r\nordered, that the governors of Maryland, New York, and New England, be\r\nexhorted to send ships of war to Charleston, and that the governor of\r\nSouth Carolina be invited to send hither their women and children, and\r\nsuch other persons as are useless in the war. Three pieces of cannon\r\nwere sent to Christanna, and ammunition to Germanna, these being the two\r\nfrontier settlements. Colonel Nathaniel Harrison was empowered to disarm\r\nthe Nottoway Indians.\r\n\r\nIn June, upon the application of the governor of North Carolina for\r\npreventing the inhabitants of that province from deserting it in that\r\ntime of danger, a proclamation was issued by Governor Spotswood ordering\r\nall persons coming thence, without a passport, to be arrested and sent\r\nback.\r\n\r\nA letter from the governor of South Carolina, brought by Arthur\r\nMiddleton, Esq., requested assistance of men from Virginia. South\r\nCarolina proposed, in order to pay the men, to send to Virginia slaves\r\nto the number of the volunteers, to work on the plantations for their\r\nbenefit. The council unanimously resolved to comply with the request,\r\nand to defray the charges incurred until the men should arrive in South\r\nCarolina, and for this purpose the governor and council agreed to\r\npostpone the payment of their own salaries. It was ordered that a party\r\nof Nottoway and Meherrin Indians should be sent to the assistance of the\r\nSouth Carolinians. An assembly was summoned to meet on the third of\r\nAugust. The duty of five pounds on slaves imported was suspended for the\r\nbenefit of planters sending their slaves from South Carolina to Virginia\r\nas a place of safety. The contract entered into on this occasion between\r\nthe two provinces, for the raising of forces, was styled \"A treaty made\r\nbetween this government and the Province of South Carolina.\" Early in\r\nJuly, Spotswood dispatched a number of men and arms.\r\n\r\nThe king of the Saran Indians visited Williamsburg, and agreed to bring\r\nchiefs of the Catawbas and Cherokees to treat of peace, and to aid in\r\ncutting off the Yamasees and other enemies of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe assembly met on the 3d of August, 1715, being the first year of the\r\nreign of George the First. The members of the council were Robert\r\nCarter, James Blair, Philip Ludwell, John Smith, John Lewis, William\r\nCocke, Nathaniel Harrison, Mann Page, and Robert Porteus, Esquires.\r\nDaniel McCarty, Esq., of Westmoreland, was elected speaker of the house\r\nof burgesses. The governor announced in his speech that the object of\r\nthe session was to secure Virginia against the murders, massacres, and\r\ntortures of Indian invasion, and to succor South Carolina in her\r\ndistress, and he made known his desire to treat with the Indian chiefs\r\nwho were expected, at the head of a body of men, on the frontiers. The\r\nburgesses expressed their hope that as the people of Virginia were so\r\nunable to afford supplies, the king would supply the deficiency out of\r\nhis quit-rents, and requested further information as to the treaty made\r\nwith South Carolina, and the aid required. A bill was introduced in the\r\nhouse for amending an act for preventing frauds in tobacco payments, and\r\nimproving the staple. The burgesses requested the governor's assistance\r\nin arresting Richard Littlepage and Thomas Butts, who defied their\r\nauthority. It appears that these gentlemen, being justices of the peace,\r\nsitting in the court of claims, in which the people presented their\r\ngrievances, had refused to certify some such as being false and\r\nseditious. The governor refused to aid in enforcing the warrant. The\r\nhouse sent up a bill making a small appropriation for the succor of\r\nSouth Carolina, but clogged with the repeal of parts of the tobacco act,\r\nand the council rejected it, \"the tacking things of a different nature\r\nto a money bill\" being \"an encroachment on the privileges of the\r\ncouncil.\"\r\n\r\nA controversy next ensued between the council and the house as to the\r\npower of redressing the grievances of the people. A dispute also\r\noccurred between the governor and the burgesses relative to the removal\r\nof the court of James City County from Jamestown to Williamsburg. The\r\ngovernor said: \"After five years' residence upon the borders of James\r\nCity County, I think it hard I may not be allowed to be as good a judge\r\nas Mr. Marable's rabble, of a proper place for the court-house.\"\r\n\r\nThe burgesses declared their sympathy with the suffering Carolinians,\r\nbut insisted upon the extreme poverty of the people of Virginia, and so\r\nexcused themselves for clogging the appropriation bill with the repeal\r\nof parts of the tobacco act, their object being by one act to relieve\r\nVirginia and succor Carolina. Governor Spotswood, in his reply,\r\nremarked: \"When you speak of poverty and engagements, you argue as if\r\nyou knew the state of your own country no better than you do that of\r\nothers, for as I, that have had the honor to preside for some years past\r\nover this government, do positively deny that any public engagements\r\nhave drawn any more wealth out of this colony than what many a single\r\nperson in it has on his own account expended in the time, so I do assert\r\nthat there is scarce a country of its figure in the Christian world less\r\nburdened with public taxes. If yourselves sincerely believe that it is\r\nreduced to the last degree of poverty, I wonder the more that you should\r\nreject propositions for lessening the charges of assemblies; that you\r\nshould expel gentlemen out of your house for only offering to serve\r\ntheir counties upon their own expense, and that while each day of your\r\nsitting is so costly to your country, you should spend time so\r\nfruitlessly, for now, after a session of twenty-five days, three bills\r\nonly have come from your house, and even some of these framed as if you\r\ndid not expect they should pass into acts.\"\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day of September the council sent to the burgesses a\r\nreview of some of their resolutions reflecting upon them, and the\r\ngovernor, and the preceding assembly. This review is able and severe. On\r\nthis day the governor dissolved the assembly, after a speech no less\r\nable, and still more severe. After animadverting upon the proceedings of\r\nthe house at length, and paying a high tribute to the merit of the\r\ncouncil, the governor concludes thus:--[394:A]\r\n\r\n     \"But to be plain with you, the true interest of your country\r\n     is not what you have troubled your heads about. All your\r\n     proceedings have been calculated to answer the notions of the\r\n     ignorant populace, and if you can excuse yourselves to them,\r\n     you matter not how you stand before God, your prince, and all\r\n     judicious men, or before any others to whom you think you owe\r\n     not your elections. The new short method you have fallen upon\r\n     to clear your conduct by your own resolves, will prove the\r\n     censure to be just, for I appeal to all rational men who shall\r\n     read the assembly journals, as well of the last session as of\r\n     this, whether some of your resolves of your house of the\r\n     second instant are not as wide from truth and fair reasoning\r\n     as others are from good manners. In fine, I cannot but\r\n     attribute these miscarriages to the people's mistaken choice\r\n     of a set of representatives, whom Heaven has not generally\r\n     endowed with the ordinary qualifications requisite to\r\n     legislators, for I observe that the grand ruling party in your\r\n     house has not furnished chairmen for two of your standing\r\n     committees[395:A] who can spell English or write common sense,\r\n     as the grievances under their own handwriting will manifest.\r\n     And to keep such an assembly on foot would be the discrediting\r\n     a country that has many able and worthy gentlemen in it. And\r\n     therefore I now dissolve you.\"\r\n\r\nThese proceedings throw light on the practical working of the colonial\r\ngovernment, of the vigorous and haughty spirit of Spotswood, who was not\r\nsurpassed in ability or in character by any of the colonial governors,\r\nand of the liberty-loving but factious house of burgesses. They also\r\nexhibit the critical condition of South Carolina, and the imminent\r\ndanger of Virginia at that period. On this last point Chalmers fell into\r\nan error, in stating that the Indians then had ceased to be objects of\r\ndread in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe assembly, as has been seen, expelled two burgesses for serving\r\nwithout compensation, which they stigmatized as tantamount to\r\nbribery--thus seeming indirectly to charge bribery upon the members of\r\nthe British house of commons, who receive no per diem compensation.\r\nAfter five weeks spent in fruitless altercations, Spotswood, conceiving\r\nthe assembly to be actuated by factious motives, dissolved them with\r\nharsh and contemptuous expressions, offending the spirit of the\r\nburgesses. He had previously wounded the pride of the council, long the\r\noligarchy of the Old Dominion, when \"colonel, and member of his\r\nmajesty's council of Virginia,\" was a sort of provincial title of\r\nnobility. Frequent anonymous letters were now transmitted to England,\r\ninveighing against Spotswood. While the board of trade commended his\r\ngeneral conduct, they reproved him for the offensive language which he\r\nhad used in his speech to the burgesses, \"who, though mean, ignorant\r\npeople, and did not comply with his desires, ought not to have been\r\nirritated by sharp expressions, which may not only incense them, but\r\neven their electors.\" In other points, Spotswood vindicated himself with\r\nvigor and success, and he insisted \"that some men are always\r\ndissatisfied, like the tories, if they are not allowed to govern; men\r\nwho look upon every one not born in the country as a foreigner.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1717, the ancient laws of the colony were revised, the acts of\r\n1663, for preventing the recovery of foreign debts, and prohibiting the\r\nassemblage of Quakers, and that of 1676, (one of Bacon's laws,)\r\nexcluding from office all persons who had not resided for three years in\r\nVirginia, were repealed by the king.\r\n\r\nJohn Teach, a pirate, commonly called Blackbeard, in the year 1718\r\nestablished his rendezvous at the mouth of Pamlico River, in North\r\nCarolina. He surrendered himself to Governor Eden, (who was suspected of\r\nbeing in collusion with him,) and took the oath of allegiance, in order\r\nto avail himself of a proclamation of pardon offered by the king.\r\nWasting the fruits of sea-robbery in gambling and debauchery, Blackbeard\r\nagain embarked in piracy; and having captured and brought in a valuable\r\ncargo, the Carolinians gave notice of it to the government of Virginia.\r\nSpotswood and the assembly immediately proclaimed a large reward for his\r\napprehension, and Lieutenant Maynard, attached to a ship-of-war\r\nstationed in the Chesapeake Bay, was sent with two small vessels and a\r\nchosen crew in quest of him. An action ensued in Pamlico Bay on the 21st\r\nof November, 1718. Blackbeard, it is said, had posted one of his men\r\nwith a lighted match over the powder-magazine, to prevent a capture by\r\nblowing up his vessel, but if so, this order failed to be executed.\r\nBlackbeard, surrounded by the slain, and bleeding from his wounds, in\r\nthe act of cocking a pistol, fell on the bloody deck and expired. His\r\nsurviving comrades surrendered, and Maynard returned with his prisoners\r\nto James River, with Blackbeard's head hanging from the bowsprit. The\r\ncaptured pirates were tried in the admiralty court at Williamsburg,\r\nMarch, 1718, and thirteen of them were hung. Benjamin Franklin, then an\r\napprentice in a printing-office, composed a ballad on the death of\r\nTeach, which was sung through the streets of Boston.[397:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[394:A] Extracts from Journal of the Council of Virginia, sitting as the\r\nupper house of assembly, preserved in the office of the Secretary of the\r\nCommonwealth, in _S.

It was unfortunate that the Commissary's\r\nposition involved him in these political squabbles: he would have been,\r\ndoubtless, more usefully employed in those spiritual functions which\r\nwere his proper sphere, and which he adorned. The governor lamented to\r\nthe board of trade \"how much anonymous obloquy had been cast upon his\r\ncharacter, in order to accomplish the designs of a party, which, by\r\ntheir success in removing other governors, are so far encouraged, that\r\nthey are resolved no one shall sit easy who doth not resign his duty,\r\nhis reason, and his honor to the government of their maxims and\r\ninterests.\" The domineering ambition of the council was long the\r\nfruitful source of mischiefs to Virginia; and it is on this account that\r\nmany of the complaints and accusations against the governors are to be\r\nreceived with many grains of allowance. The twelve members of the\r\ncouncil had a negative upon the governor's acts; they were members of\r\nthe assembly, judges of the highest court, and held command of the\r\nmilitia as county lieutenants. Stith, in his \"History of Virginia,\"\r\ncomplains of their overweening power, and expresses his apprehensions\r\nof its evil consequences.\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 1692, William the Third had appointed Neal\r\npostmaster for the Northern Colonies, with authority to establish posts.\r\nThe rates being afterwards fixed by act of parliament, the system was\r\nintroduced into Virginia in the year 1718, and Spotswood wrote to the\r\nboard of trade, that \"the people were made to believe that the\r\nparliament could not lay any tax (for so they call the rates of postage)\r\non them without the consent of the general assembly. This gave a handle\r\nfor framing some grievance against the new office; and thereupon a bill\r\nwas passed by both council and burgesses, which, though it acknowledged\r\nthe act of parliament to be in force in Virginia, doth effectually\r\nprevent its ever being put in execution; whence your lordships may judge\r\nhow well affected the major part of the assemblymen are toward the\r\ncollection of this branch of the revenue.\" The act, nevertheless, was\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nThe assembly refused to pass measures recommended by the governor;\r\ninvaded his powers by investing the county courts with the appointment\r\nof their own clerks; endeavored, as has been seen, to render inoperative\r\nthe new post-office system, and transmitted an address to the king,\r\npraying that the instruction which required that no acts should be\r\npassed affecting the British commerce or navigation without a clause of\r\nsuspension, might be recalled, and that the governor's power of\r\nappointing judges of oyer and terminer should be limited; and they\r\ncomplained that the governor's attempts went to the subversion of the\r\nconstitution, since he made daily encroachments on their ancient rights.\r\nThe governor, perceiving that it was the design of his opponents to\r\nprovoke him, and then make a handle of the ebullitions of his\r\nresentment, displayed moderation as well as ability in these disputes,\r\nand when the assembly had completed their charges, prorogued them. This\r\neffervescence of ill humor excited a reaction in favor of Spotswood, and\r\nin a short time addresses poured in from the clergy, the college, and\r\nmost of the counties, reprobating the factious conduct of the\r\nlegislature, and expressing the public happiness under an administration\r\nwhich had raised the colony from penury to prosperity. Meantime Colonel\r\nByrd, who had been sent out to London as colonial agent, having rather\r\nfailed in his efforts against Spotswood, begged the board of trade \"to\r\nrecommend forgiveness and moderation to both parties.\" The\r\nrecommendation, enforced by the advice of Lord Orkney, the\r\ngovernor-in-chief, the Duke of Argyle, and other great men who\r\npatronized Spotswood, quieted these discords; and the governor, the\r\ncouncil, and the burgesses now united harmoniously in promoting the\r\npublic welfare.\r\n\r\nThe chief apple of discord between the governor and the Virginians was\r\nthe old question relating to the powers of the vestry. About this time\r\nGovernor Spotswood was engaged in a warm dispute with the vestry of St.\r\nAnne's Parish, Essex, in which he took very high ground. The Rev. Hugh\r\nJones subsequently, while on a visit in England, reported to the Bishop\r\nof London some things against the rubrical exactness of Commissary\r\nBlair. Evil reports had also reached the mother country as to the moral\r\ncharacter of some of the clergy. A convention of the Virginia clergy\r\nwas, therefore, held in compliance with the direction of the Bishop of\r\nLondon, at the College of William and Mary, in April, 1719. The\r\ngovernor, in a letter addressed to this body, assails the commissary as\r\ndenying \"that the king's government has the right to collate ministers\r\nto ecclesiastical benefices within this colony,\" \"deserting the cause of\r\nthe church,\" and countenancing disorders in divine worship \"destructive\r\nto the establishment of the church.\" To all this, Commissary Blair made\r\na reply, vindicating himself triumphantly.[400:A] He appears to have\r\nsympathized on these matters with the vestries and the people. Governor\r\nSpotswood, on the contrary, was an extreme high churchman and supporter\r\nof royal prerogative, as might have been expected from the descendant of\r\na long line of ancestors always found arrayed on the side of the crown,\r\nand the church as established, and never with the people. The journal of\r\nthis convocation throws much light on the condition of the church and\r\nthe clergy of Virginia at that time. The powers exercised by the\r\nvestries, indeed, often made the position of the clergy precarious; but\r\nit would, perhaps, have engendered far greater evils if the governor\r\nhad been allowed to be the patron of all the livings. Governor\r\nSpotswood's letter to the vestry of St. Anne's presents an elaborate\r\nargument against the right of the vestry to appoint or remove the\r\nminister; but, notwithstanding the opposition of the governor, bishop,\r\nclergy, and crown, the vestries and the people still steadfastly\r\nmaintained this right. This question was the embryo of the revolution;\r\npolitical freedom is the offspring of religious freedom; it takes its\r\nrise in the church.\r\n\r\nIn answer to an inquiry made by the Bishop of London, the convention\r\nvoted \"that no member had any personal knowledge of the irregularity of\r\nany clergyman's life in this colony,\" a manifest equivocation.[401:A] In\r\ntheir address to the Bishop of London, the convention state that all the\r\nministers in Virginia are episcopally ordained, except Mr. Commissary,\r\nof whose ordination a major part doubt;[401:B] that the circumstances of\r\nthe country will not permit them to conform to the established liturgy\r\nas they would desire; that owing to the extent of the parishes they have\r\nservice but once on Sunday, and but one sermon; that for the same reason\r\nthe dead are not buried in churchyards, and the burial-service is\r\nusually performed by a layman; that the people observe no holidays\r\nexcept Christmas-day and Good Friday, being unwilling to leave their\r\ndaily labor; and that of necessity the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is\r\nadministered to persons who are not confirmed; that the ministers are\r\nobliged to baptize, and church women, marry, and bury at private houses,\r\nadminister the Lord's Supper to a single sick person, perform in church\r\nthe office of both sacraments without the habits, ornaments, and vessels\r\nrequired by the liturgy. The convention press upon his lordship's\r\nattention the precarious tenure of their livings, to which many of these\r\ndeviations from the liturgy were attributable; they declare that the\r\npeople are adverse to the induction of the clergy, which exposes them to\r\nthe great oppression of the vestries. The clergy refer to Governor\r\nSpotswood as, under God, their chief support, whose efforts in their\r\nbehalf were, as alleged by the governor, opposed by some of the council\r\nand Commissary Blair, who was himself accused of some irregularities.\r\n\r\nThe convention also stated that the commissary found great difficulty\r\nin making visitations, owing to the refusal of church wardens to take\r\nthe official oath, or to make presentments, and from \"the general\r\naversion of the people to everything that looks like a spiritual court.\"\r\nThe commissary refused to subscribe to it. The contending parties in\r\nthese disputes were the governor and the clergy on the one side, and the\r\ncommissary with the people on the other. According to the opinion of the\r\nattorney-general, Sir Edward Northey, given in 1703, \"the right of\r\npresentation by the laws of Virginia was in the parishioners, and the\r\nright of lapse in the governor;\" that is, if the vestry failed to choose\r\na minister within six months, the governor had the right of appointing\r\nhim; but it was a right which the governors, although reinforced by\r\nroyal authority, could not enforce. Of the twenty-five members of this\r\nclerical convention only eight appear to have sided with the commissary.\r\nHe held that the difference between him and the governor as to the right\r\nof collation was this: the governor claimed the right in the first\r\ninstance, like that of the king of England, to bestow livings of which\r\nhe himself is patron; the commissary was of opinion that the governor's\r\npower corresponded to that of the bishop, not being original, but only\r\nconsequent upon a lapse; that is, a failure of the vestry to present\r\nwithin the time limited by law. Commissary Blair, throughout these angry\r\ncontroversies, in the course of which he was very badly treated by the\r\ngovernor and the clergy, bore himself with singular ability and\r\nexcellent temper, and proved himself more than a match for his\r\nopponents.[402:A]\r\n\r\nPredatory parties of the Five Nations were repelled by force, and\r\nconciliated by presents. The frontier of Virginia was extended to the\r\nfoot of the Blue Ridge, and two new Piedmont counties, Spotsylvania and\r\nBrunswick, were established in 1720--the seventh year of George the\r\nFirst.[402:B] Spotsylvania included the northern pass through the\r\nmountains. At the special solicitation of the governor, the two counties\r\nwere exempted from taxation for ten years. An act was passed imposing\r\npenalties on \"whosoever shall weed, top, hill, succor, house, cure,\r\nstrip or pack any seconds, suckers, or slips of tobacco.\" Two hundred\r\npounds of tobacco were offered in reward for every wolf killed.\r\nWarehouses for storing tobacco and other merchandize, when first\r\nestablished in 1712, were denominated rolling-houses, from the mode of\r\nrolling the tobacco to market, before wagons came into general use or\r\nthe navigation of the rivers improved. This mode of transporting tobacco\r\nprevailed generally in 1820, and later.[403:A] Tobacco warehouses in\r\nVirginia are now devoted exclusively to that commodity. In 1720, King\r\nGeorge County was carved off from Richmond County, and Hanover from New\r\nKent. A house for the governor was completed about this time. An act was\r\npassed to encourage the making of tar and hemp, and another to oblige\r\nships coming from places infected with the plague to perform quarantine.\r\nThe Indians of the Five Nations, warring with the Southern Indians for\r\nmany years, had been in the habit of marching along the frontier of\r\nVirginia and committing depredations. To prevent this, a treaty was\r\neffected with them, whereby they bound themselves not to cross Potomac\r\nRiver, nor to pass to the eastward of the great ridge of mountains,\r\nwithout a passport from the Governor of New York; and, on the other\r\nhand, the Indians tributary to this government engaged not to pass over\r\nthe Potomac, or go westward of the mountains, without a passport from\r\nthe Governor of Virginia. This treaty was ratified at Albany, September,\r\n1722. An act concerning servants and slaves was repealed by\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nSpotswood urged upon the British government the policy of establishing a\r\nchain of posts beyond the Alleghanies, from the lakes to the\r\nMississippi, to restrain the encroachments of the French. The ministry\r\ndid not enter into his views on this subject, and it was not till after\r\nthe treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle that his wise, prophetic admonitions were\r\nheeded, and his plans adopted. He also failed in an effort to obtain\r\nfrom the government compensation for his companions in the Tramontane\r\nexploration. At length, owing, as his friends allege, to the intrigues\r\nand envious whispers of men far inferior to him in capacity and honesty,\r\nbut according to others, on account of his high-handed encroachments on\r\nthe rights of the colony, Spotswood was displaced in 1722, and succeeded\r\nby Hugh Drysdale. Chalmers,[404:A] also a native of Scotland, and as\r\nextreme a supporter of prerogative, thus eulogizes Spotswood: \"Having\r\nreviewed the uninteresting conduct of the frivolous men who had ruled\r\nbefore him, the historian will dwell with pleasure on the merits of\r\nSpotswood. There was an utility in his designs, a vigor in his conduct,\r\nand an attachment to the true interest of the kingdom and the colony,\r\nwhich merit the greatest praise. Had he attended more to the courtly\r\nmaxim of Charles the Second, 'to quarrel with no man, however great\r\nmight be the provocation, since he knew not how soon he should be\r\nobliged to act with him,' that able officer might be recommended as the\r\nmodel of a provincial governor. The fabled heroes who had discovered the\r\nuses of the anvil and the axe, who introduced the labors of the plough,\r\nwith the arts of the fisher, have been immortalized as the greatest\r\nbenefactors of mankind; had Spotswood even invaded the privileges, while\r\nhe only mortified the pride of the Virginians, they ought to have\r\nerected a statue to the memory of a ruler who gave them the manufacture\r\nof iron, and showed them by his active example that it is diligence and\r\nattention which can alone make a people great.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Spotswood was the author of an act for improving the staple of\r\ntobacco, and making tobacco-notes the medium of ordinary circulation.\r\nBeing a master of the military art, he kept the militia of Virginia\r\nunder admirable discipline. In Spotsylvania, Spotswood, previous to the\r\nyear 1724, had founded, on a horseshoe peninsula of four hundred acres,\r\non the Rapidan, the little town of Germanna, so called after the Germans\r\nsent over by Queen Anne, and settled in that quarter, and at this place\r\nhe resided. A church was built there mainly at his expense. In the year\r\n1730 he was made deputy postmaster-general for the colonies, and held\r\nthat office till 1739; and it was he who promoted Benjamin Franklin to\r\nthe office of postmaster for the Province of Pennsylvania. Owning an\r\nextensive tract of forty-five thousand acres of land, and finding it to\r\nabound in iron ore, he engaged largely in partnership with Mr. Robert\r\nCary, of England, and others in Virginia, in the manufacture of it. He\r\nis styled by Colonel Byrd the \"Tubal Cain of Virginia;\" he was, indeed,\r\nthe first person that ever established a regular furnace in North\r\nAmerica, leading the way and setting the example to New England and\r\nPennsylvania. Pennsylvania, at this period, was unable to export iron,\r\nowing to the scarcity of ships, and made it only for domestic use.\r\nSpotswood expressed the hope that \"he had done the country very great\r\nservice by setting so good an example;\" and stated \"that the four\r\nfurnaces now at work in Virginia circulated a great sum of money for\r\nprovisions and all other necessaries in the adjacent counties; that they\r\ntook off a great number of hands from planting tobacco, and employed\r\nthem in works that produced a large sum of money in England to the\r\npersons concerned, whereby the country is so much the richer; that they\r\nare besides a considerable advantage to Great Britain, because it\r\nlessens the quantity of bar iron imported from Spain, Holland, Sweden,\r\nDenmark, and Muscovy, which used to be no less than twenty thousand tons\r\nyearly, though, at the same time, no sow iron is imported thither from\r\nany country, but only from the plantations. For most of this bar iron\r\nthey do not only pay silver, but our friends in the Baltic are so nice\r\nthey even expect to be paid all in crown pieces. On the contrary, all\r\nthe iron they receive from the plantations, they pay for it in their own\r\nmanufactures and send for it in their own shipping.\"[405:A]\r\n\r\nThere was as yet no forge set up in Virginia for the manufacture of bar\r\niron. The duty in England upon it was twenty-four shillings a ton, and\r\nit sold there for from ten to sixteen pounds per ton, which paid the\r\ncost of forging it abundantly; but Spotswood \"doubted; the parliament of\r\nEngland would soon forbid us that improvement, lest after that we should\r\ngo farther, and manufacture our bars into all sorts of ironware, as they\r\nalready do in New England and Pennsylvania. Nay, he questioned whether\r\nwe should be suffered to cast any iron which they can do themselves at\r\ntheir furnaces.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole expense was computed at two pounds per ton of sow, (or pig\r\niron,) and it sold for five or six pounds in England, leaving a nett\r\nprofit of three pounds or more on a ton. It was estimated that a furnace\r\nwould cost seven hundred pounds. One hundred negroes were requisite, but\r\non good land these, besides the furnace-work, would raise corn and\r\nprovisions sufficient for themselves and the cattle. The people to be\r\nhired were a founder, a mine-raiser, a collier, a stock-taker, a clerk,\r\na smith, a carpenter, a wheelwright, and some carters, these altogether\r\ninvolving an annual charge of five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAt Massaponux, a plantation on the Rappahannock, belonging to Governor\r\nSpotswood, he had in operation an air-furnace for casting chimney-backs,\r\nandirons, fenders, plates for hearths, pots, mortars, rollers for\r\ngardeners, skillets, boxes for cart-wheels. These were sold at twenty\r\nshillings a ton and delivered at the purchaser's home, and being cast\r\nfrom the sow iron were much better than the English, which were made,\r\nfor the most part, immediately from the ore.\r\n\r\nIn 1732, besides Colonel Willis, the principal person of the place,\r\nthere were at Fredericksburg only one merchant, a tailor, a blacksmith,\r\nand an ordinary keeper.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement is found in the \"Virginia Gazette\" for 1739:\r\n\"Colonel Spotswood, intending next year to leave Virginia with his\r\nfamily, hereby gives notice that he shall, in April next, dispose of a\r\nquantity of choice household furniture, together with a coach, chariot,\r\nchaise, coach-horses, house-slaves, etc. And that the rich lands in\r\nOrange County, which he has hitherto reserved for his own seating, he\r\nnow leases out for lives renewable till Christmas, 1775, admitting every\r\ntenant to the choice of his tenement, according to the priority of\r\nentry. He further gives notice that he is ready to treat with any person\r\nof good credit for farming out, for twenty-one years, Germanna and its\r\ncontiguous lands, with the stock thereon, and some slaves. As also for\r\nfarming out, for the like term of years, an extraordinary grist-mill and\r\nbolting-mill, lately built by one of the best millwrights in America,\r\nand both going by water taken by a long race out of the Rapidan,\r\ntogether with six hundred acres of seated land adjoining the said mill.\r\n\r\n\"N. B.--The chariot (which has been looked upon as one of the best made,\r\nhandsomest, and easiest chariots in London,) is to be disposed of at any\r\ntime, together with some other goods. No one will be received as a\r\ntenant who has not the character of an industrious man.\"\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir Alexander Spotswood, when on the eve of embarking with\r\nthe troops destined for Carthagena, died at Annapolis, on the 7th day of\r\nJune, 1740. There is reason to believe that he lies buried at Temple\r\nFarm, his country residence near Yorktown, and so called from a\r\nsepulchral building erected by him in the garden there. It was in the\r\ndwelling-house at Temple Farm (called the Moore House) that Lord\r\nCornwallis signed the capitulation. This spot, so associated with\r\nhistorical recollections, is also highly picturesque in its\r\nsituation.[407:A]\r\n\r\nGovernor Spotswood left a historical account of Virginia during the\r\nperiod of his administration, and Mr. Bancroft had access to this\r\nvaluable document, and refers to it in his history.[407:B]\r\n\r\nDuring the sanguinary war with the Indians in which North Carolina had\r\nbeen engaged, Governor Spotswood demanded of the tribes tributary to\r\nVirginia a number of the sons of their chiefs, to be sent to the College\r\nof William and Mary, where they served as hostages to preserve peace,\r\nand enjoyed the advantage of learning to read and write English, and\r\nwere instructed in the Christian religion. But on returning to their own\r\npeople they relapsed into idolatry and barbarism.[407:C]\r\n\r\nGovernor Spotswood's long residence in Virginia, and the identity of his\r\ninterests with those of the people of the colony, appear to have greatly\r\nchanged his views of governmental prerogative and popular rights, for\r\nduring this year he gave it as his opinion that \"if the assembly in New\r\nEngland would stand bluff, he did not see how they could be forced to\r\nraise money against their will, for if they should direct it to be done\r\nby act of parliament, which they have threatened to do, (though it be\r\nagainst the right of Englishmen to be taxed but by their\r\nrepresentatives,) yet they would find it no easy matter to put such an\r\nact in execution.\"[408:A]\r\n\r\nGovernor Spotswood married, in 1724, Miss Butler Bryan, (pronounced\r\nBrain,) daughter of Richard Bryan, Esq., of Westminster, an English\r\nlady, whose Christian name was taken from James Butler, Duke of Ormond,\r\nher godfather. Their children were John and Robert, Anne Catherine and\r\nDorothea. John Spotswood married, in 1745, Mary Dandridge, daughter of\r\nWilliam Dandridge, of the British navy, Commander of the Ludlow Castle\r\nship-of-war, and their children were two sons, General Alexander\r\nSpotswood and Captain John Spotswood of the army of the Revolution, and\r\ntwo daughters, Mary and Anne. Robert, the younger son of the governor,\r\nan officer under Washington in the French and Indian war, being detached\r\nwith a scouting party from Fort Cumberland, (1756,) was supposed to have\r\nbeen killed by the Indians. He died without issue.[408:B] His remains\r\nwere found near Fort Du Quesne; and in an elegiac poem published in\r\n\"Martin's Miscellany,\" in London, the writer assumes that young\r\nSpotswood was slain by the savages.\r\n\r\n     \"Courageous youth! were now thine honored sire\r\n      To breathe again, and rouse his wonted ire,\r\n      Nor French nor Shawnee dare his rage provoke,\r\n      From great Potomac's spring to Roanoke.\r\n\r\n     \"May Forbes yet live the cruel debt to pay,\r\n      And wash the blood of Braddock's field away;\r\n      The fair Ohio's blushing waves may tell\r\n      How Britons fought, and how each hero fell.\"[408:C]\r\n\r\nAnne Catherine, the elder daughter of Governor Spotswood, married\r\nBernard Moore, Esq., of Chelsea, in the County of King William.\r\nDorothea, the other daughter, married Captain Nathaniel West Dandridge,\r\nof the British navy, son of Captain William Dandridge, of Elson\r\nGreen.[409:A]\r\n\r\nThe governor's lady surviving him, and continuing to live at Germanna,\r\nNovember the 9th, 1742, married second the Rev. John Thompson, of\r\nCulpepper County, a minister of exemplary character. From this union was\r\ndescended the late Commodore Thompson of the United States navy. Lady\r\nSpotswood's children objected to the match on the ground of his inferior\r\nrank, so that after an engagement she requested to be released; but he\r\nappears to have overcome her scruples by a curious letter addressed to\r\nher on the subject.[409:B]\r\n\r\nThe present representative of the family[409:C] is John Spottiswoode,\r\nEsq., M.P., Laird of Spottiswoode.[409:D] His brothers are George\r\nSpottiswoode, of Gladswood, County Berwick, lieutenant-colonel in the\r\narmy, and Andrew Spottiswoode, of Broom Hall, County Surrey. The\r\nrepresentative of the family resides during the greater portion of the\r\nyear at Spottiswoode, on his extensive hereditary estate, the modern\r\nmansion being one of the finest in Southern Scotland. The old mansion\r\nstill remains. Thirty miles of underground drains have been made on this\r\nestate, reclaiming hundreds of acres of land lying between the\r\nBlackadder and the Leader.[409:E]\r\n\r\nGovernor Spotswood[409:F] was half-brother to a General Elliott. The\r\ngovernor had a country-seat near Williamsburg, called Porto-Bello.\r\nBesides the portrait of him preserved at Chelsea, in the County of King\r\nWilliam, there is another at the residence of William Spotswood, Esq.,\r\nin Orange County, where there is also a portrait of Lady Spotswood, and\r\none of General Elliott, half-brother of the governor, in complete armor.\r\nThe descendants of Governor Spotswood in Virginia are numerous, and his\r\nmemory is held in great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[400:A] Bishop Meade's Old Churches, etc., i. 160, ii.

Commissary Blair wished\r\nthe governor, when a vacancy of more than six months occurred, to send\r\nand induct a minister as by law directed; but what Spotswood had not\r\nbeen bold enough to do, Drysdale feared to undertake without the\r\nauthority of a royal order. Opinion is queen of the world.\r\n\r\nThere were frequent complaints of the scandalous lives of some of the\r\nclergy; but it was difficult to obtain positive proof, there being many\r\nwho would cry out against such, and yet would not appear as witnesses to\r\nconvict them. Intemperance appears to have been the predominant evil\r\namong the clergy, as it was also among the laity.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Lang, who was highly recommended by the governor and\r\ncommissary, wrote, in 1726, to the Bishop of London: \"I observe the\r\npeople here are very zealous for our holy church, as it is established\r\nin England, so that (except some few inconsiderable Quakers) there are\r\nscarce any dissenters from our communion; and yet, at the same time, the\r\npeople are supinely ignorant in the very principles of religion, and\r\nvery debauched in morals. This, I apprehend, is owing to the general\r\nneglect of the clergy in not taking pains to instruct youth in the\r\nfundamentals of religion, or to examine people come to years of\r\ndiscretion, before they are permitted to come to church privileges.\"\r\nReferring to the prevailing evils he says: \"The great cause of all which\r\nI humbly conceive to be in the clergy, the sober part being slothful\r\nand negligent, and others so debauched that they are the foremost and\r\nmost bent on all manner of vices. Drunkenness is the common vice.\"\r\nMr. Lang was minister of the parish of St. Peters, in New Kent\r\nCounty.[412:A] The religious instruction of the negroes was for the most\r\npart neglected. There were no schools for the education of the children\r\nof the common people; no parish libraries.\r\n\r\nThe assembly was held from time to time, according to long established\r\ncustom, by writ of prorogation; the people being thus deprived of the\r\nright of frequent elections. An act regulating the importation of\r\nconvicts was rejected by the board of trade. To relieve the people from\r\na poll-tax a duty was laid on the importation of liquors and slaves, but\r\nowing to the opposition of the African Company and interested traders,\r\nthe measure was repealed as an encroachment on the trade of England.\r\n\r\nActs prohibiting the importation of negro slaves were repeatedly passed\r\nby New York, Maryland, and South Carolina, and were invariably rejected\r\nin England. Governor Drysdale congratulated the Duke of Newcastle \"that\r\nthe benign influence of his auspicious sovereign was conspicuous here in\r\na general harmony and contentment among all ranks of persons.\" Hugh\r\nDrysdale dying in July, 1726, and Colonel Edmund Jennings, next in order\r\nof succession, being suspended, (for what cause does not appear,)\r\nColonel Robert Carter succeeded as president of the council. This\r\ngentleman, owing to the extent of his landed possessions, and to his\r\nbeing agent of Lord Fairfax, proprietary of a vast territory in the\r\nNorthern Neck, between the Potomac and the Rappahannock, acquired the\r\nsobriquet of \"King Carter.\" He was speaker of the house of burgesses for\r\nsix years, treasurer of the colony, and for many years member of\r\nthe council, and as president of that body he was at the head of\r\nthe government upwards of a year. He lived at Corotoman, on the\r\nRappahannock, in Lancaster County. Here a church was completed in the\r\nyear 1670, under the direction of John Carter, first of the family in\r\nVirginia, who came over from England, 1649. A fine old church was built\r\nabout 1732 by Robert Carter, on the site of the former one, and is\r\nstill in good preservation. He married first Judith Armistead, second a\r\nwidow, whose maiden name was Betty Landon, of the ancient family of that\r\nname, of Grednal, in Hereford County, England, by whom he left many\r\nchildren. His portrait and that of one of his wives, are preserved at\r\nShirley, on James River, seat of Hill Carter, Esq.[413:A] The first John\r\nCarter was a member of the house of burgesses for Upper Norfolk County,\r\nnow Nansemond, in 1649 and in 1654, and subsequently for Lancaster\r\nCounty. Colonel Edward Carter was, in 1658, burgess for Upper Norfolk,\r\nand in 1660 member of the council.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[412:A] Old Churches, i. 385.\r\n\r\n[413:A] The Carter arms bear cart-wheels, vert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\n1727-1740.\r\n\r\n     William Gooch, Governor--The Dividing Line--Miscellaneous--\r\n     Colonel Byrd's Opinion of New England--John Holloway--William\r\n     Hopkins--Earl of Orkney--Expedition against Carthagena--Gooch\r\n     commands the Virginia Regiment--Lawrence Washington--Failure\r\n     of attack on Carthagena--Georgia recruits Soldiers in Virginia\r\n     to resist the Spaniards--Acts of Assembly--Printing in\r\n     Virginia--In other Colonies--The Williamsburg Gazette--\r\n     Miscellaneous Items--Proceedings at opening of General\r\n     Assembly--Sir John Randolph, Speaker--Governor Gooch's Speech--\r\n     Richmond laid off--Captain William Byrd--Bacon Quarter--Colonel\r\n     Byrd and others plan Richmond and Petersburg in 1733--Virginia\r\n     Gazette--The Mails.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN June, 1727, George the Second succeeded his father in the throne of\r\nEngland. About the middle of October, William Gooch, a native of\r\nScotland, who had been an officer in the British army, became Governor\r\nof Virginia. The council, without authority, allowed him three hundred\r\npounds out of the royal quit-rents, and he in return resigned, in a\r\ngreat measure, the helm of government to them. Owing partly to this\r\ncoalition, partly to a well-established revenue and a rigid economy,\r\nVirginia enjoyed prosperous repose during his long administration. There\r\nwas at this time one Presbyterian congregation in Virginia, and\r\npreachers from the Philadelphia Synod visited the colony.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1728 the boundary line between Virginia and North\r\nCarolina was run by Colonel Byrd and Messrs. Fitzwilliam and Dandridge,\r\ncommissioners in behalf of Virginia, and others in behalf of North\r\nCarolina. \"A History of the Dividing Line,\" by Colonel Byrd, has been\r\npublished in a work entitled the \"Westover MSS.;\"[414:A] it contains\r\ngraphic descriptions of the country passed through, its productions, and\r\nnatural history. The author was a learned man and accurate observer.\r\n\r\nThere remained in their native seat two hundred Nottoway Indians, the\r\nonly tribe of any consequence surviving in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThere were also still remains of the Pamunkey tribe, but reduced to a\r\nsmall number, and intermixed in blood. The rest of the native tribes had\r\neither removed beyond the limits of the colony, or dwindled to a mere\r\nhandful by war, disease, and intemperance. An act of parliament\r\nprohibiting the exportation of stripped or stemmed tobacco was\r\ncomplained of by the planters as causing a decline of the trade. They\r\nundertook to enhance the value by improving its quality, and in July,\r\n1732, sent John Randolph to lay their complaint before the crown.\r\n\r\nWith this accomplished and able man, afterwards knighted, and made\r\nattorney-general, Governor Spotswood was engaged in an angry personal\r\ncontroversy in the _Williamsburg Gazette_. The merits of the dispute\r\ncannot now be ascertained. Spotswood claims to have been Randolph's\r\nbenefactor, and to have been the first to promote him in the world.\r\n\r\nVirginia, notwithstanding some obstacles in the way of her trade,\r\ncontinued to prosper, and from the year 1700 her population doubled in\r\ntwenty-five years. The New England Colonies improved still more. Colonel\r\nByrd said of them: \"Though these people may be ridiculed for some\r\nPharisaical particularities in their worship and behavior, yet they were\r\nvery useful subjects, as being frugal and industrious, giving no scandal\r\nor bad example, at least by any open and public vices. By which\r\nexcellent qualities they had much the advantage of the Southern Colony,\r\nwho thought their being members of the established church sufficient to\r\nsanctify very loose and profligate morals. For this reason New England\r\nimproved much faster than Virginia, and in seven or eight years New\r\nPlymouth, like Switzerland, seemed too narrow a territory for its\r\ninhabitants.\"[415:A]\r\n\r\nBoston, the principal town in the Anglo-American Colonies, founded in\r\n1630, contained, in 1733, eight thousand houses and forty thousand\r\ninhabitants; and its shipping and trade were already extensive.\r\n\r\nIn 1734 died John Holloway, Esq., who for thirty years had practised the\r\nlaw with great reputation and success. He was for fourteen years speaker\r\nof the house of burgesses, and eleven years treasurer. A native of\r\nEngland, he had first served as a clerk, then went into the army in\r\nIreland early in the reign of King William the Third; next came to be\r\none of the attorneys of the Marshalsea Court; afterwards turned\r\nprojector, and being unfortunate, came over to Maryland, and thence\r\nremoved to Virginia. He is described by Sir John Randolph as more\r\ndistinguished for industry than for learning, and as relying more upon\r\nthe subtle artifice of an attorney, than the solid reasoning of a\r\nlawyer. His opinions, however, were looked upon as authoritative; and\r\nclients thought themselves fortunate if they could engage his services\r\nupon any terms, and his fees were often exorbitant. He is portrayed by\r\nSir John as haughty, passionate, and inhospitable; yet it seems\r\ndifficult to reconcile this with his acknowledged popularity and\r\npredominant influence. In friendship he was sincere but inconstant. His\r\nmanagement of the treasury contributed to the ruin of his fortune, and\r\ninvolved him in disgrace. But this account of him must be taken with\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time died, in London, William Hopkins, Esq., another\r\nlawyer, who had practised in Virginia about twelve years. He was well\r\neducated, understanding Latin and French well, and gifted with a\r\nretentive memory, quick penetration, sound judgment, and a handsome\r\nperson. In spite of some defects of manner, he acquired a large\r\npractice, which he neglected, owing to the versatility of a mind fond of\r\nvarious knowledge. In fees he was moderate, in argument candid and fair,\r\nnever disputing plain points. He is taxed by Sir John Randolph with an\r\noverweening vanity, which made him jealous of any other standing on a\r\nlevel with him; but as there had been a personal falling out between\r\nthem, his testimony in regard to this particular is entitled to the less\r\nweight. Mr. Hopkins appears to have been a man of high order; and his\r\npremature death, in the flower of his age, was a loss to be deplored by\r\nVirginia.[416:A]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Orkney died at his house in Albemarle Street, London,\r\nJanuary, 1737, in the seventy-first year of his age. His titles were\r\nEarl of Orkney, one of the Sixteen Scottish Peers, Governor of Virginia,\r\nConstable, Governor and Captain of Edinburgh Castle, Knight of the most\r\nancient and most honorable order of the Thistle, one of his Majesty's\r\nField Marshals, and Colonel of a regiment of foot. By his death his\r\ntitle became extinct. He left a very large fortune.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of Governor Gooch, troops for the first time\r\nwere transported from the colonies to co-operate with the forces of the\r\nmother country in offensive war. An attack upon Carthagena being\r\ndetermined on, Gooch raised four hundred men as Virginia's quota, and\r\nthe assembly appropriated five thousand pounds for their support.\r\nMajor-General Sir Alexander Spotswood, who had been appointed to the\r\ncommand of the troops raised in the colonies, consisting of a regiment\r\nof four battalions, dying at Annapolis, when on the eve of embarcation,\r\nGovernor Gooch assumed command of the expedition. The colonial troops\r\njoined those sent out from England, at Jamaica. The amount of Virginia's\r\nappropriation on this occasion exceeding the sum in the treasury, the\r\nremainder was borrowed from wealthy men, with a view to avoid the frauds\r\nof depreciation, and to secure the benefits of circulation. Lawrence\r\nWashington, half-brother of George, and fourteen years older, obtained a\r\ncaptain's commission in the newly-raised regiment, and, being now twenty\r\nyears of age, embarked with it for the West Indies in 1740.[417:A] An\r\naccomplished gentleman, educated in England, he acquired the esteem of\r\nGeneral Wentworth and Admiral Vernon, the commanders of the British\r\nforces, and after the latter named his seat on the Potomac. The attack\r\nupon Carthagena was unsuccessful; the ships not getting near enough to\r\nthrow their shells into the town, and the scaling-ladders of the\r\nsoldiers proving to be too short. That part of the attack in which\r\nLawrence Washington was present, sustained, unflinching, a destructive\r\nfire for several hours. The small land force engaged on this occasion\r\nlost no less than six hundred killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nShortly after the failure at Carthagena, an express from South\r\nCarolina brought tidings that the Spaniards had made a descent upon\r\nGeorgia; and Captain Dandridge, commander of the South Sea Castle,\r\ntogether with the \"snows\" Hawk and Swift, was dispatched to the\r\nassistance of General Oglethorpe. The Spaniards were repulsed. Georgia\r\nbeing still threatened by a Spanish force concentrated at St. Augustine,\r\nin Florida, Oglethorpe sent Lieutenant-Colonel Heron to recruit a\r\nregiment in Virginia. Captain Lawrence Washington, with a number of\r\nofficers and soldiers of Gooch's Carthagena Regiment, recently\r\ndischarged, just now arriving at Hampton, and meeting with Heron, many\r\nof them enlisted again under him.\r\n\r\nAbout this time apprehensions were felt of foreign invasion by sea, of\r\nIndian incursions, and of servile insurrections. An act was passed to\r\nprevent excessive and deceitful gaming, making all gaming obligations\r\nvoid, imposing heavy penalties upon persons cheating at games, and\r\ndeclaring them infamous, authorizing justices of the peace to bind\r\ncommon gamblers over to their good behavior. Means were adopted for\r\nencouraging adventurers in iron works. The towns of Fredericksburg and\r\nFalmouth were established at the head of tide-water, on the\r\nRappahannock. Caroline County was formed, and Goochland carved out from\r\nHenrico. Long and elaborate acts were passed for amending the staple of\r\ntobacco. The tending of seconds was prohibited; all tobacco exported to\r\nbe inspected; to be exported from warehouses only; the planter to\r\nreceive from the inspectors a promissory note specifying the quantity of\r\ntobacco deposited, and the quality, whether sweet-scented or Oronoko,\r\nstemmed or leaf; these tobacco-notes were made current within the county\r\nor other adjacent county. This salutary measure of making tobacco the\r\nbasis of a currency was devised by Governor Spotswood.[418:A]\r\nTobacco-notes were still in use in Virginia at the beginning of the\r\npresent century. In the year 1730 Prince William County was established.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkley (1671) \"thanked God that there were no free schools\r\nnor printing in Virginia.\" In 1682 John Buckner was called before the\r\nLord Culpepper and his council for printing the laws of 1680 without\r\nhis excellency's license, and he and the printer ordered to enter into\r\nbond in one hundred pounds, not to print anything thereafter, until his\r\nmajesty's pleasure should be known.[419:A] The earliest surviving\r\nevidence of printing done in Virginia is the edition of \"The Revised\r\nLaws,\" published in 1733. In 1719 two newspapers were issued at Boston;\r\nin 1725 one at New York, and in the following year a printing-press was\r\nintroduced into Maryland. One had been established at Cambridge, in\r\nMassachusetts, before 1647. A printing-press was first established in\r\nSouth Carolina, and a newspaper published in 1734. The first Virginia\r\nnewspaper, \"The Virginia Gazette,\" appeared at Williamsburg, in August,\r\n1736, published by William Parks, weekly, at fifteen shillings per\r\nannum. It was a small sheet, on dingy paper, but well printed. It was in\r\nthe interest of the government, and for a long time the only journal of\r\nthe colony. Parks printed \"Stith's History of Virginia\" and \"The Laws of\r\nVirginia.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1732, in accordance with royal instructions, a duty was laid of five\r\nper centum on the purchase-money of slaves, to be paid by the purchaser.\r\nThe difference between sterling money and the ordinary currency was\r\ntwenty per centum. Stealing of slaves was made felony, without benefit\r\nof clergy.\r\n\r\nThe Nottoway Indians (1734) still possessed a large tract of land on the\r\nriver of that name, in Isle of Wight County. They were much reduced by\r\nwars and disease, and were allowed to sell part of their lands for their\r\nbetter support. The tributary Indians now speaking the English language,\r\nthe use of interpreters was dispensed with.\r\n\r\nAn act for regulating the fees of \"the practisers in physic,\" recites\r\nthat the practice is commonly in the hands of surgeons, apothecaries, or\r\nsuch as have only served apprenticeships to those trades, who often\r\nprove very unskilful, and yet demand excessive fees and prices for their\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly met at Williamsburg, in August, 1736, and sixty\r\nburgesses appearing, and it being the first session of this assembly,\r\nthey were qualified by taking the oaths and subscribing the test. The\r\nburgesses having attended the governor in the council-chamber, and\r\nhaving returned, in compliance with the governor's commands, a speaker\r\nwas elected, and the choice fell upon Sir John Randolph. He being\r\nconducted to the chair by two members, made a speech to the house. On\r\nthe next day the burgesses waited on the governor in the council-chamber\r\nagain, and presented their new speaker to his honor, and the speaker\r\nmade an address to the governor, giving a concise history of the\r\nconstitution of Virginia, from the first period of arbitrary government\r\nand martial law to the charter granted by the Virginia Company,\r\nestablishing an assembly, consisting of a council of state and a house\r\nof burgesses, which legislative constitution was confirmed by James the\r\nFirst, Charles the First, and their successors. Under it the house of\r\nburgesses claimed, as undoubted rights, freedom of speech, exemption\r\nfrom arrests, protection of their estates, jurisdiction over their own\r\nbody, and the sole right of determining all questions concerning\r\nelections. The speaker next eulogized the administration of Governor\r\nGooch.\r\n\r\nThe governor then addressed the gentlemen of the council, Mr. Speaker,\r\nand the gentlemen of the house of burgesses. He recommended the better\r\nregulation of the militia for the preventing of servile insurrections,\r\nthe danger of which was increased by the large importation of negroes;\r\nmentions that his majesty had been graciously pleased to confirm an act\r\nfor the better support and encouragement of the College of William and\r\nMary, and another facilitating the barring of entails of small value, to\r\nperpetuate which, in a new country like Virginia, could serve only to\r\nimpoverish the present possessor. Governor Gooch's reply closed this\r\nlong series of addresses.[420:A]\r\n\r\nThe borough of Norfolk was incorporated in 1736. Sir John Randolph,\r\nKnight, was made recorder, although not a resident.[420:B]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1737 the town of Richmond was laid off near the falls of\r\nJames River, by Colonel William Byrd, of Westover, who was proprietor\r\nof an extensive tract of land there. Shoccoe Warehouse had been already\r\nestablished there for a good many years. Fort Charles, called after the\r\nprince royal, afterwards Charles the Second, was erected (1645) at the\r\nfalls of James River. A tract of land there, extending five miles in\r\nlength and three in breadth, and lying on both sides of the river, was\r\nclaimed (1679) by Captain William Byrd, father of the first Colonel\r\nWilliam Byrd, of Westover.[421:A] This Captain Byrd was born in London\r\nabout the year 1653, and came over to Virginia probably about 1674. He\r\nwas a merchant and planter. His residence, appropriately named\r\nBelvidere, was on the north side of the river, opposite the falls. A\r\nlarge part of this land had, a few years before, belonged to Nathaniel\r\nBacon, Jr. The names \"Bacon Quarter\" and \"Bacon Quarter Branch,\" are\r\nstill preserved there. The word Quarter thus used, means land owned and\r\ncultivated, but not resided on--a place where servants are quartered,\r\nand is still in common use in the tobacco-growing counties. Captain Byrd\r\nhad been active in bringing some of the rebels to punishment. Bacon's\r\nconfiscated land at the falls, perhaps, may have been given to him in\r\nreward for his loyal services on that occasion. He was a burgess from\r\nHenrico.[421:B] His letter-book, containing letters from 1683 to 1691,\r\nis preserved in the library of the Virginia Historical Society.\r\n\r\nColonel Byrd, second of the name, made a visit to his plantations on the\r\nRoanoke River, (1733,) accompanied by Major Mayo, Major Munford, Mr.\r\nBanister, and Mr. Peter Jones. While here, he says: \"We laid the\r\nfoundation of two large cities, one at Shoccoe's, to be called Richmond,\r\nand the other at the Point of Appomattox, to be called Petersburg. These\r\nMajor Mayo offered to lay out in lots without fee or reward. The truth\r\nof it is these two places, being the uppermost landing of James and\r\nAppomattox Rivers, are naturally intended for marts where the traffic of\r\nthe outer inhabitants must centre. Thus we did not build castles only,\r\nbut cities in the air.\"[421:C] The following advertisement appeared in\r\nApril, 1737, in \"The Virginia Gazette:\"\r\n\r\n\"This is to give notice that on the north side of James River, near the\r\nuppermost landing, and a little below the falls, is lately laid off by\r\nMajor Mayo, a town called Richmond, with streets sixty-five feet wide,\r\nin a pleasant and healthy situation, and well supplied with springs and\r\ngood water. It lies near the public warehouse at Shoccoe's, and in the\r\nmidst of great quantities of grain and all kinds of provisions. The lots\r\nwill be granted in fee simple on condition only of building a house in\r\nthree years' time, of twenty-four by sixteen feet, fronting within five\r\nfeet of the street. The lots to be rated according to the convenience of\r\ntheir situation, and to be sold after this April general court by me,\r\nWilliam Byrd.\" Richmond is said to be named from Richmond, near London,\r\nor, as others think, from the Duke of Richmond, whom Byrd may have known\r\nin England; but this is less probable.\r\n\r\nAmong the arrivals about this time is mentioned the ship Carter, with\r\nforty-four pipes of wine, \"for gentlemen in this country;\" and a ship\r\narrived in the Potomac with a load of convicts. The Hector man-of-war,\r\nSir Yelverton Peyton commander, arrived in the James River from England,\r\nby way of Georgia, whither he had accompanied the Blandford man-of-war,\r\nand the transport-ships which conveyed General Oglethorpe and his\r\nregiment. Captain Dandridge is mentioned as commanding his majesty's\r\nship Wolf. \"Warner's Almanac\" was advertised for sale. According to a\r\nnew regulation adopted by the deputy postmaster-general, Spotswood, the\r\nmail from the north arrived at Williamsburg weekly, and William Parks,\r\nprinter of \"The Virginia Gazette,\" was commissioned to convey the mail\r\nmonthly from Williamsburg, by way of Nansemond Court-house and\r\nNorfolktown, to Edenton, in North Carolina. The general post-office was\r\nthen at New Post, a few miles below Fredericksburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[414:A] By Edmund and Julian C.

Quieted for a time by the sword, insurrection again burst\r\nforth in the second year of James the First, and repeated rebellions\r\ncrushed in 1605, left a large tract of country desolate, and fast\r\ndeclining into barbarism. Almost the whole of six counties of Ulster\r\nthus, by forfeiture, fell into the hands of the king. A London company,\r\nunder his auspices, colonized this unhappy district with settlers,\r\npartly English, principally Scotch--one of the few wise and salutary\r\nmeasures of his feeble reign. The descendants of these colonists of the\r\nplantation of Ulster, as it was now called, came to be distinguished by\r\nthe name of Scotch-Irish. Archbishop Usher, who was disposed to\r\nreconcile the differences between the Presbyterians and Episcopalians,\r\nconsented to a compromise of them, in consequence of which there was no\r\nformal separation from the established church. But it was not long\r\nbefore the persecutions of the house of Stuart, inflicted by the hands\r\nof Strafford and Laud, augmented the numbers of the non-conformists,\r\nriveted them more closely to their own political and religious\r\nprinciples, and compelled them to turn their eyes to America as a place\r\nof refuge for the oppressed. The civil war of England ensuing, they were\r\nfor a time relieved from this necessity. Their unbending opposition to\r\nthe proceedings of Cromwell drew down upon them (1649) the sarcastic\r\ndenunciation of Milton.[423:A]\r\n\r\nThe persecutions that followed the restoration (1679) and afterwards,\r\nat length compelled the Scotch-Irish to seek refuge in the New World,\r\nand many of them came over from the north of Ireland, and settled in\r\nseveral of the colonies, especially in Pennsylvania. From thence a\r\nportion of them gradually migrated to the western parts of Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina, inhabiting the frontier of civilization, and forming a\r\nbarrier between the red men and the whites of the older settlements. The\r\nScotch-Irish enjoyed entire freedom of religion, for which they were\r\nindebted to their remote situation.[424:A] The people of eastern, or old\r\nVirginia, were distinguished by the name of Tuckahoes, said to be\r\nderived from the name of a small stream; while the hardy mountaineers,\r\nwest of the Blue Ridge, were styled Cohees, according to tradition, from\r\ntheir frequent use of the term \"Quoth he,\" or \"Quo-he.\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1737, died the Honorable Sir John Randolph,\r\nKnight, speaker of the house of burgesses, treasurer of the colony, and\r\nrepresentative for William and Mary College. He was interred in the\r\nchapel of the college, his body being borne there at his own request, by\r\nsix honest, industrious, poor housekeepers, of Bruton Parish, who had\r\ntwenty pounds divided among them. His funeral oration in Latin was\r\npronounced by the Rev. Mr. Dawson, a professor in the college. Sir John\r\nwas, at the time of his death, in his forty-fourth year. His father,\r\nWilliam Randolph, a native of Warwickshire, England, came over to seek\r\nhis fortunes in Virginia some time subsequent to the year 1670. He was\r\npoor, and it is said, for a time \"made his living by building barns.\" By\r\nindustry, integrity, and good fortune, he acquired a large landed\r\nestate, and became a burgess for the County of Henrico.[424:B] On the\r\nmaternal side, Sir John Randolph was descended from the Ishams, an\r\nancient family of Northamptonshire, in England, which had emigrated to\r\nthe colony. A love of learning which he early evinced was improved by\r\nthe tuition of a Protestant clergyman, a French refugee. His education\r\nwas completed at William and Mary College, for which he retained a\r\ngrateful attachment. He studied the law at Gray's Inn and the Temple;\r\nand, after assuming the barrister's gown, returned to Virginia, where he\r\nsoon became distinguished at the bar. He was gifted with a handsome\r\nperson, and a senatorial dignity. With extraordinary talents he united\r\nextensive learning; in his writings he indulged rather too much the\r\nnative luxuriance of his genius. In his domestic relations he is\r\ndescribed as exemplary; his income was ample, and his hospitality\r\nproportionate. Blessed with an excellent judgment, he filled his public\r\nstations with signal ability. He was buried in the chapel of William and\r\nMary; and his elegant marble tablet, graced with a Latin inscription,\r\nafter having endured one hundred and twenty-three years, was recently\r\ndestroyed by the fire which consumed the college. Sir John Randolph was\r\nsucceeded in the office of treasurer by John Robinson, Jr.\r\n\r\nFrom the preamble to the act for the better preservation of deer, it\r\nappears that in the upper country they were so numerous that they were\r\nkilled (as buffalo often are in the far West) for their skins. They were\r\nshot while feeding on the moss growing on the rocks in the rivers; and\r\ntheir carcases attracted wolves and other wild beasts to the destruction\r\nof cattle, hogs, and sheep. Many deer were also killed by hounds running\r\nat large, and by fire-hunting, that is, by setting on fire, in large\r\ncircles, the coverts where the deer lodged, which likewise destroyed the\r\nyoung timber, and the food for cattle.\r\n\r\nFrom the settlement of Jamestown a century elapsed before Virginia began\r\nto extend her settlements to the foot of the Blue Ridge. Governor\r\nSpotswood (1716) explored those mountains beyond the head-springs of the\r\nconfluents of the Rappahannock. After a good many years, Joist Hite, of\r\nPennsylvania, obtained from the original patentees a warrant for forty\r\nthousand acres of land lying among the beautiful prairies at the\r\nnorthern or lower end of the valley of the Shenandoah. Hite, with his\r\nown and a number of other families, removed (1632) from Pennsylvania,\r\nand seated themselves on the banks of the Opeckon, a few miles south of\r\nthe site of Winchester. This handful of settlers could venture more\r\nsecurely into this remote country, as coming from Pennsylvania, a\r\nprovince endeared to the Indians by the gentle and humane policy of\r\nits first founder, William Penn. Toward the Virginians--the \"Long\r\nKnives\"--the Indians bore an implacable hostility, and warmly opposed\r\ntheir settling in the valley.[426:A]\r\n\r\nIn her physical geography Virginia is divided into four sections:\r\nthe first, the alluvial section, from the sea-coast to the head of\r\ntide-water; the second, the hilly, or undulating section, from the head\r\nof tide-water to the Blue Ridge; the third, the valley section, lying\r\nbetween the Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies; and the fourth, the\r\nTrans-Alleghany or western section, the waters of which empty into the\r\nOhio. The mountains of Virginia are arranged in ridges, one behind\r\nanother, nearly parallel to the sea-coast, rather bending toward it to\r\nthe northeast. The name Apalachian, borrowed from the country bordering\r\non the Gulf of Mexico to the southwest, was applied to the mountains of\r\nVirginia in different ways, by the European maps; but none of these\r\nridges was in fact ever known to the inhabitants of Virginia by that\r\nname. These mountains extend from northeast to southwest, as also do the\r\nlimestone, coal, and other geological strata. So also range the falls of\r\nthe principal rivers, the courses of which are at right angles with the\r\nline of the mountains, the James and the Potomac making their way\r\nthrough all the ridges of mountains eastward of the Alleghany range.\r\nThe Alleghanies are broken by no water-course, being the spine of\r\nthe country between the Atlantic and the Mississippi River. The\r\nspectacle presented at Harper's Ferry--so called after the first\r\nsettler--impresses the beholder with the opinion that the mountains were\r\nfirst upraised, the very signification of the word in the Greek, and the\r\nrivers began to flow afterwards; that here they were dammed up by the\r\nBlue Ridge, and thus formed a sea, or lake, filling the whole valley\r\nlying between that ridge and the Alleghanies. The waters continuing to\r\nrise, they at length burst their way through the mountain, the shattered\r\nfragments of this disruption still remaining to attest the fact. As the\r\nobserver lifts his eye from this scene of grandeur, he catches through\r\nthe fissure of the mountain a glimpse of the placid blue horizon in the\r\ndistant perspective, inviting him, as it were, from the riot and tumult\r\nroaring around to pass through the breach and participate in the calm\r\nbelow.[427:A]\r\n\r\nA settlement was effected (1734) on the north branch of the Shenandoah,\r\nabout twelve miles south of the present town of Woodstock. Other\r\nadventurers gradually extended the settlements, until they reached the\r\ntributaries of the Monongahela. Two cabins erected (1738) near the\r\nShawnee Springs, formed the embryo of the town of Winchester, long the\r\nfrontier out-post of the colony in that quarter. The glowing reports of\r\nthe charms of the tramontane country induced other pioneers to plant\r\nthemselves in that wild, picturesque region. For the want of towns and\r\nroads the first settlers were supplied by pedlars who went from house to\r\nhouse. Shortly after the first settlement of Winchester, John Marlin, a\r\npedlar, who traded from Williamsburg to this new country, and John\r\nSalling, a weaver, two adventurous spirits, set out from that place to\r\nexplore the \"upper country,\" then almost unknown. Proceeding up the\r\nvalley of the Shenandoah they crossed the James River, and had reached\r\nthe Roanoke River, when a party of Cherokees surprised them, and took\r\nSalling prisoner, while Marlin escaped. Carried captive into Tennessee,\r\nSalling remained with those Indians for several years, and became\r\ndomesticated among them. While on a buffalo-hunting excursion to the\r\nSalt Licks of Kentucky, a middle or debateable ground of hunting and\r\nwar, the Flanders of the Northern and Southern Indians, with a party of\r\nthem, he was at length captured by a band of Illinois Indians. They\r\ncarried him to Kaskaskia, where an old squaw adopted him for a son.\r\nHence he accompanied the tribe on many distant expeditions, once as far\r\nas the Gulf of Mexico. But after two years the squaw sold him to some\r\nSpaniards from the Lower Mississippi, who wanted him as an interpreter.\r\nHe was taken by them northward, and finally, after six years of\r\ncaptivity and wanderings through strange tribes and distant countries,\r\nhe was ransomed by the Governor of Canada, and transferred to New York.\r\nThence he made his way to Williamsburg, in Virginia. About the same time\r\na considerable number of immigrants had arrived there--among them John\r\nLewis and John Mackey. Lewis was a native of Ireland. In an affray that\r\noccurred in the County of Dublin, with an oppressive landlord and his\r\nretainers, seeing a brother, an officer in the king's army, who lay sick\r\nat his house, slain before his eyes, he slew one or two of the\r\nassailants. Escaping, he found refuge in Portugal, and after some years\r\ncame over to Virginia with his family, consisting of Margaret Lynn,\r\ndaughter of the Laird of Loch Lynn, in Scotland, his wife, four sons,\r\nThomas, William, Andrew, and Charles, and one daughter. Pleased with\r\nSalling's glowing picture of the country beyond the mountains, Lewis and\r\nMackey visited it under his guidance. Crossing the Blue Ridge and\r\ndescending into the lovely valley beyond, where virgin nature reposes in\r\nall her native charms, the three determined to fix their abode in that\r\ndelightful region. Lewis selected a residence near the Middle River, on\r\nthe border of a creek which yet bears his name, in what was denominated\r\nBeverley Manor; Mackey chose a spot farther up that river, near the\r\nBuffalo Gap; and Salling built his log cabin fifty miles beyond, on a\r\nbeautiful tract overshadowed by mountains in the forks of the James\r\nRiver.[428:A] John Lewis erected on the spot selected for his home a\r\nstone-house, still standing, and it came to be known as Lewis's Fort. It\r\nis a few miles from Staunton, of which town he was the founder. It is\r\nthe oldest town in the valley. He obtained patents for a hundred\r\nthousand acres of land in different parts of the circumjacent country,\r\nand left an ample inheritance to his children.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1736 John Lewis, the pioneer of Augusta, visiting\r\nWilliamsburg, met there with Burden, who had recently come to Virginia\r\nas agent for Lord Fairfax, proprietor of the Northern Neck. Burden, in\r\ncompliance with Lewis's invitation, visited him at his sequestered home\r\nin the backwoods; and the visit of several months was occupied in\r\nexploring the teeming beauties of the Eden-like valley, and in hunting,\r\nin company with Lewis and his sons, Samuel and Andrew. A captured\r\nbuffalo calf was given to Burden, and he, on returning to Lower\r\nVirginia, where that animal was not found, presented it to Governor\r\nGooch, who, thus propitiated, authorized him to locate five hundred\r\nthousand acres of land in the vast Counties of Frederick and Augusta,\r\n(formed two years thereafter,) on condition that within ten years he\r\nshould settle one hundred families there, in which case he should be\r\nentitled to one thousand acres adjacent to every house, with the\r\nprivilege of entering as much more at one shilling per acre. This grant\r\ncovered one-half of what is now Rockbridge County, from the North\r\nMountain to the Blue Ridge. The grantee was required to import and place\r\non the land one settler for every thousand acres. For this purpose he\r\nbrought over from England (1737) upwards of one hundred families from\r\nthe north of Ireland, Scotland, and the border counties of England, and\r\nit is said that he resorted to stratagem to comply apparently with the\r\nconditions.[429:A] The first settlers of this Rockbridge tract were\r\nEphraim McDowell (ancestor of Governor James McDowell) and James\r\nGreenlee, in 1737. Mary Greenlee, his sister, attained the age of one\r\nhundred years and upwards, and was known to two or three generations.\r\nThe Scotch-Irish retained much of the superstitious nature of the\r\nHighlanders of Scotland, and Mary Greenlee was by many believed to be a\r\nwitch. At a very advanced age she rode erect on horseback. Robert and\r\nArchibald Alexander also settled in the Rockbridge region. Robert, a\r\ngraduate of Trinity College, Dublin, taught the first classical school\r\nwest of the Blue Ridge. Archibald, who was agent of Burden and drew up\r\nall his complex conveyances, was grandfather of the Rev. Dr. Archibald\r\nAlexander. Besides these, among the early settlers of this part of\r\nVirginia, were the families of Moore, Paxton, Telford, Lyle, Stuart,\r\nCrawford, Matthews, Brown, Wilson, Cummins, Caruthers, Campbell,\r\nMcCampbell, McClung, McKee, McCue, Grigsby, and others.[429:B]\r\n\r\nAn austere, thoughtful race, they constituted a manly, virtuous\r\npopulation. Their remote situation secured to them religious freedom,\r\nbut little interrupted by the ruling powers. Of the stern school of\r\nCalvin and Knox, so much derided for their Puritanical tenets, they were\r\nmore distinguished for their simplicity and integrity, their religious\r\neducation, and their uniform attendance on the exercises and ordinances\r\nof religion, than for the graceful and courteous manners which lend a\r\ncharm to the intercourse of a more aristocratic society. Trained in a\r\nsevere discipline, they expressed less than they felt; and keeping their\r\nfeelings under habitual restraint, they could call forth exertions equal\r\nto whatever exigencies might arise. In the wilderness they devoted\r\nthemselves to agriculture, domestic pursuits, and the arts of peace;\r\nthey were content to live at home. Pascal says that the cause of most of\r\nthe trouble in the world is that people are not content to live at home.\r\nAs soon as practicable they erected churches; and all within ten or\r\ntwelve miles, young and old, repaired on horseback to the place of\r\nworship. Their social intercourse was chiefly at religious meetings. The\r\ngay and fashionable amusements of Eastern Virginia were unknown among\r\nthem.[430:A] Other colonies, emanating from the same quarters, followed\r\nthe first, and settled that portion of the valley intervening between\r\nthe German settlements and the borders of the James River. The first\r\nPresbyterian minister settled west of the Blue Ridge was the Rev. John\r\nCraig, a native of the north of Ireland. His congregation was that of\r\nthe church then known as the Stone Meeting House, since Augusta Church,\r\nnear Staunton, in the County of Augusta. He became pastor there in the\r\nyear 1740. Augusta was then a wilderness with a handful of Christian\r\nsettlers in it; the Indians travelling through the country among them in\r\nsmall parties, unless supplied with whatever victuals they called for,\r\nbecame their own purveyors and cooks, and spared nothing that they chose\r\nto eat or drink. In general they were harmless; sometimes they committed\r\nmurders. Such was the school in which the tramontane population were to\r\nbe moulded and trained, civilizing the wilderness, and defending\r\nthemselves against the savages. In the month of December, 1743, Captain\r\nJohn McDowell, surveyor of the lands in Burden's grant, falling into an\r\nambush, was slain, together with eight comrades, in a skirmish with a\r\nparty of Shawnee Indians. This occurred at the junction of the North\r\nRiver with the James. The alarmed inhabitants of Timber-ridge[431:A]\r\nhastened to the spot, and, removing the dead bodies, sorrowfully\r\nperformed the rites of burial, while the savages, frightened at their\r\nown success, escaped beyond the mountains.\r\n\r\nSo rapid was the settlement of the valley about this time, that in this\r\nyear it was found necessary to lay off the whole country west of the\r\nBlue Ridge into the two new counties, Frederick and Augusta. The\r\npicturesque and verdant valleys embosomed among the mountains were\r\ngradually dotted with farms. The fertile County of Frederick was first\r\nsettled by Germans, Quakers, and Irish Presbyterians, from the adjoining\r\nprovince of Pennsylvania. A great part of the country lying between the\r\nNorth Mountain and the Shenandoah River, for one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles, and embracing ten counties, now adorned with fine forest trees,\r\nwas then an extensive open prairie--a sea of herbage--the pasture ground\r\nof buffalo, elk, and deer. It was a favorite hunting-ground, or middle\r\nground of the Indians.[431:B] The rich lands bordering the Shenandoah,\r\nand its north and south branches, were settled by a German population\r\nwhich long retained its language, its simplicity of manners and dress.\r\nAugusta County was settled by Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania,\r\n(descendants of the Covenanters,) a race respectable for intelligence,\r\nenergy, morality, and piety.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the petition of John Caldwell and others, the synod\r\nof Philadelphia (1738) addressed a letter to Governor Gooch, soliciting\r\nhis favor in behalf of such persons as should remove to Western\r\nVirginia, in allowing them \"the free enjoyment of their civil and\r\nreligious liberties;\" and the governor gave a favorable answer. This\r\nJohn Caldwell, who was grandfather of John Caldwell Calhoun, of South\r\nCarolina, led the way in colonizing Prince Edward, Charlotte, and\r\nCampbell Counties.\r\n\r\nColonel James Patton, of Donegal, a man of property, commander and owner\r\nof a ship, emigrating to Virginia about this time, obtained from the\r\ngovernor, for himself and his associates, a grant of one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand acres of land in the valley. He settled on the south\r\nfork of the Shenandoah. John Preston, a shipmaster in Dublin, a\r\nbrother-in-law of Patton, came over with him, and subsequently\r\nestablished himself near Staunton--the progenitor of a distinguished\r\nrace of his own name, and of the Browns and Breckenridges.[432:A] While\r\nthe first settlement of the valley took place in Hite's patent, nearer\r\nto Pennsylvania, the filling up of that region was somewhat retarded by\r\na claim which Lord Fairfax set up for a region westward of the Blue\r\nRidge, comprehending ten counties. This claim was grounded upon the\r\nterms of the conveyance which included all the country between the head\r\nof the Rappahannock and the head of the Potomac; and this river was\r\nfound to have its source in the Alleghanies. Although the claim was not\r\nadmitted by the Governor of Virginia, yet, as it involved settlers in\r\nthe danger of a lawsuit, they preferred moving farther on to the tract\r\nof country in Augusta County, included in the grants to Beverley and to\r\nBurden.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[423:A] Milton's Prose Works, i. 422, 430, 437.\r\n\r\n[424:A] Foote's Sketches of North Carolina; Grahame, ii. 57; Davidson's\r\nHist. of Presbyterian Church in Kentucky, 16.\r\n\r\n[424:B] Va.

In this year the town of Richmond was established by\r\nlaw, and the County of Louisa formed from a part of Hanover.\r\n\r\nGovernor Spotswood had effected a treaty (1722) with the Six Nations, by\r\nwhich they stipulated never to appear to the east of the Blue Ridge, nor\r\nsouth of the Potomac. As the Anglo-Saxon race gradually extended itself,\r\nlike a vapor, beyond the western base of that range, collisions with the\r\nnative tribes began to ensue. A treaty was concluded (July, 1744,) at\r\nLancaster, in Pennsylvania, by which the Six Nations unwillingly\r\nrelinquished, for four hundred pounds paid, and a further sum promised,\r\nthe country lying westward of the frontier of Virginia to the River\r\nOhio. The tomahawk was again buried, and the wampum belts of peace again\r\ndelivered, to brighten the silver chain of friendship. The Virginia\r\ncommissioners were men of high character, but they negotiated with the\r\nred men according to the custom of that day, and regaled them with\r\npunch, wine, and bumbo--that is, rum and water. The consideration\r\napparently so inadequate, was yet perhaps equivalent to the value of\r\ntheir title and the fidelity of their pledge. The expense of this treaty\r\nwas paid out of the royal quit-rents.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anthony Gavin, a zealous minister of St. James's Parish,\r\nGoochland, (1738,) complains to the Bishop of London of difficulties\r\nwith Quakers, who were countenanced by men in high station, and of the\r\ndisregard of Episcopal control in Virginia, the cognizance of spiritual\r\naffairs, by the laws of the colony, being in the hands of the governor\r\nand council, and that the greatest part of the ministers \"are taken up\r\nin farming, and buying slaves.\" The ministers were compelled either to\r\nhire or buy slaves to cultivate their glebes, on which they depended for\r\na livelihood.[434:A] The Rev. Mr. Gavin, besides his regular duties,\r\nappears to have performed a sort of missionary service, making distant\r\njourneys as far as to the country near the Blue Ridge.\r\n\r\nRobert Dinwiddie having been appointed (1741) surveyor-general of the\r\ncustoms, was named, as his predecessors had been, a member of the\r\nseveral councils of the colonies. Gooch readily complied with the royal\r\norder, but the council, prompted both by jealousy of Dinwiddie's\r\nfunctions and by an aristocratic exclusiveness, refused to allow him to\r\nact with them, and sent the king a remonstrance against it. The board of\r\ntrade decided the case in Dinwiddie's favor. We may see in this affair\r\nthe germ of that mutual jealousy which afterwards grew up between him\r\nand some of the leading characters in Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1743 died Edward Barradall, Esq., an eminent lawyer; he held\r\nthe office of attorney-general, judge of the admiralty court, and other\r\nhigh posts. He married Sarah, daughter of the Honorable William\r\nFitzhugh. He was buried in the churchyard in Williamsburg, where a Latin\r\nepitaph records his worth.\r\n\r\nIn the same year died the Rev. James Blair, Commissary to the Bishop of\r\nLondon. Finding his ministry in Scotland obstructed by popular\r\nprejudice, he retired to London, whence he was sent over to Virginia as\r\na missionary, (1685.) He was minister for Henrico Parish nine years; in\r\n1689 was appointed commissary. From Henrico he removed to Jamestown, in\r\norder to be near the college, which he was raising up. He became (1710)\r\nthe minister of Bruton Parish, and resided at Williamsburg. He was a\r\nminister in Virginia for about fifty-eight years, commissary for\r\nfifty-four years, and president of the college fifty years. His sermons,\r\none hundred and seventeen in number, expository of the Sermon on the\r\nMount, were published in England, (1722,) and passed through two\r\neditions. They are highly commended by Dr. Waterland and Dr. Doddridge.\r\nDr. Blair appears to have been a plain-spoken preacher, who had the\r\ncourage to speak the truth to an aristocratic congregation. Alluding in\r\none of these sermons to the custom of swearing, he says: \"I know of no\r\nvice that brings more scandal to our Church of England. The church may\r\nbe in danger from many enemies, but perhaps she is not so much in danger\r\nfrom any as from the great number of profane persons that pretend to be\r\nof her, enough to make all serious people afraid of our society, and to\r\nbring down the judgments of God upon us: 'by reason of swearing the land\r\nmourneth.' But be not deceived: our church has no principles that lead\r\nto swearing more than the Dissenters; but whatever church is uppermost,\r\nthere are always a great many who, having no religion at all, crowd into\r\nit, and bring it into disgrace and disreputation.\" Commissary Blair left\r\nhis library and five hundred pounds to the college of which he was the\r\nfounder, and ten thousand pounds to his nephew, John Blair, and his\r\nchildren.[435:A] Commissary Blair was alike eminent for energy,\r\nlearning, talents, piety, and a catholic spirit; he was a sincere lover\r\nof Virginia and her benefactor; his name is identified with her history,\r\nand his memory deserves to be held in enduring respect and veneration.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1743, William Fairfax, son of Lord Fairfax, proprietor of\r\nthe Northern Neck, was appointed one of the council in the place of Dr.\r\nBlair. The Rev. William Dawson succeeded him as president of the College\r\nof William and Mary, and as commissary.\r\n\r\nAbout this time also died Colonel William Byrd, of Westover, second of\r\nthe name, one of the council. A vast fortune enabled him to live in a\r\nstyle of hospitable splendor before unknown in Virginia. His extensive\r\nlearning was improved by a keen observation, and refined by an\r\nacquaintance and correspondence with the wits and noblemen of his day in\r\nEngland. His writings display a thorough knowledge of the natural and\r\ncivil history of the colony, and abound in photographic sketches of\r\nthe manners of his age. His diffuse style is relieved by frequent\r\nebullitions of humor, which, according to the spirit of his times, is\r\noften coarse and indelicate. His sarcasm is sometimes unjust, and his\r\nridicule frequently misplaced, yet his writings are among the most\r\nvaluable that have descended from his era, and to him is due the honor\r\nof having contributed more perhaps to the preservation of the historical\r\nmaterials of Virginia than any other of her sons, by the purchase of the\r\nRecords of the Virginia Company. He lies buried in the garden at\r\nWestover, where a marble monument bears the following inscription: \"Here\r\nlieth the Honorable William Byrd, Esq. Being born to one of the amplest\r\nfortunes in this country, he was sent early to England for his\r\neducation, where, under the care and direction of Sir Robert Southwell,\r\nand ever favored with his particular instructions, he made a happy\r\nproficiency in polite and various learning. By the means of the same\r\nnoble friend he was introduced to the acquaintance of many of the first\r\npersons of that age for knowledge, wit, virtue, birth, or high station,\r\nand particularly contracted a most intimate and bosom friendship with\r\nthe learned and illustrious Charles Boyle, Earl of Orrery. He was called\r\nto the bar in the Middle Temple; studied for some time in the Low\r\nCountries; visited the court of France, and was chosen Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society. Thus eminently fitted for the service and ornament of his\r\ncountry, he was made receiver-general of his majesty's revenues here;\r\nwas thrice appointed public agent to the court and ministry of England;\r\nand being thirty-seven years a member, at last became president of the\r\ncouncil of this colony. To all this were added a great elegancy of taste\r\nand life, the well-bred gentleman and polite companion, the splendid\r\neconomist, and prudent father of a family, withal the constant enemy of\r\nall exorbitant power, and hearty friend to the liberties of his country.\r\nNat. Mar. 28, 1674. Mort. Aug. 26, 1744. An. Ætat. 70.\" His portrait, a\r\nfine face, is preserved. Colonel Byrd amassed the finest private library\r\nwhich had then been seen in the New World, a catalogue of which, in\r\nquarto, is preserved in the Franklin Library, Philadelphia. Sir Robert\r\nSouthwell was envoy extraordinary to Portugal in 1665, and to Brussels\r\nin 1671; was subsequently clerk of the privy council, and was repeatedly\r\nchosen president of the Royal Society. He died in 1702.\r\n\r\nFrance, endeavoring to impose a popish pretender of the house of Stuart\r\nupon the people of England, the colonies were advised to put themselves\r\nin readiness against the threatened blow. Accordingly in the following\r\nyear the assembly met, but still adhering to a rigid economy, the\r\nburgesses refused to make any appropriation of money for that purpose.\r\nAbout this time Edward Trelawney, governor of Jamaica, was authorized to\r\nrecruit a regiment in Virginia. In 1745 a rebellion burst forth in\r\nScotland in favor of the Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, grandson of\r\nJames the Second. When intelligence of this event reached Virginia, the\r\nassembly was again called together, and the college, the clergy, and the\r\nassembly, unanimously pledged their private resources and those of the\r\ncolony to support the house of Hanover. A proclamation was also issued\r\nagainst Romish priests, sent, it was alleged, as emissaries from\r\nMaryland, to seduce the people of Virginia from their allegiance. The\r\ntidings of the overthrow of the Pretender by the Duke of Cumberland, at\r\nCulloden, on the 16th of April, 1746, were joyfully received in the\r\nAncient Dominion, and celebrated by burning the effigies of the\r\nunfortunate prince, and by bonfires, processions, and illuminations.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Rev. William Stith was engaged in composing his\r\n\"History of Virginia,\" at Varina, on the James River. It is much to be\r\nregretted that this accurate, judicious, and faithful writer did not\r\nreceive encouragement to complete the work down to his own times.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1746, the assembly appropriated four thousand pounds to the\r\nraising of Virginia's quota of troops for the invasion of Canada. They\r\nsailed from Hampton in June, under convoy of the Fowey man-of-war; the\r\nexpedition proved abortive. Governor Gooch, who had been appointed\r\ncommander, but had declined the appointment, was knighted during this\r\nyear. Not long afterwards the capitol at Williamsburg was burnt, and\r\nthe burgesses availed themselves of this conjuncture to propose the\r\nestablishment of the metropolis at a point more favorable to commerce;\r\nbut this scheme was rejected by the council. Governor Gooch, on\r\nthis occasion, appears to have exhibited some duplicity: in his\r\ncommunications to the board of trade he extolled the enlarged views of\r\nthe burgesses, while he censured the selfishness of the council; yet in\r\npublic he blamed the burgesses, \"as he thought this the best method to\r\nstifle the flame of contention.\" In this case he would seem not to have\r\nreckoned \"honesty the best policy;\" and it often is not, else there\r\nwould perhaps be more of it in the world; but it is certainly always\r\nbetter than policy.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1748 Petersburg and Blandford were incorporated. In the same\r\nyear the town of Staunton, in Augusta County, was laid off, and it was\r\nincorporated in the following year. This happened to be one of the\r\nacts repealed by the crown under subsequent protest of the house of\r\nburgesses; and another act of incorporation was not applied for until\r\nabout 1762-63. Hence originated a mistake in all the histories as to the\r\ndate of the charter.[438:A] Staunton thus appears to be the oldest town\r\nin the valley.\r\n\r\nThe assembly appointed a committee to revise the laws of Virginia; it\r\nconsisted of Peyton Randolph, Philip Ludwell, Beverley Whiting, Carter\r\nBurwell, and Benjamin Waller. During this year the vestries were\r\nauthorized to make presentation to benefices, an act which Bishop\r\nSherlock complained of as a serious encroachment on the rights of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nDissent from the established church began to develope itself in\r\nVirginia. In 1740 the celebrated Whitefield, then about twenty-six years\r\nof age, preached at Williamsburg, by the invitation of Commissary Blair.\r\nThe extraordinary religious excitement which took place at this time in\r\nAmerica, and which was increased by the impassioned eloquence of\r\nWhitefield, was styled \"the New Light Stir.\" It produced a temporary\r\nschism in the American Presbyterian Church, and the two parties were\r\nknown as Old Side and New Side. The Synod of Philadelphia was Old Side;\r\nthe Presbyteries of New Castle, New Brunswick, and New York, New Side.\r\nThe preachers of the New Side were often styled \"New Lights.\" A hundred\r\nyears before, the Presbyterians of Ireland denounced the sectarian (or\r\nCromwell) party of England, as those who \"vilify public ordinances,\r\nspeak evil of church government, and invent damnable errors, under the\r\nspecious pretence of a gospel-way and new light.\"[439:A]\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1740 and 1743 a few families of Hanover County, in\r\nLower Virginia, withdrawing themselves from attendance at the services\r\nof the established church, were accustomed to meet for worship at the\r\nhouse of Samuel Morris, the zealous leader of this little company of\r\ndissenters. One of these, a planter, had been first aroused by a few\r\nleaves of \"Boston's Fourfold State,\" that fell into his hands. Morris,\r\nan obscure man, a bricklayer, of singular simplicity of character,\r\nsincere, devout, earnest, was in the habit of reading to his neighbors\r\nfrom a few favorite religious works, particularly \"Luther on the\r\nGalatians,\" and his \"Table-Talk,\" with the view of communicating to\r\nothers impressions that had been made on himself. Having (1743) come\r\ninto possession of a volume of Whitefield's Sermons, preached at\r\nGlasgow, he commenced reading them to his audience, who met to hear them\r\non Sunday and on other days. The concern of some of the hearers on these\r\noccasions was such that they cried out and wept bitterly. Morris's\r\ndwelling-house being too small to contain his increasing congregation,\r\nit was determined to build a meeting-house merely for reading, and it\r\ncame to be called \"Morris's Reading-Room.\" None of them being in the\r\nhabit of extemporaneous prayer no one dared to undertake it. Morris was\r\nsoon invited to read these sermons in other parts of the country, and\r\nthus other reading-houses were established. Those who frequented them\r\nwere fined for absenting themselves from church, and Morris himself\r\noften incurred this penalty. When called on by the general court to\r\ndeclare to what denomination they belonged, these unsophisticated\r\ndissenters, knowing little of any such except the Quakers, and not\r\nknowing what else to call themselves, assumed for the present the name\r\nof Lutherans, (unaware that this appellation had been appropriated by\r\nany others,) but shortly afterwards they relinquished that name.[439:B]\r\n\r\nPartaking in the religious excitement which then pervaded the colonies,\r\nlimited in information and in the means of obtaining it, these\r\nunorganized dissenters became bewildered by discordant opinions. Some of\r\nthem seemed to be verging toward antinomianism; and it came to be a\r\nquestion among them whether it was right to pray, since prayer could not\r\nalter the Divine purposes, and it might be impious to desire that it\r\nshould. At length, Morris and some of his associates were summoned to\r\nappear before the governor and council at Williamsburg. Having discarded\r\nthe name of Lutherans, and not knowing what to call themselves, they\r\nwere filled with apprehensions in the prospect of the interview. One of\r\nthem making the journey to Williamsburg alone, met with, at a house on\r\nthe way, an old Scotch Presbyterian \"Confession of Faith,\" which he\r\nrecognized as embodying his own creed. The book being given to him, upon\r\nrejoining his friends at Williamsburg they examined it together, and\r\nthey determined to adopt it as their confession of faith. When called\r\nbefore the governor and council and interrogated, they exhibited the\r\nbook as containing their creed. Gooch, being a Scotchman, and, as is\r\nsaid, having been educated a Presbyterian, immediately remarked, on\r\nseeing the book, \"These men are Presbyterians,\" and recognized their\r\nright to the privileges of the toleration act. The interview between the\r\ngovernor and council and Morris and his friends, was interrupted by a\r\nthunder-storm of extraordinary fury; the council was softened; and this\r\nwas one of a series of incidents which Morris and his companions looked\r\nupon as providentially instrumental in bringing about the favorable\r\nissue of this affair.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Robinson, a Presbyterian, was the first minister, not\r\nof the Church of England, that preached in Hanover. The son of a Quaker\r\nphysician near Carlyle, in England, he emigrated to America, and (1743)\r\nsent out by the Presbytery of New Brunswick, visited the frontier\r\nsettlements of Virginia and North Carolina. Near Winchester he was\r\napprehended by the sheriff, to be sent to the governor to answer for\r\npreaching without license, but the sheriff soon released him. He\r\npreached among the Scotch-Irish settlers of Charlotte, Prince Edward,\r\nCampbell, and Albemarle, and in Charlotte established a congregation.\r\nOvertaken at Rockfish Gap by a deputation from Hanover, he was induced\r\nto return and visit that county, and he preached for some days to large\r\ncongregations, some of his hearers publicly giving utterance to their\r\nemotions, and many being converted. Before his departure he corrected\r\nsome of the errors into which the dissenters had fallen, and taught them\r\nto conduct public worship with better order, prayer and singing being\r\nnow introduced, so that \"he brought them into some kind of church order\r\non the Presbyterian model.\"[441:A] He was followed shortly afterwards by\r\nthe Rev. John Blair, whose preaching was equally impressive. Another\r\nmissionary, the Rev. John Roan, from the New Castle Presbytery, preached\r\nto crowded congregations there and in the neighboring counties. The\r\nconsequent excitement, and his speaking freely in public and in private\r\nof the delinquency of the parish ministers, and his denouncing them with\r\nunsparing invective, in spite of reproaches, ridicule, and threats, gave\r\nalarm to them and their supporters, and measures were concerted to\r\narrest the inroads of these offensive innovations. To aggravate the\r\nindignation of the government a witness swore \"that he heard Mr. Roan\r\nutter blasphemous expressions in his sermons,\" preached at the house of\r\nJoshua Morris, in James City County.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the general court in April, Governor Gooch, in his\r\ncharge to the grand jury, denounced, in strong terms, \"certain false\r\nteachers lately crept into this government, who, without order or\r\nlicense, or producing any testimonial of their education or sect,\r\nprofessing themselves ministers under the pretended influence of new\r\nlight, extraordinary impulse, and such like satirical [sic] and\r\nenthusiastic knowledge, lead the innocent and ignorant people into all\r\nkinds of delusion.\" He even suspected them to be Romish emissaries,\r\nsaying, \"their religious professions are very justly suspected to be the\r\nresult of jesuitical policy, which also is an iniquity to be punished\r\nby the judges.\" He calls upon the jury to present and indict these\r\noffenders. On the next day the jury presented John Roan for \"reflecting\r\nupon and vilifying the established religion,\" and Thomas Watkins, of\r\nHenrico County, for saying \"your churches and chapels are no better than\r\nthe synagogues of Satan,\" and Joshua Morris, \"for permitting John Roan,\r\nthe aforementioned preacher, and very many people, to assemble in an\r\nunlawful manner at his house on the seventh, eighth, and ninth of\r\nJanuary last past.\"\r\n\r\nThe intolerant spirit of the government continuing unabated, the\r\nConjunct Presbyteries of New Castle and New Brunswick, at the instance\r\nof Morris and some of his friends, who were apprehensive of severe\r\nmeasures being adopted against them, sent an address in their behalf to\r\nGovernor Gooch, by two clergymen, Gilbert Tennent and Samuel Finley.\r\nThey were respectfully received, and allowed to preach in Hanover, where\r\nthey remained for a week.\r\n\r\nThe Synod of Philadelphia being now apprehensive that their\r\ncongregations in the valley of Virginia might also be involved in the\r\npenalties threatened by the governor, in May, 1745, in an address to\r\nhim, disclaimed all connection with the Presbytery of New Castle, which\r\nhad commissioned Mr. Roan, and expressed their deep regret that any who\r\nassume the name of Presbyterians should be guilty of conduct so\r\nuncharitable and so unchristian as that mentioned in his honor's charge\r\nto the grand jury; and they assure him that these persons never belonged\r\nto their body, but were missionaries sent out by some who, in May, 1741,\r\nhad been excluded from the Synod of Philadelphia by reason of their\r\ndivisive and uncharitable doctrines and practices, and whose object was,\r\nin a spirit of rivalry, \"to divide and trouble the churches.\" To this\r\naddress Gooch made a very kind and respectful reply.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the ensuing year he issued a proclamation against the\r\nMoravians, New Lights, and Methodists, prohibiting their meetings under\r\nsevere penalties. There would seem to be some inconsistency in bringing\r\nsuch harsh and sweeping charges against those ministers whom he had\r\nrecently received so courteously, and had permitted to preach. Perhaps\r\nwhen he at first reckoned the visits of these missionaries transient,\r\nand their influence inconsiderable, he was willing to indulge his\r\ncourtesy and obliging disposition toward them; but when dissent was\r\nfound spreading with such unexpected rapidity, Gooch, together with the\r\nclergy and other friends of the establishment, became alarmed, and had\r\nrecourse to measures of intolerance, which they would rather have\r\navoided. Besides this, the address of the Synod of Philadelphia could\r\nnot but confirm the unfavorable opinion at first formed of the\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[434:A] Bishop Meade's Old Churches, etc., i. 456.\r\n\r\n[435:A] Old Churches, i. 154, 165; Evang. and Lit.

The\r\nnumber of burgesses was 52. Of the fifty-four parishes, thirty or forty\r\nwere supplied. The twelve vestrymen having the presentation of ministers\r\nwere styled \"the patrons of the church.\" The governor's salary, together\r\nwith perquisites, amounted to three thousand pounds per annum. The\r\npresident of the council acting as governor received a salary of five\r\nhundred pounds, and also a small amount paid him as a councillor. The\r\nprofessors of William and Mary College, when they began with experiments\r\non plants and minerals, were assisted by the French refugees at\r\nManakintown. Dr. Bray procured contributions of books for the\r\nlibrary.[444:A]\r\n\r\nSweet-scented tobacco, the most valuable in the world, was found in the\r\nstrip of country between the York and the James. The number of hogsheads\r\nof tobacco shipped from Virginia and Maryland together annually was\r\n70,000, of which half was consumed in England, and half exported to\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nThis trade employed two hundred ships, and yielded his majesty's\r\ntreasury a revenue of upwards of £300,000, in time of peace. Jamestown\r\nat this time contained several brick houses, with sundry taverns and\r\neating-houses,--sixty or seventy houses in all. Williamsburg or\r\nWilliamstadt contained twenty or thirty houses. There was a fort or\r\nbattery erected there mounting ten or twelve guns. Governor Nicholson\r\ncaused several streets to be laid out in the form of a W, in honor of\r\nKing William the Third, but a V or one angle of it was not as yet\r\ncompleted, and the plan appears to have been given up. The main street\r\nwas three-quarters of a mile long, and very wide; at one end of it was\r\nthe college, and at the other the capitol. The college was thought to be\r\nsomething like Chelsea Hospital. The capitol, in the shape of an H, is\r\ndescribed as \"a noble pile.\" The church was \"adorned and convenient as\r\nthe best churches in London.\" Besides these there were an octagon\r\nmagazine for arms and ammunition, a bowling-green, and a play-house.\r\nThere were several private houses of brick, with many rooms on a floor,\r\nbut not high. It was observed that wherever the water was brackish, it\r\nwas sickly; but Williamsburg was on a healthy site.[445:A] Gloucester\r\nwas at this time the most populous county; Essex or Rappahannock\r\n\"overrun with briars, thorns, and wild beasts.\" The Atlantic Ocean is\r\ndenominated the \"Virginian Sea.\"[445:B]\r\n\r\nWhitefield, while at Charleston, in South Carolina, during the spring of\r\n1747, being presented with a sum of money, expended it in the purchase\r\nof a plantation and negroes for the support of the orphan-house.[445:C]\r\nHaving come on to Virginia, in a letter written from Williamsburg in\r\nApril of that year, he says to a friend in Philadelphia: \"Men in power\r\nhere seem to be alarmed; but truth is great and will prevail. I am to\r\npreach this morning.\" By a remarkable coincidence, Samuel Davies, so\r\npre-eminently instrumental in organizing and extending Presbyterianism\r\nin Middle Virginia, happened to come to Virginia about the same time. He\r\nwas born in the County of New Castle, Pennsylvania, now Delaware,\r\nNovember 3d, 1723, of Welsh extraction, on both paternal and maternal\r\nside. He was educated principally in Pennsylvania, under the care of the\r\nRev. Samuel Blair, at Fagg's Manor, where he was thoroughly instructed\r\nin the classics, sciences, and theology. By close study his slender\r\nframe was enfeebled. He married Sarah Kirkpatrick in October, 1746.\r\nDeputed to perform a mission in so perplexing a field, without\r\nexperience, and in delicate health, he started with hesitation and\r\nreluctance. Passing down the Eastern Shore associated with the labors of\r\nMakemie, Davies came to Williamsburg. Here he applied to the general\r\ncourt for license to preach at three meeting-houses in Hanover, and one\r\nin Henrico. The council hesitated to comply; but, by the governor's\r\ninfluence, the license was obtained on the fourteenth of April. The\r\nmembers of the court present on this occasion were William Gooch,\r\nGovernor; John Robinson, John Grymes, John Custis, Philip Lightfoot,\r\nThomas Lee, Lewis Burwell, William Fairfax, John Blair, William Nelson,\r\nEsqs.; William Dawson, Clerk. This was only two days after Whitefield\r\nhad preached in Williamsburg, and he and Davies were probably there at\r\nthe same time. Davies, proceeding at once to Hanover, was received with\r\njoy, since, on the preceding Sunday, a proclamation had been attached to\r\nthe door of Morris's Reading-house, requiring magistrates to suppress\r\nitinerant preachers, and warning the people against gathering to hear\r\nthem. After a brief sojourn, returning home, he languished under ill\r\nhealth, aggravated by the sudden death of his wife, and threatening to\r\ncut him off prematurely. He, however, recovered sufficient strength to\r\nreturn to Hanover in May, 1748, and settled at a place about twelve\r\nmiles from the falls of the James River. In this second visit he was\r\naccompanied by the Rev. John Rodgers, who, finding it impossible to\r\nobtain permission to settle in Virginia, returned to the North. Governor\r\nGooch favored the application, but a majority of the council stood out\r\nagainst it, saying: \"We have Mr. Rodgers out, and we are determined to\r\nkeep him out.\" Some of the clergy of the established church were\r\nvehement in their opposition to Davies and Rodgers. A majority of the\r\ncouncil lent their countenance to this opposition, but Gooch took\r\noccasion to rebuke it in severe terms. John Blair, nephew of the\r\ncommissary, Commissary Dawson, and another member of the council, whose\r\nname is forgotten, united with the governor on this occasion in treating\r\nthe strangers kindly, and endeavored to procure a reconsideration of the\r\ncase, but in vain. According to Burk,[447:A] most of the intelligent men\r\nof that day, including Edmund Pendleton, appear in the character of\r\npersecutors. It must be remembered, however, that the council and its\r\nfriends had no right to proclaim religious freedom, and that the\r\ncontroversy depended on the true interpretation of the act of parliament\r\nand the Virginia statutes. These made the law, and the council was but\r\nthe executive of the law, without authority to repeal or amend it.\r\n\r\nDavies was now left to labor alone in Virginia. In April the court\r\ndecided the long-pending suits against Isaac Winston, Sr., and Samuel\r\nMorris, by fining them each twenty shillings and the costs of\r\nprosecution. Severe laws had been passed in Virginia in accordance with\r\nthe English act of uniformity, and enforcing attendance at the parish\r\nchurch. The toleration act was little understood in Virginia; Davies\r\nexamined it carefully, and satisfied himself that it was in force in the\r\ncolony, not, indeed, by virtue of its original enactment in England, but\r\nbecause it had been expressly recognized and adopted by an act of the\r\nVirginia assembly.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1748, licenses were with difficulty obtained upon the\r\npetitions of the dissenters for three other meeting-houses lying in\r\nCaroline, Louisa, and Goochland. Davies was only about twenty-three\r\nyears of age; yet his fervid eloquence attracted large congregations,\r\nincluding many churchmen. On several occasions he found it necessary to\r\ndefend the cause of the dissenters at the bar of the general court. When\r\non one occasion, by permission, he rose to reply to the argument of\r\nPeyton Randolph, the king's attorney-general, a titter at first ran\r\nthrough the court; but it ceased at the utterance of the very first\r\nsentence, and his masterly argument extorted admiration; and during his\r\nstay in Williamsburg he received many civilities, especially from the\r\nHonorable John Blair, of the council, and Sir William Gooch. Samuel\r\nDavies happening to be in London at the same time with Peyton Randolph,\r\nsome years afterwards, mentions him in his Diary as \"my old adversary,\"\r\nand adds, \"he will, no doubt, oppose whatever is done in favor of the\r\ndissenters in Hanover.\" Davies, who was a man of exquisite sensibility,\r\nrepeatedly alludes to the torture to which his feelings had been\r\nsubjected by the mortifications that he suffered when appearing before\r\nthe general court.\r\n\r\nThere was eventually obtained from Sir Dudley Rider, the king's\r\nattorney-general in England, a decision confirming the view which Davies\r\nhad taken of the toleration act. He expressed himself in regard to the\r\ngovernor and council as follows: \"The Honorable Sir William Gooch, our\r\nlate governor, discovered a ready disposition to allow us all claimable\r\nprivileges, and the greatest aversion to persecuting measures; but\r\nconsidering the shocking reports spread abroad concerning us by\r\nofficious malignants, it was no great wonder the council discovered a\r\nconsiderable reluctance to tolerate us. Had it not been for this, I\r\npersuade myself they would have shown themselves the guardians of our\r\nlegal privileges, as well as generous patriots to their country, which\r\nis the character generally given them.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"State of Religion among the Dissenters,\" Davies remarks: \"There\r\nare and have been in this colony a great number of Scotch merchants, who\r\nwere educated Presbyterians, but (I speak what their conduct more loudly\r\nproclaims) they generally, upon their arrival here, prove scandals to\r\ntheir religion and country by their loose principles and immoral\r\npractices, and either fall into indifferency about religion in general,\r\nor affect to be polite by turning deists, or fashionable by conforming\r\nto the church.\" Of the dissenters in Virginia he says, that at the first\r\nthey were not properly dissenters from the original constitution of the\r\nChurch of England, but rather dissented from those who had forsaken it.\r\n\r\nSir William Gooch, who had now been governor of Virginia for twenty-two\r\nyears, left the colony, with his family, in August, 1749, amid the\r\nregrets of the people. Notwithstanding some flexibility of principle, he\r\nappears to have been estimable in public and private character. His\r\ncapacity and intelligence were of a high order, and were adorned by\r\nuniform courtesy and dignity, and singular amenity of manners. If he\r\nexhibited something of intolerance toward the close of his\r\nadministration, he seems, nevertheless, to have commanded the esteem and\r\nrespect of the dissenters. After his departure from Virginia he\r\ncontinued to be the steady friend of the colony. A county was named\r\nafter him.[449:A] During Sir William Gooch's administration, from 1728\r\nto 1749, the population of Virginia had nearly doubled, and there had\r\nbeen added one-third to the extent of her settlements.[449:B] The taxes\r\nwere light, industry revived, foreign commerce increased, and Virginia\r\nenjoyed a prosperity hitherto unknown. The frugal and industrious\r\nGermans were filling up one portion of the valley and the Piedmont\r\ncountry; the hardy, well-disciplined, and energetic Scotch-Irish were\r\npeopling the other portion of the valley, and planting colonies eastward\r\nof the Blue Ridge. Like the strawberry, the population continually sent\r\nout \"runners\" to possess the land. The contact and commingling of the\r\nEnglish, the French, the German, the Scotch, the Irish, while it brought\r\nabout some collision, yet produced an excitement which was salutary and\r\nbeneficial to all. So the meeting of the opposite currents of\r\nelectricity, although accompanied by a shock, results in the renovation\r\nof the atmosphere. The people of Eastern Virginia and the inhabitants of\r\nthe valley have each been benefited by the other; each section has its\r\nvirtues and its faults, its advantages and its disadvantages, and\r\nVirginia does not derive its character from either one, but the elements\r\nof both are mixed up in her. This is not the result of chance, or the\r\nmere work of man, but the order of a superintending Providence that\r\npresides in human affairs.\r\n\r\nThe government of Virginia now devolved upon John Robinson, Sr.,\r\npresident of the council, but he dying in a few days, Thomas Lee\r\nsucceeded as president. Had Lee lived longer, it was believed his\r\ninfluence and connexions in England would have secured for him the\r\nappointment of deputy governor. He was father of Philip Ludwell, Richard\r\nHenry, Thomas L., Arthur, Francis Lightfoot, and William. As\r\nWestmoreland, their native county, is distinguished above all others in\r\nVirginia as the birth-place of great men, so perhaps no other Virginian\r\nwas the father of so many distinguished sons as President Lee.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Albemarle, after whom the county of that name was called,\r\nwas still titular governor-in-chief. Of this nobleman, when ambassador\r\nat Paris, Horace Walpole says: \"It was convenient to him to be anywhere\r\nbut in England. His debts were excessive, though ambassador, groom of\r\nthe stole, governor of Virginia, and colonel of a regiment of guards.\r\nHis figure was genteel, his manner noble and agreeable. The rest of his\r\nmerit was the interest Lady Albemarle had with the king through Lady\r\nYarmouth. He had all his life imitated the French manners till he came\r\nto Paris, where he never conversed with a Frenchman. If good breeding is\r\nnot different from good sense, Lord Albemarle, at least, knew how to\r\ndistinguish it from good nature. He would bow to his postillion while he\r\nwas ruining his tailor.\"\r\n\r\nLee was succeeded by Lewis Burwell, of Gloucester County, also president\r\nof the council. During his brief administration, some Cherokee chiefs,\r\nwith a party of warriors, visited Williamsburg for the purpose, as they\r\nprofessed, of opening a direct trade with Virginia. A party of the\r\nNottoways, animated by inveterate hostility, approached to attack them;\r\nand the Cherokees raised the war song; but President Burwell effected a\r\nreconciliation, and they sat down and smoked together the pipe of peace.\r\nA New York company of players were permitted to erect a theatre in\r\nWilliamsburg. President Burwell, who was educated in England, was\r\ndistinguished for his scholarship; he is said to have embraced almost\r\nevery branch of human knowledge within the circle of his studies. The\r\nBurwells are descended from an ancient family of that name of the\r\nCounties of Bedford and Northampton, England. The first of the family,\r\nMajor Lewis Burwell, came over to Virginia at an early date, and settled\r\nin Gloucester. He died in 1658, two hundred years ago. He appears to\r\nhave married Lucy, daughter of Captain Robert Higginson, one of the\r\nfirst commanders that \"subdued the country of Virginia from the power of\r\nthe heathen.\" She survived till the year 1675.\r\n\r\nMatthew Burwell married Abigail Smith, descended from the celebrated\r\nfamily of Bacon, and heiress of the Honorable Nathaniel Bacon, President\r\nof Virginia. Nathaniel Burwell, who died in 1721, married Elizabeth,\r\neldest daughter of Robert Carter, Esq. Carter's Creek, the old seat of\r\nthe Burwells, is situated in Gloucester, on a creek of that name, and\r\nnot far back from the York River. The stacks of antique diamond-shaped\r\nchimneys, and the old-fashioned panelling of the interior, remind the\r\nvisitor that Virginia is truly the \"Ancient Dominion.\" There is the\r\nfamily graveyard shaded with locusts, and overrun with parasites and\r\ngrape-vines.

A vast tract of\r\nland, mostly lying west of the mountains and south of the Ohio, was\r\ngranted by the king about the year 1749, to a company of planters and\r\nmerchants. This scheme appears to have been brought forward in the\r\npreceding year by Thomas Lee of the council, and he became associated\r\nwith twelve persons in Virginia and Maryland, and with Mr. Hanbury, a\r\nLondon Quaker merchant, and they were incorporated as \"The Ohio\r\nCompany.\" Lawrence and Augustine Washington were early and prominent\r\nmembers of this company. The company sent out Mr. Christopher Gist to\r\nexplore the country on the Ohio as far as the falls. He was, like Boone,\r\nfrom the banks of the Yadkin, an expert pioneer, at home in the\r\nwilderness and among the Indians, adventurous, hardy, and intrepid.\r\nCrossing the Ohio, he found the country well watered and wooded, with\r\nhere and there plains covered with wild rye, or meadows of blue grass\r\nand clover. He observed numerous buffaloes, deer, elk, and wild turkeys.\r\nReturning to the Ohio and recrossing it, Gist proceeded toward the\r\nCuttawa or Kentucky River. Ascending to the summit of a mountain, he\r\nbeheld that magnificent region long before it was seen by Daniel\r\nBoone.[453:A]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of June, 1752, a treaty was effected with the western\r\nIndians at Logstown, on the Ohio, by which they agreed not to molest any\r\nsettlements that might be made on the southeast side of the Ohio.\r\nColonel Fry and two other commissioners represented Virginia on this\r\noccasion, while Gist appeared as agent of the Ohio Company.\r\n\r\nThomas Lee, the projector of this company, having not survived long\r\nafter its incorporation, the chief conduct of it fell into the hands of\r\nLawrence Washington. Governor Dinwiddie and George Mason were also\r\nmembers. There were twenty shares and as many members. Lawrence\r\nWashington, being desirous of colonizing Germans on the company's lands,\r\nwrote to Mr. Hanbury as follows: \"While the unhappy state of my health\r\ncalled me back to our springs,[453:B] I conversed with all the\r\nPennsylvanian Dutch whom I met with, either there or elsewhere, and much\r\nrecommended their settling on the Ohio. The chief reason against it was,\r\nthe paying of an English clergyman, when few understood and none made\r\nuse of him. It has been my opinion, and I hope ever will be, that\r\nrestraints on conscience are cruel in regard to those on whom they are\r\nimposed, and injurious to the country imposing them. England, Holland,\r\nand Prussia, I may quote as examples, and much more, Pennsylvania, which\r\nhas flourished under that delightful liberty so as to become the\r\nadmiration of every man who considers the short time it has been\r\nsettled. As the ministry have thus far shown the true spirit of\r\npatriotism, by encouraging the extending of our dominions in America, I\r\ndoubt not by an application they would still go farther, and complete\r\nwhat they have begun, by procuring some kind of charter to prevent the\r\nresidents on the Ohio and its branches from being subject to parish\r\ntaxes. They all assured me that they might have from Germany any number\r\nof settlers, could they but obtain their favorite exemption. I have\r\npromised to endeavor for it, and now do my utmost by this letter. I am\r\nwell assured we shall never obtain it by a law here. This colony was\r\ngreatly settled, in the latter part of Charles the First's time and\r\nduring the usurpation, by the zealous churchmen, and that spirit which\r\nwas then brought in has ever since continued, so that, except a few\r\nQuakers, we have no dissenters. But what has been the consequence? We\r\nhave increased by slow degrees, except negroes and convicts, while our\r\nneighboring colonies, whose natural advantages are greatly inferior to\r\nours, have become populous.\"[454:A] He also wrote to Governor Dinwiddie,\r\nthen in England, to the same effect. He replied that it would be\r\ndifficult to obtain the desired exemption for the Dutch settlers, but\r\npromised to use his utmost endeavors to effect it. It does not appear\r\nwhether the ministry ever came to a decision on this subject. The\r\nnon-conformists augured favorably of Dinwiddie's administration. The\r\nRev. Jonathan Edwards, in a letter addressed to Rev. John Erskine, of\r\nthe Kirk of Scotland, says: \"What you write of the appointment of a\r\ngentleman to the office of lieutenant-governor of Virginia, who is a\r\nfriend to religion, is an event that the friends of religion in America\r\nhave great reason to rejoice in, by reason of the late revival of\r\nreligion in that province, and the opposition that has been made against\r\nit, and the great endeavors to crush it by many of the chief men of the\r\nprovince. Mr. Davies, in a letter I lately received from him, dated\r\nMarch 2d, 1752, mentions the same thing. His words are, 'We have a new\r\ngovernor who is a candid, condescending gentleman. And as he has been\r\neducated in the Church of Scotland, he has a respect for the\r\nPresbyterians, which I hope is a happy omen.'\" Jonathan Edwards was\r\ninvited in the summer of 1751 to come and settle in Virginia, and a\r\nhandsome sum was subscribed for his support; but he was installed at\r\nStockbridge, in Massachusetts, before the messenger from Virginia\r\nreached him.[454:B]\r\n\r\nDinwiddie, the new governor, an able man, had been a clerk to a\r\ncollector in a West India custom-house, whose enormous defalcation he\r\nexposed to the government; and for this service, it is said, he was\r\npromoted, in 1741, to the office of surveyor of the customs for the\r\ncolonies, and now to the post of governor of Virginia. She was at this\r\ntime one of the most populous and the most wealthy of all the\r\nAnglo-American colonies. Dinwiddie, upon his arrival, gave offence by\r\ndeclaring the king's dissent to certain acts which Gooch had approved;\r\nand in June, 1752, the assembly remonstrated against this exercise of\r\nthe royal prerogative; but their remonstrance proved unavailing. The\r\nVirginians were in the habit of acquiring lands without expense, by\r\nmeans of a warrant of a survey without a patent. Dinwiddie found a\r\nmillion of unpatented acres thus possessed, and he established, with the\r\nadvice of the council, a fee of a pistole (equivalent to three dollars\r\nand sixty cents) for every seal annexed to a grant. Against this measure\r\nthe assembly, in December, 1753, passed strong resolutions, and declared\r\nthat whoever should pay that fee should be considered a betrayer of the\r\nrights of the people; and they sent the attorney-general, Peyton\r\nRandolph, as their agent, to England, with a salary of two thousand\r\npounds, to procure redress. The board of trade, after virtually deciding\r\nin favor of Dinwiddie, recommended a compromise of the dispute, and\r\nadvised him to reinstate Randolph in the office of attorney-general, as\r\nthe times required harmony and mutual confidence. The assembly appear to\r\nhave been much disturbed upon a small occasion. During Randolph's\r\nabsence Dinwiddie wrote to a correspondent in England: \"I have had a\r\ngreat deal of trouble and uneasiness from the factious disputes and\r\nviolent heats of a most impudent, troublesome party here, in regard to\r\nthat silly fee of a pistole; they are very full of the success of their\r\nparty, which I give small notice to.\"\r\n\r\nThe natural prejudice felt by the aristocracy of Virginia against\r\nDinwiddie, as an untitled Scotchman, was increased by a former\r\naltercation with him. When, in 1741, he was made surveyor-general of the\r\ncustoms, he was appointed, as his predecessors had been, a member of the\r\nseveral councils of the colonies. Gooch obeyed the order; but the\r\ncouncil, prompted by their old jealousy of the surveyor-general's\r\ninterfering with their municipal laws, and still more by their\r\noverweening exclusiveness, refused to permit him to act with them,\r\neither in the council or on the bench. The board of trade decided the\r\ncontroversy in favor of Dinwiddie.[456:A]\r\n\r\nIt was during Dinwiddie's administration that the name of George\r\nWashington began to attract public attention. The curiosity of his\r\nadmirers has traced the family back to the Conquest. Sir William\r\nWashington, of Packington, in the County of Kent, married a sister of\r\nGeorge Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and favorite of Charles the First.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel James Washington, taking up arms in the royal cause,\r\nlost his life at the siege of Pontefract Castle. Sir Henry Washington,\r\nson and heir of Sir William, distinguished himself while serving under\r\nPrince Rupert, at the storming of Bristol, in 1643, and again a few\r\nyears after, while in command of Worcester. His uncles, John and\r\nLawrence Washington, in the year 1657, emigrated to Virginia, and\r\nsettled in Westmoreland. John married a Miss Anne Pope, and resided at\r\nBridge's or Bridge Creek, in that county. It is he who has been before\r\nmentioned as commanding the Virginia troops against the Indians not long\r\nbefore the breaking out of Bacon's rebellion. He and his brother\r\nLawrence both died in 1677; their wills are preserved; they both appear\r\nto have had estates in England as well as in Virginia. His grandson,\r\nAugustine, father of George, born in 1694, married first in April, 1715,\r\nJane Butler; and their two sons, Lawrence and Augustine, survived their\r\nchildhood. In March, 1730, Augustine Washington, Sr., married secondly,\r\nMary Ball. The issue of this union were four sons, George, Samuel, John\r\nAugustine, and Charles, and two daughters, Elizabeth or Betty, and\r\nMildred, who died an infant. George Washington was born on the\r\ntwenty-second day of February, N. S., 1732. The birth-place is sometimes\r\ncalled Bridge's Creek, and sometimes Pope's Creek; the house stood about\r\na mile apart between the two creeks, but nearer to Pope's. Of the\r\nsteep-roofed house which overlooked the Potomac, a brick chimney and\r\nsome scattered bricks alone remain. George, it is seen, was the eldest\r\nchild of a second marriage.\r\n\r\nNot long after his birth his father removed to a seat opposite\r\nFredericksburg; and this was the scene of George's boyhood; but the\r\nhouse has disappeared. He received only a plain English education,\r\nhaving obtained his first instruction at an old field school, under a\r\nteacher named Hobby--the parish sexton. The military spirit pervading\r\nthe colony reached the school; in these military amusements George\r\nWashington was predominant; but he found a competitor in William Bustle.\r\n\r\nAugustine Washington, the father of George, died in April, 1743, aged\r\nforty-nine years. He left a large estate. Not long afterwards Lawrence\r\nWashington married Anne, eldest daughter of the Honorable William\r\nFairfax, and took up his residence at Mount Vernon, in Fairfax County.\r\nAugustine resided at Bridge's Creek, and married Anne, daughter of\r\nWilliam Aylett, Esq., of Westmoreland County. George remained under the\r\ncare of his mother, and was sent to stay for a time with his brother\r\nAugustine, to go to a school under charge of a teacher named Williams.\r\nIt is probable that, as he taught him his daily lesson, he little\r\nanticipated the figure which his pupil was destined to make in the\r\nworld. While he became thorough in what he learned he became expert in\r\nmanly and athletic exercises. As he advanced in years he was a frequent\r\nguest at Mount Vernon, and became familiar with the Fairfax family at\r\nBelvoir, (called in England Beaver,) a few miles below, on the Potomac.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1747, when George was in his fourteenth year, a midshipman's\r\nwarrant was obtained for him by his brother Lawrence. His father-in-law,\r\nWilliam Fairfax, in September of the preceding year, had written to him:\r\n\"George has been with us, and says he will be steady, and thankfully\r\nfollow your advice as his best friend.\" From his promise to be steady,\r\nit may be inferred that he was then not so. And from his consenting to\r\nfollow thankfully his brother's advice, it would appear that the plan of\r\nhis going to sea originated with Lawrence, and not from George's strong\r\nbent that way, as has been commonly stated.\r\n\r\nWhile the matter was still undetermined, his uncle, Joseph Ball, who,\r\nhaving married an English lady, had settled as a lawyer in London, wrote\r\nas follows to his sister Mary, the mother of Washington, in a letter\r\ndated at Strafford-by-Bow, May the 19th, 1747: \"I understand that you\r\nare advised, and have some thoughts of putting your son George to sea.\r\nI think he had better be put apprentice to a tinker; for a common sailor\r\nbefore the mast has by no means the liberty of the subject; for they\r\nwill press him from a ship where he has fifty shillings a month, and\r\nmake him take twenty-three, and cut, and slash, and use him like a\r\nnegro, or rather like a dog. And as to any considerable preferment in\r\nthe navy, it is not to be expected, as there are always so many gaping\r\nfor it here who have interest, and he has none. And if he should get to\r\nbe master of a Virginia ship, (which it is very difficult to do,) a\r\nplanter that has three or four hundred acres of land, and three or four\r\nslaves, if he be industrious, may live more comfortably and have his\r\nfamily in better bread, than such a master of a ship can. He must not be\r\ntoo hasty to be rich, but go on gently and with patience as things will\r\nnaturally go. This method without aiming at being a fine gentleman\r\nbefore his time, will carry a man more comfortably and surely through\r\nthe world than going to sea, unless it be a great chance indeed. I pray\r\nGod keep you and yours.\r\n\r\n                     \"Your loving brother,\r\n                                            \"JOSEPH BALL.\"[458:A]\r\n\r\nAt length the mother's affectionate opposition prevented the execution\r\nof this scheme. George Washington now devoted himself to his studies,\r\nespecially the mathematics and surveying.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of his brother, Lawrence Washington, with Miss Fairfax,\r\nintroduced George to the favor of Thomas Lord Fairfax, proprietor of the\r\nNorthern Neck, who gave him an appointment as surveyor. He was now\r\nlittle more than sixteen years of age. After crossing the Blue Ridge,\r\nthe surveying party, including George Fairfax, entered a wilderness\r\nwhere they were exposed to the inclemency of the season, and subjected\r\nto hardship and fatigue. It was in the month of March, in the eventful\r\nyear 1748; snow yet lingered on the mountain-tops, and the streams were\r\nswollen into torrents. The survey-lands lay on the Shenandoah, near the\r\nsite of Winchester, and beyond the first range of the Alleghanies, on\r\nthe south branch of the Potomac, about seventy miles above Harper's\r\nFerry. This kind of life was well fitted to train young Washington for\r\nhis future career: a knowledge of topography taught him how to select a\r\nground for encampment or for battle; while hardy exercise and exposure\r\ninvigorated a frame naturally athletic, and fitted him to endure the\r\nprivations and encounter the dangers of military life. He now became\r\nacquainted with the temper and habits of the people of the frontier, and\r\nthe Indians; and grew familiar with the wild country which was to be the\r\nscene of his early military operations. His regular pay was a doubloon\r\n(seven dollars and twenty cents) a day, and occasionally six pistoles\r\n(twenty-one dollars and sixty cents.)\r\n\r\nAppointed by the president of William and Mary College, in July, 1749, a\r\npublic surveyor, he continued to engage in this pursuit for three years,\r\nexcept during the rigor of the winter months. Lord Fairfax had taken up\r\nhis residence at Greenway Court, thirteen miles southeast of the site of\r\nWinchester. A graduate of Oxford, accustomed to that society in England\r\nto which his rank entitled him, fond of literature, and having\r\ncontributed some numbers to the _Spectator_, this nobleman, owing to a\r\ndisappointment in love, had come to superintend his vast landed\r\npossessions, embracing twenty-one large counties, and live in the\r\nsecluded Valley of the Shenandoah. Here Washington, the youthful\r\nsurveyor, was a frequent inmate; and here he indulged his taste for\r\nhunting, and improved himself by reading and conversing with Lord\r\nFairfax.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[453:A] Sparks' Writings of Washington, ii. 478; Irving's Washington, i.\r\n59.\r\n\r\n[453:B] At Bath, in Virginia.\r\n\r\n[454:A] Sparks' Writings of Washington, ii. 481.\r\n\r\n[454:B] Foote's Sketches, 219.\r\n\r\n[456:A] Chalmers' Hist. of Revolt of Amer.

In the autumn of\r\nthat year he accompanied his brother Lawrence, then in declining health,\r\nto Barbadoes, in the West Indies, who returned to Virginia, and after\r\nlingering for awhile died at Mount Vernon, aged thirty-four.\r\n\r\nIn the same year also died the Rev. William Dawson, Commissary and\r\nPresident of William and Mary College. Davies expresses veneration for\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of Governor Dinwiddie, the colony was divided into\r\nfour military districts, and the northern one was allotted to Major\r\nWashington. France was now undertaking to stretch a chain of posts from\r\nCanada to Louisiana, in order to secure a control over the boundless and\r\nmagnificent regions west of the Alleghanies, which she claimed by a\r\nvague title of La Salle's discovery. The French deposited, (1749,) under\r\nground, at the mouth of the Kenhawa and other places, leaden plates, on\r\nwhich was inscribed the claim of Louis the Fifteenth to the whole\r\ncountry watered by the Ohio and its tributaries. England claimed the\r\nsame territory upon a ground equally slender--the cession made by the\r\nIroquois at the treaty of Lancaster. A more tenable ground was, that\r\nfrom the first discovery of Virginia, England had claimed the territory\r\nto the north and northwest from ocean to ocean, and that the region in\r\nquestion was the contiguous back country of her settlements. The title\r\nof the native tribes actually inhabiting the country commanded no\r\nconsideration from the contending powers. The French troops had now\r\ncommenced establishing posts in the territory on the Ohio claimed by\r\nVirginia. Dinwiddie having communicated information of these\r\nencroachments to his government, had been instructed to repel force by\r\nforce if necessary, after he had remonstrated with them; he had also\r\nreceived a supply of cannon and warlike stores. A treaty with the Ohio\r\ntribes was held September, 1753, at Winchester, when, in exchange for\r\npresents of arms and ammunition, they promised their aid, and consented\r\nthat a fortlet should be erected by the governor of Virginia on the\r\nMonongahela.\r\n\r\nDinwiddie, deeming it necessary to remonstrate against the French\r\nencroachments, found in Major Washington a trusty messenger, who\r\ncheerfully undertook the hazardous mission. Starting from Williamsburg\r\non the last day of October, he reached Fredericksburg on the next day,\r\nand there engaged as French interpreter Jacob Van Braam, who had served\r\nin the Carthagena expedition under Lawrence Washington. At Alexandria\r\nthey provided necessaries, and at Winchester baggage and horses, and\r\nreached Will's Creek, now Cumberland River, on the fourteenth of\r\nNovember. Thence, accompanied by Van Braam, Gist, and four other\r\nattendants, he traversed a savage wilderness, over rugged mountains\r\ncovered with snow, and across rapid swollen rivers. He reconnoitred the\r\nface of the country with a sagacious eye, and selected the confluence of\r\nthe Alleghany and Monongahela Rivers, where they form the beautiful\r\nOhio, as an eligible site for a fort. Fort Du Quesne was afterwards\r\nerected there by the French. After conferring, through an Indian\r\ninterpreter, with Tanacharisson, called the half-king, (as his authority\r\nwas somewhat subordinate to that of the Iroquois,) Washington provided\r\nhimself with Indian guides, and, accompanied by the half-king and some\r\nother chiefs, set out for the French post. Ascending the Alleghany River\r\nby way of Venango, he at length delivered Dinwiddie's letter to the\r\nFrench commander, Monsieur Le Gardeur de St. Pierre, a courteous Knight\r\nof the Order of St. Louis. Detained there some days, young Washington\r\nexamined the fort, and prepared a plan and description of it. It was\r\nsituated on a branch of French Creek, about fifteen miles south of Lake\r\nErie, and about seven hundred and fifty from Williamsburg. When he\r\ndeparted with a sealed reply, a canoe was hospitably stocked with\r\nliquors and provisions, but the French gave him no little anxiety by\r\ntheir intrigues to win the half-king over to their interests, and to\r\nretain him at the fort. Getting away at last with much difficulty, after\r\na perilous voyage of six days they reached Venango, where they met their\r\nhorses. They growing weak, and being given up for packs, Washington put\r\non an Indian dress and proceeded with the party for three days, when,\r\ncommitting the conduct of them to Van Braam, he determined to return in\r\nadvance. With an Indian match-coat tied around, taking his papers with\r\nhim, and a pack on his back and a gun in his hand, he proceeded on foot,\r\naccompanied by Gist. At a place of ill-omened name, Murderingtown, on\r\nthe southeast fork of Beaver Creek, they met with a band of French\r\nIndians lying in wait for them, and one of them, being employed as a\r\nguide, fired at either Gist or the major, at the distance of fifteen\r\nsteps, but missed. Gist would have killed the Indian at once, but he was\r\nprevented by the prudence of Washington. They, however, captured and\r\ndetained him till nine o'clock at night, when releasing him, they\r\npursued their course during the whole night. Upon reaching the Alleghany\r\nRiver they employed a whole day in making a raft with the aid only of a\r\nhatchet. Just as the sun was sinking behind the mountains they launched\r\nthe raft and undertook to cross: the river was covered with ice, driving\r\ndown the impetuous stream, by which, before they were half way over,\r\nthey were blocked up and near being sunk. Washington, putting out his\r\nsetting-pole to stop the raft, was thrown by the revulsion into the\r\nwater, but recovered himself by catching hold of one of the logs. He and\r\nhis companion, forced to abandon it, betook themselves to an island near\r\nat hand, where they passed the night, December the twenty-ninth, in wet\r\nclothes and without fire: Gist's hands and feet were frozen. In the\r\nmorning they were able to cross on the ice, and they passed two or three\r\ndays at a trading-post near the spot where the battle of the Monongahela\r\nwas afterwards fought. Here they heard of the recent massacre of a white\r\nfamily on the banks of the Great Kenhawa. Washington visited Queen\r\nAliquippa at the mouth of the Youghiogeny. At Gist's house, on the\r\nMonongahela, he purchased a horse, and, separating from this faithful\r\ncompanion, proceeded to Belvoir, where he rested one day, and arrived\r\nat Williamsburg on the 16th day of January, 1754, after an absence of\r\neleven weeks, and a journey of fifteen hundred miles, one-half of it\r\nbeing through an untrodden wilderness. A journal which he kept was\r\npublished in the colonial newspapers and in England. For this hazardous\r\nand painful journey he received no compensation save the bare amount of\r\nhis expenses.\r\n\r\nThe governor and council resolved to raise two companies, of one hundred\r\nmen each, the one to be enlisted by him at Alexandria, and the other by\r\nCaptain Trent on the frontier, the command of both being given to\r\nWashington. He received orders to march as soon as practicable to the\r\nfork of the Ohio, and complete a fort, supposed to have been already\r\ncommenced there by the Ohio Company. The assembly which met December,\r\n1753, refused Dinwiddie supplies for resisting the French encroachments,\r\n\"because they thought their privileges in danger,\" and they did not\r\napprehend much danger from the French. The governor called the assembly\r\ntogether again in January, 1754, when at length, after much persuasion,\r\nthey appropriated ten thousand pounds of the colonial currency for\r\nprotecting the frontier against the hostile attempts of the French. The\r\nbill, however, was clogged with provisoes against the encroachments of\r\nprerogative. Dinwiddie increased the military force to a regiment of\r\nthree hundred men, and the command was given to Colonel Joshua Fry, and\r\nMajor Washington was made lieutenant-colonel. Cannon and other military\r\nequipments were sent to Alexandria. The English minister, the Earl of\r\nHoldernesse, also ordered the governor of New York to furnish two\r\nindependent companies, and the governor of South Carolina one, to\r\nco-operate in this enterprise.\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1754, Washington, with two companies, proceeded to the\r\nGreat Meadows. At Will's Creek, on the twenty-fifth, he learned that an\r\nensign, in command of Trent's company, had surrendered, on the\r\nseventeenth, the unfinished fort at the fork of the Ohio, (now\r\nPittsburg,) to a large French force, which had come down under\r\nContrecoeur from Venango, with many pieces of cannon, batteaux, canoes,\r\nand a large body of men. This was regarded as the first open act of\r\nhostility between France and England in North America. In the war which\r\nensued Great Britain indeed triumphed gloriously, yet that triumph\r\nserved only to bring on in its train the revolt of the colonies and the\r\ndismemberment of the empire.\r\n\r\nWashington, upon hearing of the surrender of the fort, marched slowly\r\nfor the mouth of Red Stone Creek, preparing the roads for the passage of\r\ncannon which were to follow. Governor Dinwiddie, about the same time,\r\nrepaired to Winchester for the purpose of holding a treaty with the\r\nIndians, which, however, failed, only two or three chiefs of inferior\r\nnote attending.\r\n\r\nVirginia refused to send delegates to the Albany Convention; and the\r\nassembly and governor united in disapproving of Franklin's Plan of\r\nUnion, adopted on that occasion. Dinwiddie during the previous year had\r\nproposed to Lord Halifax a plan of colonial government, dividing the\r\ncolonies into two districts, northern and southern, in each of which\r\nthere should be a congress, or general council, for the regulation of\r\ntheir respective interests.\r\n\r\nThe money appropriated by the assembly for the support of the troops was\r\nexpended under the care of a committee of the assembly, associated with\r\nthe governor, and the niggardly economy of this committee gave great\r\ndisgust to Washington and the officers under him. He declared that he\r\nwould prefer serving as a volunteer to \"slaving dangerously for the\r\nshadow of pay through woods, rocks, mountains.\" Expecting a collision\r\nwith the enemy, he wrote to Governor Dinwiddie, \"We have prepared\r\na charming field for an encounter.\" Ascertaining that a French\r\nreconnoitering detachment was near his camp, and believing their\r\nintentions hostile, he determined to anticipate them. Guided by friendly\r\nIndians, in a dark and rainy night he approached the French encampment,\r\nand early on the twenty-eighth of May, with forty of his own men and a\r\nfew Indians, surrounded the French. A skirmish ensued; M. De Jumonville,\r\nthe officer in command, and ten of his party were killed, and twenty-two\r\nmade prisoners. Several of them appeared to have a mixture of Indian\r\nblood in them. The death of Jumonville created no little indignation in\r\nFrance, and became the subject of a French poem. It is said that\r\nWashington, in referring to this affair, remarked that \"he knew of no\r\nmusic so pleasing as the whistling of bullets.\" This being mentioned in\r\nthe presence of George the Second, he observed, \"He would not say so if\r\nhe had been used to hear many.\" The king had himself fought at the\r\nbattle of Dettingen. Inquiry being many years afterwards made of\r\nWashington as to the expression, he replied, \"If I said so, it was when\r\nI was young.\" Charles the Twelfth, of Sweden, expressed delight when he\r\nfirst heard the whistling of bullets. Of Washington's men one was killed\r\nand two or three were wounded. While the regiment was on its march to\r\njoin the detachment in advance, the command devolved, at the end of May,\r\non Lieutenant-Colonel Washington by the death of Colonel Fry. This\r\nofficer, a native of England, was educated at Oxford. Coming over to\r\nVirginia, he appears to have resided for a time in the County of Essex.\r\nHe was some time professor of mathematics in the College of William and\r\nMary, and afterwards a member of the house of burgesses, and engaged in\r\nrunning a boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina to the\r\nwestward. In concert with Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas, he made\r\na map of Virginia, and he was, as has been mentioned before, a\r\ncommissioner at the treaty of Logstown, in June, 1752. He died\r\nuniversally lamented.\r\n\r\nWashington, in a letter addressed to Governor Dinwiddie about this time,\r\nsaid: \"For my own part, I can answer that I have a constitution hardy\r\nenough to encounter and undergo the most severe trials, and I flatter\r\nmyself, resolution to face what any man dares, as shall be proved when\r\nit comes to the test, which I believe we are upon the borders of.\" The\r\nprovisions of the detachment being nearly exhausted, and the ground\r\noccupied disadvantageous, and the French at the fork of the Ohio, now\r\ncalled Fort Du Quesne, having been reinforced, and being about to march\r\nagainst the English, a council of war, held June the twenty-eighth, at\r\nGist's house, thirteen miles beyond the Great Meadows, advised a\r\nretreat, and Colonel Washington fell back to the post at the Great\r\nMeadows, now styled Fort Necessity, which he reached on the first of\r\nJuly. His force, amounting, with the addition of an independent company\r\nof South Carolinians, to about four hundred men, were at once set to\r\nwork to raise a breast-work and to strengthen the fortification as far\r\nas possible. Forty or fifty Indian families took shelter in the fort,\r\nand among them Tanacharisson, or the half-king, and Queen Aliquippa.\r\nThey proved to be of more trouble than advantage, being as spies and\r\nscouts of some service when rewarded, but in the fort useless. Before\r\nthe completion of the ditch, M. De Villiers, a brother of De Jumonville,\r\nappeared on the 3d of July, 1754, in front of the fort with nine hundred\r\nmen, and at eleven o'clock A.M., commenced an attack by firing at the\r\ndistance of six hundred yards, but without effect. The assailants\r\nfought, under cover of the trees and high grass, on rising ground near\r\nthe fort. They were received with intrepidity by the Americans. Some of\r\nthe Indians climbed up trees overlooking the fort, and fired on\r\nWashington's men, who returned the compliment in such style that the red\r\nmen slipped down the trees with the celerity of monkeys, which excited a\r\nloud laugh among the Virginians.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell heavily during the day; the trenches were filled with\r\nwater; and many of the arms of Washington's men were out of order. The\r\ndesultory engagement lasted till eight o'clock in the evening, when the\r\nFrench commander, having twice sounded a parley, and the stock of\r\nprovisions and ammunition in the fort being much reduced, it was\r\naccepted. About midnight, during a heavy rain, one half of the garrison\r\nbeing drunk, a capitulation took place, after the articles had been\r\nmodified in some points at Washington's instance. The French at first\r\ndemanded a surrender of the cannon; but this being resisted it was\r\nagreed that they should be destroyed, except one small piece reserved by\r\nthe garrison upon the point of honor; but which they were eventually\r\nunable to remove.\r\n\r\nThese guns, probably only spiked and abandoned, were subsequently\r\nrestored, and lay for a long time on the Great Meadows. After the\r\nRevolution it was an amusement of settlers moving westward, to discharge\r\nthem. They were at last removed to Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe troops were to retain their other arms and baggage; to march out\r\nwith drums beating and colors flying, and return home unmolested. The\r\nterms of the surrender, as published at the time from the duplicate copy\r\nretained by Colonel Washington, implied (\"by the too great condescension\r\nof Van Braam,\" the interpreter) an acknowledgment on his part that M. de\r\nJumonville had been \"assassinated.\" It appears that Washington was\r\nmisled by the inaccuracy of Van Braam in translating the word, he being\r\na Dutchman, and the only officer in the garrison who was acquainted with\r\nthe French language. It was so stormy at the time that he could not give\r\na written translation of the articles, and they could scarcely keep a\r\ncandle lighted to read them by, so that it became necessary to rely upon\r\nthe interpreter's word. The American officers present afterwards averred\r\nthat the word \"assassination\" was not mentioned, and that the terms\r\nemployed were, \"the death of Jumonville.\" The affair is involved in\r\nobscurity: for why should the French require Washington to acknowledge\r\nhimself the author of \"his death,\" unless the killing was unjustifiable?\r\nOn the other hand, with what consistency could Villiers allow such\r\nhonorable terms in the same articles in which it was demanded of\r\nWashington that he should sign a confession of his own disgrace?\r\n\r\nOf the Virginia regiment, three hundred and five in number, twelve were\r\nkilled, and forty-three wounded. The loss sustained by Captain Mackay's\r\nIndependent Company was not ascertained. Villiers' loss was three\r\nkilled, and seventeen dangerously wounded. The horses and cattle having\r\nbeen captured or killed by the enemy, it was found necessary to abandon\r\na large part of the baggage and stores, and to convey the remainder,\r\nwith the wounded, on the backs of the soldiers. Washington had agreed to\r\nrestore the prisoners taken at the skirmish with Jumonville; and to\r\ninsure this, two captains, Van Braam and Stobo, were given up as\r\nhostages.\r\n\r\nWashington, early on the 4th of July, 1754, perhaps the most humiliating\r\nof his life, marched out according to the terms; but in the confusion\r\nthe Virginia standard, which was very large, was left behind, and was\r\ncarried off in triumph by the enemy. But the regimental colors were\r\npreserved. In a short time the Virginians met a body of Indians who\r\nplundered the baggage, and were with difficulty restrained from\r\nattacking the men. Washington hastened back to Will's Creek, whence he\r\nproceeded to Williamsburg. The assembly voted him and his officers\r\nthanks, and gave him three hundred pistoles to be distributed among his\r\nmen; but dissatisfaction was expressed at some of the articles of\r\ncapitulation when they came to be made public.[468:A] Among the\r\nprisoners taken at the time when Jumonville was killed, was La Force,\r\nwho, on account of his influence among the Indians, was looked upon as a\r\ndangerous character, and was imprisoned at Williamsburg. He managed to\r\nescape from prison in the summer of 1756, but was recaptured near West\r\nPoint; and he was now kept in irons. This severe usage, and his being\r\ndetained by Dinwiddie a prisoner, in violation of the treaty of Fort\r\nNecessity, cannot be justified, and was unjust to Stobo and Van Braam,\r\nwho were, consequently, long retained as prisoners of war, and for some\r\ntime confined in prison at Quebec. It is true that the French suffered\r\nthe Indians to violate the article of the treaty securing the troops\r\nfrom molestation; but an excuse might be found in the difficulty of\r\nrestraining savages.\r\n\r\nMuch blame was laid on poor Van Braam at the time, and in the thanks\r\nvoted by the assembly his name was excepted, as having acted\r\ntreacherously in interpreting the treaty. Washington, who had shortly\r\nbefore the surrender pronounced him \"an experienced, good officer, and\r\nvery worthy of the command he has enjoyed,\" appears to have been at a\r\nloss whether to attribute his misinterpretation to \"evil intentions or\r\nnegligence,\" but was rather disposed to believe that it was owing to his\r\nbeing but little acquainted with the English language. Van Braam appears\r\nto have been rather hardly judged in this affair.[468:B] Stobo, a native\r\nof Scotland, who emigrated early to Virginia, was brave, energetic, and\r\na man of genius, but eccentric; his fidelity was never doubted. He was\r\nan acquaintance of David Hume, and a friend of Smollett, and was, it is\r\nsaid, the original of the character of Lismahago.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[468:A] Washington's Writings, ii. 456.\r\n\r\n[468:B] Ibid., ii. 365, 456; Va.

This\r\nlittle army was under command of Colonel Innes, of North Carolina, who,\r\nhaving brought three hundred and fifty men with him from that colony,\r\nhad been appointed, upon Colonel Fry's death, commander-in-chief. Innes\r\nhad been with Lawrence Washington at Carthagena. The force under Innes\r\ndid not exceed half the number of the enemy, and was unprovided for a\r\nwinter campaign. The assembly making no appropriation for the\r\nexpedition, it was fortunately abandoned.\r\n\r\nTwo independent companies, ordered from New York by Dinwiddie, arrived\r\nin Hampton Roads, in his majesty's ship Centaur, Captain Dudley Digges,\r\nin June, 1754. They were marched to Will's Creek, where they were joined\r\nby an independent company from South Carolina; and these troops, under\r\ncommand of Colonel Innes, during the autumn, built Fort Cumberland in\r\nthe fork between Will's Creek and the north branch of the Potomac, on\r\nthe Maryland side, about fifty-five miles northwest of Winchester. It\r\nwas called after the Duke of Cumberland, captain-general of the British\r\narmy. The fort was mounted with ten four-pounders, and some swivels; and\r\ncontained magazines and barracks. A prosperous town has arisen on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina troops at Winchester, not duly receiving their pay,\r\ndisbanded themselves in a disorderly way, and returned home. Dinwiddie\r\nwrote to the board of trade that \"the progress of the French would\r\nnever be effectually opposed, but by means of an act of parliament\r\ncompelling the colonies to contribute to the common cause independently\r\nof assemblies;\" and to the secretary of state: \"I know of no method to\r\ncompel them to their duty to the king, but by an act of parliament for a\r\ngeneral poll-tax of two shillings and six pence a head, from all the\r\ncolonies on this continent.\" This scheme had been suggested a long time\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIn 1738 the assembly of Virginia, which had long exercised the right of\r\nchoosing a treasurer, had placed their speaker, John Robinson, in that\r\noffice; and he continuing to hold both places for many years, exerted an\r\nundue influence over the assembly by lending the public money to the\r\nmembers. Dinwiddie ruled on ordinary occasions, but Robinson was\r\ndictator in all extraordinary emergencies.[470:A]\r\n\r\nWhen the assembly met in October, 1754, they granted twenty thousand\r\npounds for the public exigencies; Maryland and New York also contributed\r\ntheir quotas to the common cause; and Dinwiddie received ten thousand\r\npounds from England. He now enlarged the Virginia forces to ten\r\ncompanies, under the pretext of peremptory orders from England, and made\r\neach of them independent, with a view, as was alleged, of terminating\r\nthe disputes between the regular and provincial officers respecting\r\ncommand. The effect of this upon Washington would have been to reduce\r\nhim to the grade of captain, and to subject him to officers whom he had\r\ncommanded; officers of the same rank, but holding the king's commission,\r\nwould rank before him. This would have been the more mortifying to him,\r\nafter the catastrophe of the Great Meadows. He, therefore, although his\r\ninclinations were still strongly bent to arms, resigned, and passed the\r\nwinter at Mount Vernon. He was now twenty-two years of age.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Horatio Sharpe, professionally a military man, and Lord\r\nBaltimore's lieutenant-governor of Maryland, was appointed by the crown\r\ncommander-in-chief of the forces against the French. Colonel William\r\nFitzhugh, of Virginia, who was to command in the absence of Sharpe, had\r\nendeavored to persuade Washington to continue in the service, retaining\r\nfor the present his commission of colonel. Replying in November, 1754,\r\nhe said: \"If you think me capable of holding a commission that has\r\nneither rank nor emolument annexed to it, you must entertain a very\r\ncontemptible opinion of my weakness, and believe me to be more empty\r\nthan the commission itself.\" Washington was dissatisfied with\r\nDinwiddie's action in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe population of the American colonies at this period was estimated at\r\n1,485,000, of whom 292,000 were blacks, and the number of fighting men\r\n240,000; while the French population in Canada was not over 90,000.\r\nVirginia was reckoned the first of the colonies in power, Massachusetts\r\nthe second, Pennsylvania the third, and Maryland the fourth; and either\r\none of these had greater resources than Canada. Yet the power of the\r\nFrench was more concentrated; they were better fitted for the\r\nemergencies of the war, and they had more regular troops.[471:A] The\r\ncolonies were not united in purpose; and the Virginians were described\r\nby Dinwiddie as \"an indolent people, and without military ardor.\"\r\n\r\nSharpe's appointment was sent over by Arthur Dobbs, Governor of North\r\nCarolina, who arrived in Hampton Roads on the first of October. Sharpe,\r\nproceeding to Williamsburg, concerted with Dinwiddie and Dobbs a plan of\r\noperations against Fort Du Quesne. This plan was abandoned, owing to\r\nintelligence of the French being re-enforced by numerous Indian allies.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1755, General Edward Braddock, newly appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of all the military forces in America, arrived in\r\nVirginia with a small part of the troops of the intended expedition, the\r\nremainder arriving afterwards, being two British regiments, each\r\nconsisting of five hundred men, the forty-fourth commanded by Sir Peter\r\nHalket, the forty-eighth by Colonel Dunbar. Braddock went immediately to\r\nWilliamsburg to confer with Dinwiddie. Sir John St. Clair, who had come\r\nover to America some time before, was already there awaiting the\r\ngeneral's arrival.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Braddock's invitation, dated the second of March,\r\nWashington entered his military family as a volunteer, retaining his\r\nformer rank. This proceeding aroused his mother's tender solicitude, and\r\nshe hastened to Mount Vernon to give expression to it.\r\n\r\nFrom Williamsburg Braddock proceeded to Alexandria, then sometimes\r\ncalled Belhaven, the original name, where he made his headquarters, the\r\ntroops being quartered in that place and the neighborhood until they\r\nmarched for Will's Creek. On the thirteenth of April the governors of\r\nMassachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, met\r\nGeneral Braddock at Alexandria, to concert a plan of operations.\r\nWashington was courteously received by the governors, especially by\r\nShirley, with whose manners and character he was quite fascinated.\r\nOvertaking Braddock (who marched from Alexandria on the twentieth) at\r\nFrederictown, Maryland, he accompanied him to Winchester, and thence to\r\nFort Cumberland. Early in May Washington was made an aid-de-camp to the\r\ngeneral. Being dispatched to Williamsburg to convey money for the\r\narmy-chest, he returned to the camp with it on the thirtieth.\r\n\r\nThe army consisted of the two regiments of British regulars, together\r\noriginally one thousand men, and augmented by Virginia and Maryland\r\nlevies to fourteen hundred. The Virginia captains were Waggener, Cock,\r\nHogg, Stephen, Poulson, Peyrouny, Mercer, and Stuart. The provincials\r\nincluded the fragments of two independent companies from New York, one\r\nof which was commanded by Captain Horatio Gates, afterwards a\r\nmajor-general in the revolutionary war. Of the remaining provincials one\r\nhundred were pioneers and guides, called Hatchetmen: there were besides\r\na troop of Virginia light-horse, and a few Indians. Thirty sailors were\r\ndetached by Commodore Keppel, commander of the fleet that brought\r\nover the forces. The total effective force was about two thousand one\r\nhundred and fifty, and they were accompanied by the usual number of\r\nnon-combatants. The army was detained by the difficulty of procuring\r\nprovisions and conveyances. The apathy of the legislatures and the bad\r\nfaith of the contractors, so irritated Braddock that he indulged in\r\nsweeping denunciations against the colonies. These led to frequent\r\ndisputes between him and Washington, who found the exasperated general\r\ndeaf to his arguments on that subject. The plan suggested by him of\r\nemploying pack-horses for transportation, instead of wagons, was\r\nafterwards in some measure adopted.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, deputy postmaster-general of the colonies, who, at\r\nGovernor Shirley's instance, had accompanied him to the congress at\r\nAlexandria, visited Braddock at Frederictown, for the purpose of opening\r\na post-route between Will's Creek and Philadelphia. Learning the\r\ngeneral's embarrassment, he undertook to procure the requisite number of\r\nwagons and horses from the Pennsylvania farmers. Issuing a handbill\r\naddressed to their interests and their fears, and exciting among the\r\nGermans an apprehension of an arbitrary impressment to be enforced by\r\nSir John St. Clair, \"the Hussar,\" he was soon able to provide the\r\ngeneral with the means of transportation.[473:A] It was a long time\r\nbefore Franklin recovered compensation for the farmers; Governor Shirley\r\nat length paid the greater part of the amount, twenty thousand pounds;\r\nbut it is said that owing to the neglect of Lord Loudoun, Franklin was\r\nnever wholly repaid. Washington and Franklin were both held in high\r\nestimation by Braddock, and they were unconsciously co-operating with\r\nhim in a war destined in its unforeseen consequences to dismember the\r\nBritish empire.\r\n\r\nBraddock's army, with its baggage extending (along a road twelve feet\r\nwide) sometimes four miles in length, moved from Fort Cumberland, at the\r\nmouth of Will's Creek, early in June, and advanced slowly and with\r\ndifficulty, five miles being considered a good day's march. There was\r\nmuch sickness among the soldiers: Washington was seized with a fever,\r\nand obliged to travel in a covered wagon. Braddock, however, continued\r\nto consult him, and he advised the general to disencumber himself of his\r\nheavy guns and unnecessary baggage, to leave them with a rear division,\r\nand to press forward expeditiously to Fort Du Quesne. In a council of\r\nwar it was determined that Braddock should advance as rapidly as\r\npossible with twelve hundred select men, and Colonel Dunbar follow on\r\nslowly with a rear-guard of about six hundred,--a number of the soldiers\r\nbeing disabled by sickness. The advance corps proceeded only nineteen\r\nmiles in four days, losing occasionally a straggler, cut off by the\r\nFrench and Indian scouts. Trees were found near the road stripped of\r\ntheir barks and painted, and on them the French had written many of\r\ntheir names and the number of scalps recently taken, with many insolent\r\nthreats and scurrilous bravados.\r\n\r\nWashington was now (by the general's order) compelled to stop, his\r\nphysician declaring that his life would be jeoparded by a continuance\r\nwith the army, and Braddock promising that he should be brought up with\r\nit before it reached Fort Du Quesne. On the day before the battle of the\r\nMonongahela, Washington, in a wagon, rejoined the army, at the mouth of\r\nthe Youghiogany River, and fifteen miles from Fort Du Quesne. On the\r\nmorning of Wednesday, the 9th of July, 1755, the troops, in high\r\nspirits, confident of entering the gates of Fort Du Quesne triumphantly\r\nin a few hours, crossed the Monongahela, and advanced along the southern\r\nmargin. Washington, in after-life, was heard to declare it the most\r\nbeautiful spectacle that he had ever witnessed--the brilliant uniform of\r\nthe soldiers, arranged in columns and marching in exact order; the sun\r\ngleaming on their burnished arms; the Monongahela flowing tranquilly by\r\non the one hand, on the other, the primeval forest projecting its\r\nshadows in sombre magnificence. At one o'clock the army again crossed\r\nthe river at a second ford ten miles from Fort Du Quesne. From the river\r\na level plain extends northward nearly half a mile, thence the ground,\r\ngradually ascending, terminates in hills. The road from the\r\nfording-place to the fort led across this plain, up this ascent, and\r\nthrough an uneven country covered with woods.[474:A] Beyond the plain on\r\nboth sides of the road were ravines unnoticed by the English. Three\r\nhundred men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Gage, subsequently commander of\r\nthe British troops at Boston, made the advanced party, and it was\r\nimmediately followed by another of two hundred. Next came Braddock with\r\nthe artillery, the main body, and the baggage. Brigadier-General Sir\r\nPeter Halket was second in command. No sooner had the army crossed the\r\nriver, at the second ford, than a sharp firing was heard upon the\r\nadvanced parties, who were now ascending the hill about a hundred yards\r\nbeyond the edge of the plain.[475:A]\r\n\r\nAt an early hour De Beaujeu had been detached from Fort Du Quesne, at\r\nthe head of about two hundred and thirty French and Canadians, and six\r\nhundred and thirty Indian savages, with the design of attacking the\r\nEnglish at an advantageous ground selected on the preceding evening.\r\nBefore reaching it he came upon the English. The greater part of Gage's\r\ncommand was advanced beyond the spot where the main battle was fought,\r\nwhen Mr. Gordon, one of the engineers in front marking out the road,\r\nperceived the enemy bounding forward. Before them with long leaps came\r\nBeaujeu, the gay hunting-shirt and silver gorget denoting him as the\r\nchief. Halting he waved his hat above his head, and at this signal the\r\nIndians dispersed themselves to the right and left, throwing themselves\r\nflat on the ground, or gliding behind rocks and trees into the ravines.\r\nThe French occupied the centre of the Indian semicircle, and a fierce\r\nattack was commenced. Gage's troops, recovering from their first\r\nsurprise, opened a fire of grape and musketry. Beaujeu and twelve others\r\nfell dead upon the spot; the Indians, astonished by the report of the\r\ncannon, began to fly. Rallied by Dumas, who succeeded Beaujeu, they\r\nresumed the combat: the French in front, the Indians on the flank. For a\r\ntime the issue was doubtful: cries of \"Vive le Roi\" were answered by the\r\ncheers of the English. But while the officers of the Forty-fourth led on\r\ntheir men with waving swords, the enemy, concealed in the woods and\r\nravines, secure and invisible, kept up a steady, well-aimed, and fatal\r\nfire. Their position was only discovered by the smoke of their muskets.\r\nGage, not reinforcing his flanking parties, they were driven in, and the\r\nEnglish, instead of advancing upon the hidden enemy, returned a random\r\nand ineffectual fire in full column.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Braddock sent forward Lieutenant-Colonel Burton with\r\nthe vanguard. And while he was forming his men to face a rising ground\r\non the right, the advanced detachment, overwhelmed with consternation by\r\nthe savage war-whoop and the mysterious danger, fell back upon him in\r\ngreat confusion, communicating a panic from which they could not be\r\nrecovered. Braddock now came up and endeavored to form the two regiments\r\nunder their colors, but neither entreaties nor threats could prevail.\r\nThe baggage in the rear was attacked, and many horses killed; some of\r\nthe drivers fell, the rest escaped by flight. Two of the cannon flanking\r\nthe baggage for some time protected it from the Indians; the others\r\nfired away most of their ammunition, and were of some service in awing\r\nthe enemy, but could do but little execution against a concealed foe.\r\nThe enemy extended from front to rear, and fired upon every part at\r\nonce. The general finding it impossible to persuade his men to advance,\r\nmany officers falling, and no enemy appearing in sight, endeavored to\r\neffect a retreat in good order, but such was the panic that he could not\r\nsucceed. They were loading as fast as possible and firing in the air.\r\n\r\nBraddock and his officers made every effort to rally them, but in vain;\r\nin this confusion and dismay they remained in a road twelve feet wide,\r\nenclosed by woods, for three hours, huddled together, exposed to the\r\ninsidious fire, doing the enemy little hurt, and shooting one another.\r\nNone of the survivors could afterwards say that they saw one hundred of\r\nthe enemy, and many of the officers that were in the heat of the action\r\nwould not assert that they saw one.[477:A]\r\n\r\nThe Virginia troops preserved their presence of mind, and behaved with\r\nthe utmost bravery, adopting the Indian mode of combat, and fighting\r\neach man for himself behind a tree. This was done in spite of the orders\r\nof Braddock, who still endeavored to form his men into platoons and\r\ncolumns, as if they had been manoeuvring in the plains of Flanders or\r\nparading in Hyde Park. Washington and Sir Peter Halket in vain advised\r\nhim to allow the men to shelter themselves: he stormed at such as\r\nattempted to take to the trees, calling them cowards, and striking them\r\nwith his sword. Captain Waggoner, of the Virginia troops, resolved to\r\ntake advantage of the trunk of a tree five feet in diameter, lying\r\nathwart the brow of a hill. With shouldered firelocks he marched a party\r\nof eighty men toward it, and losing but three men on the way, the\r\nremainder throwing themselves behind it, opened a hot fire upon the\r\nenemy. But no sooner were the flash and report of their muskets\r\nperceived by the mob behind, than a general discharge was poured upon\r\nthem, by which fifty were killed and the rest compelled to fly.[477:B]\r\n\r\nThe French and Indians, concealed in deep ravines, and behind trees, and\r\nlogs, and high grass, and tangled undergrowth, kept up a deadly fire,\r\nsingling out their victims. The mounted officers were especially aimed\r\nat, and shortly after the commencement of the engagement, Washington was\r\nthe only aid not wounded. Although still feeble from the effects of his\r\nillness, on him now was devolved the whole duty of carrying the\r\ngeneral's orders, and he rode a conspicuous mark in every direction. Two\r\nhorses were killed under him, four bullets penetrated his coat, but he\r\nescaped unhurt, while every other officer on horseback was either killed\r\nor wounded. Dr. Craik afterwards said: \"I expected every moment to see\r\nhim fall. His duty and situation exposed him to every danger. Nothing\r\nbut the superintending care of Providence could have saved him from the\r\nfate of all around him.\" Washington, writing to his brother, said: \"By\r\nthe all-powerful dispensations of Providence I have been protected\r\nbeyond all human probability or expectation, for I had four bullets\r\nthrough my coat and two horses shot under me, yet escaped unhurt,\r\nalthough death was levelling my companions on every side.\"\r\n\r\nMore than half of the army were killed or wounded, two-thirds of them,\r\naccording to Washington's conjecture, by their own bullets; Sir Peter\r\nHalket was killed on the field; Shirley, Braddock's secretary, was shot\r\nthrough the head; Colonels Burton, Gage, and Orme, Major Sparks,\r\nBrigade-Major Halket, Captain Morris, etc., were wounded. Out of\r\neighty-six officers, twenty-six were killed and thirty-seven wounded.\r\nThe whole number of killed was estimated at four hundred and fifty-six,\r\nwounded four hundred and twenty one, the greater part of whom were\r\nbrought off; the aggregate loss, eight hundred and seventy-seven. The\r\nenemy's force, variously estimated, did not exceed eight hundred and\r\nfifty men, of whom six hundred, it was conjectured, were Indians. The\r\nFrench loss was twenty-eight killed, including three officers, one of\r\nwhom, Beaujeu, was chief in command; and twenty-nine badly wounded,\r\nincluding two officers. The French and Indians being covered by ravines,\r\nthe balls of the English passed harmless over their heads; while a\r\ncharge with the bayonet, or raking the ravines with cannon, would have\r\nat once driven them from their lurking places, and put them to flight,\r\nor, at the least, dispersed them in the woods. Any movement would have\r\nbeen better than standing still.\r\n\r\nDuring the action, or massacre, of three hours, Braddock had three\r\nhorses killed under him, and two disabled. At five o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, while beneath a large tree standing between the heads of two\r\nravines, and in the act of giving an order, he received a mortal wound.\r\nFalling from his horse, he lay helpless on the ground, surrounded by the\r\ndead. His army having fired away all their ammunition, now fled in\r\ndisorder back to the Monongahela. Pursued to the water's edge by a party\r\nof savages, the regulars threw away arms, accoutrements, and even\r\nclothing, that they might run the faster. Many were tomahawked at the\r\nfording-place; but those who crossed were not pursued, as the Indians\r\nreturned to the harvest of plunder. The provincials, better acquainted\r\nwith Indian warfare were less disconcerted, and retreated with more\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\nNot one of his British soldiers could be prevailed upon to stay and aid\r\nin bearing off the wounded general. In vain Orme offered them a purse of\r\nsixty guineas. Braddock begged his faithful friends to provide for their\r\nown safety, and declared his resolution to die on the field. Orme\r\ndisregarded these desperate injunctions; and Captain Stewart, of the\r\nVirginia Light-horse, (attached to the general's person,) and his\r\nservant, together with another American officer, hastening to Orme's\r\nrelief, brought off Braddock, at first on a small tumbrel, then on a\r\nhorse, lastly by the soldiers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Washington's account, in a letter written to Dinwiddie:\r\n\"They were struck with such an inconceivable panic, that nothing but\r\nconfusion and disobedience of orders prevailed among them. The officers\r\nin general behaved with incomparable bravery, for which they greatly\r\nsuffered, there being upwards of sixty killed and wounded, a large\r\nproportion out of what we had. The Virginia companies behaved like men\r\nand died like soldiers; for, I believe, out of three companies on the\r\nground that day, scarcely thirty men were left alive. Captain Peyrouny,\r\na Frenchman by birth, and all his officers down to a corporal, were\r\nkilled. Captain Poulson had almost as hard a fate, for only one of his\r\nescaped. In short, the dastardly behavior of the regular troops (so\r\ncalled) exposed those who were inclined to do their duty to almost\r\ncertain death; and, at length, in spite of every effort to the contrary,\r\nthey broke and ran like sheep before hounds, leaving the artillery,\r\nammunition, provisions, baggage, and, in short, everything a prey to the\r\nenemy; and when we endeavored to rally them in hopes of regaining the\r\nground and what we had left upon it, it was with as little success as if\r\nwe had attempted to have stopped the wild bears of the mountains, or the\r\nrivulets with our feet; for they would break by in spite of every effort\r\nto prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nBraddock was brave and accomplished in European tactics; but not an\r\nofficer of that comprehensive genius which knows how to bend and\r\naccommodate himself to circumstances. Burke says that a wise statesman\r\nknows how to be governed by circumstances: the maxim applies as well to\r\na military commander. Braddock, headstrong, passionate, irritated, not\r\nwithout just grounds, against the provinces, and pursuing the policy of\r\nthe British government to rely mainly on the forces sent over, and to\r\ntreat the colonial troops as inferior and only secondary, rejected the\r\nproposal of Washington to lead in advance the provincials, who,\r\naccustomed to border warfare, knew better how to cope with a savage\r\nfoe.[480:A] Braddock, however, showed that although he could not\r\nretrieve these errors, nor reclaim a degenerate soldiery, he could at\r\nany rate fall like a soldier.[480:B]\r\n\r\nAlthough no further pursued, the remainder of the army continued their\r\nflight during the night and the next day. Braddock continued for two\r\ndays to give orders; and it was in compliance with them that the greater\r\npart of the artillery, ammunition, and other stores were destroyed. It\r\nwas not until the thirteenth that the general uttered a word, except for\r\nmilitary directions. He then bestowed the warmest praise on his gallant\r\nofficers, and bequeathed, as is said, his charger, and his body-servant,\r\nBishop, to Washington.[480:C] The dying Braddock ejaculated in reference\r\nto the defeat, \"Who would have thought it?\" Turning to Orme he remarked,\r\n\"We shall better know how to deal with them another time;\" and in a few\r\nmoments expired, at eight o'clock, in the evening of Sunday, the 13th of\r\nJuly, 1755, at the Great Meadows. On the next morning he was buried in\r\nthe road, near Fort Necessity, Washington, in the absence of the\r\nchaplain, who was wounded, reading the funeral service. Washington\r\nretired to Mount Vernon, oppressed with the sad retrospect of the recent\r\ndisaster. But his reputation was greatly elevated by his signal\r\ngallantry on this occasion. Such dreary portals open the road of fame.\r\n\r\nThe green and bosky scene of battle was strewn with the wounded and the\r\ndead. Toward evening the forest resounded with the exulting cries and\r\nwar-whoop of the returning French and Indians, the firing of small arms,\r\nand the responsive roar of the cannon at the fort. A lonely American\r\nprisoner confined there listened during this anxious day to the various\r\nsounds, and with peering eye explored the scene. Presently he saw the\r\ngreater part of the savages, painted and blood-stained, bringing scalps,\r\nand rejoicing in the possession of grenadiers' caps, and the laced hats\r\nand splendid regimentals of the English officers. Next succeeded the\r\nFrench, escorting a long train of pack-horses laden with plunder. Last\r\nof all, just before sunset, appeared a party of Indians conducting\r\ntwelve British regulars, naked, their faces blackened, their hands tied\r\nbehind them. In a short while they were burned to death on the opposite\r\nbank of the Ohio, with every circumstance of studied barbarity and\r\ninhuman torture, the French garrison crowding the ramparts of the fort\r\nto witness the spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the defeated detachment retreated to the rear division in\r\nprecipitate disorder, leaving the road behind them strewed with signs of\r\nthe disaster. Shortly after, Colonel Dunbar marched with the remaining\r\nregulars to Philadelphia. Colonel Washington returned home, mortified\r\nand indignant at the conduct of the regular troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[470:A] Chalmers' Revolt, ii. 353.\r\n\r\n[471:A] Chalmers' Revolt, ii. 273.\r\n\r\n[473:A] Gordon's Hist. of Pa.; Braddock's Expedition, 163.\r\n\r\n[474:A] A plan of the ground is given in Washington's Writings, ii. 90.\r\n\r\n[475:A] The surprise of the Roman army under Titurius Sabinus on his\r\nmarch, by the Gauls (as described by Cæsar) resembles Braddock's defeat\r\nin several particulars.\r\n\r\n     \"At hostes, posteaquam ex nocturno fremitu vigiliis que de\r\n     profectione eorum senserunt, collocatis insidiis bipartito in\r\n     silvis opportuno atque occulto loco, a millibus passuum\r\n     circiter duobus, Romanorum adventum expectabant: et cum se\r\n     major pars agminis in magnam convallem demisisset, ex utraque\r\n     parte ejus vallis subito se ostenderunt, novissimosque premere\r\n     et primos prohibere ascensu atque iniquissimo nostris loco\r\n     proelium committere coeperunt.\" Lucius Cotta was the\r\n     Washington of that defeat: but he fell in the general\r\n     massacre. \"At Cotta qui cogitasset hæc posse in itinere\r\n     accidere, atque ob eam causam profectionis auctor non fuisset,\r\n     nulla in re communi saluti deerat, et in appellandis\r\n     cohortandisque militibus, imperatoris, et in pugna, militis\r\n     officia præstabat.\"\r\n\r\nThe following sentence describes the war-whoop: \"Tum vero suo more\r\nvictoriam conclamant, atque ululatum tollunt, impetuque in nostros\r\nfacto, ordines perturbant.\"\r\n\r\n[477:A] Bancroft, iv. 189.\r\n\r\n[477:B] Braddock's Expedition, 231.\r\n\r\n[480:A] Chalmers' Hist. of Revolt, ii. 276.

William Stith, president of the\r\nCollege of William and Mary, and author of an excellent \"History of\r\nVirginia,\" from the first settlement to the dissolution of the London\r\nCompany. He was of exemplary character and catholic spirit, a friend of\r\nwell-regulated liberty, and a true patriot.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Samuel Davies, during the year 1754, went on a mission to\r\nEngland and Scotland for the purpose of raising a fund for the endowment\r\nof a college at Princeton, New Jersey. His eloquence commanded\r\nadmiration in the mother country. The English Presbyterians he found\r\nsadly fallen away from the doctrines of the Reformation, and their\r\nclergy, although learned and able, deeply infected with the \"modish\r\ndivinity\"--Socinianism and Arminianism. In Scotland, where he met a warm\r\nwelcome, he found the young clergy no less imbued with the \"modish\r\ndivinity,\" and the cause of religion and the spiritual independence of\r\nthe kirk lamentably impaired by the overweening influence of secular\r\npatronage. Davies was of opinion that in genuine piety the Methodists,\r\nwho commenced their reform in the Church of England, ranked the highest.\r\nHe returned to Virginia early in 1755, and during the French and Indian\r\nwars he often employed his eloquence in arousing the patriotism of the\r\nVirginians.\r\n\r\nAfter Braddock's defeat, such was the general consternation that many\r\nseemed ready to desert the country. On the 20th of July, 1755, Davies\r\ndelivered a discourse, in which he declared: \"Christians should be\r\npatriots. What is that religion good for that leaves men cowards upon\r\nthe appearance of danger? And permit me to say, that I am particularly\r\nsolicitous that you, my brethren of the dissenters, should act with\r\nhonor and spirit in this juncture, as it becomes loyal subjects, lovers\r\nof your country, and courageous Christians. That is a mean, sordid,\r\ncowardly soul that would abandon his country and shift for his own\r\nlittle self, when there is any probability of defending it. To give the\r\ngreater weight to what I say, I may take the liberty to tell you, I have\r\nas little personal interest, as little to lose in the colony, as most of\r\nyou. If I consulted either my safety or my temporal interest, I should\r\nsoon remove with my family to Great Britain, or the Northern colonies,\r\nwhere I have had very inviting offers. Nature has not formed me for a\r\nmilitary life, nor furnished me with any great degree of fortitude and\r\ncourage; yet I must declare, that after the most calm and impartial\r\ndeliberation, I am determined not to leave my country while there is any\r\nprospect of defending it.\"[483:A]\r\n\r\nDejection and alarm vanished under his eloquence, and at the conclusion\r\nof his address every man seemed to say, \"Let us march against the\r\nenemy!\" A patriotic discourse was delivered by him on the 17th of\r\nAugust, 1755, before Captain Overton's company of Independent\r\nVolunteers, the first volunteer company raised in Virginia after\r\nBraddock's defeat. In a note appended to this discourse, Davies said:\r\n\"As a remarkable instance of this, I may point out to the public that\r\nheroic youth, Colonel Washington, whom I cannot but hope Providence has\r\nhitherto preserved in so signal a manner for some important service to\r\nhis country.\"[483:B]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Patrick Henry caught the spark of eloquence from\r\nDavies, as in his early youth, and in after years, he often heard him\r\npreach. They were alike gifted with a profound sensibility. Henry always\r\nremarked that Mr. Davies was \"the greatest orator he had ever heard.\"\r\nPresbyterianism steadily advanced in Virginia under the auspices of\r\nDavies and his successors, particularly Graham, Smith, Waddell, \"the\r\nblind preacher\" of Wirt's \"British Spy,\" and Brown.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Waddell, a Presbyterian minister, was born in the North\r\nof Ireland, in July, 1739, as is believed. He was brought over in his\r\ninfancy by his parents to America; they settled in the southeastern part\r\nof Pennsylvania, on White-clay Creek. James was sent to school at\r\nNottingham to Dr. Finley, afterwards president of the College of New\r\nJersey. In the school young Waddell made such proficiency in his studies\r\nas to become an assistant teacher; and Dr. Benjamin Rush, the signer of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, recited lessons to him there. He\r\ndevoted his attention chiefly to the classics, in which he became very\r\nwell versed. He was afterwards an assistant to the elder Smith, father\r\nof the Rev. John Blair Smith, president of Hampden Sidney College,\r\nVirginia, and of the Rev. Samuel Stanhope Smith, president of the\r\nCollege of New Jersey. Waddell, intending to pursue the vocation of a\r\nteacher, and to settle with that view at Charleston, in South Carolina,\r\nset out for the South. In passing through Virginia he met with the\r\ncelebrated preacher, Davies, and that incident gave a different turn to\r\nhis life. Shortly after, he became an assistant to the Rev. Mr. Todd in\r\nhis school in the County of Louisa, with whom he studied theology. He\r\nwas licensed to preach in 1761, and ordained in the following year, when\r\nhe settled as pastor in Lancaster County. Here, about the year 1768, he\r\nmarried Mary, daughter of Colonel James Gordon, of that county,[484:A] a\r\nwealthy and influential man. In the division of the Presbyterian Church\r\nMr. Waddell was of the \"New Side,\" as it was termed. The Rev. Samuel\r\nDavies often preached to Mr. Waddell's congregation; as also did\r\nWhitefield several times.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1776 Mr. Waddell removed from Lower Virginia, in very feeble\r\nhealth, to Augusta County. His salary was now only forty-five pounds,\r\nVirginia currency, per annum. In 1783 he came to reside at an estate\r\npurchased by him, and called Hopewell, at the junction of Louisa,\r\nOrange, and Albemarle--the dwelling-house being in Louisa. Here he again\r\nbecame a classical teacher, receiving pupils in his own house. James\r\nBarbour, afterwards governor of Virginia, was one of these, and\r\nMerriwether Lewis, the companion of Clarke in the exploration beyond the\r\nRocky Mountains, another. Mr. Waddell resided in Louisa County about\r\ntwenty years, and died there, and was buried, according to his request,\r\nin his garden. During his residence here he was, for a part of the time,\r\ndeprived of his sight; but he continued to preach. In person he was tall\r\nand erect; his complexion fair, with a light blue eye. His deportment\r\nwas dignified; his manners elegant and graceful. He is represented by\r\nMr. Wirt, in the \"British Spy,\" as preaching in a white linen cap; this\r\nwas, indeed, a part of his domestic costume, but when he went abroad he\r\nalways wore a large full-bottomed wig, perfectly white. Mr. Wirt held\r\nhim as equal to Patrick Henry, in a different species of oratory. In\r\nregard to place, time, costume, and lesser particulars, Mr. Wirt used an\r\nallowable liberty in grouping together incidents which had occurred\r\napart, and perhaps imagining, as in a sermon, expressions which had been\r\nuttered at the fire-side. Patrick Henry's opinion of Mr. Waddell's\r\neloquence has been before mentioned. It was the remark of another\r\ncotemporary, that when he preached, \"whole congregations were bathed in\r\ntears.\" It might also be said by his grave, as at that of John Knox,--\r\n\r\n     \"Here lies one who never feared the face of man.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. Dr. Archibald Alexander married a daughter of Dr. Waddell,\r\nand the late Rev. Dr. James Waddell Alexander thus derived his middle\r\nname.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1755, the assembly voted forty thousand pounds for the public\r\nservice, and the governor and council immediately resolved to augment\r\nthe Virginia Regiment to sixteen companies, numbering fifteen hundred\r\nmen. To Washington was granted the sum of three hundred pounds in reward\r\nfor his gallant behavior and in compensation for his losses at the\r\nbattle of Monongahela. Colonel Washington was, during this month,\r\ncommissioned commander-in-chief of the forces, and allowed to appoint\r\nhis own officers. The officers next in rank to him were\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Adam Stephen and Major Andrew Lewis. Washington's\r\nmilitary reputation was now high, not only in Virginia, but in the other\r\ncolonies. Peyton Randolph raised a volunteer company of one hundred\r\ngentlemen, who, however, proved quite unfit for the frontier service.\r\n\r\nAfter organizing the regiment and providing the commissariat, Washington\r\nrepaired early in October to Winchester, and took such measures as lay\r\nin his power to repel the cruel outrages of a savage irruption. Alarm,\r\nconfusion, and disorder prevailed, so that he found no orders obeyed but\r\nsuch as a party of soldiers, or his own drawn sword, enforced. He beheld\r\nwith emotion calamities which he could not avert, and he strenuously\r\nurged the necessity of an act to enforce the military law, to remedy the\r\ninsolence of the soldiers and the indolence of the officers. He even\r\nintimated a purpose of resigning, unless his authority should be\r\nre-enforced by the laws, since he found himself thwarted in his\r\nexertions at every step by a general perverseness and insubordination,\r\naggravated by the hardships of the service and the want of system. At\r\nlength, by persevering solicitations, he prevailed on the assembly to\r\nadopt more energetic military regulations. The discipline thus\r\nintroduced was extremely rigorous, severe flogging being in\r\nordinary use. The penalty for fighting was five hundred lashes;\r\nfor drunkenness, one hundred. The troops were daily drilled and\r\npractised in bush-fighting. A Captain Dagworthy, stationed at Fort\r\nCumberland, commissioned by General Sharpe, governor of Maryland,\r\nrefusing, as holding a king's commission, to obey Washington's orders,\r\nthe dispute was referred by Governor Dinwiddie to General Shirley,\r\ncommander-in-chief of his majesty's armies in America, who was then at\r\nBoston. He was also requested to grant royal commissions to Colonel\r\nWashington and his field-officers, such commissions to imply rank but to\r\ngive no claim to pay.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, after committing murders and barbarities upon the unhappy\r\npeople of the border country, retired beyond the mountains. Colonel Byrd\r\nand Colonel Randolph were sent out with presents to the Cherokees,\r\nCatawbas, and other Southern Indians, in order to conciliate their\r\ngood-will and counteract the intrigues of the French.\r\n\r\nColonel Washington obtained leave to visit General Shirley, so as to\r\ndeliver in person a memorial from the officers of the Virginia Regiment,\r\nrequesting him to grant them king's commissions; and also in order to\r\nmake himself better acquainted with the military plans of the North. He\r\nset out from Alexandria early in February, 1756, accompanied by his\r\naid-de-camp, Colonel George Mercer, and on his route passed through\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, New London, Newport, and Providence. He visited\r\nthe governors of Pennsylvania and New York, and spent several days in\r\neach of the principal cities. He was well received by General Shirley,\r\nwith whom he continued ten days, mingling with the society of Boston,\r\nattending the sessions of the legislature, and visiting Castle William.\r\nDuring the tour he was everywhere looked upon with interest as the hero\r\nof the Monongahela. Shirley decided the contested point between\r\nDagworthy and him in his favor.\r\n\r\nWhile in New York he was a guest of his friend Beverley Robinson\r\n(brother of the speaker.) Miss Mary Philipse, a sister of Mrs. Robinson,\r\nand heiress of a vast estate, was an inmate of the family, and\r\nWashington became enamored of her. The flame was transient; he probably\r\nhaving soon discovered that another suitor was preferred to him. She\r\neventually married Captain Roger Morris, his former associate in arms,\r\nand one of Braddock's aids. She and her sister, Mrs. Robinson, and Mrs.\r\nInglis, were the only females who were attainted of high treason during\r\nthe Revolution. Imagination dwells on the outlawry of a lady who had won\r\nthe admiration of Washington. Humanity is shocked that a woman should\r\nhave been attainted of treason for clinging to the fortunes of her\r\nhusband.[487:A] Mary Philipse is the original of one of the characters\r\nin Cooper's \"Spy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[483:A] Davies' Sermons, iii. 169; Sermon on the defeat of General\r\nBraddock going to Fort Du Quesne; Memoir of Davies in Evan. and Lit.\r\nMag.\r\n\r\n[483:B] Davies' Sermons, iii. 38. \"Who is Mr. Washington?\" inquired Lord\r\nHalifax. \"I know nothing of him,\" he added; \"but they say he behaved in\r\nBraddock's action as bravely as if he really loved the whistling of\r\nbullets.\"\r\n\r\n[484:A] Ancestor of the late General Gordon, of Albemarle.\r\n\r\n[487:A] Sabine's Loyalists, 476.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\n1756-1758.\r\n\r\n     First Settlers of the Valley--Sandy Creek Expedition--Indian\r\n     Irruption--Measures of Defence--Habits of Virginians--\r\n     Washington and Dinwiddie--Congress of Governors--Dinwiddie\r\n     succeeded by Blair--Davies' Patriotic Discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE inhabitants of tramontane Virginia are very imperfectly acquainted\r\nwith its history.

Of this\r\nmany of the inhabitants know little more than what they see. They see a\r\ncountry possessing salubrity and fertility, yielding plentifully, in\r\ngreat variety, most of the necessaries of life, a country which has\r\nadvantages, conveniences, and blessings, in abundance, in profusion, it\r\nmay almost be said in superfluity. But they know not how it came into\r\nthe hands of the present occupants; they know not who were the first\r\nsettlers, whence they came, at what time, in what numbers, nor what\r\ndifficulties they had to encounter, nor what was the progress of\r\npopulation. One who would become acquainted with these matters must\r\ntravel back a century or more; he must witness the early adventurers\r\nleaving the abodes of civilization, and singly, or in families, or in\r\ngroups composed of several families, like pioneers on a forlorn hope,\r\nentering the dark, dreary, trackless forest, which had been for ages the\r\nnursery of wild beasts and the pathway of the Indian. After traversing\r\nthis inhospitable solitude for days or weeks, and having become weary of\r\ntheir pilgrimage, they determined to separate, and each family taking\r\nits own course in quest of a place where they may rest, they find a spot\r\nsuch as choice, chance, or necessity points out; here they sit down;\r\nthis they call their home--a cheerless, houseless home. If they have a\r\ntent, they stretch it, and in it they all nestle; otherwise the umbrage\r\nof a wide-spreading oak, or mayhap the canopy of heaven, is their only\r\ncovering. In this newfound home, while they are not exempt from the\r\ncommon frailties and ills of humanity, many peculiar to their present\r\ncondition thicken around them. Here they must endure excessive labor,\r\nfatigue, and exposure to inclement seasons; here innumerable perils and\r\nprivations await them; here they are exposed to alarms from wild beasts\r\nand from Indians. Sometimes driven from home, they take shelter in the\r\nbreaks and recesses of the mountains, where they continue for a time in\r\na state of anxious suspense; venturing at length to reconnoitre their\r\nhome, they perhaps find it a heap of ruins, the whole of their little\r\n_peculium_ destroyed. This frequently happened. The inhabitants of the\r\ncountry being few, and in most cases widely separated from each other,\r\neach group, fully occupied with its own difficulties and distresses,\r\nseldom could have the consolation of hoping for the advice, assistance,\r\nor even sympathy of each other. Many of them, worn out by the hardships\r\ninseparable from their new condition, found premature graves; many\r\nhundreds, probably thousands, were massacred by the hands of the\r\nIndians; and peace and tranquillity, if they came at all, came at a late\r\nday to the few survivors.\r\n\r\n     \"Tantæ erat molis--condere gentem.\"\r\n\r\nHere have been stated a few items of the first cost of this country, but\r\nthe half has not been told, nor can we calculate in money the worth of\r\nthe sufferings of these people, especially we cannot estimate in dollars\r\nand cents the value of the lives that were lost.[489:A]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1756 took place the \"Sandy Creek Expedition\" against the\r\nShawnees on the Ohio River. With the exception of a few Cherokees, it\r\nconsisted exclusively of Virginia troops, under the conduct of Major\r\nAndrew Lewis.[489:B] Although this expedition proved in the event\r\nabortive, yet its incidents, as far as known, are interesting. Nor are\r\nsuch abortive enterprises without their useful effects: they are the\r\nschools of discipline, the rehearsals of future success. The rendezvous\r\nfrom which the expedition started was Fort Frederick, on New River, in\r\nwhat was then Augusta County. Under Major Andrew Lewis were Captains\r\nWilliam Preston, Peter Hogg, John Smith, Archibald Alexander, father of\r\nRev. Dr. Archibald Alexander, Breckenridge, Woodson, and Overton. Their\r\ncompanies appear to have been already guarding the frontier when called\r\nupon for this new service. There were also the volunteer companies of\r\nCaptains Montgomery and Dunlap, and a party of Cherokees under Captain\r\nParis. A party of this tribe had come to the assistance of the\r\nVirginians in the latter part of 1755, and they were ordered by Governor\r\nDinwiddie to join the Sandy Creek Expedition; but whether they all\r\nactually joined it is not known. The war leaders of these savages were\r\nold Outacité, the Round O, and the Yellow Bird. Captain David\r\nStewart,[490:A] of Augusta, seems to have acted as commissary to the\r\nexpedition. The whole force that marched from Fort Frederick amounted to\r\nthree hundred and forty. While waiting to procure horses and\r\npack-saddles, the soldiers were preached to by the pioneer Presbyterian\r\nclergymen of the valley, Craig and Brown. Major Lewis marched on the\r\neighteenth of February, and passing by the Holston River and the head of\r\nthe Clinch, they reached the head of Sandy Creek on the twenty-eighth.\r\nThis stream was found exceedingly tortuous; on the twenty-ninth, they\r\ncrossed it sixty-six times in the distance of fifteen miles. Although\r\nsome bears, deer, and buffaloes were killed, yet their provisions began\r\nto run low early in March, when they were reduced to half a pound of\r\nflour per man, and no meat except what they could kill, which was very\r\nlittle. There being no provender for the horses, they strayed away. The\r\nmarch was fatiguing, the men having frequently to wade laboriously\r\nacross the deepening water of the river; they suffered with hunger, and\r\nstarvation began to stare them in the face. The Cherokees undertook to\r\nmake bark canoes to convey themselves down the creek, and Lewis ordered\r\na large canoe to be made to transport the ammunition and the remaining\r\nflour. The men murmured, and many threatened to return home. Lewis\r\nordered a cask of butter to be divided among them. An advance party of\r\none hundred and thirty, with nearly all of the horses, proceeded down\r\nthe creek, Lewis with the rest remaining to complete the canoes. No game\r\nwas met with by the party proceeding down the stream, and the mountains\r\nwere found difficult to cross. Hunger and want increased, and the men\r\nbecame almost mutinous. Captain Preston proposed to kill the horses for\r\nfood, but this offer was rejected. About this time some elks and\r\nbuffaloes were killed, and this relief rescued some of the men from the\r\njaws of starvation. The advance party had now, as they supposed, reached\r\nthe distance of fifteen miles below the forks of the Sandy. Captain\r\nPreston, who commanded it, was greatly perplexed at the discontents\r\nwhich prevailed, and which threatened the ruin of the expedition. The\r\nmen laid no little blame on the commissaries, who had furnished only\r\nfifteen days' provision for what they supposed to be a march of three\r\nhundred miles. Major Lewis preserved his equanimity, and remarked that\r\n\"he had often seen the like mutiny among soldiers.\" On the eleventh of\r\nMarch ten men deserted; others preparing to follow them, were disarmed\r\nand forcibly detained, but some of them soon escaped. They were pursued\r\nand brought back. When Major Lewis rejoined the advance party, one of\r\nhis men brought in a little bear, which he took to Captain Preston's\r\ntent, where the major lodged that night, \"by which,\" says Preston, \"I\r\nhad a good supper and breakfast--a rarity.\" Major Lewis addressed the\r\nmen, encouraging them to believe that they would soon reach the\r\nhunting-ground and find game, and reminded them that the horses would\r\nsupport them for some time. The men, nevertheless, appeared obstinately\r\nbent upon returning home, for they said that if they went forward they\r\nmust either perish or eat horses--neither of which they were willing to\r\ndo. The major then, stepping off a few yards, called upon all those who\r\nwould serve their country and share his fate, to go with him. All the\r\nofficers and some twenty or thirty privates joined him; the rest marched\r\noff. In this conjuncture, when deserted by his own people, Lewis found\r\nold Outacité, the Cherokee chief, willing to stand by him. Outacité\r\nremarked, that \"the white men could not bear hunger like Indians.\" The\r\nexpedition was now, of necessity, abandoned when they had arrived near\r\nthe Ohio River, and all made the best of their way home.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have required two weeks for them to reach the nearest\r\nsettlements, and during this interval they endured great sufferings from\r\ncold and hunger, and some who separated from the main body, and\r\nundertook to support themselves on the way back by hunting, perished.\r\nWhen the main body reached the Burning Spring, in what is now Logan\r\nCounty, they cut some buffalo hides, which they had left there on the\r\nway down, into tuggs or long thongs, and ate them, after exposing them\r\nto the flame of the Burning Spring. Hence Tugg River, separating\r\nVirginia from Kentucky, derives its name. During the last two or three\r\ndays, it is said that they ate the strings of their moccasins, belts of\r\ntheir hunting-shirts, and shot-pouch flaps. The art of extracting\r\nnutriment from such articles is now lost.\r\n\r\n\"The Sandy Creek Voyage,\" as it was sometimes styled, appears to have\r\nbeen directed against the Shawnee town near the junction of the Kanawha\r\nand the Ohio, and perhaps to erect a fort there. The conduct of the\r\nexpedition was left almost entirely to the discretion of Major\r\nLewis.[492:A] Washington predicted the failure of the expedition, on\r\naccount of the length of the march, and even if it reached the Ohio, \"as\r\nwe are told that those Indians are removed up the river into the\r\nneighborhood of Fort Du Quesne.\"[492:B]\r\n\r\nOld Outacité, or the Man-killer, was in distinction among the Cherokee\r\nchiefs, second only to Attacullaculla, or the Little Carpenter. Outacité\r\nattained a venerable age, and continued to be a steadfast friend of the\r\nwhites. At the massacre committed near Fort Loudoun, by his\r\ninterposition he rescued many from destruction.\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1756, another Indian irruption, led on by the French,\r\nspread consternation in the tramontane country, and threatened to\r\nexterminate the inhabitants. Washington, now aged twenty-four, gave it\r\nas his opinion that \"five hundred Indians have it more in their power to\r\nannoy the inhabitants than ten times their number of regulars.\" While\r\nthe unhappy people were flying from the barbarous foe, Washington, in\r\nview of the inadequate means of protection, wrote to Governor Dinwiddie:\r\n\"The supplicating tears of the women and moving petitions of the men\r\nmelt me into such deadly sorrow, that I solemnly declare, if I know my\r\nown mind, I could offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering\r\nenemy, provided that would contribute to the people's ease.\" In this\r\nsentence we find the key to his whole character and history.\r\n\r\nThe governor immediately gave orders for a re-enforcement of militia to\r\nassist him. The \"Virginia Gazette,\" however, cast discredit and blame on\r\nWashington and the force under his command. Virginia continued to be too\r\nparsimonious and too indifferent to the sufferings of her people beyond\r\nthe mountains. The woods appeared to be alive with French and Indians;\r\neach day brought fresh disasters and alarms. Washington found no\r\nlanguage expressive enough to portray the miseries of the country.\r\nAffording all the succor in his power, he called upon the governor for\r\narms, ammunition, and provisions, and gave it as his opinion that a\r\nre-enforcement of Indian allies was indispensable, as Indians alone\r\ncould be effectually opposed to Indians. Winchester, incorporated in\r\n1752, was now almost the only settlement west of the Blue Ridge that was\r\nnot almost entirely deserted, the few families that remained being\r\nsheltered in forts. West of the North Mountain the country was\r\ndepopulated, save a few families on the South Branch of the Potomac and\r\non the Cacapehon. About the close of April the French and Indians\r\nreturned to Fort Du Quesne laden with plunder, prisoners, and scalps.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie recommended to the board of trade an extensive cordon\r\nof forts, to cover the entire frontier of the colonies from Crown Point\r\nto the country of the Creek Indians. His project was to pay for these\r\nforts and support their garrisons by a land and poll tax, levied on all\r\nthe colonies by an act of parliament. Washington advised that Virginia\r\nshould guard her frontier by additional forts about fifteen miles apart.\r\nFort Loudoun was erected at Winchester, the key of that region, under\r\nhis superintendence. It was a square with four bastions; the batteries\r\nmounted twenty-four guns; a well was sunk, mostly through a bed of\r\nlimestone; the barracks were sufficient for four hundred and fifty men.\r\nVestiges of this fortification still remain. Winchester, after the\r\nerection of Fort Loudoun, increased rapidly, owing to its being the\r\nrendezvous of the Virginia troops: in 1759 it contained two hundred\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that as late as the year 1756, when the colony was a\r\ncentury and a half old, the Blue Ridge of mountains was virtually the\r\nwestern boundary of Virginia, and great difficulty was found in\r\ncompleting a single regiment for the protection of the inhabitants of\r\nthe border country from the cruel irruptions of the Indians. Yet at this\r\ntime the population of the colony was estimated at two hundred and\r\nninety-three thousand, of whom one hundred and seventy-three thousand\r\nwere white, and one hundred and twenty thousand black, and the militia\r\nwere computed at thirty-five thousand fit to bear arms.\r\n\r\nDinwiddie wrote to Fox, (father of Charles James,) one of the\r\nsecretaries of state: \"We dare not venture to part with any of our white\r\nmen any distance, as we must have a watchful eye over our negro slaves,\r\nwho are upwards of one hundred thousand.\" Some estimated them at one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand, equal in number to the whites, but the\r\nsmaller estimate is probably more correct. The increase of the blacks\r\nwas rapid, and many lamented that the mother country should suffer such\r\nmultitudes to be brought from Africa to gratify the African Company,\r\n\"and overrun a dutiful colony.\" As to the question whether enslaving the\r\nnegroes is consistent with Christianity, the Rev. Peter Fontaine\r\nremarks: \"Like Adam, we are all apt to shift off the blame from\r\nourselves and lay it upon others; how justly, in our case, you may\r\njudge. The negroes are enslaved by the negroes themselves before they\r\nare purchased by the masters of the ships who bring them here. It is, to\r\nbe sure, at our choice whether we buy them or not; so this, then, is our\r\ncrime, folly, or whatever you will please to call it. But our assembly,\r\nforeseeing the ill consequences of importing such numbers among us, hath\r\noften attempted to lay a duty upon them which would amount to a\r\nprohibition, such as ten or twenty pounds a head; but no governor dare\r\npass such a law, having instructions to the contrary from the board of\r\ntrade at home. By this means they are forced upon us whether we will or\r\nwill not. This plainly shows the African Company hath the advantage of\r\nthe colonies, and may do as it pleases with the ministry.\" \"To live in\r\nVirginia without slaves is morally impossible,\" and it was a hard task\r\nfor the planter to perform his duty toward them; for, on the one hand,\r\nif they were not compelled to work hard, he would endanger his temporal\r\nruin; on the other hand, was the danger of not being able, in a better\r\nworld, to render a good account of his humane stewardship of\r\nthem.[495:A]\r\n\r\nA long interval of tranquillity had enervated the planters of Virginia:\r\nluxury had introduced effeminate manners and dissolute habits. \"To eat\r\nand drink delicately and freely; to feast, and dance, and riot; to\r\npamper cocks and horses; to observe the anxious, important, interesting\r\nevent, which of two horses can run fastest, or which of two cocks can\r\nflutter and spur most dexterously; these are the grand affairs that\r\nalmost engross the attention of some of our great men. And little\r\nlow-lived sinners imitate them to the utmost of their power. The\r\nlow-born sinner can leave a needy family to starve at home, and add one\r\nto the rabble at a horse-race or a cock-fight. He can get drunk and turn\r\nhimself into a beast with the lowest as well as his betters with more\r\ndelicate liquors.\" Burk, the historian of Virginia, who was by no means\r\na rigid censor, noticing the manners of the Virginians during the half\r\ncentury preceding the Revolution, says: \"The character of the people for\r\nhospitality and expense was now decided, and the wealth of the land\r\nproprietors, particularly on the banks of the rivers, enabled them to\r\nindulge their passions even to profusion and excess. Drinking parties\r\nwere then fashionable, in which the strongest head or stomach gained the\r\nvictory. The moments that could be spared from the bottle were devoted\r\nto cards. Cock-fighting was also fashionable.\"[495:B] On the same pages\r\nhe adds: \"I find, in 1747, a main of cocks advertised to be fought\r\nbetween Gloucester and James River. The cocks on one side were called\r\n'_Bacon's Thunderbolts_,' after the celebrated rebel of 1676.\"\r\n\r\nThe pay of the soldiers in 1756 was but eight pence a day, of which two\r\npence was reserved for supplying them with clothes. The meagre pay, and\r\nthe practice of impressing vagrants into the military service, increased\r\nmuch the difficulty of recruiting and of enforcing obedience and\r\nsubordination. Even Indians calling themselves friendly did not scruple\r\nto insult and annoy the inhabitants of the country through which they\r\npassed. One hundred and twenty Cherokees, passing through Lunenburg\r\nCounty, insulted people of all ranks, and a party of Catawbas behaved so\r\noutrageously at Williamsburg that it was necessary to call out the\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nAlthough Governor Dinwiddie was an able man, his zeal in military\r\naffairs sometimes outstripped his knowledge, and Washington was at times\r\ndistracted by inconsistent and impracticable orders, and harassed by\r\nundeserved complaints. It was indeed alleged by some, that if he could\r\nhave withstood the strong interest arrayed in favor of Washington, the\r\ngovernor would rather have given the command to Colonel Innes, although\r\nfar less competent, and an inhabitant of another colony, North Carolina.\r\nDinwiddie's partiality to Innes was attributed, by those unfriendly to\r\nthe governor, to national prejudice, for they were both natives of\r\nScotland.[496:A] Yet it appears by Dinwiddie's letters that he urgently\r\npressed the rank of colonel on Washington.[496:B] Washington, in\r\nhis letters to Speaker Robinson, complains heavily of the governor's\r\nline of conduct, and Robinson's replies were such as would widen the\r\nbreach.[496:C] The tenor of the governor's correspondence with\r\nWashington, in 1757, became so ungracious, peremptory, and even\r\noffensive, that he could not but attribute the change in his conduct\r\ntoward him to some secret detraction, and he gave utterance to a noble\r\nburst of eloquent self-defence. Dinwiddie's position was indeed trying,\r\nhis measures being thwarted by a rather disaffected legislature and an\r\narrogant aristocracy, and the censures thrown upon him, coming to us\r\nthrough a discolored medium of prejudice, ought to be taken with much\r\nallowance. However this may be, harsh and rather overbearing treatment\r\nfrom a British governor, together with the invidious distinctions drawn\r\nbetween colonial and British officers in regard to rank, naturally\r\ntended to abate Washington's loyalty, and thus gradually to fit him for\r\nthe great part which he was destined to perform in the war of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nLord Loudoun, the newly-appointed governor of Virginia, and\r\ncommander-in-chief of the colonies, now arrived in America, and called\r\na conference of governors and military officers to meet him at\r\nPhiladelphia. Washington, by the rather ungracious and reluctant leave\r\nof Dinwiddie, attended the conference. Yet Dinwiddie, in his letters to\r\nLoudoun, said of him: \"He is a very deserving gentleman, and has from\r\nthe beginning commanded the forces of this Dominion. He is much beloved,\r\nhas gone through many hardships in the service, has great merit, and can\r\nraise more men here than any one.\" He therefore urged his promotion to\r\nthe British establishment.[497:A] Washington had previously transmitted\r\nto the incompetent Loudoun an elaborate statement of the posture of\r\naffairs in Virginia, exhibiting the insufficiency of the militia and the\r\nnecessity of an offensive system of operations. But Loudoun determined\r\nto direct his main efforts against Canada, and to leave only twelve\r\nhundred men in the middle and southern provinces. Instead of receiving\r\naid, Virginia was required to send four hundred men to South Carolina.\r\nThe Virginia Regiment was now reduced to a thousand men. Colonel\r\nWashington, nevertheless, insisted that a favorable conjuncture was\r\npresented for capturing Fort Du Quesne, since the French, when attacked\r\nin Canada, would be unable to re-enforce that remote post. This wise\r\nadvice, although approved by Dinwiddie, was unheeded; and the campaign\r\nof the North proved inglorious, that of the South ineffectual. Toward\r\nthe close of the year, Washington, owing to multiplied cares, vexations,\r\nand consequent ill health, relinquished his post, and retired to Mount\r\nVernon, where he remained for several months.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1758, Robert Dinwiddie, after an arduous and disturbed\r\nadministration of five years, worn out with vexation and age, sailed\r\nfrom Virginia not much regretted, except by his particular friends. A\r\nscholar, a wit, and an amiable companion, in private life he deservedly\r\nwon esteem. The charge alleged against him of avarice and extortion in\r\nthe exaction of illegal fees, appears to have originated in political\r\nprejudice, and that of failing to account for sums of money transmitted\r\nby the British government, rests on the unsupported assertions of those\r\nwho were inimical to him. His place was filled for a short time by John\r\nBlair, president of the council.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Samuel Davies, by invitation, preached to the militia of\r\nHanover County, in Virginia, at a general muster, on the 8th of May,\r\n1758, with a view to the raising a company for Captain Samuel Meredith.\r\nIn this discourse Davies said: \"Need I inform you what barbarities and\r\ndepredations a mongrel race of Indian savages and French Papists have\r\nperpetrated upon our frontiers? How many deserted or demolished houses\r\nand plantations? How wide an extent of country abandoned? How many poor\r\nfamilies obliged to fly in consternation and leave their all behind\r\nthem? What breaches and separations between the nearest relations? What\r\npainful ruptures of heart from heart? What shocking dispersions of those\r\nonce united by the strongest and most endearing ties? Some lie dead,\r\nmangled with savage wounds, consumed to ashes with outrageous flames, or\r\ntorn and devoured by the beasts of the wilderness, while their bones lie\r\nwhitening in the sun, and serve as tragical memorials of the fatal spot\r\nwhere they fell. Others have been dragged away captives, and made the\r\nslaves of imperious and cruel savages: others have made their escape,\r\nand live to lament their butchered or captivated friends and relations.\r\nIn short, our frontiers have been drenched with the blood of our\r\nfellow-subjects through the length of a thousand miles, and new wounds\r\nare still opening. We, in these inland parts of the country are as yet\r\nunmolested, through the unmerited mercy of Heaven. But let us only\r\nglance a thought to the western extremities of our body politic, and\r\nwhat melancholy scenes open to our view! Now perhaps while I am\r\nspeaking, now while you are secure and unmolested, our fellow-subjects\r\nthere may be feeling the calamities I am now describing. Now, perhaps,\r\nthe savage shouts and whoops of Indians, and the screams and groans of\r\nsome butchered family, may be mingling their horrors and circulating\r\ntheir tremendous echoes through the wilderness of rocks and\r\nmountains.\"[499:A] There appears to be some resemblance between this\r\nclosing sentence and the following, in Fisher Ames' speech on the\r\nwestern posts: \"I can fancy that I listen to the yells of savage\r\nvengeance and the shrieks of torture. Already they seem to sigh in the\r\nwestern wind; already they mingle with every echo from the\r\nmountains.\"[499:B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[489:A] Memoir of Battle of Point Pleasant, by Samuel L.

Pitt, now minister, had resolved on a vigorous\r\nprosecution of the war in America, and it was quickly felt in every part\r\nof the British empire that there was a man at the helm. The department\r\nof the Middle and Southern Colonies was entrusted to General Forbes, and\r\nhe was ordered to undertake an expedition against Fort Du Quesne.\r\nWashington rejoined the army. Forbes having deferred the campaign too\r\nlate, the French and Indians renewed their merciless warfare. In the\r\nCounty of Augusta sixty persons were murdered. The Virginia troops were\r\naugmented to two thousand men, divided into two regiments: one under\r\nWashington, who was still commander-in-chief; the other, the new\r\nregiment, under Colonel William Byrd, of Westover. The strength of\r\nColonel Byrd's regiment at Fort Cumberland (August 3d, 1758,) was eight\r\nhundred and fifty-nine.[500:A]\r\n\r\nAs late as 1758 there were some descendants of the Pamunkey Indians\r\nstill residing on their original seat. The Rev. Andrew Burnaby makes\r\nmention of them in his Travels. A few words of their language were found\r\nsurviving as late as 1844.\r\n\r\nFrancis Fauquier, appointed governor, now reached Virginia. Late in\r\nJune, 1758, the Virginia troops left Winchester, and early in July\r\nhalted at Fort Cumberland.[501:A] At Washington's suggestion the light\r\nIndian dress, hunting-shirt and blanket, were adopted by the army.\r\nContrary to his advice, Forbes, instead of marching immediately upon the\r\nOhio, by Braddock's road, undertook to construct another from Raystown,\r\nin Pennsylvania. The general, it was supposed, was influenced by the\r\nPennsylvanians to open for them a more direct avenue of intercourse with\r\nthe west. The new road caused great delay. In disregard of Washington's\r\nadvice, Major Grant had been detached from the Loyal Hanna, with eight\r\nhundred men, to reconnoitre the country about Fort Du Quesne.\r\nPresumptuous temerity involved the detachment in a surprise and defeat\r\nsimilar to Braddock's; Grant and Major Andrew Lewis were made prisoners.\r\nOf the eight Virginia officers present five were slain, a sixth wounded,\r\nand a seventh captured. Captain Thomas Bullit, and fifty Virginians,\r\ndefended the baggage with great resolution, and contributed to save the\r\nremnant of the detachment. He was the only officer who escaped unhurt.\r\nOf one hundred and sixty-two Virginians, sixty-two were killed, and two\r\nwounded. Grant's total loss was two hundred and seventy-three killed,\r\nand forty-two wounded.\r\n\r\nWhen the main army was set in motion Washington requested to be put in\r\nadvance, and Forbes, profiting by Braddock's fatal error, complied with\r\nhis wish. Washington was called to headquarters, attended the councils\r\nof war, and, in compliance with the general's desire, drew up a line of\r\nmarch and order of battle. Forbes' army consisted of twelve hundred\r\nHighlanders, three hundred and fifty Royal Americans, twenty-seven\r\nhundred provincials from Pennsylvania, sixteen hundred from Virginia,\r\ntwo or three hundred from Maryland, and two companies from North\r\nCarolina, making in all, including the wagoners, between six and seven\r\nthousand men. This army was five months in reaching the Ohio. The main\r\nbody left Raystown on the 8th of October, 1758, and reached the camp at\r\nLoyal Hanna early in November. The troops were worn out with fatigue and\r\nexposure; winter had set in, and more than fifty miles of rugged country\r\nyet intervened between them and Fort Du Quesne. A council of war\r\ndeclared it unadvisable to proceed further in that campaign. Just at\r\nthis conjuncture, three prisoners were brought in, and they gave such a\r\nreport of the feeble state of the garrison at the fort, that it was\r\ndetermined to push forward at once. Washington, with his provincials,\r\nopened the way. The French, reduced to five hundred men, and deserted by\r\nthe Indians, set fire to the fort, and retired down the Ohio. Forbes\r\ntook possession of the post on the next day, (November 25th, 1758.) The\r\nworks were repaired, and the fort was now named Fort Pitt. An important\r\ncity, called after the same illustrious statesman, has been reared near\r\nthe spot. General Forbes, whose health had been declining during the\r\ncampaign, died shortly afterwards at Philadelphia. He was a native of\r\nScotland, and was educated as a physician; was an estimable and brave\r\nman, and of fine military talents.\r\n\r\nBurnaby, who visited Virginia about this time, in describing\r\nWilliamsburg, mentions the governor's palace as the only tolerably good\r\npublic building. The streets being unpaved are dusty, the soil being\r\nsandy. The miniature capital had the rare advantage of being free from\r\nmosquitoes; and it was, all things considered, a pleasant place of\r\nresidence. During the session of the assembly and of the general court,\r\nit was crowded with the gentry of the country. On these occasions there\r\nwere balls, and other amusements; but as soon as the public business was\r\ndispatched the visitors returned to their homes, and Williamsburg\r\nappeared to be deserted. Lightning-rods were now generally used in\r\nVirginia, and proved efficacious. At Spotswood's iron mines, on the\r\nbanks of the Rappahannock, there were smelted, annually, upwards of six\r\nhundred tons of metal. Coal mines had been opened with good success on\r\nthe James River near the falls. Not a tenth of the land in Virginia was\r\ncultivated; yet, besides tobacco, she produced considerable quantities\r\nof fruit, cattle, and grain. The bacon was held to be superior in flavor\r\nto any in the world; but the mutton and beef inferior to that of Great\r\nBritain. The horses were fleet and beautiful; and the breed was improved\r\nby frequent importations from England. Delicious fruits abounded, and\r\nin the early spring the eye of the traveller was charmed with the\r\nappearance of the orchards in full blossom. There were fifty-two\r\ncounties and seventy-seven parishes, and on the pages of the\r\nstatute-book forty-four towns; but one-half of these had not more than\r\nfive houses, and the other half, for the most part, were inconsiderable\r\nvillages. The exports of tobacco were between fifty and sixty thousand\r\nhogsheads, each weighing eight hundred or a thousand pounds. Their other\r\nexports were, to the Madeiras and the West Indies, cider, pork, lumber,\r\nand grain; to Great Britain, bar-iron, indigo, and a little ginseng. The\r\nonly domestic manufacture of any consequence was Virginia cloth, which\r\nwas commonly worn. There were between sixty and seventy clergymen, \"men\r\nin general of sober and exemplary lives.\" Burnaby describes the\r\nVirginians as indolent, easy, good-natured, fond of society, and much\r\ngiven to convivial pleasures. They were devoid of enterprise and\r\nincapable of enduring fatigue. Their authority over their slaves\r\nrendered them vain, imperious, and destitute of refinement. Negroes and\r\nIndians they looked upon as scarcely of the human species; so that in\r\ncase of violence, or even murder committed upon them, it was almost\r\nimpossible to bring them to justice. Such was Burnaby's report on this\r\nsubject. During the reign of James the Second, John Page, in a religious\r\nwork composed by him, thought it necessary to combat, in an elaborate\r\nargument, the opinion that a master had the power of life and death over\r\nhis slave.\r\n\r\nWashington, after furnishing a detachment from his regiment as a\r\ngarrison for Fort Pitt, then considered as within the jurisdiction of\r\nVirginia, marched back to Winchester. Thence he proceeded to\r\nWilliamsburg to take his seat in the assembly, having been elected by\r\nthe County of Frederick. He resigned his military commission in\r\nDecember, after having been engaged in the service for more than five\r\nyears. His health had been impaired, and domestic affairs demanded his\r\nattention. On the 6th day of January, 1759, he was married to Martha,\r\nwidow of John Parke Custis, and daughter of John Dandridge, a lady in\r\nwhom were united wealth, beauty, and an amiable temper.\r\n\r\nBy an order of the assembly, Speaker Robinson was directed to return\r\ntheir thanks to Colonel Washington, on behalf of the colony, for the\r\ndistinguished military services which he had rendered to the country. As\r\nsoon as he took his seat in the house, the speaker performed this duty\r\nin such glowing terms as quite overwhelmed him. Washington rose to\r\nexpress his acknowledgments for the honor, but was so disconcerted as to\r\nbe unable to articulate a word distinctly. He blushed and faltered for a\r\nmoment, when the speaker relieved him from his embarrassment by saying,\r\n\"Sit down, Mr. Washington, your modesty equals your valor, and that\r\nsurpasses the power of any language that I possess.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Stobo, a hostage in the hands of the French, was detained for\r\nyears at Quebec, enduring frequently the hardships of actual\r\nimprisonment, and for a time being under condemnation of death. At\r\nlength he was released from this apprehension and from close\r\nconfinement, and in May, 1759, in company of several others, effected\r\nhis escape. Eluding the enemy by prudence and gallantry, he and his\r\nassociates made their way to Louisburg. Here Stobo was gladly welcomed,\r\nand he joined General Wolfe, to whom his information proved serviceable;\r\nand he appears to have been present at the capture of Quebec. Shortly\r\nafterwards he returned to Virginia, (November, 1759.) The assembly\r\ngranted him a thousand pounds, requested the governor to promote him,\r\nand presented their thanks to him for his fidelity, fortitude, and\r\ncourage, by Mr. R. C. Nicholas, Mr. Richard Bland, and Mr. George\r\nWashington. Stobo returned to England, where his memoirs were published.\r\nIn 1760 he was made a captain in Amherst's Regiment, then serving in\r\nAmerica; and he held that position in 1765.\r\n\r\nVan Braam, who had been kept prisoner at Montreal, was not released\r\nuntil the surrender of that city to the British in the ensuing year. He\r\nreturned to Williamsburg shortly afterwards. In 1770 he obtained his\r\nshare of the Virginia bounty lands; and in 1777 was made major in the\r\nRoyal Americans, then in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nDuring this year (1759) Rev. Andrew Burnaby visited Mount Vernon, of\r\nwhich he remarks: \"This place is the property of Colonel Washington, and\r\ntruly deserving of its owner. The house is most beautifully situated\r\nupon a very high hill on the banks of the Potomac, and commands a noble\r\nprospect of water, of cliffs, of woods, and plantations. The river is\r\nnear two miles broad though two hundred from the mouth; and divides the\r\ndominions of Virginia from Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nBurnaby, in his Travels, describes the condition of the Germans on the\r\nShenandoah as follows: \"I could not but reflect with pleasure on the\r\nsituation of these people, and think, if there is such a thing as\r\nhappiness in this life, that they enjoy it. Far from the bustle of the\r\nworld, they live in the most delightful climate and richest soil\r\nimaginable; they are everywhere surrounded with beautiful prospects and\r\nsylvan scenes, lofty mountains, transparent streams, falls of water,\r\nrich valleys, and majestic woods; the whole, interspersed with an\r\ninfinite variety of flowering shrubs, constitute the landscape\r\nsurrounding them; they are subject to few diseases; are generally\r\nrobust, and live in perfect liberty; they are ignorant of want, and\r\nacquainted with but few vices; their inexperience of the elegancies of\r\nlife precludes any regret that they possess not the means of enjoying\r\nthem; but they possess what many princes would give their dominions\r\nfor--health, content, and tranquillity of mind.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1761 died the Rev. Thomas Dawson, President of the College\r\nof William and Mary; he was succeeded by the Rev. William Yates. During\r\nthe same year died the Rev. Samuel Davies.[505:A] He accepted the\r\npresidency of the College of New Jersey in 1759, and died on the 4th of\r\nFebruary, 1761. In this year was incorporated the town of Staunton, in\r\nAugusta County, and in the following year Romney, in the County of\r\nHampshire.\r\n\r\nDuring the tragic scenes of the French and Indian war, the persecutions\r\nof the dissenting Presbyterians, whose aid was so necessary in defending\r\nthe frontiers, were essentially lessened. They were indebted to the\r\nconfusion and dangers of the times for a freedom in matters of religion\r\nwhich was denied them in a period of tranquillity. Their ministers now\r\nenjoyed the privilege of preaching where they pleased, and were no\r\nlonger restrained by the Virginia intolerant construction of the\r\ntoleration act. The Baptists began to multiply their number in Virginia,\r\nand their new enthusiasm became the object of persecution. But events\r\nwere about to turn the tide of popular prejudice, and direct it against\r\nthe clergy of the established church, and to give to the dissenters a\r\nstronger foothold and a higher vantage ground. Those ministers of the\r\nestablishment who had been vainly endeavoring to repress the progress of\r\ndissent by ridicule, detraction, and insult, some of them combining with\r\nand leading on a mob of \"lewd fellows of the baser sort\" in these\r\npersecuting indignities, now began to find it necessary to defend\r\nthemselves against the rising storm of public indignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[500:A] The officers were Lieutenant-Colonel George Mercer, Major\r\nWilliam Peachy, Captains S. Munford, Thomas Cocke, Hancock Eustace, John\r\nField, John Posey, Thomas Fleming, John Roote, and Samuel Meredith.\r\n\r\n[501:A] See in Bland Papers, i. 9, Robert Munford's letter, dated at the\r\nCamp near Fort Cumberland. He was father of the translator of Homer, and\r\ngrandfather to George W. Munford, Esq., Secretary of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[505:A] John Rodgers Davies, his third son, was at Princeton College at\r\nthe same time with Mr. Madison, and leaving it, at the commencement of\r\nthe revolutionary war, became an officer in the army, and as such\r\nenjoyed the esteem of Washington. He is said to have been engaged in the\r\nauditor's office at Richmond. He removed to Sussex County, and died\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\n1763.\r\n\r\n     The Parsons' Cause--Patrick Henry's Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year 1763 occurred the famous \"Parsons' Cause,\" in which the\r\ngenius of Patrick Henry first shone forth. The emoluments of the clergy\r\nof the established church for a long time had consisted of sixteen\r\nthousand pounds of tobacco, contributed by each parish. The tobacco crop\r\nof 1755 failing, in consequence of a drought, and the exigencies of the\r\ncolony being greatly augmented by the French and Indian war, the\r\nassembly passed an act, to endure for ten months, authorizing all debts\r\ndue in tobacco to be paid either in kind or in money, at the rate of\r\nsixteen shillings and eight pence for every hundred pounds of tobacco.\r\nThis was equivalent to two pence per pound, and hence the act was styled\r\nby the clergy the \"Two Penny Act.\" As the price of tobacco now rose to\r\nsix pence per pound, the reduction amounted to sixty-six and two-thirds\r\nper cent. At two pence the salary of a minister clergy was about one\r\nhundred and thirty-three pounds; at six pence, about four hundred\r\npounds. Yet the act must have operated in relief of the indebted clergy\r\nequally with other debtors, and many of the ministers were in debt. It\r\nwas by no means the intention of the assembly to abridge the maintenance\r\nof the clergy, or to bear harder upon them than upon all other public\r\ncreditors; and as they, under the new act, in fact, received in general\r\na larger salary than they had received in any year since it was first\r\nregulated by law, they, above all men, ought to have been content with\r\nit in a year of so much distress.[507:A] The taxes were enormous, and\r\nfell most heavily upon planters of limited means; and the tobacco-crop\r\nwas greatly fallen off. The Rev. James Maury, in whose behalf the suit\r\nwas afterwards brought, had himself at the time expressly approved of\r\nthe Two Penny Act, and said: \"In my own case, who am entitled to upwards\r\nof seventeen thousand weight of tobacco per annum, the difference\r\namounts to a considerable sum. However, each individual must expect to\r\nshare in the misfortunes of the community to which he belongs.\"[508:A]\r\nThe law was universal in its operation, embracing private debts, public,\r\ncounty, and parish levies, and the fees of all civil officers. Its\r\neffect upon the clergy was to reduce their salary to a moderate amount\r\nin money, far less, indeed, than the sixteen thousand pounds which they\r\nwere ordinarily entitled to, yet still rather more than what they had\r\nusually received. The act did not contain the usual clause, by which\r\nacts altering previous acts approved by the crown were suspended until\r\nthey should receive the royal sanction, since it might require the\r\nentire ten months, the term of its operation, to learn the determination\r\nof the crown. The king had a few years before expressly refused to allow\r\nthe assembly to dispense with the suspending clause in any such act. The\r\nregal authority was thus apparently abnegated; necessity discarding\r\nforms, and the safety of the people being the supreme law. Up to the\r\ntime of the Revolution the king freely exercised his authority in\r\nvetoing acts of the assembly when they had been approved by large\r\nmajorities of the house of burgesses and of the council. The practice\r\nwas to print all the acts at the close of each session, and when an act\r\nwas negatived by the king, that fact was written against the act with a\r\npen.[508:B]\r\n\r\nNo open resistance was offered to the Two Penny Act; but the greater\r\nnumber of clergy petitioned the house of burgesses to grant them a more\r\nliberal provision for their maintenance. Their petition set forth: \"That\r\nthe salary appointed by law for the clergy is so scanty that it is with\r\ndifficulty they support themselves and families, and can by no means\r\nmake any provision for their widows and children, who are generally left\r\nto the charity of their friends; that the small encouragement given to\r\nclergymen is a reason why so few come into this colony from the two\r\nuniversities; and that so many, who are a disgrace to the ministry, find\r\nopportunities to fill the parishes; that the raising the salary would\r\nprove of great service to the colony, as a decent subsistence would be a\r\ngreat encouragement to the youth to take orders, for want of which few\r\ngentlemen have hitherto thought it worth their while to bring up their\r\nchildren in the study of divinity; that they generally spent many years\r\nof their lives at great expense in study, when their patrimony is pretty\r\nwell exhausted; and when in holy orders they cannot follow any secular\r\nemployment for the advancement of their fortunes, and may on that\r\naccount expect a more liberal provision.\"[509:A] Another relief act,\r\nsimilar to that of 1755, fixing the value of tobacco at eighteen\r\nshillings a hundred, was passed in 1758[509:B] upon a mere anticipation\r\nof another scanty crop.[509:C] Burk[509:D] attributes the rise in the\r\nprice of tobacco to the arts of an extravagant speculator; but he cites\r\nno authority for the statement, and the acts themselves expressly\r\nattribute the scarcity, in 1755, to \"drought,\" and in 1757 to\r\n\"unseasonableness of the weather.\"[509:E] The crop did fall short, and\r\nthe price rose extremely high; and contention ensued between the\r\nplanters and the clergy. The Rev. John Camm, rector of York Hampton\r\nParish, assailed the \"Two Penny Act\" in a pamphlet of that title, which\r\nwas replied to severally by Colonel Richard Bland and Colonel Landon\r\nCarter. An acrimonious controversy took place in the _Virginia Gazette_;\r\nbut the cause of the clergy became at length so unpopular, that a\r\nprinter could not be found in Virginia willing to publish Camm's\r\nrejoinder to Bland and Carter, styled the \"Colonels Dismounted,\" and he\r\nwas obliged to resort to Maryland for that purpose. The colonels\r\nretorted, and this angry dispute threw the colony into great excitement.\r\nAt last the clergy appealed to the king in council. By an act of\r\nassembly passed as early as the year 1662, a salary of eighty pounds per\r\nannum was settled upon every minister, \"to be paid in the valuable\r\ncommodities of the country--if in tobacco, at twelve shillings the\r\nhundred; if in corn, at ten shillings the barrel.\" In 1696 the salary of\r\nthe clergy was fixed at sixteen thousand pounds of tobacco, worth at\r\nthat time about eighty pounds. This continued to be the amount of their\r\nstipends until 1731, when, the value of tobacco being raised, they\r\nincreased to about one hundred or one hundred and twenty pounds,\r\nexclusive of their glebes and other perquisites. In Virginia, besides\r\nthe salaries of the clergy, the people had to bear parochial, county,\r\nand public levies, and fees of clerks, sheriffs, surveyors, and other\r\nofficers, all of which were payable in tobacco, the paper currency of\r\nthe colony having banished gold and silver from the colony.[510:A] The\r\nconsequence of this state of things was that a failure in the crop\r\ninvolved the people in general distress; for by law if the salaries of\r\nthe clergy and the fees of officers were not paid in tobacco by the\r\ntenth day of April, the property of delinquents was liable to be\r\ndistrained, and if not replevied within five days, to be sold at\r\nauction. Were they to be exposed to cruel imposition and exactions; to\r\nhave their estates seized and sacrificed, \"for not complying with laws\r\nwhich Providence had made it impossible to comply with? Common sense, as\r\nwell as common humanity, will tell you that they are not, and that it is\r\nimpossible any instruction to a governor can be construed so contrary to\r\nthe first principles of justice and equity, as to prevent his assent to\r\na law for relieving a colony in a case of such general distress and\r\ncalamity.\"[510:B] Sherlock, Bishop of London, in his letter to the lords\r\nof trade and plantations, denounced the act of 1758, as binding the\r\nking's hands, and manifestly tending to draw the people of the\r\nplantations from their allegiance to the king. It was replied, on the\r\nother hand, that if the Virginians could ever entertain the thought of\r\nwithdrawing from their dependency on England, nothing could be more apt\r\nto bring about such a result than the denying them the right to protect\r\nthemselves from distress and calamity in so trying an emergency. In the\r\nyear when this relief act was passed, many thousands of the colonists\r\ndid not make one pound of tobacco, and if all of it raised in the\r\ncolony had been divided among the tithables, \"they would not have had\r\ntwo hundred pounds a man to pay the taxes, for the support of the war,\r\ntheir levies and other public dues, and to provide a scanty subsistence\r\nfor themselves and families;\" and \"the general assembly were obliged to\r\nissue money from the public funds to keep the people from starving.\" The\r\nact had been denounced as treasonable; but were the legislature to sit\r\nwith folded arms, silent and inactive, amid the miseries of the people?\r\n\"This would have been treason indeed,--treason against the\r\nstate,--against the clemency of the royal majesty.\" Many landlords and\r\ncivil officers were members of the assembly in 1758, and their fees and\r\nrents were payable in tobacco; nevertheless, they cheerfully promoted\r\nthe enactment of a measure by which they were to suffer great losses.\r\nThe royal prerogative in the hands of a benign sovereign could only be\r\nexerted for \"the good of the people, and not for their destruction.\"\r\n\"When, therefore, the governor and council (to whom this power is in\r\npart delegated) find, from the uncertainty and variableness of human\r\naffairs, that any accident happens which general instructions can by no\r\nmeans provide for, or which, by a rigid construction of them, would\r\ndestroy a people so far distant from the royal presence, before they can\r\napply to the throne for relief, it is their duty as good magistrates to\r\nexercise this power as the exigency of the state requires; and though\r\nthey should deviate from the strict letter of an instruction, or,\r\nperhaps in a small degree from the fixed rule of the constitution, yet\r\nsuch a deviation cannot possibly be treason, when it is intended to\r\nproduce the most salutary end--the preservation of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Andrew Burnaby, who passed some months in Virginia about the\r\ntime of this dispute, travelling through the colony and conversing\r\nfreely with all ranks of people, expresses himself on the subject in the\r\nfollowing manner: \"Upon the whole, however, as on the one hand I\r\ndisapprove of the proceedings of the assembly in this affair, so on the\r\nother I cannot approve of the steps which were taken by the clergy; that\r\nviolence of temper, that disrespectful behavior toward the governor,\r\nthat unworthy treatment of their commissary, and, to mention nothing\r\nelse, that confusion of proceeding in the convention,[512:A] of which\r\nsome, though not the majority, as has been invidiously represented, were\r\nguilty; these things were surely unbecoming the sacred character they\r\nare invested with, and the moderation of those persons who ought in all\r\nthings to imitate the conduct of their Divine Master. If instead of\r\nflying out in invectives against the legislature, of accusing the\r\ngovernor of having given up the cause of religion by passing the bill,\r\nwhen, in fact, had he rejected it, he would never have been able to have\r\ngot any supplies during the course of the war, though ever so much\r\nwanted; if instead of charging the commissary[512:B] with want of zeal,\r\nfor having exhorted them to moderate measures, they had followed the\r\nprudent counsels of that excellent man, and had acted with more temper\r\nand moderation, they might, I am persuaded, in a very short time have\r\nobtained any redress they could reasonably have desired. The people in\r\ngeneral were extremely well affected toward the clergy.\"[512:C]\r\n\r\nThe following paper exhibits the view maintained by Richard Henry Lee on\r\nthis mooted topic:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Reasons and Objections to Mr. Camm's Appeal._\r\n\r\n     \"OBJECTED, on the part of Mr. Camm: That the law of 1758, as\r\n     it tended to suspend the act of 1748, which had obtained the\r\n     royal approbation, and as it was contrary to his majesty's\r\n     instructions to his governor, was void _ab initio_, and was so\r\n     declared by his majesty's order of disapprobation of 10th of\r\n     August, 1759.\r\n\r\n     \"ANSWER.--Whatever might be allowed to be the effect of these\r\n     objections, and however they might affect those who made the\r\n     law, it would be very hard that they should subject to a heavy\r\n     penalty two innocent subjects,[512:D] who have been guilty of\r\n     no offence but that of obeying a law passed regularly in\r\n     appearance through the several branches of the legislature of\r\n     the colony while it had the force of a law upon the spot. It\r\n     would be to punish them for a mistake of the assembly. But the\r\n     objections do not prove either that the law was a nullity from\r\n     the beginning by its tending to suspend the act of 1748, or by\r\n     being assented to by the governor, contrary to his majesty's\r\n     instructions to him, or that it became void by relation, _ab\r\n     initio_, from any retrospective declarations of his majesty.\r\n     As to the law in question tending to suspend the act of 1748,\r\n     which had received the royal approbation, a power given by the\r\n     crown to make laws implies a power to suspend or even repeal\r\n     former laws which are become inconvenient or mischievous, as\r\n     the law of 1748 was; otherwise a country at the distance of\r\n     three thousand miles might be subject to great calamities,\r\n     before relief could be obtained, for which reason such power\r\n     is lodged in the legislature of the country.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the governor's consent being contrary to his majesty's\r\n     instructions to him, it is imagined that his majesty's\r\n     instructions to the governor are private directions for his\r\n     conduct in his government, liable to be sometimes dispensed\r\n     with upon extraordinary emergencies, the propriety of which he\r\n     may be called to explain. The instructions are not addressed\r\n     to the people nor promulgated among them; they are not public\r\n     instruments, nor lodged among the public records of the\r\n     province. The people know the governor's authority by his\r\n     commission; his assent is virtually that of the crown, and by\r\n     his assent the law is in force till his majesty's\r\n     disapprobation arrives and is ratified, consequently\r\n     everything done in the colony till then conformably thereto is\r\n     legal.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the order in council having declared the act void _ab\r\n     initio_, it seems to have been a mistake, the order being as\r\n     usual generally expressed that the act be disallowed, declared\r\n     void, and of none effect, which purposely left the effect of\r\n     the law, during the interval, open to its legal consequences.\r\n\r\n     \"The king's commission to his governor directs him that he\r\n     shall transmit all laws in three months after their passage.\r\n     That when the laws are so signified, then such and so many of\r\n     the said laws as shall be disallowed and signified to the\r\n     governor should from thenceforth cease, etc. Upon appeal from\r\n     the Cockpit to the privy council, the cause was put off _sine\r\n     die_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the clergy appealed to the king, they sent over the Rev. John Camm\r\nto plead their cause in England, and agents were employed by the\r\nassembly to resist it. Mr. Camm remained eighteen months in England in\r\nprosecution of the appeal. The king at length, by the unanimous advice\r\nof the lords of trade, denounced the Two Penny Act as an usurpation, and\r\ndeclared it null and void: and the governor, by express instructions,\r\nissued a proclamation to that effect. Fauquier was reprimanded for not\r\nhaving negatived the bill, and was threatened with recall; and he\r\npleaded in excuse that he had subscribed the law in conformity with the\r\nadvice of the council, and contrary to his own judgment. The board of\r\ntrade deemed the apology unsatisfactory.[514:A]\r\n\r\nBut the king's decision not being retrospective, the repeal of the act\r\nnot rendering it void from the beginning, was in effect futile, the act\r\nhaving been passed to be in force for only one year.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Camm's instance a suit was brought against the vestry of his\r\nparish of York Hampton, for the recovery of the salary in tobacco, the\r\nassembly having, in the mean while, determined to support the vestries\r\nin their defence. The case was decided against the plaintiff, Mr. Camm,\r\nwho, in accordance with the advice of the board of trade, thereupon\r\nappealed to the king in council. The appeal was dismissed upon some\r\ninformality. Camm experienced the perfidy of courtiers, and it being the\r\npolicy of the government to avoid a collision with the assembly, the\r\nclergy were left in the lurch, to take their chances in the Virginia\r\ncourts of law. The Rev. Mr. Warrington, grandfather of Commodore Lewis\r\nWarrington, endeavored to bring a suit for his salary, payable in\r\ntobacco, in the general court, but it was not permitted to be tried, the\r\ncourt awaiting the determination of Camm's case in England, which was in\r\neffect an indefinite postponement. Mr. Warrington then brought suit in\r\nthe county court of Elizabeth City, and the jury brought in a special\r\nverdict, allowing him some damages, but declaring the law valid,\r\nnotwithstanding the king's decision to the contrary. The Rev. Alexander\r\nWhite, of King William County, brought a similar suit, and the court\r\nreferring both the law and the fact to the jury, they gave the plaintiff\r\ntrivial damages. The County of Hanover was selected as the scene of the\r\nmost important trial of this question, and as all the causes stood on\r\nthe same foot, the decision of this would determine all. This was the\r\nsuit brought by the Rev. James Maury, of an adjoining parish. The county\r\ncourt of Hanover (November, 1763,) decided the point of law in favor of\r\nthe minister, thus declaring the \"Two Penny Act\" to be no law, as having\r\nbeen annulled by the crown, and it was ordered that at the next court a\r\njury, on a writ of inquiry, should determine whether the plaintiff was\r\nentitled to damages, and if so, how much? Maury's success before the\r\njury seemed now inevitable, since there could be no dispute relative to\r\nthe facts of the case. Mr. John Lewis, who had defended the popular\r\nside, retired from the cause as virtually decided, and as being now only\r\na question of damages. The defendants, the collectors of that court, as\r\na dernier resort, employed Patrick Henry, Jr., to appear in their behalf\r\nat the next hearing. The suit came to trial again on the first of\r\nDecember, a select jury being ordered to be summoned. On an occasion of\r\nsuch universal interest, an extraordinary concourse of people assembled\r\nat Hanover Court-house, not only from that county, but also from the\r\ncounties adjoining. The court-house (which is still standing, but\r\nsomewhat altered,) and yard were thronged, and twenty clergymen sat on\r\nthe bench to witness a contest in which they had so much at stake. The\r\nRev. Patrick Henry, uncle to the youthful attorney, retired from the\r\ncourt and returned home, at his request, he saying that he should have\r\nto utter some harsh things toward the clergy, which he would not like to\r\ndo in his presence. The presiding magistrate was the father of young\r\nHenry. The sheriff, according to Mr. Maury's own account, finding some\r\ngentlemen unwilling to serve on the jury, summoned men of the common\r\npeople. Mr. Maury objected to them, but Patrick Henry insisting that\r\n\"they were honest men,\" they were immediately called to the book and\r\nsworn. Three or four of them, it was said, were dissenters \"of that\r\ndenomination called 'New Lights.'\" On the plaintiff's side the only\r\nevidence was that of Messrs. Gist and McDowall, tobacco-buyers, who\r\ntestified that fifty shillings per hundred weight was the current price\r\nof tobacco at that time. On the defendant's side was produced the Rev.\r\nJames Maury's receipt for one hundred and forty-four pounds paid him by\r\nThomas Johnson, Jr. The case was opened for the plaintiff by Peter\r\nLyons. When Patrick Henry rose to reply, his commencement was awkward,\r\nunpromising, embarrassed. In a few moments he began to warm with his\r\nsubject, and catching inspiration from the surrounding scene, his\r\nattitude grew more erect, his gesture bolder, his eye kindled and\r\ndilated with the radiance of genius, his voice ceased to falter, and the\r\nwitchery of its tones made the blood run cold and the hair stand on end.\r\nThe people, charmed by the enchanter's magnetic influence, hung with\r\nrapture upon his accents; in every part of the house, on every bench, in\r\nevery window, they stooped forward from their stands in breathless\r\nsilence, astonished, delighted, riveted upon the youthful orator, whose\r\neloquence blended the beauty of the rainbow with the terror of the\r\ncataract. He contended that the act of 1758 had every characteristic of\r\na good law, and could not be annulled consistently with the original\r\ncompact between king and people, and he declared that a king who\r\ndisallowed laws so salutary, from being the father of his people\r\ndegenerated into a tyrant, and forfeited all right to obedience. Some\r\npart of the audience were struck with horror at this declaration, and\r\nthe opposing advocate, Mr. Lyons, exclaimed, in impassioned tones, \"The\r\ngentleman has spoken treason!\" and from some gentlemen in the crowd\r\narose a confused murmur of \"Treason! Treason!\" Yet Henry, without any\r\ninterruption from the court, proceeded in his bold philippic; and one of\r\nthe jury was so carried away by his feelings as every now and then to\r\ngive the speaker a nod of approbation. He urged that the clergy of the\r\nestablished church by thus refusing acquiescence in the law of the land\r\ncounteracted the great object of their institution, and, therefore,\r\ninstead of being regarded as useful members of the State, ought to be\r\nconsidered as enemies of the community. In the close of his speech of an\r\nhour's length, he called upon the jury, unless they were disposed to\r\nrivet the chains of bondage on their own necks, to teach the defendant\r\nsuch a lesson, by their decision of this case, as would be a warning to\r\nhim and his brethren not to have the temerity in future to dispute the\r\nvalidity of laws authenticated by the only authority which, in his\r\nopinion, could give force to laws for the government of this\r\ncolony.[517:A] Amid the storm of his invective the discomfited and\r\nindignant clergy, feeling that the day was lost, retired. Young Henry's\r\nfather sat on the bench bedewed with tears of conflicting emotions and\r\nfond surprise. The jury, in less than five minutes, returned a verdict\r\nof one penny damages. Mr. Lyons insisted that as the verdict was\r\ncontrary to the evidence, the jury ought to be sent out again, but the\r\ncourt admitted the verdict without hesitation. The plaintiff's counsel\r\nthen in vain endeavored to have the evidence in behalf of the plaintiff\r\nrecorded. His motion for a new trial met with the same fate. He then\r\nmoved, \"that it might be admitted to record, that he had made a motion\r\nfor a new trial because he considered the verdict contrary to evidence,\r\nand that the motion had been rejected,\" which, after much altercation,\r\nwas agreed to. He lastly moved for an appeal, which too was granted.\r\nAcclamations resounded within the house and without, and in spite of\r\ncries of \"Order! Order!\" Patrick Henry was reluctantly lifted up and\r\nborne in triumph on the shoulders of his excited admirers. He was now\r\nthe man of the people. In after-years, aged men who had been present at\r\nthe trial of this cause reckoned it the highest encomium that they could\r\nbestow upon an orator to say of him: \"He is almost equal to Patrick when\r\nhe plead[517:B] against the parsons.\"[517:C]\r\n\r\nThis speech of Henry's was looked upon by the clergy and their\r\nsupporters as pleading for the assumption of a power to bind the king's\r\nhands, as asserting such a supremacy in provincial legislatures as was\r\nincompatible with the dignity of the Church of England, and as\r\nmanifestly tending to draw the people of the colonies away from their\r\nallegiance to the king. Mr. Cootes, merchant on James River, on coming\r\nout of the court, said that he would have given a considerable sum out\r\nof his own pocket rather than his friend Patrick should have been guilty\r\nof treason, but little, if any, less criminal than that which had\r\nbrought Simon Lord Lovat to the block. The clergy and their adherents\r\ndeemed Henry's speech as exceeding the most inflammatory and seditious\r\nharangues of the Roman tribunes of the common people. The Rev. Mr.\r\nBoucher, rector of Hanover Parish, in the County of King George,\r\naccounted one of the best preachers of his time, said: \"The assembly was\r\nfound to have done and the clergy to have suffered wrong. The aggrieved\r\nmay, and we hope often do, forgive, but it has been observed that\r\naggressors rarely forgive. Ever since this controversy, your clergy have\r\nexperienced every kind of discourtesy and discouragement.\"[518:A]\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the municipal affairs of Virginia could not be\r\nrightly managed, or safely interfered with, by a slow-moving government\r\nthree thousand miles distant. The act of 1758 appears to have been\r\ngrounded on humanity, the law of nature, and necessity.\r\n\r\nHenry's speech in \"the Parsons' Cause,\" and the verdict of the jury, may\r\nbe said in a certain sense to have been the commencement of the\r\nRevolution in Virginia; and Hanover, where dissent had appeared, was the\r\nstarting-point. Wirt's description of the scene has rendered it classic,\r\nand notwithstanding the faults of a style sometimes too florid and\r\nextravagant, there is a charm in the biography of Henry which stamps it\r\nas one of those works of genius which \"men will not willingly let die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[507:A] Colonel Richard Bland's Letter to the Clergy.\r\n\r\n[508:A] Memoirs of Huguenot Family, 402.\r\n\r\n[508:B] Journals of the house of burgesses thus marked are in the\r\npossession of Mr. Grigsby.\r\n\r\n[509:A] Colonel Bland's Letter to the Clergy, 6.\r\n\r\n[509:B] Hening, vii. 240.\r\n\r\n[509:C] Ibid., vi. 568.\r\n\r\n[509:D] Hist. of Va., iii. 302.\r\n\r\n[509:E] See also A.

The dwelling-house is no\r\nlonger standing; antique hedges of box and an avenue of aged trees\r\nrecall recollections of the past. Studley farm, devoid of any\r\npicturesque scenery, is surrounded by woods; so that Henry was\r\nactually,--\r\n\r\n     \"The forest-born Demosthenes,\r\n      Whose thunder shook the Philip of the seas.\"[519:A]\r\n\r\nHis parents were in moderate but easy circumstances. The father, John\r\nHenry, was a native of Aberdeen, in Scotland; he was a cousin of David\r\nHenry, who was a brother-in-law of Edward Cave, and co-editor with him\r\nof the _Gentleman's Magazine_, and his successor. Some say that John\r\nHenry married Jane, sister of Dr. William Robertson, the historian, and\r\nthat in this way Patrick Henry and Lord Brougham came to be related.\r\nJohn Henry, who emigrated to Virginia some time before 1730, enjoyed the\r\nfriendship and patronage of Governor Dinwiddie, who introduced him to\r\nthe acquaintance of Colonel John Syme, of Hanover, in whose family he\r\nbecame domesticated, and with whose widow he intermarried. Her maiden\r\nname was Sarah Winston, of a good old family. Colonel Byrd describes her\r\nas \"a portly, handsome dame,\" \"of a lively, cheerful conversation, with\r\nmuch less reserve than most of her countrywomen. It becomes her very\r\nwell, and sets off her other agreeable qualities to advantage.\" \"The\r\ncourteous widow invited me to rest myself there that good day, and to go\r\nto church with her; but I excused myself by telling her she would\r\ncertainly spoil my devotion. Then she civilly entreated me to make her\r\nhouse my home whenever I visited my plantations, which made me bow low,\r\nand thank her very kindly.\" She possessed a mild and benevolent\r\ndisposition, undeviating probity, correct understanding, and easy\r\nelocution. Colonel Syme had represented the County of Hanover in the\r\nhouse of burgesses. He left a son who, according to Colonel Byrd,\r\ninherited all the strong features of his sire, not softened in the least\r\nby those of his mother.[520:A]\r\n\r\nJohn Henry, father of Patrick Henry, Jr., was colonel of his regiment,\r\ncounty surveyor, and, for many years, presiding magistrate of Hanover\r\nCounty. He was a loyal subject, and took pleasure in drinking the king's\r\nhealth at the head of his regiment. He enjoyed the advantage of a\r\nliberal education; his understanding was plain but solid. He was a\r\nmember of the established church, but was supposed to be more conversant\r\nwith Livy and Horace than with the Bible. He appears to have made a map\r\nof Virginia which was published in London in 1770.[521:A]\r\n\r\nWhen James Waddel first came to Virginia he visited the Rev. Samuel\r\nDavies in Hanover, near where Colonel John Henry lived, and being\r\nintroduced to him, on a Sunday, he accepted an invitation to accompany\r\nhim home. At parting, Mr. Davies remarked to young Waddel, that he would\r\nnot find the Sabbath observed in Virginia as in Pennsylvania; and he\r\nwould have to bear with many things which he would wish to be otherwise.\r\nSoon after the settlement of Colonel John Henry in Virginia, Patrick,\r\nhis brother, followed him, and after some interval became, by his\r\nbrother's interest, (April, 1733,) rector of St. George's Parish, in the\r\nnew County of Spotsylvania, where he remained only one year. He\r\nafterwards became rector of St. Paul's Church in Hanover. John Henry, in\r\na few years after the birth of his son Patrick, removed from Studley to\r\nMount Brilliant, now the Retreat, in the same county; and it was here\r\nthat the future orator was principally educated. The father, a good\r\nclassical scholar, had opened a grammar-school in his own house, and\r\nPatrick, after learning the first rudiments at an \"old field school\" in\r\nthe neighborhood, at ten years of age commenced his studies under his\r\nfather, with whom he acquired an English education, and at the age of\r\nfifteen had advanced in Latin so far as to read Virgil and Livy; had\r\nlearned to read the Greek characters, and attained some proficiency in\r\nthe mathematics. At this age his scholastic education appears to have\r\nended, and, as he mentioned to John Adams in 1774, he never read a Latin\r\nbook after that. His attainments, however, evince that he could not have\r\nbeen so deficient in application to study as has been commonly supposed.\r\nWith a taste so prevalent, and for which his kinsmen, the Winstons, were\r\npeculiarly distinguished, he was fond of hunting and angling. He would,\r\nit is said, recline under the shade of a tree overhanging the\r\nsequestered stream, watching in indolent repose the motionless cork of\r\nhis fishing-line.\r\n\r\nHe loved solitude, and in hunting chose not to accompany the noisy set\r\nthat drove the deer, but preferred to occupy the silent \"stand,\" where\r\nfor hours he might muse alone and indulge \"the pleasing solitariness of\r\nthought.\" The glowing fancy of Wirt has, perhaps, thrown over these\r\nparticulars some prismatic coloring. Young Henry, probably, after all,\r\nfished and hunted pretty much like other lads in his neighborhood. It\r\nwould, perhaps, not be easy to prove that he was fonder of fishing and\r\nhunting than George Mason, George Washington, and many other of his\r\ncotemporaries. From his eleventh to his twenty-second year he lived in\r\nthe neighborhood where Davies preached, and occasionally accompanied his\r\nmother to hear him. His eloquence made a deep impression on young Henry,\r\nand he always spoke of Davies and Waddel as the greatest orators that he\r\nhad ever heard. Whether he ever heard Whitefield does not appear.\r\n\r\nIsaac Winston was one of the persons informed against in 1748 for\r\nallowing the Rev. John Roan to preach in his house. Two of the sisters\r\nof Patrick Henry--Lucy, who married Valentine Wood, and Jane, who\r\nmarried Colonel Samuel Meredith--were members of Davies' congregations.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen Patrick Henry was placed, about the year 1751, in\r\na store, to learn the mercantile business, and after a year so passed\r\nthe father set up William, an elder brother, and Patrick together in\r\ntrade. There is reason to believe that his alleged aversion to books and\r\nhis indolence, have been exaggerated by Wirt's artistic romancing. There\r\nis no royal road to learning; men do not acquire knowledge by intuition.\r\nAversion to study is by no means unusual among the young; nor is it\r\nprobable that Patrick Henry was much more averse to it than the\r\ngenerality of youth; indeed, his domestic educational advantages were\r\nuncommonly good, and the early development of his mind proves that he\r\ndid not neglect them. The mercantile adventure, after the experiment of\r\na year, proving a failure, William, who, it would appear, had less\r\nenergy than Patrick, retired from the concern, and the management was\r\ndevolved upon the younger brother. Patrick, disgusted with an\r\nunpromising business, listened impatiently to the hunter's horn, and the\r\ncry of hounds echoing in the neighboring woods. Debarred from these\r\ncongenial sports, he sought a resource in music, and learned to play\r\nnot unskilfully on the flute and the violin, the latter being the\r\nfavorite instrument in Virginia. He found another source of\r\nentertainment in the conversation of the country people who met at his\r\nstore, particularly on Saturday; and was fond of starting debates among\r\nthem, and observed the workings of their minds; and by stories, real or\r\nfictitious, studied how to move the passions at his will. Many country\r\nstorekeepers have done the same thing, but they were not Patrick Henrys.\r\nThat he employed part of his leisure in storing his mind with\r\ninformation from books, cannot be doubted. Behind the counter he could\r\ncon the news furnished by the _Virginia Gazette_, and he probably dipped\r\nsometimes into the _Gentleman's Magazine_. At the end of two or three\r\nyears, a too generous indulgence to his customers, and negligence in\r\nbusiness, together perhaps with the insuperable difficulties of the\r\nenterprise itself, in a period of war, disaster, and public distress,\r\nforced him to abandon his store almost in a state of insolvency. William\r\nHenry, the older brother, was then wild and dissipated; but became in\r\nafter-life a member of the assembly from the County of Fluvanna, enjoyed\r\nthe title of colonel, and had a competent estate. In the mean time\r\nPatrick had married the daughter of a poor but honest farmer of the\r\nneighborhood, named Shelton; and now by the joint assistance of his\r\nfather and his father-in-law, furnished with a small farm and one or two\r\nslaves, he undertook to support himself by agriculture. Yet, although he\r\ntilled the ground with his own hands, whether owing to his negligent,\r\nunsystematic habits, much insisted on by Wirt and others, or to the\r\nsterility of the soil, or to both, or to neither, after an experiment of\r\ntwo years he failed in this enterprise, as utterly as in the former. It\r\nwas a period of unexampled scarcity and distress in Virginia; and young\r\nHenry was suffering a reverse of fortune which befell many others at the\r\nsame time; and it would be, perhaps, unjust to attribute his failure\r\nexclusively or even mainly to his neglect or incompetency. However that\r\nmay be, selling his scanty property at a sacrifice for cash, for lack of\r\nmore profitable occupation he returned to merchandise. Still displaying\r\nindifference to the business of his store, he resumed his violin, his\r\nflute, his books, and his curious inspection of human nature; and\r\noccasionally shut up his store to indulge his favorite sports. He\r\nstudied geography, and became a proficient in it; he examined the\r\ncharters and perused the history of the colony, and pored over the\r\ntranslated annals of Greece and Rome. Livy became his favorite, and in\r\nhis early life he read it at least once in every year. Such a taste\r\nwould hardly have developed itself in one who had wasted his schoolboy\r\ndays in the torpor of indolence. It is true that Mr. Jefferson said of\r\nhim in after years, \"He was the hardest man to get to read a book that\r\nhe ever knew.\" Henry himself perhaps somewhat affected a distaste for\r\nbook-learning, in compliance with the vulgar prejudice; but he probably\r\nread much more than he got credit for. He did not, indeed, read a large\r\nnumber of books, as very few in Virginia did then; but he appears to\r\nhave read solid books, and to have read them thoroughly. He was fond of\r\nBritish history. Having himself a native touch of Cervantic humor, he\r\nwas not unacquainted with the inimitable romance of Don Quixote. But he\r\ndid not read books to talk about them. Soame Jenyns was a favorite. He\r\noften read Puffendorf, and Butler's Analogy was his standard volume\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\nHis second mercantile experiment turned out more unfortunate than the\r\nfirst, and left him again stranded on the shoals of bankruptcy. It was\r\nprobably an adventure which no attention or energy could have made\r\nsuccessful under the circumstances. These disappointments, made the more\r\ntrying by an early marriage, did not visibly depress his spirit: his\r\nmind rose superior to the vicissitudes of fortune. The golden ore was\r\npassing through the alembic of adversity. He lived now for some years\r\nwith his father-in-law, who was then keeping the tavern at Hanover\r\nCourt-house. When Mr. Shelton was occasionally absent, Mr. Henry\r\nsupplied his place and attended to the guests.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of the year 1760 Thomas Jefferson, then in his seventeenth\r\nyear, on his way to the College of William and Mary, spent the Christmas\r\nholidays at the seat of Colonel Dandridge, in Hanover County. Patrick\r\nHenry, now twenty-four years of age, being a near neighbor, young\r\nJefferson met with him there for the first time, and observed that his\r\nmanners had something of coarseness in them; that his passion was\r\nmusic, dancing, and pleasantry; and that in the last he excelled, and it\r\nattached everybody to him. But it is likely that the music of his voice\r\nwas more attractive than even that of his violin. Henry displayed on\r\nthat occasion, which was one of festivity, no uncommon calibre of\r\nintellect or extent of information; but his misfortunes were not to be\r\ntraced in his countenance or his conduct: self-possessed repose is the\r\ncharacteristic of native power; complaint is the language of weakness. A\r\nsecret consciousness of superior genius and a reliance upon Providence\r\nbuoyed him up in the reverses of fortune. While young Jefferson and\r\nHenry were enjoying together the Christmas holidays of 1760, how little\r\ndid either anticipate the parts which they were destined to perform on\r\nthe theatre of public life! Young Henry embraced the study of the law,\r\nand after a short course of reading, was, in consideration of his genius\r\nand general information, and in spite of his meagre knowledge of law,\r\nand his ungainly appearance, admitted to the bar in the spring of 1760.\r\nHis license was subscribed by Peyton and John Randolph and Robert C.\r\nNicholas. Mr. Wythe refused to sign it.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Parsons' Cause\" Henry emerged from the horizon, and thenceforth\r\nbecame the star of the ascendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[519:A] Lord Byron so calls him, in the Age of Bronze.\r\n\r\n[520:A] Several persons of the name of Winston came over from Yorkshire,\r\nEngland, and settled in Hanover. Isaac Winston, one of these, or a son\r\nof one of them, had children: 1. William, father of Judge Edmund\r\nWinston. 2. Sarah, mother of Patrick Henry, Jr., the orator. 3. Geddes.\r\n4. Mary, who married John Coles. 5. A daughter who married ---- Cole. She\r\nwas grandmother to Dorothea or Dolly Payne, who married James Madison,\r\nPresident of the United States. Of these five children, William, the\r\neldest, called Langaloo William, married Alice Taylor, of Caroline. He\r\nwas a great hunter; had a quarter in Bedford or Albemarle, where he\r\nspent much time in hunting deer. He was fond of the Indians, dressed in\r\ntheir costume, and was a favorite with them. He was also distinguished\r\nas an Indian-fighter. He is said to have been endowed with that rare\r\nkind of magnetic eloquence which rendered his nephew, Patrick Henry, so\r\nfamous. Indeed it was the opinion of some that he alone excelled him in\r\neloquence. During the French and Indian war, shortly after Braddock's\r\ndefeat, when the militia were marched to the frontier, this William\r\nWinston was a lieutenant of a company, which, being poorly clothed,\r\nwithout tents, and exposed to the rigors of an inclement season, became\r\nvery much dissatisfied, and were clamorous to return to their homes. At\r\nthis juncture, Lieutenant Winston, mounting a stump, made to them an\r\nappeal so patriotic and overpowering that when he concluded, the general\r\ncry was, \"Let us march on; lead us against the enemy!\" This maternal\r\nuncle of Patrick Henry, Jr., being so gifted with native eloquence, it\r\nmay be inferred that he derived his genius from his mother. William\r\nWinston's children were: 1. Elizabeth, who married Rev. Peter Fontaine.\r\n2. Fanny, who married Dr. Walker. 3. Edmund, the judge, who married,\r\nfirst, Sarah, daughter of Isaac Winston; second, the widow of Patrick\r\nHenry, the orator, (Dolly Dandridge that was.)\r\n\r\n[521:A] A copy of this rare map is in possession of Joseph Homer, Esq.,\r\nof Warrenton, Virginia. Appended to it is an epitome of the state and\r\ncondition of Virginia. The marginal illustration is profuse, and, like\r\nthe map, well executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\n1763.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Jonathan Boucher's Opinions on Slavery--Remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Rev. Jonathan Boucher, a minister of the established church, in a\r\nsermon preached at Bray's, in Leedstown, Hanover Parish, on occasion of\r\nthe general peace proclaimed in 1763, expressed himself on the subject\r\nof slavery as follows: \"The united motives of interest and humanity call\r\non us to bestow some consideration on the case of those sad outcasts of\r\nsociety, our negro slaves; for my heart would smite me were I not in\r\nthis hour of prosperity to entreat you (it being their unparalleled hard\r\nlot not to have the power of entreating for themselves) to permit them\r\nto participate in the general joy. Even those who are the sufferers can\r\nhardly be sorry when they see wrong measures carrying their punishment\r\nalong with them. Were an impartial and competent observer of the state\r\nof society in these middle colonies asked whence it happens that\r\nVirginia and Maryland--which were the first planted, and which are\r\nsuperior to many colonies, and inferior to none in point of natural\r\nadvantages--are still so exceedingly behind most of the other British\r\ntransatlantic possessions in all those improvements which bring credit\r\nand consequence to a country, he would answer, 'They are so because they\r\nare cultivated by slaves.' I believe it is capable of demonstration,\r\nthat except the immediate interest he has in the property of his slaves,\r\nit would be for every man's interest that there were no slaves, and for\r\nthis plain reason, because the free labor of a free man, who is\r\nregularly hired and paid for the work he does, and only for what he\r\ndoes, is in the end cheaper than the eye-service of a slave. Some loss\r\nand inconvenience would no doubt arise from the general abolition of\r\nslavery in these colonies, but were it done gradually, with judgment and\r\nwith good temper, I have never yet seen it satisfactorily proved that\r\nsuch inconvenience would be either great or lasting. North American or\r\nWest Indian planters might possibly for a few years make less tobacco,\r\nor less rice, or less sugar, the raising of which might also cost them\r\nmore; but that disadvantage would probably soon be amply compensated to\r\nthem by an advanced price, or (what is the same thing) by the reduced\r\nexpense of cultivation. * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"I do you no more than justice in bearing witness that in no part of the\r\nworld were slaves ever better treated than, in general, they are in\r\nthese colonies. That there are exceptions needs not to be concealed: in\r\nall countries there are bad men. And shame be to those men who, though\r\nthemselves blessed with freedom, have minds less liberal than the poor\r\ncreatures over whom they so meanly tyrannize! Even your humanity,\r\nhowever, falls short of their exigencies. In one essential point I fear\r\nwe are all deficient: they are nowhere sufficiently instructed. I am far\r\nfrom recommending it to you at once to set them all free, because to do\r\nso would be a heavy loss to you and probably no gain to them; but I do\r\nentreat you to make them some amends for the drudgery of their bodies by\r\ncultivating their minds. By such means only can we hope to fulfil the\r\nends which we may be permitted to believe Providence had in view in\r\nsuffering them to be brought among us. You may unfetter them from the\r\nchains of ignorance, you may emancipate them from the bondage of\r\nsin--the worst slavery to which they can be subjected--and by thus\r\nsetting at liberty those that are bruised, though they still continue to\r\nbe your slaves, they shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption\r\ninto the glorious liberty of the children of God.\"[527:A]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Jonathan Boucher, was born in Cumberland County, England, in\r\n1738, and brought up at Wigton Grammar School. He came over to Virginia\r\nat the age of sixteen, and was nominated by the vestry of Hanover\r\nParish, in the County of King George, before he was in orders. Returning\r\nto England for ordination, he recrossed the Atlantic, and entered upon\r\nthe duties of that parish on the banks of the Rappahannock. He removed\r\nsoon afterwards to St. Mary's Parish, in Caroline County, upon the same\r\nriver. After remaining here a good many years and enjoying the esteem\r\nof his people, he removed to Maryland, and was there ejected from his\r\nrectory at the breaking out of the Revolution, when he returned to\r\nEngland. His Discourses, preached between 1763 and 1775, were published\r\nby him when he was Vicar of Epsom, in Surrey, in 1797.\r\n\r\nAbraham, the father of the faithful, was a slaveholder; upon his death\r\nhis servants passed by descent to his son Isaac, as in like manner those\r\nof Isaac descended to Jacob. They were hereditary bondsmen, and, like\r\nchattels, bought and sold. Job, a pattern of piety, was a slaveholder,\r\nand, like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, won no small portion of his claims\r\nto a character of high and exemplary virtue from the manner in which he\r\ndischarged his duty to his slaves.\r\n\r\nThe master who faithfully performs his duties toward his slaves is a\r\nhigh example of virtue, and the slave who renders his service faithfully\r\nis worthy of equal commendation. If the rights of the slave are narrow,\r\nhis duties are proportionally limited.\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery, divinely appointed, was maintained for five\r\nhundred years in Abraham's family. When the patriarchal dispensation\r\ncame to an end, the right of property in slaves was recognized in the\r\ndecalogue. The system was incorporated into the Mosaic law, and so\r\ncontinued to the end of the Jewish dispensation, and was nowhere\r\ndenounced as a moral evil, nor was any reproof uttered by the prophets\r\nagainst the system on account of the evils connected with it.\r\n\r\nThe primitive Christian church consisted largely of slaveholders and\r\nslaves, and the slavery of the Roman empire, in which the early churches\r\nwere planted, corresponded with that of Virginia, and where it differed,\r\nit was worse. The relation of master and servant is placed by the\r\napostles upon the same footing as that of parent and child, and of\r\nhusband and wife.[528:A] It is enjoined upon servants to be obedient to\r\ntheir masters, whether \"good and gentle, or froward.\" Christian servants\r\nwere commanded to obey their masters, whether heathens or believers; and\r\nChristians, to withdraw themselves from any, who, rejecting divine\r\nauthority, should teach a contrary doctrine.[528:B]\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament no censure is cast upon the institution of\r\nslavery, no master is denounced for holding slaves, nor advised to\r\nemancipate them. The evils incidental to the relation of master and\r\nslave are, in kind, like those incidental to the other domestic\r\nrelations, and do not render the one unlawful or sinful any more than\r\nthe others. The evils of slavery are not in the relation, but in the\r\nparties to it; therefore the abolition of the relation (the whites and\r\nthe blacks still continuing together) would not extinguish the evils,\r\nbut only change them, and a new relation would be substituted, fraught\r\nwith still greater evils. The two races, separated by a barrier of\r\nnatural incompatibility, cannot coalesce, nor can they coexist on equal\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe evils connected with slavery are, like others, to be remedied by the\r\nreforming influence of Christianity. Slavery originated in a curse, but\r\nout of it Providence has mysteriously educed a blessing, as from\r\npoisonous flowers honey is extracted by the bee.[529:A]\r\n\r\nThe religious instruction of the slaves in Virginia was, with some\r\nhonorable exceptions, too generally neglected by the ministers of the\r\nestablished church. The churches afforded but little room or\r\naccommodation for the negroes, and the difficulties in the way of\r\nimparting instruction to them were no doubt great, yet by no means\r\ninsuperable. The Rev. Samuel Davies appears to have labored more\r\nsuccessfully for their benefit than any other minister in Virginia,\r\neither before his time or since. The Rev. Mr. Wright, co-operating with\r\nhim in this work, established Sunday-schools, for the instruction of\r\nnegroes, in the County of Cumberland, in the year 1756.[529:B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[527:A] Anderson's Hist. of Church of England in the Colonies, second\r\ned., iii. 159.\r\n\r\n[528:A] Ephesians, vi.; Colossians, iii., iv.\r\n\r\n[528:B] 1 Timothy, vi.\r\n\r\n[529:A] Brief Examination of Scripture Testimony on the Institution of\r\nSlavery, by the Rev.

Hitherto, from the first settlement of the\r\ncolonies, Great Britain, without seeking a direct revenue from them,\r\nwith perhaps some inconsiderable exceptions, had been satisfied with the\r\nappointment of their principal officers, and a monopoly of their trade.\r\nNow, when the colonies had grown more capable of resisting impositions,\r\nthe mother country rose in her demands. Thus it was that disputes\r\nbetween Great Britain and the colonies, commencing in 1764 and lasting\r\nabout twelve years, brought on the war of the Revolution, and ended in a\r\ndisruption of the empire. This result, inevitable sooner or later in the\r\nnatural course of events, was only precipitated by the impolitic and\r\narbitrary measures of the British government. In the general loyalty of\r\nthe colonies, new commercial restrictions, although involving a heavy\r\nindirect taxation, would probably have been submitted to for many years\r\nlonger; but the novel scheme of direct taxation, without their consent,\r\nwas reprobated as contrary to their natural and chartered rights; and a\r\nflame of discontent, bursting forth here and there, finally overspread\r\nthe whole country.\r\n\r\nThere appears, indeed, to have been no essential difference between\r\ninternal and external taxation; for it was still taxation; and taxation\r\nwithout representation. But the internal or direct taxation was new,\r\nobvious, and more offensive. The restrictions of the navigation act,\r\nvehemently resisted at their first enactment, and not less so in\r\nVirginia and other Southern colonies than in the North, had never been\r\nacquiesced in, but only submitted to from necessity; and long eluded\r\nnot only by New England, but also by other colonies, by a trade\r\noriginally contraband, indeed, but which had lost much of its\r\nillegitimate character by immemorial usage, and had acquired a sort of\r\nprescriptive right by that consent on the part of the British government\r\nwhich was to be inferred from its apparent acquiescence in the\r\nviolation. For a hundred years preceding the Revolution the commerce of\r\nthe colonies may be said to have been in the main practically free, as\r\nGreat Britain was able to furnish the manufactures which the colony\r\nneeded. But now the mother country undertook to enforce the obsolete\r\nnavigation act and her revenue laws with a new vigor, which was not\r\nconfined to the American colonies, but embraced the whole British\r\nempire. As applied to the colonies the measure was equally impolitic and\r\nunjust: impolitic, because by breaking up the colonial trade with the\r\nWest Indies, England crippled her own customer; unjust, because this\r\ntrade had grown up by the tacit consent of the government, and a\r\ndissolution of it would be ruinous to the commercial colonies. Besides\r\nthese new restraints upon commerce, parliament had long endeavored to\r\nrestrict colonial industry; and although these restrictions fell most\r\nheavily on the Northern colonies, their injurious effects were felt by\r\nall of them. As far back as the time of Bacon's rebellion, a patriotic\r\nwoman of the colony congratulated her friends that now \"Virginia can\r\nbuild ships, and, like New England, trade to any part of the world.\" And\r\nthe parenthesis of religious liberty and free trade enjoyed by Virginia\r\nunder Cromwell was never forgotten. But, inasmuch as these restrictions\r\nfell more heavily on the North than on the South, so the co-operation of\r\nthe South was the more meritorious as being more disinterested. And the\r\noppressions of Great Britain must have been intolerable, when,\r\nnotwithstanding all the differences of opinion and of institutions, the\r\nthirteen colonies became united in a compact phalanx of\r\nresistance.[531:A]\r\n\r\nThe recent war had inspired the provincial troops with more confidence\r\nin themselves, and had rendered the British regulars less formidable in\r\ntheir eyes. Everything unknown is magnificent.\r\n\r\nThe success of the allied arms had put an end to the dependency of the\r\ncolonies upon the mother country for protection against the French. In\r\nseveral of the provinces Germans, Dutch, Swedes, and Frenchmen were\r\nfound commingled with the Anglican population. Great Britain, by long\r\nwars ably conducted during Pitt's administration, had acquired glory and\r\nan extension of empire; but, in the mean time, she had incurred an\r\nenormous debt. The British officers, entertained with a hospitality in\r\nAmerica, carried back to England exaggerated reports of the wealth of\r\nthe colonies. The colonial governors and the British ministry had often\r\nbeen thwarted and annoyed by the republican and independent, and\r\nsometimes factious spirit, of the colonial assemblies, and longed to see\r\nthem curbed. The British merchants complained to the government of the\r\nheavy losses entailed upon them by the depreciated colonial paper\r\ncurrency. The Church of England was indignant at the violent opposition\r\nto the introduction of bishops into the colonies, at the decision of the\r\n\"Parsons' Cause,\" and other provocations and indignities. The advice of\r\nmany governors and military officers had deeply impressed the government\r\nwith the necessity of laying direct taxes as the only means of retaining\r\nthe control of the colonies. The British administration, in the first\r\nyears of the reign of George the Third, was in the hands of a corrupt\r\noligarchy, and the ministers determined to lessen the burden at home by\r\nlevying a direct tax upon the colonies. The loyalty of the Americans had\r\nnever been warmer than at the close of the war. They had expended their\r\ntreasure and their blood freely; and the recollection of mutual\r\nsufferings and a common glory strengthened their attachment to the\r\nmother country; but these loyal sentiments were destined soon to wither\r\nand expire. The colonies, too, had involved themselves in a heavy debt.\r\nWithin three years, intervening between 1756 and 1759, parliament had\r\ngranted them a large amount of money to encourage their efforts; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding that and the extraordinary supplies appropriated by the\r\nassemblies, a heavy debt still remained unliquidated. When, therefore,\r\nparliament in a few years thereafter undertook to extort money by a\r\ndirect tax from provinces to which she had recently granted incomparably\r\nlarger sums, it was conceived that the object of the minister, in this\r\ninnovation, was not simply to raise the inconsiderable amount of the\r\ntax, but to establish gradually a new and absolute system of \"taxation\r\nwithout representation.\" It was easy to foresee that it would be made\r\nthe instrument of unlimited extortions, and would extinguish the\r\npractical legislative independence of the Anglo-American colonies.\r\nNeither the English parliament, nor those who were represented by the\r\nlords and commons, would pay a farthing of the tax which they imposed on\r\nthe colonies. On the contrary, their property would have been exempted\r\nin exact proportion to the burdens laid on the colonies. Taxes without\r\nreason or necessity, and oppressions without end, would have ensued from\r\nsubmitting to the usurpation.[533:A]\r\n\r\nAfter war had raged for nearly eight years, peace was concluded at\r\nParis, in February, 1763, by which France ceded Canada, and Spain the\r\nFloridas, to Great Britain. On this occasion the territory of Virginia\r\nwas again reduced in extent. The conquests, and the culminating power,\r\nand the arrogant pretensions of the proud island of Great Britain\r\nexcited the jealousy and the fears of Europe; while in England the\r\nadministration had engendered a formidable opposition at home. In the\r\nyear 1763 the national debt had accumulated to an enormous amount; for\r\nwhich an annual interest of twenty-two millions of dollars was paid. The\r\nminister proposed to levy upon the colonies part of this sum, alleging\r\nthat as the recent war had been waged partly on their account, it was\r\nbut fair that they should contribute a share of the expense; and the\r\nright was claimed for parliament, according to the British constitution,\r\nto tax every portion of the empire. The absolute right of legislating\r\nfor the colonies had long, if not always, been claimed, theoretically,\r\nby England; but she had never exerted it in practice to any sensible\r\nextent in the essential article of taxation. The inhabitants of the\r\ncolonies admitted their obligation to share the expense of the war, but\r\ninsisted that the necessary revenue could be legitimately levied only by\r\ntheir own legislatures; that taxation and representation were\r\ninseparable; and that remote colonies not represented in parliament were\r\nentitled to tax themselves. The justice of parliament would prove a\r\nfeeble barrier against the demands of avarice; and as in England the\r\nprivilege of granting money was the palladium of the people's liberty\r\nagainst the encroachment of the crown, so the same right was the proper\r\nsafeguard of the colonies against the tyranny of the imperial\r\ngovernment. Such were the views of American patriots; yet it was a\r\nsubject on which wise and good men might differ in Great Britain and in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of the Rev. William Yates, in 1764, the Rev. James\r\nHorrocks succeeded him as President of the College of William and Mary.\r\nAbout the same time the Rev. William Robinson, commissary, dying, Mr.\r\nHorrocks succeeded him in that place. Rev. John Camm, who aspired to the\r\noffice, was disappointed in it owing to some difficulty with Governor\r\nDinwiddie.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1764, parliament passed resolutions declaratory of an\r\nintention to impose a stamp-duty in America, and avowing the right and\r\nexpediency of taxing the colonies. This was the immediate fountain-head\r\nof the Revolution. These resolutions gave great dissatisfaction in\r\nAmerica; but were popular in England, where the prospect of lightening\r\ntheir own burdens at the expense of the colonists recommended them to\r\nthe English taxpayers. The resolutions met with no overt opposition, but\r\nthe public discontents were increased when it came to be known that\r\nlarge bodies of British soldiers were to be sent over and quartered in\r\nthe colonies.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, during the year, removed from Hanover to Louisa, where he\r\nsoon endeared himself to the people, although he never courted their\r\nfavor by flattery. He sometimes hunted deer for several days together,\r\ncarrying his provision with him, and at night camping out in the woods.\r\nHe was known to enter Louisa court in a coarse cloth coat, stained with\r\nthe blood of the deer, greasy leather breeches, with leggings for boots,\r\nand a pair of saddle-bags on his arm.[534:A]\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1764 there occurred in the house of burgesses a case of\r\ncontested election, the parties being James Littlepage, the member\r\nreturned for the County of Hanover, and the other candidate, Nathaniel\r\nWest Dandridge. Mr. Littlepage was charged with bribery and corruption.\r\nThe case was tried before the committee of privileges and elections, and\r\nMr. Henry appeared as attorney for Mr. Dandridge. Mr. Henry was coarsely\r\ndressed and quite unknown, yet retained his self-possession in spite of\r\nthe supercilious smiles of aristocracy. The right of suffrage and the\r\npurity of the elective franchise afforded him a theme for a speech which\r\nastonished the audience; and Judge Winston pronounced the argument\r\n\"superior to anything he had ever heard.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker of the house, John Robinson, had held that post for a\r\nquarter of a century, and combining with it the office of treasurer, his\r\ninfluence was wide and well established. His personal popularity was\r\ngreat, and embraced men of all classes. His strong and cultivated mind\r\nwas set off by polished manners; his presence, imposing and commanding.\r\n\r\nPeyton Randolph, the king's attorney-general, in influence second only\r\nto the speaker, was discreet and dignified; thoroughly versed in\r\nlegislative proceedings; of excellent judgment, yet without\r\nextraordinary genius; a sound lawyer; in politics conservative;\r\nintolerant to dissenters.\r\n\r\nRichard Bland was enlightened and laborious, a profound reasoner, an\r\nungraceful speaker, but an excellent writer; a wise but over-cautious\r\nstatesman, like Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, marching up with fearless\r\nlogic to his conclusions, but pausing there, unwilling to carry them\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nEdmund Pendleton was the grandson of Philip Pendleton, a teacher, who\r\ncame over to Virginia about the year 1674 with his brother, Nathaniel, a\r\nminister. Philip Pendleton's eldest son, at the age of eighteen, married\r\nMary Taylor, aged only thirteen, and Edmund was the fourth son of this\r\nunion. From a sister was descended General Edmund Pendleton Gaines, of\r\nthe United States army. Edmund Pendleton was born (his father dying\r\nbefore his birth) in 1721, in Caroline County. Left poor and without any\r\nclassical education, it is said that after ploughing all day he pursued\r\nhis studies at night. Placed in his fourteenth year in the office of\r\nColonel Benjamin Robinson, (brother of the speaker,) clerk of the county\r\ncourt of Caroline, he became acquainted with legal forms. He could\r\nhardly have spent much time in ploughing before his fourteenth year. At\r\nthe age of sixteen he was appointed clerk to the vestry of St. Mary's\r\nParish; and the salary derived from that petty office he expended in the\r\npurchase of books, which he diligently read. In his twentieth year he\r\nwas licensed to practise the law, after having been strictly examined by\r\nthe eminent lawyer Barradall. About the same time young Pendleton was\r\nmade clerk of the county court martial. Before he was of age he married,\r\nin opposition to the advice of his friends, Betty Roy, remarkable for\r\nher beauty. Upon being licensed he soon acquired a large practice. His\r\nwife dying in less than two years after the marriage, in his\r\ntwenty-fourth year he married Sarah Pollard. He now began to practise in\r\nthe general court. In the year 1752 he was elected one of the\r\nrepresentatives of Caroline, and so continued down to the time of the\r\nRevolution. Mr. Wirt says that he was a protégé of Speaker Robinson, who\r\nintroduced him into the circle of refined society. Mr. Grigsby thinks\r\nthat the term protégé was inapplicable to him, as he was the architect\r\nof his own fortune. It is certain that Speaker Robinson found in him his\r\nablest supporter in the question of separating the offices of speaker\r\nand treasurer. Mr. Pendleton became the leader of the conservative\r\nparty, who, while they wished to effect a redress of grievances, were\r\nopposed to a revolution of the government, and who stood out against it\r\nuntil opposition became unavailing. Nevertheless, by his integrity, the\r\ncharm of his manners, and his great abilities, he attained and filled\r\nwith honor several of the highest posts. As a lawyer, debater,\r\nstatesman, he was of the highest order in the colony; yet he read little\r\nbesides law, and was without taste for literature. The report of a law\r\ncase had for him the charm which a novel has for others. As a writer he\r\nwas unskilled, and quite devoid of the graces of style and rhythm. His\r\nvoice was melodious, and his articulation distinct; his elocution\r\ngraceful and effective; with a serene self-possession that nothing could\r\ndisturb, he was ever ready to seize every advantage that occurred in\r\ndebate; but he could lay no claim to the lofty powers which \"shake the\r\nhuman soul.\" Although a new man, he was, as often happens, behind none\r\nin his extreme conservative views in church and state. In a brief\r\nautobiography, he says of himself: \"Without any classical education,\r\nwithout patrimony, without what is called the influence of family\r\nconnection, and without solicitation, I have attained the highest\r\noffices of my country. I have often contemplated it as a rare and\r\nextraordinary instance, and pathetically exclaimed, 'Not unto me, not\r\nunto me, O Lord, but unto thy name be the praise!'\"[537:A]\r\n\r\nGeorge Wythe was born in Elizabeth City, (1726,) his father having been\r\na burgess from that county. George, on the side of his mother's family,\r\nnamed Keith, inherited a taste for letters. After studying the law,\r\nhaving come into possession of a competent estate, he wasted several\r\nyears in indolence and dissipation; but he afterwards became a close\r\nstudent, having imbibed a taste for learning from the society of\r\nGovernor Fauquier and Professor Small. He became accomplished in classic\r\nliterature, and profoundly versed in the law. He is described as having\r\nbeen simple and artless, incapable of the little crooked wisdom of\r\ncunning, and his integrity was incorruptible.\r\n\r\nRichard Henry Lee was distinguished by a face of the Roman order: his\r\nforehead high but not wide, his head leaning gracefully forward; his\r\nperson and face fine. He was an accomplished scholar, of wide reading.\r\nHis voice was musical. He had lost the use of one hand by an accident,\r\nand kept it covered with a bandage of black silk; but his gesture was\r\ngraceful. His style of eloquence was chaste, classic, electric, and\r\ndelightful. As Mr. Jefferson has said that Patrick Henry spoke as Homer\r\nwrote, so Mr. Lee may be, perhaps, compared to Virgil. Henry and Lee\r\ncoincided in political views, co-operated in public life, and were\r\nconfidential correspondents and warm and constant friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[531:A] Sabine's Loyalists, 36.\r\n\r\n[533:A] Letter from R.

The bill, warmly\r\ndebated in that house, but carried by a vote of five to one, met with no\r\nopposition in the house of lords, and on the twenty-second of March\r\nreceived the royal sanction. At first it was taken for granted that the\r\nact would be enforced. It was not to take effect till the first day of\r\nNovember, more than seven months from its passage. The Virginians were a\r\nproud race, the more jealous of their liberties, having, like the\r\nSpartans, the degradation of slavery continually in their view,\r\nimpatient of restraint, and unwilling to succumb to the control of any\r\nsuperior power, \"snuffing the tainted breeze of tyranny afar.\" Many of\r\nthem even affected to consider the colonies as independent states, only\r\nlinked to Great Britain as owing allegiance to a common crown, and as\r\nbound to her by natural affection.\r\n\r\nThe assembly met on the 1st day of May, 1765. Patrick Henry took his\r\nseat in it on the twentieth. Notwithstanding the opposition of the\r\npeople to the stamp act, yet the place-men, the large landed\r\nproprietors, who were the professed adherents of government, still held\r\nthe control of the legislature. Disgusted by the delays and sophistries\r\nof this class during the preceding session, one of the Johnsons, two\r\nbrothers that represented Louisa County, declared his intention to\r\nbring into the house Patrick Henry, who was equally distinguished by his\r\neloquence and by an opposition to the claims of parliament, verging on\r\nsedition. Johnson accordingly, by accepting the office of coroner,\r\nvacated his seat in favor of Henry, who thus came to be one of the\r\nrepresentatives of that frontier county in the assembly of 1765--an\r\nincident connected with events of transcendent importance.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth, Peyton Randolph reported to the house, from the\r\ncommittee of the whole, a scheme for the establishment of a loan-office\r\nor bank. The plan was to borrow £240,000 sterling from British\r\nmerchants, at an interest of five per cent.; a fund for paying the\r\ninterest and sinking the principal to be raised by an impost duty on\r\ntobacco; bills of exchange to be drawn for £100,000, with which the\r\npaper money in circulation was to be redeemed, the remaining £140,000 to\r\nbe imported in specie, and deposited here for a stock whereon to\r\ncirculate bank notes, to be lent out on permanent security, at an\r\ninterest of five per cent., to be paid yearly, a proportion of the\r\nprincipal at the end of four years, another proportion at the end of\r\nfive years, and afterwards by equal payments once in four years, until\r\nthe whole should be repaid.\r\n\r\nWhen it was urged in favor of this scheme, that from the distressed\r\ncondition of the colony, men of fortune had contracted debts, which, if\r\nexacted suddenly, must ruin them, but which, with a little indulgence,\r\nmight be liquidated, Mr. Henry exclaimed: \"What, sir! is it proposed\r\nthen to reclaim the spendthrift from his dissipation and extravagance by\r\nfilling his pockets with money?\" Thomas Jefferson, then a law-student at\r\nWilliamsburg, was present during this debate, and the manner in which\r\nHenry uttered this sentence was indelibly impressed on his memory.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions embodying this scheme were passed by the house, and a\r\ncommittee of conference was appointed at the same time, and before the\r\nvote upon them was taken in the council. In this conference the managers\r\non the part of the house were Edmund Pendleton, Mr. Archibald Cary, Mr.\r\nBenjamin Harrison, Mr. Burwell, Mr. Braxton, and Mr. Fleming. The\r\ncouncil[540:A] refused to concur in the scheme. Had it been carried into\r\neffect, the indebtedness of Virginia at the eve of the Revolution would\r\nhave probably been greatly augmented.\r\n\r\nVirginia led the way in opposing the stamp act. On the 30th of May,\r\n1765, near the close of the session, Patrick Henry offered the following\r\nresolutions:--\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That the first adventurers and settlers of this his\r\n     majesty's colony and dominion, brought with them, and\r\n     transmitted to their posterity and all other his majesty's\r\n     subjects since inhabiting in this his majesty's said colony,\r\n     all the privileges, franchises, and immunities that have at\r\n     any time been held, enjoyed, and possessed by the people of\r\n     Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That by two royal charters granted by King James\r\n     the First, the colonists aforesaid are declared entitled to\r\n     all the privileges, liberties, and immunities of denizens and\r\n     natural-born subjects, to all intents and purposes as if they\r\n     had been abiding and born within the realm of England.\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That the taxation of the people by themselves, or\r\n     by persons chosen by themselves to represent them, who can\r\n     only know what taxes the people are able to bear, and the\r\n     easiest mode of raising them, and are equally affected by such\r\n     taxes themselves, is the distinguishing characteristic of\r\n     British freedom, and without which the ancient constitution\r\n     cannot subsist.\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That his majesty's liege people of this most\r\n     ancient colony have uninterruptedly enjoyed the right of being\r\n     thus governed by their own assembly in the article of their\r\n     taxes and internal police, and that the same hath never\r\n     been forfeited, or any other way given up, but hath been\r\n     constantly recognized by the king and people of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, Therefore, that the general assembly of this colony\r\n     have the sole right and power to lay taxes and impositions\r\n     upon the inhabitants of this colony, and that every attempt to\r\n     vest such power in any person or persons whatsoever other than\r\n     the general assembly aforesaid, has a manifest tendency to\r\n     destroy British as well as American freedom.\"[541:A]\r\n\r\nMr. Henry was young, being about twenty-eight years of age, and a new\r\nmember; but finding the men of weight in the house averse to opposition,\r\nand the stamp act about to take effect, and no person likely to step\r\nforth, alone, unadvised, and unassisted, he wrote these resolutions on a\r\nblank leaf of an old law book, \"Coke upon Littleton.\" Before offering\r\nthem, he showed them to two members, John Fleming, of Goochland, and\r\nGeorge Johnson, of Fairfax. Mr. Johnson seconded the resolutions.\r\nSpeaker Robinson objected to them as inflammatory. The first three\r\nappear to have passed by small majorities, without alteration. The\r\nfourth was passed amended, so as to read as follows: \"Resolved, That his\r\nmajesty's liege people of this his most ancient and loyal colony have,\r\nwithout interruption, enjoyed the inestimable right of being governed by\r\nsuch laws respecting their internal polity and taxation as are derived\r\nfrom their own consent, with the approbation of their sovereign or his\r\nsubstitute, and that the same hath never been forfeited or yielded up,\r\nbut hath been constantly recognized by the king and people of Great\r\nBritain.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the five resolutions was carried by a majority of only one\r\nvote, being twenty to nineteen, and the debate on it, in the language of\r\nMr. Jefferson, was \"most bloody.\" Speaker Robinson, Peyton Randolph,\r\nattorney-general, Richard Bland, Edmund Pendleton, George Wythe, and all\r\nthe old leaders of the house and proprietors of large estates, made a\r\nstrenuous resistance. Mr. Jefferson says the resolutions of Henry \"were\r\nopposed by Robinson and all the cyphers of the aristocracy.\" John\r\nRandolph resisted them with all his might. How Washington voted is not\r\nknown, the yeas and nays never being recorded on the journal in that\r\nage. He considered the stamp act ill-judged and unconstitutional, and\r\nwas of opinion that it could not be enforced. Mr. Henry was ably\r\nsupported in a logical argument by Mr. George Johnson, a lawyer of\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this stormy debate many threats were uttered by the\r\nparty for submission, and much abuse heaped upon Mr. Henry, but he\r\ncarried the young members with him. Jefferson, then a student of William\r\nand Mary, standing at the door of the house, overheard the debate. After\r\nSpeaker Robinson had declared the result of the vote, Peyton Randolph,\r\nas he entered the lobby near Jefferson, exclaimed with an oath, \"I would\r\nhave given five hundred guineas for a single vote!\" One more vote would\r\nhave defeated the last resolution.[542:A]\r\n\r\nScarce a vestige of this speech of Henry survives. Mr. Jefferson\r\ndeclared that he never heard such eloquence from any other man. While\r\nMr. Henry was inveighing against the stamp act, he exclaimed: \"Tarquin\r\nand Cæsar had each his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and\r\nGeorge the Third\"--(\"Treason!\" cried the speaker; \"Treason! Treason!\"\r\nresounded from every part of the house. Henry, rising to a loftier\r\nattitude, with unfaltering voice, and unwavering eye fixed on the\r\nspeaker, finished the sentence,)--\"may profit by the example. If this be\r\ntreason, make the most of it.\" Henry was now the leading man in\r\nVirginia, and his resolutions gave the impulse to the other colonies,\r\nand the spirit of resistance spread rapidly through them, gathering\r\nstrength as it proceeded. On the afternoon of the same day Mr. Henry\r\nleft Williamsburg, passing along Duke of Gloucester Street, on his way\r\nto his home in Louisa, wearing buckskin breeches, his saddle-bags on his\r\narm, leading a lean horse, and chatting with Paul Carrington, who walked\r\nby his side.\r\n\r\nYoung Jefferson happened on the following morning to be in the hall of\r\nthe burgesses before the meeting of the house, and he observed Colonel\r\nPeter Randolph, one of the council, sitting at the clerk's table\r\nexamining the journals, to find a precedent for expunging a vote of the\r\nhouse. Part of the burgesses having gone home, and some of the more\r\ntimid of those who had voted for the strongest resolution having become\r\nalarmed, as soon as the house met, a motion was made and carried to\r\nexpunge the last resolution from the journals. The manuscript journal of\r\nthat day disappeared shortly after and has never been found.[543:A] The\r\nfour remaining on the journal and the two additional ones offered in\r\ncommittee, but not reported, were published in the _Gazette_. On the\r\nfirst of June the governor dissolved the assembly.\r\n\r\nAt the instance of Massachusetts, guided by the advice of James Otis, a\r\ncongress met in October, 1765, at New York. The assemblies of Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, and Georgia were prevented by their governors from\r\nsending deputies. The congress made a declaration denying the right of\r\nparliament to tax the colonies, and concurred in petitions to the king\r\nand the commons and a memorial to the lords. Virginia and the other two\r\ncolonies not represented forwarded petitions accordant with those\r\nadopted by the congress. The committee appointed by the Virginia\r\nassembly to draught the petitions consisted of Peyton Randolph, Richard\r\nHenry Lee, Landon Carter, George Wythe, Edmund Pendleton, Benjamin\r\nHarrison, Richard Bland, Archibald Cary, and Mr. Fleming. The address to\r\nthe king was written by Peyton Randolph, the address to the commons by\r\nGeorge Wythe, and the memorial to the lords was attributed to Richard\r\nBland.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the stamp act now blazed forth everywhere; and it was\r\ndisregarded and defied. In the last week of October, George Mercer,\r\ndistributor of stamps for Virginia, landed at Hampton, and was rudely\r\ntreated by the mob, who, by the interposition of some influential\r\ngentlemen, were prevailed on to disperse without offering him any\r\npersonal injury. At Williamsburg, as he was walking toward the capitol,\r\non his way to the governor's palace, he was required by several\r\ngentlemen from different counties, the general court being in session,\r\nto say whether he intended to enter on the duties of the office. At his\r\nrequest he was allowed to wait on the governor before replying, and he\r\nwas accompanied to the coffee-house where the governor, most of the\r\ncouncil, and many gentlemen were assembled. The crowd increasing and\r\ngrowing impatient in their demands, Mr. Mercer came forward and promised\r\nto give a categorical answer at five o'clock the next evening. At that\r\ntime he met a large concourse of people, including the principal\r\nmerchants of the colony. He then engaged not to undertake the execution\r\nof the stamp act until he received further orders from England, nor\r\nthen, without the assent of the assembly of Virginia. He was immediately\r\nborne out of the capitol gate, amid loud acclamations, and carried to\r\nthe coffee-house, where an elegant entertainment was prepared for him,\r\nand was welcomed there by renewed acclamations, drums beating, and\r\nFrench-horns and other musical instruments sounding. At night the bells\r\nwere set a-ringing, and the town was illuminated. Mr. Mercer was, in\r\n1769, appointed lieutenant-governor of North Carolina.[544:A]\r\n\r\nThe colonists began to betake themselves to domestic manufactures; and\r\nforeign luxuries were laid aside. In the mean while a change had taken\r\nplace in the British ministry; the stamp act was reconsidered in\r\nparliament; Dr. Franklin was examined at the bar of the house of\r\ncommons. Lord Camden, in the house of lords, and Mr. Pitt, in the\r\ncommons, favored a repeal of the act; and, after providing for the\r\ndependence of America on Great Britain, parliament repealed the stamp\r\nact in March, 1766. On the second day of May news of the repeal reached\r\nWilliamsburg by the ship Lord Baltimore, arrived in York River, from\r\nLondon. The joyful intelligence was celebrated at Norfolk; and at\r\nWilliamsburg by a ball and illumination.\r\n\r\nAt the session of November, 1766, Mr. John Robinson, who had for many\r\nyears held the offices of speaker and treasurer, being now dead, an\r\ninvestigation of his accounts exposed an enormous defalcation. A motion\r\nto separate the offices, brought forward by Richard Henry Lee, and\r\nsupported by Mr. Henry, proved successful. Edmund Pendleton was at the\r\nhead of the party that resisted it.[545:A]\r\n\r\nMr. Lee on this occasion pursued his course in opposition to the\r\nconfederacy of the great in place, the influence of family connections,\r\nand that still more dangerous foe to public virtue, private friendship.\r\nThe contest appears to have been bitter, and it engendered animosities\r\nwhich survived the lapse of years and the absorbing scenes of the\r\noutbreaking Revolution.\r\n\r\nA fragment of the speech delivered by Mr. Lee on this occasion has been\r\npreserved.[545:B] After supporting his views by historical examples, he\r\nremarks: \"If, then, wise and good men in all ages have deemed it for the\r\nsecurity of liberty to divide places of power and profit; if this maxim\r\nhas not been departed from without either injury or destroying\r\nfreedom--as happened to Rome with her decemvirs and her dictator--why\r\nshould Virginia so early quit the paths of wisdom, and seal her own\r\nruin, as far as she can do it, by uniting in one person the only two\r\ngreat places in the power of her assembly to bestow?\" The fragment of\r\nthis speech ends just where Mr. Lee was about to combat the arguments in\r\nsupport of the union of the two offices. Among these arguments were,\r\nthat innovation is dangerous; that the additional office of treasurer\r\nwas necessary to give the speaker that pre-eminence that is befitting\r\nhis station; that the parliamentary powers of the speaker give the chair\r\nno influence, as in the exercise thereof in pleasing one he may offend a\r\ndozen; that a separation of the offices might induce the government at\r\nhome to take the appointment out of their hands altogether; and that the\r\nsupport of the dignity of the chair necessarily involved a great\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been difficult to refute these arguments. The\r\ncombination of the offices of speaker and treasurer was itself an\r\ninnovation of as recent date as 1738. The speaker of the English house\r\nof commons did not find the office of treasurer necessary to maintain\r\nhis dignity. If the office of speaker of itself gave no influence, why\r\nhad it been always sought for? Nor could the separation of the offices\r\ninduce the home government to take the appointments from the assembly,\r\nfor that separation was itself virtually a government measure. Chalmers,\r\nwho was well versed in the documentary history of the colonies, says:\r\n\"Too attentive to overlook the dangerous pre-eminence of Robinson, the\r\nboard of trade took this opportunity to enjoin [1758] the new\r\ngovernor[546:A] to use every rational endeavor to procure a separation\r\nof the conjoined offices which he improperly held.\"[546:B] Lee, Henry,\r\nand others, who voted for the separation, were in effect carrying out\r\nthe wishes of the English government. Nor does it appear probable that\r\nthe government was any more favorable to the loan-office scheme than to\r\nthe union of the offices of speaker and treasurer.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Speaker Robinson, Richard Bland was a candidate for\r\nthe chair, and was in favor of a separation of the offices of speaker\r\nand treasurer. He, in the latter part of May, entertained no suspicion\r\nof any malversation in office on the part of the late treasurer,\r\nalthough he was aware that such suspicions prevailed much among the\r\npeople. He was at this time maturing a scheme for a loan-office, or\r\ngovernment bank, which he thought would be of signal advantage, and\r\nwould in a few years enable Virginia to discharge her debts without any\r\ntax for the future. It is singular that he should have been preparing to\r\nrenew a scheme so recently defeated. Whether he ever again revived it in\r\nthe assembly, does not appear. Robert Carter Nicholas, at the same time\r\na candidate for the place of treasurer, was likewise in favor of a\r\ndisjunction of the two offices. To this position he and Bland were\r\nbrought, as well by the inducements of personal promotion as by a regard\r\nfor the public good.\r\n\r\nPeyton Randolph was made speaker; and Mr. Nicholas, who had been already\r\nappointed in May treasurer _ad interim_, by Governor Fauquier, was\r\nelected to that post by the assembly.\r\n\r\nLewis Burwell, George Wythe, John Blair, Jr., John Randolph, and\r\nBenjamin Waller were appointed to examine the state of the treasury. The\r\ndeficit of the late treasurer exceeded one hundred thousand pounds. Mr.\r\nRobinson, amiable, liberal, and wealthy, had long been at the head of\r\nthe aristocracy, and exerted an extraordinary influence in political\r\naffairs. He had lent large sums of the public money to friends involved\r\nin debt, especially to members of the assembly, confiding for its\r\nreplacement upon his own ample fortune, and the securities taken on the\r\nloans. Mr. Wirt says that at length, apprehensive of a discovery of the\r\ndeficit, he, with his friends in the assembly, devised the scheme of the\r\nloan-office the better to conceal it. The entire amount of the\r\ndefalcation was eventually recovered from the estate of Robinson, which\r\nwas sold in 1770 by Edmund Pendleton and Peter Lyons, surviving\r\nadministrators.[547:A] Burk attributes Robinson's death to the\r\nmortification that he suffered on account of his defalcation. Bland and\r\nNicholas, in their letters addressed to Richard Henry Lee, allude to it\r\nin terms of exquisite delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe first of the family of Speaker Robinson of whom we have any account\r\nwas John Robinson, of Cleasby, Yorkshire, England. His son John was\r\nBishop of Bristol, and British envoy at the court of Sweden; he was also\r\nBritish plenipotentiary at the treaty of Utrecht, being, it is said, the\r\nlast divine employed in a service of that kind. He was afterwards Bishop\r\nof London, in which office he continued until his death in 1723. Leaving\r\nno issue he devised his real estate to his nephew, Christopher\r\nRobinson, who had settled on the Rappahannock. His eldest son, John\r\nRobinson, born in 1682, was president of the council. He married\r\nCatherine, daughter of Robert Beverley, the historian. John Robinson,\r\nJr., their eldest son, was treasurer and speaker, and is commonly known\r\nas \"Speaker Robinson.\"[548:A] He resided at Mount Pleasant, on the\r\nMatapony, in King and Queen, the house there having been built for him,\r\nit is said, by Augustine Moore, of Chelsea, in King William, father of\r\nLucy Moore, one of his wives. Her portrait is preserved at Chelsea; his\r\nis preserved by his descendants. His other wife was Lucy Chiswell. He\r\nlies buried in the garden at Mount Pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[540:A] The following is a list of the council in 1764:--\r\n\r\n         The Honorable JOHN BLAIR, President.\r\n     William Nelson,    |  Philip Ludwell Lee,\r\n     Thomas Nelson,     |  John Tayloe,\r\n     Peter Randolph,    |  Robert Carter,\r\n     Richard Corbin,    |  Presley Thornton,\r\n     William Byrd,      |  Robert Barwell, Esquires.\r\n\r\nOf the members of the house at this time may be mentioned the names of\r\nCabell, Cary, Wythe, Pendleton, Harrison, Marshall, Washington, Carter,\r\nRobinson, Lee, Bland, Mercer, Page, Braxton, Henry, Nelson, and\r\nRandolph.\r\n\r\n[541:A] Two other resolutions were offered, but not by Henry, to the\r\neffect that the people of Virginia were not under any obligation to obey\r\nany laws not enacted by their own assembly, and that any one who should\r\nmaintain the contrary should be deemed an enemy to the colony.

This appears from the statutes 1st\r\nHenry the Fifth, and 8th Henry the Sixth, limiting the elective\r\nfranchise, that is, depriving many of the right of representation in\r\nparliament. How could they have been thus deprived, if, as was\r\ncontended, all the people of England were still virtually represented?\r\nHe acknowledged that a very large portion of the people of Great Britain\r\nwere not entitled to representation, and were, nevertheless, bound to\r\nobey the laws of the realm, but then the obligation of these laws does\r\nnot arise from their being virtually represented. The American colonies,\r\nexcepting the few planted in the eighteenth century, were founded by\r\nprivate adventurers, who established themselves, without any expense to\r\nthe nation, in this uncultivated and almost uninhabited country, so that\r\nthey stand on a different foot from the Roman or any ancient colonies.\r\nMen have a natural right to quit their own country and retire to\r\nanother, and set up there an independent government for themselves. But\r\nif they have this so absolute a right, they must have the lesser right\r\nto remove, by compact with their sovereign, to a new country, and to\r\nform a civil establishment upon the terms of the compact. The first\r\nVirginia charter was granted to Raleigh by Queen Elizabeth, in 1584, and\r\nby it the new country was granted to him, his heirs and assigns, in\r\nperpetual sovereignty, as fully as the crown could grant, with full\r\npower of legislation and the establishment of a government. The country\r\nwas to be united to the realm of England in perfect league and amity;\r\nwas to be within the allegiance of the crown, and to be held by homage\r\nand the payment of one-fifth of all gold and silver ore. In the\r\nthirty-first year of Elizabeth's reign, Raleigh assigned the plantation\r\nof Virginia to a company, who afterwards associating other adventurers\r\nwith them, procured new charters from James the First, in whom Raleigh's\r\nrights became vested upon his attainder. The charter of James was of the\r\nsame character with that of Elizabeth, with an express clause of\r\nexemption forever from all taxation or impost upon their imports or\r\nexports. Under this charter, and the auspices of the company, the colony\r\nof Virginia was settled, after struggling through immense difficulties,\r\nand without receiving the least aid from the British government. In 1621\r\na government was established, consisting of a governor, council, and\r\nhouse of burgesses, elected by the freeholders. In 1624 James the First\r\ndissolved the company, and assumed the control of the colony, which,\r\nupon his demise, devolved upon Charles the First, who, in 1625, asserted\r\nhis royal claim of authority over it. To quiet the dissatisfaction of\r\nthe colonists at the loss of their chartered rights, the privy council\r\nafterwards, in the year 1634, communicated the king's assurance that\r\n\"all their estates and trade, freedom and privileges, should be enjoyed\r\nby them in as extensive a manner as they enjoyed them before the\r\nrecalling of the company's patent.\" Moreover, Charles the First, in\r\n1644, assured the Virginians that they should always be immediately\r\ndependent upon the crown. After the king's death Virginia displayed her\r\nloyalty by resisting the parliamentary forces sent out to reduce the\r\ncolony, and by exacting the most honorable terms of surrender. Here the\r\nauthor of \"the Inquiry,\" although exceedingly well informed in general\r\nas to the history of the colony, falls into the common error that\r\nCharles the Second was proclaimed in Virginia some time before he was\r\nrestored to the throne in England.\r\n\r\nThus Virginia was, as to her internal affairs, a distinct, independent\r\nstate, but united with the parent state by the closest league and amity,\r\nand under the same allegiance. If the crown had indeed no prerogative to\r\nform such a compact, then the royal engagements wherein \"the freedom and\r\nother benefits of the British constitution\" were secured to them, could\r\nnot be made good: and a people who are liable to taxation without\r\nrepresentation, cannot be held to enjoy \"the freedom and benefits of the\r\nBritish constitution.\" Even in the arbitrary reign of Charles the First,\r\nwhen it was thought necessary to establish a permanent revenue for the\r\nsupport of the government in Virginia, the king did not apply to the\r\nBritish parliament, but to the assembly of Virginia, and sent over an\r\nact under the great seal, by which it was enacted, \"By the king's most\r\nexcellent majesty, by and with the consent of the general assembly,\"\r\netc. After the restoration, indeed, the colonies lost the freedom of\r\ntrade which they had before enjoyed, and the navigation act of 25th\r\nCharles the Second not only circumscribed the trade of the colonies with\r\nforeign nations within very narrow limits, but imposed duties on goods\r\nmanufactured in the colonies and exported from one to another. The right\r\nto impose these duties was disputed by Virginia; and her agents, in\r\nApril, 1676, procured from Charles the Second a declaration, under his\r\nprivy seal, that \"taxes ought not to be laid upon the inhabitants and\r\nproprietors of the colony but by the common consent of the general\r\nassembly, except such impositions as the parliament should lay on the\r\ncommodities imported into England from the colony.\" But if no protest\r\nhad been made against the navigation act, that forbearance could in no\r\nway justify an additional act of injustice. If the people of the\r\ncolonies had in patience endured the oppressions of the English\r\ncommercial restrictions, could that endurance afford any ground for new\r\noppressions in the shape of direct taxes? If the people of England and\r\nof the colonies stood, as was contended, on the same foot, being both\r\nequally and alike subjects of the British government, why was the trade\r\nof the colonies subject to restrictions not imposed on the mother\r\ncountry? If parliament had a right to lay taxes of every kind on the\r\ncolonies, the commerce of the colonies ought to be as free as that of\r\nEngland, \"otherwise it will be loading them with burdens, at the same\r\ntime that they are deprived of strength to sustain them; it will be\r\nforcing them to make bricks without straw.\" When colonies are deprived\r\nof their natural rights, resistance is at once justifiable; but when\r\ndeprived of their civil rights, when great oppressions are imposed upon\r\nthem, their remedy is \"to lay their complaints at the foot of the\r\nthrone, and to suffer patiently rather than disturb the public peace,\r\nwhich nothing but a denial of justice can excuse them in breaking.\" But\r\na colony \"treated with injury and violence is become an alien. They were\r\nnot sent out to be slaves, but to be the equals of those that remain\r\nbehind.\" It was a great error in the supporters of the British ministry\r\nto count upon the sectional jealousies and clashing interests of the\r\ncolonies. Their real interests were the same, and they would not allow\r\nminor differences to divide them, when union was become necessary to\r\nmaintain in a constitutional way their rights. How was England to\r\nprevent this union? Was it by quartering armed soldiers in their\r\nfamilies? by depriving the colonists of legal trials in the courts of\r\ncommon law? or by harassing them by tax-gatherers, and prerogative\r\njudges, and inquisitorial courts? A petty people united in the cause of\r\nliberty is capable of glorious actions--such as adorn the annals of\r\nSwitzerland and Holland.\r\n\r\nThe news of the repeal of the stamp act was joyfully welcomed in\r\nAmerica, but the joy was premature; for, simultaneously with the repeal,\r\nparliament had declared that \"it had, and of right ought to have, power\r\nto bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.\" Townshend,[552:A]\r\nafterwards chancellor of the exchequer, brought into parliament a bill\r\nto levy duties in the colonies on glass, paper, painters' colors, and\r\ntea, and it became a law. The duties were external, and did not exceed\r\nin amount twenty thousand pounds; but the colonies suspected the\r\nmildness of the measure to be only a lure to inveigle them into the net.\r\nThe new act was to take effect in November, 1767. The flame of\r\nresistance, smothered for awhile by the repeal of the stamp act, now\r\nburst forth afresh: associations were everywhere organized to defeat the\r\nduties; altercations between the people and the king's officers grew\r\nfrequent; the passions of the conflicting parties were exasperated. Two\r\nBritish regiments and some armed vessels arrived at Boston.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, the assembly, encountering no opposition from the mild and\r\npatriotic Blair, remonstrated loudly against the new oppressions.\r\nOpposition to the arbitrary measures of the British administration broke\r\nforth in England, and in London the fury of civil discord shook the\r\npillars of the government.\r\n\r\nFrancis Fauquier, lieutenant-governor, died early in 1768, at the age of\r\nsixty-five years, ten of which he had passed in Virginia. He brought\r\nwith him the frivolous tastes and dissipated habits of a man of fashion\r\nand a courtier; he was addicted to gaming, and by his example diffused a\r\nrage for play. He was generous and elegant, an accomplished scholar,\r\nand, in Mr. Jefferson's opinion, the ablest of the governors of\r\nVirginia. A county is named after him. His death devolved the duties of\r\ngovernment upon John Blair, president of the council. He was a nephew of\r\nCommissary Blair, whom he had succeeded in the council. He had long\r\nrepresented Williamsburg in the house of burgesses, having been a member\r\nas early as 1736. During the trying period of his presidency, his\r\nvigilance and discretion were displayed in protecting the frontier from\r\nIndian invasion.[553:A]\r\n\r\nIn 1714 some English emigrant Baptists settled in southeast Virginia,\r\nand in 1743 another party settled in the northwest; but the most\r\nimportant accession came from New England, about the period of \"the New\r\nLight stir.\" Those who had left the established church were called\r\nSeparates, the rest Regulars. Their preachers, not unfrequently\r\nilliterate, were characterized by an impassioned manner, vehement\r\ngesticulation, and a singular tone of voice. The hearers often gave way\r\nto tears, trembling, screams, and acclamations. The number of converts\r\nincreased rapidly in some counties. The preachers were imprisoned and\r\nmaltreated by magistrates and mobs; but persecution stimulated their\r\nzeal and redoubled their influence: they sang hymns while on the way to\r\nthe prison, and addressed crowds congregated before the windows of the\r\njails. At this time Deputy-Governor Blair addressed the following letter\r\nto the king's attorney in Spotsylvania:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR:--I lately received a letter, signed by a good number of worthy\r\ngentlemen, who are not here, complaining of the Baptists; the\r\nparticulars of their misbehavior are not told, any further than their\r\nrunning into private houses and making dissensions. Mr. Craig and Mr.\r\nBenjamin Waller are now with me, and deny the charge; they tell me they\r\nare willing to take the oaths as others have: I told them I had\r\nconsulted the attorney-general, who is of opinion that the general court\r\nonly have a right to grant licenses, and therefore I referred them to\r\nthe court; but on their application to the attorney-general,[554:A] they\r\nbrought me his letter, advising me to write to you that their petition\r\nwas a matter of right, and that you may not molest these conscientious\r\npeople, so long as they behave themselves in a manner becoming pious\r\nChristians and in obedience to the laws, till the court, when they\r\nintend to apply for license, and when the gentlemen who complain may\r\nmake their objections and be heard. The act of toleration (it being\r\nfound by experience that persecuting dissenters increases their numbers)\r\nhas given them a right to apply in a proper manner for licensed houses\r\nfor the worship of God, according to their consciences, and I persuade\r\nmyself the gentlemen will quietly overlook their meetings till the\r\ncourt. I am told they administer the sacrament of the Lord's Supper near\r\nthe manner we do, and differ in nothing from our church but in that of\r\nbaptism and their renewing the ancient discipline, by which they have\r\nreformed some sinners and brought them to be truly penitent; nay, if a\r\nman of theirs is idle and neglects to labor and provide for his family\r\nas he ought, he incurs their censures, which have had good effects. If\r\nthis be their behavior, it were to be wished we had some of it among us;\r\nbut at least I hope all may remain quiet till the court.\" This letter\r\nwas dated at Williamsburg, July the 16th, 1768.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the Baptists commenced in Chesterfield, in 1770, and\r\nin no county was it carried farther. According to tradition, Colonel\r\nArchibald Cary, of Ampthill, was the arch-persecutor. In few counties\r\nhave the Baptists been more numerous than in Chesterfield.\r\n\r\nWhile many of the preachers were men of exemplary character, yet by the\r\nfacility of admission into their pulpits impostors sometimes brought\r\nscandal upon the name of religion. Schisms, too, interrupted the harmony\r\nof their associations. Nevertheless, by the striking earnestness and the\r\npious example of many of them, the Baptists gained ground rapidly in\r\nVirginia. In their efforts to avail themselves of the toleration act,\r\nthey found Patrick Henry ever ready to step forward in their behalf, and\r\nhe remained through life their unwavering friend. They still cherish his\r\nmemory with grateful affection.\r\n\r\nThe Baptists, having suffered persecution under the establishment, were,\r\nof all others, the most inimical to it, and the most active in its\r\nsubversion.[555:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[549:A] The title-page is as follows: \"An Inquiry into the Rights of the\r\nBritish Colonies, intended as an Answer to 'The Regulations lately made\r\nconcerning the Colonies, and the Taxes imposed upon them, considered.'\r\nIn a Letter addressed to the Author of that Pamphlet, by Richard Bland,\r\nof Virginia.

The season was delightful, with its\r\ntinted foliage, serene sky, and bracing air. Botetourt, just relieved\r\nfrom the confinement of a sea-voyage, was charmed with his new place of\r\nabode; the palace appeared commodious; the grounds well planted and\r\nwatered. While his new residence was fitting up for him he daily enjoyed\r\nthe hospitalities of the people. He found that while they would never\r\nwillingly submit to be taxed by the mother country, yet they were\r\nardently desirous of giving assistance, as formerly, upon requisition.\r\nIn the mean time the duties complained of were collected without any\r\nresistance whatever. Botetourt, solicitous to gratify the Virginians,\r\npledged \"his life and fortune\" to extend the boundary of the State on\r\nthe west to the Tennessee River, on the parallel of thirty-six and a\r\nhalf degrees. This boundary, Andrew Lewis and Thomas Walker wrote, would\r\ngive some room to extend the settlements for ten or twelve years.[556:A]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th day of May, 1769, when the assembly was convened, the\r\ngovernor rode from the palace to the capitol in a state-coach drawn by\r\nsix milk-white horses, a present from George the Third, and the insignia\r\nof royalty were displayed with unusual pomp. The pageant, supposed to be\r\nintended to dazzle, served rather to offend. On that day and the\r\nfollowing he entertained fifty-two guests at dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen, in Massachusetts, the custom-house officers had demanded[557:A]\r\nfrom the courts writs of assistance for enforcing the revenue act, the\r\neloquent James Otis had resisted the application in a speech which gave\r\na mighty impulse to the popular sentiment. The same question was now\r\nargued before Botetourt and the council, forming the general court, and\r\nhe concurred in declaring them illegal. During this session, Mr.\r\nJefferson made an unsuccessful effort for the enactment of a law\r\nauthorizing owners to manumit their slaves.\r\n\r\nIn February, parliament, refusing to consider a redress of American\r\ngrievances, had advised his majesty to take vigorous measures against\r\nMassachusetts, and to make inquisition there for treason, and, if\r\nsufficient ground should appear, to transport the accused to England for\r\ntrial before a special commission; and George the Third, a king of\r\nexemplary character, but obstinate temper, heartily concurred in those\r\nviews. Upon receiving intelligence of this fact, the burgesses of\r\nVirginia again[557:B] passed resolutions unanimously, vindicating the\r\nrights of the colonies, claiming the sole right to levy taxes, and\r\nasserting the right of bringing about a concert of the colonies in\r\ndefence against the encroachments of parliament; exposing the injustice\r\nand tyranny of applying to America an obsolete act of the reign of Henry\r\nthe Eighth, warning the king of the dangers that would ensue if any\r\nAmerican should be transported to England for trial, and finally\r\nordering the resolutions to be communicated to the legislatures of the\r\nother colonies, and requesting their concurrence. Even the merchants of\r\npeaceable Pennsylvania approved these resolutions; Delaware adopted them\r\nword for word; and the colonies south of Virginia eventually imitated\r\nher example. An address was also prepared to be laid before the king.\r\nBotetourt took alarm at what he termed, in his correspondence with the\r\ngovernment, \"the abominable measure,\" and having convoked the assembly,\r\naddressed them thus: \"Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the house of\r\nburgesses,--I have heard of your resolves, and augur ill of their\r\neffects. You have made it my duty to dissolve you, and you are dissolved\r\naccordingly.\"\r\n\r\nThe burgesses immediately repaired in a body to the Raleigh, and\r\nunanimously adopted a non-importation agreement, drawn by George Mason,\r\nand presented by George Washington. The resolutions included one not to\r\nimport, or purchase any imported slaves, after the first day of\r\nNovember, until the objectionable acts of parliament should be repealed.\r\nMr. Mason, not yet a member of the assembly, was not present at this\r\nmeeting. The moderate party in the assembly, while they had opposed\r\nmeasures which appeared to them injudicious and premature, nevertheless\r\navowed themselves as firmly riveted to the main principle in dispute.\r\nTheir views, they averred, had been made public in the several memorials\r\nto government; and from the position so assumed they were resolved never\r\nto recede. They had not, indeed, expected that parliament would ever\r\nexplicitly acknowledge itself in the wrong; but it had been their hope\r\nthat the dispute would have been left to rest upon reciprocal\r\nprotestations, and finally have died away. The late measures of the\r\nBritish government had extinguished such delusive hopes. That government\r\nclaimed the right of subjecting America to every act of parliament as\r\nbeing part of the British dominions; and at the same time that Americans\r\nshould be liable to punishment under an act of Henry the Eighth, made to\r\npunish offences committed _out of_ the realm. The deportation of\r\nAmericans for trial, depriving them of the right of trial by a jury of\r\nthe vicinage, appeared to be fraught with worse mischiefs than the stamp\r\nact, in as much as life is more precious than property.[558:A]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of May, 1769, the king had, in his speech to parliament,\r\nre-echoed their determination to enforce the laws in every part of his\r\ndominions. Nevertheless, on the thirteenth the Earl of Hillsborough,\r\nsecretary of state for the colonies, wrote to Botetourt, assuring him\r\nthat it was not the intention of ministers to propose any further taxes,\r\nand that they intended to propose a repeal of the duties on glass,\r\npaper, and paints, not on the question of right, but upon the ground\r\nthat those duties had been imposed contrary to the true principles of\r\ncommerce. Botetourt, calling the assembly together, communicated these\r\nassurances, adding: \"It is my firm opinion that the plan I have stated\r\nto you will certainly take place, and that it will never be departed\r\nfrom; and so determined am I to abide by it, that I will be content to\r\nbe declared infamous, if I do not to the last hour of my life, at all\r\ntimes, in all places, and upon all occasions, exert every power with\r\nwhich I am, or ever shall be, legally invested, in order to obtain and\r\nmaintain for the continent of America, that satisfaction which I have\r\nbeen authorized to promise this day by the confidential servant of our\r\ngracious sovereign, who, to my certain knowledge, rates his honor so\r\nhigh that he would rather part with his crown than preserve it by\r\ndeceit.\" The council, in reply, advised the repeal of the existing\r\nparliamentary taxes; the burgesses expressed their gratitude for\r\n\"information sanctified by the royal word,\" and considered the king's\r\ninfluence as pledged \"toward protecting the happiness of all his\r\npeople.\" Botetourt, pleased with the address, wished them \"freedom and\r\nhappiness till time should be no more.\" William Lee regarded this as\r\nmere bombastic rant. During this year appeared a pamphlet, asserting the\r\nrights of the colonies, entitled \"The Monitor's Letters,\" by Arthur Lee.\r\n\r\nLord North succeeded the Duke of Grafton as prime minister, in January,\r\n1770, and in the ensuing March all the duties on the American imports\r\nwere repealed, except that on tea. Lord North, at the same time,\r\nhowever, avowed the absolute determination of the government not to\r\nyield the right of taxing the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe first association appears not to have been adhered to, and the\r\nEnglish merchants declared that the exports to Virginia of the\r\nprohibited articles were never greater.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of June, 1770, a second association was entered into at\r\nWilliamsburg, by the burgesses and the merchants of the colony\r\nappointing committees, to be chosen by the associators of each county,\r\nto enforce the non-importation agreement; resolving to promote industry\r\nand frugality; enumerating the articles not to be imported or purchased\r\nafter a certain day, specially mentioning slaves and wine; engaging not\r\nto advance the price of goods, wares, and merchandise; binding\r\nthemselves not to import or purchase any article which should be taxed\r\nby parliament for the purpose of raising a revenue in America.\r\n\r\nThe estimable Botetourt died in October, 1770, in his fifty-third year,\r\nand after an administration of two years. Promoted to the peerage in\r\n1764, he had succeeded Sir Jeffrey Amherst as governor-in-chief in 1768,\r\nand was the first of that title since Lord Culpepper, who had\r\ncondescended to come over to the colony. On his arrival it was his\r\npurpose to reduce the Virginians to submission, either by persuasion or\r\nby force; but when he became better acquainted with the people he\r\nchanged his views, and entreated the ministry to repeal the offensive\r\nacts. Such a promise was, indeed, held out to him; but finding himself\r\ndeceived, he demanded his recall, and died shortly afterwards of a\r\nbilious fever, exacerbated by chagrin and disappointment. He was a\r\npatron of learning and the arts, giving out of his own purse silver and\r\ngold medals as prizes to the students of William and Mary College. His\r\ndeath was deeply lamented by the colony, and the assembly erected a\r\nstatue in honor of him, which is still standing, somewhat mutilated, in\r\nfront of the college. At his death the administration devolved upon\r\nWilliam Nelson, president of the council.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1771, a great fresh occurred in Virginia, the James in three\r\ndays rising twenty feet higher than ever was known before. The low\r\ngrounds were inundated, standing crops destroyed, corn, fences,\r\nchattels, merchandise, cattle, and houses carried off, and ships forced\r\nfrom their moorings. Many of the inhabitants, masters and slaves, in\r\nendeavoring to rescue property, or to escape from danger, were drowned.\r\nHouses were seen drifting down the current, and people clinging to them,\r\nuttering fruitless cries for succor. Fertile fields were covered with a\r\nthick deposit of sand; islands were torn to pieces, bars accumulated,\r\nthe channel diverted, and the face of nature altered. At Turkey Island,\r\non the James River, there is a monument bearing the following\r\ninscription: \"The foundations of this pillar were laid in the calamitous\r\nyear 1771, when all the great rivers of this country were swept by\r\ninundations never before experienced, which changed the face of nature\r\nand left traces of their violence that will remain for ages.\" One\r\nhundred and fifty persons were drowned by this rise in the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe assembly met in July, 1771. About this time the question of an\r\nAmerican episcopate was agitated; and in some of the Northern colonies\r\nthe measure was warmly contended for in the public papers. New York and\r\nNew Jersey desired to secure the co-operation of Virginia in petitioning\r\nthe king on this subject, and deputed the Rev. Dr. Cooper, President of\r\nKing's College, New York, and the Rev. Mr. McKean, deputies to visit the\r\nSouth in this behalf; and at their urgent solicitation, Commissary\r\nHorrocks, himself aspiring to the mitre, as was supposed, called a\r\nconvocation of the clergy to take the matter into consideration. Only a\r\nfew attended; but after some vacillation they determined to join in the\r\npetition to the crown, the Rev. John Camm taking the lead in this\r\nproceeding. Four of the clergy in attendance, Henley and Gwatkin,\r\nprofessors in the College of William and Mary, and Hewitt and Bland,\r\nentered a protest against the scheme of introducing a bishop, as\r\nendangering the very existence of the British empire in America. The\r\nassembly having expressed its disapprobation of the project, and it\r\nbeing urged but by few, and resisted by some of the clergy, it fell to\r\nthe ground; and the thanks of the house were presented, through Richard\r\nHenry Lee and Richard Bland, to the protesting clergymen for their \"wise\r\nand well-timed opposition.\" Churchmen naturally sided with the English\r\ngovernment, and the bench of bishops were arrayed in opposition to the\r\nrights of the colonies. The protest of the four ministers gave rise to a\r\ncontroversy between them and the United Episcopal Conventions of New\r\nYork and New Jersey; and a war of pamphlets and newspapers ensued in the\r\nNorthern and Middle States; and the stamp act itself, according to some\r\nwriters, did not evoke more bitter denunciations, nor more violent\r\nthreats, than the project of an episcopate: New England was in a flame\r\nagainst it. It was believed, that if bishops should be sent over they\r\nwould unite with the governors in opposition to the rights of America.\r\nThe laity of the Episcopal Church in America were, excepting a small\r\nminority, opposed to the measure. Neither the people of Virginia, nor\r\nany of the American colonies, were at any time willing to receive a\r\nbishop appointed by the English government. Among the advocates of the\r\nscheme the Rev. Jonathan Boucher took a prominent part, and he sustained\r\nit ably from the pulpit. He held that the refusal of Virginia to consent\r\nto the appointment of a bishop, was \"to unchurch the church;\" and his\r\nviews on this subject were re-echoed by Lowth, Bishop of Oxford, in an\r\nanniversary sermon delivered before the Society for the Propagation of\r\nthe Gospel in Foreign Parts. On this point of ecclesiastical government\r\nthe members of the establishment in Virginia appear to have been looked\r\nupon as themselves dissenters. In one sense they were so; but their\r\nrepugnance was to prelacy, not to the episcopate; a prelatical bishop\r\nwas in their minds associated with ideas of expense beyond their means,\r\nand of opposition to the principles of civil liberty. Boucher, in a\r\nsermon that he preached in this year at St. Mary's Church, in Caroline\r\nCounty, of which he was then rector, says of the dissenters in Virginia:\r\n\"I might almost as well pretend to count the gnats that buzz around us\r\nin a summer's evening.\"\r\n\r\nThe scheme of sending over a bishop had been entertained more than a\r\nhundred years before; and Dean Swift at one time entertained hopes of\r\nbeing made Bishop of Virginia, with power, as is said, to ordain priests\r\nand deacons for all the colonies, and to parcel them out into deaneries,\r\nparishes, chapels, etc., and to recommend and present thereto. The\r\nfavorite sermons of many of the Virginia clergy were Sterne's.[562:A]\r\n\r\nDuring this year died the Rev. James Horrocks, President of the College\r\nand Commissary. He had been at the head of William and Mary since the\r\ndeath of Rev. William Yates, in 1764. Mr. Horrocks was succeeded in both\r\nplaces by the Rev. John Camm.\r\n\r\nJohn Murray, Earl of Dunmore, was transferred[562:B] from the government\r\nof New York to that of Virginia. The town of Fincastle, the title of one\r\nof his sons, in Botetourt County, was now incorporated. The Honorable\r\nWilliam Nelson, president, died in this year. About this time the\r\nMethodists appeared in Virginia; they still avowed that attachment to\r\nthe Church of England which Wesley and Whitefield both, in the early\r\nyears of their career, had uniformly professed. Although they allowed\r\nlaymen to preach, the communion was received by them at the hands of the\r\nclergy only; and they even affirmed that \"whosoever left the church left\r\nthe Methodists.\" They, therefore, now were visited with a share of the\r\nodium which fell upon the established church.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[556:A] Bancroft, vi. 228.\r\n\r\n[557:A] 1769.\r\n\r\n[557:B] May 16th.\r\n\r\n[558:A] Letter of R.

DEVEREUX JARRATT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REV. DEVEREUX JARRATT was born in the County of New Kent, Virginia,\r\nin January, 1733, of obscure parentage. His grandfather, an Englishman,\r\nhad served during the civil wars under Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex,\r\nand hence probably was derived the Christian name of the grandson. His\r\ngrandmother was a native of Ireland. His father was a carpenter, and\r\nfrom the manner in which he and his family lived, some idea may be\r\nformed of the condition of the common people in that day. Their food\r\nconsisted of the produce of the soil, except a little sugar, which was\r\nused only on rare occasions. Their clothes were all of maternal\r\nmanufacture, except hats and shoes, and these last were worn only in the\r\nwinter. They not only used no tea or coffee themselves, but they knew no\r\nfamily that did use them. Meat and bread and milk constituted the diet\r\nof that class. They looked upon the gentry as a superior caste. Jarratt,\r\nin his autobiography, describing his early days, says: \"For my part, I\r\nwas quite shy of them, and kept off at an humble distance. A periwig in\r\nthose days was a distinguishing badge of gentle-folk, and when I saw a\r\nman riding the road near our house with a wig on, it would so alarm my\r\nfears and give me such a disagreeable feeling, that I dare say I would\r\nrun off as for my life.\" He lived to see society reduced to the\r\nopposite, and, in his opinion, worse extreme of republican levelling,\r\ninsubordination, and irreverence. His early education was confined to\r\nreading, writing, and elementary arithmetic, some short prayers, and the\r\nchurch catechism. Upon his father's death, Robert, the eldest son,\r\ninherited the land, and Devereux's share of the personal property was\r\ntwenty-five pounds, Virginia currency, which he was to receive when he\r\nshould reach the age of twenty-one. The relative value of money was four\r\ntimes greater then than it was fifty years afterwards. A good horse\r\ncould be bought for five pounds, and a good cow and calf for a pistole,\r\nor three dollars and sixty cents. At eight or nine years of age young\r\nJarratt was sent to school, and so continued, with great interruptions,\r\nfor three or four years. By this time he had learned to read the Bible\r\nindifferently, to write a sorry hand, and had acquired some knowledge of\r\narithmetic, and this closed his educational curriculum. Being placed now\r\nunder the guardianship of his elder brother, his employments for some\r\nyears were threefold: 1st, taking care of and training race-horses; 2d,\r\ntaking care of gamecocks and preparing them for a match and main; 3d,\r\nploughing, harrowing, and other plantation work. At the age of seventeen\r\nhe undertook the business of a carpenter, under another brother, who\r\noften had recourse to \"hard words and severe blows,\" which he \"did not\r\nat all relish;\" but he continued to labor in this way until about 1750.\r\nDuring the five or six years while he lived with his brothers, he never\r\nheard or saw anything of a religious nature, nor did he go to the parish\r\nchurch once a year. The parish minister was a poor preacher, very\r\nnear-sighted, and, reading his sermons closely, he kept his eyes fixed\r\non the paper, and so near that what he said \"seemed rather addressed to\r\nthe cushion than to the congregation.\" This parson was rarely observed\r\nto stand erect and face the audience, except when he denounced some\r\nindividual in the congregation with whom he happened to have a quarrel.\r\nCards, dancing, racing, etc., were then the favorite pastimes, and young\r\nJarratt participated in them as far as his leisure and circumstances\r\nwould permit, and this as well on Sundays as on other days. Not being\r\ncontent with his stock of learning, and skill in arithmetic being the\r\nchief desideratum among the common people, he borrowed a book, and while\r\nhis plough-horse was grazing at noon applied himself to that study, and\r\nmade rapid progress. He felt conscious at this time that the plough and\r\nthe axe were not his element; and his skill in the division of crops, in\r\nthe rule of three, and in practice, soon became so widely known that he\r\nwas, unexpectedly, when at the age of nineteen, invited to set up a\r\nschool in Albemarle County, one hundred miles distant from New Kent. His\r\nbaggage appears to have constituted no considerable impediment to his\r\njourney, for he says: \"I think I carried the whole on my back except\r\none shirt.\" His entire wardrobe at this time consisted of a pair of\r\ncoarse breeches, one or two Oznaburg shirts, a pair of shoes and\r\nstockings, an old felt hat, and a bear-skin coat, the first garment of\r\nthat kind that had ever been made for him. To improve the gentility of\r\nhis appearance he put on a cast-off wig, which he procured from a\r\nservant. On setting out for Albemarle, young Jarratt had not a farthing\r\nof money, and never had been master of as much as five shillings cash.\r\nThe income of the school scarce afforded him clothing of the coarsest\r\nkind, but he gained the confidence of his employer, who was an overseer\r\nfor a lowland gentleman, so far, that he trusted him with \"as much\r\nchecks as made him two new shirts.\" Albemarle was then a frontier\r\ncounty; there was no minister or public worship within many miles, and\r\nthe Sabbath was spent in sports and amusements. Here he met with\r\nWhitefield's Eight Sermons, delivered at Glasgow, the first book of\r\nsermons that he ever saw. Jarratt went next to live with a wealthy\r\ngentleman, whose wife was a pious Presbyterian, spoken of as a New\r\nLight. It was while he was under Presbyterian influences that his\r\nconversion took place. When upwards of twenty-five years old he\r\ncommenced the study of Latin under Alexander Martin, sent from Princeton\r\nCollege, a private tutor in the family of a gentleman in Cumberland.\r\nMartin was afterwards governor of North Carolina. Mr. Jarratt intended\r\nto become a Presbyterian minister, but in 1762 changed his mind, and\r\nbegan to prepare to take orders in the established church. Upon a\r\nfurther acquaintance with the subject his prejudices against that church\r\nand its liturgy were removed, and he came to be of opinion that the\r\nPrayer Book contained, at the least, as good a system of doctrine and\r\npublic worship as the Presbyterian; the doctrinal articles he considered\r\nthe same, in substance, in both churches, and the different modes of\r\nworship he held to be not essential. His mind hung in equilibrium\r\nbetween the Church of England and the Presbyterian Church as regarded\r\ntheir theory, and balancing the secular advantages, he decided in favor\r\nof the established church, mainly because \"he saw the Presbyterian\r\nministers dependent on annual subscriptions--a mode of support very\r\nprecarious in itself, and which subjects the minister to the caprice of\r\nso many people, and tends to bind his hands and hinder his usefulness.\"\r\nTo this he adds: \"The general prejudice of the people at that time\r\nagainst dissenters and in favor of the church, gave me a full persuasion\r\nthat I could do more good in the church than anywhere else.\" The fact\r\nis, however, that at that time the popular feeling was growing less\r\nfriendly to the clergy of the established church and more friendly to\r\ndissenters. Embarking for England, in October, 1762, and being ordained\r\ndeacon by the Bishop of London, and priest by the Bishop of Chester, he\r\npreached several times in London, and was \"suspected of being a\r\nMethodist.\" While in that city he heard Whitefield and Wesley. He\r\nreturned to Virginia in July. Shortly afterwards he was received as\r\nminister of Bath Parish, in Dinwiddie, he being then in his thirty-first\r\nyear. He found his people as ignorant of true religion as if they had\r\nnever frequented a church or heard a sermon. As regarded other Episcopal\r\nclergymen, he did not know of one in Virginia like-minded with himself.\r\nHe was indeed opposed and reproached by them as a fanatic, a dissenter,\r\na Presbyterian. His preaching, although at first unacceptable, proved,\r\nere long, effective, and crowded congregations attended his\r\nministrations. The interest extending widely beyond his parish, he spent\r\npart of his time in itinerant preaching, going several hundred miles and\r\nin every direction. The clergy in general being unwilling to open their\r\nchurches for him, and they being not large enough to contain the crowds\r\nwhich he attracted, he was in the habit of preaching in the open air,\r\nunder trees, arbors, or booths, and he had the advantage of a voice\r\nwhich was audible to his large congregations. The clergy frequently\r\nthreatened him with writs and prosecutions for the violation of\r\ncanonical order, but he retorted upon them successfully, and maintained\r\nhis ground. At length he met with sympathy and co-operation from the\r\nRev. Mr. McRoberts, and an intimacy continued between them for many\r\nyears. But as Mr. Jarratt, who was at first in effect a Presbyterian,\r\nbecame a minister of the established church, so eventually, many years\r\nafterwards, during the revolutionary war, his friend and coadjutor, Mr.\r\nMcRoberts, became a Presbyterian minister. Their friendship remained\r\nuninterrupted.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1769 the increase of the number of Baptists produced\r\nsome divisions among Mr. Jarratt's people. The Methodists appearing in\r\nVirginia about the same time, and professing to be virtually members of\r\nthe Church of England, Mr. Jarratt (in order to resist the encroachments\r\nof the Baptists) co-operated with them in building up their societies;\r\nbut he found reason subsequently to repent of this step, and although\r\noften styled a Methodist himself, yet he finally broke off entirely from\r\nthat denomination.[567:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[567:A] Life of Rev. Devereux Jarratt, 5, 107. His sermons were\r\npublished in several volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\n1773-1774.\r\n\r\n     Duty on Tea--Dunmore, Governor--Proceedings of Assembly--\r\n     Private Meeting of Patriots--Committees of Correspondence--\r\n     Washington--Dunmore visits the Frontier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year 1770, all the duties on articles imported into America\r\nhaving been repealed, save that on tea, the American merchants refused\r\nto import that commodity from England. Consequently a large stock of it\r\nwas accumulated in the warehouses of the East India Company; and the\r\ngovernment in 1773 authorized the company to ship it to America free\r\nfrom any export duty. The light import duty payable in America being far\r\nless than that from which it was exempted in England, it was taken for\r\ngranted that it would sell more readily in the colony than before it had\r\nbeen made a subject of taxation. It was, indeed, by some looked upon as\r\nnow rather a question of commerce than of taxation; the main object of\r\nthe British government appears to have been to put an end to the trade\r\nbetween the colonies and Holland, (a trade contraband according to the\r\nletter of the law, but the law had been practically long obsolete,) and\r\nto give to the East India Company a monopoly of the colonial markets.\r\nBut it was in general regarded in America as a test question of revenue.\r\n\r\nThe tea-ships arrived in America, and measures were taken to prevent the\r\nlanding of the tea; at Boston several cargoes were thrown overboard in\r\nthe night of December the eighteenth, into the sea, by a party of men\r\ndisguised as Indians, acting under the advice of Samuel Adams, and other\r\nleading patriots. Other colonies either compelled the masters of the\r\ntea-ships to return with their cargoes, or excluded them from sale; and\r\nthus not a chest of it was sold for the benefit of the company. Tea had\r\nhitherto been imported by Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts\r\ninto the colonies to the value of three hundred thousand pounds annually\r\nfrom Holland and her dependencies. In Virginia the use of this beverage\r\nwas now generally abandoned.[569:A]\r\n\r\nIntelligence of the occurrences at Boston having reached England,\r\nparliament ordered the port of that town to be closed on the fourth day\r\nof June; and other strong measures were adopted in order to reduce\r\nMassachusetts to submission. The colonies, like the captives in the cave\r\nof Polyphemus, were conscious of being involved in a common danger; and\r\nthat if one should fall a victim, the destruction of the rest would be\r\nonly a question of time.\r\n\r\nWhen John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, the newly-appointed governor of\r\nVirginia, reached Williamsburg, early in 1772, he found that he had\r\nalready incurred suspicion on account of the appointment of Captain Foy\r\nas his clerk, or private secretary, with a salary of five hundred\r\npounds, to be derived from new-created fees. Foy had distinguished\r\nhimself at the battle of Minden, and had been afterwards governor of New\r\nHampshire. Dunmore summoned the assembly which met in February; and his\r\napparent haughtiness at the first rather heightened the prejudice\r\nagainst him. He, however, relinquished the objectionable fees, and thus\r\nconciliated so good a feeling that the assembly expressed their\r\ngratitude in warm and affectionate terms. Some important acts were\r\npassed during this session, including several for the promotion of\r\ninternal improvement--for improving the navigation of the Potomac; for\r\nmaking a road from the Warm Spring to Jenning's Gap; for clearing the\r\nMatapony; for circumventing the falls of James River by a canal from\r\nWestham; and for cutting a canal across from Archer's Hope Creek to\r\nQueen's Creek, through Williamsburg, to connect the James River with the\r\nYork. The Counties of Berkley and Dunmore were carved out from\r\nFrederick.[569:B]\r\n\r\nThe assembly was prorogued to the tenth of June. Dunmore,\r\nnotwithstanding his recent complaisance, evinced his distaste for\r\nassemblies by proroguing them from time to time, until at length a\r\nforgery of the paper-currency of the colony compelled him to call the\r\nlegislature together again, by proclamation, March 4th, 1773--the\r\nthirteenth year of the reign of George the Third. His lordship's\r\nmeasures in apprehending the counterfeiters had been more energetic than\r\nlegal, and the assembly, not diverted by their care for the treasury\r\nfrom a regard to personal rights, requested that his proceedings might\r\nnot be drawn into a precedent.\r\n\r\nThe horizon was again darkened by gathering clouds. A British armed\r\nrevenue vessel having been burnt in Narraganset Bay, an act of\r\nparliament was passed making such offences punishable by death, and\r\nauthorizing the accused to be transported to England for trial. Virginia\r\nhad already, in 1709, remonstrated against this last measure. The\r\nconservatives, the _statu quo_ party in the assembly, as usual, differed\r\nwith the movement party as to the proper measure to be adopted. Patrick\r\nHenry, Mr. Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, Francis L. Lee, Dabney Carr,\r\nand perhaps one or two others were at this gloomy period in the habit of\r\nmeeting together in the evening in a private room of the Raleigh, to\r\nconsult on the state of affairs. In conformity with their agreement,\r\nDabney Carr, on the twelfth of March, moved a series of resolutions,\r\nrecommending a committee of correspondence, and instructing them to\r\ninquire in regard to the newly-constituted court in Rhode Island.\r\nRichard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry made speeches of memorable eloquence\r\non this occasion. Mr. Lee was the author of the plan of intercolonial\r\ncommittees of correspondence; and Virginia was the first colony that\r\nadopted it. The resolutions passed without opposition, and Dunmore\r\nimmediately dissolved the house. These resolutions \"struck a greater\r\npanic into the ministers\" than anything that had taken place since the\r\npassage of the stamp act.[570:A]\r\n\r\nThe committee of correspondence appointed were Peyton Randolph, Robert\r\nC. Nicholas, Richard Bland, Richard Henry Lee, Benjamin Harrison, Edmund\r\nPendleton, Patrick Henry, Dudley Digges, Dabney Carr, Archibald Cary,\r\nand Thomas Jefferson. On the day after the dissolution, this committee\r\naddressed a circular to the other colonies. Robert Carter Nicholas\r\npublished, during this year, a pamphlet in defence of colonial rights.\r\n\r\nDabney Carr, although young, was, according to Mr. Jefferson, a\r\nformidable rival at the bar to Patrick Henry, and promised to become a\r\ndistinguished statesman; but he died shortly after, in the thirtieth\r\nyear of his age, greatly lamented. The judge of the same name was his\r\nson. Washington was a member of this assembly, and supported the\r\npatriotic measures, perhaps, however, as yet little dreaming that the\r\ncolonies were on the verge of revolution and war. He was still on\r\nfriendly terms with Governor Dunmore, who appreciated his abilities and\r\ncharacter. He, indeed, intended about this time, in compliance with the\r\ngovernor's invitation, to accompany him in a tour of observation to the\r\nwestern frontier of Virginia, where both of them had an interest in\r\nlands; but this was prevented by the illness and death of Miss Custis,\r\nthe daughter of Mrs. Washington by a former marriage.\r\n\r\nDunmore visited the frontier and remained some time at Pittsburg, and\r\nendeavored, by the help of Dr. Conolly, to extend the bounds of Virginia\r\nin that quarter; and this was attributed to a design to foment a quarrel\r\nbetween Virginia and Pennsylvania; but the suspicion was probably\r\nwithout sufficient foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[569:A] Some of the loyal ladies adhered to the use of it. The wife of\r\nBernard Moore, of Chelsea, in King William, daughter of a British\r\ngovernor, Spotswood, according to family tradition, continued to sip her\r\ntea in her closet after it was banished from the table.\r\n\r\n[569:B] The name of Dunmore was, in 1777, changed to Shenandoah.\r\n\r\n[570:A] MS. letter of William Lee, dated at London, January 1st, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\n1774.\r\n\r\n     Lady Dunmore and Children--Gayety of Williamsburg--Boston Port\r\n     Bill--Fast-day appointed--Governor dissolves the Assembly--\r\n     Resolutions of Burgesses--Convention called--The Raleigh--\r\n     Mason's Opinion of Henry--Patriotic Measures--Convention--\r\n     Jefferson's \"Summary View.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE in April there arrived at the palace in Williamsburg, the Right\r\nHonorable the Countess of Dunmore, with George, Lord Fincastle, the\r\nHonorable Alexander and John Murray, and the Ladies Catherine, Augusta,\r\nand Susan Murray, accompanied by Captain Foy and his lady. On this\r\noccasion there was an illumination, and the people with acclamations\r\nwelcomed her ladyship and family to Virginia. The three sons of Lord\r\nDunmore were students in the College of William and Mary in that year.\r\n\r\nWhen the assembly met in May, Williamsburg presented a scene of unwonted\r\ngayety, and a court-herald published a code of etiquette for the\r\nregulation of the society of the little metropolis. Washington, arriving\r\nthere on the sixteenth, dined with Lord Dunmore. At the beginning of the\r\nsession the burgesses made an address congratulating the governor on the\r\narrival of his lady, and the members agreed to give a ball in her honor\r\non the twenty-seventh; but the sky was again suddenly overcast by\r\nintelligence of the act of parliament shutting up the port of Boston.\r\nThe assembly made an indignant protest against this act, and,[572:A]\r\nimitating the example of the Puritans in the civil wars of England, set\r\napart the first of June, appointed for closing the port, as a day of\r\nfasting, prayer, and humiliation, in which the Divine interposition was\r\nto be implored to protect the rights of the colonies, and avert the\r\nhorrors of civil war, and to unite the people of America in the common\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Dunmore, summoning the burgesses to attend him in the\r\ncouncil chamber, dissolved them in the following words: \"Mr. Speaker and\r\nGentlemen of the house of burgesses, I have in my hand a paper published\r\nby order of your house, conceived in such terms as reflect highly upon\r\nhis majesty and the parliament of Great Britain, which makes it\r\nnecessary for me to dissolve you, and you are dissolved accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nThe burgesses repaired immediately to the Raleigh,[573:A] and in the\r\nroom called \"the Apollo\" adopted resolutions against the use of tea and\r\nother East India commodities, and recommended the annual convening of a\r\ncongress. In this measure, as in the appointment of committees of\r\ncorrespondence, Virginia took the lead. North Carolina promptly followed\r\nher example. Notwithstanding the untoward turn of events, Washington\r\ndined with the governor on the twenty-fifth, and passed the evening with\r\nhim, rode with him to his farm, and breakfasted there on the following\r\nday, and attended the ball given on the twenty-seventh in honor of Lady\r\nDunmore.\r\n\r\nFurther news being received from Boston, the members who remained in\r\nWilliamsburg held a meeting on the twenty-ninth, at which Peyton\r\nRandolph presided, and they issued a circular, recommending a meeting of\r\ndeputies in a convention to assemble there on the first of August.\r\n\r\nA dissolution of the assembly had been expected, but it had been\r\nsupposed that it would be deferred until the public business should be\r\ndespatched--toward the latter part of June. Consultations and measures\r\nfor the preservation of the public rights and liberties were conducted\r\nand matured very privately, and by very few members, of whom Patrick\r\nHenry was the leader. George Mason, who arrived in Williamsburg in the\r\nlatter part of May, says, in a letter to a friend: \"At the request of\r\nthe gentlemen concerned, I have spent an evening with them upon the\r\nsubject, where I had an opportunity of conversing with Mr. Henry and\r\nknowing his sentiments, as well as hearing him speak in the house since\r\non different occasions. He is by far the most powerful speaker I ever\r\nheard. Every word he says not only engages, but commands the attention,\r\nand your passions are no longer your own when he addresses them. But his\r\neloquence is the least part of his merit. He is, in my opinion, the\r\nfirst man upon this continent as well in abilities as public virtues,\r\nand had he lived in Rome about the time of the first Punic war, when the\r\nRoman people had arrived at their meridian glory, and their virtue not\r\ntarnished, Mr. Henry's talents must have put him at the head of that\r\nglorious commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mason found the minds of all at Williamsburg entirely absorbed in\r\nthe news from Massachusetts. The burgesses, at their own expense, sent\r\nto their counties copies of the resolution adopted against the Boston\r\nport bill, in order that it should be ratified by the people. Mr. Mason,\r\nas other members probably did, directed that his elder children should\r\nattend church on the day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer, in\r\nmourning. The first of June was observed as set apart by the house of\r\nburgesses. The same day being the time fixed for the discontinuance of\r\nthe use of tea, the ladies, before that day, sealed up their stock, with\r\na determination not to use it until the duty should be repealed, and\r\nresolutions of sympathy and encouragement, and contributions of money\r\nand provisions, were sent from Virginia for the relief of \"our\r\ndistressed fellow-subjects of Boston.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these excitements John Page, of Rosewell, was elected\r\npresident of the Society for the Advancement of Useful Knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of June, Washington presided as moderator at a\r\nmeeting held in his own county, Fairfax, and he was made chairman of a\r\ncommittee appointed to draught resolutions on the alarming state of\r\npublic affairs, to be reported at a future meeting. He about this time\r\nwarmly supported the patriotic measures, in a correspondence with his\r\nneighbor and friend, Bryan Fairfax, who adhered to the Anglican side in\r\nthe dispute. On the twenty-fourth of August he wrote to him: \"I could\r\nwish, I own, that the dispute had been left to posterity to determine;\r\nbut the crisis is arrived when we must assert our rights, or submit to\r\nevery imposition that can be heaped upon us, till custom and use will\r\nmake us as tame and abject slaves as the blacks we rule over with such\r\narbitrary sway.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fairfax committee framed resolutions, intimating that a persistence\r\nof the government in its measures of coercion would result of necessity\r\nonly in a resort to the arbitrament of arms. These resolutions were\r\nadopted by a county meeting held on the eighteenth of July, and\r\nWashington was elected a delegate to the convention which was about to\r\nconvene. This body met on the first day of August, (although Dunmore had\r\nissued writs for a new assembly,) its object being to consider the state\r\nand condition of the colony, and to appoint delegates to congress. A new\r\nand more thorough non-importation association was organized. Peyton\r\nRandolph, Richard Henry Lee, Washington, Henry, Bland, Benjamin\r\nHarrison, Jr., of Berkley, and Pendleton, were appointed[575:A]\r\ndelegates to congress. Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee were listened\r\nto with delight, and Washington said, \"I will raise one thousand men,\r\nsubsist them at my own expense, and march myself at their head for the\r\nrelief of Boston.\"[575:B]\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson was elected a member of this convention, but was prevented\r\nfrom attending by the state of his health. In the interval before the\r\nmeeting he prepared instructions for the Virginia delegates in congress,\r\nin which he assumed the ground that the British parliament had no right\r\nwhatever to exercise any authority over the colony of Virginia. These\r\ninstructions being communicated through the president of the convention,\r\nPeyton Randolph, were generally read and approved of by many, though\r\nconsidered too bold for the present. But they printed them in a\r\npamphlet, under the title of \"A Summary View of the Rights of British\r\nAmerica.\"[575:C] The following excerpts are taken from it: \"History has\r\ninformed us that bodies of men as well as individuals are susceptible of\r\nthe spirit of tyranny.\" \"Scarcely have our minds been able to emerge\r\nfrom the astonishment into which one stroke of parliamentary thunder has\r\ninvolved us before another more heavy and more alarming is fallen on\r\nus.\" \"The great principles of right and wrong are legible to every\r\nreader; to pursue them requires not the aid of many counsellors. The\r\nwhole art of government consists in the art of being honest; only aim to\r\ndo your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail. No longer\r\npersevere in sacrificing the rights of one part of the empire to the\r\ninordinate desires of another, but deal out to all equal and impartial\r\nright. Let no act be passed by any one legislature which may infringe on\r\nthe rights and liberties of another.\" \"Accept of every commercial\r\npreference it is in our power to give for such things as we can raise\r\nfor their use, or they make for ours. But let them not think to exclude\r\nus from going to other markets to dispose of those commodities which\r\nthey cannot use, or to supply those wants which they cannot supply.\"\r\n\r\nOn the subject of slavery Mr. Jefferson used the following language:\r\n\"The abolition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire in\r\nthese colonies, where it was unhappily introduced in their infant state.\r\nBut previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves we have, it is\r\nnecessary to exclude all further importations from Africa, yet our\r\nrepeated attempts to effect this, by prohibitions, and by imposing\r\nduties which might amount to a prohibition, have been hitherto defeated\r\nby his majesty's negative; thus preferring the immediate advantage of a\r\nfew British corsairs to the lasting interests of the American States and\r\nto the rights of human nature deeply wounded by this infamous practice.\"\r\n\r\nIn consonance with these opinions, the convention adopted the following\r\nresolution: \"After the first day of November next we will neither\r\nourselves import, nor purchase any slave or slaves imported by any other\r\nperson, either from Africa, the West Indies, or any other place.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson's pamphlet displays a thorough knowledge of the history\r\nand constitutional rights of the colony; it breathes a fiery spirit of\r\ndefiance and revolution, and the rhythmical splendor of elevated\r\ndeclamation in some of its passages is hardly inferior to Junius. If\r\nsome of its statements and views are extravagant or erroneous, yet it is\r\nbold, acute, comprehensive, luminous, and impressive. This pamphlet, it\r\nis said, found its way to England, was taken hold of by the opposition,\r\ninterpolated a little by Edmund Burke, so as to make it answer\r\nopposition purposes, and in that form it ran through several editions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[572:A] May twenty-fourth.\r\n\r\n[573:A] The Raleigh tavern, a wooden house, is upwards of a hundred\r\nyears old.

Richard, second son of\r\nRichard Lee, was of the council, and an adherent of Sir William Berkley;\r\nand Thomas Lee, third son, was some time president of the council. He\r\nwas one of the majority of that body who persecuted the dissenters.\r\nRichard Henry Lee's maternal relations were conspicuous for their\r\nwealth, influence, and public stations. Colonel Ludwell, the father of\r\nMrs. Lee, was of the council, as also was a son of his. Her grandfather\r\nwas a collector of the customs, (having succeeded in that office Giles\r\nBland, who was executed during Bacon's rebellion,) and afterwards\r\ngovernor of North Carolina. The Ludwells were staunch supporters of Sir\r\nWilliam Berkley and the Stuart dynasty. Richard Henry Lee's mother, one\r\nof the high-toned aristocracy of the colony, confined her care chiefly\r\nto her daughters and her eldest son, and left her younger sons pretty\r\nmuch to shift for themselves. After a course of private tuition in his\r\nfather's house, Richard Henry was sent to Wakefield Academy, Yorkshire,\r\nEngland, where he distinguished himself by his proficiency in his\r\nstudies, particularly in the Latin and Greek. Having completed his\r\ncourse at this school, he travelled through England, and visited London.\r\nHe returned when about nineteen years of age to his native country, two\r\nyears after his father's death, which occurred in 1750. Young Lee's\r\npatrimony rendering it unnecessary for him to devote himself to a\r\nprofession, he now passed a life of ease, but not of idleness; for he\r\nindulged his taste for letters, and diligently stored his mind with\r\nknowledge. In 1755, being chosen captain of a company of volunteers\r\nraised in Westmoreland, he marched with them to Alexandria, and offered\r\ntheir services to General Braddock; but the offer was declined. In his\r\ntwenty-fifth year Mr. Lee was appointed a justice of the peace, and\r\nshortly afterwards elected a burgess for his county. Naturally\r\ndiffident, and finding himself surrounded by able men, for one or two\r\nsessions he took no part in the debates. One of his early efforts was in\r\nsupport of a resolution \"to lay so heavy a tax on the importation of\r\nslaves as effectually to put an end to that iniquitous and disgraceful\r\ntraffick within the colony of Virginia.\" On this question he argued\r\nagainst the institution of slavery as a portentous evil, moral and\r\npolitical.[578:A] When the defalcations of Treasurer Robinson came to be\r\nsuspected, Mr. Lee insisted with firmness, in the face of a proud and\r\nembittered opposition, on an investigation of the treasury. In November,\r\n1764, when the stamp act was first heard of in America, Mr. Lee, at the\r\ninstance of a friend, wrote to England, making application for a\r\ncollector's office under that act. He alleged that at that time neither\r\nhe, nor, as he believed, his countrymen, had duly reflected on the real\r\nnature of that act. Observing soon, however, the growing dissatisfaction\r\nwith that measure, and bestowing more deliberate reflection upon it, he\r\nbecame convinced of its pernicious character, and of the impropriety of\r\nhis application; and from that time he became one of the most strenuous\r\nopponents of the stamp act. In the year 1766 he brought to the\r\nconsideration of the assembly the act of parliament claiming a right to\r\ntax America; and he draughted the address to the king, and the memorial\r\nto the commons. His accomplishments, learning, courtesy, patriotism,\r\nrepublican principles, decision of character and eloquence, commanded\r\nthe attention of the legislature. Although a member at the time of the\r\nintroduction of Henry's resolutions, in 1765, Mr. Lee happened not to be\r\npresent at the discussion; but he heartily concurred in their adoption.\r\nShortly afterwards he organized an association in furtherance of them in\r\nWestmoreland. He vigorously opposed the act laying a duty on tea, and\r\nthat for quartering British troops in the colonies. He was now residing\r\nat Chantilly, his seat on the Potomac, a few miles below Stratford, in\r\nWestmoreland. The house at Chantilly is no longer standing. On the 25th\r\nof July, 1768, in a letter to John Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, Mr. Lee\r\nsuggested \"that not only select committees should be appointed by all\r\nthe colonies, but that a private correspondence should be conducted\r\nbetween the lovers of liberty in every province.\" In the year 1773 the\r\nVirginia assembly, at the suggestion of Mr. Lee, appointed the first\r\ncommittee of intercolonial correspondence, consisting of six members, of\r\nwhom he was one.\r\n\r\nWashington was joined at Mount Vernon by Henry and Pendleton, and they\r\nproceeded together to Philadelphia. Here the old Continental Congress,\r\nconsisting of fifty-five delegates, representing all the colonies except\r\nGeorgia, assembled on the 5th day of September, 1774.[579:A]\r\n\r\nUpon the motion of Mr. Lynch, of South Carolina, Peyton Randolph, of\r\nVirginia, was unanimously elected president, and Charles Thomson,\r\nsecretary. At the opening of the session, on the second day, the\r\nprolonged silence was at length broken by Patrick Henry. Reciting the\r\ngrievances of the colonies, he declared that all government was\r\ndissolved, and that they were reduced to a state of nature; that the\r\ncongress which he was addressing was the first in a perpetual series of\r\ncongresses. A few sentences roughly jotted down in John Adams'\r\ndiary[579:B] are all that survive of this celebrated speech.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee towered supereminent in debate; yet\r\nit soon came to be remarked that in composition and the routine of\r\nactual business they were surpassed by many.[579:C] But \"the egotism of\r\nhuman nature will seldom allow us to credit a man for one excellence,\r\nwithout detracting from him in other respects; if he has genius, we\r\nimagine he has not common sense; if he is a poet, we suppose that he is\r\nnot a logician.\"[580:A] It has been seen that George Mason considered\r\nHenry \"the first man on this continent in ability as in public virtues.\"\r\nA great man only can adequately appreciate a great man. Henry was\r\ncapable of being no less efficient in the committee-room than on the\r\nfloor of debate.[580:B] There was no test of intellectual excellence too\r\nsevere for him. The state-papers of Richard Henry Lee are sufficient\r\nproofs of his capacity.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were conducted in secret session. Intelligence which was\r\nreceived from Boston riveted more closely the union of the North and\r\nSouth; minor differences were lost sight of in view of the portentous\r\ncommon danger. The congress made a declaration of rights. Dickinson\r\ncomposed the petition to the king, and the address to the inhabitants of\r\nQuebec; Jay an address to the people of Great Britain; and Richard Henry\r\nLee a memorial to the inhabitants of the British colonies. The congress,\r\nafter a session of fifty-one days, adjourned in October.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry, on his return home, being asked, \"Who is the greatest man in\r\ncongress?\" replied, \"If you speak of eloquence, Mr. Rutledge, of South\r\nCarolina, is by far the greatest orator; but if you speak of solid\r\ninformation and sound judgment, Colonel Washington is unquestionably the\r\ngreatest man on that floor.\" John Adams, the eloquent and indomitable\r\nadvocate of independence, mentions Lee, Henry, and Hooper as the orators\r\nof that body. Washington, in a letter addressed to Captain Mackenzie,\r\nwho had formerly served under him, and was now among the British troops\r\nat Boston, gave it as his opinion, that it was neither the wish nor\r\nthe interest of Massachusetts, nor of any of the colonies, to set up\r\nfor independence; yet they never would submit to the loss of their\r\nconstitutional rights. The same opinion was avowed by Jefferson,\r\nFranklin, and other leading men; yet there was undoubtedly then, and\r\nlong had been, a strong undercurrent, a heavy ground-swell in the\r\ndirection of independence, it being evident that England would never\r\nrestore the colonies to their condition previous to 1763. A declaration\r\nof war is usually preceded by a hypothetical denial of hostile designs:\r\nit is the lull whose mysterious silence heralds in the approaching\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry stood foremost among the statesmen of Virginia, from the\r\nbeginning of the contest, in favor of independence; he was on this point\r\nten years in advance of them;[581:A] standing out in bold relief the\r\nprominent and pre-eminent figure on the canvas. Samuel Adams, in\r\nMassachusetts, was a patriot of the same stamp.\r\n\r\nThe danger of an outbreak of hostilities between the people of Boston\r\nand the British troops growing daily more imminent, the spirit of\r\nwarlike preparation, by a sort of contagion, pervaded the colonies. It\r\nhad long been a custom in Virginia to form independent military\r\ncompanies; and several of these now solicited Colonel Washington to\r\nreview them and take command; and he consented; and in the apprehension\r\nof war, all eyes involuntarily turned to him as the first military\r\ncharacter in the colony. At Mount Vernon he occasionally saw his former\r\ncompanions in arms, Dr. James Craik, and Captain Hugh Mercer, also a\r\nphysician, both natives of Scotland, and with them talked over the\r\nrecollections of former years, and discussed the prospects of the\r\nfuture. Washington was visited during the year also by General Charles\r\nLee and Major Horatio Gates, natives of England, who had distinguished\r\nthemselves in the British army, and destined to become conspicuous in\r\nthe American war of revolution. They had recently purchased estates in\r\nBerkley County, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[578:A] Life of Richard Henry Lee, 17.\r\n\r\n[579:A] Carpenter's Hall, instituted in 1721 by the Company of\r\nCarpenters, is in a court a little back from Chestnut Street.

On which side these\r\noutrages commenced was a matter of dispute, but the whites appear to\r\nhave been probably the aggressors. An Indian war being apprehended,\r\nDunmore appointed General Andrew Lewis, of Botetourt County, then a\r\nmember of the assembly, to the command of the southern division of the\r\nforces raised in Botetourt, Augusta, and the adjoining counties east of\r\nthe Blue Ridge, while his lordship in person took command of those\r\nlevied in the northern counties, Frederick, Dunmore, and those adjacent.\r\nAccording to the plan of campaign, as arranged at Williamsburg, Lewis\r\nwas to march down the valley of the Kanawha[582:A] to Point Pleasant,\r\nwhere that river empties into the Ohio, there to be joined by the\r\ngovernor, who was to march by way of Fort Pitt, and thence descend the\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nLate in August the _Virginia Gazette_ announced news from the frontier\r\nthat Lord Dunmore was to march in a few days for the mouth of New River,\r\nwhere he was to be joined by Lewis.\r\n\r\nEarly in September the troops under his command made their rendezvous at\r\nCamp Union,[582:B] now Lewisburg, in the County of Greenbrier. They\r\nconsisted of two regiments, under Colonel William Fleming, of Botetourt,\r\nand Colonel Charles Lewis, of Augusta, comprising about four hundred\r\nmen. At Camp Union they were joined by a company under Colonel Field, of\r\nCulpepper, one from Bedford, under Colonel Buford, and two from the\r\nHolston settlement, (now Washington County,) under Captains Shelby and\r\nHarbert. These were part of the forces to be led on by Colonel\r\nChristian, who was to join the troops at Point Pleasant as soon as his\r\nregiment should be completed.\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh of September General Lewis, with eleven hundred men,\r\ncommenced his march through the wilderness, piloted by Captain Matthew\r\nArbuckle; flour, ammunition, and camp equipage being transported on\r\npack-horses and bullocks driven in the rear of the little army. After a\r\nmarch of one hundred and sixty miles, they reached, on the thirtieth of\r\nSeptember, Point Pleasant, at the junction of the Great Kanawha with the\r\nbeautiful Ohio. \"This promontory was elevated considerably above the\r\nhigh-water mark, and afforded an extensive and variegated prospect of\r\nthe surrounding country. Here were seen hills, mountains, valleys,\r\ncliffs, plains, and promontories, all covered with gigantic forests, the\r\ngrowth of centuries, standing in their native grandeur and integrity,\r\nunsubdued, unmutilated by the hand of man, wearing the livery of the\r\nseason, and raising aloft in mid-air their venerable trunks and branches\r\nas if to defy the lightning of the sky and the fury of the whirlwind.\r\nThis widely-extended prospect, though rudely magnificent and\r\npicturesque, wanted, nevertheless, some of those softer features which\r\nmight embellish and beautify, or, if the expression were permitted,\r\nmight civilize the savage wilderness of some of nature's noblest\r\nefforts. Here were to be seen no villages nor hamlets, not a farm-house\r\nnor cottage, no fields nor meadows with their appropriate furniture,\r\nshocks of corn, nor herds of domestic animals. In its widest range the\r\neye would in vain seek to discover a cultivated spot of earth on which\r\nto repose. Here were no marks of industry, nor of the exercise of those\r\narts which minister to the comfort and convenience of man; here nature\r\nhad for ages on ages held undisputed empire. In the deep and dismal\r\nsolitude of these woodlands the lone wanderer would have been startled\r\nby the barking of the watch-dog, or the shrill clarion of a chanticleer.\r\nHere the whistling of the plough-boy, or the milk-maid's song, sounds\r\nelsewhere heard with pleasing emotions, would have been incongruous and\r\nout of place.\"[583:A]\r\n\r\nDunmore, who had marched across the country to the Shawnee towns,\r\nfailing to join Lewis, runners were sent out by him toward Fort Pitt in\r\nquest of his lordship. October the sixth the _Williamsburg Gazette_\r\nannounced advices from the frontier that the Earl of Dunmore had\r\nconcluded a treaty of peace with the Delaware Indians. And before the\r\nreturn of the runners despatched from Point Pleasant, an express from\r\nthe governor reached Point Pleasant on Sunday, the nineteenth of\r\nOctober, ordering General Lewis to march for the Chilicothe towns and\r\nthere join him. Preparations were immediately made for crossing the\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Indians, headed by Cornstalk, had determined to\r\ncross the Ohio, some miles above Point Pleasant, and to march down\r\nduring the night, so as to surprise the camp at daybreak. \"Accordingly,\r\non the evening of the ninth of October, soon after dark, they began to\r\ncross the river on rafts previously prepared. To ferry so many men over\r\nthis wide river and on these clumsy transports must have required\r\nconsiderable time. But before morning they were all on the eastern bank,\r\nready to proceed. Their route now lay down the margin of the river,\r\nthrough an extensive bottom. On this bottom was a heavy growth of\r\ntimber, with a foliage so dense as in many places to intercept, in a\r\ngreat measure, the light of the moon and the stars. Beneath lay many\r\ntrunks of fallen trees, strewed in different directions, and in various\r\nstages of decay. The whole surface of the ground was covered with a\r\nluxuriant growth of weeds, interspersed with entangling vines and\r\ncreepers, and in some places with close-set thickets of spice-wood or\r\nother undergrowth. A journey through this in the night must have been\r\ntedious, tiresome, dark, and dreary. The Indians, however, entered on it\r\npromptly, and persevered until break of day, when, about a mile distant\r\nfrom the camp, one of those unforeseen incidents occurred which so often\r\ntotally defeat or greatly mar the best concerted military\r\nenterprises.\"[584:A]\r\n\r\nTwo soldiers setting out very early from the camp on a hunting\r\nexcursion, proceeded up the bank of the Ohio, and when they had gone\r\nabout two miles they came suddenly upon a large body of Indians, who had\r\ncrossed the river the evening before, and were now just rising from\r\ntheir encampment and preparing for battle. Espying the hunters they\r\nfired and killed one of them; the other escaping unhurt, ran back to the\r\ncamp, where he arrived just before sunrise, and reported that \"he had\r\nseen about five acres of ground covered with Indians as thick as they\r\ncould stand one beside another.\" It was Cornstalk at the head of an army\r\nof Delawares, Mingoes, Cayugas, Iowas, Wyandots, and Shawnees, and but\r\nfor the hunter's intelligence they would have surprised the camp. In a\r\nfew moments two other men came in and confirmed the report, and then\r\nGeneral Lewis lit his pipe, and sent forward the first division under\r\nhis brother, Colonel Charles Lewis, and the second under Colonel\r\nFleming; the first marching to the right at some distance from the Ohio,\r\nthe bottom being a mile wide there; the second marching to the left\r\nalong the bank of the river. General Andrew Lewis remained with the\r\nreserve to defend the camp. Colonel Lewis's division had not advanced\r\nalong the river bottom quite half a mile from the camp when he was\r\nvigorously attacked in front, a little after sunrise, by the enemy,\r\nnumbering between eight hundred and a thousand. Fleming's division was\r\nlikewise attacked on the bank of the river. In a short time Colonel\r\nCharles Lewis was mortally wounded; this gallant and estimable officer,\r\nwhen struck by the bullet, fell at the foot of a tree, when he was,\r\nagainst his own wish, carried back to his tent by Captain Morrow and a\r\nprivate, and he died in a few hours, deeply lamented. Colonel Fleming\r\nalso was severely wounded, two balls passing through his arm and one\r\nthrough his breast. After cheering on the officers and soldiers, he\r\nretired to the camp. The Augusta troops, upon the fall of their leader,\r\nColonel Lewis, and several of the men, gave way, and retreated toward\r\nthe camp, but being met by a re-enforcement of about two hundred and\r\nfifty, under Colonel Field, they rallied and drove back the enemy, and\r\nat this juncture this officer was killed. His place was taken by Captain\r\nShelby. At length the Indians formed a line behind logs and trees, at\r\nright angles to the Ohio, through the woods to Crooked Creek, which\r\nempties into the Great Kanawha a little above its mouth. The engagement\r\nnow became general, and was obstinately sustained in the bush-fighting\r\nmanner on both sides. The Virginia troops being hemmed in between the\r\ntwo rivers, with the Indians in front, General Lewis employed the troops\r\nfrom the more eastern part of the colony (who were less experienced in\r\nIndian fighting) in throwing up a breastwork of the boughs and trunks of\r\ntrees, across the delta between the Kanawha and Ohio. About twelve\r\no'clock the Indian fire began to slacken, and the enemy slowly and\r\nreluctantly gave way, being driven back less than two miles during six\r\nor seven hours. A desultory fire was still kept up from behind trees,\r\nand the whites as they pressed on the savages were repeatedly\r\nambuscaded. At length General Lewis detached three companies, commanded\r\nby Captains Shelby, Matthews, and Stuart, with orders to move secretly\r\nalong the banks of the Kanawha and Crooked Creek, so as to gain the\r\nenemy's rear. This manoeuvre being successfully executed, the Indians,\r\nas some report, at four o'clock P.M., fled; according to other accounts,\r\nthe firing continued until sunset. During the night they recrossed the\r\nOhio. The loss of the Virginians in this action has been variously\r\nestimated at from forty to seventy-five killed and one hundred and forty\r\nwounded--a large proportion of the number of the troops actually\r\nengaged, who did not exceed five hundred and fifty, as one hundred of\r\nGeneral Lewis's men, including his best marksmen, were absent in the\r\nwoods hunting, and knew nothing of the battle until it was all over.\r\nAmong the killed were Colonel Charles Lewis, Colonel Field, who had\r\nserved in Braddock's war, Captains Buford, Morrow, Murray, Ward,\r\nCundiff, Wilson, and McClenachan, Lieutenants Allen, Goldsby, and\r\nDillon. Of the officers present at the battle of Point Pleasant many\r\nbecame afterwards distinguished men.[586:A]\r\n\r\nThe loss of the savages was never ascertained; the bodies of\r\nthirty-three slain were found, but many had been thrown into the Ohio\r\nduring the engagement. The number of the Indian army was not known\r\ncertainly, but it comprised the flower of the northern confederated\r\ntribes, led on by Red Hawk, a Delaware chief; Scoppathus, a Mingo;\r\nChiyawee, a Wyandot; Logan, a Cayuga; and Ellinipsico, and his father,\r\nCornstalk, Shawnees. But some say that Logan was not present in the\r\nbattle. The Shawnees were a formidable tribe, who had played a prominent\r\npart on many a bloody field. Cornstalk displayed great skill and courage\r\nat Point Pleasant. It is said that on the day before the battle he had\r\nproposed to his people to send messengers to General Lewis to see\r\nwhether a treaty of peace could be effected, but his followers rejected\r\nthe proposal. During the battle, when one of his warriors evinced a want\r\nof firmness, he slew him with one blow of his tomahawk; and during the\r\nday his sonorous voice was heard amid the din of arms exclaiming, in his\r\nnative tongue, \"Be strong, be strong.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the battle General Lewis buried his dead. They were\r\ninterred without the pomp of war, but the cheeks of hardy mountaineers\r\nwere bedewed with tears at the fate of their brave comrades. \"The dead\r\nbodies of the Indians who fell in battle were left to decay on the\r\nground where they expired, or to be devoured by birds or beasts of prey.\r\nThe mountain eagle, lord of the feathered race, while from his lofty\r\ncairn with piercing eye he surveyed the varied realms around and far\r\nbeneath, would not fail to descry the sumptuous feast prepared for his\r\nuse. Here he might whet his beak, and feast, and fatten, and exult. Over\r\nthese the gaunt wolf, grim tyrant of the forest, might prolong his\r\nmidnight revelry and howl their funeral dirge. While far remote in the\r\ndeepest gloom of the wilderness, whither they had fled for safety, the\r\nsurviving warriors might wail their fate, or chant a requiem to their\r\ndeparted spirits.\"[587:A]\r\n\r\nGeneral Lewis, after caring for the wounded, erected a small fort at\r\nPoint Pleasant, and leaving a garrison there, marched to overtake\r\nDunmore, who, with a thousand men, lay entrenched at Camp Charlotte,\r\ncalled after the queen, near the Shawnee town, (Chilicothe,) on the\r\nbanks of the Scioto. The Indians having sued to him for peace, his\r\nlordship determined to make a treaty with them, and sent orders to Lewis\r\nto halt, or, according to others, to return to Point Pleasant. Lewis,\r\nsuspecting the governor's good faith, and finding himself threatened by\r\na superior force of Indians, who hovered in his rear, disregarded the\r\norder, and advanced to within three miles of his camp. His lordship,\r\naccompanied by the Indian chief, White Eyes, visited the camp of Lewis,\r\nwho (as some report) with difficulty restrained his men from killing the\r\ngovernor and his Indian companion. Lewis, to his great chagrin, received\r\norders to return home with his troops, and he obeyed reluctantly, as it\r\nseemed a golden opportunity to give the savage enemy a fatal blow.\r\n\r\nGeneral Andrew Lewis lived on the Roanoke, in the County of Botetourt.\r\nHe was a native of Ireland, being one of five sons of John Lewis, who\r\nslew the Irish lord, settled Augusta County, founded the town of\r\nStaunton, and furnished several sons to fight the battles of their\r\ncountry. He was the son of Andrew Lewis and Mary Calhoun, his wife, and\r\nwas born in Donegal County, Ireland, (1678,) and died in Virginia,\r\n(1762,) aged eighty-four: a brave man, and a firm friend of liberty. All\r\nhis sons were born in Ireland except Charles, the youngest. Andrew Lewis\r\nwas twice wounded at Fort Necessity; was appointed by Washington major\r\nof his regiment during the French and Indian war, and no officer more\r\nfully enjoyed his confidence. Major Lewis commanded the Sandy Creek\r\nexpedition in 1756, and was made prisoner at Grant's defeat, where he\r\nexhibited signal prudence and bravery. His fortitude while a prisoner\r\nwas equal to his courage in battle, and commanded the respect of the\r\nFrench officers. He was upwards of six feet in stature, of uncommon\r\nactivity and strength, and of a form of exact symmetry. His countenance\r\nwas stern and invincible, his deportment reserved and distant. When he\r\nwas a commissioner on behalf of Virginia at the treaty of Fort Stanwix,\r\nin New York, in 1768, the governor of that colony remarked of him, that\r\n\"the earth seemed to tremble under him as he walked along.\" At the\r\ncommencement of the revolutionary war Washington considered him the\r\nforemost military man in America, and the one most worthy of the post of\r\ncommander-in-chief of the American army. And it was to the country\r\nbeyond the mountains that Washington looked as a place of refuge, in\r\ncase he should be overpowered in the struggle, and there, defended by\r\nmountains and mountaineers, he hoped to defy the enemy. The statue of\r\nGeneral Andrew Lewis is one of those to be placed on the monument in the\r\ncapitol square, in Richmond.[589:A]\r\n\r\nDunmore remaining after the departure of Lewis, concluded a treaty with\r\nthe Indians. Upon this occasion Cornstalk, in a long speech, charged the\r\nwhites with having provoked the war, his tones of thunder resounding\r\nover a camp of twelve acres. The truth is that during the years which\r\nelapsed between Bouquet's treaty of 1764 and open war in 1774, a period\r\nof nominal peace was one of frequent actual collision and hostilities,\r\nand more lives were sacrificed on the frontier by the murderous Indians\r\nthan during the whole of the year 1774, including the battle of Point\r\nPleasant.[589:B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[582:A] Or \"River of the Woods,\" as the word signifies, or New River, as\r\nit was also sometimes called.\r\n\r\n[582:B] Styled by Stuart, in his \"Memoir of Indian Wars,\" Fort Savannah.\r\n\r\n[583:A] Memoir of Battle of Point Pleasant, by Samuel L.

During the course of the last long and bloody war Logan remained\r\nidle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the\r\nwhites that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, 'Logan is\r\nthe friend of white men.' I have even thought to have lived with you,\r\nbut for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in\r\ncold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not\r\nsparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in\r\nthe veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have\r\nsought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my\r\ncountry I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought\r\nthat mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on\r\nhis heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\"\r\nTah-gah-jute, or Logan, so named after James Logan, the secretary of\r\nPennsylvania, was the son of Shikellamy, a celebrated Cayuga chief, who\r\ndwelt at Shamokin, on the picturesque banks of the Susquehanna. When\r\nLogan grew to man's estate, living in the vicinity of the white\r\nsettlers, he appears, about the year 1767, to have found the means of\r\nhis livelihood in hunting deer, dressing their skins, and selling them.\r\nWhen the daughter of a neighboring gentleman was just beginning to walk,\r\nher mother one day happening to say that she was sorry that she could\r\nnot get a pair of shoes for her, Logan, who stood by, said nothing then,\r\nbut soon after requested that the little girl might be allowed to go and\r\nspend the day at his cabin, which stood on a sequestered spot near a\r\nbeautiful spring (yet known as \"Logan's Spring.\") The mother's heart\r\nwas at the first a little disconcerted at the singular proposal; but\r\nsuch was her confidence in the Indian that she consented. The day wore\r\naway; the sun had gone down behind the mountains in parting splendor,\r\nand evening was folding her thoughtful wing,--and the little one had not\r\nyet returned. Just at this moment the Indian was seen descending the\r\npath with his charge, and quickly she was in her mother's arms, and\r\npointing proudly to a beautiful pair of moccasins on her tiny feet, the\r\nproduct of Logan's skilful manufacture.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards he removed to the far West, and he was remembered by\r\nan old pioneer as \"the best specimen of humanity, white or red, that he\r\nhad ever seen.\"[591:A] In 1772 the Rev. Mr. Heckwelder, Moravian\r\nmissionary, met with Logan on the Beaver River, and took him to be an\r\nIndian of extraordinary capacity. He exclaimed against the whites for\r\nthe introduction of ardent spirits among his people, and regretted that\r\nthey had so few gentlemen among their neighbors; and declared his\r\nintention to settle on the Ohio, where he might live forever in peace\r\nwith the whites; but confessed that he himself was too fond of the\r\nfirewater. In the following year Heckwelder visited Logan's settlement,\r\nbelow the Big Beaver, and was kindly entertained by such members of his\r\nfamily as were at home. About the same time another missionary, the Rev.\r\nDr. David McClure, met with Logan at Fort Pitt. \"Tah-gah-jute, or\r\n'Short-dress,' for such was his Indian name, stood several inches more\r\nthan six feet in height; he was straight as an arrow; lithe, athletic,\r\nand symmetrical in figure; firm, resolute, and commanding in feature;\r\nbut the brave, open, manly countenance he possessed in his earlier years\r\nwas now changed for one of martial ferocity.\" He spoke the English\r\nlanguage with fluency and correctness. The victim of intemperance,\r\npointing to his breast, he exclaimed to the missionary, \"I feel bad\r\nhere. Wherever I go the evil Manethoes pursue me;\" and he earnestly\r\nenquired, \"What shall I do?\" Logan's family were massacred by a party of\r\nwhites in the spring of 1774, perhaps under the pretext of retaliation\r\nfor some Indian murders. But the charge against Cresap appears to have\r\nbeen unfounded. Logan's family being on a visit to a family of the name\r\nof Great-house, were murdered by them and their associates, under\r\ncircumstances of extraordinary cowardice and brutality. The mistake is\r\none into which Logan might, in view of some recent transactions that had\r\nhappened under the command of Captain Cresap, naturally fall, and which\r\ndoes not at all impair the force of his speech. Mr. Jefferson meeting\r\nwith a copy of it at Governor Dunmore's, in Williamsburg, transcribed it\r\nin his pocket-book, and afterwards immortalized it in his \"Notes on\r\nVirginia.\" He gave implicit confidence to its authenticity. Doddridge is\r\nof the same opinion. Jacob, in his Life of Cresap,[592:A] insinuates\r\nthat the speech was a counterfeit, and declares that Cresap was as\r\nhumane as brave, and had no participation in the massacre. General\r\nGeorge Rogers Clarke, who was well acquainted with Logan and Cresap\r\nboth, vouches for the substantial truth of Mr. Jefferson's story of\r\nLogan. Devoting himself to the work of revenge, he, with others,\r\nbutchered men, women, and children; knives, tomahawks, and axes were\r\nleft in the breasts which had been cleft asunder; females were stripped,\r\nand outraged, too horrible to mention; brains of infants beaten out and\r\nthe dead bodies left a prey to the beasts of the forest. The family of a\r\nsettler on the north fork of the Holston was massacred, and a war-club\r\nwas left in the house, and attached to it the following note, which had\r\nbeen previously, at Logan's dictation, written for him by one Robinson,\r\na prisoner:--\r\n\r\n     \"CAPTAIN CRESAP:\r\n\r\n     \"What did you kill my people on Yellow Creek for? The white\r\n     people killed my kin at Conestoga a great while ago, and I\r\n     thought nothing of that. But you killed my kin again on Yellow\r\n     Creek, and took my cousin prisoner. Then I thought I must kill\r\n     too; and I have been three times to war since; but the Indians\r\n     are not angry--only myself.\r\n\r\n                                             \"CAPTAIN JOHN LOGAN.\r\n\r\n     \"July 21st, 1774.\"\r\n\r\nThirty scalps it was known that he took in these murderous raids, but\r\nhe joined not in open battle.\r\n\r\nSimon Kenton, a native of Fauquier County, a voyager of the woods, was\r\nemployed by Dunmore as a spy (together with Simon Girty) during this\r\ncampaign, in the course of which he traversed the country around Fort\r\nPitt, and a large part of the present State of Ohio. His history is full\r\nof daring adventure, cruel sufferings, and extraordinary turns of\r\nfortune. He was eight times made to run the Indian gauntlet; three times\r\nbound to the stake. He was with Clarke in his expedition against\r\nVincennes and Kaskaskia; and with Wayne in the campaign of 1794. He died\r\nin Ohio, in poverty and neglect, his once giant frame bowed down with\r\nage.[593:A] Girty, after playing for a time the spy on both sides in the\r\nrevolutionary contest, became at length an adherent of the enemy, and\r\nproved, toward his countrymen, a cruel and barbarous miscreant, in whom\r\nevery sentiment of humanity appears to have been extinct. Kenton and\r\nGirty are both good subjects for a novelist.\r\n\r\nSuspicions were not wanting in the minds of many Virginians, especially\r\nthe inhabitants of the west, that the frontier had been embroiled in the\r\nIndian war by Dunmore's machinations; and that his ultimate object was\r\nto secure an alliance with the savages to aid England in the expected\r\ncontest with the colonies; and these suspicions were strengthened by his\r\nequivocal conduct during the campaign. He was also accused of fomenting,\r\nwith the same sinister views, the boundary altercations between\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia on the northwestern frontier. These charges\r\nand suspicions do not appear to be sustained by sufficient proof. It is\r\nprobable that in these proceedings his lordship was prompted rather by\r\nmotives of personal interest than of political manoeuvre. His agent,\r\nDr. Conolly, was locating large tracts of land on the borders of the\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nBy the Quebec Act of 1774 Great Britain, with a view of holding the\r\ncolonies in check, established the Roman Catholic religion in Canada,\r\nand enlarged its bounds so as to comprise all the territory northwest of\r\nthe Ohio to the head of Lake Superior and the Mississippi. This attempt\r\nto extend the jurisdiction of Canada to the Ohio was especially\r\noffensive to Virginia. Richard Henry Lee, in congress, denounced it as\r\nthe worst of all the acts complained of. In Virginia, Dunmore's avarice\r\ngetting the better of his loyalty, he espoused her claims to western\r\nlands, and became a partner in enormous purchases in Southern Illinois.\r\nIn 1773 Thomas and Cuthbert Bullet, his agents, made surveys of lands at\r\nthe falls of the Ohio; and a part of Louisville and of towns opposite to\r\nCincinnati are yet held under his warrant.\r\n\r\nMurray, a grandson of the Earl of Dunmore, and page to Queen Victoria,\r\nvisited the United States partly, it was said, for the purpose of making\r\nenquiry relative to western lands, the title of which was derived from\r\nhis grandfather. Young Murray visited some of the old seats on the\r\nJames, and makes mention of them in his entertaining \"Travels in the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly, upon the return of Dunmore to Williamsburg, gave him a\r\nvote of thanks for his good conduct of the war--a compliment which it\r\nwas afterwards doubted whether he had merited. His motives in that\r\ncampaign were, to say the least, somewhat mysterious. There is a curious\r\ncoincidence in several points between the administration of Dunmore and\r\nthat of Berkley, one hundred years before.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[591:A] Tah-gah-jute, or Logan, and Captain Michael Cresap: a Discourse\r\nby Brantz Mayer.

In the\r\nyear 1769 he left his home on the sequestered Yadkin, to wander through\r\nthe wilderness in quest of the country of Kentucky, and to become the\r\narchetype of the race of pioneers. In this exploration of the unknown\r\nregions of Western Virginia, he was accompanied by five companions.\r\nReaching Red River early in June, they beheld from an eminence the\r\nbeautiful region of Kentucky. A pioneer named Finley is supposed by some\r\nto have been the first explorer of the interior of Kentucky, and it is\r\nsaid that he visited it alone; it is difficult to determine a matter of\r\nthis kind, and the first exploration has been attributed to others.\r\nAccording to McClung,[595:A] it was Finley's glowing picture of the\r\ncountry, on his return home, in 1767, that allured Boone to venture into\r\nthe wilderness. Kentucky, it appears, was not inhabited by the Indians,\r\nthey having not a wigwam there; but the Southern and Northwestern\r\nIndians resorted there, as on a neutral ground, to hunt, and often came\r\ninto collision and engaged in conflicts, which, according to some, gave\r\nit the name of Kentucky, or \"the dark and bloody ground;\" but the true\r\nsignification of the word is a matter of doubt. Boone and his companions\r\nencamping, began to hunt and to reconnoitre the country. Innumerable\r\nbuffaloes browned on the leaves of the cane, or pastured on the herbage\r\nof the plains, or lingered on the border of the salt-lick. In December,\r\nBoone and a comrade, John Stuart, rambling in the magnificence of\r\nforests yet unscarred by the axe, were surprised by a party of Indians\r\nand captured. Boone met the catastrophe with a mien of stoical\r\nindifference. A week after the capture the party encamped in the\r\nevening in a thick cane-brake, and having built a large fire, lay down\r\nto rest. About midnight, Boone gently awaking his companion, they\r\neffected their escape, traversing the forest by the uncertain light of\r\nthe stars, and by observing the mossy side of the trees. Returning to\r\ntheir camp they found it plundered and deserted; and the fate of its\r\noccupants could not be doubted. A brother of Boone, with another hardy\r\nadventurer, shortly after overtook the two forlorn survivors. It was not\r\nlong before Stuart was slain by the savages and scalped, and the\r\ncompanion of Boone's brother devoured by wolves. The two brothers\r\nremained in a wilderness untrod by the white man, surrounded by perils,\r\nand far from the reach of succor. With unshaken fortitude they continued\r\nto hunt, and erected a rude cabin to shelter them from the storms of\r\nwinter. When threatened by the approach of savages, they lay during the\r\nnight concealed in swamps. In May, 1770, Boone's brother returned home\r\nfor horses and ammunition, leaving him alone, without bread, salt, or\r\nsugar, or even a horse or a dog. Daniel Boone, in one of his solitary\r\nexcursions made at this time, wandered during the whole day through a\r\nregion whose native charms dispelled every gloomy thought. Just at the\r\nclose of day, when the gales were lulled, not a breath of air stirring\r\nthe leaves, he gained the summit of a commanding ridge, and, looking\r\naround, with delight beheld the ample regions mapped out beneath. On one\r\nhand he saw the beautiful Ohio delineating the western boundary of\r\nKentucky; while at a distance the mountains lifted their peaks to the\r\nclouds. All nature was still. He kindled a fire near a fountain of sweet\r\nwater, and feasted on the loin of a buck killed a few hours before. As\r\nnight folded her mysterious wings he heard the distant yells of savages;\r\nbut, worn out with fatigue, he fell asleep, and did not awake until the\r\nmorning beams were glancing through the forest glades, and the birds\r\nwarbling their matin songs. No populous city, with all its excitements\r\nand attractions, could have pleased him half so much as the charms of\r\nnature in Kentucky. Rejoined by his brother, in the summer of 1770, he\r\nexplored the valley of the Cumberland River. In 1771 Daniel Boone, after\r\nan absence of three years, returned to his home on the Yadkin; sold such\r\nof his possessions as he could not carry with him, and started with his\r\nfamily to return and settle in Kentucky. Some cows, horses, and\r\nhousehold utensils formed his baggage. His wife and children were\r\nmounted on horseback, their neighbors regarding them as doomed to\r\ncertain destruction. On the route he was re-enforced by five families,\r\nand forty armed men at Powell's Valley. In October the young men who had\r\ncharge of the pack-horses and cattle in the rear, were surprised by\r\nIndians, and of seven only one escaped; six were slain, and among them\r\nBoone's oldest son. This occurred near the gap of the Cumberland\r\nMountains, whose dark gorges, rocky cliffs, and hoary summits strike the\r\nmind of the beholder with awe. The Indians were repulsed with heavy\r\nloss; but the whites retired forty miles to the settlement on the Clinch\r\nRiver, where Boone with his family remained for some time. Virginia in\r\nvain demanded of the Cherokees the surrender of the offenders. One of\r\nBoone's party, in retaliation, afterwards slew an Indian at a horse-race\r\non the frontier, in spite of the interposition of the by-standers. In\r\n1774, at the request of Governor Dunmore, Boone, leaving his family on\r\nthe banks of the Clinch, went to assist in conveying a party of\r\nsurveyors to the falls of the Ohio. He was next employed in the command\r\nof three garrisons during the campaign against the Shawnees. In March of\r\nthe ensuing year, at the solicitation of some gentlemen of North\r\nCarolina, Boone, at the treaty of Watauga, purchased from the Cherokees\r\nof North Carolina the lands claimed by them, lying between the Kentucky\r\nRiver and the Tennessee. But Kentucky being within the chartered limits\r\nof Virginia, she[597:A] declared this treaty null and void, and\r\nproclaimed her own title. The North Carolina grantees, however, received\r\nin compensation a liberal grant of lands on Green River. Boone also\r\nundertook to mark out a road from the settlements to the wilderness of\r\nKentucky; during this work several of his men were killed by the\r\nsavages. In 1775 he erected a fort at Boonsborough, near the Kentucky\r\nRiver, and he removed his family there, and his wife and daughter were\r\nsupposed to be the first white women that ever stood upon the banks of\r\nthe Kentucky River; and Boonsborough was long an outpost of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Boone's career, full of stirring adventure, belongs\r\nrather to the early history of Kentucky. When the settlements around him\r\nbegan to grow too thick for his taste, he removed farther westward. This\r\nextraordinary man, who could neither read nor write, in 1792 dictated a\r\nbrief account of his life to some youthful writer, whose attempt to\r\nenhance the interest of the narrative by rhetorical embellishments\r\nafforded no little satisfaction to the unsophisticated old voyager of\r\nthe woods, and nothing pleased him better than to sit and listen to the\r\nreading of it. He would listen attentively, rub his hands together,\r\nsmile complacently and ejaculate, \"All true, every word true! not a lie\r\nin it.\" Solitary hunting, as it had been the charm of his earlier years,\r\nafforded him the solace of his old age; and when too old to walk through\r\nthe woods, he would ride to the edge of the salt-licks and lie there in\r\nambush for the sake of getting a shot at the deer. He was in person\r\nrough and robust; his countenance homely but kind; his manner cold,\r\ngrave, taciturn; his conversation simple and unobtrusive; he never\r\nspeaking of himself but when questioned. He was withal brave, humane,\r\nprudent, and modest.[598:A] He died in 1820, aged nearly ninety years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[595:A] Sketches of Western Adventure.\r\n\r\n[597:A] See Journal of Convention of '76.\r\n\r\n[598:A] McClung's Sketches of Western Adventure, 92.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\n1775.\r\n\r\n     Lord Dunmore--Second Convention--St. John's Church--Henry's\r\n     Resolutions--His Speech--Measures adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1775 the people of Virginia were in a state of\r\nanxious suspense, expecting an outbreak of civil war. Dunmore remained\r\nin gloomy solicitude in his palace, tenacious of authority, but fearful\r\nof resisting the popular will. Intelligence was now continually received\r\nof commotions among the people; resolutions, essays, and speeches added\r\nnew fuel to the excitement.\r\n\r\nThe second Virginia convention assembled at Richmond, on Monday, the\r\ntwentieth day of March. St. John's Church, in which the sessions were\r\nheld, stands on Richmond Hill, commanding a panorama of Richmond, (then\r\na few straggling houses,) hills, and fields, and woods, and the James,\r\nwith its rocks and islands, flashing rapids and murmuring falls, and\r\npoetic mists. The convention approved of the proceedings of congress,\r\nand of the conduct of the Virginia delegates. Resolutions were adopted\r\nthanking the assembly of Jamaica[599:A] for their petition and memorial\r\nto the king in behalf of the colonies; and expressing Virginia's ardent\r\nwish for \"a speedy return of those halcyon days when they lived a free\r\nand happy people.\" The too abject tone of these resolutions aroused the\r\npatriotic indignation of Patrick Henry, and he introduced resolutions\r\nfor putting the colony immediately into a state of defence against the\r\nencroachments of Great Britain, and for embodying, arming, and\r\ndisciplining a force of well-regulated militia for that purpose. They\r\nwere supported by Henry, the mover, Jefferson, the Lees, Pages, Mason,\r\nand others; but many of the members recoiled with horror from this\r\nstartling measure; and it was strenuously resisted by Bland, Harrison,\r\nPendleton, Nicholas, and Wythe, who held such a step premature, until\r\nthe result of the last petition to the king should be more fully known.\r\nThey still flattered themselves with the hope that the breach might yet\r\nbe repaired in some way, either by the influence of the opposition in\r\nEngland, of the manufacturing interests, or the relenting of the king.\r\nThey urged that Virginia was unmilitary, unprovided for war, weak, and\r\ndefenceless, and insisted that desperate measures should not be resorted\r\nto, until hope herself had fled. Henry replied: \"What has there been in\r\nthe conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify\r\nhope? Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\r\nreconciliation? These are the implements of subjugation sent over to\r\nrivet upon us the chains which the British ministry have been so long\r\nforging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? We\r\nhave been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to\r\noffer? Shall we resort to entreaty and supplication? We have\r\npetitioned--we have remonstrated--we have supplicated; and we have been\r\nspurned from the foot of the throne. In vain may we indulge the fond\r\nhope of reconciliation. There is no longer room for hope. If we wish to\r\nbe free we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to\r\narms, and to the God of hosts, is all that is left us!\r\n\r\n\"They tell me that we are weak; but shall we gather strength by\r\nirresolution? We are not weak. Three millions of people armed in the\r\nholy cause of liberty, and in such a country, are invincible by any\r\nforce which our enemy can send against us. We shall not fight alone. A\r\njust God presides over the destinies of nations, and will raise up\r\nfriends for us. The battle is not to the strong alone; it is to the\r\nvigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, we have no election. If we\r\nwere base enough to desire it, it is too late to retire from the\r\ncontest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery. The war is\r\ninevitable--and let it come! let it come!\r\n\r\n\"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of\r\nchains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course\r\nothers may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death.\"\r\n\r\nHenry's voice, calm in his exordium, rose gradually to a higher and yet\r\nhigher pitch, until the very walls of the church seemed to rock and\r\ntremble, as if conscious of the tremendous vibrations. The listeners,\r\nforgetful of order and of themselves, leaned forward in their seats,\r\nmagnetized by the voice and look of the speaker, whose pale face and\r\nglaring eye assumed an appearance of preternatural emotion. His last\r\nexclamation, \"Give me liberty, or give me death,\" sounded like the shout\r\nof the warrior in the tempest of battle.[601:A] When Mr. Henry sat down\r\nevery eye remained still fixed on him, entranced and spell-bound.[601:B]\r\n\r\nRichard Henry Lee supported Mr. Henry in a masterly review of the\r\nresources of the colonies and their means of resistance, exhorting the\r\nconvention to remember that \"the race is not to the swift, nor the\r\nbattle to the strong, and that he is thrice armed whose cause is just.\"\r\n\"But,\" says Wirt, \"his melody was lost amid the agitations of that ocean\r\nwhich the master-spirit of the storm had lifted up on high.\" It would,\r\nhowever, be a wide mistake to believe that a melodious voice was Mr.\r\nLee's highest qualification as a speaker. Plain, solid, common sense was\r\nthe distinguishing characteristic of his mind as it was of Mr. Henry's.\r\n\r\nThe overweening caution of those who opposed Henry's resolutions perhaps\r\nserved the purpose of the breaks in a train of railroad cars--while they\r\nendeavored to retard the movement, they made it eventually safer. The\r\nresolutions were carried, and a committee was appointed to prepare a\r\nplan of defence.[601:C]\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a plan reported by the committee, the convention\r\nunanimously determined on the establishment of a well-regulated militia,\r\nby forming in every county one or more volunteer companies and troops\r\nof horse, to be in constant training and ready to act at a moment's\r\nwarning, and hence called \"minute-men.\" Mr. Nicholas, hitherto an\r\nextreme conservative, now proposed to raise an army of ten thousand\r\nregulars; the proposition evinced his enthusiasm in the cause; but the\r\nkind of force which he recommended still displayed his distrust in means\r\nof defence resting immediately on the body of the people. Measures were\r\nadopted by the convention to promote the raising of wool, cotton, flax,\r\nand hemp, and to encourage domestic manufactures of gunpowder, salt,\r\niron, and steel; and the members agreed to make use of home-made\r\nfabrics, and recommended the practice to the people. The former\r\ndelegates to congress were re-elected, with the substitution of Mr.\r\nJefferson in lieu of Peyton Randolph, in case of his non-attendance. Mr.\r\nRandolph, being speaker of the house of burgesses, did not attend that\r\ncongress, and Mr. Jefferson accordingly took his place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[599:A] Jamaica and New York were acquired by conquest.\r\n\r\n[601:A] Randall's Life of Jefferson, i. 101.\r\n\r\n[601:B] The expression, \"after all, we must fight,\" had been used four\r\nmonths before by Joseph Hawley, of Massachusetts, in a letter to John\r\nAdams, which he showed to Patrick Henry while they were together in the\r\nfirst congress. Henry, upon reading the words, raised his hand, and with\r\nan oath exclaimed, \"I am of that man's mind.\"\r\n\r\n[601:C] The committee consisted of Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee,\r\nRobert C. Nicholas, Benjamin Harrison, Lemuel Riddick, George\r\nWashington, Adam Stephen, Andrew Lewis, William Christian, Edmund\r\nPendleton, Thomas Jefferson, and Isaac Zane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON was born at Shadwell, in the County of Albemarle, on\r\nthe 2d day of April, 1743.[603:A] According to family tradition his\r\npaternal ancestors, among the early settlers of Virginia, came from near\r\nMount Snowden, in Wales, and one of them was a member of the first house\r\nof burgesses that met in 1619. The grandfather of Thomas lived at\r\nOsborne's, in Chesterfield. Peter, (father of Thomas,) a land surveyor,\r\nsettled at Shadwell, where he had taken up a tract of land, including\r\nMonticello. Shadwell was called after the parish in London in which his\r\nwife was born. He was born in February, 1708, and married, in 1738,\r\nJane, daughter of Isham Randolph, of Dungeness, in Goochland. \"The\r\nRandolphs,\" says Mr. Jefferson, \"trace their pedigree far back in\r\nEngland and Scotland, to which let every one ascribe the faith and merit\r\nhe chooses.\" Peter Jefferson's early education had been neglected, but\r\nbeing a man of strong parts he read much, and so improved himself that\r\nhe was chosen,[604:A] with Joshua Fry, professor of mathematics in\r\nWilliam and Mary College, to continue the boundary line between Virginia\r\nand North Carolina, and was afterwards employed, with Mr. Fry, to make a\r\nmap of the colony. This was the first regular map of Virginia ever made,\r\nthat of Captain Smith, although remarkably well delineated, considering\r\nthe circumstances under which it was made, being, of necessity, in large\r\npart conjectural.\r\n\r\nPeter Jefferson was one of the first persons who settled in Goochland,\r\nsince known as Albemarle, about the year 1737. That county was formed in\r\n1744 out of a part of Goochland, which had been carved out of Henrico in\r\n1727.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson's earliest recollection was of his being handed up and\r\ncarried on a pillow on horseback by a servant when his father was\r\nremoving, in 1745, from Shadwell to Tuckahoe. Peter Jefferson was a man\r\nof extraordinary physical strength; he could \"head up,\" that is raise up\r\nfrom their sides to an upright position, at once, two hogsheads of\r\ntobacco weighing near a thousand pounds each. He was a favorite with the\r\nIndians, and they often made his house a stopping-place, and in this way\r\nThomas imbibed an uncommon interest in that people.\r\n\r\nPeter Jefferson dying in 1757, left a widow (who survived till 1776)\r\nwith six daughters and two sons, of whom Thomas, then fourteen years of\r\nage, was the elder. He inherited the lands on which he was born, and\r\nwhere he lived. When five years of age, he was placed at school at\r\nTuckahoe, and when nine, upon the return of the family to Shadwell, at a\r\nLatin school, where he continued until his father's death. His teacher,\r\nthe Rev. William Douglas, a native of Scotland, taught him the rudiments\r\nof Latin, Greek, and French. At his father's death he was put under the\r\ncare of the Rev. James Maury, of Huguenot descent, a good classical\r\nscholar and thorough teacher, with whom he continued for two years at\r\nthe parsonage, fourteen miles from Shadwell.[605:A] The student found\r\nrecreation without in hunting on Peter's Mountain, within doors in\r\nplaying on the violin. In the spring of 1760 he went to William and Mary\r\nCollege, and remained there for two years. Dr. William Small, a\r\nScotchman, was then professor of mathematics there: a man of engaging\r\nmanners, large views, and profound science. He shortly afterwards\r\nfilled, for a time, the chair of ethics, rhetoric, and belles lettres.\r\nHe formed a strong attachment to young Jefferson, and made him the daily\r\ncompanion of his leisure hours, and it was his conversation that first\r\ngave him a bent toward scientific pursuits. Small returned, in 1762, to\r\nEurope. Before his departure he had procured for Jefferson, from George\r\nWythe, a reception as a student of law under his direction, and had also\r\nintroduced him to the acquaintance of Governor Fauquier. At his table\r\nJefferson met Dr. Small and Mr. Wythe, and from their conversation\r\nderived no little instruction. It was in 1765 that, while a law-student,\r\nhe heard the \"bloody debate\" on Henry's resolutions. In May of the\r\nfollowing year he made a northern trip, in a one-horse chair, by way of\r\nAnnapolis, where he found the people rejoicing at the repeal of the\r\nstamp act. At Philadelphia he was inoculated for the small-pox by Dr.\r\nShippen. At New York Mr. Jefferson became acquainted with Elbridge\r\nGerry.\r\n\r\nJefferson, now twenty-four years old, entered upon the practice of the\r\nlaw in the general court, and continued in it until the Revolution\r\nclosed the courts of justice. He was not fitted for the office of\r\nadvocate, owing to a defective voice, and he never spoke more than a\r\nfew sentences at a time.[606:A] In 1769 he became a member of the\r\nassembly, and so continued, patriotic, active, and ardent, until the\r\nmeetings were suspended by the war. He made an unsuccessful effort in\r\nthat body for the emancipation of the slaves in Virginia. January the\r\n1st, 1772, he married Martha, widow of Bathurst Skelton, and youngest\r\ndaughter of John Wayles, born in Lancaster, England, a lawyer, who lived\r\nat \"The Forest,\" in Charles City County. She was then twenty-three years\r\nold.[606:B] In 1773 Mr. Jefferson contributed to the formation of\r\ncommittees of correspondence between the colonial legislatures. In the\r\nyear following he was elected member of the convention which met in\r\nAugust. Unable to attend, owing to sickness, he communicated his views\r\nin the form of written instructions, for the Virginia delegates in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[603:A] Randall's Life of Jefferson gives the following extract from\r\nColonel Peter Jefferson's Book of Common Prayer:--\r\n\r\n     BIRTHS.\r\n\r\n     Jane Jefferson           1740, June      27.\r\n     Mary                     1741, October    1.\r\n     Thomas                   1743, April      2.\r\n     Elizabeth                1744, November   4.\r\n     Martha                   1746, May       29.\r\n     Peterfield               1748, October   16.\r\n     Ason                     1750, March      9.\r\n     Lucy                     1752, October   10.\r\n     Anna Scott Randolph      1755, October    1.\r\n\r\n     MARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n     Jane Jefferson\r\n     Mary                     1760, June      24.\r\n     Thomas                   1772, January    1.\r\n     Elizabeth\r\n     Martha                   1765, June      20.\r\n     Peterfield\r\n     Ason\r\n     Lucy                     1769, September 12.\r\n     Anna Scott Randolph      1788, October.\r\n\r\n     DEATHS.\r\n\r\n     Jane Jefferson           1765, October    1.\r\n     Mary\r\n     Thomas\r\n     Elizabeth                1773, January     1.\r\n     Martha\r\n     Peterfield               1748, November   29.\r\n     Ason                     1750, March       9.\r\n     Lucy\r\n     Anna Scott Randolph\r\n\r\n[604:A] 1749.\r\n\r\n[605:A] Where now stands the mansion of the late William F.

And\r\nin compliance with instructions received from England, the governor\r\nordered Captain Collins, with a party of marines and sailors from the\r\nMagdalen, lying at Burwell's Ferry, to remove the powder from the\r\nmagazine at Williamsburg, and it was carried on board of that vessel\r\nsecretly, between three and four o'clock A.M., of Thursday, April the\r\ntwentieth, the day following the collision at Lexington and Concord. It\r\nhad been rumored some days before in Williamsburg that Lord Dunmore had\r\ntaken the locks off from most of the guns in the magazine, and that he\r\nintended to remove the powder. The people of the town were alarmed, and\r\nthe volunteers for several nights kept guard over the magazine; at\r\nlength growing negligent, and disbelieving the report, on Thursday night\r\nthe guard was discharged at an early hour. Thus Collins with his party,\r\nwho had been secreted in the palace, seized the powder without\r\nopposition. Dunmore, anticipating the resentment of the people, armed\r\nhis servants and some Shawnee hostages, and muskets were laid on the\r\nfloor, loaded and primed, and the captains of the ships of war lying at\r\nYork were ordered to have in readiness an armed force for the defence of\r\nthe palace. As soon as these proceedings became known, the Williamsburg\r\nvolunteers flew to arms, and were with difficulty restrained by Peyton\r\nRandolph and Robert C. Nicholas from assaulting the palace and seizing\r\nthe governor. The authorities of the town, in accordance with a\r\nresolution of a meeting of the people, solicited the governor to restore\r\nthe powder immediately, urging among other reasons which demanded it,\r\nthe apprehension of a servile war, instigated by \"wicked and designing\r\nmen.\" Dunmore, in his reply, pretended that he had removed the powder\r\nfrom the magazine as being an insecure place in case of such an\r\ninsurrection;[608:A] declared that it should be returned as soon as it\r\nshould appear that the precaution was unnecessary; that in case of an\r\ninsurrection he would, upon his honor, return it in half an hour; but he\r\nexpressed his surprise that the people were under arms, and said that he\r\nshould not deem it prudent to put powder into their hands under such\r\ncircumstances. The reply was considered evasive and false. When he had\r\nfirst heard that the people were in arms, he swore, \"by the living God,\"\r\nthat if any violence should be offered to him, or to the officers who\r\nhad acted under his directions, he would proclaim freedom to the slaves,\r\nand lay the town in ashes. Some of the citizens, in consequence of this\r\nthreat, sent their wives and children into the country.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Williamsburg resolved unanimously to continue their\r\ncontributions for the relief of the inhabitants of Boston. Intelligence\r\nof these occurrences at the capital soon spread through the country.\r\nMore than six hundred volunteers met at Fredericksburg by the\r\ntwenty-seventh of April, and were ready to march to Williamsburg.\r\nGloucester and Henrico demanded the restitution of the powder, the\r\nGloucester men threatening, in case of refusal, to seize the governor.\r\nBedford offered a premium for the manufacture of gunpowder; the\r\nindependent company of Dumfries and the Albemarle volunteers were ready\r\nfor action. Dunmore renewed his threats, and was confident, as he wrote\r\nto Lord Dartmouth, the English minister, that \"with a small\r\nre-enforcement of troops and arms he could raise such a body of Indians,\r\nnegroes, and others as would reduce the refractory people of this colony\r\nto obedience.\"[608:B]\r\n\r\nThree citizens, deputed by the troops assembled at Fredericksburg,\r\nrepaired to Williamsburg for the purpose of ascertaining the real state\r\nof affairs, and to offer military assistance if desired. Peyton\r\nRandolph, in behalf of the corporation, in replying to the committee,\r\nstated that: \"Besides what has been said in his public answer, the\r\ngovernor has given private assurances to several gentlemen that the\r\npowder shall be returned to the magazine, though he has not condescended\r\nto fix the day for its return. So far as we can judge, from a comparison\r\nof all circumstances, the governor considers his honor at stake; he\r\nthinks that he acted for the best, and will not be compelled to what, we\r\nhave abundant reason to believe, he would cheerfully do, if left to\r\nhimself.\" \"If we then may be permitted to advise, it is our opinion and\r\nmost earnest request, that matters may be quieted for the present at\r\nleast; we are firmly persuaded that perfect tranquillity will be\r\nspeedily restored. By pursuing this course we foresee no hazard, or even\r\ninconvenience that can ensue. Whereas we are apprehensive, and this we\r\nthink upon good grounds, that violent measures may produce effects which\r\nGod only knows the consequence of.\"[609:A]\r\n\r\nUpon this reply being reported to the volunteers at Fredericksburg,\r\nstyled \"The friends of constitutional liberty in America,\" they declared\r\nthat it was dictated by fear, and resolved to march at all events to\r\nWilliamsburg, under command of Captain Hugh Mercer, who was eager to\r\nredress the indignity which Virginia had suffered at the hands of the\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Peyton Randolph happened to reach the house of Edmund\r\nPendleton, one of his colleagues, on his route to Philadelphia, where\r\nthe congress was about to meet. These two eminent men sent to\r\nFredericksburg, on Saturday, the twenty-ninth, a letter advising that\r\nfurther action should be deferred until the congress should adopt a plan\r\nof resistance. Mercer, who had written to Washington for advice,\r\nreceived a reply to the same effect. One hundred and two deputies were\r\nappointed a council to consider this advice, and after a long and\r\nanimated discussion it was assented to by a majority of one vote\r\nonly.[609:B]\r\n\r\nThe military, consisting of fourteen companies of light-horse, for\r\nseveral days were encamped in the fields near the town, armed and\r\nequipped, and they acquiesced reluctantly in the determination not to\r\nmarch at once to the capital. The Virginians were at the same time\r\narming in other parts of the country to re-enforce, whenever necessary,\r\nthose who had first taken up arms; troops were collected at the Bowling\r\nGreen, and others on their march from Frederick, Berkley, Dunmore, and\r\nother counties, were arrested, by information that the affair of the\r\ngunpowder was about to be accommodated. The council of one hundred and\r\ntwo, before adjourning, adopted an address pledging themselves to\r\nre-assemble whenever necessary, and by force of arms to defend the laws,\r\nliberties, and rights of Virginia, or any sister colony, from unjust and\r\nwicked invasion. This address was read at the head of each company, and\r\nit concluded with the significant words, \"God save the liberties of\r\nAmerica!\"\r\n\r\nThe council at this time consisted of President Nelson, Commissary Camm,\r\nRalph Wormley, Colonel G. Corbin, G. Corbin, Jr., William Byrd, and John\r\nPage. Being summoned to hold a meeting, they assembled as usual in the\r\ncouncil chamber, but Dunmore requested their attendance at the palace.\r\nHe excused his removal of the powder as owing to his fear that the\r\nvolunteers might have been tempted to seize upon the magazine; he\r\ncomplained that his life had been exposed to danger in the recent\r\ndisturbances, and he recommended the issuing of a proclamation. John\r\nPage, the youngest member, boldly advised the governor to give up the\r\npowder and arms, as the measure necessary to restore public\r\ntranquillity. Dunmore, enraged, struck the table with his fist,\r\nexclaiming, \"Mr. Page, I am astonished at you.\" The other councillors\r\nremained silent. Page, although he had been made a member of the council\r\nby Dunmore, had, nevertheless, opposed his nomination of John Randolph\r\nas one of the board of visiters of the college, declaring \"that as he\r\nhad been rejected on a former occasion as not possessing the disposition\r\nand character, moral and religious, which the charter and statutes of\r\nthe college required, he ought not again to be nominated, till it could\r\nbe proved that he had abandoned his former principles and practices,\r\nwhich no one could venture to say he had.\" Mr. Page had then proposed\r\nNathaniel Burwell in the place of the governor's nominee, and he was\r\nelected, the governor alone dissenting. This proceeding gave great\r\noffence to Dunmore and his secretary, Foy. Foy showed his resentment so\r\noffensively, that, says Page, \"I was obliged to call him to account for\r\nit, and he, like a brave and candid man, made full reparation to me and\r\nmy my friend, James Innes.\"\r\n\r\nIn Hanover the committee of safety for the county, and the members of\r\nthe Independent Company, at the call of Patrick Henry, met at New Castle\r\non the second day of May, and were addressed by him with such effect\r\nthat they resolved either to recover the powder or make a reprisal for\r\nit.[611:A]\r\n\r\nBurk[611:B] says: \"The affair of the powder was decided before the\r\nbattle of Lexington was ever talked of in Virginia.\" But as it appears\r\nthat the express from Massachusetts reached Petersburg on Sunday, the\r\nfirst of May,[611:C] it is probable that Henry had already heard the\r\nnews. Captain Meredith resigned in Henry's favor, and he was invested\r\nwith the command, Meredith accepting the place of lieutenant. Having\r\nreceived orders from the committee consonant with his own suggestions,\r\nCaptain Henry marched at once toward Williamsburg. Ensign Parke Goodall,\r\nwith sixteen men, was detached into King and Queen County to Laneville,\r\n(on the Matapony,) the seat of Richard Corbin, the king's deputy\r\nreceiver-general, to demand the estimated value of the powder, and in\r\ncase of his refusal to make him a prisoner. The detachment reached\r\nLaneville about midnight, and a guard was stationed around the house. At\r\ndaybreak Mrs. Corbin assured Goodall that the king's money was never\r\nkept there, but at Williamsburg, and that Colonel Corbin was then in\r\nthat town. Henry had started from Hanovertown with only his own company,\r\nbut the news of his march being speedily spread abroad, companies\r\nstarted up on all sides, and were in motion to join his standard, to the\r\nnumber, it was believed, of several, some say five thousand men. The\r\ncolony was governed by county committees. Lady Dunmore, with her\r\nchildren, retired in dismay to the Fowey, lying at Yorktown. Even the\r\npatriots at Williamsburg were alarmed at the approach of this tornado;\r\nmessage after message was despatched, and Captain Henry was implored to\r\ndesist from entering Williamsburg. The messengers were detained, and he\r\nmarched on. The scene resembled that presented by Bacon marching against\r\nBerkley a hundred years before. Dunmore, in the mean time, issued a\r\nproclamation calling upon the people to resist Henry, and planted cannon\r\nat his palace, and ordered up a detachment of marines from the Fowey.\r\nBefore daybreak on the fourth of May, Captain Montague, of that ship,\r\nlanded the detachment, and addressed a note to President Nelson, saying\r\nthat he had received certain information that Lord Dunmore was\r\nthreatened with an attack to be made at daybreak on that morning at the\r\npalace, and requesting him to endeavor to prevent any assault upon the\r\nmarines, as in case of it he should be compelled to fire upon the town\r\nof York.\r\n\r\nHenry, with one hundred and fifty men, halted at Doncastle's Ordinary,\r\n(sixteen miles from Williamsburg,) where Goodall had been ordered to\r\nrejoin him. In the meanwhile the authorities of the town were concerting\r\nmeasures to prevent the threatened collision. Dunmore denounced Henry as\r\na rebel and the author of all the disturbances, and poured out a tirade\r\nof profane threats and abuse. Nevertheless, at his instance, Carter\r\nBraxton, son-in-law to Colonel Corbin, repaired to Henry's headquarters\r\non the third, and interposed his efforts to prevent matters from coming\r\nto extremities. Finding that Henry would not disband without receiving\r\nthe powder or its equivalent, he returned to Williamsburg, and procured\r\nfrom Colonel Corbin, the deputy receiver-general, a bill of exchange for\r\nthe amount demanded, and delivering it to Henry at sunrise of Wednesday\r\nthe fourth, succeeded in warding off the impending blow.[612:A] In this\r\npacific course Mr. Braxton coincided with the moderate councils of the\r\nleading men at Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nYorktown and Williamsburg being in commotion at the landing of the\r\nmarines, and an attack upon the public treasury being apprehended, Henry\r\nwrote to Nicholas, the treasurer, offering the services of his force to\r\nremove the public treasury to any place in the colony which might be\r\ndeemed a safer place of deposite than Williamsburg. The treasurer\r\nreplied that he did not apprehend any necessity for such a guard, and\r\nthat the people of Williamsburg \"were perfectly quiet;\" which, however,\r\ncould hardly have been the case, because at that time more than a\r\nhundred citizens patroled the streets and guarded the treasury.[613:A]\r\n\r\nHenry, having attained the object of his march, returned with his\r\nvolunteers to Hanover. The committee presented their thanks to the party\r\nfor their good conduct, and also to the numerous volunteers who were\r\nmarching to lend their co-operation.\r\n\r\nParke Goodall was a member of the convention of 1788, and afterwards\r\nkept a tavern called the \"Indian Queen,\" in the City of Richmond.[613:B]\r\n\r\nThe contest between Henry and Dunmore concerning the powder, is like\r\nthat between Colonel Hutchinson and Lord Newark on a similar occasion in\r\n1642, at Nottingham, as related by Mrs. Hutchinson in her charming\r\nmemoirs of her husband--[613:C]the most beautiful monument ever erected\r\nby female affection.\r\n\r\nTwo days after Henry had received compensation for the powder, Dunmore\r\nissued a proclamation denouncing \"a certain Patrick Henry, Jr., of\r\nHanover,\" and a number of deluded followers, charging them with having\r\nunlawfully taken up arms, and by letters excited the people in divers\r\nparts of the country to join them in these outrageous and rebellious\r\npractices, extorting £330 from the king's receiver-general, and\r\nforbidding all persons to aid or abet \"the said Patrick Henry, Jr.,\" or\r\nhis confederates. The members of the council, with the exception of John\r\nPage, sided with the governor, and advised the issuing of the\r\nproclamation, and afterwards published an address, in which they\r\nexpressed their \"detestation and abhorrence for that licentious and\r\nungovernable spirit that had gone forth and misled the once happy people\r\nof this country.\" The council now shared the public odium with Dunmore.\r\nThere was a rumor that he intended to have Henry arrested on his way to\r\nthe congress at Philadelphia; and it is also said that the governor\r\ndenounced Henry as a coward for not having accompanied Randolph and\r\nPendleton. Dunmore, writing to the ministry, described Henry as \"a man\r\nof desperate circumstances, one who had been very active in encouraging\r\ndisobedience and exciting a spirit of revolt among the people for many\r\nyears past.\"[614:A] So in Massachusetts Samuel Adams, the model patriot\r\nof New England, was denounced by the British governor there. Henry set\r\nout for the congress May the eleventh, and was escorted in triumph by\r\nhis admiring countrymen as far as Hooe's Ferry, on the Potomac, and was\r\nrepeatedly stopped on the way to receive addresses full of thanks and\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[608:A] There had been an alarm of one from Surrey County.\r\n\r\n[608:B] Bancroft, vii. 277.\r\n\r\n[609:A] Letter dated at Williamsburg April 27th, 1775, to Mann Page,\r\nJr., Lewis Willis, and Benjamin Grymes, in S.

The patriotism, intelligence, and courage\r\nof the Scotch-Irish inhabitants of Mecklenburg--the Alexanders, Brevard,\r\nPolk, Balch, and others, are universally acknowledged; and that they\r\n\"acted\" independence as early as May, 1775, is admitted. But that they\r\nthen made an absolute declaration of independence, (supposing them\r\ncompetent to do so,) does not appear to be substantiated by sufficient\r\nevidence. The original manuscript, it is alleged, was preserved by the\r\nsecretary of the convention till the year 1800, when it was destroyed,\r\nwith his dwelling-house, by fire.[615:C] It is said, however, that he\r\nhad previously taken care to give copies of it to two or three persons;\r\nand mention is made of one of these transcripts as early as 1793. But\r\nthey do not appear to have been any further multiplied. That a\r\ndeclaration of independence, made more than a year before that of July,\r\n1776, should have been preserved by the secretary so long, and yet have\r\nremained unpublished and so little known, is extraordinary. It is\r\nremarkable, too, that such a paper should appear without date of time on\r\nthe face of it. The meeting reported to have been held at Charlotte, on\r\nthe twentieth of May, is styled \"the convention;\" but that of the\r\nthirty-first of the same kind, was simply a meeting of the committee of\r\nthe county, and was so called at the time. It is asserted that the\r\nimmediate exciting cause of the resolutions, or alleged declaration of\r\nthe twentieth, was, that on that day a messenger arrived in hot haste\r\nwith intelligence of the battle of Lexington. But it appears[616:A] that\r\nthis intelligence reached Savannah, in Georgia, on the tenth; and it\r\nwould appear hardly probable that it should have reached Charlotte ten\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nUpon comparing one of the manuscript copies with the one published in\r\nMartin's History of North Carolina, there appears to be a remarkable\r\ndifference between them. To explain this, it has, indeed, been\r\nconjectured, that Martin's copy contains the resolutions as at first\r\ndraughted by Dr. Brevard, the author of them, and that the other\r\ncontains them in their amended form. But the Martin copy, instead of\r\nbeing a rough draught, appears to be more formal and complete than the\r\nother. The Martin copy expresses the resolution in the present tense;\r\nthe other in the imperfect, bearing upon its face the appearance of\r\nhaving been made up at a subsequent time by an effort of recollection.\r\n\r\nThe document styled a declaration, whatever may have been its origin, or\r\nterms, remained long in obscurity, public attention having been first\r\ndrawn to it, in 1819, by the _Raleigh Register_, at the instance of\r\nColonel Thomas Polk. But a declaration, to effect its object, must be\r\npublished far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe Mecklenburg committee met at Charlotte on the thirtieth of May, and\r\npassed a series of resolutions, (making no reference whatever to a\r\nprevious declaration of independence;) suspending the former civil\r\nconstitution, and organizing a provisional republican government. The\r\neighteenth resolution is in these words: \"That these resolves be in full\r\nforce and virtue, until instructions from the provincial congress\r\nregulating the jurisprudence of the province shall provide otherwise, or\r\nthe legislative body of Great Britain resign its unjust and arbitrary\r\npretentions with respect to America:\" thus explicitly recognizing the\r\nright of eminent domain as belonging to Great Britain. It is not to be\r\ncredited that the Mecklenburg patriots made an absolute declaration of\r\nindependence on the twentieth, and in ten days thereafter acknowledged\r\nthe sovereignty of Great Britain. These admirable resolutions of the\r\nthirtieth were published in the _Mercury_, a North Carolina newspaper,\r\n(and others,) and a copy of it was transmitted by Governor Tryon\r\nto the British minister, and denounced as the boldest of all, \"most\r\ntraitorously declaring the entire dissolution of the laws and\r\nconstitution, and setting up a system of rule and regulation subversive\r\nof his majesty's government.\" The alleged declaration of the twentieth,\r\nbrief and absolute, was published in no newspaper, and was not denounced\r\nby the governor; while the resolutions of the thirty-first, recognizing\r\nthe sovereignty of Great Britain, were so published and denounced.\r\nMecklenburg, in North Carolina, was, nevertheless, then unquestionably\r\nin a condition of actual self-government and virtual independence; and\r\nthe names of Brevard, the master-spirit of the Charlotte Convention,\r\n(afterwards a patriot-martyr,) and of his compatriots, stand on the page\r\nof history in characters of recorded honor which need no adventitious\r\nlustre.[617:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[615:A] Its authenticity was admitted in the former edition of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[615:B] Especially by Mr. Grigsby, in his Discourse on the Virginia\r\nConvention of '76, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[615:C] Foote's Sketches of North Carolina, 205.\r\n\r\n[616:A] Bancroft, vii. 337.\r\n\r\n[617:A] Grigsby's Convention of Va. of '76; Martin's Hist. of N.

Peyton Randolph was again elected\r\npresident, but finding it necessary to return to Virginia to perform the\r\nduties of speaker, was succeeded by the well-tried patriot, John\r\nHancock. Many of the leading members, including Washington, still hoped\r\nfor reconciliation with the mother country, and few as yet avowed\r\nthemselves in favor of independence. But while the congress were pacific\r\nin theory, they were revolutionary in action. A second petition to the\r\nking was adopted; but, at the same time, a federal union was organized,\r\nand the executive power vested in a council of twelve. Measures were\r\ntaken for enlisting troops, erecting forts, providing military stores,\r\nand issuing a paper currency. Massachusetts was advised to form an\r\ninternal government for herself. Washington was chairman of the military\r\ncommittees, and the regulations of the army and defensive measures were\r\nmostly devised by him.\r\n\r\nShortly after the affair of the gunpowder, the public agitations were\r\nagain quieted upon the reception of Lord North's conciliatory\r\nproposition, commonly called the \"Olive Branch;\" and Dunmore convened\r\nthe burgesses, and Lady Dunmore and her family returned (to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the people) from the Fowey, where they had taken refuge\r\nduring these disturbances, to the palace. The assembly meeting on the\r\nfirst day of June, the governor presented Lord North's proposition. The\r\ncouncil's answer was satisfactory; but before the burgesses could reply,\r\na new explosion occurred. Upon Henry's recent approach toward\r\nWilliamsburg some of the inhabitants, to the great offence of the graver\r\ncitizens, had taken possession of a few of the guns remaining in the\r\nmagazine. On the night of June the fifth a number of persons having\r\nassembled there to furnish themselves with arms, some of them were\r\nwounded by spring-guns placed there by order of the governor. Besides\r\nthis, some barrels of powder were found buried in the magazine, to be\r\nused, it was suspected, as a mine when occasion should offer. Early on\r\nthe next morning Lord Dunmore, with his family, escaped from\r\nWilliamsburg to return no more, and took shelter on board of the Fowey,\r\nleaving behind him a message to the house, ascribing his departure to\r\napprehensions of personal danger, and declaring his willingness to\r\nco-operate with the assembly in the public business. That body, by a\r\ndeputation, requested him to return to the palace, assuring him that\r\nthey would unite in whatever measures might be necessary for the\r\nprotection of him and his family. Dunmore in reply complained of the\r\ninimical spirit of the burgesses toward him, of the countenance which\r\nthey had given to the disorderly proceedings of the people, of his\r\nmajesty's magazine having been broken open and rifled in the presence of\r\nmembers of the house; he further said that while some endeavors had been\r\nmade by the committee of the house to prevail upon the people to restore\r\nthe arms, no steps had been taken to bring the offenders to justice;\r\nthat a body of men had assembled at Williamsburg for the purpose of\r\nattacking the king's troops, and that guards had been mounted under\r\nfalse pretences. He exhorted them to return to their constitutional\r\nduty; to open the courts of justice; to disband the independent\r\ncompanies; and to put an end to the persecutions of his majesty's loyal\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe governor at the same time communicated papers containing terms upon\r\nwhich a reconciliation might take place--placing his return upon the\r\ncondition of their acceptance of the \"Olive Branch.\" The assembly in\r\ntheir reply, composed by Mr. Jefferson, declared that next to the\r\npreservation of liberty, a reconciliation would be the greatest of all\r\nhuman blessings; but that they could not consent to the proposed terms.\r\nLeaving the determination of these disputes to the wisdom of congress,\r\nfor themselves they avowed that they had exhausted every means for\r\nobtaining redress; they had remonstrated to parliament, and parliament\r\nhad only added new oppressions to the old; they had wearied the king\r\nwith petitions which he had not deigned to answer; they had appealed to\r\nthe native honor and justice of the British nation, but their efforts in\r\nfavor of the colonies had as yet proved ineffectual. Nothing remained\r\nbut to commit their cause to the even-handed justice of Him who doeth no\r\nwrong, \"earnestly beseeching him to illuminate the counsels and prosper\r\nthe endeavors of those to whom America hath confided her hopes, that\r\nthrough their wise direction we may again see re-united the blessings of\r\nliberty and property, and the most permanent harmony with Great\r\nBritain.\"\r\n\r\nThe courts of justice upon Dunmore's flight had been closed, the general\r\ncourt refusing to transact business, under the pretext that the fees of\r\nofficers could not be legally taxed without an act of assembly--the real\r\nground being, it is said, the desire of bringing about an independent\r\nmeeting of that body, and of protecting debtors against suits,\r\nprincipally foreign.\r\n\r\nIn another correspondence with the governor, the assembly requested him\r\nto give an order for the return of the arms; but this he refused to do,\r\nalleging that they belonged to the king. They also complained of being\r\ncompelled to communicate with his excellency on board of one of his\r\nmajesty's armed ships, and at the distance of twelve miles from their\r\nusual place of meeting. His lordship laid the whole responsibility of\r\nthese inconveniences upon the disorders that had driven him from the\r\nseat of government, and required the house to attend him on board the\r\nFowey for the purpose of obtaining his signature to bills. Some of the\r\nburgesses were disposed to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement; but it\r\nwas rejected upon a member's relating Æsop's fable of the sick lion and\r\nthe fox. The assembly declared the governor's message a high breach of\r\nthe rights and privileges of the house; they advised the people of\r\nVirginia to prepare for the preservation of their property, their\r\nrights, and their liberties. It was also resolved unanimously that \"we\r\ndo and will bear faith and true allegiance to our most gracious\r\nsovereign George the Third, our only lawful and rightful king; and that\r\nwe will at all times, to the utmost of our power, and at the risk of\r\nour lives and property, maintain and defend his government in this\r\ncolony, as founded on the established laws and principles of the\r\nconstitution.\" They furthermore unanimously declared their earnest\r\ndesire to preserve and strengthen the bands of amity with their\r\nfellow-subjects of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth day of June, George Washington, upon the nomination of\r\nMr. Thomas Johnson, of Maryland, was unanimously elected by the\r\ncongress, commander-in-chief of the armies of the United Colonies. John\r\nAdams, of Massachusetts, the eloquent and indomitable advocate of\r\nindependence, had, on a previous occasion, recommended him for the post,\r\nas \"a gentleman, whose skill and experience as an officer, whose\r\nindependent fortune, great talents, and excellent universal character,\r\nwould command the approbation of all America, and unite the cordial\r\nexertions of all the colonies better than any other person in the\r\nunion.\" Mr. Adams had discovered that the preference of the Southern\r\nmembers for Washington was very strong. The pay of the commander-in-chief\r\nof the continental army was fixed at the sum of five hundred dollars a\r\nmonth. Washington, impressed with a profound sense of the arduous\r\nresponsibility of the trust, while he gratefully accepted it, declared\r\nat the same time that he did not think himself equal to it. He declined\r\nall compensation for his services, and made known his intention to keep\r\nan account of his expenses, which he should rely on congress to\r\ndischarge. A fac-simile copy of his account, published in recent times,\r\nattests the fidelity with which he performed this engagement. It is\r\nremarkable that while the Southern members in general preferred him,\r\namong those, who at the first suggestion of his name by Mr. Adams, were\r\nopposed to his appointment, were several of the Virginia delegates, and\r\nMr. Pendleton, in particular, was absolutely against it; but upon\r\nfurther conference and reflection all objection was withdrawn. Four\r\nmajor-generals were appointed, Ward of Massachusetts, Charles Lee, an\r\nEnglishman, Schuyler, of New York, and Putnam, of Connecticut. In\r\ncompliance with General Washington's request, his old comrade, Major\r\nHoratio Gates, then on his estate in Virginia, was appointed\r\nadjutant-general. Washington was likewise warmly in favor of the\r\nappointment of General Charles Lee; yet not without misgivings as to\r\nhis violent temper.\r\n\r\nThe Shawnee hostages had disappeared at the time with the governor; and\r\nGeorge Washington, Thomas Walker, James Wood, Andrew Lewis, John Walker,\r\nand Adam Stephen were appointed commissioners to ratify a treaty with\r\nthat tribe. It was determined that Lord Dunmore had voluntarily\r\nabdicated the post of governor, and that the president of the council\r\nshould discharge the duties. The abdication was, no doubt, as\r\n\"voluntary\" as that of James the Second. The burgesses adjourned to the\r\ntwelfth of October, and were summoned to meet in convention on the\r\nseventeenth of July.[622:A] It was on this occasion that Richard Henry\r\nLee, standing on the 17th of June, 1775, with two other burgesses, in\r\nthe portico of the capitol, inscribed with his pencil, on a pillar,\r\nthese lines,--\r\n\r\n     \"When shall we three meet again,\r\n      In thunder, lightning, and in rain?\r\n      When the hurlyburly's done,\r\n      When the battle's lost and won.\"\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth the arms were removed from the palace, and lodged\r\nin the magazine of which Dr. Bland had the charge. Among those engaged\r\nin removing them were Theodorick Bland, Jr., Richard Kidder Meade,\r\nBenjamin Harrison, of Berkley, George Nicholas, Harrison Randolph, and\r\nJames Monroe.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of June Mr. Jefferson was added to a committee of\r\ncongress appointed to draw up a declaration of the grounds of taking up\r\narms. He prepared one, but it proving too strong for Mr. Dickinson, of\r\nPennsylvania, he was indulged in preparing a far tamer statement, which\r\nwas accepted by congress. Yet disgust at its humility was general, and\r\nMr. Dickinson's delight at its passage was the only circumstance which\r\nreconciled them to it. The vote being passed, although farther\r\nobservation on it was out of order, Dickinson could not refrain from\r\nrising and expressing his satisfaction, and concluded by saying: \"There\r\nis but one word, Mr. President, in the paper which I disapprove, and\r\nthat is the word _congress_.\" On which Benjamin Harrison rose and said:\r\n\"There is but one word, Mr. President, of which I approve, and that is\r\nthe word _congress_.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief received his commission from the president of\r\ncongress on the twentieth of June, and on the following day set out for\r\nBoston on horseback, accompanied by General Lee, General Schuyler, and\r\nan escort of Philadelphia cavalry. They had proceeded about twenty\r\nmiles, when they were met by an express bringing intelligence of the\r\nbattle of Bunker's Hill. Amid cheers and the thunder of cannon he\r\nreached the headquarters of the army at Cambridge, on the second of\r\nJuly, and on the third assumed the command. The future was full of\r\ndifficulty and of danger; but he confided in that Divine Providence\r\nwhich wisely orders human affairs.\r\n\r\nLate in June the Magdalen sailed from York with Lady Dunmore, and the\r\nrest of the governor's family, bound for England. The Magdalen was\r\nconvoyed down the York and across the bay, by the Fowey. This\r\noft-mentioned old twenty-gun man-of-war was shortly afterwards relieved\r\nby the Mercury, and sailed with Captain Foy on board for Boston.\r\n\r\nDunmore issued a proclamation commanding all subjects on their\r\nallegiance, to repair to his standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[622:A] Williamsburg invited the assistance of an additional volunteer\r\nforce to guard the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\n1775.\r\n\r\n     Dunmore at Portsmouth--Convention--Committee of Safety--\r\n     Carrington, Read, Cabell--Henry, Colonel and Commander-in-chief\r\n     --George Mason--Miscellaneous Affairs--Death of Peyton Randolph\r\n     --The Randolphs of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNMORE'S domestics now abandoned the palace and removed to Porto Bello,\r\nhis country-seat, about six miles below Williamsburg. The fugitive\r\ngovernor took up his station at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, July the 17th, 1775, the convention met at Richmond. Measures\r\nwere taken for raising two regiments of regular troops for one year, and\r\ntwo companies for the protection of the western frontier, and to divide\r\nthe colony into sixteen districts, and to exercise the militia as\r\nminute-men, so as to be ready for service at a moment's warning. At the\r\ninstance of Richard Bland an inquiry was made into certain charges\r\nreflecting on his patriotism; and his innocence was triumphantly\r\nvindicated. Although he had resisted extreme measures, yet when the\r\ncrisis came, and the rupture took place, he was behind none in patriotic\r\nardor and devotion to the common cause. A minister was implicated in\r\npropagating the charges against him.\r\n\r\nA committee of safety was organized to take charge of the executive\r\nduties of the colony; it consisted of eleven gentlemen: Edmund\r\nPendleton, George Mason, John Page, Richard Bland, Thomas Ludwell Lee,\r\nPaul Carrington, Dudley Digges, William Cabell, Carter Braxton, James\r\nMercer, and John Tabb.\r\n\r\nPaul Carrington, the ancestor of those bearing that name in Virginia,\r\nand his wife, of the Heningham family, emigrated from Ireland to\r\nBarbadoes. He died early in the eighteenth century, and left a widow and\r\nnumerous children. The youngest, George, about the year 1727, came to\r\nVirginia with the family of Joseph Mayo, a Barbadoes merchant, who\r\nsettled at Powhatan, the former seat of the chief of that name, and\r\nyoung Carrington lived with him in the capacity of storekeeper. About\r\n1732 he married Anne, daughter of William Mayo, of Goochland, brother of\r\nJoseph, and went to reside on Willis's Creek, in what is now Cumberland\r\nCounty. Paul Carrington, eldest child of this marriage, married, in\r\n1755, Margaret, daughter of Colonel Clement Read, of Bushy Forest, clerk\r\nof the court of Lunenburg, now Charlotte. Young Carrington, having\r\nattained a practical knowledge of the law in the clerk's office, soon\r\nacquired an extensive practice. He was a burgess from Charlotte in 1765,\r\nand appears to have voted against Henry's resolutions. He continued to\r\nbe a member of the house down to the time of the Revolution; was a\r\nmember of the association of 1670, and in 1774 of the first convention;\r\nand also of those of 1775 and 1776. In the latter he voted for the\r\nresolution instructing the delegates in congress to propose\r\nindependence, and was a member of the committee which reported the bill\r\nof rights and the constitution. He was subsequently a judge of the\r\ngeneral court and of the court of appeals, and a member of the\r\nconvention of 1788. Three of his sons served in the army of Revolution:\r\nGeorge, lieutenant in Lee's legion; Paul, who was at the battles of\r\nGuilford and Greenspring; and Clement, who was wounded in the battle of\r\nEutaw Springs. Paul Carrington, member of the committee of safety, was\r\nupwards of six feet in stature, his features prominent, with bright blue\r\neyes, and sandy hair. His seat was Mulberry Hill, on the banks of the\r\nStaunton.[625:A] He died at the age of eighty-five, having survived all\r\nthe early Virginia patriots of the revolutionary era.\r\n\r\nEdward Carrington, his younger brother, was a valued officer during the\r\nrevolutionary war, and quartermaster-general for the Southern army under\r\nGreene.\r\n\r\nColonel Clement Read, father of Mrs. Paul Carrington, was born in\r\nVirginia, (1707,) his ancestors having, as is supposed, come over\r\nshortly after the Restoration, being probably of the Cromwellian party.\r\nEarly bereft of his father, he was educated at William and Mary under\r\nthe guardianship of John Robinson, of Spotsylvania, president of the\r\ncouncil. In 1730 Mr. Read was married to Mary, only daughter of William\r\nHill, an officer in the British navy, second son of the Marquis of\r\nLansdowne. This William Hill had married the only daughter of Governor\r\nJennings, and resided in what was then Isle of Wight County, now\r\nBrunswick.\r\n\r\nColonel Isaac Read, eldest son of Clement Read, was a member of the\r\nconventions of 1774 and 1775, co-operating with Henry and Jefferson. He\r\nreceived in June, 1776, a commission as lieutenant-colonel of the Fourth\r\nVirginia Regiment, but died not long after at Philadelphia, owing to\r\nexposure in the public service. Thomas Read, younger brother of Isaac,\r\nwas a supporter of the views of Henry and Jefferson, and a member of the\r\nconvention of 1776.[626:A] An accomplished gentleman, he retained the\r\ncostume and manners of a former day.\r\n\r\nDr. William Cabell, head of the family of that name in Virginia,\r\nemigrated from Wiltshire, England, about 1720, and settled in what is\r\nnow Nelson County. He had been a surgeon in the English navy; was a man\r\nof letters and science; in his profession well-skilled and successful;\r\nsagacious in business; of a humorous fancy; and fond of wild sports. He\r\ndied in 1774 at an advanced age, leaving one daughter and four sons; of\r\nthese, Joseph Cabell was a burgess in 1769 and 1770, and member of the\r\nconvention in 1775. John Cabell was a member of the same, and of the\r\nconvention of 1776. Nicholas Cabell served under La Fayette, and was\r\nalso in political life. William Cabell, the eldest brother, was wise in\r\ncouncil, energetic and fearless in action, and widely influential in his\r\nown region. He was fond of rural sports, and an expert horseman. His\r\nface was of the Roman cast. Tall, of a fine person, and commanding\r\npresence, he exhibited the dignified simplicity of the Virginia\r\ngentleman of the old school. He was a tobacco-planter, and his extensive\r\nand well-ordered plantations, besides the labors of agriculture,\r\npresented a scene of industry, where the various handicrafts were\r\ncarried on by his own blacksmiths, carpenters, weavers, and shoemakers.\r\nColonel Cabell was systematic in business, and of generous hospitality.\r\nHe was a member of the assembly in 1769, and a signer of the\r\nassociation. He voted, in 1775, against Henry's resolutions, preferring\r\nthe scheme of a regular army presented by Colonel Nicholas.[627:A]\r\nColonel Samuel J. Cabell, who was at the commencement of the Revolution\r\na student of college, left it, and joined the first armed corps raised\r\nin Virginia, and soon attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the\r\ncontinental army. He was made a prisoner at the surrender of Charleston\r\nin 1780, and so remained till the close of the war. He was afterwards a\r\nmember of congress, and died at his seat in Nelson County, in 1818, aged\r\n61.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry was elected, in August, colonel of the first regiment and\r\ncommander of all the forces raised and to be raised for the defence of\r\nthe colony. William Woodford, of Caroline County, who had served\r\nmeritoriously in the French and Indian war, was appointed to the command\r\nof the second regiment. A strong effort was made to elect Colonel Hugh\r\nMercer, of Fredericksburg, to the command of the first regiment, and on\r\nthe first ballot he received a plurality of one vote; but the question\r\nbeing narrowed down between him and Mr. Henry, the latter was elected.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the late Indian war was estimated at £150,000; Virginia's\r\nquota of the charge of the continental army £150,000; the charge of the\r\ntwo new regiments, and the minute-men, and other items of public\r\nexpenditure, made a sum of upwards of £500,000. George Wythe was elected\r\nmember of congress in the place of Washington, appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief. When the delegates were chosen for the ensuing\r\ncongress, Mr. Mason would have been elected but that he declared that he\r\ncould not possibly attend. Upon the resignation of the aged Colonel\r\nRichard Bland, a day or two thereafter, a party headed by Colonel Henry,\r\nMr. Jefferson, and Colonel Paul Carrington, appeared determined to elect\r\nColonel Mason at all events. In consequence of this, just before the\r\nballot was taken, he found himself constrained to make known the grounds\r\nof his refusal; \"in doing which,\" he says, \"I felt myself more\r\ndistressed than ever I was in my life, especially when I saw tears run\r\ndown the president's (Randolph's) cheeks.\" The cause of Mr. Mason's\r\ndeclining to serve was the recent death of his wife, leaving a large\r\nfamily of children. Mr. Mason nominated Colonel Francis Lightfoot Lee,\r\nwho was elected. Mr. Mason was, nevertheless, as has been seen, made a\r\nmember of the committee of safety, which service was even more\r\ninconvenient to him than that of delegate to congress. But upon his\r\nbegging permission to resign, he was answered by a unanimous \"no.\" The\r\nstaff officers of the First Regiment, under Colonel Henry, were\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Christian and Major Eppes; and in the Second\r\nRegiment, under Colonel Woodford, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Scott and\r\nMajor Alexander Spotswood. The convention passed ordinances for raising\r\nmoney and imposing taxes, for furnishing arms and the procuring of\r\nsaltpetre, lead, and sulphur, and for encouraging the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder; for regulating the elections of delegates; and for\r\nestablishing a general test of fidelity to the country. The Maryland\r\nConvention not concurring in the resolution prohibiting the export of\r\nprovisions, it was rescinded, and the ports were consequently kept open\r\ntill the tenth of September. The merchants, natives of Great Britain,\r\nmostly Scotch, resident in Virginia, petitioned the convention to\r\nprescribe some rule of conduct in their business during the present\r\ncrisis of affairs, and were allowed to remain neutral. The committee of\r\nsafety met for the first time toward the end of August. At the beginning\r\nof the session of the convention, resolutions were passed by way of\r\nrecommendations for the people; but afterwards ordinances were enacted\r\non all matters of importance with the formalities of a bill, passing\r\nthrough three readings.\r\n\r\nIn September Colonel Henry selected an encampment in the rear of the\r\nCollege of William and Mary. The recruits, regular and minute-men,\r\npoured rapidly into Williamsburg. In October Matthew Phripp, a\r\nVirginian, in whom important trusts had been confided, proving a\r\ntraitor, went on board of one of Dunmore's vessels. Phripp's son\r\nlikewise deserted. Virginia contrived to import some powder at this\r\njuncture. The people became dissatisfied at the scarcity of salt, the\r\nimportation of which was prohibited by the articles of association; but\r\nit would hardly have been possible to import it then, even if allowed by\r\nlaw, Virginia not having one armed vessel to protect her trade. Some\r\npersons began to manufacture it by evaporating sea-water in pans. The\r\nnon-importation afforded a new incentive to industry and invention,\r\nthrew the people upon their own resources, and taught them self-denial,\r\nand how to live within themselves. They made less tobacco, and applied\r\nthemselves more to domestic manufactures.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of this month, 1775, died suddenly of an apoplexy, at\r\nPhiladelphia, the able and virtuous Peyton Randolph, president of\r\ncongress, aged fifty-two years, descended from a family long noted in\r\nVirginia for its wealth, talents, and influence; he was the second son\r\nof Sir John Randolph, and Susan Beverley, his wife. Peyton Randolph,\r\nbeing bred to the law, was, in 1748, appointed king's attorney for the\r\ncolony, being then but twenty-four years of age. He succeeded Speaker\r\nRobinson in the chair of the house of burgesses in 1766, and continued\r\nto preside over that body until it was superseded by the conventions. He\r\nwas made, in 1773, a member of the committee of correspondence, and was\r\nat its head. In March, 1774, he was unanimously chosen president of the\r\nfirst convention of Virginia. In August he was appointed by the\r\nconvention one of the delegates to the congress which assembled at\r\nPhiladelphia in September, and was unanimously elected president of it.\r\nIn person he was tall and stately; in manner grave and of senatorial\r\ndignity; at home generous and hospitable. As a lawyer sound and\r\naccurate; in public life of excellent judgment, large experience, and\r\nincorruptible integrity.[629:A] He lies buried in the chapel of William\r\nand Mary.\r\n\r\nThe progenitor of the Randolphs was William of Warwickshire, or as some\r\nsay, of Yorkshire, England, who came over to Virginia probably between\r\n1665 and 1675, poor, it is said. He accumulated a large estate, and\r\nbecame a member of the house of burgesses and of the council. He appears\r\nto have been intimate with the first Colonel William Byrd, and well\r\nacquainted with Lady Berkley. He settled at Turkey Island on the James\r\nRiver. He married Mary Isham, of Bermuda Hundred, who was descended from\r\nan ancient family in Northamptonshire. Several of their sons were men of\r\ndistinction: William was member of the council, and treasurer; Isham a\r\nmember of the house of burgesses from Goochland, (1740,) and\r\nadjutant-general; Richard was burgess for Henrico, and succeeded his\r\nbrother as treasurer. Sir John, sixth son of the first William, was\r\nclerk, speaker, treasurer, and attorney-general. He died in March, 1737,\r\naged forty-four, and lies buried in the chapel of William and\r\nMary.[630:A] Peter, son of the second William Randolph, was clerk, and\r\nattorney-general. Peyton, son of Sir John, was attorney-general, speaker\r\nof the house of burgesses, and president of the first congress. John,\r\nbrother of Peyton, was attorney-general, a votary of pleasure; of\r\nbrilliant talents; he sided with Dunmore, withdrew from Virginia with\r\nhim, and died in London, in January, 1784, aged fifty-six. He lies\r\nburied in the chapel of William and Mary. Thomas Mann Randolph, great\r\ngrandson of the first William, was member of the Virginia convention of\r\n1775, from Goochland. Beverley Randolph was member of assembly from\r\nCumberland during the Revolution, and Governor of the State of Virginia.\r\nEdmund Randolph, (son of John, the attorney-general,) said to have been\r\ndisinherited by his father for refusing to adhere to the royal cause,\r\nwas aid-de-camp to General Washington, member of the convention of 1776,\r\njudge of the admiralty court, member of the congress of the\r\nconfederation, and of the general convention that framed the\r\nconstitution of the United States, and of the Virginia convention that\r\nratified it, Governor of Virginia, Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates, and Secretary of State. Robert Randolph, son of Peter, Richard\r\nRandolph, grandson of Peter, and David Meade Randolph, sons of the\r\nsecond Richard, were cavalry officers in the war of the Revolution.\r\nDavid Meade Randolph was United States Marshal for Virginia. John\r\nRandolph, of Roanoke, the orator, was grandson of the first Richard.\r\nThomas Mann Randolph, Jr., was member of the legislature of Virginia,\r\nand of congress, and Governor of Virginia. Richard Bland, of the old\r\ncongress, Thomas Jefferson, Theodorick Bland, Jr., Richard Henry Lee,\r\nArthur Lee, and Francis Lightfoot Lee, William Stith, the historian,\r\nand Thomas Marshall, father of the chief justice, were all descended\r\nfrom William Randolph, of Turkey Island.\r\n\r\nJane Bolling, great granddaughter of Pocahontas, married Richard\r\nRandolph, of Curles. John Randolph, Sr., the seventh child of that\r\nmarriage, married Frances Bland, and John Randolph, of Roanoke, the\r\norator, was one of the children of this union.\r\n\r\nThe members of the numerous family of the Randolphs in several instances\r\nadopted the names of their seats for the purpose of distinction, as\r\nThomas of Tuckahoe, Isham of Dungeness, Richard of Curles, John of\r\nRoanoke. The following were seats of the Randolphs on the James River:\r\nTuckahoe, Chatsworth, Wilton, Varina, Curles, Bremo, and Turkey Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[625:A] Foote's Sketches of Va., second series, 575; Grigsby's\r\nConvention of '76.\r\n\r\n[626:A] Foote's Sketches, second series, 573; Grigsby's Convention of\r\n'76.\r\n\r\n[627:A] Va.

Captain Squires, of his majesty's sloop Otter, during the\r\nsummer cruised in the James and York, plundering the inhabitants and\r\ncarrying off slaves. Early in September a tender laden with stores,\r\nbeing driven ashore near Hampton, Squires (who happened to be in her)\r\nand most of the crew escaped. The sloop was burnt by the inhabitants.\r\nSquires in retaliation threatening Hampton, Major Innes, with a hundred\r\nmen, was sent down from Williamsburg to defend it. Squires in the latter\r\npart of October appeared near Hampton with several vessels, and\r\nthreatened to land and burn the town. It was defended by a company of\r\nregulars under Captain George Nicholas, a company of minute-men, and\r\nsome militia. Upon Squires attempting to land a skirmish ensued, and the\r\nenemy was driven off with some loss. Squires' party returning on the\r\nnext day, burnt down a house belonging to a Mr. Cooper. Intelligence of\r\nthis affair having reached Williamsburg, a company of riflemen was sent\r\nto Hampton, and Colonel Woodford was despatched to take command there.\r\nUpon their arrival on the next morning, Squires began to fire upon the\r\ntown, but was again compelled to retire. These petty hostilities were\r\nthe subject of humorous remark in the _Virginia Gazette_.[632:A]\r\n\r\nDunmore, on the 7th of November, 1775, proclaimed martial-law, summoned\r\nall persons capable of bearing arms to his standard, on penalty of being\r\nproclaimed traitors, and offered freedom to all servants and slaves who\r\nshould join him. He had now the ascendency in the country around\r\nNorfolk, which abounded in tories. The committee of safety despatched\r\nWoodford with his regiment and two hundred minute-men, amounting in all\r\nto eight hundred men, with orders to cross the James River at Sandy\r\nPoint and go in pursuit of Dunmore. Colonel Henry had been desirous to\r\nbe employed in this service, and, it was said, solicited it, but the\r\ncommittee of safety refused, and amid such exciting events he found\r\nhimself, eager as he was for action, and ardent and impetuous as was his\r\nnature, still compelled to sit down inactive in Williamsburg, where he\r\nhad been quartered since September. At length after the lapse of nearly\r\nanother month of tedious inaction, during which he received no regular\r\ncommunications from Colonel Woodford, Colonel Henry wrote to him thus:\r\n\"Not hearing of any despatch from you for a long time, I can no longer\r\nforbear sending to know your situation and what has occurred?\" Woodford\r\non the next day replied from the Great Bridge, near Norfolk, and said:\r\n\"When joined I shall always esteem myself immediately under your\r\ncommand, and will obey accordingly, but when sent to command a separate\r\nand distinct corps, under the immediate instructions of the committee of\r\nsafety, whenever that body, or the honorable convention is sitting, I\r\nlook upon it as my indispensable duty to address my intelligence to them\r\nas the supreme power in this colony.\" Thus Colonel Henry's chagrin at\r\nnot being permitted to march himself against Dunmore was aggravated by\r\nColonel Woodford's declining, while detached, to acknowledge his\r\nsuperiority in command. Woodford, upon approaching Dunmore, found that\r\nhe had entrenched himself on the north side of the Elizabeth River, at\r\nthe Great Bridge, about twenty miles from Norfolk. Judge Marshall says\r\nthat it was necessary for the Provincials to cross it in order to reach\r\nNorfolk, but Thomas Ludwell Lee, writing at the time, says that there\r\nwere other ways by which to pass to Norfolk. \"Our army has been for some\r\ntime arrested in its march to Norfolk by a redoubt, or stockade, or\r\nhog-pen, as they call it here, by way of derision, at the end of this\r\nbridge. Though, by the way, this hog-pen seems filled with a parcel of\r\nwild boars, which we appear not overfond to meddle with.\" Some of the\r\nmore eager patriots were apprehensive that Woodford would be amused at\r\nthat post until Dunmore should finish his fortifications at Norfolk,\r\nwhere he was now entrenching and mounting cannon, some hundreds of\r\nnegroes being employed in the work. Added to this the advanced season of\r\nthe year and the hourly expectation of the enemy's receiving a\r\nre-enforcement from St. Augustine, as was known by intercepted\r\nintelligence, made a bold movement necessary, \"while we walk too\r\ncautiously in the road of prudence.\"\r\n\r\nDunmore's power on land was confined to the counties of Norfolk and\r\nPrincess Anne; his recent course had united the colony with few\r\nexceptions against him, and if the ministry had ransacked the whole\r\nworld for the person of all others the best fitted to ruin their cause,\r\nthey could not have found a fitter agent than Lord Dunmore. He had just\r\nnow proclaimed liberty to the slaves, and declared martial-law.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that one frigate could capture the whole of his fleet,\r\nand other vessels laden with the floating property of tories, of\r\nenormous value. John Page wished earnestly for a few armed vessels to\r\nkeep possession of the rivers, the arteries of commerce, at the least\r\nthe upper parts of them. While five thousand men could not defend so\r\nexposed a coast against the depredations of Dunmore's fleet, yet five\r\nhundred in armed vessels could easily take the fleet. But a majority of\r\nthe committee of safety and of the convention, held it in vain for\r\nVirginia then to attempt any thing by water.[634:A]\r\n\r\nDunmore had erected a small fort on an oasis surrounded by a morass, not\r\nfar from the Dismal Swamp, accessible on either side only by a long\r\ncauseway. Woodford encamped within cannon-shot of this post, in mud and\r\nmire, in a village at the southern end of the causeway, across which he\r\nthrew up a breast-work, but being destitute of artillery he did not\r\nattack the fort. After a few days Dunmore, hearing by a servant lad, who\r\nhad deserted from Woodford's camp, that his force did not exceed three\r\nhundred men, mustered his whole strength and despatched them in the\r\nnight to the fort, with orders to force the breast-works early next\r\nmorning, or die in the attempt. On the 9th of December, 1775, a little\r\nbefore sunrise, Captain Fordyce, at the head of sixty grenadiers, who\r\nsix abreast led the column, advanced along the causeway. Colonel Bullet\r\nfirst discovered the enemy, and the alarm being given in Woodford's\r\ncamp, a small guard at the breast-works began the fire, others hastened\r\nfrom their tents, and regardless of order, kept up a fire on the head of\r\nthe column. Fordyce, though received so warmly in front, and flanked by\r\na party posted on a rising ground to his right, rallied his men, and\r\nmarched up within twenty yards of the breast-work, when he fell pierced\r\nwith bullets. His followers now retreated, and at this juncture Colonel\r\nWoodford arrived, and directed a pursuit of the enemy, who were galled\r\nby a handful of riflemen under Colonel Stephen, but found protection\r\nunder cover of the guns of the fort. Woodford declined attempting to\r\nstorm the works, although strongly urged to it by the bold and ardent\r\nBullet and the enthusiastic wishes of the troops.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of the Great Bridge every grenadier was killed, and the\r\nenemy's killed and wounded amounted to about one hundred. Four officers\r\nwere killed, one wounded and made prisoner. The affair has been styled\r\n\"a Bunker Hill in miniature:\" but there the loss was very heavy on both\r\nsides; whereas here Woodford's troops suffered no loss.\r\n\r\nJohn Marshall, afterwards chief justice, was in this expedition.[635:A]\r\nRichard Kidder Meade, father of Bishop Meade, was also present at the\r\naffair of the Great Bridge. This was the first scene of revolutionary\r\nbloodshed in Virginia. On the night following this action the royalists\r\nevacuated the fort, and Dunmore took refuge on board of his fleet.\r\nColonel Howe, with five or six hundred North Carolina troops, now joined\r\nWoodford, and assumed command at the Great Bridge, with the consent of\r\nWoodford, who yielded to the seniority of his commission. Colonel Henry\r\nnow saw the colonel of the second Virginia regiment, who had refused to\r\nacknowledge his command, submitting himself to an officer of no higher\r\nrank, and of another colony. He found himself, although invested with\r\nthe title of commander-in-chief, yet virtually superseded and reduced to\r\nthe mere shadow of a name. To nullify his superiority of command the\r\ncommittee had only to detach his subordinate officers.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of December a member of the convention wrote to\r\nColonel Woodford: \"I have talked with Colonel Henry about this matter;\r\nhe thinks he has been ill-treated, and insists the officers under his\r\ncommand shall submit to his orders:\" and again, \"A commander or general,\r\nI suppose, will be sent us by the congress, as it is expected our troops\r\nwill be upon continental pay.\" Mr. Pendleton, chairman of the committee,\r\nin a letter dated December the twenty-fourth, and addressed to Colonel\r\nWoodford, said: \"The field-officers to each regiment will be named here\r\nand recommended to congress; in case our army is taken into continental\r\npay, they will send commissions. A general officer will be chosen\r\nthere, I doubt not, and sent us; with that matter I hope we shall\r\nnot intermeddle, lest it should be thought propriety requires our\r\ncalling, or rather recommending, our present officer to that station.\"\r\nIt appears that Colonel Henry had not owed his military appointment\r\nto those members of the committee of safety who conducted the\r\ncorrespondence.[636:A] Mr. Pendleton looked upon the appointment of\r\nHenry as an \"unlucky step.\" Pendleton and Woodford were both of the\r\nCounty of Caroline.\r\n\r\nLate in December, Colonel Henry insisting upon a determination of the\r\nquestion thus raised between him and Colonel Woodford, the committee\r\npassed the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, Unanimously, that Colonel Woodford, although\r\n     acting upon a separate and detached command, ought to\r\n     correspond with Colonel Henry, and make returns to him at\r\n     proper times of the state and condition of the forces under\r\n     his command, and also that he is subject to his orders when\r\n     the convention or the committee of safety is not sitting; but\r\n     that while either of these bodies is sitting he is to receive\r\n     his orders from one of them.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision virtually annulled the power of Henry as\r\ncommander-in-chief. The clause of the ordinance of convention which\r\nauthorized the committee to direct military movements is the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n     \"_And whereas_ it may be necessary for the public security\r\n     that the forces to be raised by virtue of this ordinance\r\n     should, as occasion may require, be marched to different parts\r\n     of the colony, and that the officers should be subject to a\r\n     proper control,--\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid_, That the\r\n     officers and soldiers under such command shall, in all things\r\n     not otherwise particularly provided for by this ordinance and\r\n     the articles established for their regulation, be under the\r\n     control and subject to the order of the general committee of\r\n     safety.\"[637:A]\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be said of Woodford and his men that they were marched\r\nto a different part of the colony; he and Colonel Henry were still in\r\nthe same quarter of Virginia, and not far apart. For so numerous a body\r\nas the convention, or even the committee of safety, to assume all the\r\nfunctions of the commander-in-chief, was incompatible with the unity,\r\nsecrecy, and promptitude demanded in the conduct of war. If not, of what\r\nadvantage was the appointment of a commander-in-chief at all? If the\r\ncommittee, by such a construction of their powers, could virtually annul\r\nthe authority of the commander-in-chief, he, whose powers were at the\r\nleast as ample as theirs, might, by a like construction, have repudiated\r\ntheir authority. The conduct of the committee toward Colonel Henry was\r\nstrongly censured by the people as well as the troops, and they imputed\r\nit to personal envy.[637:B] Those, however, who approved of the\r\ncommittee's course, attributed it to a want of confidence in Colonel\r\nHenry, as deficient in military experience.[638:A] Other mortifications\r\nwere in store for the man of the people.\r\n\r\nShortly after the battle of the Great Bridge the Provincials, under\r\nHowe, took possession of Norfolk, encamped there in the \"Town Camp.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[632:A] John Banister proposing to turn his saw-mill at Petersburg into\r\na powder-mill, the convention ordered saltpetre and sulphur to be sent\r\nthere for him. Richard Bland advised that saltpetre should be made at\r\nAppomattox warehouses, (Petersburg,) fearing that supineness possessed\r\nall ranks, and offering to contribute toward that useful work.\r\n\r\n[634:A] Lee Papers, S.

Mr. Harrison's father and himself were disposed to \"be\r\ndabbling in the saltpetre way.\" Rubsamen afterwards manufactured much\r\nsaltpetre and powder in Virginia, and was involved in no little trouble\r\nin the work, and in getting paid for it.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-eighth of December Edmund Pendleton writes to Richard\r\nHenry Lee: \"If the house of Bourbon mean to join us it will be soon,\r\nlest the progress of the enemy should make our connection less valuable\r\nby the destruction of our commercial cities.\"\r\n\r\nDunmore's fleet being distressed for provisions, upon the arrival of the\r\nLiverpool man-of-war from England, a flag was sent on shore to enquire\r\nwhether the inhabitants would supply his majesty's ship? It was answered\r\nin the negative; and the ships in the harbor being continually annoyed\r\nby a fire from the quarter of the town lying next the water, Dunmore\r\ndetermined to dislodge the assailants. Previous notice having been given\r\nto the inhabitants, January the 1st, 1776, a party of sailors and\r\nmarines landed, and set fire to the nearest houses. The party was\r\ncovered by a cannonade from the Liverpool frigate, two sloops-of-war,\r\nand the governor's armed ship, the Dunmore. A few were killed and\r\nwounded on both sides.\r\n\r\nA printer's press had been removed from Norfolk some time before this on\r\nboard the governor's ship, and according to his bulletin published\r\nafter this affair, it was only intended to destroy that part of the town\r\nnext the water. But the provincials, strongly prejudiced against the\r\nplace as a harbor for tories, made no attempts to arrest the flames.\r\nAfter four-fifths of the town were destroyed, Colonel Howe, who had\r\nwaited on the convention to urge the necessity of completing the\r\ndestruction, returned with orders to that effect, which were immediately\r\ncarried into execution. Thus fell the most populous and flourishing town\r\nin Virginia. Its rental amounted to $44,000, and the total loss was\r\nestimated at $1,300,000. It is said that alone of all the civil and\r\nmilitary leaders of the colony, General Andrew Lewis opposed the order\r\nfor burning Norfolk.\r\n\r\nIn February, the North Carolina provincials defeated the royalists at\r\nMoore's Creek Bridge. This well-timed and vigorous blow intimidated the\r\ntories, and animated the patriots with new ardor.\r\n\r\nDunmore continued to carry on a predatory warfare on the rivers, burning\r\nhouses and plundering plantations, and had now rendered himself the\r\nobject of general execration.\r\n\r\nDuring February John Page wrote to Richard Henry Lee: \"I have been\r\nalways of your opinion with respect to our present commander-in-chief.\r\nAll orders do pass through him, and we really wish to be in perfect\r\nharmony with him.\" The convention of Virginia having raised six\r\nadditional regiments, solicited congress to take the Virginia troops on\r\ncontinental establishment. That body, doubtless misled by the intrigues\r\nof the same cabal which had already virtually deprived Colonel Henry of\r\nhis command, resolved to take the six _new_ regiments, passing by the\r\nfirst two, so as to exclude Colonel Henry from the chief command, to\r\nwhich he was best entitled. The convention of Virginia, however,\r\ninterposing at this point, remonstrated against the degradation of the\r\nofficers of their first choice, and earnestly requested congress, should\r\nit adhere to the determination of taking only six regiments into\r\ncontinental pay, to allow the two first raised to stand first in the new\r\narrangement. This request was nominally agreed to, but at the same time\r\nwhen a commission of colonel was forwarded to him, commissions of\r\nbrigadier-general were forwarded to Colonel Howe and Colonel Andrew\r\nLewis. A commission, dated at Philadelphia, February the 13th, 1776,\r\nappointing Colonel Henry to the command of the first Virginia regiment\r\ntaken upon the continental establishment, was forwarded by congress to\r\nthe committee of safety.\r\n\r\nColonel Henry felt himself compelled by every sentiment of self-respect\r\nto refuse it, and immediately resigned that which he held from the\r\nstate. The troops encamped at Williamsburg, upon hearing of his\r\nresignation, went into mourning, and being under arms, waited on him at\r\nhis lodgings on the last day of February. In their address they deplored\r\nhis withdrawal from the army, but applauded his just resentment at \"a\r\nglaring indignity.\" Colonel Henry in replying said: \"This kind testimony\r\nof your regard to me would have been an ample reward for services much\r\ngreater than those I have had the power to perform.\" \"I leave the\r\nservice, but I leave my heart with you. May God bless you, and give you\r\nsuccess and safety, and make you the glorious instrument of saving our\r\ncountry.\" In the evening they assembled tumultuously, and unwilling to\r\nserve under any other commander, demanded their discharge. Colonel Henry\r\nfelt himself obliged to defer his departure a while, and he, who was in\r\nthe following year accused of a desire to make himself dictator, now\r\nvisited the barracks, and employed his eloquence in allaying these\r\nalarming commotions.\r\n\r\nWashington, in a letter to Joseph Reed, dated March the seventh, wrote:\r\n\"I think my countrymen made a capital mistake when they took Henry out\r\nof the senate to place him in the field, and pity it is that he does not\r\nsee this, and remove every difficulty by a voluntary resignation.\" Mr.\r\nReed, in his reply, dated at Philadelphia, said to Washington: \"We have\r\nsome accounts from Virginia that Colonel Henry has resigned in disgust\r\nat not being made a general officer; but it rather gives satisfaction\r\nthan otherwise, as his abilities seem better calculated for the senate\r\nthan the field.\" In the same letter Mr. Reed wrote: \"It is said the\r\nVirginians are so alarmed with the idea of independence that they have\r\nsent Mr. Braxton on purpose to turn the vote of that colony, if any\r\nquestion on that subject should come before congress.\" Mr. Reed himself\r\nhad entertained strong misgivings on the question of independence.\r\n\r\nDuring this month Colonel Henry was addressed by ninety officers at\r\nKemp's Landing, at Suffolk, in Colonel Woodford's camp, and at\r\nWilliamsburg. In this address they said: \"We join with the general voice\r\nof the people, and think it our duty to make this public declaration of\r\nour high respect for your distinguished merit. To your vigilance and\r\njudgment as a senator this united continent bears ample testimony, while\r\nshe prosecutes her steady opposition to those destructive ministerial\r\nmeasures which your eloquence first pointed out and taught to resent,\r\nand your resolution led forward to resist.\" \"We have the fullest\r\nconfidence in your abilities and the rectitude of your views; and\r\nhowever willing the envious may be to undermine an established\r\nreputation, we trust the day will come when justice shall prevail, and\r\nthereby secure you an honorable and happy return to the glorious\r\nemployment of conducting our councils and hazarding your life in the\r\ndefence of your country.\" The imputation of envy was aimed at the\r\ncommittee of safety as a body, or what is more probable, at some\r\nindividual or individuals of it, who were believed to be the secret\r\nauthors of that series of indignities which had driven Colonel Henry\r\nfrom military life.[642:A] The people regarded the indignities shown to\r\ntheir favorite as an effort to pinion the eagle, whose adventurous wing\r\nhad launched into the storm and cuffed the tempestuous clouds, while\r\nothers sat crouching in their conservative nests, mute and\r\nthunderstruck.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the troops remained quartered at Williamsburg.[642:B]\r\nIn a general order issued in March the soldiers were called upon to\r\ndevote themselves to their duty, to exert themselves in learning the\r\nnecessary discipline, to respect the persons and property of their\r\nfellow-citizens; and the officers were exhorted to fit themselves and\r\nthe men for the high trust of defending the property and liberty of\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[642:A] Wirt's Life of Patrick Henry, 206.\r\n\r\n[642:B] GENERAL ORDERS.--_Williamsburg, Headquarters, March 19th, 1776._\r\n\r\nMarch 23. \"The officers are desired to examine strictly into their\r\nrespective companies that no gaming be carried on of any kind\r\nwhatsoever.

In a letter, dated April\r\ntwentieth, Richard Henry Lee exhorted him to propose a separation from\r\nGreat Britain.[644:A]\r\n\r\nThe convention met on the 6th of May, 1776, at Williamsburg. Edmund\r\nPendleton was nominated by Richard Bland, for the post of president, and\r\nthe nomination was seconded by Archibald Cary; Thomas Ludwell Lee was\r\nnominated by Thomas Johnson, of Louisa, and seconded by Bartholomew\r\nDandridge. Mr. Lee's nomination, made by Mr. Henry's warm supporters,\r\nindicates the dissatisfaction felt toward Mr. Pendleton. The last\r\nmentioned gentleman, who was admirably qualified for the place, was\r\nelected; by what vote is not known. In his address he reminded the\r\nconvention that the administration of justice, and almost all the powers\r\nof government, had now been suspended for nearly two years; and he\r\ncalled on them to reflect whether they could in that situation longer\r\nsustain the struggle in which they were engaged. Having suggested\r\ncertain subjects for their consideration, he exhorted them to be\r\ncomposed, unanimous, and diligent.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodrich, Jr., a suspected person, was confined, by order of the\r\nconvention, to his room, in Williamsburg, under guard. The court of\r\ncommissioners for Gloucester having found John Wilkie guilty of giving\r\nintelligence to the enemy, his estate was confiscated, and Sir John\r\nPeyton, Baronet, appointed commissioner to put the proceeds into the\r\ntreasury. John Tayloe Corbin presented a petition setting forth that in\r\nOctober, 1775, a time when all America, as well in congress as in\r\nconventions, was avowing loyalty to the king, he wrote a letter to\r\nCharles Neilson, Esq., of Urbanna, who was going to Norfolk, in\r\nconsequence of which he had been arrested by military warrant, and was\r\nnow confined in the guard-house. The convention ordered that for the\r\npresent he should be confined to his room in Williamsburg, under guard.\r\nShortly after he was ordered to be confined to the region between the\r\nMatapony and the Pamunkey in Caroline, and give bond in the penalty of\r\nten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nRalph Wormley, in a petition, apologised for a letter which he had\r\nwritten to Lord Dunmore, communicating his opinions on the state of\r\naffairs, and which had excited the indignation of the country against\r\nhim; declared that he had ever disclaimed parliament's right of taxation\r\nover this continent, but that it was his misfortune to differ in\r\nsentiments from the mode adopted to obtain a renunciation of that\r\nunconstitutional claim, praying to be released from confinement,\r\nsubmitting to the mercy of his country, and promising in future to\r\nconduct himself in conformity with the ordinances of the convention. He\r\nwas ordered to confine himself to Berkley County, and that part of his\r\nfather's estate which lay in Frederick, and to give a bond with a\r\npenalty of ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth Thomas Nelson, Jr., addressed a letter to a member of the\r\nconvention, in which he says: \"Since our conversation, yesterday, my\r\nthoughts have been sorely employed on the great question, whether\r\nindependence ought, or ought not, to be immediately declared? Having\r\nweighed the arguments on both sides, I am clearly of opinion that we\r\nmust, as we value the liberties of America, or even her existence,\r\nwithout a moment's delay, declare for independence. If my reasons appear\r\nweak, you will excuse them for the disinterestedness of the author, as I\r\nmay venture to affirm that no man on this continent will sacrifice more\r\nthan myself by the separation.\" He combats the objection that the\r\nsentiments of France and Spain should be ascertained previously; because\r\nthere was reason to hope that their sentiments would be favorable, and\r\nbecause at any rate, in the perilous situation of the colonies, the\r\nhazard must be ventured on. France could not fail to understand that the\r\nbreaking up of the English monopoly of the American trade would enure to\r\nher own benefit. The fear that France might be diverted from an alliance\r\nby an offer of partition from Great Britain, appeared chimerical, and\r\ncontrary to the settled policy of the court of Louis the Sixteenth. In\r\nany case delay in declaring independence would be ruinous, as without it\r\nthe soldiers, disheartened, would abandon their colors. Mr. Nelson in\r\nconclusion adds: \"I can assure you, sir, that the spirit of the people,\r\n(except a very few in these lower parts, whose little blood has been\r\nsucked out by mosquitoes,) cry out for this declaration. The military in\r\nparticular, men and officers, are outrageous on the subject; and a man\r\nof your excellent discernment need not be told how dangerous it would be\r\nin our present circumstances to dally with the spirit, or disappoint the\r\nexpectations of the bulk of the people.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time there was published, at Philadelphia, a pamphlet, by\r\nCarter Braxton, entitled \"An Address to the Convention of the Colony and\r\nAncient Dominion of Virginia on the subject of Government.\" It was\r\nlooked upon as expressing the views of \"the little junto from whence it\r\nproceeded,\" and was denounced in a letter by Richard Henry Lee as\r\nexhibiting \"confusion of ideas, aristocratic pride, contradictory\r\nreasoning with evident ill design.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of May Archibald Cary reported, from the committee of\r\nthe whole house, a preamble and resolutions which were unanimously\r\nadopted. The preamble recited how all the efforts of the colonies to\r\nbring about a reconciliation with Great Britain, consistently with the\r\nconstitutional rights of America, had produced only additional insults\r\nand new acts of oppression; and it recapitulated these acts. The first\r\nresolution instructed the Virginia delegates in congress to propose to\r\nthat body \"to declare the United Colonies free and independent states;\"\r\nthe second ordered the appointment of a committee to prepare \"a\r\ndeclaration of rights,\" and a plan of government. The preamble and\r\nresolutions were drawn up by Edmund Pendleton, offered in committee of\r\nthe whole house by Thomas Nelson, Jr., and supported by the eloquence\r\nof Patrick Henry.[647:A] On the next day the resolutions were read to\r\nthe troops quartered at Williamsburg, under command of General Andrew\r\nLewis; a _feu de joie_ was fired amid the acclamations of the people,\r\nand the union flag of the American States waved from the capitol, and in\r\nthe evening Williamsburg was illuminated.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry in a letter, dated at Williamsburg, May twentieth, wrote\r\nto Richard Henry Lee: \"The grand work of forming a constitution for\r\nVirginia is now before the convention, where your love of equal liberty\r\nand your skill in public counsels might so eminently serve the cause of\r\nyour country. Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I fear too great a bias to\r\naristocracy prevails among the opulent. I own myself a democratic on the\r\nplan of our admired friend, J. Adams, whose pamphlet I read with great\r\npleasure. A performance from Philadelphia is just come here, ushered in,\r\nI'm told, by a colleague of yours, B----, and greatly recommended by\r\nhim. I don't like it. Is the author a whig? One or two expressions in\r\nthe book make me ask. I wish to divide you and have you here to animate,\r\nby your manly eloquence, the sometimes drooping spirits of our country,\r\nand in congress to be the ornament of your native country, and the\r\nvigilant, determined foe of tyranny. To give you colleagues of kindred\r\nsentiments is my wish. I doubt you have them not at present. A\r\nconfidential account of the matter to Colonel Tom,[647:B] desiring him\r\nto use it according to his discretion, might greatly serve the public\r\nand vindicate Virginia from suspicions. Vigor, animation, and all the\r\npowers of mind and body must now be summoned and collected together into\r\none grand effort. Moderation, falsely so called, hath nearly brought on\r\nus final ruin. And to see those who have so fatally advised us still\r\nguiding, or at least sharing our public councils, alarms me.\"[647:C]\r\n\r\nThere was an apprehension felt by some at this time lest England, in\r\norder to prevent France from assisting the colonies, should offer to\r\ndivide them with her. Patrick Henry in the same letter wrote to Richard\r\nHenry Lee: \"Ere this reaches you our resolution for separating from\r\nBritain will be handed you by Colonel Nelson. Your sentiments as to the\r\nnecessary progress of this great affair correspond with mine. For may\r\nnot France, ignorant of the great advantages to her commerce we intend\r\nto offer, and of the permanency of that separation which is to take\r\nplace, be allured by the partition you mention? To anticipate,\r\ntherefore, the efforts of the enemy by sending instantly American\r\nambassadors to France, seems to me absolutely necessary. Delay may bring\r\non us total ruin. But is not a confederacy of our states previously\r\nnecessary?\" His comprehensive eye glanced from the fisheries of the\r\nnorth to the Mississippi and western lands. \"Notwithstanding\r\nsolicitations from every great land company to the west, I've refused to\r\njoin them. I think a general confiscation of royal and British property\r\nshould be made. The fruits would be great, and the measure in its utmost\r\nlatitude warranted by the late act of parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIn the convention a committee of thirty-four, Archibald Cary being\r\nchairman, were appointed to prepare a declaration of rights and a plan\r\nof government. The declaration was reported and adopted on the fifteenth\r\nof June, and the plan of government on the twenty-ninth, (five days in\r\nadvance of the declaration of independence of the United\r\nColonies,)--both by a unanimous vote. The declaration of rights and\r\nconstitution were draughted by George Mason.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mason, first of the family in Virginia, had been a member of\r\nparliament in England, and, at the breaking out of the civil wars, had\r\nsided with King Charles the First, although, like Falkland, not wholly\r\napproving his course, organized a military corps, and fought on the\r\nroyal side until the overthrow at Worcester. After this catastrophe he\r\ncame over to Virginia and landed in Norfolk County, (1651,) and was soon\r\nfollowed by his family. He removed to Acohick Creek, on the Potomac. He\r\ncommanded (1676) a volunteer force against the Indians, and in the same\r\nyear represented the County of Stafford in the assembly, being a\r\ncolleague of the author of \"T. M.'s Account of Bacon's Rebellion,\" who\r\nwas probably Thomas Matthews, son of Samuel Matthews, some time Governor\r\nof Virginia. The County of Stafford had been carved out of Westmoreland\r\nin the preceding year, and was so called by Colonel Mason in honor of\r\nhis native county of Staffordshire, England. His eldest son, George,\r\nmarried Mary, daughter of Gerard Fowke, of Gunston Hall, in that English\r\ncounty. Their eldest son, George Mason, third of the name, also lived in\r\nAcohick, and lies buried there. George Mason, fourth in descent, and\r\neldest son of George, last named, married a daughter of Stevens Thomson,\r\nof the Middle Temple, attorney-general of Virginia in the reign of Queen\r\nAnne. He resided at Doeg Neck, on the Potomac, then in Stafford, now in\r\nFairfax, and was[649:A] lieutenant and chief commander of Stafford. He\r\nwas drowned by the upsetting of a sail-boat in the Potomac. He left two\r\nsons and a daughter. One of the sons was George, author of the\r\nconstitution of Virginia, and the other, Thomson Mason, a member of the\r\nhouse of burgesses, an eminent lawyer, and true patriot. He was elected\r\none of the judges of the first general court. He suffered from the gout,\r\nand one of Governor Tazewell's earliest recollections is the having seen\r\nhim carried into court when laboring under that disease. His son,\r\nStevens Thomson Mason, was a member of the Virginia Convention of 1788,\r\nand United States Senator, and his son, Armistead Thomson Mason, was\r\nalso a Senator of the United States from Virginia. George Mason, fifth\r\nof the name, was born at Doeg's Neck in 1726; he married Ann Eilbeck, of\r\nCharles County, Maryland, and built a new mansion on the high banks of\r\nthe Potomac, and called it Gunston Hall.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mason was, in 1776, fifty years of age. His complexion was\r\nswarthy, his face grave, with a radiant dark eye, his raven hair\r\nsprinkled with gray; his aspect rather foreign; nearly six feet in\r\nstature, of a large athletic frame, and active step.[649:B] His presence\r\nwas commanding, his bearing lofty. He was fond of hunting and angling.\r\nHe was a systematic, wealthy, and prosperous planter; indifferent to the\r\ntemptations of political ambition; devoting his leisure to study. Mr.\r\nMadison pronounced him the ablest man in debate that he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nAlthough a warm adherent of the house of Hanover, and at the first\r\naverse to independence, yet he assumed the boldest position and\r\nmaintained it. In the year 1766 he concluded a letter to the London\r\nmerchants, on the repeal of the stamp act, thus: \"These are the\r\nsentiments of a man who spends most of his time in retirement, and has\r\nseldom meddled in public affairs; who enjoys a moderate but independent\r\nfortune, and, content with the blessings of a private station, equally\r\ndisregards the smiles and the frowns of the great.\" His pamphlet\r\nentitled \"Extracts from the Virginia Charters, with some Remarks upon\r\nthem,\" was considered a masterly exposition of the rights of the\r\ncolonies.[650:A]\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Mason's sons, George, the eldest, sixth of the name, was captain\r\nin the Virginia line of the Revolution, and inherited Gunston Hall. The\r\nfourth son was the late General John Mason, of Analostan Island, near\r\nWashington City. The Honorable James Murray Mason, United States Senator\r\nfor Virginia, is a son of the last named.[650:B]\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the constitution, containing a recital of wrongs, was\r\nfrom the pen of Mr. Jefferson, who was at that time attending the\r\nsession of congress at Philadelphia.[650:C] George Mason, the author of\r\nthe first written constitution of a free commonwealth ever framed, was\r\npre-eminent in an age[650:D] of great men for his extensive information,\r\nenlarged views, profound wisdom, and the pure simplicity of his\r\nrepublican principles.[650:E] As a speaker he was devoid of rhetorical\r\ngrace, but earnest and impressive.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the adoption of the constitution, the salary of the\r\ngovernor was fixed at one thousand pounds per annum, and Patrick Henry,\r\nJr., was elected the first republican Governor of Virginia, he receiving\r\nsixty votes, and Thomas Nelson, Sr., forty-five.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry received an address from the two regiments which he had\r\nrecently commanded, congratulating him upon his \"unsolicited promotion\r\nto the highest honors a grateful people can bestow,\" and they declared,\r\nas they had been once happy under his military command, they hoped for\r\nmore extensive blessings from his civil administration.\r\n\r\nThe newly-appointed governor closed his reply by saying: \"I trust the\r\nday will come when I shall make one of those that will hail you among\r\nthe triumphant deliverers of America.\" The first council appointed under\r\nthe new constitution consisted of John Page, Dudley Digges, John Tayloe,\r\nJohn Blair, Benjamin Harrison of Berkley, Bartholomew Dandridge, Thomas\r\nNelson, Sr., and Charles Carter, of Shirley. Mr. Nelson declining the\r\nappointment on account of infirm old age, his place was supplied by\r\nBenjamin Harrison, of Brandon. It is a remarkable instance of the\r\nvicissitudes of fortune, that \"a certain Patrick Henry, Jr.,\" against\r\nwhom Governor Dunmore had so lately fulminated his angry proclamation,\r\nnow came to be the occupant of the palace at Williamsburg as governor\r\nand commander-in-chief. Although the leaders of the conservative party\r\nlooked at the contest with Great Britain in a very different light from\r\nthat in which it was viewed by the movement and popular party, and\r\nalthough the animating motives of the two were so different, yet in the\r\nface of imminent common danger they conspired with extraordinary\r\nunanimity in the common cause. So the mainmast of a ship of the line,\r\nthough composed of several pieces banded together, is stronger than if\r\nmade of a single spar.[651:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[644:A] Convention of '76, p. 8, in note.\r\n\r\n[647:A] These facts were stated by Edmund Randolph in his address at the\r\nfuneral of Pendleton.

On the twenty-eighth a committee\r\nwas appointed to prepare a declaration of independence, the members\r\nbeing Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Robert R.\r\nLivingston. Richard Henry Lee being compelled, by the illness of Mrs.\r\nLee, to leave congress on the day of the appointment of the committee,\r\nand to return to Virginia, his place was filled by Roger Sherman. The\r\ndeclaration, adopted on the 4th day of July, 1776, was composed, in\r\ncommittee, mainly by Mr. Jefferson, but much modified by congress. The\r\nVirginia delegates who subscribed it were George Wythe, Richard Henry\r\nLee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Jr., of Berkley, Thomas\r\nNelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, and Carter Braxton.[652:A]\r\n\r\nThomas Nelson, Jr., eldest son of the Honorable William Nelson, some\r\ntime president of the council of Virginia, was born at York, in\r\nDecember, 1738. His mother was of the family of Burwell. After having\r\nbeen under the tuition of the Rev. Mr. Yates, of Gloucester, he was sent\r\nat the age of fifteen to England, where he remained seven years, for the\r\ncompletion of his education. He enjoyed the superintending care of Dr.\r\nPorteus,[653:A] and was at the school of Dr. Newcome, at Hackney, at\r\nEton in 1754, and at Cambridge. While on his voyage returning to\r\nVirginia he was elected (1774) a member of the house of burgesses, being\r\nthen just twenty-one years of age.[653:B] He was a member of the\r\nconventions of 1774 and 1775, and displayed extraordinary boldness in\r\nopposing the British tyranny. He was afterwards appointed colonel of a\r\nVirginia regiment. In 1775 and 1776 he was a member of Congress. There\r\nis a fine portrait of him still preserved, taken, it is said, while he\r\nwas a student at Eton, (by an artist named Chamberlin, London, 1754,)\r\nthe only portrait of him for which he ever sat.[653:C]\r\n\r\nThe first of the Nelsons of Virginia was Thomas, son of Hugh and Sarah\r\nNelson, of Penrith, Cumberland County, England. This Thomas Nelson was\r\nborn in February, 1677, and died in October, 1745, aged sixty-eight. He\r\nmarried, first, a Miss Reid, secondly, a widow Tucker. Coming from a\r\nborder county, he was styled \"Scotch Tom.\" He was an importing merchant.\r\nYorktown was in his day, and for a long time, the chief sea-port town of\r\nVirginia. Of his two sons, Thomas being long secretary of the council,\r\nwas known as Secretary Nelson. Three of his sons were officers in the\r\narmy of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWilliam, the other son of the first Thomas Nelson, imported goods not\r\nonly for Virginia, but at times for Baltimore, and even Philadelphia.\r\nNegroes were a principal subject of importation; merchants and planters\r\nof chief note, some of them leading men in the colony, and patrons of\r\nthe church, engaged in it; and no odium appears to have been attached to\r\na business in which British capital was so largely interested, which was\r\nso constantly encouraged and protected by the British government, and\r\nwhich had been so long an established feature of the colonial system,\r\nand so generally concurred in. John Newton, while personally engaged in\r\nthe slave-trade on board of a Guinea ship, appears to have entertained\r\nat the time no scruples whatever on the subject of his employment. It is\r\nno matter of surprise that a Virginia consignee of slaves should have\r\nreceived them with a like indifference.\r\n\r\nWilliam Nelson married a Miss Burwell, a granddaughter of King Carter.\r\nHaving been long president of the council, and at one time acting\r\ngovernor, he came to be known by the title of President Nelson. He died\r\nin November, 1772, aged sixty-one, leaving an ample estate. His sons\r\nwere Thomas, Hugh, William, Nathaniel, and Robert. A daughter, Betsy,\r\nmarried, in 1769, Captain Thompson, of his majesty's ship Ripon, which\r\nbrought over Lord Botetourt. The portion descending to Thomas, oldest\r\nson of President Nelson, and who had been associated in business with\r\nhim, was estimated at forty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison, Jr., of Berkley, was descended from ancestors who\r\nwere among the early settlers of Virginia. Hermon Harrison came to\r\nVirginia in the second supply, as it was called. One of the name was\r\ngovernor of Bermuda. John Harrison was governor of Virginia in 1623. The\r\ncommon ancestor of the Harrisons of Berkley and of Brandon, was Benjamin\r\nHarrison, of Surrey. He lies buried in the yard of an old chapel near\r\nCabin Point, in that county.[654:A]\r\n\r\nIt was long believed that the Harrisons of Virginia were lineally\r\ndescended from Colonel John Harrison, the regicide and friend of\r\nCromwell, and one of the noblest spirits in a heroic age. This\r\ntradition, however, appears to be erroneous. The first of the family in\r\nVirginia, of whom we have any particular record, was the Honorable\r\nBenjamin Harrison, of Surrey, who was born in that county in 1645,\r\nduring the civil war in England. It is certain that he could not have\r\nbeen a son of Colonel Harrison, the regicide. He may have been a\r\ncollateral relation.\r\n\r\nThe first Benjamin Harrison (of Surrey) had three sons, of whom\r\nBenjamin, the eldest, settled at Berkley. He married Elizabeth, daughter\r\nof Louis Burwell, of Gloucester; was a lawyer, and speaker of the house\r\nof burgesses. He died in April, 1710, aged thirty-seven, leaving an only\r\nson, Benjamin, and an only daughter, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison, Jr., of Berkley, was educated at William and Mary;\r\nmarried a daughter of Robert Carter, of Corotoman;[655:A] and was for\r\nmany years a burgess for his native county, Charles City. In 1764 he was\r\none of the committee chosen to prepare an address to the king, a\r\nmemorial to the lords, and a remonstrance to the commons, in opposition\r\nto the stamp act. Like Pendleton, Bland, and others, he opposed Henry's\r\nresolutions of the following year. He was a member of the committee of\r\ncorrespondence, and of all the conventions held before the organization\r\nof the republican government. He opposed Henry's resolutions for putting\r\nthe colony in a posture of defence, but was appointed one of the\r\ncommittee chosen to carry them into effect. He was elected, in 1774, a\r\ndelegate to the first congress, of which his brother-in-law, Peyton\r\nRandolph, (who married Elizabeth Harrison,) was president. In February,\r\n1776, he remarked in that body: \"We have hobbled on under a fatal\r\nattachment to Great Britain. I felt it as much as any man, but I feel a\r\nstronger for my country.\" As chairman of the committee of the whole\r\nhouse, Mr. Harrison, on the 10th of June, 1776, introduced the\r\nresolution declaring the independence of the colonies, and on the\r\nfourth day of July he reported the Declaration of Independence, of\r\nwhich he was a signer. He was six feet in stature, corpulent, and of a\r\nflorid complexion. He was practical, energetic, frank, epicurean, gouty,\r\ngood-humored, fearless, and patriotic.[656:A]\r\n\r\nThe sons of the first Benjamin Harrison, of Berkley, were Benjamin,\r\nsigner of the Declaration; Charles, a general of the Revolution;\r\nNathaniel, Henry, Collier, and Carter H. From the last-mentioned are\r\ndescended the Harrisons of Cumberland. Benjamin Harrison, Jr., the\r\nsigner, married a Miss Bassett. Their children were Benjamin, Carter,\r\nBassett, member of congress, and William Henry, President of the United\r\nStates. One daughter married a Mr. Richardson, a second married first\r\nWilliam Randolph, of Wilton, and then Captain Richard Singleton; a third\r\nmarried David Copeland, and a fourth married John Minge, of Weyanoke,\r\nafterwards of Sandy Point. So far the Berkley branch of the Harrisons.\r\n\r\nThe second son of Benjamin Harrison, of Surrey, was Nathaniel. His\r\neldest son was of the same name, and his only son was Honorable Benjamin\r\nHarrison, of Brandon, of the council at the same time with his relative\r\nand namesake of Berkley at the commencement of the Revolution. This\r\nBenjamin Harrison, of Brandon, was father of the late George Harrison,\r\nand of William B. Harrison, of Brandon.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wythe was born in 1726, in Elizabeth City County, Virginia, on\r\nthe shore of the Chesapeake. From his maternal grandfather, Keith, a\r\nQuaker, he inherited a taste for letters. His ancestor, Thomas Wythe,\r\nwas burgess for that county in 1718. The father of George was a prudent\r\nfarmer of estimable character.[656:B] George, the second son, losing his\r\nfather at an early age, enjoyed but limited advantages of school\r\neducation, and his early tuition was principally directed by his mother;\r\nand it is related that he acquired a knowledge of the Latin classics\r\nfrom her instructions.[656:C] Mr. Jefferson mentions that while young\r\nWythe was studying the Greek Testament, his mother held an English one\r\nto aid him in the translation. It has been since inferred, from an\r\nexamination of his manuscripts, that this last was the only kind of\r\nassistance that he received from her in the Latin and Greek. He studied\r\nlaw under his uncle, John Lewis, of Prince George; but, upon the death\r\nof his elder brother and his mother, becoming master of a competent\r\nfortune, he fell into habits of idleness and dissipation. Like Swift,\r\nhowever, he was not one who, having wasted part of his life in\r\nindolence, was willing to throw away the remainder in despair; and in\r\nthe society of Governor Fauquier and Professor Small he imbibed their\r\nlove of learning; and at the age of thirty applied himself unremittedly\r\nto study. He became, eventually, distinguished by his attainments in\r\nclassical literature; and he pursued other studies with a like success.\r\nBut he often deplored the loss of so many early golden years. His\r\nlearning, judgment, and industry soon raised him to eminence at the bar.\r\nA member of the house of burgesses as early as 1758, he continued in it\r\nuntil the Revolution. At its dawn Mr. Wythe, in common with Thomas\r\nJefferson and Richard Bland, assumed the ground that the crown was the\r\nonly connecting link between the colonies and the mother country. In\r\n1764 Mr. Wythe was a member of a committee of the house of burgesses\r\nappointed to prepare a petition to the king, a memorial to the lords,\r\nand a remonstrance to the commons, on the subject of the stamp act. He\r\nprepared the remonstrance in conformity with his radical principles; but\r\nit was greatly modified by the assembly. In May, 1765, he, in common\r\nwith Nicholas, Pendleton, Randolph, and Bland, opposed Henry's\r\nresolutions as premature. Mr. Wythe likewise voted (March, 1775,)\r\nagainst Henry's resolutions for putting the colony in a posture of\r\ndefence; but he was in favor of the scheme of Colonel Nicholas for\r\nraising a large regular force. Early in 1775 Mr. Wythe joined a corps of\r\nvolunteers as a private soldier; in August he was elected a member of\r\ncongress. He was returned by the City of Williamsburg to the convention\r\nof that year; but being in attendance on congress his place was filled\r\nby Joseph Prentis. Mr. Wythe signed the Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhich he had strenuously supported in debate.[657:A] Mr. Wythe married\r\nfirst a Miss Lewis, and secondly a Miss Taliaferro.[658:A] He died\r\nchildless. He is described as being distinguished for integrity,\r\npatriotism, and disinterestedness; temperance and regular habits gave\r\nhim good health; engaging and modest manners endeared him to every one;\r\nhis bow was one of most expressive courtesy. His elocution was easy, his\r\nlanguage chaste, his arrangement lucid; his frequent classic quotations,\r\nsmacking a little of pedantry; his style, which aimed at the antique,\r\nwas deficient in elegance and rhythm. Learned, urbane, logical, he was\r\nnot quick and ready, but solid and profound. He was of middle size,\r\nwell-formed, his forehead ample, nose aquiline, eye dark gray,\r\nexpression manly and engaging. His religious opinions were supposed to\r\nbe skeptical; but the closing scene of his life is said to have been\r\nthat of a sincere professor of the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[652:A] Extracts from Orderly Book:--\r\n\r\n                                  \"SPRING FIELD, July 17th, 1776.\r\n\r\n     \"General Lewis hopes that the reports of some of the officers\r\n     gaming to excess is without foundation: he begs that the\r\n     field-officers will make diligent enquiry into it, and if\r\n     true, to arrest such officers, that a total stop may be put to\r\n     so infamous practices.\r\n\r\n     \"Officer for the day LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WEEDON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  \"SPRING FIELD, July 24th, 1776.\r\n\r\n     \"The Declaration of Independency is to be proclaimed to-morrow\r\n     in the City of Williamsburg, by order of the council, when all\r\n     the troops off duty are to attend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \"WILLIAMSBURG, July 26th, 1776.\r\n\r\n                                                \"Parole--Stephen.\r\n\r\n     \"A fatigue of one captain, two subalterns, two sergeants, and\r\n     sixty rank and file, to be warned from the College Camp, to\r\n     carry on the work intended to be thrown up on the road to\r\n     Jamestown.\r\n\r\n     \"Colonel Buckner will please to order a fatigue proportioned\r\n     to his number of men, to work on the road from Burwell's Ferry\r\n     to Williamsburg, at such a place as he shall judge proper to\r\n     fortify.

The father of Richard Henry was Thomas\r\nLee; the mother, Hannah, daughter of Colonel Philip Ludwell, of\r\nGreenspring, of the old family of that name, in Somersetshire, England,\r\nwho were originally, it is said, from Germany. Richard Henry Lee's early\r\ndays were passed somewhat after the Spartan manner, his mother, one of\r\nthe high-toned aristocracy of Virginia, confining her care to her\r\ndaughters and her eldest son, and leaving her younger sons pretty much\r\nto shift for themselves. After a course of private tuition in his\r\nfather's house, Richard Henry was sent to Wakefield Academy, Yorkshire,\r\nEngland, where he distinguished himself by his proficiency in his\r\nstudies, particularly in the Latin and Greek. Having finished his course\r\nat this school, he travelled through England, and visited London. He\r\nreturned when about nineteen years of age to his native country, two\r\nyears after his father's death, which occurred in 1750. Young Lee's\r\nfortune rendering it unnecessary for him to devote himself to a\r\nprofession, he now passed a life of ease, but not of indolence; for he\r\nindulged his taste for letters, and diligently stored his mind with\r\nknowledge in the wide circle of theology, science, history, law,\r\npolitics, and poetry. Being chosen (1755) captain of a company of\r\nvolunteers raised in Westmoreland, he marched with them to Alexandria,\r\nand offered their services to General Braddock in his expedition against\r\nFort Du Quesne; but the offer was declined. In his twenty-fifth year Mr.\r\nLee was appointed a justice of the peace, and shortly after a burgess\r\nfor his county. Naturally diffident, and finding himself surrounded by\r\nmen of extraordinary abilities, for one or two sessions he took no part\r\nin the debates. One of his early efforts was a brief, but strong,\r\nelaborate speech in support of a resolution \"to lay so heavy a tax on\r\nthe importation of slaves as effectually to put an end to that\r\niniquitous and disgraceful traffic within the colony of Virginia;\" and\r\non this occasion he argued against the institution of slavery as a\r\nportentous evil, moral and political.[660:A]\r\n\r\nIn November, 1764, when the meditated stamp act was first heard of in\r\nAmerica, Mr. Lee, at the instance of a friend, wrote to England making\r\napplication for the office of a collector under that act. It was\r\ndifficult to retrieve so unpopular a step. During this year he brought\r\nbefore the assembly the subject of the act of parliament claiming a\r\nright to tax America; and he composed the address to the king, and the\r\nmemorial to the commons. His accomplishments, learning, courtesy,\r\npatriotism, republican principles, decision of character and eloquence,\r\ncommanded the attention of the legislature. Although a member at the\r\ntime of the introduction of Henry's resolutions of 1765, Mr. Lee\r\nhappened not to be present at the discussion; but he heartily concurred\r\nin their adoption; and shortly after their passage organized an\r\nassociation in Westmoreland in furtherance of them. When the\r\ndefalcations of Treasurer Robinson came to be suspected, Mr. Lee, like\r\nPatrick Henry on another occasion of the same kind, insisted with\r\nfirmness on an investigation of the state of the treasury. It was he who\r\nintroduced the motion (November, 1776,) for separating the offices of\r\nspeaker and treasurer; and he had a principal agency, together with\r\nHenry, in carrying that measure into effect.[660:B] A fragment of his\r\nspeech on this occasion is preserved.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding year he vigorously opposed the act laying a duty on\r\ntea, and that for quartering British troops in the colonies. He was now\r\nresiding at Chantilly, his seat on the Potomac, a few miles below\r\nStratford. In July, 1768, in a letter to John Dickinson, of\r\nPennsylvania, Mr. Lee suggested that not only select committees should\r\nbe appointed by all the colonies, but that a private correspondence\r\nshould be conducted between the lovers of liberty in every province.\r\nThe Virginia Assembly, in 1773, (about the same time with that of\r\nMassachusetts,) appointed a committee of correspondence, consisting of\r\nsix members, of whom Mr. Lee was one. In the next year he was a delegate\r\nin the congress that met at Philadelphia. Patrick Henry spoke first, and\r\nhe was followed by Richard Henry Lee.\r\n\r\nHe was an active and laborious member of the leading committees, and he\r\ncomposed the memorial to the people of British America--a masterly\r\ndocument.[661:A] When Washington was chosen commander-in-chief, Mr. Lee,\r\nas chairman of the committee chosen for the occasion, prepared the\r\ncommission and instructions. He prepared the second address to the\r\npeople of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1776, the convention of Virginia passed a resolution instructing\r\nher delegates in congress to propose to that body to declare the\r\ncolonies free and independent; and when those instructions were received\r\nat Philadelphia, the delegation appointed Mr. Lee to bring forward a\r\nproposition to that effect. He accordingly, on the second of June, made\r\nthat motion, which was seconded by John Adams. On the tenth Mr. Lee\r\nreceived by express, from Virginia, intelligence of the dangerous\r\nillness of his wife; and he, therefore, left Philadelphia on the\r\neleventh, the day on which a committee was appointed to draught a\r\ndeclaration of independence. Had he remained he might have been chairman\r\nof that committee, and author of the Declaration of Independence.[661:B]\r\n\r\nThat instrument was adopted on the eighth of July, and shortly\r\nafterwards Mr. Jefferson enclosed to Mr. Lee the original draught, and\r\nalso a copy of it as adopted by Congress. In August Mr. Lee resumed his\r\nseat in that body.\r\n\r\nHe was in person tall and well proportioned; his features bold and\r\nexpressive; nose, Roman; forehead high, not wide; eyes light colored;\r\nthe contour of his face noble. He had lost by an accident the use of one\r\nof his hands; and was sometimes styled \"the gentleman of the silver\r\nhand;\" he kept it covered with a black silk bandage, but leaving his\r\nthumb free. Notwithstanding this disadvantage his gesture was very\r\ngraceful. His voice was melodious, his elocution Ciceronian, his diction\r\nelegant and easy. His eloquence flowed on in tranquil beauty, like the\r\nstream of his own Potomac.[662:A] He was a member of the Episcopal\r\nchurch. He married first a Miss Aylett, and the children of that union\r\nwere two sons and two daughters; secondly a lady named Pinkard, a widow.\r\n\r\nFrancis Lightfoot Lee, brother of Richard Henry, was born in October,\r\n1734. He was educated under a private tutor. He inherited an independent\r\nfortune. He became, in 1765, a member of the house of burgesses, and\r\ncontinued in that body until 1775, when the convention returned him a\r\nmember of congress, in which he remained until 1779, when he re-entered\r\nthe assembly. His talents, as an orator and statesman, were of a high\r\norder, but it appears that he was never able to overcome his natural\r\ndiffidence. His seat was Monocan, in the County of Richmond. He married\r\nRebecca, daughter of Colonel John Tayloe, of Richmond County.\r\n\r\nCarter Braxton was born at Newington, on the Matapony, in King and\r\nQueen, in September, 1736. His father, George Braxton, a wealthy\r\nplanter, married Mary, daughter of Robert Carter, of the council, and in\r\n1748 represented the County of King and Queen, being the colleague of\r\nJohn (known as speaker) Robinson. Carter Braxton was educated at the\r\ncollege of William and Mary. Inheriting in his youth, upon his father's\r\ndeath, a large estate, at the age of nineteen he married Judith,\r\ndaughter of Christopher Robinson, of Middlesex. She dying, in 1757, Mr.\r\nBraxton visited England, where he remained for several years, and\r\nreturned in 1760: a diary which he kept while abroad is preserved by his\r\ndescendants. He married, in 1761, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Richard\r\nCorbin, of Laneville. During his first marriage he built a mansion at\r\nElsin Green, on the Pamunkey, and afterwards another at Chericoke on the\r\nsame river. He lived in a style of lavish hospitality, according to the\r\nfashion of that day. He was, in 1761, a member of the house of\r\nburgesses from the County of King William, and took an active part in\r\nthe session of 1765. His colleague was Bernard Moore, of Chelsea,\r\nson-in-law of Governor Spotswood. Mr. Braxton was, in 1769, a delegate\r\nand a signer of the non-importation agreement. He was a member of the\r\nconvention of 1774. In the following year, when Henry at the head of a\r\nparty of volunteers had advanced within sixteen miles of Williamsburg,\r\nfor the purpose of recovering the gunpowder removed by Dunmore, Mr.\r\nBraxton interposed his efforts to prevent extremities. In this course\r\nMr. Braxton coincided with the moderate councils of Pendleton, Nicholas,\r\nand Peyton Randolph. During this year Mr. Braxton was a member of the\r\nassembly, and of the convention that met at Richmond. He was also one of\r\nthe committee of safety. In December he was elected a delegate to\r\ncongress in the place of Peyton Randolph, and he was a signer of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. The convention having, in June, 1776,\r\nreduced the number of delegates in congress from seven to five, Mr.\r\nHarrison and Mr. Braxton were not re-elected. According to\r\nGirardin,[663:A] Mr. Braxton's \"Address on Government\" was not\r\nuniversally relished, (it was indeed severely denounced, as has been\r\nseen,) and his popularity had been in some degree impaired by persons\r\nwhose political indiscretions, though beyond his control, fatally\r\nreacted against him. He was, nevertheless, returned by the County of\r\nKing William a member of the convention, and if he had fallen under a\r\ncloud of suspicion, it appears to have been soon dispersed, for, in\r\nOctober, 1776, the thanks of the convention were unanimously returned to\r\nThomas Jefferson and Carter Braxton, for their ability, diligence, and\r\nintegrity, as delegates in congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[660:A] Life of Richard Henry Lee, i. 17.\r\n\r\n[660:B] _S.

Dunmore with his fleet\r\nleft Hampton Roads about the first of June, and entrenched himself with\r\nfive hundred men, including many runaway negroes, on Gwynn's Island, in\r\nthe Chesapeake, to the east of Matthews County, and separated from it by\r\na strait.[664:A]\r\n\r\nIn the evening of July the eighth, General Andrew Lewis, with Colonel\r\nAdam Stephen, reached the camp before Gwynn's Island, and during the\r\nnight a battery was erected. Next morning the enemy's fleet lying within\r\nrange, the embrasures were unmasked, and a fire opened upon the Dunmore.\r\nThis ship, after firing a few guns, cut her cables and retreated, towed\r\noff by boats, two batteries playing on her. She was damaged, her cabin\r\nshattered, and some men killed. Lord Dunmore himself was wounded in the\r\nleg by a splinter, and had his china-ware smashed about him, and\r\nexclaimed, as was reported: \"Good God, that ever I should come to this!\"\r\nThe other vessels did not escape with impunity, and all retired in\r\nconfusion to a safe distance. The guns of the batteries were now turned\r\nupon the enemy's camp, the shot crossing each other in the centre of\r\nit, and the troops were dislodged. On the next morning Lewis, with the\r\naid of some canoes, captured two small armed vessels, and some of his\r\nmen landing on the island, the look-outs ran exclaiming, \"the Shirt-men\r\nare coming!\" a panic seized Dunmore's men, so that they precipitately\r\nevacuated the island, (before two hundred and fifty of the Provincials\r\ncould be landed on the island,) and the boats of the fleet, consisting\r\nof eighty sail, took them on board. They left valuable stores behind,\r\nand burnt some vessels. The inhabitants reported that Dunmore had\r\nrecently received a re-enforcement of one hundred and fifty tories from\r\nMaryland, and some cattle. Part of these last fell into Lewis's hands. A\r\ndetachment was sent to protect the people on the Potomac. Numerous\r\nhalf-covered graves on the island gave proof of the fatality of the\r\nplace, and the bodies of negroes were found lying unburied. The\r\nsmall-pox was left as a legacy to the island. Among the graves was one\r\nneatly done up with turf, which was supposed to cover the remains of\r\nLord Gosport, who had recently died. Ovens, newly erected, and a\r\nwindmill commenced, made it evident that Lord Dunmore had contemplated a\r\nlonger stay there. It was reported that he was sick. The negroes,\r\nhorses, cattle, and furniture of Mr. John Grymes, a tory, fell into\r\npossession of the Provincials. Major Byrd, who was sick, upon their\r\napproach was conveyed to Cherry Point in a cart, and embarked there.\r\nDunmore shortly afterwards, despatching the remnant of his followers to\r\nFlorida and the West Indies, retired to the North, and thence returned\r\nto England, where he continued to exhibit himself an untiring opponent\r\nof America. He entertained hospitably in London the Virginia refugee\r\nloyalists Randolph, Grymes, Brockenbrough, Beverley, Wormley, Corbin,\r\nand others. Lord Dunmore was appointed (1786) Governor of Bermuda, and\r\ndied in 1809.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of July, 1775, Washington had assumed the command of the\r\nAmerican army, encamped near Boston, and had made his headquarters at\r\nCambridge. His first business was to organize, equip, and discipline his\r\nforce. The British army, blocked up on the land side, remained inactive\r\nin Boston, finding itself, although strongly re-enforced, gradually\r\nhemmed in and besieged.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, in pursuance of the Quebec act, a Canadian force\r\nhaving been marched into the colonies, and it being the manifest design\r\nof the enemy to bring down the savages upon the frontier, a detachment\r\nwas sent to invade Canada. Marching under command of Montgomery, they\r\ncrossed Lake Champlain, and laid siege to Fort St. Johns, the key to\r\nCanada, strengthened by Carleton, the ablest of the British generals,\r\nand strongly garrisoned. During this siege a detachment, penetrating\r\nfurther into the country, captured Fort Chamblee, between St. Johns and\r\nMontreal. Carleton, marching to the relief of St. Johns, was met and\r\ndefeated. St. Johns, after a siege of forty-seven days, in a rigorous\r\nseason, and in a low and wet ground, where the besiegers slept on piles\r\nof brush, covered over with weeds, to keep out of the water,\r\nsurrendered. November the thirteenth Montreal capitulated to the gallant\r\nIrishman, General Montgomery. Arnold, accompanied by Morgan and Greene,\r\nrubbing through exposure, hardship, and privation, made his way into\r\nCanada by the Kennebec and Chaudière Rivers, and was about to unite his\r\nforces with Montgomery's. At this time it appeared as if the whole of\r\nCanada would probably soon be reduced, and it was confidently expected\r\nthat Canadian delegates would shortly appear in congress, and complete\r\nthe union of fourteen colonies. This brilliant prospect was soon\r\novercast; Montgomery fell in a daring but unsuccessful attack upon\r\nQuebec. Re-enforcements of American troops were sent to Canada, but\r\nowing to their insufficiency in number and in discipline, the rigor of\r\nthe climate, and the energy of Carleton, the British commander, the\r\nexpedition eventually proved fruitless in effecting a conquest; and it\r\nwas found necessary to evacuate that country. While these reverses\r\noccurred by land, it was observed with satisfaction that the colonies\r\nabounded in materials and resources requisite for building up a naval\r\nforce; and in some of the colonies vessels were arming. Richard Henry\r\nLee, in a letter to Mrs. McCauley, of England, compared America on the\r\nsea, in that year, to \"Hercules in his cradle.\" The American navy was\r\nindeed \"nursed in the whirlwind and cradled in the storm.\"\r\n\r\nThe British army at Boston, admonished by the scenes of Lexington,\r\nConcord, and Bunker's Hill, and finding their position more and more\r\nrestricted by Washington's lines of fortification, remained in gloomy\r\ninaction until March, 1776, when Sir William Howe, who had succeeded\r\nGeneral Gage, evacuated that city, and sailed with the troops and many\r\nunhappy tory refugees to Halifax.\r\n\r\nThe American army proceeded to New York. Early in July, 1776, Sir\r\nWilliam Howe with his army landed on Staten Island. The commander of the\r\nfleet was Lord Howe, brother of Sir William, and these two were\r\nconstituted commissioners for restoring peace. In the battle of Long\r\nIsland, which occurred on the twenty-seventh of August, the American\r\narmy, inferior in number, and without cavalry, fought confusedly and\r\nbadly, and was defeated with heavy loss, variously estimated. Among the\r\nprisoners was Major-General Sullivan. The enemy's loss was by no means\r\ninconsiderable. From the commencement of the battle on the morning of\r\nthe twenty-seventh till the morning of the twenty-ninth, Washington\r\nnever slept, and was almost incessantly on horseback. The disastrous\r\nresult of this action cast a gloom over the cause of independence,\r\nelated disaffection, and damped the ardor of the American troops. The\r\nmilitia in large numbers quit the camp and went home; and Washington was\r\nobliged to confess his \"want of confidence in the generality of the\r\ntroops.\" He urged upon congress the necessity of a permanent army. On\r\nthe fifteenth of September he was compelled to evacuate New York, with\r\nthe loss of his heavy artillery and a large part of his stores, and\r\nGeneral Howe took possession of the city.\r\n\r\nIn a skirmish on Haerlem Heights, a detachment of the third Virginia\r\nregiment, which had arrived on the preceding day, formed the advanced\r\nparty in the attack, and Major Leitch, while intrepidly leading them on,\r\nfell mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Washington's solicitation congress made arrangements\r\nto put the army on a better footing. To obviate the movements of the\r\nenemy he moved his forces up the Hudson River. On the twenty-fifth of\r\nOctober the battle of White Plains took place, warmly contested, with\r\nequal loss, and without decisive result. In November Fort Washington, on\r\nthe Hudson, was stormed by the British, and the garrison, consisting of\r\ntwenty-six hundred men, were made prisoners. Washington is said to have\r\nshed tears on occasion of this disaster. The enemy's loss was eight\r\nhundred. Early in December Washington, finding his army sadly reduced,\r\nretreated across Jersey. They were pursued by a British army, numerous,\r\nwell-appointed, and victorious. At this conjuncture Major-General Lee\r\nwas surprised and made prisoner--as is now believed--by collusion with\r\nthe enemy.[668:A] The reanimated spirit of disaffection rendered the\r\nAmerican cause still more hopeless. December the twentieth, Washington's\r\narmy on the west bank of the Delaware, augmented by re-enforcements,\r\namounted to seven thousand effectives; but in a few days all of them,\r\nexcept about fifteen hundred men, were to be discharged upon the\r\nexpiration of the term of enlistment. Washington became convinced that\r\nsome bold enterprise was necessary to rekindle the patriotic spirit, and\r\nlistening to the advice of those about him, resolved to strike at the\r\nposts of the enemy, who had retired securely into winter quarters.\r\nCrossing the Delaware, a few miles above Trenton, in a night of extreme\r\ncold, amid floating ice, he early on the morning of the twenty-six\r\nsurprised there a body of Hessians, and made one thousand prisoners.\r\nLieutenant Monroe, afterwards president, was wounded in this affair.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Baylor, of Virginia, aid of the commander-in-chief,\r\ncarrying the intelligence of this success to congress, was presented\r\nwith a horse caparisoned for service, and was recommended for promotion.\r\nNear Princeton another corps was routed with heavy loss; but the joy of\r\nthe Americans was mingled with grief for the loss of General Mercer.\r\n\r\nHugh Mercer, a native of Scotland, having been graduated in the medical\r\nprofession, was present, in the capacity of assistant surgeon, at the\r\nbattle of Flodden, on the side of the vanquished. Escaping, he came to\r\nAmerica, and settled at Fredericksburg, in Virginia, where he married,\r\nand successfully pursued his profession. During the French and Indian\r\nwar of 1755 he was a captain under Washington. In an engagement, being\r\nwounded in the wrist by a musket ball, separated from his comrades, and\r\nfaint with loss of blood, he was closely pursued by the savage foe,\r\nwhose war-whoop rang through the surrounding forests. Concealing himself\r\nin the hollow trunk of a giant tree, he narrowly escaped. After a\r\njourney of more than one hundred miles through an untrodden wilderness,\r\nand supporting life on roots and the body of a rattlesnake, he finally\r\nreached Fort Cumberland. For his gallant conduct the City of\r\nPhiladelphia presented him an honorary medal. In 1775 he was in command\r\nof three regiments of minute-men, and in 1776 a colonel of the Virginia\r\ntroops, and rendered important services in drilling and organizing the\r\nnew levies. In quelling a mutiny in a company of riflemen called,\r\nironically, \"Gibson's Lambs,\" at Williamsburg, whom he disarmed, he\r\ndisplayed that intrepidity and decision for which he was so\r\ndistinguished. During the same year, being made a brigadier-general in\r\nthe continental army, he exhibited signal courage and energy throughout\r\na disastrous campaign. On the 3d day of January, 1777, this excellent\r\nofficer, leading the van of Washington's army, encountered, about\r\nsunrise, near Princeton, three British regiments, and while rallying his\r\ntroops his horse was shot from under him, and he fell dangerously\r\nwounded, and died shortly afterwards in a small house near the scene of\r\nthe encounter. He was attended by Major George Lewis, a nephew of\r\nGeneral Washington, who had sent him to perform that duty, and by Dr.\r\nRush.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Mercer forms the subject of a picture long familiar\r\nto the students of the college of New Jersey. He lies buried in Christ\r\nChurch, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[664:A] There is a tradition that Pocahontas, in swimming across the\r\nPyanketank, was near being drowned, and was rescued by one of the\r\ncolonists, who received from her, or her father, this island as a\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n[668:A] George H.

He was in attendance as a member of the house of\r\ndelegates at its first session, and was struck with apoplexy while\r\nwalking in the streets. His intellectual calibre was capacious, his\r\neducation finished, his habits of application indefatigable. Thoroughly\r\nversed in the charters, laws, and history of the colony, he was styled\r\nthe \"Virginia Antiquary.\" He was a political character of the first\r\nrank, a profound logician, and as a writer perhaps unsurpassed in the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nHis letter to the clergy, published in 1760, and his enquiry into the\r\nrights of the colonies, are monuments of his patriotism, his learning,\r\nand the vigor of his understanding. He was an ungraceful speaker. It is\r\nsaid that he was pronounced by Mr. Jefferson to be \"the wisest man south\r\nof the James River.\" He resided at Jordan's Point, on the James, in\r\nPrince George. His portrait and that of his wife were mutilated by the\r\nbayonets of British soldiers during the revolutionary war.[670:A] His\r\nwife had died in 1758, aged forty-six years.\r\n\r\nThe Blands of Virginia derive their name from Bland, a place in or near\r\nLonsdale, in Westmoreland, or Cumberland, England. William de Bland\r\nflourished in the reign of Edward the Third, and did good service in the\r\nwars which that king carried on in France, in company of John of Gaunt,\r\nEarl of Richmond. Thomas de Bland obtained a pardon from Richard the\r\nSecond, for killing his antagonist in a duel, by the intercession of\r\nhis friend the Duke of Guyenne and Lancaster. The coat of arms of Bland\r\nis quartered by the family of Wansford, of Kirklington, in the County of\r\nYork, afterwards Lord Viscount Castle-Comer, in the kingdom of Ireland;\r\nand the family of Thistlewait, of Thistlewait, bear the arms of Bland\r\nfor their paternal coat as descended from the ancient family of Bland.\r\nEdward Bland, of Burfield, died in the reign of Edward the Fourth; from\r\nhim was descended Adam Bland, who lived in the reign of Edward the\r\nSixth. John Bland was free of the \"Grocers and Merchants Adventurers\r\nCompany.\" Thomas Bland, receiver of the rents for Yorkshire in the time\r\nof Charles the First, married, secondly, Katherine, sister of Sir\r\nRichard Sandys, of Northbourne, in Kent. Giles Bland, collector of the\r\ncustoms for James River, owing to a quarrel with Sir William Berkley,\r\nbecame a partisan of Bacon, and was executed during the rebellion.\r\nEdward Bland, a merchant in Spain, (1643,) afterwards removed to\r\nVirginia, where he lived at Kimages, in Charles City County. Robert\r\nBland was rector of Weyborough-magna, with the chapel of Sale appendant,\r\nin the County of Essex. Richard Bland, of the company of \"Framework\r\nKnitters,\" was Lord of the manor of Preston Hall, and Lord Mayor of\r\nPreston. Theodorick Bland was some time a merchant at Luars in Spain,\r\nbut came over to Virginia in the year 1654. He settled at Westover, on\r\nJames River, where he died April 23d, 1671, aged forty-one, and was\r\nburied in the chancel of the church which he built, and gave, together\r\nwith ten acres of land, a court-house and prison, for the county and\r\nparish. His tombstone is to be found in Westover churchyard, lying\r\nbetween those of two of his friends; the church has disappeared long\r\nago. This Theodorick Bland was one of the king's council for Virginia,\r\nand was both in fortune and understanding inferior to no person of his\r\ntime in the country. He married the daughter of Richard Bennet, Esq.,\r\nsometime governor of the colony. Richard Bland, born at Berkley, son of\r\nthis Theodorick Bland, married, first, Mary, daughter of Colonel Thomas\r\nSwan; secondly, Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel William Randolph, of\r\nTurkey Island, on James River. Mary Bland, eldest daughter of Richard\r\nBland, gentleman, of Jordans, born 1704, married Colonel Henry Lee, of\r\nWestmoreland. Elizabeth, second daughter of said Richard Bland, married\r\nColonel William Beverley, of Essex County. Theodorick Bland, Sr., of\r\nCawsons, in Prince George, was clerk of that county and member of the\r\nhouse of burgesses. He married Frances Boiling. The children of that\r\nunion were Theodorick Bland, Jr., and four daughters, Elizabeth, Mary,\r\nAnna, and Jenny. Theodorick Bland, Sr., married, secondly, a widow\r\nYates. Theodorick Bland, Jr., was a colonel of a regiment of horse\r\nduring the revolutionary war, a member of congress, and of the\r\nconvention of Virginia that ratified the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Patsy, daughter of Theodorick Bland, Sr., married Colonel John\r\nBanister, of Battersea, near Petersburg, member of the convention of\r\n1776, lieutenant-colonel of cavalry during the war of Revolution, and\r\nmember of congress. Frances, another daughter of Theodorick Bland, Sr.,\r\nmarried John Randolph, of Matoax, and these were the parents of John\r\nRandolph, of Roanoke, the orator, who was born at Cawsons, in Prince\r\nGeorge County, the residence of Theodorick Bland, Sr. The mother of John\r\nRandolph, of Roanoke, married, secondly, St. George Tucker, judge of the\r\ncourt of appeals of Virginia, and subsequently district judge of the\r\nfederal court.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees, instigated by the English, having made bloody incursions\r\non the Virginia frontier, Colonel Christian, with a body of troops,\r\nburnt their towns, and compelled them to sue for peace.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of October, 1776, the general assembly of Virginia met\r\nfor the first time under the constitution adopted in the preceding July.\r\nThe house of delegates was composed of the same members as those who\r\nconstituted the convention which framed the constitution, and who held\r\nover without an election, and thus became the house of delegates under\r\nthe constitution of their own making. The examples which probably guided\r\nthem were, that of the convention of 1660, which, after calling Charles\r\nthe Second to the throne, resolved itself into a house of commons; and\r\nthat of the convention of 1688, which, after settling the crown on\r\nWilliam and Mary, also resolved itself into a house of commons. The new\r\nsenate, however, was elected by the people.[673:A] Edmund Pendleton was\r\nelected speaker of the house, and Archibald Cary speaker of the senate.\r\n\r\nThe new declaration of rights asserted that \"all men are equally\r\nentitled to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of\r\nconscience;\" yet it appeared that the assembly intended to continue the\r\nold church establishment. This and the circulation of petitions in\r\nbehalf of episcopacy, as established by law, alarmed the dissenters, and\r\nthey enquired what advantage then in this great point \"shall we derive\r\nfrom being independent of Great Britain? And is it not as bad for our\r\nassembly to violate their own declaration of rights as for the British\r\nparliament to break our charter?\" The Baptists accordingly circulated a\r\ncounter-petition, which was signed by ten thousand persons, chiefly\r\nfreeholders. The presbytery of Hanover also presented a memorial to the\r\nsame effect, pledging themselves that nothing in their power should be\r\nwanting to give success to the cause of the country. In the frontier\r\ncounties, containing one-fifth of the inhabitants of Virginia, the\r\ndissenters, who constituted almost the entire population, were yet\r\nobliged to contribute to the support of the church as established, and a\r\nconsiderable portion of the inhabitants of the other parts of the colony\r\nlabored under the same disadvantages. \"Certain it is,\" say the\r\nmemorialists, \"that every argument for civil liberty gains additional\r\nstrength when applied to liberty in the concerns of religion; and there\r\nis no argument in favor of establishing the Christian religion but what\r\nmay be pleaded with equal propriety for establishing the tenets of\r\nMohammed by those who believe the Alcoran; or, if this be not true, it\r\nis at least impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of\r\npreference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith,\r\nwithout erecting a chair of infallibility which would lead us back to\r\nthe church of Rome.\" Religious establishments (they contended) are\r\ninjurious to the temporal interests of any community; and the more early\r\nsettlement of Virginia, and her natural advantages, would have\r\nattracted hither multitudes of industrious and useful members of\r\nsociety, but they had either remained in their place of nativity, or\r\npreferred worse civil governments and a more barren soil, where they\r\nmight enjoy the rights of conscience more fully. Nor did religion need\r\nthe aid of an establishment; on the contrary, as her weapons are\r\nspiritual, Christianity would flourish in the greatest purity when left\r\nto her native excellence; and the duty which we owe our Creator can only\r\nbe directed by reason and conviction.\r\n\r\nThis memorial was composed, in behalf of the presbytery, by the Rev.\r\nCaleb Wallace, of Charlotte County, a graduate of Princeton. He was in\r\nattendance upon the assembly for six or eight weeks for the furthering\r\nof this object.[674:A]\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the established church presented petitions in favor of\r\ncontinuing the establishment, and they were re-enforced by the\r\nMethodists as a society in communion with the Church of England. It was\r\nurged that good faith to the clergy required that they should not be\r\ndeprived of their livings, which belonged to them for life, or during\r\ngood behaviour; that an ecclesiastical establishment was in itself a\r\ndesirable institution, it being for the benefit of the community that a\r\nbody of Christian ministers should be thus supported; and that if all\r\ndenominations were reduced to an equality, the contest for superiority\r\namong them would involve confusion, and probably civil commotion; and\r\nfinally that a majority of the people of Virginia desired to have the\r\nchurch establishment maintained.\r\n\r\nThe assembly exempted dissenters from contributions for the support of\r\nthe Church of England, and repealed all penal laws against any mode of\r\nworship, leaving all denominations for the present to support their\r\nclergy by voluntary contributions, and reserving the consideration \"of a\r\ngeneral assessment for the support of religion\" to a future session, so\r\nthat the sense of the people on that subject might be, in the mean time,\r\ncollected.[675:A] This matter was debated for a day or two in the house,\r\nand gave rise to some newspaper controversy. Religious freedom was\r\ngaining ground; but, although all penal statutes were repealed, the\r\nrestrictions and penalties sanctioned by the common law remained.\r\n\r\nIn the struggle that preceded the Revolution more than two-thirds of the\r\nVirginia clergy of the established church and a portion of the lay\r\nmembers were loyalists. Of those clergymen who adhered to the patriotic\r\nside several were men of note, such as Jarratt, Madison, (afterwards the\r\nfirst bishop of Virginia,) Bracken, Muhlenburg, of the Valley of the\r\nShenandoah, who accepted a colonel's commission, raised a regiment, and\r\nserved throughout the war; and Thruston, who also became a colonel.\r\n\r\nCongress having ordered the army to be augmented to eighty-eight\r\nbattalions, to serve during the continuance of the war, a quota of\r\nfifteen battalions was assigned to Virginia; and to complete them the\r\nassembly took measures to raise seven battalions in addition to those\r\nalready embodied. Attention was bestowed upon the building up of a naval\r\nforce, and men were transferred from the army to the marine service.\r\nInfantry and cavalry, speedily raised and well officered, were sent to\r\njoin General Washington, and measures were adopted for calling forth the\r\nresources of Virginia, and to strengthen her for the exigencies of war.\r\nCourts of admiralty were established; entails abolished, the bill for\r\nthis purpose being framed by Mr. Jefferson; treason was defined, and\r\npenalties denounced against such as should maintain and defend the\r\nauthority of the king or parliament, or should excite sedition in the\r\nState; importation from Great Britain was prohibited; loyalist British\r\nfactors were ordered to depart from the commonwealth under a statute of\r\ntwenty-seventh year of Edward the Third.\r\n\r\nGovernor Henry, owing to the state of his health, retired, with the\r\nconcurrence of the assembly, to the country. An effort made at this time\r\nby David Rogers, a member of the senate, and some other malecontents in\r\nWest Augusta, to erect themselves into a separate state, proved\r\nabortive. Robert C. Nicholas, resigning the office of treasurer,\r\nreceived the thanks of the legislature for his faithful discharge of the\r\nduties of his office. He was succeeded by George Webb. The estate of\r\nLord Dunmore was disposed of, and the proceeds appropriated to the\r\npayment of his debts.[676:A] Jefferson, Pendleton, Wythe, Mason, and\r\nThomas Ludwell Lee were appointed a committee to revise the laws. By the\r\nresignation of Mr. Mason, and the indisposition of Mr. Lee, the duty\r\neventually devolved upon the other three.\r\n\r\nCongress, with a view of gaining the alliance of France, appointed three\r\ncommissioners to that court: Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Thomas\r\nJefferson. Mr. Jefferson declined the appointment, and it was then given\r\nto Dr. Arthur Lee.\r\n\r\nToward the close of this session of the Virginia Assembly, when\r\nWashington was retreating through the Jerseys, and when the cause of\r\nindependence seemed almost desperate, several of the members, it is\r\nsaid, meditated, in imitation of the Roman Republic, the appointment of\r\na dictator. The tradition is, that such was the animosity engendered by\r\nthis scheme, that they who espoused, and they who opposed it, walked on\r\nopposite sides of the street. Who they were that favored it, or where it\r\nwas concocted, or how developed, does not appear. It is reported,\r\nindeed, that Patrick Henry was the person held in view as the dictator;\r\nbut that he suggested the plan, or favored it, or consented to it, or\r\nwas in any way privy to it, there is no evidence to prove, nor has it\r\neven been alleged. The tradition (resting on no testimony) relates, that\r\nArchibald Cary, a man of violent temper, and a life-long opponent of\r\nHenry, sent a message to the governor, (by his brother-in-law, Colonel\r\nSyme,) that on the day in which he should accept the dictatorship he\r\nshould fall by his dagger; and the Colonel has been compared to\r\nBrutus--as if the example was worthy of imitation, or as if a dictator\r\nappointed by a Virginia assembly can be justly compared to Julius Cæsar\r\nat the head of his legions, usurping the government by his sword.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina invested her governor, John Rutledge, a native of\r\nIreland, with dictatorial powers during the revolutionary war. The\r\nVirginia assembly at this session invested Governor Henry with several\r\nextraordinary powers, and recommended to congress \"to invest the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the American forces with more ample and extensive\r\npowers for conducting the operations of the war.\" Washington urged the\r\nStates to clothe their executives with extraordinary powers, and he\r\nhimself was invested by congress with such. The safety of the people,\r\nthe supreme law, may demand, in a crisis of extreme danger, the\r\nappointment of an officer charged with extraordinary powers, (but who,\r\nnevertheless, would be as much the creature of law as any ordinary judge\r\nor deputy-sheriff,) \"to take care that the Republic shall receive no\r\ndetriment.\"\r\n\r\nA year or two before the rupture with the mother country, the Presbytery\r\nof Hanover established a seminary in Augusta, beyond the Blue Ridge. The\r\nRev. Samuel Stanhope Smith, who had been a teacher of languages in the\r\nCollege of New Jersey, was at this time a missionary in Virginia, and\r\nthe school was founded upon his recommendation. The superintendent was\r\nJohn Brown, and the tutor William Graham. From this seminary Washington\r\nCollege, at Lexington, arose. By the advice of Rev. S. S. Smith it was\r\ndetermined to found another seminary east of the Blue Ridge, and the\r\nfunds were raised by subscription; and although it was a period of\r\napprehension and alarm, yet the enterprise was urged with energy and\r\nsuccess.[677:A] This work was accomplished in 1775, amid the throes of\r\nrevolution, and Prince Edward Academy, the original foundation of\r\nHampden Sidney College, was opened in January, 1776.[678:A]\r\n\r\nIncreased educational means were much needed, all communication with\r\nGreat Britain being cut off; and educated youth would be wanting to fill\r\nthe places of such as would soon fall victims of the war. The College of\r\nWilliam and Mary was indeed old and tolerably well endowed; but it was\r\nnear the scene of war and surrounded by noisy camps. In a short time\r\nmore than a hundred students flocked to the Prince Edward Academy, and\r\ntheir number exceeded the means of accommodation. During the year a\r\nmilitary company of the students was organized, Mr. John Blair Smith,\r\nJr., a tutor, being captain. The uniform was a purple hunting-shirt.\r\nThis company, upon a requisition of the governor for militia from Prince\r\nEdward during the following year, marched to Williamsburg, where,\r\nhowever, their services were not required. Some of them became officers\r\nin the army, and others enlisted as common soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 the convention of Virginia had directed the committee of safety\r\nto procure armed vessels, for the better defence of the colony; and the\r\ncontrol and management were entrusted to them. The few small vessels and\r\nbarges in their service were useful in restraining the tories, in\r\nprotecting property, and in recapturing fugitive slaves. In May, 1776, a\r\nboard of naval commissioners was appointed, consisting of Thomas\r\nWhiting, John Hutchins, Champion Travis, Thomas Newton, Jr., and George\r\nWebb. They met for the first time on the eighth of July following, at\r\nWilliamsburg. About seventy vessels appear to have been in service at\r\nsome time or other during the war of Revolution--including thirty ships,\r\nbrigs, and brigantines, and thirty-eight smaller vessels.[678:B] Many of\r\nthe vessels were built at the Chickahominy navy-yard, South Quay,\r\nHampton, and near Norfolk. Early in April, 1776, George Mason, of the\r\ncommittee of safety, had charge of the building of two galleys, and of\r\n\"the American Congress,\" this last to carry fourteen guns, four and\r\nsix-pounders, and her complement of marines and seamen being ninety-six\r\nmen. The look-outs were a sort of winged sentries, and were exposed to\r\nhard service. But a small part of the vessels of the Virginia navy were\r\nin actual service at any one time; and there was a deplorable want of\r\nmen, some having not more than one-twentieth of their full number. The\r\nvessels usually served separately, but early in the contest Commodore\r\nBoucher commanded fifteen sail in the Potomac; and at another time\r\nCaptain Richard Taylor was in command of a squadron in Hampton Roads.\r\nThe Virginia-built vessels, although plain and simple in their\r\nconstruction, were very fast sailers. This, together with their lighter\r\ndraught and familiarity with the waters, often enabled them to escape\r\nfrom the enemy. Of all the vessels of the Virginia navy not one remains.\r\n\r\nJames Maxwell, Esq., was superintendent of the navy-yard on the\r\nChickahominy, and he was assisted by Captain Christopher Calvert. The\r\nformer officer commanded the ship Cormorant in 1782. He was father of\r\nthe late William Maxwell, Esq., Secretary of the Virginia Historical\r\nSociety. The three commodores commissioned during the struggle were J.\r\nBoucher, Walter Brooke, and James Barron. Richard Barron, brother of\r\nJames, was a captain during the whole war. The Barrons appear to have\r\nhad a natural proclivity for the water. Lieutenant William Barron, of\r\nthe continental navy, lost his life by the bursting of a gun on board of\r\nthe frigate Boston, in bringing to a vessel off the coast of France, in\r\n1778. John Adams, and his son John Quincy, then a boy, were on board of\r\nthis ship on this occasion. Mr. Adams held the lieutenant in his arms\r\nwhile his leg was amputated. This William Barron had been a lieutenant\r\nin the Virginia naval service. Among the captains were Richard Barron,\r\nEleazer Callender, John Calvert, John Cowper, Thomas Lilly, John\r\nPasture, John Harris, James Markham, Richard Taylor, Edward Travis, Cely\r\nSaunders, Isaac Younghusband, and John Catesby Cocke. Of the lieutenants\r\nmay be named Dale, Cunningham, Chamberlayne, Lewis, Pickett, Watkins,\r\nand Jennings. Among the surgeons are found the names of Kemp, Lyon,\r\nMcClurg, Brockenbrough, Christie, Riddle, Reynolds, Sharpless, Swope,\r\nand Pell. Among the seamen were many faithful blacks, who served through\r\nthe whole war. Most of the Virginia armed vessels were eventually\r\ncaptured at sea or destroyed in the rivers. The vessels commanded by the\r\nBarrons were the Liberty and the Patriot. The former was engaged in\r\ntwenty actions, and was probably the only one that escaped the enemy.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1776 an armed tender, commanded by the tory Goodrich, was\r\ncaptured off Bowler's wharf, in the Rappahannock. Shortly afterwards the\r\nBarrons captured, near the capes, the British transport-ship Oxford,\r\nfrom Glasgow, having on board two hundred and seventeen Scotch\r\nHighlanders, who were shaping their course to join Governor Dunmore,\r\nwhom they supposed to be in Virginia. This ship was destroyed by Arnold\r\nin 1781.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1776, Captain Richard Barron captured a sloop, from the\r\nWest Indies, laden with pine apples, limes, etc., and shortly after the\r\nFanny, an English vessel, laden with supplies for Boston. She had on\r\nboard numerous presents to the officers in that city. Captain Richard\r\nTaylor captured several merchantmen in the Rappahannock. One of them,\r\nthe Speedwell, was armed, and sent to the West Indies for powder and\r\nsupplies. In September several large vessels, laden with tobacco, were\r\ndespatched to the same islands for the like purpose.[680:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[670:A] The name of Bland ought to be given to a county.\r\n\r\n[673:A] I am indebted to Mr. Grigsby for this statement.

I also hope He is bringing about great\r\nthings for His church.\" He also adds: \"An American ought to seek an\r\nemancipation from the British King, ministry, and parliament, at the\r\nrisk of all his earthly possessions of whatever name; nor is it the fear\r\nof danger that has prevented my preaching this doctrine in the army at\r\nheadquarters.\" \"I meddle very little with matters of civil concern, only\r\nto countenance the recruiting business, as far as I have it in my power,\r\nand sometimes I have a fight with the prejudices--I would rather say the\r\nperverseness--of such as are inclining to toryism among us; but we have\r\nreason to rejoice that we have few such cattle with us.\" (_Hist.

In February, the Phoenix man-of-war came to Yorktown with a\r\nflag, and sent ashore a party of prisoners, among whom was Colonel\r\nLawson, who had been long in captivity, and who was exchanged for\r\nColonel Alexander Gordon, of Norfolk, a Scotch tory, who had been\r\narrested in 1775 and released on parole. Captain Lilly, in the brig\r\nLiberty, captured off the coast of Virginia the British ship Jane with a\r\nvaluable cargo. Captain Pasture, in the Molly, a small craft, returned\r\nfrom the southward with a supply of gunpowder. The schooner Henry was\r\ncaptured by the British man-of-war Seaford.\r\n\r\nWhen the assembly again met in May, 1777, George Wythe was made speaker\r\nof the house of delegates; the oath of allegiance was prescribed; a\r\nloan-office was established, and acts passed to support the credit of\r\nthe Continental and State paper currency. Benjamin Harrison, George\r\nMason, Joseph Jones, Francis Lightfoot Lee, and John Harrison were\r\nelected delegates to congress, Richard Henry Lee having been left out.\r\nThere were no little dissension and animosity in congress between the\r\ndelegates of the movement party and the moderates; and, added to this,\r\nit was believed that an old grudge, harbored in Virginia against Mr. Lee\r\nfor the prominent part he had taken many years before in disuniting the\r\noffices of speaker and treasurer, followed him to Philadelphia. The\r\ncharges alleged against him by his enemies in Virginia were, first, that\r\nhe had altered the mode in which his tenants should pay their rent from\r\nmoney to produce, with the design of depreciating the currency of the\r\ncountry; and secondly, that he had favored New England to the injury of\r\nVirginia; thirdly, that as a member of the secret committee in congress,\r\nhe had opposed laying their proceedings before congress--it being\r\nthereby intended to insinuate that in so doing he had wished to conceal\r\nthe embezzlement of the public money.\r\n\r\nA letter from Richard Henry Lee to Mr. Jefferson, dated at Philadelphia,\r\nNovember 3d, 1776, contains the following paragraph: \"I have been\r\ninformed that very malignant and very scandalous hints and inuendoes\r\nconcerning me have been uttered in the house. From the justice of the\r\nhouse I should expect they would not suffer the character of an absent\r\nperson to be reviled by any slanderous tongue whatever. When I am\r\npresent I shall be perfectly satisfied with the justice I am able to do\r\nmyself. From your candor, sir, and knowledge of my political movements,\r\nI hope such misstatings as may happen in your presence will be\r\nrectified.\" Early in June, 1777, as well on account of his health as for\r\nthe purpose of rebutting the charges circulated against him, Mr. Lee\r\nreturned home; and having been elected to the assembly from\r\nWestmoreland, he repaired to Richmond and demanded an enquiry into his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nMann Page, Jr., and Francis Lightfoot Lee, owing to the proceedings of\r\nthe house of delegates against Richard Henry Lee, condemning him in his\r\nabsence without opportunity of defence, addressed a letter from\r\nPhiladelphia, dated June tenth, to the speaker, tendering the\r\nresignations of their seats in congress.\r\n\r\nThe demand made by Richard Henry Lee for an enquiry into his conduct was\r\nacceded to, and the senate on the occasion united with the house of\r\ndelegates. Several persons were examined, and Mr. Lee was heard in his\r\nown defence. It appeared that he had first proposed to make the\r\nalteration in the payment of his rents from money to tobacco at a fixed\r\nvaluation, as early as August, 1775, when the tenants on account of the\r\nassociation could not sell their produce, and when but little paper\r\ncurrency had as yet been issued for the war of Revolution, and,\r\nconsequently the alteration could not have been proposed for the purpose\r\nof depreciating a currency which did not then, to any sensible extent,\r\nexist. When in March, 1776, the alteration in the rents was actually\r\nmade, very little paper money had yet been issued. And it appeared that\r\nin August of that year the tenants of Loudoun County themselves\r\npetitioned the convention to have their money-rents changed to produce.\r\nThe truth was, as Mr. Lee declared, certain evil-disposed men hated him\r\nfor the same reasons on account of which he was devoted to destruction\r\nin the British camp, which were, because he had faithfully served his\r\ncountry, and, in concert with other generous friends to human liberty\r\nand the rights of America, had contributed to the defeat of the enemy\r\nand to the raising of America triumphant over its cruel and vindictive\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nAs to the second charge, that Mr. Lee opposed the laying the proceedings\r\nof the secret committee of congress before that body, for the purpose of\r\nconcealing embezzlement of the public money, it was well known that he\r\nhad no sort of connection whatever with any commercial business, and,\r\ntherefore, could not propose to himself any advantage from any such\r\nsource. But it was very probable that those who themselves entertained\r\ndesigns of peculating upon the public funds, would be glad to get Mr.\r\nLee out of their way. To lay the proceedings of a secret committee\r\nbefore congress would be to defeat its very object and contradict its\r\nname. The third charge was that he favored New England at the expense of\r\nVirginia and the South. It was known that America could be conquered\r\nonly by disunion. Mr. Lee called on his accusers to show that he ever\r\nhad in a single instance preferred the interest of New England to that\r\nof Virginia. Indeed, he knew not in what respects their interests\r\nconflicted. New England and Virginia had both exhibited a fixed\r\ndetermination against British tyranny, and their guilt was alike in the\r\neyes of the common enemy. The majority of the other colonies had\r\nentitled themselves to some hopes of pardon from the tyrant by\r\nvacillating conduct. Among the Middle and Southern States there was, in\r\nMr. Lee's opinion, much enmity to Virginia, owing to jealousy of her\r\nwisdom, vigor, and extent of territory; but he had ever discovered,\r\n\"upon every question, respect and love for Virginia among the Eastern\r\ndelegates.\" It was his consolation, that \"the malignants, who would\r\nrepresent him as an enemy to his country, could not make him so.\" He\r\ngave his enemies credit for more address than he had supposed they\r\npossessed, in making use of a good principle--rotation in office--for\r\nhis ruin; and he believed that the act, limiting the term of service to\r\nthree years, was framed expressly to fit his case; and thus a malicious\r\nslander, uttered in his absence, appeared likely to be successful.[684:A]\r\nMr. Lee had been superseded early in the session while absent--a\r\nflagrant injustice against which no reputation could be safe. John\r\nBanister, although not very fond of Mr. Lee, said of his speech on this\r\noccasion: \"Certainly no defence was ever made with more graceful\r\neloquence, more manly firmness, equalness of temper, serenity, calmness,\r\nand judgment, than this very accomplished speaker displayed on this\r\noccasion; and I am now of opinion he will be re-elected to his former\r\nstation instead of Mr. George Mason, who has resigned.\"[684:B] Mr. Lee\r\nis said to have shed tears while speaking on this occasion. The enquiry\r\nbeing ended, the senate withdrew, and in compliance with a resolution of\r\nthe house, the speaker returned Mr. Lee their thanks for the faithful\r\nservices which he had rendered his country while in congress. The\r\nspeaker added his own testimony, and said: \"Serving with you in\r\ncongress, and attentively observing your conduct there, I thought that\r\nyou manifested in the American cause a zeal truly patriotic; and as far\r\nas I could judge, exerted the abilities for which you are confessedly\r\ndistinguished, to prosecute the good and prosperity of your own country\r\nin particular, and of the United States in general.\" Thus Mr. Lee's\r\nvindication of himself was triumphant.\r\n\r\n     \"Virtue may be assailed, but never hurt;\r\n      Surprised by unjust force, but not inthralled;\r\n      Yea, even that which mischief meant most harm,\r\n      Shall in the happy trial prove most glory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[684:A] Letter of Richard Henry Lee to Patrick Henry--among the Lee MSS.\r\nI am indebted to N.

The Virginia brigades,\r\nunder Wayne and Weedon, particularly distinguished themselves. General\r\nGeorge Weedon, before the Revolution, had been an inn-keeper at\r\nFredericksburg. The third Virginia regiment, under command of Colonel\r\nThomas Marshall, (father of the chief justice,) which had performed\r\nsevere duty in 1776, was placed in a wood on the right, and in front of\r\nWoodford's brigade and Stephen's division. Though attacked by superior\r\nnumbers, the regiment maintained its position until both its flanks were\r\nturned, its ammunition nearly expended, and more than half of the\r\nofficers and one-third of the soldiers were killed or wounded. Colonel\r\nMarshall, whose horse had received two balls, then retired to resume his\r\nposition on the right of his division, but it had already retreated.\r\nAmong the wounded in this battle were La Fayette and Woodford. The enemy\r\npassed the night on the field of battle. On the twenty-sixth the British\r\nentered Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of October occurred the battle of Germantown, in which the\r\nAmerican forces, by a well-concerted plan, attacked the enemy at several\r\npoints early in the morning. The British were at first driven back,\r\nprecipitately, toward Philadelphia, but at length made a successful\r\nstand at Chew's house, garrisoned by five companies of the fortieth\r\nregiment, under the command of Colonel Musgrave. Lieutenant Matthew\r\nSmith, of Virginia, having volunteered to carry a flag of truce to\r\nChew's house, was mortally wounded, and died in a few days. The\r\nAmericans being thrown into confusion in a dense fog, Washington, when\r\nvictory had seemed to be almost within his grasp, was eventually\r\ncompelled to retreat. A British officer afterwards declared in\r\nparliament that Sir William Howe had received information beforehand of\r\nthe intended attack. The ninth Virginia regiment and part of the sixth\r\nwere made prisoners. Colonel Matthews, after penetrating to the centre\r\nof the town with his regiment, was made prisoner. Major-General Stephen,\r\nwho commanded the right division of the left wing, was cashiered for\r\nmisconduct on the retreat, and intoxication. The loss of the enemy was\r\nheavy; and congress expressed its approbation of the plan of the battle\r\nand the courage displayed in its execution, and the thanks of that body\r\nwere given to the general and the army.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, at the north, Burgoyne, with a well-appointed army,\r\nhad advanced from Canada, in order to open a communication between that\r\ncountry and New York, and to cut off New England from the rest of the\r\nStates. Washington, in a letter to General Schuyler, gave it as his\r\nopinion that Burgoyne would, eventually, receive an effectual check;\r\nthat his confidence of success would precipitate his ruin; that his\r\nacting in detachment would expose his parties to great hazard, and\r\nprophetically adds: \"Could we be so happy as to cut one of them off,\r\nthough it should not exceed four, five, or six hundred men, it would\r\ninspirit the people.\"\r\n\r\nAfter capturing Ticonderoga, Burgoyne moved toward the Hudson,\r\nencountering continual obstructions in his route through a wilderness,\r\nand harassed by the American troops. A strong detachment was overwhelmed\r\nby Starke and his countrymen near Bennington, in Vermont. After a series\r\nof engagements, in which he suffered a terrible loss, Burgoyne was at\r\nlength, on the 17th day of October, 1777, thirteen days after the battle\r\nof Germantown, forced to surrender at Saratoga to Gates, who had shortly\r\nbefore succeeded Schuyler. Among those who distinguished themselves at\r\nSaratoga was Daniel Morgan, with his Virginia riflemen. He was a native\r\nof New Jersey, son of a Welshman, and removed in his youth to Virginia,\r\nabout 1755, and made his living for a time by driving a wagon. In\r\nBraddock's expedition, when about twenty-two years of age, he served as\r\na private, and was wounded. There is a tradition of his having been\r\nseverely whipped on a charge of contumacy to a British officer.[687:A]\r\nFor some years after he was twenty years of age he was addicted to\r\nfighting and gambling; and the reputed scene of his combats, in Clarke\r\nCounty, retains its name of Battletown. When the revolutionary war began\r\nhe was appointed a captain, and in command of a troop of Virginia horse\r\nhe marched thence in the summer, with extraordinary expedition, to the\r\nAmerican army at Cambridge, Massachusetts. Washington, who knew him\r\nwell, and had strong confidence in his bravery and patriotism, detached\r\nhim to join the expedition against Canada; and he exhibited his\r\naccustomed courage at Quebec; and when Arnold was wounded the command\r\ndevolved on him. When Montgomery fell, Morgan was taken prisoner. While\r\nin the hands of the British he was offered the rank and pay of a\r\ncolonel, but he indignantly rejected them. Exchanged in the following\r\nyear, he rejoined the army; and in command of a rifle corps rendered\r\nsignal service at Saratoga.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth day of October Gates' victory was celebrated at\r\nWilliamsburg by a _feu de joie_, joyful shouts, ringing of bells, and\r\nilluminations; and all prisoners, except deserters, were discharged from\r\nconfinement; and a gill of rum was issued to every soldier. The troops\r\nwere reviewed by General Nelson, by the speakers of both houses of\r\nassembly, and by many of the members. Governor Henry, by proclamation,\r\nappointed a day of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nIn December the American army encamped at Valley Forge, on the\r\nSchuylkill, near Philadelphia. The winter was one of extraordinary\r\nrigor; the soldiers destitute of clothing, and the hospitals filled with\r\nthe sick. To aggravate Washington's troubles a cabal formed a design at\r\nthis time of supplanting him, and making Gates commander-in-chief. But\r\nWashington stood unshaken: the angry billows dash in vain against the\r\nocean rock, and fall in empty murmurs at its base.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1778, the American frigate Randolph, (so called in honor of\r\nPeyton Randolph, president of congress,) carrying thirty-six guns and\r\nthree hundred and five men, sailed on a cruise from Charleston. The\r\nYarmouth, British man-of-war, of sixty-four guns, discovered her and\r\nfive other vessels, and came up with her in the evening. Captain Vincent\r\nhailed the Randolph to hoist colors, or he would fire into her; on which\r\nshe hoisted the American flag, and immediately gave the Yarmouth her\r\nbroadside, which was returned, and in about a quarter of an hour the\r\nRandolph blew up. Four men escaped upon a fragment of the wreck, and\r\nsubsisted for five days on rain water alone, which they sucked from a\r\npiece of blanket which they had picked up. They were rescued by the\r\nYarmouth.[688:A]\r\n\r\nEarly in this month congress received despatches containing a treaty\r\nbetween the king of France and the United States of America. In\r\nconsequence of Burgoyne's surrender and of the treaty with France, the\r\nBritish army (under command of Sir Henry Clinton, who had relieved Sir\r\nWilliam Howe,) evacuated Philadelphia in June, 1778. Crossing the\r\nDelaware, they marched for New York. Washington pursued them across the\r\nJerseys, and on the twenty-eighth of June occurred the battle of\r\nMonmouth. The result was not decisive; many died from heat and fatigue;\r\nthe Americans remained on the field of battle, where Washington passed\r\nthe night in his cloak in the midst of his soldiers. It was during this\r\naction that General Charles Lee retreated before the British, who had\r\nturned upon him. He was met by Washington, who reprimanded him, ordered\r\nthe division to be formed, and, with the aid of artillery under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Carrington, checked the enemy's advance. General Lee\r\nwas arrested, tried, and convicted of disobedience of orders, of making\r\nan unnecessary and disorderly retreat, and of writing disrespectfully to\r\nthe commander-in-chief, and suspended from the army for one year. Recent\r\ndevelopments strengthen the suspicion long entertained that he acted\r\ntraitorously. It is strange that, conscious of this, he should have\r\nremained among those whom he had endeavored to betray. He had previously\r\nbeen signally serviceable in the American cause; and at the time of his\r\nsuspension there were not wanting divers leading men who thought him\r\nhardly dealt with. But a man is never better than his principles, and\r\nGeneral Lee's were bad from the beginning. La Fayette said that\r\nWashington never appeared to better advantage than in this action, when\r\nroused by Lee's misconduct.\r\n\r\nColonel Richard Kidder Meade, the father of Bishop Meade, was one of\r\nWashington's aides-de-camp. The following anecdote relative to him is\r\ntaken from the Travels of Anburey, who was a lieutenant in the British\r\narmy, and in 1779 a prisoner of war in Virginia, and visiting the lower\r\ncountry on parole: \"On my way to this place I stopt and slept at\r\nTuckahoe, where I met with Colonel Meade, Colonel Laurens, and another\r\nofficer of General Washington's suite. More than once did I express a\r\nwish that the general himself had been of the party, to have seen and\r\nconversed with a character of whom, in all my travels through the\r\nvarious provinces, I never heard any one speak disrespectfully as an\r\nindividual, and whose public character has been the admiration and\r\nastonishment of all Europe.\" * * * * \"The colonel (Meade) attributed the\r\nsafety of his person to the swiftness of his horse at the battle of\r\nMonmouth, having been fired at and pursued by some British officers as\r\nhe was reconnoitering. Upon the colonel's mentioning this circumstance\r\nit occurred to me he must have been the person that Sir Henry Clinton's\r\naide-de-camp had fired at, and requesting to know the particular color\r\nof his horse, he informed me it was black, which convinced me it was\r\nhim; when I related the circumstance of his meeting Sir Henry Clinton,\r\nhe replied he recollected in the course of the day to have met several\r\nBritish officers, and one of them wore a star. Upon my mentioning the\r\nobservation Sir Henry Clinton had made to his aide-de-camp,[689:A] the\r\ncolonel laughed, and replied, had he known it was the commander-in-chief\r\nhe should have made a desperate effort to take him prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Richard Kidder is said to be derived from a bishop of Bath\r\nand Wells, who was from the same stock with the Meades of Virginia.\r\nAndrew Meade, first of the name in Virginia, born in County Kerry,\r\nIreland, educated a Romanist, came over to New York, and married Mary\r\nLatham, a Quakeress, of Flushing, on Long Island. He afterwards settled\r\nin Nansemond, Virginia, and for many years was burgess thereof; from\r\nwhich it appears that he must have renounced the Romish religion. He was\r\nprosperous, affluent, and hospitable. He is mentioned by Colonel Byrd in\r\nhis Journal of the Dividing Line run in 1728. His only son, David Meade,\r\nmarried, under romantic circumstances, Susannah, daughter of Sir Richard\r\nEverard, Baronet, Governor of North Carolina. Of the sons of David\r\nMeade, Richard Kidder Meade was aide-de-camp to General Washington;\r\nEverard Meade aide to General Lincoln. Richard Kidder, Everard, together\r\nwith an older brother, David, were educated at Harrow, England, under\r\nthe care of Dr. Thackeray. Sir William Jones, Sir Joseph Banks, and Dr.\r\nParr, were at the same time scholars there.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1778, Colonel Arthur Campbell wrote to the Rev. Charles\r\nCummings, of Washington County: \"Yesterday I returned home, the assembly\r\nhaving adjourned until the first Monday in October. The acts passed, and\r\na list of their titles, I here enclose, together with an address of\r\ncongress to the people of America, for you to publish, agreeable to the\r\nresolve. I wish you could make it convenient to preach at the lower\r\nmeeting-house in this county, if it was but a week-day, as the contents\r\nof the address are of the most interesting nature, both as to the moral\r\nand political conduct of the good people of America. Providence is daily\r\nworking out strange deliverances for us. The treaty with France is much\r\nmore advantageous than the wisest men in this country expected. The\r\nIndians the other day were unexpectedly discomfited on Greenbrier. I\r\nthink the overthrow was something similar to what happened in this\r\ncounty about two years ago. I must give you the intelligence at full\r\nlength, as the most hardened mind must see and admire the Divine\r\ngoodness in such an interposition.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Charles Cummings, by birth an Irishman, resided for some time\r\nin the congregation of the Rev. James Waddell, in Lancaster, and\r\nprobably studied theology under his care. Mr. Cummings married Miss\r\nMilly, daughter of John Carter, of Lancaster, and in 1773 settled near\r\nwhere Abingdon now stands. His meeting-house was of unhewn logs, from\r\neighty to a hundred feet long and forty wide. Mr. Cummings was of middle\r\nstature, well formed, of great firmness and dignity. His voice was of\r\ngreat compass, and his articulation distinct. At this time the\r\ninhabitants, during the summer months, were compelled to take shelter in\r\nforts for protection against the Indians. The men went to church armed,\r\ntaking their families with them. The armed congregation, seated in the\r\nlog meeting-house, presented a singular spectacle of frontier life. Mr.\r\nCummings, when he ascended the steps of the pulpit, deposited his rifle\r\nin a corner and laid aside his shot-pouch. He was a zealous whig, and\r\nwas chairman of the committee of safety of Washington County, formed as\r\nearly as January, 1775. He was a Presbyterian of the old stamp, a rigid\r\nCalvinist, and a man of exemplary piety.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Monmouth Sir Henry Clinton occupied New York. The\r\narrival of a French fleet under D'Estaing reanimated the hopes of the\r\nAmericans. Arthur Lee argued unfavorably of the removal of D'Orvilliers\r\nand D'Estaing's appointment. Washington took a position at White Plains,\r\non the Hudson. About this time Colonel Baylor's regiment of cavalry was\r\nsurprised in the night by a British corps under General Gray. Of one\r\nhundred and four privates forty were made prisoners, and twenty-seven\r\nkilled or wounded. Colonel Baylor was himself dangerously wounded and\r\ntaken prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1778 the town of Abington was incorporated. Virginia sent\r\nGeneral George Rogers Clarke on an expedition to the northwest. After\r\nenduring extreme sufferings in marching through a wilderness, he and his\r\nhardy followers captured Kaskaskias and its governor, Rocheblave. In\r\nDecember, 1778, Hamilton, British lieutenant-governor of Detroit, under\r\nSir Guy Carleton, governor-in-chief, took possession of the post (now\r\nthe town) of Vincennes, in Indiana. Here he fortified himself, intending\r\nin the ensuing spring to rally his Indian confederates to attack\r\nKaskaskias, then in possession of Clarke, and to proceed up the Ohio to\r\nFort Pitt, sweeping Kentucky in the way, and finally overrunning all\r\nWest Augusta. This expedition was ordered by Carleton. Clarke's\r\nposition was too remote for succor, and his force too small to withstand\r\na siege; nevertheless, he prepared to make the best defence possible. At\r\nthis juncture a Spanish merchant brought intelligence that Hamilton had,\r\nby detaching his Indian allies, reduced the strength of his garrison to\r\neighty men, with a few cannon. Clarke immediately despatched a small\r\narmed galley, with orders to force her way and station herself a few\r\nmiles below the enemy. In the mean time, early in February, 1779, he\r\nmarched, with one hundred and thirty men, upon St. Vincennes: many of\r\nthe inhabitants of the country joined the expedition; the rest\r\ngarrisoned the towns. Impeded by rain and high waters, his little army\r\nwere occupied for sixteen days in reaching the fertile borders of the\r\nWabash, and when within nine miles of the enemy it required five days to\r\ncross \"the drowned lands\" near that river, \"having to wade often upwards\r\nof two leagues, up to our breasts in water.\" But for the unusual\r\nmildness of the season they must have perished. On the evening of\r\nFebruary the twenty-third they reached dry land, and came unperceived\r\nwithin sight of the enemy; and an attack being made at seven o'clock,\r\nthe inhabitants of St. Vincennes gladly surrendered it, and assisted in\r\nbesieging Hamilton, who held out in the fort. On the next day he\r\nsurrendered the garrison. Clarke despatching some armed boats up the\r\nWabash, captured a convoy, including forty prisoners and £10,000 worth\r\nof goods and stores. Hamilton, and some officers and privates, were sent\r\nto the governor at Williamsburg. Colonel Shelby about the same time\r\nattacking the Cherokees, who had taken up the tomahawk, burnt eleven\r\ntowns and a large quantity of corn, and captured £25,000 worth of goods.\r\n\r\nThe assembly of Virginia afterwards presented to General Clarke an\r\nhonorary sword, on the scabbard of which was inscribed: \"Sic semper\r\ntyrannis;\" and on the blade: \"A tribute to courage and patriotism,\r\npresented by the State of Virginia to her beloved son, General George\r\nRogers Clarke, who, by the conquest of Illinois and Vincennes, extended\r\nher empire and aided in defence of her liberties.\" In his latter years\r\nhe was intemperate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[687:A] The Rev. Dr. Hill told Mr. Grigsby that he had seen the marks of\r\nthe flogging on Morgan's back.\r\n\r\n[688:A] Cooper's History of North America, 106.\r\n\r\n[689:A] To wit, that he ought by no means to have fired at the American,\r\nas he probably might have wished to speak to him and give him\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIV.\r\n\r\n1779.\r\n\r\n     Condition of Affairs--Mason's Letter--Convention Troops\r\n     removed to Charlottesville--Miscellaneous--Church Establishment\r\n     abolished--Clergy and Churches--Suffolk burnt--D'Estaing's\r\n     Siege of Savannah--Lincoln surrenders--Gates defeated at\r\n     Camden--Sumpter defeated--Battle of King's Mountain--Colonel\r\n     Campbell--Colonel Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON looked upon the early part of 1779 as more fraught with\r\ndanger than any preceding period of the war, not on account of the\r\nstrength of the enemy, but owing to the spirit of selfish speculation,\r\nmoney-making, and stock-jobbing that prevailed, the depreciation of the\r\npaper currency, the States employing their ablest men at home, the\r\nidleness and dissipation of men in public trust, and the dissensions in\r\ncongress. The demoralizing influences of war were making themselves\r\nmanifest.[693:A]\r\n\r\nColonel George Mercer, of Stafford, who had been compelled to resign the\r\noffice of stamp collector before the commencement of the revolutionary\r\nstruggle, retired to England. George Mason, who was related to him, in\r\nOctober, 1778, addressed him a letter, in which he said: \"If I can only\r\nlive to see the American Union firmly fixed, and free governments well\r\nestablished in our western world, and can leave to my children but a\r\ncrust of bread and liberty,[693:B] I shall die satisfied, and say with\r\nthe Psalmist: 'Lord! now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.' God\r\nhas been pleased to bless our endeavors in a just cause with remarkable\r\nsuccess. To us upon the spot, who have seen step by step the progress of\r\nthis great contest, who know the defenceless state of America, and the\r\nnumberless difficulties we have had to struggle with; taking a\r\nretrospective view of what is passed, we seem to have been treading upon\r\nenchanted ground.\"\r\n\r\nWashington, in compliance with the resolutions of congress, had ordered\r\nthe removal of the convention troops of Saratoga, then quartered in\r\nMassachusetts, to Charlottesville, Virginia. Congress, whether from\r\ndistrust in the British prisoners, or from reasons of state, resolved\r\nnot to comply with the articles of the convention, allowing the\r\nprisoners to embark for England on parole, until the convention should\r\nbe ratified by the English government. Burgoyne had sailed for England\r\nin May, and from that time the command of the British troops of\r\nconvention, quartered at Cambridge, had devolved upon General Phillips.\r\nColonel Bland, with an escort, conducted the prisoners of war to\r\nVirginia. Upon their arrival, in December, at their place of\r\ndestination, on Colonel Harvey's estate, about six miles from\r\nCharlottesville, they suffered many privations, being billeted in\r\nblock-houses without windows or doors, and poorly defended from the cold\r\nof an uncommonly rigorous winter. But in a short time they constructed\r\nbetter habitations, and the barracks assumed the appearance of a neat\r\nlittle town. In the rear of each house they had trim gardens and\r\nenclosed places for poultry. The army cleared a space of six miles in\r\ncircumference around the barracks. A representation of the barracks is\r\ngiven in Anburey's Travels. The officers were allowed, upon giving\r\nparole, to provide for themselves lodging-places within a circuit of a\r\nhundred miles.[694:A] Mr. Jefferson exhibited a generous hospitality\r\ntoward the captives; and his knowledge of French, his taste for music,\r\nhis fine conversational powers, and his fascinating manners, contributed\r\nnot a little to relieve the tedium of their captivity. Governor Henry\r\nafforded them every indulgence in his power; and the amiable disposition\r\nof Colonel Bland, who commanded the guard placed over the convention\r\ntroops, still further ensured their quiet and comfort. General Phillips,\r\ndescribed by Mr. Jefferson as \"the proudest man of the proudest nation\r\non earth,\" occupied Blenheim, a seat of Colonel Carter's; General the\r\nBaron de Riedesel occupied Colle, a residence belonging to Philip\r\nMazzei, Mr. Jefferson's Italian neighbor; and the Baroness, whose\r\nromantic sufferings and adventures are so well known, has given, in her\r\nMemoirs, an entertaining account of her sojourn among the picturesque\r\nmountains of Albemarle. Charlottesville at this period consisted of a\r\ncourt-house, a tavern, and about a dozen dwelling-houses.[695:A]\r\n\r\nAnburey has given a graphic picture of the manners, customs, and the\r\ngrotesque scenes that he witnessed at Charlottesville and in its\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nViolent dissensions convulsed congress; some of the members were\r\nsuspected of treasonable designs. Early in May, Richard Henry Lee wrote\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Mr. Jefferson, hoping that he \"would not be blamed\r\nby him and his other friends for sending his resignation to the\r\nassembly, and averring that he had been persecuted by the united voice\r\nof toryism, speculation, faction, envy, malice, and all\r\nuncharitableness,\" so that nothing but the certain prospect of doing\r\nessential service to his country could compensate for the injuries he\r\nreceived. But he adds: \"It would content me indeed to sacrifice every\r\nconsideration to the public good that would result from such persons as\r\nyourself, Mr. Wythe, Mr. Mason, and some others being in congress. I\r\nwould struggle with persevering ardor through every difficulty in\r\nconjunction with such associates.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1779 the legislature rejected a scheme of a general assessment for\r\nthe support of religion. Patrick Henry was in favor of it. The\r\nglebe-lands were also declared to be public property; and thus was\r\ndestroyed the last vestige of a religious establishment in Virginia.\r\nDuring the Revolution, the loyalist clergy of Virginia who remained,\r\nfound themselves in a deplorable condition. The prohibition to pray for\r\nthe king was strictly enforced upon them by the incensed people: some\r\nministers omitted the obnoxious petitions; others abandoned the churches\r\nand offered no prayer in public; while a few appeared disposed, if\r\npossible, to resist the popular tide, but were compelled eventually to\r\nsuccumb to it. In 1775 Virginia contained sixty-one counties,\r\nninety-five parishes, one hundred and sixty-four churches and chapels,\r\nand ninety-one clergymen of the establishment. During the interval of\r\nthe war part of the parishes were extinguished, and the greater number\r\nof the rest were deprived of ministerial help; but few ministers were\r\nable to weather the storm and remain at their former posts; the others\r\nhaving been compelled to seek precarious shelter and support in other\r\nparishes. Some of the churches, venerable for age and connected with so\r\nmany interesting associations, were left roofless and dismantled; others\r\nused as barracks, or stables, or lodging-places of prisoners of war; and\r\nthe moss-grown walls of some were pulled down by sacrilegious hands, and\r\nbooks and vessels appurtenant to holy services pillaged and carried off.\r\n\r\nUntil this year the British arms had been chiefly directed against the\r\nMiddle and Northern States; but they were now turned against the South.\r\nGeorgia soon fell a prey to the enemy, and South Carolina was invaded.\r\nIn May a squadron under Sir George Collier anchored in Hampton Roads,\r\nand General Matthews took possession of Portsmouth. The enemy destroyed\r\nthe public stores at Gosport and Norfolk, burnt Suffolk, and destroyed\r\nupwards of a hundred vessels, including several armed ones. The Virginia\r\nnavy had been reduced previously, and many of the vessels ordered to be\r\nsold, and from this time the history of those remaining is a series of\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\nUpon the approach of six hundred British infantry upon Suffolk, the\r\nmilitia and greater part of the inhabitants fled; few could save their\r\neffects; some who remained for that purpose were made prisoners. The\r\nenemy fired the town, and nearly the whole of it was consumed: hundreds\r\nof barrels of tar, pitch, turpentine, and rum, lay on the wharves, and\r\ntheir heads being staved, the contents flowing in commingled mass and\r\ncatching the blaze, descended to the river in torrents of liquid flame,\r\nand the wind blowing violently, the splendid mass floated to the\r\nopposite shore in a conflagration that rose and fell with the waves, and\r\nthere set on fire the dry grass of an extensive marsh. This broad sheet\r\nof fire, the crackling flames of the town, the lurid smoke, and the\r\noccasional explosion of gunpowder in the magazines, projecting ignited\r\nfragments of timber like meteors in the troubled air, presented\r\naltogether an awful spectacle of the horrors of civil war. The enemy\r\nshortly after, laden with plunder, embarked for New York.\r\n\r\nWhile Sir Henry Clinton was encamped near Haerlem, and Washington in the\r\nHighlands on the Hudson,[697:A] Major Lee, of Virginia, surprised in the\r\nnight a British post at Paulus Hook, and with a loss of two killed and\r\nthree wounded, made one hundred and fifty-nine prisoners, including\r\nthree officers. Soon after this a fleet, commanded by Admiral Arbuthnot,\r\narrived at New York with re-enforcements. D'Estaing returned to the\r\nsouthern coast of America with a fleet of twenty-two ships-of-the-line\r\nand eleven frigates, and having on board six thousand soldiers. He\r\narrived so unexpectedly that the British ship Experiment of fifty guns,\r\nand three frigates, fell into his hands. In September, Savannah,\r\noccupied by a British force under General Prevost, was besieged by the\r\nFrench and Americans, commanded by D'Estaing and Lincoln.[697:B] In an\r\nineffectual effort to storm the post the French and Americans suffered\r\nheavy loss. The siege was raised, and D'Estaing, who had been wounded in\r\nthe action, sailed again for the West Indies, after this second abortive\r\nattempt to aid the cause of independence. The condition of the South was\r\nnow more gloomy than ever.\r\n\r\nClinton, toward the close of the year, embarked with a formidable force\r\nin Arbuthnot's fleet, and sailed for South Carolina. In April, 1780, Sir\r\nHenry laid siege to Charleston; and General Lincoln, undertaking to\r\ndefend the place, contrary to his own judgment, and in compliance with\r\nthe entreaties of the inhabitants, after an obstinate defence was\r\ncompelled to capitulate.[698:A] Shortly after this disaster Colonel\r\nBuford's regiment was cut to pieces by Tarleton. Georgia and South\r\nCarolina now succumbed to the enemy: it was the bending of the willow\r\nbefore the sweep of the tempest. In June, General Gates was appointed by\r\ncongress to the command in the South. Having collected an army he\r\nmarched toward Camden in South Carolina, then held by the enemy. While\r\nGates was moving from Clermont toward that place in the night,[698:B]\r\nCornwallis marched out with a view of attacking the American army at\r\nClermont. Thus the two armies, each essaying to surprise the other, met\r\nunexpectedly in the woods, at about two o'clock in the morning. At the\r\nfirst onset the American line was thrown into disorder; but a body of\r\nlight infantry, and in particular a corps under command of Colonel\r\nPorterfield, of Virginia, maintained their ground with constancy. This\r\nbrave officer, refusing to give way, fell mortally wounded. The battle\r\nwas resumed in the morning, and Gates' army was utterly discomfited: the\r\nmilitia fled too soon; the regulars fought too long. The fugitives\r\nretreating in promiscuous disorder, were pursued by the unrelenting\r\nsabres of cavalry; and the horrors of the rout baffle description. Thus\r\nGates, verifying General Lee's prediction, \"turned his Northern laurels\r\ninto Southern willows.\" The defeated general retired to North Carolina\r\nto collect the scattered remains of his army. In August, Sumpter was\r\noverwhelmed by Tarleton; and for a time the British army were in the\r\nascendant throughout the South.\r\n\r\nCornwallis[698:C] detached Colonel Ferguson, a gallant and expert\r\nofficer, across the Wateree, with one hundred and ten regulars; and in a\r\nshort time tory recruits augmented his numbers to one thousand; and,\r\nconfident of his strength, he sent a menacing message to the patriot\r\nleaders on the western waters. This was, for the South, \"the time that\r\ntried men's souls:\" many of the leading patriots captives or exiles, the\r\ncountry subjugated, British and tory cruelty desolating it, hope almost\r\nextinct,--Marion alone holding out in his fastnesses. The spirit of the\r\nhardy mountaineers was aroused, and hearing that Ferguson was\r\nthreatening to cross the mountains, a body of men in arms were\r\nconcentrated by the twenty-fifth on the banks of the Watauga--four\r\nhundred from Washington County, Virginia, under Colonel William\r\nCampbell; the rest from North Carolina, under Colonels Shelby, Sevier,\r\nMcDowell, Cleveland, and Winston. Crossing the mountains they advanced\r\ntoward Ferguson, who began to retreat, and took up a position[699:A] on\r\nan eminence of about one hundred and fifty feet, called King's Mountain.\r\nIt is situated in the northern part of South Carolina, near the North\r\nCarolina line, its sides steep and rocky, a brook flowing at its\r\nfoot,--the surrounding scenery thickly wooded, wild, and picturesque. It\r\nwas resolved to pursue the enemy with nine hundred picked men. Near the\r\nCowpens, where Ferguson had encamped on the fourth, and about thirty\r\nmiles from King's Mountain, the mountaineers were re-enforced by four\r\nhundred and sixty men, the greater part of them from South Carolina,\r\nunder Colonel Williams. Here, at about nine o'clock of the evening,\r\nColonel William Campbell was appointed to the chief command. The\r\nmountain horsemen rode on in the night through a rain, with their guns\r\nunder their arms to keep the locks dry; the leader in front, and each\r\ncolonel at the head of his troops. In the morning they halted for half\r\nan hour to eat a frugal breakfast, and at twelve o'clock, when the sky\r\ncleared, they found themselves within three miles of the British camp.\r\nThey halted, and the order passed along the line: \"Tie up overcoats,\r\npick touch-holes, fresh prime, and be ready to fight.\" At three o'clock\r\nin the afternoon of the seventh of October an express from Ferguson to\r\nCornwallis was captured, and his despatches, declaring his position on\r\nKing's Mountain impregnable, were read to the troops. Galloping off they\r\ncame in twenty minutes within sight of the British camp. They dismounted\r\non the banks of the little stream, tied their horses to the limbs of\r\ntrees, and left them in charge of a small guard. The force being\r\ndivided, the mountain was surrounded. As each column moved on to the\r\nattack it was driven back a short distance by the charge of the British,\r\nwho were soon compelled to wheel, in order to face another column\r\nadvancing on the opposite side. Ferguson, finding his troops hemmed in\r\nand huddled together on the summit of the mountain, fought with\r\ndesperate valor, and fell, charging at the head of his men and cheering\r\nthem on. The white flag was now raised. Of Ferguson's force, amounting\r\nto rather more than eleven hundred men, two hundred and forty were\r\nkilled and two hundred wounded; upwards of seven hundred were taken\r\nprisoners, with all the arms, ammunition, and camp equipage. The loss of\r\nthe patriots was thirty killed and fifty wounded. The gallant Williams\r\nwas slain, as also was Major Chronicle, and several other officers. The\r\nbattle lasted one hour. A number of the tories were hung on the next\r\nday. The sword used by Colonel Campbell on this occasion is preserved in\r\npossession of William Campbell Preston, of South Carolina, the orator,\r\nhis grandson; it is more than two centuries old, and was wielded by the\r\nancestors of Colonel Campbell in Scotland in the wars of the Pretenders.\r\nOne of the rifles employed at King's Mountain is also preserved. This\r\nbattle was the turning-point of the war in the South.\r\n\r\nColonel William Campbell was a native of Augusta County, and removed\r\nearly to the County of Washington. Fame has awarded him the title of\r\n\"the hero of King's Mountain.\" Colonel Ferguson was an excellent\r\nmarksman, and brought the art of rifle shooting to high perfection. He\r\ninvented a gun of that kind which was said to surpass anything of the\r\nsort before known, and he was said to have outdone even the Indians in\r\nfiring and loading and hitting the mark, standing or lying, and in no\r\nmatter what position of the body. It was reported that General\r\nWashington owed his life, at the battle of Brandywine, to Ferguson's\r\nignorance of his person, as he was within his reach.[700:A] He\r\nafterwards, upon discovering the fact, remarked that he was not sorry\r\nthat he did not know him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[693:A] From verses supposed to have been written about this time by St.\r\nGeorge Tucker:--\r\n\r\n     \"Virtue and Washington in vain\r\n      To glory call this prostrate train.\"\r\n\r\n     * * \"Each eager votary hugs his reams,\r\n      And hoards his millions in his dreams.\r\n      Ruin with giant strides approaches,\r\n      And quartermasters loll in coaches.\"\r\n\r\n[693:B] The expression is from Smollet's Ode to Independence.\r\n\r\n[694:A] Anburey mentions a Dr. Fauchee as resident at\r\nCharlottesville--probably Foushee.\r\n\r\n[695:A] Colonel Bland, in some verses written during this year, alludes\r\nthus to Mr. Jefferson:--\r\n\r\n     On yonder height I see a lofty dome;[695:B]\r\n     But, hapless fate, the master's not at home.\r\n     His high aspiring soul aloft had towered,\r\n     That like a God he was by men adored.\r\n     But envy now has placed him in Jove's car\r\n     To rule the tempest of the mighty war,\r\n     That he, like Phaëton, may tumble down,\r\n     And by his fall astonish all the town.\r\n\r\n[695:B] Monticello.\r\n\r\n[697:A] August eighteenth.\r\n\r\n[697:B] October ninth.\r\n\r\n[698:A] May twelfth.\r\n\r\n[698:B] August sixteenth.\r\n\r\n[698:C] September first.\r\n\r\n[699:A] October sixth.\r\n\r\n[700:A] Dodsley's Annual Register for 1781.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCV.\r\n\r\n1780.\r\n\r\n     Arthur Lee--Deane--Franklin--Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year 1780 Arthur Lee returned to America after a long absence. He\r\nwas born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on the 20th of December,\r\n1740, being the youngest of five brothers, all of whom became eminent.\r\nAfter passing some time at Eton he entered the University of Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he took the degree of doctor of medicine about 1765. The other\r\nstudents from Virginia there at the same time were Field, Blair,\r\nBankhead, and Gilmer--the earliest pioneers in this profession in the\r\ncolony, at a time when the apothecary, physician, and surgeon were\r\nunited in the same person, and when quackery enjoyed full license.\r\nArthur Lee's extreme aversion to slavery and to negroes, and the\r\nlamentable state of dependence to which he foresaw that his own country\r\nwould be doomed for many years, made him dread to return; and he even\r\nthought of settling in England, which he looked upon as \"the Eden of the\r\nworld, the land of liberty and independence.\" Yet he was conscious of\r\nsuch a want of confidence in himself as unfitted him for taking up his\r\nabode and embarking in a profession in a land of strangers.[701:A]\r\nGladly quitting Scotland, which he disliked extremely, Dr. Lee travelled\r\nthrough Europe, and then returned to Virginia, and commenced the\r\npractice of physic at Williamsburg. Here he could not fail to view with\r\ninterest the stirring events of the day; and although successful in his\r\nmedical practice, the bent of his genius induced him to return to London\r\nfor the purpose of studying the law in the Temple, and fitting himself\r\nfor taking a part in public affairs. At this time he became the intimate\r\nfriend of Sir William Jones. In London he associated himself with\r\nWilkes, and other opponents of the government, and prevailed on them to\r\nfavor the cause of the colonies. In 1768 Dr. Lee was appointed political\r\nagent of Massachusetts. In 1769 he wrote the Monitor's Letters, and for\r\nsome years was a frequent writer in the _Public Advertiser_, over the\r\nsignature of Junius Americanus; and he held an amicable discussion with\r\nJunius on American matters.[702:A] That writer remarked of him: \"My\r\nAmerican namesake is plainly a man of abilities.\" His writings procured\r\nfor him the friendship of Burke, Dr. Price, and other leading men. He\r\nbecame acquainted with the celebrated Dr. Samuel Johnson. In 1770 Arthur\r\nLee was admitted to the bar, and he enjoyed a lucrative practice for\r\nsome years. In the spring of 1774 he set out on a tour through France\r\nand Italy; and while at Paris published an \"Appeal to the People of\r\nGreat Britain.\" During the same year he succeeded Dr. Franklin as agent\r\nof Massachusetts; and in the following he was agent for Virginia. The\r\nsecret committee of congress appointed him their London correspondent;\r\nand through the French ambassador there he obtained early assurances of\r\naid from France to the colonies. In August he presented the second\r\npetition of congress to the king. He was afterwards made commissioner to\r\nFrance in conjunction with Deane and Franklin; and he joined them at\r\nParis in December, 1776, and assisted in making the treaty of alliance.\r\nDiscord ensuing between Dr. Lee and the other commissioners, involved\r\nthem, especially Lee and Deane, in a controversy, which engendered an\r\ninveterate hostility, and gave rise to factions in congress, in which\r\nthe French minister, Gerard, became implicated, and which endangered the\r\ncause of independence. Deane, who, in the guise of a merchant, conducted\r\nthe public business, was subtle and unscrupulous. Mr. Lee had exposed\r\nthe peculations of some of the agents employed in conducting the\r\ncommercial details of the public business; and this interference gave\r\nrise to many aspersions upon him, which were encouraged by the\r\ncountenance which congress appeared to lend Deane and those associated\r\nwith him. Deane, at length, recalled by congress in November, 1777,\r\nreached America in the following summer, and gave an account of his\r\ntransactions to congress, making an artful defence against Arthur Lee's\r\naccusations. Deane published virulent attacks upon him and Richard Henry\r\nLee, and they retorted with indignant severity.\r\n\r\nCongress coming to no determination in the matter, Deane appealed to the\r\npublic, in December, in an address to the \"Free and Virtuous Citizens of\r\nAmerica.\" In 1780 he repaired to Paris to adjust his accounts, but never\r\ndid so; and after refusing ten thousand dollars offered him by congress\r\nto cover his expenses, he fell into pecuniary straits, became alienated\r\nfrom his country, (if he had been true before, which was doubted,)\r\nwriting home letters representing the American cause as desperate, and\r\nfavoring immediate accommodation with the enemy. These letters were\r\nintercepted by the enemy and published, and his real character was now\r\nmade manifest. Mr. Jay, who had been his friend and supporter, hearing\r\nthis at Madrid, took down his portrait and burnt it. Deane appears\r\nafterwards to have associated with the traitor Arnold. Deane died in\r\nextreme poverty at Deal, England, (1789.) He certainly rendered the\r\ncolonies great service at one time,[703:A] and found a strong party in\r\ncongress in his support, including men of both sections and of high\r\ncharacter. Mr. Paca, of Maryland, and Mr. Drayton, of South Carolina,\r\nprotested against the further continuance of Dr. Lee in the place of\r\ncommissioner in France and Spain. Dr. Lee's dissensions with Dr.\r\nFranklin resulted in bitter enmity. Dr. Lee charged Franklin with\r\nvanity, inflated by French flattery, with overweening and dictatorial\r\narrogance, with connivance at fraud and corruption, and with being under\r\nFrench influence. William Lee and Richard Henry sympathized warmly with\r\nArthur in these disputes. John Adams sided with the Lees. Arthur Lee, in\r\n1780, resigning his post, returned to America, and prepared to vindicate\r\nhimself before congress, but that body expressed their full confidence\r\nin his patriotism. In 1781 he was elected to the assembly of Virginia,\r\nand returned to congress, where he continued to represent the State for\r\nseveral years. He was a pure, earnest, incorruptible patriot, love of\r\ncountry being his ruling passion. Of a jealous disposition, and\r\nmelancholy, discontented temperament; of polite manners and strong\r\npassions. He was well skilled in Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and\r\nItalian. He never married. He meditated writing a history of the\r\nAmerican Revolution. In a letter to General Washington, dated at Berlin,\r\nin June, 1777, he says: \"It is my intention to write a history of this\r\ncivil contention. The share you have had in it will form an interesting\r\nand important part. It will be in your power to preserve a variety of\r\nmaterials, papers, and anecdotes for such a work. May I venture to hope\r\nthat you may think me so far worthy of your confidence as to preserve\r\nthem for me? Dubious parts of history can be cleared only by such\r\ndocuments, and we shall want every authentic record to vouch against the\r\nforgeries which will be offered to the world.\"[704:A]\r\n\r\nWilliam Lee, brother of Arthur, was born in Virginia, about the year\r\n1737. Sent to London as Virginia's agent before the Revolution, he took\r\nup his residence there. Being a zealous whig, he was elected, in 1773,\r\none of the sheriffs of London. At the commencement of the Revolution he\r\nretired to France, and afterwards was appointed by congress their\r\ncommissioner at Vienna and Berlin. An able man, and an ardent and\r\ninflexible patriot, by communicating important intelligence, and by his\r\ndiplomatic agency, he rendered invaluable services to his country. As a\r\nwriter he was little inferior to Arthur.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1780 James Madison took his seat in congress. He was\r\nborn in March, 1751, O. S., in the County of Caroline, Virginia, on the\r\nRappahannock River, near Port Royal, the son of James Madison, of Orange\r\nCounty, and Nelly Conway, his wife. At the age of twelve young Madison\r\nwas at school under Donald Robertson, a distinguished teacher in the\r\nneighborhood, and afterwards under the Rev. Thomas Martin, the parish\r\nminister, a private tutor in his father's family. He was next sent to\r\nthe College of New Jersey, of which Dr. Witherspoon was then president.\r\nHere Mr. Madison received the degree of bachelor of arts in the autumn\r\nof 1771. He had impaired his health at college by too close\r\napplication; nevertheless, on his return home he pursued a systematic\r\ncourse of reading. Shortly after his return he signed resolutions of his\r\ncounty approving of Henry's proceedings in the affair of the gunpowder.\r\nHe became a member of the convention in May, 1776, and it was during\r\nthis session that the body unanimously instructed the deputies of\r\nVirginia in congress to propose a declaration of independence. He did\r\nnot enter into public debate during this session. At the next election\r\nhe was defeated, his successful opponent being Colonel Charles Porter,\r\nwho was subsequently his frequent colleague in the house of delegates.\r\nMr. Madison was at the ensuing session appointed a member of the council\r\nof state, and this place he held till 1779, when he was elected to\r\ncongress. While he was of the council Patrick Henry and Mr. Jefferson\r\nwere governors. Mr. Madison's knowledge of French, of which Governor\r\nHenry was ignorant, rendered him particularly serviceable in the\r\nfrequent correspondence held with French officers: he wrote so much for\r\nGovernor Henry that he was called \"the governor's secretary.\" Mr.\r\nMadison took his seat in congress in March, 1780, and continued a\r\nleading member until the fall of 1783, when his congressional term\r\nexpired by limitation. Such was the commencement of the career of this\r\nman so illustrious for his genius, his learning, and his virtue, and who\r\nwas destined to pass through every eminent station, and to fill all with\r\nhonor to himself and benefit to his country and the world. As a writer,\r\na debater, a statesman, and a patriot, he was of the first order, and\r\nhis name goes down to posterity one of the brightest of those that adorn\r\nthe annals of the age in which he lived.[705:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[701:A] MS. letter of Arthur Lee, Edinburgh, March 20, 1765.\r\n\r\n[702:A] See Woodfall's Junius, i. 102, where Arthur Lee is erroneously\r\ncalled Dr. _Charles_ Lee.\r\n\r\n[703:A] Flanders' Lives of Chief Justices, art.

In June, 1780, when Captain\r\nBird, of Detroit, long the headquarters of British and Indian barbarity,\r\ninvaded Kentucky, Logan joined in the bloody raid. He was now about\r\nfifty-five years of age. Not long after this inroad, Logan, at an Indian\r\ncouncil held at Detroit, while phrenzied by liquor, prostrated his wife\r\nby a sudden blow, and she fell apparently dead. Supposing that he had\r\nkilled her, he fled to escape the penalty of blood. While travelling\r\nalone on horseback he was all at once overtaken, in the wilderness\r\nbetween Detroit and Sandusky, by a troop of Indians, with their squaws\r\nand children, in the midst of whom he recognized his relative\r\nTod-hah-dohs. Imagining that the avenger was at hand, Logan frantically\r\nexclaimed that the whole party should fall by his weapons. Tod-hah-dohs\r\nperceiving the danger, and observing that Logan was well armed, felt the\r\nnecessity of prompt action; and while Logan was leaping from his horse\r\nto execute his threat, Tod-hah-dohs levelled a shot-gun within a few\r\nfeet of him and killed him on the spot. Tod-hah-dohs, or the Searcher,\r\noriginally from Conestoga, and probably a son of Logan's sister who\r\nlived there, was better known as Captain Logan. He left children, (two\r\nof whom have been seen by Mr. Lyman C. Draper;) so that in spite of\r\nLogan's speech some of his blood, at least collaterally, still runs in\r\nhuman veins. Logan's wife recovered from the blow given her by her\r\nhusband, and returned to her own people.[706:A]\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of October, 1780, Major Andre was executed as a spy.\r\n\r\nBeverley Robinson, a son of the Honorable John Robinson, of Virginia,\r\npresident of the colony, removed to New York, and married Susanna,\r\ndaughter of Frederick Philipse, Esq., who owned a vast landed estate on\r\nthe Hudson. When the Revolution commenced, Beverley Robinson desired to\r\nremain in retirement, being opposed to the measures of the ministry, and\r\nto the separation of the colonies from the mother country. The\r\nimportunity of friends induced him to enter the military service of the\r\ncrown, and he became colonel of the Loyal American Regiment. He was\r\nimplicated in Arnold's treason, and accompanied Andre in the Vulture.\r\nAndre, when captured, was taken to Colonel Robinson's house, which had\r\nbeen confiscated, and then occupied by Washington. Robinson was sent by\r\nSir Henry Clinton as a witness in behalf of Andre.\r\n\r\nPrince William Henry, afterwards William the Fourth, was a guest of\r\nColonel Robinson, in New York, during the revolutionary war. Several of\r\nhis descendants, and those of Captain Roger Morris, have attained\r\ndistinction. Among them Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson, son of Colonel\r\nBeverley Robinson, was an officer of rank under Wellington, and saw hard\r\nservice in the Peninsular war, and was dangerously wounded at the siege\r\nof St. Sebastians. In the war of 1812 he led the British in the attack\r\non Plattsburg, under Prevost.[707:A]\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of October, a British fleet, in accordance with\r\nintelligence which had been communicated by spies and deserters, made\r\nits appearance in the Chesapeake. General Leslie was at the head of the\r\ntroops aboard. Having landed, they began to fortify Portsmouth. Their\r\nhighest post was Suffolk, and they occupied the line between Nansemond\r\nRiver and the Dismal Swamp. A person of suspicious appearance,\r\nendeavoring to pass through the country from Portsmouth toward North\r\nCarolina, was apprehended; and upon its being proposed to search him he\r\nreadily consented, but at the same time he was observed to put his hand\r\ninto his pocket and carry something toward his mouth, as if it were a\r\nquid of tobacco. Upon examination it proved to be a letter, written on\r\nsilk-paper, and rolled up in gold-beaters' skin, and nicely tied at\r\neach end, so as to be no larger than a goose-quill. The letter was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     \"To LORD CORNWALLIS:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY LORD,--I have been here near a week, establishing a post.\r\n     I wrote to you to Charleston, and by another messenger by\r\n     land. I cannot hear with certainty where you are. I wait your\r\n     orders. The bearer is to be handsomely rewarded if he brings\r\n     me any note or mark from your lordship.\r\n\r\n                                                            A. L.\r\n\r\n     \"Portsmouth, Virginia, November 4, 1780.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a source of mortification to Governor Jefferson and other\r\npatriots that the State was unable to defend herself for want of arms.\r\nIn compliance with the call of the executive, General Nelson made an\r\neffort to collect the militia of the lower counties, and to secure at\r\nleast the pass at the Great Bridge; but his exertions were ineffectual,\r\nas the alarmed inhabitants made it their first business to secure their\r\nfamilies and property from danger. General Lawson, who had at this time\r\nraised a corps of five hundred volunteers to march to the aid of South\r\nCarolina, was called on to aid in defending his own State, and General\r\nStevens was preparing to march with a detachment of the Southern army to\r\nher aid when[708:A] Leslie sailed for South Carolina to re-enforce\r\nCornwallis. Leslie during his stay had abstained entirely from\r\ndepredation and violence. Many negroes who had gone over to him were\r\nleft behind, either from choice or from want of ship-room. The chief\r\ninjury resulting from this invasion was the loss of cattle collected for\r\nthe use of the Southern army. Another consequence of it was the removal\r\nof the troops of convention from the neighborhood of Charlottesville.\r\nThey marched early in October, and crossing the Blue Ridge proceeded\r\nalong the valley to Winchester, where they were quartered in barracks.\r\nSome of the men occupied a church, and about sixty were confined in\r\njail, probably to prevent desertion. The troops were thence removed to\r\nFredericktown, Maryland, and afterwards to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The\r\nGerman troops of convention remained longer in Albemarle: they were\r\nremoved early in 1781, and quartered at Winchester, and the Warm\r\nSprings, in Berkley.\r\n\r\nThe assembly of Virginia was preparing, in the winter of this year, to\r\nweather, as well as possible, the storm which was gathering against her;\r\nbut without Northern assistance she was hardly able to cope with the\r\nenemy. She wanted clothes, arms, ammunition, tents, and other warlike\r\nstores. Ten millions of paper dollars were issued from necessity, but it\r\nwas evident that it would be as transient, as a dream at the present,\r\nand pernicious in its consequences; yet without it no resistance could\r\nbe made to the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[706:A] Brantz Mayer's Discourse on Logan and Cresap, 66.\r\n\r\n[707:A] Sabine's Loyalists, 562.\r\n\r\n[708:A] November fifteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVII.\r\n\r\n1780-1781.\r\n\r\n     Arnold's Invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWARD the close of December, 1780, a fleet appeared within the capes of\r\nthe Chesapeake, with a force detached by Sir Henry Clinton from New\r\nYork, under command of the traitor Arnold. A frigate in advance having\r\ncaptured some small vessels, Arnold, with the aid of them, pushed on at\r\nonce up the James. Attempting to land at Burwell's Ferry, (the Grove\r\nLanding,) his boats were beaten off by one hundred and fifty militia of\r\nWilliamsburg and James City, under Colonel Innes and General Nelson.\r\nNelson, on this occasion, retorted a verbal defiance in answer to a\r\nletter with which Arnold had ushered in his invasion.[710:A]\r\n\r\nLeaving a frigate and some transports at Burwell's Ferry, Arnold\r\nproceeded[710:B] up the river to Westover. Here landing a force of less\r\nthan eight hundred men, including a small party of badly mounted\r\ncavalry, he marched for Richmond at two o'clock in the afternoon of the\r\nsame day. Nelson, in the mean while, with a handful of militia, badly\r\nsupplied with ammunition, had marched up the right bank of the James\r\nRiver, but arrived too late to offer any opposition to the landing of\r\nthe enemy. Arnold, at one o'clock of the next day after he marched from\r\nWestover, entered the infant capital without having encountered any\r\nresistance, although his route was very favorable for it. The energetic\r\nSimcoe, with a detachment, proceeded a few miles beyond Richmond and\r\ndestroyed the foundry, emptied the contents of the powder magazine,\r\nstruck off the trunnions of the cannon, and set fire to the warehouses\r\nand mills, the effect of the conflagration being heightened by\r\noccasional explosions of gunpowder. Many small arms and a stock of\r\nmilitary supplies were destroyed, and five tons of gunpowder thrown into\r\nthe river. At Richmond the public stores fell a prey; private property\r\nwas plundered and destroyed; the soldiers broke into houses and procured\r\nrum; and several buildings were burnt. Part of the records of the\r\nauditor's office, and the books and papers of the council office shared\r\nthe same fate.\r\n\r\nGovernor Jefferson used every effort in his power to remove the public\r\nstores, and part were rescued by being removed across the river at\r\nWestham. Late on the night of the fourth he went to Tuckahoe, and on the\r\nnext day went down to Manchester, opposite Richmond, where the busy\r\nmovements of the enemy were in full view. When they advanced upon that\r\nplace only two hundred militia were embodied--too small a number to make\r\nany resistance. The governor, having repaired to Colonel Fleming's, in\r\nChesterfield, to meet Steuben, received there a message from Arnold,\r\noffering not to burn Richmond, on condition that British vessels should\r\nbe permitted to come to it unmolested and take away the tobacco. The\r\nproposition was rejected.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Richmond were, for the most part, Scotch factors, who\r\nlived in small tenements scattered here and there between the river and\r\nthe hill, some on the declivities, a few on the summit. Arnold withdrew\r\nfrom Richmond about mid-day on the sixth, encamped that night, as he had\r\non the march up, at Four-mile Creek, and on the next day at Berkley and\r\nWestover.\r\n\r\nArthur Lee wrote, on the twenty-first of March, from Greenspring to\r\nColonel Bland, as follows: \"Most certainly you would have heard from me\r\ncould I have found any conveyance but the tory-post the wisdom of our\r\npeople has established, or could I have given you a pleasing account of\r\nthe situation of our affairs here. But in truth, it is impossible to\r\nconceive a more hopeless state than what we are in. Laws without wisdom\r\nor justice, governments without system or order, complex and heavy taxes\r\nto raise money which is squandered away no one knows how, or wherefore,\r\nnot half the troops being raised, or those which are raided being\r\nprovided neither with arms, clothes, nor provisions. Twelve millions\r\nwere spent in two months, and when the enemy came, there was neither\r\nman, horse, musket, cannon, wagon, boat, or any one thing in the world\r\nthat could be found for our defence. In this situation it need not\r\nsurprise you that Arnold, with a handful of bad troops, should march\r\nabout the country, take and destroy what he pleased, feast with his tory\r\nfriends, settle a regular correspondence with them, which he carried on\r\nfor some time in vessels sent up the river and unnoticed, till one\r\nhappening to run aground discovered Mrs. Byrd's correspondence, which,\r\nhowever, will produce neither good to us nor injury to her. I have\r\nreason to think she will not be tried at all, means having been taken to\r\nkeep the witnesses out of the way.\"[712:A]\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria Byrd, of Westover, was a sister of Thomas Willing, Esq.,\r\ndirector of the Bank of North America, and partner of Robert Morris, and\r\na strenuous opponent of American independence. A sister of Mrs. Byrd\r\nmarried Captain Walter Sterling, of the British navy. Samuel Inglis,\r\nEsq., some time resident in Virginia as factor of the house of Willing &\r\nMorris, under the firm of Inglis & Willing, was a decided opponent of\r\nindependence. He married the daughter of William Aitcheson, Esq., of\r\nNorfolk, a Scotch tory, and was brother of Captain Inglis, of the\r\nBritish navy.[712:B]\r\n\r\nSimcoe, patroling in the night, surprised a party of militia at Charles\r\nCity Court-house, where, after some confused firing, the militia fled\r\nwith small loss; some few attempting to escape, were drowned in a\r\nmill-pond. Sergeant Adams, of Simcoe's Regiment, was mortally wounded,\r\nand dying shortly afterwards, was buried at Westover, wrapped in some\r\nAmerican colors taken a few days before at Hoods. Nelson, re-enforced at\r\nHolt's Forge by a party of Gloucester militia under Colonel John Page,\r\nfinding his force not exceeding four hundred men, retreated. On that\r\nnight[712:C] the British embarked at Westover, and dropped down the\r\nJames to Flower-de-Hundred. Here Simcoe was detached with a force to\r\ndislodge some militia at Bland's Mills, and after advancing about two\r\nmiles, the advance guard, in a dense wood, were fired on by some\r\nAmericans posted at the forks of the road in front. The British lost\r\ntwenty men killed and wounded; but, charging, put the militia to flight.\r\n\r\nArnold sending a detachment ashore at Fort Hoods, a skirmish ensued with\r\ntwo hundred and forty men in ambuscade, under Colonel George Rogers\r\nClarke. The enemy lost seventeen killed and thirteen wounded at the\r\nfirst fire, when Clarke being charged, found it necessary to retreat.\r\nJohn Marshall was present at this affair. The enemy dismantled the fort\r\nand carried off the heavy artillery. Nelson, in the mean time, by a\r\nforced march, reached Williamsburg just before the fleet came to off\r\nJamestown. Arnold, however, landed part of his forces at Cobham, on the\r\nopposite side of the river, and marched down, his ships keeping pace\r\nwith and occasionally re-enforcing him. On the next day Nelson paraded\r\nabout four hundred militia at Burwell's Ferry to oppose the landing of\r\nthe enemy. Re-enforcements arriving, augmented his force to twelve\r\nhundred; but the enemy was now beyond their reach. Colonel Griffin and\r\nColonel Temple, with a party of light horse, had hovered near the\r\nenemy's lines at Westover, and followed the fleet as it went down the\r\nriver. In this party were Colonels William Nelson, Gregory Smith, Holt\r\nRichardson, Major Buller Claiborne, General Lincoln's aid, and Majors\r\nBurwell, Ragsdale, and others, together with a number of young\r\ngentlemen. Arnold returned to Portsmouth on the twentieth of January\r\nwithout having encountered any serious interruption.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that while the regular troops of Virginia were serving\r\nat a distance in other States, the militia, after a five years' war, was\r\nstill so unarmed and undisciplined that no effective resistance was made\r\nto this daring invasion.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when Arnold reached Portsmouth, some of his\r\nartillery-men, foraging on the road toward the Great Bridge, were\r\nattacked, their wagons captured and their officer wounded. Simcoe, with\r\na handful of yagers and Queen's Rangers, was detached for the purpose of\r\nrecovering the wagons. Ferrying across to Herbert's Point they advanced\r\nabout a mile, when \"an artillery-man, who had escaped and lay in the\r\nbushes, came out and informed him that Lieutenant Rynd lay not far off.\r\nSimcoe found him shockingly mangled and mortally wounded; he sent to a\r\nneighboring farm for an ox-cart, on which the unfortunate young\r\ngentleman was placed. The rain continued in a violent manner, which\r\nprecluded all pursuit of the enemy; it now grew more tempestuous, and\r\nended in a perfect hurricane, accompanied with incessant lightning. This\r\nsmall party slowly moved back toward Herbert's Ferry; it was with\r\ndifficulty that the drivers and attendants on the cart could find their\r\nway; the soldiers marched on with bayonets fixed, linked in ranks\r\ntogether, covering the road. The creaking of the wagon and the groans of\r\nthe youth added to the horror of the night; the road was no longer to be\r\ntraced when it quitted the woods, and it was a great satisfaction that a\r\nflash of lightning, which glared among the ruins of Norfolk, disclosed\r\nHerbert's house. Here a boat was procured, in which the unhappy youth\r\nwas conveyed to the hospital-ship, where he died the next day.\"[714:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[710:A] In a series of replies made by Mr. Jefferson to strictures\r\nthrown out upon his conduct of affairs at this juncture, the following\r\noccurs: \"Query--Why publish Arnold's letter without General Nelson's\r\nanswer?

He reached Charlotte, the headquarters of the\r\nSouthern army, early in December. About this time Lee's legion was\r\nordered into South Carolina, to a point west of the Catawba. Cornwallis,\r\nwhose headquarters were at Winnsborough, detached Tarleton in pursuit of\r\nMorgan, who retreated to the Cowpens, and resolved to risk a battle\r\nthere. Tarleton leaving his baggage behind him well guarded, started,\r\nwith his accustomed celerity, at three o'clock in the morning,[715:A] in\r\npursuit. Before day Morgan received intelligence of his approach, and\r\nprepared for action. He drew up his regulars and Triplett's corps,\r\nreckoned not inferior to them, and about four or five hundred men, under\r\nHoward, on an eminence in an open wood. In their rear, on the declivity\r\nof the hill, Lieutenant-Colonel Washington was posted with his cavalry\r\nand some mounted Georgia militia as a reserve; and with these two corps\r\nMorgan remained in person. The front line was composed of militia, under\r\nPickens. Major McDowell, with a battalion of North Carolina volunteers,\r\nand Major Cunningham, with a battalion of Georgia volunteers, were\r\nadvanced about one hundred and fifty yards in front of this line.\r\nMorgan's whole force amounted to eight hundred men. Soon after the\r\ntroops were disposed, the British van appeared in sight, and Tarleton\r\nforming his line of battle, his troops rushed forward to the attack,\r\nshouting. Morgan's first line soon retreated into the rear of the\r\nsecond. The British advanced in spite of a firm resistance; Tarleton\r\nordered up his reserve, and Howard's infantry being outflanked, Morgan\r\nrode up and directed that corps to retreat over the summit of the hill,\r\nabout one hundred yards, to the cavalry. The British, now confident of\r\nvictory, pressed on, in some disorder, and when the Americans halted,\r\nwere within thirty yards of them. At Howard's order, his men turning,\r\nfaced the enemy, and poured in, unexpectedly, a deadly fire. Howard,\r\nperceiving that the enemy's ranks were thrown into some confusion,\r\nordered a charge with the bayonet, and the British line was broken. The\r\ncavalry on their right was at the same time routed by Washington. Howard\r\nand Washington pressed their advantage until the artillery and greater\r\npart of the infantry surrendered; but Washington pursuing too eagerly,\r\nreceived a temporary check, and sustained a heavier loss in this part of\r\nthe action than in any other. However, the infantry advancing to support\r\nhim, Tarleton resumed his retreat.[716:A]\r\n\r\nIn this battle one hundred British, including ten commissioned officers,\r\nwere killed; twenty-nine commissioned officers and five hundred privates\r\nmade prisoners. A large quantity of arms and baggage and one hundred\r\ndragoon horses fell into the hands of the victors. Morgan lost less than\r\neighty men in killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nTarleton retreated toward Cornwallis, whose headquarters were now\r\ntwenty-five miles distant. In this action Cornwallis had lost one-fifth\r\nof his number and the flower of his army. But Greene was not strong\r\nenough to press the advantage; and Morgan, apprehensive of being\r\nintercepted by Cornwallis, abandoned the captured baggage, interring the\r\narms, and leaving his wounded under the protection of a flag, hastened\r\nto the Catawba, which he recrossed on the twenty-third. The prisoners\r\nwere sent by General Greene, under escort of Stevens' brigade of\r\nVirginia militia to Charlottesville.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Arnold, ensconced, like a vulture, was prevented from\r\nplanning new schemes of devastation by apprehensions that he now began\r\nto entertain for his own safety.[717:A] Richard Henry Lee wrote: \"But\r\nsurely, if secrecy and despatch were used, one ship-of-the-line and two\r\nfrigates would be the means of delivering Arnold and his people into our\r\nhands; since the strongest ship here is a forty-four, which covers all\r\ntheir operations. If I am rightly informed, the militia now in arms are\r\nstrong enough to smother these invaders in a moment if a marine force\r\nwas here to second the land operations.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary the ninth a French sixty-four gun-ship, with two frigates,\r\nunder Monsieur De Tilley, sailed for the Chesapeake, and arriving by the\r\nthirteenth threatened Portsmouth. But the ship-of-the-line proving too\r\nlarge to operate against the post, De Tilley, in a few days, sailed back\r\nfor Rhode Island. It was a great disappointment to the Virginians that\r\nthe French admiral could not be persuaded to send a force competent to\r\ncapture the traitor. Governor Jefferson, in a letter to General\r\nMuhlenburg, offered five thousand guineas for his capture; and suggested\r\nthat men might be employed to effect this by entering his quarters in\r\nthe garb of friends--a measure not to be justified even toward Benedict\r\nArnold.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of the Cowpens, Greene, closely pursued by Cornwallis,\r\nretreated across the Dan into Virginia. His lordship then proceeded to\r\nHillsborough, then the capital of North Carolina, where he invited the\r\ninhabitants to repair to the royal standard. Greene, re-enforced by a\r\nbody of Virginia militia under General Stevens, soon re-entered North\r\nCarolina, where numerous tories were embodying themselves to join\r\nCornwallis. On the twenty-fifth of February, Lee, with his cavalry, by\r\nstratagem surprising a body of royalists under Colonel Pyle, cut them\r\nto pieces. On the fifteenth of March occurred the battle of Guilford.\r\nGreene's army was much superior in numbers, but consisted mainly of\r\nmilitia and new levies. The cavalry of Lee and Washington was excellent,\r\nbut the ground was unfavorable for their action. The officers under\r\nGreene were mostly veteran. The Virginia militia were commanded by\r\nGenerals Stevens and Lawson, and by Colonels Preston, Campbell, and\r\nLynch; those of North Carolina by Generals Butler and Eaton. Of the\r\ncontinentals one Maryland regiment alone was veteran. Guilford\r\ncourt-house, near the great Salisbury road, stood on a hill which\r\ndescends eastward, gradually, with an undulating slope for half a mile,\r\nterminating in a little vale intersected by a rivulet. On the right of\r\nthe road the ground was open, with some copses of wood; on the left a\r\nforest. Greene, with not quite two thousand regulars, was posted at the\r\ncourt-house; in the field to the right of the road, the two regiments of\r\nVirginia under Huger, the two of Maryland under Williams. Three hundred\r\nyards in advance of the regulars were stationed the Virginia militia,\r\ncrossing at right angles the great road; and as far in front of them and\r\nacross the same road the North Carolina militia were formed: the\r\nVirginia line in the woods; the Carolinians partly in the forest and\r\npartly on its edge, behind a strong rail-fence, in front of which lay an\r\nopen field. Two pieces of artillery, under Captain Singleton, were\r\nplaced in the road a few yards in advance of the first line. The right\r\nflank was guarded by Washington's cavalry, a veteran Delaware company\r\nunder Kirkwood, and Colonel Lynch with a battalion of Virginia militia.\r\nThe left was guarded by Lee's legion and Campbell's riflemen. At about\r\nten o'clock in the forenoon, after some firing of artillery, the\r\nBritish, reaching the rivulet, deployed into line of battle, the right\r\ncommanded by Leslie, the left by Webster. The North Carolina militia,\r\nunable to stand the shock, a few excepted, broke, threw away their arms,\r\nand fled precipitately through the woods. The Virginia line received the\r\nenemy with more firmness, but the greater part of them were compelled to\r\nretreat, which was accelerated by the fall of General Stevens, who was\r\nwounded in the thigh. The struggle between the enemy and the\r\ncontinentals was stoutly contested, but the second Maryland regiment\r\nunexpectedly giving way, Greene was compelled to retreat. Cornwallis\r\npursued but a short distance. The American loss in killed and wounded\r\namounted to thirty officers and four hundred privates. The British loss\r\namounted to five hundred and thirty-two, including several valuable\r\nofficers. Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart of the guards was killed; Colonel\r\nWebster mortally wounded. The total number of Greene's army was\r\nforty-five hundred, of whom thirty hundred were actually engaged.\r\nCornwallis' force, according to American accounts, numbered two\r\nthousand; according to his statement, to only fourteen hundred and\r\nforty-five. After this disastrous victory Lord Cornwallis found it\r\nnecessary to retire toward Wilmington.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Arnold's anxiety for his safety at Portsmouth was\r\nrelieved by the arrival[719:A] of a re-enforcement under General\r\nPhillips. This accomplished and able but proud and passionate officer,\r\nexasperated by a tedious captivity, upon his exchange had been indulged\r\nby Sir Henry Clinton in a desire to invade Virginia, and wreak his\r\nvengeance on a State where he had been so long detained (unjustly as he,\r\nnot without some reason, believed) a prisoner of war. Having united\r\nArnold's force with his own, Phillips left Portsmouth,[719:B] and on the\r\nfollowing day the army landed at Burwell's Ferry, from which the militia\r\nfled. Phillips, with the main body, marched upon Williamsburg, and\r\nentered it without serious opposition. Simcoe, with a small party of\r\ncavalry, early next morning surprised a few artillery-men at Yorktown,\r\n(the rest escaping across the river in a boat,) and burnt \"a range of\r\nthe rebel barracks.\" The British sloop, Bonetta, anchored off the town.\r\nHow little did the parties engaged in this little episode anticipate the\r\ngreat event which was destined soon to make that ground classic! The\r\nBonetta, too, was destined to return to that picturesque place to play\r\nher part in the closing scene. Phillips, embarking at Barret's Ferry,\r\nnear the mouth of the Chickahominy, issued \"the strictest orders to\r\nprevent privateers, the bane and disgrace of the country which employs\r\nthem;\" but these orders were disregarded. When off Westover, he issued\r\nfurther orders, saying:\r\n\r\n\"A third object of the present expedition is to gain Petersburg, for\r\nthe purpose of destroying the enemy's stores at that place, and it is\r\npublic stores alone that are intended to be seized.\" A body of two\r\nthousand five hundred men under Phillips landed at City Point,[720:A]\r\nand passed the night there; and on the next morning (Wednesday) marched\r\nupon Petersburg, by way of Colonel Banister's Whitehall plantation,\r\nwhere they halted in the heat of the day and refreshed themselves.\r\nSteuben, with a thousand men, disputed the entry of the town. At about\r\ntwo o'clock the British advanced in two columns by the old road leading\r\nby the Blandford Church, and were opposed by a party of militia posted\r\non the heights, just beyond Blandford, under Captain House, of\r\nBrunswick, and Colonel Dick. The enemy were twice broken, and ran like\r\nsheep, and during two hours advanced only one mile. At length the\r\nbattalion of Americans posted at the Bollingbrook warehouses, near the\r\nBlandford Bridge, being flanked by four pieces of artillery, were\r\ncompelled to retire over the Appomattox, taking up Pocahontas Bridge as\r\nsoon as they had crossed it, ten men being killed in ascending the hill.\r\nOn this hill Steuben had placed some troops and cannon to cover his\r\nretreat. The American loss, killed, wounded, and taken, in this affair\r\nwas estimated at sixty; that of the British probably not less, there\r\nhaving been, according to Colonel Banister, not less than fourteen\r\nkilled; their wounded were sent down the river in gun-boats.\r\nAbercrombie, who commanded the British infantry on this occasion, was\r\nthe same who afterwards fell in Egypt. Phillips, taking possession of\r\nPetersburg, made his headquarters at Bollingbrook, a private residence,\r\non an eminence overlooking the river. He destroyed, next day, a large\r\nquantity of tobacco, the people removing it from the warehouses to save\r\nit from the flames. One of them was set fire to by a soldier and burnt.\r\nThe enemy also destroyed several vessels. The bridge over the Appomattox\r\nbeing readily repaired, Abercrombie, with a detachment, passed over on\r\nthe twenty-sixth, and took possession of the heights opposite the town,\r\nknown as Archer's Hill. Phillips, with his whole army, crossing on the\r\nsame day, burnt the bridge, and proceeded to commit devastations at\r\nChesterfield Court-house, Osbornes, and at Warwick, destroying the\r\nAmerican vessels, and shipping off the tobacco. This being private\r\nproperty, its destruction was in violation of his recent order. At\r\nManchester a detachment destroyed the warehouses and tobacco, and\r\nseveral dwelling-houses, the militia and inhabitants of Richmond being\r\nquiet spectators of the scene. Proceeding from Osbornes to Bermuda\r\nHundred, the British embarked there and sailed down the river as far as\r\nHog Island, where Phillips, receiving orders by an advice-boat, returned\r\nup the river, as far as Brandon, the seat of Benjamin Harrison, where\r\nthe troops landed in a gale of wind. Colonel Theodorick Bland, Sr.,\r\nreceived the following protection: \"It is Major-General Phillips'\r\npositive orders that no part of the property of Colonel Theodorick Bland\r\nreceive any injury from his majesty's troops.\r\n\r\n\"April 25th, 1781.\r\n\r\n\"J. W. NOBLE, aide-de-camp Major-General Phillips.\r\n\r\n\"Major-General Phillips is very happy to show this favor on account of\r\nColonel Bland Junior's many civilities to the troops of convention at\r\nCharlottesville.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, Colonel Bland's place of residence, Farmingdell,\r\nin Prince George County, was plundered by the British troops: his\r\nfurniture broken to pieces; china-ware pounded up; tobacco, corn, and\r\nstock destroyed, and negroes taken off. General Phillips being taken\r\nill, found it necessary to travel in a carriage, which was procured for\r\nhim by Simcoe.\r\n\r\nPart of the troops were sent[721:A] to City Point in boats; the rest\r\nmarched upon Petersburg, arrived there late in the night, and surprised\r\na party of American officers engaged in collecting boats for La Fayette\r\nto cross his army.[721:B] La Fayette, with a strong escort, appeared on\r\nthe heights opposite Petersburg, and the artillery, under Colonel Gimat,\r\ncannonaded the enemy's quarters. Bollingbrook, where General Phillips\r\nlay ill of a bilious fever, being exposed to the fire, it was found\r\nnecessary to remove him into the cellar, and it is commonly reported\r\nthat he died while the firing was going on. This mistake appears to have\r\noriginated with Anburey, who, in his Travels, mentions that during the\r\ncannonade, the British general, then at the point of death, exclaimed,\r\n\"My God, 'tis cruel: they will not let me die in peace!\" Anburey, being\r\nhimself a prisoner of war, was not in favorable circumstances for\r\nobtaining accurate information on this subject. It appears that the\r\ncannonading took place three days before the death of General Phillips.\r\nHe died on the thirteenth. La Fayette, aware that Bollingbrook was\r\nheadquarters, directed some shot particularly at that house, which, from\r\nits elevated site, afforded a conspicuous mark. This proceeding was\r\nprovoked by the horrid series of devastations which Phillips had just\r\nperpetrated in company of the traitor Arnold. Two balls struck the\r\nhouse, it is said, one passing through it. General Phillips lies buried\r\nin the old Blandford Churchyard. Miller,[722:A] a historian of his own\r\ncountry, observes that it would have been a fortunate circumstance for\r\nhis fame \"had he died three weeks sooner than he did.\"[722:B]\r\n\r\nUpon the death of General Phillips the command devolved on Arnold, and\r\nhe sent an officer with a flag and a letter to La Fayette. As soon as he\r\nsaw Arnold's name subscribed to the letter he refused to read it, and\r\ntold the officer that he would hold no intercourse whatever with Arnold;\r\nbut with any other officer he should be ever ready to interchange the\r\ncivilities which the circumstances of the two armies might render\r\ndesirable. Washington highly approved of this proceeding.\r\n\r\nAlready before the death of General Phillips, Simcoe had been detached\r\nfrom Petersburg to meet Cornwallis, who was advancing from North\r\nCarolina. Simcoe, on his route to the Roanoke, captured, some miles to\r\nthe south of the Nottoway River, a Colonel Gee, at his residence, \"a\r\nrebel militia officer,\" who, refusing to give his parole, was sent\r\nprisoner to Major Armstrong. Another \"rebel,\" Colonel Hicks, mistaking\r\nSimcoe's party for an advanced guard of La Fayette's army, was also made\r\nprisoner. At Hicks' Ford, a captain and thirty militia-men were taken by\r\na _ruse de guerre_, and compelled to give their paroles. Here Simcoe, on\r\nhis return toward Petersburg, met with Tarleton and his \"legion clothed\r\nin white.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this year (1781) Captain Harris, with the little brig Mosquito,\r\nafter taking two prizes, in a voyage to the West Indies was captured by\r\nthe British frigate Ariadne, and carried into Barbadoes. The men were\r\nconfined there in jail and prison-ships: the officers taken to England\r\nand incarcerated in Fortune Jail, at Gosport. Driven by cruel usage to\r\nmake a desperate attempt at escape, they succeeded, and returned to\r\nAmerica, and again bore arms against the enemy. Among them were\r\nLieutenant Chamberlayne, Midshipman Alexander Moore, Alexander Dick,\r\ncaptain of marines, and George Catlett, lieutenant of marines. Shortly\r\nafter the capture of the Mosquito, the Raleigh fell into the enemy's\r\nhands, and her crew were no less maltreated. The brig Jefferson, under\r\ncommand of Captain Markham, captured several prizes.\r\n\r\nAmong those distinguished for their gallantry in the little navy of\r\nVirginia was Captain Samuel Barron, (son of Commodore James Barron,)\r\nafterwards of the United States navy. Captain John Cowper, of Nansemond\r\nCounty, was in command of the Dolphin brig, with a crew of seventy-five\r\nmen. Embarking on a cruise, he nailed his flag to the mast-head, and\r\ndeclared that he would never strike it to an enemy. Engaging shortly\r\nafter with two British vessels, she was seen no more, and it is supposed\r\nthat she sunk during the action.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler was born at his father's residence, near Williamsburg, in\r\nJames City County, in 1748. His father, whose name he bore, was marshal\r\nfor the colony, and his mother was the daughter of Doctor Contesse, one\r\nof the Protestants driven from France by the revocation of the edict of\r\nNantes, and who found a home in Virginia. John Tyler, the younger of the\r\ntwo sons of this union, (the elder of whom died young,) enjoyed frequent\r\nopportunities of hearing the debates in the house of burgesses, and\r\nheard Patrick Henry in the stormy discussion on his resolutions in\r\n1765, and in the decline of life still related with animation his\r\nrecollections of that debate. He became so decided an opponent of the\r\ntyrannical pretensions of the mother country that his father often\r\npredicted that, sooner or later, he would be executed for high treason.\r\nMr. Tyler studied the law under Mr. Robert Carter Nicholas, and while\r\nthus engaged formed an acquaintance with Thomas Jefferson which ripened\r\ninto a friendship terminated only by death. The society of the ardent\r\nJefferson fanned the flame of young Tyler's patriotism, and he became at\r\nan early day the advocate of independence. About the year 1774, having\r\nobtained his license, he removed to Charles City, where he took up his\r\npermanent abode. Successful in the practice of the law, he was after a\r\nbrief interval elected a delegate from that county. He was re-elected\r\nfor several years, his colleague for the greater part of that time being\r\nBenjamin Harrison, Jr., of Berkley, whom Mr. Tyler succeeded as speaker\r\nof the house of burgesses. After the lapse of many years Mr. Tyler's\r\nson, of the same name, succeeded General William Henry Harrison, son of\r\nBenjamin Harrison, Jr., in the Presidency of the Union. Mr. Tyler, the\r\nrevolutionary patriot, while a member of the assembly, contracted an\r\nintimate friendship with Patrick Henry, for whom he entertained an\r\nalmost idolizing veneration. They corresponded for many years. Mr. Tyler\r\nparticipated largely in the debates, and on all occasions exhibited\r\nhimself a devoted patriot, and thoroughbred republican. In subsequent\r\nyears he was governor of Virginia and judge of the United States\r\ndistrict court. In private life his virtues won regard, in public his\r\nintegrity and talents commanded the confidence of his country.\r\n\r\nJohn Banister was the son of an eminent botanist, of the same name, who\r\nsettled in Virginia toward the close of the seventeenth century, and\r\ndevoted himself to the study of plants. In one of his botanical\r\nexcursions, near the falls of the Roanoke, he fell from a rock and was\r\nkilled. As a naturalist he was esteemed not inferior to Bartram. John\r\nBanister, the son, was educated in England, and bred to the law at the\r\nTemple. He was a burgess of the assembly, and afterwards a distinguished\r\nmember of the convention of 1776. In the following year he was an active\r\nmember of the assembly. He visited the headquarters of the American\r\narmy about the time of the battle of Germantown. In 1778-9 he was a\r\nmember of congress at York, and at Philadelphia, and in September\r\nvisited headquarters as member of the committee of arrangement. He was\r\none of the framers of the articles of confederation. In 1781 he was\r\nlieutenant-colonel of cavalry under General Lawson. The two other\r\ncolonels in the brigade were John Mercer, afterwards governor of\r\nMaryland, and James Monroe, subsequently President of the United States.\r\nLawson's corps was dissolved when Leslie retired from Virginia, and thus\r\nthe horse commanded by Colonel Banister was lost to the State, at a time\r\nwhen cavalry was so pressingly required. During the invasions which\r\nVirginia was subjected to, Colonel Banister was actively engaged in the\r\nefforts made to repel the enemy. Proprietor of a large estate, he\r\nsuffered repeated and heavy losses from the depredations of the British.\r\nAt one time, it is said, he supplied a body of troops, on their way to\r\nthe South, with blankets at his own expense.\r\n\r\nA miniature likeness of him is said to be preserved by his descendants\r\nin Amelia County. Of an excellent and well cultivated mind, and refined\r\nmanners, he was in private life amiable and upright, in public generous,\r\npatriotic, and enlightened. As a writer he may be ranked with the first\r\nof his day. A number of his letters have been published in the Bland\r\nPapers, and several, addressed to Washington, in Sparks' Revolutionary\r\nCorrespondence.\r\n\r\nColonel Banister resided near Petersburg, at Battersea, which house he\r\nbuilt. Chastellux visited it in 1781. Colonel Banister married, first,\r\nMary, daughter of Colonel Theodorick Bland, Sr. Of this union there were\r\nthree children; but this whole branch is extinct. Colonel Banister's\r\nsecond wife was Anne, sister of Judge Blair, of the federal court. There\r\nwere two sons of this marriage: Theodorick Blair, and John Monro.\r\nTheodorick Blair Banister married Signora Tabb. Children surviving,\r\n(1856:) Monro, Tudor, Yelverton, and two daughters. John Monro Banister\r\nmarried Mary B. Bolling. Children surviving: William C. Banister, the\r\nRev. John Monro Banister, and three daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[715:A] February 17th, 1781.\r\n\r\n[716:A] In the pursuit, Washington advanced near thirty yards in front\r\nof his men. Three British officers observing this charged upon him. The\r\nofficer on his right aimed a blow to cut him down, when an American\r\nsergeant intercepted it by disabling his sword arm. The officer on his\r\nleft was about to make a stroke at him, when a waiter saved him by\r\nwounding the assailant with a ball from a pistol. The officer in the\r\ncentre, believed to be Tarleton, now made a thrust at him, which he\r\nparried, upon which the officer retreated a few paces and then\r\ndischarged a pistol at him, which wounded his horse.\r\n\r\n[717:A] January 26th, 1781.\r\n\r\n[719:A] March twenty-seventh.\r\n\r\n[719:B] April eighteenth.\r\n\r\n[720:A] April twenty-third.\r\n\r\n[721:A] May ninth.\r\n\r\n[721:B] Tenth.\r\n\r\n[722:A] Hist. of England.\r\n\r\n[722:B] Bollingbrook, deriving its name from the family of Bolling, who\r\nowned much of the land on which the town of Petersburg was built,\r\nconsisted of two frame buildings, or wings, standing apart, it having\r\nbeen designed to connect them by a main building, which, however, was\r\nnever done.

To facilitate\r\nthe passage of the rivers, two boats, mounted on carriages, accompanied\r\nthe army. Tarleton led the advance. While the army was yet on the left\r\nbank of the Roanoke, Cornwallis, who had passed it, upon overtaking\r\nTarleton's detachment, ordered them to be dismounted and formed in line\r\nfor the inspection of the inhabitants, to enable them to discover the\r\nmen who had committed certain horrid outrages on the preceding evening.\r\nA sergeant and a dragoon being pointed out as the offenders, were\r\nremanded to Halifax, condemned by a court-martial, and executed. His\r\nlordship was prompted to such acts of discipline not only by his\r\nmoderation and humanity, but also by a desire to avoid any new\r\nexasperation of the people, and by a hope of alluring the loyalists to\r\nhis standard. On the 19th of May, 1781, he reached Petersburg, and with\r\nthe remnant of his Carolina army he now united the troops under Arnold,\r\nconsisting of a detachment of royal artillery, two battalions of light\r\ninfantry, the 76th and 80th British regiments, the Hessian regiment of\r\nthe Prince Hereditaire, Simcoe's corps of cavalry and infantry, called\r\nthe \"Queen's Rangers,\" chiefly tories, one hundred yagers, and Arnold's\r\nAmerican legion, likewise tories, the whole amounting to about two\r\nthousand five hundred men, which, together with the Carolina army, made\r\nhis lordship's aggregate force at Petersburg about four thousand five\r\nhundred. The entire field force now under his command in Virginia was\r\nnot less than seven thousand three hundred, including four hundred\r\ndragoons and seven or eight hundred mounted infantry. He received\r\nintelligence from Lord Rawdon of his having defeated Greene, at\r\nHobkirk's Hill. Cornwallis remained three or four days at Petersburg.\r\nLight troops and spies being despatched to discover La Fayette's\r\nposition, he was found posted near Wilton, on the James River, a few\r\nmiles below Richmond, with a thousand regulars and three thousand\r\nmilitia, the main body of them under command of General Nelson. La\r\nFayette was expecting re-enforcements of militia and Wayne's\r\nPennsylvania Brigade. In compliance with the orders of Governor\r\nJefferson, continental officers were substituted in the higher commands\r\nof the militia. Three corps of light infantry, of two hundred and fifty\r\neach, of select militia marksmen, were placed under command of Majors\r\nCall, Willis, and Dick of the continental line. La Fayette's cavalry\r\ncomprised only the remnant of Armand's corps, sixty in number, and a\r\ntroop of volunteer dragoons under Captain Carter Page, late of Baylor's\r\nRegiment. General Weedon, not now in service, owing to a diminution in\r\nthe number of officers, was requested to collect a corps of militia to\r\nprotect a manufactory of arms at Falmouth, opposite Fredericksburg.\r\nTarleton patroled from Petersburg as far as Warwick, and, surprising a\r\nbody of militia, captured fifty of them. In the mean while General\r\nLeslie arrived at the mouth of the James with a re-enforcement sent by\r\nClinton from New York. Cornwallis, upon receiving intelligence of it,\r\nordered Leslie to repair to Portsmouth with the 17th British Regiment,\r\ntwo battalions of Anspach, and the 43d, to join the main army. His\r\nlordship now proceeded with his forces to Macocks, on the James,\r\nopposite to Westover, where, being joined by the 43d, he crossed over,\r\nthe passage occupying nearly three days, the horses swimming by aid of\r\nboats, the river there being two miles wide.\r\n\r\nArnold obtained leave to return to New York, \"where business of\r\nconsequence demanded his attendance.\" The British officers had found it\r\nirksome to serve under him. Cornwallis afterwards told La Fayette that\r\nas soon as he joined the army in Virginia, he took the first occasion to\r\nsend Arnold down to Portsmouth, and expressed disgust at associating\r\nwith a person of his character.\r\n\r\nThe force concentrated by Cornwallis amounted to eight thousand. La\r\nFayette, hearing of this movement of the enemy, crossed the Chickahominy\r\nand retreated toward Fredericksburg, with a view of protecting the\r\narsenal at Falmouth and of meeting Wayne. Cornwallis pursued with\r\ncelerity, but finding La Fayette beyond his reach, gave out the chase,\r\nand encamped on the banks of the North Anna, in Hanover. La Fayette, who\r\nhad been hotly pursued by Tarleton, retreated precipitately beyond\r\nFredericksburg; and it was on this occasion that Cornwallis, in a\r\nletter, said of La Fayette: \"The boy cannot escape me.\" The Marquis de\r\nChastellux says: \"All I learnt by a conversation with Mr. Bird[728:A]\r\nwas that he had been pillaged by the English when they passed his house\r\nin their march from Westover in pursuit of Monsieur de la Fayette, and\r\nin returning to Williamsburg, after endeavoring in vain to come up with\r\nhim. It was comparatively nothing to see their fruits, fowls, and cattle\r\ncarried away by the light troops, which formed the van-guard; the army\r\ncollected what the van-guard had left; even the officers seized the rum\r\nand all kinds of provisions without paying a farthing for them; this\r\nhurricane, which destroyed everything in its passage, was followed by a\r\nscourge yet more terrible: a numerous rabble, under the title of\r\nRefugees and Loyalists, followed the army, not to assist in the field,\r\nbut to partake of the plunder. The furniture and clothes of the\r\ninhabitants were in general the sole booty left to satisfy their\r\navidity; after they had emptied the houses, they stript the proprietors,\r\nand Mr. Bird repeated with indignation that they had taken from him by\r\nforce the very boots from off his legs.\" \"Mr. Tilghman, our\r\nlandlord,[728:B] though he lamented his misfortune in having lodged and\r\nboarded Lord Cornwallis and his retinue without his lordship's having\r\nmade him the least recompense, could not yet help laughing at the fright\r\nwhich the unexpected arrival of Tarleton spread among a considerable\r\nnumber of gentlemen who had come to hear the news, and were assembled at\r\nthe court-house. A negro on horseback came full gallop to let them know\r\nthat Tarleton was not above three miles off. The resolution of\r\nretreating was soon taken; but the alarm was so sudden and the confusion\r\nso great that every one mounted the first horse he could find, so that\r\nfew of those curious gentlemen returned upon their own horses.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his army encamped in Hanover, Cornwallis detached Simcoe with five\r\nhundred men, Queen's Rangers and yagers, with a three-pounder, the\r\ncavalry amounting to one hundred. The object of this expedition was to\r\ndestroy the arsenal lately erected at the Point of Fork, and the\r\nmilitary stores there. The Point of Fork is contained between the\r\nRivanna and the James, in the County of Fluvanna. At the same time his\r\nlordship detached Tarleton with his legion, and one company of the 23d\r\nRegiment, with the design of capturing Governor Jefferson, and the\r\nmembers of the assembly, then convened at Charlottesville, and also of\r\ndestroying military stores.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent incursions of Phillips and Arnold a state arsenal had\r\nbeen established at the Point of Fork, and military stores collected\r\nthere with a view to the prosecution of the war in the Carolinas. The\r\nprotection of this post had been entrusted to Baron Steuben, who had\r\nacquired a knowledge of the military art under Frederick the Great.\r\nSteuben's force consisted of between five and six hundred new levies,\r\n(originally intended for the Southern army,) and a few militia under\r\nGeneral Lawson. Cornwallis informed Simcoe that the baron's force was\r\nonly three or four hundred; but Simcoe held the earl's military\r\nintelligence in slight respect. Thus he says:[729:A] \"He had received no\r\nadvices from Lord Cornwallis, whose general intelligence he knew to be\r\nvery bad.\" \"The slightest reliance was not to be placed on any patroles\r\nfrom his lordship's army.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Spencer, with twenty hussars, formed Simcoe's advanced guard\r\nof chosen men mounted on fleet horses. Simcoe crossing the South Anna,\r\npushed on with his usual rapidity by Bird's Ordinary toward Napier's\r\nFord on the Rivanna. Cornwallis, with the main body, followed in\r\nSimcoe's route. No inhabitant of the country coming within view escaped\r\ncapture. From some of the prisoners intelligence was obtained that\r\nSteuben was at the Point of Fork and in the act of crossing to the south\r\nside of the James. The baron adopted this measure in consequence of\r\nintelligence of Tarleton's incursion. Within two miles of Steuben's camp\r\na patrol of dragoons appeared, was chased and taken; it consisted of a\r\nFrench officer and four of Armand's corps. The advanced men of Spencer's\r\nguard changed clothes with the prisoners for the purpose of attempting\r\nto surprise the baron at the only house at the Point of Fork. Just as\r\nSimcoe was about to give the order to his men to lay down their\r\nknapsacks in preparation for an engagement, the advanced guard brought\r\nin a prisoner, Mr. Farley, Steuben's aid, who had mistaken them for the\r\npatrol which had just been captured. He assured Simcoe that he had seen\r\nevery man over the James before he left the Point of Fork, and this was\r\nconfirmed by some captured wagoners. Simcoe's cavalry advancing, plainly\r\nsaw the baron's force on the opposite side. About thirty of Steuben's\r\npeople, collected on the bank where the embarcation had taken place,\r\nwere captured. Simcoe, thus disappointed, employed stratagem to persuade\r\nthe baron that the party was Earl Cornwallis' whole army, so as to cause\r\nthe arms and stores that covered the opposite banks to be abandoned.\r\nCaptain Hutchinson, with the 71st Regiment clothed in red, was directed\r\nto approach the banks of the James, while the baggage and women halted\r\nin the woods on the summit of a hill, where they made the appearance of\r\na numerous corps, the woods mystifying their numbers, and numerous\r\ncamp-fires aiding the deception. The three-pounder was carried down and\r\none shot fired, by which was killed the horse of one of Steuben's\r\norderly dragoons. The baron was encamped on the heights on the opposite\r\nshore, about three-quarters of a mile back from the river. He had passed\r\nthe river in consequence of intelligence of Tarleton's incursion, which\r\nhe apprehended was aimed at him. The river was broad and unfordable, and\r\nSteuben was in possession of all the boats. Simcoe himself was now in an\r\nexposed position; but his anxiety was relieved when the baron's people\r\nwere heard at night destroying their boats with great noise. At midnight\r\nthey made up their camp fires. Soon after a deserter and a little\r\ndrummer-boy passed over in a canoe, and gave information that Steuben\r\nhad marched off on the road by Cumberland Court-house toward North\r\nCarolina. The drummer-boy belonged to the 71st Regiment; he had been\r\ntaken prisoner at the Cowpens, had enlisted in Morgan's army, and now\r\nmaking his escape happened to be received by a picket-guard which his\r\nown father commanded. On the following day, by aid of some canoes,\r\nSimcoe sent across the river Captain Stevenson with twenty light\r\ninfantry, and Cornet Wolsey with four hussars, who carried their saddles\r\nwith them. The infantry detachment were ordered to bring off such\r\nsupplies as Simcoe might need, and to destroy the remainder. The hussars\r\nwere directed to mount upon such straggling horses as they could find,\r\nand patrol in Steuben's wake. Both orders were executed; the stores were\r\ndestroyed and Steuben's retreat accelerated. Simcoe in the mean while\r\nemployed his men in constructing a raft by which he might pass the\r\nRivanna. There was destroyed here a large quantity of arms, the greater\r\npart of them, however, out of repair, together with ammunition and\r\nmilitary stores. The quantity and value of property destroyed were\r\nexaggerated by the enemy; as also was Steuben's force. Simcoe took away\r\na mortar, five brass howitzers, and four long brass nine-pounders, all\r\nFrench, mounted afterwards at Yorktown. According to his opinion a small\r\nguard left by Steuben would have protected these stores. The disaster\r\nwas probably owing to a want of accurate military intelligence. Simcoe\r\nheld Steuben's military qualifications in high estimation; but his\r\nopinion of La Fayette was the reverse.\r\n\r\nMean while Tarleton, passing rapidly along the road by Louisa\r\nCourt-house, met with some wagons laden with clothing for the Southern\r\narmy, and burnt them. Learning that a number of gentlemen, who had\r\nescaped from the lower country, were assembled, some at Dr. Walker's,\r\nthe others at Mr. John Walker's,[731:A] Tarleton, instead of advancing\r\nat once upon Charlottesville, despatched Captain Kinloch with a party to\r\nMr. John Walker's, while he proceeded with the rest to the doctor's\r\nmansion, where he surprised Colonel John Syme, half-brother to Patrick\r\nHenry, Judge Lyons, and some other gentlemen who were found asleep, it\r\nbeing early in the morning.[732:A] Captain Kinloch captured Francis\r\nKinloch, his relative, a delegate to congress from South Carolina,\r\ntogether with William and Robert Nelson, brothers to General Thomas\r\nNelson. There is a family tradition that when this Captain Kinloch was\r\nabout to leave England, the ladies of his family begged him not to kill\r\nhis cousin in America, and that he replied, \"No, but I will be sure to\r\ntake him prisoner,\" which playful prediction was now fulfilled.[732:B] A\r\nMr. Jouitte, mounted on a fleet horse, conveyed intelligence of\r\nTarleton's approach to Charlottesville, so that the greater part of the\r\nmembers of the assembly escaped.[732:C] Tarleton, after a delay of some\r\nhours, entered Charlottesville; seven of the delegates fell into his\r\nhands, and the public stores were destroyed. Captain McCleod, with a\r\ntroop of horse, visited Monticello with a view of capturing Mr.\r\nJefferson; but he had about sunrise received information of Tarleton's\r\napproach. Some members of the assembly, and the speakers of both houses,\r\nwho were his guests, hastened to Charlottesville; Mrs. Jefferson and her\r\nchildren hurried off in a carriage, and Mr. Jefferson followed\r\nafterwards on horseback, a few minutes before McCleod reached the house.\r\nThe magnificent panorama of mountain scenery visible there must have\r\nafforded him and his dragoons some compensation for the disappointment.\r\nWhile Tarleton was in the neighborhood of Charlottesville, some British\r\nand Hessian prisoners of the convention troops cantoned with the\r\nplanters, joined him. The prisoners of distinction, whom he had\r\ncaptured, were treated with lenity, being detained only a few days on\r\ntheir parole not to escape; \"the lower class were secured as prisoners\r\nof war.\" The prisoners of note were released at Elkhill, a plantation of\r\nMr. Jefferson's, where Cornwallis for ten days made his headquarters.\r\nThis plantation was laid waste by the enemy. Wherever his lordship's\r\narmy went, plantations were despoiled, and private houses plundered.\r\nDuring the six months of his stay in Virginia she lost thirty thousand\r\nslaves, of whom the greater part died of small-pox and camp fever; and\r\nthe rest were shipped to the West Indies, Nova Scotia, etc. The\r\ndevastations committed during these six months were estimated at upwards\r\nof thirteen millions of dollars.[733:A]\r\n\r\nPeter Francisco, a soldier of the Revolution, celebrated for his\r\nphysical strength and personal prowess, lived long in the County of\r\nBuckingham, Virginia, and died there. His origin is obscure: he supposed\r\nthat he was a Portuguese by birth, and that he was kidnapped when an\r\ninfant, and carried to Ireland. He had no recollection of his parents,\r\nand the first knowledge that he retained of himself was of being in that\r\ncountry when a small boy. Resolving to come to America, he indented\r\nhimself to a sea-captain for seven years, in payment of his passage. On\r\narriving in Virginia he was indented to Anthony Winston, Esq., of\r\nBuckingham, and labored on his estate until the breaking out of the\r\nRevolution. Being then at the age of sixteen he obtained permission to\r\nenlist in the army. At the storming of Stony Point he was the next,\r\nafter Major Gibbon, to enter the fortress, and he received a bayonet\r\nwound in the thigh. He was present in the battles of Brandywine,\r\nMonmouth, the Cowpens, Camden, and Guilford Court-house. In the\r\nlast-mentioned action, where he belonged to Colonel Washington's\r\ndragoons, his strong arm levelled eleven of the enemy. His bravery was\r\nequal to his strength.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1781, while reconnoitring alone, and stopping at a house\r\nin Amelia, now Nottoway, he was made prisoner by a detachment of\r\nTarleton's dragoons. But availing himself of a favorable opportunity,\r\nwhen one of the British was stooping to take off his silver\r\nshoe-buckles, Francisco wounded him with his own sword, and another, and\r\nby a ruse frightened off the rest of the party, who fled, leaving their\r\nhorses, although Tarleton's corps was in full view. This exploit was\r\nillustrated by an engraving, published in 1814, a favorite ornament of\r\nthe drawing-room. Peter Francisco was in height six feet and one inch:\r\nhis weight was two hundred and sixty pounds: his strength Herculean. He\r\nused a sword of extraordinary size. His complexion was that of a native\r\nof the south of Europe, his eye dark, his whole appearance massive,\r\nunique, and remarkable. An excellent portrait of him was made by\r\nHarding. John Randolph, of Roanoke, brought the attention of congress to\r\nPeter Francisco's military services in an interesting memoir, and\r\napplied for a pension for him. He was in old age made sergeant-at-arms\r\nto the house of delegates.[734:A]\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs in Virginia in the summer of 1781 was gloomy,\r\nhumiliating, apparently almost desperate. After a war of five years the\r\nState was still unfortified, unarmed, unprepared. But it was asked, did\r\nnot every Virginian possess a gun of some kind, and was it not with such\r\narms that the battles of Bunker Hill and of the Cowpens were fought?\r\nVirginia had entered upon the war when she was already loaded with debt,\r\nand exhausted by her Indian war, and by her non-importation policy,\r\nbefore the war began. Intersected by rivers, she was everywhere exposed\r\nto the inroads of the enemy; and a dense slave population obstructed the\r\nprompt movement of the militia. The darkness of the future was relieved\r\nby a single ray of hope derived from the uncertain rumors of the sailing\r\nof a French fleet for America; but frequent disappointment rendered hope\r\nof help from that quarter precarious. The bulk of the people were\r\nstaunch whigs and well affected to the French alliance; but they were\r\ngrowing despondent, and some were even beginning to fear that France was\r\nprolonging the war so as to weaken America as well as Great Britain, and\r\nto render the new confederation dependent upon its allies. With the aid\r\nof a superior French fleet there could be no doubt of the successful\r\nissue of the war; without that aid, there was too much reason to fear\r\nthat the people could not be kept much longer firm, in so unequal a\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nLa Fayette, joined by Wayne's brigade, eight or nine hundred strong,\r\nmarched toward Albemarle old court-house, where some magazines remained\r\nuninjured by the British, and he succeeded in saving them from\r\nTarleton's grasp. La Fayette at this place was joined by Colonel\r\nCampbell, the hero of King's Mountain, with his riflemen. Cornwallis, in\r\naccordance with advices from Clinton, retired to the lower country, and\r\nwas followed by La Fayette, who had, in the mean time, above Richmond\r\nbeen re-enforced by Steuben with his new levies and some militia.\r\nCornwallis halted for a few days at Richmond; Simcoe being posted at\r\nWestham; Tarleton at the Meadow Bridge. La Fayette's army amounted to\r\nfour thousand five hundred, of whom one-half were regular; and of these,\r\nfifteen hundred were veterans; he was still inferior to his lordship in\r\nnumbers, by one-third, and very deficient in cavalry. Cornwallis,\r\nleaving the picturesque hills of Richmond on the 20th of June, 1781,\r\nreached Williamsburg on the twenty-fifth. La Fayette followed, and\r\npassing Richmond arrived at New Kent Court-house on the day after the\r\nBritish general had left it. La Fayette took up a position on Tyre's\r\nplantation, twenty miles from Williamsburg. Cornwallis having detached\r\nSimcoe to destroy some boats and stores on the Chickahominy, he\r\nperformed the service with his accustomed promptness. La Fayette\r\ndiscovering Simcoe's movement, detached Colonel Butler, of the\r\nPennsylvania line, in quest of him. Butler's van consisted of the rifle\r\ncorps under Majors Call and Willis and the cavalry; the whole\r\ndetachment, not exceeding one hundred and twenty effectives, was led by\r\nMajor McPherson, of Pennsylvania. Having mounted some infantry behind\r\nthe remnant of Armand's dragoons, he overtook Simcoe, on his return,\r\nnear Spencer's plantation, about six miles above Williamsburg, at the\r\nforks of the roads leading to that place and to Jamestown. The ground\r\nthere, in Simcoe's phrase, was \"admirably adapted to the chicanery of\r\naction.\" The suddenness of McPherson's attack threw the yagers into\r\nconfusion, but they were firmly supported by the Queen's Rangers, to\r\nwhom the alarm was given by trumpeter Barney, exclaiming: \"Draw your\r\nswords, Rangers; the rebels are coming!\" Barney himself captured a\r\nFrench officer. Call and Willis having now joined McPherson, a warm\r\nconflict ensued; and Simcoe found occasion for all his resources. The\r\nadvanced party of Butler's corps was repulsed, and fell back in\r\nconfusion upon the continentals, and Simcoe, satisfied with this\r\nadvantage, retired. Both parties claimed the advantage in this\r\nrencontre, the loss of the British being eleven killed and twenty-six\r\nwounded; that of the Americans was not reported, except that three\r\nofficers and twenty-eight privates were made prisoners; the number of\r\ntheir killed and wounded probably exceeded that of the British.[736:A]\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Simcoe considered this action as \"the climax of a\r\ncampaign of five years.\" Major McPherson was unhorsed, but crept into a\r\nswamp, and so escaped. Simcoe, after retreating two miles toward\r\nWilliamsburg, met Cornwallis with the advance of his army coming to his\r\nrelief. Colonel Butler, the American commander in this affair, was the\r\nsame who afterwards fell at St. Clair's defeat.\r\n\r\nLate in June, Cornwallis, with an escort of cavalry under Simcoe,\r\nvisited Yorktown for the purpose of examining the capabilities of that\r\npost; and his lordship formed an unfavorable opinion of it. The party\r\nwas ineffectually fired at from Gloucester Point, and returned on the\r\nsame day to Williamsburg. After halting here nine days,\r\nCornwallis[736:B] marched, and encamped near Jamestown Island, for the\r\npurpose of crossing the James and proceeding to Portsmouth. The Queen's\r\nRangers passed over the river in the evening of the same day to cover\r\nthe baggage which was now transported. La Fayette, as Cornwallis had\r\npredicted, now advanced with the hope of striking at the rear-guard\r\nonly, of the enemy, supposing, upon imperfect intelligence, that the\r\nmain body had already crossed. Accordingly, about sunset[736:C] La\r\nFayette attacked Cornwallis near Greenspring, and after a warm conflict\r\nwas compelled to retreat, having discovered that he was engaged by the\r\nmain body of the British. Of the continentals one hundred and eighteen\r\nwere killed, wounded, or taken. Some cannon also fell into the hands of\r\nthe enemy. The British state their loss at five officers and seventy\r\nprivates killed and wounded. Cornwallis now crossed the James unmolested\r\nand marched[737:A] for Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nLa Fayette, re-enforced by some dragoons from Baltimore, retired to a\r\nstrong position near the head of York River. The militia had already\r\nbeen discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[726:A] April twenty-fifth.\r\n\r\n[728:A] Landlord of the Ordinary in New Kent.\r\n\r\n[728:B] At Hanover Court-house.\r\n\r\n[729:A] Simcoe's Journal, 226.\r\n\r\n[731:A] Belvoir, about seven miles from Charlottesville, and the\r\nresidence of the late Judge Hugh Nelson.

To afford some little relief to the distressed inhabitants, for\r\nthe most part women, the men being at sea, or in the army, or prisoners,\r\nit was determined to employ the only vessel then afloat belonging to the\r\nState--the schooner Patriot. She was small, and mounted only eight\r\ntwo-pounders; but she had more than once captured vessels of twice her\r\ncalibre. Captain Watkins having received his orders, proceeded at once\r\ndown the James River upon this service. For some weeks a sloop, supposed\r\nto be a privateer, had been committing depredations, and Watkins\r\ndetermined to overhaul her. Two young Virginians were on the north side\r\nof the James, in the County of Elizabeth City, endeavoring day after day\r\nto cross the river and find a safer refuge on the south side of it.\r\nDaily emerging from a small house, \"in the great gust-wood,\" where they\r\nfound temporary shelter, they repaired to the river side, distant about\r\nthree miles, looking out for some craft to convey them across. In\r\ncompany of the two brothers was a negro, a native of Africa, who had\r\nbeen brought to Virginia in his youth, and had soon evinced an ardent\r\nattachment to it. He was an expert pilot, and a devoted \"patriot.\" On a\r\nSunday morning, as the trio stood on the river bank, at a point in\r\nWarwick County, they espied the schooner Patriot in chase of the\r\nplundering sloop, and apparently gaining fast upon her. The negro, known\r\nas Captain Starlins, at this spectacle, gave noisy utterance to his\r\nextravagant joy, hopping about and clapping together his uplifted hands.\r\nThe three hoped soon to witness the capture of the sloop; but it turned\r\nout that she was purposely retarded in her course by a drag thrown out\r\nover her starboard bow, and the Patriot coming alongside of her, there\r\nsuddenly up jumped fifty marines, and in a moment the Patriot was\r\ncaptured.[739:A] The three spectators beheld the catastrophe with\r\nintense disappointment. From the zenith of hope Captain Starlins had\r\nbeen suddenly plunged souse down to the nadir of despair. He and the\r\nyounger of the brothers burst into tears, while the older brother,\r\nfifteen years of age, although no less grieved, had more command over\r\nhis sensibilities. Giving a parting look to the unfortunate schooner as\r\nshe disappeared in the hazy distance, they retraced their steps. Watkins\r\nand those under him were sent off to Charleston, and confined in the\r\nprovost prison, where he died. The Patriot was taken round to Yorktown.\r\nCaptain Mark Starlins died a slave a few years after, and just before\r\nthe passage of a law giving freedom to those men of color who had served\r\nthe patriotic cause. His slavery, however, appears to have been merely\r\nnominal; for his master fully appreciated his noble character, and which\r\nwas held in high estimation by all worthy citizens, especially by all\r\nthe navy officers of Virginia. The two brothers were the Barrons,\r\nafterwards distinguished in the United States naval service.[739:B]\r\n\r\nIn 1782 Maryland sent out Commodore Whaley, with some barges, to protect\r\nthe Eastern Shore of that State against bucaneering crafts manned by\r\nBritish sailors, and tories, and negroes. Receiving information of the\r\nappearance of a flotilla of such barges in the Chesapeake Bay, under\r\ncommand of a Commodore Kid, a Scotchman, Whaley, deeming them too strong\r\nfor him, solicited aid from Colonel John Cropper, commander of Accomac\r\nCounty, who, with a party of volunteers, re-enforced him. Colonel\r\nCropper, with several Accomac gentlemen, went on board the Protector,\r\nthe commodore's barge. Whaley having requested those in the other barges\r\nto support him in case the enemy should make a push at him, they\r\npromised to do so, \"or all sink together.\" The enemy's barges were\r\ndescried in the morning of the thirtieth of November, in Cagey's\r\nStraits: they soon hove to, and formed in line. The action commenced at\r\nhalf-past nine o'clock, and lasted twenty-five minutes. The foremost of\r\nWhaley's barges having fired a few shot at long distance, retreated. He,\r\nnevertheless, with the Protector advanced to within fifty yards of the\r\nenemy, exposed to their fire, and returning it warmly. A gunner, in\r\nhanding an eighteen-pounder cartridge out of the chest, happened to\r\nbreak it, and the spilt powder, although water had been poured upon it,\r\ncaught fire from the flash of the small arms, and the chest exploded,\r\nproducing great confusion on board, killing two or three, and causing a\r\nnumber of men, some with their clothes on fire, to jump overboard. The\r\nenemy, encouraged by this, pushed on with redoubled fury, and Whaley was\r\ndeserted by his other five barges, who fled ingloriously, leaving their\r\ncommander to his fate. Three of Kid's barges were already alongside of\r\nhim, when a second ammunition chest exploded, renewing the scene of\r\ndisaster and confusion. Lieutenant Handy enquired of Whaley whether it\r\nwould not be better to strike: he replied that he should not strike.\r\nColonel Cropper describes the action at this time as \"a continual shower\r\nof musket bullets, pikes, cold shot, cutlasses, and iron stantials, for\r\neight or ten minutes.\" The Protector being overpowered by numbers, most\r\nof the men being driven from their quarters, she was surrendered, the\r\ngeneral cry being for quarter, which, however, the enemy refused. The\r\nbarge was now boarded by the blacks with brutal cruelty. In this action\r\nall the Protector's officers were either killed or wounded. Whaley fell,\r\nkilled by a musket ball; Captain Handy fell fighting with one arm, after\r\nthe other had been broken. Lieutenant Handy was severely wounded. Of the\r\nsixty-five men that went into action in the Protector twenty-five were\r\nkilled or drowned, and twenty-nine wounded, some mortally. Of the\r\nAccomac volunteers Captain Christian was killed with a musket ball.\r\nCaptain William Snead, Mr. John Reville, and Colonel Cropper, were\r\nwounded. Among those thrown into the water by the explosion was William\r\nGibb, a Scotchman, for many years deputy clerk of Accomac. He could not\r\nswim, and was sinking when his friend, Captain Parker, seized him by the\r\nhair, and kept him afloat until they both were picked up by the enemy.\r\nAs long as Gibb lived, which was forty-five years thereafter, he had an\r\nannual feast at his house on the thirtieth of November, the anniversary\r\nof the Battle of the Barges.[741:A]\r\n\r\nColonel Cropper at the age of nineteen was captain of the 9th Virginia\r\nRegiment in the continental line: and in 1776 was made major in the 5th\r\nRegiment.[741:B] He was with Washington in the Jerseys, and present at\r\nthe battles of Monmouth and Brandywine. For his good conduct in the\r\nlatter he was promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[739:A] Such is the account given by Commodore Barron from his early\r\nrecollections. It appears, however, that he and his companions were\r\nmisled by appearances, and that the Patriot was engaged with the British\r\nsloop for two hours, and twice attempted to board her, but\r\nineffectually. At length the sloop cut away the Patriot's main\r\nhalliards, and her main-sail fell to the deck; when, receiving a\r\nbroadside, and being no longer manageable, the Patriot struck her\r\ncolors.--[_Va.

So the eagle\r\nfrom his mountain watch-tower looks down and surveys with serene eye the\r\ntempest and the storm forming beneath his feet. Re-enforced by the\r\nFrench troops under Rochambeau, and a fleet, he was concerting measures\r\nto expel Clinton from New York, believing that in this way he could give\r\nthe enemy the more fatal blow, and afford the South the more effectual\r\nrelief. But he resolved, in case he should find this design\r\nimpracticable, to transfer the scene of war to the South. Cornwallis was\r\nadvised by Sir Henry to select a post on the Chesapeake, convenient for\r\nwintering a fleet--either Yorktown or Old Point. Washington requested La\r\nFayette to endeavor to prevent Cornwallis from marching to Charleston,\r\nand Wayne was, accordingly, despatched to the south side of the James to\r\nwatch his movements.[742:A] Cornwallis having selected Yorktown,\r\noccupied it and Gloucester Point, on the opposite side of the York, and\r\nproceeded to fortify them.\r\n\r\nEarly in August, Washington received from the Count de Barras the\r\ninformation that the Count de Grasse might be expected shortly to reach\r\nthe Chesapeake with a formidable fleet. Washington now determined to\r\ntransfer the war to the South; but to deceive Clinton he made his\r\narrangements secretly, and continued his apparent preparations against\r\nNew York. Cornwallis concentrated the whole British force in Virginia at\r\nYorktown and Gloucester Point by the twenty-second of August. The latter\r\npost was held by the 80th Regiment, the Hessian regiment of the Prince\r\nHereditaire, and the Queen's Rangers--the whole under command of the\r\nbrave and energetic Colonel Dundas, of the artillery. Tarleton, with his\r\ncavalry, afterwards passed over to Gloucester Point. La Fayette, in\r\nconsequence of the movements of the enemy, broke up his camp on the\r\nPamunkey, and drew nearer to Yorktown. Washington, having concerted with\r\nthe French commanders a plan of operations, with the combined American\r\nand French forces, marched for Virginia, the army being put in motion on\r\nthe nineteenth, and having completed the passage of the Hudson on the\r\ntwenty-fifth. Sir Henry Clinton did not suspect that the movement was\r\nfor the South until the third of September.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of August, De Grasse, with twenty-eight ships of the\r\nline and several frigates, arrived from the West Indies, and entered the\r\nChesapeake. At Cape Henry he found an officer despatched by La Fayette\r\nwith intelligence of the situation of the two armies. On the following\r\nday his advanced ships blocked up the mouth of the York. While the\r\nFrench fleet lay at anchor just within the Chesapeake, a squadron was\r\ndescried early in the morning of September the fifth, consisting of\r\nnineteen ships-of-the-line, under Admiral Graves. De Grasse immediately\r\nformed his line and put to sea; and a partial engagement occurred.\r\nSeveral ships were damaged, but the result was indecisive. For some days\r\nthe fleets continued within view of each other, after which De Grasse\r\nreturned to his moorings within the capes. Here he found[743:A] De\r\nBarras with a squadron newly arrived from Rhode Island, bringing\r\nartillery and stores proper for carrying on a siege. Graves looking in\r\nat the capes found the French fleet too strong for him, and returned to\r\nNew York. La Fayette made his headquarters at Williamsburg, twelve miles\r\nfrom Yorktown.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of September, 1781, the battle of Eutaw Springs, in South\r\nCarolina, took place. The British army, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nStuart, being encamped at that place, Greene marched at four o'clock in\r\nthe morning, to attack the enemy, seven miles distant. Upon approaching\r\nthem Greene formed his first line of militia under Marion and Pickens.\r\nThe second was composed of continental infantry and the North Carolina\r\nBrigade, commanded by General Sumner, on the right; the Virginians,\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, in the centre; the Marylanders, under\r\nColonel Williams, on the left. Lee's legion covered the right flank;\r\nSouth Carolinians, under Colonel Henderson, the left; and Washington's\r\ncavalry, with Kirkwood's infantry, formed the reserve. Captain Gaines,\r\nwith two three-pounders, was attached to the first line, and Captain\r\nBrown, with two sixes, to the second.\r\n\r\nThe British were drawn up across the road obliquely,--in a wood, on the\r\nheights near the Eutaw Springs, having their right flank on Eutaw Creek.\r\nThe flanks were protected by infantry and cavalry; and a body of\r\ninfantry was held in reserve. The British advanced party was soon driven\r\nin. The militia, after maintaining themselves firmly for awhile, were\r\ncompelled to retire before the advancing enemy, and their place was\r\nfilled by Sumner's North Carolina Brigade, which, supported by Lee and\r\nHenderson on the flanks, went into action with great intrepidity. The\r\nBritish fell back to their first ground. Henderson was disabled by a\r\nwound. At Sumner's brigade giving way the British rushed forward in some\r\ndisorder. Greene directed Williams and Campbell to charge with the\r\nbayonet, and Washington to bring up the reserve. Williams charged\r\nwithout firing a musket; but Campbell's regiment, chiefly new levies,\r\nreturned the enemy's fire as they advanced. Lee now ordered Captain\r\nRudolph, of the legion infantry, to turn the enemy's flank, and give\r\nthem a raking fire. This being done, the British left was broken, and,\r\ndriven off the field retreated through their tented camp toward Eutaw\r\nCreek, where was a brick house, into which a part of them threw\r\nthemselves. The Americans pursuing closely, took three hundred prisoners\r\nand two pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nWashington charging the enemy's right with his cavalry suffered a heavy\r\nloss. He himself had his horse killed, and was wounded and made\r\nprisoner. The enemy now rallied, and Greene, finding it impossible to\r\ndislodge them, retired. It was an extremely hard-fought battle. The loss\r\nof the Americans was five hundred and fifty-five, including sixty\r\nofficers. One hundred and thirty were killed. Seventeen officers were\r\nkilled, and four mortally wounded. Among the slain was Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nCampbell, who fell while leading the Virginia Brigade on to the charge.\r\nThis excellent officer, on being told just before he expired, that the\r\nAmericans were victorious, exclaimed, \"Then I die contented.\" The loss\r\nof the British was six hundred and ninety-three, of whom eighty-five\r\nwere killed on the field. Greene made five hundred prisoners. The\r\ncombatants were about equal in number, and the question of victory was\r\nleft undecided. Greene was, as a military leader, esteemed as second\r\nonly to General Washington.\r\n\r\nHenry Lee was born in Westmoreland, Virginia, on the 29th of January,\r\n1756, being son of Colonel Henry Lee[745:A] and Mary Bland, of Jordans.\r\nHenry receiving his early education from a private tutor at home,\r\nafterwards pursued his studies at the College of New Jersey, under the\r\npresidency of Dr. Witherspoon, and graduated there in 1774, in his\r\neighteenth year. While in college, Dr. Shippen predicted his future\r\ndistinction. In 1776, when twenty years of age, on the nomination of\r\nPatrick Henry, he was appointed a captain in Colonel Bland's regiment of\r\ncavalry. In September of the following year the regiment joined the main\r\narmy, where Lee, by his discipline, vigilance, and efficiency, soon won\r\nthe confidence of Washington, who selected him and his company for a\r\nbody-guard at the battle of Germantown. While Lee lay near the British\r\nlines, a numerous body of cavalry surprised him in his quarters, a stone\r\nhouse, where he had with him but ten men. Yet with these he made a\r\ngallant defence, and obliged the enemy to retreat, after having lost\r\nfour men killed, together with several horses, and an officer with three\r\nprivates wounded. Of his own party, besides the patrols and\r\nquartermaster-sergeant, who were made prisoners out of the house, he had\r\nbut two wounded. Washington complimented Lee on his gallantry in this\r\nlittle affair, and congress shortly after promoted him to the rank of\r\nmajor with the command of an independent partisan corps of horse. July\r\n19th, 1779, he surprised the British garrison at Paulus Hook, and was\r\nrewarded by congress with a gold medal. Early in 1780 Lee, now\r\nlieutenant-colonel, with his legion, consisting of cavalry and infantry,\r\njoined the army of the South, under General Greene. In his retreat\r\nbefore Cornwallis, Lee's legion formed part of the rear-guard of the\r\nAmerican army. During the retreat, Lee charged successfully upon\r\nTarleton's dragoons. After Greene had effected his escape, he detached\r\nLee, with Pickens, to watch the movements of Cornwallis. Lee, with his\r\nlegion, by a stratagem surprised four hundred armed loyalists under\r\nColonel Pyle, of whom ninety were killed and many wounded.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Guilford Lee's legion distinguished itself. When\r\nCornwallis retired to Wilmington, it was by Lee's advice that Greene\r\nmoved at once into South Carolina. Lee, detached with his legion, joined\r\nthe militia under Marion. Several forts speedily surrendered. Lee now\r\njoined Pickens, for the purpose of attacking Fort Augusta, which was\r\nreduced. In the unfortunate assault upon Fort Ninety-Six, Lee was\r\nentirely successful in the part of the attack intrusted to his care. At\r\nthe battle of the Eutaw Springs he bore a distinguished part; and\r\nGeneral Greene declared that his services had been greater than those of\r\nany other man attached to the Southern army. As a partisan officer he\r\nwas unsurpassed. He was a soldier, an orator, and a writer; and in his\r\nMemoirs has given a graphic picture of the war in the South. He was\r\nabout five feet nine inches high, well proportioned, of an open,\r\npleasant countenance, and of a dark complexion. His manners were frank\r\nand engaging, his disposition generous and hospitable. He was twice\r\nmarried: first to Matilda, daughter of Philip Ludwell Lee, by whom he\r\nhad a son, Henry, and a daughter, Lucy; and afterwards to Ann, daughter\r\nof Charles Carter, of Shirley, by whom he had three sons, Charles\r\nCarter, Robert, and Smith, and two daughters, Ann and Mildred. General\r\nHenry Lee resided at Stratford. His statue is to be placed on the\r\nRichmond Monument. Among the officers of Lee's legion were Armstrong,\r\nRudolph, Eggleston, and Carrington.\r\n\r\nWashington, accompanied by Rochambeau and the Marquis De Chastellux,\r\nreaching Yorktown on the fourteenth of September, and repairing on board\r\nthe Ville de Paris, the admiral's ship, arranged the plan of the siege.\r\nBy the twenty-fifth, the combined army, amounting to twelve thousand\r\nmen, together with five thousand militia under General Nelson, was\r\nconcentrated at Williamsburg. The allies advanced upon York and invested\r\nit, the Americans forming the right below the town, the French the left\r\nabove it, and each extending from the borders of the river, so as to\r\ncompletely circumvent the town. General De Choisy invested Gloucester\r\nPoint with three thousand men. The enemy's communication by water was\r\nentirely cut off by ships stationed at the mouth of the river, some ten\r\nmiles below Yorktown. Cornwallis, some time before this, finding his\r\nsituation growing so critical, had anxiously solicited aid from Sir\r\nHenry Clinton; and it was promised, but never arrived. Washington was\r\nassisted during the siege by Lincoln, Steuben, La Fayette, Knox, and\r\nothers. The French were commanded by General the Count De Rochambeau. On\r\nthe twenty-ninth the British commenced a cannonade, and during the night\r\nabandoned some redoubts, and retired within the town. Colonel Scammel,\r\nwhile reconnoitring the ground just abandoned by the enemy, was\r\nsurprised by a party of horse, and, after he had surrendered, received a\r\nwound from a Hessian, of which he died in a few days, greatly lamented.\r\nOn the third of October, in a skirmish before Gloucester Point, Tarleton\r\nwas unhorsed, and narrowly escaped being made prisoner. The British sent\r\nout from Yorktown a large number of negroes infected with the small-pox.\r\nOn the night of the seventh the first parallel was extended two miles in\r\nlength, and within six hundred yards of the British lines. By the\r\nevening of the ninth, several batteries being completed, Washington\r\nhimself put the match to the first gun, and a heavy fire was opened, and\r\nthe cannonade continued till the fifteenth. Cornwallis was driven from\r\nSecretary Nelson's house.\r\n\r\nUpon the breaking out of the Revolution, the Secretary had retired from\r\npublic affairs. He lived at Yorktown, where he had erected a handsome\r\nhouse. Cornwallis made his headquarters in this house, which stood near\r\nthe defensive works. It soon attracted the attention of the French\r\nartillery, and was almost entirely demolished. Secretary Nelson was in\r\nit when the first shot killed one of his negroes at a little distance\r\nfrom him. What increased his solicitude was that he had two sons in the\r\nAmerican army; so that every shot, whether fired from the town or from\r\nthe trenches, might prove equally fatal to him. When a flag was sent in\r\nto request that he might be conveyed within the American lines, one of\r\nhis sons was observed gazing wistfully at the gate of the town by which\r\nhis father, then disabled by the gout, was to come out. Cornwallis\r\npermitted his withdrawal, and he was taken to Washington's headquarters.\r\nUpon alighting, with a serene countenance he related to the officers who\r\nstood around him what had been the effect of their batteries, and how\r\nmuch his mansion had suffered from the first shot. A red-hot ball from a\r\nFrench battery set fire to the Charon, a British forty-four gun-ship,\r\nand two or three smaller vessels, which were consumed in the night. They\r\nwere enrobed in fire, which ran like lightning over the rigging and to\r\nthe tops of the masts. A second parallel was completed, and batteries\r\nerected within three hundred yards of the enemy's works. The British had\r\ntwo redoubts about three hundred yards in front of their lines, and it\r\nwas resolved to take them by assault. The one on the left of the enemy\r\nbordering the banks of the river was assigned to a brigade of light\r\ninfantry under La Fayette, the advanced corps being conducted by Colonel\r\nAlexander Hamilton, assisted by Colonel Gimat. The attack commenced at\r\neight o'clock in the evening, and the assailants entered the fort with\r\nthe point of the bayonet, without firing a gun. The American loss was\r\neight killed and thirty wounded. Major Campbell, who commanded the\r\nredoubt, was wounded and made prisoner, with about thirty soldiers; the\r\nrest escaped. During the assault, the British kept up a fire along their\r\nwhole line. Washington, Lincoln, and Knox, having dismounted, stood in\r\nan exposed position awaiting the result. The other redoubt, on the right\r\nof the British, was taken at the same time by a detachment of the French\r\ncommanded by Baron De Viomenil. He lost about one hundred men killed and\r\nwounded. Of the enemy at this redoubt eighteen were killed and\r\nforty-five captured, including three officers.\r\n\r\nBy this time many of the British guns were silenced, and their works\r\nwere becoming ruinous. About four o'clock in the morning of the\r\nsixteenth, Colonel Abercrombie, with four hundred men, made a sortie\r\nagainst two unfinished redoubts occupied by the French; the British,\r\nafter spiking some cannon, were driven back, with a small loss on each\r\nside. One hundred pieces of heavy artillery were now in full play\r\nagainst the enemy, and he had nearly ceased firing. In this extremity,\r\nLord Cornwallis formed a desperate design of attempting to force his way\r\nto New York, his plan being to leave his sick and baggage behind, to\r\ncross over the York River in the night to Gloucester Point with his\r\neffective force, and, overwhelming De Choisy there, his lordship\r\nintended to mount his men on captured horses, and, by forced marches,\r\ngain the fords of the rivers, and thus make his way through Maryland,\r\nPennsylvania, and Jersey, to New York. Boats were in readiness under\r\nother pretexts, at ten o'clock of the night of the sixteenth, and the\r\narrangements were conducted with so much secrecy that the first division\r\narrived at Gloucester Point unperceived, and part of the troops were\r\nlanded, when a violent storm drove the boats down the river, and it was\r\nnot till daylight that they returned to York town. The plan being\r\nfrustrated, the boats were sent to bring back the soldiers, and they\r\nwere relanded on the south side during the forenoon. At about ten\r\no'clock in the forenoon of the seventeenth, the British beat a parley,\r\nand by a flag requested a cessation of hostilities for twenty-four\r\nhours, to settle terms for the surrender of the posts. Washington\r\ngranted a suspension of hostilities for two hours for the reception of\r\nhis lordship's proposals in writing. These having been received, the\r\nsuspension was prolonged. The commissioners for adjusting the terms of\r\nthe capitulation were the Viscount De Noailles and Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nLaurens, in behalf of the allies; and Colonel Dundas and Major Ross, in\r\nbehalf of the British. The place of meeting was Moore's House, at Temple\r\nFarm, in the rear of the first parallel. A rough draft of the articles\r\nof capitulation was made on the eighteenth, to be submitted to the\r\nrespective generals. Washington sent a fair transcript of the articles\r\nto Lord Cornwallis early on the morning of the nineteenth, together with\r\na letter restricting the interval allowed for signing the capitulation\r\nto eleven o'clock, and that for the actual surrender to two o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon of that day. His lordship acquiesced, and on the 19th of\r\nOctober, 1781, the British army surrendered. At about twelve o'clock the\r\ncombined army was drawn up along a road in two lines, about twenty\r\nyards apart, and extending more than a mile, the Americans on the\r\nright, the French on the left. At the head of the American line\r\nWashington appeared on horseback, surrounded by his aids and the\r\nAmerican staff; at the head of the French line and opposite to\r\nWashington was posted Count Rochambeau, surrounded in the same way. At\r\ntwo o'clock the captive army advanced between the allied lines in\r\ncolumn, slowly, and in exact order. Profound silence reigned during this\r\nscene,[750:A] which recalled to mind the awful vicissitudes of human\r\nfortune, awoke commiseration for the captives, and suggested the\r\nconsequences of this great event. Lord Cornwallis, under the pretext of\r\nindisposition, declined being present, and his place was filled by\r\nGeneral O'Hara. This gallant officer, mounted on a fine charger, upon\r\nreaching the head of the line, mistook Count Rochambeau, on his left,\r\nfor the commander-in-chief; but quickly discovering his error, flew\r\nacross the road to Washington, asked pardon for his mistake, apologized\r\nfor the absence of Lord Cornwallis, and begged to know his further\r\npleasure. Washington courteously referred him to General Lincoln, who\r\nhad been compelled to surrender at Charleston, for his guidance.\r\nReturning to the head of the column, it moved under the guidance of\r\nLincoln to the field selected for laying down the arms. The men\r\nmanifested their embittered feelings, and Colonel Abercrombie was\r\nobserved to hide his face when his men threw down their muskets.\r\n\r\nThe post at Gloucester Point was surrendered about the same time. The\r\ncommand of the British there had recently been assumed by Tarleton,\r\nDundas being required to be present on the south side of the river.\r\nTarleton, before the surrender, waited on General De Choisy, and made\r\nknown to him the apprehensions which he entertained for his personal\r\nsafety, in case he should fall into the hands of the American militia,\r\nand requested his protection. The danger was imaginary; and the general\r\nreadily agreed to ensure his safety. Tarleton surrendered his force to\r\nthe legion of the Duke De Lauzun and Mercer's corps, the residue of the\r\nallied detachment not even being present to witness the spectacle. The\r\nnumber of prisoners surrendered at the two posts was upwards of seven\r\nthousand, who, with the artillery, arms, military chest, and stores,\r\nwere given up to Washington, the ships and seamen to Count De Grasse.\r\nThe loss sustained by the garrison during the siege of eleven days\r\namounted to five hundred and fifty-two, including six officers. The\r\nallied force amounted to sixteen thousand men, being, continentals five\r\nthousand five hundred, French seven thousand, militia three thousand\r\nfive hundred. Loss in killed and wounded during the siege, about three\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nIn the adjustment of the articles of capitulation, Cornwallis had\r\ninsisted strenuously upon two points: first, that the prisoners of war\r\nshould be allowed to return to Europe, upon condition of not serving\r\nagainst the United States or France, until exchanged; second, security\r\nfor American citizens who had joined the British armies. Both were\r\nrejected; but the latter was virtually admitted, by permitting his\r\nlordship to send away the Bonetta with despatches to Sir Henry Clinton,\r\nfree from search. In this way his lordship conveyed away the most\r\nobnoxious loyalists securely to New York; but Lord Cornwallis, in\r\nsoliciting this favor, pledged himself that no officer should go in this\r\nway without Washington's consent. In his orders of the twentieth, the\r\ncommander-in-chief congratulated the army on this glorious event, and\r\ndeclared that it was owing to the assistance of the French allies. He\r\nreturned his profound acknowledgments to them, mentioning with special\r\nhonor Count De Rochambeau, the Baron De Viomenil, the Chevalier De\r\nChastellux, the Marquis De St. Simon, the Count De Viomenil, and General\r\nDe Choisy. The gallant French troops shared in the applause bestowed on\r\nthe whole army. Generals Lincoln, La Fayette, Steuben, and Knox,\r\ntogether with Colonels Carney, and D'Abbeville, received the highest\r\npraise. The services of the gallant and patriotic General Nelson,\r\ncommander of the militia, were recognized with no less distinction. A\r\ngeneral amnesty was granted; and all belonging to the army that were\r\nunder arrest were pardoned and restored to the ranks, that they might\r\nparticipate in the universal joy. Washington concluded the order in\r\nthese words: \"Divine service shall be performed to-morrow in the\r\ndifferent brigades and divisions. The commander-in-chief recommends to\r\nall the troops that are not upon duty to assist at it with a serious\r\ndeportment and that sensibility of heart which the recollection of the\r\nsurprising and particular interposition of Providence in our favor\r\nclaims.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry Clinton, with a fleet of twenty-five ships-of-the-line, two\r\nfifty gun-ships, and eight frigates, commanded by Admiral Digby, and\r\nhaving on board seven thousand chosen troops, appeared off the capes of\r\nVirginia on the twenty-fourth--they having sailed from Sandy Hook on the\r\nvery day of the surrender. Sir Henry finding that he had arrived too\r\nlate, set sail on the twenty-ninth, from the mouth of the Chesapeake,\r\nand returned to New York.\r\n\r\nAs the drama of the Revolution was opened in Virginia by Henry, so it\r\nwas now virtually terminated here by Washington and his companions in\r\narms. With this glorious event closes this history of the Colony and\r\nAncient Dominion of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[742:A] August 2d, 1781.\r\n\r\n[743:A] September tenth.\r\n\r\n[745:A] For many years a member of the house of burgesses.\r\n\r\n[750:A] Lee's Memoirs, 370.
