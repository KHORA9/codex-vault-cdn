It was\r\nin all sincerity that in June, 1726, she wrote to her sister, Lady Mar:\r\n\"The last pleasures that fell in my way was Madame Sévigné's letters:\r\nvery pretty they are, but I assert, without the least vanity, that mine\r\nwill be full as entertaining forty years hence. I advise you, therefore,\r\nto put none of them to the use of waste paper.\" And again, later in the\r\nyear, she said half-humorously to the same correspondent: \"I writ to you\r\nsome time ago a long letter, which I perceive never came to your hands:\r\nvery provoking; it was certainly a _chef d'oeuvre_ of a letter, and\r\nworthy any of the Sévigné's or Grignan's, crammed with news.\" That Lady\r\nMary's belief in herself was well founded no one has disputed. Even\r\nHorace Walpole, who detested her and made attacks on her whenever\r\npossible, said that \"in most of her letters the wit and style are\r\nsuperior to any letters I have ever read but Madame de Sévigné's.\" A\r\nvery pleasant tribute from one who had a goodly conceit of himself as a\r\nletter-writer.\r\n\r\nWalpole, as a correspondent, was perhaps more sarcastic and more witty;\r\nCowper undoubtedly more tender and more gentle; but Lady Mary had\r\nqualities all her own. She had powers of observation and the gift of\r\ndescription, which qualities are especially to be remarked in the\r\nletters she wrote when abroad with her husband on his Mission to the\r\nPorte. She had an ironic wit which gave point to the many society\r\nscandals she narrated, a happy knack of gossip, and a style so easy as\r\nto make reading a pleasure.\r\n\r\nSome of the incidents which Lady Mary retails with so much humour may be\r\naccepted as not outraging the conventions of the early eighteenth\r\ncentury when it was customary to call a spade a spade; when gallantry\r\nwas gallantry indeed, and the pursuit of it openly conducted. What is\r\nnot mentioned by those who have written about her is that she was\r\npossessed of a particularly unsavoury strain of impropriety which\r\noutraged even the canons of her age. Some twenty years after her death,\r\nit was mentioned in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ that Dr. Young, the\r\nauthor of _Night Thoughts_, had a little before his death destroyed a\r\ngreat number of her letters, assigning as a reason of his doing so that\r\nthey were too indecent for public inspection. Only the other day I had\r\nconfirmation of this from a distinguished man of letters who wrote to\r\nme: \"I have somewhere hidden away a copy of a letter by Lady Mary\r\nWortley Montagu, which was sent to me by a well-known collector about\r\nthirty-five years ago, because he couldn't destroy it and wouldn't for\r\nworlds be found dead with it in his possession--so terrific is it in\r\ncharacter. I'll tell you about it some day when we meet: I can't write\r\nit. In any case you couldn't use it or even refer to it.... I suppose\r\nthat my friend quite felt that the document, however objectionable,\r\nshould not, on literary grounds, be destroyed. What my executors will\r\nthink of me for having it in my possession, the Devil only knows.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this strain permeated the diary which Lady Mary left behind her\r\nwhen she eloped in 1712, and which was destroyed by one of her sisters,\r\nno one can say; but it is a curious fact that the diary she kept in\r\nlater years was destroyed by her devoted daughter, Lady Bute. \"Though\r\nLady Bute always spoke of Lady Mary with great respect,\" wrote Lady\r\nLouisa Stuart, \"yet it might be perceived that she knew it had been too\r\nmuch her custom to note down and enlarge upon all the scandalous rumours\r\nof the day, without weighing their truth or even their probability; to\r\nrecord as certain facts stories that perhaps sprang up like mushrooms\r\nfrom the dirt, and had as brief an existence, but tended to defame\r\npersons of the most spotless character. In this age, she said everything\r\ngot into print sooner or later; the name of Lady Mary Wortley would be\r\nsure to attract curiosity; and were such details ever made public, they\r\nwould neither edify the world, nor do honour to her memory.\"\r\n\r\nLady Bute heard that her mother's letters were in existence, and,\r\nfearful of what they might contain, purchased them. \"It is known that\r\nwhen on her way to die, as it proved, in her own country, Lady Mary gave\r\na copy of the letters to Mr. Snowden, minister of the English church at\r\nRotterdam, attesting the gift by her signature,\" Lady Louisa Stuart has\r\nwritten. \"This showed it was her wish that they should eventually be\r\npublished; but Lady Bute, hearing only that a number of her mother's\r\nletters were in a stranger's hands, and having no certainty what they\r\nmight be, to whom addressed, or how little of a private matter, could\r\nnot but earnestly desire to obtain them, and readily paid the price\r\ndemanded--five hundred pounds. In a few months she saw them appear in\r\nprint. Such was the fact, and how it came about nobody at this time of\r\nday need either care or inquire.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to other correspondence of Lady Mary, Sir Robert Walpole\r\nreturned to her the letters she had written to his second wife, Molly\r\nSkerritt, after the death of that lady; and when Lord Hervey died, his\r\neldest son sealed up and sent her her letters, with an assurance that he\r\nhad read none of them. To Lord Hervey's heir, Lady Louisa Stuart has\r\nmentioned, Lady Mary wrote a letter of thanks for his honourable\r\nconduct, adding that she could almost regret he had not glanced his eye\r\nover a correspondence which would have shown him what so young a man\r\nmight perhaps be inclined to doubt--the possibility of a long and steady\r\nfriendship subsisting between two persons of different sexes without the\r\nleast mixture of love. Much pleased with this letter, he preserved it;\r\nand, when Lady Mary came to England, showed it to Lady Bute desiring\r\nshe would ask leave for him to visit her mother.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that Lady Mary, or her daughter, Lady Bute,\r\ndestroyed these collections. For her part, Lady Mary returned letters\r\nthat she had received from Lord Hervey, but only those that belonged to\r\nthe last fourteen years of an acquaintance that had endured twice so\r\nlong. These are for the greater number platonic in character, although\r\nthere are a few phrases of a freer kind. Croker, who edited Lord\r\nHervey's _Memoirs_, mentions that Hervey, answering one of her letters\r\nin 1737, in which she had complained that she was too old to inspire\r\npassion, after paying a compliment to her charms more gallant than\r\ndecorous, said: \"I should think anybody a great fool that said he liked\r\nspring better than summer merely because it is further from autumn, or\r\nthat they loved green fruit better than ripe only because it was further\r\nfrom being rotten. I ever did, and believe ever shall, like women best--\r\n\r\n  \"Just in the noon of life--those golden days,\r\n   When the mind ripens as the form decays.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary was then in her forty-ninth year, being six years Hervey's\r\nsenior.\r\n\r\nLady Louisa Stuart, writing in 1837--that is, seventy-five years after\r\nthe death of her grandmother, Lady Mary--wrote indignantly of the\r\nattacks that had been made upon her ancestress. \"The multitude of\r\nstories circulated about her--as about all people who were objects of\r\nnote in their day--increase, instead of lessening, the difficulty,\" she\r\nsaid. \"Some of these may be confidently pronounced inventions, simple\r\nand purely false; some, if true, concerned a different person; some were\r\ngrounded upon egregious blunders; and not a few upon jests, mistaken by\r\nthe dull and literal for earnest. Others, again, where a little truth\r\nand a great deal of falsehood were probably intermingled, nobody now\r\nliving can pretend to confirm, or contradict, or unravel. Nothing is so\r\nreadily believed, yet nothing is usually so unworthy of credit, as tales\r\nlearned from report, or caught up in casual conversation. A circumstance\r\ncarelessly told, carelessly listened to, half comprehended, and\r\nimperfectly remembered, has a poor chance of being repeated accurately\r\nby the first hearer; but when, after passing through the moulding of\r\ncountless hands, it comes, with time, place, and person, gloriously\r\nconfounded, into those of a bookmaker ignorant of all its bearings, it\r\nwill be lucky indeed if any trace of the original groundwork remains\r\ndistinguishable.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary's most redoubtable assailants were Pope and Horace Walpole,\r\nand both were biassed. The story of Pope's quarrel with her is told in\r\nthe following pages. Walpole, it has been suggested, disliked her much\r\nbecause she had championed his father's mistress, Molly Skerritt,\r\nagainst the mother to whom he was devoted. Pope, of course, knew her\r\nwell; but Walpole, who was twenty-eight years her junior, only met her\r\nin her late middle age. Walpole's prejudice was so great what when Lady\r\nMary said, \"People wish their enemies dead--but I do not. I say, give\r\nthem the gout, give them the stone,\" he reported it solemnly.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is not to be assumed that Lady Mary had not her full share\r\nof malice--she was undoubtedly well equipped with that useful\r\nquality--and she did not turn the other cheek when she was assailed. She\r\ncould even stand up to the vitriolic Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and\r\nstand up so effectively that they tacitly agreed to an armed neutrality\r\nthat verged perilously upon friendship. The young Duke of Wharton\r\nsometimes beat her in open fight, but she harboured no very angry\r\nfeelings towards him. As regards Pope, if it was not tit-for-tat with\r\nhim, at least she gave him hard knocks. Pope, great poet as he was,\r\nnever played fair in war.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Mary, quite contrary,\" she might have been dubbed, for she was\r\nfrequently in trouble. The Rémond scandal, that will presently be\r\nunfolded, was a thing apart; but her witty tongue made her many enemies\r\nand cost her many friends. Had the contents of her letters about London\r\nsociety become known at the time, nearly every man's and all women's\r\nhands would have been against her. She had, in fact, little that was\r\nkind to say about people; when she had, she usually refrained from\r\nmentioning it.\r\n\r\nIn this work Lady Mary's letters, either whole or in part, are given\r\nonly in so far as they have biographical or historical value. At the\r\nsame time I have, wherever possible, allowed Lady Mary to tell her\r\nstory, or to give her impressions, in her own words. The quotations have\r\nbeen taken, by kind permission of Messrs. J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd., from\r\nthe edition of the letters in their \"Everyman Library\" (edited by Mr.\r\nErnest Rhys), with an introduction by Mr. R. Brimley Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the letters appeared in three volumes in 1763,\r\nbelieved to have been edited by John Cleland. A fourth volume, issued in\r\n1763, is regarded by Sir Leslie Stephen as of doubtful authenticity.\r\nJames Dallaway, in 1803, brought out an enlarged collection and added to\r\nit the poems, and a second edition, with some new letters, appeared\r\nfourteen years later. Lady Mary's great-grandson, Lord Wharncliffe,\r\nedited the correspondence in 1837, and this, revised by Mr. Moy Thomas,\r\nwas reprinted in 1861 and again in 1887.\r\n\r\nThere have been published selections from the correspondence by Mr. A.R.\r\nRopes (1892) and by Mr. Hannaford Bennett (1923).\r\n\r\nThe principal authorities for the life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu are\r\nthe Memoirs of James Dallaway prefixed to an edition of the _Works_\r\n(1803) and the _Introductory Anecdotes_ in a new edition (1837) by Lady\r\nLouisa Stuart, the daughter of Lady Bute and the granddaughter of Lady\r\nMary. There is another account of Lady Mary by the late Moy Thomas in\r\nrevised editions of the letters and writings (1861 and 1887). Sir Leslie\r\nStephen was responsible for the memoir in the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_. In 1907 appeared _Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and her Times_,\r\nby that sound authority on the eighteenth century, \"George Paston,\" who\r\nwas so fortunate as to discover many scores of letters hitherto\r\nunpublished.\r\n\r\nOther sources of information are to be found in Pope's Correspondence,\r\nSpence's _Anecdotes_, Dilke's _Papers of a Critic,_ Cobbetts _Memorials\r\nof Twickenham_, the Stuart MSS. at Windsor Castle, the MSS. of the Duke\r\nof Beaufort, and the Lindsay MSS.\r\n\r\nMy thanks--though not, perhaps, the thanks of my readers--are especially\r\ndue to that ripe scholar Mr. Hannaford Bennett, who suggested this work\r\nto me. I am indebted to Mr. M.H. Spielmann and other friends and\r\ncorrespondents for information and suggestions. Finally, I must\r\nacknowledge the valuable assistance of Mrs. E. Constance Monfrino in the\r\npreparation of this biography.\r\n\r\nLEWIS MELVILLE.\r\n\r\n_London,\r\nMarch, 1925_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD (1689-1703)\r\n\r\nBirth of Mary Pierrepont, after Lady Mary Wortley Montagu--Account of\r\nthe Pierrepont family--Lady Mary's immediate ancestors--Her father,\r\nEvelyn Pierrepont, succeeds to the Earldom of Kingston in 1790--The\r\nextinct marquisate of Dorchester revived in his favour--His\r\nmarriage--Issue of the marriage--Death of his wife--Lady Mary stays with\r\nher grandmother, Mrs. Elizabeth Pierrepont--Her early taste for\r\nreading--She learns Latin, and, presently, Italian--Encouraged in her\r\nliterary ambitions by her uncle, William Feilding, and Bishop\r\nBurnet--Submits to the Bishop a translation of \"Encheiridion\" of\r\nEpictetus--An attractive child--A \"toast\" at the Kit-Cat Club--Acts as\r\nhostess to her father\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGIRLHOOD (1703-1710)\r\n\r\nLady Mary makes the acquaintance of Edward Wortley Montagu--Montagu\r\nattracted by her looks and her literary gifts.

Wortley Montagu, was born in May,\r\n1689, and was baptised on the twenty-sixth day of that month at St.\r\nPaul's, Covent Garden. In the register is the entry: \"Mary, daughter of\r\nEvelyn Pierrepoint, Esquire, and Lady Mary, his wife.\"\r\n\r\nThe event, it may be remarked, was not one of any considerable social\r\ninterest, for the Hon. Evelyn Pierrepont was merely a younger son and\r\nremote from the succession to the Earldom of Kingston.\r\n\r\nThe Pierreponts of Holme Pierrepont were a Nottinghamshire family of\r\nconsiderable antiquity, though of no particular distinction. One Robert\r\nPierrepont, who was born in 1584, the son of Sir Henry by Frances,\r\nsister of William, first Earl of Devonshire, was the first of the family\r\nupon whom a peerage was bestowed. He was created in 1627 Baron\r\nPierrepont of Holme Pierrepont and Viscount Newark, and in the following\r\nyear was elevated to the dignity of Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull, Co.\r\nYork. A zealous royalist, he was in 1643 appointed Lieutenant-General of\r\nthe King's forces in the counties of Lincoln, Rutland, Huntingdon,\r\nCambridge, and Norfolk, and soon after taking up this command was\r\naccidentally shot near Gainsborough, when being carried off in a pinnace\r\nas a prisoner to Hull by the Parliamentary Army. He married in 1601\r\nGertrude, eldest daughter and co-heir of Sir William Reyner, of Orton\r\nLongueville, Co. Huntingdon. She survived her husband six years.\r\n\r\nThe second Earl was Henry Pierrepont, who was born in 1607. From 1628,\r\nwhen his father was given the earldom, he was known under the style of\r\nViscount Newark. In that year he was elected Member of Parliament for\r\nNottingham, and he represented that constituency until 1641, when he was\r\nsummoned to the House of Lords in his father's barony as Lord\r\nPierrepont. He, too, was an ardent supporter of the King, and was a\r\nmember of His Majesty's Council of War at Oxford. He was created\r\nMarquess of Dorchester in 1645. After the Restoration he was in high\r\nfavour at Whitehall. He was Commissioner of Claims at the Coronation of\r\nCharles II, and in 1662 and again in 1673 he acted as Joint Commissioner\r\nof the office of Earl Marshal. He was twice married, but had no direct\r\nheirs, and on his death in 1680 the marquessate became extinct.\r\n\r\nThe earldom passed to the family of the younger brother of the last\r\nholder. This was the great grandfather of Lady Mary, William Pierrepont,\r\nwho deservedly earned the title of \"Wise William.\" He sided with the\r\nParliament, and during the Long Parliament, in the proceedings of which\r\nhe took an active part, he sat for Great Wenlock. He was one of the\r\nCommissioners selected to treat with Charles in 1642, and after the\r\nfailure to open negotiations he was anxious to retire from public\r\naffairs. However, he was persuaded not to resign, and in 1644 was\r\nappointed one of the Committee of both Kingdoms. He became a leader of\r\nthe independent party, and did not always see eye to eye with Cromwell.\r\nHe quarrelled with his party, disapproving of its attitude towards\r\nPurge's Pride and the trial of the King. After this he took little part\r\nin politics, though the Protector sought, and he gave on occasions, his\r\nadvice. In February, 1660, he was elected to the new Council of State at\r\nthe head of the list, and in the Convention Parliament represented\r\nNottingham. In the negotiations with Charles II he was a moderating\r\ninfluence. Afterwards, he retired into private life. He died in 1678 or\r\n1679. His eldest son, Robert, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir\r\nJohn Evelyn, pre-deceased his father, dying in 1666, and the earldom\r\npassed to his eldest son, Robert, who died unmarried in 1682. The title\r\nthen went to his next brother, William, who died without issue eight\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nA younger brother of Robert and William, Evelyn Pierrepont, now\r\nsucceeded as (fifth) earl. He was the father of Lady Mary. Born in 1665,\r\nhe was returned to Parliament for East Retford in 1689, but his stay in\r\nthe House of Commons was brief, for in the following year the peerage\r\ndescended to him. In December, 1706, the higher dignity that had once\r\nbeen in his family was revived in his favour, and he was created Earl of\r\nDorchester, with a special remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to\r\nhis uncle Gervase Pierrepont, who had himself been raised to the peerage\r\nas Lord Pierrepont of Ardglass in Ireland and later was given the\r\ndignity of Lord Pierrepont of Hanslope in Buckinghamshire. Lord\r\nPierrepont died in 1715, and both his titles became extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Marquess married Mary, daughter of William Feilding, third Earl of\r\nDenbigh, by his first wife, Mary, sister of John, first Baron of\r\nKingston, in the peerage of Ireland. Lady Mary was, therefore, a\r\nrelation of the novelist, Henry Fielding, whose surname was spelt\r\ndifferently because, he explained, his branch of the family was the only\r\none that could spell correctly.\r\n\r\nOf this marriage, there was issue:\r\n\r\n(i.) William, who took the style of Viscount Newark until 1706, and then\r\nwas known as Earl of Kingston until his death in 1713, at the age of\r\ntwenty-one. He had married before 1711 Rachel, daughter of Thomas\r\nBaynton, of Little Charfield, Wilts, who outlived her husband eight\r\nyears. There was a son, Evelyn, who succeeded to the peerage.\r\n\r\n(ii.) Lady Mary, the subject of this memoir.\r\n\r\n(iii.) Lady Frances, who in 1714 became the second wife of John Erskine,\r\nsixth or eleventh Earl of Mar; and\r\n\r\n(iv.) Lady Evelyn, who married John, second Baron, and afterwards first\r\nEarl Gower, and died in June, 1727.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1697, when Lady Mary was eight years old, her mother\r\ndied. After this, the little girl was allowed to run rather wild. Lord\r\nKingston was very much a man about town and a gallant, and was too\r\ngreatly occupied with his affairs and his parliamentary duties, which\r\ntook him often from home, to concern himself about her education. In\r\nfact, before her mother's death, it would seem that Lady Mary spent\r\nmonths at her grandmother's, Mrs. Elizabeth Pierrepont, at her house at\r\nWest Dean. When she was in her ninth year she returned to Holme\r\nPierrepont, where, as she later complained, she was left \"to the care of\r\nan old governess, who, though perfectly good and pious, wanted\r\ncapacity.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary early had a taste for books, and enjoyed to the full the\r\nlibrary, where she no doubt read much that was good for her, and a good\r\ndeal that was not. She read everything that she could lay her hands on,\r\nthe old romances, poetry, and plays. One account has it that she was\r\ntaught Greek and Latin by her brother's tutor; but Sir Leslie Stephen\r\nwas doubtful about the Greek and inclined to the belief that she taught\r\nherself Latin. Later, certainly, she taught herself Italian, and quoted\r\nTasso in her letters. In her studies she was encouraged by her uncle,\r\nWilliam Feilding, and also by Bishop Burnet, of whom she said many\r\nyears later: \"I knew him in my very early youth, and his condescension\r\nin directing a girl in her studies is an obligation I can never forget.\"\r\nShe had literary aspirations, and just after her twenty-first birthday\r\nshe submitted to Burnet, with the following letter, a translation of\r\n\"Encheiridion\" of Epictetus from the Latin version. This will be found\r\nin the collected works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"July 20, 1710.\r\n\r\n\"My Lord,\r\n\r\n\"Your hours are so well employed, I hardly dare offer you this trifle to\r\nlook over; but then, so well am I acquainted with the sweetness of\r\ntemper which accompanies your learning, I dare ever assure myself of a\r\npardon. You have already forgiven me greater impertinencies, and\r\ncondescended yet further in giving me instructions and bestowing some of\r\nyour minutes in teaching me. This surprising humility has all the effect\r\nit ought to have on my heart; I am sensible of the gratitude I owe to so\r\nmuch goodness, and how much I am ever bound to be your servant. Here is\r\nthe work of one week of my solitude--by the many faults in it your\r\nlordship will easily believe I spent no more time upon it; it was hardly\r\nfinished when I was obliged to begin my journey, and I had not leisure\r\nto write it over again. You have it here without any corrections, with\r\nall its blots and errors: I endeavoured at no beauty of style, but to\r\nkeep as literally as I could to the sense of the author. My only\r\nintention in presenting it, is to ask your lordship whether I have\r\nunderstood Epictetus? The fourth chapter, particularly, I am afraid I\r\nhave mistaken. Piety and greatness of soul set you above all misfortunes\r\nthat can happen to yourself, and the calumnies of false tongues; but\r\nthat same piety which renders what happens to yourself indifferent to\r\nyou, yet softens the natural compassion in your temper to the greatest\r\ndegree of tenderness for the interests of the Church, and the liberty\r\nand welfare of your country: the steps that are now made towards the\r\ndestruction of both, the apparent danger we are in, the manifest growth\r\nof injustice, oppression, and hypocrisy, cannot do otherwise than give\r\nyour lordship those hours of sorrow, which, did not your fortitude of\r\nsoul, and reflections from religion and philosophy, shorten, would add\r\nto the national misfortunes, by injuring the health of so great a\r\nsupporter of our sinking liberties. I ought to ask pardon for this\r\ndigression; it is more proper for me in this place to say something to\r\nexcuse an address that looks so very presuming. My sex is usually forbid\r\nstudies of this nature, and folly reckoned so much our proper sphere, we\r\nare sooner pardoned any excesses of that, than the least pretensions to\r\nreading or good sense. We are permitted no books but such as tend to the\r\nweakening and effeminating of the mind. Our natural defects are every\r\nway indulged, and it is looked upon as in a degree criminal to improve\r\nour reason, or fancy we have any. We are taught to place all our art in\r\nadorning our outward forms, and permitted, without reproach, to carry\r\nthat custom even to extravagancy, while our minds are entirely\r\nneglected, and, by disuse of reflections, filled with nothing but the\r\ntrifling objects our eyes are daily entertained with. This custom, so\r\nlong established and industriously upheld, makes it even ridiculous to\r\ngo out of the common road, and forces one to find as many excuses, as if\r\nit were a thing altogether criminal not to play the fool in concert with\r\nother women of quality, whose birth and leisure only serve to render\r\nthem the most useless and most worthless part of the creation. There is\r\nhardly a character in the world more despicable, or more liable to\r\nuniversal ridicule, than that of a learned woman; those words imply,\r\naccording to the received sense, a talking, impertinent, vain, and\r\nconceited creature. I believe nobody will deny that learning may have\r\nthis effect, but it must be a very superficial degree of it. Erasmus was\r\ncertainly a man of great learning, and good sense, and he seems to have\r\nmy opinion of it, when he says _Foemina qui_ [sic] _vere sapit, non\r\nvidetur sibi sapere; contra, quae cum nihil sapiat sibi videtur sapere,\r\nea demum bis stulta est_. The Abbé Bellegarde gives a right reason for\r\nwomen's talking overmuch: they know nothing, and every outward object\r\nstrikes their imagination, and produces a multitude of thoughts, which,\r\nif they knew more, they would know not worth their thinking of. I am not\r\nnow arguing for an equality of the two sexes. I do not doubt God and\r\nnature have thrown us into an inferior rank, we are a lower part of the\r\ncreation, we owe obedience and submission to the superior sex, and any\r\nwoman who suffers her vanity and folly to deny this, rebels against the\r\nlaw of the Creator, and indisputable order of nature; but there is a\r\nworse effect than this, which follows the careless education given to\r\nwomen of quality, its being so easy for any man of sense, that finds it\r\neither his interest or his pleasure, to corrupt them. The common method\r\nis, to begin by attacking their religion: they bring them a thousand\r\nfallacious arguments, which their excessive ignorance hinders them from\r\nrefuting: and I speak now from my own knowledge and conversation among\r\nthem, there are more atheists among the fine ladies than the loosest\r\nsort of rakes; and the same ignorance that generally works out into\r\nexcess of superstition, exposes them to the snares of any who have a\r\nfancy to carry them to t'other extreme. I have made my excuses already\r\ntoo long, and will conclude in the words of Erasmus:--_Vulgus sentit\r\nquod lingua Latina, non convenit foeminis, quia parum facit ad tuendam\r\nillarum pundicitiam, quoniam rarum et insolitum est foeminam scire\r\nLatinam; attamen consuetudo omnium malarum rerum magistra. Decorum est\r\nfoeminam in Germania nata_ [sic] _discere Gallice, ut loquatur_ _cum his\r\nqui sciunt Gallice; cur igitur habetur indecorum discere Latine, ut\r\nquotidie confabuletur cum tot autoribus tam facundis, tam eruditis, tam\r\nsapientibus, tam fides consultoribus. Certe mihi quantulumcunque cerebri\r\nest, malim in bonis studiis consumere, quam in precibus sine mente\r\ndictis, in pernoctibus conviviis, in exhauriendis, capacibus pateris,\r\n&c.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was not the sort of letter that in the opening years of the\r\neighteenth century even Bishops received from young ladies of rank, who\r\nusually took their pleasure in other and lighter ways. Lady Mary,\r\nhowever, loved to exercise her pen. She later composed some imitations of\r\nOvid, and tried her hand at one or two romances in the French manner.\r\nShe thus acquired a facility of expression that stood her in good stead\r\nwhen she came to write those letters that constitute her principal claim\r\nto fame.\r\n\r\nLady Mary was an attractive child, and her father was very proud of her,\r\nespecially when she was in what may be called the kitten stage. The\r\nstory is told that, when she was about eight years old, he named her as\r\na \"toast\" at the Kit-Cat Club, and as she was not known to the majority\r\nof the members he sent for her, where, on her arrival, she was received\r\nwith acclamation by the Whig wits there assembled.\r\n\r\nSometimes Lady Mary in her girlhood stayed at Thoresby, and occasionally\r\ncame up to her father's London house, which was in Arlington Street,\r\nwhich visits, accepting the story told by her granddaughter, Lady Louisa\r\nStuart, cannot have been an unmixed delight. \"Some particulars, in\r\nthemselves too insignificant to be worth recording, may yet interest the\r\ncurious, by setting before them the manners of our ancestors,\" Lady\r\nLouisa says. \"Lord Dorchester, having no wife to do the honours of his\r\ntable at Thoresby, imposed that task upon his eldest daughter, as soon\r\nas she had bodily strength for the office: which in those days required\r\nno small share. For this mistress of a country mansion was not only to\r\ninvite--that is urge and tease--her company to eat more than human\r\nthroats could conveniently swallow, but to carve every dish, when\r\nchosen, with her own hands. The greater the lady, the more indispensable\r\nthe duty. Each joint was carried up in its turn, to be operated upon by\r\nher, and her alone; since the peers and knights on either hand were so\r\nfar from being bound to offer their assistance, that the very master of\r\nthe house, posted opposite her, might not act as her croupier, his\r\ndepartment was to push the bottle after dinner. As for the crowd of\r\nguests, the most inconsiderable among them--the curate, or subaltern, or\r\nsquire's younger brother--if suffered through her neglect to help\r\nhimself to a slice of the mutton placed before him, would have chewed\r\nit in bitterness and gone home an affronted man, half inclined to give a\r\nwrong vote at the next election. There were then professed\r\ncarving-masters, who taught young ladies the art scientifically; from\r\none of whom Lady Mary said she took lessons three times a week that she\r\nmight be perfect on her father's public days, when, in order to perform\r\nher functions without interruption, she was forced to eat her own dinner\r\nalone an hour or two beforehand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGIRLHOOD (1703-1710)\r\n\r\nLady Mary makes the acquaintance of Edward Wortley Montagu--Montagu\r\nattracted by her looks and her literary gifts--Assists her in her\r\nstudies--Montagu a friend of the leading men of letters of the\r\nday--Addison, Steele, Congreve, Vanbrugh, and others--The second volume\r\nof the _Tatler_ dedicated to him by Steele--Montagu a staunch Whig--His\r\npaternal interest for Lady Mary does not endure--He becomes a suitor for\r\nher hand--Lady Mary's devotion and respect for him--Her flirtations--She\r\nand Montagu correspond through the medium of his sister, Anne--Lady\r\nMary's mordant humour--Her delight in retailing society scandal--The\r\ndeath of Anne Wortley--Lady Mary and Montagu henceforth communicate\r\ndirect--Her first letter to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen the precocious Lady Mary, when on a visit to\r\nWharncliffe Lodge, some thirty miles from Thoresby, made a conquest that\r\nwas vastly to influence her life. The conquest was no less a person than\r\nEdward Wortley Montagu, son of Sidney Wortley Montagu, who was the\r\nsecond son of Edward, first Earl of Sandwich, the famous Admiral of\r\nCharles II. Sidney had taken the name of Wortley on his marriage to\r\nAnne, daughter of Sir Francis Wortley. To Sidney Wortley Montagu, of\r\nwhom there is to-day little known, is an interesting reference in a\r\nletter from the Earl of Danby to his wife, dated from Kiveton, September\r\n6, 1684: \"I have had Mr. Montague with me--my Lord Sandwich his son--who\r\nlives at Wortley, and calls himself by that name, and is really a very\r\nfine gentleman and told me he was sorry that any of his relations--much\r\nmore of his name--should have carried themselves so unjustly towards me,\r\nand he hoped I would not have the worse opinion of him for their\r\nill-behaviour.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Wortley Montagu, who was then twenty-five, was already a person\r\nof some distinction. He was a good classical scholar, acquainted with\r\nmodern languages, and versed in what his grand-daughter, Lady Louisa\r\nStuart, styled \"polite literature.\" He was interested in the pretty,\r\nclever girl, and encouraged her to talk to him of her reading and\r\nwriting. \"When I was very young,\" she said, as is recorded in the\r\n_Anecdotes_ of the Rev. Joseph Spence, \"I was a great admirer of Ovid's\r\n'Metamorphosis,' and that was one of the reasons that set me upon the\r\nthoughts of stealing the Latin language. Mr. Wortley was the only person\r\nto whom I communicated my design, and he encouraged me in it. I used to\r\nstudy five or six hours a day for two years in my father's library, and\r\nso got that language whilst everybody else thought I was reading nothing\r\nbut novels and romances.\"\r\n\r\nMontagu affected the company of men of letters. He was intimate with\r\nAddison, a close friend of Steele, and on terms with Congreve, Vanbrugh,\r\nand Garth, the author of _The Dispensary._ Steele, in fact, dedicated\r\nthe second volume of the _Tatler_ to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"When I send you this Volume, I am rather to make a Request than a\r\nDedication. I must desire, that if you think fit to throw away any\r\nMoments on it, you would not do it after reading those excellent Pieces\r\nwith which you are usually conversant. The Images which you will meet\r\nwith here, will be very feint, after the Perusal of the _Greeks_ and\r\n_Romans_, who are your ordinary Companions. I must confess I am obliged\r\nto you for the Taste of many of their Excellencies, which I had not\r\nobserved till you pointed them to me. I am very proud that there are\r\nsome things in these Papers which I know you pardon, and it is no small\r\nPleasure to have one's Labours suffered by the Judgment of a Man who so\r\nwell understands the true Charms of Eloquence and Poesie. But I direct\r\nthis Address to you, not that I think I can entertain you with my\r\nWritings, but to thank you for the new Delight I have from your\r\nConversation in those of other men.\r\n\r\n\"May you enjoy a long Continuance of the true Relish of the Happiness\r\nHeaven hath bestowed on you. I know not how to say a more affectionate\r\nThing to you, than to wish you may be always what you are, and that you\r\nmay ever think, as I know you now do, that you have a much larger\r\nFortune than you want. I am,\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your most Obedient and most Humble Servant,\r\n\r\n\"ISAAC BICKERSTAFF.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMontagu was also interested in politics. He was a staunch Whig, and in\r\nfavour with the leaders of his party. He sat in the House of Commons\r\nfrom 1705 to 1713 as member for Huntingdon, where there was family\r\ninterest. It was not, however, until after the accession of George I\r\nthat he held office.\r\n\r\nAt first, it may be, Montagu took some kind of paternal interest in Lady\r\nMary. This attitude did not long endure. When the change in his feelings\r\ntook place there is no means of knowing. He does not seem to have been a\r\npassionate man, nor a very ardent lover, but there is no doubt that at\r\nthis period he inspired the girl with a very real devotion and respect,\r\neven though perhaps her heart was not deeply engaged.\r\n\r\nMontagu would have had the girl find her pleasures exclusively in books\r\nand in his own conversation. She, at the age of twenty, on the other\r\nhand, was full of the joy of life and liked the various social pleasures\r\nthat came her way. Naturally, she tried the effect of her good looks and\r\nwit on men. In fact, she was fond of flirting, and as it must probably\r\nhave been impossible to flirt with Montagu, she indulged herself in that\r\nagreeable pastime with more than one other--to the great annoyance of\r\nthat pompous prig of an admirer of hers. The following letter, dated\r\nSeptember 5, 1709, written to Anne Wortley for her brother's perusal,\r\nwas clearly an endeavour to sooth away the man's jealousy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"September 5, 1709.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Wortley, as she has the entire power of raising, can also,\r\nwith a word, calm my passions. The kindness of your last recompenses me\r\nfor the injustice of your former letter; but you cannot sure be angry at\r\nmy little resentment. You have read that a man who, with patience, hears\r\nhimself called heretic, can never be esteemed a good Christian. To be\r\ncapable of preferring the despicable wretch you mention to Mr. Wortley,\r\nis as ridiculous, if not as criminal, as forsaking the Deity to worship\r\na calf. Don't tell me any body ever had so mean an opinion of my\r\ninclinations; 'tis among the number of those things I would forget. My\r\ntenderness is always built upon my esteem, and when the foundation\r\nperishes, it falls: I must own, I think it is so with every body--but\r\nenough of this: you tell me it was meant for raillery--was not the\r\nkindness meant so too? I fear I am too apt to think what is amusement\r\ndesigned in earnest--no matter, 'tis for my repose to be deceived, and I\r\nwill believe whatever you tell me.\r\n\r\n\"I should be very glad to be informed of a right method, or whether\r\nthere is such a thing alone, but am afraid to ask the question. It may\r\nbe reasonably called presumption in a girl to have her thoughts that\r\nway. You are the only creature that I have made my confidante in that\r\ncase: I'll assure you, I call it the greatest secret of my life. Adieu,\r\nmy dear, the post stays, my next shall be longer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was probably more complaisant on paper than actually in her\r\nconduct of life. She desired male as well as female companionship; she\r\nliked the admiration and the flattery of men, and, no doubt, did her\r\nbest to evoke it. It is strange, however, that with her beauty--for that\r\nshe was in her early years beautiful has generally been accepted--she\r\nwas not unduly attractive to men. It may be that her good looks brought\r\nyoung men to her feet, and that her tongue drove them away. In no age\r\nhas a clever woman been very popular with the other sex, and in the\r\nearly years of the eighteenth century, when girls could do little more\r\nthan read and write--and not always so much--wit such as hers and the\r\nreadiness of reply with which she was gifted must have been a deterrent.\r\nWhat could the ordinary social butterfly think of a Lady Mary who had as\r\na friend Mary Ansell, the author of a _Serious Proposal to Ladies--_\r\nwhat, though perhaps not one of them had read the book?\r\n\r\nStill, there was enough levity in Lady Mary's behaviour in society for\r\nher to think it desirable to make some explanation to Montagu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"[Indorsed '9 April,' 1711.]\r\n\r\n\"I thought to return no answer to your letter, but I find I am not so\r\nwise as I thought myself. I cannot forbear fixing my mind a little on\r\nthat expression, though perhaps the only insincere one in your whole\r\nletter--I would die to be secure of your heart, though but for a\r\nmoment:--were this but true, what is there I would not do to secure you?\r\n\r\n\"I will state the case to you as plainly as I can; and then ask yourself\r\nif you use me well. I have shewed, in every action of my life, an esteem\r\nfor you that at least challenges a grateful regard. I have trusted my\r\nreputation in your hands; I have made no scruple of giving you, under my\r\nown hand, an assurance of my friendship. After all this, I exact nothing\r\nfrom you: if you find it inconvenient for your affairs to take so small\r\na fortune, I desire you to sacrifice nothing to me; I pretend no tie\r\nupon your honour: but, in recompence for so clear and so disinterested a\r\nproceeding, must I ever receive injuries and ill usage?\r\n\r\n\"I have not the usual pride of my sex; I can bear being told I am in the\r\nwrong, but tell it me gently. Perhaps I have been indiscreet; I came\r\nyoung into the hurry of the world; a great innocence and an undesigning\r\ngaiety may possibly have been construed coquetry and a desire of being\r\nfollowed, though never meant by me. I cannot answer for the [reflections]\r\nthat may be made on me: all who are malicious attack the careless and\r\ndefenceless: I own myself to be both. I not anything I can say more to\r\nshew my perfect desire of pleasing you and making you easy, than to\r\nproffer to be confined with you in what manner you please. Would any\r\nwoman but me renounce all the world for one? or would any man but you\r\nbe insensible of such a proof of sincerity?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom an early age Lady Mary indulged her somewhat mordant humour, not\r\nless in her letters than in her conversation, and as that quality must\r\nhave some subject upon which to exercise itself, she was generally on\r\nthe look-out for some tit-bit of scandal which she could relate in her\r\nown inimitable manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Next to the great ball, what makes the most noise is the marriage of an\r\nold maid, who lives in this street, without a portion, to a man of\r\n£7,000 _per annum_, and they say £40,000 in ready money,\" she wrote to\r\nMrs. Hewet about the beginning of 1709. \"Her equipage and liveries\r\noutshine anybody's in town. He has presented her with £3,000 in jewels;\r\nand never was man more smitten with these charms that had lain invisible\r\nfor these forty years; but, with all his glory, never bride had fewer\r\nenviers, the dear beast of a man is so filthy, frightful, odious, and\r\ndetestable. I would turn away such a footman, for fear of spoiling my\r\ndinner, while he waited at table. They were married on Friday, and came\r\nto church _en parade_ on Sunday. I happened to sit in the pew with them,\r\nand had the honour of seeing Mrs. Bride fall fast asleep in the middle\r\nof the sermon, and snore very comfortably; which made several women in\r\nthe church think the bridegroom not quite so ugly as they did before.\r\nEnvious people say 'twas all counterfeited to please him, but I believe\r\nthat to be scandal; for I dare swear, nothing but downright necessity\r\ncould make her miss one word of the sermon. He professes to have married\r\nher for her devotion, patience, meekness, and other Christian virtues he\r\nobserved in her; his first wife (who has left no children) being very\r\nhandsome, and so good natured as to have ventured her own salvation to\r\nsecure his. He has married this lady to have a companion in that\r\nparadise where his first has given him a title. I believe I have given\r\nyou too much of this couple; but they are not to be comprehended in few\r\nwords.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is another malicious story that appealed to Lady Mary's wayward\r\nfancy,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Braithwayte, a Yorkshire beauty,\" she wrote to the same\r\ncorrespondent in March, 1712, \"who had been but two days married to a\r\nMr. Coleman, ran out of bed _en chemise_, and her husband followed her\r\nin his, in which pleasant dress they ran as far as St. James's Street,\r\nwhere they met with a chair, and prudently crammed themselves both into\r\nit, observing the rule of dividing the good and bad fortune of this\r\nlife, resolved to run all hazards together, and ordered the chairmen to\r\ncarry them both away, perfectly representing, both in love and\r\nnakedness, and want of eyes to see that they were naked, our first happy\r\nparents. Sunday last I had the pleasure of hearing the whole history\r\nfrom the lady's own mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLove-affairs, other people's love-affairs anyhow, had an attraction for\r\nLady Mary. \"You talk of the Duke of Leeds,\" she wrote. \"I hear that he\r\nhas placed his heroic love upon the bright charms of a pewterer's wife;\r\nand, after a long amour, and many perilous adventures, has stolen the\r\nfair lady, which, in spite of his wrinkles and grandchild, persuade\r\npeople of his youth and gallantry.\" The nobleman in question, Peregrine\r\nOsborne, second Duke of Leeds, was then fifty-six--which, after all,\r\nregarded from the standpoint of to-day, is not such a great age as is\r\nsuggested by the story.\r\n\r\nIf Montagu objected to the indiscretions of Lady Mary, it does not\r\nappear that he was in any hurry to get married to her. Of course, it may\r\nbe--it is only fair to him to say--that Lady Mary held him temporarily\r\nat bay, preferring the frivolities of those of her own age to the\r\naustere attentions of one who acted as if he might have been her father.\r\n\r\nFor some years she and Montagu were apparently content with writing long\r\nletters to each other when they were not both in town. When the\r\ncorrespondence started is uncertain. The first letter of Lady Mary that\r\nhas been preserved is dated Thoresby, May 2, 1709; but there can be no\r\ndoubt that they had been in regular communication before then.\r\n\r\nIt is specially to be noted that the earlier letters of Lady Mary were\r\naddressed to Montagu's sister, Anne. It is evident, however, that they\r\nwere definitely written for his perusal, and it is equally clear that\r\nAnne's replies were inspired, and sometimes, if not always, drafted by\r\nhim. This practice continued until the death of Anne Wortley in March,\r\n1710. Yet there seems to have been no reason for this camouflage. In\r\n1709 Lady Mary was twenty years of age, and Montagu was a very eligible\r\n_parti_.\r\n\r\nThe respectful, highfalutin gallantry that is the key-note of the\r\ncorrespondence recalls the correspondence that presently was exchanged\r\nbetween Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk, and the octogenarian Earl\r\nof Peterborough.\r\n\r\nSome typical passages from the letters to \"My dear Mrs. Wortley\" may be\r\ngiven--it should be mentioned that it was the social custom of the day\r\nto address as \"Mrs.\" maiden ladies as well as married women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thoresby, August 8, 1709.\r\n\r\n\"I know no pretence I have to your good opinion but my hearty desiring\r\nit; I wish I had that imagination you talk of, to render me a fitter\r\ncorrespondent for you, who can write so well on every thing. I am now so\r\nmuch alone, I have leisure to pass whole days in reading, but am not at\r\nall proper for so delicate an employment as choosing you books. Your own\r\nfancy will better direct you. My study at present is nothing but\r\ndictionaries and grammars. I am trying whether it be possible to learn\r\nwithout a master; I am not certain (and dare hardly hope) I shall make\r\nany great progress; but I find the study so diverting I am not only\r\neasy, but pleased with the solitude that indulges it. I forget there is\r\nsuch a place as London, and wish for no company but yours. You see, my\r\ndear, in making my pleasures consist of these unfashionable diversions,\r\nI am not of the number who cannot be easy out of the mode. I believe\r\nmore follies are committed out of complaisance to the world, than in\r\nfollowing our own inclinations--Nature is seldom in the wrong, custom\r\nalways; it is with some regret I follow it in all the impertinencies of\r\ndress; the compliance is so trivial it comforts me; but I am amazed to\r\nsee it consulted even in the most important occasions of our lives; and\r\nthat people of good sense in other things can make their happiness\r\nconsist in the opinions of others, and sacrifice every thing in the\r\ndesire of appearing in fashion. I call all people who fall in love with\r\nfurniture, clothes, and equipage, of this number, and I look upon them\r\nas no less in the wrong than when they were five years old, and doated\r\non shells, pebbles, and hobby-horses: I believe you will expect this\r\nletter to be dated from the other world, for sure I am you never heard\r\nan inhabitant of this talk so before. I suppose you expect, too, I\r\nshould conclude with begging pardon for this extreme tedious and very\r\nnonsensical letter; quite contrary, I think you will be obliged to me\r\nfor it. I could not better show my great concern for your reproaching me\r\nwith neglect I knew myself innocent of, than proving myself mad in three\r\npages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"August 21, 1709.\r\n\r\n\"I am infinitely obliged to you, my dear Mrs. Wortley, for the wit,\r\nbeauty, and other fine qualities, you so generously bestow upon me. Next\r\nto receiving them from Heaven, you are the person from whom I would\r\nchuse to receive gifts and graces: I am very well satisfied to owe them\r\nto your own delicacy of imagination, which represents to you the idea of\r\na fine lady, and you have good nature enough to fancy I am she. All this\r\nis mighty well, but you do not stop there; imagination is boundless.\r\nAfter giving me imaginary wit and beauty, you give me imaginary\r\npassions, and you tell me I'm in love: if I am, 'tis a perfect sin of\r\nignorance, for I don't so much as know the man's name: I have been\r\nstudying these three hours, and cannot guess who you mean. I passed the\r\ndays of Nottingham races, [at] Thoresby, without seeing or even wishing\r\nto see one of the sex. Now, if I am in love, I have very hard fortune to\r\nconceal it so industriously from my own knowledge, and yet discover it\r\nso much to other people. 'Tis against all form to have such a passion as\r\nthat, without giving one sigh for the matter. Pray tell me the name of\r\nhim I love, that I may (according to the laudable custom of lovers) sigh\r\nto the woods and groves hereabouts, and teach it to the echo. You see,\r\nbeing I am _[sic]_ in love, I am willing to be so in order and rule: I\r\nhave been turning over God knows how many books to look for precedents.\r\nRecommend an example to me; and, above all, let me know whether 'tis\r\nmost proper to walk in the woods, encreasing the winds with my sighs, or\r\nto sit by a purling stream, swelling the rivulet with my tears; may be,\r\nboth may do well in their turns:--but to be a minute serious, what do\r\nyou mean by this reproach of inconstancy? I confess you give me several\r\ngood qualities I have not, and I am ready to thank you for them, but\r\nthen you must not take away those few I have. No, I will never exchange\r\nthem; take back the beauty and wit you bestow upon me, leave me my own\r\nmediocrity of agreeableness and genius, but leave me also my sincerity,\r\nmy constancy and my plain dealing; 'tis all I have to recommend me to\r\nthe esteem either of others or myself. How should I despise myself if I\r\ncould think I was capable of either inconstancy or deceit! I know not\r\nhow I may appear to other people, nor how much my face may belie my\r\nheart, but I know that I never was or can be guilty of dissimulation or\r\ninconstancy--you will think this vain, but 'tis all that I pique myself\r\nupon. Tell me you believe me and repent of your harsh censure. Tell it\r\nme in pity to my uneasiness, for you are one of those few people about\r\nwhose good opinion I am in pain. I have always took so little care to\r\nplease the generality of the world, that I am never mortified or\r\ndelighted by its reports which is a piece of stoicism born with me; but\r\nI cannot be one minute easy while you think ill of\r\n\r\n\"Your faithful--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This letter is a good deal grave, and, like other grave things, dull;\r\nbut I won't ask pardon for what I can't help.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWas the sentiment expressed in the following letter, written about the\r\nsame time as that printed above, intended for Anne or her brother, or\r\nboth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When I said it cost nothing to write tenderly, I believe I spoke of\r\nanother sex; I am sure not of myself: 'tis not in my power (I would to\r\nGod it was!) to hide a kindness where I have one, or dissemble it where\r\nI have none. I cannot help answering your letter this minute, and\r\ntelling you I infinitely love you, though, it may be, you'll call the\r\none impertinence, and the other dissimulation; but you may think what\r\nyou please of me, I must eternally think the same things of you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was occasionally wearisome owing to the reiteration of the\r\nassurance that she believed her letters to be dull, the more so as she\r\ncertainly was conscious of the skill with which she composed them. \"What\r\ndo you mean by complaining I never write to you in the quiet situation\r\nof mind I do to other people?\" she asks Anne Wortley. \"My dear, people\r\nnever write calmly, but when they write indifferently.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a letter dated September 5, 1709, a passage from which has been\r\nprinted here, there is a break in the (preserved) correspondence. In the\r\nspring of the following year Anne Wortley died, and Lady Mary, on March\r\n28, paid tribute to her departed friend, addressing herself for the\r\nfirst time direct to Montagu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you'll be surprized at this letter; I have had many debates\r\nwith myself before I could resolve on it. I know it is not acting in\r\nform, but I do not look upon you as I do upon the rest of the world, and\r\nby what I do for _you_, you are not to judge my manner of acting with\r\nothers. You are brother to a woman I tenderly loved; my protestations of\r\nfriendship are not like other people's, I never speak but what I mean,\r\nand when I say I love, 'tis for ever. I had that real concern for Mrs.\r\nWortley, I look with some regard on every one that is related to her.\r\nThis and my long acquaintance with you may in some measure excuse what I\r\nam now doing. I am surprized at one of the 'Tatlers' you send me; is it\r\npossible to have any sort of esteem for a person one believes capable of\r\nhaving such trifling inclinations? Mr. Bickerstaff has very wrong\r\nnotions of our sex. I can say there are some of us that despise charms\r\nof show, and all the pageantry of greatness, perhaps with more ease than\r\nany of the philosophers. In contemning the world, they seem to take\r\npains to contemn it; we despise it, without taking the pains to read\r\nlessons of morality to make us do it. At least I know I have always\r\nlooked upon it with contempt, without being at the expense of one\r\nserious reflection to oblige me to it. I carry the matter yet farther;\r\nwas I to choose of two thousand pounds a year or twenty thousand, the\r\nfirst would be my choice. There is something of an unavoidable\r\n_embarras_ in making what is called a great figure in the world; [it]\r\ntakes off from the happiness of life; I hate the noise and hurry\r\ninseparable from great estates and titles, and look upon both as\r\nblessings that ought only to be given to fools, for 'tis only to them\r\nthat they are blessings. The pretty fellows you speak of, I own\r\nentertain me sometimes; but is it impossible to be diverted with what\r\none despises? I can laugh at a puppet-show; at the same time I know\r\nthere is nothing in it worth my attention or regard. General notions are\r\ngenerally wrong. Ignorance and folly are thought the best foundations\r\nfor virtue, as if not knowing what a good wife is was necessary to make\r\none so. I confess that can never be my way of reasoning; as I always\r\nforgive an _injury_ when I think it not done out of malice, I never\r\nthink myself _obliged_ by what is done without design.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary, who was now one-and-twenty, was no bread-and-butter miss. She\r\nknew her mind and had the gift to express herself, and in this same\r\nletter she very prettily rebukes her laggard lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Give me leave to say it, (I know it sounds vain,) I know how to make a\r\nman of sense happy; but then that man must resolve to contribute\r\nsomething towards it himself. I have so much esteem for you, I should be\r\nvery sorry to hear you was unhappy; but for the world I would not be the\r\ninstrument of making you so; which (of the humour you are) is hardly to\r\nbe avoided if I am your wife. You distrust me--I can neither be easy,\r\nnor loved, where I am distrusted. Nor do I believe your passion for me\r\nis what you pretend it; at least I am sure was I in love I could not\r\ntalk as you do. Few women would have spoke so plainly as I have done;\r\nbut to dissemble is among the things I never do. I take more pains to\r\napprove my conduct to myself than to the world; and would not have to\r\naccuse myself of a minute's deceit. I wish I loved you enough to devote\r\nmyself to be for ever miserable, for the pleasure of a day or two's\r\nhappiness. I cannot resolve upon it. You must think otherwise of me, or\r\nnot at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't enjoin you to burn this letter,\" she said in conclusion. \"I\r\nknow you will. 'Tis the first I ever writ to one of your sex, and shall\r\nbe the last. You must never expect another. I resolve against all\r\ncorrespondence of the kind--my resolutions are seldom made and never\r\nbroken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever happened to most of Lady Mary's resolutions, this one, at\r\nleast, was not kept. Actually, Lady Mary was not quite so emancipated at\r\nthis time of her life as she may have imagined. She never sent a letter,\r\nexcept in fear and trembling. \"I hazard a great deal if it falls\r\ninto other hands, and I write for all that,\" was her constant cry. Yet,\r\nthere was nothing in the correspondence, save the fact of it, to offend\r\neven a most austere maiden aunt of the day.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence, of course, continued. The lovers, if so they can be\r\ncalled, now indulged in a slightly acid academic discussion, or rather a\r\nnumber of slightly acid academic discussions, about marriage. It is\r\nevident that Montagu held strong views as to the duty of a wife; so\r\nundoubtedly did Lady Mary--only, the trouble was, the views were by no\r\nmeans identical. If he were determined to set himself up as the strong\r\nloquacious man, his _fiancée_ was certainly not prepared meekly to obey\r\nhis behests in silence. They indulged in a somewhat candid examination\r\nof each other's character--and of their own. It is really rather\r\namusing, this careful cold-blooded dissection of their feelings. It is a\r\nsafe guess that at this game Lady Mary scored heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wish, with all my soul, I thought as you do,\" she wrote on April 25,\r\n1710. \"I endeavour to convince myself by your arguments, and am sorry my\r\nreason is so obstinate, not to be deluded into an opinion, that 'tis\r\nimpossible a man can esteem a woman. I suppose I should then be very\r\neasy at your thoughts of me; I should thank you for the wit and beauty\r\nyou give me, and not be angry at the follies and weaknesses; but, to my\r\ninfinite affliction, I can believe neither one nor t'other. One part of\r\nmy character is not so good, nor t'other so bad, as you fancy it. Should\r\nwe ever live together, you would be disappointed both ways; you would\r\nfind an easy equality of temper you do not expect, and a thousand faults\r\nyou do not imagine. You think, if you married me, I should be\r\npassionately fond of you one month, and of somebody else the next:\r\nneither would happen. I can esteem, I can be a friend, but I don't know\r\nwhether I can love. Expect all that is complaisant and easy, but never\r\nwhat is fond, in me. You judge very wrong of my heart, when you suppose\r\nme capable of views of interest, and that anything could oblige me to\r\nflatter any body. Was I the most indigent creature in the world, I\r\nshould answer you as I do now, without adding or diminishing. I am\r\nincapable of art, and 'tis because I will not be capable of it. Could I\r\ndeceive one minute, I should never regain my own good opinion; and who\r\ncould bear to live with one they despised? If you can resolve to live\r\nwith a companion that will have all the deference due to your\r\nsuperiority of good sense, and that your proposals can be agreeable to\r\nthose on whom I depend, I have nothing to say against them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCOURTSHIP, ELOPEMENT, AND MARRIAGE (1710-1712)\r\n\r\nA lengthy courtship--Montagu a laggard lover--Lady Mary and Montagu\r\nexchange views on married life--Montagu proposes for her to Lord\r\nDorchester--Dorchester refuses, since Montagu will not make\r\nsettlements--Montagu's views on settlements expressed (by Steele) in the\r\n_Tatler_--Although not engaged, the young people continue to\r\ncorrespond--Lord Dorchester produces another suitor for his\r\ndaughter--She consents to an engagement--The preparations for the\r\nwedding--She confides the whole story to Montagu--She breaks off the\r\nengagement--She and Montagu decide to elope--She runs up to\r\nLondon--Marriage--Lady Mary's diary destroyed by her sister, Lady\r\nFrances Pierrepont.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter seven years or so of acquaintance, matters at last looked like\r\ncoming to a head. It would appear that Montagu, tentatively at least,\r\nhad put the question, because Lady Mary gives her views as to the life\r\nthey should lead after marriage. She is not averse from travelling; she\r\nhas no objection to leaving London; in fact, she would be willing to\r\nspend a few months in the country, if it so pleased him. It is all so\r\nextraordinarily unloverlike. There is too much philosophy about it. Love\r\ndoes not see so clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where people are tied for life, 'tis their mutual interest not to grow\r\nweary of one another,\" she wrote on April 25, 1710. \"If I had all the\r\npersonal charms that I want, a face is too slight a foundation for\r\nhappiness. You would be soon tired with seeing every day the same thing.\r\nWhere you saw nothing else, you would have leisure to remark all the\r\ndefects; which would increase in proportion as the novelty lessened,\r\nwhich is always a great charm. I should have the displeasure of seeing a\r\ncoldness, which, though I could not reasonably blame you for, being\r\ninvoluntary, yet it would render me uneasy; and the more, because I know\r\na love may be revived which absence, inconstancy, or even infidelity,\r\nhas extinguished; but there is no returning from a _dégout_ given by\r\nsatiety.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps Lady Mary believed that, while it is well to hope for the best,\r\nit is sound policy to prepare for the worst.\r\n\r\nMontagu may have found some comfort in the lady's assurance that if she\r\nhad a choice between two thousand a year or twenty thousand a year she\r\nwould choose the smaller income.\r\n\r\nAn apartment in London would satisfy Lady Mary. She would not choose to\r\nlive in a crowd, but would like to have a small circle of agreeable\r\npeople--she was very precise as to her desires: actually she wants to\r\nsee eight or nine pleasant folk. She does not believe that she can find\r\nentire happiness in solitude, not even (or perhaps especially not) in a\r\nsolitude of two; and she is at least as sure that he would not either.\r\nAnyhow she has not the slightest intention of taking the chance.\r\n\r\nIt becomes increasingly clear that she had had about enough of this\r\nepistolary philandering, and she indicated this in no uncertain manner.\r\n\"I will never think of anything without the consent of my family,\" she\r\nwrote. \"Make no answer to this, if you can like me on my own terms. 'Tis\r\nnot to me you must make the proposals; if not, to what purpose is our\r\ncorrespondence?\"\r\n\r\nAnd now comes a touch of the spur: \"However, preserve me your\r\nfriendship, which I think of with a great deal of pleasure. If ever you\r\nsee me married, I flatter myself you'll see a conduct you would not be\r\nsorry your wife should imitate.\"\r\n\r\nEven this did not bring Montagu to the point of asking Lord Dorchester\r\nfor the hand of his daughter. The correspondence, however, still\r\ncontinued, and soon they were hard at it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Kindness, you say, would be your destruction,\" she wrote in August,\r\n1710. \"In my opinion, this is something contradictory to some other\r\nexpressions. People talk of being in love just as widows do of\r\naffliction. Mr. Steele has observed, in one of his plays, the most\r\npassionate among them have always calmness enough to drive a hard\r\nbargain with the upholders. I never knew a lover that would not\r\nwillingly secure his interest as well as his mistress; or, if one must\r\nbe abandoned, had not the prudence (among all his distractions) to\r\nconsider, a woman was but a woman, and money was a thing of more real\r\nmerit than the whole sex put together. Your letter is to tell me, you\r\nshould think yourself undone if you married me; but if I would be so\r\ntender as to confess I should break my heart if you did not, then you'd\r\nconsider whether you would or no; but yet you hoped you should not. I\r\ntake this to be the right interpretation of--even your kindness can't\r\ndestroy me of a sudden--I hope I am not in your power--I would give a\r\ngood deal to be satisfied, &c.\r\n\r\n\"As to writing--that any woman would do that thought she writ well. Now\r\nI say, no woman of common sense would. At best, 'tis but doing a silly\r\nthing well, and I think it is much better not to do a silly thing at\r\nall. You compare it to dressing. Suppose the comparison just: perhaps\r\nthe Spanish dress would become my face very well; yet the whole town\r\nwould condemn me for the highest extravagance if I went to court in it,\r\nthough it improved me to a miracle. There are a thousand things, not ill\r\nin themselves, which custom makes unfit to be done. This is to convince\r\nyou I am so far from applauding my own conduct, my conscience flies in\r\nmy face every time I think on't. The generality of the world have a\r\ngreat indulgence to their own follies: without being a jot wiser than my\r\nneighbours, I have the peculiar misfortune to know and condemn all the\r\nwrong things I do.\r\n\r\n\"You beg to know whether I would not be out of humour. The expression is\r\nmodest enough; but that is not what you mean. In saying I could be easy,\r\nI have already said I should not be out of humour: but you would have me\r\nsay I am violently in love; that is, finding you think better of me than\r\nyou desire, you would have me give you a just cause to contemn me. I\r\ndoubt much whether there is a creature in the world humble enough to do\r\nthat. I should not think you more unreasonable if you was in love with\r\nmy face, and asked me to disfigure it to make you easy. I have heard of\r\nsome nuns that made use of that expedient to secure their own happiness;\r\nbut, amongst all the popish saints and martyrs, I never read of one\r\nwhose charity was sublime enough to make themselves deformed, or\r\nridiculous, to restore their lovers to peace and quietness. In short, if\r\nnothing can content you but despising me heartily, I am afraid I shall\r\nbe always so barbarous to wish you may esteem me as long as you live.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last Montagu formally approached Lord Dorchester, who had no\r\nobjection whatever to him as a suitor for the hand of Lady Mary. They\r\ncould not come to terms in the matter of settlements. Dorchester\r\ndemanded that the estates should be put into entail. Also he desired\r\nthat his future son-in-law should provide a town residence for Lady\r\nMary. This did not seem unreasonable, but Montagu did not see his way to\r\nagree to them. He was willing enough to make all proper provision for\r\nhis wife, but he declined absolutely to settle his landed property upon\r\na son who, as he put it, for aught he knew, might prove unworthy to\r\ninherit it, who might be a spendthrift, an idiot, or a villain--as a\r\nmatter of fact, the only son of the marriage turned out most things he\r\nshould not. Anyhow, Montagu held strong views on the subject, and these\r\nhe expounded to Richard Steele, who presented them in No. 223 of the\r\n_Tatler_ (September 12, 1710).\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That this method of making settlements was first invented by a griping\r\nlawyer, who made use of the covetous tempers of the parents of each\r\nside, to force two young people into these vile measures of diffidence\r\nfor no other end, but to increase the skins of parchment, by which they\r\nwere put into each other's possession out of each other's power. The law\r\nof our country has given an ample and generous provision for the wife,\r\neven the third of her husband's estate, and left to her good-humour and\r\nhis gratitude the expectation of farther provision, but the fantastical\r\nmethod of going farther, with relation to the heirs, has a foundation in\r\nnothing but pride, and folly: for as all men with their children as like\r\nthemselves, and as much better as they can possibly, it seems monstrous\r\nthat we should give out of ourselves the opportunities of rewarding and\r\ndiscouraging them according to their defects. The wife institution has\r\nno more sense in it, than if a man should begin a deed with 'Whereas no\r\nman living knows how long he shall continue to be a reasonable creature,\r\nor an honest man, and whereas I.B. am going to enter into the state of\r\nmatrimony with Mrs. D., therefore I shall from henceforth make it\r\nindifferent to me whether from this time forward I shall be a fool or\r\nknave. And therefore, in full and perfect health of body, and a sound\r\nmind, not knowing which of my children will prove better or worse, I\r\ngive to my first-born, be he perverse, ungrateful, impious, or cruel,\r\nthe lump and bulk of my estate, and leave one year's purchase only to\r\neach of my younger children, whether they shall be brave or beautiful,\r\nmodest or honourable, from the time of the date hereof, wherein I resign\r\nmy senses, and hereby promise to employ my judgment no farther in the\r\ndistribution of my worldly goods from the date hereof, hereby farther\r\nconfessing and covenanting, that I am henceforth married, and dead in\r\nlaw....'\r\n\r\n\"How strangely men are sometimes partial to themselves, appears by the\r\nrapine of him, that has a daughter's beauty under his direction. He will\r\nmake no scruple of using it to force from her lover as much of his\r\nestate, as is worth ten thousand pounds, and at the same time, as a\r\njustice on the bench, will spare no pains to get a man hanged that has\r\ntaken but a horse from him.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be hoped that the legislature will in due time take this kind\r\nof robbery into consideration, and not suffer men to prey upon each\r\nother when they are about making the most solemn league, and entering\r\ninto the strictest bonds. The only sure remedy is to fix a certain rate\r\non every woman's fortune, one price for that of a maid, and another for\r\nthat of a widow: for it is of infinite advantage, that there should be\r\nno frauds or uncertainties in the sale of our women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless Montagu were tactless beyond the general, the position as regards\r\nhimself and Lord Dorchester must indeed have been hopeless before he\r\ninspired the paper in the _Tatler_ on settlements. Anyhow, Montagu, who\r\nwas used to having his way, and was probably very cross at being\r\nthwarted on this occasion, would not yield a step; and Lord Dorchester\r\nmaintained his attitude that philosophic theories were all very well in\r\ntheir way, but he would not sanction a marriage that involved the risk\r\nof his grandchildren being left beggars.\r\n\r\nLady Mary was powerless in the matter, but, although her father said\r\nthere was no engagement between her and Montagu, the young people\r\ncontinued their correspondence with unabated vigour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am going to comply with your request, and write with all the\r\nplainness I am capable of,\" she replied in November, 1710, to one of\r\nMontagu's effusions. \"I know what may be said upon such a proceeding,\r\nbut am sure you will not say it. Why should you always put the worst\r\nconstruction upon my words? Believe me what you will, but do not believe\r\nI can be ungenerous or ungrateful. I wish I could tell you what answer\r\nyou will receive from some people, or upon what terms. If my opinion\r\ncould sway, nothing should displease you. Nobody ever was so\r\ndisinterested as I am. I would not have to reproach myself (I don't\r\nsuppose you would) that I had any way made you uneasy in your\r\ncircumstances. Let me beg you (which I do with the utmost sincerity)\r\nonly to consider yourself in this affair; and, since I am so unfortunate\r\nto have nothing in my own disposal, do not think I have any hand in\r\nmaking settlements. People in my way are sold like slaves; and I cannot\r\ntell what price my master will put on me. If you do agree, I shall\r\nendeavour to contribute, as much as lies in my power, to your happiness.\r\nI so heartily despise a great figure, I have no notion of spending money\r\nso foolishly; though one had a great deal to throw away. If this breaks\r\noff, I shall not complain of you: and as, whatever happens, I shall\r\nstill preserve the opinion you have behaved yourself well. Let me\r\nentreat you, if I have committed any follies, to forgive them; and be so\r\njust to think I would not do an ill thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, Lady Mary wrote again to Montagu. \"I have tried to\r\nwrite plainly,\" she said; and she did not have to reproach herself with\r\nfailure. It had now come to a struggle for mastery, and she would not\r\nyield a foot of her ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I do not at all wonder that absence, and variety of new faces,\r\nshould make you forget me; but I am a little surprised at your curiosity\r\nto know what passes in my heart (a thing wholly insignificant to you),\r\nexcept you propose to yourself a piece of ill-natured satisfaction, in\r\nfinding me very much disquieted. Pray which way would you see into my\r\nheart? You can frame no guesses about it from either my speaking or\r\nwriting; and, supposing I should attempt to show it you, I know no other\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to be tired of my humility: I have carried my complaisances to\r\nyou farther than I ought. You make new scruples; you have a great deal\r\nof fancy; and your distrusts being all of your own making, are more\r\nimmovable than if there was some real ground for them. Our aunts and\r\ngrandmothers always tell us that men are a sort of animals, that, if\r\nthey are constant, 'tis only where they are ill used. 'Twas a kind of\r\nparadox I could never believe: experience has taught me the truth of it.\r\nYou are the first I ever had a correspondence with, and I thank God I\r\nhave done with it for all my life. You needed not to have told me you\r\nare not what you have been: one must be stupid not to find a difference\r\nin your letters. You seem, in one part of your last, to excuse yourself\r\nfrom having done me any injury in point of fortune. Do I accuse you of\r\nany?\r\n\r\n\"I have not spirits to dispute any longer with you. You say you are not\r\nyet determined: let me determine for you, and save you the trouble of\r\nwriting again. Adieu for ever! make no answer. I wish, among the variety\r\nof acquaintance, you may find some one to please you; and can't help the\r\nvanity of thinking, should you try them all, you won't find one that\r\nwill be so sincere in their treatment, though a thousand more deserving,\r\nand every one happier. 'Tis a piece of vanity and injustice I never\r\nforgive in a woman, to delight to give pain; what must I think of a man\r\nthat takes pleasure in making me uneasy? After the folly of letting you\r\nknow it is in your power, I ought in prudence to let this go no farther,\r\nexcept I thought you had good nature enough never to make use of that\r\npower. I have no reason to think so: however, I am willing, you see, to\r\ndo you the highest obligation 'tis possible for me to do; that is, to\r\ngive you a fair occasion of being rid of me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is now another break in the (preserved) correspondence until the\r\nend of February, 1711, and then Lady Mary, writing with more than a\r\ntinge of bitterness, broke off all relations with him--or, at least,\r\naffected to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I intended to make no answer to your letter; it was something very\r\nungrateful, and I resolved to give over all thoughts of you. I could\r\neasily have performed that resolve some time ago, but then you took\r\npains to please me; now you have brought me to esteem you, you make use\r\nof that esteem to give me uneasiness; and I have the displeasure of\r\nseeing I esteem a man that dislikes me. Farewell then: since you will\r\nhave it so, I renounce all the ideas I have so long flattered myself\r\nwith, and will entertain my fancy no longer with the imaginary pleasure\r\nof pleasing you. How much wiser are all those women I have despised than\r\nmyself! In placing their happiness in trifles, they have placed it in\r\nwhat is attainable. I fondly thought fine clothes and gilt coaches,\r\nballs, operas, and public adoration, rather the fatigues of life; and\r\nthat true happiness was justly defined by Mr. Dryden (pardon the romantic\r\nair of repeating verses), when he says,\r\n\r\n  'Whom Heav'n would bless it does from pomps remove\r\n   And makes their wealth in privacy and love.'\r\n\r\nThese notions had corrupted my judgment as much as Mrs. Biddy Tipkin's.\r\nAccording to this scheme, I proposed to pass my life with you. I yet do\r\nyou the justice to believe, if any man could have been contented with\r\nthis manner of living, it would have been you. Your indifference to me\r\ndoes not hinder me from thinking you capable of tenderness, and the\r\nhappiness of friendship; but I find it is not to me you'll ever have\r\nthem; you think me all that is detestable; you accuse me of want of\r\nsincerity and generosity. To convince you of your mistake, I'll show you\r\nthe last extremes of both.\r\n\r\n\"While I foolishly fancied you loved me, (which I confess I had never\r\nany great reason for, more than that I wished it,) there is no condition\r\nof life I could not have been happy in with you, so very much I liked\r\nyou--I may say loved, since it is the last thing I'll ever say to you.\r\nThis is telling you sincerely my greatest weakness; and now I will\r\noblige you with a new proof of generosity--I'll never see you more. I\r\nshall avoid all public places; and this is the last letter I shall send.\r\nIf you write, be not displeased if I send it back unopened. I force my\r\ninclinations to oblige yours; and remember that you have told me I could\r\nnot oblige you more than by refusing you. Had I intended ever to see you\r\nagain, I durst not have sent this letter. Adieu.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above letter was evidently sent in a fit of pique. Certainly the\r\nposition must have been almost unbearable to a young woman of spirit.\r\nHere was Lady Mary, in her twenty-second or twenty-third year, for all\r\npractical purposes betrothed, and her father and her lover quarrelling\r\nover settlements. Her friends were all getting married and having\r\nestablishments of their own, and she more or less in disgrace, living at\r\none or other of her father's houses.\r\n\r\nNothing came of her announcement that she desired no further relation\r\nwith Montagu. She could not bring herself definitely to break with\r\nMontagu, and he would neither wed her nor give her up. The\r\ncorrespondence continued with unabated vigour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am in pain about the letter I sent you this morning,\" she wrote in\r\nMarch, 1911. \"I fear you should think, after what I have said, you\r\ncannot, in point of honour, break off with me. Be not scrupulous on that\r\narticle, nor affect to make me break first, to excuse your doing it; I\r\nwould owe nothing but to inclination: if you do not love me, I may have\r\nthe less esteem of myself, but not of you: I am not of the number of\r\nthose women that have the opinion of their persons Mr. Bayes had of his\r\nplay, that 'tis the touchstone of sense, and they are to frame their\r\njudgment of people's understanding according to what they think of them.\r\n\r\n\"You may have wit, good humour, and good nature, and not like me. I\r\nallow a great deal for the inconstancy of mankind in general, and my own\r\nwant of merit in particular. But 'tis a breach, at least, of the two\r\nlast, to deceive me. I am sincere: I shall be sorry if I am not now what\r\npleases; but if I (as I could with joy) abandon all things to the care\r\nof pleasing you, I am then undone if I do not succeed.--Be generous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that she confided her troubles to Mrs. Hewet.\r\n\"At present, my domestic affairs go on so ill, I want spirits to look\r\nround,\" she wrote. \"I have got a cold that disables my eyes and\r\ndisorders me every other way. Mr. Mason has ordered me blooding, to\r\nwhich I have submitted, after long contestation. You see how stupid I\r\nam; I entertain you with discourses of physic, but I have the oddest\r\njumble of disagreeable things in my head that ever plagued poor mortals;\r\na great cold, a bad peace, people I love in disgrace, sore eyes, the\r\nhorrid prospect of a civil war, and the thought of a filthy potion to\r\ntake. I believe nobody ever had such a _mélange_ before.\"\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory situation, apparently, might have continued\r\nindefinitely, for, even if Montagu had been more pressing, Lady Mary, in\r\nspite of her independent attitude, was most reluctant, indeed, almost\r\ndetermined, not to marry without her father's consent.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1712, however, Lord Dorchester created a crisis.\r\nThinking, perhaps, that his daughter might one day get out of hand and,\r\nin despair, defy him, he decided to find her a husband other than\r\nMontagu. At first, from a sense of weariness and from filial duty, Lady\r\nMary inclined to obey the parental injunction--to her father's great\r\ndelight. All the preparations for the wedding were put in train--then,\r\nultimately, Lady Mary declared that she could not and would not go\r\nthrough with it on any terms. Who the bridegroom was she does not\r\nmention, but, in a manner somewhat involved, she in a letter in July,\r\n1912, confided the whole story to Montagu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am going to write you a plain long letter. What I have already told\r\nyou is nothing but the truth. I have no reason to believe I am going to\r\nbe otherwise confined than by my duty; but I, that know my own mind,\r\nknow that is enough to make me miserable. I see all the misfortune of\r\nmarrying where it is impossible to love; I am going to confess a\r\nweakness may perhaps add to your contempt of me. I wanted courage to\r\nresist at first the will of my relations; but, as every day added to my\r\nfears, those, at last, grew strong enough to make me venture the\r\ndisobliging them. A harsh word damps my spirits to a degree of silencing\r\nall I have to say. I knew the folly of my own temper, and took the\r\nmethod of writing to the disposer of me. I said everything in this\r\nletter I thought proper to move him, and proffered, in atonement for not\r\nmarrying whom he would, never to marry at all. He did not think fit to\r\nanswer this letter, but sent for me to him. He told me he was very much\r\nsurprized that I did not depend on his judgment for my future happiness;\r\nthat he knew nothing I had to complain of, &c.; that he did not doubt I\r\nhad some other fancy in my head, which encouraged me to this\r\ndisobedience; but he assured me, if I refused a settlement he had\r\nprovided for me, he gave me his word, whatever proposals were made him,\r\nhe would never so much as enter into a treaty with any other; that, if I\r\nfounded any hopes upon his death, I should find myself mistaken, he\r\nnever intended to leave me anything but an annuity of £400 per annum;\r\nthat, though another would proceed in this manner after I had given so\r\njust a pretence for it, yet he had [the] goodness to leave my destiny\r\nyet in my own choice, and at the same time commanded me to communicate\r\nmy design to my relations, and ask their advice. As hard as this may\r\nsound, it did not shock my resolution; I was pleased to think, at any\r\nprice, I had it in my power to be free from a man I hated. I told my\r\nintention to all my nearest relations. I was surprised at their blaming\r\nit, to the greatest degree. I was told, they were sorry I would ruin\r\nmyself; but, if I was so unreasonable, they could not blame my F.\r\n[father] whatever he inflicted on me. I objected I did not love him.\r\nThey made answer, they found no necessity of loving; if I lived well\r\nwith him, that was all was required of me; and that if I considered this\r\ntown, I should find very few women in love with their husbands, and yet\r\na many happy. It was in vain to dispute with such prudent people; they\r\nlooked upon me as a little romantic, and I found it impossible to\r\npersuade them that living in London at liberty was not the height of\r\nhappiness. However, they could not change my thoughts, though I found I\r\nwas to expect no protection from them. When I was to give my final\r\nanswer to----, I told him that I preferred a single life to any other;\r\nand, if he pleased to permit me, I would take that resolution. He\r\nreplied, he could not hinder my resolutions, but I should not pretend\r\nafter that to please him; since pleasing him was only to be done by\r\nobedience; that if I would disobey, I knew the consequences; he would\r\nnot fail to confine me, where I might repent at leisure; that he had\r\nalso consulted my relations, and found them all agreeing in his\r\nsentiments. He spoke this in a manner hindered my answering. I retired\r\nto my chamber, where I writ a letter to let him know my aversion to the\r\nman proposed was too great to be overcome, that I should be miserable\r\nbeyond all things could be imagined, but I was in his hands, and he\r\nmight dispose of me as he thought fit. He was perfectly satisfied with\r\nthis answer, and proceeded as if I had given a willing consent.--I\r\nforgot to tell you, he named you, and said, if I thought that way, I was\r\nvery much mistaken; that if he had no other engagements, yet he would\r\nnever have agreed to your proposals, having no inclination to see his\r\ngrandchildren beggars.\r\n\r\n\"I do not speak this to endeavour to alter your opinion, but to shew the\r\nimprobability of his agreeing to it. I confess I am entirely of your\r\nmind. I reckon it among the absurdities of custom that a man must be\r\nobliged to settle his whole estate on an eldest son, beyond his power to\r\nrecall, whatever he proves to be, and make himself unable to make happy\r\na younger child that may deserve to be so. If I had an estate myself, I\r\nshould not make such ridiculous settlements, and I cannot blame you for\r\nbeing in the right.\r\n\r\n\"I have told you all my affairs with a plain sincerity. I have avoided\r\nto move your compassion, and I have said nothing of what I suffer; and I\r\nhave not persuaded you to a _treaty_, which I am sure my family will\r\nnever agree to. I can have no fortune without an entire obedience.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever your business is, may it end to your satisfaction. I think of\r\nthe public as you do. As little as _that_ is a woman's care, it may be\r\npermitted into the number of a woman's fears. But, wretched as I am, I\r\nhave no more to fear for myself. I have still a concern for my friends,\r\nand I am in pain for your danger. I am far from taking ill what you say,\r\nI never valued myself as the daughter of----, and ever despised those\r\nthat esteemed me on that account. With pleasure I could barter all that,\r\nand change to be any country gentleman's daughter that would have reason\r\nenough to make happiness in privacy. My letter is too long. I beg your\r\npardon. You may see by the situation of my affairs 'tis without design.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marriage with the gentleman unknown was thus called off--to the very\r\nconsiderable anger of Lord Dorchester. Lord Pierrepont wrote offering to\r\ncome to her aid, by representing to her father the hardship he was\r\ninflicting by endeavouring to force her inclination. He went so far as\r\nto say that he would assist her to marry a man of moderate means, if\r\nthere were such an one in her heart. She was little used to sympathy,\r\nand the proposal affected her deeply. \"The generosity and goodness of\r\nthis letter wholly determines my softest inclinations on your side,\" she\r\nwrote with unusual gentleness to Montagu on a Thursday night in August.\r\n\"You are in the wrong to suspect me of artifice; plainly showing me the\r\nkindness of your heart (if you have any there for me) is the surest way\r\nto touch mine, and I am at this minute more inclined to speak tenderly\r\nto you than ever I was in my life--so much inclined I will say nothing.\r\nI could wish you would leave England, but I know not how to object to\r\nanything that pleases you. In this minute I have no will that does not\r\nagree with yours.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a reference in the letter just printed to a meeting of Lady\r\nAnne and Montagu, but how often they saw each other at this time there\r\nis no knowing.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must have been in August that, failing the consent of Lord\r\nDorchester to their marriage, they made up their minds to elope. From\r\nwhom the suggestion first came, who can say? Let it be hoped for the\r\nsake of maiden modesty it came from Montagu. What drove them to this\r\nstep may well have been the fear that Lord Dorchester might, to all\r\nintents and purposes, imprison his daughter on one of his estates. Even\r\nat the eleventh hour, Lady Mary was determined that there should be no\r\nmisunderstanding between her and her _fiancé_. She wrote to him saying\r\nthat if she came to him in this way, she would come to him without a\r\nportion. To this part of her letter he vouchsafed no reply, so she again\r\ntouched upon the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You made no reply to one part of my letter concerning my fortune. I am\r\nafraid you flatter yourself that my F. [father] may be at length\r\nreconciled and brought to reasonable terms. I am convinced, by what I\r\nhave often heard him say, speaking of other cases like this, he never\r\nwill. The fortune he has engaged to give with me, was settled on my B.\r\n[brother]'s marriage, on my sister and on myself; but in such a manner,\r\nthat it was left in his power to give it all to either of us, or divide\r\nas he thought fit. He has given it all to me. Nothing remains for my\r\nsister, but the free bounty of my F. [father] from what he can save;\r\nwhich, notwithstanding the greatness of his estate, may be very little.\r\nPossibly, after I have disobliged him so much, he may be glad to have\r\nher so easily provided for, with money already raised; especially if he\r\nhas a design to marry himself, as I hear. I do not speak this that you\r\nshould not endeavour to come to terms with him, if you please; but I am\r\nfully persuaded it will be to no purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary assured Montagu that Lord Dorchester's attitude was this: She\r\nhad consented to an engagement with another man, that she had let him\r\nincur an expenditure of some four hundred pounds for a trousseau, and\r\nthat, by breaking it off, had made him look foolish. In fact, her\r\nfather, she added, had given her clearly to understand that he would\r\nentertain no dealings whatsoever with any suitor other than the one of\r\nhis choice, that he would send her to his estate in the north of\r\nEngland, and that it was his intention to leave her, on his death, only\r\nan annuity of four hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAs a good sportsman she at the last moment gave Montagu a chance to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He [my father] will have a thousand plausible reasons for being\r\nirreconcileable, and 'tis very probable the world will be of his side.\r\nReflect now for the last time in what manner you must take me. I shall\r\ncome to you with only a night-gown and petticoat, and that is all you\r\nwill get with me. I told a lady of my friends what I intended to do. You\r\nwill think her a very good friend when I tell you she has proffered to\r\nlend us her house if we would come there the first night. I did not\r\naccept of this till I had let you know it. If you think it more\r\nconvenient to carry me to your lodgings, make no scruple of it. Let it\r\nbe where it will: if I am your wife I shall think no place unfit for me\r\nwhere you are. I beg we may leave London next morning, wherever you\r\nintend to go. I should wish to go out of England if it suits with your\r\naffairs. You are the best judge of your father's temper. If you think it\r\nwould be obliging to him, or necessary for you, I will go with you\r\nimmediately to ask his pardon and his blessing. If that is not proper at\r\nfirst, I think the best scheme is going to the Spa. When you come back,\r\nyou may endeavour to make your father admit of seeing me, and treat with\r\nmine (thought I persist in thinking it will be to no purpose). But I\r\ncannot think of living in the midst of my relations and acquaintance\r\nafter so unjustifiable a step:--unjustifiable to the world,--but I think\r\nI can justify myself to myself. I again beg you to hire a coach to be at\r\nthe door early Monday morning, to carry us some part of our way,\r\nwherever you resolve our journey shall be. If you determine to go to\r\nthat lady's house, you had better come with a coach and six at seven\r\no'clock to-morrow. She and I will be in the balcony that looks on the\r\nroad: you have nothing to do but to stop under it, and we will come down\r\nto you. Do in this what you like best. After all, think very seriously.\r\nYour letter, which will be waited for, is to determine everything. I\r\nforgive you a coarse expression in your last, which, however, I wish had\r\nnot been there. You might have said something like it without expressing\r\nit in that manner; but there was so much complaisance in the rest of it\r\nI ought to be satisfied. You can shew me no goodness I shall not be\r\nsensible of. However, think again, and resolve never to think of me if\r\nyou have the least doubt, or that it is likely to make you uneasy in\r\nyour fortune. I believe to travel is the most likely way to make a\r\nsolitude agreeable, and not tiresome: remember you have promised it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in this hour of excitement Lady Mary did not lose her head, and she\r\nasked for a settlement that would make her easy in her mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tis something odd for a woman that brings nothing to expect anything;\r\nbut after the way of my education, I dare not pretend to live but in\r\nsome degree suitable to it. I had rather die than return to a dependancy\r\nupon relations I have disobliged. Save me from that fear if you love me.\r\nIf you cannot, or think I ought not to expect it, be sincere and tell me\r\nso. 'Tis better I should not be yours at all, than, for a short\r\nhappiness, involve myself in ages of misery. I hope there will never be\r\noccasion for this precaution; but, however, 'tis necessary to make it. I\r\ndepend entirely on your honour, and I cannot suspect you of any way\r\ndoing wrong. Do not imagine I shall be angry at anything you can tell\r\nme. Let it be sincere; do not impose on a woman that leaves all things\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo woman could be more sensible than was Lady Mary at this time, and\r\nshe gave expression to the most exemplary sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A woman that adds nothing to a man's fortune ought not to take from his\r\nhappiness. If possible I would add to it; but I will not take from you\r\nany satisfaction you could enjoy without me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we marry, our happiness must consist in loving one another: 'tis\r\nprincipally my concern to think of the most probable method of making\r\nthe love eternal.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one article absolutely necessary--to be ever beloved, one must\r\nbe ever agreeable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very few people that have settled entirely in the country but have\r\ngrown at length weary of one another. The lady's conversation generally\r\nfalls into a thousand impertinent effects of idleness, and the gentleman\r\nfalls _in_ love with his dogs and horses and _out_ of love with\r\neverything else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\nPossibly if Lady Mary had had less brains and more passion, if she had\r\nnot so calmly worked out the permutations and combinations of married\r\nlife, the alliance might have been more successful. She, with all her\r\nintelligence, did not seem to realise that matrimony is not an affair of\r\nrules and regulations, of aphorisms and epigrams, nor that the lines on\r\nwhich husband and wife shall conduct themselves to a happy ending can be\r\nsettled by a study of vulgar fractions.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the plunge was at last taken--with some not unnatural\r\ntrepidation on the part of the twenty-three-year-old bride. On Friday\r\nnight, August 15, 1712, she wrote to Montagu:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I tremble for what we are doing.--Are you sure you will love me for\r\never? Shall we never repent? I fear and I hope. I forsee all that will\r\nhappen on this occasion. I shall incense my family in the highest\r\ndegree. The generality of the world will blame my conduct, and the\r\nrelations and friends of ---- will invent a thousand stories of me; yet,\r\n'tis possible, you may recompense everything to me. In this letter,\r\nwhich I am fond of, you promise me all that I wish. Since I writ so far,\r\nI received your Friday letter. I will be only yours, and I will do what\r\nyou please.\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear from me again to-morrow, not to contradict, but to give\r\nsome directions. My resolution is taken. Love me and use me well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wedding licence is dated August 16, and the marriage took place in a\r\nday or two.\r\n\r\nThe bride had the active assistance of her uncle, William Feilding, who\r\nmay have been present at the ceremony; and the full sympathy of her\r\nbrother, Lord Kingston, who, however, did not accompany her, perhaps\r\ndeeming it impolitic to quarrel with his father.\r\n\r\nThe family must have thought that Lord Dorchester would examine Lady\r\nMary's papers, for her sister, Lady Frances destroyed all she could\r\nfind, including, unfortunately, a diary that Lady Mary had kept for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEARLY MARRIED LIFE (1712-1714)\r\n\r\nAn uneventful existence--Montagu's Parliamentary duties take him to\r\nLondon--Lady Mary stays mostly in the country--Correspondence--Montagu a\r\ncareless husband, but very careful of his money--Later he becomes a\r\nmiser--Lady Mary does not disguise the tedium of her existence--\r\nConcerning a possible reconciliation with her father--Lord Pierrepont\r\nof Hanslope--Lord Halifax--Birth of a son, christened after his father,\r\nEdward Wortley Montagu--The mother's anxiety about his health--Family\r\nevents--Lady Evelyn Pierrepont marries Baron (afterwards Earl) Gower--Lady\r\nFrances Pierrepont marries the Earl of Mar--Lord Dorchester marries\r\nagain--Has issue, two daughters--the death of Lady Mary's brother,\r\nWilliam--His son, Evelyn, in due course succeeds to the Dukedom of\r\nKingston--Elizabeth Chudleigh--The political situation in 1714--The death\r\nof Queen Anne--The accession of George I--The unrest in the country--\r\nLady Mary's alarm for her son.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe records for the first years of the married life of Edward and Lady\r\nMary Wortley Montagu are scanty indeed. From the wedding day until 1716,\r\nwhen they went abroad, Lady Mary's life was, for months together, as\r\nuneventful as that of the ordinary suburban housewife. Montagu's\r\nparliamentary duties took him frequently to town, and kept him there for\r\nprolonged periods, during which he certainly showed no strong desire for\r\nher to join him. Lady Mary, indeed, spent most of the time in the\r\ncountry. Sometimes she stayed at the seat of her father-in-law,\r\nWharncliffe Lodge, near Sheffield; occasionally she visited Lord\r\nSandwich at Hinchinbrooke; for a while they stayed at Middlethorpe, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Bishopthorpe and York. From time to time they hired\r\nhouses in other parts of Yorkshire. The honeymoon lasted from August\r\nuntil October, 1712, when Montagu had to go to Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe first letter of this period is dated characteristically: \"Walling\r\nWells, October 22, which is the first post I could write. Monday night\r\nbeing so fatigued and sick I went straight to bed from the coach.\" It\r\nstarts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't know very well how to begin; I am perfectly unacquainted with a\r\nproper matrimonial stile. After all, I think 'tis best to write as if we\r\nwere not married at all. I lament your absence, as if you were still my\r\nlover, and I am impatient to hear you are got safe to Durham, and that\r\nyou have fixed a time for your return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMarriage made Lady Mary more human. She no longer dwelt upon the various\r\npoints that in her maidenhood days she had thought would be conducive to\r\nhappiness in matrimonial life; she was now, anyhow for the moment, in\r\nlove with her husband, or at least persuaded herself that this was the\r\ncase, and was at pains to inform him of the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have not been very long in this family; and I fancy myself in that\r\ndescribed in the 'Spectator,'\" the letter of October 22 continues. \"The\r\ngood people here look upon their children with a fondness that more than\r\nrecompenses their care of them. I don't perceive much distinction in\r\nregard to their merits; and when they speak sense or nonsense, it\r\naffects the parents with almost the same pleasure. My friendship for the\r\nmother, and kindness for Miss Biddy, make me endure the squalling of\r\nMiss Nanny and Miss Mary with abundance of patience: and my foretelling\r\nthe future conquests of the eldest daughter, makes me very well with the\r\nfamily.--I don't know whether you will presently find out that this\r\nseeming impertinent account is the tenderest expressions of my love to\r\nyou; but it furnishes my imagination with agreeable pictures of our\r\nfuture life; and I flatter myself with the hopes of one day enjoying\r\nwith you the same satisfactions; and that, after as many years\r\ntogether, I may see you retain the same fondness for me as I shall\r\ncertainly mine for you, and the noise of a nursery may have more charms\r\nfor us than the music of an opera.\r\n\r\n[_Torn_] \"as these are the sure effect of my sincere love, since 'tis\r\nthe nature of that passion to entertain the mind with pleasures in\r\nprospect; and I check myself when I grieve for your absence, by\r\nremembering how much reason I have to rejoice in the hope of passing my\r\nwhole life with you. A good fortune not to be valued!--I am afraid of\r\ntelling you that I return thanks for it to Heaven, because you will\r\ncharge me with hypocrisy; but you are mistaken: I assist every day at\r\npublic prayers in this family, and never forget in my private\r\nejaculation how much I owe to Heaven for making me yours. 'Tis\r\ncandle-light, or I should not conclude so soon.\r\n\r\n\"Pray, my dear, begin at the top, and read till you come to the bottom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMontagu, for his part, was somewhat careless as regards correspondence--for\r\nwhich offence she rebuked him more than once, but in the most flattering\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am at present in so much uneasiness, my letter is not likely to be\r\nintelligible, if it all resembles the confusion of my head. I sometimes\r\nimagine you not well, and sometimes that you think of it small\r\nimportance to write, or that greater matters have taken up your\r\nthoughts. This last imagination is too cruel for me. I will rather fancy\r\nyour letter has miscarried, though I find little probability to think\r\nso. I know not what to think, and am very near being distracted, amongst\r\nmy variety of dismal apprehensions. I am very ill company to the good\r\npeople of the house, who all bid me make you their compliments. Mr.\r\nWhite begins your health twice every day. You don't deserve all this if\r\nyou can be so entirely forgetful of all this part of the world. I am\r\npeevish with you by fits, and divide my time between anger and sorrow,\r\nwhich are equaly troublesome to me. 'Tis the most cruel thing in the\r\nworld, to think one has reason to complain of what one loves. How can\r\nyou be so careless?--is it because you don't love writing? You should\r\nremember I want to know you are safe at Durham. I shall imagine you have\r\nhad some fall from your horse, or ill accident by the way, without\r\nregard to probability; there is nothing too extravagant for a woman's\r\nand a lover's fears. Did you receive my last letter? if you did not, the\r\ndirection is wrong, you won't receive this, and my question is in vain.\r\nI find I begin to talk nonsense, and 'tis time to leave off. Pray, my\r\ndear, write to me, or I shall be very mad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMontagu was, not to put too fine a point on it, a careless husband. Not\r\nonly did he neglect to write to his wife, but he neglected, or forgot,\r\nto keep her adequately supplied with money. She had more than once to\r\nremind him of this. \"I wish you would write again to Mr. Phipps, for I\r\ndon't hear of any money, and am in the utmost necessity for it,\" she\r\ntold him in November, 1712. Montagu, even at this time a well-to-do man,\r\nfound it difficult to part with his money. A couple of years later, Lady\r\nMary had again to say to him: \"Pray order me some money, for I am in\r\ngreat want, and must run into debt if you don't do it soon.\" Even in\r\nthese days Montagu evidently had begun to be miserly. With all his\r\nriches, he never spent a crown when a smaller sum would suffice, and\r\nduring most of his life he, as Sir Leslie Stephen put it, \"devoted\r\nhimself chiefly to saving money.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1712, Lady Mary, who was with child, suffered much from\r\nill-health, and this was to some extent aggravated by intense boredom,\r\nalthough of that boredom she wrote good-humouredly enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe you expect to hear from me so soon, if I remember you\r\ndid not so much as desire it, but I will not be so nice to quarrel with\r\nyou on that point; perhaps you would laugh at that delicacy, which is,\r\nhowever, an attendant of a tender friendship,\" she wrote to her husband\r\nfrom Hinchinbrooke at the beginning of December, 1712.\r\n\r\n\"I opened the closet where I expected to find so many books; to my great\r\ndisappointment there were only some few pieces of the law, and folios of\r\nmathematics; my Lord Hinchinbrook and Mr. Twiman having disposed of the\r\nrest. But as there is no affliction, no more than no happiness, without\r\nalloy, I discovered an old trunk of papers, which to my great diversion\r\nI found to be the letters of the first Earl of Sandwich; and am in hopes\r\nthat those from his lady will tend much to my edification, being the\r\nmost extraordinary lessons of economy that ever I read in my life. To\r\nthe glory of your father, I find that _his_ looked upon him as destined\r\nto be the honour of the family.\r\n\r\n\"I walked yesterday two hours on the terrace. These are the most\r\nconsiderable events that have happened in your absence; excepting that a\r\ngood-natured robin red-breast kept me company almost all the afternoon\r\nwith so much good humour and humanity as gives me faith for the piece of\r\ncharity ascribed to these little creatures in the Children in the Wood,\r\nwhich I have hitherto thought only a poetical ornament to that history.\r\n\r\n\"I expect a letter next post to tell me you are well in London and that\r\nyour business will not detain you long from her that cannot be happy\r\nwithout you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in these early days of marriage Montagu seemed to have no love for\r\ndomestic life, and often he stayed in London when he could have been in\r\nthe country with his wife, or had her with him in town. \"As much as you\r\nsay I love the town, if you think it necessary for your interest to stay\r\nsome time here, I would not advise you to neglect a certainty for an\r\nuncertainty? but I believe if you pass the Christmas here, great matters\r\nwill be expected from your hospitality: however, you are a better judge\r\nthan I am.\" So Lady Mary wrote from Hinchinbrooke in the first week of\r\nDecember. She did not disguise from him the tedium of her existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I continue indifferently well, and endeavour as much as I can to\r\npreserve myself from spleen and melancholy; not for my own sake; I think\r\nthat of little importance; but in the condition I am, I believe it may\r\nbe of very ill consequence; yet, passing whole days alone as I do, I do\r\nnot always find it possible, and my constitution will sometimes get the\r\nbetter of my reason. Human nature itself, without any additional\r\nmisfortunes, furnishes disagreeable meditations enough. Life itself to\r\nmake it supportable, should not be considered too near; my reason\r\nrepresents to me in vain the inutility of serious reflections. The idle\r\nmind will sometimes fall into contemplations that serve for nothing but\r\nto ruin the health, destroy good humour, hasten old age and wrinkles,\r\nand bring on an habitual melancholy. 'Tis a maxim with me to be young as\r\nlong as one can: there is nothing can pay one for that invaluable\r\nignorance which is the companion of youth; those sanguine groundless\r\nhopes, and that lively vanity, which make all the happiness of life. To\r\nmy extreme mortification I grow wiser every day than other [sic]. I\r\ndon't believe Solomon was more convinced of the vanity of temporal\r\naffairs than I am; I lose all taste of this world, and I suffer myself\r\nto be bewitched by the charms of the spleen, though I know and foresee\r\nall the irremediable mischiefs arising from it. I am insensibly fallen\r\ninto the writing you a melancholy letter, after all my resolutions to\r\nthe contrary; but I do not enjoin you to read it: make no scruple of\r\nflinging it into the fire at the first dull line. Forgive the ill\r\neffects of my solitude, and think me as I am,\r\n\r\n\"Ever yours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was still hope in the hearts of Lady Mary and her husband that it\r\nmight be possible to effect a reconciliation with Lord Dorchester. Since\r\napparently the Marquess was not directly approachable by either of them,\r\nthey perforce had to seek an intermediary. Such an one, they trusted at\r\none time, would be one of Lady Mary's relatives, Lord Pierrepont of\r\nHanslope. To this matter there are many allusions in the correspondence,\r\n\"The Bishop of Salisbury writes me word that he hears my Lord Pierrepont\r\ndeclares very much for us,\" Lady Mary wrote from Hinchinbrooke early in\r\nDecember to her husband in town. \"As the Bishop is no infallible\r\nprelate, I should not depend much on that intelligence; but my sister\r\nFrances tells me the same thing. Since it is so, I believe you'll think\r\nit very proper to pay him a visit, if he is in town, and give him thanks\r\nfor the good offices you hear he has endeavoured to do me, unasked. If\r\nhis kindness is sincere, 'tis too valuable to be neglected. However, the\r\nvery appearance of it may be of use to us. If I know him, his desire of\r\nmaking my Father appear in the wrong, will make him zealous for us. I\r\nthink I ought to write him a letter of acknowledgment for what I hear he\r\nhas already done.\" Very shortly after, however, it appears that Lord\r\nPierrepont was a broken reed upon which to rely. \"I did not expect,\" Lady\r\nMary said bitterly, \"that my Lord Pierrepont would speak at all in our\r\nfavour, much less show zeal upon that occasion, that never showed any in\r\nhis life.\" You cannot put it plainer than that.\r\n\r\nOne who did really endeavour to bring about the resumption of friendly\r\nrelations was Montagu's cousin, Charles Montagu, first Baron Halifax of\r\nHalifax, who was afterwards created first Earl of Halifax.\r\n\r\nTo judge from Lady Mary's comments, sometimes when Montagu did write it\r\nhad been better he should not have done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am alone, without any amusements to take up my thoughts. I am in\r\ncircumstances in which melancholy is apt to prevail even over all\r\namusements, dispirited and alone, and you write me quarrelling letters,\"\r\nshe rebuked him on one occasion.\r\n\r\n\"I hate complaining; 'tis no sign I am easy that I do not trouble you\r\nwith my head-aches, and my spleen; to be reasonable one should never\r\ncomplain but when one hopes redress. A physician should be the only\r\nconfidant of bodily pains; and for those of the mind, they should never\r\nbe spoke of but to them that can and will relieve 'em. Should I tell you\r\nthat I am uneasy, that I am out of humour, and out of patience, should I\r\nsee you half an hour the sooner? I believe you have kindness enough for\r\nme to be very sorry, and so you would tell me; and things remain in\r\ntheir primitive state; I chuse to spare you that pain; I would always\r\ngive you pleasure. I know you are ready to tell me that I do not ever\r\nkeep to these good maxims. I confess I often speak impertinently, but I\r\nalways repent of it. My last stupid letter was not come to you, before I\r\nwould have had it back again had it been in my power; such as it was, I\r\nbeg your pardon for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 1713, Lady Mary was delivered of a boy, who was christened after\r\nhis father, Edward Wortley Montagu. Some account of his unsatisfactory\r\ncareer will be given in a later chapter. As an infant, he suffered from\r\nill-health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am in abundance of pain about our dear child: though I am convinced\r\nin my reason 'tis both silly and wicked to set one's heart too fondly on\r\nanything in this world, yet I cannot overcome myself so far as to think\r\nof parting with him with the resignation that I ought to do,\" the mother\r\nwrote from Middlethorpe at the end of July. \"I hope and I beg of God he\r\nmay live to be a comfort to us both. They tell me there is nothing\r\nextraordinary in want of teeth at his age, but his weakness makes me\r\nvery apprehensive; he is almost never out of my sight. Mrs. Behn says\r\nthat the cold bath is the best medicine for weak children, but I am very\r\nfearful and unwilling to try any hazardous remedies. He is very cheerful\r\nand full of play.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope the child is better than he was,\" she mentioned a little later;\r\n\"but I wish you would let Dr. Garth know he has a bigness in his joints,\r\nbut not much; his ankles seem chiefly to have a weakness. I should be\r\nvery glad of his advice upon it, and whether he approves rubbing them\r\nwith spirits, which I am told is good for him.\" Then came more\r\nfavourable news about young Edward. \"I thank God this cold well agrees\r\nwith the child; and he seems stronger and better every day,\" Lady Mary\r\nwas able to report. \"But I should be very glad, if you saw Dr. Garth, if\r\nyou asked his opinion concerning the use of cold baths for young\r\nchildren. I hope you love the child as well as I do; but if you love me\r\nat all, you'll desire the preservation of his health, for I should\r\ncertainly break my heart for him.\" Garth, it may be assumed, was the\r\nfamous Samuel Garth, afterwards physician-in-ordinary to George I and\r\nauthor of _The Dispensary_. His views on cold baths for children of\r\nfifteen months have not been handed down to posterity by Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime things were happening in the Pierrepont family. Lady Mary's\r\nsister, Lady Frances, had, on March 8, 1712, married John, second Baron\r\nGower, who afterwards was created Earl Gower. Lady Mary's other sister,\r\nLady Evelyn, on July 26, 1714, became the second wife of John Erskine,\r\nsixth or eleventh Earl of Mar of the Erskine line, who presently came\r\ninto prominence as an adherent of the Pretender in the rebellion of '15,\r\nafter which he fled the country. He was created Duke of Mar by the\r\nPretender. Finally, the Marquess of Dorchester, being then in his\r\nfiftieth year, took for his second wife, on August 2, 1714, Lady\r\nIsabella Bentinck, fifth daughter of William, first Earl of Portland and\r\nhis first wife, Anne, sister of Edward, first Earl of Jersey. There was\r\nissue of this marriage two daughters: Caroline, who married Thomas\r\nBrand, of Kempton, Hertfordshire; and Anne, who died unmarried in 1739\r\nat the age of twenty.\r\n\r\nAlready, on July 1, 1723, had died Lord Dorchester's only son and heir,\r\nWilliam, who took the style of Earl of Kingston. He had married Rachel,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Baynton, of Little Chalfield, Wiltshire, by whom he\r\nhad one son, named Evelyn, after his grandfather, whom he succeeded in\r\n1726 as the second Duke of Kingston.\r\n\r\nThe career of Evelyn was undistinguished. Born in 1711, his aunt, Lady\r\nMary, said of him at the age of fifteen: \"The Duke of Kingston has\r\nhitherto had so ill an education, 'tis hard to make any judgment of him;\r\nhe has his spirit, but I fear will never have his father's sense. As\r\nyoung gentlemen go, 'tis possible he may make a good figure among them.\"\r\nThan which it would be unkind to say anything more cutting. Of course,\r\nhonours came to him. He was created Knight of the Garter in 1741, in\r\nwhich year he was appointed a Lord of the Bedchamber. He rose to the\r\nrank of colonel in the army in 1745, and twenty-seven years later was\r\npromoted General; but it does not appear that he saw any service. The\r\nsecond Duke of Kingston will, however, always be remembered for his\r\nmarriage in 1769 with the beautiful and notorious Elizabeth Chudleigh,\r\nwho was nine years his junior. She had in 1744 married secretly Augustus\r\nJohn Hervey, afterwards sixth Earl of Bristol, who survived until\r\nDecember, 1779. She had long been living with the Duke, but in 1769 she\r\nobtained a divorce _a mensa et thoro_, which she believed erroneously\r\nannulled the marriage. The Duke died in 1773, when all his titles became\r\nextinct. His Duchess was in the following year tried before the House of\r\nLords for bigamy, found guilty, but, pleading benefit of peerage, was\r\ndischarged. Thus, she carried out the prognostication of Lord Chief\r\nJustice Mansfield, who had opposed the prosecution. \"The arguments about\r\nthe place of trial suggest to my mind the question about the propriety\r\nof any trial at all,\" he said in a debate in the House of Lords. \"_Cui\r\nbono_? What utility is to be obtained? Suppose a conviction to be the\r\nresult?--the lady makes your lordships a courtesy, and you return a\r\nbow.\" She survived, living on the continent, until 1788. As an epitaph\r\nfor her there can be nothing better than a remark of Horace Walpole: \"I\r\ncan tell you nothing more extraordinary, nor would any history figure\r\nnear hers. It shows genius to strike anything so new as her\r\nachievements. Though we have many uncommon personages, it is not easy\r\nfor them to be so superiorly particular.\"\r\n\r\nMore generally interesting than these domestic matters was the political\r\nsituation. Queen Anne's life had for some time been hanging in the\r\nbalance. It was thought that she might linger for some time, but there\r\nwas no hope of her recovery. The fight that was carried on between the\r\nsupporters of the Hanoverian succession and the adherents of the\r\nPretender is, of course, a matter of history. On August 5, 1714, came to\r\nthe Elector of Hanover, James Craggs, junior, with a letter from the\r\nPrivy Council, dated July 31, announcing the precarious state of Anne's\r\nhealth, and conveying assurances that in the event of her demise every\r\nprecaution would be taken to safeguard the rights of George Lewis. The\r\nsame night messengers arrived at Hanover from London with the news of\r\nthe death of the Queen, who had passed away on July 31, shortly after\r\nthe departure of Craggs.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval between the proclamation of the accession of George\r\nI and his arrival, which did not take place until September 17, the\r\ncountry was in a disturbed state, and it is not unnatural that Lady Mary\r\nin Yorkshire was alarmed for the safety of herself and the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forbear taking it something unkindly that you do not write to\r\nme, when you may be assured I am in a great fright, and know not\r\ncertainly what to expect upon this sudden change,\" she wrote from\r\nMiddlethorpe to Montagu. \"The Archbishop of York has been come to\r\nBishopthorpe but three days. I went with my cousin to-day to see the\r\nKing proclaimed, which was done; the Archbishop walking next the Lord\r\nMayor, all the country gentry following, with greater crowds of people\r\nthan I believed to be in York, vast acclamations, and the appearance of\r\na general satisfaction. The Pretender afterwards dragged about the\r\nstreets and burned. Ringing of bells, bonfires, and illuminations, the\r\nmob crying Liberty and Property! and Long live King George! This morning\r\nall the principal men of any figure took post for London, and we are\r\nalarmed with the fear of attempts from Scotland, though all Protestants\r\nseem unanimous for the Hanover succession. The poor young ladies at\r\nCastle Howard are as much afraid as I am, being left all alone, without\r\nany hopes of seeing their father again (though things should prove well)\r\nthis eight or nine months. They have sent to desire me very earnestly to\r\ncome to them, and bring my boy; 'tis the same thing as pensioning in a\r\nnunnery, for no mortal man ever enters the doors in the absence of their\r\nfather, who is gone post. During this uncertainty, I think it will be a\r\nsafe retreat; for Middlethorpe stands exposed to plunderers, if there be\r\nany at all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA day or two later this letter was followed by another:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You made me cry two hours last night. I cannot imagine why you use me\r\nso ill; for what reason you continue silent, when you know at any time\r\nyour silence cannot fail of giving me a great deal of pain; and now to a\r\nhigher degree because of the perplexity that I am in, without knowing\r\nwhere you are, what you are doing, or what to do with myself and my dear\r\nlittle boy. However (persuaded there can be no objection to it), I\r\nintend to go to-morrow to Castle Howard, and remain there with the young\r\nladies, 'till I know when I shall see you, or what you would command.\r\nThe Archbishop and everybody else are gone to London. We are alarmed\r\nwith a story of a fleet being seen from the coasts of Scotland. An\r\nexpress went from thence through York to the Earl of Mar. I beg you\r\nwould write to me. 'Till you do I shall not have an easy minute. I am\r\nsure I do not deserve from you that you should make me uneasy. I find I\r\nam scolding, 'tis better for me not to trouble you with it; but I cannot\r\nhelp taking your silence very unkindly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ACCESSION OF GEORGE I (1714)\r\n\r\nLady Mary shows an increasing interest in politics--She tries to incite\r\nher husband to be ambitious--Montagu not returned to the new\r\nParliament--His lack of energy--Correspondence--The Council of\r\nRegency--The King commands Lord Townshend to form a Government--The\r\nCabinet--Lord Halifax, First Lord of the Treasury--Montagu appointed a\r\nLord Commissioner of the Treasury--Correspondence--The unsatisfactory\r\nrelations between Lady Mary and Montagu.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of the death of Queen Anne Lady Mary began to show an\r\nincreased interest in polities, at least in so far as the career of\r\nMontagu was bound up with it. She began to try to persuade her husband\r\nto be, to some extent at least, ambitious. It may be that she was not\r\nhappy at the thought of being married to a man who was regarded as a\r\nnonentity. She was always urging him to put his best foot forward.\r\nSometimes she wrote to him as to a naughty child. \"I am very much\r\nsurprised that you do not tell me in your last letter that you have\r\nspoke to my Father,\" she said in August, 1714. \"I hope after staying in\r\nthe town on purpose, you do not intend to omit it. I beg you would not\r\nleave any sort of business unfinished, remembering those two necessary\r\nmaxims, Whatever you intend to do as long as you live do as soon as you\r\ncan; and to leave nothing to be done by another that 'tis possible to do\r\nyourself.\" What sort of a man must Montagu have been at the age of\r\nthirty-six that his wife should deem it necessary to give him such\r\nfirst-aid advice?\r\n\r\nMontagu was evidently of a procrastinating turn of mind. He had, as has\r\nbeen said, sat for Huntingdon in the House of Commons from 1705 until\r\n1713. In the latter year Parliament was dissolved on August 8, but\r\nMontagu had made no definite plans as regards his future political\r\ncareer--for some reason or other his father reserved for himself the\r\nseat for Huntingdon. Montagu found no other constituency, and\r\nconsequently did not sit in the new Parliament that assembled on the\r\nfollowing November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you may now come in at Aldburgh, and I heartily wish you was\r\nin Parliament,\" Lady Mary wrote to him. \"I saw the Archbishop [of\r\nYork]'s list of the Lords Regents appointed, and perceive Lord Wharton\r\nis not one of them; by which I guess the new scheme is not to make use\r\nof any man grossly infamous in either party; consequently, those who\r\nhave been honest in regard to both, will stand fairest for preferment.\r\nYou understand these things much better than me; but I hope you will be\r\npersuaded by me and your other friends (who I don't doubt will be of\r\nopinion) that 'tis necessary for the common good for an honest man to\r\nendeavour to be powerful, when he can be the one without losing the\r\nfirst more valuable title; and remember that money is the source of\r\npower. I hear that Parliament sits but six months; you know best whether\r\n'tis worth any expense or bustle to be in for so short a time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary's letters now contain many references to political affairs,\r\nanyhow in so far as they directly concern Montagu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are convinced I was not mistaken in my judgment of Lord\r\nPelham; he is very silly but very good-natured. I don't see how it can\r\nbe improper for you to get it represented to him that he is obliged in\r\nhonour to get you chose at Aldburgh, and may more easily get Mr. Jessop\r\nchose at another place. I can't believe but you may manage it in such a\r\nmanner, Mr. Jessop himself would not be against it, nor would he have so\r\nmuch reason to take it ill, if he should not be chose, as you have after\r\nso much money fruitlessly spent. I dare say you may order it so that it\r\nmay be so, if you talk to Lord Townshend about it, &c. I mention this,\r\nbecause I cannot think you can stand at York, or anywhere else, without\r\na great expense. Lord Morpeth is just now of age, but I know not whether\r\nhe'll think it worth while to return from travel upon that occasion.\r\nLord Carlisle is in town, you may if you think fit make him a visit, and\r\nenquire concerning it. After all, I look upon Aldburgh to be the surest\r\nthing. Lord Pelham is easily persuaded to any thing, and I am sure he\r\nmay be told by Lord Townshend that he has used you ill; and I know he'll\r\nbe desirous to do all things in his power to make it up. In my opinion,\r\nif yon resolve upon an extraordinary expense to be in Parliament, you\r\nshould resolve to have it turn to some account. Your father is very\r\nsurprizing if he persists in standing at Huntingdon; but there is\r\nnothing surprizing in such a world as this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLater in August Lady Mary wrote again on the same subject, and this\r\nletter shows that she had been at pains to acquire some practical\r\nknowledge of borough-mongering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You seem not to have received my letters, or not to have understood\r\nthem; you had been chose undoubtedly at York, if you had declared in\r\ntime; but there is not any gentleman or tradesman disengaged at this\r\ntime; they are treating every night. Lord Carlisle and the Thompsons\r\nhave given their interest to Mr. Jenkins. I agree with you of the\r\nnecessity of your standing this Parliament, which, perhaps, may be more\r\nconsiderable than any that are to follow it; but, as you proceed, 'tis\r\nmy opinion, you will spend your money and not be chose. I believe there\r\nis hardly a borough unengaged. I expect every letter should tell me you\r\nare sure of some place; and, as far as I can perceive you are sure of\r\nnone. As it has been managed, perhaps it will be the best way to deposit\r\na certain sum in some friend's hands, and buy some little Cornish\r\nborough: it would, undoubtedly, look better to be chose for a\r\nconsiderable town; but I take it to be now too late. If you have any\r\nthoughts of Newark, it will be absolutely necessary for you to enquire\r\nafter Lord Lexington's interest; and your best way to apply yourself to\r\nLord Holdernesse, who is both a Whig and an honest man. He is now in\r\ntown, and you may enquire of him if Brigadier Sutton stands there; and\r\nif not, try to engage him for you. Lord Lexington is so ill at the Bath,\r\nthat it is a doubt if he will live 'till the election; and if he dies,\r\none of his heiresses, and the whole interest of his estate, will\r\nprobably fall on Lord Holdernesse.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a surprise to me that you cannot make sure of some borough, when\r\nso many of your friends bring in several Parliament-men without trouble\r\nor expense. 'Tis too late to mention it now, but you might have applied\r\nto Lady Winchester, as Sir Joseph Jekyl did last year, and by her\r\ninterest the Duke of Bolton brought him in for nothing; I am sure she\r\nwould be more zealous to serve me than Lady Jekyl. You should understand\r\nthese things better than me. I heard, by a letter last post, that Lady\r\nM. Montagu and Lady Hinchinbrooke are to be Bedchamber Ladies to the\r\nPrincess, and Lady Townshend Groom of the Stole. She must be a strange\r\nPrincess if she can pick a favourite out of them; and as she will be one\r\nday Queen, and they say has an influence over her husband, I wonder they\r\ndon't think fit to place women about her with a little common sense.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, in the middle of September Lady Mary returned to the subject of\r\nMontagu finding a seat in the House:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot be very sorry for your declining at Newark, being very\r\nuncertain of your success; but I am surprized you do not mention where\r\nyou intend to stand. Dispatch, in things of this nature, if not a\r\nsecurity, at least delay is a sure way to lose, as you have done, being\r\neasily chose at York, for not resolving in time, and Aldburgh, for not\r\napplying soon enough to Lord Pelham. Here are people here had rather\r\nchoose Fairfax than Jenkins, and others that prefer Jenkins to Fairfax;\r\nbut both parties, separately, have wished to me you would have stood,\r\nwith assurances of having preferred you to either of them. At Newark,\r\nLord Lexington has a very considerable interest. If you have any\r\nthoughts of standing, you must endeavour to know how he stands affected;\r\nthough I am afraid he will assist Brigadier Sutton, or some other Tory.\r\nSir Matthew Jenison has the best interest of any Whig; but he stood last\r\nyear himself, and will, perhaps, do so again. Newdigate will certainly\r\nbe chose there for one. Upon the whole, 'tis the most expensive and\r\nuncertain place you can stand at. Tis surprizing to me, that you are all\r\nthis while in the midst of your friends without being sure of a place,\r\nwhen so many insignificant creatures come in without any opposition.\r\nThey say Mr. Strickland is sure at Carlisle, where he never stood\r\nbefore. I believe most places are engaged by this time. I am very sorry,\r\nfor your sake, that you spent so much money in vain last year, and will\r\nnot come in this, when you might make a more considerable figure than\r\nyou could have done then. I wish Lord Pelham would compliment Mr. Jessop\r\nwith his Newark interest, and let you come in at Aldburgh.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Queen, the Council, which had assembled at\r\nKensington Palace, adjourned to St. James's. By the Regency Bill the\r\nadministration of the government (in the event of the King being absent\r\nfrom the realm at the time of his accession to the throne) devolved upon\r\nthe holders for the time being of the Great Officers of State: the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Thomas Tenison), the Lord Chancellor\r\n(Simon, Lord Harcourt), the Lord President (John, Duke of\r\nBuckinghamshire), the Lord High Treasurer (Charles, Duke of Shrewsbury),\r\nthe Lord Privy Seal (William, Earl of Dartmouth), the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty (Thomas, Earl of Strafford), and the Lord Chief Justice of the\r\nKing's Bench (Sir Thomas Parker, afterwards Earl of Macclesfield). Under\r\nanother clause of the Regency Act the Sovereign was entitled to nominate\r\na number of Lords Justices. Baron von Bothmer, the Hanovarian Envoy\r\nExtraordinary to the Court of St. James's, opened the sealed packet\r\ncontaining the Commission of Regency, drawn up by George after the death\r\nof his mother. The King's nominees were the Archbishop of York, the\r\nDukes of Shrewsbury,[1] Somerset, Bolton, Devonshire, Kent, Argyll,\r\nMontrose, and Roxborough; the Earls of Pembroke, Anglesea, Carlisle,\r\nNottingham, Abingdon, Scarborough, and Oxford; Viscount Townshend; and\r\nBarons Halifax and Cowper. Marlborough was not in the Commission, but he\r\nwas appointed Captain-General of the Forces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Commission was, of course, made out before the Duke of\r\nShrewsbury was given the White Staff, the possession of which made him a\r\nLord Justice in virtue of his office.]\r\n\r\nFrom The Hague, where he arrived on September 5, 1714, George I sent\r\nauthority to Charles, Viscount Townshend, to form a Cabinet, with power\r\nto nominate his colleagues. Townshend took the office of Secretary of\r\nState for the Northern Department, and appointed James Stanhope\r\nSecretary of State for the Southern Department. Lord Halifax became\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury; Lord Cowper, Lord Chancellor; the Earl of\r\nNottingham, Lord President; the Marquis of Wharton, Lord Privy Seal; the\r\nEarl of Oxford, First Lord of the Admiralty; the Earl of Sunderland,\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland; Robert Walpole, Paymaster-General of the\r\nForces. As Captain-General Marlborough was in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nLord Halifax, when making out the Commission of the Treasury, invited\r\nhis cousin Montagu to be one of the Commissioners, although the latter\r\nhad not secured a seat in Parliament. \"It will be surprizing to add,\"\r\nsays Lady Mary, \"that he hesitated to accept it at a time when his\r\nfather was alive and his present income very small; but he had certainly\r\nrefused it if he had not been persuaded to it by a rich old uncle of\r\nmine, Lord Pierrepont, whose fondness for me gave him expectations of a\r\nlarge legacy.\" Lady Mary, though glad enough that her husband had been\r\ngiven a place, was not over and above delighted that it was one so\r\nmodest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lady Mary Wortley Montagu to her Husband_\r\n\r\n[Enclosed, September 24, 1714.]\r\n\r\n\"Though I am very impatient to see you, I would not have you, by\r\nhastening to come down, lose any part of your interest. I am surprized\r\nyou say nothing of where you stand. I had a letter from Mrs. Hewet last\r\npost, who said she heard you stood at Newark, and would be chose without\r\nopposition; but I fear her intelligence is not at all to be depended on.\r\nI am glad you think of serving your friends; I hope it will put you in\r\nmind of serving yourself. I need not enlarge upon the advantages of\r\nmoney; every thing we see, and every thing we hear, puts us in\r\nremembrance of it. If it was possible to restore liberty to your\r\ncountry, or limit the encroachments of the prerogative, by reducing\r\nyourself to a garret, I should be pleased to share so glorious a poverty\r\nwith you; but as the world is, and will be, 'tis a sort of duty to be\r\nrich, that it may be in one's power to do good; riches being another\r\nword for power, towards the obtaining of which the first necessary\r\nqualification is impudence, and (as Demosthenes said of pronunciation in\r\noratory) the second is impudence, and the third, still, impudence. No\r\nmodest man ever did or ever will make his fortune. Your friend Lord\r\nH[alifa]x, R. W[alpo]le, and all other remarkable instances of quick\r\nadvancement, have been remarkably impudent. The Ministry is like a play\r\nat Court; there's a little door to get in, and a great crowd without,\r\nshoving and thrusting who shall be foremost: people who knock others\r\nwith their elbows, disregard a little kick of the shins, and still\r\nthrust heartily forwards, are sure of a good place. Your modest man\r\nstands behind in the crowd, is shoved about by every body, his cloaths\r\ntore, almost squeezed to death, and sees a thousand get in before him,\r\nthat don't make so good a figure as himself.\r\n\r\n\"I don't say it is impossible for an impudent man not to rise in the\r\nworld; but a moderate merit, with a large share of impudence, is more\r\nprobable to be advanced, than the greatest qualifications without it.\r\n\r\n\"If this letter is impertinent, it is founded upon an opinion of your\r\nmerit, which, it if is a mistake, I would not be undeceived in: it is my\r\ninterest to believe (as I do) that you deserve every thing, and are\r\ncapable of every thing; but nobody else will believe you if they see you\r\nget nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Postmark, October 6, 1714.]\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine why you should desire that I should not be glad,\r\nthough from a mistake, since, at least, it is an agreeable one. I\r\nconfess I shall ever be of opinion, if you are in the Treasury, it will\r\nbe an addition to your figure and facilitate your election, though it is\r\nno otherwise advantageous; and that, if you have nothing when all your\r\nacquaintance are preferred, the world generally will not be persuaded\r\nthat you neglect your fortune, but that you are neglected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Endorsed, October 9, 1714.]\r\n\r\n\"You do me wrong in imagining (as I perceive you do) that my reason for\r\nbeing solicitous for your having that place, was in view of spending\r\nmore money than we do. You have no cause of fancying me capable of such\r\na thought. I don't doubt but Lord H[alifa]x will very soon have the\r\nStaff, and it is my belief you will not be at all the richer: but I\r\nthink it looks well, and may facilitate your election; and that is all\r\nthe advantage I hope from it. When all your intimate acquaintance are\r\npreferred, I think you would have an ill air in having nothing; upon\r\nthat account only, I am sorry so many considerable places are disposed\r\non [_sic_]. I suppose, now, you will certainly be chose somewhere or\r\nother; and I cannot see why you should not pretend to be Speaker. I\r\nbelieve all the Whigs would be for you, and I fancy you have a\r\nconsiderable interest amongst the Tories, and for that reason would be\r\nvery likely to carry it. 'Tis impossible for me to judge of this so well\r\nas you can do; but the reputation of being thoroughly of no party, is (I\r\nthink) of use in this affair, and I believe people generally esteem you\r\nimpartial; and being chose by your country is more honourable than\r\nholding _any_ place from _any_ king.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations between Lady Mary and her husband did not improve. Not\r\nonly did he neglect to write to her when he left her in the country, but\r\nhe does not at any time appear to have had any desire to have her with\r\nhim in town. Lady Mary showed extreme, in fact overmuch, forbearance,\r\nbut towards the end of November her patience gave out: \"I cannot forbear\r\nany longer telling you, I think you use me very unkindly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't say so much of your absence, as I should do if you was in the\r\ncountry and I in London; because I would not have you believe I am\r\nimpatient to be in town, when I say I am impatient to be with you; but I\r\nam very sensible I parted with you in July and 'tis now the middle of\r\nNovember,\" she went on to say. \"As if this was not hardship enough, you\r\ndo not tell me you are sorry for it. You write seldom, and with so much\r\nindifference as shews you hardly think of me at all. I complain of ill\r\nhealth, and you only say you hope 'tis not so bad as I make it. You\r\nnever enquire after your child. I would fain flatter myself you have\r\nmore kindness for me and him than you express; but I reflect with grief\r\na man that is ashamed of passions that are natural and reasonable, is\r\ngenerally proud of those that [are] shameful and silly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary, once having given vent to her feeling of injustice, was not\r\nconcerned to mince her words: \"You seem perfectly pleased with our\r\nseparation, and indifferent how long it continues.... When I reflect on\r\nyour behaviour, I am ashamed of my own: I think I am playing the part of\r\nmy Lady Winchester. At least be as generous as My Lord; and as he made\r\nearly confession of his aversion, own to me your inconstancy, and upon\r\nmy word I will give you no more trouble about it.... For my part, as\r\n'tis my first, this is my last complaint, and your next of the kind\r\nshall go back enclosed to you in blank paper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU'S ACCOUNT OF THE COURT OF GEORGE I\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary, then, had been in Yorkshire when the Queen died, and was\r\nstill in the country, much against her will, when the King arrived on\r\nSeptember 18. Soon after, however, she came to town, and, so to speak,\r\nlooked around the Court. Her \"Account of the Court of George I\" is not\r\nalways accurate, and is certainly often prejudiced. It is not the less\r\ninteresting because the writer did not mince her words, even when\r\ndiscussing the character of her friend, \"Dolly\" Walpole. Notwithstanding,\r\nthis bird-eye view of the royal and political circles at the accession\r\nof the first of the Hanoverian monarchs is so valuable as to deserve\r\ninclusion in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The new Court with all their train was arrived before I left the\r\ncountry. The Duke of Marlborough was returned in a sort of triumph, with\r\nthe apparent merit of having suffered for his fidelity in the\r\nsuccession, and was reinstated in his office of general, &c. In short,\r\nall people who had suffered any hardship or disgrace during the late\r\nministry would have it believed that it was occasioned by their\r\nattachment to the House of Hanover. Even Mr. Walpole, who had been sent\r\nto the Tower for a piece of bribery proved upon him, was called a\r\nconfessor to the cause. But he had another piece of good luck that yet\r\nmore contributed to his advancement, he had a very handsome sister,\r\nwhose folly had lost her reputation in London; but the yet greater folly\r\nof Lord Townshend, who happened to be a neighbour in Norfolk to Mr.\r\nWalpole, had occasioned his being drawn in to marry her some months\r\nbefore the Queen died.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Townshend had that sort of understanding which commonly makes men\r\nhonest in the first part of their lives; they follow the instruction of\r\ntheir tutor, and, till somebody thinks it worth while to show them a new\r\npath, go regularly on in the road where they are set. Lord Townshend had\r\nthen been many years an excellent husband to a sober wife, a kind master\r\nto all his servants and dependants, a serviceable relation whenever it\r\nwas in his power, and followed the instinct of nature in being fond of\r\nhis children. Such a sort of behaviour without any glaring absurdity,\r\neither in prodigality or avarice, always gains a man the reputation of\r\nreasonable and honest; and this was his character when the Earl of\r\nGodolphin sent him envoy to the States, not doubting but he would be\r\nfaithful to his orders, without giving himself the trouble of\r\ncriticising on them, which is what all ministers wish in an envoy.\r\nRobethon, a French refugee (secretary to Bernstorff, one of the Elector\r\nof Hanover's ministers), happened to be at The Hague, and was civilly\r\nreceived by Lord Townshend, who treated him at his table with the\r\nEnglish hospitality; and he was charmed with a reception which his birth\r\nand education did not entitle him to. Lord Townshend was recalled when\r\nthe Queen changed her ministry, his wife died, and he retired into the\r\ncountry, where (as I have said before) Walpole had art enough to make\r\nhim marry his sister Dolly. At that time, I believe, he did not propose\r\nmuch more advantage by the match than to get rid of a girl that lay\r\nheavy on his hands.\r\n\r\n\"When King George ascended the throne, he was surrounded by all his\r\nGerman ministers and playfellows, male and female. Baron Goertz was the\r\nmost considerable among them both for birth and fortune. He had managed\r\nthe King's treasury, for thirty years, with the utmost fidelity and\r\neconomy; and had the true German honesty, being a plain, sincere and\r\nunambitious man. Bernstorff, the Secretary, was of a different turn. He\r\nwas avaricious, artful, and designing, and had got his share in the\r\nKing's councils by bribing his women. Robethon was employed in these\r\nmatters, and had the sanguine ambition of a Frenchman. He resolved there\r\nshould be an English ministry of his choosing; and, knowing none of them\r\npersonally but Townshend, he had not failed to recommend him to his\r\nmaster, and his master to the King, as the only proper person for the\r\nimportant post of Secretary of State; and he entered upon that office\r\nwith universal applause, having at that time a very popular character,\r\nwhich he might probably have retained for ever if he had not been\r\nentirely governed by his wife and her brother Robert Walpole, whom he\r\nimmediately advanced to be Paymaster, esteemed a post of exceeding\r\nprofit, and very necessary for his indebted estate.\r\n\r\n\"But he had yet higher views, or rather he found it necessary to move\r\nhigher, lest he should not be able to keep that. The Earl of Wharton,\r\nnow Marquis, both hated and despised him. His large estate, the whole\r\nincome of which was spent in the service of the party and his own parts,\r\nmade him considerable, though his profligate life lessened that weight\r\nthat a more regular conduct would have given him.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Halifax, who was now advanced to the dignity of Earl, and graced\r\nwith the Garter, and First Commissioner of the Treasury, treated him\r\nwith contempt. The Earl of Nottingham, who had the real merit of having\r\nrenounced the ministry in Queen Anne's reign, when he thought they were\r\ngoing to alter the succession, was not to be reconciled to Walpole, whom\r\nhe looked upon as stigmatised for corruption.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Marlborough, who in his old age was making the same figure\r\nat Court that he did when he first came into it--I mean, bowing and\r\nsmiling in the antechamber while Townshend was in the closet,--was not,\r\nhowever, pleased with the Walpole, who began to behave to him with the\r\ninsolence of new favour, and his Duchess, who never restrained her\r\ntongue in her life, used to make public jokes of the beggary she first\r\nknew him in, when her caprice gave him a considerable place, against the\r\nopinion of Lord Godolphin and the Duke of Marlborough.\r\n\r\n\"To balance these, he had introduced some friends of his own, by his\r\nrecommendation to Lord Townshend (who did nothing but by his\r\ninstigation). Colonel Stanhope was made the Secretary of State. He had\r\nbeen unfortunate in Spain, and there did not want those who attributed\r\nit to ill conduct; but he was called generous, brave, true to his\r\nfriends, and had an air of probity which prejudiced the world in his\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\"The King's character may be comprised in very few words. In private\r\nlife he would have been called an honest blockhead; and Fortune that\r\nmade him a king, added nothing to his happiness, only prejudiced his\r\nhonesty, and shortened his days. No man was ever more free from\r\nambition; he loved money, but loved to keep his own, without being\r\nrapacious of other men's. He would have grown rich by saving, but was\r\nincapable of laying schemes for getting; he was more properly dull than\r\nlazy, and would have been so well contented to have remained in his\r\nlittle town of Hanover, that if the ambition of those about him had not\r\nbeen greater than his own, we should never have seen him in England; and\r\nthe natural honesty of his temper, joined with the narrow notions of a\r\nlow education, made him look upon his acceptance of the crown as an act\r\nof usurpation, which was always uneasy to him. But he was carried by the\r\nstream of the people about him, in that, as in every action of his life.\r\nHe could speak no English, and was past the age of learning it. Our\r\ncustoms and laws were all mysteries to him, which he neither tried to\r\nunderstand, nor was capable of understanding if he had endeavoured it.\r\nHe was passively good-natured, and wished all mankind enjoyed quiet, if\r\nthey would let him do so.\r\n\r\n\"The mistress that followed him hither was so much of his own temper,\r\nthat I do not wonder at the engagement between them. She was duller than\r\nhimself, and consequently did not find out that he was so; and had lived\r\nin that figure at Hanover almost forty years (for she came hither at\r\nthree score) without meddling in any affairs of the Electorate, content\r\nwith the small pension he allowed her, and the honour of his visits when\r\nhe had nothing else to do, which happened very often. She even refused\r\ncoming hither at first, fearing that the people of England, who, she\r\nthought, were accustomed to use their kings barbarously, might chop off\r\nhis head in the first fortnight; and had not love or gratitude enough to\r\nventure being involved in his ruin. And the poor man was in peril of\r\ncoming hither without knowing where to pass his evenings; which he was\r\naccustomed to do in the apartments of women free from business. But\r\nMadame Keilmansegg saved him from this misfortune. She was told that\r\nMademoiselle Schulenburg scrupled this terrible journey, and took the\r\nopportunity of offering her service to his Majesty, who willingly\r\naccepted it, though he did not facilitate it to her by the payment of\r\ndebts, which made it very difficult for her to leave Hanover without\r\npermission of her creditors. But she was a woman of wit and spirit, and\r\nknew very well of what importance this step was to her fortune. She got\r\nout of the town in disguise, and made the best of her way in a\r\npost-chaise to Holland, from whence she embarked with the King, and\r\narrived at the same time with him in England; which was enough to make\r\nher called his mistress, or at least so great a favourite that the whole\r\nCourt began to pay her uncommon respect.\r\n\r\n\"This lady deserves that I should be a little particular in her\r\ncharacter, there being something in it worth speaking of. She was past\r\nforty; she had never been a beauty, but certainly very agreeable in her\r\nperson when adorned with youth; and had once appeared so charming to the\r\nKing, that it was said the divorce and ruin of his beautiful Princess,\r\nthe Duke of Celle's daughter, was owing to the hopes her mother (who was\r\ndeclared mistress to the King's father, and all-powerful in his Court,)\r\nhad of setting her daughter in her place; and that project did not\r\nsucceed, by the passion which Madame Kielmansegg took for M. Kielmansegg,\r\nwho was a son of a merchant of Hamburg, and after having a child by him,\r\nthere was nothing left for her but to marry him. Her ambitions ran mad\r\nwith the disappointment, and died in that deplorable manner, leaving\r\n£40,000 which she had heaped by the favour of the Elector, to this\r\ndaughter, which was very easily squandered by one of her temper. She was\r\nboth luxurious and generous, devoted to her pleasures, and seemed to have\r\ntaken Lord Rochester's resolution of avoiding all sorts of self-denial.\r\nShe had a greater vivacity in conversation than ever I knew in a German\r\nof either sex. She loved reading, and had a taste of all polite learning.\r\nHer humour was easy and sociable. Her constitution inclined her to\r\ngallantry. She was well-bred and amusing in company. She knew both how\r\nto please and be pleased, and had experience enough to know it was hard\r\nto do either without money. Her unlimited expenses had left her with\r\nvery little remaining, and she made what haste she could to make\r\nadvantage of the opinion the English had of her power with the King, by\r\nreceiving the presents that were made her from all quarters, and which\r\nshe knew very well must cease when it was known that the King's idleness\r\ncarried him to her lodgings without either regard for her advice, or\r\naffection for her person, which time and very bad paint had left without\r\nany of the charms which had once attracted him. His best-beloved mistress\r\nremained still at Hanover, which was the beautiful Countess of Platen.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it will be thought a digression in this place to tell the story\r\nof his amour with her; but, as I write only for myself, I shall always\r\nthink I am at liberty to make what digressions I think fit, proper or\r\nimproper; besides that in my opinion can set the King's character in a\r\nclearer light. That lady was married to Madame Kielmansegg's brother,\r\nthe most considerable man in Hanover for birth and fortune; and her\r\nbeauty was as far beyond that of any of the other women that appeared.\r\nHowever, the King saw her every day without taking notice of it, and\r\ncontented himself with his habitual commerce with Mademoiselle\r\nSchulenburg.\r\n\r\n\"In those little Courts there is no distinction of much value but what\r\narises from the favour of the Prince, and Madame Platen saw with great\r\nindignation that all her charms were passed over unregarded; and she\r\ntook a method to get over this misfortune which would never have entered\r\ninto the head of a woman of sense, and yet which met with wonderful\r\nsuccess. She asked an audience of his Highness, who granted it without\r\nguessing what she meant by it; and she told him that as nobody could\r\nrefuse her the first rank in that place, it was very mortifying to see\r\nhis Highness not show her any mark of favour; and as no person could be\r\nmore attached to his person than herself, she begged with tears in her\r\nfine eyes that he would alter his behaviour to her. The Elector, very\r\nmuch astonished at this complaint, answered that he did not know any\r\nreason he had given her to believe he was wanting in respect for her,\r\nand that he thought her not only the greatest lady, but the greatest\r\nbeauty of the court. 'If that be true, sire,' replied she, sobbing, 'why\r\ndo you pass all your time with Mademoiselle Schulenburg, while I hardly\r\nreceive the honour of a visit from you?' His Highness promised to mend\r\nhis manners, and from that time was very assiduous in waiting upon her.\r\nThis ended in a fondness, which her husband disliked so much that he\r\nparted with her, and she had the glory of possessing the heart and\r\nperson of her master, and to turn the whole stream of courtiers that\r\nused to attend Mademoiselle Schulenburg to her side. However, he did not\r\nbreak with his first love, and often went to her apartment to cut paper,\r\nwhich was his chief employment there; which the Countess of Platen\r\neasily permitted him, having often occasion for his absence. She was\r\nnaturally gallant; and, after having thus satisfied her ambition,\r\npursued her warmer inclinations.\r\n\r\n\"Young Craggs came about this time to Hanover, where his father sent him\r\nto take a view of that court in his tour of travelling. He was in his\r\nfirst bloom of youth and vigour, and had so strong an appearance of that\r\nperfection, that it was called beauty by the generality of women: though\r\nin my opinion there was a coarseness in his face and shape that had more\r\nthe air of a porter than a gentleman; and, if fortune had not interposed\r\nher almighty power, he might by his birth have appeared in that figure;\r\nhis father being nothing more considerable at his first appearance in\r\nthe world than footman to Lady Mary Mordaunt, the gallant Duchess of\r\nNorfolk, who had always half a dozen intrigues to manage. Some servant\r\nmust always be trusted in affairs of that kind and James Craggs had the\r\ngood fortune to be chose for that purpose. She found him both faithful\r\nand discreet, and he was soon advanced to the dignity of _valet-de-chambre._\r\n\r\n\"King James II had an amour with her after he was upon the throne, and\r\nrespected the Queen enough to endeavour to keep it entirely from her\r\nknowledge. James Craggs was the messenger between the King and the\r\nDuchess, and did not fail to make the best use of so important a trust.\r\nHe scraped a great deal of money from the bounty of this royal lover,\r\nand was too inconsiderable to be hurt by his ruin; and did not concern\r\nmuch for that of his mistress, which by lower intrigues happened soon\r\nafter. This fellow, from the report of all parties, and even from that\r\nof his professed enemies, had a very uncommon genius; a head well turned\r\nfor calculation, great industry, and was so just an observer of the\r\nworld, that the meanness of his education never appeared in his\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Marlborough, who was sensible how well he was qualified for\r\naffairs that required secrecy, employed him as his procurer both for\r\nwomen and money, and he acquitted himself so well of these trusts as to\r\nplease his master, and yet raise a considerable fortune, by turning his\r\nmoney in the public funds, the secret of which came often to his\r\nknowledge by the Duke's employing him. He had this only son, whom he\r\nlooked on with the partiality of a parent, and resolved to spare nothing\r\nin his education that could add to his figure.\r\n\r\n\"Young Craggs had great vivacity, a happy memory, and flowing elocution,\r\nhe was brave and generous, and had an appearance of open-heartedness in\r\nhis manner that gained him a universal good-will, if not a universal\r\nesteem. It is true there appeared a heat and want of judgment in all his\r\nwords and actions, which did not make him valuable in the eyes of cool\r\njudges, but Madame Platen was not of that number. His youth and fire\r\nmade him appear very well worthy of his passionate addresses. Two people\r\nso well disposed towards each other were very soon in the closest\r\nengagement; and the first proof Madame Platen gave him of her affection\r\nwas introducing him to the favour of the Elector, who took it on her\r\nword that he was a young man of extraordinary merit, and he named him\r\nfor Cofferer at his first accession to the Crown of England, and I\r\nbelieve it was the only place that he then disposed of from any\r\ninclination of his own. This proof of Madame Platen's favour hindered\r\nher coming hither.\r\n\r\n\"Bernstorff was afraid she might meddle in the distribution of places\r\nthat he was willing to keep in his own hands; and he represented to the\r\nKing that the Roman Catholic religion that she professed was an\r\ninsuperable objection to her appearance at the Court of England, at\r\nleast so early; but he gave her private hopes that things might be so\r\narranged as to make her admittance easy when the King was settled in his\r\nnew dominions. And with this hope she consented without much concern to\r\nlet him go without her; not reflecting that weak minds lose all\r\nimpressions by even short absences. But as her own understanding did not\r\nfurnish her with very great refinements, she was troubled with none of\r\nthe fears that would have affected a stronger head, and had too good an\r\nopinion of her own beauty to believe anything in England could efface\r\nit, while Madame Kielmansegg attached herself to the one thing\r\nnecessary--getting what money she could by the sale of places, and the\r\ncredulity of those who thought themselves very polite in securing her\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Halifax was one of this number; his ambition was unbounded, and he\r\naimed at no less than the Treasurer's staff, and thought himself in a\r\nfine road for it by furnishing Madame Kielmansegg both with money and a\r\nlover. Mr. Methuen was the man he picked out for that purpose. He was\r\none of the Lords of the Treasury; he was handsome and well-made; he had\r\nwit enough to be able to affect any part he pleased and a romantic turn\r\nin his conversation that could entertain a lady with as many adventures\r\nas Othello,--and it is no ill way of gaining Desdemonas. Women are very\r\napt to take their lovers' characters from their own mouths; and if you\r\nwill believe Mr. Methuen's account of himself, neither Artamenes nor\r\nOroondates ever had more valour, honour, constancy, and discretion. Half\r\nof these bright qualities were enough to charm Madame Kielmansegg, and\r\nthey were soon in the strictest familiarity, which continued for\r\ndifferent reasons, to the pleasure of both parties, till the arrival of\r\nMademoiselle Schulenburg, which was hastened by the German ministers,\r\nwho envied the money accumulated by Madame Kielmansegg, which they\r\nlonged to turn into another channel, which they thought would be more\r\neasily drawn into their own hands. They took care to inform Mademoiselle\r\nSchulenburg of the fond reception all the Germans met with in England,\r\nand gave her a view of the immense fortune that waited her here. This\r\nwas enough to cure her fears, and she arrived accompanied by a young\r\nniece who had already made some noise at Hanover. She had projected the\r\nconquest of the Prince of Wales, and had so far succeeded as to obtain\r\nhis favours for some months, but the Princess, who dreaded a rival to\r\nher power, soon put an end to the correspondence, and she was no longer\r\npossessed of his good graces when she came hither.\r\n\r\n\"I have not yet given the character of the Prince. The fire of his\r\ntemper appeared in every look and gesture; which, being unhappily under\r\nthe direction of a small understanding, was every day throwing him upon\r\nsome indiscretion. He was naturally sincere, and his pride told him that\r\nhe was placed above constraint; not reflecting that a high rank carries\r\nalong with it a necessity if a more decent and regular behaviour than is\r\nexpected from those who are not set in so conspicuous a light. He was\r\nfar from being of that opinion, that he looked on all men and women he\r\nsaw as creatures he might kick or kiss for his diversion; and whenever\r\nhe met with any opposition in those designs, he thought his opposers\r\ninsolent rebels to the will of God, who created them for his use, and\r\njudged of the merit of all people by their submission to his orders, or\r\nthe relation they had to his power. And in this view, he looked upon the\r\nPrincess, as the most meritorious of her sex; and she took care to keep\r\nhim in that sentiment by all the arts she was mistress of. He had\r\nmarried her by inclination; his good-natured father had been so\r\ncomplaisant as to let him choose a wife for himself. She was of the\r\nhouse of Anspach, and brought him no great addition either of money or\r\nalliance; but was at that time esteemed a German beauty, and had genius\r\nwhich qualified her for the government of a fool; and made her\r\ndespicable in the eyes of men of sense; I mean a low cunning, which gave\r\nher an inclination to cheat all the people she conversed with, and often\r\ncheated herself in the first place, by showing her the wrong side of her\r\ninterest, not having understanding enough to observe that falsehood in\r\nconversation, like red on the face, should be used very seldom, and very\r\nsparingly, or they destroy that interest and beauty which they are\r\ndesigned to heighten.\r\n\r\n\"Her first thought on her marriage was to secure to herself the sole and\r\nwhole direction of her spouse; and to that purpose she counterfeited the\r\nmost extravagant fondness for his person; yet, at the same time, so\r\ndevoted to his pleasures (which she often told him were the rule of all\r\nher thoughts and actions), that whenever he thought proper to find them\r\nwith other women, she even loved whoever was instrumental to his\r\nentertainment, and never resented anything but what appeared to her a\r\nwant of respect for him; and in this light she really could not help\r\ntaking notice that the presents made to her on her wedding were not\r\nworthy of his bride, and at least she ought to have had all his mother's\r\njewels. This was enough to make him lose all respect for his indulgent\r\nfather. He downright abused his ministers, and talked impertinently to\r\nhis old grandmother the Princess Sophia, which ended in such a coldness\r\ntowards all his family as left him entirely under the government of his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\"The indolent Elector contented himself with showing his resentment by\r\nhis silence towards him; and this was the situation the family first\r\nappeared in when they came into England. This behaviour did not,\r\nhowever, hinder schemes being laid by various persons of gratifying\r\ntheir ambition, or making their fortunes, by particular attachments to\r\neach of the Royal Family.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAT HERRENHAUSEN AND ST. JAMES (1714-1716)\r\n\r\nThe Elector George Lewis not delighted at his accession to the British\r\nthrone--A greater man in Hanover than in London--Lady Mary modifies her\r\nfirst impression of the King--She is in high favour at Court--An amusing\r\nincident at St. James's--The early unpopularity of George I in England\r\ngenerally, and especially in the capital--The Hanoverians in the Royal\r\nHousehold--The Duchess of Kendal--The Countess of Darlington--Lady\r\nMary's description of the Hanoverian ladies--The Duchess of Kendal's\r\npassion for money--Her influence with the King in political matters--Count\r\nde Broglie--The scandal about Lady Darlington refuted--Lady Mary and the\r\nPrince of Wales--The King and the Prince of Wales--The poets and wits of\r\nthe day--Gay's tribute to Lady Mary--Pope's verses on her--\"Court Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is beyond question that the accession to the British throne gave no\r\nthrill of pleasure to the King. He was fifty-four years of age, and had\r\nno desire to change his state. It was necessary for him, as the present\r\nwriter has said elsewhere, now to go from a country where he was\r\nabsolute, to another where, so far from being supreme, when King and\r\npeople differed on a matter of vital importance, the monarch had to give\r\nway--the price of resistance having been fixed, at worst at death, at\r\nbest exile or civil war. He had to go from a country where he was the\r\nwealthiest and most important personage to another where he would be\r\nmerely regarded as a minor German princeling set up as a figurehead, and\r\nwhere many of the gentry were wealthier than he. This point was\r\nappreciated by Lady Mary when she went to Hanover in November, 1716, for\r\nshe wrote from there to the Countess of Bristol: \"I have now made the\r\ntour of Germany, and cannot help observing difference between\r\ntravelling here and in England. One sees none of those fine seats of\r\nnoblemen that are so common among us, nor anything like a country\r\ngentleman's house, though they have many situations perfectly fine. But\r\nthe whole people are divided into absolute sovereignties, where all the\r\nriches and magnificence are at Court, or communities of merchants, such\r\nas Nuremberg and Frankfort, where they live always in town for the\r\nconvenience of trade.\"\r\n\r\nWorse than all George must set forth by no means sure of his reception,\r\nand with no love, nor even liking, for the people over whom he was\r\ncalled to reign. That he did go at all is greatly to his credit, for he\r\nwas doubtful if he would be allowed to remain, and he never revisited\r\nHanover without some suspicion that he might not be able to return to\r\nEngland. He would have been a much happier man if he could have remained\r\nat his beloved Herrenhausen. He never felt he owed Britain anything, and\r\nindeed he did not: the throne had been settled on his mother, not for\r\nlove of her, but simply because she was the only alternative to the\r\nsuccession of the dreaded Roman Catholic heirs. So George came as a\r\nvisitor, rather submitting to be King of England, than anxious for the\r\nhonour, prepared to be forced by circumstances to return, little\r\ndreaming that two hundred years later his descendants would be firmly\r\nseated upon his throne.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that Lady Mary, as she became better acquainted with\r\nthe King, grew to like him. In the letter from Hanover just quoted, she\r\nsays: \"His Majesty dines and sups constantly in public. The Court is\r\nvery numerous, and his affability and goodness make it one of the most\r\nagreeable places in the world to me.\" The King was indeed at his best\r\nwhen in residence at Herrenhausen. Lord Peterborough said that George\r\nwas so happy there that he believed he had forgot _the accident that\r\noccurred to him and his family on the 1st of August_, 1714.\r\n\r\nIt may be that, the King having taken a great fancy to Lady Mary,\r\nmodified that lady's earlier impression. When she and her husband went\r\nto Hanover, the King, as she mentioned in one of her letters to Lady\r\nBristol, \"has had the goodness to appoint us a lodging in one part of\r\nthe Palace, without which we should be very ill accommodated; for the\r\nvast number of English crowds the town so much, it is very good luck to\r\nbe able to get one sorry room in a miserable tavern. I dined to-day with\r\nthe Portuguese ambassador, who thinks himself very happy to have two\r\nwretched parlours in an inn.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary was, indeed, in high favour at the Courts of Hanover and St.\r\nJames's. \"Mr. Wortley and his lady are here,\" the British Minister at\r\nHanover, John Clavering, wrote in December, 1716, to Lady Cowper. \"They\r\nwere so very impatient to see his Majesty that they travelled night and\r\nday from Vienna here. Her Ladyship is mighty gay and airy, and occasions\r\na great deal of discourse. Since her arrival the King has took but\r\nlittle notice of any other lady, not even of Madame Kielmansegg, which\r\nthe ladies of Hanover don't relish very much; for my part, I can't help\r\nrejoicing to see his Majesty prefer us to the Germans.\"\r\n\r\nIt was evidently before that the following incident occurred. Lady Mary\r\noften went to St. James's, but, as it was very dull there, was often\r\nglad to go instead to some less august and more amusing assembly. One\r\nevening Lady Mary particularly desired to leave early, and induced the\r\nDuchess of Kendal to persuade the King to dismiss her. The King\r\nreluctantly acquiesced, though, when Lady Mary made her bow, he declared\r\nit was an act of perfidy to run away, but, in spite of that and other\r\ncomplimentary remarks, she at last contrived to make her escape.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the staircase she met Mr. Secretary Craggs, who, seeing\r\nher leave so early, enquired if the King had retired, but she reassured\r\nhim on that point, and dwelt complacently on the King's reluctance to\r\nlet her go. Craggs made no remark, but took her in his arms, ran\r\nupstairs, and deposited her in the ante-chamber, whereupon the pages at\r\nonce threw open the doors leading to the King's apartment.\r\n\r\n\"_Ah! la re-voilà_,\" cried his Majesty and the Duchess of Kendal, and\r\nexpressed their pleasure that she had changed her mind, but Lady Mary\r\nwas so flustered that, instead of maintaining a discreet silence she\r\nburst out, \"Oh, Lord, Sir, I have been so frightened!\" and related her\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely finished relating her adventure, when the door was\r\nthrown open, and Mr. Secretary Craggs was announced. He entered calmly,\r\nand made his bow as if nothing had happened, but the King strode up to\r\nhim, and said angrily: \"_Mais, comment, donc, Monsieur Craggs, est ce\r\nque c'est l'usage de ce pays de porter des belles dames comme un sac de\r\nfroment_?\" (\"Is it the custom of this country to carry about fair ladies\r\nas if they were a sack of wheat?\") The culprit was dumbfounded by the\r\nunexpected attack, and glanced reproachfully at Lady Mary for having\r\nbetrayed him, but, soon finding his wits, parried with, \"There is\r\nnothing I would not do for your Majesty's satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for the early unpopularity of George I was that he\r\nbrought with him a large suite from Hanover.\r\n\r\nThe household that accompanied him numbered sixty-three. There was Baron\r\nvon Kielmansegg, who was Master of the Horse; Count von Platen, son of\r\nthe late Prime Minister of Hanover; and Baron von Hardenburg, Marshal of\r\nthe Court. With them came the Lutheran clergyman, Braun; a group of\r\nphysicians, surgeons, and apothecaries; five body-servants, including\r\nthe Turks, Mahomet and Mustapha; four pages, two trumpeters, a carver,\r\ntwelve footmen, eighteen cooks, three cellarmen, two housemaids, and one\r\nwasherwoman. It may be mentioned that in 1696 there were only two\r\nwasherwomen for the three hundred and seven persons, exclusive of\r\nroyalty, that at this date made up the Court of Hanover.\r\n\r\nThe political staff that came included twenty-three persons. Baron von\r\nBothmer was already in England. Now arrived Baron von Bernstorff, Prime\r\nMinister of Hanover; Baron von Schlitz-Goertz, Hanoverian Finance\r\nMinister; Baron von Hattorf, Hanoverian Minister of War; and John\r\nRobethon.\r\n\r\nTo these men, who advised the King in his capacity of Elector of\r\nHanover, there would have been no objection had they confined their\r\nenergies to administering that country. This, unfortunately, was not the\r\ncase. Some of them, at least, notably Bernstorff and Robethon, meddled\r\nin English politics, and most of them desired high office, lucrative\r\nappointments, peerages, and other grants. It is certain that they must\r\nhave known that they were barred from such delights by an Act of 1700\r\nwhich carefully guarded against foreigners acquiring any share in the\r\ngovernment of this country. Nothing, in fact, could be more definite\r\nthan clause three of the \"Act for the further limitation of the Crown\":\r\n\"No person born out of the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or\r\nthe dominions thereunto belonging (although he be naturalised or made a\r\ndenizen, except such as are born of English parents),\" so runs clause\r\nthree of the above-mentioned Act, \"shall be capable of the Privy\r\nCouncil, or a Member of either House of Parliament, or to enjoy any\r\noffice or place of trust, either civil or military, or to have any grant\r\nof lands, tenements, or hereditaments from the Crown to himself or to\r\nany other or others in trust for him.\" Still, Acts of Parliament have\r\nbeen repealed, and the invaders may well have hoped that, with the\r\nKing's support, their influence might increase until they were strong\r\nenough to have the clause revoked.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, nothing of the kind happened, and no Hanoverian\r\nstatesman or court officer was appointed to any place of profit under\r\nthe Crown or rewarded for his services in the Electorate by the grant of\r\na British peerage. It may be noted that the Hanoverian officials, fond\r\nas all Germans were and are of wordy distinctions, styled themselves\r\n\"Koenigliche-Gross-britannische-Kurfuerstlich-Braunschweig-Lueneburgische\"\r\n(Royal-British-Electoral-Brunswick-Luenburg) councillors or magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe Hanoverians who were on the political side or held posts in the\r\nHousehold might, by the exercise of a little tact, have lived down an\r\nunpopularity that was the result of circumstances rather than arising\r\nfrom any personal animosity. That they did not do so may be ascribed\r\npartly, anyhow, to their own fault.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, nothing probably would have overcome the prejudice\r\nagainst the ladies who followed George to this country. These were the\r\nCountess Ehrengard Melusina von der Schulenburg, who, in 1716, was\r\ncreated Duchess of Munster in the Irish peerage, and three years after\r\nDuchess of Kendal, by which latter title she is more generally known,\r\nand the Baroness von Kielmansegg (_née_ Platen), who was presently\r\nelevated to the dignity of Countess of Darlington. It was generally\r\nassured that these ladies were the King's mistresses, and they were\r\naccordingly disliked not only at Court but also by the mob. One of them\r\nwhen driving in London was assailed by terms of abuse--as she understood\r\nscarcely any English, she could only go by the tone of the voices--and\r\nputting her head out of the coach said: \"Good people, why abuse us? We\r\ncome for all your goods.\" \"Yes, damn you,\" cried someone, \"and for our\r\nchattels, too.\" The man in the crowd only voiced the general opinion,\r\nand, it must be said, the general opinion was not far removed from the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Jacobites made the most of this, and, as Horace Walpole\r\nhas related, \"the seraglio was food for all the venom of the Jacobites,\r\nand, indeed, nothing could be grosser that was vomited out in lampoons,\r\nlibels, and every channel of abuse against the Sovereign and the new\r\nCourt and chanted even in their hearing in the public streets.\"\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in _Walpoliana_ that \"this couple of rabbits, the\r\nfavourites, as they were called, occasioned much jocularity on their\r\nfirst importation.\" Some of the jocularity was aroused by their\r\nappearance. The style of beauty, or what passed for beauty, in each\r\ncountry was markedly different. Hear Lady Mary Wortley Montagu writing\r\nfrom Hanover in December, 1716: \"I have now got into the regions of\r\nbeauty,\" she told Lady Rich. \"All the women have literally rosy cheeks,\r\nsnowy foreheads and bosoms, jet eye-brows, and scarlet lips, to which\r\nthey generally add coal-black hair. These perfections never leave them\r\ntill the hour of their death, and have a very fine effect by candle-light,\r\nbut I could wish they were handsome with a little more variety. They\r\nresemble one another as much as Mrs. Salmon's Court of Great Britain,\r\nand are in much danger of melting away by too near approaching the fire\r\nwhich they for that reason carefully avoid, though it is now such\r\nexcessively cold weather, that I believe they suffer extremely by that\r\npiece of self-denial.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kendal at the time of the accession of George I was\r\nforty-seven years of age. The King's mother, the Electress Sophia, had\r\ncommented on her to Mrs. Howard: \"Look at that mawkin, and think of her\r\nbeing my son's passion.\" If a family portrait, now in the possession of\r\nCount Werner Schulenburg, may be trusted, she was what is called \"a fine\r\nfigure of a woman\"; she had blue eyes and fair hair. She was so tall\r\nthat she was nicknamed in England \"the May-pole.\" She was certainly\r\ndetermined to make the most of her opportunities, and the more eager\r\nbecause at the beginning of the reign she was very doubtful whether\r\nGeorge I would not have hurriedly to retire to Hanover for good and all.\r\nSo doubtful of the likelihood of the duration of the Hanoverian line in\r\nthis country was she that at first she declined to accompany the\r\nElector, and she only changed her mind when she found the Baroness von\r\nKielmansegg had decided to go to England. She was in high favour with\r\nGeorge, and took every advantage of her influence. She left an immense\r\nfortune, which was acquired in ways into which an eulogistic biographer\r\nof the lady would not enquire. Certainly, she received for her good\r\noffices large sums of money from the promoters of the South Sea Act, she\r\naccepted bribes to secure peerages, and, it is said on the authority of\r\nSir Robert Walpole, that Bolingbroke presented her with £11,000 to\r\nendeavour to secure his restoration to the royal favour. It may be\r\nremarked, _en passant_, that Spence records that Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontagu said to him: \"I would never be acquainted with Lord Bolingbroke,\r\nbecause I always looked upon him as a vile man.\"\r\n\r\nDuchess of Kendal was not content with indulging her passion for money;\r\nshe, in matters of politics, acted as the hidden hand behind the\r\nthrone--any services that she rendered were, it is certain, adequately\r\nremunerated. Her ascendancy over the King was unquestionable, and\r\nWalpole was compelled to admit that she \"was in effect as much Queen of\r\nEngland as ever any was, that he did everything by her.\" She not only\r\nused her power in connection with home affairs, but also in matters of\r\nforeign policy, and the Count de Broglie, French Minister of the Court\r\nof St. James, was urgent in his endeavours to secure her support.\r\n\r\n\"As the Duchess of Kendal seemed to express a wish to see me often, I\r\nhave been very attentive to her, being convinced that it is highly\r\nessential to the advantage of your Majesty's service to be on good terms\r\nwith her, for she is closely united with the three ministers who now\r\ngovern,\" the Count wrote to Louis XV on July 6, 1724, and four days\r\nlater returned to the subject: \"The more I consider state affairs, the\r\nmore I am convinced that the Government is entirely in the hands of Mr.\r\nWalpole, Lord Townshend, and the Duchess of Newcastle, who are on the\r\nbest terms with the Duchess of Kendal. The King visits her every\r\nafternoon from five till eight, and it is there that she endeavours to\r\npenetrate the sentiments of his Britannic majesty for the purpose of\r\nconsulting the three ministers, and pursuing the measures which may be\r\nthought necessary for accomplishing their designs. She sent me word that\r\nshe was desirous of my friendship, and that I should place confidence in\r\nher. I assured her that I would do everything in my power to merit her\r\nesteem and friendship. I am convinced that she may be advantageously\r\nemployed in promoting your Majesty's service, and that it will be\r\nnecessary to employ her, though I will not trust her further than is\r\nabsolutely necessary.\" To these letters Louis replied on July 18: \"There\r\nis no doubt that the Duchess of Kendal, having a great ascendancy over\r\nthe King of Great Britain, and maintaining strict union with his\r\nministers, must materially influence their principal resolutions. You\r\nwill neglect nothing to acquire a share of her confidence, from a\r\nconviction that nothing can be more conducive to my interests. There is,\r\nhowever, a manner of giving additional value to the marks of confidence\r\nyou bestow on her in private, by avoiding in public all appearances\r\nwhich might seem too pointed, by which means you will avoid falling into\r\nthe inconvenience of being suspected by those who are not friendly to\r\nthe Duchess, at the same time that a kind of mysteriousness in public on\r\nthe subject of your confidence, will give rise to a firm belief of your\r\nhaving formed a friendship mutually sincere.\"\r\n\r\nThe case of Lady Darlington was different. It was assured generally that\r\nshe, too, was a mistress of the King, a view that Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontagu accepted, and one which was endorsed by the historians and\r\nbiographers for more than a century. The first English writer to\r\ndiscover the truth was Carlyle, who in his _Life of Frederick the Great_\r\nsaid: \"Miss Kielmansegg, Countess of Darlington, was, and is, believed\r\nby the gossiping English to have been a second simultaneous Mistress of\r\nHis Majesty's, but seems after all to have been his Half-Sister and\r\nnothing more.\" She was, in fact, a daughter of the Countess of Platen\r\n(_née_ Clara Elizabeth von Meysenbach), not, indeed, by that lady's\r\nhusband, but by Ernest Augustus, Duke (afterwards Elector) of Hanover,\r\nthe father of George I. Only Lady Cowper seems to have known this, and\r\nto have accepted it as a fact. Yet there was no secrecy concerning the\r\npaternity of the Countess, and it was, of course, well-known in the\r\nGerman Courts. Further, it was overlooked that in the patent of nobility\r\nin 1721 there is a reference to the royal blood of the recipient of the\r\ntitle, and actually the patent, in addition to the Great Seal, had a\r\nminiature of the King and the arms of the houses of Platen, Kielmansegg,\r\nand Great Britain (Brunswick-Lueneburg) with the bar-sinister.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Refutation of the scandal is to be found in a work\r\npublished in Hanover in 1902: \"_Briefe des Hertzogs Ernst August zu\r\nBraun schweig-Lüneburg an Johann Franz Diedrich von Wendt aus dem Jahren\r\n1705 bis 1726_,\" edited by Erich Graf Kielmansegg.]\r\n\r\nAll this at this time must have been very distressing to Lady Darlington,\r\nfor she was very careful of her reputation, as the following amusing\r\nincident, given in Lady Cowper's Diary (February 4, 1716) indicates:\r\n\"Madame Kielmansegg had been told that the Prince, afterwards George II,\r\nhad said that she intrigued with all the men at Hanover. She came to\r\ncomplain of this to the Princess, who replied, she did not believe the\r\nPrince had said so, it not being his custom to speak in that manner.\r\nMadame Kielmansegg cried and said it had made her despised, and that\r\nmany of her acquaintance had left her upon that story, but that her\r\nhusband had taken all the care she could to vindicate her reputation,\r\nand thereupon she drew forth a certificate under her husband's hand, in\r\nwhich he certified, in all the due forms, that she had always been a\r\nfaithful wife to him, and that he had never had any cause to suspect her\r\nhonesty. The Princess smiled, and said she did not doubt it at all, and\r\nthat all the trouble was very unnecessary, and that it was a very bad\r\nreputation that wanted such a support.\"\r\n\r\nIn appearance, Lady Darlington was a contrast to the Duchess of Kendal.\r\nShe was in her youth a good-looking woman, but as the years passed she\r\nbecame immensely corpulent, and Horace Walpole, who saw her at his\r\nmother's when he was a child, thus described her: \"Two fierce black\r\neyes, large and rolling between two lofty arched eye-brows, two acres of\r\ncheeks spread with crimson, an ocean of neck that overflowed, and was\r\nnot distinguished from the lower part of her body, and no part\r\nrestrained by stays.\" He christened her \"Elephant and Castle.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while, Lady Mary was popular also with the Prince of Wales, who\r\nwas attracted by her looks and her vivacity. It is recorded that on one\r\noccasion when Lady Mary appeared in a gown more than usually becoming\r\nthe Prince called his wife from the card table to admire her. The\r\nPrincess came, looked, and then said calmly, \"Lady Mary always dresses\r\nso well,\" and went on with her game.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, however, even for the most tactful person in the\r\nworld to be on good terms with the King and the Prince of Wales. It is\r\nsaid of George I that he was of an affectionate disposition and that\r\nthroughout his life he hated only three people in the world: his mother,\r\nwho was dead, his wife, who was imprisoned at Ahlden, and his son. It\r\nhas been said that the trouble began when in his early youth the Prince\r\nexpressed sympathy with his mother; it may be that it started from the\r\nfact that the Prince was the son of a woman who had sullied the honour\r\nof the Royal House. It is, however, unnecessary to look for reasons; to\r\nhate the heir-apparent was a tradition with the Georges.\r\n\r\nMatters did not improve after the accession of George I to the British\r\nthrone. He disliked his daughter-in-law, Caroline, daughter of John\r\nFrederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Anspach, and spoke of her as \"_Cette\r\ndiablesse Madame la Princesse.\"_ The opposition was not slow to take\r\nadvantage of the rift, and planted itself on the side of his Royal\r\nHighness. It proposed, on the Civil List vote, a separate revenue of\r\n£100,000 for the Prince--which infuriated the King, as it was intended\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nIn 1716 George was anxious to visit his beloved Hanover, but he was torn\r\nbetween the desire to do so and the dislike to leave his son in England\r\nas Regent during his absence. Indeed, he almost decided not to go,\r\nunless he could join others with the Prince in the administration and\r\nlimit his authority by the most rigorous restriction. To this, however,\r\nthe Government could not consent, and Townshend stated that \"on a\r\ncareful persual of precedents, finding no instance of persons being\r\njoined in commission with the Prince of Wales, and few, if any,\r\nrestrictions, they were of opinion that the constant tenour of ancient\r\npractice could not conveniently be receded from.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary, like the rest of the world, found the Court dull, and she\r\nmuch preferred to spend her time in the more congenial society of men of\r\nletters. Addison, she knew, and Steele, and Arbuthnot, and Jervas, and\r\nGay, who presently paid her a pretty compliment in _Mr. Pope's Welcome\r\nfrom Greece,_ wherein he inserted tributes to the ladies of the Court:\r\n\r\n  \"What lady's that to whom he gently bends?\r\n     Who knows her not? Ah, those are Wortley's eyes.\r\n   How art thou honour'd, number'd with her friends;\r\n     For she distinguishes the good and wise.\"\r\n\r\nPope, too, wrote of her with appreciation:\r\n\r\n  TO LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU\r\n\r\n         I\r\n\r\n    In beauty or wit,\r\n    No mortal as yet\r\n  To question your empire has dared.\r\n    But men of discerning\r\n    Have thought that in learning,\r\n  To yield to a lady was hard.\r\n\r\n        II\r\n\r\n    Impertinent schools,\r\n    With musty dull rules,\r\n  Have reading to females denied;\r\n    So Papists refuse\r\n    The Bible to use\r\n  Lest flocks should be wise as their guides.\r\n\r\n       III\r\n\r\n    Twas woman at first\r\n    (Indeed she was curst)\r\n  In knowledge that tasted delight,\r\n    And sages agree\r\n    The laws should decree\r\n  To the first possessor the right.\r\n\r\n        IV\r\n\r\n    Then bravely, fair dame,\r\n    Resume the old claim,\r\n  Which to your whole sex does belong;\r\n    And let men receive\r\n    From a second bright Eve\r\n  The knowledge of right and of wrong.\r\n\r\n         V\r\n\r\n    But if the first Eve\r\n    Hard doom did receive,\r\n  When only one apple had she,\r\n    What a punishment new\r\n    Shall be found out for you,\r\n  Who tasting, have robb'd the whole tree!\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance with Pope began shortly after Lady Mary came to town in\r\nthe autumn of 1714. It soon developed into friendship. \"Lady Mary\r\nWortley,\" Jervas wrote to the poet, probably in 1715 or early in the\r\nfollowing year, \"ordered me by express this morning, _cedente Gayo et\r\nridente Fortescuvio_, to send you a letter, or some other proper notice,\r\nto come to her on Thursday about five, which I suppose she meant in the\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\nThere appeared in March, 1716, a volume bearing the title _Court Poems_,\r\nthe authorship being attributed to \"A Lady of Quality,\" who, it soon\r\nbecame known, was Lady Mary. The book was issued by Roberts, who had\r\nreceived the three sets of verses contained in it from the notorious\r\npiratical publisher, Edmund Curll. How the manuscript \"fell\" into the\r\nhands of Curll it is not easy to imagine. Curll's account is that they\r\nwere found in a pocket-book taken up in Westminster Hall on the last day\r\nof the trial of the Jacobite Lord Winton. Anyhow, however it came about,\r\nthe volume was published in 1716, when it was found to contain \"The\r\nBasset Table,\" \"The Drawing Room,\" and \"The Toilet.\"\r\n\r\nCurll was an excellent publicity agent for his wares. He wrote, or\r\ncaused to be written, a most intriguing \"advertisement\" about the\r\nauthorship of the poems:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Upon reading them over at St. James' Coffee House, they were attributed\r\nby the general voice to be the productions of a lady of quality. When I\r\nproduced them at Button's, the poetical jury there brought in a\r\ndifferent verdict; and the foreman strenuously insisted upon it that Mr.\r\nGay was the man. Not content with these two decisions, I was resolved to\r\ncall in an umpire, and accordingly chose a gentleman of distinguished\r\nmerit, who lives not far from Chelsea. I sent him the papers, which he\r\nreturned next day, with this answer: \"Sir, depend upon it these lines\r\ncould come from no other hand than the judicious translator of Homer.\"\r\nThus, having impartially given the sentiments of the Town, I hope I may\r\ndeserve thanks for the pains I have taken in endeavouring to find out\r\nthe author of these valuable performances, and everybody is at liberty\r\nto bestow the laurel as they please.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPope was furious, and there is a story that he invited Curll to drink\r\nwine with him at a coffee-house, and put in his glass some poison that\r\nacted as an emetic. What is certain is that the poet wrote a pamphlet\r\nwith the title, \"A full and true Account of a horrid and barbarous\r\nRevenge by Poison on the body of Edmund Curll.\"\r\n\r\nThe three pieces in _Court Poems_ were claimed by Lady Mary as her own,\r\nbut this claim was disputed. Pope declared himself the author of \"The\r\nBasset Table,\" and it was printed among his works, and he asserted that\r\n\"'The Toilet' is almost wholly Gay's,\" there being \"only five or six\r\nlines in it by that lady.\" \"The Toilet\" is included in his collected\r\nedition of Gay's poems.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter is best explained by that sound student of the\r\neighteenth century, \"George Paston,\" who suggests that the truth seems\r\nto be that the verses were handed round in manuscript to be read and\r\ncorrected by the writer's literary friends, and therefore they owe\r\nsomething to the different hands. \"George Paston\" goes on to say: \"Lady\r\nMary was not unaware of the danger of this proceeding, for Richardson\r\nthe painter relates that on one occasion she showed Pope a copy of her\r\nverses in which she intended to make some trifling alterations, but\r\nrefused his help, saying, 'No, Pope, no touching, for then whatever is\r\ngood for anything will pass for yours, and the rest for mine.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EMBASSY TO THE PORTE--I (1716)\r\n\r\nMontagu loses his place at the Treasury--His antagonism against\r\nWalpole--Lady Mary, \"Dolly\" Walpole, and Molly Skerritt--The Earl and\r\nCountess of Mar leave England--Montagu appointed Ambassador to the\r\nPorte--Leaves England for Constantinople, accompanied by his\r\nwife--Letters during the Embassy to Constantinople--Rotterdam--Vienna--\r\nLady Mary at Court--Her gown--Her interest in clothes--Viennese\r\nsociety--Gallantry--Lady Mary's experience--Count Tarrocco--Precedence\r\nat Vienna--A nunnery--The Montagus visit the German Courts--A dangerous\r\ndrive--Prince Frederick (afterwards Prince of Wales)--Herrenhausen.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Wortley Montagu did not long hold office. Lord Halifax, First\r\nLord of the Treasury in the Townshend Administration, died in May, 1715,\r\nwhen his place was taken by Lord Carlisle, who, however, held it only\r\nuntil the following October. Carlisle was succeeded by Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, promoted from the less important but far more lucrative post of\r\nPaymaster-General. In the new Commission of the Treasury Montagu's name\r\ndid not appear. Why Montagu was removed has not transpired; it may,\r\nindeed, be that he resigned, for he had a strong dislike for the new\r\nMinister. There may also have been some family sentiment in the matter,\r\nfor while Lady Mary was an intimate friend of Walpole's harum-scarum\r\nsister, \"Dolly,\" who was now Lady Townshend, Lady Walpole was very\r\ndecidedly her enemy. Lady Mary presently had her tit-for-tat with Lady\r\nWalpole by \"taking up\" Walpole's mistress, Molly Skerritt.\r\n\r\nIt may be here mentioned that Lady Mar was at this time living with her\r\nhusband at Paris, at St. Germain, and that she remained abroad for the\r\nrest of her life. She had left England owing to the conduct of Lord Mar\r\nin taking an active part in the rebellion of '15. He had set up the\r\nPretender's standard at Braemar, had suffered defeat at Sheriffmuir, and\r\nhad been so fortunate as to escape with his master to Gravelines. In\r\ngratitude for his services, the Pretender created Lord Mar a Duke. Mar\r\nlived until 1732, dying at the age of fifty-seven, and he spent the\r\nyears in losing the confidence of the Jacobites and endeavouring to\r\ningratiate himself with the Hanoverian Kings of England--in which latter\r\nquest he was markedly unsuccessful. His Scotch estates were confiscated,\r\nand his title attained--the attainder of the earldom was not reversed\r\nuntil 1824.\r\n\r\nMontagu, having tasted the sweets of office, even so minor a place as\r\nthat of a Lord of the Treasury, was not content to enjoy such pleasures\r\nas a private life could afford. He desired to be somebody. Probably he\r\nworried the Government of the day, possibly he pointed out to the\r\nleaders of the Whig Party that he was possessed of parts that should\r\nnot, in justice to his country, be ignored. He may even have approached\r\nthe Throne. It is not inconceivable that he made himself a nuisance to\r\nall concerned.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it was ultimately decided that something must be done with him.\r\nBut what? Austria and Turkey were at war in 1716; what better than to\r\nsend Montagu as Ambassador to the Porte, with a mission to endeavour to\r\nreconcile the protagonists? He was appointed to this post on June 5.\r\n\r\nIt was while accompanying her husband on this mission that Lady Mary\r\nwrote her famous \"Letters during the Embassy to Constantinople,\" which\r\nconstitute a very important document on the state of Europe at the time.\r\nIt is by no means certain, however, that, in the first instance, these\r\nreflections were all cast in letter-form; it is much more likely that\r\nsome were written in a diary. The letters appear as addressed to the\r\nCountess of Bristol, to the Princess of Wales, to Mrs. Thistlethwayte,\r\nto Lady Rich, to Alexander Pope, to the Abbé Conti, to Miss Sarah\r\nChiswell, to Mrs. Hewet, to Lady Mary's sister, the Countess of Mar, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August, 1716, Montagu, with his wife and son, and,\r\nit is to be presumed, his suite, left England, and, after a very bad\r\ncrossing, landed at Rotterdam. From that city, the cleanliness of which\r\nsurprised and delighted Lady Mary--\"you may see the Dutch maids washing\r\nthe pavement of the street with more application than ours do our\r\nbed-chambers\"--the party proceeded by way of the Hague, Nimeguen,\r\nCologne, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Wurzberg, and Ratisbon to Vienna, where\r\nthey arrived during the first week in September.\r\n\r\nLady Mary was all impatient to go to Court, for, as she put it, \"I am\r\nnot without a great impatience to see a beauty that has been the\r\nadmiration of so many nations,\" but she was forced to stay for a gown,\r\nwithout which there was no waiting on the Empress. Presently the gown\r\nwas ready, and Lady Mary was presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was squeezed up in a gown\" (she wrote to her sister, Lady Mar), \"and\r\nadorned with a gorget and the other implements thereunto belonging: a\r\ndress very inconvenient, but which certainly shews the neck and shape to\r\ngreat advantage. I cannot forbear in this place giving you some\r\ndescription of the fashions here which are more monstrous and contrary\r\nto all common sense and reason, than 'tis possible for you to imagine.\r\nThey build certain fabrics of gauze on their heads about a yard high,\r\nconsisting of three or four stories fortified with numberless yards of\r\nheavy ribbon. The foundation of this structure is a thing they call a\r\n_Bourle_ which is exactly of the same shape and kind, but about four\r\ntimes as big, as those rolls our prudent milk-maids make use of to fix\r\ntheir pails upon. This machine they cover with their own hair, which\r\nthey mix with a great deal of false, it being a particular beauty to\r\nhave their heads too large to go into a moderate tub. Their hair is\r\nprodigiously powdered, to conceal the mixture, and set out with three or\r\nfour rows of bodkins (wonderfully large, that stick [out] two or three\r\ninches from their hair), made of diamonds, pearls, red, green, and\r\nyellow stones, that it certainly requires as much art and experience to\r\ncarry the load upright, as to dance upon May-day with the garland. Their\r\nwhalebone petticoats outdo ours by several yards circumference, and\r\ncover some acres of ground.\r\n\r\n\"You may easily suppose how much this extraordinary dress sets off and\r\nimproves the natural ugliness with which God Almighty has been pleased\r\nto endow them all generally. Even the lovely Empress herself is obliged\r\nto comply, in some degree, with these absurd fashions, which they would\r\nnot quit for all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above passage is the more interesting because it has so often been\r\nasserted that Lady Mary took no interest in dress. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, there are several indications in her letters that she thought a\r\ngood deal about clothes.\r\n\r\n\"My little commission is hardly worth speaking of; if you have not\r\nalready laid out that small sum in St. Cloud ware, I had rather have it\r\nin plain lutestring of any colour,\" she wrote in June, 1721, to her\r\nsister, Lady Mar, at Paris.\r\n\r\n\"I would have no black silk, having bought here,\" she said on another\r\noccasion; and again, \"My paper is done, and I will only put you in mind\r\nof my lutestring, which I beg you will send me plain, of what colour you\r\nplease.\" \"Dear Sister, adieu,\" she wrote in 1723. \"I have been very free\r\nin this letter, because I think I am sure of its going safe. I wish my\r\nnightgown may do the same: I only choose that as most convenient to you;\r\nbut if it was equally so, I had rather the money was laid out in plain\r\nlutestring, if you could send me eight yards at a time of different\r\ncolours, designing it for linings; but if this scheme is impracticable,\r\nsend me a nightgown _à la mode_.\"\r\n\r\nApparently Lady Mar was careless or forgetful of the commission, for a\r\nlittle later Lady Mary was writing pathetically: \"I wish you would think\r\nof my lutestring, for I am in terrible want of linings.\"\r\n\r\nThe account of the Austrian Court of the day, as given by Lady Mary, is\r\ninvaluable, for there is no other available written by an English person\r\naccustomed to another Court.\r\n\r\nLady Mary's descriptions of Viennese society are also delightful, and if\r\nshe wrote of the royal circle with respect, she bubbled over with\r\nmerriment when writing of folk less highly placed. A letter of hers to\r\nLady Rich is too delicious to be omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have compassion for the mortifications that you tell me befall our\r\nlittle friend, and I pity her much more, since I know that they are only\r\nowing to the barbarous customs of our country. Upon my word, if she was\r\nhere, she would have no other fault but being something too young for\r\nthe fashion, and she has nothing to do but to transplant hither about\r\nseven years hence, to be again a young and blooming beauty. I can assure\r\nyou that wrinkles, or a small stoop in the shoulders, nay, even grey\r\nhair itself, is no objection to the making new conquests. I know you\r\ncannot easily figure to yourself a young fellow of five-and-twenty\r\nogling my Lady Suffolk with passion, or pressing to lead the Countess of\r\nOxford from an opera. But such are the sights I see every day, and I\r\ndon't perceive any body surprised at them but myself. A woman, till\r\nfive-and-thirty, is only looked upon as a raw girl, and can possibly\r\nmake no noise in the world till about forty. I don't know what your\r\nladyship may think of this matter; but 'tis a considerable comfort to\r\nme, to know there is upon earth such a paradise for old women; and I am\r\ncontent to be insignificant at present, in the design of returning when\r\nI am fit to appear nowhere else. I cannot help lamenting upon this\r\noccasion, the pitiful case of too many good English ladies, long since\r\nretired to prudery and ratafia, whom if their stars had luckily\r\nconducted hither, would still shine in the first rank of beauties; and\r\nthen that perplexing word reputation has quite another meaning here than\r\nwhat you give it at London; and getting a lover is so far from losing,\r\nthat 'tis properly getting reputation; ladies being much more\r\nrespected in regard to the rank of their lovers, than that of their\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\n\"But what you'll think very odd, the two sects that divide our whole\r\nnation of petticoats, are utterly unknown. Here are neither coquettes\r\nnor prudes. No woman dares appear coquette enough to encourage two\r\nlovers at a time. And I have not seen any such prudes as to pretend\r\nfidelity to their husbands, who are certainly the best-natured set of\r\npeople in the world, and they look upon their wives' gallants as\r\nfavourably as men do upon their deputies, that take the troublesome part\r\nof their business off of their hands; though they have not the less to\r\ndo; for they are generally deputies in another place themselves; in one\r\nword, 'tis the established custom for every lady to have two husbands,\r\none that bears the name, and another that performs the duties. And these\r\nengagements are so well known, that it would be a downright affront, and\r\npublicly resented, if you invited a woman of quality to dinner, without\r\nat the same time inviting her two attendants of lover and husband,\r\nbetween whom she always sits in state with great gravity. These\r\nsub-marriages generally last twenty years together, and the lady often\r\ncommands the poor lover's estate even to the utter ruin of his family;\r\nthough they are as seldom begun by any passion as other matches. But a\r\nman makes but an ill figure who is not in some commerce of this nature;\r\nand a woman looks out for a lover as soon as she's married, as part of\r\nher equipage, without which she could not be genteel; and the first\r\narticle of the treaty is establishing the pension, which remains to the\r\nlady though the gallant should prove inconstant; and this chargeable\r\npoint of honour I look upon as the real foundation of so many wonderful\r\ninstances of constancy. I really know several women of the first\r\nquality, whose pensions are as well known as their annual rents, and yet\r\nnobody esteems them the less; on the contrary, their discretion would be\r\ncalled in question, if they should be suspected to be mistresses for\r\nnothing; and a great part of their emulation consists in trying who\r\nshall get most; and having no intrigue at all is so far a disgrace that,\r\nI'll assure you, a lady, who is very much my friend here, told me but\r\nyesterday, how much I was obliged to her for justifying my conduct in a\r\nconversation on my subject, where it was publicly asserted that I could\r\nnot possibly have common sense, that I had been about town above a\r\nfortnight, and had made no steps towards commencing an amour. My friend\r\npleaded for me that my stay was uncertain; and she believed that was the\r\ncause of my seeming stupidity and this was all she could find to say in\r\nmy justification.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Lady Mary, though only twenty-seven, and therefore, according to her\r\nown account, much too youthful for the gallants of Vienna, yet had an\r\nexperience:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But one of the pleasantest adventures I ever met in my life was last\r\nnight, and which will give you a just idea after what a delicate manner\r\nthe _belles passions_ are managed in this country. I was at the assembly\r\nof the Countess of ----, and the young Count of ---- led me down stairs,\r\nand he asked me how long I intended to stay here? I made answer that my\r\nstay depended on the emperor, and it was not in my power to determine\r\nit. Well, madam, (said he), whether your time here is to be long or\r\nshort, I think you ought to pass it agreeably, and to that end you must\r\nengage in a little affair of the heart.--My heart (answered I gravely\r\nenough) does not engage very easily, and I have no design of parting\r\nwith it. I see, madam, (said he sighing,) by the ill nature of that\r\nanswer, that I am not to hope for it, which is a great mortification to\r\nme that am charmed with you. But, however, I am still devoted to your\r\nservice; and since I am not worthy of entertaining you myself, do me the\r\nhonour of letting me know whom you like best among us, and I'll engage\r\nto manage the affair entirely to your satisfaction.--You may judge in\r\nwhat manner I should have received this compliment in my own country,\r\nbut I was well enough acquainted with the way of this, to know that he\r\nreally intended me an obligation, and thanked him with a grave\r\ncourtesy for his zeal to serve me, and only assured him that I had no\r\noccasion to make use of it.\r\n\r\n\"Thus you see, my dear, gallantry and good-breeding are as different, in\r\ndifferent climates, as morality and religion. Who have the rightest\r\nnotions of both, we shall never know till the day of judgment, for which\r\ngreat day of _éclaircissement_, I own there is very little impatience in\r\nyour, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLove-making was indeed one of the principal pastimes at Vienna. There\r\nwas Count Tarrocco (who was in attendance on the Prince of Portugal),\r\nand, as she told Lady Mar, \"just such a Roman Catholic as you.\" \"He\r\nsucceeds greatly with the devout beauties here,\" she went on to say;\r\n\"his first overtures in gallantry are disguised under the luscious\r\nstrains of spiritual love, that were sung formerly by the sublimely\r\nvoluptuous Fenelon and the tender Madam Guion, who turned the spirit of\r\ncarnal love to divine objects; thus the Count begins with the spirit and\r\nends generally with the flesh, when he makes his addresses to holy\r\nvirgins.\" Presently, she teased her sister about this same young man.\r\n\"Count Tarrocco is just come in,\" she wrote. \"He is the only person I\r\nhave excepted in my general order to receive no company--I think I see\r\nyou smile--but I am not so far gone as to stand in need of absolution;\r\nthough as my heart is deceitful, and the Count very agreeable, you may\r\nthink that even though I should not want an absolution, I would\r\nnevertheless be glad to have an indulgence.--No such thing. However, as\r\nI am a heretic, and you no confessor, I shall make no more declarations\r\non this head.--The design of the Count's visit is a ball;--more\r\npleasure--I shall be surfeited.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"phlegm of the country\" surprised Lady Mary, who declared that it\r\nwas not from Austria that one could write with vivacity--and by her\r\nletters at once disproved her statement. According to her, amours and\r\nquarrels were carried on calmly and almost good-temperedly. Strong\r\nfeelings only came into play when points of ceremony were concerned. A\r\nman not only scorned to marry a woman of family less illustrious than\r\nhis own, but even to make love to her--\"the pedigree is much more\r\nconsidered by them than either the complexion or features of their\r\nmistresses. Happy are the shes that can number among their ancestors\r\nCounts of the Empire; they have neither occasion for beauty, money, or\r\ngood conduct to get them husbands.\" How far this passion for rank and\r\nprecedence went is indicated by an amusing incident related by Lady\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Tis not long since two coaches, meeting in a narrow street at night,\r\nthe ladies in them not being able to adjust the ceremonial of which\r\nshould go back, sat there with equal gallantry till two in the morning,\r\nand were both so fully determined to die upon the spot, rather than\r\nyield in a point of that importance, that the street would never have\r\nbeen cleared till their deaths, if the emperor had not sent his guards\r\nto part them; and even then they refused to stir, till the expedient was\r\nfound out of taking them both out in chairs exactly at the same moment;\r\nafter which it was with some difficulty the _pas_ was decided between\r\nthe two coachmen, no less tenacious of their rank than the ladies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary herself was, of course, unaffected, because, as the wife of an\r\nambassador, she, by their own customs, had the _pas_ before all other\r\nladies--to the great envy of the town.\r\n\r\nLady Mary, who had had enough of solitude during her long residence in\r\nYorkshire, now in Vienna was determined to enjoy herself and flung\r\nherself into all the social gaieties. She went everywhere and met\r\neveryone. She dined at the villa of Count Schönbrunn, the\r\nVice-Chancellor; she attended all the assemblies of Madame Rabutin and\r\nthe other leaders of society, and all the \"gala days\"; she danced; she\r\nwent to the theatre, and, then, as a contrast, to a nunnery, which left\r\nher unhappy, as, indeed, she put on record:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised to find here the only beautiful young woman I have\r\nseen at Vienna, and not only beautiful, but genteel, witty, and\r\nagreeable, of a great family, and who had been the admiration of the\r\ntown. I could not forbear shewing my surprise at seeing a nun like her.\r\nShe made me a thousand obliging compliments, and desired me to come\r\noften. It will be an infinite pleasure to me, (said she, sighing,) to\r\nsee you; but I avoid, with the greatest care, seeing any of my former\r\nacquaintance, and whenever they come to our convent, I lock myself in\r\nmy cell. I observed tears come into her eyes, which touched me\r\nextremely, and I began to talk to her in that strain of tender pity she\r\ninspired me with; but she would not own to me that she is not perfectly\r\nhappy. I have since endeavoured to learn the real cause of her\r\nretirement, without being able to get any other account, but that every\r\nbody was surprised at it, and nobody guessed the reason.\r\n\r\n\"I have been several times to see her; but it gives me too much\r\nmelancholy to see so agreeable a young creature buried alive, and I am\r\nnot surprised that nuns have so often inspired violent passions; the\r\npity one naturally feels for them, when they seem worthy of another\r\ndestiny, making an easy way for yet more tender sentiments; and I never\r\nin my life had so little charity for the Roman-catholic religion as\r\nsince I see the misery it occasions; so many poor unhappy women! and the\r\ngross superstition of the common people, who are, some or other of them,\r\nday and night offering bits of candle to the wooden figures that are set\r\nup almost in every street. The processions I see very often, are a\r\npageantry as offensive, and apparently contradictory to all common\r\nsense, as the pagodas of China. God knows whether it be the womanly\r\nspirit of contradiction that works in me; but there never before was so\r\nmuch zeal against popery in the heart of,\r\n\r\n\"Dear madam, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November the Montagus interrupted their stay at Vienna to visit some\r\nof the German Courts. They went to Prague, where the attire of the\r\nladies amused Lady Mary. \"I have been visited by some of the most\r\nconsiderable ladies, whose relations I know at Vienna,\" she wrote to\r\nLady Mar. \"They are dressed after the fashions there, as people at\r\nExeter imitate those of London; that is, the imitation is more excessive\r\nthan the original; 'tis not easy to describe what extraordinary figures\r\nthey make. The person is so much lost between head-dress and petticoat,\r\nthey have as much occasion to write upon their backs 'This is a woman,'\r\nfor the information of travellers, as ever sign-post painter had to\r\nwrite, 'This is a bear.'\" From Prague to Dresden, travelling thither by\r\na most alarming route:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You may imagine how heartily I was tired with twenty-four hours'\r\npost-travelling [to Dresden], without sleep or refreshment (for I can\r\nnever sleep in a coach, however fatigued). We passed by moonshine the\r\nfrightful precipices that divide Bohemia from Saxony, at the bottom of\r\nwhich runs the river Elbe; but I cannot say that I had reason to fear\r\ndrowning in it, being perfectly convinced that, in case of a tumble, it\r\nwas utterly impossible to come alive to the bottom. In many places the\r\nroad is so narrow, that I could not discern an inch of space between the\r\nwheels and the precipice. Yet I was so good a wife not to wake Mr.\r\nWortley, who was fast asleep by my side, to make him share in my fears,\r\nsince the danger was unavoidable, till I perceived by the bright light\r\nof the moon, our postilions nodding on horseback, while the horses were\r\non a full gallop, and I thought it very convenient to call out to desire\r\nthem to look where they were going. My calling waked Mr. Wortley, and he\r\nwas much more surprised than myself at the situation we were in, and\r\nassured me that he had passed the Alps five times in different places,\r\nwithout ever having gone a road so dangerous. I have been told since it\r\nis common to find the bodies of travellers in the Elbe; but, thank God,\r\nthat was not our destiny; and we came safe to Dresden, so much tired\r\nwith fear and fatigue, it was not possible for me to compose myself to\r\nwrite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Dresden the travellers visited Leipzig, and then went to Brunswick,\r\nand afterwards to Hanover, where they paid their respects to George I.\r\nIt was there that Lady Mary first made the acquaintance of the eldest\r\nson of the Prince of Wales, Frederick Louis, himself presently Prince\r\nof Wales and father of George III. He was then nine years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am extremely pleased that I can tell you, without either flattery or\r\npartiality, that our young Prince has all the accomplishments that it is\r\npossible to have at his age, with an air of sprightliness and\r\nunderstanding, and something so very engaging and easy in his behaviour,\r\nthat he needs not the advantage of his rank to appear charming. I had\r\nthe honour of a long conversation with him last night, before the King\r\ncame in. His governor retired on purpose (as he told me afterwards) that\r\nI might make some judgment of his genius, by hearing him speak without\r\nconstraint; and I was surprised at the quickness and politeness that\r\nappeared in every thing he said; joined to a person perfectly agreeable,\r\nand the fine fair hair of the Princess.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmazed as Lady Mary was at the size of the Palace at Hanover which, she\r\nsaid, was capable of holding a greater court than that of St. James's,\r\nand the opera-house which was larger than that at Vienna, what\r\nprincipally amazed her was the orangery at Herrenhausen and what\r\nprincipally delighted her was the use of stoves, then unknown in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was very sorry that the ill weather did not permit me to see\r\nHerrenhausen in all its beauty; but, in spite of the snow, I thought the\r\ngardens very fine\" (she wrote with enthusiasm to Lady Mar). \"I was\r\nparticularly surprised at the vast number of orange trees, much larger\r\nthan I have ever seen in England, though this climate is certainly\r\ncolder. But I had more reason to wonder that night at the King's table.\r\nThere was brought to him from a gentleman of this country, two large\r\nbaskets full of ripe oranges and lemons of different sorts, many of\r\nwhich were quite new to me; and, what I thought worth all the rest, two\r\nripe bananas, which, to my taste, are a fruit perfectly delicious. You\r\nknow they are naturally the growth of Brazil, and I could not imagine\r\nhow they could come there but by enchantment. Upon enquiry, I learnt\r\nthat they have brought their stoves to such perfection, they lengthen\r\nthe summer as long as they please, giving to every plant the degree of\r\nheat it would receive from the sun in its native soil. The effect is\r\nvery near the same; I am surprised we do not practise in England so\r\nuseful an invention.\r\n\r\n\"This reflection naturally leads me to consider our obstinacy in shaking\r\nwith cold six months in the year, rather than make use of stoves, which\r\nare certainly one of the greatest conveniences of life; and so far from\r\nspoiling the form of a room, they add very much to the magnificence of\r\nit, when they are painted and gilt, as at Vienna, or at Dresden, where\r\nthey are often in the shape of china jars, statues, or fine cabinets, so\r\nnaturally represented, they are not to be distinguished. If ever I\r\nreturn, in defiance to the fashion, you shall certainly see one in the\r\nchamber of,\r\n\r\n\"Dear sister, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE EMBASSY TO THE PORTE--II(1717-1718)\r\n\r\nAdrianople--Turkish baths--Lady Mary wears Turkish dress--Her\r\ndescription of the costume--Her views on Turkish women--She becomes\r\nacquainted with the practice of inoculation--Her son engrafted--Her\r\nbelief in the operation--She later introduces it into England--Dr.\r\nRichard Mead--Richard Steele supports her campaign--Constantinople--Lady\r\nMary homesick--Exposes the British ignorance of Turkish life--Montagu\r\nrecalled--Addison's private letter to him--Lady Mary gives birth to a\r\ndaughter--The return journey--The Montagus at Paris--Lady Mary sees her\r\nsister, Lady Mar.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Montagus returned to Vienna for the new year (1717), but late in\r\nJanuary went to Peterwaradin, thence to Belgrade, and arrived at\r\nAdrianople at the end of March. It was in Adrianople that Lady Mary made\r\nacquaintance with the Turkish Bath, which so impressed her that she sent\r\nhome a long account of it. It was not until about 1860 that they became\r\npopular in England, a century and a half later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I went to the bagnio about ten o'clock. It was already full of women.\r\nIt is built of stone, in the shape of a dome, with no windows but in the\r\nroof, which gives light enough, There were five of these domes joined\r\ntogether, the outmost being less than the rest, and serving only as a\r\nhall, where the portress stood at the door. Ladies of quality generally\r\ngive this woman the value of a crown or ten shillings; and I did not\r\nforget that ceremony. The next room is a very large one paved with\r\nmarble, and all round it, raised, two sofas of marble, one above\r\nanother. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling\r\nfirst into marble basins, and then running on the floor in little\r\nchannels made for that purpose, which carried the streams into the next\r\nroom, something less than this, with the same sort of marble sofas but\r\nso hot with steams of sulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it,\r\nit was impossible to stay there with one's clothes on. The two other\r\ndomes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning\r\ninto it, to temper it to what degree of warmth the bathers have a mind\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\"I was in my travelling habit, which is a riding dress, and certainly\r\nappeared very extraordinary to them. Yet there was not one of them that\r\nshewed the least surprise or impertinent curiosity, but received me with\r\nall the obliging civility possible. I know no European court where the\r\nladies would have behaved themselves in so polite a manner to a\r\nstranger. I believe in the whole, there were two hundred women, and yet\r\nnone of those disdainful smiles, or satiric whispers, that never fail in\r\nour assemblies when any body appears that is not dressed exactly in the\r\nfashion. They repeated over and over to me, \"Uzelle, pék uzelle,\" which\r\nis nothing but Charming, very charming.--The first sofas were covered\r\nwith cushions and rich carpets, on which sat the ladies; and on the\r\nsecond, their slaves behind them, but without any distinction of rank by\r\ntheir dress, all being in the state of nature, that is, in plain\r\nEnglish, stark naked, without any beauty or defect concealed. Yet there\r\nwas not the least wanton smile or immodest gesture amongst them. They\r\nwalked and moved with the same majestic grace which Milton describes of\r\nour general mother. There were many amongst them as exactly proportioned\r\nas ever any goddess was drawn by the pencil of Guido or Titian,--and\r\nmost of their skins shiningly white, only adorned by their beautiful\r\nhair divided into many tresses, hanging on their shoulders, braided\r\neither with pearl or ribbon, perfectly representing the figures of the\r\nGraces.\r\n\r\n\"I was here convinced of the truth of a reflection I had often made,\r\nthat if it was the fashion to go naked, the face would be hardly\r\nobserved. I perceived that the ladies with the finest skins and most\r\ndelicate shapes had the greatest share of my admiration, though their\r\nfaces were sometimes less beautiful than those of their companions. To\r\ntell you the truth, I had wickedness enough to wish secretly that Mr.\r\nJervas[3] could have been there invisible. I fancy it would have very\r\nmuch improved his art, to see so many fine women naked, in different\r\npostures, some in conversation, some working, others drinking coffee or\r\nsherbet, and many negligently lying on their cushions, while their\r\nslaves (generally pretty girls of seventeen or eighteen) were employed\r\nin braiding their hair in several pretty fancies. In short, it is the\r\nwomen's coffee-house, where all the news of the town is told, scandal\r\ninvented, &c.--They generally take this diversion once a-week, and stay\r\nthere at least four or five hours without getting cold by immediate\r\ncoming out of the hot bath into the cold room, which was very surprising\r\nto me. The lady that seemed the most considerable among them, entreated\r\nme to sit by her, and would fain have undressed me for the bath. I\r\nexcused myself with some difficulty. They being all so earnest in\r\npersuading me, I was at last forced to open my shirt, and shew them my\r\nstays; which satisfied them very well, for, I saw, they believed I was\r\nso locked up in that machine, that it was not in my own power to open\r\nit, which contrivance they attributed to my husband.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Charles Jervas (1675?-1739), portrait painter and\r\ntranslator of _Don Quixote_, the friend of Pope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was much amused by this last, and referred to the incident in\r\nconversation with Joseph Spence. \"One of the highest entertainments in\r\nTurkey,\" she told him, \"is having you to their baths, and when I was\r\nintroduced the lady of the house came to undress me, which is another\r\nhigh compliment that they pay to strangers. After she had slipped off my\r\ngown and seen my stays she was much struck at the sight of them and\r\ncried out to the other ladies in the bath 'Come hither and see how\r\ncruelly the poor English ladies are used by their husbands. You need\r\nboast indeed of the superior liberties allowed you, when they lock you\r\nup in a box!'\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary had a Turkish dress made for her, which she frequently wore,\r\nwhen she found that the English costume made her unpleasantly\r\nconspicuous. \"The ladies at Constantinople used to be extremely\r\nsurprised to see me go always with my bosom uncovered,\" she noted. \"It\r\nwas in vain that I told them that everybody did the same thing among us,\r\nand alleged everything I could in defence of it. They could never be\r\nreconciled to so immodest a custom, as they thought it; and one of them,\r\nafter I had been defending it to my utmost, said: 'Oh, my Sultana, you\r\ncan never defend the manners of your country, even with all your wit;\r\nbut I see that you are in pain for them, and shall, therefore, press it\r\nno further.'\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary was proud of her appearance in her Turkish clothes, and has\r\ngiven a minute description of them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The first piece of my dress is a pair of drawers, very full, that reach\r\nto my shoes, and conceal the legs more modestly than your petticoats.\r\nThey are of a thin rose-coloured damask, brocaded with silver flowers,\r\nmy shoes are of white kid leather, embroidered with gold. Over this\r\nhangs my smock, of a fine white silk gauze, edged with embroidery. This\r\nsmock has wide sleeves, hanging half way down the arm, and is closed at\r\nthe neck with a diamond button; but the shape and colour of the bosom\r\nvery well to be distinguished through it. The _antery_ is a waistcoat,\r\nmade close to the shape, of white and gold damask, with very long\r\nsleeves falling back, and fringed with deep gold fringe, and should have\r\ndiamond or pearl buttons. My _caftan_, of the same stuff with my\r\ndrawers, is a robe exactly fitted to my shape, and reaching to my feet,\r\nwith very long strait falling sleeves. Over this is the girdle, of about\r\nfour fingers broad, which all that can afford have entirely of diamonds\r\nor other precious stones; those who will not be at that expense, have\r\nit of exquisite embroidery on satin; but it must be fastened before with\r\na clasp of diamonds. The _curdee_ is a loose robe they throw off or put\r\non according to the weather, being of a rich brocade (mine is green and\r\ngold), either lined with ermine or sables; the sleeves reach very little\r\nbelow the shoulders. The head-dress is composed of a cap, called\r\n_talpock_, which is in winter of fine velvet embroidered with pearls or\r\ndiamonds, and in summer of a light shining silver stuff. This is fixed\r\non one side of the head, hanging a little way down with a gold tassel,\r\nand bound on either side with a circle of diamonds (as I have seen\r\nseveral) or a rich embroidered handkerchief. On the other side of the\r\nhead, the hair is laid flat; and here the ladies are at liberty to shew\r\ntheir fancies; some putting flowers, others a plume of heron's feathers,\r\nand, in short, what they please; but the most general fashion is a large\r\n_bouquet_ of jewels, made like natural flowers; that is the buds of\r\npearl; the roses, of different coloured rubies; the jessamines, of\r\ndiamonds; the jonquils, of topazes, &c., so well set and enamelled, 'tis\r\nhard to imagine any thing of that kind so beautiful. The hair hangs at\r\nits full length behind, divided into tresses braided with pearl or\r\nribbon, which is always in great quantity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch that Lady Mary wrote was of great value in exploding many\r\nill-founded beliefs at home as regards Turkish life, and especially\r\nconcerning the manners and customs of Turkish women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As to their morality or good conduct, I can say, like Harlequin, that\r\n'tis just as it is with you; and the Turkish ladies don't commit one sin\r\nthe less for not being Christians. Now I am a little acquainted with\r\ntheir ways, I cannot forbear admiring either the exemplary discretion or\r\nextreme stupidity of all the writers that have given accounts of them.\r\n'Tis very easy to see they have more liberty than we have. No woman, of\r\nwhat rank soever, being permitted to go into the streets without two\r\nmuslins; one that covers her face all but her eyes, and another that\r\nhides the whole dress of her head, and hangs half way down her back, and\r\ntheir shapes are wholly concealed by a thing they call a _ferigee_,\r\nwhich no woman of any sort appears without; this has strait sleeves,\r\nthat reach to their finger-ends, and it laps all round them, not unlike\r\na riding-hood. In winter 'tis of cloth, and in summer plain stuff or\r\nsilk. You may guess how effectually this disguises them, [so] that there\r\nis no distinguishing the great lady from her slave. 'Tis impossible for\r\nthe most jealous husband to know his wife when he meets her; and no man\r\ndare either touch or follow a woman in the street.\r\n\r\n\"This perpetual masquerade gives them entire liberty of following their\r\ninclinations without danger of discovery. The most usual method of\r\nintrigue is, to send an appointment to the lover to meet the lady at a\r\nJew's shop, which are as notoriously convenient as our Indian-houses;\r\nand yet, even those who don't make use of them, do not scruple to go to\r\nbuy pennyworths, and tumble over rich goods, which are chiefly to be\r\nfound amongst that sort of people. The great ladies seldom let their\r\ngallants know who they are; and it is so difficult to find it out, that\r\nthey can very seldom guess at her name they have corresponded with above\r\nhalf a year together. You may easily imagine the number of faithful\r\nwives very small in a country where they have nothing to fear from a\r\nlover's indiscretion, since we see so many that have the courage to\r\nexpose themselves to that in this world, and all the threatened\r\npunishment of the next, which is never preached to the Turkish damsels.\r\nNeither have they much to apprehend from the resentment of their\r\nhusbands; those ladies that are rich having all their money in their own\r\nhands, which they take with them upon a divorce, with an addition which\r\nhe is obliged to give them.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole, I look upon the Turkish women as the only free people\r\nin the empire: the very Divan pays a respect to them; and the Grand\r\nSignior himself, when a pasha is executed, never violates the privileges\r\nof the _harem_ (or women's apartment), which remains unsearched and\r\nentire to the widow. They are queens of their slaves, whom the husband\r\nhas no permission so much as to look upon, except it be an old woman or\r\ntwo that his lady chooses. 'Tis true their law permits them four wives;\r\nbut there is no instance of a man of quality that makes use of this\r\nliberty, or of a woman of rank that would suffer it. When a husband\r\nhappens to be inconstant (as those things will happen), he keeps his\r\nmistress in a house apart, and visits her as privately as he can, just\r\nas it is with you. Amongst all the great men here, I only know the\r\n_tefterdar_ (i.e., treasurer), that keeps a number of she slaves for his\r\nown use (that is, on his own side of the house; for a slave once given\r\nto serve a lady is entirely at her disposal), and he is spoken of as a\r\nlibertine, or what we should call a rake, and his wife won't see him,\r\nthough she continues to live in his house.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, you see, dear sister, the manners of mankind do not differ so\r\nwidely as our voyage writers would make us believe. Perhaps it would be\r\nmore entertaining to add a few surprising customs of my own invention;\r\nbut nothing seems to me so agreeable as truth, and I believe nothing so\r\nacceptable to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most fortunate thing that happened to Lady Mary, and through her to\r\nEngland, during her stay in Adrianople, was being made acquainted with\r\nthe practice of inoculation, then widely in vogue in Turkey. Though she\r\nhad no medical knowledge, she made enquiries as to its effect, and soon\r\nbecame convinced that it was very highly beneficial. She was the more\r\ninterested because an attack of small-pox had somewhat dimmed her\r\nbeauty. It was to Miss Sarah Chiswell that she unburdened herself of the\r\ndiscovery she had made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Those dreadful stories you have heard of the plague have very little\r\nfoundation in truth. I own I have much ado to reconcile myself to the\r\nsound of a word which has always given me such terrible ideas, though I\r\nam convinced there is little more in it than a fever. As a proof of\r\nwhich we passed through two or three towns most violently infected. In\r\nthe very next house where we lay (in one of those places) two persons\r\ndied of it. Luckily for me, I was so well deceived that I knew nothing\r\nof the matter; and I was made believe, that our second cook who fell ill\r\nhere had only a great cold. However, we left our doctor to take care of\r\nhim, and yesterday they both arrived here in good health; and I am now\r\nlet into the secret that he has had the _plague_. There are many that\r\nescape it; neither is the air ever infected. I am persuaded it would be\r\nas easy to root it out here as out of Italy and France; but it does so\r\nlittle mischief, they are not very solicitous about it, and are content\r\nto suffer this distemper instead of our variety, which they are utterly\r\nunacquainted with.\r\n\r\n\"_A propos_ of distempers, I am going to tell you a thing that I am sure\r\nwill make you wish yourself here. The small-pox, so fatal, and so\r\ngeneral amongst us, is here entirely harmless by the invention of\r\n_ingrafting_, which is the term they give it. There is a set of old\r\nwomen who make it their business to perform the operation every autumn,\r\nin the month of September, when the great heat is abated. People send to\r\none another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the\r\nsmall-pox; they make parties for this purpose, and when they are met\r\n(commonly fifteen or sixteen together), the old woman comes with a\r\nnut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox, and asks\r\nwhat veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you\r\noffer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a\r\ncommon scratch), and puts into the vein as much venom as can lie upon\r\nthe head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a\r\nhollow bit of shell; and in this manner opens four or five veins. The\r\nGrecians have commonly the superstition of opening one in the midde of\r\nthe forehead, in each arm, and on the breast, to mark the sign of the\r\ncross; but this has a very ill effect, all these wounds leaving little\r\nscars, and is not done by those that are not superstitious, who choose\r\nto have them in the legs, or that part of the arm that is concealed. The\r\nchildren or young patients play together all the rest of the day, and\r\nare in perfect health to the eighth. Then the fever begins to seize\r\nthem, and they keep their beds two days, very seldom three. They have\r\nvery rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark; and\r\nin eight days' time they are as well as before their illness. Where they\r\nare wounded, there remain running sores during the distemper, which I\r\ndon't doubt is a great relief to it. Every year thousands undergo this\r\noperation; and the French embassador says pleasantly, that they take the\r\nsmall-pox here by way of diversion, as they take the waters in other\r\ncountries. There is no example of any one that has died in it; and you\r\nmay believe I am very well satisfied of the safety of this experiment,\r\nsince I intend to try it on my dear little son.\r\n\r\n\"I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention into\r\nfashion in England; and I should not fail to write to some of our\r\ndoctors very particularly about it, if I knew any one of them that I\r\nthought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their\r\nrevenue for the good of mankind. But that distemper is too beneficial to\r\nthem not to expose to all their resentment the hardy wight that should\r\nundertake to put an end to it. Perhaps, if I live to return, I may,\r\nhowever, have courage to war with them. Upon this occasion admire the\r\nheroism in the heart of your friend, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immediate history of inoculation, so far as Lady Mary is concerned,\r\nmay here briefly be given. She first heard of the practice in March,\r\n1717, and within a year her faith in its effect was so strong that in\r\nthe spring of the following year she had her son inoculated at Pera--he\r\nwas the first English person to undergo the operation. \"The boy was\r\nengrafted last Tuesday,\" she wrote to her husband the following Sunday,\r\n\"and is at this time singing and playing, and very impatient for his\r\nsupper.... I cannot engraft the girl; her nurse has not had the\r\nsmall-pox.\" It is amusing to learn that the inoculation of the young\r\nEdward Wortley Montagu proved presently to have an advantage which was\r\ncertainly not at the time of the operation present to the mind of the\r\nmother. At the age of six or thereabouts, the child ran away from\r\nWestminster school--he was always running away from school--and a reward\r\nof £20 and expenses was offered to whoever found him. The advertisement\r\ngave the following clue: there are \"two marks by which he is easily\r\nknown, _viz_., on the back of each arm, about two or three inches above\r\nthe wrist, a small roundish scar, less than a silver penny, like a large\r\nmark of the small-pox.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Mary returned to London, she carried out her intention to\r\nintroduce the operation. Dr. Maitland, who had been physician to the\r\nmission to the Porte, set up in practice and inoculated under her\r\npatronage. The \"heathen rite\" was vigorously preached against by the\r\nclergy and was violently abused by the medical faculty. Undismayed by\r\nthe powerful opposition, however, she persevered in season and out,\r\nuntil her efforts were crowned with success. She was fortunate in\r\nenlisting the co-operation of that distinguished doctor, Richard Mead,\r\ncelebrated by Pope in his \"Epistle to Bolingbroke,\"\r\n\r\n  \"I'll do what Mead and Cheselden advise.\"\r\n\r\nMead, in 1720, when an epidemic of the plague was feared in London,\r\npublished a treatise: \"A Short Discourse concerning Pestilential\r\nContagion and the Methods to be used to Prevent it.\" It was reprinted\r\nseven times within a year, and an eighth edition appeased in 1722. Lady\r\nMary obtained permission, in 1721, to experiment on seven condemned\r\ncriminals. Mead supervised the inoculations, and all recovered. In the\r\nfollowing year two members of the royal family underwent the operation\r\nsuccessfully. Thereafter, it became, in most circles, fashionable.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" Lady Mary wrote with pardonable pride to Lady Mar in the\r\nspring of 1722, \"that the same faithful historians give you regular\r\naccounts of the growth and spreading of the inoculation of the\r\nsmall-pox, which is become almost a general practice, attended with\r\ngreat success.\" Elated as she was at the success that had resulted from\r\nher persistent efforts, she was correspondingly distressed when a young\r\nrelative died of the disease. \"I am sorry to inform you of the death, of\r\nour nephew, my sister Gower's son, of the small-pox,\" she said in a\r\nletter to Lady Mar in July, 1723. \"I think she has a great deal of\r\nregret it, in consideration of the offer I made her, two years together,\r\nof taking the child home to my house, where I would have inoculated him\r\nwith the same care and safety I did my own. I know nobody that has\r\nhitherto repented the operation; though it has been very troublesome to\r\nsome fools, who had rather be sick by the doctor's prescriptions, than\r\nin health in rebellion to the college.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those who supported Lady Mary's campaign was Steele, who\r\ncongratulated her upon her \"godlike delight\" of saving \"many thousand\r\nBritish lives every year.\" He wrote on the subject in the _Plain Dealer_\r\n(July 3, 1724), in an article that attracted much attention:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is the Observation of some Historian; but I forget where I met with\r\nit: that _England has ow'd to Women the greatest Blessings she has been\r\ndistinguish'd by_. In the Case, we are now upon, this Reflection will\r\nstand justified.--\r\n\r\n\"We are indebted to the Reason and Courage of a _Lady_, for the\r\nIntroduction of this Art; which gives such Strength in its Progress,\r\nthat the Memory of its Illustrious Foundress will be render'd Sacred by\r\nit, to future Ages.\r\n\r\n\"This Ornament of her Sex, and Country, who ennobles her own _Nobility_,\r\nby her Learning, Wit, and Vertues, accompanying her Consort into\r\n_Turkey_, observ'd the Benefit of this Practice, with its Frequency,\r\neven among those obstinate _Proedestinarians_; and brought it over, for\r\nthe Service, and the Safety, of her Native _England_; where she\r\nconsecrated its first effects on the Persons of her own fine Children!\r\nAnd has, already, receiv'd this Glory from it, 'That the Influence of\r\nher example has reach'd as high as the Blood Royal.'

It was really very dull for her in Turkey, even\r\nthough she could pass the time of day in the language of the country.\r\nSupervising the nurses of her child did not take a large share of her\r\ntune; and she found only a mild excitement in going into the bazaar in\r\nnative woman's attire to collect Oriental rugs and whatnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To say truth, I am sometimes very weary of this singing, and dancing,\r\nand sunshine, and wish for the smoke and impertinencies in which you\r\ntoil, though I endeavour to persuade myself that I live in a more\r\nagreeable variety than you do; and that Monday, setting of partridges--\r\nTuesday, reading English--Wednesday, studying the Turkish language (in\r\nwhich, by the way, I am already very learned)--Thursday, classical\r\nauthors--Friday, spent in writing--Saturday, at my needle--and Sunday,\r\nadmitting of visits, and hearing music, is a better way of disposing\r\nthe week, than Monday, at the drawing-room--Tuesday, Lady Mohun's--\r\nWednesday, the opera--Thursday, the play--Friday, Mrs. Chetwynd's, &c.,\r\na perpetual round of hearing the same scandal, and seeing the same\r\nfollies acted over and over, which here affect me no more than they do\r\nother dead people. I can now hear of displeasing things with pity, and\r\nwithout indignation. The reflection on the great gulf between you and me,\r\ncools all news that come hither. I can neither be sensibly touched with\r\njoy nor grief, when I consider that possibly the cause of either is\r\nremoved before the letter comes to my hands. But (as I said before) this\r\nindolence does not extend to my few friendships; I am still warmly\r\nsensible of yours and Mr. Congreve's, and desire to live in your \\\r\nremembrances, though dead to all the world beside.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that it was to her pen that Lady Mary had recourse in\r\nher endeavours to overcome ennui. A perusal of the letters written\r\nduring this first sojourn in Europe shows that nothing escaped her eye,\r\ntrivial or serious, from the washing of the Rotterdam pavements to the\r\ndwarfs at the Court of Vienna, from the palaces of the great to the\r\ncosmetics used by the women.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Lady Mary became impatient at the ignorance of her friends\r\nas regards the Near East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I heartily beg your ladyship's pardon; but I really could not forbear\r\nlaughing heartily at your letter, and the commissions you are pleased to\r\nhonour me with\" (she wrote to one of her acquaintances from Belgrade\r\nVillage in June, 1717).\r\n\r\n\"You desire me to buy you a Greek slave, who is to be mistress of a\r\nthousand good qualities. The Greeks are subjects, and not slaves. Those\r\nwho are to be bought in that manner, are either such as are taken in\r\nwar, or stolen by the Tartars from Russia, Circassia, or Georgia, and\r\nare such miserable, awkward, poor wretches, you would not think any of\r\nthem worthy to be your housemaids. 'Tis true that many thousands were\r\ntaken in the Morea; but they have been, most of them, redeemed by the\r\ncharitable contributions of the Christians, or ransomed by their own\r\nrelations at Venice. The fine slaves that wait upon the great ladies, or\r\nserve the pleasures of the great men, are all bought at the age of eight\r\nor nine years old, and educated with great care, to accomplish them in\r\nsinging, dancing, embroidery, &c. They are commonly Circassians, and\r\ntheir patron never sells them, except it is as a punishment for some\r\nvery great fault. If ever they grow weary of them, they either present\r\nthem to a friend, or give them their freedom. Those that are exposed to\r\nsale at the markets are always either guilty of some crime, or so\r\nentirely worthless that they are of no use at all. I am afraid you will\r\ndoubt the truth of this account, which I own is very different from our\r\ncommon notions in England; but it is no less truth for all that.\r\n\r\n\"Your whole letter is full of mistakes from one end to the other. I see\r\nyou have taken your ideas of Turkey from that worthy author Dumont, who\r\nhas written with equal ignorance and confidence. 'Tis a particular\r\npleasure to me here, to read the voyages to the Levant, which are\r\ngenerally so far removed from the truth, and so full of absurdities, I\r\nam very well diverted with them. They never fail giving you an account\r\nof the women, whom 'tis certain they never saw, and talking very wisely\r\nof the genius of the men, into whose company they are never admitted;\r\nand very often describe mosques, which they dare not peep into. The\r\nTurks are very proud, and will not converse with a stranger they are not\r\nassured is considerable in his own country. I speak of the men of\r\ndistinction; for, as to the ordinary fellows, you may imagine what ideas\r\ntheir conversation can give of the general genius of the people.\r\n\r\n\"I am more inclined, out of a true female spirit of contradiction, to\r\ntell you the falsehood of a great part of what you find in authors; as,\r\nfor example, in the admirable Mr. Hill, who so gravely asserts, that he\r\nsaw in Sancta Sophia a sweating pillar, very balsamic for disordered\r\nheads. There is not the least tradition of any such matter; and I\r\nsuppose it was revealed to him in a vision during his wonderful stay in\r\nthe Egyptian catacombs; for I am sure he never heard of any such miracle\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis also very pleasant to observe how tenderly he and all his brethren\r\nvoyage-writers lament the miserable confinement of the Turkish ladies,\r\nwho are perhaps freer than any ladies in the universe, and are the only\r\nwomen in the world that lead a life of uninterrupted pleasure exempt\r\nfrom cares; their whole time being spent in visiting, bathing, or the\r\nagreeable amusement of spending money, and inventing new fashions. A\r\nhusband would be thought mad that exacted any degree of economy from his\r\nwife, whose expenses are no way limited but by her own fancy. 'Tis his\r\nbusiness to get money, and hers to spend it: and this noble prerogative\r\nextends itself to the very meanest of the sex. Here is a fellow that\r\ncarries embroidered handkerchiefs upon his back to sell, as miserable a\r\nfigure as you may suppose such a mean dealer, yet I'll assure you his\r\nwife scorns to wear anything less than cloth of gold; has her ermine\r\nfurs, and a very handsome set of jewels for her head. They go abroad\r\nwhen and where they please. Tis true they have no public places but the\r\nbagnios, and there can only be seen by their own sex; however, that is a\r\ndiversion they take great pleasure in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Montagu's conduct of affairs was much criticised at\r\nhome, and Lord Stanhope's Administration, which had come into power in\r\nApril, 1717, decided to recall him. This invidious task fell upon his\r\nold friend Addison, now Secretary of State for the Southern Department.\r\nThe recall was notified to those concerned in a circular letter dated\r\nOctober 13. Addison, in a private letter dated September 28, notified\r\nhim of the impending change:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Having been confined to my chamber for some time by a dangerous fit of\r\nsickness, I find, upon my coming abroad, some things have passed which I\r\nthink myself obliged to communicate to you, not as the Secretary to the\r\nAmbassador, but as an humble servant to his friend.... Our great men are\r\nof opinion that your being possessed [of the reversion of certain\r\nplaces] (which they look upon as sure and sudden) it would be agreeable\r\nto your inclinations, as well as for the King's service, which you are\r\nso able to promote in Parliament, rather to return to your own country\r\nthan to live at Constantinople. For this reason, they have thought of\r\nrelieving Mr. Stanyan, who is now at the Imperial Court, and of joining\r\nSir Robert Sutton with him in the mediation of a peace between the\r\nEmperor and the Turks. I need not suggest to you that Mr. Stanyan is in\r\ngreat favour at Vienna, and how necessary it is to humour that Court in\r\nthe present juncture. Besides, as it would have been for your honour to\r\nhave acted as sole mediator in such a negotiation, perhaps it would not\r\nhave been so agreeable to you to act only in commission. This was\r\nsuggested to me the other day by one of our first ministers, who told me\r\nthat he believed Sir R. Sutton's being joined in a mediation, which was\r\ncarried on by my Lord Paget singly, would be shocking to you, but that\r\nthey could be more free with a person of Mr. Stanyan's quality. I find\r\nby his Majesty's way of speaking of you, that you are much in his favour\r\nand esteem, and I fancy you would find your ease and advantage more in\r\nbeing nearer his person than at the distance you are from him at\r\npresent. I omit no opportunity of doing you justice where I think it is\r\nfor your service, and wish I could know your mind as to these several\r\nparticulars by a more speedy and certain conveyance, that I might act\r\naccordingly to the utmost of my powers. Madame Kielmansegg and my Lady\r\nHervey desire me to forward the enclosed to my Lady Mary Wortley, to\r\nwhom I beg you will deliver them with my most humble regards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Montagu's feelings were can only be imagined. It is almost certain\r\nthat he felt himself vastly aggrieved. Nothing could have been more\r\ndelicate or complimentary than Addison's letter, but it did not, and\r\ncould not, disguise the main fact. It was easy for the Secretary of\r\nState to suggest that at least one reason for the recall was that\r\nMontagu must be anxious to return, but that certainly could not have\r\ndeceived the Ambassador who was, indeed, so little anxious to get home\r\nthat he remained at Constantinople until the following June. Likewise,\r\nthe statement that he would be able to promote the King's service in\r\nParliament, flattering as it read, meant, of course, nothing at all.\r\nCertainly, though Montagu sat in the House of Commons until his death,\r\noffice was never offered him in any Administration.\r\n\r\nLady Mary found herself again with child. Whether this pleased her or\r\nnot no one can say, but in a letter to Mrs. Thistlethwayte she treated\r\nthe incident divertingly enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could return your goodness with some diverting accounts from\r\nhence. But I know not what part of the scenes here would gratify your\r\ncuriosity, or whether you have any curiosity at all for things so far\r\ndistant. To say the truth, I am, at this present writing, not very much\r\nturned for the recollection of what is diverting, my head being wholly\r\nfilled with the preparations necessary for the increase of my family,\r\nwhich I expect every day. You may easily guess at my uneasy situation.\r\nBut I am, however, in some degree comforted, by the glory that accrues\r\nto me from it, and a reflection on the contempt I should otherwise fall\r\nunder. You won't know what to make of this speech: but, in this country,\r\nit is more despicable to be married and not fruitful, than it is with us\r\nto be fruitful before marriage. They have a notion, that, whenever a\r\nwoman leaves off bringing children, it is because she is too old for\r\nthat business, whatever her face says to the contrary, and this opinion\r\nmakes the ladies here so ready to make proofs of their youth (which is\r\nas necessary, in order to be a received beauty, as it is to shew the\r\nproofs of nobility, to be admitted knight of Malta), that they do not\r\ncontent themselves with using the natural means, but fly to all sorts of\r\nquackeries, to avoid the scandal of being past child-bearing, and often\r\nkill themselves by them. Without any exaggeration, all the women of my\r\nacquaintance that have been married ten years, have twelve or thirteen\r\nchildren; and the old ones boast of having had five-and-twenty or thirty\r\na-piece, and are respected according to the number they have produced.\r\nWhen they are with child, it is their common expression to say, They\r\nhope God will be so merciful to them to send two this time; and when I\r\nhave asked them sometimes, How they expected to provide for such a flock\r\nas they desire? they answered, That the plague will certainly kill half\r\nof them; which, indeed, generally happens, without much concern to the\r\nparents, who are satisfied with the vanity of having brought forth so\r\nplentifully.\r\n\r\n\"The French Ambassadress is forced to comply with this fashion as well\r\nas myself. She has not been here much above a year, and has lain in\r\nonce, and is big again. What is most wonderful is, the exemption they\r\nseem to enjoy from the curse entailed on the sex. They see all company\r\nthe day of their delivery, and, at the fortnight's end, return visits,\r\nset out in their jewels and new clothes. I wish I may find the influence\r\nof the climate in this particular. But I fear I shall continue an\r\nEnglishwoman in that affair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary gave birth to a daughter, Mary, in February. \"I don't mention\r\nthis as one of my diverting adventures,\" she wrote to Lady Mar, \"though\r\nI must own that it is not half so mortifying here as in England, there\r\nbeing as much difference as there is between a little cold in the head,\r\nwhich sometimes happens here, and the consumptive cough, so common in\r\nLondon. Nobody keeps their house a month for lying in; and I am not so\r\nfond of any of our customs to retain them when they are not necessary. I\r\nreturned my visits at three weeks' end.\"\r\n\r\nSo soon as possible after this domestic event, preparations for the\r\nreturn journey were made. The party went by sea to Tunis, thence to\r\nGenoa, Turin, Lyons, and Paris. Their arrival at Paris in October was\r\nnotified by Lady Mar to her husband: \"You'll be surprised to hear 657\r\n[i.e., Lady Mary] is here. She arrived the day after me. You may believe\r\nhow much incognito I am. 'Twas in vain to attempt being so. Twould fill\r\na whole letter to tell you the people that have been to see me. I was\r\nvery much pleased at seeing 657 and she appeared to be the same.\" The\r\nsisters had not met for three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA SCANDAL\r\n\r\nMontagu re-enters the House of Commons--His miserliness--Pope refers to\r\nit--Comments on Society--Lady Mary and a first-class scandal--Rémond--\r\nHis admiration for her--Her imprudent letters to him--The South Sea\r\nBubble--Lady Mary speculates for Rémond--She loses money for him--He\r\ndemands to be re-imbursed--He threatens to publish her letters--She\r\nstates the case in letters to Lady Mar--Lady Mary meets Pope--His letters\r\nto her when she was abroad--He affects to be in love with her--Her\r\nmatter-of-fact replies--Her parody of his verses, \"On John Hughes and\r\nSarah Drew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMontagu, on his return to England, again entered the House of Commons,\r\nwhere he represented Huntingdon from 1722 to 1734, and then for\r\nPeterborough from 1734 to 1747 and from 1754 to 1761. Whether it was\r\nlack of ambition or just want of appreciation of his talents by the\r\nleaders of his party, there is no evidence. Even with his family\r\nconnections and his wealth, he was never offered a place in any\r\nAdministration, nor, it must be confessed, did he in any way distinguish\r\nhimself in Parliament. As the years passed, his chief pleasure, if\r\nindeed it was not his only one, was in the hoarding of money--in this\r\npursuit he was splendidly successful. From references to Lady Mary in\r\ncontemporary correspondence, it would appear that she too had no small\r\nstreak of the miser in her. Pope, after his quarrel with her, referred\r\nto Montagu as \"Worldly,\" \"Shylock,\" and \"Gripus,\" and in the fourth\r\nEpistle of the _Essay on Man_ wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"Is yellow dirt the passion of thy life?\r\n   Look but on Gripus and Gripus' wife.\"\r\n\r\nAlso he lampooned them under the style of Avidieu and Avidieu's wife,\r\nwho\r\n\r\n  \"Sell their presented partridges or fruits,\r\n   And humbly live on rabbits and on roots;\r\n   One half-pint bottle serves them both to dine,\r\n   And is at once their vinegar and wine.\r\n   But on some lucky day (as when they found\r\n   A lost bank note, or heard their son was drowned),\r\n   At such a feast old vinegar to spare\r\n   Is what two souls so generous cannot bear:\r\n   Oil, though it stink, they drop by drop impart,\r\n   But souse the cabbage with a bounteous heart.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary took her place, as of right, as a leader of society, and for a\r\nwhile plunged into the gaieties of the town. \"Public places flourish\r\nmore than ever,\" she wrote to her sister. \"We have assemblies for every\r\nday in the week, besides Court, operas, and masquerades. With youth and\r\nmoney, 'tis certainly possible to be well diverted in spite of malice\r\nand ill-nature, though they are more and more powerful every day. For my\r\npart, as it is my established opinion that this globe of ours is no\r\nbetter than a Holland cheese, and the walkers about in it mites, I\r\npossess my soul in patience, let what will happen--and I should feel\r\ntolerably easy, though a great rat came and ate half of it.\" That is a\r\nphilosophical outlook with a vengeance!\r\n\r\nHowever, Lady Mary managed on the whole to enjoy herself. \"The town\r\nimproves in gaiety every day; the young people are younger than they\r\nused to be, and all the old are grown young. Nothing is talked of but\r\nentertainments of gallantry by land and water, and we insensibly begin\r\nto taste all the joys of arbitrary power. Politics are no more; nobody\r\npretends to wince or kick under their burdens; but we go on cheerfully\r\nwith our bells at our ears, ornamented with ribands, and highly\r\ncontented with our present condition; so much for the general state of\r\nthe nation,\" she made her comment on polite circles. \"We are much\r\nmistaken here as to our ideas of Paris--to hear gallantry has deserted\r\nit, sounds as extraordinary to me as a want of ice in Greenland.\r\nWe have nothing but ugly faces in this country, but more lovers than\r\never. There are but three pretty men in England, and they are all in\r\nlove with me, at this present writing. This will amaze you extremely;\r\nbut if you were to see the reigning girls at present, I will assure you,\r\nthere is very little difference between them and old women.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary could never resist a good story, and, indeed, never made any\r\nattempt to do so, and she usually wrote them down to amuse Lady Mar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Tis but reasonable I should conclude with a farce, that I may not\r\nleave you in ill humour. I have so good an opinion of your taste, to\r\nbelieve Harlequin in person will never make you laugh so much as the\r\nEarl of Stair's furious passion for Lady Walpole (aged fourteen and some\r\nmonths). Mrs. Murray undertook to bring the business to bear, and\r\nprovided the opportunity (a great ingredient you'll say); but the young\r\nlady proved skittish. She did not only turn this heroic flame into\r\npresent ridicule, but exposed all his generous sentiments, to divert her\r\nhusband and father-in-law. His lordship is gone to Scotland; and if\r\nthere was anybody wicked enough to write about it, there is a subject\r\nworthy the pen of the best ballad-maker in Grub-street.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Lord Townshend has renewed his lease of life by his French journey, and\r\nis at present situated in his house in Grosvenor-street in perfect\r\nhealth. My good lady is coming from the Bath to meet him with the joy\r\nyou may imagine. Kitty Edwin has been the companion of his [her?]\r\npleasures there. The alliance seems firmer than ever between them, after\r\ntheir Tunbridge battles, which served for the entertainment of the\r\npublic. The secret cause is variously guessed at; but it is certain Lady\r\nTownshend came into the great room gently behind her friend, and tapping\r\nher on the shoulder with her fan, said aloud, _I know where, how, and\r\nwho_. These mysterious words drew the attention of all the company,\r\nand had such an effect upon poor Kitty, she was carried to her lodgings\r\nin strong hysterics. However, by the intercession of prudent mediators\r\npeace was concluded; and if the conduct of these heroines was considered\r\nin a true light, perhaps it might serve for an example even to higher\r\npowers, by showing that the surest method to obtain a lasting and\r\nhonourable peace, is to begin with vigorous war. But leaving these\r\nreflections, which are above my capacity, permit me to repeat my desire\r\nof hearing often from you. Your letters would be my greatest pleasure if\r\nI had flourished in the first years of Henry the Eighth's court; judge\r\nthen how welcome they are to me in the present desolate state of this\r\ndeserted town of London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary's own morals were more than once assailed; but this did not\r\nprevent her humorous attack on society at large: \"Those things [Bills of\r\nDivorce] grow more fashionable every day, and in a little time won't be\r\nat all scandalous. The best expedient for the public, and to prevent the\r\nexpense of private families, would be a general act of divorcing all the\r\npeople of England. You know those that pleased might marry again; and it\r\nwould save the reputation of several ladies that are now in peril of\r\nbeing exposed every day.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after Lady Mary had returned to England, about the winter of\r\n1720, she, who loved to retail malicious stories about others, found\r\nherself, to her great dismay, the subject of a first-class scandal.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Mary was in Paris, Rémond was introduced to her by the Abbé\r\nConti. He had seen a letter or two addressed by her to the Abbé, and\r\nexpressed himself with enthusiasm of her brilliance as a correspondent.\r\nPresently he came to England, and sought out Lady Mary, who was no more\r\nimmune from flattery than most folk of either sex. How far the intimacy\r\ndeveloped from the platonic to the amorous it is impossible to say. That\r\nRémond made love to her there can be little doubt. Sir Leslie Stephen\r\nholds the view that she did not encourage his passion. Anyhow, it is\r\nbeyond question that she wrote him imprudent letters, which he was\r\nprudent enough to keep.\r\n\r\nLady Mary basked in the admiration of Rémond, and thought to reward him\r\nfor his intelligence, at no cost to herself, by putting him on to \"a\r\ngood thing.\" Also, getting a little fearsome of his very marked\r\nattentions, or perhaps it was only wearying of them, she thought, as she\r\nconfessed to her sister, the Countess of Mar, it would be the more easy\r\nto rid herself of this somewhat turbulent lover.\r\n\r\nAt this time the famous \"boom\" known as the South Sea Bubble was at the\r\nheight of its brief career. The South Sea Company had taken over the\r\nNational Debt, on terms, and its stock, carefully manipulated, rose by\r\nleaps and bounds. In 1714 the stock stood at 85. After the defeat of the\r\nrebellion of 1715, it was quoted at prices varying from par to 106. In\r\nthe autumn of 1719, when rumours of its great scheme were spread about\r\nthe town, it rose to 126. Early in the following year it could not be\r\npurchased for less than 400. It fluctuated wildly, going up and down\r\nhundreds of points. On June 2, 1720, it went up in the morning to 890,\r\nin the afternoon fell to 640; and many who were speculating in\r\ndifferences were utterly ruined. Later in the day it recovered, though\r\nonly to 770. Ultimately it rose to 1,000. Of course the prices were\r\nfictitious, but everyone in society tried their luck, and while some\r\ncame out of it with a fortune, the majority lost practically every penny\r\nthey had. The directors, most of whom were guilty of fraud, made vast\r\nsums of money. That astute financier, Robert Walpole, speculated on a\r\nvast scale, sold out before the slump, and realised a fortune more than\r\nsufficient to enable him to rebuild Houghton and to gather together his\r\nfamous collection of pictures. On the other hand the Duke of Portland,\r\nwho held on too long, was so hard hit that he had to solicit the post of\r\nCaptain-General of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nRémond held some South Sea stock, and, acting on Lady Mary's advice,\r\nsold out at a considerable profit. Not content with his gains, however,\r\nhe insisted, just before his departure for France, on leaving in Lady\r\nMary's hands £900 for investment as opportunity should arise.\r\nReluctantly Lady Mary consented--she would probably have agreed almost\r\nto anything, so anxious was she that Rémond should leave the country.\r\n\r\nOn August 22, 1720, Pope, with the best intentions in the world, wrote\r\nto Lady Mary: \"I was made acquainted last night that I might depend upon\r\nit as a certain gain to buy the South Sea stock at the present price,\r\nwhich will assuredly rise in some weeks or less. I can be as sure of\r\nthis as the nature of any such thing will allow, from the first and best\r\nhands, and therefore have despatched the bearer with all speed to you.\"\r\nNo doubt the phrase \"the first and best hands,\" was intended to convey\r\nthe fact that his informant was his friend and neighbour, James Craggs\r\nthe younger, the Secretary of State who was so deeply involved in the\r\naffairs of the South Sea Company that when the \"bubble\" burst he only\r\nescaped prosecution by conveniently dying of small-pox. Acting on the\r\nhint given by Pope, Lady Mary purchased stock for herself and Rémond.\r\nThe stock fell rapidly--in August it stood at 750 and in December at\r\n130. What she lost is not known, but she had been sufficiently involved\r\nto make her desire to sell her diamonds, and more than once she asked\r\nLady Mar if there was a market for the jewels in Paris. Rémond's £900\r\nhad dwindled to £400. On receiving these distressful tidings, the\r\nFrenchman believed, or affected to believe, that he had been swindled,\r\nand he threatened, unless he were repaid in full, he would publish Lady\r\nMary's letters to him. Lady Mary's fear was lest the matter should come\r\nto the cognisance of her husband: it would certainly be unfair to\r\nMontagu to suggest that he might not have forgiven his wife for a\r\nlove-affair; but he would certainly never have pardoned her any\r\ntransaction that cost him money.\r\n\r\nMany malicious things were said about this business. Walpole gave a\r\nversion utterly discreditable to Lady Mary, and Pope, after the quarrel,\r\nreferred to the matter in the second book of the _Dunciad_:\r\n\r\n  \"Whence hapless Monsieur much complains at Paris\r\n   Of wrongs from Duchesses and Lady Maries.\"\r\n\r\nThe case was put by Lady Mary in a series of letters to her sister, Lady\r\nMar, to whom she could unburden herself freely, and who might be able to\r\ninfluence Rémond, who was then at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1721.]\r\n\r\n\"From the tranquil and easy situation in which you left me, dear sister,\r\nI am reduced to that of the highest degree of vexation, which I need not\r\nset out to you better than by the plain matter of fact, which I heartily\r\nwish I had told you long since; and nothing hindered me but a certain\r\n_mauvaise honte_ which you are reasonable enough to forgive, as very\r\nnatural, though not very excusable where there is nothing to be ashamed\r\nof; since I can only accuse myself of too much good-nature, or at worst\r\ntoo much credulity, though I believe there never was more pains taken to\r\ndeceive any body. In short, a person whose name is not necessary,\r\nbecause you know it, took all sorts of methods, during almost two years\r\n[_sic_], to persuade me that there never was so extraordinary an\r\nattachment (or what you please to call it) as they had for me. This\r\nended in coming over to make me a visit against my will, and, as was\r\npretended, very much against their interest. I cannot deny I was very\r\nsilly in giving the least credit to this stuff. But if people are so\r\nsilly, you'll own 'tis natural for any body that is good-natured to pity\r\nand be glad to serve a person they believe unhappy upon their account.\r\nIt came into my head, out of a high point of generosity (for which I\r\nwish myself hanged), to do this creature all the good I possibly could,\r\nsince 'twas impossible to make them happy their own way. I advised him\r\nvery strenuously to sell out of the subscription, and in compliance to\r\nmy advice he did so; and in less than two days saw he had done very\r\nprudently. After a piece of service of this nature, I thought I could\r\nmore decently press his departure, which his follies made me think\r\nnecessary for me. He took leave of me with so many tears and grimaces\r\n(which I can't imagine how he could counterfeit) as really moved my\r\ncompassion; and I had much ado to keep to my first resolution of\r\nexacting his absence, which he swore would be his death. I told him that\r\nthere was no other way in the world I would not be glad to serve him in,\r\nbut that his extravagances made it utterly impossible for me to keep him\r\ncompany. He said that he would put into my hands the money that I had\r\nwon for him, and desired me to improve it, saying that if he had enough\r\nto buy a small estate, and retire from the world, 'twas all the\r\nhappiness he hoped for in it. I represented to him that if he had so\r\nlittle money as he said, 'twas ridiculous to hazard at all. He replied\r\nthat 'twas too little to be of any value, and he would either have it\r\ndouble or quit. After many objections on my side and replies on his, I\r\nwas so weak to be overcome by his entreaties, and flattered myself also\r\nthat I was doing a very heroic action, in trying to make a man's fortune\r\nthough I did not care for his addresses. He left me with these\r\nimaginations, and my first care was to employ his money to the best\r\nadvantage. I laid it all out in stock, the general discourse and private\r\nintelligence then scattered about being of a great rise. You may\r\nremember it was two or three days before the fourth subscription, and\r\nyou were with me when I paid away the money to Mr. Binfield. I thought I\r\nhad managed prodigious well in selling out the said stock the day after\r\nthe shutting the books (for a small profit) to Cox and Cleeve,\r\ngoldsmiths of very good reputation. When the opening of the books came,\r\nmy men went off, leaving the stock upon my hands, which was already sunk\r\nfrom near nine hundred pounds to four hundred pounds. I immediately writ\r\nhim word of this misfortune, with the sincere sorrow natural to have\r\nupon such an occasion, and asked his opinion as to the selling the stock\r\nremaining in. He made me no answer to this part of my letter, but a long\r\neloquent oration of miseries of another nature. I attributed this\r\nsilence to his disinterested neglect of his money; but, however,\r\nresolved to make no more steps in his business without direct orders,\r\nafter having been so unlucky. This occasioned many letters to no\r\npurpose; but the very post after you left London, I received a letter\r\nfrom him, in which he told me that he had discovered all my tricks; that\r\nhe was convinced I had all his money remaining untouched: and he would\r\nhave it again, or he would print all my letters to him; which though,\r\nGod knows, very innocent in the main, yet may admit of ill\r\nconstructions, besides the monstrousness of being exposed in such a\r\nmanner. I hear from other people that he is liar enough to publish that\r\nI have borrowed the money of him; though I have a note under his hand,\r\nby which he desires me to employ it in the funds, and acquits me of\r\nbeing answerable for the losses that may happen. At the same time, I\r\nhave attestations and witnesses of the bargains I made, so that nothing\r\ncan be clearer than my integrity in this business; but that does not\r\nhinder me from being in the utmost terror for the consequences (as you\r\nmay easily guess) of his villany; the very story of which appears so\r\nmonstrous to me, I can hardly believe myself while I write it; though I\r\nomit (not to tire you) a thousand aggravating circumstances. I cannot\r\nforgive myself the folly of ever regarding one word he said; and I see\r\nnow that his lies have made me wrong several of my acquaintances, and\r\nyou among the rest, for having said (as he told me) horrid things\r\nagainst me to him. 'Tis long since that your behaviour has acquitted you\r\nin my opinion; but I thought I ought not to mention, to hurt him with\r\nyou, what was perhaps more misunderstanding, or mistake, than a designed\r\nlie. But he has very amply explained his character to me. What is very\r\npleasant is, that, but two posts before, I received a letter from him\r\nfull of higher flights than ever. I beg your pardon (dear sister) for\r\nthis tedious account; but you see how necessary 'tis for me to get my\r\nletters from this madman. Perhaps the best way is by fair means; at\r\nleast, they ought to be first tried. I would have you, then (my dear\r\nsister), try to make the wretch sensible of the truth of what I advance,\r\nwithout asking for the letters, which I have already asked for. Perhaps\r\nyou may make him ashamed of his infamous proceedings by talking of me,\r\nwithout taking notice that you know of his threats, only of my dealings.\r\nI take this method to be the most likely to work upon him. I beg you\r\nwould send me a full and true account of this detestable affair\r\n(enclosed to Mrs. Murray). If I had not been the most unlucky creature\r\nin the world, his letter would have come while you were here, that I\r\nmight have shewed you both his note and the other people's. I knew he\r\nwas discontented, but was far from imagining a possibility of this\r\nthing. I give you a great deal of trouble, but you see I shall owe you\r\nthe highest obligation if you can serve me: the very endeavouring of it\r\nis a tie upon me to serve you the rest of my life without reserve and\r\nwith eternal gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Twickenham, 1721.]\r\n\r\n\"I am now at Twickenham: 'tis impossible to tell you, dear sister, what\r\nagonies I suffer every post-day; my health really suffers so much from\r\nmy fears, that I have reason to apprehend the worst consequences. If\r\nthat monster acted on the least principles of reason, I should have\r\nnothing to fear, since 'tis certain that after he has exposed me he will\r\nget nothing by it. Mr. Wortley can do nothing for his satisfaction I am\r\nnot willing to do myself. I desire not the least indulgence of any kind.\r\nLet him put his affair into the hands of any lawyer whatever. I am\r\nwilling to submit to any examination; 'tis impossible to make a fairer\r\noffer than this is: whoever he employs may come to me hither on several\r\npretences. I desire nothing from him, but that he would send no letters\r\nnor messages to my house at London, where Mr. Wortley now is. I am come\r\nhither in hopes of benefit from the air, but I carry my distemper about\r\nme in an anguish of mind that visibly decays my body every day. I am too\r\nmelancholy to talk of any other subject. Let me beg you (dear sister) to\r\ntake some care of this affair, and think you have it in your power to do\r\nmore than save the life of a sister that loves you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Twickenham, 1721.]\r\n\r\n\"I give you many thanks (my dear sister) for the trouble you have given\r\nyourself in my affair; but am afraid 'tis not yet effectual. I must beg\r\nyou to let him know I am now at Twickenham, and that whoever has his\r\nprocuration may come here on divers pretences, but must by no means go\r\nto my house at London. I wonder you can think Lady Stafford has not writ\r\nto him; she shewed me a long plain letter to him several months ago; as\r\na demonstration he received it, I saw his answer. 'Tis true she treated\r\nhim with the contempt he deserved, and told him she would never give\r\nherself the trouble of writing again to so despicable a wretch. She is\r\nwilling to do yet further, and write to the Duke of Villeroi about it,\r\nif I think it proper. Rémond does nothing but lie, and either does not,\r\nor will not, understand what is said to him. You will forgive me\r\ntroubling you so often with this business; the importance of it is the\r\nbest excuse; in short,\r\n\r\n  '--'tis joy or sorrow, peace or strife.\r\n   'Tis all the colour of remaining life.'\r\n\r\nI can foresee nothing else to make me unhappy, and, I believe, shall\r\ntake care another time not to involve myself in difficulties by an\r\noverplus of heroic generosity.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear sister, ever yours, with the utmost esteem and affection. If\r\nI get over this cursed affair, my style may enliven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[June, 1721.]\r\n\r\n\"I have just received your letter of May 30th, and am surprised, since\r\nyou own the receipt of my letter, that you give me not the least hint\r\nconcerning the business that I writ so earnestly to you about. Till that\r\nis over, I am as little capable of hearing or repeating news, as I\r\nshould be if my house was on fire. I am sure, a great deal must be in\r\nyour power; the hurting of me can be in no way his interest. I am ready\r\nto assign, or deliver the money for £500 stock, to whoever he will name,\r\nif he will send my letters into Lady Stafford's hands; which, were he\r\nsincere in his offer of burning them, he would readily do. Instead of\r\nthat, he has writ a letter to Mr. W. [Wortley] to inform him of the\r\nwhole affair: luckily for me, the person he has sent it to assures me it\r\nshall never be delivered; but I am not the less obliged to his good\r\nintentions. For God's sake, do something to set my mind at ease from\r\nthis business, and then I will not fail to write you regular accounts of\r\nall your acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[July (?), 1721.]\r\n\r\n\"I cannot enough thank you, dear sister, for the trouble you give\r\nyourself in my affairs, though I am still so unhappy to find your care\r\nvery ineffectual. I have actually in my present possession a formal\r\nletter directed to Mr. Wortley to acquaint him with the whole business.\r\nYou may imagine the inevitable eternal misfortunes it would have thrown\r\nme into, had it been delivered by the person to whom it was intrusted. I\r\nwish you would make him sensible of the infamy of this proceeding, which\r\ncan no way in the world turn to his advantage. Did I refuse giving the\r\nstrictest account, or had I not the clearest demonstration in my hands\r\nof the truth and sincerity with which I acted, there might be some\r\ntemptation to this baseness; but all he can expect by informing Mr.\r\nWortley is to hear him repeat the same things I assert; he will not\r\nretrieve one farthing, and I am for ever miserable. I beg no more of him\r\nthan to direct any person, man or woman, either lawyer, broker, or a\r\nperson of quality, to examine me; and as soon as he has sent a proper\r\nauthority to discharge me on enquiry, I am ready to be examined. I think\r\nno offer can be fairer from any person whatsoever; his conduct towards\r\nme is so infamous, that I am informed I might prosecute him by law if he\r\nwas here; he demanding the whole sum as a debt from Mr. Wortley, at the\r\nsame time I have a note under his hand signed to prove the contrary. I\r\nbeg with the utmost earnestness that you would make him sensible of his\r\nerror. I believe 'tis very necessary to say something to fright him. I\r\nam persuaded, if he was talked to in a style of that kind, he would not\r\ndare to attempt to ruin me. I have a great inclination to write\r\nseriously to your lord about it, since I desire to determine this affair\r\nin the fairest and the clearest manner. I am not at all afraid of making\r\nany body acquainted with it; and if I did not fear making Mr. Wortley\r\nuneasy (who is the only person from whom I would conceal it), all the\r\ntransactions should have been long since enrolled in Chancery. I have\r\nalready taken care to have the broker's depositions taken before a\r\nlawyer of reputation and merit. I deny giving him no satisfaction; and\r\nafter that offer, I think there is no man of honour that would refuse\r\nsignifying to him that as 'tis all he can desire, so, if he persists in\r\ndoing me an injury, he may repent it. You know how far 'tis proper to\r\ntake this method, I say nothing of the uneasiness I am under, 'tis far\r\nbeyond any expression; my obligation would be proportionable to any body\r\nthat would deliver me from it, and I should not think it paid by all the\r\nservices of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Twickenham, June (?), 1721.]\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sister,\r\n\r\n\"Having this occasion, I would not omit writing, though I have received\r\nno answer to my two last. The bearer is well acquainted with my affair,\r\nthough not from me, till he mentioned it to me first, having heard it\r\nfrom those to whom Rémond had told it with all the false colours he\r\npleased to lay on. I shewed him the formal commission I had to employ\r\nthe money, and all the broker's testimonies taken before Delpeeke, with\r\nhis certificate. Your remonstrances have hitherto had so little effect,\r\nthat R. [Rémond] will neither send a letter of attorney to examine my\r\naccounts, or let me be in peace. I received a letter from him but two\r\nposts since, in which he renews his threats except I send him the whole\r\nsum, which is as much in my power as it is to send a million. I can\r\neasily comprehend that he may be ashamed to send a procuration, which\r\nmust convince the world of all the lies he has told. For my part, I am\r\nso willing to be rid of the plague of hearing from him, I desire no\r\nbetter than to restore him with all expedition the money I have in my\r\nhands; but I will not do it without a general acquittance in due form,\r\nnot to have fresh demands every time he wants money. If he thinks that\r\nhe has a larger sum to receive than I offer, why does he not name a\r\nprocurator to examine me? If he is content with that sum, I only insist\r\non the acquittance for my own safety. I am ready to send it to him, with\r\nfull license to tell as many lies as he pleases afterwards. I am weary\r\nwith troubling you with repetitions which cannot be more disagreeable to\r\nyou than they are to me. I have had, and still have, so much vexation\r\nwith this execrable affair, 'tis impossible to describe it. I had rather\r\ntalk to you of any thing else, but it fills my whole head.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was no coward, but when she heard that Rémond intended to come\r\nto London in connection with this business, she was at first in despair\r\nHowever, she summoned her courage to aid, and asked Lady Mar to tell him\r\nthat if he was spoiling for a fight she would do her best to indulge him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I send you, dear sister, by Lady Lansdowne this letter, accompanied\r\nwith the only present that was ever sent me by that monster. I beg you\r\nto return it immediately. I am told he is preparing to come to London.\r\nLet him know that 'tis not at all necessary for receiving his money or\r\nexamining my accounts; he has nothing to do but to send a letter of\r\nattorney to whom he pleases (without exception), and I will readily\r\ndeliver up what I have in my hands, and his presence will not obtain one\r\nfarthing more: his design then can only be to expose my letters here. I\r\ndesire you would assure him that my first step shall be to acquaint my\r\nLord Stair[4] with all his obligations to him, as soon as I hear he is\r\nin London; and if he dares to give me further trouble, I shall take care\r\nto have him rewarded in a stronger manner than he expects; there is\r\nnothing more true than this; and I solemnly swear, that if all the\r\ncredit or money that I have in the world can do it, either for\r\nfriendship or hire, I shall not fail to have him used as he deserves;\r\nand since I know this journey can only be designed to expose me, I shall\r\nnot value what noise is made. Perhaps you may prevent it; I leave you to\r\njudge of the most proper method; 'tis certain no time should be lost;\r\nfear is his predominant passion, and I believe you may fright him from\r\ncoming hither, where he will certainly find a reception very\r\ndisagreeable to him.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: John Dalrymple, second Earl of Stair (1673-1747), British\r\nAmbassador at Paris, 1715-1720.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"September 6, 1721.\r\n\r\n\"I have consulted my lawyer, and he says I cannot, with safety to\r\nmyself, deposit the money I have received into other hands, without the\r\nexpress order of Rémond; and he is so unreasonable, that he will neither\r\nsend a procuration to examine my accounts, or any order for me to\r\ntransfer his stock into another name. I am heartily weary of the trust,\r\nwhich has given me so much trouble, and can never think myself safe till\r\nI am quite got rid of it: rather than be plagued any longer with the\r\nodious keeping, I am willing to abandon my letters to his discretion. I\r\ndesire nothing more of him than an order to place his money in other\r\nhands, which methinks should not be so hard to obtain, since he is so\r\ndissatisfied with my management; but he seems to be bent to torment me,\r\nand will not even touch his money, because I beg it of him. I wish you\r\nwould represent these things to him; for my own part, I live in so much\r\nuneasiness about it, that I sometimes weary of life itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[October (?) 1721.]\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forbear (dear sister) accusing you of unkindness that you take\r\nso little care of a business of the last consequence to me. R. [Rémond]\r\nwrit to me some time ago, to say if I would immediately send him £2,000\r\nsterling, he would send me an acquittance. As this was sending him\r\nseveral hundreds out of my own pocket, I absolutely refused it; and, in\r\nreturn, I have just received a threatening letter, to print I know not\r\nwhat stuff against me. I am too well acquainted with the world (of which\r\npoor Mrs. Murray's affair is a fatal instance), not to know that the\r\nmost groundless accusation is always of ill consequence to a woman;\r\nbesides the cruel misfortune it may bring upon me in my own family. If\r\nyou have any compassion either for me or my innocent children, I am sure\r\nyou will try to prevent it. The thing is too serious to be delayed. I\r\nthink (to say nothing either of blood or affection), that humanity and\r\nChristianity are interested in my preservation. I am sure I can answer\r\nfor my hearty gratitude and everlasting acknowledgment of a service much\r\nmore important than that of saving my life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Lady Mary's correspondence there is no further reference to this\r\nsorry business, and so it cannot be said how it ended. Nor can it be\r\ndecided whether Rémond really believed he had been swindled or whether\r\nhe was just a blackmailer.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy between Lady Mary and Pope is especially interesting\r\nbecause it culminated in one of the most famous quarrels in the literary\r\nannals of this country, and second only to that between Pope and\r\nAddison.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Mary went abroad in 1716 Pope, who always wanted to make the\r\nbest of both worlds, thought, it has been related by his biographers, of\r\nwhat dramatic situation describing the separation of lovers would best\r\nsuit him to express his feelings, and he found exactly what he wanted on\r\nthe supposed authentic letters of Eloisa to Abelard. Pope sent Lady Mary\r\na volume of his poems, saying: \"Among the rest you have all I am worth,\r\nthat is, my works. There are few things in them but what you have\r\nalready seen, except the 'Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard,' in which you\r\nwill find one passage that I cannot tell whether to wish you should\r\nunderstand or not.\"\r\n\r\nPope corresponded with Lady Mary during the two years of her stay\r\nabroad. The first letter from Pope begins:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So natural as I find it is to me to neglect every body else in your\r\ncompany, I am sensible I ought to do anything that might please you, and\r\nI fancied upon recollection, our writing the letter you proposed was of\r\nthat nature. I therefore sate down to my part of it last night, when I\r\nshould have gone out of town. Whether or no you will order me, in\r\nrecompense, to see you again, I leave to you, for indeed I find I begin\r\nto behave myself worse to you than to any other woman, as I value you\r\nmore, and yet if I thought I should not see you again, I would say some\r\nthings here, which I could not to your person. For I would not have you\r\ndie deceived in me, that is, go to Constantinople without knowing that I\r\nam to some degree of extravagance, as well as with the utmost reason,\r\nmadam, your, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome passages from Pope's subsequent letters must be given to indicate\r\nthe lines on which this correspondence was conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You may easily imagine how desirous I must be of correspondence with a\r\nperson who had taught me long ago, that it was as possible to esteem at\r\nfirst sight, as to love; and who has since ruined me for all the\r\nconversation of one sex and almost all the friendship of the other. I am\r\nbut too sensible, through your means, that the company of men, wants a\r\ncertain softness to recommend it, and that of women wants everything\r\nelse. How often have I been quietly going to take possession of that\r\ntranquility and indolence I had so long found in the country, when one\r\nevening of your conversation has spoiled me for a solitaire too! Books\r\nhave lost their effect upon me, and I was convinced since I saw you,\r\nthat there is something more powerful than philosophy, and since I heard\r\nyou, that there is one alive wiser than all the sages. A plague of\r\nfemale wisdom! it makes a man ten times more uneasy than his own. What\r\nis very strange, Virtue herself, when you have the dressing of her, is\r\ntoo amiable for one's repose. What a world of good might you have done\r\nin your time, if you had allowed half the fine gentlemen who have seen\r\nyou to have but conversed with you! They would have been strangely\r\ncaught, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair face, and\r\nyou had bewitched them with reason and virtue, two beauties that the\r\nvery fops pretend to have an acquaintance with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"August 20, 1716.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\r\n\r\n\"You will find me more troublesome than ever Brutus did his evil genius,\r\nI shall meet you in more places than one, and often refreshen your\r\nmemory before you arrive at your Philippi. These shadows of me (my\r\nletters) will be haunting you from time to time, and putting you in mind\r\nof the man who has really suffered by you, and whom you have robbed of\r\nthe most valuable of his enjoyments, your conversation. The advantage of\r\nlearning your sentiments by discovering mine, was what I always thought\r\na great one, and even with the risk I run of manifesting my own\r\nindiscretion. You then rewarded my trust in you the moment it was given,\r\nfor you pleased and informed me the minute you answered. I must now be\r\ncontented with slow returns. However, it is some pleasure, that your\r\nthoughts upon paper will be a more lasting possession to me, and that I\r\nshall no longer have cause to complain of a loss I have so often\r\nregretted, that of anything you said, which I happened to forget. In\r\nearnest, Madam, if I were to write you as often as I think of you, it\r\nmust be every day of my life. I attend you in spirit through all your\r\nways, I follow in books of travel through every stage, I wish for you,\r\nfear for you through whole folios, you make me shrink at the past\r\ndangers of dead travellers, and when I read an agreeable prospect or\r\ndelightful place, I hope it yet subsists to give you pleasure. I inquire\r\nthe roads, the amusements, the company of every town and country you\r\npass through, with as much diligence, as if I were to set out next week\r\nto overtake you. In a word no one can have you more constantly in mind,\r\nnot even your guardian-angel (if you have one), and I am willing to\r\nindulge so much Popery as to fancy some Being takes care of you who\r\nknows your value better than you do yourself. I am willing to think that\r\nHeaven never gave so much self-neglect and resolution to a woman, to\r\noccasion her calamity, but am pious enough to believe those qualities\r\nmust be intended to her benefit and her glory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPope's letters of this period to Lady Mary were all written in a strain\r\nof adulation, which may well have pleased Lady Mary and must certainly\r\nhave amused her. She can, however, scarcely have been led into any\r\nself-deception as regards the sincerity of her correspondent, in spite\r\nof the fact that in one of the earliest epistles he addressed to her he\r\nsubscribed himself: \"I am, with all unalterable esteem and sincerity,\r\nMadam, your most faithful, obedient, humble servant.\" Yet, no doubt, she\r\nwas pleased enough to read: \"I communicated your letter to Mr. Congreve;\r\nhe thinks of you as he ought, I mean as I do, for one always thinks that\r\nto be just as it ought.... We never meet but we lament over you: we pay\r\na kind of weekly rites to your memory, when we strew flowers of rhetoric\r\nand offer such libations to your name as if it were a profaneness to\r\ncall toasting.\" Well, alcoholic refreshment by any other name is just as\r\npotent. It must have been grateful and comforting to be told when in\r\nexile: \"I must tell you, too, that the Duke of Buckingham has been more\r\nthan once your high priest in performing the office of your praises: and\r\nupon the whole I believe there are few men who do not deplore your\r\ndeparture, as women that sincerely do.\"\r\n\r\nMost excellent Pope, who would play at make-believe. It is almost a pity\r\nthat he could not persuade the lady that he meant even a tithe of what\r\nhe wrote to her. Listen to him again: \"For my part, I hate a great many\r\nwomen for your sake, and undervalue all the rest. 'Tis you who are to\r\nblame, and may God revenge it upon you, with all those blessings and\r\nearthy prosperities which the divines tell us, are the cause of our\r\nperdition: for if He makes you happy in this world, I dare trust your\r\nown virtue to do it in the other.\" These poets!\r\n\r\nLady Mary took all this in the right way, and as love-letters appraised\r\nthem at their true value. \"Perhaps you'll laugh at me for thanking you\r\nvery gravely for all the obliging concern you express for me,\" she wrote\r\nfrom Vienna in September, with, perhaps, just a touch of irony. \"'Tis\r\ncertain that I may, if I please, take the fine things you say to me for\r\nwit and raillery; and it may be, it would be taking them right. But I\r\nnever in my life was half so well disposed to believe you in earnest;\r\nand that distance which makes the continuation of your friendship\r\nimprobable, has very much increased my faith for it, and I find that I\r\nhave (as well as the rest of my sex), whatever face I set on't, a strong\r\ndisposition to believe in miracles.\" As regards the rest, her side of\r\nthe correspondence was matter-of-fact to such a degree that it suggests\r\nthat she adopted that tone in order to lease him. Her replies can\r\nscarcely have given Pope any satisfaction. From Vienna she gave him a\r\ndetailed account of the opera and the theatre; from Belgrade she told\r\nhim of the war and of an Arabic scholar and also of the climate; from\r\nAdrianople she discoursed of the Hebrus, of the lads of the village, of\r\nAddison and Theocritus, pays him compliments on his translation of\r\nHomer, and a copy of some Turkish verses; and so on. The most striking\r\nthing about her letters is the absence of the personal note, which is so\r\noften introduced when she was writing to others. They read more like\r\nessays than communications to a friend.\r\n\r\nPope, in a letter dated September 1, 1718, sent Lady Mary a copy of his\r\nverses.\r\n\r\n  ON JOHN HUGHES AND SARAH DREW\r\n\r\n  When Eastern lovers fear'd the fun'eral fire\r\n  On the same pile the faithful pair expire!\r\n  Here pitying Heav'n that virtue mutual found,\r\n  And blasted both, that it might neither wound.\r\n  Hearts so sincere th' Almighty saw well pleas'd,\r\n  Sent his own lightning and the victims seiz'd.\r\n\r\n  I\r\n  Think not by vig'rous judgment seiz'd,\r\n    A pair so faithful could expire;\r\n  Victims so pure Heav'n saw well pleas'd,\r\n    And snatch'd them in celestial fire.\r\n\r\n  II\r\n  Live well, and fear no sudden fate:\r\n    When God calls virtue to the grave;\r\n  Alike 'tis justice, soon or late,\r\n    Mercy alike to kill or save.\r\n  Virtue unmov'd can hear the call.\r\n  And face the flash that melts the ball.\r\n\r\nThese verses she acknowledged in a letter which, written while on the\r\nhomeward path, she sent from Dover, where she arrived at the beginning\r\nof November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have this minute received a letter of yours, sent me from Paris. I\r\nbelieve and hope I shall very soon see both you and Mr. Congreve; but as\r\nI am here in an inn, where we stay to regulate our march to London, bag\r\nand baggage, I shall employ some of my leisure time in answering that\r\npart of yours that seems to require an answer.\r\n\r\n\"I must applaud your good nature, in supposing that your pastoral lovers\r\n(vulgarly called haymakers) would have lived in everlasting joy and\r\nharmony, if the lightning had not interrupted their scheme of happiness.\r\nI see no reason to imagine that John Hughes and Sarah Drew were either\r\nwiser or more virtuous than their neighbours. That a well-set man of\r\ntwenty five should have a fancy to marry a brown woman of eighteen, is\r\nnothing marvellous; and I cannot help thinking, that, had they married,\r\ntheir lives would have passed in the common track with their fellow\r\nparishioners. His endeavouring to shield her from the storm, was a\r\nnatural action, and what he would have certainly done for his horse, if\r\nhe had been in the same situation. Neither am I of opinion, that their\r\nsudden death was a reward of their mutual virtue. You know the Jews were\r\nreproved for thinking a village destroyed by fire more wicked than those\r\nthat had escaped the thunder. Time and chance happen to all men. Since\r\nyou desire me to try my skill in an epitaph, I think the following lines\r\nperhaps more just, though not so poetical as yours:\r\n\r\n  Here lies John Hughes and Sarah Drew;\r\n  Perhaps you'll say, what's that to you?\r\n  Believe me, friend, much may be said\r\n  On this poor couple that are dead.\r\n  On Sunday next they should have married;\r\n  But see how oddly things are carried!\r\n  On Thursday last it rain'd and lighten'd;\r\n  These tender lovers, sadly frighten'd,\r\n  Shelter'd beneath the cocking hay,\r\n  In hopes to pass the storm away;\r\n  But the bold thunder found them out\r\n  (Commissioned for that end, no doubt),\r\n  And, seizing on their trembling breath,\r\n  Consign'd them to the shades of death.\r\n  Who knows if 'twas not kindly done?\r\n  For had they seen the next year's sun,\r\n  A beaten wife and cuckold swain\r\n  Had jointly curs'd the marriage chain;\r\n  Now they are happy in their doom,\r\n  For P. has wrote upon their tomb.\r\n\r\n\"I confess, these sentiments are not altogether so heroic as yours; but\r\nI hope you will forgive them in favour of the two last lines. You see\r\nhow much I esteem the honour you have done them; though I am not very\r\nimpatient to have the same, and had rather continue to be your stupid\r\nliving humble servant, than be celebrated by all the pens in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"I would write to Mr. Congreve, but suppose you will read this to him,\r\nif he enquires after me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAT TWICKENHAM\r\n\r\nThe Montagus take a house at Twickenham--Lady Mary's liking for country\r\nlife--Neighbours and visitors--Pope--Bononcini, Anastasia Robinson,\r\nSenesino--Lord Peterborough--Sir Geoffrey Kneller--Henrietta\r\nHoward--Lord Bathurst--The Duke of Wharton--His early history--He comes\r\nto Twickenham--His relations with Lady Mary--Horace Walpole's reference\r\nto them--Pope's bitter onslaught on the Duke--An Epilogue by Lady\r\nMary--\"On the death of Mrs. Bowes\"--The Duke quarrels with Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPope went to live at Twickenham in 1718, and it was generally believed\r\nthat it was by his persuasion that the Montagus rented a house in that\r\nlittle riverside hamlet. It was not until 1722 that they bought \"the\r\nsmall habitation.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary divided her time between London and Twickenham, but apparently\r\nenjoyed herself more at her country retreat. \"I live in a sort of\r\nsolitude that wants very little of being such as I would have it,\" she\r\nwrote to her sister, Lady Mar, in August, 1721. As a matter of fact, the\r\nsolitude was more imaginary than real, for round about there was a small\r\ncolony of friends.\r\n\r\nShe was, indeed, very rarely lonely. \"My time is melted away in almost\r\nperpetual concerts,\" she told her sister. \"I do not presume to judge,\r\nbut I'll assure you I am a very hearty as well as an humble admirer. I\r\nhave taken my little thread satin beauty into the house with me; she is\r\nallowed by Bononcini to have the finest voice he ever heard in England.\r\nHe and Mrs. Robinson and Senesino lodge in this village, and sup often\r\nwith me: and this easy indolent life would make me the happiest\r\nin the world, if I had not this execrable affair [of Rémond] still\r\nhanging over my head.\" To Anastasia Robinson there is more than one\r\nallusion in Lady Mary's correspondence, and she gives a most amusing\r\naccount of an incident in that lady's career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Could one believe that Lady Holdernesse is a beauty, and in love? and\r\nthat Mrs. Robinson is at the same time a prude and a kept mistress? and\r\nthese things in spite of nature and fortune. The first of these ladies\r\nis tenderly attached to the polite Mr. Mildmay, and sunk in all the joys\r\nof happy love, notwithstanding she wants the use of her two hands by a\r\nrheumatism, and he has an arm that he cannot move. I wish I could send\r\nyou the particulars of this amour, which seems to me as curious as that\r\nbetween two oysters; and as well worth the serious enquiry of the\r\nnaturalists. The second heroine has engaged half the town in arms, from\r\nthe nicety of her virtue, which was not able to bear the too near\r\napproach of Senesino in the opera; and her condescension in accepting of\r\nLord Peterborough for her champion, who has signalised both his love and\r\ncourage upon this occasion in as many instances as ever Don Quixote did\r\nfor Dulcinea. Poor Senesino, like a vanquished giant, was forced to\r\nconfess upon his knees that Anastasia was a nonpariel of virtue and\r\nbeauty. Lord Stanhope, as dwarf to the said giant, joked of his side,\r\nand was challenged for his pains. Lord Delawar was Lord Peterborough's\r\nsecond; my lady miscarried--the whole town divided into parties on this\r\nimportant point. Innumerable have been the disorders between the two\r\nsexes on so great an account, besides half the house of peers being put\r\nunder arrest. By the providence of Heaven, and the wise cares of his\r\nMajesty, no bloodshed ensued. However, things are now tolerably\r\naccommodated; and the fair lady rides through the town in triumph, in\r\nthe shining berlin of her hero, not to reckon the essential advantage of\r\n£100 a month, which 'tis said he allows her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story is, as a matter of fact, not far removed from the truth. It\r\nomits, however, the fact that Lord Peterborough, then about sixty years\r\nof age, had married Anastasia Robinson in 1722; but the marriage was\r\nsecret, although Lady Oxford was present at the ceremony, and it was not\r\nmade public until thirteen years later, although long before there were\r\nmany who suspected it. He died in the same year that the announcement\r\nwas made. His widow survived him by a score of years.\r\n\r\nSir Godfrey Kneller had a house at Twickenham, and, at the instigation\r\nof Pope, sat to him for her portrait, upon which the following lines\r\n(generally ascribed to Pope) were written:\r\n\r\n  \"The playful smiles around the dimpled mouth.\r\n  That happy air of majesty and truth;\r\n  So would I draw (but oh! 'tis vain to try,\r\n  My narrow genius does the power deny;)\r\n  The equal lustre of the heav'nly mind,\r\n  Where ev'ry grace with every virtue's join'd;\r\n  Learning not vain, and wisdom not severe,\r\n  With greatness easy, and with wit sincere;\r\n  With just description show the work divine,\r\n  And the whole princess in my work should shine.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Howard, afterwards the Countess of Suffolk, was a neighbour from\r\n1723, when the Prince of Wales, whose mistress she was, provided her\r\nwith funds for the purchase of Marble Hill. However, though, of course,\r\nshe and Lady Mary were acquainted, there was at no time any intimacy\r\nbetween them. Lady Mary, in fact, does not appear to have liked\r\nHenrietta Howard. At least she on more than one occasion tittle-tattled\r\nabout her. \"The most surprising news is Lord Bathurst's assiduous court\r\nto their Royal Highnesses, which fills the coffee-houses with profound\r\nspeculations. But I, who smell a rat at a profound distance, do believe\r\nin private that Mrs. Howard and his lordship have a friendship that\r\nborders upon 'the tender.'\r\n\r\n  \"And though in histories, learned ignorance\r\n   Attributes all to cunning or to chance,\r\n   Love in that grave disguise does often smile,\r\n   Knowing the cause was kindness all the while.\"\r\n\r\nSo Lady Mary wrote to Lady Mar in 1724, and shortly after returned to\r\nthe subject in another epistle: \"You may remember I mentioned in my last\r\nsome suspicions of my own in relation to Lord Bathurst, which I really\r\nnever mentioned, for fifty reasons, to anyone whatsoever; but, as there\r\nis never smoke without some fire, there is very rarely fire without some\r\nsmoke. These smothered flames, though admirably covered with whole heaps\r\nof politics laid over them, were at last seen, felt, heard, and\r\nunderstood; and the fair lady given to understand by her commanding\r\nofficer, that if she showed under other colours, she must expect to have\r\nher pay retrenched. Upon which the good Lord was dismissed, and has not\r\nattended the drawing-room since. You know one cannot help laughing, when\r\none sees him next, and I own I long for that pleasurable moment.\"\r\n\r\nTo Twickenham came Philip, Duke of Wharton, and leased a villa, later\r\ncalled The Grove, at the farther end of the hamlet from London. Of all\r\nthe lads of the village there was none for wildness like unto him. Born\r\nin 1698, and therefore nine years younger than Lady Mary, he had at an\r\nearly age made himself conspicuous by unbridled excesses. Soon after the\r\ndeath of his father, Thomas, first Marquess of Wharton, in 1715, his\r\nconduct created so much scandal at home, that his guardians sent him\r\nabroad in the custody of a tutor. To the horror of that unfortunate\r\nperson, his charge enrolled himself as an adherent of the Pretender, and\r\nwent to pay his respects at Avignon. The Duke had talent beyond the\r\nordinary. He could write fairly well, make an excellent speech, and had\r\na keen sense of wit. When he went to Paris, the British Ambassador, Lord\r\nStair, took it upon himself to give this madcap some sound advice. He\r\nextolled the virtues of the late Marquess of Wharton, and, \"I hope,\" he\r\nsaid, \"you will follow so illustrious an example of fidelity to your\r\nPrince and love to your country.\" \"I thank your Excellency for your good\r\ncounsel,\" replied the visitor courteously, \"and as your Excellency had\r\nalso a worthy and discerning father, I hope that you will likewise copy\r\nso bright an example, and tread in all his footsteps,\"--an effective\r\nthough a brutal rejoinder, for the first Lord Stair had betrayed his\r\nSovereign. Young Wharton, on his return, however, showed by his conduct\r\nthat his visit to Avignon had been little more than a prank, for while\r\nhe had accepted a dukedom from the Pretender, he, in 1718, being still a\r\nminor, accepted a dukedom from the British Sovereign--the single\r\ninstance of such a dignity being conferred upon a minor.\r\n\r\nWharton, who did everything in haste, had in his seventeenth year eloped\r\nwith Martha, daughter of Major-General Richard Holmes, and married her\r\nin the Fleet on March 2, 1715. As was only to be expected from a person\r\nso volatile he from the beginning neglected his wife; but, as is put\r\nquaintly in that unreliable work, _Memoirs of a Certain Island adjacent\r\nto the Kingdom of Utopia_, which was concocted by Mrs. Eliza Haywood,\r\n\"after some years of continu'd extravagance, the Duke, either through\r\nthe natural Inconsistency of his Temper, or the Reflection how much he\r\nhad been drawn in by his unworthy Companions to embezel his Estate ...\r\nbegan to think there were Comforts in Retirement; and falling into the\r\nConversation of the sober part of Mankind, more than he had done, was\r\npersuaded by them to take home his Dutchess.... He brought her to his\r\nHouse; but Love had no part in his Resolution. He lived with her indeed\r\nbut she is with him as a Housekeeper, as a Nurse.\" The relations were,\r\nhowever, more intimate than Mrs. Haywood believed, for in March, 1719, a\r\nson was born to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Wharton has brought his Duchess to town, and is fond of her\r\nto distraction; in order to break the hearts of all other women that\r\nhave any claim on him,\" Lady Mary wrote to Lady Mar. \"He has public\r\ndevotions twice a day, and assists at them in person with exemplary\r\ndevotion; and there is nothing pleasanter than the remarks of some pious\r\nladies on the conversion of such a sinner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter from which the above passage is an extract must have been\r\nwritten not later than the early spring of 1720, for after that date\r\nthe Duke and Duchess of Wharton did not again live together. The\r\nimmediate cause of the separation was that Wharton had forbidden his\r\nwife to come to London where small-pox was raging at the time. She,\r\nhowever, whether irked by the dulness of the country, or thinking by her\r\npresence to guard her husband against those temptations to which he was\r\nprone, followed him to the town, where the infant sickened of the\r\nepidemic and died. After one great scene, they never met again.\r\n\r\nThere is mention of the Duke in another letter of Lady Mary to Lady Mar,\r\ndated February, 1724:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In general, gallantry never was in so elevated a figure as it is at\r\npresent. Twenty very pretty fellows (the Duke of Wharton being president\r\nand chief director) have formed themselves into a committee of\r\ngallantry. They call themselves _Schemers_; and meet regularly three\r\ntimes a week, to consult on gallant schemes for the advantage and\r\nadvancement of that branch of happiness.... I consider the duty of a\r\ntrue Englishwoman is to do what honour she can to her native country;\r\nand that it would be a sin against the pious love I bear the land of my\r\nnativity, to confine the renown due to the Schemers within the small\r\nextent of this little island, which ought to be spread wherever men can\r\nsigh, or women wish. 'Tis true they have the envy and curses of the old\r\nand ugly of both sexes, and a general persecution from all old women;\r\nbut this is no more than all reformations must expect in their\r\nbeginning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than one writer has asserted that it was the wit and beauty of Lady\r\nMary that drew him thither. At the time the Duke was twenty-four and the\r\nlady nine years older. Certainly he paid her marked attention, but as he\r\npaid marked attention to all women who had not a hump or a squint--\r\nsometimes, maybe, he even overlooked the squint--it is as impossible to\r\nsay whether he was in love with her as it is to assert that she was in\r\nlove with him. From the little that is known of their intimacy, it would\r\nseem that they were merely good comrades--good comrades of the type that\r\nmight bite or scratch at any moment. Horace Walpole, who was more than\r\nusually malicious where Lady Mary was concerned, could scarcely induce\r\nhimself to allow her any qualities. \"My Lady Stafford,\"[5] he wrote to\r\nGeorge Montagu in 1751, \"used to live at Twickenham when Lady Mary\r\nWortley and the Duke of Wharton lived there; she had more wit than both\r\nof them. What would I give to have had Strawberry Hill twenty years ago!\r\nI think anything but twenty years. Lady Stafford used to say to her\r\nsister, 'Well, child, I have come without my wit to-day'; that is, she\r\nhad not taken her opium, which she was forced to do if she had any\r\nappointment, to be in particular spirits.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Claude Charlotte, Countess of Stafford, wife of Henry, Earl of\r\nStafford, and daughter of Philibert, Count of Grammont, and Elizabeth\r\nHamilton, his wife.]\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole alluded to Lady Mary and the Duke in \"The Parish Register\r\nof Twickenham\":\r\n\r\n  \"Twickenham, where frolic Wharton revelled\r\n   Where Montagu, with locks dishevelled.\r\n   Conflict of dirt and warmth combin'd,\r\n   Invoked--and scandalised the _Nine_.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Pope thought of the Duke he expressed with the utmost vigour:\r\n\r\n  \"Wharton, the scorn and wonder of our days,\r\n   Whose ruling passion was the lust of praise:\r\n   Born with whate'er could win it from the wise,\r\n   Women and fools must like him, or he dies:\r\n   Though wondering senates hung on all he spoke.\r\n   The club must hail him master of the joke.\r\n   Shall parts so various aim at nothing new?\r\n   He'll shine a Tully and a Wilmot too.\r\n   Then turns repentant, and his God adores\r\n   With the same spirit that he drinks and whores;\r\n   Enough, if all around him but admire,\r\n   And now the punk applaud, and now the friar.\r\n   Thus with each gift of nature and of art,\r\n   And wanting nothing but an honest heart;\r\n   Grown all to all; from no one vice exempt,\r\n   And most contemptible, to shun contempt:\r\n   His passion still, to covet general praise,\r\n   His life, to forfeit it a thousand ways;\r\n   A constant bounty which no friend has made;\r\n   An angel tongue, which no man can persuade;\r\n   A fool, with more of wit than half mankind;\r\n   Too rash for thought, for action too refined:\r\n   A tyrant to his wife his heart approves;\r\n   A rebel to the very king he loves;\r\n   He dies, sad outcast of each church and state,\r\n   And, harder still! flagitious, yet not great.\r\n   Ask you why Wharton broke through every rule?\r\n   'Twas all for fear the knaves should call him fool.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke wrote a play on Mary Queen of Scots--of which only four lines\r\nhave been preserved:\r\n\r\n  \"Sure were I free, and Norfolk were a prisoner,\r\n   I'd fly with more impatience to his arms,\r\n   Than the poor Israelite gaz'd on the serpent.\r\n   When life was the reward of every look.\"\r\n\r\nIt is usually stated that this play was written at some time between\r\n1728 and 1730, but it is certain that it was begun at this time--\r\nprobably it was never finished. Perhaps only the scenario was drawn up,\r\nand a few scenes outlined; but that so much at least was done while the\r\nauthor was at Twickenham is proved conclusively by the fact that at this\r\ntime Lady Mary composed for the play an epilogue, designed to be spoken\r\nby Mrs. Oldfield.\r\n\r\n  \"What could luxurious woman wish for more.\r\n   To fix her joys, or to extend her pow'r?\r\n   Their every wish was in this Mary seen.\r\n   Gay, witty, youthful, beauteous, and a queen.\r\n   Vain useless blessings with ill-conduct join'd!\r\n   Light as the air, and fleeting as the wind.\r\n   Whatever poets write, and lovers vow.\r\n   Beauty, what poor omnipotence hast thou?\r\n   Queen Bess had wisdom, council, power and laws;\r\n   How few espous'd a wretched beauty's cause?\r\n   Learn thence, ye fair, more solid charms to prize,\r\n   Contemn the idle flatt'rers of your eyes.\r\n   The brightest object shines but while 'tis new.\r\n   That influence lessens by familiar view.\r\n   Monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway,\r\n   All strive to serve, and glory to obey,\r\n   Alike unpitied when depos'd they grow--\r\n   Men mock the idol of their former vow.\r\n   Two great examples have been shown to-day,\r\n   To what sure ruin passion does betray,\r\n   What long repentance to short joys is due,\r\n   When reason rules, what glory must ensue.\r\n   If you will love, love like Eliza then,\r\n   Love for amusement, like those traitors, men.\r\n   Think that the pastime of a leisure hour\r\n   She favor'd oft--but never shar'd her pow'r.\r\n   The traveller by desert wolves pursued,\r\n   If by his heart the savage foe's subdu'd,\r\n   The world will still the noble act applaud,\r\n   Though victory was gain'd by needful fraud.\r\n   Such is, my tender sex, our helpless case,\r\n   And such the barbarous heart, hid by the begging face,\r\n   By passion fir'd, and not withheld by shame,\r\n   They cruel hunters are, we trembling game.\r\n   Trust me, dear ladies, (for I know 'em well),\r\n   They burn to triumph, and they sigh to tell:\r\n   Cruel to them that yield, cullies to them that sell.\r\n   Believe me, 'tis far the wiser course,\r\n   Superior art should meet superior force:\r\n   Hear, but be faithful to your int'rest still:\r\n   Secure your hearts--then fool with whom you will.\"\r\n\r\nAt Twickenham the Duke seems in some degree to have relied for his\r\nentertainment upon his pen. There he wrote his articles for the _True\r\nBriton_, and also indited various trifles in verse. Never neglecting an\r\nopportunity to indulge his humour, when Lady Mary Wortley Montagu wrote\r\na poem on the untimely death of a friend, he could not refrain from\r\npresenting her with a parody.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ON THE DEATH OF MRS. BOWES\r\n\r\n  _By Lady Mary Wortley Montagu_\r\n\r\n  \"Hail, happy bride! for thou art truly bless'd,\r\n   Three months of rapture crown'd with endless rest.\r\n   Merit like yours was Heav'n's peculiar care,\r\n   You lov'd--yet tasted happiness sincere:\r\n   To you the sweets of love were only shown,\r\n   The sure succeeding bitter dregs unknown.\r\n   You had not yet the fatal change deplor'd\r\n   The tender lover for th' imperious lord,\r\n   Nor felt the pains that jealous fondness brings,\r\n   Nor wept that coldness from possession springs,\r\n   Above your sex distinguish'd in your fate,\r\n   You trusted--yet experienc'd no deceit.\r\n   Soft were your hours, and wing'd with pleasure flew,\r\n   No vain repentance gave a sign to you,\r\n   And if superior bliss heav'n can bestow,\r\n   With fellow-angels you enjoy it now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE ANSWER\r\n\r\n  _By the Duke of Wharton_\r\n\r\n  \"Hail, Poetess! for thou art truly blest,\r\n   Of wit, of beauty, and of love possest,\r\n   Your muse does seem to bless poor Bowes's fate,\r\n   But far 'tis from you to desire her state,\r\n   In every line your wanton soul appears.\r\n   Your verse, tho' smooth, scarce fit for modest ears,\r\n   No pangs of jealous fondness doth thou shew.\r\n   And bitter dregs of love thou ne'er didst know:\r\n   The coldness that your husband oft has mourn'd,\r\n   Does vanish quite, when warm'd on Turkish ground.\r\n   For Fame does say, if Fame don't lying prove,\r\n   You paid obedience to the Sultan's love.\r\n   Who, fair one, then, was your imperious Lord?\r\n   Not Montagu, but Mahomet the word:\r\n   Great as your wit, just so is Wortley's love,\r\n   Your next attempt will be on thund'ring Jove,\r\n   The little angels you on Bowes bestow.\r\n   But gods themselves are only fit for you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo writer of verses likes to have fun poked at them, even in the form of\r\nfriendly banter, but Lady Mary seems to have borne the affliction\r\nadmirably.\r\n\r\nTwo persons with such impish humour could not but frequently find\r\nthemselves at loggerheads, but their liking for each other's society was\r\ngenuine, and quarrels were followed by peace-making. \"Sophia [as she\r\nnicknamed the young man] and I have been quite reconciled, and are now\r\nquite broke, and I believe not likely to piece up again,\" Lady Mary\r\nwrote to her sister. This was in February, 1725, and a little later in\r\nthe year the breach was widened by the really outrageous conduct of the\r\nDuke:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sophia and I have an immortal quarrel; which though I resolve never to\r\nforgive, I can hardly forbear laughing at. An acquaintance of mine is\r\nmarried, whom I wish very well to: Sophia has been pleased, on this\r\noccasion, to write the most infamous ballad that ever was written; where\r\nboth the bride and bridegroom are intolerably mauled, especially the\r\nlast, who is complimented with the hopes of cuckoldom, and forty other\r\nthings equally obliging, and Sophia has distributed this ballad in such\r\na manner as to make it pass for mine, on purpose to pique the poor\r\ninnocent soul of the new-married man, whom I should be the last of\r\ncreatures to abuse. I know not how to clear myself of this vile\r\nimputation, without a train of consequences I have no mind to fall into.\r\nIn the mean time, Sophia enjoys the pleasure of heartily plaguing both\r\nme and that, person.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably this \"immortal quarrel\" would have been made up, but at the\r\nbeginning of July the Duke went abroad never to return. \"Sophia is going\r\nto Aix-la-Chapelle, and thence to Paris,\" Lady Mary wrote to Lady Mar.\r\n\"I dare swear she'll endeavour to get acquainted with you. We are broke\r\nto an iremediable degree. Various are the persecutions I have endured\r\nfrom her this winter, in all of which I remain neuter, and shall\r\ncertainly go to heaven from the passive meekness of my temper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA FAMOUS QUARREL\r\n\r\nPope and Lady Mary--He pays her compliments--His jealousy of her other\r\nadmirers--The cause of his quarrel with her--His malicious attacks on\r\nher thereafter--Writes of her as \"Sappho\"--Lady Mary asks Arbuthnot to\r\nprotect her--Molly Skerritt--Lady Stafford--Lady Mary's malicious tongue\r\nand pen--Mrs. Murray--\"An Epistle from Arthur Grey\"--Lady Mary, Lord\r\nHervey, and Molly Lepell--Death of the Earl of Kingston--Lady\r\nGower--Lady Mar--Marriage of Lady Mary's daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Pope, it is curious to relate, though he was a near neighbour, she\r\nsaw less and less. It has been suggested that the first rift in the lute\r\nwas her parody of his verses about the lovers struck by lightning; but\r\neven he, most sensitive of men, can scarcely have been seriously offended.\r\nSo far as is known, only two letters passed between them after 1719.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I pass my time in a small snug set of dear intimates, and go very\r\nlittle into the _grand monde_, which has always had my hearty contempt\"\r\n(she wrote to Lady Mar in the spring of 1722). \"I see sometimes Mr.\r\nCongreve, and very seldom Mr. Pope, who continues to embellish his house\r\nat Twickenham. He has made a subterranean grotto, which he has furnished\r\nwith looking-glass, and they tell me it has a very good effect. I here\r\nsend you some verses addressed to Mr. Gay, who wrote him a\r\ncongratulatory letter on the finishing his house. I stifled them here,\r\nand I beg they may die the same death at Paris, and never go further\r\nthan your closet:\r\n\r\n  'Ah, Friend, 'tis true--this truth you lovers know--\r\n   In vain my structures rise, my gardens grow,\r\n   In vain fair Thames reflects the double scenes\r\n   Of hanging mountains, and of sloping greens:\r\n   Joy lives not here; to happier seats it flies,\r\n   And only dwells where Wortley casts her eyes.\r\n\r\n   What is the gay parterre, the chequer'd shade,\r\n   The morning bower, the ev'ning colonnade,\r\n   But soft recesses of uneasy minds,\r\n   To sigh unheard in, to the passing winds?\r\n   So the struck deer in some sequestrate part\r\n   Lies down to die, the arrow at his heart;\r\n   There, stretch'd unseen in coverts hid from day,\r\n   Bleeds drop by drop, and pants his life away.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that in Epistle VIII of the _Moral Essays_ Pope\r\nhad a line:\r\n\r\n  \"And other beauties envy Wortley's eyes\";\r\n\r\nbut in a reprint of the poem he substituted [Lady] \"Worsley\" for\r\n\"Wortley\" in order to give the impression that \"Wortley\" had been a\r\nmisprint.\r\n\r\nPope's quarrel with Lady Mary began in or about 1722. The cause is\r\nobscure. Many reasons have been advanced. Lady Mary in her\r\ncorrespondence gives no clue as to the breach.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that it arose out of the fact that Pope lent the\r\nMontagus a pair of sheets and that they were returned unwashed, to the\r\ngreat indignation of his mother who lived with him. It is difficult to\r\nbelieve this.\r\n\r\nOthers have it that he was jealous of the favour which Lady Mary\r\naccorded to the Duke of Wharton and Lord Hervey. Certainly he lampooned\r\nthe Duke, and he was never weary of writing insultingly about the other.\r\n\r\nMost probable is the account given by Lady Louisa Stuart, Lady Mary's\r\ngrand-daughter, which is to the effect that Pope made a declaration of\r\nlove, and that Lady Mary received it with shrieks of laughter. If Pope\r\nwere serious, it must have galled him indeed, though nothing can excuse\r\nthe malignity with which he pursued her for years and years. And if he\r\nwere not in earnest, he would probably have been nearly, if not quite,\r\nas indignant.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it is a sorry story, and a blot on the scutcheon of the poet,\r\nwho, good-hearted as he usually was, was cursed by the gift, refined to\r\na rare degree, of alienating his friends, more often than not for some\r\nfancied slight. Addison he lampooned, and from Dennis and Philips he\r\nparted company. \"Leave him as soon as you can,\" Addison had warned Lady\r\nMary. \"He will certainly play you some devilish trick else: he has an\r\nappetite for satire.\" Lady Mary presently must have wished that she had\r\nfollowed this sage counsel.\r\n\r\nWhen Pope fought, he fought with the gloves off; and not the sex or the\r\nage or the standing of the subject of his wrath deterred him a whit.\r\n\r\n  \"Have I, in silent wonder, seen such things\r\n   As pride in slaves, and avarice in kings;\r\n   And at a peer, or peeress, shall I fret,\r\n   Who starves a sister, or forswears a debt?\"\r\n\r\nThus Pope in the First Dialogue of the _Epilogue to the Satires._ The\r\nreference to forswearing a debt, is, of course, to the Rémond business;\r\n\"who starves a sister\" is an allusion to Lady Mary and Lady Mar.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _See_ p. 200 of this work.]\r\n\r\nPope returned to the attack again and again. In _The Satires of Dr. John\r\nDonne Versified_, he inserted the following lines, although there is\r\nnothing in the original to warrant the stroke at Lady Mary:\r\n\r\n  \"Yes, thank my stars! as early as I knew\r\n   This town, I had the sense to hate it too:\r\n   Yet here, as e'en in hell, there must be still\r\n   One giant vice, so excellently ill.\r\n   That all beside, one pities, not abhors:\r\n   As who knows Sappho, smiles at other whores.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _Epistle to Martha Blount_:\r\n\r\n  \"As Sappho's diamonds with her dirty smock;\r\n   Or Sappho at her toilet's greasy task,\r\n   With Sappho radiant at an evening mask.\"\r\n\r\nPope would not admit that he alluded to Lady Mary as Sappho, but\r\neveryone realised that this was so. Lady Mary, much distressed, begged\r\nLord Peterborough to urge Pope to refrain. The mission was undertaken\r\nreluctantly, and the result was scarcely satisfactory. \"He said to me,\"\r\nLord Peterborough wrote to Lady Mary, \"what I had taken the liberty of\r\nsaying to you, that he wondered how the town would apply these lines to\r\nany but some noted common woman; that he would yet be more surprised if\r\nyou should take them to yourself; he named to me four remarkable\r\npoetesses and scribblers, Mrs. Centlivre, Mrs. Heywood, Mrs. Manley, and\r\nMrs. Behn, assuring me that such only were the objects of his satire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch upset, Lady Mary wrote the following letter to Arbuthnot:\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 3 [1735].\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I have perused the last lampoon of your ingenious friend, and am not\r\nsurprised you did not find me out under the name of Sappho, because\r\nthere is nothing I ever heard in our characters or circumstances to make\r\na parallel, but as the town (except you, who know better) generally\r\nsuppose Pope means me, whenever he mentions that name, I cannot help\r\ntaking notice of the horrible malice he bears against the lady signified\r\nby that name, which appears to be irritated by supposing her writer of\r\nthe Verses to the Imitator of Horace. Now I can assure him they were\r\nwrote (without my knowledge) by a gentleman of great merit, whom I very\r\nmuch esteem, who he will never guess, and who, if he did know, he durst\r\nnot attack; but I own the design was so well meant, and so excellently\r\nexecuted, that I cannot be sorry they were written. I wish you would\r\nadvise poor Pope to turn to some more honest livelihood than libelling;\r\nI know he will allege in his excuse that he must write to eat, and he\r\nhas now grown sensible that nobody will buy his verses except their\r\ncuriosity is piqued to it, to see what is said of their acquaintance;\r\nbut I think this method of gain so exceeding vile that it admits of no\r\nexcuse at all.--Can anything be more detestable than his abusing poor\r\nMoore, scarce cold in his grave, when it is plain he kept back his poem,\r\nwhile he lived, for fear he should beat him for it? This is shocking to\r\nme, though of a man I never spoke to and hardly knew by sight; but I am\r\nseriously concerned at the worse scandal he has heaped on Mr. Congreve,\r\nwho was my friend, and whom I am obliged to justify, because I can do it\r\non my own knowledge, and, which is yet farther bring witness of it, from\r\nthose who were then often with me that he was so far from loving Pope's\r\nrhyme, both that--and his conversation were perpetual jokes to him,\r\nexceeding despicable in his opinion, and he has often made us laugh in\r\ntalking of them, being particularly pleasant on that subject. As to\r\nPope's being born of honest parents, I verily believe it, and will add\r\none praise to his mother's character, that (though I only knew her very\r\nold) she always appeared to me to have much better sense than himself. I\r\ndesire, sir, as a favour, that you would show this letter to Pope, and\r\nyou will very much oblige, sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your humble servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was not a person, after severe chastisement, to turn the other\r\ncheek, and Pope was well aware of it. He believed that more than one\r\nsocial satire upon him came from her pen; and he especially suspected\r\nher of having written, or anyhow of having had a hand in the composition\r\nof _A Pop upon Pope_, in which an account was given of a whipping in Ham\r\nWalk which was said to have been administered to him. The poet was so\r\nfurious--he regarded it as an indirect attack on his physical deformity,\r\nof which he was always so conscious--that he actually inserted an\r\nannouncement in the papers that no such incident had ever occurred--\r\nthereby drawing yet more attention to the lampoon. \"You may be certain I\r\nshall never reply to such a libel as Lady Mary's,\" he wrote to\r\nFortescue. \"It is a pleasure and comfort at once to find out that with\r\nso much mind as so much malice must have to accuse or blacken my\r\ncharacter, it can fix upon no one ill or immoral thing in my life and\r\nmust content itself to say, my poetry is dull and my person ugly.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary, in a letter to Arbuthnot, denied the authorship of _A Pop\r\nupon Pope_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Since I saw you I have made some inquiries, and heard more, of the\r\nstory you was so kind to mention to me. I am told Pope has had the\r\nsurprising impudence to assert he can bring the lampoon when he pleases\r\nto produce it, under my own hand; I desire he may be made to keep to\r\nthis offer. If he is so skilful in counterfeiting hands, I suppose he\r\nwill not confine that great talent to the gratifying his malice, but\r\ntake some occasion to increase his fortune by the same method, and I may\r\nhope (by such practices) to see him exalted according to his merit,\r\nwhich nobody will rejoice at more than myself. I beg of you, sir (as an\r\nact of justice), to endeavour to set the truth in an open light, and\r\nthen I leave to your judgment the character of those who have attempted\r\nto hurt mine in so barbarous a manner. I can assure you (in particular)\r\nyou named a lady to me (as abused in this libel) whose name I never\r\nheard before, and as I never had any acquaintance with Dr. Swift am an\r\nutter stranger to all his affairs and even his person, which I never saw\r\nto my knowledge, and am now convinced the whole is a contrivance of\r\nPope's to blast the reputation of one who never injured him. I am not\r\nmore sensible of his injustice, than I am, sir, of your [_sic_] candour,\r\ngenerosity, and good sense I have found in you, which has obliged me to\r\nbe with a very uncommon warmth your real friend, and I heartily wish for\r\nan opportunity of showing I am so more effectually than by subscribing\r\nmyself your very\r\n\r\n\"Humble servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether, in spite of her denial, Lady Mary had a hand in _A Pop upon\r\nPope_ cannot be said; but it is certainly safe to believe that the\r\nfollowing lines were written by her, in conjunction, the gossip of the\r\nday had it, with Lord Hervey, with some assistance from Mr. Wyndham,\r\nthen tutor to the Duke of Cumberland:\r\n\r\n  \"VERSES ADDRESSED TO THE IMITATOR OF THE FIRST SATIRE OF THE\r\n  SECOND BOOK OF HORACE.\r\n\r\n  _By a Lady_\r\n\r\n  \"Nor thou the justice of the world disown.\r\n   That leaves thee thus an outcast and alone:\r\n   For though in law the murder be to kill,\r\n   In equity the murder is the will.\r\n   Then while with coward hand you stab a name,\r\n   And try at least to assassinate our fame,\r\n   Like the first bold assassin be thy lot,\r\n   Ne'er be thy guilt forgiven or forgot;\r\n   But as thou hat'st by hatred by mankind,\r\n   And with the emblem of thy crooked mind\r\n   Marked on thy back, like Cain, by God's own hand,\r\n   Wander like him accursed through the land.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this malignant attack upon his person that inspired Pope's lines\r\nin the _Epistle to Arbuthnot_:\r\n\r\n  \"Once, and but once, his heedless youth was bit,\r\n   And liked that dangerous thing, a female wit.\r\n   Safe, so he thought, though all the prudent chid;\r\n   He writ no libels, but my lady did;\r\n   Great odds, in amorous or poetic game,\r\n   Where woman's is the sin, and man's the shame.\"\r\n\r\nWith the following extract from a letter written by Lady Mary from\r\nFlorence in 1740 this unpleasing incident may be dismissed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The word malignity, and a passage in your letter, call to my mind the\r\nwicked wasp of Twickenham: his lies affect me now no more; they will be\r\nall as much despised as the story of the seraglio and the handkerchief,\r\nof which I am persuaded he was the only inventor. That man has a\r\nmalignant and ungenerous heart; and he is base enough to assume the mask\r\nof a moralist, in order to decry human nature, and to give a decent vent\r\nto his hatred of man and woman kind.--But I must quit this contemptible\r\nsubject, on which a just indignation would render my pen so fertile,\r\nthat after having fatigued you with a long letter, I would surfeit you\r\nwith a supplement twice as long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Twickenham Lady Mary interested herself in planning alterations in\r\nthe house and gardens. \"There is a sort of pleasure,\" she said, \"in\r\nshewing one's own fancy on one's own ground.\" The longer she stayed at\r\nthe riverside, the better she liked it. \"I am at present at Twickenham,\"\r\nshe wrote in July, 1723, \"which is become so fashionable, and the\r\nneighbourhood so much enlarged, that 'tis more like Tunbridge or the\r\nBath than a country retreat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am now at the same distance from London that you are from Paris, and\r\ncould fall into solitary amusements with a good deal of taste; but I\r\nresist it, as a temptation of Satan, and rather turn my endeavours to\r\nmake the world as agreeable to me as I can, which is the true\r\nphilosophy; that of despising it is of no use but to hasten wrinkles\"\r\n(she wrote to Lady Mar in 1725). \"I ride a good deal, and have got a\r\nhorse superior to any two-legged animal, he being without a fault. I\r\nwork like an angel. I receive visits upon idle days, and I shade my life\r\nas I do my tent-stitch, that is, make as easy transitions as I can from\r\nbusiness to pleasure; the one would be too flaring and gaudy without\r\nsome dark shades of t'other; and if I worked altogether in the grave\r\ncolours, you know 'twould be quite dismal. Miss Skerritt is in the house\r\nwith, me, and Lady Stafford has taken a lodging at Richmond: as their\r\nages are different, and both agreeable in their kind, I laugh with the\r\none, or reason with the other, as I happen to be in a gay or serious\r\nhumour; and I manage my friends with such a strong yet with a gentle\r\nhand, that they are both willing to do whatever I have a mind to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Molly,\" that is, Maria Skerritt or Skirrett, is best known for her\r\nconnection with Sir Robert Walpole. There was nothing clandestine about\r\nthe relationship: it was openly avowed. Miss Skerritt, who was the\r\ndaughter of a London merchant, had great good looks and an ample\r\nfortune, and Walpole declared that she was indispensable to his\r\nhappiness. She was received everywhere, and moved in fashionable\r\nsociety. It was to Lady Walpole and Molly Skerritt that Gay alluded in\r\nthe song that he put in the mouth of Macheath (who was meant for Robert\r\nWalpole):\r\n\r\n  \"How happy could I be with either,\r\n   Were t'other dear Charmer away!\"\r\n\r\nLady Walpole survived until the summer of 1738, and after her death the\r\nothers married. The second Lady Walpole died of a miscarriage in June,\r\n1739, to the great and enduring sorrow of her husband. For the surviving\r\nchild, Walpole, when he accepted a peerage in 1742, secured the rank of\r\nan earl's daughter.\r\n\r\nLady Mary now spent her time between London and Twickenham. At Court,\r\nshe was as popular as ever with the King; and she was liked in literary\r\ncircles, and on good terms with Young, Arbuthnot, Garth, and the rest of\r\nthe set. \"I see every body but converse with nobody but _des amies\r\nchoisses_; in the first rank of these are Lady Stafford and dear Molly\r\nSkerritt, both of whom have now the additional merit of being old\r\nacquaintances, and never having given me any reason to complain of\r\neither of 'em. I pass some days with the Duchess of Montagu, who might\r\nbe a reigning beauty if she pleased. I see the whole town every Sunday,\r\nand select a few that I retain to supper. In short, if life could be\r\nalways what it is, I believe I have so much humility in my temper I\r\ncould be contented without anything better than this two or three\r\nhundred years but, alas!\r\n\r\n  'Dulness, and wrinkles, and disease, must come,\r\n   And age, and death's irrevocable doom.'\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary, who had some two-score years still to live, began at this\r\ntime to deplore her increasing age. \"For my own part,\" she wrote to\r\nLady Mar, \"I have some coteries where wit and pleasure reign, and I\r\nshould not fail to amuse myself tolerably enough, but for the d----d\r\nd----d quality of growing older every day, and my present joys are made\r\nimperfect by fears of the future.\" However, this depression was not\r\nalways on her, and later she was writing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think this is the first time in my life that a letter of yours has\r\nlain by me two posts unanswered. You'll wonder to hear that short\r\nsilence is occasioned by not having a moment unemployed at Twickenham;\r\nbut I pass many hours on horseback, and, I'll assure you, ride\r\nstag-hunting, which I know you'll stare to hear of. I have arrived to\r\nvast courage and skill that way, and am as well pleased with it as with\r\nthe acquisition of a new sense: his Royal Highness [the Prince of Wales]\r\nhunts in Richmond Park, and I make one of the _beau monde_ in his train.\r\nI desire you after this account not to name the word old woman to me any\r\nmore: I approach to fifteen nearer than I did ten years ago, and am in\r\nhopes to improve every year in health and vivacity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary's tongue made her many enemies in society, and when her tongue\r\nfailed her she brought her pen into action. Her love of scandal must\r\nhave gone far to make her unpopular, and if her letters to her sister at\r\nParis had been published she would have found herself with scarcely a\r\nfriend in the world.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence between Lady Mary, from London or Twickenham, to her\r\nsister, the Countess of Mar, at Paris, was a very one-sided affair. This\r\nwas, in part, owing to the fact that Lord Mar was, of course, suspect,\r\nand that letters to him or to members of his family and household were\r\n(in all probability) intercepted in this country. Lady Mary, who had\r\nsuspected this more than once, became more and more convinced that her\r\nsuspicions were justified. \"I have writ to you at least five-and-forty\r\nletters, dear sister, without receiving any answer, and resolved not to\r\nconfide in post-house fidelity any more, being firmly persuaded that\r\nthey never came to your hands, or you would not refuse one line to let\r\nme know how you do, which is and ever will be of great importance to\r\nme.\" That was written at Christmas, 1722, and though in the meantime\r\nLady Mary heard from her sister, she realised that if she wanted her\r\nletters to arrive she must be careful as to the topics upon which she\r\ndiscoursed. \"Letters are so surely opened, I dare say nothing to you\r\neither of our intrigues or duels, both of which would afford great\r\nmatter of mirth and speculation.\" The difficulties of communication did\r\nnot decrease. \"I have writ to you twice since I received yours in answer\r\nto that I sent by Mr. de Caylus,\" she remarked a little later; \"but I\r\nbelieve none of what I send by the post ever come to your hands, nor\r\never will while they are directed to Mr. Waters, for reasons that you\r\nmay easily guess. I wish you would give me a safer direction; it is very\r\nseldom I can have the opportunity of a private messenger, and it is very\r\noften that I have a mind to write to my dear sister.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary, of course, often stayed in London, and in her correspondence\r\nare many references to her friends and her doings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Operas flourish more than ever, and I have been in a tract of going\r\nevery time,\" she wrote to her sister in April, 1723. \"The people I live\r\nmost with are none of your acquaintance; the Duchess of Montagu\r\nexcepted, whom I continue to see often. Her daughter Belle is at this\r\ninstant in the paradisal state of receiving visits every day from a\r\npassionate lover, who is her first love; whom she thinks the finest\r\ngentleman in Europe, and is, besides that, Duke of Manchester. Her mamma\r\nand I often laugh and sigh reflecting on her felicity, the consummation\r\nof which will be in a fortnight. In the mean time they are permitted to\r\nbe alone together every day and all the day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMary's very best vein is the following letter, written about the same\r\ntime, and also addressed to her sister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am yet in this wicked town, but purpose to leave it as soon as the\r\nParliament rises. Mrs. Murray and all her satellites have so seldom\r\nfallen in my way, I can say little about them. Your old friend Mrs.\r\nLowther is still fair and young, and in pale pink every night in the\r\nParks; but, after being highly in favour, poor I am in utter disgrace,\r\nwithout my being able to guess wherefore, except she fancied me the\r\nauthor or abettor of two vile ballads written on her dying adventure,\r\nwhich I am so innocent of that I never saw [them]. _A propos_ of\r\nballads, a most delightful one is said or sung in most houses about our\r\ndear beloved plot, which has been laid firstly to Pope, and secondly to\r\nme, when God knows we have neither of us wit enough to make it. Mrs.\r\nHervey lies-in of a female child. Lady Rich is happy in dear Sir\r\nRobert's absence, and the polite Mr. Holt's return to his allegiance,\r\nwho, though in a treaty of marriage with one of the prettiest girls in\r\ntown (Lady Jane Wharton), appears better with her than ever. Lady Betty\r\nManners is on the brink of matrimony with a Yorkshire Mr. Monckton of\r\n£3,000 per annum: it is a match of the young duchess's making, and she\r\nthinks matter of great triumph over the two coquette beauties, who can\r\nget nobody to have and to hold; they are decayed to a piteous degree and\r\nso neglected that they are grown constant and particular to the two\r\nugliest fellows in London. Mrs. Pulteney condescends to be publicly kept\r\nby the noble Earl of Cadogan; whether Mr. Pulteney has a pad nag\r\ndeducted out of the profits for his share I cannot tell, but he appears\r\nvery well satisfied with it. This is, I think, the whole state of love;\r\nas to that of wit, it splits itself into ten thousand branches; poets\r\nincrease and multiply to that stupendous degree, you see them at every\r\nturn, even in embroidered coats and pink-coloured top-knots; making\r\nverses is almost as common as taking snuff, and God can tell what\r\nmiserable stuff people carry about in their pockets, and offer to\r\ntheir acquaintances, and you know one cannot refuse reading and taking a\r\npinch. This is a very great grievance, and so particularly shocking to\r\nme, that I think our wise lawgivers should take it into consideration,\r\nand appoint a fast-day to beseech Heaven to put a stop to this\r\nepidemical disease, as they did last year for the plague with great\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother typical letter from Lady Mary contains a story of the class that\r\nstrongly appealed to her:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The most diverting story about town at present is in relation to\r\nEdgcombe; though your not knowing the people concerned so well as I do,\r\nwill, I fear hinder you from being so much entertained by it. I can't\r\ntell whether you know a tall, musical, silly, ugly thing, niece to Lady\r\nEssex Roberts, who is called Miss Leigh. She went a few days ago to\r\nvisit Mrs. Betty Tichborne, Lady Sunderland's sister, who lives in the\r\nhouse with her, and was denied at the door; but, with the true manners\r\nof a great fool, told the porter that if his lady was at home she was\r\nvery positive she would be very glad to see her. Upon which she was\r\nshewed up stairs to Miss Tichborne, who was ready to drop down at the\r\nsight of her, and could not help asking her in a grave way how she got\r\nin, being denied to every mortal, intending to pass the evening in\r\ndevout preparation. Miss Leigh said she had sent away her chair and\r\nservants, with intent of staying till nine o'clock. There was then no\r\nremedy, and she was asked to sit down; but had not been there a quarter\r\nof an hour when she heard a violent rap at the door, and somebody\r\nvehemently run up stairs. Miss Tichborne seemed much surprised, and said\r\nshe believed it was Mr. Edgcombe, and was quite amazed how he took it\r\ninto his head to visit her. During these excuses enter Edgcombe, who\r\nappeared frighted at the sight of a third person. Miss Tichborne told\r\nhim almost at his entrance that the lady he saw there was perfect\r\nmistress of music, and as he passionately loved it, she thought she\r\ncould not oblige him more than by desiring her to play. Miss Leigh very\r\nwillingly sat to the harpsichord; upon which her audience decamped to\r\nthe adjoining room, and left her to play over three or four lessons to\r\nherself. They returned, and made what excuses they could, but said very\r\nfrankly they had not heard her performance, and begged her to begin\r\nagain; which she complied with, and gave them the opportunity of a\r\nsecond retirement. Miss Leigh was by this time all fire and flame to see\r\nher heavenly harmony thus slighted; and when they returned, told them\r\nshe did not understand playing to an empty room. Mr. Edgcombe begged ten\r\nthousand pardons, and said, if she would play _Godi_, it was a tune he\r\ndied to hear, and it would be an obligation he should never forget. She\r\nmade answer she would do him a much greater favour by her absence, which\r\nshe supposed was all that was necessary at that time; and ran down\r\nstairs in a great fury to publish as fast as she could; and was so\r\nindefatigable in this pious design, that in four-and-twenty hours all\r\nthe people in town had heard the story. My Lady Sunderland could not\r\navoid hearing this story, and three days after, invited Miss Leigh to\r\ndinner, where, in the presence of her sister and all the servants, she\r\ntold her she was very sorry she had been so rudely treated in her house;\r\nthat it was very true Mr. Edgcombe had been a perpetual companion of her\r\nsister's these two years, and she thought it high time he should explain\r\nhimself, and she expected her sister should act in this matter as\r\ndiscreetly as Lady K. [Katherine] Pelham had done in the like case; who\r\nhad given Mr. Pelham four months to resolve in, and after that he was\r\neither to marry her or to lose her for ever. Sir Robert Sutton\r\ninterrupted her by saying, that he never doubted the honour of Mr.\r\nEdgcombe, and was persuaded he could have no ill design in his family.\r\nThe affair stands thus, and Mr. Edgcombe has four months to provide\r\nhimself elsewhere; during which time he has free egress and regress; and\r\n'tis seriously the opinion of many that a wedding will in good earnest\r\nbe brought about by this admirable conduct.\r\n\r\n\"I send you a novel instead of a letter, but, as it is in your power to\r\nshorten it when you please, by reading no farther than you like, I will\r\nmake no excuses for the length of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary had contracted an intimacy with Griselda Baillie, the wife of\r\nMr. (afterwards Sir A.) Murray, of Stanhope, after her return from\r\nabroad, and there is frequent mention of her in the correspondence; but\r\nthe friendship came to an abrupt end in 1725.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Among the rest a very odd whim has entered the little head of Mrs.\r\nMurray: do you know she won't visit me this winter?\" Lady Mary wrote to\r\nLady Mar. \"I, according to the usual integrity of my heart, and\r\nsimplicity of my manners, with great _naïveté_ desired to explain with\r\nher on the subject, and she answered that she was convinced that I had\r\nmade the ballad upon her, and was resolved never to speak to me again. I\r\nanswered (which was true), that I utterly defied her to have any one\r\nsingle proof of my making it, without being able to get any thing from\r\nher, but repetitions that she knew it. I cannot suppose that any thing\r\nyou have said should occasion this rupture, and the reputation of a\r\nquarrel is always so ridiculous on both sides, that you will oblige me\r\nin mentioning it to her, for 'tis now at that pretty pass, she won't\r\ncurtsey to me whenever she mets me, which is superlatively silly (if she\r\nreally knew it), after a suspension of resentment for two years\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Murray had had an unpleasant adventure with her footman, Arthur\r\nGrey, who had broken into her bedroom. Lady Mary had written and\r\ncirculated _An Epistle from Arthur Grey,_ and later another, and an\r\nimproper, ballad had appeared under the title of _Virtue in Danger_.\r\nMrs. Murray was firmly convinced that both pieces came from the same\r\npen.\r\n\r\nLady Mar, on receipt of the above letter, proposed to act as peacemaker.\r\n\"I give you thanks for the good offices you promise with regard to Mrs.\r\nMurray,\" Lady Mary wrote to her in reply, \"and I shall think myself\r\nsincerely obliged to you, as I already am on many accounts. 'Tis very\r\ndisagreeable in her to go about behaving and talking as she does, and\r\nvery silly into the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Murray is in open war with me in such a manner as makes her very\r\nridiculous without doing me much harm; my moderation having a very\r\nbright pretence of shewing itself\" (she wrote to Lady Mar). \"Firstly,\r\nshe was pleased to attack me in very Billingsgate at a masquerade, where\r\nshe was as visible as ever she was in her own clothes. I had the temper\r\nnot only to keep silence myself, but enjoined it to the person with me;\r\nwho would have been very glad to have shewn his great skill in sousing\r\nupon that occasion. She endeavoured to sweeten him by very exorbitant\r\npraises of his person, which might even have been mistaken for making\r\nlove from a woman of less celebrated virtue; and concluded her oration\r\nwith pious warnings to him, to avoid the conversation of one so unworthy\r\nhis regard as myself, who to her certain knowledge loved another man.\r\nThis last article, I own, piqued me more than all her preceding\r\ncivilities. The gentleman she addressed herself to had a very slight\r\nacquaintance with me, and might possibly go away in the opinion that she\r\nhad been confidante in some very notorious affair of mine. However, I\r\nmade her no answer at the time, but you may imagine I laid up these\r\nthings in my heart; and the first assembly I had the honour to meet her\r\nat, with a meek tone of voice, asked her how I had deserved so much\r\nabuse at her hands, which I assured her I would never return. She denied\r\nit in the spirit of lying; and in the spirit of folly owned it at\r\nlength. I contented myself with telling her she was very ill advised,\r\nand thus we parted. But two days ago, when Sir Geoffrey Kneller's\r\npictures were to be sold, she went to my sister Gower, and very civily\r\nasked if she intended to bid for your picture; assuring her that, if she\r\ndid, she would not offer at purchasing it. You know crimp and quadrille\r\nincapacitate that poor soul from ever buying any thing; but she told me\r\nthis circumstance; and I expected the same civility from Mrs. Murray,\r\nhaving no way provoked her to the contrary. But she not only came to the\r\nauction, but with all possible spite bid up the picture, though I told\r\nher that, if you pleased to have it, I would gladly part with it to you,\r\nthough to no other person. This had no effect upon her, nor her malice\r\nany more on me than the loss of ten guineas extraordinary, which I paid\r\nupon her account. The picture is in my possession, and at your service\r\nif you please to have it. She went to the masquerade a few nights\r\nafterwards, and had the good sense to tell people there that she was\r\nvery unhappy in not meeting me, being come there on purpose to abuse me.\r\nWhat profit or pleasure she has in these ways I cannot find out. This I\r\nknow, that revenge has so few joys for me, I shall never lose so much\r\ntime as to undertake it.\"\r\n\r\nSo early as 1721, Lady Mary, writing to Lady Mar, mentions that \"the\r\nmost considerable incident that has happened a good while, was the\r\nardent affection that Mrs. Hervey and her dear spouse[7] took to me.\r\nThey visited me twice or thrice a day, and were perpetually cooing in my\r\nrooms. I was complaisant a great while; but (as you know) my talent has\r\nnever lain much that way. I grew at last so weary of those birds of\r\nparadise, I fled to Twickenham, as much to avoid their persecutions as\r\nfor my own health, which is still in a declining way.\" Lady Mary did not\r\nlike Lady Hervey, the beautiful \"Molly\" Lepell, whom Gay eulogised:\r\n\r\n  \"Hervey, would you know the passion\r\n      You have kindled in my breast?\r\n   Trifling is the inclination\r\n      That by words can be expressed.\r\n\r\n   In my silence see the lover;\r\n      True love is by silence known;\r\n   In my eyes you'll best discover,\r\n      All the power of your own.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The Hon. John Hervey (1696-1743), younger son of John,\r\nfirst Earl of Bristol; known as Lord Hervey after the death of his elder\r\nbrother Carr in 1723; Vice-Chamberlain of George II's Household, 1730;\r\ncreated Baron Hervey of Ickworth, 1733, Lord Privy Seal, 1740-1742.]\r\n\r\nFor Hervey, however, Lady Mary came to have a strong liking that many\r\nbelieved to have, as she would have said, bordered upon \"the tender\";\r\nalthough it is on record that she once remarked that she divided the\r\nhuman race into men, women, and Herveys. They met whenever they could;\r\nwhen they could not meet they corresponded. Pope bitterly resented the\r\nintimacy between Lady Mary and Hervey, and in the _Epistle of Arbuthnot_\r\ngave vent to the malignity with which his soul had been for years\r\noverflowing:\r\n\r\n  \"P.  Let Sporus tremble.\r\n\r\n   A.  What? That thing of silk;\r\n       Sporus, that mere white curd of ass's milk?\r\n       Satire or sense, alas! can Sporus feel?\r\n       Who breaks a butterfly on the wheel?\r\n\r\n   P.  Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings,\r\n       This painted Child of dirt, that stinks and stings;\r\n       Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys,\r\n       Yet wit ne'er tastes and beauty ne'er enjoys:\r\n       So well-bred spaniels civilly delight\r\n       In mumbling of the game they dare not bite.\r\n       Eternal smiles his emptiness betray,\r\n       As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.\r\n       Whether in florid impotence he speaks,\r\n       And, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks;\r\n       Or at the ear of Eve,[8] familiar toad.\r\n       Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad,\r\n       In pun, or politics, or tales, or lies.\r\n       Or spite, or smut, or rhymes, or blasphemies.\r\n       His wit all see-saw, between that and this,\r\n       Now high, now low, now make up, now miss,\r\n       And he himself one vile antithesis.\r\n       Amphibious thing! that acting either part,\r\n       The trifling head, or the corrupted heart;\r\n       Fop at the hostel, flatterer at the board,\r\n       Now trips a lady, and now struts a Lord.\r\n       Eve's tempter thus the Rabbins have expressed,\r\n       A cherub's face--a reptile all the rest.\r\n       Beauty that shocks you, parts that none can trust,\r\n       Wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Queen Caroline.]\r\n\r\nThis was a heavy price to pay for the favours even of Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontagu.\r\n\r\nWhatever the relations between Lady Mary and Hervey, Lady Hervey was not\r\nindulgent to them, which may have inspired Lady Mary to write to her\r\nsister: \"Lady Hervey, by aiming too high, has fallen very low; and is\r\nreduced to trying to persuade folks she has an intrigue, and gets nobody\r\nto believe her; the man in question taking a great deal of pains to\r\nclear himself of the scandal.\" Lady Hervey and Mrs. Murray were active\r\npartisans of Lord Grange in his persecution of Lady Mary, and aided him\r\nin his attempts to get possession of her sister, Lady Mar.\r\n\r\nThe bad terms on which Lady Mary and Lady Hervey were is most clearly\r\ndefined by Lady Louisa Stuart: \"At the time of Lady Mary Wortley's return\r\nhome [in 1762, after an absence abroad of more than twenty years], Lady\r\nHervey was living in great intimacy with Lady Bute, for whom she\r\nprofessed, and it is believed really felt, the highest esteem and\r\nadmiration. On hearing of her mother's arrival, she came to her, owning\r\nherself embarrassed by the fear of giving her pain or offence, but yet\r\ncompelled to declare that formerly something had passed between her and\r\nLady Mary which made any renewal of their acquaintance impossible;\r\ntherefore, if she forbore visiting her, she threw herself upon Lady\r\nBute's friendship and candour for pardon. No explanation followed. Lady\r\nBute, who must have early seen the necessity of taking care not to be\r\nentangled in her mother's quarrels, which, to speak truth, were seldom\r\nfew in number, only knew that there had been an old feud between her,\r\nLady Hervey, and Lady Hervey's friend, Mrs. (or Lady) Murray; the\r\nparticulars of which, forgotten even then by everybody but themselves,\r\nmay well be now beyond recall.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this period there were several domestic happenings in Lady Mary's\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1726, died her father, the Duke of Kingston. After the\r\naccession of George I, the Marquess of Dorchester (as he then was) was\r\nhigh in favour at Court, and honours were showered upon him with a\r\nlavish hand. He was in 1714 appointed Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire, and\r\nin the same year Chief Justice in Eyre, north of Trent, which latter\r\ndignity he held for two years. In August, 1715, he was created Duke of\r\nKingston upon Hull, in the county of Yorkshire. He held the high office\r\nof Lord Privy Seal from 1716 to 1719 in the Administrations of Townshend\r\nand Stanhope, in the latter year becoming Lord President of the Council.\r\nWhen Walpole became First Lord of the Treasury, the Duke again became\r\nLord Privy Seal, and held the post until his death. He was given the\r\nGarter in 1719, and was four times named as one of the Lord Justices of\r\nthe Realm during the King's absences from England on visits to Hanover.\r\nHe had married, secondly, Isabella, fifth daughter of William Bentinck,\r\nfirst Earl of Portland, by his first wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Edward\r\nVilliers, who survived him two years.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had never really forgiven Lady Mary for eloping. Her defiance\r\nof him hurt his pride inordinately. Everyone else to some degree at\r\nleast he could control; his young daughter not at all. Only so far were\r\nthey ever reconciled that he would occasionally visit the Montagus at\r\ntheir London house and play with the children.\r\n\r\nIn his later years the Duke's health was unsatisfactory, but it was not\r\nthought that the end was so near. \"I have now to tell you of the\r\nsurprising death of my father, and a great deal of surprising management\r\nof the people about him, which I leave informing you until another time,\r\nbeing now under some spirit of hurry myself,\" Lady Mary wrote to Lady\r\nMar in March, 1726. \"I am unfeignedly sorry that I cannot send you word\r\nof a considerable legacy for yourself.\" On April 15 she supplemented\r\nthis account; but not to a degree to make it very intelligible:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, the shock must be very great to you whenever you heard it;\r\nas indeed it was to us all here, being so sudden. It is to no purpose\r\nnow to relate particulars, but only renewing our grief. I can't forbear\r\ntelling you the Duchess has behaved very oddly in endeavouring to get\r\nthe guardianship of the young Duke and his sister, contrary to her\r\nhusband's will; but the boy, when he was fourteen, confirmed the\r\ntrustees his grandfather left; so that ended all disputes; and Lady\r\nFanny is to live with my aunt Cheyne. There is a vast number of things\r\nthat have happened, and some people's behaviour so extraordinary in this\r\nmelancholy business, that it would be great ease of mind if I could tell\r\nit you; but I must not venture to speak too freely in a letter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA week or so later, some further details were forthcoming:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I received yours, dear sister, this minute, and am very sorry both for\r\nyour past illness and affliction; though _au bout du compte_, I don't\r\nknow why filial piety should exceed fatherly fondness. So much by way of\r\nconsolation. As to the management at that time--I do verily believe, if\r\nmy good aunt and sister had been less fools, and my dear mother-in-law\r\nless mercenary, things might have had a turn more to your advantage and\r\nmine too; when we meet, I will tell you many circumstances which would\r\nbe tedious in a letter. I could not get my sister Gower to join to act\r\nwith me, and mamma and I were in an actual scold when my poor father\r\nexpired; she has shewn a hardness of heart upon this occasion that would\r\nappear incredible to any body not capable of it themselves. The addition\r\nto her jointure is, one way or other, £2000 per annum; so her good Grace\r\nremains a passable rich widow, and is already presented by the town with\r\na variety of young husbands; but I believe her constitution is not good\r\nenough to let her amorous inclinations get the better of her covetous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was very angry, because she heard that at the end her father\r\nhad really expressed a great deal of kindness to her, and even a desire\r\nof talking to her, which the Duchess would not permit. However, he left\r\nher in his will, she having married without a settlement, £6,000 for her\r\nseparate use during her life, with reversion to her daughter.\r\n\r\nAs regards the heir, she wrote: \"The Duke of Kingston has hitherto had so\r\nill an education, 'tis hard to make any judgment of him; he has spirit,\r\nbut I fear he will never have his father's good sense. As young noblemen\r\ngo, 'tis possible he may make a good figure among them.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Duke was sent to France, and there was much discussion as to\r\nwhat should be done with his sister, Lady Frances Pierrepont. Her having\r\n£400 per annum for maintenance, has, Lady Mary remarked ironically,\r\n\"awakened the consciences of half her relations to take care of her\r\neducation, and (excepting myself) they have all been squabbling about\r\nher. My sister Gower carries her off to-morrow morning to Staffordshire.\r\nThe lies, twaddles, and contrivances about this affair are innumerable.\r\nI should pity the poor girl if I saw she pitied herself.\"\r\n\r\nLady Gower did not long enjoy her victory over her friends and her fond\r\nrelations, for she died in June, 1727.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1732, Lord Mar died at Aix-la-Chapelle. Lady Mary's sister, Lady\r\nMar, in later years suffered from mental irregularity. Her brother-in-law,\r\nJames Erskine, Lord Grange, endeavoured to secure possession of her\r\nperson by some process of law, but was thwarted by Lady Mary, who\r\nobtained a warrant from the King's Bench. For years Lady Mar remained in\r\nher sister's custody. She survived until 1761. There was a rumour that\r\nLady Mary treated her badly, but there is no reason to believe that\r\nthere was any substantial ground for the accusation.\r\n\r\nLady Mary's daughter, Mary, married in 1736, John Stuart, third Earl of\r\nBute, the favourite of the Princess of Wales, and afterwards Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nON THE CONTINENT (1739-1744)\r\n\r\nLady Mary leaves England--She does not return for twenty years--Montagu\r\nsupposed to join her--The domestic relations of the Montagus--A\r\nseptennial act for marriage--Lady Mary corresponds with her\r\nhusband--Dijon--Turin--Venice--Bologna--Florence--The Monastery of La\r\nTrappe--Horace Walpole at Florence--His comments on Lady Mary and her\r\nfriends--Reasons for his dislike of her--Rome--The Young Pretender and\r\nHenry, Cardinal York--Wanderings--Cheapness of life in Italy--Lady\r\nMary's son, Edward--He is a great trouble to his parents--His absurd\r\nmarriage--His extravagance and folly--Account of his early years--He\r\nvisits Lady Mary at Valence--Her account of the interviews.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1739, Lady Mary went abroad. She did not return until the\r\nbeginning of 1762, a few months before her death.\r\n\r\nShe went abroad without her husband, and, indeed, they never met again.\r\nAt first, apparently, he had intended to join her--at least so she gave\r\nLady Pomfret to understand:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have put me to a very difficult choice, yet, when I consider we are\r\nboth in Italy, and yet do not see one another, I am astonished at the\r\ncapriciousness of my fortune\" (she wrote from Venice late in 1739). \"My\r\naffairs are so uncertain, I can answer for nothing that is future. I\r\nhave taken some pains to put the inclination for travelling into Mr.\r\nWortley's head, and was so much afraid he would change his mind, that I\r\nhastened before him in order (at least) to secure my journey. He\r\nproposed following me in six weeks, his business requiring his presence\r\nat Newcastle. Since that, the change of scene that has happened in\r\nEngland has made his friends persuade him to attend parliament this\r\nsession: so that what his inclinations, which must govern mine, will be\r\nnext spring I cannot absolutely foresee. For my own part, I like my own\r\nsituation so well that it will be a displeasure to me to change it. To\r\npostpone such a conversation as yours a whole twelvemonth is a terrible\r\nappearance; on the other hand, I would not follow the example of the\r\nfirst of our sex, and sacrifice for a present pleasure a more lasting\r\nhappiness. In short, I can determine nothing on this subject. When you\r\nare at Florence, we may debate it over again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo little is known of the domestic relations of the Montagus that it is\r\nhazardous to advance a conjecture. One writer has suggested that there\r\nwas a quarrel over money, but there are no grounds to support this.\r\nAnother has it that Lady Mary's flirtations or intrigues did not meet\r\nwith her husband's approval. Yet another thinks that Montagu found his\r\nwife with her sharp tongue, very ill to live with.\r\n\r\nThe Montagus had been married for seven-and-twenty years; their younger\r\nchild was now twenty-one. Since Montagu assisted Lady Mary as a girl\r\nwith her Latin studies, they do not seem to have had much in common.\r\nLady Mary cut a figure in the social world; Montagu was a nonentity in\r\npolitical life and seemed content so to be. Perhaps they were tired of\r\neach other, and welcomed a separation that at the outset was intended\r\nonly to be temporary. \"It was from the customs of the Turks that I first\r\nhad the thought of a septennial bill for the benefit of married\r\npersons,\" Lady Mary once said to Joseph Spence; and it is more than\r\nlikely that she would have taken advantage of such an Act of Parliament\r\nhad it been in existence.\r\n\r\nThat there was no definite breach is evident from the fact that husband\r\nand wife corresponded, though it must be confessed that her letters to\r\nher husband are almost uniformly dull, except when the topic is their\r\nson. On the other hand, there was certainly no especial degree of\r\nfriendship between them, and in one of her letters Lady Mary said\r\npointedly: \"You do not seem desirous to hear news, which makes me not\r\ntrouble you with any.\" For the rest there are descriptions of the places\r\nwhich Lady Mary visited and an account of the people she met.\r\n\r\nLady Mary proceeded from Dover to Calais, and thence to Dijon, where she\r\narrived in the middle of August. Wherever she went she found herself\r\namong friends. \"There is not any town in France where there is not\r\nEnglish, Scotch or Irish families established; and I have met with\r\npeople who have seen me (though often such as I do not remember to have\r\nseen) in every town I have passed through; and I think the farther I go,\r\nthe more acquaintance I meet,\" she told her husband. At Dijon there were\r\nno less than sixteen families of fashion. Lord Mansel had lodgings in\r\nthe house with her at Dijon, and Mrs. Whitsted, a daughter of Lord\r\nBathurst, resided in the same street. She met Lady Peterborough, and\r\njust missed the Duke of Rutland, at St. Omer. At Port Beauvoisin she ran\r\nacross Lord Carlisle.\r\n\r\nFrom Turin, she travelled, on the advice of Lord Carlisle, to Vienna,\r\nwhich he declared was the best place in Italy in which to stay. The fact\r\nthat it was the intention of Lady Pomfret to remove from Sienna to\r\nVienna was the deciding factor. She liked the latter city so well that\r\nshe remained there until August of the following year (1740). It had one\r\ngreat merit in Lady Mary's eyes, that it was cheap. Next to that, she\r\nderived pleasure from the consideration with which she was treated. \"I\r\nlike this place extremely, and am of opinion you would do so too: as to\r\ncheapness, I think 'tis impossible to find any part of Europe where both\r\nthe laws and customs are so contrived purposely to avoid expenses of all\r\nsorts; and here is a universal liberty that is certainly one of the\r\ngreatest _agréments_ in life. We have foreign ambassadors from all parts\r\nof the world, who have all visited me. I have received visits from many\r\nof the noble Venetian ladies; and upon the whole I am very much at my\r\nease here. If I was writing to Lady Sophia, I would tell her of the\r\ncomedies and operas which are every night, at very low prices; but I\r\nbelieve even you will agree with me that they are ordered to be as\r\nconvenient as possible, every mortal going in a mask, and consequently\r\nno trouble in dressing, or forms of any kind.\" So Lady Mary wrote to\r\nLady Pomfret on October 10; and a few days later she supplemented the\r\ninformation in a letter to her husband:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I find myself very well here. I am visited by the most considerable\r\npeople of the town, and all the foreign ministers, who have most of them\r\nmade great entertainments for me. I dined yesterday at the Spanish\r\nambassador's, who even surpassed the French in magnificence. He met me\r\nat the hall-door, and the lady at the stair-head, to conduct me through\r\nthe long apartment; in short, they could not have shown me more honours,\r\nif I had been an ambassadress. She desired me to think myself patrona\r\ndel casa, and offered me all the services in her power, to wait on me\r\nwhere I pleased, &c. They have the finest palace in Venice. What is very\r\nconvenient, I hear it is not at all expected I should make any dinners,\r\nit not being the fashion for anybody to do it here but the foreign\r\nministers; and I find I can live here very genteelly on my allowance. I\r\nhave already a very agreeable general acquaintance; though when I came,\r\nhere was no one I had ever seen in my life, but the Cavaliere Grimani\r\nand the Abbé Conti. I must do them [the] justice to say they have taken\r\npains to be obliging to me. The Procurator brought his niece (who is at\r\nthe head of his family) to wait on me; and they invited me to reside\r\nwith them at their palace on the Brent, but I did not think it proper to\r\naccept of it. He also introduced me to the Signora Pisani Mocenigo, who\r\nis the most considerable lady here. The Nuncio is particularly civil to\r\nme; he has been several times to see me, and has offered me the use of\r\nhis box at the opera. I have many others at my service, and, in short\r\nit, is impossible for a stranger to be better received than I am. Here\r\nare no English, except a Mr. Bertie and his governor, who arrived two\r\ndays ago, and who intends but a short stay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary thoroughly enjoyed herself at Venice, where she found a\r\nvariety of occupations to occupy her time. In the mornings she was\r\n\"wrapt up among my books with antiquarians and virtuosi\"; in the\r\nafternoons there were visits to pay and receive; in the evenings dinners\r\n(at other people's expense--which fact did not detract from her\r\npleasure), assemblies, and the theatre and the opera. In fact, she found\r\nthere every delight except scandal, but that she did not miss, because\r\nshe said, she \"never found any pleasure in malice.\" So strange a thing\r\nis human nature that perhaps she believed it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, I have spoken my real thoughts in relation to Venice; but\r\nI will be more particular in my description, lest you should find the\r\nsame reason of complaint you have hitherto experienced\" (she wrote in\r\nNovember to Lady Pomfret). \"It is impossible to give any rule for the\r\nagreeableness of conversation; but here is so great a variety, I think\r\n'tis impossible not to find some to suit every taste. Here are foreign\r\nministers from all parts of the world, who, as they have no Court to\r\nemploy their hours, are overjoyed to enter into commerce with any\r\nstranger of distinction. As I am the only lady here at present, I can\r\nassure you I am courted, as if I was the only one in the world. As to\r\nall the conveniences of life, they are to be had at very easy rates; and\r\nfor those that love public places, here are two playhouses and two\r\noperas constantly performed every night, at exceeding low prices. But\r\nyou will have no reason to examine that article, no more than myself;\r\nall the ambassadors having boxes appointed them; and I have every one of\r\ntheir keys at my service, not only for my own person, but whoever I\r\nplease to carry or send. I do not make much use of this privilege, to\r\ntheir great astonishment. It is the fashion for the greatest ladies to\r\nwalk the streets, which are admirably paved; and a mask, price sixpence,\r\nwith a little cloak, and the head of a domino, the genteel dress to\r\ncarry you everywhere. The greatest equipage is a gondola, that holds\r\neight persons, and is the price of an English chair. And it is so much\r\nthe established fashion for everybody to live their own way, that\r\nnothing is more ridiculous than censuring the actions of another. This\r\nwould be terrible in London, where we have little other diversion; but\r\nfor me, who never found any pleasure in malice, I bless my destiny that\r\nhas conducted me to a part where people are better employed than in\r\ntalking of the affairs of their acquaintance. It is at present excessive\r\ncold (which is the only thing I have to find fault with), but in\r\nrecompense we have a clear bright sun, and fogs and factions things\r\nunheard of in this climate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly everybody did the utmost to make Venice agreeable to Lady\r\nMary. With all her good opinion of herself and of her position, she\r\nfound herself treated with more distinction than she \"could possibly\r\nexpect.\" When, on Christmas Eve, she went to see the ceremony of High\r\nMass celebrated by the Doge, she was surprised to find that he had set\r\naside for her and the Prince of Wolfenbuttel a gallery, to which none\r\nwere admitted but their parties. \"A greater compliment could not have\r\nbeen paid me if I had been a sovereign Princess.\" To her husband she\r\nwrote: \"It is impossible to be better treated, I may even say more\r\ncourted, than I am here.\"\r\n\r\nAll the English who came to Venice, as a matter of course paid their\r\nrespects to Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lord Fitzwilliam arrived here three days ago; he came to see me the\r\nnext day, as all the English do, who are much surprised at the\r\ncivilities and familiarity which I am with the noble ladies. Everybody\r\ntells me 'tis what never was done but to myself; and I own I have a\r\nlittle vanity in it, because the French ambassador told me when I first\r\ncame, that though the Procurator Grimani might persuade them to visit\r\nme, he defied me to enter into any sort of intimacy with them: instead\r\nof which they call me out almost every day on some diversion or other,\r\nand are desirous to have me in all their parties of pleasure. I am\r\ninvited to-morrow to the Foscarini to dinner, which is to be followed\r\nby a concert and a ball, where I shall be the only stranger, though here\r\nare at present a great number come to see the regatta, which is fixed\r\nfor the 29th of this month, N.S. I shall see it at the Procurator\r\nGrimani's, where there will be a great entertainment that day. My own\r\nhouse is very well situated to see it, being on the Grand Canal; but I\r\nwould not refuse him and his niece, since they seem desirous of my\r\ncompany, and I shall oblige some other ladies with my windows. They are\r\nhired at a great rate to see the show.\"\r\n\r\nThere was just one fly in the ointment. \"I am impatient to hear good\r\nsense pronounced in my native tongue; having only heard my language out\r\nof the mouths of boys and governors for these five months\" (she\r\ncomplained to Lady Pomfret). \"Here are inundations of them broke in upon\r\nus this carnival, and my apartment must be their refuge; the greater\r\npart of them having kept an inviolable fidelity to the languages their\r\nnurses taught them; their whole business abroad (as far as I can\r\nperceive) being to buy new clothes, in which they shine in some obscure\r\ncoffee-house, where they are sure of meeting only one another; and after\r\nthe important conquest of some waiting gentlewoman of an opera queen,\r\nwhom perhaps they remember as long as they live, return to England\r\nexcellent judges of men and manners. I find the spirit of patriotism so\r\nstrong in me every time I see them, that I look on them as the greatest\r\nblockheads in nature; and, to say truth, the compound of booby and\r\n_petit maître_ makes up a very odd sort of animal.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until the middle of August (1740) that Lady Mary left Venice,\r\ngoing first to Bologna, where she stayed a day or two \"to prepare for\r\nthe dreadful passage of the Apennines.\" On her way to Florence, she\r\nvisited the monastery of La Trappe--her account of which may be given as\r\na companion portrait to that of the nunnery printed in an earlier\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The monastery of La Trappe, is of French origin, and one of the most\r\naustere and self-denying orders I have met with. In this gloomy retreat\r\nit gave me pain to observe the infatuation of men, who have devoutly\r\nreduced themselves to a much worse condition than that of the beasts.\r\nFolly, you see, is the lot of humanity, whether it arises in the flowery\r\npaths of pleasure, or the thorny ones of an ill-judged devotion. But of\r\nthe two sorts of fools, I shall always think that the merry one has the\r\nmost eligible fate; and I cannot well form a notion of that spiritual\r\nand ecstatic joy, that is mixed with sighs, groans, hunger, and thirst,\r\nand the other complicated miseries of monastic discipline. It is a\r\nstrange way of going to work for happiness to excite an enmity between\r\nsoul and body, which Nature and Providence have designed to live\r\ntogether in union and friendship, and which we cannot separate like man\r\nand wife when they happen to disagree. The profound silence that is\r\nenjoined upon the monks of La Trappe is a singular circumstance of their\r\nunsociable and unnatural discipline, and were this injunction never to\r\nbe dispensed with, it would be needless to visit them in any other\r\ncharacter than as a collection of statues; but the superior of the\r\nconvent suspended in our favour that rigorous law, and allowed one of\r\nthe mutes to converse with me, and answer a few discreet questions. He\r\ntold me that the monks of this order in France are still more austere\r\nthan those of Italy, as they never taste wine, flesh, fish, or eggs; but\r\nlive entirely upon vegetables. The story that is told of the institution\r\nof this order is remarkable, and is well attested, if my information is\r\ngood. Its founder was a French nobleman whose name was Bouthillior de\r\nRancé, a man of pleasure and gallantry, which were converted into the\r\ndeepest gloom of devotion by the following incident. His affairs obliged\r\nhim to absent himself, for some time, from a lady with whom he had lived\r\nin the most intimate and tender connexions of successful love. At his\r\nreturn to Paris he proposed to surprise her agreeably, and, at the same\r\ntime, to satisfy his own impatient desire of seeing her, by going\r\ndirectly and without ceremony to her apartment by a back stair, which he\r\nwas well acquainted with--but think of the spectacle that presented\r\nitself to him at his entrance into the chamber that had so often been\r\nthe scene of love's highest raptures! his mistress dead--dead of the\r\nsmall-pox--disfigured beyond expression--a loathsome mass of putrified\r\nmatter--and the surgeon separating the head from the body, because the\r\ncoffin had been made too short! He stood for a moment motionless in\r\namazement, and filled with horror--and then retired from the world, shut\r\nhimself up in the convent of La Trappe, where he passed the remainder of\r\nhis days in the most cruel and disconsolate devotion.--Let us quit this\r\nsad subject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news that Lady Mary was coming to Florence came to the ears of\r\nHorace Walpole, who was staying there. If he had not yet made her\r\nacquaintance, he certainly knew much about her. \"On Wednesday we expect\r\na third she-meteor,\" he wrote to Richard West, July 31, 1740. \"Those\r\nlearned luminaries the Ladies Pomfret and Walpole[9] are to be joined by\r\nthe Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. You have not been witness to the rhapsody\r\nof mystic nonsense which these two fair ones debate incessantly, and\r\nconsequently cannot figure what must be the issue of this triple\r\nalliance: we have some idea of it. Only figure the coalition of prudery,\r\ndebauchery, sentiment, history, Greek, Latin, French, Italian and\r\nmetaphysics; all, except the second, understood by halves, by quarters,\r\nor not at all. You shall have the journals of this notable academy.\"\r\nWalpole sent, some seven weeks later, an account of the lady to the Hon.\r\nHenry Seymour Conway: \"Did I tell you Lady Mary Wortley is here? She\r\nlaughs at my Lady Walpole, scolds my Lady Pomfret, and is laughed at by\r\nthe whole town. Her dress, her avarice, and her impudence must amaze any\r\none that never heard her name. She wears a foul mob, that does not cover\r\nher greasy black locks, that hang loose, never combed or curled,\r\nmazarine blue wrapper, that gapes open and discovers a canvas petticoat.\r\nHer face swollen violently on one side is partly covered with a\r\nplaister, and partly with white paint, which for cheapness she has\r\nbought so coarse, that you would not use it to wash a chimney.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The wife of the eldest son of Sir Robert Walpole, who in\r\n1723 was created Baron Walpole. He later succeeded as (second) Earl of\r\nOrford.]\r\n\r\nIn another letter, to Richard West (October 2, 1740), Walpole gives an\r\naccount of the \"Academy.\" \"But for the Academy, I am not of it; but\r\nfrequently in company with it,\" he wrote. \"Tis all disjointed. Madame\r\n----,[10] who, though a learned lady, has not lost her modesty and\r\ncharacter, is extremely scandalised with the two other dames, especially\r\nwith Moll Worthless,[11] who knows no bounds. She is at rivalry with\r\nLady W---- [12] for a certain Mr.----, whom perhaps you knew at\r\nOxford.... He fell into sentiments with my Lady W., and was happy to\r\ncatch her at platonic love; but as she seldom stops there, the poor man\r\nwill be frightened out of his senses when she shall break the matter to\r\nhim, for he never dreamt that her purposes were so naught. Lady Mary is\r\nso far gone that to get him from the mouth of her antagonist, she\r\nliterally took him out to dance country dances at a formal ball, where\r\nthere was no measure kept in laughing at her.... She played at Pharaoh\r\ntwo or three times at Princess Craon's, where she cheats horse and foot.\r\nShe is really entertaining: I have been reading her works, which she\r\nlends out in manuscript; but they are too womanish: I like few of her\r\nperformances.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Lady Pomfret.]\r\n[Footnote 11: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.]\r\n[Footnote 12: Lady Walpole.]\r\n\r\nLady Mary was, of course, entirely ignorant of Horace Walpole's feelings\r\nabout her, of which naturally he showed no sign in social intercourse\r\nwith her. \"I saw him often both at Florence and Genoa, and you may\r\nbelieve I know him,\" she told her daughter. \"I was well acquainted with\r\nMr. Walpole at Florence, and indeed he was particularly civil to me,\"\r\nshe wrote on another occasion. \"I have great encouragement to ask favour\r\nof him, if I did not know that few people have so good memories to\r\nremember so many years backwards as have passed since I have seen him.\r\nIf he has treated the character of Queen Elizabeth with disrespect [in\r\n_A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England_], all the women\r\nshould tear him to pieces, for abusing the glory of their sex. Neither\r\nis it just to put her in the list of authors, having never published\r\nanything, though we have Mr. Camden's authority that she wrote many\r\nvaluable pieces, chiefly Greek translations. I wish all monarchs would\r\nbestow their leisure hours on such studies: perhaps they would not be\r\nvery useful to mankind; but it may be asserted, for a certain truth,\r\ntheir own minds could be more improved than by the amusements of\r\nquadrille or Cavagnole.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary need not have feared that Walpole had forgotten her; he bore\r\nher much in mind to his dying day, and found never a kind thing to say\r\nabout her. It may be presumed that his animosity arose from the fact\r\nthat Lady Mary had championed Molly Skerritt against his mother, when\r\nMiss Skerritt was living openly as the mistress of Sir Robert Walpole.\r\nYet, though he wrote so abusively about her, he concerned himself with a\r\nnew edition of the _Court Poems_, though with what right has never\r\ntranspired. \"I have lately had Lady Mary Wortley's Ecloques published;\r\nbut they don't please, though so excessively good,\" he wrote to Sir\r\nHorace Mann, November 24, 1747. \"I say so confidently, for Mr. Chute\r\nagrees with me: he says, for the _Epistle from Arthur Grey_, scarce any\r\nwoman could have written it, and no man; for a man who had had\r\nexperience enough to paint such sentiments so well, would not have had\r\nwarmth enough left. Do you know anything of Lady Mary? Her adventurous\r\nson is come in Parliament, but has not opened.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Florence, Lady Mary repaired to Rome. There, she did not see the\r\nChevalier de St. George, but she did see his two sons, Charles Edward,\r\nthe Young Pretender, and Henry, Cardinal York. \"The eldest seems\r\nthoughtless enough, and is really not unlike Mr. Lyttelton in his shape\r\nand air,\" she wrote to Montagu. \"The youngest is very well made, dances\r\nfinely, and has an ingenuous countenance; he is but fourteen years of\r\nage. The family live very splendidly, yet pay everybody, and (wherever\r\nthey get it) are certainly in no want of money.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary seems to have had no prepared itinerary, but to have wandered\r\nas the spirit moved her--Naples, Leghorn, Turin, Genoa. The cheapness of\r\nItaly appealed to her frugal mind.\r\n\r\n\"The manners of Italy are so much altered since we were here last, the\r\nalteration is scarce credible. They say it has been by the last war. The\r\nFrench, being masters, introduced all their customs, which were eagerly\r\nembraced by the ladies, and I believe will never be laid aside; yet the\r\ndifferent governments make different manners in every state. You know,\r\nthough the republic is not rich, here are many private families vastly\r\nso, and live at a great superfluous expense: all the people of the first\r\nquality keep coaches as fine as the Speaker's, and some of them two or\r\nthree, though the streets are too narrow to use them in the town; but\r\nthey take the air in them, and their chairs carry them to the gates. The\r\nliveries are all plain: gold or silver being forbidden to be worn within\r\nthe walls, the habits are all obliged to be black, but they wear\r\nexceeding fine lace and linen; and in their country-houses, which are\r\ngenerally in the faubuurg, they dress very rich, and have extreme fine\r\njewels. Here is nothing cheap but houses. A palace fit for a prince may\r\nbe hired for fifty pounds per annum; I mean unfurnished. All games of\r\nchance are strictly prohibited, and it seems to me the only law they do\r\nnot try to evade: they play at quadrille, piquet, &c., but not high.\r\nHere are no regular public assemblies. I have been visited by all of the\r\nfirst rank, and invited to several fine dinners, particularly to the\r\nwedding of one of the house of Spinola, where there were ninety-six sat\r\ndown to table, and I think the entertainment one of the best I ever saw.\r\nThere was the night following a ball and supper for the same company,\r\nwith the same profusion. They tell me that all their great marriages are\r\nkept in the same public manner. Nobody keeps more than two horses, all\r\ntheir journeys being post; the expense of them, including the coachman,\r\nis (I am told) fifty pounds per annum. A chair is very near as much; I\r\ngive eighteen francs a week for mine. The senators can converse with no\r\nstrangers during the time of their magistracy, which lasts two years.\r\nThe number of servants is regulated, and almost every lady has the same,\r\nwhich is two footmen, a gentleman-usher, and a page, who follows her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly the simple life appealed to Lady Mary, but much as she liked\r\nGeneva the cost of living irked her. \"Everything is as dear as it is at\r\nLondon,\" she complained to her husband in November, 1741. \"'Tis true, as\r\nall equipages are forbidden, that expense is entirely retrenched.... The\r\nway of living is absolutely the reverse of that in Italy. Here is no\r\nshow, and a great deal of eating; there is all the magnificence\r\nimaginable, and no dinners but on particular occasions; yet the\r\ndifference of the prices renders the total expense very near equal....\r\nThe people here are very well to be liked, and this little republic has\r\nan air of the simplicity of old Rome in its earliest age. The\r\nmagistrates toil with their own hands, and their wives literally dress\r\ntheir dinners against their return from their little senate. Yet without\r\ndress and equipage 'tis as dear living here for a stranger, as in places\r\nwhere one is obliged to both, from the price of all sort of provision,\r\nwhich they are forced to buy from their neighbours, having almost no\r\nland of their own.\" How much more agreeable, from Lady Mary's point of\r\nview, was Chambery: \"Here is the most profound peace and unbounded\r\nplenty that is to be found in any corner of the universe; but not one\r\nrag of money. For my part, I think it amounts to the same thing, whether\r\none is obliged to give several pence for bread, or can have a great deal\r\nof bread for a penny, since the Savoyard nobility here keep as good\r\ntables, without money, as those in London, who spend in a week what\r\nwould be here a considerable yearly revenue. Wine, which is equal to the\r\nbest burgundy, is sold for a penny a quart, and I have a cook for very\r\nsmall wages, that is capable of rivalling Chloé.\"\r\n\r\n\"My girl gives me great prospect of satisfaction, but my young rogue of\r\na son is the most ungovernable little rake that ever played truant,\"\r\nLady Mary wrote to Lady Mar in July, 1727, when the boy was fourteen and\r\nthe girl nine years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that young Edward, who was placed at\r\nWestminster School at the early age of five, ran away. In fact, he ran\r\naway more than once. \"My blessed offspring has already made a great\r\nnoise in the world,\" his mother told Lady Mar in July, 1726. \"That young\r\nrake, my son, took to his heels t'other day and transported his person\r\nto Oxford; being in his own opinion thoroughly qualified for the\r\nUniversity. After a good deal of search we found and reduced him, much\r\nagainst his will, to the humble condition of a schoolboy. It happens\r\nvery luckily that the sobriety and discretion is of my daughter's side;\r\nI am sorry the ugliness is so too, for my son grows extremely handsome.\"\r\nThe lad was incorrigible. In the following year he disappeared for some\r\nmonths, to be found selling fish at Blackwall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My cousin is going to Paris, and I will not let her go without a letter\r\nfor you, my dear sister, though I was never in a worse humour for\r\nwriting\" (the anxious mother wrote to her sister). \"I am vexed to the\r\nblood by my young rogue of a son; who has contrived at his age to make\r\nhimself the talk of the whole nation. He is gone knight-erranting, God\r\nknows where; and hitherto 'tis impossible to find him. You may judge of\r\nmy uneasiness by what your own would be if dear Lady Fanny was lost.\r\nNothing that ever happened to me has troubled me so much; I can hardly\r\nspeak or write of it with tolerable temper, and I own it has changed\r\nmine to that degree I have a mind to cross the water, to try what effect\r\na new heaven and a new earth will have upon my spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, Edward ran away again, joining the crew of a ship going to\r\nOporto, and was not discovered in that city until a considerable period\r\nhad elapsed since his flight.\r\n\r\nHe capped all his follies by marrying at the age of twenty a woman of no\r\nsocial standing and much older than himself.\r\n\r\nHis parents were at their wits' end. It was hopeless to treat him as a\r\nrational being. His wife was induced to accept a pension to leave him,\r\nand he himself was put in charge of a keeper. Several times he had to be\r\nkept in close confinement. He was, however, by no means devoid of\r\nbrains, and in the autumn of 1741 he had sufficiently recovered to be\r\nentered as a student at the University of Leyden. His allowance was £300\r\na year, which he found so insufficient for the indulgence of his tastes\r\nthat he was soon considerably in debt.\r\n\r\nIn Lady Mary's correspondence there are many letters to her husband\r\nabout their son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Genoa, Aug. 15, 1741.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to trouble you on so disagreeable a subject as our son, but\r\nI received a letter from him last post, in which he solicits your\r\ndissolving his marriage, as if it was wholly in your power, and the\r\nreason he gives for it, is so that he may marry more to your\r\nsatisfaction. It is very vexatious (though no more than I expected) that\r\ntime has no effect, and that it is impossible to convince him of his\r\ntrue situation. He enclosed this letter in one to Mr. Birtles, and tells\r\nme that he does not doubt that debt of £200 is paid. You may imagine\r\nthis silly proceeding occasioned me a dun from Mr. Birtles. I told him\r\nthe person that wrote the letter, was, to my knowledge, not worth a\r\ngroat, which was all I thought proper to say on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lyons, April 23, 1742.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad you have been prevailed on to let our son take a\r\ncommission: if you had prevented it, he would have always said, and\r\nperhaps thought, and persuaded other people, you had hindered his\r\nrising in the world; though I am fully persuaded that he can never make\r\na tolerable figure in any station of life. When he was at Morins, on his\r\nfirst leaving France, I then tried to prevail with him to serve the\r\nEmperor as volunteer; and represented to him that a handsome behaviour\r\none campaign might go a great way in retrieving his character; and\r\noffered to use my interest with you (which I said I did not doubt would\r\nsucceed) to furnish him with a handsome equipage. He then answered, he\r\nsupposed I wished him killed out of the way. I am afraid his pretended\r\nreformation is not very sincere. I wish time may prove me in the wrong.\r\nI here enclose the last letter I received from him; I answered it the\r\nfollowing post in these words:\r\n\r\n\"'I am very glad you resolve to continue obedient to your father, and\r\nare sensible of his goodness towards you. Mr. Birtles showed me your\r\nletter to him, in which you enclosed yours to me, where you speak to him\r\nas your friend; subscribing yourself his faithful humble servant. He was\r\nat Genoa in his uncle's house when you was there, and well acquainted\r\nwith you; though you seem ignorant of everything relating to him. I wish\r\nyou would make such sort of apologies for any errors you may commit. I\r\npray God your future behaviour may redeem the past, which will be a\r\ngreat blessing to your affectionate mother.'\r\n\r\n\"I have not since heard from him; I suppose he knew not what to say to\r\nso plain a detected falsehood. It is very disagreeable to me to converse\r\nwith one from whom I do not expect to hear a word of truth, and who, I\r\nam very sure, will repeat many things that never passed in our\r\nconversation. You see the most solemn assurances are not binding from\r\nhim, since he could come to London in opposition to your commands, after\r\nhaving so frequently protested he would not move a step except by your\r\norder. However, as you insist on my seeing him, I will do it, and think\r\nValence the properest town for that interview; it is but two days'\r\njourney from this place; it is in Dauphiné.\r\n\r\n\"I shall stay here till I have an answer to this letter. If you order\r\nyour son to go to Valence, I desire you would give him a strict command\r\nof going by a feigned name. I do not doubt your returning me whatever\r\nmoney I may give him; but as I believe, if he receives money from me, he\r\nwill be making me frequent visits, it is clearly my opinion I should\r\ngive him none. Whatever you may think proper for his journey, you may\r\nremit to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lyons, April 25 [1742].\r\n\r\n\"On recollection (however inconvenient it may be to me on many\r\naccounts), I am not sorry to converse with my son. I shall at least have\r\nthe satisfaction of making a clear judgment of his behaviour and temper:\r\nwhich I shall deliver to you in the most sincere and unprejudiced\r\nmanner. You need not apprehend that I shall speak to him in passion. I\r\ndo not know that I ever did in my life. I am not apt to be over-heated\r\nin discourse, and am so far prepared, even for the worst on his side,\r\nthat I think nothing he can say can alter the resolution I have taken of\r\ntreating him with calmness. Both nature and interest (were I inclined to\r\nfollow blindly the dictates of either) would determine me to wish him\r\nyour heir rather than a stranger; but I think myself obliged both by\r\nhonour, conscience and my regard for you, no way to deceive you; and I\r\nconfess, hitherto I see nothing but falsehood and weakness through his\r\nwhole conduct. It is possible this person may be altered since I saw\r\nhim, but his figure then was very agreeable and his manner insinuating.\r\nI very well remember the professions he made to me, and do not doubt he\r\nis as lavish of them to other people. Perhaps Lord Carteret may think\r\nhim no ill match for an ugly girl that sticks upon his hands. The\r\nproject of breaking his marriage shows at least his devotion\r\ncounterfeit, since I am sensible it cannot be done but by false witness.\r\nHis wife is not young enough to get gallants, nor rich enough to buy\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I make choice of Valence for our interview as a town where we are not\r\nlikely to find any English, and he may if he pleases be quite unknown;\r\nwhich it is hardly possible to be in any capital town either of France\r\nor Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lyons, May 2 [1742].\r\n\r\n\"I received this morning yours of April 12, and at the same time the\r\nenclosed which I send you. Tis the first I have received since the\r\ndetection of that falsehood in regard to Mr. Birtles. I always send my\r\nletters open, that Mr. Clifford (who has the character of sense and\r\nhonesty) might be witness of what I said; and he not left at liberty to\r\nforge orders he never received. I am very glad I have done so, and am\r\npersuaded that had his reformation been what you suppose it, Mr.\r\nClifford would have wrote to me in his favour. I confess I see no\r\nappearance of it. His last letter to you, and this to me, seems to be no\r\nmore in that submissive style he has used, but like one that thinks\r\nhimself well protected. I will see him, since you desire it, at Valence;\r\nwhich is a by-town, where I am less likely to meet with English than any\r\ntown in France; but I insist on his going by a feigned name, and coming\r\nwithout a servant. People of superior fortunes to him (to my knowledge)\r\nhave often travelled from Paris to Lyons in the _diligence_; the expense\r\nis but one hundred livres, £5 sterling, all things paid. It would not be\r\neasy to me, at this time, to send him any considerable sum; and whatever\r\nit is, I am persuaded, coming from me, he would not be satisfied with\r\nit, and make his complaints to his companions. As to the alteration of\r\nhis temper, I see the same folly throughout. He now supposes (which is\r\nat best downright childish) that one hour's conversation will convince\r\nme of his sincerity. I have not answered his letter, nor will not, till\r\nI have your orders what to say to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Avignon] May 6 [1742].\r\n\r\n\"I here send you enclosed the letter I mentioned of your son's; the\r\npacket in which it was put was mislaid in the journey; it will serve to\r\nshow you how little he is to be depended on. I saw a Savoyard man of\r\nquality at Chambery, who knew him at Venice, and afterwards at Genoa,\r\nwho asked me (not suspecting him for my son) if he was related to my\r\nfamily. I made answer he was some relation. He told me several tricks of\r\nhis. He said, that at Genoa he had told him that an uncle of his was\r\ndead and had left him £5,000 or £6,000 per annum, and that he was\r\nreturning to England to take possession of his estate; in the meantime\r\nhe wanted money; and would have borrowed some of him, which he refused.\r\nI made answer that he did very well. I have heard of this sort of\r\nconduct in other places; and by the Dutch letters you have sent me I am\r\npersuaded he continues the same method of lying which convinces me that\r\nhis pretended enthusiasm is only to cheat those that can be imposed on\r\nby it. However, I think he should not be hindered accepting a\r\ncommission. I do not doubt it will be pawned or sold in a twelvemonth;\r\nwhich will prove to those that now protect him how little he deserves\r\nit. I am now at Avignon, which is within one day's journey of Valence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Avignon, May 23 [1742].\r\n\r\n\"I received this morning yours of April 12 and 29th, and at the same\r\ntime one from my son at Paris, dated the 4th instant. I have wrote to\r\nhim this day, that on his answer I will immediately set out to Valence,\r\nand shall be glad to see him there. I suppose you are now convinced I\r\nhave never been mistaken in his character; which remains unchanged, and\r\nwhat is yet worse, I think is unchangeable. I never saw such a\r\ncomplication of folly and falsity as in his letter to Mr. Gibson.\r\nNothing is cheaper than living in an inn in a country town in France;\r\nthey being obliged to ask no more than twenty-five sous for dinner, and\r\nthirty for supper and lodging, of those that eat at the public table;\r\nwhich all the young men of quality I have met have always done. It is\r\ntrue I am forced to pay double, because I think the decency of my sex\r\nconfines me to eat in my chamber. I will not trouble you with detecting\r\na number of other falsehoods that are in his letters. My opinion on the\r\nwhole (since you give me leave to tell it) is, that if I was to speak\r\nin your place, I would tell him, 'That since he is obstinate in going\r\ninto the army, I will not oppose it; but as I do not approve, I will\r\nadvance no equipage till I know his behaviour to be such as shall\r\ndeserve my future favour. Hitherto he has always been directed, either\r\nby his own humour, or the advice of those he thought better friends to\r\nhim than myself. If he renounces the army, I will continue to him his\r\nformer allowance; notwithstanding his repeated disobedience, under the\r\nmost solemn professions of duty. When I see him act like a sincere\r\nhonest man, I shall believe well of him; the opinion of others, who\r\neither do not know him or are imposed on by his pretences, weighs\r\nnothing with me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 30 Lady Mary went from Avignon to Valence, where about a week\r\nlater her son visited her. She at once sent a full account to Montagu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Avignon, June 10 [1742.]\r\n\r\n\"I am just returned from passing two days with our son, of whom I will\r\ngive you the most exact account I am capable of. He is so much altered\r\nin his person, I should scarcely have known him. He has entirely lost\r\nhis beauty, and looks at least seven years older than he is; and the\r\nwildness that he always had in his eyes is so much increased it is\r\ndownright shocking, and I am afraid will end fatally. He is grown fat,\r\nbut is still genteel, and has an air of politeness that is agreeable. He\r\nspeaks French like a Frenchman, and has got all the fashionable\r\nexpressions of that language, and a volubility of words which he always\r\nhad, and which I do not wonder should pass for wit with inconsiderate\r\npeople. His behaviour is perfectly civil, and I found him very\r\nsubmissive; but in the main, no way really improved in his\r\nunderstanding, which is exceedingly weak; and I am convinced he will\r\nalways be led by the person he converses with either right or wrong, not\r\nbeing capable of forming any fixed judgment of his own. As to his\r\nenthusiasm, if he had it, I suppose he has already lost it; since I\r\ncould perceive no turn of it in all his conversation. But with his head\r\nI believe it is possible to make him a monk one day and a Turk three\r\ndays after. He has a flattering, insinuating manner, which naturally\r\nprejudices strangers in his favour. He began to talk to me in the usual\r\nsilly cant I have so often heard from him, which I shortened by telling\r\nhim I desired not to be troubled with it; that professions were of no\r\nuse where actions were expected; and that the only thing could give me\r\nhopes of a good conduct was regularity and truth. He very readily agreed\r\nto all I said (as indeed he has always done when he has not been\r\nhot-headed). I endeavoured to convince him how favourably he has been\r\ndealt with, his allowance being much more than, had I been his father, I\r\nwould have given in the same case. The Prince of Hesse, who is now\r\nmarried to the Princess of England, lived some years at Geneva on £300\r\nper annum. Lord Hervey sent his son at sixteen thither, and to travel\r\nafterwards, on no larger pension than £200; and, though without a\r\ngovernor, he had reason enough, not only to live within the compass of\r\nit, but carried home little presents for his father and mother, which he\r\nshowed me at Turin. In short, I know there is no place so expensive, but\r\na prudent single man may live in it on £100 per annum, and an\r\nextravagant one may run out ten thousand in the cheapest. Had you (said\r\nI to him) thought rightly, or would have regarded the advice I gave you\r\nin all my letters, while in the little town of Islestein, you would have\r\nlaid up £150 per annum; you would now have had £750 in your pocket;\r\nwhich would have almost paid your debts, and such a management would\r\nhave gained you the esteem of the reasonable part of mankind. I\r\nperceived this reflection, which he had never made himself, had a very\r\ngreat weight with him. He would have excused part of his follies, by\r\nsaying Mr. G. had told him it became Mr. W.'s son to live handsomely. I\r\nmade answer, that whether Mr. G. had said so or no, the good sense of\r\nthe thing was noway altered by it; that the true figure of a man was\r\nthe opinion the world had of his sense and probity, and not the idle\r\nexpenses, which were only respected by foolish or ignorant people; that\r\nhis case was particular, he had but too publicly shown his inclination\r\nto vanities, and the most becoming part he could now act would be owning\r\nthe ill use he had made of his father's indulgence, and professing to\r\nendeavour to be no further expense to him, instead of scandalous\r\ncomplaints, and being always at his last shirt and last guinea, which\r\nany man of spirit would be ashamed to own. I prevailed so far with him\r\nthat he seemed very willing to follow this advice; and I gave him a\r\nparagraph to write to G., which I suppose you will easily distinguish\r\nfrom the rest of his letter. He asked me if you had settled your estate.\r\nI made answer, that I did not doubt (like all other wise men) you always\r\nhad a will by you; but that you had certainly not put anything out of\r\nyour power to change. On that, he began to insinuate, that if I could\r\nprevail on you to settle the estate on him, I might expect anything from\r\nhis gratitude. I made him a very clear and positive answer in these\r\nwords: 'I hope your father will outlive me, and if I should be so\r\nunfortunate to have it otherwise, I do not believe he will leave me in\r\nyour power, But was I sure of the contrary, no interest nor no necessity\r\nshall ever make me act against my honour or conscience; and I plainly\r\ntell you, that I will never persuade your father to do anything for you\r\ntill I think you deserve it.' He answered by great promises of future\r\ngood behaviour, and economy. He is highly delighted with the prospect of\r\ngoing into the army; and mightily pleased with the good reception he had\r\nfrom Lord Stair, though I find it amounts to no more than telling him he\r\nwas sorry he had already named his aides-de-camp, and otherwise should\r\nhave been glad of him in that post. He says Lord Carteret has confirmed\r\nto him his promise of a commission.\r\n\r\n\"The rest of his conversation was extremely gay. The various things he\r\nhas seen has given him a superficial universal knowledge. He really\r\nknows most of the modern languages, and if I could believe him, can read\r\nArabic, and has read the Bible in Hebrew. He said it was impossible for\r\nhim to avoid going back to Paris; but he promised me to lie but one\r\nnight there, and go to a town six posts from thence on the Flanders\r\nroad, where he would wait your orders, and go by the name of Mons. du\r\nDurand, a Dutch officer; under which name I saw him. These are the most\r\nmaterial passages, and my eyes are so much tired I can write no more at\r\nthis time. I gave him 240 livres for his journey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo amount of admonition had any effect upon Edward. At the age of thirty\r\nhe was as irresponsible as he was when he was thirteen years old. He\r\npromised his mother at Avignon most solemnly to reform, and at once got\r\ninto mischief. \"I am persuaded,\" Lady Mary said, \"whoever protects him\r\nwill be very soon convinced of the impossibility of his behaving like a\r\nrational creature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAvignon, November 20, 1743.\r\n\r\n\"As to my son's behaviour at Montelimart, it is nothing more than a\r\nproof of his weakness; and how little he is to be depended on in his\r\nmost solemn professions. He told me that he had made acquaintance with a\r\nlady on the road, who has an assembly at her house at Montelimart, and\r\nthat she had invited him thither. I asked immediately if she knew his\r\nname. He assured me no, and that he passed for a Dutch officer by the\r\nname of Durand. I advised him not go thither, since it would raise a\r\ncuriosity concerning him, and I was very unwilling it should be known\r\nthat I had conversed with him, on many accounts. He gave me the most\r\nsolemn assurances that no mortal should know it; and agreed with me in\r\nthe reasons I gave him for keeping it an entire secret; yet rid straight\r\nto Montelimart, where he told at the assembly that he came into this\r\ncountry purely on my orders, and that I had stayed with him two days at\r\nOrange; talking much of my kindness to him, and insinuating that he had\r\nanother name, much more considerable than that he appeared with. I knew\r\nnothing of this, till several months after, that a lady of that country\r\ncame hither, and meeting her in company, she asked me if I was\r\nacquainted with Monsieur Durand. I had really forgot he had ever taken\r\nthat name, and made answer no; and that if such a person mentioned me,\r\nit was probably some _chevalier d'industrie_ who sought to introduce\r\nhimself into company by a supposed acquaintance with me. She made\r\nanswer, the whole town believed so, by the improbable tales he told\r\nthem; and informed me what he had said; by which I knew what I have\r\nrelated to you.\r\n\r\n\"I expect your orders in relation to his letters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward was still anxious to join the army, and his parents were not\r\naverse to the scheme. Lady Mary, however, thought that certain\r\nprecautions should be taken in the event of his securing a commission.\r\n\"It is my opinion,\" she wrote to Montagu in January, 1744, \"he should\r\nhave no distinction, in equipage, from any other cornet; everything of\r\nthat sort will only serve to blow his vanity and consequently heighten\r\nhis folly. Your indulgence has always been greater to him than any other\r\nparent's would have been in the same circumstances. I have always said\r\nso, and thought so. If anything can alter him, it will be thinking\r\nfirmly that he has no dependence but on his own conduct for a future\r\nmaintenance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward obtained a commission, and was present at Fontenoy.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, in 1747, he was elected to Parliament for the\r\nfamily borough of Huntingdon. This he held until 1754, when he was\r\nreturned for the borough of Bossiney, in Cornwall, which he represented\r\nfor the next eight years.\r\n\r\nOf his subsequent career it is not necessary to say anything here,\r\nexcept that his father left him an annuity of £1,000 a year, to be\r\nincreased to £2,000 on his mother's death. Lady Mary in her will\r\nbequeathed him one guinea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nLADY MARY AS A READER\r\n\r\nHer fondness for reading--Her difficulty to get enough books while\r\nabroad--Lady Bute keeps her supplied--Lady Mary's catholic taste in\r\nliterature--Samuel Richardson--The vogue of _Clarissa Harlowe_--Lady\r\nMary tells a story of the Richardson type--Henry Fielding--_Joseph\r\nAndrews--Tom Jones_--Her high opinion of Fielding and Steele--Tobias\r\nSmollett--_Peregrine Pickle--_Lady Vane's _Memoirs of a Lady of\r\nQuality_--Sarah Fielding--Minor writers--Lord Orrery's _Remarks on\r\nSwift_--Bolingbroke's works--Addison and Pope--Dr. Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her quiet retreat, Lady Mary found plenty of time for books. \"I yet\r\nretain and carefully cherish my taste for reading,\" she wrote to her\r\ndaughter in 1752. \"If relays of eyes were to be hired like post-horses,\r\nI would never admit any but select companions: they afford a constant\r\nvariety of entertainment, and is almost the only one pleasing in the\r\nenjoyment and inoffensive in the consequence.\"\r\n\r\nHer trouble was that she could not get books enough to occupy her time.\r\nShe was always asking Lady Bute to send her some, and was duly grateful\r\nwhen they reached her. \"I fancy you are now saying, 'tis a sad thing to\r\ngrow old; what does my poor mamma mean by troubling me with criticisms\r\non books that nobody but herself will ever read? You must allow\r\nsomething to my solitude.\" And again: \"I thank God my taste still\r\ncontinues for the gay part of reading. Wiser people may call it\r\ntrifling, but it serves to sweeten life to me, and is worst better than\r\nthe generality of conversation.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary's taste in books was catholic. She has seen the \"Memoirs of\r\nher old friend, the Duchess of Maryborough,\" but would be glad of the\r\n_Apology for a late Resignation_ and of Colin Campbell's books on\r\n_Architecture_. She has read Mrs. Lennox's _The Female Quixote_, and\r\nmuch of Sarah Fielding; and she desires Henry Fielding's posthumous\r\nworks, with his _Memoirs of Jonathan Wild_ and _The Journey to the Next\r\nWorld;_ also the _Memoirs of Verocand_, a man of pleasure, and those of\r\na Young Lady. \"You will call all this trash, trumpery, etc.,\" she said\r\nto her daughter. \"I can assure you I was more entertained by G. Edwards\r\nthan H. St. John, of whom you have sent me duplicates. I see new story\r\nbooks with the same pleasure your eldest daughter does a new dress, or\r\nthe youngest a new baby. I thank God, I can find playthings for my age.\r\nI am not of Cowley's mind, that this world is\r\n\r\n  'A dull, ill-acted comedy;'\r\n\r\nnor of Mr. Philips's, that it is\r\n\r\n  'A too well-acted tragedy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I look upon it as a very pretty farce, for those that can see it in\r\nthat light. I confess a severe critic, that would examine by ancient\r\nrules, might find many defects, but 'tis ridiculous to judge seriously\r\nof a puppet-show. Those that can laugh, and be diverted with\r\nabsurdities, are the wisest spectators, be it of writings, actions, or\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently Lady Mary is asking for books the names of which she has seen\r\nin the-newspapers: \"_Fortunate Mistress, Accomplished Rake, Mrs.\r\nCharke's Memoirs, Modern Lovers, History of Two Orphans, Memoirs of\r\nDavid Ranger, Miss Mostyn, Dick Hazard, History of a Lady Platonist,\r\nSophia Shakespear, Jasper Banks, Frank Hammond, Sir Andrew Thompson, Van\r\na Clergyman's Son, Cheantles and Celemena_. I do not doubt at least the\r\ngreater part of these are trash, lumber, etc.; however, they will serve\r\nto pass away the idle time, if you will be so kind as to send them to\r\nyour most affectionate mother.\"\r\n\r\nRichardson Lady Mary liked in spite of herself, as so many others then\r\nand since have done, though it is true that she spoke of the \"very\r\nextraordinary (and I think undeserved) success of Pamela, which, she\r\nsaid, was all the fashion at Paris and Versailles, and is still the joy\r\nof the chambermaids of all nations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was such an old fool as to weep over _Clarissa Harlowe_, like any\r\nmilkmaid of sixteen over the ballad of the _Lady's Fall_\" (she wrote to\r\nher daughter). \"To say truth, the first volume softened me by a near\r\nresemblance of my maiden days; but on the whole 'tis most miserable\r\nstuff. Miss How, who is called a young lady of sense and honour, is not\r\nonly extreme silly, but a more vicious character than Sally Martin,\r\nwhose crimes are owing at first to seduction, and afterwards to\r\nnecessity; while this virtuous damsel, without any reason, insults her\r\nmother at home and ridicules her abroad; abuses the man she marries; and\r\nis impertinent and impudent with great applause. Even that model of\r\naffection, Clarissa, is so faulty in her behaviour as to deserve little\r\ncompassion. Any girl that runs away with a young fellow, without\r\nintending to marry him, should be carried to Bridewell or to Bedlam the\r\nnext day. Yet the circumstances are so laid as to inspire tenderness,\r\nnotwithstanding the low style and absurd incidents; and I look upon this\r\nand _Pamela_ to be two books that will do more general mischief than the\r\nworks of Lord Rochester. There is something humorous in _R. Random_,\r\nthat makes me believe that the author is H. Fielding. I am horribly\r\nafraid I guess too well the writer of those abominable insipidities of\r\n_Cornelia, Leonora_, and the _Ladies' Drawing Room_.\"\r\n\r\n\"This Richardson is a strange fellow,\" she said in another letter. \"I\r\nheartily despise him, and eagerly read him, nay, sob over his works in a\r\nmost scandalous manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have now read over Richardson--he sinks horribly in his third volume\r\n(he does so in his story of _Clarissa_). When he talks of Italy, it is\r\nplain he is no better acquainted with it than he is with the kingdom of\r\nMancomugi. He might have made his Sir Charles's amour with Clementina\r\nbegin in a convent, where the pensioners sometimes take great liberties,\r\nbut that such familiarity should be permitted in her father's house, is\r\nas repugnant to custom, as it would be in London for a young lady of\r\nquality to dance on the ropes at Bartholomew fair: neither does his hero\r\nbehave to her in a manner suitable to his nice notions. It was\r\nimpossible a discerning man should not see her passion early enough to\r\ncheck it, if he had really designed it. His conduct puts me in mind of\r\nsome ladies I have known, who could never find out a man to be in love\r\nwith them, let him do or say what he would, till he made a direct\r\nattempt, and then they were so surprised, I warrant you! Nor do I\r\napprove Sir Charles's offered compromise (as he calls it). There must be\r\na great indifference as to religion on both sides, to make so strict a\r\nunion as marriage tolerable between people of such distinct persuasions.\r\nHe seems to think women have no souls, by agreeing so easily that his\r\ndaughters should be educated in bigotry and idolatry.--You will perhaps\r\nthink this last a hard word; yet it is not difficult to prove, that\r\neither the papists are guilty of idolatry, or the pagans never were so.\r\nYou may see in Lucian (in his vindication of his images), that they did\r\nnot take their statues to be real gods, but only the representations of\r\nthem. The same doctrine may be found in Plutarch; and it is all the\r\nmodern priests have to say in excuse for their worshipping wood and\r\nstone, though they cannot deny, at the same time, that the vulgar are\r\napt to confound that distinction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary frequently re-read Richardson, and not seldom referred to them\r\nin her correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is certain there are as many marriages as ever. Richardson is so\r\neager for the multiplication of them, I suppose he is some parish\r\ncurate, whose chief profit depends on weddings and christenings. He is\r\nnot a man-midwife; for he would be better skilled in physic than to\r\nthink fits and madness any ornament to the characters of his heroines:\r\nthough his Sir Charles had no thoughts of marrying Clementina till she\r\nhad lost her wits, and the divine Clarissa never acted prudently till\r\nshe was in the same condition, and then very wisely desired to be\r\ncarried to Bedlam, which is really all that is to be done in that case.\r\nMadness is as much corporal distemper as the gout or asthma, never\r\noccasioned by affliction, or to be cured by the enjoyment of their\r\nextravagant wishes. Passion may indeed bring on a fit, but the disease\r\nis lodged in the blood, and it is not more ridiculous to attempt to\r\nrelieve the gout by an embroidered slipper, than to restore reason by\r\nthe gratification of wild desires.\r\n\r\n\"Richardson is as ignorant in morality as he is in anatomy, when he\r\ndeclares abusing an obliging husband, or an indulgent parent, to be an\r\ninnocent recreation. His Anna How and Charlotte Grandison are\r\nrecommended as patterns of charming pleasantry, and applauded by his\r\nsaint-like dames, who mistake pert folly for wit and humour, and\r\nimpudence and ill nature for spirit and fire. Charlotte behaves like a\r\nhumorsome child, and should have been used like one, and*** well whipped\r\nin the presence of her friendly confidante Harriet. Lord Halifax very\r\njustly tells his daughter, that a husband's kindness is to be kindly\r\nreceived by a wife, even when he is drunk, and though it is wrapped up\r\nin never so much impertinence. Charlotte acts with an ingratitude that I\r\nthink too black for human nature, with such coarse jokes and low\r\nexpressions as are only to be heard among the lowest class of people.\r\nWomen of that rank often plead a right to beat their husbands, when they\r\ndon't cuckold them; and I believe this author was never admitted into\r\nhigher company, and should confine his pen to the amours of housemaids,\r\nand the conversation at the steward's table, where I imagine he has\r\nsometimes intruded, though oftener in the servants hall: yet, if the\r\ntitle be not a puff, this work has passed three editions. I do not\r\nforgive him his disrespect of old china, which is below nobody's taste,\r\nsince it has been the D. of Argyll's, whose understanding has never been\r\ndoubted either by his friends or enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Richardson never had probably money enough to purchase any, or even a\r\nticket for a masquerade, which gives him such an aversion to them;\r\nthough his intended satire against them is very absurd on the account of\r\nhis Harriet, since she might have been carried off in the same manner if\r\nshe had been going from supper with her grandmamma. Her whole behaviour,\r\nwhich he designs to be exemplary, is equally blamable and ridiculous.\r\nShe follows the maxim of Clarissa, of declaring all she thinks to all\r\nthe people she sees, without reflecting that in this mortal state of\r\nimperfection, fig-leaves are as necessary for our minds as our bodies,\r\nand 'tis as indecent to show all we think, as all we have. He has no\r\nidea of the manners of high life: his old Lord M. talks in the style of\r\na country justice, and his virtuous young ladies romp like the wenches\r\nround a maypole. Such liberties as pass between Mr. Lovelace and his\r\ncousins, are not to be excused by the relation. I should have been much\r\nastonished if Lord Denbigh should have offered to kiss me; and I dare\r\nswear Lord Trentham never attempted such an impertinence to you.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary was in sore trouble about Richardson. She would not like him,\r\nshe was angry with him, yet could never away with him. When she heard of\r\nan adventure at Lovere, she, who herself had a gift for novel-writing,\r\nmust needs send an account of it to Lady Bute, saying that it exactly\r\nresembled and, she believed, was copied from _Pamela_. \"I know not under\r\nwhat constellation that foolish stuff was wrote, but it has been\r\ntranslated into more languages than any modern performance I ever heard\r\nof,\" she added. \"No proof of its influence was ever stronger than this\r\nstory, which in Richardson's hands would serve very well to furnish out\r\nseven or eight volumes: I shall make it as short as I can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an example of Lady Mary's skill in narrative, her account of the\r\nRichardsonian adventure is well worth reprinting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Here is a gentleman's family, consisting of an old bachelor and his\r\nsister, who have fortune enough to live with great elegance, though\r\nwithout any magnificence, possessed of the esteem of all their\r\nacquaintance, he being distinguished by his probity, and she by her\r\nvirtue. They are not only suffered but sought by all the best company,\r\nand indeed are the most conversable, reasonable people in the place. She\r\nis an excellent housewife, and particularly remarkable for keeping her\r\npretty house as neat as any in Holland. She appears no longer in public,\r\nbeing past fifty, and passes her time chiefly at home with her work,\r\nreceiving few visitants. This Signora Diana, about ten years since, saw,\r\nat a monastery, a girl about eight years old, who came thither to beg\r\nalms for her mother. Her beauty, though covered with rags, was very\r\nobservable, and gave great compassion to the charitable lady, who\r\nthought it meritorious to rescue such a modest sweetness as appeared in\r\nher face from the ruin to which her wretched circumstances exposed her.\r\nShe asked her some questions, to which she answered with a natural\r\ncivility that seemed surprising; and finding the head of her family (her\r\nbrother) to be a cobbler, who could hardly live by that trade, and her\r\nmother too old to work for her maintenance, she bid the child follow her\r\nhome; and sending for her parent, proposed to her to breed the little\r\nOctavia for her servant. This was joyfully accepted, the old woman\r\ndismissed with a piece of money, and the girl remained with the Signora\r\nDiana, who bought her decent clothes, and took pleasure in teaching her\r\nwhatever she was capable of learning. She learned to read, write, and\r\ncast accounts, with uncommon facility; and had such a genius for work,\r\nthat she excelled her mistress in embroidery, point, and every operation\r\nof the needle. She grew perfectly skilled in confectionary, had a good\r\ninsight into cookery, and was a great proficient in distillery. To these\r\naccomplishments she was so handy, well bred, humble and modest, that not\r\nonly her master and mistress, but everybody that frequented the house,\r\ntook notice of her. She lived thus near nine years, never going out but\r\nto church. However, beauty is as difficult to conceal as light; hers\r\nbegan to make a great noise. Signora Diana told me she observed an\r\nunusual concourse of pedling women that came on pretext to sell\r\npenn'orths of lace, china, etc., and several young gentlemen, very well\r\npowdered, that were perpetually walking before her door, and looking up\r\nat the windows. These prognostics alarmed her prudence, and she listened\r\nvery willingly to some honourable proposals that were made by many\r\nhonest, thriving tradesmen. She communicated them to Octavia, and told\r\nher, that though she was sorry to lose so good a servant, yet she\r\nthought it right to advise her to choose a husband. The girl answered\r\nmodestly, that it was her duty to obey all her commands, but she found\r\nno inclination to marriage; and if she would permit her to live single,\r\nshe should think it a greater obligation than any other she could\r\nbestow. Signora Diana was too conscientious to force her into a state\r\nfrom which she could not free her, and left her to her own disposal.\r\nHowever, they parted soon after; whether (as the neighbours say) Signor\r\nAurelio Ardinghi, her brother, looked with too much attention on the\r\nyoung woman, or that she herself (as Diana says) desired to seek a place\r\nof more profit, she removed to Bergamo, where she soon found preferment,\r\nbeing strongly recommended by the Ardinghi family. She was advanced to\r\nbe first waiting-woman to an old countess, who was so well pleased with\r\nher service, she desired, on her death bed, Count Jeronimo Sosi, her\r\nson, to be kind to her. He found no repugnance to this act of obedience,\r\nhaving distinguished the beautiful Octavia from his first sight of her;\r\nand, during the six months that she had served in the house, had tried\r\nevery art of a fine gentleman, accustomed to victories of that sort, to\r\nvanquish the virtue of this fair virgin. He has a handsome figure, and\r\nhas had an education uncommon in this country, having made the tour of\r\nEurope, and brought from Paris all the improvements that are to be picked\r\nup there, being celebrated for his grace in dancing, and skill in\r\nfencing and riding, by which he is a favourite among the ladies, and\r\nrespected by the men. Thus qualified for conquest, you may judge of his\r\nsurprise at the firm yet modest resistance of this country girl, who was\r\nneither to be moved by address, nor gained by liberality, nor on any\r\nterms would be prevailed on to stay as his housekeeper, after the death\r\nof his mother. She took that post in the house of an old judge, where\r\nshe continued to be solicited by the emissaries of the count's passion,\r\nand found a new persecutor in her master, who, after three months'\r\nendeavour to corrupt her, offered her marriage. She chose to return to\r\nher former obscurity, and escaped from his pursuit, without asking any\r\nwages, and privately returned to the Signora Diana. She threw herself at\r\nher feet, and, kissing her hands, begged her, with tears, to conceal her\r\nat least some time, if she would not accept of her service. She\r\nprotested she had never been happy since she left it. While she was\r\nmaking these submissions, Signor Aurelio entered. She entreated his\r\nintercession on her knees, who was easily persuaded to consent she\r\nshould stay with them, though his sister blamed her highly for her\r\nprecipitate flight, having no reason, from the age and character of her\r\nmaster, to fear any violence, and wondered at her declining the honour\r\nhe offered her. Octavia confessed that perhaps she had been too rash in\r\nher proceedings, but said, that he seemed to resent her refusal in such\r\na manner as frighted her; she hoped that after a few days' search he\r\nwould think no more of her; and that she scrupled entering into the holy\r\nbands of matrimony, where her heart did not sincerely accompany all the\r\nwords of the ceremony. Signora Diana had nothing to say in contradiction\r\nto this pious sentiment; and her brother applauded the honesty which\r\ncould not be perverted by any interest whatever. She remained concealed\r\nin their house, where she helped in the kitchen, cleaned the rooms, and\r\nredoubled her usual diligence and officiousness. Her old master came to\r\nLovere on pretence of adjusting a lawsuit, three days after, and made\r\nprivate inquiry after her; but hearing from her mother and brother (who\r\nknew nothing of her being here) that they had never heard of her, he\r\nconcluded she had taken another route, and returned to Bergamo; and she\r\ncontinued in this retirement near a fortnight.\r\n\r\n\"Last Sunday, as soon as the day was closed, arrived at Signer Aurelio's\r\ndoor a handsome equipage in a large bark, attended by four well-armed\r\nservants on horseback. An old priest stepped out of it, and desiring to\r\nspeak with Signora Diana, informed her he came from the Count Jeronimo\r\nSosi to demand Octavia; that the count waited for her at a village four\r\nmiles from hence, where he intended to marry her; and had sent him, who\r\nwas engaged to perform the divine rite, that Signora Diana might resign\r\nher to his care without any difficulty. The young damsel was called for,\r\nwho entreated she might be permitted the company of another priest with\r\nwhom she was acquainted: this was readily granted; and she sent for a\r\nyoung man that visits me very often, being remarkable for his sobriety\r\nand learning. Meanwhile, a valet-de-chambre presented her with a box, in\r\nwhich was a complete genteel undress for a lady. Her laced linen and\r\nfine nightgown were soon put on, and away they marched, leaving the\r\nfamily in a surprise not to be described.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Aurelio came to drink coffee with me next morning: his first\r\nwords were, he had brought me the history of Pamela. I said, laughing, I\r\nhad been tired with it long since. He explained himself by relating this\r\nstory, mixed with great resentment for Octavia's conduct. Count\r\nJeronimo's father had been his ancient friend and patron; and this\r\nescape from his house (he said) would lay him under a suspicion of\r\nhaving abetted the young man's folly, and perhaps expose him to the\r\nanger of all his relations, for contriving an action he would rather\r\nhave died than suffered, if he had known how to prevent it. I easily\r\nbelieved him, there appearing a latent jealousy under his affliction,\r\nthat showed me he envied the bridegroom's happiness, at the same time he\r\ncondemned his extravagance.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday noon, being Saturday, Don Joseph returned, who has got the\r\nname of Parson Williams by this expedition: he relates, that when the\r\nbark which carried the coach and train arrived, they found the amorous\r\ncount waiting for his bride on the bank of the lake: he would have\r\nproceeded immediately to the church; but she utterly refused it, till\r\nthey had each of them been at confession; after which the happy knot was\r\ntied by the parish priest. They continued their journey, and came to\r\ntheir palace at Bergamo in a few hours, where everything was prepared\r\nfor their reception. They received the communion next morning, and the\r\ncount declares that the lovely Octavia has brought him an inestimable\r\nportion, since he owes to her the salvation of his soul. He has\r\nrenounced play, at which he had lost a great deal of time and money. She\r\nhas already retrenched several superfluous servants, and put his family\r\ninto an exact method of economy, preserving all the splendour necessary\r\nto his rank. He has sent a letter in his own hand to her mother,\r\ninviting her to reside with them, and subscribing himself her dutiful\r\nson: but the countess has sent another privately by Don Joseph, in which\r\nshe advises the old woman to stay at Lovere, promising to take care she\r\nshall want nothing, accompanied with a token of twenty sequins, which is\r\nat least nineteen more than ever she saw in her life.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to tell you that from Octavia's first serving the old lady,\r\nthere came frequent charities in her name to her poor parent, which\r\nnobody was surprised at, the lady being celebrated for pious works, and\r\nOctavia known to be a great favourite with her. It is now discovered\r\nthat they were all sent by the generous lover, who has presented Don\r\nJoseph very handsomely, but he has brought neither letter nor message to\r\nthe house of Ardinghi, which affords much speculation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary followed this narrative with her reflections. She was sure\r\nthat all these adventures proceeded from artifice on one side and\r\nweakness on the other. \"An honest, tender mind,\" she says, \"is betrayed\r\nto ruin by the charms that make the fortune of a designing head, which,\r\nwhen joined with a beautiful face, can never fail of advancement, except\r\nbarred by a wise mother, who locks up her daughters from view till\r\nnobody cares to look on them.\" She instanced the case of \"my poor\r\nfriend\" the Duchess of Bolton, who \"was educated in solitude, with some\r\nchoice books, by a saint-like governess: crammed with virtue and good\r\nqualities, she thought it impossible not to find gratitude, though she\r\nfailed to give passion; and upon this plan threw away her estate, was\r\ndespised by her husband, and laughed at by the public.\" Lady Mary\r\ncompared the case of the Duchess with that of \"Polly, bred in an\r\nale-house, and produced on the stage, who has obtained wealth and title,\r\nand found the way to be esteemed.\" This particular instance hardly\r\nfurnishes the basis for the general rule laid down by her: \"So useful is\r\nearly experience--without it half of life is dissipated in correcting\r\nthe errors that we have been taught to receive as indisputable truths.\"\r\nAccording to all accounts Charles Paulet, third Duke of Bolton, was at\r\nthe age of twenty-eight forced by his father to marry Lady Anne Vaughan,\r\nonly daughter and heiress of John, Earl of Carbery. When the old Duke\r\ndied in 1722 they separated. Some years later the Duke took for his\r\nmistress Lavinia Fenton, the \"Polly\" in Gay's \"Beggar's Opera.\" On the\r\ndeath of his wife in 1751 he married her.\r\n\r\nHenry Fielding, was Lady Mary's second cousin; but there had never been\r\nany intimacy between them, although some acquaintance. The novelist was\r\neighteen years the younger. In 1727, when he was twenty and near the\r\nbeginning of his career as a playwright, he had consulted her about his\r\ncomedy, \"Love in Several Masques,\" of which, when it was published in\r\nthe following year, he sent her a copy. \"I have presumed to send your\r\nLadyship a copy of the play which you did me the honour of reading three\r\nacts last spring and hope it may meet as light a censure from your\r\nLadyship's judgment as then; for while your goodness permits me (what I\r\nesteem the greatest and indeed only happening of my life) to offer my\r\nunworthy performances to your perusal, it will be entirely from your\r\nsentence that they will be regarded or disesteemed by me.\" Fielding\r\nwrote Lady Mary another letter about four years later: \"I hope your\r\nLadyship will honour the scenes which I presume to lay before you, with\r\nyour perusal. As they are written on a model I never yet attempted, I am\r\nexceedingly anxious less they should find less mercy from you than my\r\nlighter productions. It will be a slight compensation to 'The Modern\r\nHusband' that your Ladyship's censure will defend him from the\r\npossibility of any other reproof, since your least approbation will\r\nalways give me pleasure, infinitely superior to the loudest applauses of\r\na theatre. For whatever has passed your judgment may, I think, without\r\nany imputation of immodesty, refer want of success to want of judgment\r\nin an audience. I shall do myself the honour of waiting upon your\r\nLadyship at Twickenham to receive my sentence.\"\r\n\r\nOne evening when she arrived home, after having ridden twenty miles in\r\nthe moonlight, she found a box of books, and pouncing upon her cousin\r\nFielding's works, sat up all night reading.\r\n\r\n\"I think _Joseph Andrews_ better than his _Foundling._[13] I believe I\r\nwas the more struck with it, having at present a Fanny in my own house,\r\nnot only by the name, which happens to be the same, but the\r\nextraordinary beauty, joined with an understanding yet more\r\nextraordinary at her age, which is but few months past sixteen: she is\r\nin the post of my chambermaid. I fancy you will tax my discretion for\r\ntaking a servant thus qualified; but my woman, who is also my\r\nhousekeeper, was always teasing me with her having too much work, and\r\ncomplaining of ill-health, which determined me to take her a deputy; and\r\nwhen I was at Lovere, where I drank the waters, one of the most\r\nconsiderable merchants there pressed me to take this daughter of his:\r\nher mother has an uncommon good character, and the girl has had a\r\nbetter education than is usual for those of her rank; she writes a good\r\nhand, and has been brought up to keep accounts, which she does to great\r\nperfection; and had herself such a violent desire to serve me, that I\r\nwas persuaded to take her: I do not yet repent it from any part of her\r\nbehaviour. But there has been no peace in the family ever since she came\r\ninto it; I might say the parish, all the women in it having declared\r\nopen war with her, and the men endeavouring at treaties of a different\r\nsort: my own woman puts herself at the head of the first party, and her\r\nspleen is increased by having no reason for it, the young creature never\r\nstirring from my apartment, always at needle, and never complaining of\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLater Lady Mary has more to say about Fielding's books:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"H. Fielding has given a true picture of himself and his first wife, in\r\nthe characters of Mr. and Mrs. Booth, some compliments to his own figure\r\nexcepted; and, I am persuaded, several of the incidents he mentions are\r\nreal matters of fact. I wonder he does not perceive Tom Jones and Mr.\r\nBooth are sorry scoundrels. All these sort of books have the same fault,\r\nwhich I cannot easily pardon, being very mischievous. They place a merit\r\nin extravagant passions, and encourage young people to hope for\r\nimpossible events, to draw them out of the misery they chose to plunge\r\nthemselves into, expecting legacies from unknown relations, and generous\r\nbenefactors to distressed virtue, as much out of nature as fairy\r\ntreasures. Fielding has really a fund of true humour, and was to be\r\npitied at his first entrance into the world, having no choice, as he\r\nsaid himself, but to be a hackney writer, or a hackney coachman. His\r\ngenius deserved a better fate; but I cannot help blaming that continued\r\nindiscretion, to give it the softest name, that has run through his\r\nlife, and I am afraid still remains. I guessed _Random_ to be his though\r\nwithout his name. I cannot think _Ferdinand Count Fathom_ wrote by the\r\nsame hand, it is every way so much below it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAdventures of Roderick Random_ (1748) and _The Adventures of Ferdinand\r\nCount Fathom_ (1753) were published anonymously. Lady Mary was not the\r\nonly one to attribute _Roderick Random_ to Fielding, and it was actually\r\ntranslated into French in his name.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Mary heard of Fielding's death, she expressed deep regret:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry for H. Fielding's death, not only as I shall read no more of\r\nhis writings, but I believe he lost more than others, as no man enjoyed\r\nlife more than he did, though few had less reason to do so, the highest\r\nof his preferment being raking in the lowest sinks of vice and misery. I\r\nshould think it a nobler and less nauseous employment to be one of the\r\nstaff-officers that conduct the nocturnal weddings. His happy\r\nconstitution (even when he had, with great pains, half demolished it)\r\nmade him forget everything when he was before a venison pasty, or over a\r\nflask of champagne; and I am persuaded he has known more happy moments\r\nthan any prince upon earth. His natural spirits gave him rapture with\r\nhis cook-maid, and cheerfulness when he was fluxing in a garret. There\r\nwas a great similitude between his character and that of Sir Richard\r\nSteele. He had the advantage both in learning and, in my opinion,\r\ngenius: they both agreed in wanting money in spite of all their friends,\r\nand would have wanted it, if their hereditary lands had been as\r\nextensive as their imagination; yet each of them was so formed for\r\nhappiness; it is a pity he was not immortal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting of imaginative prose literature generally, Lady Mary wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The general want of invention which reigns among our writers, inclines\r\nme to think it is not the natural growth of our island, which has not\r\nsun enough to warm the imagination. The press is loaded by the servile\r\nflock of imitators. Lord B. [Bolingbroke] would have quoted Horace in\r\nthis place. Since I was born, no original has appeared excepting\r\nCongreve and Fielding, who would, I believe, have approached nearer to\r\nhis excellences, if not forced by necessity to publish without\r\ncorrection, and throw many productions into the world he would have\r\nthrown into the fire if meat could have been got without money, or money\r\nwithout scribbling. The greatest virtue, justice, and the most\r\ndistinguishing prerogative of mankind, writing, when duly executed, do\r\nhonour to human nature; but when degenerated into trades, are the most\r\ncontemptible ways of getting bread. I am sorry not to see any more of\r\nPeregrine Pickle's performances: I wish you would tell me his name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears strange that Lady Mary should have been ignorant, when she\r\nwrote the above passage in July or August, 1755, of the authorship of\r\n_Roderick Random_, for in January of that year she had evinced an\r\ninterest in Smollett: \"I am sorry my friend Smollett loses his time in\r\ntranslations; he has certainly a talent for invention, though I think it\r\nflags a little in his last work. _Don Quixote_ is a difficult\r\nundertaking: I shall never desire to read any attempt to redress him.\r\nThough I am a mere piddler in the Spanish language, I had rather take\r\npains to understand him in the original than sleep over a stupid\r\ntranslation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peregrine Pickle_, however, Lady Mary had read shortly after its\r\nappearance in 1751:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I began by your direction with _Peregrine Pickle_. I think Lady Vane's\r\n_Memoirs_[14] contain more truth and less malice than any I ever read in\r\nmy life. When she speaks of her own being disinterested, I am apt to\r\nbelieve she really thinks herself so, as many highwaymen, after having\r\nno possibility of retrieving the character of honesty, please themselves\r\nwith that of being generous, because, whatever they get on the road,\r\nthey always spend at the next ale-house, and are still as beggarly as\r\never. Her history, rightly considered, would be more instructive to\r\nyoung women than any sermon I know. They may see there what\r\nmortifications and variety of misery are the unavoidable consequences of\r\ngallantries. I think there is no rational creature that would not prefer\r\nthe life of the strictest Carmelite to the round of hurry and misfortune\r\nshe has gone through. Her style is clear and concise, with some strokes\r\nof humour, which appear to me so much above her, I can't help being of\r\nopinion the whole has been modelled by the author of the book in which\r\nit is inserted, who is some subaltern admirer of hers. I may judge\r\nwrong, she being no acquaintance of mine, though she has married two of\r\nmy relations. Her first wedding was attended with circumstances that\r\nmade me think a visit not at all necessary, though I disobliged Lady\r\nSusan by neglecting it; and the second, which happened soon after, made\r\nher so near a neighbour, that I rather choose to stay the whole summer\r\nin town than partake of her balls and parties of pleasure, to which I\r\ndid not think it proper to introduce you; and had no other way of\r\navoiding it, without incurring the censure of a most unnatural mother\r\nfor denying you diversions that the pious Lady Ferrers permitted to her\r\nexemplary daughters. Mr. Shirley has had uncommon fortune in making the\r\nconquest of two such extraordinary ladies, equal in their heroic\r\ncontempt of shame, and eminent above their sex, the one for beauty, and\r\nthe other wealth, both which attract the pursuit of all mankind, and\r\nhave been thrown into his arms with the same unlimited fondness. He\r\nappeared to me gentile [_sic_], well bred, well shaped and sensible; but\r\nthe charms of his face and eyes, which Lady Vane describes with so much\r\nwarmth, were, I confess, always invisible to me, and the artificial part\r\nof his character very glaring, which I think her story shows in a strong\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Frances Anne Hawes (1713-1788) married Lord William\r\nDouglas in 1731, and after his death, William, second Viscount Vane, in\r\n1735. She was notorious for profligacy and extravagance of all kinds.\r\nShe was responsible for the scandalous _Memoirs of a Lady of Quality_\r\nwhich she paid Smollett to insert in _Peregrine Pickle_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf minor novelists Lady Mary had also something to say from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sally [Fielding] has mended her style in her last volume of _David\r\nSimple_, which conveys a useful moral, though she does not seem to have\r\nintended it: I mean, shows the ill consequences of not providing against\r\ncasual losses, which happen to almost everybody. Mrs. Orgueil's\r\ncharacter is well drawn, and is frequently to be met with. The _Art of\r\nTormenting_, the _Female Quixote_[15] and _Sir C. Goodville_ are all\r\nsale work. I suppose they proceed from her pen, and heartily pity her,\r\nconstrained by her circumstances to seek her bread by a method, I do not\r\ndoubt, she despises. Tell me who is that accomplished countess she\r\ncelebrates. I left no such person in London; nor can I imagine who is\r\nmeant by the English Sappho mentioned in Betsy Thoughtless, whose\r\nadventures and those of Jenny Jessamy, gave me some amusement.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: By Charlotte Lennox.]\r\n\r\n\"I have read _The Cry_[16] and if I would write in the style to be\r\nadmired by good Lord Orrery, I would tell you _The Cry_ made me ready to\r\ncry, and the _Art of Tormenting_ tormented me very much. I take them to\r\nbe Sally Fielding's, and also the _Female Quixote_; the plan of that is\r\npretty, but ill executed: on the contrary, the fable of _The Cry_ is the\r\nmost absurd I ever saw, but the sentiments generally just; and I think,\r\nif well dressed, would make a better body of ethics than Bolingbroke's.\r\nHer inventing new words, that are neither more harmonious or significant\r\nthan those already in use, is intolerable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: By Sarah Fielding and Miss Collier.]\r\n\r\n\"The next book I laid my hand on was _The Parish Girl_ which interested\r\nme enough not to be able to quit it till it was read over, though the\r\nauthor has fallen into the common mistake of romance-writers; intending\r\na virtuous character, and not knowing how to draw it; the first step of\r\nhis heroine (leaving her patroness's house) being altogether absurd and\r\nridiculous, justly entitling her to all the misfortunes she met with.\r\n\r\n\"Candles came (and my eyes grown weary), I took up the next book, merely\r\nbecause I supposed from the title it could not engage me long. It was\r\n_Pompey the Little_,[17] which has really diverted me more than any of\r\nthe others, and it was impossible to go to bed till it was finished. It\r\nwas a real and exact representation of life, as it is now acted in\r\nLondon, as it was in my time, and as it will be (I do not doubt) a\r\nhundred years hence, with some little variation of dress, and perhaps\r\ngovernment. I found there many of my acquaintance. Lady T. and Lady O.\r\nare so well painted, I fancied I heard them talk, and have heard them\r\nsay the very things there repeated....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: By Francis Coventry.]\r\n\r\n\"I opened my eyes this morning on _Leonora_, from which I defy the\r\ngreatest chemist in morals to extract any instruction; the style most\r\naffectedly florid, and naturally insipid, with such a confused heap of\r\nadmirable characters, that never were, or can be, in human nature. I\r\nflung it aside after fifty pages, and laid hold of _Mrs. Philips_, where\r\nI expected to find at least probable, if not true facts, and was not\r\ndisappointed. There is a great similitude in the genius and adventures\r\n(the one being productive of the other) between Madame Constantia and\r\nLady Vane: the first mentioned has the advantage in birth and, if I am\r\nnot mistaken, in understanding: they have both had scandalous lawsuits\r\nwith their husbands, and are endowed with the same intrepid assurance.\r\nCon. seems to value herself also on her generosity, and has given the\r\nsame proofs of it. The parallel might be drawn out to be as long as any\r\nof Plutarch's; but I dare swear you are already heartily weary of my\r\nremarks, and wish I had not read so much in so short a time, that you\r\nmight not be troubled with my comments; but you must suffer me to say\r\nsomething of the polite Mr. Ste, whose name I should never have guessed\r\nby the rapturous description his mistress makes of his person, having\r\nalways looked upon him as one of the most disagreeable fellows about\r\ntown, as odious in his outside as stupid in his conversation, and I\r\nshould as soon have expected to hear of his conquests at the head of an\r\narmy as among women; yet he has been, it seems, the darling favourite of\r\nthe most experienced of the sex, which shows me I am a very bad judge of\r\nmerit. But I agree with Mrs. Philips, that, however profligate she may\r\nhave been, she is infinitely his superior in virtue; and if her\r\npenitence is as sincere as she says, she may expect their future fate to\r\nbe like that of Dives and Lazarus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary received from her daughter a copy of Lord Orrery's _Remarks on\r\nthe Life and Writings of Jonathan Swift_, published in 1751, six years\r\nafter the death of Swift. This book so aroused the ire of Lady Mary\r\nthat, writing of it, she attacked everyone concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lord Orrery's work has extremely entertained, and not at all surprised\r\nme, having the honour of being acquainted with him, and knowing him for\r\none of those danglers after wit, who, like those after beauty, spend\r\ntheir time in humbly admiring, and are happy in being permitted to\r\nattend, though they are laughed at, and only encouraged to gratify the\r\ninsatiate vanity of those professed wits and beauties who aim at being\r\npublicly distinguished in those characters. Dean Swift, by his\r\nlordship's own account, was so intoxicated with the love of flattery, he\r\nsought it amongst the lowest of the people, and the silliest of women;\r\nand was never so well pleased with any companions as those that\r\nworshipped him while he insulted them. It is a wonderful condescension\r\nin a man of quality to offer his incense in such a crowd, and think it\r\nan honour to share a friendship with Sheridan, &c., especially being\r\nhimself endowed with such universal merit as he displays in these\r\nLetters, where he shows that he is a poet, a patriot, a philosopher, a\r\nphysician, a critic, a complete scholar, and most excellent moralist;\r\nshining in private life as a submissive son, a tender father, and\r\nzealous friend. His only error has been that love of learned ease which\r\nhe has indulged in a solitude, which has prevented the world from being\r\nblest with such a general, minister, or admiral, being equal to any of\r\nthese employments, if he would have turned his talents to the use of the\r\npublic. Heaven be praised, he has now drawn his pen in its service, and\r\ngiven an example to mankind that the most villanous actions, nay, the\r\ncoarsest nonsense, are only small blemishes in a great genius. I happen\r\nto think quite contrary, weak woman as I am. I have always avoided the\r\nconversation of those who endeavour to raise an opinion of their\r\nunderstanding by ridiculing what both law and decency obliges them to\r\nrevere; but, whenever I have met with any of those bright spirits who\r\nwould be smart on sacred subjects, I have ever cut short their discourse\r\nby asking them if they had any lights and revelations by which they\r\nwould propose new articles of faith? Nobody can deny but religion is a\r\ncomfort to the distressed, a cordial to the sick, and sometimes a\r\nrestraint on the wicked; therefore, whoever would argue or laugh it out\r\nof the world, without giving some equivalent for it, ought to be treated\r\nas a common enemy: but, when this language comes from a churchman, who\r\nenjoys large benefices and dignities from that very Church he openly\r\ndespises, it is an object of horror for which I want a name, and can\r\nonly be excused by madness, which I think the Dean was strongly touched\r\nwith. His character seems to me a parallel with that of Caligula; and\r\nhad he had the same power would have made the same use of it. That\r\nemperor erected a temple to himself, where he was his own high priest,\r\npreferred his horse to the highest honours in the state, professed\r\nenmity to [the] human race, and at last lost his life by a nasty jest on\r\none of his inferiors, which I dare swear Swift would have made in his\r\nplace. There can be no worse picture made of the Doctor's morals than he\r\nhas given us himself in the letters printed by Pope. We see him vain,\r\ntrifling, ungrateful to the memory of his patron, the Earl of Oxford,\r\nmaking a servile court where he had any interested views, and meanly\r\nabusive when they were disappointed, and, as he says (in his own\r\nphrase), flying in the face of mankind, in company with his adorer Pope.\r\nIt is pleasant to consider, that, had it not been for the good nature\r\nof these very mortals they contemn, these two superior beings were\r\nentitled, by their birth and hereditary fortune, to be only a couple of\r\nlink-boys. I am of opinion their friendship would have continued, though\r\nthey had remained in the same kingdom: it had a very strong\r\nfoundation--the love of flattery on the one side, and the love of money\r\non the other. Pope courted with the utmost assiduity all the old men\r\nfrom whom he could hope a legacy, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord\r\nPeterborough, Sir G. Kneller, Lord Bolingbroke, Mr. Wycherley, Mr.\r\nCongreve, Lord Harcourt, &c., and I do not doubt projected to sweep the\r\nDean's whole inheritance, if he could have persuaded him to throw up his\r\ndeanery, and come to die in his house; and his general preaching against\r\nmoney was meant to induce people to throw it away, that he might pick it\r\nup. There cannot be a stronger proof of his being capable of any action\r\nfor the sake of gain than publishing his literary correspondence, which\r\nlays open such a mixture of dulness and iniquity, that one would imagine\r\nit visible even to his most passionate admirers, if Lord Orrery did not\r\nshow that smooth lines have as much influence over some people as the\r\nauthority of the Church in these countries, where it cannot only veil,\r\nbut sanctify any absurdity or villany whatever. It is remarkable that\r\nhis lordship's family have been smatterers in wit and learning for three\r\ngenerations: his grandfather has left monuments of his good taste in\r\nseveral rhyming tragedies, and the romance of Parthenissa. His father\r\nbegan the world by giving his name to a treatise wrote by Atterbury and\r\nhis club, which gained him great reputation; but (like Sir Martin\r\nMarall, who would fumble with his lute when the music was over) he\r\npublished soon after a sad comedy of his own, and, what was worse, a\r\ndismal tragedy he had found among the first Earl of Orrery's papers.\r\nPeople could easier forgive his being partial to his own silly works, as\r\na common frailty, than the want of judgment in producing a piece that\r\ndishonoured his father's memory.\r\n\r\n\"Thus fell into dust a fame that had made a blaze by borrowed fire. To\r\ndo justice to the present lord, I do not doubt this fine performance is\r\nall his own, and is a public benefit, if every reader has been as well\r\ndiverted with it as myself. I verily believe it has contributed to the\r\nestablishment of my health.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was Lady Mary more kindly about the writings and character of Lord\r\nBolingbroke, for whom she had always had a feeling even more of hatred\r\nthan disapproval.\r\n\r\n\"I have now read over the books you were so good to send, and intend to\r\nsay something of them all, though some are not worth speaking of\" (she\r\nwrote to her daughter). \"I shall begin, in respect to his dignity, with\r\nLord Bolingbroke, who is a glaring proof how far vanity can blind a man,\r\nand how easy it is to varnish over to one's self the most criminal\r\nconduct. He declares he always loved his country, though he confesses he\r\nendeavoured to betray her to popery and slavery; and loved his friends,\r\nthough he abandoned them in distress, with all the blackest\r\ncircumstances of treachery. His account of the Peace of Utrecht is\r\nalmost equally unfair or partial: I shall allow that, perhaps, the views\r\nof the Whigs, at that time, were too vast and the nation, dazzled by\r\nmilitary glory, had hopes too sanguine; but sure the same terms that the\r\nFrench consented to, at the treaty of Gertruydenberg, might have been\r\nobtained; or if the displacing of the Duke of Marlborough raised the\r\nspirits of our enemies to a degree of refusing what they had before\r\noffered, how can he excuse the guilt of removing him from the head of a\r\nvictorious army, and exposing us to submit to any articles of peace,\r\nbeing unable to continue the war? I agree with him, that the idea of\r\nconquering France is a wild, extravagant notion, and would, if possible,\r\nbe impolitic; but she might have been reduced to such a state as would\r\nhave rendered her incapable of being terrible to her neighbours for some\r\nages: nor should we have been obliged, as we have done almost ever\r\nsince, to bribe the French ministers to let us live in quiet. So much\r\nfor his political reasonings, which, I confess, are delivered in a\r\nflorid, easy style; but I cannot be of Lord Orrery's opinion, that he is\r\none of the best English writers. Well-turned periods or smooth lines are\r\nnot the perfection either of prose or verse; they may serve to adorn,\r\nbut can never stand in the place of good sense. Copiousness of words,\r\nhowever ranged, is always false eloquence, though it will ever impose on\r\nsome sort of understandings. How many readers and admirers has Madame de\r\nSévigné, who only gives us, in a lively manner and fashionable phrases,\r\nmean sentiments, vulgar prejudices, and endless repetitions? Sometimes\r\nthe tittle-tattle of a fine lady, sometimes that of an old nurse, always\r\ntittle-tattle; yet so well gilt over by airy expressions, and a flowing\r\nstyle, she will always please the same people to whom Lord Bolingbroke\r\nwill shine as a first-rate author. She is so far to be excused, as her\r\nletters were not intended for the press; while her labours to display to\r\nposterity all the wit and learning he is master of, and sometimes spoils\r\na good argument by a profusion of words, running out into several pages\r\na thought that might have been more clearly expressed in a few lines,\r\nand, what is worse, often falls into contradiction and repetitions,\r\nwhich are almost unavoidable to all voluminous writers, and can only be\r\nforgiven to those retailers whose necessity compels them to diurnal\r\nscribbling, who load their meaning with epithets, and run into\r\ndigressions, because (in the jockey phrase) it rids the ground, that is,\r\ncovers a certain quantity of paper, to answer the demand of the day. A\r\ngreat part of Lord B.'s letters are designed to show his reading, which,\r\nindeed, appears to have been very extensive; but I cannot perceive that\r\nsuch a minute account of it can be of any use to the pupil he pretends\r\nto instruct; nor can I help thinking he is far below either Tillotson or\r\nAddison, even in style, though the latter was sometimes more diffuse\r\nthan his judgment approved, to furnish out the length of a daily\r\n_Spectator_. I own I have small regard for Lord B. as an author, and the\r\nhighest contempt for him as a man. He came into the world greatly\r\nfavoured both by nature and fortune, blest with a noble birth, heir to\r\na large estate, endowed with a strong constitution, and, as I have\r\nheard, a beautiful figure, high spirits, a good memory and a lively\r\napprehension, which was cultivated by a learned education: all these\r\nglorious advantages being left to the direction of a judgment stifled by\r\nunbounded vanity, he dishonoured his birth, lost his estate, ruined his\r\nreputation, and destroyed his health, by a wild pursuit of eminence even\r\nin vice and trifles.\r\n\r\n\"I am far from making misfortune a matter of reproach. I know there are\r\naccidental occurences not to be foreseen or avoided by human prudence,\r\nby which a character may be injured, wealth dissipated, or a\r\nconstitution impaired: but I think I may reasonably despise the\r\nunderstanding of one who conducts himself in such a manner as naturally\r\nproduces such lamentable consequences, and continues in the same\r\ndestructive paths to the end of a long life, ostentatiously boasting of\r\nmorals and philosophy in print, and with equal ostentation bragging of\r\nthe scenes of low debauchery in public conversation, though deplorably\r\nweak both in mind and body, and his virtue and his vigour in a state of\r\nnon-existence. His confederacy with Swift and Pope puts me in mind of\r\nthat of Bessus and his sword-men, in the _King and no King_,[18] who\r\nendeavour to support themselves by giving certificates of each other's\r\nmerit. Pope has triumphantly declared that they may do and say whatever\r\nsilly things they please, they will still be the greatest geniuses\r\nnature ever exhibited. I am delighted with the comparison given of their\r\nbenevolence, which is indeed most aptly figured by a circle in the\r\nwater, which widens till it comes to nothing at all; but I am provoked\r\nat Lord B.'s misrepresentation of my favourite Atticus, who seems to\r\nhave been the only Roman that, from good sense, had a true notion of the\r\ntimes in which he lived, in which the republic was inevitably perishing,\r\nand the two factions, who pretended to support it, equally endeavouring\r\nto gratify their ambition in its ruin. A wise man, in that case, would\r\ncertainly declare for neither, and try to save himself and family from\r\nthe general wreck, which could not be done but by a superiority of\r\nunderstanding acknowledged on both sides. I see no glory in losing life\r\nor fortune by being the dupe of either, and very much applaud that\r\nconduct which could preserve an universal esteem amidst the fury of\r\nopposite parties. We are obliged to act vigorously, where action can do\r\nany good; but in a storm, when it is impossible to work with success,\r\nthe best hands and ablest pilots may laudably gain the shore if they\r\ncan. Atticus could be a friend to men without engaging in their\r\npassions, disapprove their maxims without awaking their resentment, and\r\nbe satisfied with his own virtue without seeking popular fame: he had\r\nthe reward of his wisdom in his tranquillity, and will ever stand among\r\nthe few examples of true philosophy, either ancient or modern....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: A play by Beaumont and Fletcher, licensed for the stage in\r\n1611.]\r\n\r\n\"I must add a few words on the _Essay on Exile_, which I read with\r\nattention, as a subject that touched me. I found the most abject\r\ndejection under a pretended fortitude. That the author felt it, can be\r\nno doubt to one that knows (as I do) the mean submissions and solemn\r\npromises he made to obtain a return, flattering himself (I suppose) he\r\nneed only appear to be at the head of the administration, as every\r\nensign of sixteen fancies he is in a fair way to be a general on the\r\nfirst sight of his commission.\r\n\r\n\"You will think I have been too long on the character of Atticus. I own\r\nI took pleasure in explaining it. Pope thought himself covertly very\r\nsevere on Mr. Addison by giving him that name; and I feel indignation\r\nwhen he is abused, both from his own merit, and having been your\r\nfather's friend; besides that it is naturally shocking to see any one\r\nlampooned after his death by the same man who had paid him the most\r\nservile court while he lived and was highly obliged by him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a periodical writer she compared Johnson unfavourably with Steele and\r\nAddison:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The _Rambler_ is certainly a strong misnomer; he always plods in the\r\nbeaten road of his predecessors, following the _Spectator_ (with the\r\nsame pace a pack-horse would do a hunter) in the style that is proper to\r\nlengthen a paper. These writers may, perhaps, be of service to the\r\npublic, which is saying a great deal in their favour. There are numbers\r\nof both sexes who never read anything but such productions, and cannot\r\nspare time, from doing nothing, to go through a sixpenny pamphlet. Such\r\ngentle readers may be improved by a moral hint, which, though repeated\r\nover and over, from generation to generation, they never heard in their\r\nlives. I should be glad to know the name of this laborious author.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLADY MARY ON EDUCATION AND WOMAN'S RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe choice of books for children's reading--The dangers of a narrow\r\neducation--Lady Mary advocates the higher education of women--Girls\r\nshould be taught languages--Lady Mary's theories of education for\r\ngirls--Women writers in Italy--A \"rumpus\" made by ladies in the House of\r\nLords--Woman's Rights--Lady Mary's views on religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of her own fondness for books, Lady Mary was not a wholehearted\r\nbeliever in reading for young folk, unless the choice of volumes was\r\ncarefully made by some competent person. This point she emphasised in\r\none of her letters to her daughter.\r\n\r\n\"I can't forbear saying something in relation to my granddaughters, who\r\nare very near my heart. If any of them are fond of reading, I would not\r\nadvise you to hinder them (chiefly because it is impossible) seeing\r\npoetry, plays, or romances; but accustom them to talk over what they\r\nread, and point out to them, as you are very capable of doing, the\r\nabsurdity often concealed under fine expressions, where the sound is apt\r\nto engage the admiration of young people. I was so much charmed, at\r\nfourteen, with the dialogue of Henry and Emma, I can say it by heart to\r\nthis day, without reflecting on the monstrous folly of the story in\r\nplain prose, where a young heiress to a fond father is represented\r\nfalling in love with a fellow she had only seen as a huntsman, a\r\nfalconer, and a beggar, and who confesses, without any circumstances of\r\nexcuse, that he is obliged to run his country, having newly committed a\r\nmurder. She ought reasonably to have supposed him, at best, a\r\nhighwayman; yet the virtuous virgin resolves to run away with him, to\r\nlive among the banditti, and wait upon his trollop, if she had no other\r\nway of enjoying his company. This senseless tale is, however, so well\r\nvarnished with melody of words and pomp of sentiments, I am convinced it\r\nhas hurt more girls than ever were injured by the lewdest poems extant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLife, Lady Mary was at pains to insist upon, is a much better instructor\r\nfor the young than any story-book, however innocuous it may seem to\r\ngrown-up people, who for the greater number have not the faculty of\r\nseeing how the tale would have affected them in their childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate my granddaughters on being born in an age so much\r\nenlightened. Sentiments are certainly extreme silly, and only qualify\r\nyoung people to be the bubbles of all their acquaintance. I do not doubt\r\nthe frequency of assemblies has introduced a more enlarged way of\r\nthinking; it is a kind of public education, which I have always thought\r\nas necessary for girls as for boys. A woman married at five-and-twenty,\r\nfrom under the eye of a strict parent, is commonly as ignorant as she\r\nwas at five; and no more capable of avoiding the snares, and struggling\r\nwith the difficulties, she will infallibly meet with in the commerce of\r\nthe world. The knowledge of mankind (the most useful of all knowledge)\r\ncan only be acquired by conversing with them. Books are so far from\r\ngiving that instruction, they fill the head with a set of wrong notions,\r\nfrom whence spring the tribes of Clarissas, Harriets, &c. Yet such was\r\nthe method of education when I was in England, which I had it not in my\r\npower to correct; the young will always adopt the opinions of all their\r\ncompanions, rather than the advice of their mothers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ignorance and a narrow education lay the foundations of vice,\" Mary\r\nAstell had laid down as an axiom, and Lady Mary was always propounding\r\nthis to her daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am extremely concerned to hear you complain of ill health, at a time\r\nof life when you ought to be in the flower of your strength. I hope I\r\nneed not recommend to you the care of it: the tenderness you have for\r\nyour children is sufficient to enforce you to the utmost regard for the\r\npreservation of a life so necessary to their well-being. I do not doubt\r\nyour prudence in their education: neither can I say anything particular\r\nrelating to it at this distance, different tempers requiring different\r\nmanagement. In general, never attempt to govern them (as most people do)\r\nby deceit: if they find themselves cheated, even in trifles, it will so\r\nfar lessen the authority of their instructor, as to make them neglect\r\nall their future admonitions. And, if possible, breed them free from\r\nprejudices; those contracted in the nursery often influence the whole\r\nlife after, of which I have seen many melancholy examples. I shall say\r\nno more of this subject, nor would have said this little if you had not\r\nasked my advice: 'tis much easier to give rules than to practise them. I\r\nam sensible my own natural temper is too indulgent: I think it the least\r\ndangerous error, yet still it is an error. I can only say with truth,\r\nthat I do not know in my whole life having ever endeavoured to impose on\r\nyou, or give a false colour to anything that I represented to you. If\r\nyour daughters are inclined to love reading, do not check their\r\ninclination by hindering them of the diverting part of it; it is as\r\nnecessary for the amusement of women as the reputation of men; but teach\r\nthem not to expect or desire any applause from it. Let their brothers\r\nshine, and let them content themselves with making their lives easier by\r\nit, which I experimentally know is more effectually done by study than\r\nany other way. Ignorance is as much the fountain of vice as idleness,\r\nand indeed generally produces it. People that do not read, or work for a\r\nlivelihood, have many hours they know not how to employ; especially\r\nwomen, who commonly fall into vapours, or something worse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMary was an advocate, one of the earliest advocates, for the higher\r\neducation of woman. Although she had educated herself, she realised that\r\nthe circumstances in her case were exceptional, and no doubt it was also\r\nborne in on her that she had been an exceptional girl even as she was a\r\nremarkable woman. It was not so much lack of education against which she\r\ntilted, as ill-directed studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have given me a great deal of satisfaction by your account of your\r\neldest daughter. I am particularly pleased to hear she is a good\r\narithmetician; it is the best proof of understanding: the knowledge of\r\nnumbers is one of the chief distinctions between us and the brutes. If\r\nthere is anything in blood, you may reasonably expect your children\r\nshould be endowed with an uncommon share of good sense. Mr. Wortley's\r\nfamily and mine have both produced some of the greatest men that have\r\nbeen born in England: I mean Admiral Sandwich, and my grandfather, who\r\nwas distinguished by the name of Wise William. I have heard Lord Bute's\r\nfather mentioned as an extraordinary genius, though he had not many\r\nopportunities of showing it; and his uncle, the present Duke of Argyll,\r\nhas one of the best heads I ever knew. I will therefore speak to you as\r\nsupposing Lady Mary not only capable, but desirous of learning; in that\r\ncase by all means let her be indulged in it. You will tell me I did not\r\nmake it a part of your education: your prospect was very different from\r\nhers. As you had no defect either in mind or person to hinder, and much\r\nin your circumstances to attract, the highest offers, it seemed your\r\nbusiness to learn how to live in the world, as it is hers to know how to\r\nbe easy out of it. It is the common error of builders and parents to\r\nfollow some plan they think beautiful (and perhaps is so), without\r\nconsidering that nothing is beautiful that is displaced. Hence we see so\r\nmany edifices raised that the raisers can never inhabit, being too large\r\nfor their fortunes. Vistas are laid open over barren heaths, and\r\napartments contrived for a coolness very agreeable in Italy, but killing\r\nin the north of Britain: thus every woman endeavours to breed her\r\ndaughter a fine lady, qualifying her for a station in which she will\r\nnever appear, and at the same time incapacitating her for that\r\nretirement to which she is destined. Learning, if she has a real taste\r\nfor it, will not only make her contented, but happy in it. No\r\nentertainment is so cheap as reading, nor any pleasure so lasting. She\r\nwill not want new fashions, nor regret the loss of expensive diversions,\r\nor variety of company, if she can be amused with an author in her\r\ncloset. To render this amusement extensive, she should be permitted to\r\nlearn the languages. I have heard it lamented that boys lose so many\r\nyears in mere learning of words: this is no objection to a girl, whose\r\ntime is not so precious: she cannot advance herself in any profession,\r\nand has therefore more hours to spare; and as you say her memory is\r\ngood, she will be very agreeably employed this way. There are two\r\ncautions to be given on this subject: first, not to think herself\r\nlearned when she could read Latin, or even Greek. Languages are more\r\nproperly to be called vehicles of learning than learning itself, as may\r\nbe observed in many schoolmasters, who, though perhaps critics in\r\ngrammar, are the most ignorant fellows upon earth. True knowledge\r\nconsists in knowing things, not words. I would wish her no further a\r\nlinguist than to enable her to read books in their originals, that are\r\noften corrupted, and always injured, by translations. Two hours'\r\napplication every morning will bring this about much sooner than you can\r\nimagine, and she will have leisure enough besides to run over the\r\nEnglish poetry, which is a more important part of a woman's education\r\nthan it is generally supposed. Many a young damsel has been ruined by a\r\nfine copy of verses, which she would have laughed at if she had known it\r\nhad been stolen from Mr. Waller. I remember, when I was a girl, I saved\r\none of my companions from destruction, who communicated to me an epistle\r\nshe was quite charmed with. As she had a natural good taste, she\r\nobserved the lines were not so smooth as Prior's or Pope's, but had more\r\nthought and spirit than any of theirs. She was wonderfully delighted\r\nwith such a demonstration of her lover's sense and passion,\r\na little pleased with her own charms, that had force enough to inspire\r\nsuch elegancies. In the midst of this triumph I showed her that they\r\nwere taken from Randolph's poems, and the unfortunate transcriber was\r\ndismissed with the scorn he deserved. To say truth, the poor plagiary\r\nwas very unlucky to fall into my hands; that author being no longer in\r\nfashion, would have escaped any one of less universal reading than\r\nmyself. You should encourage your daughter to talk over with you what\r\nshe reads; and, as you are very capable of distinguishing, take care she\r\ndoes not mistake pert folly for wit and humour, or rhyme for poetry,\r\nwhich are the common errors of young people, and have a train of ill\r\nconsequences. The second caution to be given her (and which is most\r\nabsolutely necessary) is to conceal whatever learning she attains, with\r\nas much solicitude as she would hide crookedness or lameness; the parade\r\nof it can only serve to draw on her the envy, and consequently the most\r\ninveterate hatred, of all he and she fools, which will certainly be at\r\nleast three parts in four of all her acquaintance. The use of knowledge\r\nin our sex, besides the amusement of solitude, is to moderate the\r\npassions, and learn to be contented with a small expense, which are the\r\ncertain effects of a studious life; and it may be preferable even to\r\nthat fame which men have engrossed to themselves, and will not suffer us\r\nto share. You will tell me I have not observed this rule myself; but you\r\nare mistaken: it is only inevitable accident that has given me any\r\nreputation that way. I have always carefully avoided it, and ever\r\nthought it a misfortune. The explanation of this paragraph would\r\noccasion a long digression, which I will not trouble you with, it being\r\nmy present design only to say what I think useful for the instruction of\r\nmy granddaughter, which I have much at heart. If she has the same\r\ninclination (I should say passion) for learning that I was born with,\r\nhistory, geography, and philosophy will furnish her with materials to\r\npass away cheerfully a longer life than is allotted to mortals. I\r\nbelieve there are few heads capable of making Sir I. Newton's\r\ncalculations, but the result of them is not difficult to be understood by\r\na moderate capacity. Do not fear this should make her affect the character\r\nof Lady----, or Lady----, or Mrs.----: those women are ridiculous,\r\nnot because they have learning but because they have it not. One thinks\r\nherself a complete historian, after reading Echard's Roman History;\r\nanother a profound philosopher, having got by heart some of Pope's\r\nunintelligible essays; and a third an able divine, on the strength of\r\nWhitefield's sermons: thus you hear them screaming politics and\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\n\"It is a saying of Thucydides, ignorance is bold, and knowledge\r\nreserved. Indeed, it is impossible to be far advanced in it without\r\nbeing more humbled by a conviction of human ignorance, than elated by\r\nlearning. At the same time I recommend books, I neither exclude work nor\r\ndrawing. I think it as scandalous for a woman not to know how to use a\r\nneedle, as for a man not to know how to use a sword. I was once\r\nextremely fond of my pencil, and it was a great mortification to me when\r\nmy father turned off my master, having made a considerable progress for\r\na short time I learnt. My over-eagerness in the pursuit of it had\r\nbrought a weakness on my eyes, that made it necessary to leave it off;\r\nand all the advantage I got was the improvement of my hand. I see, by\r\nhers, that practice will make her a ready writer: she may attain it by\r\nserving you for a secretary, when your health or affairs make it\r\ntroublesome to you to write yourself; and custom will make it an\r\nagreeable amusement to her. She cannot have too many for that station of\r\nlife which will probably be her fate. The ultimate end of your education\r\nwas to make you a good wife (and I have the comfort to hear that you are\r\none): hers ought to be, to make her happy in a virgin state. I will not\r\nsay it is happier; but it is undoubtedly safer than any marriage. In a\r\nlottery, which there are (at the lowest computation) ten thousand blanks\r\nto a prize, it is the most prudent choice not to venture. I have always\r\nbeen so thoroughly persuaded of this truth, that, notwithstanding the\r\nflattering views I had for you (as I never intended you a sacrifice to\r\nmy vanity), I thought I owed you the justice to lay before you all the\r\nhazards attending matrimony: you may recollect I did so in the strongest\r\nmanner. Perhaps you may have more success in the instructing your\r\ndaughter: she has so much company at home, she will not need seeking it\r\nabroad, and will more readily take the notions you think fit to give her.\r\nAs you were alone in my family, it would have been thought a great\r\ncruelty to suffer you no companions of your own age, especially having\r\nso many near relations, and I do not wonder their opinions influenced\r\nyours. I was not sorry to see you not determined on a single life,\r\nknowing it was not your father's intention, and contented myself with\r\nendeavouring to make your home so easy that you might not be in haste to\r\nleave it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary's views on the education of children were well in advance of\r\nher day. They were certainly not the stereotyped opinions current among\r\ngovernesses or even parents somewhat more enlightened than the rest, and\r\nevidently she had given much consideration to the subject before she put\r\nher thoughts on paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"People commonly educate their children as they build their houses,\r\naccording to some plan they think beautiful, without considering whether\r\nit is suited to the purposes for which they are designed. Almost all\r\ngirls of quality are educated as if they were to be great ladies, which\r\nis often as little to be expected, as an immoderate heat of the sun in\r\nthe north of Scotland. You should teach yours to confine their desires\r\nto probabilities, to be as useful as is possible to themselves, and to\r\nthink privacy (as it is) the happiest state of life. I do not doubt you\r\ngiving them all the instructions necessary to form them to a virtuous\r\nlife; but 'tis a fatal mistake to do this without proper restrictions.\r\nVices are often hid under the name of virtues, and the practice of them\r\nfollowed by the worst of consequences. Sincerity, friendship, piety,\r\ndisinterestedness, and generosity, are all great virtues; but,\r\nwithout discretion, become criminal. I have seen ladies indulge their\r\nown ill humour by being very rude and impertinent, and think they\r\ndeserved approbation by saying I love to speak truth. One of your\r\nacquaintance made a ball the next day after her mother died, to show she\r\nwas sincere. I believe your own reflection will furnish you with but too\r\nmany examples of the ill effects of the rest of the sentiments I have\r\nmentioned, when too warmly embraced. They are generally recommended to\r\nyoung people without limits or distinction, and this prejudice hurries\r\nthem into great misfortunes, while they are applauding themselves in the\r\nnoble practice (as they fancy) of very eminent virtues.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help adding (out of my real affection to you), I wish you\r\nwould moderate that fondness you have for your children. I do not mean\r\nyou should abate any part of your care, or not do your duty to them in\r\nits utmost extent: but I would have you early prepare yourself for\r\ndisappointments, which are heavy in proportion to their being\r\nsurprising. It is hardly possible, in such a number, that none should be\r\nunhappy; prepare yourself against a misfortune of that kind. I confess\r\nthere is hardly any more difficult to support; yet it is certain\r\nimagination has a great share in the pain of it, and it is more in our\r\npower than it is commonly believed to soften whatever ills are founded\r\nor augmented by fancy. Strictly speaking, there is but one real evil--I\r\nmean, acute pain; all other complaints are so considerably diminished by\r\ntime, that it is plain the grief is owing to our passion, since the\r\nsensation of it vanishes when that is over.\r\n\r\n\"There is another mistake, I forgot to mention, usual in mothers: if any\r\nof their daughters are beauties, they take great pains to persuade them\r\nthat they are ugly, or at least that they think so, which the young\r\nwoman never fails to believe springs from envy, and is perhaps not much\r\nin the wrong. I would, if possible, give them a just notion of their\r\nfigure, and show them how far it is valuable. Every advantage has its\r\nprice, and may be either over or undervalued. It is the common\r\ndoctrine of (what are called) good books, to inspire a contempt of\r\nbeauty, riches, greatness, &c., which has done as much mischief among\r\nthe young of our sex as an over eager desire of them. They should look\r\non these things as blessings where they are bestowed, though not\r\nnecessaries that it is impossible to be happy without.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, all these expressions of opinions, although here gathered\r\ntogether, were spread over a term of years. Yet, Lady Mary had from time\r\nto time some qualms as to how her admonitions would be received by her\r\ndaughter, although, as she was careful once to point out: \"I do not give\r\nthem as believing my age has furnished me with superior wisdom, but in\r\ncompliance with your desire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help writing a sort of apology for my laster letter,\r\nforeseeing that you will think it wrong, or at least Lord Bute will be\r\nextremely shocked at the proposal of a learned education for daughters,\r\nwhich the generality of men believe as great a profanation as the clergy\r\nwould do if the laity should presume to exercise the functions of the\r\npriesthood. I desire you would take notice, I would not have learning\r\nenjoined them as a task, but permitted as a pleasure, if their genius\r\nleads them naturally to it. I look upon my granddaughters as a sort of\r\nlay nuns: destiny may have laid up other things for them, but they have\r\nno reason to expect to pass their time otherwise than their aunts do at\r\npresent; and I know, by experience, it is in the power of study not only\r\nto make solitude tolerable, but agreeable. I have now lived almost seven\r\nyears in a stricter retirement than yours in the Isle of Bute, and can\r\nassure you, I have never had half an hour heavy on my hands, for want of\r\nsomething to do. Whoever will cultivate their own mind, will find full\r\nemployment. Every virtue does not only require great care in the\r\nplanting, but as much daily solicitude in cherishing, as exotic fruits\r\nand flowers. The vices and passions (which I am afraid are the natural\r\nproduct of the soil) demand perpetual weeding. Add to this the search\r\nafter knowledge (every branch of which is entertaining), and the longest\r\nlife is too short for the pursuit of it; which, though in some regards\r\nconfined to very strait limits, leaves still a vast variety of\r\namusements to those capable of tasting them, which is utterly impossible\r\nfor those that are blinded by prejudices which are the certain effect of\r\nan ignorant education. My own was one of the worst in the world, being\r\nexactly the same as Clarissa Hawlowe's; her pious Mrs. Norton so\r\nperfectly resembling my governess, who had been nurse to my mother, I\r\ncould almost fancy the author was acquainted with her. She took so much\r\npains, from my infancy, to fill my head with superstitious tales and\r\nfalse notions, it was none of her fault I am not at this day afraid of\r\nwitches and hobgoblins, or turned methodist. Almost all girls are bred\r\nafter this manner. I believe you are the only woman (perhaps I might\r\nsay, person) that never was either frighted or cheated into anything by\r\nyour parents. I can truly affirm, I never deceived anybody in my life,\r\nexcepting (which I confess has often happened undesignedly) by speaking\r\nplainly; as Earl Stanhope used to say (during his ministry) he always\r\nimposed on the foreign ministers by telling them the naked truth, which,\r\nas they thought impossible to come from the mouth of a statesman, they\r\nnever failed to write informations to their respective courts directly\r\ncontrary to the assurances he gave them: most people confounding the\r\nideas of sense and cunning, though there are really no two things in\r\nnature more opposite: it is, in part, from this false reasoning, the\r\nunjust custom prevails of debarring our sex from the advantages of\r\nlearning, the men fancying the improvement of our understandings would\r\nonly furnish us with more art to deceive them, which is directly\r\ncontrary to the truth. Fools are always enterprising, not seeing the\r\ndifficulties of deceit, or the ill consequences of detection. I could\r\ngive many examples of ladies whose ill conduct has been very notorious,\r\nwhich has been owing to that ignorance which has exposed them to\r\nidleness, which is justly called the mother of mischief. There is\r\nnothing so like the education of a woman of quality as that of a prince:\r\nthey are taught to dance, and the exterior part of what is called good\r\nbreeding, which, if they attain, they are extraordinary creatures in\r\ntheir kind, and have all the accomplishments required by their\r\ndirectors. The same characters are formed by the same lessons, which\r\ninclines me to think (if I dare say it) that nature has not placed us in\r\nan inferior rank to men, no more than the females of other animals,\r\nwhere we see no distinction of capacity; though, I am persuaded, if\r\nthere was a commonwealth of rational horses (as Doctor Swift has\r\nsupposed), it would be an established maxim among them, that a mare\r\ncould not be taught to pace. I could add a great deal on this subject,\r\nbut I am not now endeavouring to remove the prejudices of mankind; my\r\nonly design is, to point out to my granddaughters the method of being\r\ncontented with that retreat, to which probably their circumstances will\r\noblige them, and which is perhaps preferable to all the show of public\r\nlife. It has always been my inclination. Lady Stafford (who knew me\r\nbetter than anybody else in the world, both from her own just\r\ndiscernment, and my heart being ever as open to her as myself) used to\r\ntell me, my true vocation was a monastery; and I now find, by\r\nexperience, more sincere pleasure with my books and garden, than all the\r\nflutter of a court could give me.\r\n\r\n\"If you follow my advice in relation to Lady Mary, my correspondence may\r\nbe of use to her; and I shall very willingly give her those instructions\r\nthat may be necessary in the pursuit of her studies. Before her age I\r\nwas in the most regular commerce with my grandmother, though the\r\ndifference of our time of life was much greater, she being past\r\nforty-five when she married my grandfather. She died at ninety-six,\r\nretaining, to the last, the vivacity and clearness of her understanding,\r\nwhich was very uncommon. You cannot remember her, being then in your\r\nnurse's arms. I conclude with repeating to you, I only recommend, but am\r\nfar from commanding, which I think I have no right to do. I tell you my\r\nsentiments, because you desired to know them, and hope you will receive\r\nthem with some partiality, as coming from\r\n\r\n\"Your most affectionate mother.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of Lady Mary's friends was Cardinal Gerolamo Guerini, a distinguished\r\nscholar as well as a great churchman. One day, in October, 1753, he sent\r\na request, by one of his chief chaplains, that Lady Mary would send him\r\nher printed works for the shelves that he was dedicating to English\r\nliterature in the library attached to the college at Brescia that he had\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was struck dumb for some time with this astonishing request; when I\r\nrecovered my vexatious surprise (foreseeing the consequence), I made\r\nanswer, I was highly sensible of the honour designed me, but, upon my\r\nword, I had never printed a single line in my life. I was answered in a\r\ncold tone, his Eminence could send for them to England, but they would\r\nbe a long time coming, and with some hazard; and that he had flattered\r\nhimself I would not refuse him such a favour, and I need not be ashamed\r\nof seeing my name in a collection where he admitted none but the most\r\neminent authors. It was to no purpose to endeavour to convince him. He\r\nwould not stay to dinner, though earnestly invited; and went away with\r\nthe air of one that thought he had reason to be offended. I know his\r\nmaster will have the same sentiments, and I shall pass in his opinion\r\nfor a monster of ingratitude, while it is the blackest of vices in my\r\nopinion, and of which I am utterly incapable--I really could cry for\r\nvexation.\r\n\r\n\"Sure nobody ever had such various provocations to print as myself. I\r\nhave seen things I have wrote, so mangled and falsified, I have scarce\r\nknown them. I have seen poems I never read, published with my name at\r\nlength; and others, that were truly and singly wrote by me, printed\r\nunder the names of others. I have made myself easy under all these\r\nmortifications, by the reflection I did not deserve them, having never\r\naimed at the vanity of popular applause; but I own my philosophy is not\r\nproof against losing a friend, and it may be making an enemy of one to\r\nwhom I am obliged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this letter to Lady Mar, in which Lady Mary explains her plight, she\r\ngoes on to deliver herself of her sentiments concerning the difference\r\nof opinion as regards women writers that was current in Italy and in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nLady Mary held strong views on what are called to-day, or at least were\r\nso called until they were lately in the main conceded, women's rights.\r\nAlthough she said that she did not complain that it was men, and men\r\nonly, who were privileged to exercise the power of government, it is not\r\nunlikely that she yielded this point in order the more effectively to\r\nemphasise some other. Anyhow she was unfeignedly pleased to be able to\r\nrecord (to Lady Pomfret, March, 1737) a \"rumpus\" made by ladies who\r\nregarded their exclusion from a debate in Parliament as unwarrantable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I confess I have often been complimented, since I have been in Italy,\r\non the books I have given the public. I used at first to deny it with\r\nsome warmth; but, finding I persuaded nobody, I have of late contented\r\nmyself with laughing whenever I heard it mentioned, knowing the\r\ncharacter of a learned woman is far from being ridiculous in this\r\ncountry, the greatest families being proud of having produced female\r\nwriters; and a Milanese lady being now professor of mathematics in the\r\nuniversity of Bologna, invited thither by a most obliging letter, wrote\r\nby the present Pope, who desired her to accept of the chair, not as a\r\nrecompense for her merit, but to do honour to a town which is under his\r\nprotection. To say truth, there is no part of the world where our sex is\r\ntreated with so much contempt as in England. I do not complain of men\r\nfor having engrossed the government: in excluding us from all degrees of\r\npower, they preserve us from many fatigues, many dangers, and perhaps\r\nmany crimes. The small proportion of authority that has fallen to my\r\nshare (only over a few children and servants) has always been a burden,\r\nand never a pleasure, and I believe every one finds it so who acts from\r\na maxim (I think an indispensable duty), that whoever is under my power\r\nis under my protection. Those who find a joy in inflicting hardships,\r\nand seeing objects of misery, may have other sensations; but I have\r\nalways thought corrections, even when necessary, as painful to the giver\r\nas to the sufferer, and am therefore very well satisfied with the state\r\nof subjection we are placed in: but I think it the highest injustice to\r\nbe debarred the entertainment of my closet, and that the same studies\r\nwhich raise the character of a man should hurt that of a woman. We are\r\neducated in the grossest ignorance, and no art omitted to stifle our\r\nnatural reason; if some few get above their nurses' instructions, our\r\nknowledge must rest concealed, and be as useless to the world as gold in\r\nthe mine. I am now speaking according to our English notions, which may\r\nwear out, some ages hence, along with others equally absurd. It appears\r\nto me the strongest proof of a clear understanding in Longinus (in every\r\nlight acknowledged one of the greatest men among the ancients), when I\r\nfind him so far superior to vulgar prejudices as to choose his two\r\nexamples of fine writing from a Jew (at that time the most despised\r\npeople upon earth) and a woman. Our modern wits would be so far from\r\nquoting, they would scarce own they had read the works of such\r\ncontemptible creatures, though, perhaps, they would condescend to steal\r\nfrom them, at the same time they declared they were below their notice.\r\nThis subject is apt to run away with me; I will trouble you with no more\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is no news to be sent you from this place, which has been for this\r\nfortnight and still continues overwhelmed with politics, and which are\r\nof so mysterious a nature, one ought to have some of the gifts of Lilly\r\nor Partridge to be able to write about them; and I leave all those\r\ndissertations to those distinguished mortals who are endowed with the\r\ntalent of divination though I am at present the only one of my sex who\r\nseems to be of that opinion, the ladies having shown their zeal and\r\nappetite for knowledge in a most glorious manner. At the last warm\r\ndebate in the House of Lords, it was unanimously resolved there should\r\nbe no crowd of unnecessary auditors; consequently the fair sex were\r\nexcluded, and the gallery destined to the sole use of the House of\r\nCommons. Notwithstanding which determination, a tribe of dames resolved\r\nto show on this occasion that neither men nor laws could resist them.\r\nThese heroines were Lady Huntingdon, the Duchess of Queensberry, the\r\nDuchess of Ancaster, Lady Westmorland, Lady Cobham, Lady Charlotte\r\nEdwin, Lady Archibald Hamilton and her daughter, Mrs. Scott, and Mrs.\r\nPendarves, and Lady Frances Saunderson. I am thus particular in their\r\nnames, since I look upon them to be the boldest assertors, and most\r\nresigned sufferers for liberty, I ever read of. They presented\r\nthemselves at the door at nine o'clock in the morning, where Sir William\r\nSaunderson respectfully informed them that the Chancellor had made an\r\norder against their admittance. The Duchess of Queensberry, as head of\r\nthe squadron, pished at the ill-breeding of a mere lawyer, and desired\r\nhim to let them upstairs privately. After some modest refusals, he swore\r\nby G--he would not let them in. Her Grace, with a noble warmth,\r\nanswered, by G--they would come in in spite of the Chancellor and the\r\nwhole House. This being reported, the Peers resolved to starve them out;\r\nan order was made that the doors should not be opened till they had\r\nraised their siege. These Amazons now showed themselves qualified for\r\nthe duty of even foot soldiers; they stood there till five in the\r\nafternoon, without either sustenance or evacuation, every now and then\r\nplaying volleys of thumps, kicks, and raps against the door, with so\r\nmuch violence that the speakers in the House were scarce heard. When the\r\nLords were not to be conquered by this, the two duchesses (very well\r\napprised of the use of stratagems in war) commanded a dead silence of\r\nhalf an hour; and the Chancellor, who thought this a certain proof of\r\ntheir absence (the Commons also being very impatient to enter), gave\r\norder for the opening of the door, upon which they all rushed in, pushed\r\naside their competitors, and placed themselves in the front rows of the\r\ngallery. They stayed there till after eleven, when the House rose; and\r\nduring the debate gave applause, and showed marks of dislike, not only\r\nby smiles and winks (which have always been allowed in these cases), but\r\nby noisy laughs and apparent contempts; which is supposed the true\r\nreason why poor Lord Hervey spoke miserably. I beg your pardon, dear\r\nmadam, for this long relation; but 'tis impossible to be short on so\r\ncopious a subject; and you must own this action very well worthy of\r\nrecord, and I think not to be paralleled in history, ancient or modern.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary, however, was less concerned with \"the open door\" for women in\r\npolitics: her primary desire was that a woman should have the right,\r\nwithin reason, to live her own life, and not merely be a chattel of her\r\nhusband. There is the conduct of her own married life to prove her\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nHer view of the Turkish woman has already been given, as also has her\r\nopinion that marriages should be for the limited period of seven years.\r\nNow, she gave her opinion of the woman question in Italy, and it would\r\nseem that, realising that her own marriage has been anything but\r\nsatisfactory to either party, she wrote from her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot let pass in silence the prodigious alteration, since Misson's\r\nwriting, in regard to our sex. This reformation (or, if you please,\r\ndepravation) began so lately as the year 1732, when the French overran\r\nthis part of Italy; but it has been carried on with such fervour and\r\nsuccess, that the Italian go far beyond their patterns, the Parisian\r\nladies, in the extent of their liberty. I am not so much surprised at\r\nthe women's conduct, as I am amazed at the change in the men's\r\nsentiments. Jealousy, which was once a point of honour among them, is\r\nexploded to that degree, it is the most infamous and ridiculous of all\r\ncharacters; and you cannot more affront a gentleman than to suppose\r\nhim capable of it. Divorces are also introduced, and frequent enough;\r\nthey have long been in fashion in Genoa; several of the finest and\r\ngreatest ladies there having two husbands alive. The constant pretext is\r\nimpotency, to which the man often pleads guilty, and though he marries\r\nagain, and has children by another wife, the plea remains good by saying\r\nhe was so in regard to his first; and when I told them that in England a\r\ncomplaint of that kind was esteemed so impudent no reasonable woman\r\nwould submit to make it, I was answered we lived without religion, and\r\nthat their consciences obliged them rather to strain a point of modesty\r\nthan to live in a state of damnation. However, as this method is not\r\nwithout inconvenience (it being impracticable where there is children),\r\nthey have taken another here: the husband deposes upon oath that he has\r\nhad a commerce with his mother-in-law, on which the marriage is declared\r\nincestuous and nullified, though the children remain legitimate. You\r\nwill think this hard on the old lady, who is scandalised; but it is no\r\nscandal at all, nobody supposing it to be true, without circumstances to\r\nconfirm it; but the married couple are set free to their mutual content;\r\nfor I believe it would be difficult to get a sentence of divorce, if\r\neither side made opposition: at least I have heard no example of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary made no secret of her views upon marriage; and though she did\r\nnot so frequently air her religious beliefs, she often pondered the\r\nsubject, and when challenged to speak was not reticent. As regards\r\nsacred matters, she always had the courage of her convictions, even as\r\nshe had in mundane affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I always, if possible, avoid controversial disputes: whenever I cannot\r\ndo it, they are very short\" (she wrote to her daughter in October,\r\n1755). \"I ask my adversary if he believes in the Scripture? When that is\r\nanswered affirmatively their church may be proved, by a child of ten\r\nyears old, contradictory to it, in their most important points. My\r\nsecond question is, if they think St. Peter and St. Paul knew the true\r\nChristian religion? The constant reply is, O yes. Then say I, purgatory,\r\ntransubstantiation, invocation of saints, adoration of the Virgin,\r\nrelics (of which they might have had a cartload), the observation of\r\nLent, is no part of it, since they neither taught nor practised any of\r\nthese things. Vows of celibacy are not more contrary to nature, than to\r\nthe positive precept of St. Paul. He mentions a very common case, in\r\nwhich people are obliged, by conscience, to marry. No mortal can promise\r\nthat case shall never be theirs, which depends on the disposition of the\r\nbody as much as a fever; and 'tis as reasonable to engage never to feel\r\nthe one as the other. He tells us, the marks of the Holy Spirit are\r\ncharity, humility, truth, and long suffering. Can anything be more\r\nuncharitable than damning eternally so many millions for not believing\r\nwhat they never heard? or prouder than calling their head a Vice-god?\r\nPious frauds are avowedly permitted, and persecution applauded: these\r\nmaxims cannot be dictated by the spirit of peace, which is so warmly\r\npreached in the Gospel. The creeds of the apostles, and council of Nice,\r\ndo not speak of the mass, or real presence, as articles of belief; and\r\nAthanasius asserts, whosoever believes according to them shall be saved.\r\nJesus Christ, in answer to the lawyer, bids him love God above all\r\nthings, and his neighbour as himself, as all that is necessary to\r\nsalvation. When he describes the last judgment, he does not examine what\r\nsect, or what church, men were of, but how far they had been beneficent\r\nto mankind. Faith cannot determine reward or punishment, being\r\ninvoluntary, and only the consequence of conviction: we do not believe\r\nwhat we please, but what appears to us with the face of truth. As I do\r\nnot mistake exclamation, invective, or ridicule for argument, I never\r\nrecriminate on the lives of their popes and cardinals, when they urge\r\nthe character of Henry the Eighth; I only answer, good actions are often\r\ndone by all men through interested motives, and 'tis the common method\r\nof Providence to bring good out of evil: history, both sacred and\r\nprofane, furnishes many examples of it. When they tell me I have forsook\r\nthe worship of my ancestors, I say I have had more ancestors heathen\r\nthan Christian, and my faith is certainly ancienter than theirs, since I\r\nhave added nothing to the practice of the primitive professors of\r\nChristianity. As to the prosperity or extent of the dominion of their\r\nchurch, which Cardinal Bellarmin counts among the proofs of its\r\northodoxy, the Mahometans, who have larger empires, and have made a\r\nquicker progress, have a better plea for the visible protection of\r\nHeaven. If the fopperies of their religion were only fopperies, they\r\nought to be complied with, wherever it is established, like any\r\nridiculous dress in fashion; but I think them impieties: their devotions\r\nare scandal to humanity from their nonsense; the mercenary deceits and\r\nbarbarous tyranny of their ecclesiastics, inconsistent with moral\r\nhonesty. If they object the diversity of our sects as a mark of\r\nreprobation, I desire them to consider, that objection has equal force\r\nagainst Christianity in general. When they thunder with the names of\r\nfathers and councils, they are surprised to find me as well (often\r\nbetter) acquainted with them than themselves. I show them the variety of\r\ntheir doctrines, their virulent contests and various factions, instead\r\nof that union they boast of. I have never been attacked a second time in\r\nany of the towns where I have resided, and perhaps shall never be so\r\nagain after my last battle, which was with an old priest, a learned man,\r\nparticularly esteemed as a mathematician, and who has a head and heart\r\nas warm as poor Whiston's. When I first came hither, he visited me every\r\nday, and talked of me everywhere with such violent praise, that, had we\r\nbeen young people, God knows what would have been said. I have always\r\nthe advantage of being quite calm on a subject which they cannot talk of\r\nwithout heat. He desired I would put on paper what I had said. I\r\nimmediately wrote one side of a sheet, leaving the other for his answer.\r\nHe carried it with him, promising to bring it the next day, since which\r\ntime I have never seen it, though I have often demanded it, being of\r\nmy defective Italian. I fancy he sent it to his friend the Archbishop of\r\nMilan. I have given over asking for it, as a desperate debt. He still\r\nvisits me, but seldom, and in a cold sort of a way. When I have found\r\ndisputants I less respected, I have sometimes taken pleasure in raising\r\ntheir hopes by my concessions: they are charmed when I agree with them\r\nin the number of the sacraments; but are horridly disappointed when I\r\nexplain myself by saying the word sacrament is not to be found either in\r\nOld or New Testament; and one must be very ignorant not to know it is\r\ntaken from the listing oath of the Roman soldiers, and means nothing\r\nmore than a solemn, irrevocable engagement. Parents vow, in infant\r\nbaptism, to educate their children in the Christian religion, which they\r\ntake upon themselves by confirmation; the Lord's Supper is frequently\r\nrenewing the same oath. Ordination and matrimony are solemn vows of a\r\ndifferent kind: confession includes a vow of revealing all we know, and\r\nreforming what is amiss: extreme unction, the last vow, that we have\r\nlived in the faith we were baptised: in this sense they are all\r\nsacraments. As to the mysteries preached since, they were all invented\r\nlong after, and some of them repugnant to the primitive institution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nON THE CONTINENT (1745-1760)\r\n\r\nLady Mary stays at Avignon--She removes to Brescia--And then to\r\nLovere--She abandons all idea of Montagu joining her abroad--Her house\r\nat Lovere--Her daily round--Her health--Her anxiety about her son--An\r\namazing incident--A serious illness--A novel in a letter--Her\r\ncorrespondence attracts the attention of the Italian authorities--Sir\r\nJames and Lady Frances Steuart--Politics--She is in the bad books of the\r\nBritish Resident at Venice--Lord Bute--The philosophy of Lady\r\nMary--Letters to Lady Bute and Sir James Steuart.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary liked Avignon so well that she stayed there until July 1746.\r\nThen she moved to Brescia, where she stayed for a year, and then took up\r\nher quarters at Lovere, a small place in Lombardy on the Lake d'Iseo, a\r\nmost attractive spot, as she was at pains to tell her daughter at some\r\nlength. For some time she alternated between Lovere and Brescia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am now in a place the most beautifully romantic I ever saw in my\r\nlife: it is the Tunbridge of this part of the world, to which I was sent\r\nby the doctor's order, my ague often returning, notwithstanding the\r\nloads of bark I have taken\" (she wrote to her daughter from Lovere, July\r\n24, 1747). \"To say truth, I have no reason to repent my journey, though\r\nI was very unwilling to undertake it, it being forty miles, half by land\r\nand half by water; the land so stony I was almost shook to pieces, and I\r\nhad the ill luck to be surprised with a storm on the lake, that if I had\r\nnot been near a little port (where I passed a night in a very poor inn),\r\nthe vessel must have been lost. A fair wind brought me hither next\r\nmorning early. I found a very good lodging, a great deal of good\r\ncompany, and a village in many respects resembling Tunbridge Wells, not\r\nonly in the quality of the waters, which is the same, but in the manner\r\nof the buildings, most of the houses being separate at little distances,\r\nand all built on the sides of hills, which indeed are far different from\r\nthose of Tunbridge, being six times as high: they are really vast rocks\r\nof different figures, covered with green moss, or short grass,\r\ndiversified by tufts of trees, little woods, and here and there\r\nvineyards, but no other cultivation, except gardens like those on\r\nRichmond-hill. The whole lake, which is twenty-five miles long, and\r\nthree broad, is all surrounded with these impassable mountains, the\r\nsides of which, towards the bottom, are so thick set with villages (and\r\nin most of them gentlemen's seats), that I do not believe there is\r\nanywhere above a mile distance one from another, which adds very much to\r\nthe beauty of the prospect.\r\n\r\n\"We have an opera here, which is performed three times in the week. I\r\nwas at it last night, and should have been surprised at the neatness of\r\nthe scenes, goodness of the voices and justness of the actors, if I had\r\nnot remembered I was in Italy. Several gentlemen jumped into the\r\norchestra, and joined in the concert, which I suppose is one of the\r\nfreedoms of the place, for I never saw it in any great town. I was yet\r\nmore amazed (while the actors were dressing for the farce that concluded\r\nthe entertainment) to see one of the principal among them, and as errant\r\na _petit maitre_ as if he had passed all his life at Paris, mount the\r\nstage, and present us with a cantata of his own performing. He had the\r\npleasure of being almost deafened with applause. The ball began\r\nafterwards, but I was not witness of it, having accustomed myself to\r\nsuch early hours, that I was half asleep before the opera finished: it\r\nbegins at ten o'clock, so that it was one before I could get to bed,\r\nthough I had supped before I went, which is the custom.\r\n\r\n\"I am much better pleased with the diversions on the water, where all\r\nthe town assembles every night, and never without music; but we have\r\nnone so rough as trumpets, kettle-drums, and French horns: they are all\r\nviolins, lutes, mandolins, and flutes doux. Here is hardly a man that\r\ndoes not excel in some of these instruments, which he privately\r\naddresses to the lady of his affections, and the public has the\r\nadvantage of it by his adding to the number of the musicians.\r\n\r\n\"The fountain where we drink the waters rises between two hanging hills,\r\nand is overshadowed with large trees, that give a freshness in the\r\nhottest time of the day. The provisions are all excellent, the fish of\r\nthe lake being as large and well tasted as that of Geneva, and the\r\nmountains abounding in game, particularly blackcocks, which I never saw\r\nin any other part of Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary, though still corresponding with her husband, had clearly\r\ngiven up all idea of returning to England or of Montagu joining her\r\nabroad. She was quite content with her state, which, after all, so far\r\nas we know, was her own choice. She took a house at Lovere, and\r\ninterested herself in improving it and developing the grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have been these six weeks, and still am, at my dairy-house, which\r\njoins to my garden\" (she wrote to her daughter in July, 1748). \"I\r\nbelieve I have already told you it is a long mile from the castle, which\r\nis situated in the midst of a very large village, once a considerable\r\ntown, part of the walls still remaining, and has not vacant ground\r\nenough about it to make a garden, which is my greatest amusement, it\r\nbeing now troublesome to walk, or even go in the chaise till the\r\nevening. I have fitted up in this farm-house a room for myself--that is\r\nto say, strewed the floor with rushes, covered the chimney with moss and\r\nbranches, and adorned the room with basins of earthen-ware (which is\r\nmade here to great perfection) filled with flowers, and put in some\r\nstraw chairs, and a couch bed, which is my whole furniture. This spot of\r\nground is so beautiful, I am afraid you will scarce credit the\r\ndescription, which, however, I can assure you, shall be very literal,\r\nwithout any embellishment from imagination. It is on a bank, forming a\r\nkind of peninsula, raised from the river Oglio fifty feet, to which you\r\nmay descend by easy stairs cut in the turf, and either take the air on\r\nthe river, which is as large as the Thames at Richmond, or by walking\r\n[in] an avenue two hundred yards on the side of it, you find a wood of a\r\nhundred acres, which was all ready cut into walks and ridings when I\r\ntook it. I have only added fifteen bowers in different views, with seats\r\nof turf. They were easily made, here being a large quantity of\r\nunderwood, and a great number of wild vines, which twist to the top of\r\nthe highest trees, and from which they make a very good sort of wine\r\nthey call _brusco_. I am now writing to you in one of these arbours,\r\nwhich is so thickly shaded, the sun is not troublesome, even at noon.\r\nAnother is on the side of the river, where I have made a camp kitchen,\r\nthat I may take the fish, dress, and eat it immediately, and at the same\r\ntime see the barks, which ascend or descend every day to or from Mantua,\r\nGuastalla, or Pont de Vie, all considerable towns. This little wood is\r\ncarpeted, in their succeeding seasons, with violets and strawberries,\r\ninhabited by a nation of nightingales, and filled with game of all\r\nkinds, excepting deer and wild boar, the first being unknown here, and\r\nnot being large enough for the other.\r\n\r\n\"My garden was a plain vineyard when it came into my hands not two years\r\nago, and it is, with a small expense, turned into a garden that (apart\r\nfrom the advantage of the climate) I like better than that of\r\nKensington. The Italian vineyards are not planted like those in France,\r\nbut in clumps, fastened to trees planted in equal ranks (commonly\r\nfruit-trees), and continued in festoons from one to another, which I\r\nhave turned into covered galleries of shade, that I can walk in the heat\r\nwithout being incommoded by it. I have made a dining-room of verdure,\r\ncapable of holding a table of twenty covers; the whole ground is three\r\nhundred and seventeen feet in length, and two hundred in breadth. You\r\nsee it is far from large; but so prettily disposed (though I say it),\r\nthat I never saw a more agreeable rustic garden, abounding with all sort\r\nof fruit, and produces a variety of wines. I would send you a piece [_sic_]\r\nif I did not fear the customs would make you pay too dear for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was now in her sixtieth year, and asked for nothing better\r\nthan peace and comfort. Her manner of life she described as being as\r\nregular as that of any monastery. She rose at six, and after an early\r\nbreakfast worked in the garden. Then she visited the dairy and inspected\r\nher chickens--at one time she had two hundred of them--and her turkeys,\r\ngeese, ducks, and peacocks, her bees and her silkworms. At eleven she\r\nread for an hour, and after an early dinner would take a siesta. Then\r\nshe played picquet or whist with some friendly priests. In the evening\r\nshe walked in the woods, or rode, or went on the lake. \"I enjoy every\r\namusement that solitude can afford,\" she said. \"I confess I sometimes\r\nwish for a little conversation, but I reflect that the commerce of the\r\nworld gives more uneasiness than pleasure, and quiet is all the hope\r\nthat can reasonably be indulged at my age.\" It would not have been Lady\r\nMary if she had not kept a keen eye on the pence. She was delighted to\r\nbe able to say in relation to her house and grounds that \"all things\r\nhave hitherto prospered under my care; my bees and silkworms are\r\ndoubled, and I am told that, without accidents, my capital will be so in\r\ntwo years' time.\" She enjoyed the more her evening now and her fish at\r\ndinner, because neither cost her anything. \"The fishery of this part of\r\nthe river belongs to me; and my fisherman's little boat (where I have a\r\ngreen lutestring awning) serves me for a barge. He and his sons are my\r\nrowers without expense, he being very well paid by the profit of the\r\nfish, which I give him on condition of having every day one dish for my\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\nAge dealt gently with Lady Mary. At the age of sixty-two, she could say\r\nthat her hearing and her memory were good, and her sight better than she\r\nhad any right to expect. She had appetite enough to relish what she ate,\r\nslept as soundly as she had ever done, and had never a headache. Still,\r\nthe fact was forced upon her that she was no longer so young as she had\r\nbeen--which unpleasing reflection she accepted philosophically enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I no more expect to arrive at the age of the Duchess of Marlborough[19]\r\nthan to that of Methusalem; neither do I desire it\" (she wrote to Lady\r\nBute in the early spring of 1751). \"I have long thought myself useless\r\nto the world. I have seen one generation pass away; and it is gone; for\r\nI think there are very few of those left that flourished in my youth.\r\nYou will perhaps call these melancholy reflections: they are not so.\r\nThere is a quiet after the abandoning of pursuits, something like the\r\nrest that follows a laborious day. I tell you this for your comfort. It\r\nwas formerly a terrifying view to me, that I should one day be an old\r\nwoman. I now find that Nature has provided pleasures for every state.\r\nThose are only unhappy who will not be contented with what she gives,\r\nbut strive to break through her laws, by affecting a perpetuity of youth\r\nwhich appears to me as little desirable at present as the babies do to\r\nyou, that were the delight of your infancy.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The Duchess of Marlborough was born on May 29, 1660, and\r\ndied on October 18, 1744.]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe reverted to the same subject when writing to her husband a month or\r\ntwo later:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can no longer resist the desire I have to know what is become of my\r\nson. I have long suppressed it, from a belief that if there was anything\r\nof good to be told, you would not fail to give me the pleasure of\r\nhearing it. I find it now grows so much upon me, that whatever I am to\r\nknow, I think it would be easier for me to support, than the anxiety I\r\nsuffer from my doubts. I beg to be informed, and prepare myself for the\r\nworst, with all the philosophy I have. At my time of life I ought to be\r\ndetached from a world which I am soon to leave; to be totally so is a\r\nvain endeavour, and perhaps there is vanity in the endeavour: while we\r\nare human, we must submit to human infirmities, and suffer them in mind\r\nas well as body. All that reflection and experience can do is to\r\nmitigate, we can never extinguish, our passions. I call by that name\r\nevery sentiment that is not founded upon reason, and own I cannot\r\njustify to mine the concern I feel for one who never gave me any view of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"This is too melancholy a subject to dwell upon. You compliment me on\r\nthe continuation of my spirits: 'tis true, I try to maintain them by\r\nevery art I can, being sensible of the terrible consequences of losing\r\nthem. Young people are too apt to let theirs sink on any disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was, in 1751, some extraordinary incident in the life of Lady\r\nMary, the true history of which has never been made public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pray tell me,\" Horace Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann on August 31 of\r\nthat year, \"if you know anything of Lady Mary Wortley: we have an\r\nobscure history here of her being in durance in the Brescian or the\r\nBergamasco: that a young fellow that she set out with keeping has taken\r\nit into his head to keep her close prisoner, not permitting her to write\r\nor receive any letters but which he sees: he seems determined, if her\r\nhusband should die, not to lose her, as the Count [Richcourt] did Lady\r\nOxford.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo reply to this letter reached Walpole, but his insatiable curiosity\r\nwould not accept this as a check, and he wrote again on October 14: \"Did\r\nyou ever receive the question I asked you about Lady Mary Wortley's\r\nbeing confined by a lover that she keeps somewhere in the Brescian? I\r\nlong to know the particulars.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of this incident Lady Mary was in her sixty-second year. It\r\nis possible, but extremely improbable, therefore, that Lady Mary should\r\nhave taken a young man into keeping. Horace Walpole may always be\r\ntrusted to make the best of a rumour. Still, it may be stated, on the\r\nauthority of Wright, that among Lady Mary's papers there was found a\r\nlong account of the matter, written in Italian. In this she mentioned\r\nthat for some time she had been forcibly detained in a country house\r\nbelonging to an Italian Count and occupied by him and his mother. This\r\npaper, it is further mentioned, seems to have been submitted to a lawyer\r\nfor his opinion or for production in a court of law. It may be, of\r\ncourse, that Lady Mary did, to some extent, adopt the young man, who\r\nthought that by keeping possession of her person he might be able to\r\nextort money from her.\r\n\r\nNot long after this business, in fact, in February, 1752, Lady Mary was\r\nreporting that she was well enough in health. She had been reading\r\nCoventry's _Pompey the Little_, and tells her daughter that she saw\r\nherself in the character of Mrs. Qualmsick:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will be surprised at this, no Englishwoman being so free from\r\nvapours, having never in my life complained of low spirits or weak\r\nnerves; but our resemblance is very strong in the fancied loss of\r\nappetite, which I have been silly enough to be persuaded into by the\r\nphysician of this place. He visits me frequently, as being one of the\r\nmost considerable men in the parish, and is a grave, sober thinking\r\ngreat fool, whose solemn appearance, and deliberate way of delivering\r\nhis sentiments gives them an air of good sense, though they are often\r\nthe most injudicious that ever were pronounced. By perpetual telling me\r\nI eat so little, he is amazed I am able to subsist, he had brought me to\r\nbe of his opinion; and I began to be seriously uneasy at it. This useful\r\ntreatise has roused me into a recollection of what I eat yesterday, and\r\ndo almost every day the same. I wake generally about seven, and drink\r\nhalf a pint of warm asses' milk, after which I sleep two hours; as soon\r\nas I am risen, I constantly take three cups of milk coffee, and\r\nhours after that a large cup of milk chocolate: two hours more brings my\r\ndinner, where I never fail swallowing a good dish (I don't mean plate)\r\nof gravy soup, with all the bread, roots, &c., belonging to it. I then\r\neat a wing and the whole body of a large fat capon, and a veal\r\nsweetbread, concluding with a competent quantity of custard, and some\r\nroasted chestnuts. At five in the afternoon I take another dose of\r\nasses' milk; and for supper twelve chestnuts (which would weigh\r\ntwenty-four of those in London), one new laid egg, and a handsome\r\nporringer of white bread and milk. With this diet, notwithstanding the\r\nmenaces of my wise doctor, I am now convinced I am in no danger of\r\nstarving; and am obliged to Little Pompey for this discovery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years later, however, when she was in her sixty-fifth year, Lady\r\nMary found herself far from well. In April of that year, she told her\r\ndaughter: \"My time is wholly dedicated to the care of a decaying body,\r\nand endeavouring, as the old song says, to grow wiser and better, as my\r\nstrength wears away.\" Shortly after, she was taken seriously unwell at\r\nGottolengo. When she had recovered she, always interested in medical\r\nscience, sent Lady Bute a full account of her illness and of the\r\nextraordinary physician from the neighbouring village of Lovere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Soon after I wrote my last letter to my dear child, I was seized with\r\nso violent a fever, accompanied with so many bad symptoms, my life was\r\ndespaired of by the physician of Gottolengo, and I prepared myself for\r\ndeath with as much resignation as that circumstance admits: some of my\r\nneighbours without my knowledge, sent express for the doctor of this\r\nplace, whom I have mentioned to you formerly as having uncommon secrets.\r\nI was surprised to see him at my bedside. He declared me in great\r\ndanger, but did not doubt my recovery, if I was wholly under his care;\r\nand his first prescription was transporting me hither; the other\r\nphysician asserted positively I should die on the road. It has always\r\nbeen my opinion that it is a matter of the utmost indifference where we\r\nexpire, and I consented to be removed. My bed was placed on a bancard;\r\nmy servants followed in chaises; and in this equipage I set out. I bore\r\nthe first day's journey of fifteen miles without any visible alteration.\r\nThe doctor said, as I was not worse, I was certainly better; and the\r\nnext day proceeded twenty miles to Iséo, which is at the head of this\r\nlake. I lay each night at noblemen's houses, which were empty. My cook,\r\nwith my physician, aways preceded two or three hours, and I found my\r\nchamber, with all necessaries, ready prepared with the exactest\r\nattention. I was put into a bark in my litter bed, and in three hours\r\narrived here. My spirits were not at all wasted (I think rather raised)\r\nby the fatigue of my journey. I drank the water next morning, and, with\r\na few doses of my physician's prescription, in three days found myself\r\nin perfect health, which appeared almost a miracle to all that saw me.\r\nYou may imagine I am willing to submit to the orders of one that I must\r\nacknowledge the instrument of saving my life, though they are not\r\nentirely conformable to my will and pleasure. He has sentenced me to a\r\nlong continuance here, which, he says, is absolutely necessary to the\r\nconfirmation of my health, and would persuade me that my illness has\r\nbeen wholly owing to my omission of drinking the waters these two years\r\npast. I dare not contradict him, and must own he deserves (from the\r\nvarious surprising cures I have seen) the name given to him in this\r\ncountry of the miraculous man. Both his character and practice are so\r\nsingular, I cannot forbear giving you some account of them. He will not\r\npermit his patients to have either surgeon or apothecary: he performs\r\nall the operations of the first with great dexterity; and whatever\r\ncompounds he gives, he makes in his own house: those are very few; the\r\njuice of herbs, and these waters, being commonly his sole prescriptions.\r\nHe has very little learning, and professes drawing all his knowledge\r\nfrom experience, which he possesses, perhaps, in a greater degree than\r\nany other mortal, being the seventh doctor of his family in a direct\r\nline. His forefathers have all of them left journals and registers\r\nsolely for the use of their posterity, none of them having published\r\nanything; and he has recourse to these manuscripts on every difficult\r\ncase, the veracity of which, at least, is unquestionable. His vivacity\r\nis prodigious, and he is indefatigable in his industry: but what most\r\ndistinguishes him is a disinterestedness I never saw in any other: he is\r\nas regular in his attendance on the poorest peasant, from whom he never\r\ncan receive one farthing, as on the richest of the nobility; and,\r\nwhenever he is wanted, will climb three or four miles in the mountains,\r\nin the hottest sun, or heaviest rain, where a horse cannot go, to arrive\r\nat a cottage, where, if their condition requires it, he does not only\r\ngive them advice and medicines gratis, but bread, wine, and whatever is\r\nneedful. There never passes a week without one or more of these\r\nexpeditions. His last visit is generally to me. I often see him as dirty\r\nand tired as a foot post, having eat nothing all day but a roll or two\r\nthat he carries in his pocket, yet blest with such a perpetual flow of\r\nspirits, he is always gay to a degree above cheerfulness. There is a\r\npeculiarity in his character that I hope will incline you to forgive my\r\ndrawing it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was probably by the advice of her physician that Lady Mary decided to\r\nmake Lovere her headquarters. He prescribed taking the waters there and\r\na long rest. Lovere was a dull place, visitors coming only during the\r\nwater-drinking season. The plague that overran Europe in 1626 had\r\nravaged it: the poor were almost destroyed, and the rich deserted it. A\r\nfew of the ancient palaces had been turned into lodging-houses; the rest\r\nwere in ruinous condition. Lady Mary bought one of the palaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I see you lift up your eyes in wonder at my indiscretion. I beg you to\r\nhear my reasons before you condemn me. In my infirm state of health the\r\nunavoidable noise of a public lodging is very disagreeable; and here is\r\nno private one: secondly, and chiefly, the whole purchase is but one\r\nhundred pounds, with a very pretty garden in terraces down to the water,\r\nand a court behind the house. It is founded on a rock, and the walls so\r\nthick, they will probably remain as long as the earth. It is true, the\r\napartments are in most tattered circumstances, without doors or windows.\r\nThe beauty of the great saloon gained my affection: it is forty-two feet\r\nin length by twenty-five, proportionably high, opening into a balcony of\r\nthe same length, with marble balusters: the ceiling and flooring are in\r\ngood repair, but I have been forced to the expense of covering the wall\r\nwith new stucco; and the carpenter is at this minute taking measure of\r\nthe windows, in order to make frames for sashes. The great stairs are in\r\nsuch a declining way, it would be a very hazardous exploit to mount\r\nthem: I never intend to attempt it. The state bedchamber shall also\r\nremain for the sole use of the spiders that have taken possession of it,\r\nalong with the grand cabinet, and some other pieces of magnificence,\r\nquite useless to me, and which would cost a great deal to make\r\nhabitable. I have fitted up six rooms, with lodgings for five servants,\r\nwhich are all I ever will have in this place; and I am persuaded that I\r\ncould make a profit if I would part with my purchase, having been very\r\nmuch befriended in the sale, which was by auction, the owner having died\r\nwithout children, and I believe he had never seen this mansion in his\r\nlife, it having stood empty from the death of his grandfather. The\r\ngovernor bid for me, and nobody would bid against him. Thus I am become\r\na citizen of Lovere, to the great joy of the inhabitants, not (as they\r\nwould pretend) from their respect for my person, but I perceive they\r\nfancy I shall attract all the travelling English; and, to say the truth,\r\nthe singularity of the place is well worth their curiosity; but, as I\r\nhave no correspondents, I may be buried here fifty years, and nobody\r\nknow anything of the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary found great pleasure in her correspondence. It was one of the\r\noccupations with which she solaced her loneliness, and she was never more\r\nhappy than when she had an exciting story to set down, for she could set\r\nit down with the ease of a Walpole and an individual touch that was all\r\nher own:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was quietly reading in my closet, when I was interrupted by the\r\nchambermaid of the Signora Laura Bono, who flung herself at my feet,\r\nand, in an agony of sobs and tears, begged me, for the love of the holy\r\nMadonna, to hasten to her master's house, where the two brothers would\r\ncertainly murder one another, if my presence did not stop their fury. I\r\nwas very much surprised, having always heard them spoken of as a pattern\r\nof fraternal union. However, I made all possible speed thither, without\r\nstaying for hoods or attendance. I was soon there (the house touching my\r\ngarden wall), and was directed to the bedchamber by the noise of oaths\r\nand execrations; but, on opening the door, was astonished to a degree\r\nyou may better guess than I describe, by seeing the Signora Laura\r\nprostrate on the ground, melting in tears, and her husband standing with\r\na drawn stiletto in his hand, swearing she should never see tomorrow's\r\nsun. I was soon let into the secret. The good man, having business of\r\nconsequence at Brescia, went thither early in the morning; but, as he\r\nexpected his chief tenant to pay his rent that day, he left orders with\r\nhis wife, that if the farmer, who lived two miles off, came himself, or\r\nsent any of his sons, she should take care to make him very welcome. She\r\nobeyed him with great punctuality, the money coming in the hand of a\r\nhandsome lad of eighteen: she did not only admit him to her own table,\r\nand produce the best wine in the cellar, but resolved to give him _chêre\r\nentière_. While she was exercising this generous hospitality, the\r\nhusband met midway the gentleman he intended to visit, who was posting\r\nto another side of the country; they agreed on another appointment, and\r\nhe returned to his own house, where, giving his horse to be led round to\r\nthe stable by the servant that accompanied him, he opened his door with\r\nthe _passe-partout_ key, and proceeded to his chamber, without meeting\r\nanybody, where he found his beloved spouse asleep on the bed with her\r\ngallant. The opening of the door waked them: the young fellow\r\nimmediately leaped out of the window, which looked into the garden, and\r\nwas open, it being summer, and escaped over the fields, leaving his\r\nbreeches on a chair by the bedside--very striking circumstance. In\r\nshort, the case was such, I do not think the queen of fairies herself\r\ncould have found an excuse, though Chaucer tells us she has made a\r\nsolemn promise to leave none of her sex unfurnished with one, to all\r\neternity. As to the poor criminal, she had nothing to say for herself\r\nbut what I dare swear you will hear from your youngest daughter, if ever\r\nyou catch her stealing of sweetmeats--\"Pray, pray, she would do so no\r\nmore, and indeed it was the first time.\" This last article found no\r\ncredit with me: I cannot be persuaded that any woman who had lived\r\nvirtuous till forty (for such is her age) could suddenly be endowed with\r\nsuch consummate impudence, to solicit a youth at first sight, there\r\nbeing no probability, his age and station considered, that he would have\r\nmade any attempt of that kind. I must confess I was wicked enough to\r\nthink the unblemished reputation she had hitherto maintained, and did\r\nnot fail to put us in mind of, was owing to a series of such frolics;\r\nand to say truth, they are the only amours that can reasonably hope to\r\nremain undiscovered. Ladies that can resolve to make love thus\r\n_extempore_, may pass unobserved, especially if they can content\r\nthemselves with low life, where fear may oblige their favourites to\r\nsecrecy: there wants only a very lewd constitution, a very bad heart,\r\nand a moderate understanding, to make this conduct easy: and I do not\r\ndoubt it has been practised by many prudes beside her I am now speaking\r\nof. You may be sure I did not communicate these reflections. The first\r\nword I spoke was to desire Signer Carlo to sheathe his poniard, not\r\nbeing pleased with its glittering! He did so very readily, begging my\r\npardon for not having done it on my first appearance, saying he did not\r\nknow what he did, and indeed he had the countenance and gesture of a man\r\ndistracted. I did not endeavour a defence; that seemed to me impossible;\r\nbut represented to him, as well as I could, the crime of a murder, which,\r\nif he could justify before men, was still a crying sin before God; the\r\ndisgrace he would bring on himself and posterity, and irreparable injury\r\nhe would do his eldest daughter, a pretty girl of fifteen, that I knew\r\nhe was extremely fond of. I added, that if he thought it proper to part\r\nfrom his lady, he might easily find a pretext for it some months hence;\r\nand that it was as much his interest as hers to conceal this affair from\r\nthe knowledge of the world. I could not presently make him taste these\r\nreasons, and was forced to stay there near five hours (almost from five\r\nto ten at night) before I durst leave them together, which I would not\r\ndo till he had sworn in the most serious manner he would make no future\r\nattempt on her life. I was content with his oath, knowing him to be very\r\ndevout, and found I was not mistaken. How the matter was made up between\r\nthem afterwards I know not; but it is now two years since it happened,\r\nand all appearances remaining as if it had never been. The secret is in\r\nvery few hands; his brother, being at that time at Brescia, I believe\r\nknows nothing of it to this day. The chambermaid and myself have preserved\r\nthe strictest silence, and the lady retains the satisfaction of insulting\r\nall her acquaintance on the foundation of a spotless character, that only\r\nshe can boast in the parish, where she is most heartily hated, from these\r\nairs of impertinent virtue, and another very essential reason, being the\r\nbest dressed woman among them, though one of the plainest in her figure.\r\n\r\n\"The discretion of the chambermaid in fetching me, which possibly saved\r\nher mistress's life, and her taciturnity since, I fancy appear very\r\nremarkable to you, and is what would certainly never happen in England.\r\nThe first part of her behaviour deserves great praise; coming of her own\r\naccord, and inventing so decent an excuse for her admittance: but her\r\nsilence may be attributed to her knowing very well that any servant that\r\npresumes to talk of his master will most certainly be incapable of\r\ntalking at all in a short time, their lives being entirely in the power\r\nof their superiors: I do not mean by law but by custom, which has full\r\nas much force. If one of them was killed, it would either never be\r\ninquired into at all, or very slightly passed over; yet it seldom\r\nhappens, and I know no instance of it, which I think is owing to the\r\ngreat submission of domestics, who are sensible of their dependence, and\r\nthe national temper not being hasty, and never inflamed by wine,\r\ndrunkenness being a vice abandoned to the vulgar, and spoke of with\r\ngreater detestation than murder, which is mentioned with as little\r\nconcern as a drinking-bout in England, and is almost as frequent. It was\r\nextreme shocking to me at my first coming, and still gives me a sort of\r\nhorror, though custom has in some degree familiarised it to my\r\nimagination. Robbery would be pursued with great vivacity, and punished\r\nwith the utmost rigour, therefore is very rare, though stealing is in\r\ndaily practice; but as all the peasants are suffered the use of\r\nfire-arms, the slightest provocation is sufficient to shoot, and they\r\nsee one of their own species lie dead before them with as little remorse\r\nas a hare or a partridge, and, when revenge spurs them on, with much\r\nmore pleasure. A dissertation on this subject would engage me in a\r\ndiscourse not proper for the post.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary, being a prolific letter-writer, came under the suspicions of\r\nthe Italian authorities, who carefully examined the correspondence--a\r\nfact that was only by a chance conversation revealed to her. \"I think I\r\nnow know why our correspondence is so miserably interrupted, and so many\r\nof my letters lost to and from England,\" she wrote to her husband in\r\nOctober, 1753; \"but I am no happier in the discovery than a man who has\r\nfound out his complaints proceed from a stone in the kidneys; I know the\r\ncause, but am entirely ignorant of the remedy, and must suffer my\r\nuneasiness with what patience I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"An old priest made me a visit as I was folding my last packet to my\r\ndaughter. Observing it to be large, he told me I had done a great deal of\r\nbusiness that morning. I made answer, I had done no business at all; I\r\nhad only wrote to my daughter on family affairs, or such trifles as make\r\nup women's conversation. He said gravely, people like your Excellenza\r\ndo not use to write long letters upon trifles. I assured him, that if he\r\nunderstood English, I would let him read my letter. He replied, with a\r\nmysterious smile, if I did understand English, I should not understand\r\nwhat you have written, except you would give me the key, which I durst\r\nnot presume to ask. What key? (said I, staring) there is not one cypher\r\nbesides the date. He answered, cyphers were only used by novices in\r\npolitics, and it was very easy to write intelligibly, under feigned\r\nnames of persons and places, to a correspondent, in such a manner as\r\nshould be almost impossible to be understood by anybody else.\r\n\r\n\"Thus I suppose my innocent epistles are severely scrutinized; and when\r\nI talk of my grandchildren, they are fancied to represent all the\r\npotentates of Europe. This is very provoking. I confess there are good\r\nreasons for extraordinary caution at this juncture; but 'tis very hard I\r\ncannot pass for being as insignificant as I really am.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary clearly was happy in Italy, and did not in the least hanker\r\nafter the delights of London society, which in her earlier days she had\r\nso much enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By the account you give me of London, I think it very much reformed; at\r\nleast you have one sin the less, and it was a very reigning one in my\r\ntime, I mean scandal: it must be literally reduced to a whisper, since\r\nthe custom of living all together. I hope it has also banished the\r\nfashion of talking all at once, which was very prevailing when I was in\r\ntown, and may perhaps contribute to brotherly love and unity, which was\r\nso much declined in my memory, that it was hard to invite six people\r\nthat would not, by cold looks, or piquing reflections affront one\r\nanother. I suppose parties are at an end, though I fear it is the\r\nconsequence of the old almanac prophecy, \"Poverty brings peace\"; and I\r\nfancy you really follow the French mode, and the lady keeps an assembly,\r\nthat the assembly may keep the lady, and card money pay for clothes and\r\nequipage as well as cards and candles. I find I should be as solitary in\r\nLondon as I am here in the country, it being impossible for me to submit\r\nto live in a _drum_, which I think so far from a cure of uneasiness,\r\nthat it is, in my opinion, adding one more to the heap. There are so\r\nmany attached to humanity, 'tis impossible to fly from them all; but\r\nexperience has confirmed to me what I always thought, that the pursuit\r\nof pleasure will be ever attended with pain, and the study of ease be\r\nmost certainly accompanied with pleasures. I have had this morning as\r\nmuch delight in a walk in the sun as ever I felt formerly in the crowded\r\nMall, even when I imagined I had my share of the admiration of the place,\r\nwhich was generally soured before I slept by the informations of my\r\nfemale friends, who seldom failed to tell me, it was observed, I had\r\nshowed an inch above my shoe-heels, or some other criticism of equal\r\nweight, which was construed affectation, and utterly destroyed all the\r\nsatisfaction my vanity had given me. I have now no other but in my little\r\nhouswifery, which is easily gratified in this country, where, by the help\r\nof my receipt-book, I make a very shining figure among my neighbours, by\r\nthe introduction of custards, cheesecakes, and minced pies, which were\r\nentirely unknown to these parts, and are received with universal\r\napplause; and I have reason to believe will preserve my memory even to\r\nfuture ages, particularly by the art of butter-making, in which I have\r\nso improved them, that they now make as good as in any part of England.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary made the acquaintance in 1758 of Sir James Steuart,[20] and\r\nhis wife, Lady Frances, the eldest daughter of the Earl of Wemyss and\r\nsister of the Jacobite Lord Elcho. Steuart, when making the grand\r\ntour, had met the exiled Stuarts at Rome, and had become attached to\r\ntheir cause. When the Young Pretender landed in Scotland in 1745,\r\nSteuart threw in his lot with him. On his master's business he went to\r\nParis, and was abroad when Culloden was fought. When an Act of Oblivion\r\nwas passed in 1748 he was exempted by name, and, therefore, his return\r\nwas at the time impossible. He and his wife wandered about the\r\nContinent, and it was at Venice that they encountered Lady Mary, who was\r\ndelighted with them. \"I was charmed to find a man of uncommon sense and\r\nlearning, and a lady that without beauty is more admirable than the\r\nfairest of her sex,\" she wrote enthusiastically to her daughter. \"I\r\noffered them all the little good offices in my power, and invited them\r\nto supper; upon which our wise Minister[21] has discovered that I am in\r\nthe interest of popery and slavery. As he has often said the same thing\r\nof Mr. Pitt, it would give me no mortification, if I did not apprehend\r\nthat his fertile imagination may support this wise idea by such\r\ncircumstances as may influence those that do not know me. It is very\r\nremarkable that after having suffered all the rage of that party at\r\nAvignon for my attachment to the present reigning family, I should be\r\naccused here of favouring rebellion, when I hoped all our odious\r\ndiversions were forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Sir James Steuart (1712-1780), in 1773, on inheriting an\r\nestate from a relative, took the additional surname of Denham. He was\r\nthe author of works on currency and political economy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The British Resident at Venice at this time was John\r\nMurray]\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary was anxious that nothing she did should reflect upon her\r\ndaughter or in any way affect Lord Bute. \"I am afraid you may think\r\nsome imprudent behaviour of mine has occasioned all this ridiculous\r\npersecution [by the Resident]\" she wrote to them in May, 1758. \"I can\r\nassure you I have always treated him and his family with the utmost\r\ncivility, and am now retired to Padua, to avoid the comments that will\r\ncertainly be made on his extraordinary conduct towards me. I only desire\r\nprivacy and quiet, and am very well contented to be without visits,\r\nwhich oftener disturb than amuse me. My single concern is the design he\r\nhas formed of securing (as he calls it) my effects immediately on my\r\ndecease; if they ever fall into his hands, I am persuaded they will\r\nnever arrive entire into yours, which is a very uneasy thought to me.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough not primarily interested in politics, Lady Mary had met so many\r\npoliticians that she was naturally eager to hear what was going on, and\r\nthe fact that her son-in-law, Lord Bute, was active in that department\r\nof life made her follow ministerial events in England so closely as\r\npossible. \"I stay here, though I am on many accounts better pleased with\r\nPadua,\" she wrote to her daughter from Venice, January 20, 1758. \"Our\r\ngreat minister, the Resident, treats me as one of the Opposition. I am\r\ninclined to laugh rather than be displeased at his political airs; yet,\r\nas I am among strangers they are disagreeable; and, could I have\r\nforeseen them, would have settled in some other part of the world: but I\r\nhave taken leases of my houses, been at much pains and expense in\r\nfurnishing them, and am no longer of an age to make long journeys.\"\r\n\r\nPitt's Coalition Ministry, formed in June, 1757, in which Pitt and Lord\r\nHoldernesse were Secretaries of State, the Duke of Newcastle First Lord\r\nof the Treasury, Legge Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord Granville,\r\nLord Temple, Sir Robert Henley, the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of\r\nBedford, and Henry Fox held office, moved Lady Mary to merriment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your account of the changes in ministerial affairs do not surprise me;\r\nbut nothing could be more astonishing than their all coming together\"\r\n(she wrote to Lady Bute). \"It puts me in mind of a friend of mine who\r\nhad a large family of favourite animals; and not knowing how to convey\r\nthem to his country-house in separate equipages, he ordered a Dutch\r\nmastiff, a cat and her kittens, a monkey, and a parrot, all to be packed\r\nup together in one large hamper, and sent by a waggon. One may easily\r\nguess how this set of company made their journey; and I have never been\r\nable to think of the present compound ministry without the idea of\r\nbarking, scratching, and screaming. 'Tis too ridiculous a one, I own,\r\nfor the gravity of their characters, and still more for the situation the\r\nkingdom is in; for as much as one may encourage the love of laughter,\r\n'tis impossible to be indifferent to the welfare of one's native\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Resident was, so far as Lady Mary was concerned, an ill-conditioned\r\nfellow. She asked him once or twice for the English papers, but the\r\nreply made, with intention, on each occasion was that they were engaged.\r\n\"Since the Ministry of Mr. Pitt,\" she remarked, \"he is so desirous to\r\nsignalise his zeal for the contrary faction, he is perpetually saying\r\nridiculous things, to manifest his attachment; and as he looks upon me\r\n(nobody knows why) to be the friend of a man I never saw, he has not\r\nvisited me once this winter. The misfortune is not great.\" Lady Mary was\r\namused at being mistaken for a politician. \"I have often been so, though\r\nI ever thought politics so far removed from my sphere. I cannot accuse\r\nmyself of dabbling in them, even when I heard them talked over in all\r\ncompanies; but, as the old song says,\r\n\r\n  'Tho' through the wide world we should range,\r\n  'Tis in vain from our fortune to fly.'\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary always cherished affection and respect for her son-in-law,\r\nLord Bute. He had been since 1747 a favourite with Frederick, Prince of\r\nWales, who in 1750 appointed him a Lord of his Bedchamber. When\r\nFrederick died in the following year Bute had established his popularity\r\nwith the Princess, who, in 1756, secured his appointment as Groom of the\r\nStole. \"I have something to mention that I believe will be agreeable to\r\nyou,\" Edward Wortley Montagu wrote to his wife at this time; \"I mean\r\nsome particulars relating to Lord Bute. He stood higher in the Prince of\r\nWales's favour than any man. His attendance was frequent at Leicester\r\nHouse, where this young Prince has resided, and since his father's death\r\nhas continued without intermission, till new officers were to be placed\r\nunder him. It is said that another person was to be Groom of the Stole,\r\nbut that the Prince's earnest request was complied with in my Lord's\r\nfavour. It is supposed that the governors, preceptors, etc., who were\r\nabout him before will now be set aside, and that my Lord is now the\r\nprincipal adviser.\" Neither Montagu nor his wife in their published\r\ncorrespondence make any allusion to the scandal current about the\r\nintimate relations of the Princess and Lord Bute, though it was so\r\nwidely spread it is almost impossible it should not have come to the\r\nears of one or other of them.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of George III Bute was sworn a member of the Privy\r\nCouncil, and in November, 1760, appointed Groom of the Stole and First\r\nGentleman of the Bedchamber. His influence with the young King was\r\nparamount. \"I pity Lady Bute,\" Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann on\r\nJanuary 27, 1761, \"her mother will sell to whoever does not know her,\r\nall kinds of promises and reversions, bestow lies gratis and wholesale,\r\nand make so much mischief, that they will be forced to discard her in\r\nthree months, which will go to Lady Bute's heart, who is one of the best\r\nand most sensible women in the world; and who, educated by such a\r\nmother, has never made a false step.\" As a matter of fact, the only\r\nrequest known to be made by Lady Mary was to ask Lord Bute, through her\r\ndaughter, to take care that Sir James Steuart's name was not excluded in\r\nthe Act of Indemnity. It is, however, true that there is the following\r\nstatement in the Diaries of the Right Hon. William Windham, under the\r\ndate of November 25, 1772, which is given here for what it is worth.\r\n\"Mr. Montagu told me this evening about Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, that\r\nat her death, 'A note of his was found among her papers for one thousand\r\nguineas,' which had been given her by a gentleman of Ireland as the\r\npremium for some honours to be received through her interest. The\r\nhonours stipulated for were not obtained before her death, and the\r\ngentleman upon representation of the story to the family recovered the\r\nnote which she had deposited by agreement in a particular drawer shewn\r\nto him. It may reasonably be supposed that this was not the first\r\ninstance of her accepting money on those conditions, and that much of\r\nLord Bute's interest has been employed in her service.\"\r\n\r\nAs Lady Mary advanced in the sixties of her life, she looked upon the\r\nworld with the eyes of a vast experience, and found it more sad than she\r\nhad thought it in youth or middle age. _Vanitas vanitatum_ was the text\r\nof many a homily that she delivered, and a certain sadness replaced the\r\nsense of malice that had once possessed her. Once more than aggressive,\r\nnow she had had bestowed upon her in some degree that gift of\r\nunderstanding that engenders sympathy. As she grew older she grew more\r\nwise, and was anxious to impart her wisdom, especially to her daughter,\r\nfor her benefit or for that of her daughter's children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How important is the charge of youth! and how useless all the\r\nadvantages of nature and fortune without a well-turned mind! I have\r\nlately heard of a very shining instance of this truth, from two\r\ngentlemen (very deserving ones they seem to be) who have had the\r\ncuriosity to travel into Moscovy, and now return to England with Mr.\r\nArcher. I inquired after my old acquaintance Sir Charles [Hanbury]\r\nWilliams, who I hear is much broken, both in spirits and constitution.\r\nHow happy that man might have been, if there had been added to his\r\nnatural and acquired endowments a dash of morality! If he had known how\r\nto distinguish between false and true felicity; and, instead of seeking\r\nto increase an estate already too large, and hunting after pleasures\r\nthat have made him rotten and ridiculous, he had bounded his desires of\r\nwealth, and follow the dictates of his conscience. His servile ambition\r\nhas gained him two yards of red ribbon, and an exile into a miserable\r\ncountry, where there is no society and so little taste, that I believe\r\nhe suffers under a dearth of flatterers. This is said for the use of\r\nyour growing sons, whom I hope no golden temptations will induce to\r\nmarry women they cannot love, or comply with measures they do not\r\napprove. All the happiness this world can afford is more within reach\r\nthan is generally supposed. Whoever seeks pleasure will undoubtedly find\r\npain; whoever will pursue ease will as certainly find pleasures. The\r\nworld's esteem is the highest gratification of human vanity; and that is\r\nmore easily obtained in a moderate fortune than an overgrown one, which\r\nis seldom possessed, never gained, without envy. I say esteem; for, as\r\nto applause, it is a youthful pursuit, never to be forgiven after twenty,\r\nand naturally succeeds the childish desire of catching the setting sun,\r\nwhich I can remember running very hard to do: a fine thing truly if it\r\ncould be caught; but experience soon shows it to be impossible. A wise\r\nand honest man lives to his own heart, without that silly splendour that\r\nmakes him a prey to knaves, and which commonly ends in his becoming one\r\nof the fraternity. I am very glad to hear Lord Bute's decent economy sets\r\nhim above anything of that kind. I wish it may become national. A\r\ncollective body of men differs very little from a single man; frugality\r\nis the foundation of generosity. I have often been complimented on the\r\nEnglish heroism, who have thrown away so many millions, without any\r\nprospect of advantage to themselves, purely to succour a distressed\r\nprincess. I never could hear these praises without some impatience; they\r\nsounded to me like panegyrics made by the dependents on the Duke of\r\nNewcastle and poor Lord Oxford, bubbled when they were commended, and\r\nlaughed at when undone. Some late events will, I hope, open our eyes: we\r\nshall see we are an island, and endeavour to extend our commerce rather\r\nthan the Quixote reputation of redressing wrongs and placing diadems on\r\nheads that should be equally indifferent to us. When time has ripened\r\nmankind into common sense, the name of conqueror will be an odious title.\r\nI could easily prove that, had the Spaniards established a trade with the\r\nAmericans, they would have enriched their country more than by the\r\naddition of twenty-two kingdoms, and all the mines they now work--I do\r\nnot say possess; since, though they are the proprietors, others enjoy the\r\nprofit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMary's letters at this period of her life are so entertaining that a few\r\nmay well be inserted here for the sheer pleasure of reading them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNTESS OF BUTE\r\n\r\n\"Padua, September 30, 1757.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Bute has been so obliging as to let me know your safe delivery,\r\nand the birth of another daughter; may she be as meritorious in your\r\neyes as you are in mine! I can wish nothing better to you both, though I\r\nhave some reproaches to make you. Daughter! daughter! don't call names;\r\nyou are always abusing my pleasures, which is what no mortal will bear.\r\nTrash, lumber, sad stuff, are the titles you give to my favourite\r\namusement. If I called a white staff a stick of wood, a gold key gilded\r\nbrass, and the ensigns of illustrious orders coloured strings, this may\r\nbe philosophically true, but would be very ill received. We have all our\r\nplaythings: happy are they that can be contented with those they can\r\nobtain: those hours are spent in the wisest manner, that can easiest\r\nshade the ills of life, and are lest productive of ill consequences. I\r\nthink my time better employed in reading the adventures of imaginary\r\npeople, than the Duchess of Marlborough's, who passed the latter years\r\nof her life in paddling with her will, and contriving schemes of\r\nplaguing some, and extracting praise from others, to no purpose;\r\neternally disappointed, and eternally fretting. The active scenes are\r\nover at my age. I indulge, with all the art I can, my taste for reading.\r\nIf I would confine it to valuable books, they are almost as rare as\r\nvaluable men. I must be content with what I can find. As I approach a\r\nsecond childhood, I endeavour to enter into the pleasures of it. Your\r\nyoungest son is, perhaps, at this very moment riding on a poker with\r\ngreat delight, not at all regretting that it is not a gold one, and much\r\nless wishing it an Arabian horse, which he would not know how to manage.\r\nI am reading an idle tale, not expecting wit or truth in it, and am very\r\nglad it is not metaphysics to puzzle my judgment, or history to mislead\r\nmy opinion. He fortifies his health by exercise; I calm my cares by\r\noblivion. The methods may appear low to busy people; but, if he improves\r\nhis strength, and I forget my infirmities, we attain very desirable ends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo THE COUNTESS OF BUTE\r\n\r\n\"Venice, November 8, 1758.\r\n\r\n\"... Some few months before Lord W. Hamilton married, there appeared a\r\nfoolish song, said to be wrote by a poetical great lady, who I really\r\nthink was the character of Lady Arabella, in _The Female Quixote_\r\n(without the beauty): you may imagine such a conduct, at court, made her\r\nsuperlatively ridiculous. Lady Delawarr, a woman of great merit, with\r\nwhom I lived in much intimacy, showed this fine performance to me: we\r\nwere very merry in supposing what answer Lord William would make to\r\nthese passionate addresses; she begged me to say something for a poor\r\nman, who had nothing to say for himself. I wrote, _extempore_, on the\r\nback of the song, some stanzas that went perfectly well to the tune. She\r\npromised they should never appear as mine, and faithfully kept her word.\r\nBy what accident they have fallen into the hands of that thing Dodsley,\r\nI know not, but he has printed them as addressed, by me, to a very\r\ncontemptible puppy, and my own words as his answer. I do not believe\r\neither Job or Socrates ever had such a provocation. You will tell me, it\r\ncannot hurt me with any acquaintance I ever had: it is true; but it is\r\nan excellent piece of scandal for the same sort of people that\r\npropagate, with success, that your nurse left her estate, husband, and\r\nfamily, to go with me to England; and, then I turned her to starve,\r\nafter defrauding her of God knows what. I thank God witches are out of\r\nfashion, or I should expect to have it deposed, by several credible\r\nwitnesses, that I had been seen flying through the air on a broomstick,\r\n&c. I am really sick with vexation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SIR JAMES STEUART\r\n\r\n\"Venice, November 14, 1758.\r\n\r\n\"This letter will be solely to you, and I desire you will not\r\ncommunicate it to Lady Fanny: she is the best woman in the world, and I\r\nwould by no means make her uneasy; but there will be such strange things\r\nin it that the Talmud or the Revelations are not half so mysterious:\r\nwhat these prodigies portend, God knows; but I never should have\r\nsuspected half the wonders I see before my eyes, and am convinced of the\r\nnecessity of the repeal of the witch act (as it is commonly called), I\r\nmean, to speak correctly, the tacit permission given to witches, so\r\nscandalous to all good Christians: though I tremble to think of it for\r\nmy own interests. It is certain the British islands have always been\r\nstrangely addicted to this diabolical intercourse, of which I dare swear\r\nyou know many instances; but since this public encouragement given to\r\nit, I am afraid there will not be an old woman in the nation entirely\r\nfree from suspicion. The devil rages more powerfully than ever: you will\r\nbelieve me, when I assure you the great and learned English minister is\r\nturned methodist, several duels have been fought in the Place of St.\r\nMarc for the charms of his excellent lady, and I have been seen flying\r\nin the air in the figure of Julian Cox, which history is related with so\r\nmuch candour and truth by the pious pen of Joseph Glanville, chaplain to\r\nK. Charles. I know you young rakes make a jest of all those things, but\r\nI think no good lady can doubt of a relation so well attested. She was\r\nabout seventy years old (very near my age), and the whole sworn to\r\nbefore Judge Archer, 1663: very well worth reading, but rather too long\r\nfor a letter. You know (wretch that I am) 'tis one of my wicked maxims\r\nto make the best of a bad bargain; and I have said publicly that every\r\nperiod of life has its privileges, and that even the most despicable\r\ncreatures alive may find some pleasures. Now observe this comment; who\r\nare the most despicable creatures? Certainly, old women. What pleasure\r\ncan an old woman take? Only witchcraft. I think this argument as clear\r\nas any of the devout Bishop of Cloyne's metaphysics: this being decided\r\nin a full congregation of saints, only such atheists as you and Lady\r\nFanny can deny it. I own all the facts, as many witches have done before\r\nme, and go every night in a public manner astride upon a black cat to a\r\nmeeting where you are suspected to appear: this last article is not\r\nsworn to, it being doubtful in what manner our clandestine midnight\r\ncorrespondence is carried on. Some think it treasonable, others lewd\r\n(don't tell Lady Fanny); but all agree there was something very odd and\r\nunaccountable in such sudden likings. I confess, as I said before, it is\r\nwitchcraft. You won't wonder I do not sign (notwithstanding all my\r\nimpudence) such dangerous truths: who knows the consequence? The devil\r\nis said to desert his votaries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo SIR JAMES STEUART\r\n\r\n\"Venice, January 13, 1759.\r\n\r\n\"I have indulged myself some time with day-dreams of the happiness I\r\nhope to enjoy this summer in the conversation of Lady Fanny and Sir\r\nJames S.; but I hear such frightful stories of precipices and hovels\r\nduring the whole journey, I begin to fear there is no such pleasure\r\nallotted me in the book of fate: the Alps were once molehills in my\r\nsight when they interposed between me and the slightest inclination; now\r\nage begins to freeze, and brings with it the usual train of melancholy\r\napprehensions. Poor human-kind! We always march blindly on; the fire of\r\nyouth represents to us all our wishes possible; and, that over, we fall\r\ninto despondency that prevents even easy enterprises: a store in winter,\r\na garden in summer, bounds all our desires, or at least our undertakings.\r\nIf Mr. Steuart would disclose all his imaginations, I dare swear he has\r\nsome thoughts of emulating Alexander or Demosthenes, perhaps both:\r\nnothing seems difficult at his time of life, everything at name. I am\r\nvery unwilling, but am afraid I must submit to the confinement of my\r\nboat and my easy-chair, and go no farther than they can carry me. Why\r\nare our views so extensive and our powers so miserably limited? This\r\nis among the mysteries which (as you justly say) will remain ever\r\nunfolded to our shallow capacities. I am much inclined to think we are\r\nno more free agents than the queen of clubs when she victoriously takes\r\nprisoner the knave of hearts; and all our efforts (when we rebel against\r\ndestiny) as weak as a card that sticks to a glove when the gamester is\r\ndetermined to throw it on the table. Let us then (which is the only true\r\nphilosophy) be contented with our chance, and make the best of that bad\r\nbargain of being born in this vile planet; where we may find, however\r\n(God be thanked), much to laugh at, though little to approve.\r\n\r\n\"I confess I delight extremely in looking on men in that light. How many\r\nthousands trample under foot honour, ease, and pleasure, in pursuit of\r\nribands of certain colours, dabs of embroidery on their clothes, and\r\ngilt wood carved behind their coaches in a particular figure? Others\r\nbreaking their hearts till they are distinguished by the shape and\r\ncolour of their hats; and, in general, all people earnestly seeking what\r\nthey do not want, while they neglect the real blessings in their\r\npossession--I mean the innocent gratification of their senses, which is\r\nall we can properly call our own. For my part, I will endeavour to\r\ncomfort myself for the cruel disappointment I find in renouncing\r\nTubingen, by eating some fresh oysters on the table. I hope you are\r\nsitting down with dear Lady F. to some admirable red partridges, which I\r\nthink are the growth of that country. Adieu! Live happy, and be not\r\nunmindful of your sincere distant friend, who will remember you in the\r\ntenderest manner while there is any such faculty as memory in the\r\nmachine called.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo THE COUNTESS OF BUTE\r\n\r\n\"Venice, May 22, 1759.\r\n\r\n\"... Building is the general weakness of old people; I have had a twitch\r\nof it myself, though certainly it is the highest absurdity, and as sure\r\na proof of dotage as pink-coloured ribands, or even matrimony. Nay,\r\nperhaps, there is more to be said in defence of the last; I mean in a\r\nchildless old man; he may prefer a boy born in his own house, though he\r\nknows it is not his own, to disrespectful or worthless nephews or\r\nnieces. But there is no excuse for beginning an edifice he can never\r\ninhabit, or probably see finished. The Duchess of Marlborough used to\r\nridicule the vanity of it, by saying one might always live upon other\r\npeople's follies: yet you see she built the most ridiculous house I ever\r\nsaw, since it really is not habitable, from the excessive damps; so true\r\nit is, the things that we would do, those do we not, and the things we\r\nwould not do, those do we daily. I feel in myself a proof of this\r\nassertion, being much against my will at Venice, though I own it is the\r\nonly great town where I can properly reside, yet here I find so many\r\nvexations, that, in spite of all my philosophy and (what is more\r\npowerful) my phlegm, I am oftener out of humour than among my plants and\r\npoultry in the country. I cannot help being concerned at the success of\r\niniquitous schemes, and grieve for oppressed merit. You, who see these\r\nthings every day, think me as unreasonable, in making them matter of\r\ncomplaint, as if I seriously lamented the change of seasons. You should\r\nconsider I have lived almost a hermit ten years, and the world is as new\r\nto me as to a country girl transported from Wales to Coventry. I know I\r\nought to think my lot very good, that can boast of some sincere friends\r\namong strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOld age will, in the long run, have its way. Lady Mary, as pleasantly\r\nloquacious as ever, found the manual labour of writing not always to be\r\nendured, and she tried the experiment of dictating her correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thus far\" (she wrote to Sir James Steuart from Padua, July 19, 1759),\r\n\"I have dictated for the first time of my life, and perhaps it will be\r\nthe last, for my amanuensis is not to be hired, and I despair of ever\r\nmeeting with another. He is the first that could write as fast as I\r\ntalk, and yet you see there are so many mistakes, it wants a comment\r\nlonger than my letter to explain my insignificant meaning, and I have\r\nfatigued my poor eyes more with correcting it, than I should have done\r\nin scribbling two sheets of paper. You will think, perhaps, from this\r\nidle attempt, that I have some fluxion on my sight; no such matter; I\r\nhave suffered myself to be persuaded by such sort of arguments as those\r\nby which people are induced to strict abstinence, or to take physic.\r\nFear, paltry fear, founded on vapours rising from the heat, which is now\r\nexcessive, and has so far debilitated my miserable nerves that I submit\r\nto a present displeasure, by way of precaution against a future evil,\r\nthat possibly may never happen. I have this to say in my excuse, that\r\nthe evil is of so horrid a nature, I own I feel no philosophy that could\r\nsupport me under it, and no mountain girl ever trembled more at one of\r\nWhitfield's pathetic lectures than I do at the word blindness, though I\r\nknow all the fine things that may be said for consolation in such a case:\r\nbut I know, also, they would not operate on my constitution. 'Why, then'\r\n(say my wise monitors), 'will you persist in reading or writing seven\r\nhours in a day?' 'I am happy while I read and write.' 'Indeed, one would\r\nsuffer a great deal to be happy,' say the men, sneering; and the ladies\r\nwink at each other, and hold up their fans. A fine lady of three score\r\nhad the goodness to add, 'At least, madam, you should use spectacles; I\r\nhave used them myself these twenty years; I was advised to it by a famous\r\noculist when I was fifteen. I am really of opinion that they have\r\npreserved my sight, notwithstanding the passion I always had both for\r\nreading and drawing.' This good woman, you must know, is half blind, and\r\nnever read a larger volume than a newspaper. I will not trouble you with\r\nthe whole conversation, though it would make an excellent scene in a\r\nfarce; but after they had in the best bred way in the world convinced me\r\nthat they thought I lied when I talked of reading without glasses, the\r\nforesaid matron obligingly said she should be very proud to see the\r\nwriting I talked of, having heard me say formerly I had no correspondents\r\nbut my daughter and Mr. Wortley. She was interrupted by her sister, who\r\nsaid, simpering, 'You forgot Sir J.S.' I took her up something short, I\r\nconfess, and said in a dry stern tone, 'Madam, I do write to Sir J.S. and\r\nwill do it as long as he will permit that honour.' This rudeness of mine\r\noccasioned a profound silence for some minutes, and they fell into a\r\ngood-natured discourse of the ill consequences of too much application,\r\nand remembered how many apoplexies, gouts, and dropsies had happened\r\namongst the hard students of their acquaintance. As I never studied\r\nanything in my life, and have always (at least from fifteen) thought the\r\nreputation of learning a misfortune to a woman, I was resolved to believe\r\nthese stories were not meant at me: I grew silent in my turn, and took up\r\na card that lay on a table, and amused myself with smoking it over a\r\ncandle. In the mean time (as the song says),\r\n\r\n  'Their tattles all run, as swift as the sun,\r\n   Of who had won, and who was undone\r\n     By their gaming and sitting up late,'\r\n\r\nWhen it was observed I entered into none of these topics, I was\r\naddressed by an obliging lady, who pitied my stupidity. 'Indeed, madam,\r\nyou should buy horses to that fine machine you have at Padua; of what\r\nuse is it standing in the portico?' 'Perhaps,' said another, wittily,\r\n'of as much use as a standing dish.' A gaping schoolboy added with still\r\nmore wit, 'I have seen at a country gentleman's table a venison-pasty\r\nmade of wood.' I was not at all vexed by said schoolboy, not because he\r\nwas (in more senses than one) the highest of the company, but knowing he\r\ndid not mean to offend me. I confess (to my shame be it spoken) I was\r\ngrieved at the triumph that appeared in the eyes of the king and queen\r\nof the company, the court being tolerably full. His majesty walked off\r\nearly with the air befitting his dignity, followed by his train of\r\ncourtiers, who, like courtiers, were laughing amongst themselves as they\r\nfollowed him: and I was left with the two queens, one of whom was making\r\nruffles for the man she loved, and the other slopping tea for the good\r\nof her country. They renewed their generous endeavours to set me right,\r\nand I (graceless beast that I am) take up the smoked card which lay\r\nbefore me, and with the corner of another wrote--\r\n\r\n  If ever I one thought bestow\r\n    On what such fools advise,\r\n  May I be dull enough to grow\r\n    Most miserably wise.\r\n\r\nAnd flung down the card on the table, and myself out of the room, in the\r\nmost indecent fury. A few minutes on the cold water convinced me of my\r\nfolly, and I went home as much mortified as my Lord E. when he has lost\r\nhis last stake at hazard. Pray don't think (if you can help it) this is\r\nan affectation of mine to enhance the value of a talent I would be\r\nthought to despise; as celebrated beauties often talk of the charms of\r\ngood sense, having some reason to fear their mental qualities are not\r\nquite so conspicuous as their outside lovely form.--_À propos_ of\r\nbeauties:\r\n\r\n  I know not why, but Heaven has sent this way\r\n  A nymph, fair, kind, poetical, and gay;\r\n  And what is more (tho' I express it dully),\r\n  A noble, wise, right honourable cully:\r\n  A soldier worthy of the name he bears,\r\n  As brave and senseless as the sword he wears.\r\n\r\n\"You will not doubt I am talking of a puppet-show; and indeed so I am;\r\nbut the figures (some of them) bigger than the life, and not stuffed\r\nwith straw like those commonly shown at fairs. I will allow you to think\r\nme madder than Don Quixote when I confess I am governed by the\r\n_que-dira-t-on_ of these things, though I remember whereof they are\r\nmade, and know they are but dust. Nothing vexes me so much as that they\r\nare below satire. (Between you and me) I think there are but two\r\npleasures permitted to mortal man, love and vengeance; both which are,\r\nin a peculiar manner, forbidden to us wretches who are condemned to\r\npetticoats. Even vanity itself, of which you daily accuse us, is the sin\r\nagainst the Holy Ghost not to be forgiven in this world or the next.\r\n\r\n  Our sex's weakness you expose and blame,\r\n  Of every prating fop the common theme;\r\n  Yet from this weakness you suppose is due\r\n  Sublimer virtue than your Cato knew.\r\n  From whence is this unjust distinction shown?\r\n  Are we not formed with passions like your own?\r\n  Nature with equal fire our souls endued:\r\n  Our minds as lofty, and as warm our blood.\r\n  O'er the wide world your wishes you pursue,\r\n  The change is justified by something new,\r\n  But we must sigh in silence and be true.\r\n\r\n\"How the great Dr. Swift would stare at this vile triplet! And then what\r\nbusiness have I to make apologies for Lady Vane, whom I never spoke to,\r\nbecause her life is writ by Dr. Smollett, whom I never saw? Because my\r\ndaughter fell in love with Lord Bute, am I obliged to fall in love with\r\nthe whole Scots nation? 'Tis certain I take their quarrels upon myself\r\nin a very odd way; and I cannot deny that (two or three dozen excepted)\r\nI think they make the first figure in all arts and sciences; even in\r\ngallantry, in spite of the finest gentlemen that have finished their\r\neducation at Paris.\r\n\r\n\"You will ask me what I mean by all this nonsense, after having declared\r\nmyself an enemy to obscurity to such a degree that I do not forgive it\r\nto the great Lord Viscount Bolingbroke, who professes he studied it. I\r\ndare swear you will sincerely believe him when you read his celebrated\r\nworks. I have got them for you, and intend to bring them. _Oime!\r\nl'huomo. propone, Dio dispone_. I hope you won't think this dab of\r\nItalian, that slid involuntarily from my pen, an affectation like his\r\nGallicisms, or a rebellion against Providence, in imitation of his\r\nlordship, who I never saw but once in my life: he then appeared in a\r\ncorner of the drawing-room, in the exact similitude of Satan when he was\r\nsoliciting the court of Heaven for leave to torment an honest man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nLAST YEARS (1760-1762)\r\n\r\nLady Mary writes the history of her own times--Her health--Death of\r\nEdward Wortley Montagu--His will--Lady Mary ponders the idea of\r\nreturning to England--She leaves Italy--She is held up at Rotterdam--She\r\nreaches London--Horace Walpole visits her--Her last illness--Her\r\nfortitude--Her death--She leaves one guinea to her son.\r\n\r\nOne of Lady Mary's amusements towards the end of her life was writing\r\nthe history of her own time. \"It has been my fortune,\" she said, \"to\r\nhave a more exact knowledge both of the persons and facts that have made\r\nthe greatest figure in England in this age, than is common; and I take\r\npleasure in putting together what I know, with an impartiality that is\r\naltogether unusual. Distance of tie and place has totally blotted from\r\nmy mind all traces of resentment or prejudice; and I speak with the same\r\nindifference to the Court of Great Britain as I should do of that of\r\nAugustus Caesar.\" Lady Mary, however, merely wrote for her own\r\nentertainment, and burnt her manuscript almost as soon as it was\r\ncomposed. It would certainly have made interesting reading; but she\r\nnever had any idea of publication. \"I know mankind too well to think\r\nthey are capable of receiving the truth, much less of applauding it; or,\r\nwere it otherwise, applause to me is as insignificant as garlands on the\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am exceedingly glad of your father's good health: he owes it to his\r\nuncommon abstinence and resolution,\" Lady Mary wrote to her daughter,\r\nApril 11, 1759. \"I wish I could boast the same. I own I have too much\r\nindulged a sedentary humour and have been a rake in reading. You will\r\nlaugh at the expression, but I think the liberal meaning of the ugly\r\nword rake is one that follows his pleasures in contradiction to his\r\nreason. I thought mine so innocent I might pursue them with impunity. I\r\nnow find that I was mistaken, and that all excesses are (though not\r\nequally) blamable. My spirits in company are false fire: I have a damp\r\nwithin; from marshy grounds frequently arises an appearance of light. I\r\ngrow splenetic, and consequently ought to stop my pen, for fear of\r\nconveying the infection.\"\r\n\r\n\"My health is very precarious; may yours long continue and see the\r\nprosperity of your family. I bless God I have lived to see you so well\r\nestablished, and am ready to sing my _Nunc dimittis_ with pleasure,\"\r\nLady Mary wrote to her daughter in November, 1760; and early in the next\r\nyear she touched on the same subject in a letter to Sir James Steuart.\r\n\"I have not returned my thanks for your obliging letter so soon as both\r\nduty and inclination prompted me but I have had so severe a cold,\r\naccompanied with a weakness in my eyes, that I have been confined to my\r\nstove for many days.... I am preparing for my last and longest journey,\r\nand stand on the threshold of this dirty world, my several infirmities\r\nlike posthorses ready to hurry me away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in January, 1761, that Edward Wortley Montagu passed away at the\r\nage of eighty-three. He died at Wharncliffe, the family seat of the\r\nWortleys, where he had lived in a most miserly manner. He had only one\r\nluxury--tokay, of which he was passionately fond. He left a great\r\nfortune, the highest estimate of which was £1,350,000. Horace Walpole\r\nsaid the estate was worth £600,000. Walpole gives some particulars of\r\nthe legacies: \"To his son, on whom six hundred a-year was settled, the\r\nreversion of which he has sold, he gives £1,000 a-year for life, but not\r\nto descend to any children he may have by any of his many wives. To Lady\r\nMary, in lieu of dower, but which to be sure she will not accept,\r\ninstead of the thirds of such a fortune, £1,200 a-year; and after her to\r\ntheir son for life; and then the £1,200 and £1,000 to Lady Bute and to\r\nher second son; with £2,000 to each of her younger children; all the\r\nrest, in present, to Lady Bute, then to her second son, taking the name\r\nof Wortley, and in succession to all the rest of her children, which are\r\nnumerous; and after them to Lord Sandwich, to whom, in present, he\r\nleaves about £40,000. The son, you perceive, is not so well treated by\r\nhis own father as his companion Taaffe[22] is by the French Court, where\r\nhe lives, and is received on the best footing; so near is Fort l'Evêque\r\nto Versailles.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Theodore Taaffe, an Irish adventurer, who, with Edward\r\nWortley Montagu, was imprisoned in Fort l'Evêque, at Paris, for cheating\r\nat cards in 1751. The incident has been given in a pamphlet written by\r\nMontagu.]\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the death of her husband, Lady Mary bethought herself of\r\nreturning to England, from which she had been absent for more than a\r\nscore of years. She was seventy-two years old, and may well have thought\r\nthat her time, too, would soon come, and that she would like to die in\r\nher native country. Still, it was some time before she could bring\r\nherself to a decision to set out. She was delighted with the political\r\nsuccess of Lord Bute and pleased with her daughter's prosperity, but \"I\r\nam doubtful whether I will attempt to be a spectator of it,\" she\r\nconfided in Sir James Steuart in April. \"I have so many years indulged\r\nmy natural inclinations to solitude and reading, I am unwilling to\r\nreturn to crowds and bustle, which would be unavoidable in London. The\r\nfew friends I esteemed are now no more: the new set of people who fill\r\nthe stage at present are too indifferent to me even to raise my\r\ncuriosity.\" Also, as she said, she was beginning to feel the worst\r\neffects of age, blindness excepted, and was grown timorous and\r\nsuspicious.\r\n\r\nIt was no light thing for a woman of Lady Mary's age to voyage alone,\r\nexcept for a servant or two, from Venice to London. Yet her indomitable\r\nspirit came to her aid, and in the autumn of 1761 she left Italy. She\r\ntravelled by way of Augsberg and Frankfort to Rotterdam. The journey had\r\nbeen far from agreeable. \"I am dragging my ragged remnant of life to\r\nEngland,\" she wrote to Sir James Steuart on November 20. \"The wind and\r\ntide are against me; how far I have strength to struggle against both I\r\nknow not; that I am arrived here is as much a miracle as any in the\r\ngolden legend; and if I had foreseen half the difficulties I have met\r\nwith I should not certainly have had courage to undertake it.... I am\r\nnailed down here by a severe illness of my poor Marianne, who has not\r\nbeen able to endure the frights and fatigues that we have passed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, about three weeks later, Marianne had sufficiently recovered to\r\nmove on, Lady Mary was held up by a hard, impenetrable frost. The delay\r\nirked her, and she became somewhat depressed, and said that she was\r\ndubious, in her precarious state of health, whether she would arrive at\r\nher destination. At the beginning of the new year, she did actually make\r\na start, and got half way to Helvoet, and was obliged to turn back by\r\nthe mountains of sea that obstructed the passage. \"I have had so many\r\ndisappointments I can scarce entertain the flattering thought of\r\narriving in London,\" the poor lady complained; but she found comfort in\r\nthat \"It is uncommon at my age to have no distemper, and to retain all\r\nmy senses in their first degree of perfection.\" Later in the month she\r\narrived in London.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, who heard everything, had, of course, heard that Lady\r\nMary was returned to England, and in a letter of October 8, 1761,\r\nannounced her return, adding with a brutality unusual even in him: \"I\r\nhave not seen her yet, though they have not made her perform quarantine\r\nfor her own dirt.\" However, as he discovered shortly after, it was Lady\r\nMary Wrottisley, and not Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who had arrived.\r\n\r\nOf course, when Lady Mary had come to London, Walpole was one of the\r\nfirst to go and see her. \"I went last night to visit her,\" he wrote to\r\nSir Horace Mann on January 29. \"I give you my honour, and you who know\r\nher, would credit me without it, the following is a faithful description.\r\nI found her in a miserable little chamber of a ready-furnished house,\r\nwith two tallow candles, and a bureau covered with pots and pans. On\r\nher head, in full of all accounts, she had an old black-laced hood,\r\nwrapped entirely round, so as to conceal all hair or want of hair. No\r\nhandkerchief, but up to her chin a kind of horse-man's riding-coat,\r\ncalling itself a _pet-en-l'air,_ made of a dark green (green I\r\nthink it had been) brocade, with coloured and silver flowers, and lined\r\nwith furs; boddice laced, a foul dimity petticoat sprig'd, velvet\r\nmuffeteens on her arms, grey stockings and slippers. Her face less\r\nchanged in twenty years than I could have imagined; I told her so, and\r\nshe was not so tolerable twenty years ago that she needed to have taken\r\nit for flattery, but she did, and literally gave me a box on the ear.\r\nShe is very lively, all her senses perfect, her languages as imperfect\r\nas ever, her avarice greater. She entertained me at first with nothing\r\nbut the dearness of provisions at Helvoet. With nothing but an Italian,\r\na French, and a Prussian, all men-servants, and something she calls an\r\n_old_ secretary, but whose age till he appears will be doubtful;\r\nshe receives all the world who go to homage her as Queen-mother, and\r\ncrams them into this kennel. The Duchess of Hamilton, who came in just\r\nafter me, was so astonished and diverted, that she could not speak to\r\nher for laughing. She says that she left all her clothes at Venice. I\r\nreally pity Lady Bute; what will the progress be of such a commencement?\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary rented a house in Great George Street, Hanover Square, whither\r\nher daughter and grandchildren came often. Occasionally she went about,\r\nand from time to time would grace an assembly with her presence. Horace\r\nWalpole saw her at some gathering, dressed in yellow velvet and sables,\r\nwith a decent laced head and a black hood, almost like a veil, over her\r\nface. His prognostication that she would by her interference and demands\r\nfor \"jobs\" make life hideous for Lord and Lady Bute proved to be\r\nunfounded, and he had the grace to say, \"She is much more discreet than\r\nI expected, and meddles with nothing\"; but he could not refrain from\r\nsaying that \"she is woefully tedious in her narrations.\"\r\n\r\nLady Mary was suffering from cancer, which she concealed from her family\r\nand acquaintances until about the beginning of July (1762). Then it\r\nburst, and there was no hope of her life being much prolonged. On July 2\r\nshe wrote her last letter to Lady Frances Steuart, saying, \"I have been\r\nill a long time, and am now so bad I am little capable of writing, but I\r\nwould not pass in your opinion as either stupid or ungrateful. My heart\r\nis always warm in your service, and I am always told your affairs shall\r\nbe taken care of.\" If she was a bad woman to cross, at least even on her\r\ndeathbed she tried to do service to her friends. Death had no terrors\r\nfor her; she said she had lived long enough; and she died, as she had\r\nlived, with great fortitude.\r\n\r\nLady Mary passed away on August 21, 1762, at the age of seventy-three.\r\nHer remains were interred in the graveyard of Grosvenor Chapel, where\r\nalso lie Ambrose Phillips, David Mallett, Lord Chesterfield, William\r\nWhitehead, John Wilkes, and Elizabeth Carter.\r\n\r\nAll that Lady Mary possessed, except some trifling legacies, she left to\r\nLady Bute. Her fortune is believed to have been inconsiderable, except\r\nfor some valuable jewels. Walpole had one last gibe: \"With her usual\r\nmaternal tenderness and usual generosity, she has left her son one\r\nguinea.\" The gibe was unworthy, because Walpole knew quite well the\r\ncareer of that son, who, anyhow, was sufficiently provided for. It may\r\nbe that it was the pricking of Walpole's conscience for this last\r\noutburst that made him later administer a stern rebuke to Lady Craven.\r\n\"I am sorry to hear, Madam, that by your account Lady Mary Wortley was\r\nnot so accurate and faithful as modern travellers. The invaluable art of\r\ninoculation, which she brought from Constantinople, so dear to all\r\nadmirers of beauty, and to which we owe, perhaps the preservation of\r\nyours, stamps her an universal benefactress; and as you rival her in\r\npoetic talents I had rather you would employ them to celebrate her for\r\nher nostrum, than detect her for romancing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Lady Mary Wortley Montague, by Lewis Melville",
