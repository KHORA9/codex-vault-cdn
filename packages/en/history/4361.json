SHERMAN\r\n\r\nHIS COMRADES IN ARMS,\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEERS AND REGULARS.\r\n\r\nNearly ten years have passed since the close of the civil war in\r\nAmerica, and yet no satisfactory history thereof is accessible to\r\nthe public; nor should any be attempted until the Government has\r\npublished, and placed within the reach of students, the abundant\r\nmaterials that are buried in the War Department at Washington.\r\nThese are in process of compilation; but, at the rate of progress\r\nfor the past ten years, it is probable that a new century will come\r\nbefore they are published and circulated, with full indexes to\r\nenable the historian to make a judicious selection of materials.\r\n\r\nWhat is now offered is not designed as a history of the war, or\r\neven as a complete account of all the incidents in which the writer\r\nbore a part, but merely his recollection of events, corrected by a\r\nreference to his own memoranda, which may assist the future\r\nhistorian when he comes to describe the whole, and account for the\r\nmotives and reasons which influenced some of the actors in the\r\ngrand drama of war.\r\n\r\nI trust a perusal of these pages will prove interesting to the\r\nsurvivors, who have manifested so often their intense love of the\r\n\"cause\" which moved a nation to vindicate its own authority; and,\r\nequally so, to the rising generation, who therefrom may learn that\r\na country and government such as ours are worth fighting for, and\r\ndying for, if need be.\r\n\r\nIf successful in this, I shall feel amply repaid for departing from\r\nthe usage of military men, who seldom attempt to publish their own\r\ndeeds, but rest content with simply contributing by their acts to\r\nthe honor and glory of their country.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM T. SHERMAN,\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri, January 21, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\nAnother ten years have passed since I ventured to publish my\r\nMemoirs, and, being once more at leisure, I have revised them in\r\nthe light of the many criticisms public and private.\r\n\r\nMy habit has been to note in pencil the suggestions of critics, and\r\nto examine the substance of their differences; for critics must\r\ndiffer from the author, to manifest their superiority.\r\n\r\nWhere I have found material error I have corrected; and I have\r\nadded two chapters, one at the beginning, another at the end, both\r\nof the most general character, and an appendix.\r\n\r\nI wish my friends and enemies to understand that I disclaim the\r\ncharacter of historian, but assume to be a witness on the stand\r\nbefore the great tribunal of history, to assist some future Napier,\r\nAlison, or Hume to comprehend the feelings and thoughts of the\r\nactors in the grand conflicts of the recent past, and thereby to\r\nlessen his labors in the compilation necessary for the future\r\nbenefit of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn this free country every man is at perfect liberty to publish his\r\nown thoughts and impressions, and any witness who may differ from\r\nme should publish his own version of facts in the truthful\r\nnarration of which he is interested.  I am publishing my own\r\nmemoirs, not theirs, and we all know that no three honest witnesses\r\nof a simple brawl can agree on all the details.  How much more\r\nlikely will be the difference in a great battle covering a vast\r\nspace of broken ground, when each division, brigade, regiment, and\r\neven company, naturally and honestly believes that it was the focus\r\nof the whole affair! Each of them won the battle.  None ever lost.\r\nThat was the fate of the old man who unhappily commanded.\r\n\r\nIn this edition I give the best maps which I believe have ever been\r\nprepared, compiled by General O. M. Poe, from personal knowledge\r\nand official surveys, and what I chiefly aim to establish is the\r\ntrue cause of the results which are already known to the whole\r\nworld; and it may be a relief to many to know that I shall publish\r\nno other, but, like the player at cards, will \"stand;\" not that I\r\nhave accomplished perfection, but because I can do no better with\r\nthe cards in hand.  Of omissions there are plenty, but of wilful\r\nperversion of facts, none.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the first edition, in 1875, I used these words:\r\n\"Nearly ten years have passed since the close of the civil war in\r\nAmerica, and yet no satisfactory history thereof is accessible to\r\nthe public; nor should any be attempted until the Government has\r\npublished, and placed within the reach of students, the abundant\r\nmaterials that are buried in the War Department at Washington.\r\nThese are in process of compilation; but, at the rate of progress\r\nfor the past ten years, it is probable that a new century will come\r\nbefore they are published and circulated, with full indexes to\r\nenable the historian to make a judicious selection of materials\"\r\n\r\nAnother decade is past, and I am in possession of all these\r\npublications, my last being Volume XI, Part 3, Series 1, the last\r\ndate in which is August 30, 1862.  I am afraid that if I assume\r\nagain the character of prophet, I must extend the time deep into\r\nthe next century, and pray meanwhile that the official records of\r\nthe war, Union and Confederate, may approach completion before the\r\n\"next war,\" or rather that we, as a people, may be spared another\r\nwar until the last one is officially recorded.  Meantime the rising\r\ngeneration must be content with memoirs and histories compiled from\r\nthe best sources available.\r\n\r\nIn this sense I offer mine as to the events of which I was an\r\neye-witness and participant, or for which I was responsible.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM T. SHERMAN,\r\nGeneral (retired).\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri, March 30, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF GENERAL WILLIAM T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFROM 1820 TO THE MEXICAN WAR.\r\n\r\n1820-1846.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cothren, in his \"History of Ancient Woodbury,\r\nConnecticut,\" the Sherman family came from Dedham, Essex County,\r\nEngland.  The first recorded name is of Edmond Sherman, with his\r\nthree sons, Edmond, Samuel, and John, who were at Boston before\r\n1636; and farther it is distinctly recorded that Hon. Samuel\r\nSherman, Rev. John, his brother, and Captain John, his first\r\ncousin, arrived from Dedham, Essex County, England, in 1634.\r\nSamuel afterward married Sarah Mitchell, who had come (in the same\r\nship) from England, and finally settled at Stratford, Connecticut.\r\nThe other two (Johns) located at Watertown, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nFrom Captain John Sherman are descended Roger Sherman, the signer\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, Hon. William M. Evarts, the\r\nMessrs. Hoar, of Massachusetts, and many others of national fame.\r\nOur own family are descended from the Hon. Samuel Sherman and his\r\nson; the Rev. John, who was born in 1650-'51; then another John,\r\nborn in 1687; then Judge Daniel, born in 1721; then Taylor Sherman,\r\nour grandfather, who was born in 1758.  Taylor Sherman was a lawyer\r\nand judge in Norwalk, Connecticut, where he resided until his\r\ndeath, May 4, 1815; leaving a widow, Betsey Stoddard Sherman, and\r\nthree children, Charles R. (our father), Daniel, and Betsey.\r\n\r\nWhen the State of Connecticut, in 1786, ceded to the United States\r\nher claim to the western part of her public domain, as defined by\r\nher Royal Charter, she reserved a large district in what is now\r\nnorthern Ohio, a portion of which (five hundred thousand acres)\r\ncomposed the \"Fire-Land District,\" which was set apart to indemnify\r\nthe parties who had lost property in Connecticut by the raids of\r\nGenerals Arnold, Tryon, and others during the latter part of the\r\nRevolutionary War.\r\n\r\nOur grandfather, Judge Taylor Sherman, was one of the commissioners\r\nappointed by the State of Connecticut to quiet the Indian title,\r\nand to survey and subdivide this Fire-Land District, which includes\r\nthe present counties of Huron and Erie.  In his capacity as\r\ncommissioner he made several trips to Ohio in the early part of\r\nthis century, and it is supposed that he then contracted the\r\ndisease which proved fatal.  For his labor and losses he received a\r\ntitle to two sections of land, which fact was probably the prime\r\ncause of the migration of our family to the West.  My father\r\nreceived a good education, and was admitted to the bar at Norwalk,\r\nConnecticut, where, in 1810, he, at twenty years of age, married\r\nMary Hoyt, also of Norwalk, and at once migrated to Ohio, leaving\r\nhis wife (my mother) for a time.  His first purpose was to settle\r\nat Zanesville, Ohio, but he finally chose Lancaster, Fairfield\r\nCounty, where he at once engaged in the practice of his\r\nprofession.  In 1811 he returned to Norwalk, where, meantime, was\r\nborn Charles Taylor Sherman, the eldest of the family, who with his\r\nmother was carried to Ohio on horseback.\r\n\r\nJudge Taylor Sherman's family remained in Norwalk till 1815, when\r\nhis death led to the emigration of the remainder of the family,\r\nviz., of Uncle Daniel Sherman, who settled at Monroeville, Ohio, as\r\na farmer, where he lived and died quite recently, leaving children\r\nand grandchildren;  and an aunt, Betsey, who married Judge Parker,\r\nof Mansfield, and died in 1851, leaving children and grandchildren;\r\nalso Grandmother Elizabeth Stoddard Sherman, who resided with her\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Betsey Parker, in Mansfield until her death, August\r\n1,1848.\r\n\r\nThus my father, Charles R. Sherman, became finally established at\r\nLancaster, Ohio, as a lawyer, with his own family in the year 1811,\r\nand continued there till the time of his death, in 1829.  I have no\r\ndoubt that he was in the first instance attracted to Lancaster by\r\nthe natural beauty of its scenery, and the charms of its already\r\nestablished society.  He continued in the practice of his\r\nprofession, which in those days was no sinecure, for the ordinary\r\ncircuit was made on horseback, and embraced Marietta, Cincinnati,\r\nand Detroit.  Hardly was the family established there when the War\r\nof 1812 caused great alarm and distress in all Ohio.  The English\r\ncaptured Detroit and the shores of Lake Erie down to the Maumee\r\nRiver; while the Indians still occupied the greater part of the\r\nState.  Nearly every man had to be somewhat of a soldier, but I\r\nthink my father was only a commissary; still, he seems to have\r\ncaught a fancy for the great chief of the Shawnees, \"Tecumseh.\"\r\n\r\nPerry's victory on Lake Erie was the turning-point of the Western\r\ncampaign, and General Harrison's victory over the British and\r\nIndians at the river Thames in Canada ended the war in the West,\r\nand restored peace and tranquillity to the exposed settlers of\r\nOhio.  My father at once resumed his practice at the bar, and was\r\nsoon recognized as an able and successful lawyer.  When, in 1816,\r\nmy brother James was born, he insisted on engrafting the Indian\r\nname \"Tecumseh\" on the usual family list.  My mother had already\r\nnamed her first son after her own brother Charles; and insisted on\r\nthe second son taking the name of her other brother James, and when\r\nI came along, on the 8th of February, 1820, mother having no more\r\nbrothers, my father succeeded in his original purpose, and named me\r\nWilliam Tecumseh.\r\n\r\nThe family rapidly increased till it embraced six boys and five\r\ngirls, all of whom attained maturity and married; of these six are\r\nstill living.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1821 a vacancy occurred in the Supreme Court of Ohio,\r\nand I find this petition:\r\n\r\n\r\nSomerset, Ohio, July 6, 1821.\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency:\r\n\r\nWe ask leave to recommend to your Excellency's favorable notice\r\nCharles R. Sherman, Esq., of Lancaster, as a man possessing in an\r\neminent degree those qualifications so much to be desired in a\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nFrom a long acquaintance with Mr. Sherman, we are happy to be able\r\nto state to your Excellency that our minds are led to the\r\nconclusion that that gentleman possesses a disposition noble and\r\ngenerous, a mind discriminating, comprehensive, and combining a\r\nheart pure, benevolent and humane.  Manners dignified, mild, and\r\ncomplaisant, and a firmness not to be shaken and of unquestioned\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Sherman's character cannot be unknown to your Excellency,\r\nand on that acquaintance without further comment we might safely\r\nrest his pretensions.\r\n\r\nWe think we hazard little in assuring your Excellency that his\r\nappointment would give almost universal satisfaction to the\r\ncitizens of Perry County.\r\n\r\nWith great consideration, we have the honor to be\r\n\r\nYour Excellency's most obedient humble servants,\r\nCHARLES A. HOOD,\r\nGEORGE TREAT,\r\nPETER DITTOR,\r\nP. ODLIN,\r\nJ. B. ORTEN,\r\nT. BECKWITH,\r\nWILLIAM P. DORST,\r\nJOHN MURRAY,\r\nJACOB MOINS,\r\nB. EATON,\r\nDANIEL GRIGGS,\r\nHENRY DITTOE,\r\nNICHOLAS McCARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency ETHAN A. BROWN,\r\nGovernor of Ohio, Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was soon after appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court, and\r\nserved in that capacity to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nMy memory extends back to about 1827, and I recall him, returning\r\nhome on horseback, when all the boys used to run and contend for\r\nthe privilege of riding his horse from the front door back to the\r\nstable.  On one occasion, I was the first, and being mounted rode\r\nto the stable; but \"Old Dick\" was impatient because the stable-door\r\nwas not opened promptly, so he started for the barn of our neighbor\r\nMr. King; there, also, no one was in waiting to open the gate, and,\r\nafter a reasonable time, \"Dick\" started back for home somewhat in a\r\nhurry, and threw me among a pile of stones, in front of preacher\r\nWright's house, where I was picked up apparently a dead boy; but my\r\ntime was not yet, and I recovered, though the scars remain to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe year 1829 was a sad one to our family.  We were then ten\r\nchildren, my eldest brother Charles absent at the State University,\r\nAthens, Ohio; my next brother, James, in a store at Cincinnati; and\r\nthe rest were at home, at school.  Father was away on the circuit.\r\nOne day Jane Sturgeon came to the school, called us out, and when\r\nwe reached home all was lamentation: news had come that father was\r\nill unto death, at Lebanon, a hundred miles away.  Mother started\r\nat once, by coach, but met the news of his death about Washington,\r\nand returned home.  He had ridden on horseback from Cincinnati to\r\nLebanon to hold court, during a hot day in June.  On the next day\r\nhe took his seat on the bench, opened court in the forenoon, but in\r\nthe afternoon, after recess, was seized with a severe chill and had\r\nto adjourn the court.  The best medical aid was called in, and for\r\nthree days with apparent success, but the fever then assumed a more\r\ndangerous type, and he gradually yielded to it, dying on the sixth\r\nday, viz., June 24, 1829.\r\n\r\nMy brother James had been summoned from Cincinnati, and was present\r\nat his bedside, as was also Henry Stoddard, Esq., of Dayton, Ohio,\r\nour cousin.  Mr. Stoddard once told me that the cause of my\r\nfather's death was cholera; but at that time, 1829, there was no\r\nAsiatic cholera in the United States, and the family, attributed\r\nhis death to exposure to the hot sun of June, and a consequent\r\nfever, \"typhoid.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the resolutions of the bench, bar, and public generally, now\r\nin my possession, his death was universally deplored; more\r\nespecially by his neighbors in Lancaster, and by the Society of\r\nFreemasons, of which he was the High-Priest of Arch Chapter No. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis death left the family very poor, but friends rose up with\r\nproffers of generous care and assistance; for all the neighbors\r\nknew that mother could not maintain so large a family without help.\r\nMy eldest brother, Charles, had nearly completed his education at\r\nthe university at Athens, and concluded to go to his uncle, Judge\r\nParker, at Mansfield, Ohio, to study law.  My eldest sister,\r\nElizabeth, soon after married William J. Reese, Esq.; James was\r\nalready in a store at Cincinnati; and, with the exception of the\r\nthree youngest children, the rest of us were scattered.  I fell to\r\nthe charge of the Hon. Thomas Ewing, who took me to his family, and\r\never after treated me as his own son.\r\n\r\nI continued at the Academy in Lancaster, which was the best in the\r\nplace; indeed, as good a school as any in Ohio.  We studied all the\r\ncommon branches of knowledge, including Latin, Greek, and French.\r\nAt first the school was kept by Mr. Parsons; he was succeeded by\r\nMr. Brown, and he by two brothers, Samuel and Mark How.  These were\r\nall excellent teachers, and we made good progress, first at the old\r\nacademy and afterward at a new school-house, built by Samuel How,\r\nin the orchard of Hugh Boyle, Esq.\r\n\r\nTime passed with us as with boys generally.  Mr. Ewing was in the\r\nUnited States Senate, and I was notified to prepare for West Point,\r\nof which institution we had little knowledge, except that it was\r\nvery strict, and that the army was its natural consequence.  In\r\n1834 I was large for my age, and the construction of canals was the\r\nrage in Ohio.  A canal was projected to connect with the great Ohio\r\nCanal at Carroll (eight miles above Lancaster), down the valley of\r\nthe Hock Hocking to Athens (forty-four miles), and thence to the\r\nOhio River by slack water.\r\n\r\nPreacher Carpenter, of Lancaster, was appointed to make the\r\npreliminary surveys, and selected the necessary working party out\r\nof the boys of the town.  From our school were chosen ____Wilson,\r\nEmanuel Geisy, William King, and myself.  Geisy and I were the\r\nrod-men.  We worked during that fall and next spring, marking two\r\nexperimental lines, and for our work we each received a silver\r\nhalf-dollar for each day's actual work, the first money any of us\r\nhad ever earned.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1835, one of our school-fellows, William Irvin, was\r\nappointed a cadet to West Point, and, as it required sixteen years\r\nof age for admission, I had to wait another year.  During the\r\nautumn of 1835 and spring of 1836 I devoted myself chiefly to\r\nmathematics and French, which were known to be the chief requisites\r\nfor admission to West Point.\r\n\r\nSome time in the spring of 1836 I received through Mr. Ewing, then\r\nat Washington, from the Secretary of War, Mr. Poinsett, the letter\r\nof appointment as a cadet, with a list of the articles of clothing\r\nnecessary to be taken along, all of which were liberally provided\r\nby Mrs. Ewing; and with orders to report to Mr. Ewing, at\r\nWashington, by a certain date, I left Lancaster about the 20th of\r\nMay in the stage-coach for Zanesville.  There we transferred to the\r\ncoaches of the Great National Road, the highway of travel from the\r\nWest to the East.  The stages generally travelled in gangs of from\r\none to six coaches, each drawn by four good horses, carrying nine\r\npassengers inside and three or four outside.\r\n\r\nIn about three days, travelling day and night, we reached\r\nFrederick, Maryland.  There we were told that we could take\r\nrail-cars to Baltimore, and thence to Washington; but there was\r\nalso a two-horse hack ready to start for Washington direct.  Not\r\nhaving full faith in the novel and dangerous railroad, I stuck to\r\nthe coach, and in the night reached Gadsby's Hotel in Washington\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I hunted up Mr. Ewing, and found him boarding with\r\na mess of Senators at Mrs. Hill's, corner of Third and C Streets,\r\nand transferred my trunk to the same place.  I spent a week in\r\nWashington, and think I saw more of the place in that time than I\r\never have since in the many years of residence there.  General\r\nJackson was President, and was at the zenith of his fame.  I recall\r\nlooking at him a full hour, one morning, through the wood railing\r\non Pennsylvania Avenue, as he paced up and down the gravel walk on\r\nthe north front of the White House.  He wore a cap and an overcoat\r\nso full that his form seemed smaller than I had expected.  I also\r\nrecall the appearance of Postmaster-General Amos Kendall, of\r\nVice-President Van Buren, Messrs. Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Cass,\r\nSilas Wright, etc.\r\n\r\nIn due time I took my departure for West Point with Cadets Belt and\r\nBronaugh.  These were appointed cadets as from Ohio, although\r\nneither had ever seen that State.  But in those days there were\r\nfewer applicants from Ohio than now, and near the close of the term\r\nthe vacancies unasked for were usually filled from applicants on\r\nthe spot.  Neither of these parties, however, graduated, so the\r\nState of Ohio lost nothing.  We went to Baltimore by rail, there\r\ntook a boat up to Havre de Grace, then the rail to Wilmington,\r\nDelaware, and up the Delaware in a boat to Philadelphia.  I staid\r\nover in Philadelphia one day at the old Mansion House, to visit the\r\nfamily of my brother-in-law, Mr. Reese.  I found his father a fine\r\nsample of the old merchant gentleman, in a good house in Arch\r\nStreet, with his accomplished daughters, who had been to Ohio, and\r\nwhom I had seen there.  From Philadelphia we took boat to\r\nBordentown, rail to Amboy, and boat again to New York City,\r\nstopping at the American Hotel.  I staid a week in New York City,\r\nvisiting my uncle, Charles Hoyt, at his beautiful place on Brooklyn\r\nHeights, and my uncle James, then living in White Street.  My\r\nfriend William Scott was there, the young husband of my cousin,\r\nLouise Hoyt; a neatly-dressed young fellow, who looked on me as an\r\nuntamed animal just caught in the far West--\"fit food for\r\ngunpowder,\" and good for nothing else.\r\n\r\nAbout June 12th I embarked in the steamer Cornelius Vanderbilt for\r\nWest Point; registered in the office of Lieutenant C. F. Smith,\r\nAdjutant of the Military Academy, as a new cadet of the class of\r\n1836, and at once became installed as the \"plebe\" of my\r\nfellow-townsman, William Irvin, then entering his Third Class.\r\n\r\nColonel R. E. De Russy was Superintendent; Major John Fowle, Sixth\r\nUnited States Infantry, Commandant.  The principal Professors were:\r\nMahan, Engineering; Bartlett, Natural Philosophy; Bailey,\r\nChemistry; Church, Mathematics; Weir, Drawing; and Berard, French.\r\n\r\nThe routine of military training and of instruction was then fully\r\nestablished, and has remained almost the same ever since.  To give\r\na mere outline would swell this to an inconvenient size, and I\r\ntherefore merely state that I went through the regular course of\r\nfour years, graduating in June, 1840, number six in a class of\r\nforty-three.  These forty-three were all that remained of more than\r\none hundred which originally constituted the class.  At the Academy\r\nI was not considered a good soldier, for at no time was I selected\r\nfor any office, but remained a private throughout the whole four\r\nyears.  Then, as now, neatness in dress and form, with a strict\r\nconformity to the rules, were the qualifications required for\r\noffice, and I suppose I was found not to excel in any of these.  In\r\nstudies I always held a respectable reputation with the professors,\r\nand generally ranked among the best, especially in drawing,\r\nchemistry, mathematics, and natural philosophy.  My average\r\ndemerits, per annum, were about one hundred and fifty, which.\r\nreduced my final class standing from number four to six.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1840, after the final examination, the class graduated and\r\nwe received our diplomas.  Meantime, Major Delafield, United States\r\nEngineers, had become Superintendent; Major C. F. Smith, Commandant\r\nof Cadets; but the corps of professors and assistants remained\r\nalmost unchanged during our whole term.  We were all granted the\r\nusual furlough of three months, and parted for our homes, there to\r\nawait assignment to our respective corps and regiments.  In due\r\nseason I was appointed and commissioned second-lieutenant, Third\r\nArtillery, and ordered to report at Governor's Island, New York\r\nHarbor, at the end of September.  I spent my furlough mostly at\r\nLancaster and Mansfield, Ohio; toward the close of September\r\nreturned to New York, reported to Major Justin Dimock, commanding\r\nthe recruiting rendezvous at Governor's Island, and was assigned to\r\ncommand a company of recruits preparing for service in Florida.\r\nEarly in October this company was detailed, as one of four, to\r\nembark in a sailing-vessel for Savannah, Georgia, under command of\r\nCaptain and Brevet Major Penrose.  We embarked and sailed, reaching\r\nSavannah about the middle of October, where we transferred to a\r\nsmall steamer and proceeded by the inland route to St. Augustine,\r\nFlorida.  We reached St. Augustine at the same time with the Eighth\r\nInfantry, commanded by Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General William\r\nJ. Worth.  At that time General Zachary Taylor was in chief command\r\nin Florida, and had his headquarters at Tampa Bay.  My regiment,\r\nthe Third Artillery, occupied the posts along the Atlantic coast of\r\nFlorida, from St. Augustine south to Key Biscayne, and my own\r\ncompany, A, was at Fort Pierce, Indian River.  At St. Augustine I\r\nwas detached from the company of recruits, which was designed for\r\nthe Second Infantry, and was ordered to join my proper company at\r\nFort Pierce.  Colonel William Gates commanded the regiment, with\r\nLieutenant William Austine Brown as adjutant of the regiment.\r\nLieutenant Bragg commanded the post of St. Augustine with his own\r\ncompany, E, and G (Garner's), then commanded by Lieutenant Judd.\r\nIn, a few days I embarked in the little steamer William Gaston down\r\nthe coast, stopping one day at New Smyrna, held by John R. Vinton's\r\ncompany (B), with which was serving Lieutenant William H. Shover.\r\n\r\nIn due season we arrived off the bar of Indian River and anchored.\r\nA whale-boat came off with a crew of four men, steered by a\r\ncharacter of some note, known as the Pilot Ashlock.  I transferred\r\nself and baggage to this boat, and, with the mails, was carried\r\nthrough the surf over the bar, into the mouth of Indian River\r\nInlet.  It was then dark; we transferred to a smaller boat, and the\r\nsame crew pulled us up through a channel in the middle of Mangrove\r\nIslands, the roosting-place of thousands of pelicans and birds that\r\nrose in clouds and circled above our heads.  The water below was\r\nalive with fish, whose course through it could be seen by the\r\nphosphoric wake; and Ashlock told me many a tale of the Indian war\r\nthen in progress, and of his adventures in hunting and fishing,\r\nwhich he described as the best in the world.  About two miles from\r\nthe bar, we emerged into the lagoon, a broad expanse of shallow\r\nwater that lies parallel with the coast, separated from it by a\r\nnarrow strip of sand, backed by a continuous series of islands and\r\npromontories, covered with a dense growth of mangrove and\r\nsaw-palmetto.  Pulling across this lagoon, in about three more\r\nmiles we approached the lights of Fort Pierce.  Reaching a\r\nsmall wharf, we landed, and were met by the officers of the\r\npost, Lieutenants George Taylor and Edward J. Steptoe, and\r\nAssistant-Surgeon James Simons.  Taking the mail-bag, we walked up\r\na steep sand-bluff on which the fort was situated, and across the\r\nparade-ground to the officers' quarters.  These were six or seven\r\nlog-houses, thatched with palmetto-leaves, built on high posts,\r\nwith a porch in front, facing the water.  The men's quarters were\r\nalso of logs forming the two sides of a rectangle, open toward the\r\nwater; the intervals and flanks were closed with log stockades.  I\r\nwas assigned to one of these rooms, and at once began service with\r\nmy company, A, then commanded by Lieutenant Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe season was hardly yet come for active operations against the\r\nIndians, so that the officers were naturally attracted to Ashlock,\r\nwho was the best fisherman I ever saw.  He soon initiated us into\r\nthe mysteries of shark-spearing, trolling for red-fish, and taking\r\nthe sheep's-head and mullet.  These abounded so that we could at\r\nany time catch an unlimited quantity at pleasure.  The companies\r\nalso owned nets for catching green turtles.  These nets had meshes\r\nabout a foot square, were set across channels in the lagoon, the\r\nends secured to stakes driven into the mad, the lower line sunk\r\nwith lead or stone weights and the upper line floated with cork.\r\nWe usually visited these nets twice a day, and found from one to\r\nsix green turtles entangled in the meshes.  Disengaging them, they\r\nwere carried to pens, made with stakes stuck in the mud, where they\r\nwere fed with mangrove-leaves, and our cooks had at all times an\r\nample supply of the best of green turtles.  They were so cheap and\r\ncommon that the soldiers regarded it as an imposition when\r\ncompelled to eat green turtle steaks, instead of poor Florida beef,\r\nor the usual barrelled mess-pork.  I do not recall in my whole\r\nexperience a spot on earth where fish, oysters, and green turtles\r\nso abound as at Fort Pierce, Florida.\r\n\r\nIn November, Major Childs arrived with Lieutenant Van Vliet and a\r\ndetachment of recruits to fill our two companies, and preparations\r\nwere at once begun for active operations in the field.  At that\r\ntime the Indians in the Peninsula of Florida were scattered, and\r\nthe war consisted in hunting up and securing the small fragments,\r\nto be sent to join the others of their tribe of Seminoles already\r\nestablished in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas.  Our\r\nexpeditions were mostly made in boats in the lagoons extending from\r\nthe \"Haul-over,\" near two hundred miles above the fort, down to\r\nJupiter Inlet, about fifty miles below, and in the many streams\r\nwhich emptied therein.  Many such expeditions were made during that\r\nwinter, with more or less success, in which we succeeded in picking\r\nup small parties of men, women, and children.  On one occasion,\r\nnear the \"Haul-over,\" when I was not present, the expedition was\r\nmore successful.  It struck a party of nearly fifty Indians, killed\r\nseveral warriors, and captured others.  In this expedition my\r\nclassmate, lieutenant Van Vliet, who was an excellent shot, killed\r\na warrior who was running at full speed among trees, and one of the\r\nsergeants of our company (Broderick) was said to have dispatched\r\nthree warriors, and it was reported that he took the scalp of one\r\nand brought it in to the fort as a trophy.  Broderick was so elated\r\nthat, on reaching the post, he had to celebrate his victory by a\r\nbig drunk.\r\n\r\nThere was at the time a poor, weakly soldier of our company whose\r\nwife cooked for our mess.  She was somewhat of a flirt, and rather\r\nfond of admiration.  Sergeant Broderick was attracted to her, and\r\nhung around the mess-house more than the husband fancied; so he\r\nreported the matter to Lieutenant Taylor, who reproved Broderick\r\nfor his behavior.  A few days afterward the husband again appealed\r\nto his commanding officer (Taylor), who exclaimed: \"Haven't you got\r\na musket?  Can't you defend your own family?\"  Very soon after a\r\nshot was heard down by the mess-house, and it transpired that the\r\nhusband had actually shot Broderick, inflicting a wound which\r\nproved mortal.  The law and army regulations required that the man\r\nshould be sent to the nearest civil court, which was at St.\r\nAugustine; accordingly, the prisoner and necessary witnesses were\r\nsent up by the next monthly steamer.  Among the latter were\r\nlieutenant Taylor and the pilot Ashlock.\r\n\r\nAfter they had been gone about a month, the sentinel on the roof-top\r\nof our quarters reported the smoke of a steamer approaching the bar,\r\nand, as I was acting quartermaster, I took a boat and pulled down to\r\nget the mail.  I reached the log-but in which the pilots lived, and\r\nsaw them start with their boat across the bar, board the steamer,\r\nand then return.  Ashlock was at his old post at the steering-oar,\r\nwith two ladies, who soon came to the landing, having passed through\r\na very heavy surf, and I was presented to one as Mrs. Ashlock, and\r\nthe other as her sister, a very pretty little Minorcan girl of about\r\nfourteen years of age.  Mrs. Ashlock herself was probably eighteen\r\nor twenty years old, and a very handsome woman.  I was hurriedly\r\ninformed that the murder trial was in progress at St. Augustine;\r\nthat Ashlock had given his testimony, and had availed himself of the\r\nchance to take a wife to share with him the solitude of his desolate\r\nhut on the beach at Indian River. He had brought ashore his wife,\r\nher sister, and their chests, with the mail, and had orders to\r\nreturn immediately to the steamer (Gaston or Harney) to bring ashore\r\nsome soldiers belonging to another company, E (Braggs), which had\r\nbeen ordered from St. Augustine to Fort Pierce.  Ashlock left his\r\nwife and her sister standing on the beach near the pilot-hut, and\r\nstarted back with his whale-boat across the bar.  I also took the\r\nmail and started up to the fort, and had hardly reached the wharf\r\nwhen I observed another boat following me.  As soon as this reached\r\nthe wharf the men reported that Ashlock and all his crew, with the\r\nexception of one man, had been drowned a few minutes after I had\r\nleft the beach. They said his surf-boat had reached the steamer, had\r\ntaken on board a load of soldiers, some eight or ten, and had\r\nstarted back through the surf, when on the bar a heavy breaker upset\r\nthe boat, and all were lost except the boy who pulled the bow-oar,\r\nwho clung to the rope or painter, hauled himself to the upset boat,\r\nheld on, drifted with it outside the breakers, and was finally\r\nbeached near a mile down the coast. They reported also that the\r\nsteamer had got up anchor, run in as close to the bar as she could,\r\npaused awhile, and then had started down the coast.\r\n\r\nI instantly took a fresh crew of soldiers and returned to the bar;\r\nthere sat poor Mrs. Ashlock on her chest of clothes, a weeping\r\nwidow, who had seen her husband perish amid sharks and waves; she\r\nclung to the hope that the steamer had picked him up, but, strange\r\nto say, he could not swim, although he had been employed on the\r\nwater all his life.\r\n\r\nHer sister was more demonstrative, and wailed as one lost to all\r\nhope and life.  She appealed to us all to do miracles to save the\r\nstruggling men in the waves, though two hours had already passed,\r\nand to have gone out then among those heavy breakers, with an\r\ninexperienced crew, would have been worse than suicide.  All I\r\ncould do was to reorganize the guard at the beach, take the two\r\ndesolate females up to the fort, and give them the use of my own\r\nquarters.  Very soon their anguish was quieted, and they began to\r\nlook, for the return of their steamer with Ashlock and his rescued\r\ncrew.  The next day I went again to the beach with Lieutenant Ord,\r\nand we found that one or two bodies had been washed ashore, torn\r\nall to pieces by the sharks, which literally swarmed the inlet at\r\nevery new tide.  In a few days the weather moderated, and the\r\nsteamer returned from the south, but the surf was so high that she\r\nanchored a mile off.  I went out myself, in the whale or surf boat,\r\nover that terrible bar with a crew of soldiers, boarded the\r\nsteamer, and learned that none other of Ashlock's crew except the\r\none before mentioned had been saved; but, on the contrary, the\r\ncaptain of the steamer had sent one of his own boats to their\r\nrescue, which was likewise upset in the surf, and, out of the three\r\nmen in her, one had drifted back outside the breakers, clinging to\r\nthe upturned boat, and was picked up.  This sad and fatal\r\ncatastrophe made us all afraid of that bar, and in returning to the\r\nshore I adopted the more prudent course of beaching the boat below\r\nthe inlet, which insured us a good ducking, but was attended with\r\nless risk to life.\r\n\r\nI had to return to the fort and bear to Mrs. Ashlock the absolute\r\ntruth, that her husband was lost forever.\r\n\r\nMeantime her sister had entirely recovered her equilibrium, and\r\nbeing the guest of the officers, who were extremely courteous to\r\nher, she did not lament so loudly the calamity that saved them a\r\nlong life of banishment on the beach of Indian River.  By the first\r\nopportunity they were sent back to St. Augustine, the possessors of\r\nall of Ashlock's worldly goods and effects, consisting of a good\r\nrifle, several cast-nets, hand-lines, etc., etc., besides some\r\nthree hundred dollars in money, which was due him by the\r\nquartermaster for his services as pilot.  I afterward saw these\r\nladies at St. Augustine, and years afterward the younger one came\r\nto Charleston, South Carolina, the wife of the somewhat famous\r\nCaptain Thistle, agent for the United States for live-oak in\r\nFlorida, who was noted as the first of the troublesome class of\r\ninventors of modern artillery.  He was the inventor of a gun that\r\n\"did not recoil at all,\" or \"if anything it recoiled a little\r\nforward.\"\r\n\r\nOne day, in the summer of 1841, the sentinel on the housetop at\r\nFort Pierce called out, \"Indians!  Indians!\" Everybody sprang to\r\nhis gun, the companies formed promptly on the parade-ground, and\r\nsoon were reported as approaching the post, from the pine-woods in\r\nrear, four Indians on horseback.  They rode straight up to the\r\ngateway, dismounted, and came in.  They were conducted by the\r\nofficer of the day to the commanding officer, Major Childs, who sat\r\non the porch in front of his own room.  After the usual pause, one\r\nof them, a black man named Joe, who spoke English, said they had\r\nbeen sent in by Coacoochee (Wild Cat), one of the most noted of the\r\nSeminole chiefs, to see the big chief of the post.  He gradually\r\nunwrapped a piece of paper, which was passed over to Major Childs,\r\nwho read it, and it was in the nature of a \"Safe Guard\" for \"Wild\r\nCat\" to come into Fort Pierce to receive provisions and assistance\r\nwhile collecting his tribe, with the purpose of emigrating to their\r\nreservation west of Arkansas.  The paper was signed by General\r\nWorth, who had succeeded General Taylor, at Tampa Bay, in command\r\nof all the troops in Florida.  Major Childs inquired, \"Where is\r\nCoacoochee?\" and was answered, \"Close by,\" when Joe explained that\r\nhe had been sent in by his chief to see if the paper was all right.\r\nMajor Childs said it was \"all right,\" and that Coacoochee ought to\r\ncome in himself.  Joe offered to go out and bring him in, when\r\nMajor Childs ordered me to take eight or ten mounted men and go out\r\nto escort him in.  Detailing ten men to saddle up, and taking Joe\r\nand one Indian boy along on their own ponies, I started out under\r\ntheir guidance.\r\n\r\nWe continued to ride five or six miles, when I began to suspect\r\ntreachery, of which I had heard so much in former years, and had\r\nbeen specially cautioned against by the older officers; but Joe\r\nalways answered, \"Only a little way.\"   At last we approached one\r\nof those close hammocks, so well known in Florida, standing like an\r\nisland in the interminable pine-forest, with a pond of water near\r\nit.  On its edge I noticed a few Indians loitering, which Joe\r\npointed out as the place.  Apprehensive of treachery, I halted the\r\nguard, gave orders to the sergeant to watch me closely, and rode\r\nforward alone with the two Indian guides.  As we neared the\r\nhammock, about a dozen Indian warriors rose up and waited for us.\r\nWhen in their midst I inquired for the chief, Coacoochee.  He\r\napproached my horse and, slapping his breast, said, \"Me\r\nCoacoochee.\"  He was a very handsome young Indian warrior, not more\r\nthan twenty-five years old, but in his then dress could hardly be\r\ndistinguished from the rest.  I then explained to him, through Joe,\r\nthat I had been sent by my \"chief\" to escort him into the fort.  He\r\nwanted me to get down and \"talk\" I told him that I had no \"talk\" in\r\nme, but that, on his reaching the post, he could talk as much as he\r\npleased with the \"big chief,\" Major Childs.  They all seemed to be\r\nindifferent, and in no hurry; and I noticed that all their guns\r\nwere leaning against a tree.  I beckoned to the sergeant, who\r\nadvanced rapidly with his escort, and told him to secure the\r\nrifles, which he proceeded to do.  Coacoochee pretended to be very\r\nangry, but I explained to him that his warriors were tired and mine\r\nwere not, and that the soldiers would carry the guns on their\r\nhorses.  I told him I would provide him a horse to ride, and the\r\nsooner he was ready the better for all.  He then stripped, washed\r\nhimself in the pond, and began to dress in all his Indian finery,\r\nwhich consisted of buckskin leggins, moccasins, and several shirts.\r\nHe then began to put on vests, one after another, and one of them\r\nhad the marks of a bullet, just above the pocket, with the stain of\r\nblood.  In the pocket was a one-dollar Tallahassee Bank note, and\r\nthe rascal had the impudence to ask me to give him silver coin for\r\nthat dollar.  He had evidently killed the wearer, and was\r\ndisappointed because the pocket contained a paper dollar instead of\r\none in silver.  In due time he was dressed with turban and\r\nostrich-feathers, and mounted the horse reserved for him, and thus\r\nwe rode back together to Fort Pierce.  Major Childs and all the\r\nofficers received him on the porch, and there we had a regular\r\n\"talk.\"  Coacoochee \"was tired of the war.\"  \"His people were\r\nscattered and it would take a 'moon' to collect them for\r\nemigration,\" and he \"wanted rations for that time,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAll this was agreed to, and a month was allowed for him to get\r\nready with his whole band (numbering some one hundred and fifty or\r\none hundred and sixty) to migrate.  The \"talk\" then ceased, and\r\nCoacoochee and his envoys proceeded to get regularly drunk, which\r\nwas easily done by the agency of commissary whiskey.  They staid at\r\nFort Pierce daring the night, and the next day departed.  Several\r\ntimes during the month there came into the post two or more of\r\nthese same Indians, always to beg for something to eat or drink,\r\nand after a full month Coacoochee and about twenty of his warriors\r\ncame in with several ponies, but with none of their women or\r\nchildren.  Major Childs had not from the beginning the least faith\r\nin his sincerity; had made up his mind to seize the whole party and\r\ncompel them to emigrate.  He arranged for the usual council, and\r\ninstructed Lieutenant Taylor to invite Coacoochee and his uncle\r\n(who was held to be a principal chief) to his room to take some\r\ngood brandy, instead of the common commissary whiskey.  At a signal\r\nagreed on I was to go to the quarters of Company A, to dispatch the\r\nfirst-sergeant and another man to Lieutenant Taylor's room, there\r\nto seize the two chiefs and secure them; and with the company I was\r\nto enter Major Childs's room and secure the remainder of the party.\r\nMeantime Lieutenant Van Vliet was ordered to go to the quarters of\r\nhis company, F, and at the same signal to march rapidly to the rear\r\nof the officers' quarters, so as to catch any who might attempt to\r\nescape by the open windows to the rear.\r\n\r\nAll resulted exactly as prearranged, and in a few minutes the whole\r\nparty was in irons.  At first they claimed that we had acted\r\ntreacherously, but very soon they admitted that for a month\r\nCoacoochee had been quietly removing his women and children toward\r\nLake Okeechobee and the Everglades; and that this visit to our post\r\nwas to have been their last.  It so happened that almost at the\r\ninstant of our seizing these Indians a vessel arrived off the bar\r\nwith reenforcements from St. Augustine.  These were brought up to\r\nFort Pierce, and we marched that night and next day rapidly, some\r\nfifty miles, to Lake Okeechobee, in hopes to capture the balance of\r\nthe tribe, especially the families, but they had taken the alarm\r\nand escaped.  Coacoochee and his warriors were sent by Major Childs\r\nin a schooner to New Orleans en route to their reservation, but\r\nGeneral Worth recalled them to Tampa Bay, and by sending out\r\nCoacoochee himself the women and children came in voluntarily, and\r\nthen all were shipped to their destination.  This was a heavy loss\r\nto the Seminoles, but there still remained in the Peninsula a few\r\nhundred warriors with their families scattered into very small\r\nparcels, who were concealed in the most inaccessible hammocks and\r\nswamps.  These had no difficulty in finding plenty of food anywhere\r\nand everywhere.  Deer and wild turkey were abundant, and as for\r\nfish there was no end to them.  Indeed, Florida was the Indian's\r\nparadise, was of little value to us, and it was a great pity to\r\nremove the Seminoles at all, for we could have collected there all\r\nthe Choctaws, Creeks, Cherokees, and Chickasaws, in addition to the\r\nSeminoles.  They would have thrived in the Peninsula, whereas they\r\nnow occupy lands that are very valuable, which are coveted by their\r\nwhite neighbors on all sides, while the Peninsula, of Florida still\r\nremains with a population less than should make a good State.\r\n\r\nDuring that and preceding years General W. S. Harney had penetrated\r\nand crossed through the Everglades, capturing and hanging Chekika\r\nand his band, and had brought in many prisoners, who were also\r\nshipped West.  We at Fort Pierce made several other excursions to\r\nJupiter, Lake Worth, Lauderdale, and into the Everglades, picking\r\nup here and there a family, so that it was absurd any longer to\r\ncall it a \"war.\"  These excursions, however, possessed to us a\r\npeculiar charm, for the fragrance of the air, the abundance of game\r\nand fish, and just enough of adventure, gave to life a relish.  I\r\nhad just returned to Lauderdale from one of these scouts with\r\nLieutenants Rankin, Ord, George H. Thomas, Field, Van Vliet, and\r\nothers, when I received notice of my promotion to be first\r\nlieutenant of Company G, which occurred November 30, 1841, and I\r\nwas ordered to return to Fort Pierce, turn over the public property\r\nfor which I was accountable to Lieutenant H. S. Burton, and then to\r\njoin my new company at St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nI reached St. Augustine before Christmas, and was assigned to\r\ncommand a detachment of twenty men stationed at Picolata, on the\r\nSt. John's River, eighteen miles distant.  At St. Augustine were\r\nstill the headquarters of the regiment, Colonel William Gates, with\r\nCompany E, Lieutenant Bragg, and Company G, Lieutenant H. B. Judd.\r\nThe only buildings at Picolata were the one occupied by my\r\ndetachment, which had been built for a hospital, and the dwelling\r\nof a family named Williams, with whom I boarded.  On the other\r\nhand, St. Augustine had many pleasant families, among whom was\r\nprominent that of United States Judge Bronson.  I was half my time\r\nin St. Augustine or on the road, and remember the old place with\r\npleasure.  In February we received orders transferring the whole\r\nregiment to the Gulf posts, and our company, G, was ordered to\r\nescort Colonel Gates and his family across to the Suwanee River, en\r\nroute for Pensacola.  The company, with the colonel and his family,\r\nreached Picolata (where my detachment joined), and we embarked in a\r\nsteamboat for Pilatka.  Here Lieutenant Judd discovered that he had\r\nforgotten something and had to return to St. Augustine, so\r\nthat I commanded the company on the march, having with me\r\nSecond-Lieutenant George B. Ayres.  Our first march was to Fort\r\nRussell, then Micanopy, Wacahoota, and Wacasassee, all which posts\r\nwere garrisoned by the Second or Seventh Infantry.  At Wacasassee we\r\nmet General Worth and his staff, en route for Pilatka.  Lieutenant\r\nJudd overtook us about the Suwanee, where we embarked on a small\r\nboat for Cedar Keys, and there took a larger one for Pensacola,\r\nwhere the colonel and his family landed, and our company proceeded\r\non in the same vessel to our post--Fort Morgan, Mobile Point.\r\n\r\nThis fort had not been occupied by troops for many years, was very\r\ndirty, and we found little or no stores there.  Major Ogden, of the\r\nengineers, occupied a house outside the fort.  I was quartermaster\r\nand commissary, and, taking advantage of one of the engineer\r\nschooners engaged in bringing materials for the fort, I went up to\r\nMobile city, and, through the agency of Messrs.  Deshon, Taylor,\r\nand Myers, merchants, procured all essentials for the troops, and\r\nreturned to the post.  In the course of a week or ten days arrived\r\nanother company, H, commanded by Lieutenant James Ketchum, with\r\nLieutenants Rankin and Sewall L. Fish, and an assistant surgeon\r\n(Wells.)  Ketchum became the commanding officer, and Lieutenant\r\nRankin quartermaster.  We proceeded to put the post in as good\r\norder as possible; had regular guard-mounting and parades, but\r\nlittle drill.  We found magnificent fishing with the seine on the\r\nouter beach, and sometimes in a single haul we would take ten or\r\nfifteen barrels of the best kind of fish, embracing pompinos,\r\nred-fish, snappers, etc.\r\n\r\nWe remained there till June, when the regiment was ordered to\r\nexchange from the Gulf posts to those on the Atlantic, extending\r\nfrom Savannah to North Carolina.  The brig Wetumpka was chartered,\r\nand our company (G) embarked and sailed to Pensacola, where we took\r\non board another company (D) (Burke's), commanded by Lieutenant H.\r\nS. Burton, with Colonel Gates, the regimental headquarters, and\r\nsome families.  From Pensacola we sailed for Charleston, South\r\nCarolina.  The weather was hot, the winds light, and we made a long\r\npassage but at last reached Charleston Harbor, disembarked, and\r\ntook post in Fort Moultrie.\r\n\r\nSoon after two other companies arrived, Bragg's (B) and Keyes's\r\n(K).  The two former companies were already quartered inside of\r\nFort Moultrie, and these latter were placed in gun-sheds, outside,\r\nwhich were altered into barracks.  We remained at Fort Moultrie\r\nnearly five years, until the Mexican War scattered us forever.  Our\r\nlife there was of strict garrison duty, with plenty of leisure for\r\nhunting and social entertainments.  We soon formed many and most\r\npleasant acquaintances in the city of Charleston; and it so\r\nhappened that many of the families resided at Sullivan's Island in\r\nthe summer season, where we could reciprocate the hospitalities\r\nextended to us in the winter.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1843, having been continuously on duty for\r\nthree years, I applied for and received a leave of absence for\r\nthree months, which I spent mostly in Ohio.  In November I started\r\nto return to my post at Charleston by way of New Orleans; took the\r\nstage to Chillicothe, Ohio, November 16th, having Henry Stanberry,\r\nEsq., and wife, as travelling companions, We continued by stage.\r\nnext day to Portsmouth, Ohio.\r\n\r\nAt Portsmouth Mr. Stanberry took a boat up the river, and I one\r\ndown to Cincinnati.  There I found my brothers Lampson and Hoyt\r\nemployed in the \"Gazette\" printing-office, and spent much time with\r\nthem and Charles Anderson, Esq., visiting his brother Larz, Mr.\r\nLongworth, some of his artist friends, and especially Miss Sallie\r\nCarneal, then quite a belle, and noted for her fine voice,\r\n\r\nOn the 20th I took passage on the steamboat Manhattan for St.\r\nLouis; reached Louisville, where Dr. Conrad, of the army, joined\r\nme, and in the Manhattan we continued on to St. Louis, with a mixed\r\ncrowd.  We reached the Mississippi at Cairo the 23d, and St. Louis,\r\nFriday, November 24, 1843.  At St. Louis we called on Colonel S. W.\r\nKearney and Major Cooper, his adjutant-general, and found my\r\nclassmate, Lieutenant McNutt, of the ordnance, stationed at the\r\narsenal; also Mr. Deas, an artist, and Pacificus Ord, who was\r\nstudying law.  I spent a week at St. Louis, visiting the arsenal,\r\nJefferson Barracks, and most places of interest, and then became\r\nimpressed with its great future.  It then contained about forty\r\nthousand people, and my notes describe thirty-six good steamboats\r\nreceiving and discharging cargo at the levee.\r\n\r\nI took passage December 4th in the steamer John Aull for New\r\nOrleans.  As we passed Cairo the snow was falling, and the country\r\nwas wintery and devoid of verdure.  Gradually, however, as we\r\nproceeded south, the green color came; grass and trees showed the\r\nchange of latitude, and when in the course of a week we had reached\r\nNew Orleans, the roses were in full bloom, the sugar-cane just\r\nripe, and a tropical air prevalent.  We reached New Orleans\r\nDecember 11, 1843, where I spent about a week visiting the\r\nbarracks, then occupied by the Seventh Infantry; the theatres,\r\nhotels, and all the usual places of interest of that day.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of December I continued on to Mobile in the steamer\r\nFashion by way of Lake Pontchartrain; saw there most of my personal\r\nfriends, Mr. and Mrs. Bull, Judge Bragg and his brother Dunbar,\r\nDeshon, Taylor, and Myers, etc., and on the 19th of December took\r\npassage in the steamboat Bourbon for Montgomery, Alabama, by way of\r\nthe Alabama River.  We reached Montgomery at noon, December 23d,\r\nand took cars at 1 p. m. for Franklin, forty miles, which we reached\r\nat 7 p. m., thence stages for Griffin, Georgia, via La Grange and\r\nGreenville.  This took the whole night of the 23d and the day of\r\nthe 24th.  At Griffin we took cars for Macon, and thence to\r\nSavannah, which we reached Christmas-night, finding Lieutenants\r\nRidgley and Ketchum at tea, where we were soon joined by Rankin and\r\nBeckwith.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th I took the boat for Charleston, reaching my post, and\r\nreported for duty Wednesday morning, December 27, 1843.\r\n\r\nI had hardly got back to my post when, on the 21st of January,\r\n1844, I received from Lieutenant R. P. Hammond, at Marietta,\r\nGeorgia, an intimation that Colonel Churchill, Inspector-General of\r\nthe Army, had applied for me to assist him in taking depositions in\r\nupper Georgia and Alabama; concerning certain losses by volunteers\r\nin Florida of horses and equipments by reason of the failure of the\r\nUnited States to provide sufficient forage, and for which Congress\r\nhad made an appropriation.  On the 4th of February the order came\r\nfrom the Adjutant-General in Washington for me to proceed to\r\nMarietta, Georgia, and report to Inspector-General Churchill.  I\r\nwas delayed till the 14th of February by reason of being on a\r\ncourt-martial, when I was duly relieved and started by rail to\r\nAugusta, Georgia, and as far as Madison, where I took the\r\nmail-coach, reaching Marietta on the 17th.  There I reported for\r\nduty to Colonel Churchill, who was already engaged on his work,\r\nassisted by Lieutenant R. P. Hammond, Third Artillery, and a\r\ncitizen named Stockton.  The colonel had his family with him,\r\nconsisting of Mrs. Churchill, Mary, now Mrs. Professor Baird, and\r\nCharles Churchill, then a boy of about fifteen years of age.\r\n\r\nWe all lived in a tavern, and had an office convenient.  The duty\r\nconsisted in taking individual depositions of the officers and men\r\nwho had composed two regiments and a battalion of mounted\r\nvolunteers that had served in Florida.  An oath was administered to\r\neach man by Colonel Churchill, who then turned the claimant over to\r\none of us to take down and record his deposition according to\r\ncertain forms, which enabled them to be consolidated and tabulated.\r\nWe remained in Marietta about six weeks, during which time I\r\nrepeatedly rode to Kenesaw Mountain, and over the very ground where\r\nafterward, in 1864, we had some hard battles.\r\n\r\nAfter closing our business at Marietta the colonel ordered us to\r\ntransfer our operations to Bellefonte, Alabama.  As he proposed to\r\ntake his family and party by the stage, Hammond lent me his\r\nriding-horse, which I rode to Allatoona and the Etowah River.\r\nHearing of certain large Indian mounds near the way, I turned to\r\none side to visit them, stopping a couple of days with Colonel\r\nLewis Tumlin, on whose plantation these mounds were.  We struck up\r\nsuch an acquaintance that we corresponded for some years, and as I\r\npassed his plantation during the war, in 1864, I inquired for him,\r\nbut he was not at home.  From Tumlin's I rode to Rome, and by way\r\nof Wills Valley over Sand Mountain and the Raccoon Range to the\r\nTennessee River at Bellefonte, Alabama.  We all assembled there in\r\nMarch, and continued our work for nearly two months, when, having\r\ncompleted the business, Colonel Churchill, with his family, went\r\nNorth by way of Nashville; Hammond, Stockton, and I returning South\r\non horseback, by Rome, Allatoona, Marietta, Atlanta, and Madison,\r\nGeorgia.  Stockton stopped at Marietta, where he resided.  Hammond\r\ntook the cars at Madison, and I rode alone to Augusta, Georgia,\r\nwhere I left the horse and returned to Charleston and Fort Moultrie\r\nby rail.\r\n\r\nThus by a mere accident I was enabled to traverse on horseback the\r\nvery ground where in after-years I had to conduct vast armies and\r\nfight great battles.  That the knowledge thus acquired was of\r\ninfinite use to me, and consequently to the Government, I have\r\nalways felt and stated.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1844, a difficulty arose among the officers of\r\nCompany B, Third Artillery (John R. Yinton's), garrisoning Augusta\r\nArsenal, and I was sent up from Fort Moultrie as a sort of\r\npeace-maker.  After staying there some months, certain transfers of\r\nofficers were made, which reconciled the difficulty, and I returned\r\nto my post, Fort Moultrie.  During that winter, 1844-'45, I was\r\nvisiting at the plantation of Mr. Poyas, on the east branch of the\r\nCooper, about fifty miles from Fort Moultrie, hunting deer with his\r\nson James, and Lieutenant John F. Reynolds, Third Artillery.  We\r\nhad taken our stands, and a deer came out of the swamp near that of\r\nMr. James Poyas, who fired, broke the leg of the deer, which turned\r\nback into the swamp and came out again above mine.  I could follow\r\nhis course by the cry of the hounds, which were in close pursuit.\r\nHastily mounting my horse, I struck across the pine-woods to head\r\nthe deer off, and when at full career my horse leaped a fallen log\r\nand his fore-foot caught one of those hard, unyielding pineknots\r\nthat brought him with violence to the ground.  I got up as quick as\r\npossible, and found my right arm out of place at the shoulder,\r\ncaused by the weight of the double-barrelled gun.\r\n\r\nSeeing Reynolds at some distance, I called out lustily and brought\r\nhim to me.  He soon mended the bridle and saddle, which had been\r\nbroken by the fall, helped me on my horse, and we followed the\r\ncoarse of the hounds.  At first my arm did not pain me much, but it\r\nsoon began to ache so that it was almost unendurable.  In about\r\nthree miles we came to a negro hut, where I got off and rested till\r\nReynolds could overtake Poyas and bring him back.  They came at\r\nlast, but by that time the arm was so swollen and painful that I\r\ncould not ride.  They rigged up an old gig belonging to the negro,\r\nin which I was carried six miles to the plantation of Mr. Poyas,\r\nSr.  A neighboring physician was sent for, who tried the usual\r\nmethods of setting the arm, but without success; each time making\r\nthe operation more painful.  At last he sent off, got a set of\r\ndouble pulleys and cords, with which he succeeded in extending the\r\nmuscles and in getting the bone into place.  I then returned to\r\nFort Moultrie, but being disabled, applied for a short leave and\r\nwent North.\r\n\r\nI started January 25,1845; went to Washington, Baltimore, and\r\nLancaster, Ohio, whence I went to Mansfield, and thence back by\r\nNewark to Wheeling, Cumberland, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New\r\nYork, whence I sailed back for Charleston on the ship Sullivan,\r\nreaching Fort Moultrie March 9, 1845.\r\n\r\nAbout that time (March 1, 1845) Congress had, by a joint\r\nresolution, provided for the annexation of Texas, then an\r\nindependent Republic, subject to certain conditions requiring the\r\nacceptance of the Republic of Texas to be final and conclusive.  We\r\nall expected war as a matter of course.  At that time General\r\nZachary Taylor had assembled a couple of regiments of infantry and\r\none of dragoons at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, and had orders to extend\r\nmilitary protection to Texas against the Indians, or a \"foreign\r\nenemy,\" the moment the terms of annexation were accepted.  He\r\nreceived notice of such acceptance July 7th, and forthwith\r\nproceeded to remove his troops to Corpus Christi, Texas, where,\r\nduring the summer and fall of 1845, was assembled that force with\r\nwhich, in the spring of 1846, was begun the Mexican War.\r\n\r\nSome time during that summer came to Fort Moultrie orders for\r\nsending Company E, Third Artillery, Lieutenant Bragg, to New\r\nOrleans, there to receive a battery of field-guns, and thence to\r\nthe camp of General Taylor at Corpus Christi.  This was the first\r\ncompany of our regiment sent to the seat of war, and it embarked on\r\nthe brig Hayne.  This was the only company that left Fort Moultrie\r\ntill after I was detached for recruiting service on the 1st of May,\r\n1846.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Charleston afterward became famous, as the spot where\r\nbegan our civil war, a general description of it, as it was in\r\n1846, will not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThe city lies on a long peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper\r\nRivers--a low, level peninsula, of sand.  Meeting Street is its\r\nBroadway, with King Street, next west and parallel, the street of\r\nshops and small stores.  These streets are crossed at right angles\r\nby many others, of which Broad Street was the principal; and the\r\nintersection of Meeting and Broad was the heart of the city, marked\r\nby the Guard-House and St. Michael's Episcopal Church.  The\r\nCustom-House, Post-Office, etc., were at the foot of Broad Street,\r\nnear the wharves of the Cooper River front.  At the extremity of\r\nthe peninsula was a drive, open to the bay, and faced by some of\r\nthe handsomest houses of the city, called the \"Battery.\"  Looking\r\ndown the bay on the right, was James Island, an irregular triangle\r\nof about seven miles, the whole island in cultivation with\r\nsea-island cotton.  At the lower end was Fort Johnson, then simply\r\nthe station of Captain Bowman, United States Engineers, engaged in\r\nbuilding Fort Sumter.  This fort (Sumter) was erected on an\r\nartificial island nearly in mid-channel, made by dumping rocks,\r\nmostly brought as ballast in cotton-ships from the North.  As the\r\nrock reached the surface it was levelled, and made the foundation\r\nof Fort Sumter.  In 1846 this fort was barely above the water.\r\nStill farther out beyond James Island, and separated from it by a\r\nwide space of salt marsh with crooked channels, was Morris Island,\r\ncomposed of the sand-dunes thrown up by the wind and the sea,\r\nbacked with the salt marsh.  On this was the lighthouse, but no\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOn the left, looking down the bay from the Battery of Charleston,\r\nwas, first, Castle Pinckney, a round brick fort, of two tiers of\r\nguns, one in embrasure, the other in barbette, built on a marsh\r\nisland, which was not garrisoned.  Farther down the bay a point of\r\nthe mainland reached the bay, where there was a group of houses,\r\ncalled Mount Pleasant; and at the extremity of the bay, distant six\r\nmiles, was Sullivan's Island, presenting a smooth sand-beach to the\r\nsea, with the line of sand-hills or dunes thrown up by the waves\r\nand winds, and the usual backing of marsh and crooked salt-water\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nAt the shoulder of this island was Fort Moultrie, an irregular\r\nfort, without ditch or counterscarp, with a brick scarp wall about\r\ntwelve feet high, which could be scaled anywhere, and this was\r\nsurmounted by an earth parapet capable of mounting about forty\r\ntwenty-four and thirty-two pounder smooth-bore iron guns.  Inside\r\nthe fort were three two-story brick barracks, sufficient to quarter\r\nthe officers and men of two companies of artillery.\r\n\r\nAt sea was the usual \"bar,\" changing slightly from year to year,\r\nbut generally the main ship-channel came from the south, parallel\r\nto Morris Island, till it was well up to Fort Moultrie, where it\r\ncurved, passing close to Fort Sumter and up to the wharves of the\r\ncity, which were built mostly along the Cooper River front.\r\n\r\nCharleston was then a proud, aristocratic city, and assumed a\r\nleadership in the public opinion of the South far out of proportion\r\nto her population, wealth, or commerce.  On more than one occasion\r\npreviously, the inhabitants had almost inaugurated civil war, by\r\ntheir assertion and professed belief that each State had, in the\r\noriginal compact of government, reserved to itself the right to\r\nwithdraw from the Union at its own option, whenever the people\r\nsupposed they had sufficient cause.  We used to discuss these\r\nthings at our own mess-tables, vehemently and sometimes quite\r\nangrily; but I am sure that I never feared it would go further than\r\nit had already gone in the winter of 1832-'33, when the attempt at\r\n\"nullification\" was promptly suppressed by President Jackson's\r\nfamous declaration, \"The Union must and shall be preserved!\" and by\r\nthe judicious management of General Scott.\r\n\r\nStill, civil war was to be; and, now that it has come and gone, we\r\ncan rest secure in the knowledge that as the chief cause, slavery,\r\nhas been eradicated forever, it is not likely to come again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLY RECOLLECTIONS of CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n1846-1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1846 I was a first lieutenant of Company C,1,\r\nThird Artillery, stationed at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina.  The\r\ncompany was commanded by Captain Robert Anderson; Henry B. Judd was\r\nthe senior first-lieutenant, and I was the junior first-lieutenant,\r\nand George B. Ayres the second-lieutenant.  Colonel William Gates\r\ncommanded the post and regiment, with First-Lieutenant William\r\nAustine as his adjutant.  Two other companies were at the post,\r\nviz., Martin Burke's and E. D. Keyes's, and among the officers were\r\nT. W. Sherman, Morris Miller, H. B. Field, William Churchill,\r\nJoseph Stewart, and Surgeon McLaren.\r\n\r\nThe country now known as Texas had been recently acquired, and war\r\nwith Mexico was threatening.  One of our companies (Bragg's), with\r\nGeorge H. Thomas, John F. Reynolds, and Frank Thomas, had gone the\r\nyear previous and was at that time with General Taylor's army at\r\nCorpus Christi, Texas.\r\n\r\nIn that year (1846) I received the regular detail for recruiting\r\nservice, with orders to report to the general superintendent at\r\nGovernor's Island, New York; and accordingly left Fort Moultrie in\r\nthe latter part of April, and reported to the superintendent,\r\nColonel R. B. Mason, First Dragoons, at New York, on the 1st day of\r\nMay.  I was assigned to the Pittsburg rendezvous, whither I\r\nproceeded and relieved Lieutenant Scott.  Early in May I took up my\r\nquarters at the St. Charles Hotel, and entered upon the discharge\r\nof my duties.  There was a regular recruiting-station already\r\nestablished, with a sergeant, corporal, and two or three men, with\r\na citizen physician, Dr. McDowell, to examine the recruits.  The\r\nthreatening war with Mexico made a demand for recruits, and I\r\nreceived authority to open another sub-rendezvous at Zanesville,\r\nOhio, whither I took the sergeant and established him.  This was\r\nvery handy to me, as my home was at Lancaster, Ohio, only\r\nthirty-six miles off, so that I was thus enabled to visit my\r\nfriends there quite often.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of May, when at Wheeling, Virginia, on my way\r\nback from Zanesville to Pittsburg, I heard the first news of the\r\nbattle of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, which occurred on the\r\n8th and 9th of May, and, in common with everybody else, felt\r\nintensely excited.  That I should be on recruiting service, when my\r\ncomrades were actually fighting, was intolerable, and I hurried\r\non to my post, Pittsburg.  At that time the railroad did not\r\nextend west of the Alleghanies, and all journeys were made by\r\nstage-coaches.  In this instance I traveled from Zanesville to\r\nWheeling, thence to Washington (Pennsylvania), and thence to\r\nPittsburg by stage-coach.  On reaching Pittsburg I found many\r\nprivate letters; one from Ord, then a first-lieutenant in Company\r\nF, Third Artillery, at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, saying that his\r\ncompany had just received orders for California, and asking me to\r\napply for it.  Without committing myself to that project, I wrote\r\nto the Adjutant-General, R. Jones, at Washington, D. C., asking him\r\nto consider me as an applicant for any active service, and saying\r\nthat I would willingly forego the recruiting detail, which I well\r\nknew plenty of others would jump at.  Impatient to approach the\r\nscene of active operations, without authority (and I suppose\r\nwrongfully), I left my corporal in charge of the rendezvous, and\r\ntook all the recruits I had made, about twenty-five, in a steamboat\r\nto Cincinnati, and turned them over to Major N. C. McCrea,\r\ncommanding at Newport Barracks.  I then reported in Cincinnati, to\r\nthe superintendent of the Western recruiting service, Colonel\r\nFanning, an old officer with one arm, who inquired by what\r\nauthority I had come away from my post.  I argued that I took it\r\nfor granted he wanted all the recruits he could get to forward to\r\nthe army at Brownsville, Texas; and did not know but that he might\r\nwant me to go along.  Instead of appreciating my volunteer zeal, he\r\ncursed and swore at me for leaving my post without orders, and told\r\nme to go back to Pittsburg.  I then asked for an order that would\r\nentitle me to transportation back, which at first he emphatically\r\nrefused, but at last he gave the order, and I returned to\r\nPittsburg, all the way by stage, stopping again at Lancaster, where\r\nI attended the wedding of my schoolmate Mike Effinger, and also\r\nvisited my sub-rendezvous at Zanesville.  R. S. Ewell, of my class,\r\narrived to open a cavalry rendezvous, but, finding my depot there,\r\nhe went on to Columbus, Ohio.  Tom Jordan afterward was ordered\r\nto Zanesville, to take charge of that rendezvous, under\r\nthe general War Department orders increasing the number of\r\nrecruiting-stations.  I reached Pittsburg late in June, and found\r\nthe order relieving me from recruiting service, and detailing my\r\nclassmate H. B. Field to my place.  I was assigned to Company F,\r\nthen under orders for California.  By private letters from\r\nLieutenant Ord, I heard that the company had already started from\r\nFort McHenry for Governor's Island, New York Harbor, to take passage\r\nfor California in a naval transport.  I worked all that night, made\r\nup my accounts current, and turned over the balance of cash to the\r\ncitizen physician, Dr. McDowell; and also closed my clothing and\r\nproperty returns, leaving blank receipts with the same gentleman for\r\nField's signature, when he should get there, to be forwarded to the\r\nDepartment at Washington, and the duplicates to me.  These I did not\r\nreceive for more than a year.  I remember that I got my orders about\r\n8 p. m. one night, and took passage in the boat for Brownsville, the\r\nnext morning traveled by stage from Brownsville to Cumberland,\r\nMaryland, and thence by cars to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New\r\nYork, in a great hurry lest the ship might sail without me.  I found\r\nCompany F at Governor's Island, Captain C. Q. Tompkins in command,\r\nLieutenant E. O. C. Ord senior first-lieutenant, myself\r\njunior first-lieutenant, Lucien Loeser and Charles Minor the\r\nsecond-lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThe company had been filled up to one hundred privates, twelve\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and one ordnance sergeant (Layton),\r\nmaking one hundred and thirteen enlisted men and five officers.\r\nDr. James L. Ord had been employed as acting assistant surgeon to\r\naccompany the expedition, and Lieutenant H. W. Halleck, of the\r\nengineers, was also to go along.  The United States store-ship\r\nLexington was then preparing at the Navy-Yard, Brooklyn, to carry\r\nus around Cape Horn to California.  She was receiving on board the\r\nnecessary stores for the long voyage, and for service after our\r\narrival there.  Lieutenant-Commander Theodorus Bailey was in\r\ncommand of the vessel, Lieutenant William H. Macomb executive\r\nofficer, and Passed-Midshipmen Muse, Spotts, and J. W. A.\r\nNicholson, were the watch-officers; Wilson purser, and Abernethy\r\nsurgeon.  The latter was caterer of the mess, and we all made an\r\nadvance of cash for him to lay in the necessary mess-stores.  To\r\nenable us to prepare for so long a voyage and for an indefinite\r\nsojourn in that far-off country, the War Department had authorized\r\nus to draw six months' pay in advance, which sum of money we\r\ninvested in surplus clothing and such other things as seemed to us\r\nnecessary.  At last the ship was ready, and was towed down abreast\r\nof Fort Columbus, where we were conveyed on board, and on the 14th\r\nof July, 1846, we were towed to sea by a steam-tug, and cast off:\r\nColonel R. B. Mason, still superintendent of the general recruiting\r\nservice, accompanied us down the bay and out to sea, returning with\r\nthe tug.  A few other friends were of the party, but at last they\r\nleft us, and we were alone upon the sea, and the sailors were busy\r\nwith the sails and ropes.  The Lexington was an old ship, changed\r\nfrom a sloop-of-war to a store-ship, with an after-cabin, a\r\n\"ward-room,\" and \"between-decks.\"  In the cabin were Captains\r\nBailey and Tompkins, with whom messed the purser, Wilson.  In the\r\nward-room were all the other officers, two in each state-room; and\r\nMinor, being an extra lieutenant, had to sleep in a hammock slung\r\nin the ward-room.  Ord and I roomed together; Halleck and Loeser\r\nand the others were scattered about.  The men were arranged in\r\nbunks \"between-decks,\" one set along the sides of the ship, and\r\nanother, double tier, amidships.  The crew were slung in hammocks\r\nwell forward.  Of these there were about fifty.  We at once\r\nsubdivided the company into four squads, under the four lieutenants\r\nof the company, and arranged with the naval officers that our men\r\nshould serve on deck by squads, after the manner of their watches;\r\nthat the sailors should do all the work aloft, and the soldiers on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nOn fair days we drilled our men at the manual, and generally kept\r\nthem employed as much as possible, giving great attention to the\r\npolice and cleanliness of their dress and bunks; and so successful\r\nwere we in this, that, though the voyage lasted nearly two hundred\r\ndays, every man was able to leave the ship and march up the hill to\r\nthe fort at Monterey, California, carrying his own knapsack and\r\nequipments.\r\n\r\nThe voyage from New York to Rio Janeiro was without accident or any\r\nthing to vary the usual monotony.  We soon settled down to the\r\nhumdrum of a long voyage, reading some, not much; playing games,\r\nbut never gambling; and chiefly engaged in eating our meals\r\nregularly.  In crossing the equator we had the usual visit of\r\nNeptune and his wife, who, with a large razor and a bucket of\r\nsoapsuds, came over the sides and shaved some of the greenhorns;\r\nbut naval etiquette exempted the officers, and Neptune was not\r\npermitted to come aft of the mizzen-mast.  At last, after sixty\r\ndays of absolute monotony, the island of Raza, off Rio Janeiro, was\r\ndescried, and we slowly entered the harbor, passing a fort on our\r\nright hand, from which came a hail, in the Portuguese language,\r\nfrom a huge speaking-trumpet, and our officer of the deck answered\r\nback in gibberish, according to a well-understood custom of the\r\nplace.  Sugar-loaf Mountain, on the south of the entrance, is very\r\nremarkable and well named; is almost conical, with a slight lean.\r\nThe man-of-war anchorage is about five miles inside the heads,\r\ndirectly in front of the city of Rio Janeiro.  Words will not\r\ndescribe the beauty of this perfect harbor, nor the delightful\r\nfeeling after a long voyage of its fragrant airs, and the entire\r\ncontrast between all things there and what we had left in New York.\r\n\r\nWe found the United Staten frigate Columbia anchored there, and\r\nafter the Lexington was properly moored, nearly all the officers\r\nwent on shore for sight-seeing and enjoyment.  We landed at a wharf\r\nopposite which was a famous French restaurant, Farroux, and after\r\nordering supper we all proceeded to the Rua da Ouvador, where most\r\nof the shops were, especially those for making feather flowers, as\r\nmuch to see the pretty girls as the flowers which they so\r\nskillfully made; thence we went to the theatre, where, besides some\r\nopera, we witnessed the audience and saw the Emperor Dom Pedro, and\r\nhis Empress, the daughter of the King of Sicily.  After the\r\ntheatre, we went back to the restaurant, where we had an excellent\r\nsupper, with fruits of every variety and excellence, such as we had\r\nnever seen before, or even knew the names of.  Supper being over,\r\nwe called for the bill, and it was rendered in French, with\r\nBrazilian currency.  It footed up some twenty-six thousand reis.\r\nThe figures alarmed us, so we all put on the waiters' plate various\r\ncoins in gold, which he took to the counter and returned the\r\nchange, making the total about sixteen dollars.  The millreis is\r\nabout a dollar, but being a paper-money was at a discount, so as\r\nonly to be worth about fifty-six cents in coin.\r\n\r\nThe Lexington remained in Rio about a week, during which we visited\r\nthe Palace, a few miles in the country, also the Botanic Gardens, a\r\nplace of infinite interest, with its specimens of tropical fruits,\r\nspices; etc., etc., and indeed every place of note.  The thing I\r\nbest recall is a visit Halleck and I made to the Corcovado, a high\r\nmountain whence the water is conveyed for the supply of the city.\r\nWe started to take a walk, and passed along the aqueduct, which\r\napproaches the city by a aeries of arches; thence up the point of\r\nthe hill to a place known as the Madre, or fountain, to which all\r\nthe water that drips from the leaves is conducted by tile gutters,\r\nand is carried to the city by an open stone aqueduct.\r\n\r\nHere we found Mr. Henry A. Wise, of Virginia, the United States\r\nminister to Brazil, and a Dr. Garnett, United States Navy, his\r\nintended son-in-law.  We had a very interesting conversation, in\r\nwhich Mr. Wise enlarged on the fact that Rio was supplied from the\r\n\"dews of heaven,\" for in the dry season the water comes from the\r\nmists and fogs which hang around the Corcovado, drips from the\r\nleaves of the trees, and is conducted to the Madre fountain by\r\nmiles of tile gutters.  Halleck and I continued our ascent of the\r\nmountain, catching from points of the way magnificent views of the\r\nscenery round about Rio Janeiro.  We reached near the summit what\r\nwas called the emperor's coffee-plantation, where we saw\r\ncoffee-berries in their various stages, and the scaffolds on which\r\nthe berries were dried before being cleaned.  The coffee-tree\r\nreminded me of the red haw-tree of Ohio, and the berries were\r\nsomewhat like those of the same tree, two grains of coffee being\r\ninclosed in one berry.  These were dried and cleaned of the husk by\r\nhand or by machinery.  A short, steep ascent from this place\r\ncarried us to the summit, from which is beheld one of the most\r\npicturesque views on earth.  The Organ Mountains to the west and\r\nnorth, the ocean to the east, the city of Rio with its red-tiled\r\nhouses at our feet, and the entire harbor like a map spread out,\r\nwith innumerable bright valleys, make up a landscape that cannot be\r\ndescribed by mere words.  This spot is universally visited by\r\nstrangers, and has often been described.  After enjoying it\r\nimmeasurably, we returned to the city by another route, tired but\r\namply repaid by our long walk.\r\n\r\nIn due time all had been done that was requisite, and the Lexington\r\nput to sea and resumed her voyage.  In October we approached Cape\r\nHorn, the first land descried was Staten Island, white with snow,\r\nand the ship seemed to be aiming for the channel to its west,\r\nstraits of Le Maire, but her course was changed and we passed\r\naround to the east.  In time we saw Cape Horn; an island rounded\r\nlike an oven, after which it takes its name (Ornos) oven.  Here we\r\nexperienced very rough weather, buffeting about under storm\r\nstay-sails, and spending nearly a month before the wind favored our\r\npassage and enabled the course of the ship to be changed for\r\nValparaiso.  One day we sailed parallel with a French sloop-of-war,\r\nand it was sublime to watch the two ships rising and falling in\r\nthose long deep swells of the ocean.  All the time we were followed\r\nby the usual large flocks of Cape-pigeons and albatrosses of every\r\ncolor.  The former resembled the common barn-pigeon exactly, but\r\nare in fact gulls of beautiful and varied colors, mostly\r\ndove-color.  We caught many with fishing-lines baited with pork.\r\nWe also took in the same way many albatrosses.  The white ones are\r\nvery large, and their down is equal to that of the swan.  At last\r\nCape Horn and its swelling seas were left behind, and we reached\r\nValparaiso in about sixty days from Rio.  We anchored in the open\r\nroadstead, and spent there about ten days, visiting all the usual\r\nplaces of interest, its foretop, main-top, mizzen-top, etc.\r\nHalleck and Ord went up to Santiago, the capital of Chili, some\r\nsixty miles inland, but I did not go.  Valparaiso did not impress\r\nme favorably at all.  Seen from the sea, it looked like a long\r\nstring of houses along the narrow beach, surmounted with red banks\r\nof earth, with little verdure, and no trees at all.  Northward the\r\nspace widened out somewhat, and gave room for a plaza, but the mass\r\nof houses in that quarter were poor.  We were there in November,\r\ncorresponding to our early spring, and we enjoyed the large\r\nstrawberries which abounded.  The Independence frigate, Commodore\r\nShubrick, came in while we were there, having overtaken us, bound\r\nalso for California.  We met there also the sloop-of-war levant,\r\nfrom California, and from the officers heard of many of the events\r\nthat had transpired about the time the navy, under Commodore Sloat,\r\nhad taken possession of the country.\r\n\r\nAll the necessary supplies being renewed in Valparaiso, the voyage\r\nwas resumed.  For nearly forty days we had uninterrupted favorable\r\nwinds, being in the \"trades,\" and, having settled down to sailor\r\nhabits, time passed without notice.  We had brought with us all the\r\nbooks we could find in New York about California, and had read them\r\nover and over again: Wilkes's \"Exploring Expedition;\" Dana's \"Two\r\nYears before the Mast;\" and Forbes's \"Account of the Missions.\"  It\r\nwas generally understood we were bound for Monterey, then the\r\ncapital of Upper California.  We knew, of course, that General\r\nKearney was enroute for the same country overland; that Fremont was\r\ntherewith his exploring party; that the navy had already taken\r\npossession, and that a regiment of volunteers, Stevenson's, was\r\nto follow us from New York; but nevertheless we were impatient to\r\nreach our destination.  About the middle of January the ship began\r\nto approach the California coast, of which the captain was duly\r\ncautious, because the English and Spanish charts differed some\r\nfifteen miles in the longitude, and on all the charts a current of\r\ntwo miles an hour was indicated northward along the coast.  At last\r\nland was made one morning, and here occurred one of those accidents\r\nso provoking after a long and tedious voyage.  Macomb, the master\r\nand regular navigator, had made the correct observations, but\r\nNicholson during the night, by an observation on the north star,\r\nput the ship some twenty miles farther south than was the case by\r\nthe regular reckoning, so that Captain Bailey gave directions to\r\nalter the course of the ship more to the north, and to follow the\r\ncoast up, and to keep a good lookout for Point Pinos that marks the\r\nlocation of Monterey Bay.  The usual north wind slackened, so that\r\nwhen noon allowed Macomb to get a good observation, it was found\r\nthat we were north of Ano Nuevo, the northern headland of Monterey\r\nBay.  The ship was put about, but little by little arose one of\r\nthose southeast storms so common on the coast in winter, and we\r\nbuffeted about for several days, cursing that unfortunate\r\nobservation on the north star, for, on first sighting the coast,\r\nhad we turned for Monterey, instead of away to the north, we would\r\nhave been snugly anchored before the storm.  But the southeaster\r\nabated, and the usual northwest wind came out again, and we sailed\r\nsteadily down into the roadstead of Monterey Bay.  This is shaped\r\nsomewhat like a fish hook, the barb being the harbor, the point\r\nbeing Point Pinos, the southern headland.  Slowly the land came out\r\nof the water, the high mountains about Santa Cruz, the low beach of\r\nthe Saunas, and the strongly-marked ridge terminating in the sea in\r\na point of dark pine-trees.  Then the line of whitewashed houses of\r\nadobe, backed by the groves of dark oaks, resembling old\r\napple-trees; and then we saw two vessels anchored close to the\r\ntown.  One was a small merchant-brig and another a large ship\r\napparently dismasted.  At last we saw a boat coming out to meet us,\r\nand when it came alongside, we were surprised to find Lieutenant\r\nHenry Wise, master of the Independence frigate, that we had left at\r\nValparaiso.  Wise had come off to pilot us to our anchorage.  While\r\ngiving orders to the man at the wheel, he, in his peculiar fluent\r\nstyle, told to us, gathered about him, that the Independence had\r\nsailed from Valparaiso a week after us and had been in Monterey a\r\nweek; that the Californians had broken out into an insurrection;\r\nthat the naval fleet under Commodore Stockton was all down the\r\ncoast about San Diego; that General Kearney had reached the\r\ncountry, but had had a severe battle at San Pascual, and had been\r\nworsted, losing several officers and men, himself and others\r\nwounded; that war was then going on at Los Angeles; that the whole\r\ncountry was full of guerrillas, and that recently at Yerba Buena\r\nthe alcalde, Lieutenant Bartlett, United States Navy, while out\r\nafter cattle, had been lassoed, etc., etc.  Indeed, in the short\r\nspace of time that Wise was piloting our ship in, he told us more\r\nnews than we could have learned on shore in a week, and, being\r\nunfamiliar with the great distances, we imagined that we should\r\nhave to debark and begin fighting at once.  Swords were brought\r\nout, guns oiled and made ready, and every thing was in a bustle\r\nwhen the old Lexington dropped her anchor on January 26, 1847, in\r\nMonterey Bay, after a voyage of one hundred and ninety-eight days\r\nfrom New York.  Every thing on shore looked bright and beautiful,\r\nthe hills covered with grass and flowers, the live-oaks so serene\r\nand homelike, and the low adobe houses, with red-tiled roofs and\r\nwhitened walls, contrasted well with the dark pine-trees behind,\r\nmaking a decidedly good impression upon us who had come so far to\r\nspy out the land.  Nothing could be more peaceful in its looks than\r\nMonterey in January, 1847.  We had already made the acquaintance of\r\nCommodore Shubrick and the officers of the Independence in\r\nValparaiso, so that we again met as old friends.  Immediate\r\npreparations were made for landing, and, as I was quartermaster and\r\ncommissary, I had plenty to do.  There was a small wharf and an\r\nadobe custom-house in possession of the navy; also a barrack of two\r\nstories, occupied by some marines, commanded by Lieutenant Maddox;\r\nand on a hill to the west of the town had been built a two-story\r\nblock-house of hewed logs occupied by a guard of sailors under\r\ncommand of Lieutenant Baldwin, United States Navy.  Not a single\r\nmodern wagon or cart was to be had in Monterey, nothing but the old\r\nMexican cart with wooden wheels, drawn by two or three pairs of\r\noxen, yoked by the horns.  A man named Tom Cole had two or more of\r\nthese, and he came into immediate requisition.  The United States\r\nconsul, and most prominent man there at the time, was Thomas O.\r\nLarkin, who had a store and a pretty good two-story house occupied\r\nby his family.  It was soon determined that our company was to land\r\nand encamp on the hill at the block-house, and we were also to have\r\npossession of the warehouse, or custom-house, for storage.  The\r\ncompany was landed on the wharf, and we all marched in full dress\r\nwith knapsacks and arms, to the hill and relieved the guard under\r\nLieutenant Baldwin.  Tents and camp-equipage were hauled up, and\r\nsoon the camp was established.  I remained in a room at the\r\ncustomhouse, where I could superintend the landing of the stores\r\nand their proper distribution.  I had brought out from New York\r\ntwenty thousand dollars commissary funds, and eight thousand\r\ndollars quartermaster funds, and as the ship contained about six\r\nmonths' supply of provisions, also a saw-mill, grist-mill, and\r\nalmost every thing needed, we were soon established comfortably.\r\nWe found the people of Monterey a mixed set of Americans, native\r\nMexicans, and Indians, about one thousand all told.  They were kind\r\nand pleasant, and seemed to have nothing to do, except such as\r\nowned ranches in the country for the rearing of horses and cattle.\r\nHorses could be bought at any price from four dollars up to\r\nsixteen, but no horse was ever valued above a doubloon or Mexican\r\nounce (sixteen dollars).  Cattle cost eight dollars fifty cents for\r\nthe best, and this made beef net about two cents a pound, but at\r\nthat time nobody bought beef by the pound, but by the carcass.\r\n\r\nGame of all kinds--elk, deer, wild geese, and ducks--was abundant;\r\nbut coffee, sugar, and small stores, were rare and costly.\r\n\r\nThere were some half-dozen shops or stores, but their shelves were\r\nempty.  The people were very fond of riding, dancing, and of shows\r\nof any kind.  The young fellows took great delight in showing off\r\ntheir horsemanship, and would dash along, picking up a half-dollar\r\nfrom the ground, stop their horses in full career and turn about on\r\nthe space of a bullock's hide, and their skill with the lasso was\r\ncertainly wonderful.  At full speed they could cast their lasso\r\nabout the horns of a bull, or so throw it as to catch any\r\nparticular foot.  These fellows would work all day on horseback in\r\ndriving cattle or catching wildhorses for a mere nothing, but all\r\nthe money offered would not have hired one of them to walk a mile.\r\nThe girls were very fond of dancing, and they did dance gracefully\r\nand well.  Every Sunday, regularly, we had a baile, or dance, and\r\nsometimes interspersed through the week.\r\n\r\nI remember very well, soon after our arrival, that we were all\r\ninvited to witness a play called \"Adam and Eve.\"   Eve was\r\npersonated by a pretty young girl known as Dolores Gomez, who,\r\nhowever, was dressed very unlike Eve, for she was covered with a\r\npetticoat and spangles.  Adam was personated by her brother--the\r\nsame who has since become somewhat famous as the person on whom is\r\nfounded the McGarrahan claim.  God Almighty was personated, and\r\nheaven's occupants seemed very human.  Yet the play was pretty,\r\ninteresting, and elicited universal applause.  All the month of\r\nFebruary we were by day preparing for our long stay in the country,\r\nand at night making the most of the balls and parties of the most\r\nprimitive kind, picking up a smattering of Spanish, and extending\r\nour acquaintance with the people and the costumbrea del pais.  I\r\ncan well recall that Ord and I, impatient to look inland, got\r\npermission and started for the Mission of San Juan Bautista.\r\nMounted on horses, and with our carbines, we took the road by El\r\nToro, quite a prominent hill, around which passes the road to the\r\nsouth, following the Saunas or Monterey River.  After about twenty\r\nmiles over a sandy country covered with oak-bushes and scrub, we\r\nentered quite a pretty valley in which there was a ranch at the\r\nfoot of the Toro.  Resting there a while and getting some\r\ninformation, we again started in the direction of a mountain to the\r\nnorth of the Saunas, called the Gavillano.  It was quite dark when\r\nwe reached the Saunas River, which we attempted to pass at several\r\npoints, but found it full of water, and the quicksands were bad.\r\nHearing the bark of a dog, we changed our course in that direction,\r\nand, on hailing, were answered by voices which directed us where to\r\ncross.  Our knowledge of the language was limited, but we managed\r\nto understand, and to founder through the sand and water, and\r\nreached a small adobe-house on the banks of the Salinas, where we\r\nspent the night: The house was a single room, without floor or\r\nglass; only a rude door, and window with bars.  Not a particle of\r\nfood but meat, yet the man and woman entertained us with the\r\nlanguage of lords put themselves, their house, and every thing, at\r\nour  \"disposition,\" and made little barefoot children dance for our\r\nentertainment.  We made our supper of beef, and slept on a\r\nbullock's hide on the dirt-floor.  In the morning we crossed the\r\nSalinas Plain, about fifteen miles of level ground, taking a shot\r\noccasionally at wild-geese, which abounded there, and entering the\r\nwell-wooded valley that comes out from the foot of the Gavillano.\r\nWe had cruised about all day, and it was almost dark when we\r\nreached the house of a Senor Gomez, father of those who at Monterey\r\nhad performed the parts of Adam and Eve.  His house was a two-story\r\nadobe, and had a fence in front.  It was situated well up among the\r\nfoot-hills of the Gavillano, and could not be seen until within a\r\nfew yards.  We hitched our horses to the fence and went in just as\r\nGomez was about to sit down to a tempting supper of stewed hare and\r\ntortillas.  We were officers and caballeros and could not be\r\nignored.  After turning our horses to grass, at his invitation we\r\njoined him at supper.  The allowance, though ample for one, was\r\nrather short for three, and I thought the Spanish grandiloquent\r\npoliteness of Gomez, who was fat and old, was not over-cordial.\r\nHowever, down we sat, and I was helped to a dish of rabbit, with\r\nwhat I thought to be an abundant sauce of tomato.  Taking a good\r\nmouthful, I felt as though I had taken liquid fire; the tomato was\r\nchile colorado, or red pepper, of the purest kind.  It nearly\r\nkilled me, and I saw Gomez's eyes twinkle, for he saw that his\r\nshare of supper was increased.--I contented myself with bits of\r\nthe meat, and an abundant supply of tortillas.  Ord was better\r\ncase-hardened, and stood it better.  We staid at Gomez's that\r\nnight, sleeping, as all did, on the ground, and the next morning we\r\ncrossed the hill by the bridle-path to the old Mission of San Juan\r\nBautista.  The Mission was in a beautiful valley, very level, and\r\nbounded on all sides by hills.  The plain was covered with\r\nwild-grasses and mustard, and had abundant water.  Cattle and\r\nhorses were seen in all directions, and it was manifest that the\r\npriests who first occupied the country were good judges of land.\r\nIt was Sunday, and all the people, about, a hundred, had come to\r\nchurch from the country round about.  Ord was somewhat of a\r\nCatholic, and entered the church with his clanking spars and\r\nkneeled down, attracting the attention of all, for he had on the\r\nuniform of an American officer.  As soon as church was out, all\r\nrushed to the various sports.  I saw the priest, with his gray\r\nrobes tucked up, playing at billiards, others were cock fighting,\r\nand some at horse-racing.  My horse had become lame, and I resolved\r\nto buy another.  As soon as it was known that I wanted a horse,\r\nseveral came for me, and displayed their horses by dashing past and\r\nhauling them up short.  There was a fine black stallion that\r\nattracted my notice, and, after trying him myself, I concluded a\r\npurchase.  I left with the seller my own lame horse, which he was\r\nto bring to me at Monterey, when I was to pay him ten dollars for\r\nthe other.  The Mission of San Juan bore the marks of high\r\nprosperity at a former period, and had a good pear-orchard just\r\nunder the plateau where stood the church.  After spending the day,\r\nOrd and I returned to Monterey, about thirty-five miles, by a\r\nshorter route, Thus passed the month of February, and, though there\r\nwere no mails or regular expresses, we heard occasionally from\r\nYerba Buena and Sutter's Fort to the north, and from the army and\r\nnavy about Los Angeles at the south.  We also knew that a quarrel\r\nhad grown up at Los Angeles, between General Kearney, Colonel\r\nFremont, and Commodore Stockton, as to the right to control affairs\r\nin California.  Kearney had with him only the fragments of the two\r\ncompanies of dragoons, which had come across from New Mexico with\r\nhim, and had been handled very roughly by Don Andreas Pico, at San\r\nPascual, in which engagement Captains Moore and Johnson, and\r\nLieutenant Hammond, were killed, and Kearney himself wounded.\r\nThere remained with him Colonel Swords, quartermaster; Captain H.\r\nS. Turner, First Dragoons; Captains Emory and Warner, Topographical\r\nEngineers; Assistant Surgeon Griffin, and Lieutenant J. W.\r\nDavidson.  Fremont had marched down from the north with a battalion\r\nof volunteers; Commodore Stockton had marched up from San Diego to\r\nLos Angeles, with General Kearney, his dragoons, and a battalion of\r\nsailors and marines, and was soon joined there by Fremont, and they\r\njointly received the surrender of the insurgents under Andreas\r\nPico.  We also knew that General R. B. Mason had been ordered to\r\nCalifornia; that Colonel John D. Stevenson was coming out to\r\nCalifornia with a regiment of New York Volunteers; that Commodore\r\nShubrick had orders also from the Navy Department to control\r\nmatters afloat; that General Kearney, by virtue of his rank, had\r\nthe right to control all the land-forces in the service of the\r\nUnited States; and that Fremont claimed the same right by virtue of\r\na letter he had received from Colonel Benton, then a Senator, and a\r\nman of great influence with Polk's Administration.  So that among\r\nthe younger officers the query was very natural, \"Who the devil is\r\nGovernor of California?\"  One day I was on board the Independence\r\nfrigate, dining with the ward-room officers, when a war-vessel was\r\nreported in the offing, which in due time was made out to be the\r\nCyane, Captain DuPont.  After dinner we were all on deck to watch\r\nthe new arrival, the ships meanwhile exchanging signals, which were\r\ninterpreted that General Kearney was on board.  As the Cyane\r\napproached, a boat was sent to meet her, with Commodore Shubrick's\r\nflag-officer, Lieutenant Lewis, to carry the usual messages, and to\r\ninvite General Kearney to come on board the Independence as the\r\nguest of Commodore Shubrick.  Quite a number of officers were on\r\ndeck, among them  Lieutenants Wise, Montgomery Lewis, William\r\nChapman, and others, noted wits and wags of the navy.  In due time\r\nthe Cyane anchored close by, and our boat was seen returning with a\r\nstranger in the stern-sheets, clothed in army blue.  As the boat\r\ncame nearer, we saw that it was General Kearney with an old dragoon\r\ncoat on, and an army-cap, to which the general had added the broad\r\nvizor, cut from a full-dress hat, to shade his face and eyes\r\nagainst the glaring sun of the Gila region.  Chapman exclaimed:\r\n\"Fellows, the problem is solved; there is the grand-vizier (visor)\r\nby G-d!  He is Governor of California.\"\r\n\r\nAll hands received the general with great heartiness, and he soon\r\npassed out of our sight into the commodore's cabin.  Between\r\nCommodore Shubrick and General Kearney existed from that time\r\nforward the greatest harmony and good feeling, and no further\r\ntrouble existed as to the controlling power on the Pacific coast.\r\nGeneral Kearney had dispatched from San Diego his quartermaster,\r\nColonel Swords, to the Sandwich Islands, to purchase clothing and\r\nstores for his men, and had come up to Monterey, bringing with him\r\nTurner and Warner, leaving Emory and the company of dragoons below.\r\nHe was delighted to find a full strong company of artillery,\r\nsubject to his orders, well supplied with clothing and money in all\r\nrespects, and, much to the disgust of our Captain Tompkins, he took\r\nhalf of his company clothing and part of the money held by me for\r\nthe relief of his worn-out and almost naked dragoons left behind at\r\nLos Angeles.  In a few days he moved on shore, took up his quarters\r\nat Larkin's house, and established his headquarters, with Captain\r\nTurner as his adjutant general.  One day Turner and Warner were at\r\nmy tent, and, seeing a store-bag full of socks, drawers, and calico\r\nshirts, of which I had laid in a three years' supply, and of which\r\nthey had none, made known to me their wants, and I told them to\r\nhelp themselves, which Turner and Warner did.  The latter, however,\r\ninsisted on paying me the cost, and from that date to this Turner\r\nand I have been close friends.  Warner, poor fellow, was afterward\r\nkilled by Indians.  Things gradually came into shape, a\r\nsemi-monthly courier line was established from Yerba Buena to San\r\nDiego, and we were thus enabled to keep pace with events throughout\r\nthe country.  In March Stevenson's regiment arrived.  Colonel Mason\r\nalso arrived by sea from Callao in the store-ship Erie, and P. St.\r\nGeorge Cooke's battalion of Mormons reached San Luis Rey.  A. J.\r\nSmith and George Stoneman were with him, and were assigned to the\r\ncompany of dragoons at Los Angeles.  All these troops and the navy\r\nregarded General Kearney as the rightful commander, though Fremont\r\nstill remained at Los Angeles, styling himself as Governor, issuing\r\norders and holding his battalion of California Volunteers in\r\napparent defiance of General Kearney.  Colonel Mason and Major\r\nTurner were sent down by sea with a paymaster, with muster-rolls and\r\norders to muster this battalion into the service of the United\r\nStates, to pay and then to muster them out; but on their reaching\r\nLos Angeles Fremont would not consent to it, and the controversy\r\nbecame so angry that a challenge was believed to have passed between\r\nMason and Fremont, but the duel never came about.  Turner rode up by\r\nland in four or five days, and Fremont, becoming alarmed, followed\r\nhim, as we supposed, to overtake him, but he did not succeed.  On\r\nFremont's arrival at Monterey, he camped in a tent about a mile out\r\nof town and called on General Kearney, and it was reported that the\r\nlatter threatened him very severely and ordered him back to Los\r\nAngeles immediately, to disband his volunteers, and to cease the\r\nexercise of authority of any kind in the country. Feeling a natural\r\ncuriosity to see Fremont, who was then quite famous by reason of his\r\nrecent explorations and the still more recent conflicts with Kearney\r\nand Mason, I rode out to his camp, and found him in a conical tent\r\nwith one Captain Owens, who was a mountaineer, trapper, etc., but\r\noriginally from Zanesville, Ohio. I spent an hour or so with Fremont\r\nin his tent, took some tea with him, and left, without being much\r\nimpressed with him.  In due time Colonel Swords returned from the\r\nSandwich Islands and relieved me as quartermaster.  Captain William\r\nG. Marcy, son of the Secretary of War, had also come out in one of\r\nStevenson's ships as an assistant commissary of subsistence, and was\r\nstationed at Monterey and relieved me as commissary, so that I\r\nreverted to the condition of a company-officer.  While acting as a\r\nstaff officer I had lived at the custom-house in Monterey, but when\r\nrelieved I took a tent in line with the other company-officers on\r\nthe hill, where we had a mess.\r\n\r\nStevenson'a regiment reached San Francisco Bay early in March,\r\n1847.  Three companies were stationed at the Presidio under Major\r\nJames A. Hardier one company (Brackett's) at Sonoma; three, under\r\nColonel Stevenson, at Monterey; and three, under Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBurton, at Santa Barbara.  One day I was down at the headquarters\r\nat Larkin's horse, when General Kearney remarked to me that he was\r\ngoing down to Los Angeles in the ship Lexington, and wanted me to\r\ngo along as his aide.  Of course this was most agreeable to me.\r\nTwo of Stevenson's companies, with the headquarters and the\r\ncolonel, were to go also.  They embarked, and early in May we\r\nsailed for San Pedro.  Before embarking, the United States\r\nline-of-battle-ship Columbus had reached the coast from China with\r\nCommodore Biddle, whose rank gave him the supreme command of the\r\nnavy on the coast.  He was busy in calling in--\"lassooing \"--from\r\nthe land-service the various naval officers who under Stockton had\r\nbeen doing all sorts of military and civil service on shore.\r\nKnowing that I was to go down the coast with General Kearney, he\r\nsent for me and handed me two unsealed parcels addressed to\r\nLieutenant Wilson, United States Navy, and Major Gillespie, United\r\nStates Marines, at Los Angeles.  These were written orders pretty\r\nmuch in these words: \"On receipt of this order you will repair at\r\nonce on board the United States ship Lexington at San Pedro, and on\r\nreaching Monterey you will report to the undersigned.-JAMES\r\nBIDDLE.\"   Of course, I executed my part to the letter, and these\r\nofficers were duly \"lassooed.\"  We sailed down the coast with a\r\nfair wind, and anchored inside the kelp, abreast of Johnson's\r\nhouse.  Messages were forthwith dispatched up to Los Angeles,\r\ntwenty miles off, and preparations for horses made for us to ride\r\nup.  We landed, and, as Kearney held to my arm in ascending the\r\nsteep path up the bluff, he remarked to himself, rather than to me,\r\nthat it was strange that Fremont did not want to return north by\r\nthe Lexington on account of sea-sickness, but preferred to go by\r\nland over five hundred miles.  The younger officers had been\r\ndiscussing what the general would do with Fremont, who was supposed\r\nto be in a state of mutiny.  Some, thought he would be tried and\r\nshot, some that he would be carried back in irons; and all agreed\r\nthat if any one else than Fremont had put on such airs, and had\r\nacted as he had done, Kearney would have shown him no mercy, for he\r\nwas regarded as the strictest sort of a disciplinarian.  We had a\r\npleasant ride across the plain which lies between the seashore and\r\nLos Angeles, which we reached in about three hours, the infantry\r\nfollowing on foot.  We found Colonel P. St. George Cooke living at\r\nthe house of a Mr. Pryor, and the company of dragoons, with A. J.\r\nSmith, Davidson, Stoneman, and Dr. Griffin, quartered in an\r\nadobe-house close by.  Fremont held his court in the only two-story\r\nframe-house in the place.  After sometime spent at Pryor's house,\r\nGeneral Kearney ordered me to call on Fremont to notify him of his\r\narrival, and that he desired to see him.  I walked round to the\r\nhouse which had been pointed out to me as his, inquired of a man at\r\nthe door if the colonel was in, was answered \"Yea,\" and was\r\nconducted to a large room on the second floor, where very soon\r\nFremont came in, and I delivered my message.  As I was on the point\r\nof leaving, he inquired where I was going to, and I answered that I\r\nwas going back to Pryor's house, where the general was, when he\r\nremarked that if I would wait a moment he would go along.  Of\r\ncourse I waited, and he soon joined me, dressed much as a\r\nCalifornian, with the peculiar high, broad-brimmed hat, with a\r\nfancy cord, and we walked together back to Pryor's, where I left\r\nhim with General Kearney.  We spent several days very pleasantly at\r\nLos Angeles, then, as now, the chief pueblo of the south, famous\r\nfor its grapes, fruits, and wines.  There was a hill close to the\r\ntown, from which we had a perfect view of the place.  The\r\nsurrounding country is level, utterly devoid of trees, except the\r\nwillows and cotton-woods that line the Los Angeles Creek and the\r\nacequias, or ditches, which lead from it.  The space of ground\r\ncultivated in vineyards seemed about five miles by one, embracing\r\nthe town.  Every house had its inclosure of vineyard, which\r\nresembled a miniature orchard, the vines being very old, ranged in\r\nrows, trimmed very close, with irrigating ditches so arranged that\r\na stream of water could be diverted between each row of vines.  The\r\nLos Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers are fed by melting snows from a\r\nrange of mountains to the east, and the quantity of cultivated land\r\ndepends upon the amount of water.  This did not seem to be very\r\nlarge; but the San Gabriel River, close by, was represented to\r\ncontain a larger volume of water, affording the means of greatly\r\nenlarging the space for cultivation.  The climate was so moderate\r\nthat oranges, figs, pomegranates, etc....  were generally to be\r\nfound in every yard or inclosure.\r\n\r\nAt the time of our visit, General Kearney was making his\r\npreparations to return overland to the United States, and he\r\narranged to secure a volunteer escort out of the battalion of\r\nMormons that was then stationed at San Luis Rey, under Colonel\r\nCooke and a Major Hunt.  This battalion was only enlisted for one\r\nyear, and the time for their discharge was approaching, and it was\r\ngenerally understood that the majority of the men wanted to be\r\ndischarged so as to join the Mormons who had halted at Salt Lake,\r\nbut a lieutenant and about forty men volunteered to return to\r\nMissouri as the escort of General Kearney.  These were mounted on\r\nmules and horses, and I was appointed to conduct them to Monterey\r\nby land.  Leaving the party at Los Angeles to follow by sea in the\r\nLexington, I started with the Mormon detachment and traveled by\r\nland.  We averaged about thirty miles a day, stopped one day at\r\nSanta Barbara, where I saw Colonel Burton, and so on by the usually\r\ntraveled road to Monterey, reaching it in about fifteen days,\r\narriving some days in advance of the Lexington.  This gave me the\r\nbest kind of an opportunity for seeing the country, which was very\r\nsparsely populated indeed, except by a few families at the various\r\nMissions.  We had no wheeled vehicles, but packed our food and\r\nclothing on mules driven ahead, and we slept on the ground in the\r\nopen air, the rainy season having passed.  Fremont followed me by\r\nland in a few days, and, by the end of May, General Kearney was all\r\nready at Monterey to take his departure, leaving to succeed him in\r\ncommand Colonel R. B. Mason, First Dragoons.  Our Captain\r\n(Tompkins), too, had become discontented at his separation from his\r\nfamily, tendered his resignation to General Kearney, and availed\r\nhimself of a sailing-vessel bound for Callao to reach the East.\r\nColonel Mason selected me as his adjutant-general; and on the very\r\nlast day of May General Kearney, with his Mormon escort, with\r\nColonel Cooke, Colonel Swords (quartermaster), Captain Turner, and\r\na naval officer, Captain Radford, took his departure for the East\r\noverland, leaving us in full possession of California and its fate.\r\nFremont also left California with General Kearney, and with him\r\ndeparted all cause of confusion and disorder in the country.  From\r\nthat time forth no one could dispute the authority of Colonel Mason\r\nas in command of all the United States forces on shore, while the\r\nsenior naval officer had a like control afloat.  This was Commodore\r\nJames Biddle, who had reached the station from China in the\r\nColumbus, and he in turn was succeeded by Commodore T. Ap Catesby\r\nJones in the line-of-battle-ship Ohio.  At that time Monterey was\r\nour headquarters, and the naval commander for a time remained\r\nthere, but subsequently San Francisco Bay became the chief naval\r\nrendezvous.\r\n\r\nColonel R. B. Mason, First Dragoons, was an officer of great\r\nexperience, of stern character, deemed by some harsh and severe,\r\nbut in all my intercourse with him he was kind and agreeable.  He\r\nhad a large fund of good sense, and, during our long period of\r\nservice together, I enjoyed his unlimited confidence.  He had been\r\nin his day a splendid shot and hunter, and often entertained me\r\nwith characteristic anecdotes of Taylor, Twiggs, Worth, Harvey,\r\nMartin Scott, etc., etc, who were then in Mexico, gaining a\r\nnational fame.  California had settled down to a condition of\r\nabsolute repose, and we naturally repined at our fate in being\r\nso remote from the war in Mexico, where our comrades were\r\nreaping large honors.  Mason dwelt in a house not far from the\r\nCustom-House, with Captain Lanman, United States Navy; I had a small\r\nadobe-house back of Larkin's.  Halleck and Dr. Murray had a small\r\nlog-house not far off.  The company of artillery was still on the\r\nhill, under the command of Lieutenant Ord, engaged in building a\r\nfort whereon to mount the guns we had brought out in the Lexington,\r\nand also in constructing quarters out of hewn pine-logs for the men.\r\nLieutenant Minor, a very clever young officer, had taken violently\r\nsick and died about the time I got back from Los Angeles, leaving\r\nLieutenants Ord and Loeser alone with the company, with\r\nAssistant-Surgeon Robert Murray.  Captain William G. Marcy was the\r\nquartermaster and commissary.  Naglee's company of Stevenson's\r\nregiment had been mounted and was sent out against the Indians in\r\nthe San Joaquin Valley, and Shannon's company occupied the barracks.\r\nShortly after General Kearney had gone East, we found an order of\r\nhis on record, removing one Mr. Nash, the Alcalde of Sonoma, and\r\nappointing to his place ex-Governor L. W. Boggs.  A letter came to\r\nColonel and Governor Mason from Boggs, whom he had personally known\r\nin Missouri, complaining that, though he had been appointed alcalde,\r\nthe then incumbent (Nash) utterly denied Kearney's right to remove\r\nhim, because he had been elected by the people under the\r\nproclamation of Commodore Sloat, and refused to surrender his office\r\nor to account for his acts as alcalde.  Such a proclamation had been\r\nmade by Commodore Sloat shortly after the first occupation of\r\nCalifornia, announcing that the people were free and enlightened\r\nAmerican citizens, entitled to all the rights and privileges as\r\nsuch, and among them the right to elect their own officers, etc.\r\nThe people of Sonoma town and valley, some forty or fifty immigrants\r\nfrom the United States, and very few native Californians, had\r\nelected Mr. Nash, and, as stated, he refused to recognize the right\r\nof a mere military commander to eject him and to appoint another to\r\nhis place.  Neither General Kearney nor Mason had much respect for\r\nthis land of \"buncombe,\" but assumed the true doctrine that\r\nCalifornia was yet a Mexican province, held by right of conquest,\r\nthat the military commander was held responsible to the country, and\r\nthat the province should be held in statu quo until a treaty of\r\npeace.  This letter of Boggs was therefore referred to Captain\r\nBrackett, whose company was stationed at Sonoma, with orders to\r\nnotify Nash that Boggs was the rightful alcalde; that he must\r\nquietly surrender his office, with the books and records thereof,\r\nand that he must account for any moneys received from the sale of\r\ntown-lots, etc., etc.; and in the event of refusal he (Captain\r\nBrackett) must compel him by the use of force.  In due time we got\r\nBrackett's answer, saying that the little community of Sonoma was in\r\na dangerous state of effervescence caused by his orders; that Nash\r\nwas backed by most of the Americans there who had come across from\r\nMissouri with American ideas; that as he (Brackett) was a volunteer\r\nofficer, likely to be soon discharged, and as he designed to settle\r\nthere, he asked in consequence to be excused from the execution of\r\nthis (to him) unpleasant duty.  Such a request, coming to an old\r\nsoldier like Colonel Mason, aroused his wrath, and he would have\r\nproceeded rough-shod against Brackett, who, by-the-way, was a West\r\nPoint graduate, and ought to have known better; but I suggested to\r\nthe colonel that, the case being a test one, he had better send me\r\nup to Sonoma, and I would settle it quick enough.  He then gave me\r\nan order to go to Sonoma to carry out the instructions already given\r\nto Brackett.\r\n\r\nI took one soldier with me, Private Barnes, with four horses, two\r\nof which we rode, and the other two we drove ahead.  The first day\r\nwe reached Gilroy's and camped by a stream near three or four\r\nadobe-huts known as Gilroy's ranch.  The next day we passed\r\nMurphy's, San Jose, and Santa Clara Mission, camping some four\r\nmiles beyond, where a kind of hole had been dug in the ground for\r\nwater.  The whole of this distance, now so beautifully improved and\r\nsettled, was then scarcely occupied, except by poor ranches\r\nproducing horses and cattle.  The pueblo of San Jose was a string\r\nof low adobe-houses festooned with red peppers and garlic; and the\r\nMission of Santa Clara was a dilapidated concern, with its church\r\nand orchard.  The long line of poplar-trees lining the road from\r\nSan Jose to Santa Clara bespoke a former period when the priests\r\nhad ruled the land.  Just about dark I was lying on the ground near\r\nthe well, and my soldier Barnes had watered our horses and picketed\r\nthem to grass, when we heard a horse crushing his way through the\r\nhigh mustard-bushes which filled the plain, and soon a man came to\r\nus to inquire if we had seen a saddle-horse pass up the road.  We\r\nexplained to him what we had heard, and he went off in pursuit of\r\nhis horse.  Before dark he came back unsuccessful, and gave his\r\nname as Bidwell, the same gentleman who has since been a member of\r\nCongress, who is married to Miss Kennedy, of Washington City, and\r\nnow lives in princely style at Chico, California.\r\n\r\nHe explained that he was a surveyor, and had been in the lower\r\ncountry engaged in surveying land; that the horse had escaped him\r\nwith his saddle-bags containing all his notes and papers, and some\r\nsix hundred dollars in money, all the money he had earned.  He\r\nspent the night with us on the ground, and the next morning we left\r\nhim there to continue the search for his horse, and I afterward\r\nheard that he had found his saddle-bags all right, but never\r\nrecovered the horse.  The next day toward night we approached the\r\nMission of San Francisco, and the village of Yerba Buena, tired and\r\nweary--the wind as usual blowing a perfect hurricane, and a more\r\ndesolate region it was impossible to conceive of.  Leaving Barnes\r\nto work his way into the town as best he could with the tired\r\nanimals, I took the freshest horse and rode forward.  I fell in\r\nwith Lieutenant Fabius Stanley, United States Navy, and we rode\r\ninto Yerba Buena together about an hour before sundown, there being\r\nnothing but a path from the Mission into the town, deep and heavy\r\nwith drift-sand.  My horse could hardly drag one foot after the\r\nother when we reached the old Hudson Bay Company's house, which was\r\nthen the store of Howard and Mellus.  There I learned where Captain\r\nFolsom, the quartermaster, was to be found.  He was staying with a\r\nfamily of the name of Grimes, who had a small horse back of\r\nHoward's store, which must have been near where Sacramento Street\r\nnow crosses Kearney.  Folsom was a classmate of mine, had come out\r\nwith Stevenson's regiment as quartermaster, and was at the time the\r\nchief-quartermaster of the department.  His office was in the old\r\ncustom-horse standing at the northwest corner of the Plaza.  He had\r\nhired two warehouses, the only ones there at the time, of one\r\nLiedsdorff, the principal man of Yerba Buena, who also owned the\r\nonly public-house, or tavern, called the City Hotel, on Kearney\r\nStreet, at the southeast corner of the Plaza.  I stopped with\r\nFolsom at Mrs. Grimes's, and he sent my horse, as also the other\r\nthree when Barnes had got in after dark, to a coral where he had a\r\nlittle barley, but no hay.  At that time nobody fed a horse, but he\r\nwas usually turned out to pick such scanty grass as he could find\r\non the side-hills.  The few government horses used in town were\r\nusually sent out to the Presidio, where the grass was somewhat\r\nbetter.  At that time (July, 1847), what is now called San\r\nFrancisco was called Yerba Buena.  A naval officer, Lieutenant\r\nWashington A. Bartlett, its first alcalde, had caused it to be\r\nsurveyed and laid out into blocks and lots, which were being sold\r\nat sixteen dollars a lot of fifty vuras square; the understanding\r\nbeing that no single person could purchase of the alcalde more than\r\none in-lot of fifty varas, and one out-lot of a hundred varas.\r\nFolsom, however, had got his clerks, orderlies, etc., to buy lots,\r\nand they, for a small consideration, conveyed them to him, so that\r\nhe was nominally the owner of a good many lots.  Lieutenant Halleck\r\nhad bought one of each kind, and so had Warner.  Many naval\r\nofficers had also invested, and Captain Folsom advised me to buy\r\nsome, but I felt actually insulted that he should think me such a\r\nfool as to pay money for property in such a horrid place as Yerba\r\nBuena, especially ridiculing his quarter of the city, then called\r\nHappy Valley.  At that day Montgomery Street was, as now, the\r\nbusiness street, extending from Jackson to Sacramento, the water of\r\nthe bay leaving barely room for a few houses on its east side, and\r\nthe public warehouses were on a sandy beach about where the Bank of\r\nCalifornia now stands, viz., near the intersection of Sansome and\r\nCalifornia, Streets.  Along Montgomery Street were the stores of\r\nHoward & Mellus, Frank Ward, Sherman & Ruckel, Ross & Co., and it\r\nmay be one or two others.  Around the Plaza were a few houses,\r\namong them the City Hotel and the Custom-House, single-story adobes\r\nwith tiled roofs, and they were by far the most substantial and\r\nbest houses in the place.  The population was estimated at about\r\nfour hundred, of whom Kanakas (natives of the Sandwich Islands)\r\nformed the bulk.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Clay Street was a small wharf which small boats\r\ncould reach at high tide; but the principal landing-place was where\r\nsome stones had fallen into the water, about where Broadway now\r\nintersects Battery Street.  On the steep bluff above had been\r\nexcavated, by the navy, during the year before, a bench, wherein\r\nwere mounted a couple of navy-guns, styled the battery, which, I\r\nsuppose, gave name to the street.  I explained to Folsom the object\r\nof my visit, and learned from him that he had no boat in which to\r\nsend me to Sonoma, and that the only, chance to get there was to\r\nborrow a boat from the navy.  The line-of-battle-ship Columbus was\r\nthen lying at anchor off the town, and he said if I would get up\r\nearly the next morning I could go off to her in one of the\r\nmarket-boats.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I was up bright and early, down at the wharf, found a\r\nboat, and went off to the Columbus to see Commodore Biddle.  On\r\nreaching the ship and stating to the officer of the deck my\r\nbusiness, I was shown into the commodore's cabin, and soon made\r\nknown to him my object.  Biddle was a small-sized man, but\r\nvivacious in the extreme.  He had a perfect contempt for all\r\nhumbug, and at once entered into the business with extreme\r\nalacrity.  I was somewhat amused at the importance he attached to\r\nthe step.  He had a chaplain, and a private secretary, in a small\r\nroom latticed off from his cabin, and he first called on them to go\r\nout, and, when we were alone, he enlarged on the folly of Sloat's\r\nproclamation, giving the people the right to elect their own\r\nofficers, and commended Kearney and Mason for nipping that idea in\r\nthe bud, and keeping the power in their own hands.  He then sent\r\nfor the first lieutenant (Drayton), and inquired if there were\r\namong the officers on board any who had ever been in the Upper Bay,\r\nand learning that there was a midshipman (Whittaker) he was sent\r\nfor.  It so happened that this midshipman had been on a frolic on\r\nshore a few nights before, and was accordingly much frightened when\r\nsummoned into the commodore's presence, but as soon as he was\r\nquestioned as to his knowledge of the bay, he was sensibly\r\nrelieved, and professed to know every thing about it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the long boat was ordered with this midshipman and\r\neight sailors, prepared with water and provisions for several days\r\nabsence.  Biddle then asked me if I knew any of his own officers,\r\nand which one of them I would prefer to accompany me.  I knew most\r\nof them, and we settled down on Louis McLane.  He was sent for, and\r\nit was settled that McLane and I were to conduct this important\r\nmission, and the commodore enjoined on us complete secrecy, so as\r\nto insure success, and he especially cautioned us against being\r\npumped by his ward-room officers, Chapman, Lewis, Wise, etc., while\r\non board his ship.  With this injunction I was dismissed to the\r\nwardroom, where I found Chapman, Lewis, and Wise, dreadfully\r\nexercised at our profound secrecy.  The fact that McLane and I had\r\nbeen closeted with the commodore for an hour, that orders for the\r\nboat and stores had been made, that the chaplain and clerk had been\r\nsent out of the cabin, etc., etc., all excited their curiosity; but\r\nMcLane and I kept our secret well.  The general impression was,\r\nthat we had some knowledge about the fate of Captain Montgomery's\r\ntwo sons and the crew that had been lost the year before.  In 1846\r\nCaptain Montgomery commanded at Yerba Buena, on board the St. Mary\r\nsloop-of-war, and he had a detachment of men stationed up at\r\nSonoma.  Occasionally a boat was sent up with provisions or\r\nintelligence to them.  Montgomery had two sons on board his ship,\r\none a midshipman, the other his secretary.  Having occasion to send\r\nsome money up to Sonoma, he sent his two sons with a good boat and\r\ncrew.  The boat started with a strong breeze and a very large sail,\r\nwas watched from the deck until she was out of sight, and has never\r\nbeen heard of since.  There was, of coarse, much speculation as to\r\ntheir fate, some contending that the boat must have been capsized\r\nin San Pablo Bay, and that all were lost; others contending that\r\nthe crew had murdered the officers for the money, and then escaped;\r\nbut, so far as I know, not a man of that crew has ever been seen or\r\nheard of since.  When at last the boat was ready for us, we\r\nstarted, leaving all hands, save the commodore, impressed with the\r\nbelief that we were going on some errand connected with the loss of\r\nthe missing boat and crew of the St. Mary.  We sailed directly\r\nnorth, up the bay and across San Pablo, reached the month of Sonoma\r\nCreek about dark, and during the night worked up the creek some\r\ntwelve miles by means of the tide, to a landing called the\r\nEmbarcadero.  To maintain the secrecy which the commodore had\r\nenjoined on us, McLane and I agreed to keep up the delusion by\r\npretending to be on a marketing expedition to pick up chickens,\r\npigs, etc., for the mess of the Columbus, soon to depart for home.\r\n\r\nLeaving the midshipman and four sailors to guard the boat, we\r\nstarted on foot with the other four for Sonoma Town, which we soon\r\nreached.  It was a simple open square, around which were some\r\nadobe-houses, that of General Vallejo occupying one side.  On\r\nanother was an unfinished two-story adobe building, occupied as a\r\nbarrack by Bracken's company.  We soon found Captain Brackett, and\r\nI told him that I intended to take Nash a prisoner and convey him\r\nback to Monterey to answer for his mutinous behavior.  I got an old\r\nsergeant of his company, whom I had known in the Third Artillery,\r\nquietly to ascertain the whereabouts of Nash, who was a bachelor,\r\nstopping with the family of a lawyer named Green.  The sergeant\r\nsoon returned, saying that Nash had gone over to Napa, but would be\r\nback that evening; so McLane and I went up to a farm of some\r\npretensions, occupied by one Andreas Hoepner, with a pretty Sitka\r\nwife, who lived a couple of miles above Sonoma, and we bought of\r\nhim some chickens, pigs, etc.  We then visited Governor Boggs's\r\nfamily and that of General Vallejo, who was then, as now, one of\r\nthe most prominent and influential natives of California.  About\r\ndark I learned that Nash had come back, and then, giving Brackett\r\norders to have a cart ready at the corner of the plaza, McLane and\r\nI went to the house of Green.  Posting an armed sailor on each side\r\nof the house, we knocked at the door and walked in.  We found\r\nGreen, Nash, and two women, at supper.  I inquired if Nash were in,\r\nand was first answered \"No,\" but one of the women soon pointed to\r\nhim, and he rose.  We were armed with pistols, and the family was\r\nevidently alarmed.  I walked up to him and took his arm, and told\r\nhim to come along with me.  He asked me, \"Where?\" and I said,\r\n\"Monterey.\"   \"Why?\" I would explain that more at leisure.  Green\r\nput himself between me and the door, and demanded, in theatrical\r\nstyle, why I dared arrest a peaceable citizen in his house.  I\r\nsimply pointed to my pistol, and told him to get out of the way,\r\nwhich he did.  Nash asked to get some clothing, but I told him he\r\nshould want for nothing.  We passed out, Green following us with\r\nloud words, which brought the four sailors to the front-door, when\r\nI told him to hush up or I would take him prisoner also.  About\r\nthat time one of the sailors, handling his pistol carelessly,\r\ndischarged it, and Green disappeared very suddenly.  We took Nash\r\nto the cart, put him in, and proceeded back to our boat.  The next\r\nmorning we were gone.\r\n\r\nNash being out of the way, Boggs entered on his office, and the\r\nright to appoint or remove from civil office was never again\r\nquestioned in California during the military regime.  Nash was an\r\nold man, and was very much alarmed for his personal safety.  He had\r\ncome across the Plains, and had never yet seen the sea.  While on\r\nour way down the bay, I explained fully to him the state of things\r\nin California, and he admitted he had never looked on it in that\r\nlight before, and professed a willingness to surrender his office;\r\nbut, having gone so far, I thought it best to take him to Monterey.\r\nOn our way down the bay the wind was so strong, as we approached\r\nthe Columbus, that we had to take refuge behind Yerba Buena Island,\r\nthen called Goat Island, where we landed, and I killed a gray seal.\r\nThe next morning, the wind being comparatively light, we got out\r\nand worked our way up to the Columbus, where I left my prisoner on\r\nboard, and went on shore to find Commodore Biddle, who had gone to\r\ndine with Frank Ward.  I found him there, and committed Nash to his\r\ncharge, with the request that he would send him down to Monterey,\r\nwhich he did in the sloop-of-war Dale, Captain Selfridge\r\ncommanding.  I then returned to Monterey by land, and, when the\r\nDale arrived, Colonel Mason and I went on board, found poor old Mr.\r\nNash half dead with sea-sickness and fear, lest Colonel Mason would\r\ntreat him with extreme military rigor.  But, on the contrary, the\r\ncolonel spoke to him kindly, released him as a prisoner on his\r\npromise to go back to Sonoma, surrender his office to Boggs, and\r\naccount to him for his acts while in office.  He afterward came on\r\nshore, was provided with clothing and a horse, returned to Sonoma,\r\nand I never have seen him since.\r\n\r\nMatters and things settled down in Upper California, and all moved\r\nalong with peace and harmony.  The war still continued in Mexico,\r\nand the navy authorities resolved to employ their time with the\r\ncapture of Mazatlan and Guaymas.  Lower California had already been\r\noccupied by two companies of Stevenson's regiment, under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Burton, who had taken post at La Paz, and a\r\nsmall party of sailors was on shore at San Josef, near Cape San\r\nLucas, detached from the Lexington, Lieutenant-Commander Bailey.\r\nThe orders for this occupation were made by General Kearney before\r\nhe left, in pursuance of instructions from the War Department,\r\nmerely to subserve a political end, for there were few or no people\r\nin Lower California, which is a miserable, wretched, dried-up\r\npeninsula.  I remember the proclamation made by Burton and Captain\r\nBailey, in taking possession, which was in the usual florid style.\r\nBailey signed his name as the senior naval officer at the station,\r\nbut, as it was necessary to put it into Spanish to reach the\r\ninhabitants of the newly-acquired country, it was interpreted, \"El\r\nmas antiguo de todos los oficiales de la marina,\" etc., which,\r\nliterally, is \"the  most ancient of all the naval officers,\" etc.,\r\na translation at which we made some fun.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to Mazatlan was, however, for a different purpose,\r\nviz., to get possession of the ports of Mazatlan and Guaymas, as a\r\npart of the war against Mexico, and not for permanent conquest.\r\n\r\nCommodore Shubrick commanded this expedition, and took Halleck\r\nalong as his engineer-officer.  They captured Mazatlan and Guaymas,\r\nand then called on Colonel Mason to send soldiers down to hold\r\npossession, but he had none to spare, and it was found impossible\r\nto raise other volunteers either in California or Oregon, and the\r\nnavy held these places by detachments of sailors and marines till\r\nthe end of the war.  Burton also called for reenforcements, and\r\nNaglee'a company was sent to him from Monterey, and these three\r\ncompanies occupied Lower California at the end of the Mexican War.\r\nMajor Hardie still commanded at San Francisco and above; Company F,\r\nThird Artillery, and Shannon's company of volunteers, were at\r\nMonterey; Lippett's company at Santa Barbara; Colonel Stevenson,\r\nwith one company of his regiment, and the company of the First\r\nDragoons, was at Los Angeles; and a company of Mormons, reenlisted\r\nout of the Mormon Battalion, garrisoned San Diego--and thus matters\r\nwent along throughout 1847 into 1848.  I had occasion to make\r\nseveral trips to Yerba Buena and back, and in the spring of 1848\r\nColonel Mason and I went down to Santa Barbara in the sloop-of-war\r\nDale.\r\n\r\nI spent much time in hunting deer and bear in the mountains back of\r\nthe Carmel Mission, and ducks and geese in the plains of the\r\nSalinas.  As soon as the fall rains set in, the young oats would\r\nsprout up, and myriads of ducks, brant, and geese, made their\r\nappearance.  In a single day, or rather in the evening of one day\r\nand the morning of the next, I could load a pack-mule with geese\r\nand ducks.  They had grown somewhat wild from the increased number\r\nof hunters, yet, by marking well the place where a flock lighted, I\r\ncould, by taking advantage of gullies or the shape of the ground,\r\ncreep up within range; and, giving one barrel on the ground, and\r\nthe other as they rose, I have secured as many as nine at one\r\ndischarge.  Colonel Mason on one occasion killed eleven geese by\r\none discharge of small shot.  The seasons in California are well\r\nmarked.  About October and November the rains begin, and the whole\r\ncountry, plains and mountains, becomes covered with a bright-green\r\ngrass, with endless flowers.  The intervals between the rains give\r\nthe finest weather possible.  These rains are less frequent in\r\nMarch, and cease altogether in April and May, when gradually the\r\ngrass dies and the whole aspect of things changes, first to yellow,\r\nthen to brown, and by midsummer all is burnt up and dry as an\r\nashheap.\r\n\r\nWhen General Kearney first departed we took his office at Larkin's;\r\nbut shortly afterward we had a broad stairway constructed to lead\r\nfrom the outside to the upper front porch of the barracks.  By\r\ncutting a large door through the adobe-wall, we made the upper room\r\nin the centre our office; and another side-room, connected with it\r\nby a door, was Colonel Mason's private office.\r\n\r\nI had a single clerk, a soldier named Baden; and William E. P.\r\nHartnell, citizen, also had a table in the same room.  He was the\r\ngovernment interpreter, and had charge of the civil archives.\r\nAfter Halleck's return from Mazatlan, he was, by Colonel Mason,\r\nmade Secretary of State; and he then had charge of the civil\r\narchives, including the land-titles, of which Fremont first had\r\npossession, but which had reverted to us when he left the country.\r\n\r\nI remember one day, in the spring of 1848, that two men, Americans,\r\ncame into the office and inquired for the Governor.  I asked their\r\nbusiness, and one answered that they had just come down from\r\nCaptain Sutter on special business, and they wanted to see Governor\r\nMason in person.  I took them in to the colonel, and left them\r\ntogether.  After some time the colonel came to his door and called\r\nto me.  I went in, and my attention was directed to a series of\r\npapers unfolded on his table, in which lay about half an ounce of\r\nplacer gold.  Mason said to me, \"What is that?\" I touched it and\r\nexamined one or two of the larger pieces, and asked, \"Is it gold?\"\r\nMason asked me if I had ever seen native gold.  I answered that, in\r\n1844, I was in Upper Georgia, and there saw some native gold, but\r\nit was much finer than this, and that it was in phials, or in\r\ntransparent quills; but I said that, if this were gold, it could be\r\neasily tested, first, by its malleability, and next by acids.  I\r\ntook a piece in my teeth, and the metallic lustre was perfect.  I\r\nthen called to the clerk, Baden, to bring an axe and hatchet from\r\nthe backyard.  When these were brought, I took the largest piece\r\nand beat it out flat, and beyond doubt it was metal, and a pure\r\nmetal.  Still, we attached little importance to the fact, for gold\r\nwas known to exist at San Fernando, at the south, and yet was not\r\nconsidered of much value.  Colonel Mason then handed me a letter\r\nfrom Captain Sutter, addressed to him, stating that he (Sutter) was\r\nengaged in erecting a saw-mill at Coloma, about forty miles up the\r\nAmerican Fork, above his fort at New Helvetia, for the general\r\nbenefit of the settlers in that vicinity; that he had incurred\r\nconsiderable expense, and wanted a \"preemption\" to the\r\nquarter-section of land on which the mill was located, embracing the\r\ntail-race in which this particular gold had been found.  Mason\r\ninstructed me to prepare a letter, in answer, for his signature.  I\r\nwrote off a letter, reciting that California was yet a Mexican\r\nprovince, simply held by us as a conquest; that no laws of the\r\nUnited States yet applied to it, much less the land laws or\r\npreemption laws, which could only apply after a public survey.\r\nTherefore it was impossible for the Governor to promise him (Sutter)\r\na title to the land; yet, as there were no settlements within forty\r\nmiles, he was not likely to be disturbed by trespassers.  Colonel\r\nMason signed the letter, handed it to one of the gentlemen who had\r\nbrought the sample of gold, and they departed.  That gold was the\r\nfirst discovered in the Sierra Nevada, which soon revolutionized the\r\nwhole country, and actually moved the whole civilized world.  About\r\nthis time (May and June, 1848), far more importance was attached to\r\nquicksilver.  One mine, the New Almaden, twelve miles south of San\r\nJose, was well known, and was in possession of the agent of a Scotch\r\ngentleman named Forties, who at the time was British consul at\r\nTepic, Mexico.  Mr. Forties came up from San Blas in a small brig,\r\nwhich proved to be a Mexican vessel; the vessel was seized,\r\ncondemned, and actually sold, but Forties was wealthy, and bought\r\nher in.  His title to the quicksilver-mine was, however, never\r\ndisputed, as he had bought it regularly, before our conquest of the\r\ncountry, from another British subject, also named Forties, a\r\nresident of Santa Clara Mission, who had purchased it of the\r\ndiscoverer, a priest; but the boundaries of the land attached to the\r\nmine were even then in dispute.  Other men were in search of\r\nquicksilver; and the whole range of mountains near the New Almaden\r\nmine was stained with the brilliant red of the sulphuret of mercury\r\n(cinnabar).  A company composed of T. O. Larkin, J. R. Snyder, and\r\nothers, among them one John Ricord (who was quite a character), also\r\nclaimed a valuable mine near by. Ricord was a lawyer from about\r\nBuffalo, and by some means had got to the Sandwich Islands, where he\r\nbecame a great favorite of the king, Kamehameha; was his\r\nattorney-general, and got into a difficulty with the Rev. Mr. Judd,\r\nwho was a kind of prime-minister to his majesty.  One or the other\r\nhad to go, and Ricord left for San Francisco, where he arrived while\r\nColonel Mason and I were there on some business connected with the\r\ncustoms. Ricord at once made a dead set at Mason with flattery, and\r\nall sorts of spurious arguments, to convince him that our military\r\ngovernment was too simple in its forms for the new state of facts,\r\nand that he was the man to remodel it.  I had heard a good deal to\r\nhis prejudice, and did all I could to prevent Mason taking him, into\r\nhis confidence. We then started back for Monterey.  Ricord was\r\nalong, and night and day he was harping on his scheme; but he\r\ndisgusted Colonel Mason with his flattery, and, on reaching\r\nMonterey, he opened what he called a law-office, but there were\r\nneither courts nor clients, so necessity forced him to turn his\r\nthoughts to something else, and quicksilver became his hobby.  In\r\nthe spring of 1848 an appeal came to our office from San Jose, which\r\ncompelled the Governor to go up in person.  Lieutenant Loeser and I,\r\nwith a couple of soldiers, went along.  At San Jose the Governor\r\nheld some kind of a court, in which Ricord and the alcalde had a\r\nwarm dispute about a certain mine which Ricord, as a member of the\r\nLarkin Company, had opened within the limits claimed by the New\r\nAlmaden Company.  On our way up we had visited the ground, and were\r\ntherefore better prepared to understand the controversy.  We had\r\nfound at New Almaden Mr. Walkinshaw, a fine Scotch gentleman, the\r\nresident agent of Mr. Forbes.  He had built in the valley, near a\r\nsmall stream, a few board-houses, and some four or five furnaces for\r\nthe distillation of the mercury.  These were very simple in their\r\nstructure, being composed of whalers' kettles, set in masonry.\r\nThese kettles were filled with broken ore about the size of\r\nMcAdam-stone, mingled with lime.  Another kettle, reversed, formed\r\nthe lid, and the seam was luted with clay.  On applying heat, the\r\nmercury was volatilized and carried into a chimney-stack, where it\r\ncondensed and flowed back into a reservoir, and then was led in\r\npipes into another kettle outside.  After witnessing this process,\r\nwe visited the mine itself, which outcropped near the apex of the\r\nhill, about a thousand feet above the furnaces.  We found wagons\r\nhauling the mineral down the hill and returning empty, and in the\r\nmines quite a number of Sonora miners were blasting and driving for\r\nthe beautiful ore (cinnabar). It was then, and is now, a most\r\nvaluable mine. The adit of the mine was at the apex of the hill,\r\nwhich drooped off to the north.  We rode along this hill, and saw\r\nwhere many openings had been begun, but these, proving of little or\r\nno value, had been abandoned.  Three miles beyond, on the west face\r\nof the bill, we came to the opening of the \"Larkin Company.\"  There\r\nwas evidence of a good deal of work, but the mine itself was filled\r\nup by what seemed a land-slide.  The question involved in the\r\nlawsuit before the alcalde at San Jose was, first, whether the mine\r\nwas or was not on the land belonging to the New Almaden property;\r\nand, next, whether the company had complied with all the conditions\r\nof the mite laws of Mexico, which were construed to be still in\r\nforce in California.\r\n\r\nThese laws required that any one who discovered a valuable mine on\r\nprivate land should first file with the alcalde, or judge of the\r\ndistrict, a notice and claim for the benefits of such discovery;\r\nthen the mine was to be opened and followed for a distance of at\r\nleast one hundred feet within a specified time, and the claimants\r\nmust take out samples of the mineral and deposit the same with the\r\nalcalde, who was then required to inspect personally the mine, to\r\nsee that it fulfilled all the conditions of the law, before he\r\ncould give a written title.  In this case the alcalde had been to\r\nthe mine and had possession of samples of the ore; but, as the\r\nmouth of the mine was closed up, as alleged, from the act of God,\r\nby a land-slide, it was contended by Ricord and his associates that\r\nit was competent to prove by good witnesses that the mine had been\r\nopened into the hill one hundred feet, and that, by no negligence\r\nof theirs, it had caved in.  It was generally understood that\r\nRobert J. Walker, United States Secretary of the Treasury, was then\r\na partner in this mining company; and a vessel, the bark Gray\r\nEagle, was ready at San Francisco to sail for New York with the\r\ntitle-papers on which to base a joint-stock company for speculative\r\nuses.  I think the alcalde was satisfied that the law had been\r\ncomplied with, that he had given the necessary papers, and, as at\r\nthat time there was nothing developed to show fraud, the Governor\r\n(Mason) did not interfere.  At that date there was no public house\r\nor tavern in San Jose where we could stop, so we started toward\r\nSanta Cruz and encamped about ten miles out, to the west of the\r\ntown, where we fell in with another party of explorers, of whom\r\nRuckel, of San Francisco, was the head; and after supper, as we sat\r\naround the camp-fire, the conversation turned on quicksilver in\r\ngeneral, and the result of the contest in San Jose in particular.\r\nMason was relating to Ruckel the points and the arguments of\r\nRicord, that the company should not suffer from an act of God,\r\nviz., the caving in of the mouth of the mine, when a man named\r\nCash, a fellow who had once been in the quartermaster's employ as a\r\nteamster, spoke up: \"Governor Mason, did Judge Ricord say that?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Governor; and then Cash related how he and another\r\nman, whose name he gave, had been employed by Ricord to undermine a\r\nheavy rock that rested above the mouth of the mine, so that it\r\ntumbled down, carrying with it a large quantity of earth, and\r\ncompletely filled it up, as we had seen; \"and,\" said Cash, \"it took\r\nus three days of the hardest kind of work.\"  This was the act of\r\nGod, and on the papers procured from the alcalde at that time, I\r\nunderstand, was built a huge speculation, by which thousands of\r\ndollars changed hands in the United States and were lost.  This\r\nhappened long before the celebrated McGarrahan claim, which has\r\nproduced so much noise, and which still is being prosecuted in the\r\ncourts and in Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the next day we crossed over the Santa Cruz Mountains, from\r\nwhich we had sublime views of the scenery, first looking east\r\ntoward the lower Bay of San Francisco, with the bright plains of\r\nSanta Clara and San Jose, and then to the west upon the ocean, the\r\ntown of Monterey being visible sixty miles off.  If my memory is\r\ncorrect, we beheld from that mountain the firing of a salute from\r\nthe battery at Monterey, and counted the number of guns from the\r\nwhite puffs of smoke, but could not hear the sound.  That night we\r\nslept on piles of wheat in a mill at Soquel, near Santa Cruz, and,\r\nour supplies being short, I advised that we should make an early\r\nstart next morning, so as to reach the ranch of Don Juan Antonio\r\nVallejo, a particular friend, who had a large and valuable\r\ncattle-ranch on the Pajaro River, about twenty miles on our way to\r\nMonterey.  Accordingly, we were off by the first light of day, and\r\nby nine o'clock we had reached the ranch.  It was on a high point\r\nof the plateau, overlooking the plain of the Pajaro, on which were\r\ngrazing numbers of horses and cattle.  The house was of adobe, with\r\na long range of adobe-huts occupied by the semi-civilized Indians,\r\nwho at that time did all the labor of a ranch, the herding and\r\nmarking of cattle, breaking of horses, and cultivating the little\r\npatches of wheat and vegetables which constituted all the farming\r\nof that day.  Every thing about the house looked deserted, and,\r\nseeing a small Indian boy leaning up against a post, I approached\r\nhim and asked him in Spanish, \"Where is the master?\"  \"Gone to the\r\nPresidio\" (Monterey).  \"Is anybody in the house?\"  \"No.\"   \"Is it\r\nlocked up?\"  \"Yes.\"   \"Is no one about who can get in?\"  \"No.\"\r\n\"Have you any meat?\"  \"No.\"   \"Any flour or grain?\"  \"No.\"   \"Any\r\nchickens?\"  \"No.\"   \"Any eggs?\"  \"No.\"   \"What do you live on?\"\r\n\"Nada\" (nothing).  The utter indifference of this boy, and the\r\ntone of his answer \"Nada,\" attracted the attention of Colonel\r\nMason, who had been listening to our conversation, and who\r\nknew enough of Spanish to catch the meaning, and he exclaimed\r\nwith some feeling, \"So we get nada for our breakfast.\"  I felt\r\nmortified, for I had held out the prospect of a splendid\r\nbreakfast of meat and tortillas with rice, chickens, eggs, etc., at\r\nthe ranch of my friend Josh Antonio, as a justification for\r\ntaking the Governor, a man of sixty years of age, more than\r\ntwenty miles at a full canter for his breakfast.  But there was\r\nno help for it, and we accordingly went a short distance to a\r\npond, where we unpacked our mules and made a slim breakfast; on\r\nsome scraps of hard bread and a bone of pork that remained in our\r\nalforjas.  This was no uncommon thing in those days, when many\r\na ranchero with his eleven leagues of land, his hundreds of\r\nhorses and thousands of cattle, would receive us with all the\r\ngrandiloquence of a Spanish lord, and confess that he had nothing\r\nin his house to eat except the carcass of a beef hung up, from\r\nwhich the stranger might cut and cook, without money or price, what\r\nhe needed.  That night we slept on Salinas Plain, and the next\r\nmorning reached Monterey.  All the missions and houses at that\r\nperiod were alive with fleas, which the natives looked on as\r\npleasant titillators, but they so tortured me that I always gave\r\nthem a wide berth, and slept on a saddle-blanket, with the saddle\r\nfor a pillow and the serape, or blanket, for a cover.  We never\r\nfeared rain except in winter.  As the spring and summer of 1848\r\nadvanced, the reports came faster and faster from the gold-mines at\r\nSutter's saw-mill.  Stories reached us of fabulous discoveries, and\r\nspread throughout the land.  Everybody was talking of \"Gold!\r\ngold!\" until it assumed the character of a fever.  Some of our\r\nsoldiers began to desert; citizens were fitting out trains of\r\nwagons and packmules to go to the mines.  We heard of men earning\r\nfifty, five hundred, and thousands of dollars per day, and for a\r\ntime it seemed as though somebody would reach solid gold.  Some of\r\nthis gold began to come to Yerba Buena in trade, and to disturb the\r\nvalue of merchandise, particularly of mules, horses, tin pans, and\r\narticles used in mining: I of course could not escape the\r\ninfection, and at last convinced Colonel Mason that it was our duty\r\nto go up and see with our own eyes, that we might report the truth\r\nto our Government.  As yet we had no regular mail to any part of\r\nthe United States, but mails had come to us at long intervals,\r\naround Cape Horn, and one or two overland.  I well remember the\r\nfirst overland mail.  It was brought by Kit Carson in saddle-bags\r\nfrom Taos in New Mexico.  We heard of his arrival at Los Angeles,\r\nand waited patiently for his arrival at headquarters.  His fame\r\nthen was at its height, from the publication of Fremont's books,\r\nand I was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feats of\r\ndaring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still\r\nwilder Indians of the Plains.  At last his arrival was reported at\r\nthe tavern at Monterey, and I hurried to hunt him up.  I cannot\r\nexpress my surprise at beholding a small, stoop-shouldered man,\r\nwith reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, and nothing to\r\nindicate extraordinary courage or daring.  He spoke but little, and\r\nanswered questions in monosyllables.  I asked for his mail, and he\r\npicked up his light saddle-bags containing the great overland mail,\r\nand we walked together to headquarters, where he delivered his\r\nparcel into Colonel Mason's own hands.  He spent some days in\r\nMonterey, during which time we extracted with difficulty some items\r\nof his personal history.  He was then by commission a lieutenant in\r\nthe regiment of Mounted Rifles serving in Mexico under Colonel\r\nSumner, and, as he could not reach his regiment from California,\r\nColonel Mason ordered that for a time he should be assigned to duty\r\nwith A. J. Smith's company, First Dragoons, at Los Angeles.  He\r\nremained at Los Angeles some months, and was then sent back to the\r\nUnited Staten with dispatches, traveling two thousand miles almost\r\nalone, in preference to being encumbered by a large party.\r\n\r\nToward the close of June, 1848, the gold-fever being at its height,\r\nby Colonel Mason's orders I made preparations for his trip to the\r\nnewly-discovered gold-mines at Sutter's Fort.  I selected four good\r\nsoldiers, with Aaron, Colonel Mason's black servant, and a good\r\noutfit of horses and pack-mules, we started by the usually traveled\r\nroute for Yerba Buena.  There Captain Fulsom and two citizens\r\njoined our party.  The first difficulty was to cross the bay to\r\nSaucelito.  Folsom, as quartermaster, had a sort of scow with a\r\nlarge sail, with which to discharge the cargoes of ships, that\r\ncould not come within a mile of the shore.  It took nearly the\r\nwhole day to get the old scow up to the only wharf there, and then\r\nthe water was so shallow that the scow, with its load of horses,\r\nwould not float at the first high tide, but by infinite labor on\r\nthe next tide she was got off and safely crossed over to Saucelito.\r\nWe followed in a more comfortable schooner.  Having safely landed\r\nour horses and mules, we picked up and rode to San Rafael Mission,\r\nstopping with Don Timoteo Murphy.  The next day's journey took us\r\nto Bodega, where lived a man named Stephen Smith, who had the only\r\nsteam saw-mill in California.  He had a Peruvian wife, and employed\r\na number of absolutely naked Indians in making adobes.  We spent a\r\nday very pleasantly with him, and learned that he had come to\r\nCalifornia some years before, at the personal advice of Daniel\r\nWebster, who had informed him that sooner or later the United\r\nStates would be in possession of California, and that in\r\nconsequence it would become a great country.  From Bodega we\r\ntraveled to Sonoma, by way of Petaluma, and spent a day with\r\nGeneral Vallejo.  I had been there before, as related, in the\r\nbusiness of the alcalde Nash.  From Sonoma we crossed over by way\r\nof Napa, Suisun, and Vaca's ranch, to the Puta.  In the rainy\r\nseason, the plain between the Puta and Sacramento Rivers is\r\nimpassable, but in July the waters dry up; and we passed without\r\ntrouble, by the trail for Sutter's Embarcadero.  We reached the\r\nSacramento River, then full of water, with a deep, clear current.\r\nThe only means of crossing over was by an Indian dugout canoe.  We\r\nbegan by carrying across our packs and saddles, and then our\r\npeople.  When all things were ready, the horses were driven into\r\nthe water, one being guided ahead by a man in the canoe.  Of\r\ncourse, the horses and mules at first refused to take to the water,\r\nand it was nearly a day's work to get them across, and even then\r\nsome of our animals after crossing escaped into the woods and\r\nundergrowth that lined the river, but we secured enough of them to\r\nreach Sutter's Fort, three miles back from the embcarcadero, where\r\nwe encamped at the old slough, or pond, near the fort.  On\r\napplication, Captain Butter sent some Indians back into the bushes,\r\nwho recovered and brought in all our animals.  At that time there\r\nwas not the sign of a habitation there or thereabouts, except the\r\nfort, and an old adobe-house, east of the fort, known as the\r\nhospital.  The fort itself was one of adobe-walls, about twenty\r\nfeet high, rectangular in form, with two-story block houses at\r\ndiagonal corners.  The entrance was by a large gate, open by day\r\nand closed at night, with two iron ship's guns near at hand.\r\nInside there was a large house, with a good shingle-roof, used as a\r\nstorehouse, and all round the  walls were ranged rooms, the fort\r\nwall being the outer wall of the house.  The inner wall also was of\r\nadobe.  These rooms were used by Captain Sutter himself and by his\r\npeople.  He had a blacksmith's shop, carpenter's shop, etc., and\r\nother rooms where the women made blankets.  Sutter was monarch of\r\nall he surveyed, and had authority to inflict punishment even unto\r\ndeath, a power he did not fail to use.  He had horses, cattle, and\r\nsheep, and of these he gave liberally and without price to all in\r\nneed.  He caused to be driven into our camp a beef and some sheep,\r\nwhich were slaughtered for our use.  Already the goldmines were\r\nbeginning to be felt.  Many people were then encamped, some going\r\nand some coming, all full of gold-stories, and each surpassing the\r\nother.  We found preparations in progress for celebrating the\r\nFourth of July, then close at hand, and we agreed to remain over to\r\nassist on the occasion; of course, being the high officials, we\r\nwere the honored guests.  People came from a great distance to\r\nattend this celebration of the Fourth of July, and the tables were\r\nlaid in the large room inside the storehouse of the fort.  A man of\r\nsome note, named Sinclair, presided, and after a substantial meal\r\nand a reasonable supply of aguardiente we began the toasts.  All\r\nthat I remember is that Folsom and I spoke for our party; others,\r\nCaptain Sutter included, made speeches, and before the celebration\r\nwas over Sutter was enthusiastic, and many others showed the\r\neffects of the aguardiente.  The next day (namely, July 5, 1848) we\r\nresumed our journey toward the mines, and, in twenty-five miles of\r\nas hot and dusty a ride as possible, we reached Mormon Island.  I\r\nhave heretofore stated that the gold was first found in the\r\ntail-race of the stew-mill at Coloma, forty miles above Sutter's\r\nFort, or fifteen above Mormon Island, in the bed of the American\r\nFork of the Sacramento River.  It seems that Sutter had employed an\r\nAmerican named Marshall, a sort of millwright, to do this work for\r\nhim, but Marshall afterward claimed that in the matter of the\r\nsaw-mill they were copartners.  At all events, Marshall and the\r\nfamily of Mr. Wimmer were living at Coloma, where the pine-trees\r\nafforded the best material for lumber.  He had under him four white\r\nmen, Mormons, who had been discharged from Cooke's battalion, and\r\nsome Indians.  These were engaged in hewing logs, building a\r\nmill-dam, and putting up a saw-mill.  Marshall, as the architect,\r\nhad made the \"tub-wheel,\" and had set it in motion, and had also\r\nfurnished some of the rude parts of machinery necessary for an\r\nordinary up-and-down saw-mill.\r\n\r\nLabor was very scarce, expensive, and had to be economized.  The\r\nmill was built over a dry channel of the river which was calculated\r\nto be the tail-race.  After arranging his head-race, dam and\r\ntub-wheel, he let on the water to test the goodness of his\r\nmachinery.  It worked very well until it was found that the\r\ntail-race did not carry off the water fast enough, so he put his\r\nmen to work in a rude way to clear out the tail-race.  They\r\nscratched a kind of ditch down the middle of the dry channel,\r\nthrowing the coarser stones to one side; then, letting on the water\r\nagain, it would run with velocity down the channel, washing away\r\nthe dirt, thus saving labor.  This course of action was repeated\r\nseveral times, acting exactly like the long Tom afterward resorted\r\nto by the miners.  As Marshall himself was working in this ditch,\r\nhe observed particles of yellow metal which he gathered up in his\r\nhand, when it seemed to have suddenly flashed across his mind that\r\nit was gold.  After picking up about an ounce, he hurried down to\r\nthe fort to report to Captain Sutter his discovery.  Captain Sutter\r\nhimself related to me Marshall's account, saying that, as he sat in\r\nhis room at the fort one day in February or March, 1848, a knock\r\nwas heard at his door, and he called out, \"Come in.\"   In walked\r\nMarshall, who was a half-crazy man at best, but then looked\r\nstrangely wild.  \"What is the matter, Marshall!\"  Marshall\r\ninquired if any one was within hearing, and began to peer about the\r\nroom, and look under the bed, when Sutter, fearing that some\r\ncalamity had befallen the party up at the saw-mill, and that\r\nMarshall was really crazy, began to make his way to the door,\r\ndemanding of Marshall to explain what was the matter.  At last he\r\nrevealed his discovery, and laid before Captain Sutter the\r\npellicles of gold he had picked up in the ditch.  At first, Sutter\r\nattached little or no importance to the discovery, and told\r\nMarshall to go back to the mill, and say nothing of what he had\r\nseen to Mr. Wimmer, or any one else.  Yet, as it might add value to\r\nthe location, he dispatched to our headquarters at Monterey, as I\r\nhave already related, the two men with a written application for a\r\npreemption to the quarter-section of land at Coloma.  Marshall\r\nreturned to the mill, but could not keep out of his wonderful\r\nditch, and by some means the other men employed there learned his\r\nsecret.  They then wanted to gather the gold, and Marshall\r\nthreatened to shoot them if they attempted it; but these men had\r\nsense enough to know that if \"placer\"-gold existed at Coloma, it\r\nwould also be found farther down-stream, and they gradually\r\n\"prospected\" until they reached Mormon Island, fifteen miles below,\r\nwhere they discovered one of the richest placers on earth.  These\r\nmen revealed the fact to some other Mormons who were employed by\r\nCaptain Sutter at a grist-mill he was building still lower down the\r\nAmerican Fork, and six miles above his fort.  All of them struck\r\nfor higher wages, to which Sutter yielded, until they asked ten\r\ndollars a day, which he refused, and the two mills on which he had\r\nspent so much money were never built, and fell into decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, when the Mormons were driven from Nauvoo, Illinois,\r\nin 1844, they cast about for a land where they would not be\r\ndisturbed again, and fixed on California.  In the year 1845 a ship,\r\nthe Brooklyn, sailed from New York for California, with a colony of\r\nMormons, of which Sam Brannan was the leader, and we found them\r\nthere on our arrival in January, 1847.  When General Kearney, at\r\nFort Leavenworth, was collecting volunteers early in 1846, for the\r\nMexican War, he, through the instrumentality of Captain James\r\nAllen, brother to our quartermaster, General Robert Allen, raised\r\nthe battalion of Mormons at Kanesville, Iowa, now Council Bluffs,\r\non the express understanding that it would facilitate their\r\nmigration to California.  But when the Mormons reached Salt Lake,\r\nin 1846, they learned that they had been forestalled by the United\r\nStates forces in California, and they then determined to settle\r\ndown where they were.  Therefore, when this battalion of five\r\ncompanies of Mormons (raised by Allen, who died on the way, and was\r\nsucceeded by Cooke) was discharged at Los Angeles, California, in\r\nthe early summer of 1847, most of the men went to their people at\r\nSalt Lake, with all the money received, as pay from the United\r\nStates, invested in cattle and breeding-horses; one company\r\nreenlisted for another year, and the remainder sought work in the\r\ncountry.  As soon as the fame of the gold discovery spread through\r\nCalifornia, the Mormons naturally turned to Mormon Island, so that\r\nin July, 1848, we found about three hundred of them there at work.\r\nSam Brannan was on hand as the high-priest, collecting the tithes.\r\nClark, of Clark's Point, an early pioneer, was there also, and\r\nnearly all the Mormons who had come out in the Brooklyn, or who had\r\nstaid in California after the discharge of their battalion, had\r\ncollected there.  I recall the scene as perfectly to-day as though\r\nit were yesterday.  In the midst of a broken country, all parched\r\nand dried by the hot sun of July, sparsely wooded with live-oaks\r\nand straggling pines, lay the valley of the American River, with\r\nits bold mountain-stream coming out of the Snowy Mountains to the\r\neast.  In this valley is a fiat, or gravel-bed, which in high water\r\nis an island, or is overflown, but at the time of our visit was\r\nsimply a level gravel-bed of the river.  On its edges men were\r\ndigging, and filling buckets with the finer earth and gravel, which\r\nwas carried to a machine made like a baby's cradle, open at the\r\nfoot, and at the head a plate of sheet-iron or zinc, punctured full\r\nof holes.  On this metallic plate was emptied the earth, and water\r\nwas then poured on it from buckets, while one man shook the cradle\r\nwith violent rocking by a handle.  On the bottom were nailed cleats\r\nof wood.  With this rude machine four men could earn from forty to\r\none hundred dollars a day, averaging sixteen dollars, or a gold\r\nounce, per man per day.  While the' sun blazed down on the heads of\r\nthe miners with tropical heat, the water was bitter cold, and all\r\nhands were either standing in the water or had their clothes wet\r\nall the time; yet there were no complaints of rheumatism or cold.\r\nWe made our camp on a small knoll, a little below the island, and\r\nfrom it could overlook the busy scene.  A few bush-huts near by\r\nserved as stores, boardinghouses, and for sleeping; but all hands\r\nslept on the ground, with pine-leaves and blankets for bedding.  As\r\nsoon as the news spread that the Governor was there, persons came\r\nto see us, and volunteered all kinds of information, illustrating\r\nit by samples of the gold, which was of a uniform kind,\r\n\"scale-gold,\" bright and beautiful.  A large variety, of every\r\nconceivable shape and form, was found in the smaller gulches round\r\nabout, but the gold in the river-bed was uniformly \"scale-gold.\"  I\r\nremember that Mr. Clark was in camp, talking to Colonel Mason about\r\nmatters and things generally, when he inquired, \"Governor, what\r\nbusiness has Sam Brannan to collect the tithes here?\"  Clark\r\nadmitted that Brannan was the head of the Mormon church in\r\nCalifornia, and he was simply questioning as to Brannan's right, as\r\nhigh-priest, to compel the Mormons to pay him the regular tithes.\r\nColonel Mason answered, \"Brannan has a perfect right to collect the\r\ntax, if you Mormons are fools enough to pay it.\"   \"Then,\" said\r\nClark, \"I for one won't pay it any longer.\"  Colonel Mason added:\r\n\"This is public land, and the gold is the property of the United\r\nStates; all of you here are trespassers, but, as the Government is\r\nbenefited by your getting out the gold, I do not intend to\r\ninterfere.\"  I understood, afterward, that from that time the\r\npayment of the tithes ceased, but Brannan had already collected\r\nenough money wherewith to hire Sutter's hospital, and to open a\r\nstore there, in which he made more money than any merchant in\r\nCalifornia, during that summer and fall. The understanding was, that\r\nthe money collected by him as tithes was the foundation of his\r\nfortune, which is still very large in San Francisco.  That evening\r\nwe all mingled freely with the miners, and witnessed the process of\r\ncleaning up and \"panning\" out, which is the last process for\r\nseparating the pure gold from the fine dirt and black sand.\r\n\r\nThe next day we continued our journey up the valley of the American\r\nFork, stopping at various camps, where mining was in progress; and\r\nabout noon we reached Coloma, the place where gold had been first\r\ndiscovered.  The hills were higher, and the timber of better\r\nquality.  The river was narrower and bolder, and but few miners\r\nwere at work there, by reason of  Marshall's and Sutter's claim to\r\nthe site.  There stood the sawmill unfinished, the dam and\r\ntail-race just as they were left when the Mormons ceased work.\r\nMarshall and Wimmer's family of wife and half a dozen children were\r\nthere, guarding their supposed treasure; living in a house made of\r\nclapboards.  Here also we were shown many specimens of gold, of a\r\ncoarser grain than that found at Mormon Island.  The next day we\r\ncrossed the American River to its north side, and visited many\r\nsmall camps of men, in what were called the \"dry diggings.\"  Little\r\npools of water stood in the beds of the streams, and these were\r\nused to wash the dirt; and there the gold was in every conceivable\r\nshape and size, some of the specimens weighing several ounces.\r\nSome of these \"diggings\" were extremely rich, but as a whole they\r\nwere more precarious in results than at the river.  Sometimes a\r\nlucky fellow would hit on a \"pocket,\" and collect several thousand\r\ndollars in a few days, and then again he would be shifting about\r\nfrom place to place, \"prospecting,\" and spending all he had made.\r\nLittle stores were being opened at every point, where flour, bacon,\r\netc., were sold; every thing being a dollar a pound, and a meal\r\nusually costing three dollars.  Nobody paid for a bed, for he slept\r\non the ground, without fear of cold or rain.  We spent nearly a\r\nweek in that region, and were quite bewildered by the fabulous\r\ntales of recent discoveries, which at the time were confined to the\r\nseveral forks of the American and Yuba Rivers.' All this time our\r\nhorses had nothing to eat but the sparse grass in that region, and\r\nwe were forced to work our way down toward the Sacramento Valley,\r\nor to see our animals perish.  Still we contemplated a visit to the\r\nYuba and Feather Rivers, from which we had heard of more wonderful\r\n\"diggings;\" but met a courier, who announced the arrival of a ship\r\nat Monterey, with dispatches of great importance from Mazatlan.  We\r\naccordingly turned our horses back to Sutter's Fort.  Crossing the\r\nSacramento again by swimming our horses, and ferrying their loads\r\nin that solitary canoe, we took our back track as far as the Napa,\r\nand then turned to Benicia, on Carquinez Straits.  We found there a\r\nsolitary adobe-house, occupied by Mr. Hastings and his family,\r\nembracing Dr. Semple, the proprietor of the ferry.  This ferry was\r\na ship's-boat, with a latteen-sail, which could carry across at one\r\ntime six or eight horses.\r\n\r\nIt took us several days to cross over, and during that time we got\r\nwell acquainted with the doctor, who was quite a character.  He had\r\ncome to California from Illinois, and was brother to Senator\r\nSemple.  He was about seven feet high, and very intelligent.  When\r\nwe first reached Monterey, he had a printing-press, which belonged\r\nto the United States, having been captured at the custom-house, and\r\nhad been used to print custom-house blanks.  With this Dr. Semple,\r\nas editor, published the Californian, a small sheet of news, once a\r\nweek; and it was a curiosity in its line, using two v's for a w,\r\nand other combinations of letters, made necessary by want of type.\r\nAfter some time he removed to Yerba Buena with his paper, and it\r\ngrew up to be the Alta California of today.  Foreseeing, as he\r\nthought, the growth of a great city somewhere on the Bay of San\r\nFrancisco, he selected Carquinez Straits as its location, and\r\nobtained from General Vallejo a title to a league of land, on\r\ncondition of building up a city thereon to bear the name of\r\nVallejo's wife.  This was Francisca Benicia; accordingly, the new\r\ncity was named \"Francisca.\"  At this time, the town near the mouth\r\nof the bay was known universally as Yerba Buena; but that name was\r\nnot known abroad, although San Francisco was familiar to the whole\r\ncivilized world.  Now, some of the chief men of Yerba Buena,\r\nFolsom, Howard, Leidesdorf, and others, knowing the importance of a\r\nname, saw their danger, and, by some action of the ayuntamiento, or\r\ntown council, changed the name of Yerba Buena to \"San Francisco.\"\r\nDr. Semple was outraged at their changing the name to one so like\r\nhis of Francisca, and he in turn changed his town to the other name\r\nof Mrs. Vallejo, viz., \"Benicia;\" and Benicia it has remained to\r\nthis day.  I am convinced that this little circumstance was big\r\nwith consequences.  That Benicia has the best natural site for a\r\ncommercial city, I am, satisfied; and had half the money and half\r\nthe labor since bestowed upon San Francisco been expended at\r\nBenicia, we should have at this day a city of palaces on the\r\nCarquinez Straits.  The name of \"San Francisco,\" however, fixed the\r\ncity where it now is; for every ship in 1848-'49, which cleared\r\nfrom any part of the world, knew the name of San Francisco, but not\r\nYerba Buena or Benicia; and, accordingly, ships consigned to\r\nCalifornia came pouring in with their contents, and were anchored\r\nin front of Yerba Buena, the first town.  Captains and crews\r\ndeserted for the gold-mines, and now half the city in front of\r\nMontgomery Street is built over the hulks thus abandoned.  But Dr.\r\nSemple, at that time, was all there was of Benicia; he was captain\r\nand crew of his ferry boat, and managed to pass our party to the\r\nsouth side of Carquinez Straits in about two days.\r\n\r\nThence we proceeded up Amador Valley to Alameda Creek, and so on to\r\nthe old mission of San Jose; thence to the pueblo of San Jose,\r\nwhere Folsom and those belonging in Yerba Buena went in that\r\ndirection, and we continued on to Monterey, our party all the way\r\ngiving official sanction to the news from the gold-mines, and\r\nadding new force to the \"fever.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching Monterey, we found dispatches from Commodore Shubrick,\r\nat Mazatlan, which gave almost positive assurance that the war with\r\nMexico was over; that hostilities had ceased, and commissioners\r\nwere arranging the terms of peace at Guadalupe Hidalgo.  It was\r\nwell that this news reached California at that critical time; for\r\nso contagious had become the \"gold-fever\" that everybody was\r\nbound to go and try his fortune, and the volunteer regiment of\r\nStevenson's would have deserted en masse, had the men not been\r\nassured that they would very soon be entitled to an honorable\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nMany of our regulars did desert, among them the very men who had\r\nescorted us faithfully to the mines and back.  Our servants also\r\nleft us, and nothing less than three hundred dollars a month would\r\nhire a man in California; Colonel Mason's black boy, Aaron, alone\r\nof all our then servants proving faithful.  We were forced to\r\nresort to all manner of shifts to live.  First, we had a mess with\r\na black fellow we called Bustamente as cook; but he got the fever,\r\nand had to go.  We next took a soldier, but he deserted, and\r\ncarried off my double-barreled shot-gun,  which I prized very\r\nhighly.  To meet this condition of facts, Colonel Mason ordered\r\nthat liberal furloughs should be given to the soldiers, and\r\npromises to all in turn, and he allowed all the officers to draw\r\ntheir rations in kind.  As the actual valve of the ration was very\r\nlarge, this enabled us to live.  Halleck, Murray, Ord, and I,\r\nboarded with Dona Augustias, and turned in our rations as pay for\r\nour board.\r\n\r\nSome time in September, 1848, the official news of the treaty of\r\npeace reached us, and the Mexican War was over.  This treaty was\r\nsigned in May, and came to us all the way by land by a courier from\r\nLower California, sent from La Paz by Lieutenant-Colonel Burton.\r\nOn its receipt, orders were at once made for the muster-out of all\r\nof Stevenson's regiment, and our military forces were thus reduced\r\nto the single company of dragoons at Los Angeles, and the one\r\ncompany of artillery at Monterey.  Nearly all business had ceased,\r\nexcept that connected with gold; and, during that fall, Colonel\r\nMason, Captain Warner, and I, made another trip up to Sutter's\r\nFort, going also to the newly-discovered mines on the Stanislaus,\r\ncalled \"Sonora,\" named from the miners of Sonora, Mexico, who had\r\nfirst discovered them.  We found there pretty much the same state\r\nof facts as before existed at Mormon Island and Coloma, and we\r\ndaily received intelligence of the opening of still other mines\r\nnorth and south.\r\n\r\nBut I have passed over a very interesting fact.  As soon as we had\r\nreturned from our first visit to the gold-mines, it became\r\nimportant to send home positive knowledge of this valuable\r\ndiscovery.  The means of communication with the United States were\r\nvery precarious, and I suggested to Colonel Mason that a special\r\ncourier ought to be sent; that Second-Lieutenant Loeser had been\r\npromoted to first-lieutenant, and was entitled to go home.  He was\r\naccordingly detailed to carry the news.  I prepared with great care\r\nthe letter to the adjutant-general of August 17, 1848, which\r\nColonel Mason modified in a few Particulars; and, as it was\r\nimportant to send not only the specimens which had been presented\r\nto us along our route of travel, I advised the colonel to allow\r\nCaptain Folsom to purchase and send to Washington a large sample of\r\nthe commercial gold in general use, and to pay for the same out of\r\nthe money in his hands known as the \"civil fund,\" arising from\r\nduties collected at the several ports in California.  He consented\r\nto this, and Captain Folsom bought an oyster-can full at ten\r\ndollars the ounce, which was the rate of value at which it was then\r\nreceived at the custom house.  Folsom was instructed further to\r\ncontract with some vessel to carry the messenger to South America,\r\nwhere he could take the English steamers as far east as Jamaica,\r\nwith a conditional charter giving increased payment if the vessel\r\ncould catch the October steamer.  Folsom chartered the bark La\r\nLambayecana, owned and navigated by Henry D. Cooke, who has since\r\nbeen the Governor of the District of Columbia.  In due time this\r\nvessel reached Monterey, and Lieutenant Loeser, with his report and\r\nspecimens of gold, embarked and sailed.  He reached the South\r\nAmerican Continent at Payta, Peru, in time; took the English\r\nsteamer of October to Panama, and thence went on to Kingston,\r\nJamaica, where he found a sailing vessel bound for New Orleans.  On\r\nreaching New Orleans, he telegraphed to the War Department his\r\narrival; but so many delays had occurred that he did not reach\r\nWashington in time to have the matter embraced in the President's\r\nregular message of 1848, as we had calculated.  Still, the\r\nPresident made it the subject of a special message, and thus became\r\n\"official\" what had before only reached the world in a very\r\nindefinite shape.  Then began that wonderful development, and the\r\ngreat emigration to California, by land and by sea, of 1849 and\r\n1850.\r\n\r\nAs before narrated, Mason, Warner, and I, made a second visit to\r\nthe mines in September and October, 1848.  As the winter season\r\napproached, Colonel Mason returned to Monterey, and I remained for\r\na time at Sutter's Fort.  In order to share somewhat in the riches\r\nof the land, we formed a partnership in a store at Coloma, in\r\ncharge of Norman S. Bestor, who had been Warner's clerk.  We\r\nsupplied the necessary money, fifteen hundred dollars (five hundred\r\ndollars each), and Bestor carried on the store at Coloma for his\r\nshare.  Out of this investment, each of us realized a profit of\r\nabout fifteen hundred dollars.  Warner also got a regular leave of\r\nabsence, and contracted with Captain Sutter for surveying and\r\nlocating the town of Sacramento.  He received for this sixteen\r\ndollars per day for his services as surveyor; and Sutter paid all\r\nthe hands engaged in the work.  The town was laid off mostly up\r\nabout the fort, but a few streets were staked off along the river\r\nbank, and one or two leading to it.  Captain Sutter always\r\ncontended, however, that no town could possibly exist on the\r\nimmediate bank of the river, because the spring freshets rose over\r\nthe bank, and frequently it was necessary to swim a horse to reach\r\nthe boat-landing.  Nevertheless, from the very beginning the town\r\nbegan to be built on the very river-bank, viz., First, Second, and\r\nThird Streets, with J and K Streets leading back.  Among the\r\nprincipal merchants and traders of that winter, at Sacramento, were\r\nSam Brannan and Hensley, Reading & Co.  For several years the site\r\nwas annually flooded; but the people have persevered in building\r\nthe levees, and afterward in raising all the streets, so that\r\nSacramento is now a fine city, the capital of the State, and stands\r\nwhere, in 1848, was nothing but a dense mass of bushes, vines, and\r\nsubmerged land.  The old fort has disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1848, Warner, Ord, and I, camped on the bank of\r\nthe American River, abreast of the fort, at what was known as the\r\n\"Old Tan-Yard.\"  I was cook, Ord cleaned up the dishes, and Warner\r\nlooked after the horses; but Ord was deposed as scullion because he\r\nwould only wipe the tin plates with a tuft of grass, according to\r\nthe custom of the country, whereas Warner insisted on having them\r\nwashed after each meal with hot water.  Warner was in consequence\r\npromoted to scullion, and Ord became the hostler.  We drew our\r\nrations in kind from the commissary at San Francisco, who sent them\r\nup to us by a boat; and we were thus enabled to dispense a generous\r\nhospitality to many a poor devil who otherwise would have had\r\nnothing to eat.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1848 '49 was a period of intense activity throughout\r\nCalifornia.  The rainy season was unfavorable to the operations of\r\ngold-mining, and was very hard upon the thousands of houseless men\r\nand women who dwelt in the mountains, and even in the towns.  Most\r\nof the natives and old inhabitants had returned to their ranches\r\nand houses; yet there were not roofs enough in the country to\r\nshelter the thousands who had arrived by sea and by land.  The news\r\nhad gone forth to the whole civilized world that gold in fabulous\r\nquantities was to be had for the mere digging, and adventurers came\r\npouring in blindly to seek their fortunes, without a thought of\r\nhouse or food.  Yerba Buena had been converted into San Francisco.\r\nSacramento City had been laid out, lots were being rapidly sold,\r\nand the town was being built up as an entrepot to the mines.\r\nStockton also had been chosen as a convenient point for trading\r\nwith the lower or southern mines.  Captain Sutter was the sole\r\nproprietor of the former, and Captain Charles Weber was the owner\r\nof the site of Stockton, which was as yet known as \"French Camp.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLY RECOLLECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA--(CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n1849-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe department headquarters still remained at Monterey, but, with\r\nthe few soldiers, we had next to nothing to do.  In midwinter we\r\nheard of the approach of a battalion of the Second Dragoons, under\r\nMajor Lawrence Pike Graham, with Captains Rucker, Coutts, Campbell,\r\nand others, along.  So exhausted were they by their long march from\r\nUpper Mexico that we had to send relief to meet them as they\r\napproached.  When this command reached Los Angeles, it was left\r\nthere as the garrison, and Captain A. J. Smith's company of the\r\nFirst Dragoons was brought up to San Francisco.  We were also\r\nadvised that the Second Infantry, Colonel B. Riley, would be sent\r\nout around Cape Horn in sailing-ships; that the Mounted Rifles,\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Loring, would march overland to Oregon;\r\nand that Brigadier-General Persifer F. Smith would come out in\r\nchief command on the Pacific coast.  It was also known that a\r\ncontract had been entered into with parties in New York and New\r\nOrleans for a monthly line of steamers from those cities to\r\nCalifornia, via Panama.  Lieutenant-Colonel Burton had come up from\r\nLower California, and, as captain of the Third Artillery, he was\r\nassigned to command Company F, Third Artillery, at Monterey.\r\nCaptain Warner remained at Sacramento, surveying; and Halleck,\r\nMurray, Ord, and I, boarded with Dona Augustias.  The season was\r\nunusually rainy and severe, but we passed the time with the usual\r\nround of dances and parties.  The time fixed for the arrival of the\r\nmail-steamer was understood to be about January 1, 1849, but the\r\nday came and went without any tidings of her.  Orders were given to\r\nCaptain Burton to announce her arrival by firing a national\r\nsalute, and each morning we listened for the guns from the fort.\r\nThe month of January passed, and the greater part of February, too.\r\nAs was usual, the army officers celebrated the 22d of February with\r\na grand ball, given in the new stone school-house, which Alcalde\r\nWalter Colton had built.  It was the largest and best hall then in\r\nCalifornia.  The ball was really a handsome affair, and we kept it\r\nup nearly all night.  The next morning we were at breakfast:\r\npresent, Dona Augustias, and Manuelita, Halleck, Murray, and\r\nmyself.  We were dull and stupid enough until a gun from the fort\r\naroused us, then another and another.  \"The steamer\" exclaimed all,\r\nand, without waiting for hats or any thing, off we dashed.  I\r\nreached the wharf hatless, but the dona sent my cap after me by a\r\nservant.  The white puffs of smoke hung around the fort, mingled\r\nwith the dense fog, which hid all the water of the bay, and well\r\nout to sea could be seen the black spars of some unknown vessel.\r\nAt the wharf I found a group of soldiers and a small row-boat,\r\nwhich belonged to a brig at anchor in the bay.  Hastily ordering a\r\ncouple of willing soldiers to get in and take the oars, and Mr.\r\nLarkin and Mr. Hartnell asking to go along, we jumped in and pushed\r\noff.  Steering our boat toward the spars, which loomed up above the\r\nfog clear and distinct, in about a mile we came to the black hull\r\nof the strange monster, the long-expected and most welcome steamer\r\nCalifornia.  Her wheels were barely moving, for her pilot could not\r\nsee the shore-line distinctly, though the hills and Point of Pines\r\ncould be clearly made out over the fog, and occasionally a glimpse\r\nof some white walls showed where the town lay.  A \"Jacob's ladder\"\r\nwas lowered for us from the steamer, and in a minute I scrambled up\r\non deck, followed by Larkin and Hartnell, and we found ourselves\r\nin the midst of many old friends.  There was Canby, the\r\nadjutant-general, who was to take my place; Charley Hoyt, my cousin;\r\nGeneral Persifer F. Smith and wife; Gibbs, his aide-de-camp; Major\r\nOgden, of the Engineers, and wife; and, indeed, many old\r\nCalifornians, among them Alfred Robinson, and Frank Ward with his\r\npretty bride. By the time the ship was fairly at anchor we had\r\nanswered a million of questions about gold and the state of the\r\ncountry; and, learning that the ship was out of fuel, had informed\r\nthe captain (Marshall) that there was abundance of pine-wood, but no\r\nwilling hands to cut it; that no man could be hired at less than an\r\nounce of gold a day, unless the soldiers would volunteer to do it\r\nfor some agreed-upon price.  As for coal, there was not a pound in\r\nMonterey, or anywhere else in California.  Vessels with coal were\r\nknown to be en route around Cape Horn, but none had yet reached\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of this steamer was the beginning of a new epoch on the\r\nPacific coast; yet there she lay, helpless, without coal or fuel.\r\nThe native Californians, who had never seen a steamship, stood for\r\ndays on the beach looking at her, with the universal exclamation,\r\n\"Tan feo!\"--how ugly!--and she was truly ugly when compared with\r\nthe clean, well-sparred frigates and sloops-of-war that had\r\nhitherto been seen on the North Pacific coast.  It was first\r\nsupposed it would take ten days to get wood enough to prosecute her\r\nvoyage, and therefore all the passengers who could took up their\r\nquarters on shore.  Major Canby relieved me, and took the place I\r\nhad held so long as adjutant-general of the Department of\r\nCalifornia.  The time seemed most opportune for me to leave the\r\nservice, as I had several splendid offers of employment and of\r\npartnership, and, accordingly, I made my written resignation; but\r\nGeneral Smith put his veto upon it, saying that he was to command\r\nthe Division of the Pacific, while General Riley was to have the\r\nDepartment of California, and Colonel Loring that of Oregon.  He\r\nwanted me as his adjutant-general, because of my familiarity with\r\nthe country, and knowledge of its then condition: At the time, he\r\nhad on his staff Gibbs as aide-de-camp, and Fitzgerald as\r\nquartermaster.  He also had along with him quite a retinue of\r\nservants, hired with a clear contract to serve him for a whole year\r\nafter reaching California, every one of whom deserted, except a\r\nyoung black fellow named Isaac.  Mrs. Smith, a pleasant but\r\ndelicate Louisiana lady, had a white maid-servant, in whose\r\nfidelity she had unbounded confidence; but this girl was married to\r\na perfect stranger, and off before she had even landed in San\r\nFrancisco.  It was, therefore, finally arranged that, on the\r\nCalifornia, I was to accompany General Smith to San Francisco as\r\nhis adjutant-general.  I accordingly sold some of my horses, and\r\narranged for others to go up by land; and from that time I became\r\nfairly enlisted in the military family of General Persifer F.\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nI parted with my old commander, Colonel Mason, with sincere regret.\r\nTo me he had ever been kind and considerate, and, while stern,\r\nhonest to a fault, he was the very embodiment of the principle of\r\nfidelity to the interests of the General Government.  He possessed\r\na native strong intellect, and far more knowledge of the principles\r\nof civil government and law than he got credit for.  In private and\r\npublic expenditures he was extremely economical, but not penurious.\r\nIn cases where the officers had to contribute money for parties and\r\nentertainments, he always gave a double share, because of his\r\nallowance of double rations.  During our frequent journeys, I was\r\nalways caterer, and paid all the bills.  In settling with him he\r\nrequired a written statement of the items of account, but never\r\ndisputed one of them.  During our time, California was, as now,\r\nfull of a bold, enterprising, and speculative set of men, who were\r\nengaged in every sort of game to make money.  I know that\r\nColonel-Mason was beset by them to use his position to make a\r\nfortune for himself and his friends; but he never bought land or\r\ntown-lots, because, he said, it was his place to hold the public\r\nestate for the Government as free and unencumbered by claims as\r\npossible; and when I wanted him to stop the public-land sales in San\r\nFrancisco, San Jose, etc., he would not; for, although he did not\r\nbelieve the titles given by the alcaldes worth a cent, yet they\r\naided to settle the towns and public lands, and he thought, on the\r\nwhole, the Government would be benefited thereby.  The same thing\r\noccurred as to the gold-mines.  He never took a title to a town lot,\r\nunless it was one, of no real value, from Alcalde Colton, in\r\nMonterey, of which I have never heard since.  He did take a share in\r\nthe store which Warner, Beator, and I, opened at Coloma, paid his\r\nshare of the capital, five hundred dollars, and received his share\r\nof the profits, fifteen hundred dollars.  I think also he took a\r\nshare in a venture to China with Larkin and others; but, on leaving\r\nCalifornia, he was glad to sell out without profit or loss.  In the\r\nstern discharge of his duty he made some bitter enemies, among them\r\nHenry M. Naglee, who, in the newspapers of the day, endeavored to\r\ndamage his fair name.  But, knowing him intimately, I am certain\r\nthat he is entitled to all praise for having so controlled the\r\naffairs of the country that, when his successor arrived, all things\r\nwere so disposed that a civil form of government was an easy matter\r\nof adjustment.  Colonel Mason was relieved by General Riley some\r\ntime in April, and left California in the steamer of the 1st May for\r\nWashington and St. Louis, where he died of cholera in the summer of\r\n1850, and his body is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery. His widow\r\nafterward married Major (since General) Don Carlos Buell, and is now\r\nliving in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIn overhauling the hold of the steamer California, as she lay at\r\nanchor in Monterey Bay, a considerable amount of coal was found\r\nunder some heavy duplicate machinery.  With this, and such wood as\r\nhad been gathered, she was able to renew her voyage.  The usual\r\nsignal was made, and we all went on board.  About the 1st of March\r\nwe entered the Heads, and anchored off San Francisco, near the\r\nUnited States line-of-battle-ship Ohio, Commodore T. Catesby Jones.\r\nAs was the universal custom of the day, the crew of the California\r\ndeserted her; and she lay for months unable to make a trip back to\r\nPanama, as was expected of her.  As soon as we reached San\r\nFrancisco, the first thing was to secure an office and a house to\r\nlive in.  The weather was rainy and stormy, and snow even lay on\r\nthe hills back of the Mission.  Captain Folsom, the quartermaster,\r\nagreed to surrender for our office the old adobe custom house, on\r\nthe upper corner of the plaza, as soon as he could remove his\r\npapers and effects down to one of his warehouses on the beach; and\r\nhe also rented for us as quarters the old Hudson Bay Company house\r\non Montgomery Street, which had been used by Howard & Mellua as a\r\nstore, and at that very time they were moving their goods into a\r\nlarger brick building just completed for them.  As these changes\r\nwould take some time, General Smith and Colonel Ogden, with their\r\nwives, accepted the hospitality offered by Commodore Jones on board\r\nthe Ohio.  I opened the office at the custom house, and Gibbs,\r\nFitzgerald, and some others of us, slept in the loft of the Hudson\r\nBay Company house until the lower part was cleared of Howard's\r\nstore, after which General Smith and the ladies moved in.  There we\r\nhad a general mess, and the efforts at house-keeping were simply\r\nludicrous.  One servant after another, whom General Smith had\r\nbrought from New Orleans, with a solemn promise to stand by him for\r\none whole year, deserted without a word of notice or explanation,\r\nand in a few days none remained but little Isaac.  The ladies had\r\nno maid or attendants; and the general, commanding all the mighty\r\nforces of the United States on the Pacific coast, had to scratch to\r\nget one good meal a day for his family!  He was a gentleman of fine\r\nsocial qualities, genial and gentle, and joked at every thing.\r\nPoor Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Ogden did not bear it so philosophically.\r\nGibbs, Fitzgerald, and I, could cruise around and find a meal,\r\nwhich cost three dollars, at some of the many restaurants which had\r\nsprung up out of red-wood boards and cotton lining; but the general\r\nand ladies could not go out, for ladies were rara aves at that day\r\nin California.  Isaac was cook, chamber-maid, and everything,\r\nthoughtless of himself, and struggling, out of the slimmest means,\r\nto compound a breakfast for a large and hungry family.  Breakfast\r\nwould be announced any time between ten and twelve, and dinner\r\naccording to circumstances.  Many a time have I seen General Smith,\r\nwith a can of preserved meat in his hands, going toward the house,\r\ntake off his hat on meeting a negro, and, on being asked the reason\r\nof his politeness, he would answer that they were the only real\r\ngentlemen in California.  I confess that the fidelity of Colonel\r\nMason's boy \"Aaron,\" and of General Smith's boy \"Isaac,\" at a time\r\nwhen every white man laughed at promises as something made to be\r\nbroken, has given me a kindly feeling of respect for the negroes,\r\nand makes me hope that they will find an honorable \"status\" in the\r\njumble of affairs in which we now live.\r\n\r\nThat was a dull hard winter in San Francisco; the rains were heavy,\r\nand the mud fearful.  I have seen mules stumble in the street, and\r\ndrown in the liquid mud!  Montgomery Street had been filled up with\r\nbrush and clay, and I always dreaded to ride on horseback along it,\r\nbecause the mud was so deep that a horse's legs would become\r\nentangled in the bushes below, and the rider was likely to be\r\nthrown and drowned in the mud.  The only sidewalks were made of\r\nstepping-stones of empty boxes, and here and there a few planks\r\nwith barrel-staves nailed on.  All the town lay along Montgomery\r\nStreet, from Sacramento to Jackson, and about the plaza.  Gambling\r\nwas the chief occupation of the people.  While they were waiting\r\nfor the cessation of the rainy season, and for the beginning of\r\nspring, all sorts of houses were being put up, but of the most\r\nflimsy kind, and all were stores, restaurants, or gambling\r\n-saloons.  Any room twenty by sixty feet would rent for a thousand\r\ndollars a month.  I had, as my pay, seventy dollars a month, and no\r\none would even try to hire a servant under three hundred dollars.\r\nHad it not been for the fifteen hundred dollars I had made in the\r\nstore at Coloma, I could not have lived through the winter.  About\r\nthe 1st of April arrived the steamer Oregon; but her captain\r\n(Pearson) knew what was the state of affairs on shore, and ran his\r\nsteamer alongside the line-of-battle-ship Ohio at Saucelito, and\r\nobtained the privilege of leaving his crew on board as \"prisoners\"\r\nuntil he was ready to return to sea.  Then, discharging his\r\npassengers and getting coal out of some of the ships which had\r\narrived, he retook his crew out of limbo and carried the first\r\nregular mail back to Panama early in April.  In regular order\r\narrived the third steamer, the Panama; and, as the vessels were\r\narriving with coal, The California was enabled to hire a crew and\r\nget off.  From that time forward these three ships constituted the\r\nregular line of mail-steamers, which has been kept up ever since.\r\nBy the steamer Oregon arrived out Major R. P. Hammond, J. M.\r\nWilliams, James Blair, and others; also the gentlemen who, with\r\nMajor Ogden, were to compose a joint commission to select the sites\r\nfor the permanent forts and navyyard of California.  This\r\ncommission was composed of Majors Ogden, Smith, and Leadbetter, of,\r\nthe army, and Captains Goldsborough, Van Brunt, and Blunt, of the\r\nnavy.  These officers, after a most careful study of the whole\r\nsubject, selected Mare Island for the navy-yard, and \"Benicia\" for\r\nthe storehouses and arsenals of the army.  The Pacific Mail\r\nSteamship Company also selected Benicia as their depot.  Thus was\r\nagain revived the old struggle for supremacy of these  two points\r\nas the site of the future city of the Pacific.  Meantime, however,\r\nSan Francisco had secured the name.  About six hundred ships were\r\nanchored there without crews, and could not get away; and there the\r\ncity was, and had to be.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, General Smith, being disinterested and unprejudiced,\r\ndecided on Benicia as the point where the city ought to be, and\r\nwhere the army headquarters should be.  By the Oregon there arrived\r\nat San Francisco a man who deserves mention here--Baron\r\nSteinberger.  He had been a great cattle-dealer in the United\r\nStates, and boasted that he had helped to break the United States\r\nBank, by being indebted to it five million dollars! At all events,\r\nhe was a splendid looking fellow, and brought with him from\r\nWashington a letter to General Smith and another for Commodore\r\nJones, to the effect that he was a man of enlarged experience in\r\nbeef; that the authorities in Washington knew that there existed in\r\nCalifornia large herds of cattle, which were only valuable for\r\ntheir hides and tallow; that it was of great importance to the\r\nGovernment that this beef should be cured and salted so as to be of\r\nuse to the army and navy, obviating the necessity of shipping\r\nsalt-beef around Cape Horn.  I know he had such a letter from the\r\nSecretary of War, Marcy, to General Smith, for it passed into my\r\ncustody, and I happened to be in Commodore Jones's cabin when the\r\nbaron presented the one for him from the Secretary of the Navy.\r\nThe baron was anxious to pitch in at once, and said that all he\r\nneeded to start with were salt and barrels.  After some inquiries\r\nof his purser, the commodore promised to let him have the barrels\r\nwith their salt, as fast as they were emptied by the crew.  Then\r\nthe baron explained that he could get a nice lot of cattle from Don\r\nTimoteo Murphy, at the Mission of San Rafael, on the north aide of\r\nthe bay, but he could not get a boat and crew to handle them.\r\nUnder the authority from the Secretary of the Navy, the commodore\r\nthen promised him the use of a boat and crew, until he (the baron)\r\ncould find and purchase a suitable one for himself.  Then the baron\r\nopened the first regular butcher-shop in San Francisco, on the\r\nwharf about the foot of Broadway or Pacific Street, where we could\r\nbuy at twenty-five or fifty cents a pound the best roasts, steaks,\r\nand cuts of beef, which had cost him nothing, for he never paid\r\nanybody if he could help it, and he soon cleaned poor Don Timoteo\r\nout.  At first, every boat of his, in coming down from the San\r\nRafael, touched at the Ohio, and left the best beefsteaks and\r\nroasts for the commodore, but soon the baron had enough money to\r\ndispense with the borrowed boat, and set up for himself, and from\r\nthis small beginning, step by step, he rose in a few months to be\r\none of the richest and most influential men in San Francisco; but\r\nin his wild speculations he was at last caught, and became\r\nhelplessly bankrupt.  He followed General Fremont to St. Louis in\r\n1861, where I saw him, but soon afterward he died a pauper in one\r\nof the hospitals.  When General Smith had his headquarters in San\r\nFrancisco, in the spring of 1849, Steinberger gave dinners worthy\r\nany baron of old; and when, in after-years, I was a banker there,\r\nhe used to borrow of me small sums of money in repayment for my\r\nshare of these feasts; and somewhere among my old packages I hold\r\none of his confidential notes for two hundred dollars, but on the\r\nwhole I got off easily.  I have no doubt that, if this man's\r\nhistory could be written out, it would present phases as wonderful\r\nas any of romance; but in my judgment he was a dangerous man,\r\nwithout any true-sense of honor or honesty.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the rains of that season grew less and less, and\r\nthe hills once more became green and covered with flowers.  It\r\nbecame perfectly evident that no family could live in San Francisco\r\non such a salary as Uncle Sam allowed his most favored officials;\r\nso General Smith and Major Ogden concluded to send their families\r\nback to the United States, and afterward we men-folks could take to\r\ncamp and live on our rations.  The Second Infantry had arrived, and\r\nhad been distributed, four companies to Monterey, and the rest\r\nsomewhat as Stevenson's regiment had been.  A. J. Smith's company\r\nof dragoons was sent up to Sonoma, whither General Smith had\r\nresolved to move our headquarters.  On the steamer which sailed\r\nabout May 1st (I think the California), we embarked, the ladies for\r\nhome and we for Monterey.  At Monterey we went on shore, and\r\nColonel Mason, who meantime had been relieved by General Riley,\r\nwent on board, and the steamer departed for Panama.  Of all that\r\nparty I alone am alive.\r\n\r\nGeneral Riley had, with his family, taken the house which Colonel\r\nMason had formerly used, and Major Canby and wife had secured rooms\r\nat Alvarado's.  Captain Bane was quartermaster, and had his family\r\nin the house of a man named Garner, near the redoubt.  Burton and\r\nCompany F were still at the fort; the four companies of the Second\r\nInfantry were quartered in the barracks, the same building in which\r\nwe had had our headquarters; and the company officers were\r\nquartered in hired buildings near by.  General Smith and his aide,\r\nCaptain Gibbs, went to Larkin's house, and I was at my old rooms at\r\nDona Augustias.  As we intended to go back to San Francisco by land\r\nand afterward to travel a good deal, General Smith gave me the\r\nnecessary authority to fit out the party.  There happened to be\r\nseveral trains of horses and mules in town, so I purchased about a\r\ndozen horses and mules at two hundred dollars a head, on account of\r\nthe Quartermaster's Department, and we had them kept under guard in\r\nthe quartermaster's corral.\r\n\r\nI remember one night being in the quarters of Lieutenant Alfred\r\nSully, where nearly all the officers of the garrison were\r\nassembled, listening to Sully's stories.  Lieutenant Derby,\r\n\"Squibob,\" was one of the number, as also Fred Steele, \"Neighbor\"\r\nJones, and others, when, just after \"tattoo,\" the orderly-sergeants\r\ncame to report the result of  \"tattoo\" roll-call; one reported five\r\nmen absent, another eight, and so on, until it became certain that\r\ntwenty-eight men had deserted; and they were so bold and open in\r\ntheir behavior that it amounted to defiance.  They had deliberately\r\nslung their knapsacks and started for the gold-mines.  Dr. Murray\r\nand I were the only ones present who were familiar with the\r\ncountry, and I explained how easy they could all be taken by a\r\nparty going out at once to Salinas Plain, where the country was so\r\nopen and level that a rabbit could not cross without being seen;\r\nthat the deserters could not go to the mines without crossing that\r\nplain, and could not reach it before daylight.  All agreed that the\r\nwhole regiment would desert if these men were not brought back.\r\nSeveral officers volunteered on the spot to go after them; and, as\r\nthe soldiers could not be trusted, it was useless to send any but\r\nofficers in pursuit.  Some one went to report the affair to the\r\nadjutant-general, Canby, and he to General Riley.  I waited some\r\ntime, and, as the thing grew cold, I thought it was given up, and\r\nwent to my room and to bed.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight I was called up and informed that there were seven\r\nofficers willing to go, but the difficulty was to get horses and\r\nsaddles.  I went down to Larkin's house and got General Smith to\r\nconsent that we might take the horses I had bought for our trip.\r\nIt was nearly three o'clock A.M. before we were all mounted and\r\nready.  I had a musket which I used for hunting.  With this I led\r\noff at a canter, followed by the others.  About six miles out, by\r\nthe faint moon, I saw ahead of us in the sandy road some blue\r\ncoats, and, fearing lest they might resist or escape into the dense\r\nbushes which lined the road, I halted and found with me Paymaster\r\nHill, Captain N. H. Davis, and Lieutenant John Hamilton.  We waited\r\nsome time for the others, viz., Canby, Murray, Gibbs, and Sully, to\r\ncome up, but as they were not in sight we made a dash up the road\r\nand captured six of the deserters, who were Germans, with heavy\r\nknapsacks on, trudging along the deep, sandy road.  They had not\r\nexpected pursuit, had not heard our horses, and were accordingly\r\neasily taken.  Finding myself the senior officer present, I ordered\r\nLieutenant Hamilton to search the men and then to march them back\r\nto Monterey, suspecting, as was the fact, that the rest of our\r\nparty had taken a road that branched off a couple of miles back.\r\nDaylight broke as we reached the Saunas River, twelve miles out,\r\nand there the trail was broad and fresh leading directly out on the\r\nSaunas Plain.  This plain is about five miles wide, and then the\r\nground becomes somewhat broken.  The trail continued very plain,\r\nand I rode on at a gallop to where there was an old adobe-ranch on\r\nthe left of the road, with the head of a lagoon, or pond, close by.\r\nI saw one or two of the soldiers getting water at the pond, and\r\nothers up near the house.  I had the best horse and was\r\nconsiderably ahead, but on looking back could see Hill and Davis\r\ncoming up behind at a gallop.  I motioned to them to hurry forward,\r\nand turned my horse across the head of the pond, knowing the ground\r\nwell, as it was a favorite place for shooting geese and ducks.\r\nApproaching the house, I ordered the men who were outside to go in.\r\nThey did not know me personally, and exchanged glances, but I had\r\nmy musket cocked, and, as the two had seen Davis and Hill coming up\r\npretty fast, they obeyed.  Dismounting, I found the house full of\r\ndeserters, and there was no escape for them.  They naturally\r\nsupposed that I had a strong party with me, and when I ordered them\r\nto \"fall in\" they obeyed from habit.  By the time Hill and Davis\r\ncame up I had them formed in two ranks, the front rank facing\r\nabout, and I was taking away their bayonets, pistols, etc.  We\r\ndisarmed them, destroying a musket and several pistols, and, on\r\ncounting them, we found that we three had taken eighteen, which,\r\nadded to the six first captured, made twenty-four.  We made them\r\nsling their knapsacks and begin their homeward march.  It was near\r\nnight when we got back, so that these deserters had traveled nearly\r\nforty miles since \"tattoo\" of the night before.  The other party\r\nhad captured three, so that only one man had escaped.  I doubt not\r\nthis prevented the desertion of the bulk of the Second Infantry\r\nthat spring, for at that time so demoralizing was the effect of the\r\ngold-mines that everybody not in the military service justified\r\ndesertion, because a soldier, if free, could earn more money in a\r\nday than he received per month.  Not only did soldiers and sailors\r\ndesert, but captains and masters of ships actually abandoned their\r\nvessels and cargoes to try their luck at the mines.  Preachers\r\nand professors forgot their creeds and took to trade, and\r\neven to keeping gambling-houses.  I remember that one of our\r\nregular soldiers, named Reese, in deserting stole a favorite\r\ndouble-barreled gun of mine, and when the orderly-sergeant of the\r\ncompany, Carson, was going on furlough, I asked him when he came\r\nacross Reese to try and get my gun back.  When he returned he told\r\nme that he had found Reese and offered him a hundred dollars for my\r\ngun, but Reese sent me word that he liked the gun, and would not\r\ntake a hundred dollars for it.  Soldiers or sailors who could reach\r\nthe mines were universally shielded by the miners, so that it was\r\nnext to useless to attempt their recapture.  In due season General\r\nPersifer Smith, Gibbs, and I, with some hired packers, started back\r\nfor San Francisco, and soon after we transferred our headquarters to\r\nSonoma.  About this time Major Joseph Hooker arrived from the East\r\n--the regular adjutant-general of the division--relieved me, and I\r\nbecame thereafter one of General Smith's regular aides-de-camp.\r\n\r\nAs there was very little to do, General Smith encouraged us to go\r\ninto any business that would enable us to make money.  R. P.\r\nHammond, James Blair, and I, made a contract to survey for Colonel\r\nJ. D. Stevenson his newly-projected city of \"New York of the\r\nPacific,\" situated at the month of the San Joaquin River.  The\r\ncontract embraced, also, the making of soundings and the marking\r\nout of a channel through Suisun Bay.  We hired, in San Francisco, a\r\nsmall metallic boat, with a sail, laid in some stores, and\r\nproceeded to the United States ship Ohio, anchored at Saucelito,\r\nwhere we borrowed a sailor-boy and lead-lines with which to sound\r\nthe channel.  We sailed up to Benicia, and, at General Smith's\r\nrequest, we surveyed and marked the line dividing the city of\r\nBenicia from the government reserve.  We then sounded the bay back\r\nand forth, and staked out the best channel up Suisun Bay, from\r\nwhich Blair made out sailing directions.  We then made the\r\npreliminary surveys of the city of \"New York of the Pacific,\" all\r\nof which were duly plotted; and for this work we each received from\r\nStevenson five hundred dollars and ten or fifteen lots.  I sold\r\nenough lots to make up another five hundred dollars, and let the\r\nbalance go; for the city of \"New York of the Pacific\" never came to\r\nany thing.  Indeed, cities at the time were being projected by\r\nspeculators all round the bay and all over the country.\r\n\r\nWhile we were surveying at \"New York of the Pacific,\" occurred one\r\nof those little events that showed the force of the gold-fever.  We\r\nhad a sailor-boy with us, about seventeen years old, who cooked our\r\nmeals and helped work the boat.  Onshore, we had the sail spread so\r\nas to shelter us against the wind and dew.  One morning I awoke\r\nabout daylight, and looked out to see if our sailor-boy was at work\r\ngetting breakfast; but he was not at the fire at all.  Getting up,\r\nI discovered that he had converted a tule-bolsa into a sail boat,\r\nand was sailing for the gold-mines.  He was astride this bolsa,\r\nwith a small parcel of bread and meat done up in a piece of\r\ncloth; another piece of cloth, such as we used for making our\r\nsignal-stations, he had fixed into a sail; and with a paddle he was\r\ndirecting his precarious craft right out into the broad bay, to\r\nfollow the general direction of the schooners and boats that he\r\nknew were ascending the Sacramento River.  He was about a hundred\r\nyards from the shore.  I jerked up my gun, and hailed him to come\r\nback.  After a moment's hesitation, he let go his sheet and began\r\nto paddle back.  This bolsa was nothing but a bundle of tule, or\r\nbullrush, bound together with grass-ropes in the shape of a cigar,\r\nabout ten feet long and about two feet through the butt.  With\r\nthese the California Indiana cross streams of considerable size.\r\nWhen he came ashore, I gave him a good overhauling for attempting\r\nto desert, and put him to work getting breakfast.  In due time we\r\nreturned him to his ship, the Ohio.  Subsequently, I made a bargain\r\nwith Mr. Hartnell to survey his ranch at Cosnmnes River, Sacramento\r\nValley.  Ord and a young citizen, named Seton, were associated with\r\nme in this.  I bought of Rodman M. Price a surveyor's compass,\r\nchain, etc., and, in San Francisco, a small wagon and harness.\r\nAvailing ourselves of a schooner, chartered to carry Major Miller\r\nand two companies of the Second Infantry from San Francisco to\r\nStockton, we got up to our destination at little cost.  I recall an\r\noccurrence that happened when the schooner was anchored in\r\nCarquinez Straits, opposite the soldiers' camp on shore.  We were\r\nwaiting for daylight and a fair wind; the schooner lay anchored at\r\nan ebb-tide, and about daylight Ord and I had gone ashore for\r\nsomething.  Just as we were pulling off from shore, we heard the\r\nloud shouts of the men, and saw them all running down toward the\r\nwater.  Our attention thus drawn, we saw something swimming in the\r\nwater, and pulled toward it, thinking it a coyote; but we soon\r\nrecognized a large grizzly bear, swimming directly across the\r\nchannel.  Not having any weapon, we hurriedly pulled for the\r\nschooner, calling out, as we neared it, \"A bear! a bear!\" It so\r\nhappened that Major Miller was on deck, washing his face and hands.\r\nHe ran rapidly to the bow of the vessel, took the musket from the\r\nhands of the sentinel, and fired at the bear, as he passed but a\r\nshort distance ahead of the schooner.  The bear rose, made a growl\r\nor howl, but continued his course.  As we scrambled up the\r\nport-aide to get our guns, the mate, with a crew, happened to have\r\na boat on the starboard-aide, and, armed only with a hatchet, they\r\npulled up alongside the bear, and the mate struck him in the head\r\nwith the hatchet.  The bear turned, tried to get into the boat, but\r\nthe mate struck his claws with repeated blows, and made him let go.\r\nAfter several passes with him, the mate actually killed the bear,\r\ngot a rope round him, and towed him alongside the schooner, where\r\nhe was hoisted on deck.  The carcass weighed over six hundred\r\npounds.  It was found that Major Miller's shot had struck the bear\r\nin the lower jaw, and thus disabled him.  Had it not been for this,\r\nthe bear would certainly have upset the boat and drowned all in it.\r\nAs it was, however, his meat served us a good turn in our trip up\r\nto Stockton.  At Stockton we disembarked our wagon, provisions, and\r\ninstruments.  There I bought two fine mules at three hundred\r\ndollars each, and we hitched up and started for the Coaumnes River.\r\nAbout twelve miles off was the Mokelumne, a wide, bold stream, with\r\na canoe as a ferry-boat.  We took our wagon to pieces, and ferried\r\nit and its contents across, and then drove our mules into the\r\nwater.  In crossing, one mule became entangled in the rope of the\r\nother, and for a time we thought he was a gone mule; but at last he\r\nrevived and we hitched up.  The mules were both pack-animals;\r\nneither had ever before seen a wagon.  Young Seton also was about\r\nas green, and had never handled a mule.  We put on the harness, and\r\nbegan to hitch them in, when one of the mules turned his head, saw\r\nthe wagon, and started.  We held on tight, but the beast did not\r\nstop until he had shivered the tongue-pole into a dozen fragments.\r\nThe fact was, that Seton had hitched the traces before he had put\r\non the blind-bridle.  There was considerable swearing done, but\r\nthat would not mend the pole.  There was no place nearer than\r\nSutter's Fort to repair damages, so we were put to our wits' end.\r\nWe first sent back a mile or so, and bought a raw-hide.  Gathering\r\nup the fragments of the pole and cutting the hide into strips, we\r\nfinished it in the rudest manner.  As long as the hide was green, the\r\npole was very shaky; but gradually the sun dried the hide,\r\ntightened it, and the pole actually held for about a month.  This\r\ncost us nearly a day of delay; but, when damages were repaired, we\r\nharnessed up again, and reached the crossing of the Cosumnes, where\r\nour survey was to begin.  The expediente, or title-papers, of the\r\nranch described it as containing nine or eleven leagues on the\r\nCosumnes, south side, and between the San Joaquin River and Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains.  We began at the place where the road crosses the\r\nCosumnes, and laid down a line four miles south, perpendicular to\r\nthe general direction of the stream; then, surveying up the stream,\r\nwe marked each mile so as to admit of a subdivision of one mile by\r\nfour.  The land was dry and very poor, with the exception of here\r\nand there some small pieces of bottom land, the great bulk of the\r\nbottom-land occurring on the north side of the stream.  We\r\ncontinued the survey up some twenty miles into the hills above the\r\nmill of Dailor and Sheldon.  It took about a month to make this\r\nsurvey, which, when finished, was duly plotted; and for it we\r\nreceived one-tenth of the land, or two subdivisions.  Ord and I\r\ntook the land, and we paid Seton for his labor in cash.  By the\r\nsale of my share of the land, subsequently, I realized three\r\nthousand dollars.  After finishing Hartnell's survey, we crossed\r\nover to Dailor's, and did some work for him at five hundred dollars\r\na day for the party.  Having finished our work on the Cosumnes, we\r\nproceeded to Sacramento, where Captain Sutter employed us to\r\nconnect the survey of Sacramento City, made by Lieutenant Warner,\r\nand that of Sutterville, three miles below, which was then being\r\nsurveyed by Lieutenant J. W. Davidson, of the First Dragoons.  At\r\nSutterville, the plateau of the Sacramento approached quite near\r\nthe river, and it would have made a better site for a town than the\r\nlow, submerged land where the city now stands; but it seems to be a\r\nlaw of growth that all natural advantages are disregarded wherever\r\nonce business chooses a location.  Old Sutter's embarcadero became\r\nSacramento City, simply because it was the first point used for\r\nunloading boats for Sutter's Fort, just as the site for San\r\nFrancisco was fixed by the use of Yerba Buena as the hide-landing\r\nfor the Mission of  \"San Francisco de Asis.\"\r\n\r\nI invested my earnings in this survey in three lots in Sacramento\r\nCity, on which I made a fair profit by a sale to one McNulty, of\r\nMansfield, Ohio.  I only had a two months' leave of absence, during\r\nwhich General Smith, his staff, and a retinue of civil friends,\r\nwere making a tour of the gold-mines, and hearing that he was en\r\nroute back to his headquarters at Sonoma, I knocked off my work,\r\nsold my instruments, and left my wagon and mules with my cousin\r\nCharley Hoyt, who had a store in Sacramento, and was on the point\r\nof moving up to a ranch, for which he had bargained, on Bear Creek,\r\non which was afterward established Camp \"Far West.\"  He afterward\r\nsold the mules, wagon, etc., for me, and on the whole I think I\r\ncleared, by those two months' work, about six thousand dollars.  I\r\nthen returned to headquarters at Sonoma, in time to attend my\r\nfellow aide-de-camp Gibbs through a long and dangerous sickness,\r\nduring which he was on board a store-ship, guarded by Captain\r\nGeorge Johnson, who now resides in San Francisco.  General Smith\r\nhad agreed that on the first good opportunity he would send me to\r\nthe United States as a bearer of dispatches, but this he could not\r\ndo until he had made the examination of Oregon, which was also in\r\nhis command.  During the summer of 1849 there continued to pour\r\ninto California a perfect stream of people.  Steamers came, and a\r\nline was established from San Francisco to Sacramento, of which the\r\nSenator was the pioneer, charging sixteen dollars a passage, and\r\nactually coining money.  Other boats were built, out of materials\r\nwhich had either come around Cape Horn or were brought from the\r\nSandwich Islands.  Wharves were built, houses were springing up\r\nas if by magic, and the Bay of San Francisco presented as busy a\r\nscene of life as any part of the world.  Major Allen, of the\r\nQuartermaster's Department, who had come out as chief-quartermaster\r\nof the division, was building a large warehouse at Benicia, with a\r\nrow of quarters, out of lumber at one hundred dollars per thousand\r\nfeet, and the work was done by men at sixteen dollars a day.  I\r\nhave seen a detailed soldier, who got only his monthly pay of eight\r\ndollars a month, and twenty cents a day for extra duty, nailing on\r\nweather-boards and shingles, alongside a citizen who was paid\r\nsixteen dollars a day.  This was a real injustice, made the\r\nsoldiers discontented, and it was hardly to be wondered at that so\r\nmany deserted.\r\n\r\nWhile the mass of people were busy at gold and in mammoth\r\nspeculations, a set of busy politicians were at work to secure the\r\nprizes of civil government.  Gwin and Fremont were there, and T.\r\nButler King, of Georgia, had come out from the East, scheming for\r\noffice.  He staid with us at Sonoma, and was generally regarded as\r\nthe Government candidate for United States Senator.  General Riley\r\nas Governor, and Captain Halleck as Secretary of State, had issued\r\na proclamation for the election of a convention to frame a State\r\nconstitution.  In due time the elections were held, and the\r\nconvention was assembled at Monterey.  Dr. Semple was elected\r\npresident; and Gwin, Sutter, Halleck, Butler King, Sherwood,\r\nGilbert, Shannon, and others, were members.  General Smith took no\r\npart in this convention, but sent me down to watch the proceedings,\r\nand report to him.  The only subject of interest was the slavery\r\nquestion.  There were no slaves then in California, save a few who\r\nhad come out as servants, but the Southern people at that time\r\nclaimed their share of territory, out of that acquired by the\r\ncommon labors of all sections of the Union in the war with Mexico.\r\nStill, in California there was little feeling on the subject.  I\r\nnever heard General Smith, who was a Louisianian, express any\r\nopinion about it.  Nor did Butler King, of Georgia, ever manifest\r\nany particular interest in the matter.  A committee was named to\r\ndraft a constitution, which in due time was reported, with the\r\nusual clause, then known as the Wilmot Proviso, excluding slavery;\r\nand during the debate which ensued very little opposition was made\r\nto this clause, which was finally adopted by a large majority,\r\nalthough the convention was made up in large part of men from our\r\nSouthern States.  This matter of California being a free State,\r\nafterward, in the national Congress, gave rise to angry debates,\r\nwhich at one time threatened civil war.  The result of the\r\nconvention was the election of State officers, and of the\r\nLegislature which sat in San Jose in October and November, 1849,\r\nand which elected Fremont and Gwin as the first United States\r\nSenators in Congress from the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nShortly after returning from Monterey, I was sent by General Smith\r\nup to Sacramento City to instruct Lieutenants Warner and\r\nWilliamson, of the Engineers, to push their surveys of the Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains, for the purpose of ascertaining the possibility\r\nof passing that range by a railroad, a subject that then elicited\r\nuniversal interest.  It was generally assumed that such a road\r\ncould not be made along any of the immigrant roads then in use, and\r\nWarner's orders were to look farther north up the Feather River, or\r\nsome one of its tributaries.  Warner was engaged in this survey\r\nduring the summer and fall of 1849, and had explored, to the very\r\nend of Goose Lake, the source of Feather River.  Then, leaving\r\nWilliamson with the baggage and part of the men, he took about ten\r\nmen and a first-rate guide, crossed the summit to the east, and had\r\nturned south, having the range of mountains on his right hand, with\r\nthe intention of regaining his camp by another pass in the\r\nmountain.  The party was strung out, single file, with wide spaces\r\nbetween, Warner ahead.  He had just crossed a small valley and\r\nascended one of the spurs covered with sage-brush and rocks, when a\r\nband of Indians rose up and poured in a shower of arrows.  The mule\r\nturned and ran back to the valley, where Warner fell off dead,\r\npunctured by five arrows.  The mule also died.  The guide, who was\r\nnear to Warner, was mortally wounded; and one or two men had arrows\r\nin their bodies, but recovered.  The party gathered about Warner's\r\nbody, in sight of the Indians, who whooped and yelled, but did not\r\nventure away from their cover of rocks.  This party of men remained\r\nthere all day without burying the bodies, and at night, by a wide\r\ncircuit, passed the mountain, and reached Williamson's camp.  The\r\nnews of Warner's death cast a gloom over all the old Californians,\r\nwho knew him well.  He was a careful, prudent, and honest officer,\r\nwell qualified for his business, and extremely accurate in all his\r\nwork.  He and I had been intimately associated during our four\r\nyears together in California, and I felt his loss deeply.  The\r\nseason was then too far advanced to attempt to avenge his death,\r\nand it was not until the next spring that a party was sent out to\r\ngather up and bury his scattered bones.\r\n\r\nAs winter approached, the immigrants overland came pouring into\r\nCalifornia, dusty and worn with their two thousand miles of weary\r\ntravel across the plains and mountains.  Those who arrived in\r\nOctober and November reported thousands still behind them, with\r\noxen perishing, and short of food.  Appeals were made for help, and\r\nGeneral Smith resolved to attempt relief.  Major Rucker, who had\r\ncome across with Pike.  Graham's Battalion of Dragoons, had\r\nexchanged with Major Fitzgerald, of the Quartermaster's Department,\r\nand was detailed to conduct this relief.  General Smith ordered him\r\nto be supplied with one hundred thousand dollars out of the civil\r\nfund, subject to his control, and with this to purchase at\r\nSacramento flour, bacon, etc., and to hire men and mules to send\r\nout and meet the immigrants.  Major Rucker fulfilled this duty\r\nperfectly, sending out pack-trains loaded with food by the many\r\nroutes by which the immigrants were known to be approaching, went\r\nout himself with one of these trains, and remained in the mountains\r\nuntil the last immigrant had got in.  No doubt this expedition\r\nsaved many a life which has since been most useful to the country.\r\nI remained at Sacramento a good part of the fall of 1849,\r\nrecognizing among the immigrants many of my old personal\r\nfriends--John C. Fall, William King, Sam Stambaugh, Hugh Ewing,\r\nHampton Denman, etc.  I got Rucker to give these last two employment\r\nalong with the train for the relief of the immigrants.  They had\r\nproposed to begin a ranch on my land on the Cosumnes, but afterward\r\nchanged their minds, and went out with Rucker.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Sacramento General Smith had gone on his\r\ncontemplated trip to Oregon, and promised that he would be back in\r\nDecember, when he would send me home with dispatches.  Accordingly,\r\nas the winter and rainy season was at hand, I went to San\r\nFrancisco, and spent some time at the Presidio, waiting patiently\r\nfor General Smith's return.  About Christmas a vessel arrived from\r\nOregon with the dispatches, and an order for me to deliver them in\r\nperson to General Winfield Scott, in New York City.  General Smith\r\nhad sent them down, remaining in Oregon for a time.  Of course I\r\nwas all ready, and others of our set were going home by the same\r\nconveyance, viz., Rucker, Ord, A. J. Smith--some under orders, and\r\nthe others on leave.  Wanting to see my old friends in Monterey, I\r\narranged for my passage in the steamer of January 1, 1850, paying\r\nsix hundred dollars for passage to New York, and went down to\r\nMonterey by land, Rucker accompanying me.  The weather was\r\nunusually rainy, and all the plain about Santa Clara was under\r\nwater; but we reached Monterey in time.  I again was welcomed by my\r\nfriends, Dona Augustias, Manuelita, and the family, and it was\r\nresolved that I should take two of the boys home with me and put\r\nthem at Georgetown College for education, viz., Antonio and\r\nPorfirio, thirteen and eleven years old.  The dona gave me a bag of\r\ngold-dust to pay for their passage and to deposit at the college.\r\nOn the 2d day of January punctually appeared the steamer Oregon.\r\n\r\nWe were all soon on board and off for home.  At that time the\r\nsteamers touched at San Diego, Acapulco, and Panama.  Our\r\npassage down the coast was unusually pleasant.  Arrived at\r\nPanama, we hired mules and rode across to Gorgona, on the\r\nCruces River, where we hired a boat and paddled down to the\r\nmouth of the river, off which lay the steamer Crescent City.  It\r\nusually took four days to cross the isthmus, every passenger taking\r\ncare of himself, and it was really funny to watch the efforts of\r\nwomen and men unaccustomed to mules.  It was an old song to us, and\r\nthe trip across was easy and interesting.  In due time we were rowed\r\noff to the Crescent City, rolling back and forth in the swell, and\r\nwe scrambled aboard by a \"Jacob's ladder\" from the stern.  Some of\r\nthe women had to be hoisted aboard by lowering a tub from the end\r\nof a boom; fun to us who looked on, but awkward enough to the poor\r\nwomen, especially to a very fat one, who attracted much notice.\r\nGeneral Fremont, wife and child (Lillie) were passengers with us\r\ndown from San Francisco; but Mrs. Fremont not being well, they\r\nremained over one trip at Panama.\r\n\r\nSenator Gwin was one of our passengers, and went through to New\r\nYork.  We reached New York about the close of January, after a safe\r\nand pleasant trip.  Our party, composed of Ord, A. J. Smith, and\r\nRucker, with the two boys, Antonio and Porfirio, put up at\r\nDelmonico's, on Bowling Green; and, as soon as we had cleaned up\r\nsomewhat, I took a carriage, went to General Scott's office in\r\nNinth Street, delivered my dispatches, was ordered to dine with him\r\nnext day, and then went forth to hunt up my old friends and\r\nrelations, the Scotts, Hoyts, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nOn reaching New York, most of us had rough soldier's clothing, but\r\nwe soon got a new outfit, and I dined with General Scott's family,\r\nMrs. Scott being present, and also their son-in-law and daughter\r\n(Colonel and Mrs. H. L. Scott).  The general questioned me pretty\r\nclosely in regard to things on the Pacific coast, especially the\r\npolitics, and startled me with the assertion that \"our country was\r\non the eve of a terrible civil war.\"  He interested me by anecdotes\r\nof my old army comrades in his recent battles around the city of\r\nMexico, and I felt deeply the fact that our country had passed\r\nthrough a foreign war, that my comrades had fought great battles,\r\nand yet I had not heard a hostile shot.  Of course, I thought it\r\nthe last and only chance in my day, and that my career as a soldier\r\nwas at an end.  After some four or five days spent in New York, I\r\nwas, by an order of General Scott, sent to Washington, to lay\r\nbefore the Secretary of War (Crawford, of Georgia) the dispatches\r\nwhich I had brought from California.  On reaching Washington, I\r\nfound that Mr. Ewing was Secretary of the Interior, and I at once\r\nbecame a member of his family.  The family occupied the house of\r\nMr. Blair, on Pennsylvania Avenue, directly in front of the War\r\nDepartment.  I immediately repaired to the War Department, and\r\nplaced my dispatches in the hands of Mr. Crawford, who questioned\r\nme somewhat about California, but seemed little interested in the\r\nsubject, except so far as it related to slavery and the routes\r\nthrough Texas.  I then went to call on the President at the White\r\nHouse.  I found Major Bliss, who had been my teacher in mathematics\r\nat West Point, and was then General Taylor's son-in-law and private\r\nsecretary.  He took me into the room, now used by the President's\r\nprivate secretaries, where President Taylor was.  I had never seen\r\nhim before, though I had served under him in Florida in 1840-'41,\r\nand was most agreeably surprised at his fine personal appearance,\r\nand his pleasant, easy manners.  He received me with great\r\nkindness, told me that Colonel Mason had mentioned my name with\r\npraise, and that he would be pleased to do me any act of favor.  We\r\nwere with him nearly an hour, talking about California generally,\r\nand of his personal friends, Persifer Smith, Riley, Canby, and\r\nothers: Although General Scott was generally regarded by the army\r\nas the most accomplished soldier of the Mexican War, yet General\r\nTaylor had that blunt, honest, and stern character, that endeared\r\nhim to the masses of the people, and made him President.  Bliss,\r\ntoo, had gained a large fame by his marked skill and intelligence\r\nas an adjutant-general and military adviser.  His manner was very\r\nunmilitary, and in his talk he stammered and hesitated, so as to\r\nmake an unfavorable impression on a stranger; but he was\r\nwonderfully accurate and skillful with his pen, and his orders and\r\nletters form a model of military precision and clearness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMISSOURI, LOUISIANA, AND CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n1850-1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving  returned from California in January, 1850, with dispatches\r\nfor the War Department, and having delivered them in person first\r\nto General Scott in New York City, and afterward to the Secretary\r\nof War (Crawford) in Washington City, I applied for and received a\r\nleave of absence for six months.  I first visited my mother, then\r\nliving at Mansfield, Ohio, and returned to Washington, where, on\r\nthe 1st day of May, 1850, I was married to Miss Ellen Boyle Ewing,\r\ndaughter of the Hon. Thomas Ewing, Secretary of the Interior.  The\r\nmarriage ceremony was attended by a large and distinguished\r\ncompany, embracing Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, T. H. Benton,\r\nPresident Taylor, and all his cabinet.  This occurred at the house\r\nof Mr. Ewing, the same now owned and occupied by Mr. F. P. Blair,\r\nsenior, on Pennsylvania Avenue, opposite the War Department.  We\r\nmade a wedding tour to Baltimore, New York, Niagara, and Ohio, and\r\nreturned to Washington by the 1st of July.  General Taylor\r\nparticipated in the celebration of the Fourth of July, a very hot\r\nday, by hearing a long speech from the Hon. Henry S. Foote, at the\r\nbase of the Washington Monument.  Returning from the celebration\r\nmuch heated and fatigued, he partook too freely of his favorite\r\niced milk with cherries, and during that night was seized with a\r\nsevere colic, which by morning had quite prostrated him.  It was\r\nsaid that he sent for his son-in-law, Surgeon Wood, United States\r\nArmy, stationed in Baltimore, and declined medical assistance from\r\nanybody else.  Mr. Ewing visited him several times, and was\r\nmanifestly uneasy and anxious, as was also his son-in-law, Major\r\nBliss, then of the army, and his confidential secretary.  He\r\nrapidly grew worse, and died in about four days.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time there was a high state of political feeling pervading\r\nthe country, on account of the questions growing out of the new\r\nTerritories just acquired from Mexico by the war.  Congress was in\r\nsession, and General Taylor's sudden death evidently created great\r\nalarm.  I was present in the Senate-gallery, and saw the oath of\r\noffice administered to the Vice-President, Mr. Fillmore, a man of\r\nsplendid physical proportions and commanding appearance; but on the\r\nfaces of Senators  and people could easily be read the feelings of\r\ndoubt and uncertainty that prevailed.  All knew that a change in\r\nthe cabinet and general policy was likely to result, but at the\r\ntime it was supposed that Mr. Fillmore, whose home was in Buffalo,\r\nwould be less liberal than General Taylor to the politicians of the\r\nSouth, who feared, or pretended to fear, a crusade against slavery;\r\nor, as was the political cry of the day, that slavery would be\r\nprohibited in the Territories and in the places exclusively under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States.  Events, however, proved the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nI attended General Taylor's funeral as a sort of aide-decamp, at\r\nthe request of the Adjutant-General of the army, Roger Jones, whose\r\nbrother, a militia-general, commanded the escort, composed of\r\nmilitia and some regulars.  Among the regulars I recall the names\r\nof Captains John Sedgwick and W. F. Barry.\r\n\r\nHardly was General Taylor decently buried in the Congressional\r\nCemetery when the political struggle recommenced, and it became\r\nmanifest that Mr. Fillmore favored the general compromise then\r\nknown as Henry Clay's \"Omnibus Bill,\" and that a general change of\r\ncabinet would at once occur: Webster was to succeed Mr. Clayton as\r\nSecretary of State, Corwin to succeed Mr. Meredith as Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, and A. H. H. Stuart to succeed Mr. Ewing as Secretary\r\nof the Interior.  Mr. Ewing, however, was immediately appointed by\r\nthe Governor of the State to succeed Corwin in the Senate.\r\nThese changes made it necessary for Mr. Ewing to discontinue\r\nhouse-keeping, and Mr. Corwin took his home and furniture off his\r\nhands. I escorted the family out to their home in Lancaster, Ohio;\r\nbut, before this had occurred, some most interesting debates took\r\nplace in the Senate, which I regularly attended, and heard Clay,\r\nBenton, Foots, King of Alabama, Dayton, and the many real orators of\r\nthat day.  Mr. Calhoun was in his seat, but he was evidently\r\napproaching his end, for he was pale and feeble in the extreme.  I\r\nheard Mr. Webster's last speech on the floor of the Senate, under\r\ncircumstances that warrant a description.  It was publicly known\r\nthat he was to leave the Senate, and enter the new cabinet of Mr.\r\nFillmore, as his Secretary of State, and that prior to leaving he\r\nwas to make a great speech on the \"Omnibus Bill.\"  Resolved to hear\r\nit, I went up to the Capitol on the day named, an hour or so\r\nearlier than usual.  The speech was to be delivered in the old\r\nSenate-chamber, now used by the Supreme Court.  The galleries were\r\nmuch smaller than at present, and I found them full to overflowing,\r\nwith a dense crowd about the door, struggling to reach the stairs. I\r\ncould not get near, and then tried the reporters' gallery, but found\r\nit equally crowded; so I feared I should lose the only possible\r\nopportunity to hear Mr. Webster.\r\n\r\nI had only a limited personal acquaintance with any of the\r\nSenators, but had met Mr. Corwin quite often at Mr. Ewing's house,\r\nand I also knew that he had been extremely friendly to my father in\r\nhis lifetime; so I ventured to send in to him my card, \"W. T. S.,\r\nFirst-Lieutenant, Third Artillery.\"  He came to the door promptly,\r\nwhen I said, \"Mr. Corwin, I believe Mr. Webster is to speak\r\nto-day.\"  His answer was, \"Yes, he has the floor at one o'clock.\"\r\nI then added that I was extremely anxious to hear him.  \"Well,\"\r\nsaid he, \"why don't you go into the gallery?\"  I explained that it\r\nwas full, and I had tried every access, but found all jammed with\r\npeople.  \"Well,\" said he, \"what do you want of me?\"  I explained\r\nthat I would like him to take me on the floor of the Senate; that I\r\nhad often seen from the gallery persons on the floor, no better\r\nentitled to it than I.  He then asked in his quizzical way, \"Are\r\nyou a foreign embassador?\"  \"No.\"  \"Are you the Governor of a\r\nState?\"  \"No.\"  \"Are you a member of the other House?\"  \"Certainly\r\nnot\"  \"Have you ever had a vote of thanks by name?\"  \"No!\"  \"Well,\r\nthese are the only privileged members.\"  I then told him he knew\r\nwell enough who I was, and that if he chose he could take me in.\r\nHe then said, \"Have you any impudence?\"  I told him,  \"A reasonable\r\namount if occasion called for it.\"  \"Do you think you could become\r\nso interested in my conversation as not to notice the door-keeper?\"\r\n(pointing to him).  I told him that there was not the least doubt\r\nof it, if he would tell me one of his funny stories.  He then took\r\nmy arm, and led me a turn in the vestibule, talking about some\r\nindifferent matter, but all the time directing my looks to his left\r\nhand, toward which he was gesticulating with his right; and thus we\r\napproached the door-keeper, who began asking me, \"Foreign\r\nambassador?  Governor of a State?  Member of Congress?\" etc.; but I\r\ncaught Corwin's eye, which said plainly, \"Don't mind him, pay\r\nattention to me,\" and in this way we entered the Senate-chamber by\r\na side-door.  Once in, Corwin said, \"Now you can take care of\r\nyourself,\" and I thanked him cordially.\r\n\r\nI found a seat close behind Mr. Webster, and near General Scott,\r\nand heard the whole of the speech.  It was heavy in the extreme,\r\nand I confess that I was disappointed and tired long before it was\r\nfinished.  No doubt the speech was full of fact and argument, but\r\nit had none of the fire of oratory, or intensity of feeling, that\r\nmarked all of Mr. Clay's efforts.\r\n\r\nToward the end of July, as before stated, all the family went home\r\nto Lancaster.  Congress was still in session, and the bill adding\r\nfour captains to the Commissary Department had not passed, but was\r\nreasonably certain to, and I was equally sure of being one of them.\r\nAt that time my name was on the muster-roll of (Light) Company C,\r\nThird Artillery (Bragg's), stationed at Jefferson Barracks, near\r\nSt. Louis.  But, as there was cholera at St. Louis, on application,\r\nI was permitted to delay joining my company until September.  Early\r\nin that month, I proceeded to Cincinnati, and thence by steamboat\r\nto St. Louis, and then to Jefferson Barracks, where I reported\r\nfor duty to Captain and Brevet-Colonel Braxton Bragg, commanding\r\n(Light) Company C, Third Artillery.  The other officers of the\r\ncompany were First-Lieutenant James A. Hardie, and afterward\r\nHaekaliah Brown.  New horses had just been purchased for the\r\nbattery, and we were preparing for work, when the mail brought the\r\norders announcing the passage of the bill increasing the Commissary\r\nDepartment by four captains, to which were promoted Captains\r\nShiras, Blair, Sherman, and Bowen.  I was ordered to take post at\r\nSt. Louis, and to relieve Captain A. J. Smith, First Dragoons, who\r\nhad been acting in that capacity for some months.  My commission\r\nbore date September 27,1850.  I proceeded forthwith to the city,\r\nrelieved Captain Smith, and entered on the discharge of the duties\r\nof the office.\r\n\r\nColonel N. S. Clarke, Sixth Infantry, commanded the department;\r\nMajor D. C. Buell was adjutant-general, and Captain W. S. Hancock\r\nwas regimental quartermaster; Colonel Thomas Swords was the depot\r\nquartermaster, and we had our offices in the same building, on the\r\ncorner of Washington Avenue and Second.  Subsequently Major S. Van\r\nVliet relieved Colonel Swords.  I remained at the Planters' House\r\nuntil my family arrived, when we occupied a house on Chouteau\r\nAvenue, near Twelfth.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1851, Mr. Ewing and Mr. Henry\r\nStoddard, of Dayton, Ohio, a cousin of my father, were much in St.\r\nLouis, on business connected with the estate of Major Amos\r\nStoddard, who was of the old army, as early as the beginning of\r\nthis century.  He was stationed at the village of St. Louis at the\r\ntime of the Louisiana purchase, and when Lewis and Clarke made\r\ntheir famous expedition across the continent to the Columbia River.\r\nMajor Stoddard at that early day had purchased a small farm back of\r\nthe village, of some Spaniard or Frenchman, but, as he was a\r\nbachelor, and was killed at Fort Meigs, Ohio, during the War of\r\n1812, the title was for many years lost sight of, and the farm was\r\ncovered over by other claims and by occupants.  As St. Louis began\r\nto grow, his brothers and sisters, and their descendants, concluded\r\nto look up the property.  After much and fruitless litigation, they\r\nat last retained Mr. Stoddard, of Dayton, who in turn employed Mr.\r\nEwing, and these, after many years of labor, established the title,\r\nand in the summer of 1851 they were put in possession by the United\r\nStates marshal.  The ground was laid off, the city survey extended\r\nover it, and the whole was sold in partition.  I made some\r\npurchases, and acquired an interest, which I have retained more or\r\nless ever since.\r\n\r\nWe continued to reside in St. Louis throughout the year 1851, and\r\nin the spring of 1852 I had occasion to visit Fort Leavenworth on\r\nduty, partly to inspect a lot of cattle which a Mr. Gordon, of Cass\r\nCounty, had contracted to deliver in New Mexico, to enable Colonel\r\nSumner to attempt his scheme of making the soldiers in New Mexico\r\nself-supporting, by raising their own meat, and in a measure their\r\nown vegetables.  I found Fort Leavenworth then, as now, a most\r\nbeautiful spot, but in the midst of a wild Indian country.  There\r\nwere no whites settled in what is now the State of Kansas.  Weston,\r\nin Missouri, was the great town, and speculation in town-lots there\r\nand thereabout burnt the fingers of some of the army-officers, who\r\nwanted to plant their scanty dollars in a fruitful soil.  I rode on\r\nhorseback over to Gordon's farm, saw the cattle, concluded the\r\nbargain, and returned by way of Independence, Missouri.  At\r\nIndependence I found F. X. Aubrey, a noted man of that day, who had\r\njust made a celebrated ride of six hundred miles in six days.  That\r\nspring the United States quartermaster, Major L. C. Easton, at Fort\r\nUnion, New Mexico, had occasion to send some message east by a\r\ncertain date, and contracted with Aubrey to carry it to the nearest\r\npost-office (then Independence, Missouri), making his compensation\r\nconditional on the time consumed.  He was supplied with a good\r\nhorse, and an order on the outgoing trains for an exchange.  Though\r\nthe whole route was infested with hostile Indians, and not a house\r\non it, Aubrey started alone with his rifle.  He was fortunate in\r\nmeeting several outward-bound trains, and there, by made frequent\r\nchanges of horses, some four or five, and reached Independence in\r\nsix days, having hardly rested or slept the whole way.  Of course,\r\nhe was extremely fatigued, and said there was an opinion among the\r\nwild Indians that if a man \"sleeps out his sleep,\" after such\r\nextreme exhaustion, he will never awake; and, accordingly, he\r\ninstructed his landlord to wake him up after eight hours of sleep.\r\nWhen aroused at last, he saw by the clock that he had been asleep\r\ntwenty hours, and he was dreadfully angry, threatened to murder his\r\nlandlord, who protested he had tried in every way to get him up,\r\nbut found it impossible, and had let him \"sleep it out\" Aubrey, in\r\ndescribing his sensations to me, said he took it for granted he was\r\na dead man; but in fact he sustained no ill effects, and was off\r\nagain in a few days.  I met him afterward often in California, and\r\nalways esteemed him one of the best samples of that bold race of\r\nmen who had grown up on the Plains, along with the Indians, in the\r\nservice of the fur companies.  He was afterward, in 1856, killed by\r\nR. C. Weightman, in a bar-room row, at Santa Fe, New Mexico, where\r\nhe had just arrived from California.\r\n\r\nIn going from Independence to Fort Leavenworth, I had to swim Milk\r\nCreek, and sleep all night in a Shawnee camp.  The next day I\r\ncrossed the Kaw or Kansas River in a ferry boat, maintained by the\r\nblacksmith of the tribe, and reached the fort in the evening.  At\r\nthat day the whole region was unsettled, where now exist many rich\r\ncounties, highly cultivated, embracing several cities of from ten\r\nto forty thousand inhabitants.  From Fort Leavenworth I returned by\r\nsteamboat to St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1852, my family went to Lancaster, Ohio; but I\r\nremained at my post.  Late in the season, it was rumored that I was\r\nto be transferred to New Orleans, and in due time I learned the\r\ncause.  During a part of the Mexican War, Major Seawell, of the\r\nSeventh Infantry, had been acting commissary of subsistence at New\r\nOrleans, then the great depot of supplies for the troops in Texas,\r\nand of those operating beyond the Rio Grande.  Commissaries at that\r\ntime were allowed to purchase in open market, and were not\r\nrestricted to advertising and awarding contracts to the lowest\r\nbidders.  It was reported that Major Seawell had purchased largely\r\nof the house of Perry Seawell & Co., Mr. Seawell being a relative\r\nof his.  When he was relieved in his duties by Major Waggman, of\r\nthe regular Commissary Department, the latter found Perry Seawell &\r\nCo. so prompt and satisfactory that he continued the patronage;\r\nfor which there was a good reason, because stores for the use of\r\nthe troops at remote posts had to be packed in a particular way, to\r\nbear transportation in wagons, or even on pack-mules; and this firm\r\nhad made extraordinary preparations for this exclusive purpose.\r\nSome time about 1849, a brother of Major Waggaman, who had been\r\nclerk to Captain Casey, commissary of subsistence, at Tampa Bay,\r\nFlorida, was thrown out of office by the death of the captain, and\r\nhe naturally applied to his brother in New Orleans for employment;\r\nand he, in turn, referred him to his friends, Messrs.  Perry\r\nSeawell & Co.  These first employed him as a clerk, and afterward\r\nadmitted him as a partner.  Thus it resulted, in fact, that Major\r\nWaggaman was dealing largely, if not exclusively, with a firm of\r\nwhich his brother was a partner.\r\n\r\nOne day, as General Twiggs was coming across Lake Pontchartrain, he\r\nfell in with one of his old cronies, who was an extensive grocer.\r\nThis gentleman gradually led the conversation to the downward\r\ntendency of the times since he and Twiggs were young, saying that,\r\nin former years, all the merchants of New Orleans had a chance at\r\ngovernment patronage; but now, in order to sell to the army\r\ncommissary, one had to take a brother in as a partner.  General\r\nTwiggs resented this, but the merchant again affirmed it, and gave\r\nnames.  As soon as General Twiggs reached his office, he instructed\r\nhis adjutant-general, Colonel Bliss--who told me this--to address a\r\ncategorical note of inquiry to Major Waggaman.  The major very\r\nfrankly stated the facts as they had arisen, and insisted that the\r\nfirm of Perry Seawell & Co. had enjoyed a large patronage, but\r\ndeserved it richly by reason of their promptness, fairness, and\r\nfidelity.  The correspondence was sent to Washington, and the\r\nresult was, that Major Waggaman was ordered to St. Louis, and I was\r\nordered to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nI went down to New Orleans in a steamboat in the month of\r\nSeptember, 1852, taking with me a clerk, and, on arrival, assumed\r\nthe office, in a bank-building facing Lafayette Square, in which\r\nwere the offices of all the army departments.  General D. Twiggs\r\nwas in command of the department, with Colonel W. W. S. Bliss\r\n(son-in-law of General Taylor) as his adjutant-general.  Colonel A.\r\nC. Myers was quartermaster, Captain John F. Reynolds aide-de-camp,\r\nand Colonel A. J. Coffee paymaster.  I took rooms at the St. Louis\r\nHotel, kept by a most excellent gentleman, Colonel Mudge.\r\n\r\nMr. Perry Seawell came to me in person, soliciting a continuance of\r\nthe custom which he had theretofore enjoyed; but I told him frankly\r\nthat a change was necessary, and I never saw or heard of him\r\nafterward.  I simply purchased in open market, arranged for the\r\nproper packing of the stores, and had not the least difficulty in\r\nsupplying the troops and satisfying the head of the department in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nAbout Christmas, I had notice that my family, consisting of Mrs.\r\nSherman, two children, and nurse, with my sister Fanny (now Mrs.\r\nMoulton, of Cincinnati, Ohio), were en route for New Orleans by\r\nsteam-packet; so I hired a house on Magazine Street, and furnished\r\nit.  Almost at the moment of their arrival, also came from St.\r\nLouis my personal friend Major Turner, with a parcel of documents,\r\nwhich, on examination, proved to be articles of copartnership for a\r\nbank in California under the title of \"Lucas, Turner & Co.,\" in\r\nwhich my name was embraced as a partner.  Major Turner was, at the\r\ntime, actually en route for New York, to embark for San Francisco,\r\nto inaugurate the bank, in the nature of a branch of the firm\r\nalready existing at St. Louis under the name of \"Lucas & Symonds.\"\r\nWe discussed the matter very fully, and he left with me the papers\r\nfor reflection, and went on to New York and California.\r\n\r\nShortly after arrived James H. Lucas, Esq., the principal of the\r\nbanking-firm in St. Louis, a most honorable and wealthy gentleman.\r\nHe further explained the full programme of the branch in\r\nCalifornia; that my name had been included at the insistence of\r\nMajor Turner, who was a man of family and property in St. Louis,\r\nunwilling to remain long in San Francisco, and who wanted me to\r\nsucceed him there.  He offered me a very tempting income, with an\r\ninterest that would accumulate and grow.  He also disclosed to me\r\nthat, in establishing a branch in California, he was influenced by\r\nthe apparent prosperity of Page, Bacon & Co., and further that he\r\nhad received the principal data, on which he had founded the\r\nscheme, from B. R. Nisbet, who was then a teller in the firm of\r\nPage, Bacon & Co., of San Francisco; that he also was to be taken\r\nin as a partner, and was fully competent to manage all the details\r\nof the business; but, as Nisbet was comparatively young, Mr. Lucas\r\nwanted me to reside in San Francisco permanently, as the head of\r\nthe firm.  All these matters were fully discussed, and I agreed to\r\napply for a six months' leave of absence, go to San Francisco, see\r\nfor myself, and be governed by appearances there.  I accordingly,\r\nwith General Twiggs's approval, applied to the adjutant-general for\r\na six months' leave, which was granted; and Captain John F.\r\nReynolds was named to perform my duties during my absence.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of my family in New Orleans, we enjoyed the society\r\nof the families of General Twiggs, Colonel Myers, and Colonel\r\nBliss, as also of many citizens, among whom was the wife of Mr.\r\nDay, sister to my brother-in-law, Judge Bartley.  General Twiggs\r\nwas then one of the oldest officers of the army.  His history\r\nextended back to the War of 1812, and he had served in early days\r\nwith General Jackson in Florida and in the Creek campaigns.  He had\r\nfine powers of description, and often entertained us, at his\r\noffice, with accounts of his experiences in the earlier settlements\r\nof the Southwest.  Colonel Bliss had been General Taylor's adjutant\r\nin the Mexican War, and was universally regarded as one of the most\r\nfinished and accomplished scholars in the army, and his wife was a\r\nmost agreeable and accomplished lady.\r\n\r\nLate in February, I dispatched my family up to Ohio in the\r\nsteamboat Tecumseh (Captain Pearce); disposed of my house and\r\nfurniture; turned over to Major Reynolds the funds, property, and\r\nrecords of the office; and took passage in a small steamer for\r\nNicaragua, en route for California.  We embarked early in March,\r\nand in seven days reached Greytown, where we united with the\r\npassengers from New York, and proceeded, by the Nicaragua River and\r\nLake, for the Pacific Ocean.  The river was low, and the little\r\nsteam canal-boats, four in number, grounded often, so that the\r\npassengers had to get into the water, to help them over the bare.\r\nIn all there were about six hundred passengers, of whom about sixty\r\nwere women and children.  In four days we reached Castillo, where\r\nthere is a decided fall, passed by a short railway, and above this\r\nfall we were transferred to a larger boat, which carried us up the\r\nrest of the river, and across the beautiful lake Nicaragua, studded\r\nwith volcanic islands.  Landing at Virgin Bay, we rode on mules\r\nacross to San Juan del Sur, where lay at anchor the propeller S. S.\r\nLewis (Captain Partridge, I think).  Passengers were carried\r\nthrough the surf by natives to small boats, and rowed off to the\r\nLewis.  The weather was very hot, and quite a scramble followed for\r\nstate-rooms, especially for those on deck.  I succeeded in reaching\r\nthe purser's office, got my ticket for a berth in one of the best\r\nstate-rooms on deck, and, just as I was turning from the window, a\r\nlady who was a fellow-passenger from New Orleans, a Mrs. D-, called\r\nto me to secure her and her lady friend berths on deck, saying that\r\nthose below were unendurable.  I spoke to the purser, who, at the\r\nmoment perplexed by the crowd and clamor, answered: \"I must put\r\ntheir names down for the other two berths of your state-room; but,\r\nas soon as the confusion is over, I will make some change whereby\r\nyou shall not suffer.\"  As soon as these two women were assigned to\r\na state-room, they took possession, and I was left out.  Their\r\nnames were recorded as \"Captain Sherman and ladies.\"  As soon as\r\nthings were quieted down I remonstrated with the purser, who at\r\nlast gave me a lower berth in another and larger state-room on\r\ndeck, with five others, so that my two ladies had the state-room\r\nall to themselves.  At every meal the steward would come to me, and\r\nsay, \"Captain Sherman, will you bring your ladies to the table?\"\r\nand we had the best seats in the ship.\r\n\r\nThis continued throughout the voyage, and I assert that \"my ladies\"\r\nwere of the most modest and best-behaved in the ship; but some time\r\nafter we had reached San Francisco one of our fellow-passengers\r\ncame to me and inquired if I personally knew Mrs. D---, with flaxen\r\ntresses, who sang so sweetly for us, and who had come out under my\r\nespecial escort.  I replied I did not, more than the chance\r\nacquaintance of the voyage, and what she herself had told me, viz.,\r\nthat she expected to meet her husband, who lived about Mokelumne\r\nHill.  He then informed me that she was a woman of the town.\r\nSociety in California was then decidedly mixed.  In due season the\r\nsteamship Lewis got under weigh.  She was a wooden ship, long and\r\nnarrow, bark-rigged, and a propeller; very slow, moving not over\r\neight miles an hour.  We stopped at Acapulco, and, in eighteen\r\ndays, passed in sight of Point Pinoa at Monterey, and at the speed\r\nwe were traveling expected to reach San Francisco at 4 A. M. the\r\nnext day.  The cabin passengers, as was usual, bought of the\r\nsteward some champagne and cigars, and we had a sort of ovation for\r\nthe captain, purser, and surgeon of the ship, who were all very\r\nclever fellows, though they had a slow and poor ship.  Late at\r\nnight all the passengers went to bed, expecting to enter the port\r\nat daylight.  I did not undress, as I thought the captain could and\r\nwould run in at night, and I lay down with my clothes on.  About 4\r\nA. M. I was awakened by a bump and sort of grating of the vessel,\r\nwhich I thought was our arrival at the wharf in San Francisco; but\r\ninstantly the ship struck heavily; the engines stopped, and the\r\nrunning to and fro on deck showed that something was wrong.  In a\r\nmoment I was out of my state-room, at the bulwark, holding fast to\r\na stanchion, and looking over the side at the white and seething\r\nwater caused by her sudden and violent stoppage.  The sea was\r\ncomparatively smooth, the night pitch-dark, and the fog deep and\r\nimpenetrable; the ship would rise with the swell, and come down\r\nwith a bump and quiver that was decidedly unpleasant.  Soon the\r\npassengers were out of their rooms, undressed, calling for help,\r\nand praying as though the ship were going to sink immediately.  Of\r\ncourse she could not sink, being already on the bottom, and the\r\nonly question was as to the strength of hull to stand the bumping\r\nand straining.  Great confusion for a time prevailed, but soon I\r\nrealized that the captain had taken all proper precautions to\r\nsecure his boats, of which there were six at the davits.  These are\r\nthe first things that steerage-passengers make for in case of\r\nshipwreck, and right over my head I heard the captain's voice say\r\nin a low tone, but quite decided: \"Let go that falls, or, damn you,\r\nI'll blow your head off!\"  This seemingly harsh language gave me\r\ngreat comfort at the time, and on saying so to the captain\r\nafterward, he explained that it was addressed to a passenger who\r\nattempted to lower one of the boats.  Guards, composed of the crew,\r\nwere soon posted to prevent any interference with the boats, and\r\nthe officers circulated among the passengers the report that there\r\nwas no immediate danger; that, fortunately, the sea was smooth;\r\nthat we were simply aground, and must quietly await daylight.\r\n\r\nThey advised the passengers to keep quiet, and the ladies and\r\nchildren to dress and sit at the doors of their state-rooms, there\r\nto await the advice and action of the officers of the ship, who\r\nwere perfectly cool and self-possessed.  Meantime the ship was\r\nworking over a reef-for a time I feared she would break in two;\r\nbut, as the water gradually rose inside to a level with the sea\r\noutside, the ship swung broadside to the swell, and all her keel\r\nseemed to rest on the rock or sand.  At no time did the sea break\r\nover the deck--but the water below drove all the people up to the\r\nmain-deck and to the promenade-deck, and thus we remained for about\r\nthree hours, when daylight came; but there was a fog so thick that\r\nnothing but water could be seen.  The captain caused a boat to be\r\ncarefully lowered, put in her a trustworthy officer with a\r\nboat-compass, and we saw her depart into the fog.  During her\r\nabsence the ship's bell was kept tolling.  Then the fires were all\r\nout, the ship full of water, and gradually breaking up, wriggling\r\nwith every swell like a willow basket--the sea all round us full of\r\nthe floating fragments of her sheeting, twisted and torn into a\r\nspongy condition.  In less than an hour the boat returned, saying\r\nthat the beach was quite near, not more than a mile away, and had a\r\ngood place for landing.  All the boats were then carefully lowered,\r\nand manned by crews belonging to the ship; a piece of the gangway,\r\non the leeward side, was cut away, and all the women, and a few of\r\nthe worst-scared men, were lowered into the boats, which pulled for\r\nshore.  In a comparatively short time the boats returned, took new\r\nloads, and the debarkation was afterward carried on quietly and\r\nsystematically.  No baggage was allowed to go on shore except bags\r\nor parcels carried in the hands of passengers.  At times the fog\r\nlifted so that we could see from the wreck the tops of the hills,\r\nand the outline of the shore; and I remember sitting on, the upper\r\nor hurricane deck with the captain, who had his maps and compass\r\nbefore him, and was trying to make out where the ship was.  I\r\nthought I recognized the outline of the hills below the mission of\r\nDolores, and so stated to him; but he called my attention to the\r\nfact that the general line of hills bore northwest, whereas the\r\ncoast south of San Francisco bears due north and south.  He\r\ntherefore concluded that the ship had overrun her reckoning, and\r\nwas then to the north of San Francisco.  He also explained that,\r\nthe passage up being longer than usual, viz., eighteen days, the\r\ncoal was short; that at the time the firemen were using some cut-up\r\nspars along with the slack of coal, and that this fuel had made\r\nmore than usual steam, so that the ship must have glided along\r\nfaster than reckoned.  This proved to be the actual case, for, in\r\nfact, the steamship Lewis was wrecked April 9, 1853, on \"Duckworth\r\nReef,\" Baulinas Bay, about eighteen miles above the entrance to San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nThe captain had sent ashore the purser in the first boat, with\r\norders to work his way to the city as soon as possible, to report\r\nthe loss of his vessel, and to bring back help.  I remained on the\r\nwreck till among the last of the passengers, managing to get a can\r\nof crackers and some sardines out of the submerged pantry, a thing\r\nthe rest of the passengers did not have, and then I went quietly\r\nashore in one of the boats.  The passengers were all on the beach,\r\nunder a steep bluff; had built fires to dry their clothes, but had\r\nseen no human being, and had no idea where they were.  Taking along\r\nwith me a fellow-passenger, a young chap about eighteen years old,\r\nI scrambled up the bluff, and walked back toward the hills, in\r\nhopes to get a good view of some known object.  It was then the\r\nmonth of April, and the hills were covered with the beautiful\r\ngrasses and flowers of that season of the year.  We soon found\r\nhorse paths and tracks, and following them we came upon a drove of\r\nhorses grazing at large, some of which had saddle-marks.  At about\r\ntwo miles from the beach we found a corral; and thence, following\r\none of the strongest-marked paths, in about a mile more we\r\ndescended into a valley, and, on turning a sharp point, reached a\r\nboard shanty, with a horse picketed near by.  Four men were inside\r\neating a meal.  I inquired if any of the Lewis's people had been\r\nthere; they did not seem to understand what I meant when I\r\nexplained to them that about three miles from them, and beyond the\r\nold corral, the steamer Lewis was wrecked, and her passengers were\r\non the beach.  I inquired where we were, and they answered, \"At\r\nBaulinas Creek;\" that they were employed at a saw-mill just above,\r\nand were engaged in shipping lumber to San Francisco; that a\r\nschooner loaded with lumber was then about two miles down the\r\ncreek, waiting for the tide to get out, and doubtless if we would\r\nwalk down they would take us on board.\r\n\r\nI wrote a few words back to the captain, telling him where he was,\r\nand that I would hurry to the city to send him help.  My companion\r\nand I their went on down the creek, and soon descried the schooner\r\nanchored out in the stream.  On being hailed, a small boat came in\r\nand took us on board.  The \"captain\" willingly agreed for a small\r\nsum to carry us down to San Francisco; and, as his whole crew\r\nconsisted of a small boy about twelve years old, we helped him to\r\nget up his anchor and pole the schooner down the creek and out over\r\nthe bar on a high tide.  This must have been about 2 P.M. Once over\r\nthe bar, the sails were hoisted, and we glided along rapidly with a\r\nstrong, fair, northwest wind.  The fog had lifted, so we could see\r\nthe shores plainly, and the entrance to the bay.  In a couple of\r\nhours we were entering the bay, and running \"wing-and-wing.\"\r\nOutside the wind was simply the usual strong breeze; but, as it\r\npasses through the head of the Golden Gate, it increases, and\r\nthere, too, we met a strong ebb-tide.\r\n\r\nThe schooner was loaded with lumber, much of which was on deck,\r\nlashed down to ring bolts with raw-hide thongs.  The captain was\r\nsteering, and I was reclining on the lumber, looking at the\r\nfamiliar shore, as we approached Fort Point, when I heard a sort of\r\ncry, and felt the schooner going over.  As we got into the throat\r\nof the \"Heads,\" the force of the wind, meeting a strong ebb-tide,\r\ndrove the nose of the schooner under water; she dove like a duck,\r\nwent over on her side, and began, to drift out with the tide.  I\r\nfound myself in the water, mixed up with pieces of plank and ropes;\r\nstruck out, swam round to the stern, got on the keel, and clambered\r\nup on the side.  Satisfied that she could not sink, by reason of\r\nher cargo, I was not in the least alarmed, but thought two\r\nshipwrecks in one day not a good beginning for a new, peaceful\r\ncareer.  Nobody was drowned, however; the captain and crew were\r\nbusy in securing such articles as were liable to float off, and I\r\nlooked out for some passing boat or vessel to pick us up.  We were\r\ndrifting steadily out to sea, while I was signaling to a boat about\r\nthree miles off, toward Saucelito, and saw her tack and stand\r\ntoward us.  I was busy watching this sail-boat, when I heard a\r\nYankee's voice, close behind, saying, \"This is a nice mess you've\r\ngot yourselves into,\" and looking about I saw a man in a small\r\nboat, who had seen us upset, and had rowed out to us from a\r\nschooner anchored close under the fort.  Some explanations were\r\nmade, and when the sail-boat coming from Saucelito was near enough\r\nto be spoken to, and the captain had engaged her to help his\r\nschooner, we bade him good by, and got the man in the small boat-to\r\ncarry us ashore, and land us at the foot of the bluff, just below\r\nthe fort.  Once there, I was at home, and we footed it up to the\r\nPresidio.  Of the sentinel I inquired who was in command of the\r\npost, and was answered, \"Major Merchant.\"  He was not then in, but\r\nhis adjutant, Lieutenant Gardner, was.  I sent my card to him; he\r\ncame out, and was much surprised to find me covered with sand, and\r\ndripping with water, a good specimen of a shipwrecked mariner.  A\r\nfew words of explanation sufficed; horses were provided, and we\r\nrode hastily into the city, reaching the office of the Nicaragua\r\nSteamship Company (C. K. Garrison, agent) about dark, just as the\r\npurser had arrived; by a totally different route.  It was too late\r\nto send relief that night, but by daylight next morning two\r\nsteamers were en route for and reached the place of wreck in time\r\nto relieve the passengers and bring them, and most of the baggage.\r\nI lost my carpet-bag, but saved my trunk.  The Lewis went to pieces\r\nthe night after we got off, and, had there been an average sea\r\nduring the night of our shipwreck, none of us probably would have\r\nescaped.  That evening in San Francisco I hunted up Major Turner,\r\nwhom I found boarding, in company with General E. A. Hitchcock, at\r\na Mrs. Ross's, on Clay Street, near Powell.  I took quarters with\r\nthem, and began to make my studies, with a view to a decision\r\nwhether it was best to undertake this new and untried scheme of\r\nbanking, or to return to New Orleans and hold on to what I then\r\nhad, a good army commission.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my arrival, San Francisco was an the top wave of\r\nspeculation and prosperity.  Major Turner had rented at six hundred\r\ndollars a month the office formerly used and then owned by Adams &\r\nCo., on the east side of Montgomery Street, between Sacramento and\r\nCalifornia Streets.  B. R. Nisbet was the active partner, and James\r\nReilly the teller.  Already the bank of Lucas, Turner & Co.  was\r\nestablished, and was engaged in selling bills of exchange,\r\nreceiving deposits, and loaning money at three per cent.  a month.\r\n\r\nPage, Bacon & Co., and Adams & Co., were in full blast across the\r\nstreet, in Parrott's new granite building, and other bankers were\r\ndoing seemingly a prosperous business, among them Wells, Fargo &\r\nCo.; Drexel, Sather & Church; Burgoyne & Co.; James King of Win.;\r\nSanders & Brenham; Davidson & Co.; Palmer, Cook & Co., and others.\r\nTurner and I had rooms at Mrs. Ross's, and took our meals at\r\nrestaurants down-town, mostly at a Frenchman's named Martin, on the\r\nsouthwest corner of Montgomery and California Streets.  General\r\nHitchcock, of the army, commanding the Department of California,\r\nusually messed with us; also a Captain Mason, and Lieutenant\r\nWhiting, of the Engineer Corps.  We soon secured a small share of\r\nbusiness, and became satisfied there was room for profit.\r\nEverybody seemed to be making money fast; the city was being\r\nrapidly extended and improved; people paid their three per cent. a\r\nmonth interest without fail, and without deeming it excessive.\r\nTurner, Nisbet, and I, daily discussed the prospects, and gradually\r\nsettled down to the conviction that with two hundred thousand\r\ndollars capital, and a credit of fifty thousand dollars in New\r\nYork, we could build up a business that would help the St. Louis\r\nhouse, and at the same time pay expenses in California, with a\r\nreasonable profit.  Of course, Turner never designed to remain long\r\nin California, and I consented to go back to St. Louis, confer with\r\nMr. Lucas and Captain Simonds, agree upon further details, and then\r\nreturn permanently.\r\n\r\nI have no memoranda by me now by which to determine the fact, but\r\nthink I returned to New York in July, 1853, by the Nicaragua route,\r\nand thence to St. Louis by way of Lancaster, Ohio, where my family\r\nstill was.  Mr. Lucas promptly agreed to the terms proposed, and\r\nfurther consented, on the expiration of the lease of the Adams &\r\nCo.  office, to erect a new banking-house in San Francisco, to cost\r\nfifty thousand dollars.  I then returned to Lancaster, explained to\r\nMr. Ewing and Mrs. Sherman all the details of our agreement, and,\r\nmeeting their approval, I sent to the Adjutant-General of the army\r\nmy letter of resignation, to take effect at the end of the six\r\nmonths' leave, and the resignation was accepted, to take effect\r\nSeptember 6, 1853.  Being then a citizen, I engaged a passage out\r\nto California by the Nicaragua route, in the steamer leaving New\r\nYork September 20th, for myself and family, and accordingly\r\nproceeded to New York, where I had a conference with Mr. Meigs,\r\ncashier of the American Exchange Bank, and with Messrs.  Wadsworth\r\n& Sheldon, bankers, who were our New York correspondents; and on\r\nthe 20th embarked for San Juan del Norte, with the family, composed\r\nof Mrs. Sherman, Lizzie, then less than a year old, and her nurse,\r\nMary Lynch.  Our passage  down was uneventful, and, on the boats up\r\nthe Nicaragua River, pretty much the same as before.  On reaching\r\nVirgin Bay, I engaged a native with three mules to carry us across\r\nto the Pacific, and as usual the trip partook of the ludicrous\r\n--Mrs. Sherman mounted on a donkey about as large as a Newfoundland\r\ndog; Mary Lynch on another, trying to carry Lizzie on a pillow\r\nbefore her, but her mule had a fashion of lying down, which scared\r\nher, till I exchanged mules, and my California spurs kept that mule\r\non his legs.  I carried Lizzie some time till she was fast asleep,\r\nwhen I got our native man to carry her awhile.  The child woke up,\r\nand, finding herself in the hands of a dark-visaged man, she yelled\r\nmost lustily till I got her away.  At the summit of the pass, there\r\nwas a clear-running brook, where we rested an hour, and bathed\r\nLizzie in its sweet waters.  We then continued to the end of our\r\njourney, and, without going to the tavern at San Juan del Sur, we\r\npassed directly to the vessel, then at anchor about two miles out.\r\nTo reach her we engaged a native boat, which had to be kept outside\r\nthe surf.  Mrs. Sherman was first taken in the arms of two stout\r\nnatives; Mary Lynch, carrying Lizzie, was carried by two others;\r\nand I followed, mounted on the back of a strapping fellow, while\r\nfifty or a hundred others were running to and fro, cackling like\r\ngeese.\r\n\r\nMary Lynch got scared at the surf, and began screaming like a fool,\r\nwhen Lizzie became convulsed with fear, and one of the natives\r\nrushed to her, caught her out of Mary's arms, and carried her\r\nswiftly to Mrs. Sherman, who, by that time, was in the boat, but\r\nLizzie had fainted with fear, and for a long time sobbed as though\r\npermanently injured.  For years she showed symptoms that made us\r\nbelieve she had never entirely recovered from the effects of the\r\nscare.  In due time we reached the steamer Sierra Nevada, and got a\r\ngood state-room.  Our passage up the coast was pleasant enough; we\r\nreached San Francisco; on the 15th of October, and took quarters at\r\nan hotel on Stockton Street, near Broadway.\r\n\r\nMajor Turner remained till some time in November, when he also\r\ndeparted for the East, leaving me and Nisbet to manage the bank.  I\r\nendeavored to make myself familiar with the business, but of course\r\nNisbet kept the books, and gave his personal attention to the\r\nloans, discounts, and drafts, which yielded the profits.  I soon\r\nsaw, however, that the three per cent. charged as premium on bills\r\nof exchange was not all profit, but out of this had to come one and\r\na fourth to one and a half for freight, one and a third for\r\ninsurance, with some indefinite promise of a return premium; then,\r\nthe cost of blanks, boxing of the bullion, etc., etc.  Indeed, I\r\nsaw no margin for profit at all.  Nisbet, however, who had long\r\nbeen familiar with the business, insisted there was a profit, in\r\nthe fact that the gold-dust or bullion shipped was more valuable\r\nthan its cost to us.  We, of course, had to remit bullion to meet\r\nour bills on New York, and bought crude gold-dust, or bars refined\r\nby Kellogg & Humbert or E. Justh & Co., for at that time the United\r\nStates Mint was not in operation.  But, as the reports of our\r\nshipments came back from New York, I discovered that I was right,\r\nand Nisbet was wrong; and, although we could not help selling our\r\nchecks on New York and St. Louis at the same price as other\r\nbankers, I discovered that, at all events, the exchange business in\r\nSan Francisco was rather a losing business than profitable.  The\r\nsame as to loans.  We could loan, at three per cent. a month, all\r\nour own money, say two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and a\r\npart of our deposit account.  This latter account in California was\r\ndecidedly uncertain.  The balance due depositors would run down to\r\na mere nominal sum on steamer-days, which were the 1st and 15th of\r\neach month, and then would increase till the next steamer-day, so\r\nthat we could not make use of any reasonable part of this balance\r\nfor loans beyond the next steamer-day; or, in other words, we had\r\nan expensive bank, with expensive clerks, and all the machinery for\r\ntaking care of other people's money for their benefit, without\r\ncorresponding profit.  I also saw that loans were attended with\r\nrisk commensurate with the rate; nevertheless, I could not attempt\r\nto reform the rules and customs established by others before me,\r\nand had to drift along with the rest toward that Niagara that none\r\nforesaw at the time.\r\n\r\nShortly after arriving out in 1853, we looked around for a site for\r\nthe new bank, and the only place then available on Montgomery\r\nStreet, the Wall Street of San Francisco, was a lot at the corner\r\nof Jackson Street, facing Montgomery, with an alley on the north,\r\nbelonging to James Lick.  The ground was sixty by sixty-two feet,\r\nand I had to pay for it thirty-two thousand dollars.  I then made a\r\ncontract with the builders, Keyser, & Brown, to erect a three-story\r\nbrick building, with finished basement, for about fifty thousand\r\ndollars.  This made eighty-two thousand instead of fifty thousand\r\ndollars, but I thought Mr. Lucas could stand it and would approve,\r\nwhich he did, though it resulted in loss to him.  After the civil\r\nwar, he told me he had sold the building for forty thousand\r\ndollars, about half its cost, but luckily gold was then at 250, so\r\nthat he could use the forty thousand dollars gold as the equivalent\r\nof one hundred thousand dollars currency.  The building was\r\nerected; I gave it my personal supervision, and it was strongly and\r\nthoroughly built, for I saw it two years ago, when several\r\nearthquakes had made no impression on it; still, the choice of site\r\nwas unfortunate, for the city drifted in the opposite direction,\r\nviz., toward Market Street.  I then thought that all the heavy\r\nbusiness would remain toward the foot of Broadway and Jackson\r\nStreet, because there were the deepest water and best wharves, but\r\nin this I made a mistake.  Nevertheless, in the spring of 1854, the\r\nnew bank was finished, and we removed to it, paying rents\r\nthereafter to our Mr. Lucas instead of to Adams & Co.  A man named\r\nWright, during the same season, built a still finer building just\r\nacross the street from us; Pioche, Bayerque & Co. were already\r\nestablished on another corner of Jackson Street, and the new\r\nMetropolitan Theatre was in progress diagonally opposite us.\r\nDuring the whole of 1854 our business steadily grew, our average\r\ndeposits going up to half a million, and our sales of exchange and\r\nconsequent shipment of bullion averaging two hundred thousand\r\ndollars per steamer.  I signed all bills of exchange, and insisted\r\non Nisbet consulting me on loans and discounts.  Spite of every\r\ncaution, however, we lost occasionally by bad loans, and worse by\r\nthe steady depreciation of real estate.  The city of San Francisco\r\nwas then extending her streets, sewering them, and planking them,\r\nwith three-inch lumber.  In payment for the lumber and the work of\r\ncontractors, the city authorities paid scrip in even sums of one\r\nhundred, five hundred, one thousand, and five thousand dollars.\r\nThese formed a favorite collateral for loans at from fifty to sixty\r\ncents on the dollar, and no one doubted their ultimate value,\r\neither by redemption or by being converted into city bonds.\r\nThe notes also of H. Meiggs, Neeley Thompson & Co., etc.,\r\nlumber-dealers, were favorite notes, for they paid their interest\r\npromptly, and lodged large margins of these street-improvement\r\nwarrants as collateral.  At that time, Meiggs was a prominent man,\r\nlived in style in a large house on Broadway, was a member of the\r\nCity Council, and owned large saw-mills up the coast about\r\nMendocino.  In him Nisbet had unbounded faith, but, for some\r\nreason, I feared or mistrusted him, and remember that I cautioned\r\nNisbet not to extend his credit, but to gradually contract his\r\nloans.  On looking over our bills receivable, then about six\r\nhundred thousand dollars, I found Meiggs, as principal or indorser,\r\nowed us about eighty thousand dollars--all, however, secured by\r\ncity warrants; still, he kept bank accounts elsewhere, and was\r\ngenerally a borrower.  I instructed Nisbet to insist on his\r\nreducing his line as the notes matured, and, as he found it\r\nindelicate to speak to Meiggs, I instructed him to refer him to me;\r\naccordingly, when, on the next steamer-day, Meiggs appealed at the\r\ncounter for a draft on Philadelphia, of about twenty thousand\r\ndollars, for which he offered his note and collateral, he was\r\nreferred to me, and I explained to him that our draft was the same\r\nas money; that he could have it for cash, but that we were already\r\nin advance to him some seventy-five or eighty thousand dollars, and\r\nthat instead of increasing the amount I must insist on its\r\nreduction.  He inquired if I mistrusted his ability, etc.  I\r\nexplained, certainly not, but that our duty was to assist those who\r\ndid all their business with us, and, as our means were necessarily\r\nlimited, I must restrict him to some reasonable sum, say,\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars.  Meiggs invited me to go with him to a\r\nrich mercantile house on Clay Street, whose partners belonged in\r\nHamburg, and there, in the presence of the principals of the house,\r\nhe demonstrated, as clearly as a proposition in mathematics, that\r\nhis business at Mendocino was based on calculations that could not\r\nfail.  The bill of exchange which he wanted, he said would make the\r\nlast payment on a propeller already built in Philadelphia, which\r\nwould be sent to San Francisco, to tow into and out of port the\r\nschooners and brigs that were bringing his lumber down the coast. I\r\nadmitted all he said, but renewed my determination to limit his\r\ncredit to twenty-five thousand dollars.  The Hamburg firm then\r\nagreed to accept for him the payment of all his debt to us, except\r\nthe twenty-five thousand dollars, payable in equal parts for the\r\nnext three steamer-days.  Accordingly, Meiggs went back with me to\r\nour bank, wrote his note for twenty-five thousand dollars, and\r\nsecured it by mortgage on real estate and city warrants, and\r\nsubstituted the three acceptances of the Hamburg firm for the\r\noverplus.  I surrendered to him all his former notes, except one for\r\nwhich he was indorser.  The three acceptances duly matured and were\r\npaid; one morning Meiggs and family were missing, and it was\r\ndiscovered they had embarked in a sailing-vessel for South America.\r\nThis was the beginning of a series of failures in San Francisco,\r\nthat extended through the next two years.  As soon as it was known\r\nthat Meiggs had fled, the town was full of rumors, and everybody was\r\nrunning to and fro to secure his money.  His debts amounted to\r\nnearly a million dollars.  The Hamburg house which, had been\r\nhumbugged, were heavy losers and failed, I think.  I took possession\r\nof Meiggs's dwelling-house and other property for which I held his\r\nmortgage, and in the city warrants thought I had an overplus; but it\r\ntranspired that Meiggs, being in the City Council, had issued\r\nvarious quantities of street scrip, which was adjudged a forgery,\r\nthough, beyond doubt, most of it, if not all, was properly signed,\r\nbut fraudulently issued.  On this city scrip our bank must have lost\r\nabout ten thousand dollars.  Meiggs subsequently turned up in Chili,\r\nwhere again he rose to wealth and has paid much of his San Francisco\r\ndebts, but none to us.  He is now in Peru, living like a prince.\r\nWith Meiggs fell all the lumber-dealers, and many persons dealing in\r\ncity scrip.  Compared with others, our loss was a trifle.  In a\r\nshort time things in San Francisco resumed their wonted course, and\r\nwe generally laughed at the escapade of Meiggs, and the cursing of\r\nhis deluded creditors.\r\n\r\nShortly after our arrival in San Francisco, I rented of a Mr.\r\nMarryat, son of the English Captain Marryat, the author, a small\r\nframe-house on Stockton Street, near Green, buying of him his\r\nfurniture, and we removed to it about December 1,1853.  Close by,\r\naround on Green Street, a man named Dickey was building two small\r\nbrick-houses, on ground which he had leased of Nicholson.  I bought\r\none of these houses, subject to the ground-rent, and moved into it\r\nas soon as finished.  Lieutenant T. H. Stevens, of the United\r\nStates Navy, with his family, rented the other; we lived in this\r\nhouse throughout the year 1854, and up to April 17, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n1855-1857\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring  the winter of 1854-'55, I received frequent intimations in\r\nmy letters from the St. Louis house, that the bank of Page, Bacon &\r\nCo.  was in trouble, growing out of their relations to the Ohio &\r\nMississippi Railroad, to the contractors for building which they\r\nhad made large advances, to secure which they had been compelled to\r\ntake, as it were, an assignment of the contract itself, and finally\r\nto assume all the liabilities of the contractors.  Then they had to\r\nborrow money in New York, and raise other money from time to time,\r\nin the purchase of iron and materials for the road, and to pay the\r\nhands.  The firm in St. Louis and that in San Francisco were\r\ndifferent, having different partners, and the St. Louis house\r\nnaturally pressed the San Francisco firm to ship largely of\r\n\"gold-dust,\" which gave them a great name; also to keep as large a\r\nbalance as possible in New York to sustain their credit.  Mr. Page\r\nwas a very wealthy man, but his wealth consisted mostly of land and\r\nproperty in St. Louis.  He was an old man, and a good one; had been\r\na baker, and knew little of banking as a business.  This part of\r\nhis general business was managed exclusively by his son-in-law,\r\nHenry D. Bacon, who was young, handsome, and generally popular.\r\nHow he was drawn into that affair of the Ohio & Mississippi road I\r\nhave no means of knowing, except by hearsay.  Their business in New\r\nYork was done through the American Exchange Bank, and through\r\nDuncan, Sherman & Co.  As we were rival houses, the St. Louis\r\npartners removed our account from the American Exchange Bank to the\r\nMetropolitan Bank; and, as Wadsworth & Sheldon had failed, I was\r\ninstructed to deal in time bills, and in European exchange, with\r\nSchnchardt & Gebhard, bankers in Nassau Street.\r\n\r\nIn California the house of Page, Bacon & Co.  was composed of the\r\nsame partners as in St. Louis, with the addition of Henry Haight,\r\nJudge Chambers, and young Frank Page.  The latter had charge of the\r\n\"branch\" in Sacramento.  Haight was the real head-man, but he was\r\ntoo fond of lager-beer to be in trusted with so large a business.\r\nBeyond all comparison, Page, Bacon & Co.  were the most prominent\r\nbankers in California in 1853-'55.  Though I had notice of danger\r\nin that quarter, from our partners in St. Louis, nobody in\r\nCalifornia doubted their wealth and stability.  They must have had,\r\nduring that winter, an average deposit account of nearly two\r\nmillion dollars, of which seven hundred thousand dollars was in\r\n\"certificates of deposit,\" the most stable of all accounts in a\r\nbank.  Thousands of miners invested their earnings in such\r\ncertificates, which they converted into drafts on New York, when\r\nthey were ready to go home or wanted to send their \"pile\" to their\r\nfamilies.  Adams & Co. were next in order, because of their\r\nnumerous offices scattered throughout the mining country.  A\r\ngentleman named Haskell had been in charge of Adams & Co. in San\r\nFrancisco, but in the winter of 1854-'55 some changes were made,\r\nand the banking department had been transferred to a magnificent\r\noffice in Halleck's new Metropolitan Block.  James King of Wm. had\r\ndiscontinued business on his own account, and been employed by\r\nAdams & Co. as their cashier and banker, and Isaiah C. Wood had\r\nsucceeded Haskell in chief control of the express department.\r\nWells, Fargo & Co. were also bankers as well as expressmen, and\r\nWilliam J. Pardee was the resident partner.\r\n\r\nAs the mail-steamer came in on February 17, 1855, according to her\r\ncustom, she ran close to the Long Wharf (Meiggs's) on North Beach,\r\nto throw ashore the express-parcels of news for speedy delivery.\r\nSome passenger on deck called to a man of his acquaintance standing\r\non the wharf, that Page & Bacon had failed in New York.  The news\r\nspread like wild-fire, but soon it was met by the newspaper\r\naccounts to the effect that some particular acceptances of Page &\r\nBacon, of St. Louis, in the hands of Duncan, Sherman & Co., in New\r\nYork, had gone to protest.  All who had balances at Page, Bacon &\r\nCo.'s, or held certificates of deposit, were more or less alarmed,\r\nwanted to secure their money, and a general excitement pervaded the\r\nwhole community.  Word was soon passed round that the matter\r\nadmitted of explanation, viz., that the two houses were distinct\r\nand separate concerns, that every draft of the California house had\r\nbeen paid in New York, and would continue to be paid.  It was\r\nexpected that this assertion would quiet the fears of the\r\nCalifornia creditors, but for the next three days there was a\r\nsteady \"run\" on that bank.  Page, Bacon & Co. stood the first day's\r\nrun very well, and, as I afterward learned, paid out about six\r\nhundred thousand dollars in gold coin.  On the 20th of February\r\nHenry Height came to our bank, to see what help we were willing to\r\ngive him; but I was out, and Nisbet could not answer positively for\r\nthe firm.  Our condition was then very strong.  The deposit account\r\nwas about six hundred thousand dollars, and we had in our vault\r\nabout five hundred thousand dollars in coin and bullion, besides an\r\nequal amount of good bills receivable.  Still I did not like to\r\nweaken ourselves to help others; but in a most friendly spirit,\r\nthat night after bank-hours, I went down to Page, Bacon & Co., and\r\nentered their office from the rear.  I found in the cashier's room\r\nFolsom, Parrott, Dewey and Payne, Captain Ritchie, Donohue, and\r\nothers, citizens and friends of the house, who had been called in\r\nfor consultation.  Passing into the main office, where all the\r\nbook-keepers, tellers, etc., with gas-lights, were busy writing up\r\nthe day's work, I found Mr. Page, Henry Height, and Judge Chambers.\r\nI spoke to Height, saying that I was sorry I had been out when he\r\ncalled at our bank, and had now come to see him in the most\r\nfriendly spirit.  Height had evidently been drinking, and said\r\nabruptly that \"all the banks would break,\" that \"no bank could\r\ninstantly pay all its obligations,\" etc.  I answered he could speak\r\nfor himself, but not for me; that I had come to offer to buy with\r\ncash a fair proportion of his bullion, notes, and bills; but, if\r\nthey were going to fail, I would not be drawn in.  Height's manner\r\nwas extremely offensive, but Mr. Page tried to smooth it over,\r\nsaying they had had a bad day's run, and could not answer for the\r\nresult till their books were written up.\r\n\r\nI passed back again into the room where the before-named gentlemen\r\nwere discussing some paper which lay before them, and was going to\r\npass out, when Captain Folsom, who was an officer of the army, a\r\nclass-mate and intimate friend of mine, handed me the paper the\r\ncontents of which they were discussing.  It was very short, and in\r\nHenry Haight's handwriting, pretty much in these terms: \"We, the\r\nundersigned property-holders of San Francisco, having personally\r\nexamined the books, papers, etc., of Page, Bacon & Co., do hereby\r\ncertify that the house is solvent and able to pay all its debts,\"\r\netc.  Height had drawn up and asked them to sign this paper, with\r\nthe intention to publish it in the next morning's papers, for\r\neffect.  While I was talking with Captain Folsom, Height came into\r\nthe room to listen.  I admitted that the effect of such a\r\npublication would surely be good, and would probably stave off\r\nimmediate demand till their assets could be in part converted or\r\nrealized; but I naturally inquired of Folsom, \"Have you personally\r\nexamined the accounts, as herein recited, and the assets, enough to\r\nwarrant your signature to this paper?\" for, \"thereby you in effect\r\nbecome indorsers.\"   Folsom said they had not, when Height turned\r\non me rudely and said, \"Do you think the affairs of such a house as\r\nPage, Bacon & Co. can be critically examined in an hour?\"  I\r\nanswered: \"These gentlemen can do what they please, but they have\r\ntwelve hours before the bank will open on the morrow, and if the\r\nledger is written up\" (as I believed it was or could be by\r\nmidnight), \"they can (by counting the coin, bullion on hand, and\r\nnotes or stocks of immediate realization) approximate near enough\r\nfor them to indorse for the remainder.\"  But Height pooh-poohed me,\r\nand I left.  Folsom followed me out, told me he could not afford to\r\nimperil all he had, and asked my advice.  I explained to him that\r\nmy partner Nisbet had been educated and trained in that very house\r\nof Page, Bacon & Co.; that we kept our books exactly as they did;\r\nthat every day the ledger was written up, so that from it one could\r\nsee exactly how much actual money was due the depositors and\r\ncertificates; and then by counting the money in the vault,\r\nestimating the bullion on hand, which, though not actual money,\r\ncould easily be converted into coin, and supplementing these\r\namounts by \"bills receivable,\" they ought to arrive at an\r\napproximate-result.  After Folsom had left me, John Parrott also\r\nstopped and talked with me to the same effect.  Next morning I\r\nlooked out for the notice, but no such notice appeared in the\r\nmorning papers, and I afterward learned that, on Parrott and Folsom\r\ndemanding an actual count of the money in the vault, Haight angrily\r\nrefused unless they would accept his word for it, when one after\r\nthe other declined to sign his paper.\r\n\r\nThe run on Page, Bacon & Co. therefore continued throughout the\r\n21st, and I expected all day to get an invitation to close our bank\r\nfor the next day, February 22, which we could have made a holiday\r\nby concerted action; but each banker waited for Page, Bacon & Co.\r\nto ask for it, and, no such circular coming, in the then state of\r\nfeeling no other banker was willing to take the initiative.  On the\r\nmorning of February 22, 1855, everybody was startled by receiving a\r\nsmall slip of paper, delivered at all the houses, on which was\r\nprinted a short notice that, for \"want of coin,\" Page, Bacon & Co.\r\nfound it necessary to close their bank for a short time.  Of\r\ncourse, we all knew the consequences, and that every other bank in\r\nSan Francisco would be tried.  During the 22d we all kept open, and\r\nwatched our depositors closely; but the day was generally observed\r\nby the people as a holiday, and the firemen paraded the streets of\r\nSan Francisco in unusual strength.  But, on writing up our books\r\nthat night, we found that our deposit account had diminished about\r\nsixty-five thousand dollars.  Still, there was no run on us, or any\r\nother of the banks, that day; yet, observing little knots of men on\r\nthe street, discussing the state of the banks generally, and\r\noverhearing Haight's expression quoted, that, in case of the\r\nfailure of Page, Bacon & Co., \"all the other banks would break,\" I\r\ndeemed it prudent to make ready.  For some days we had refused all\r\nloans and renewals, and we tried, without, success, some of our\r\ncall-loans; but, like Hotspur's spirits, they would not come.\r\n\r\nOur financial condition on that day (February 22, 1855) was: Due\r\ndepositors and demand certificates, five hundred and twenty\r\nthousand dollars; to meet which, we had in the vault: coin, three\r\nhundred and eighty thousand dollars; bullion, seventy-five thousand\r\ndollars; and bills receivable, about six hundred thousand dollars.\r\nOf these, at least one hundred thousand dollars were on demand,\r\nwith stock collaterals.  Therefore, for the extent of our business,\r\nwe were stronger than the Bank of England, or any bank in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight next morning, our door-bell was rung, and I was\r\ncalled down-stairs by E. Casserly, Esq. (an eminent lawyer of the\r\nday, since United States Senator), who informed me he had just come\r\nup from the office of Adams & Co., to tell me that their affairs\r\nwere in such condition that they would not open that morning at\r\nall; and that this, added to the suspension of Page, Bacon & Co.,\r\nannounced the day before, would surely cause a general run on all\r\nthe banks.  I informed him that I expected as much, and was\r\nprepared for it.\r\n\r\nIn going down to the bank that morning, I found Montgomery Street\r\nfull; but, punctually to the minute, the bank opened, and in rushed\r\nthe crowd.  As usual, the most noisy and clamorous were men and\r\nwomen who held small certificates; still, others with larger\r\naccounts were in the crowd, pushing forward for their balances.\r\nAll were promptly met and paid.  Several gentlemen of my personal\r\nacquaintance merely asked my word of honor that their money was\r\nsafe, and went away; others, who had large balances, and no\r\nimmediate use for coin, gladly accepted gold-bars, whereby we paid\r\nout the seventy-five thousand dollars of bullion, relieving the\r\ncoin to that amount.\r\n\r\nMeantime, rumors from the street came pouring in that Wright & Co.\r\nhad failed; then Wells, Fargo & Co.; then Palmer, Cook & Co., and\r\nindeed all, or nearly all, the banks of the city; and I was told\r\nthat parties on the street were betting high, first, that we would\r\nclose our doors at eleven o'clock; then twelve, and so on; but we\r\ndid not, till the usual hour that night.  We had paid every demand,\r\nand still had a respectable amount left.\r\n\r\nThis run on the bank (the only one I ever experienced) presented\r\nall the features, serious and comical, usual to such occasions.  At\r\nour counter happened that identical case, narrated of others, of\r\nthe Frenchman, who was nearly squeezed to death in getting to the\r\ncounter, and, when he received his money, did not know what to do\r\nwith it.  \"If you got the money, I no want him; but if you no got\r\nhim, I want it like the devil!\"\r\n\r\nToward the close of the day, some of our customers deposited,\r\nrather ostentatiously, small amounts, not aggregating more than\r\neight or ten thousand dollars.  Book-keepers and tellers were kept\r\nat work to write up the books; and these showed:\r\n\r\nDue depositors and certificates, about one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand dollars, for which remained of coin about fifty thousand\r\ndollars.  I resolved not to sleep until I had collected from those\r\nowing the bank a part of their debts; for I was angry with them\r\nthat they had stood back and allowed the panic to fall on the banks\r\nalone.  Among these were Captain Folsom, who owed us twenty-five\r\nthousand dollars, secured by a mortgage on the American Theatre and\r\nTehama Hotel; James Smiley, contractor for building the\r\nCustom-House, who owed us two notes of twenty thousand and sixteen\r\nthousand dollars, for which we held, as collateral, two acceptances\r\nof the collector of the port, Major R. P. Hammond, for twenty\r\nthousand dollars each; besides other private parties that I need\r\nnot name.  The acceptances given to Smiley were for work done on\r\nthe Custom-House, but could not be paid until the work was actually\r\nlaid in the walls, and certified by Major Tower, United States\r\nEngineers; but Smiley had an immense amount of granite, brick,\r\niron, etc., on the ground, in advance of construction, and these\r\nacceptances were given him expressly that he might raise money\r\nthereon for the payment of such materials.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as soon as I got my dinner, I took my saddle-horse, and\r\nrode to Captain Folsom's house, where I found him in great pain and\r\ndistress, mental and physical.  He was sitting in a chair, and\r\nbathing his head with a sponge.  I explained to him the object of\r\nmy visit, and he said he had expected it, and had already sent his\r\nagent, Van Winkle, down-town, with instructions to raise what money\r\nhe could at any cost; but he did not succeed in raising a cent.  So\r\ngreat was the shock to public confidence, that men slept on their\r\nmoney, and would not loan it for ten per cent.  a week, on any\r\nsecurity whatever--even on mint certificates, which were as good as\r\ngold, and only required about ten days to be paid in coin by the\r\nUnited States Mint.  I then rode up to Hammond's house, on Rincon\r\nHill, and found him there.  I explained to him exactly Smiley's\r\naffairs, and only asked him to pay one of his acceptances.  He\r\ninquired, \"Why not both?\"  I answered that was so much the better;\r\nit would put me under still greater obligations.  He then agreed to\r\nmeet me at our bank at 10 P.M.  I sent word to others that I\r\ndemanded them to pay what they could on their paper, and then\r\nreturned to the bank, to meet Hammond.  In due time, he came down\r\nwith Palmer (of Palmer, Cook & Co.), and there he met Smiley, who\r\nwas, of course, very anxious to retire his notes.  We there\r\ndiscussed the matter fully, when Hammond said, \"Sherman, give me up\r\nmy two acceptances, and I will substitute therefor my check of\r\nforty thousand dollars,\" with \"the distinct understanding that, if\r\nthe money is not needed by you, it shall be returned to me, and the\r\ntransaction then to remain statu quo.\"  To this there was a general\r\nassent.  Nisbet handed him his two acceptances, and he handed me\r\nhis check, signed as collector of the port, on Major J. R. Snyder,\r\nUnited States Treasurer, for forty thousand dollars.  I afterward\r\nrode out, that night, to Major Snyder's house on North Beach, saw\r\nhim, and he agreed to meet me at 8 A.M.  next day, at the United\r\nStates Mint, and to pay the check, so that I could have the money\r\nbefore the bank opened.  The next morning, as agreed on, we met,\r\nand he paid me the check in two sealed bags of gold-coin, each\r\nmarked twenty thousand dollars, which I had carried to the bank,\r\nbut never opened them, or even broke the seals.\r\n\r\nThat morning our bank opened as usual, but there was no appearance\r\nof a continuation of the \"run;\" on the contrary, money began to\r\ncome back on deposit, so that by night we had a considerable\r\nincrease, and this went on from day to day, till nearly the old\r\ncondition of things returned.  After about three days, finding I\r\nhad no use for the money obtained on Hammond's check, I took the\r\nidentical two bags back to the cashier of the Custom-House, and\r\nrecovered the two acceptances which had been surrendered as\r\ndescribed; and Smiley's two notes were afterward paid in their due\r\ncourse, out of the cash received on those identical acceptances.\r\nBut, years afterward, on settling with Hammond for the Custom-House\r\ncontract when completed, there was a difference, and Smiley sued\r\nLucas, Turner & Co. for money had and received for his benefit,\r\nbeing the identical forty thousand dollars herein explained, but he\r\nlost his case.  Hammond, too, was afterward removed from office,\r\nand indicted in part for this transaction.  He was tried before the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court, Judge McAlister presiding, for a\r\nviolation of the sub-Treasury Act, but was acquitted.  Our bank,\r\nhaving thus passed so well through the crisis, took at once a first\r\nrank; but these bank failures had caused so many mercantile losses,\r\nand had led to such an utter downfall in the value of real estate,\r\nthat everybody lost more or less money by bad debts, by\r\ndepreciation of stocks and collaterals, that became unsalable, if\r\nnot worthless.\r\n\r\nAbout this time (viz., February, 1855) I had exchanged my house on\r\nGreen, street, with Mr. Sloat, for the half of a fifty-vara lot on\r\nHarrison Street, between Fremont and First, on which there was a\r\nsmall cottage, and I had contracted for the building of a new\r\nframe-house thereon, at six thousand dollars.  This house was\r\nfinished on the 9th of April, and my family moved into it at once.\r\n\r\nFor some time Mrs. Sherman had been anxious to go home to\r\nLancaster, Ohio, where we had left our daughter Minnie, with her\r\ngrandparents, and we arranged that S. M. Bowman, Esq., and wife,\r\nshould move into our new house and board us, viz., Lizzie, Willie\r\nwith the nurse Biddy, and myself, for a fair consideration.  It so\r\nhappened that two of my personal friends, Messrs.  Winters and\r\nCunningham of Marysville, and a young fellow named Eagan, now a\r\ncaptain in the Commissary Department, were going East in the\r\nsteamer of the middle of April, and that Mr..  William H.\r\nAspinwall, of New York, and Mr. Chauncey, of Philadelphia, were\r\nalso going back; and they all offered to look to the personal\r\ncomfort of Mrs. Sherman on the voyage.  They took passage in the\r\nsteamer Golden Age (Commodore Watkins), which sailed on April 17,\r\n1855.  Their passage down the coast was very pleasant till within a\r\nday's distance of Panama, when one bright moonlit night, April\r\n29th, the ship, running at full speed, between the Islands Quibo\r\nand Quicara, struck on a sunken reef, tore out a streak in her\r\nbottom, and at once began to fill with water.  Fortunately she did\r\nnot sink fast, but swung off into deep water, and Commodore Watkins\r\nhappening to be on deck at the moment, walking with Mr. Aspinwall,\r\nlearning that the water was rushing in with great rapidity, gave\r\norders for a full head of steam, and turned the vessel's bow\r\nstraight for the Island Quicara.  The water rose rapidly in the\r\nhold, the passengers were all assembled, fearful of going down, the\r\nfires were out, and the last revolution of the wheels made, when\r\nher bow touched gently on the beach, and the vessel's stern sank in\r\ndeep water.  Lines were got out, and the ship held in an upright\r\nposition, so that the passengers were safe, and but little\r\nincommoded.  I have often heard Mrs. Sherman tell of the boy Eagan,\r\nthen about fourteen years old, coming to her state-room, and\r\ntelling to her not to be afraid, as he was a good swimmer; but on\r\ncoming out into the cabin, partially dressed, she felt more\r\nconfidence in the cool manner, bearing, and greater strength of Mr.\r\nWinters.  There must have been nearly a thousand souls on board at\r\nthe time, few of whom could have been saved had the steamer gone\r\ndown in mid-channel, which surely would have resulted, had not\r\nCommodore Watkins been on deck, or had he been less prompt in his\r\ndetermination to beach his ship.  A sailboat was dispatched toward\r\nPanama, which luckily met the steamer John T. Stephens, just coming\r\nout of the bay, loaded with about a thousand passengers bound for\r\nSan Francisco, and she at once proceeded to the relief of the\r\nGolden Age.  Her passengers were transferred in small boats to the\r\nStephens, which vessel, with her two thousand people crowded\r\ntogether with hardly standing-room, returned to Panama, whence the\r\npassengers for the East proceeded to their destination without\r\nfurther delay.  Luckily for Mrs. Sherman, Purser Goddard, an old\r\nOhio friend of ours, was on the Stephens, and most kindly gave up\r\nhis own room to her, and such lady friends as she included in her\r\nparty.  The Golden Age was afterward partially repaired at Quicara,\r\npumped out, and steamed to Panama, when, after further repairs, she\r\nresumed her place in the line.  I think she is still in existence,\r\nbut Commodore Watkins afterward lost his life in China, by falling\r\ndown a hatchway.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sherman returned in the latter part of November of the same\r\nyear, when Mr. and Mrs. Bowman, who meantime had bought a lot next\r\nto us and erected a house thereon, removed to it, and we thus\r\ncontinued close neighbors and friends until we left the country for\r\ngood in 1857.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1856, in San Francisco, occurred one of those\r\nunhappy events, too common to new countries, in which I became\r\ninvolved in spite of myself.\r\n\r\nWilliam Neely Johnson was Governor of California, and resided at\r\nSacramento City; General John E. Wool commanded the Department of\r\nCalifornia, having succeeded General Hitchcock, and had his\r\nheadquarters at Benicia; and a Mr. Van Ness was mayor of the city.\r\nPolitics had become a regular and profitable business, and\r\npoliticians were more than suspected of being corrupt.  It was\r\nreported and currently believed that the sheriff (Scannell) had\r\nbeen required to pay the Democratic Central Committee a hundred\r\nthousand dollars for his nomination, which was equivalent to an\r\nelection, for an office of the nominal salary of twelve thousand\r\ndollars a year for four years.  In the election all sorts of\r\ndishonesty were charged and believed, especially of \"ballot-box\r\nstuffing,\" and too generally the better classes avoided the\r\nelections and dodged jury-duty, so that the affairs of the city\r\ngovernment necessarily passed into the hands of a low set of\r\nprofessional politicians.  Among them was a man named James Casey,\r\nwho edited a small paper, the printing office of which was in a\r\nroom on the third floor of our banking office.  I hardly knew him\r\nby sight, and rarely if ever saw his paper; but one day Mr. Sather,\r\nof the excellent banking firm of Drexel, Sather & Church, came to\r\nme, and called my attention to an article in Casey's paper so full\r\nof falsehood and malice, that we construed it as an effort to\r\nblack-mail the banks generally.  At that time we were all laboring\r\nto restore confidence, which had been so rudely shaken by the\r\npanic, and I went up-stairs, found Casey, and pointed out to him\r\nthe objectionable nature of his article, told him plainly that I\r\ncould not tolerate his attempt to print and circulate slanders in\r\nour building, and, if he repeated it, I would cause him and his\r\npress to be thrown out of the windows.  He took the hint and moved\r\nto more friendly quarters.  I mention this fact, to show my\r\nestimate of the man, who became a figure in the drama I am about to\r\ndescribe.  James King of Wm., as before explained, was in 1853 a\r\nbanker on his own account, but some time in 1854 he had closed out\r\nhis business, and engaged with Adams & Co. as cashier.  When this\r\nfirm failed, he, in common with all the employees, was thrown out\r\nof employment, and had to look around for something else.  He\r\nsettled down to the publication of an evening paper, called the\r\nBulletin, and, being a man of fine manners and address, he at once\r\nconstituted himself the champion of society against the public and\r\nprivate characters whom he saw fit to arraign.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, this soon brought him into the usual\r\nnewspaper war with other editors, and especially with Casey, and\r\nepithets a la \"Eatanswill\" were soon bandying back and forth\r\nbetween them.  One evening of May, 1856, King published, in the\r\nBulletin, copies of papers procured from New York, to show that\r\nCasey had once been sentenced to the State penitentiary at Sing\r\nSing.  Casey took mortal offense, and called at the Bulletin\r\noffice, on the corner of Montgomery and Merchant Streets, where he\r\nfound King, and violent words passed between them, resulting in\r\nCasey giving King notice that he would shoot him on sight.  King\r\nremained in his office till about 5 or 6 p.m., when he started\r\ntoward his home on Stockton Street, and, as he neared the corner of\r\nWashington, Casey approached him from the opposite direction,\r\ncalled to him, and began firing.  King had on a short cloak, and in\r\nhis breast-pocket a small pistol, which he did not use.  One of\r\nCasey's shots struck him high up in the breast, from which he\r\nreeled, was caught by some passing friend, and carried into the\r\nexpress-office on the corner, where he was laid on the counter; and\r\na surgeon sent for.  Casey escaped up Washington Street, went to\r\nthe City Hall, and delivered himself to the sheriff (Scannell), who\r\nconveyed him to jail and locked him in a cell.  Meantime, the news\r\nspread like wildfire, and all the city was in commotion, for grog\r\nwas very popular.  Nisbet, who boarded with us on Harrison Street,\r\nhad been delayed at the bank later than usual, so that he happened\r\nto be near at the time, and, when he came out to dinner, he brought\r\nme the news of this affair, and said that there was every\r\nappearance of a riot down-town that night.  This occurred toward\r\nthe evening of May 14, 1856.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that, on the urgent solicitation of Van Winkle and\r\nof Governor Johnson; I had only a few days before agreed to accept\r\nthe commission of major-general of the Second Division of Militia,\r\nembracing San Francisco.  I had received the commission, but\r\nhad not as yet formally accepted it, or even put myself in\r\ncommunication with the volunteer companies of the city.  Of these,\r\nat that moment of time, there was a company of artillery with four\r\nguns, commanded by a Captain Johns, formerly of the army, and two\r\nor three uniformed companies of infantry.  After dinner I went down\r\ntown to see what was going on; found that King had been removed to\r\na room in the Metropolitan Block; that his life was in great peril;\r\nthat Casey was safe in jail, and the sheriff had called to his\r\nassistance a posse of the city police, some citizens, and one of\r\nthe militia companies.  The people were gathered in groups on the\r\nstreets, and the words \"Vigilance Committee\" were freely spoken,\r\nbut I saw no signs of immediate violence.  The next morning, I\r\nagain went to the jail, and found all things quiet, but the militia\r\nhad withdrawn.  I then went to the City Hall, saw the mayor, Van\r\nNess, and some of the city officials, agreed to do what I could to\r\nmaintain order with such militia as were on hand, and then formally\r\naccepted the commission, and took the \"oath.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1851 (when I was not in California) there had been a Vigilance\r\nCommittee, and it was understood that its organization still\r\nexisted.  All the newspapers took ground in favor of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee, except the Herald (John Nugent, editor), and nearly all\r\nthe best people favored that means of redress.  I could see they\r\nwere organizing, hiring rendezvous, collecting arms, etc., without\r\nconcealment.  It was soon manifest that the companies of volunteers\r\nwould go with the \"committee,\" and that the public authorities\r\ncould not rely on them for aid or defense.  Still, there were a\r\ngood many citizens who contended that, if the civil authorities\r\nwere properly sustained by the people at large, they could and\r\nwould execute the law.  But the papers inflamed the public mind,\r\nand the controversy spread to the country.  About the third day\r\nafter the shooting of King, Governor Johnson telegraphed me that he\r\nwould be down in the evening boat, and asked me to meet him on\r\narrival for consultation.  I got C. H. Garrison to go with me, and\r\nwe met the Governor and his brother on the wharf, and walked up to\r\nthe International Hotel on Jackson Street, above Montgomery.  We\r\ndiscussed the state of affairs fully; and Johnson, on learning that\r\nhis particular friend, William T. Coleman, was the president of the\r\nVigilance Committee, proposed to go and see him.  En route we\r\nstopped at King's room, ascertained that he was slowly sinking, and\r\ncould not live long; and then near midnight we walked to the\r\nTurnverein Hall, where the committee was known to be sitting in\r\nconsultation.  This hall was on Bush Street, at about the\r\nintersection of Stockton.  It was all lighted up within, but the\r\ndoor was locked.  The Governor knocked at the door, and on inquiry\r\nfrom inside  \"Who's there?\"--gave his name.  After some delay we\r\nwere admitted into a sort of vestibule, beyond which was a large\r\nhall, and we could hear the suppressed voices of a multitude.  We\r\nwere shown into a bar-room to the right, when the Governor asked to\r\nsee Coleman.  The man left us, went into the main hall, and soon\r\nreturned with Coleman, who was pale and agitated.  After shaking\r\nhands all round, the Governor said, \"Coleman, what the devil is the\r\nmatter here?\" Coleman said, \"Governor, it is time this shooting on\r\nour streets should stop.\"  The Governor replied, \"I agree with you\r\nperfectly, and have come down, from Sacramento to assist.\"  Coleman\r\nrejoined that \"the people were tired of it, and had no faith in the\r\nofficers of the law.\"  A general conversation then followed, in\r\nwhich it was admitted that King would die, and that Casey must be\r\nexecuted; but the manner of execution was the thing to be settled,\r\nColeman contending that the people would do it without trusting the\r\ncourts or the sheriff.  It so happened that at that time Judge\r\nNorton was on the bench of the court having jurisdiction, and he\r\nwas universally recognized as an able and upright man, whom no one\r\ncould or did mistrust; and it also happened that a grand-jury was\r\nthen in session.  Johnson argued that the time had passed in\r\nCalifornia for mobs and vigilance committees, and said if Coleman\r\nand associates would use their influence to support the law, he\r\n(the Governor) would undertake that, as soon as King died, the\r\ngrand-jury should indict, that Judge Norton would try the murderer,\r\nand the whole proceeding should be as speedy as decency would\r\nallow.  Then Coleman said \"the people had no confidence in\r\nScannell, the sheriff,\" who was, he said, in collusion with the\r\nrowdy element of San Francisco.  Johnson then offered to be\r\npersonally responsible that Casey should be safely guarded, and\r\nshould be forthcoming for trial and execution at the proper time.\r\nI remember very well Johnson's assertion that he had no right to\r\nmake these stipulations, and maybe no power to fulfill them; but he\r\ndid it to save the city and state from the disgrace of a mob.\r\nColeman disclaimed that the vigilance organization was a \"mob,\"\r\nadmitted that the proposition of the Governor was fair, and all he\r\nor any one should ask; and added, if we would wait awhile, he would\r\nsubmit it to the council, and bring back an answer.\r\n\r\nWe waited nearly an hour, and could hear the hum of voices\r\nin the hall, but no words, when Coleman came back, accompanied by a\r\ncommittee, of which I think the two brothers Arrington, Thomas\r\nSmiley the auctioneer, Seymour, Truett, and others, were members.\r\nThe whole conversation was gone over again, and the Governor's\r\nproposition was positively agreed to, with this further condition,\r\nthat the Vigilance Committee should send into the jail a small\r\nforce of their own men, to make certain that Casey should not be\r\ncarried off or allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, his brother William, Garrison, and I, then went up to\r\nthe jail, where we found the sheriff and his posse comitatus of\r\npolice and citizens.  These were styled the \"Law-and-Order party,\"\r\nand some of them took offense that the Governor should have held\r\ncommunication with the \"damned rebels,\" and several of them left\r\nthe jail; but the sheriff seemed to agree with the Governor that\r\nwhat he had done was right and best; and, while we were there, some\r\neight or ten armed men arrived from the Vigilance Committee, and\r\nwere received by the sheriff (Scannell) as a part of his regular\r\nposse.\r\n\r\nThe Governor then, near daylight, went to his hotel, and I to my\r\nhouse for a short sleep.  Next day I was at the bank, as usual,\r\nwhen, about noon the Governor called, and asked me to walk with him\r\ndown-street He said he had just received a message from the\r\nVigilance Committee to the effect that they were not bound by\r\nColeman's promise not to do any thing till the regular trial by\r\njury should be had, etc.  He was with reason furious, and asked me\r\nto go with him to Truett's store, over which the Executive\r\nCommittee was said to be in session.  We were admitted to a\r\nfront-room up-stairs, and heard voices in the back-room.  The\r\nGovernor inquired for Coleman, but he was not forthcoming.  Another\r\nof the committee, Seymour, met us, denied in toto the promise of\r\nthe night before, and the Governor openly accused him of treachery\r\nand falsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quarrel became public, and the newspapers took it up, both\r\nparties turning on the Governor; one, the Vigilantes, denying the\r\npromise made by Coleman, their president; and the other, the\r\n\"Law-and-Order party,\" refusing any farther assistance, because\r\nJohnson had stooped to make terms with rebels.  At all events, he\r\nwas powerless, and had to let matters drift to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nKing died about Friday, May 20th, and the funeral was appointed for\r\nthe next Sunday.  Early on that day the Governor sent for me at my\r\nhouse.  I found him on the roof of the International, from which we\r\nlooked down on the whole city, and more especially the face of\r\nTelegraph Hill, which was already covered with a crowd of people,\r\nwhile others were moving toward the jail on Broadway.  Parties of\r\narmed men, in good order, were marching by platoons in the same\r\ndirection; and formed in line along Broadway, facing the jail-door.\r\nSoon a small party was seen to advance to this door, and knock; a\r\nparley ensued, the doors were opened, and Casey was led out.  In a\r\nfew minutes another prisoner was brought out, who, proved to be\r\nCora, a man who had once been tried for killing Richardson, the\r\nUnited States Marshal, when the jury disagreed, and he was awaiting\r\na new trial.  These prisoners were placed in carriages, and\r\nescorted by the armed force down to the rooms of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee, through the principal streets of the city.  The day was\r\nexceedingly beautiful, and the whole proceeding was orderly in the\r\nextreme.  I was under the impression that Casey and Cora were\r\nhanged that same Sunday, but was probably in error; but in a very\r\nfew days they were hanged by the neck--dead--suspended from beams\r\nprojecting from the windows of the committee's rooms, without other\r\ntrial than could be given in secret, and by night.\r\n\r\nWe all thought the matter had ended there, and accordingly the\r\nGovernor returned to Sacramento in disgust, and I went about my\r\nbusiness.  But it soon became manifest that the Vigilance Committee\r\nhad no intention to surrender the power thus usurped.  They took a\r\nbuilding on Clay Street, near Front, fortified it, employed guards\r\nand armed sentinels, sat in midnight council, issued writs of\r\narrest and banishment, and utterly ignored all authority but their\r\nown.  A good many men were banished and forced to leave the\r\ncountry, but they were of that class we could well spare.  Yankee\r\nSullivan, a prisoner in their custody, committed suicide, and a\r\nfeeling of general insecurity pervaded the city.  Business was\r\nderanged; and the Bulletin, then under control of Tom King, a\r\nbrother of James, poured out its abuse on some of our best men, as\r\nwell as the worst.  Governor Johnson, being again appealed to,\r\nconcluded to go to work regularly, and telegraphed me about the 1st\r\nof June to meet him at General Wool's headquarters at Benicia that\r\nnight.  I went up, and we met at the hotel where General Wool was\r\nboarding.  Johnson had with him his Secretary of State.  We\r\ndiscussed the state of the country generally, and I had agreed that\r\nif Wool would give us arms and ammunition out of the United States\r\nArsenal at Benicia, and if Commodore Farragat, of the navy,\r\ncommanding the navy-yard on Mare Island, would give us a ship, I\r\nwould call out volunteers, and, when a sufficient number had\r\nresponded, I would have the arms come down from Benicia in the\r\nship, arm my men, take possession of a thirty-two-pound-gun battery\r\nat the Marine Hospital on Rincon Point, thence command a dispersion\r\nof the unlawfully-armed force of the Vigilance Committee, and\r\narrest some of the leaders.\r\n\r\nWe played cards that night, carrying on a conversation, in which\r\nWool insisted on a proclamation commanding the Vigilance Committee\r\nto disperse, etc., and he told us how he had on some occasion, as\r\nfar back as 1814, suppressed a mutiny on the Northern frontier.  I\r\ndid not understand him to make any distinct promise of assistance\r\nthat night, but he invited us to accompany him on an inspection of\r\nthe arsenal the next day, which we did.  On handling some rifled\r\nmuskets in the arsenal storehouse he asked me how they would answer\r\nour purpose.  I said they were the very things, and that we did not\r\nwant cartridge boxes or belts, but that I would have the cartridges\r\ncarried in the breeches-pockets, and the caps in the vestpockets.\r\nI knew that there were stored in that arsenal four thousand\r\nmuskets, for I recognized the boxes which we had carried out in the\r\nLexington around Cape Horn in 1846.  Afterward we all met at the\r\nquarters of Captain D. R. Jones of the army, and I saw the\r\nSecretary of State, D. F. Douglass, Esq., walk out with General\r\nWool in earnest conversation, and this Secretary of State afterward\r\nasserted that Wool there and then promised us the arms and\r\nammunition, provided the Governor would make his proclamation for\r\nthe committee to disperse, and that I should afterward call out the\r\nmilitia, etc.  On the way back to the hotel at Benicia, General\r\nWool, Captain Callendar of the arsenal, and I, were walking side by\r\nside, and I was telling him (General Wool) that I would also need\r\nsome ammunition for the thirty-two-pound guns then in position at\r\nRineon Point, when Wool turned to Callendar and inquired, \"Did I\r\nnot order those guns to be brought away?\"  Callendar said \"Yes,\r\ngeneral.  I made a requisition on the quartermaster for\r\ntransportation, but his schooner has been so busy that the guns are\r\nstill there.\"  Then said Wool: \"Let them remain; we may have use for\r\nthem.\"  I therefrom inferred, of course, that it was all agreed to\r\nso far as he was concerned.\r\n\r\nSoon after we had reached the hotel, we ordered a buggy, and\r\nGovernor Johnson and I drove to Vallejo, six miles, crossed over to\r\nMare Island, and walked up to the commandant's house, where we\r\nfound Commodore Farragut and his family.  We stated our business\r\nfairly, but the commodore answered very frankly that he had no\r\nauthority, without orders from his department, to take any part in\r\ncivil broils; he doubted the wisdom of the attempt; said he had no\r\nship available except the John Adams, Captain Boutwell, and that\r\nshe needed repairs.  But he assented at last, to the proposition to\r\nlet the sloop John Adams drop down abreast of the city after\r\ncertain repairs, to lie off there for moral effect, which afterward\r\nactually occurred.\r\n\r\nWe then returned to Benicia, and Wool's first question was, \"What\r\nluck?\"  We answered, \"Not much,\" and explained what Commodore\r\nFarragut could and would do, and that, instead of having a naval\r\nvessel, we would seize and use one of the Pacific Mail Company's\r\nsteamers, lying at their dock in Benicia, to carry down to San\r\nFrancisco the arms and munitions when the time came.\r\n\r\nAs the time was then near at hand for the arrival of the evening\r\nboats, we all walked down to the wharf together, where I told\r\nJohnson that he could not be too careful; that I had not heard\r\nGeneral Wool make a positive promise of assistance.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Johnson called General Wool to one side, and we three\r\ndrew together.  Johnson said: \"General Wool, General Sherman is\r\nvery particular, and wants to know exactly what you propose to do.\"\r\nWool answered: \"I understand, Governor, that in the first place a\r\nwrit of Habeas corpus will be issued commanding the jailers of the\r\nVigilance Committee to produce the body of some one of the\r\nprisoners held by them (which, of course, will be refused); that\r\nyou then issue your proclamation commanding them to disperse, and,\r\nfailing this, you will call out the militia, and command General\r\nSherman with it to suppress the Vigilance Committee as an unlawful\r\nbody;\" to which the Governor responded, \"Yes.\"  \"Then,\" said Wool,\r\n\"on General Sherman's making his requisition, approved by you, I\r\nwill order the issue of the necessary arms and ammunition.\"  I\r\nremember well that I said, emphatically: \"That is all I want.\r\n--Now, Governor, you may go ahead.\"  We soon parted; Johnson and\r\nDouglas taking the boat to Sacramento, and I to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe Chief-Justice, Terry, came to San Francisco the next day,\r\nissued a writ of habeas corpus for the body of one Maloney, which\r\nwrit was resisted, as we expected.  The Governor then issued his\r\nproclamation, and I published my orders, dated June 4, 1855.  The\r\nQuartermaster-General of the State, General Kibbe, also came to San\r\nFrancisco, took an office in the City Hall, engaged several rooms\r\nfor armories, and soon the men began to enroll into companies.  In\r\nmy general orders calling out the militia, I used the expression,\r\n\"When a sufficient number of men are enrolled, arms and ammunition\r\nwill be supplied.\"  Some of the best men of the \"Vigilantes\" came\r\nto me and remonstrated, saying that collision would surely result;\r\nthat it would be terrible, etc.  All I could say in reply was, that\r\nit was for them to get out of the way.  \"Remove your fort; cease\r\nyour midnight councils; and prevent your armed bodies from\r\npatrolling the streets.\"  They inquired where I was to get arms,\r\nand I answered that I had them certain.  But personally I went\r\nright along with my business at the bank, conscious that at any\r\nmoment we might have trouble.  Another committee of citizens, a\r\nconciliatory body, was formed to prevent collision if possible, and\r\nthe newspapers boiled over with vehement vituperation.  This second\r\ncommittee was composed of such men as Crockett, Ritchie, Thornton,\r\nBailey Peyton, Foote, Donohue, Kelly, and others, a class of the\r\nmost intelligent and wealthy men of the city, who earnestly and\r\nhonestly desired to prevent bloodshed.  They also came to me, and I\r\ntold them that our men were enrolling very fast, and that, when I\r\ndeemed the right moment had come, the Vigilance Committee must\r\ndisperse, else bloodshed and destruction of property would\r\ninevitably follow.  They also had discovered that the better men of\r\nthe Vigilance Committee itself were getting tired of the business,\r\nand thought that in the execution of Casey and Cora, and the\r\nbanishment of a dozen or more rowdies, they had done enough, and\r\nwere then willing to stop.  It was suggested that, if our\r\nLaw-and-Order party would not arm, by a certain day near at hand\r\nthe committee would disperse, and some of their leaders would\r\nsubmit to an indictment and trial by a jury of citizens, which they\r\nknew would acquit them of crime.  One day in the bank a man called\r\nme to the counter and said, \"If you expect to get arms of General\r\nWool, you will be mistaken, for I was at Benicia yesterday, and\r\nheard him say he would not give them.\"  This person was known to me\r\nto be a man of truth, and I immediately wrote to General Wool a\r\nletter telling him what I had heard, and how any hesitation on his\r\npart would compromise me as a man of truth and honor; adding that I\r\ndid not believe we should ever need the arms, but only the promise\r\nof them, for \"the committee was letting down, and would soon\r\ndisperse and submit to the law,\" etc.  I further asked him to\r\nanswer me categorically that very night, by the Stockton boat,\r\nwhich would pass Benicia on its way down about midnight, and I\r\nwould sit up and wait for his answer.  I did wait for his letter,\r\nbut it did not come, and the next day I got a telegraphic dispatch\r\nfrom Governor Johnson, who, at Sacramento, had also heard of\r\nGeneral Wool's \"back-down,\" asking me to meet him again at Benicia\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nI went up in the evening boat, and found General Wool's\r\naide-de-camp, Captain Arnold, of the army, on the wharf, with a\r\nletter in his hand, which he said was for me.  I asked for it, but\r\nhe said he knew its importance, and preferred we should go to\r\nGeneral Wool's room together, and the general could hand it to me in\r\nperson.  We did go right up to General Wool's, who took the sealed\r\nparcel and laid it aside, saying that it was literally a copy of one\r\nhe had sent to Governor Johnson, who would doubtless give me a copy;\r\nbut I insisted that I had made a written communication, and was\r\nentitled to a written answer.\r\n\r\nAt that moment several gentlemen of the \"Conciliation party,\" who\r\nhad come up in the same steamer with me, asked for admission and\r\ncame in.  I recall the names of Crockett, Foote, Bailey Peyton,\r\nJudge Thornton, Donohue, etc., and the conversation became general,\r\nWool trying to explain away the effect of our misunderstanding,\r\ntaking good pains not to deny his promise made to me personally on\r\nthe wharf.  I renewed my application for the letter addressed to\r\nme, then lying on his table.  On my statement of the case, Bailey\r\nPeyton said, \"General Wool, I think General Sherman has a right to\r\na written answer from you, for he is surely compromised.\"  Upon\r\nthis Wool handed me the letter.  I opened and read it, and it\r\ndenied any promise of arms, but otherwise was extremely evasive and\r\nnon-committal.  I had heard of the arrival at the wharf of the\r\nGovernor and party, and was expecting them at Wool's room, but,\r\ninstead of stopping at the hotel where we were, they passed to\r\nanother hotel on the block above.  I went up and found there, in a\r\nroom on the second floor over the bar-room, Governor Johnson,\r\nChief-Justice Terry, Jones, of Palmer, Cooke & Co., E. D. Baker,\r\nVolney E. Howard, and one or two others.  All were talking\r\nfuriously against Wool, denouncing him as a d---d liar, and not\r\nsparing the severest terms.  I showed the Governor General Wool's\r\nletter to me, which he said was in effect the same as the one\r\naddressed to and received by him at Sacramento.  He was so offended\r\nthat he would not even call on General Wool, and said he would\r\nnever again recognize him as an officer or gentleman.  We discussed\r\nmatters generally, and Judge Terry said that the Vigilance\r\nCommittee were a set of d---d pork-merchants; that they were\r\ngetting scared, and that General Wool was in collusion with them to\r\nbring the State into contempt, etc.  I explained that there were no\r\narms in the State except what General Wool had, or what were in the\r\nhands of the Vigilance Committee of San Francisco, and that the\r\npart of wisdom for us was to be patient and cautious.  About that\r\ntime Crockett and his associates sent up their cards, but Terry and\r\nthe more violent of the Governor's followers denounced them as no\r\nbetter than \"Vigilantes,\" and wanted the Governor to refuse even to\r\nreceive them.  I explained that they were not \"Vigilantes,\" that\r\nJudge Thornton was a \"Law-and-Order\" man, was one of the first to\r\nrespond to the call of the sheriff, and that he went actually to\r\nthe jail with his one arm the night we expected the first attempt\r\nat rescue, etc.  Johnson then sent word for them to reduce their\r\nbusiness to writing.  They simply sent in a written request for an\r\naudience, and they were then promptly admitted.  After some general\r\nconversation, the Governor said he was prepared to hear them, when\r\nMr. Crockett rose and made a prepared speech embracing a clear and\r\nfair statement of the condition of things in San Francisco,\r\nconcluding with the assertion of the willingness of the committee\r\nto disband and submit to trial after a certain date not very\r\nremote.  All the time Crockett was speaking, Terry sat with his hat\r\non, drawn over his eyes, and with his feet on a table.  As soon as\r\nCrockett was through, they were dismissed, and Johnson began to\r\nprepare a written answer.  This was scratched, altered, and\r\namended, to suit the notions of his counselors, and at last was\r\ncopied and sent.  This answer amounted to little or nothing.\r\nSeeing that we were powerless for good, and that violent counsels\r\nwould prevail under the influence of Terry and others, I sat down\r\nat the table, and wrote my resignation, which Johnson accepted in a\r\ncomplimentary note on the spot, and at the same time he appointed\r\nto my place General Volney E. Howard, then present, a lawyer who\r\nhad once been a member of Congress from Texas, and who was expected\r\nto drive the d---d pork-merchants into the bay at short notice.  I\r\nwent soon after to General Wool's room, where I found  Crockett and\r\nthe rest of his party; told them that I was out of the fight,\r\nhaving resigned my commission; that I had neglected business that\r\nhad been intrusted to me by my St. Louis partners; and that I would\r\nthenceforward mind my own business, and leave public affairs\r\nseverely alone.  We all returned to San Francisco that night by the\r\nStockton boat, and I never after-ward had any thing to do with\r\npolitics in California, perfectly satisfied with that short\r\nexperience.  Johnson and Wool fought  out their quarrel of veracity\r\nin the newspapers and on paper.  But, in my opinion, there is not a\r\nshadow of doubt that General Wool did deliberately deceive us; that\r\nhe had authority to issue arms, and that, had he adhered to his\r\npromise, we could have checked the committee before it became a\r\nfixed institution, and a part of the common law of California.\r\nMajor-General Volney  E. Howard came to San Francisco soon after;\r\ncontinued the organization of militia which I had begun; succeeded\r\nin getting a few arms from the country; but one day the Vigilance\r\nCommittee sallied from their armories, captured the arms of the\r\n\"Law-and-Order party,\" put some of their men into prison,  while\r\nGeneral Howard, with others, escaped to the country; after which\r\nthe Vigilance Committee had it all their own way.  Subsequently, in\r\nJuly, 1856, they arrested Chief-Justice Terry, and tried him for\r\nstabbing one of their constables, but he managed to escape at\r\nnight, and took refuge on the John Adams.  In August, they hanged\r\nHetherington and Brace in broad daylight, without any jury-trial;\r\nand, soon after, they quietly disbanded.  As they controlled the\r\npress, they wrote their own history, and the world generally gives\r\nthem the credit of having purged San Francisco of rowdies and\r\nroughs; but their success  has given great stimulus to a dangerous\r\nprinciple, that would at any time justify the mob in seizing all\r\nthe power of government;  and who is to say that the Vigilance\r\nCommittee may not be composed of the worst, instead of the best,\r\nelements of a community? Indeed, in San Francisco, as soon as it\r\nwas demonstrated that the real power had passed from the City Hall\r\nto the committee  room, the same set of bailiffs, constables, and\r\nrowdies that had infested the City Hall were found in the\r\nemployment of the  \"Vigilantes;\" and, after three months\r\nexperience, the better class of people became tired of the midnight\r\nsessions and left the business and power of the committee in the\r\nhands of a court, of which a Sydney man was reported to be the head\r\nor chief-justice.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1855-'56, and indeed throughout the year 1856,\r\nall kinds of business became unsettled in California.  The mines\r\ncontinued to yield about fifty millions of gold a year; but little\r\nattention was paid to agriculture or to any business other than\r\nthat of \"mining,\" and, as the placer-gold was becoming worked out,\r\nthe miners were restless and uneasy, and were shifting about from\r\nplace to place, impelled by rumors put afloat for speculative\r\npurposes.  A great many extensive enterprises by joint-stock\r\ncompanies had been begun, in the way of water-ditches, to bring\r\nwater from the head of the mountain-streams down to the richer\r\nalluvial deposits, and nearly all of these companies became\r\nembarrassed or bankrupt.  Foreign capital, also, which had been\r\nattracted to California by reason of the high rates of interest,\r\nwas being withdrawn, or was tied up in property which could not be\r\nsold; and, although our bank's having withstood the panic gave us\r\ngreat credit, still the community itself was shaken, and loans of\r\nmoney were risky in the extreme.  A great many merchants, of the\r\nhighest name, availed themselves of the extremely liberal bankrupt\r\nlaw to get discharged of their old debts, without sacrificing much,\r\nif any, of their stocks of goods on hand, except a lawyer's fee;\r\nthus realizing Martin Burke's saying that \"many a clever fellow had\r\nbeen ruined by paying his debts.\"  The merchants and business-men\r\nof San Francisco did not intend to be ruined by such a course.  I\r\nraised the rate of exchange from three to three and a half, while\r\nothers kept on at the old rate; and I labored hard to collect old\r\ndebts, and strove, in making new loans, to be on the safe side.\r\nThe State and city both denied much of their public debt; in fact,\r\nrepudiated it; and real estate, which the year before had been\r\nfirst-class security, became utterly unsalable.\r\n\r\nThe office labor and confinement, and the anxiety attending the\r\nbusiness, aggravated my asthma to such an extent that at times it\r\ndeprived me of sleep, and threatened to become chronic and serious;\r\nand I was also conscious that the first and original cause which\r\nhad induced Mr. Lucas to establish the bank in California had\r\nceased.  I so reported to him, and that I really believed that he\r\ncould use his money more safely and to better advantage in St.\r\nLouis.  This met his prompt approval, and he instructed me\r\ngradually to draw out, preparatory to a removal to New York City.\r\nAccordingly, early in April, 1857, I published an advertisement in\r\nthe San Francisco papers, notifying our customers that, on the 1st\r\nday of May, we would discontinue business and remove East,\r\nrequiring all to withdraw their accounts, and declaring that,\r\nif any remained on that day of May, their balances would be\r\ntransferred to the banking-house of Parrott & Co. Punctually to the\r\nday, this was done, and the business of Lucas, Turner & Co., of San\r\nFrancisco, was discontinued, except the more difficult and\r\ndisagreeable part of collecting their own moneys and selling the\r\nreal estate, to which the firm had succeeded by purchase or\r\nforeclosure.  One of the partners, B. R. Nisbet, assisted by our\r\nattorney, S. M. Bowman, Esq., remained behind to close up the\r\nbusiness of the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, AND KANSAS.\r\n\r\n1857-1859.\r\n\r\nHaving closed the bank at San Francisco on the 1st day of May,\r\n1857, accompanied by my family I embarked in the steamer Sonora for\r\nPanama, crossed the isthmus, and sailed to New York, whence we\r\nproceeded to Lancaster, Ohio, where Mrs. Sherman and the family\r\nstopped, and I went on to St. Louis.  I found there that some\r\nchanges had been made in the parent, house, that Mr. Lucas had\r\nbought out his partner, Captain Symonds, and that the firm's name\r\nhad been changed to that of James H. Lucas & Co.\r\n\r\nIt had also been arranged that an office or branch was to be\r\nestablished in New York City, of which I was to have charge, on\r\npretty much the same terms and conditions as in the previous San\r\nFrancisco firm.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucas, Major Turner, and I, agreed to meet in New York, soon\r\nafter the 4th of July.  We met accordingly at the Metropolitan\r\nHotel, selected an office, No. 12 Pall Street, purchased the\r\nnecessary furniture, and engaged a teller, bookkeeper, and porter.\r\nThe new firm was to bear the same title of Lucas, Turner & Co.,\r\nwith about the same partners in interest, but the nature of the\r\nbusiness was totally different.  We opened our office on the 21st\r\nof July, 1857, and at once began to receive accounts from the West\r\nand from California, but our chief business was as the resident\r\nagents of the St. Louis firm of James H. Lucas & Co. Personally I\r\ntook rooms at No. 100 Prince Street, in which house were also\r\nquartered Major J. G. Barnard, and Lieutenant J. B. McPherson,\r\nUnited States Engineers, both of whom afterward attained great fame\r\nin the civil war.\r\n\r\nMy business relations in New York were with the Metropolitan Bank\r\nand Bank of America; and with the very wealthy and most respectable\r\nfirm of Schuchhardt & Gebhard, of Nassau Street.  Every thing went\r\nalong swimmingly till the 21st of August, when all Wall Street was\r\nthrown into a spasm by the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust\r\nCompany, and the panic so resembled that in San Francisco, that,\r\nhaving nothing seemingly at stake, I felt amused.  But it soon\r\nbecame a serious matter even to me.  Western stocks and securities\r\ntumbled to such a figure, that all Western banks that held such\r\nsecurities, and had procured advances thereon, were compelled to\r\npay up or substitute increased collaterals.  Our own house was\r\nnot a borrower in New York at all, but many of our Western\r\ncorrespondents were, and it taxed my tune to watch their interests.\r\nIn September, the panic extended so as to threaten the safety of\r\neven some of the New York banks not connected with the West; and\r\nthe alarm became general, and at last universal.\r\n\r\nIn the very midst of this panic came the news that the steamer\r\nCentral America, formerly the George Law, with six hundred\r\npassengers and about sixteen hundred thousand dollars of treasure,\r\ncoming from Aspinwall, had foundered at sea, off the coast of\r\nGeorgia, and that about sixty of the passengers had been\r\nprovidentially picked up by a Swedish bark, and brought into\r\nSavannah.  The absolute loss of this treasure went to swell the\r\nconfusion and panic of the day.\r\n\r\nA few days after, I was standing in the vestibule of the\r\nMetropolitan Hotel, and heard the captain of the Swedish bark tell\r\nhis singular story of the rescue of these passengers.  He was a\r\nshort, sailor-like-looking man, with a strong German or Swedish\r\naccent.  He said that he was sailing from some port in Honduras for\r\nSweden, running down the Gulf Stream off Savannah.  The weather had\r\nbeen heavy for some days, and, about nightfall, as he paced his\r\ndeck, he observed a man-of-war hawk circle about his vessel,\r\ngradually lowering, until the bird was as it were aiming at him.\r\nHe jerked out a belaying-pin, struck at the bird, missed it, when\r\nthe hawk again rose high in the air, and a second time began to\r\ndescend, contract his circle, and make at him again.  The second\r\ntime he hit the bird, and struck it to the deck....  This strange\r\nfact made him uneasy, and he thought it betokened danger; he went\r\nto the binnacle, saw the course he was steering, and without any\r\nparticular reason he ordered the steersman to alter the course one\r\npoint to the east.\r\n\r\nAfter this it became quite dark, and he continued to promenade the\r\ndeck, and had settled into a drowsy state, when as in a dream he\r\nthought he heard voices all round his ship.  Waking up, he ran to\r\nthe side of the ship, saw something struggling in the water, and\r\nheard clearly cries for help.  Instantly heaving his ship to, and\r\nlowering all his boats, he managed to pick up sixty or more persons\r\nwho were floating about on skylights, doors, spare, and whatever\r\nfragments remained of the Central America.  Had he not changed the\r\ncourse of his vessel by reason of the mysterious conduct of that\r\nman-of-war hawk, not a soul would probably have survived the night.\r\nIt was stated by the rescued passengers, among whom was Billy\r\nBirch, that the Central America had sailed from Aspinwall with the\r\npassengers and freight which left San Francisco on the 1st of\r\nSeptember, and encountered the gale in the Gulf Stream somewhere\r\noff Savannah, in which she sprung a leak, filled rapidly, and went\r\ndown.  The passengers who were saved had clung to doors, skylights,\r\nand such floating objects as they could reach, and were thus\r\nrescued; all the rest, some five hundred in number, had gone down\r\nwith the ship.\r\n\r\nThe panic grew worse and worse, and about the end of September\r\nthere was a general suspension of the banks of New York, and a\r\nmoney crisis extended all over the country.  In New York, Lucas,\r\nTurner & Co. had nothing at risk.  We had large cash balances in\r\nthe Metropolitan Bank and in the Bank of America, all safe, and we\r\nheld, for the account of the St. Louis house, at least two hundred\r\nthousand dollars, of St. Louis city and county bonds, and of\r\nacceptances falling due right along, none extending beyond ninety\r\ndays.  I was advised from St. Louis that money matters were\r\nextremely tight; but I did not dream of any danger in that quarter.\r\nI knew well that Mr. Lucas was worth two or three million dollars\r\nin the best real estate, and inferred from the large balances to\r\ntheir credit with me that no mere panic could shake his credit;\r\nbut, early on the morning of October 7th, my cousin, James M. Hoyt,\r\ncame to me in bed, and read me a paragraph in the morning paper, to\r\nthe effect that James H. Lucas & Co., of St. Louis, had suspended.\r\nI was, of course, surprised, but not sorry; for I had always\r\ncontended that a man of so much visible wealth as Mr. Lucas should\r\nnot be engaged in a business subject to such vicissitudes.  I\r\nhurried down to the office, where I received the same information\r\nofficially, by telegraph, with instructions to make proper\r\ndisposition of the affairs of the bank, and to come out to St.\r\nLouis, with such assets as would be available there.  I transferred\r\nthe funds belonging to all our correspondents, with lists of\r\noutstanding checks, to one or other of our bankers, and with the\r\ncash balance of the St. Louis house and their available assets\r\nstarted for St. Louis.  I may say with confidence that no man lost\r\na cent by either of the banking firms of Lucas, Turner & Co., of\r\nSan Francisco or New York; but, as usual, those who owed us were\r\nnot always as just.  I reached St. Louis October 17th, and found\r\nthe partners engaged in liquidating the balances due depositors as\r\nfast as collections could be forced; and, as the panic began to\r\nsubside, this process became quite rapid, and Mr. Lucas, by making\r\na loan in Philadelphia, was enabled to close out all accounts\r\nwithout having made any serious sacrifices, Of course, no person\r\never lost a cent by him: he has recently died, leaving an estate of\r\neight million dollars.  During his lifetime, I had opportunities to\r\nknow him well, and take much pleasure in bearing testimony to his\r\ngreat worth and personal kindness.  On the failure of his bank, he\r\nassumed personally all the liabilities, released his partners of\r\nall responsibility, and offered to assist me to engage in business,\r\nwhich he supposed was due to me because I had resigned my army\r\ncommission.  I remained in St. Louis till the 17th of December,\r\n1857, assisting in collecting for the bank, and in controlling all\r\nmatters which came from the New York and San Francisco branches.\r\nB. R. Nisbet was still in San Francisco, but had married a Miss\r\nThornton, and was coming home.  There still remained in California\r\na good deal of real estate, and notes, valued at about two hundred\r\nthousand dollars in the aggregate; so that, at Mr. Lucas's request,\r\nI agreed to go out again, to bring matters, if possible, nearer a\r\nfinal settlement.  I accordingly left St. Louis, reached Lancaster,\r\nwhere my family was, on the 10th, staid there till after Christmas,\r\nand then went to New York, where I remained till January 5th, when\r\nI embarked on the steamer Moles Taylor (Captain McGowan) for\r\nAspinwall; caught the Golden Gate (Captain Whiting) at Panama,\r\nJanuary 15, 1858; and reached San Francisco on the 28th of January.\r\nI found that Nisbet and wife had gone to St. Louis, and that we had\r\npassed each other at sea.  He had carried the ledger and books to\r\nSt. Louis, but left a schedule, notes, etc., in the hands of S. M.\r\nBowman, Esq., who passed them over to me.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January I published a notice of the dissolution of\r\nthe partnership, and called on all who were still indebted to the\r\nfirm of Lucas, Turner & Co. to pay up, or the notes would be sold\r\nat auction.  I also advertised that all the real property, was for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nBusiness had somewhat changed since 1857.  Parrott & Co.; Garrison,\r\nFritz & Ralston; Wells, Fargo & Co.; Drexel, Sather & Church, and\r\nTallant & Wilde, were the principal bankers.  Property continued\r\nalmost unsalable, and prices were less than a half of what they\r\nhad been in 1853-'54.  William Blending, Esq., had rented my house\r\non Harrison Street; so I occupied a room in the bank, No. 11, and\r\nboarded at the Meiggs House, corner of Broadway and Montgomery,\r\nwhich we owned.  Having reduced expenses to a minimum, I proceeded,\r\nwith all possible dispatch, to collect outstanding debts, in some\r\ninstances making sacrifices and compromises.  I made some few\r\nsales, and generally aimed to put matters in such a shape that time\r\nwould bring the best result.  Some of our heaviest creditors were\r\nJohn M. Rhodes & Co., of Sacramento and Shasta; Langton & Co., of\r\nDownieville; and E. M. Stranger of Murphy's.  In trying to put\r\nthese debts in course of settlement, I made some arrangement in\r\nDownieville with the law-firm of Spears & Thornton, to collect, by\r\nsuit, a certain note of Green & Purdy for twelve thousand dollars.\r\nEarly in April, I learned that Spears had collected three thousand\r\nseven hundred dollars in money, had appropriated it to his own use,\r\nand had pledged another good note taken in part payment of three\r\nthousand and fifty-three dollars.  He pretended to be insane.  I\r\nhad to make two visits to Downieville on this business, and there,\r\nmade the acquaintance of Mr. Stewart, now a Senator from Nevada.\r\nHe was married to a daughter of Governor Foote; was living in a\r\nsmall frame house on the bar just below the town; and his little\r\ndaughter was playing about the door in the sand.  Stewart was then\r\na lawyer in Downieville, in good practice; afterward, by some lucky\r\nstroke, became part owner of a valuable silver-mine in Nevada, and\r\nis now accounted a millionaire.  I managed to save something out of\r\nSpears, and more out of his partner Thornton.  This affair of\r\nSpears ruined him, because his insanity was manifestly feigned.\r\n\r\nI remained in San Francisco till July 3d, when, having collected\r\nand remitted every cent that I could raise, and got all the\r\nproperty in the best shape possible, hearing from St. Louis\r\nthat business had revived, and that there was no need of\r\nfurther sacrifice; I put all the papers, with a full letter of\r\ninstructions, and power of attorney, in the hands of William\r\nBlending, Esq., and took passage on the good steamer Golden Gate,\r\nCaptain Whiting, for Panama and home.  I reached Lancaster on July\r\n28, 1858, and found all the family well.  I was then perfectly\r\nunhampered, but the serious and greater question remained, what was\r\nI to do to support my family, consisting of a wife and four\r\nchildren, all accustomed to more than the average comforts of life?\r\n\r\nI remained at Lancaster all of August, 1858, during which time I\r\nwas discussing with Mr. Ewing and others what to do next.  Major\r\nTurner and Mr. Lucas, in St. Louis, were willing to do any thing to\r\naid me, but I thought best to keep independent.  Mr. Ewing had\r\nproperty at Chauncey, consisting of salt-wells and coal-mines, but\r\nfor that part of Ohio I had no fancy.  Two of his sons, Hugh and T.\r\nE., Jr., had established themselves at Leavenworth, Kansas, where\r\nthey and their father had bought a good deal of land, some near the\r\ntown, and some back in the country.  Mr. Ewing offered to confide\r\nto me the general management of his share of interest, and Hugh and\r\nT. E., Jr., offered me an equal copartnership in their law-firm.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, about the 1st of September, I started for Kansas,\r\nstopping a couple of weeks in St. Louis, and reached Leavenworth.\r\nI found about two miles below the fort, on the river-bank, where in\r\n1851 was a tangled thicket, quite a handsome and thriving city,\r\ngrowing rapidly in rivalry with Kansas City, and St. Joseph,\r\nMissouri.  After looking about and consulting with friends, among\r\nthem my classmate Major Stewart Van Vliet, quartermaster at the\r\nfort, I concluded to accept the proposition of Mr. Ewing, and\r\naccordingly the firm of Sherman & Ewing was duly announced, and our\r\nservices to the public offered as attorneys-at-law.  We had an\r\noffice on Main Street, between Shawnee and Delaware, on the second\r\nfloor, over the office of Hampton Denman, Esq., mayor of the city.\r\nThis building was a mere shell, and our office was reached by a\r\nstairway on the outside.  Although in the course of my military\r\nreading I had studied a few of the ordinary law-books, such as\r\nBlackstone, Kent, Starkie, etc., I did not presume to be a lawyer;\r\nbut our agreement was that Thomas Ewing, Jr., a good and thorough\r\nlawyer, should manage all business in the courts, while I gave\r\nattention to collections, agencies for houses and lands, and such\r\nbusiness as my experience in banking had qualified me for.  Yet, as\r\nmy name was embraced in a law-firm, it seemed to me proper to take\r\nout a license.  Accordingly, one day when United States Judge\r\nLecompte was in our office, I mentioned the matter to him; he told\r\nme to go down to the clerk of his court, and he would give me the\r\nlicense.  I inquired what examination I would have to submit to,\r\nand he replied, \"None at all;\" he would admit me on the ground of\r\ngeneral intelligence.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer we got our share of the business of the\r\nprofession, then represented by several eminent law-firms,\r\nembracing names that have since flourished in the Senate, and in\r\nthe higher courts of the country.  But the most lucrative single\r\ncase was given me by my friend Major Van Vliet, who employed me to\r\ngo to Fort Riley, one hundred and thirty-six miles west of Fort\r\nLeavenworth, to superintend the repairs to the military road.  For\r\nthis purpose he supplied me with a four-mule ambulance and driver.\r\nThe country was then sparsely settled, and quite as many Indians\r\nwere along the road as white people; still there were embryo towns\r\nall along the route, and a few farms sprinkled over the beautiful\r\nprairies.  On reaching Indianola, near Topeka, I found everybody\r\ndown with the chills and fever.  My own driver became so shaky that\r\nI had to act as driver and cook.  But in due season I reconnoitred\r\nthe road, and made contracts for repairing some bridges, and for\r\ncutting such parts of the road as needed it.  I then returned to\r\nFort Leavenworth, and reported, receiving a fair compensation.  On\r\nmy way up I met Colonel Sumner's column, returning from their\r\nsummer scout on the plains, and spent the night with the officers,\r\namong whom were Captains Sackett, Sturgis, etc.  Also at Fort Riley\r\nI was cordially received and entertained by some old army-friends,\r\namong them Major Sedgwick, Captains Totted, Eli Long, etc.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sherman and children arrived out in November, and we spent the\r\nwinter very comfortably in the house of Thomas Ewing, Jr., on the\r\ncorner of Third and Pottawottamie Streets.  On the 1st of January,\r\n1859, Daniel McCook, Esq., was admitted to membership in our firm,\r\nwhich became Sherman, Ewing & McCook.  Our business continued to\r\ngrow, but, as the income hardly sufficed for three such expensive\r\npersonages, I continued to look about for something more certain\r\nand profitable, and during that spring undertook for the Hon.\r\nThomas Ewing, of Ohio, to open a farm on a large tract of land he\r\nowned on Indian Creek, forty miles west of Leavenworth, for the\r\nbenefit of his grand-nephew, Henry Clark, and his grand-niece, Mrs.\r\nWalker.  These arrived out in the spring, by which time I had\r\ncaused to be erected a small frame dwelling-house, a barn, and\r\nfencing for a hundred acres.  This helped to pass away time, but\r\nafforded little profit; and on the 11th of June, 1859, I wrote to\r\nMajor D. C. Buel, assistant adjutant-general, on duty in the War\r\nDepartment with Secretary of War Floyd, inquiring if there was a\r\nvacancy among the army paymasters, or any thing in his line that I\r\ncould obtain.  He replied promptly, and sent me the printed\r\nprogramme for a military college about to be organized in\r\nLouisiana, and advised me to apply for the superintendent's place,\r\nsaying that General G. Mason Graham, the half-brother of my old\r\ncommanding-general, R. B. Mason, was very influential in this\r\nmatter, and would doubtless befriend me on account of the relations\r\nthat had existed between General Mason and myself in California.\r\nAccordingly, I addressed a letter of application to the Hon. R. C.\r\nWickliffe, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, asking the answer to be sent to\r\nme at Lancaster, Ohio, where I proposed to leave my family.  But,\r\nbefore leaving this branch of the subject, I must explain a little\r\nmatter of which I have seen an account in print, complimentary or\r\notherwise of the firm of Sherman, Ewing & McCook, more especially\r\nof the senior partner.\r\n\r\nOne day, as I sat in our office, an Irishman came in and said he\r\nhad a case and wanted a lawyer.  I asked him to sit down and give\r\nme the points of his case, all the other members of the firm being\r\nout.  Our client stated that he had rented a lot of an Irish\r\nlandlord for five dollars a month; that he had erected thereon a\r\nsmall frame shanty, which was occupied by his family; that he had,\r\npaid his rent regularly up to a recent period, but to his house he\r\nhad appended a shed which extended over a part of an adjoining\r\nvacant lot belonging to the same landlord, for which he was charged\r\ntwo and a half dollars a month, which he refused to pay.  The\r\nconsequence was, that his landlord had for a few months declined\r\neven his five dollars monthly rent until the arrears amounted to\r\nabout seventeen dollars, for which he was sued.  I told him we\r\nwould undertake his case, of which I took notes, and a fee of five\r\ndollars in advance, and in due order I placed the notes in the\r\nhands of McCook, and thought no more of it.\r\n\r\nA month or so after, our client rushed into the office and said his\r\ncase had been called at Judge Gardner's (I think), and he wanted\r\nhis lawyer right away.  I sent him up to the Circuit Court, Judge\r\nPettit's, for McCook, but he soon returned, saying he could not\r\nfind McCook, and accordingly I hurried with him up to Judge\r\nGardner's office, intending to ask a continuance, but I found our\r\nantagonist there, with his lawyer and witnesses, and Judge Gardner\r\nwould not grant a continuance, so of necessity I had to act, hoping\r\nthat at every minute McCook would come.  But the trial proceeded\r\nregularly to its end; we were beaten, and judgment was entered\r\nagainst our client for the amount claimed, and costs.  As soon as\r\nthe matter was explained to McCook, he said \"execution\" could not\r\nbe taken for ten days, and, as our client was poor, and had nothing\r\non which the landlord could levy but his house, McCook advised him\r\nto get his neighbors together, to pick up the house, and carry it\r\non to another vacant lot, belonging to a non-resident, so that even\r\nthe house could not be taken in execution.  Thus the grasping\r\nlandlord, though successful in his judgment, failed in the\r\nexecution, and our client was abundantly satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn due time I closed up my business at Leavenworth, and went to\r\nLancaster, Ohio, where, in July, 1859, I received notice from\r\nGovernor Wickliffe that I had been elected superintendent of the\r\nproposed college, and inviting me to come down to Louisiana as\r\nearly as possible, because they were anxious to put the college\r\ninto operation by the 1st of January following.  For this honorable\r\nposition I was indebted to Major D. C. Buell and General G. Mason\r\nGraham, to whom I have made full and due acknowledgment.  During\r\nthe civil war, it was reported and charged that I owed my position\r\nto the personal friendship of Generals Bragg and Beauregard, and\r\nthat, in taking up arms against the South, I had been guilty of a\r\nbreach of hospitality and friendship.  I was not indebted to\r\nGeneral Bragg, because he himself told me that he was not even\r\naware that I was an applicant, and had favored the selection of\r\nMajor Jenkins, another West Point graduate.  General Beauregard had\r\nnothing whatever to do with the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA\r\n\r\n1859-1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1859, having made arrangements for my family to\r\nremain in Lancaster, I proceeded, via Columbus, Cincinnati, and\r\nLouisville, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where I reported for duty to\r\nGovernor Wickliffe, who, by virtue of his office, was the president\r\nof the Board of Supervisors of the new institution over which I was\r\ncalled to preside.  He explained to me the act of the Legislature\r\nunder which the institution was founded; told me that the building\r\nwas situated near Alexandria, in the parish of Rapides, and was\r\nsubstantially finished; that the future management would rest with\r\na Board of Supervisors, mostly citizens of Rapides Parish, where\r\nalso resided the Governor-elect, T. O. Moore, who would soon\r\nsucceed him in his office as Governor and president ex officio; and\r\nadvised me to go at once to Alexandria, and put myself in\r\ncommunication with Moore and the supervisors.  Accordingly I took a\r\nboat at Baton Rouge, for the mouth of Red River.\r\n\r\nThe river being low, and its navigation precarious, I there took\r\nthe regular mail-coach, as the more certain conveyance, and\r\ncontinued on toward Alexandria.  I found, as a fellow-passenger in\r\nthe coach, Judge Henry Boyce, of the United States District Court,\r\nwith whom I had made acquaintance years before, at St. Louis, and,\r\nas we neared Alexandria, he proposed that we should stop at\r\nGovernor Moore's and spend the night.  Moore's house and plantation\r\nwere on Bayou Robert, about eight miles from Alexandria.  We found\r\nhim at home, with his wife and a married daughter, and spent the\r\nnight there.  He sent us forward to Alexandria the next morning, in\r\nhis own carriage.  On arriving at Alexandria, I put up at an inn,\r\nor boarding-house, and almost immediately thereafter went about ten\r\nmiles farther up Bayou Rapides, to the plantation and house of\r\nGeneral G. Mason Graham, to whom I looked as the principal man with\r\nwhom I had to deal.  He was a high-toned gentleman, and his whole\r\nheart was in the enterprise.  He at once put me at ease.  We acted\r\ntogether most cordially from that time forth, and it was at his\r\nhouse that all the details of the seminary were arranged.  We first\r\nvisited the college-building together.  It was located on an old\r\ncountry place of four hundred acres of pineland, with numerous\r\nsprings, and the building was very large and handsome.  A\r\ncarpenter, named James, resided there, and had the general charge\r\nof the property; but, as there was not a table, chair, black-board,\r\nor any thing on hand, necessary for a beginning, I concluded to\r\nquarter myself in one of the rooms of the seminary, and board with\r\nan old black woman who cooked for James, so that I might personally\r\npush forward the necessary preparations.  There was an old\r\nrail-fence about the place, and a large pile of boards in front.  I\r\nimmediately engaged four carpenters, and set them at work to make\r\nout of these boards mess-tables, benches, black-boards, etc.  I\r\nalso opened a correspondence with the professors-elect, and with\r\nall parties of influence in the State, who were interested in our\r\nwork: At the meeting of the Board of Supervisors, held at\r\nAlexandria, August 2, 1859, five professors had been elected:\r\n1.  W. T. Sherman, Superintendent, and Professor of Engineering, etc.;\r\n2.  Anthony Vallas, Professor of Mathematics, Philosophy, etc.;\r\n3.  Francis W. Smith, Professor of Chemistry, etc.;\r\n4.  David F. Boyd, Professor of Languages, English and Ancient;\r\n5.  E. Berti St. Ange, Professor of French and Modern Languages.\r\n\r\nThese constituted the Academic Board, while the general supervision\r\nremained in the Board of Supervisors, composed of the Governor of\r\nthe State, the Superintendent of Public Education, and twelve\r\nmembers, nominated by the Governor, and confirmed by the Senate.\r\nThe institution was bound to educate sixteen beneficiary students,\r\nfree of any charge for tuition.  These had only to pay for their\r\nclothing and books, while all others had to pay their entire\r\nexpenses, including tuition.\r\n\r\nEarly in November, Profs.  Smith, Yallas, St. Ange, and I, met a\r\ncommittee of the Board of Supervisors, composed of T. C. Manning,\r\nG. Mason Graham, and W. W. Whittington, at General Graham's house,\r\nand resolved to open the institution to pupils on the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1860.  We adopted a series of bylaws for the government of\r\nthe institution, which was styled the \"Louisiana Seminary of\r\nLearning and Military Academy.\"  This title grew out of the\r\noriginal grant, by the Congress of the United States, of a certain\r\ntownship of public land, to be sold by the State, and dedicated to\r\nthe use of a \"seminary of learning.\"  I do not suppose that\r\nCongress designed thereby to fix the name or title; but the subject\r\nhad so long been debated in Louisiana that the name, though\r\nawkward, had become familiar.  We appended to it \"Military\r\nAcademy,\" as explanatory of its general design.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of November, 1859, the Governor of the State,\r\nWickliffe, issued officially a general circular, prepared by us,\r\ngiving public notice that the \"Seminary of Learning\" would open on\r\nthe 1st day of January, 1860; containing a description of the\r\nlocality, and the general regulations for the proposed institution;\r\nand authorizing parties to apply for further information to the\r\n\"Superintendent,\" at Alexandria, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature had appropriated for the sixteen beneficiaries at\r\nthe rate of two hundred and eighty-three dollars per annum, to\r\nwhich we added sixty dollars as tuition for pay cadets; and, though\r\nthe price was low, we undertook to manage for the first year on\r\nthat basis.\r\n\r\nPromptly to the day, we opened, with about sixty cadets present.\r\nMajor Smith was the commandant of cadets, and I the superintendent.\r\nI had been to New Orleans, where I had bought a supply of\r\nmattresses, books, and every thing requisite, and we started very\r\nmuch on the basis of West Point and of the Virginia Military\r\nInstitute, but without uniforms or muskets; yet with roll-calls,\r\nsections, and recitations, we kept as near the standard of West\r\nPoint as possible.  I kept all the money accounts, and gave general\r\ndirections to the steward, professors, and cadets.  The other\r\nprofessors had their regular classes and recitations.  We all lived\r\nin rooms in the college building, except Vallas, who had a family,\r\nand rented a house near by.  A Creole gentleman, B. Jarrean, Esq.,\r\nhad been elected steward, and he also had his family in a house not\r\nfar off.  The other professors had a mess in a room adjoining the\r\nmess-hall.  A few more cadets joined in the course of the winter,\r\nso that we had in all, during the first term, seventy-three cadets,\r\nof whom fifty-nine passed the examination on the 30th of July,\r\n1860.  During our first term many defects in the original act of\r\nthe Legislature were demonstrated, and, by the advice of the Board\r\nof Supervisors, I went down to Baton Rouge during the session of\r\nthe Legislature, to advocate and urge the passage of a new bill,\r\nputting the institution on a better footing.  Thomas O. Moors was\r\nthen Governor, Bragg was a member of the Board of Public Works, and\r\nRichard Taylor was a Senator.  I got well acquainted with all of\r\nthese, and with some of the leading men of the State, and was\r\nalways treated with the greatest courtesy and kindness.  In\r\nconjunction with the proper committee of the Legislature, we\r\nprepared a new bill, which was passed and approved on the 7th of\r\nMarch, 1860, by which we were to have a beneficiary cadet for each\r\nparish, in all fifty-six, and fifteen thousand dollars annually for\r\ntheir maintenance; also twenty thousand dollars for the general use\r\nof the college.  During that session we got an appropriation of\r\nfifteen thousand dollars for building two professors' houses, for\r\nthe purchase of philosophical and chemical apparatus, and for the\r\nbeginning of a college library.  The seminary was made a State\r\nArsenal, under the title of State Central Arsenal, and I was\r\nallowed five hundred dollars a year as its superintendent.  These\r\nmatters took me several times to Baton Rouge that winter, and I\r\nrecall an event of some interest, which most have happened in\r\nFebruary.  At that time my brother, John Sherman, was a candidate,\r\nin the national House of Representatives, for Speaker, against\r\nBocock, of Virginia.  In the South he was regarded as an\r\n\"abolitionist,\" the most horrible of all monsters; and many people\r\nof Louisiana looked at me with suspicion, as the brother of the\r\nabolitionist, John Sherman, and doubted the propriety of having me\r\nat the head of an important State institution.  By this time I was\r\npretty well acquainted with many of their prominent men, was\r\ngenerally esteemed by all in authority, and by the people of\r\nRapides Parish especially, who saw that I was devoted to my\r\nparticular business, and that I gave no heed to the political\r\nexcitement of the day.  But the members of the State Senate and\r\nHouse did not know me so well, and it was natural that they should\r\nbe suspicions of a Northern man, and the brother of him who was the\r\n\"abolition\" candidate for Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\nOne evening, at a large dinner-party at Governor Moore's, at which\r\nwere present several members of the Louisiana Legislature, Taylor,\r\nBragg, and the Attorney-General Hyams, after the ladies had left\r\nthe table, I noticed at Governor Moore's end quite a lively\r\ndiscussion going on, in which my name was frequently used; at\r\nlength the Governor called to me, saying: \"Colonel Sherman, you can\r\nreadily understand that, with your brother the abolitionist\r\ncandidate for Speaker, some of our people wonder that you should be\r\nhere at the head of an important State institution.  Now, you are\r\nat my table, and I assure you of my confidence.  Won't you speak\r\nyour mind freely on this question of slavery, that so agitates the\r\nland? You are under my roof, and, whatever you say, you have my\r\nprotection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI answered: \"Governor Moors, you mistake in calling my brother,\r\nJohn Sherman, an abolitionist.  We have been separated since\r\nchildhood--I in the army, and he pursuing his profession of\r\nlaw in Northern Ohio; and it is possible we may differ in\r\ngeneral sentiment, but I deny that he is considered at home an\r\nabolitionist; and, although he prefers the free institutions under\r\nwhich he lives to those of slavery which prevail here, he would not\r\nof himself take from you by law or force any property whatever,\r\neven slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThen said Moore: \"Give us your own views of slavery as you see it\r\nhere and throughout the South.\"\r\n\r\nI answered in effect that \"the people of Louisiana were hardly\r\nresponsible for slavery, as they had inherited it; that I found two\r\ndistinct conditions of slavery, domestic and field hands.  The\r\ndomestic slaves, employed by the families, were probably better\r\ntreated than any slaves on earth; but the condition of the\r\nfield-hands was different, depending more on the temper and\r\ndisposition of their masters and overseers than were those employed\r\nabout the house;\" and I went on to say that, \"were I a citizen of\r\nLouisiana, and a member of the Legislature, I would deem it wise to\r\nbring the legal condition of the slaves more near the status of\r\nhuman beings under all Christian and civilized governments.  In the\r\nfirst place, I argued that, in sales of slaves made by the State, I\r\nwould forbid the separation of families, letting the father,\r\nmother, and children, be sold together to one person, instead of\r\neach to the highest bidder.  And, again, I would advise the repeal\r\nof the statute which enacted a severe penalty for even the owner to\r\nteach his slave to read and write, because that actually qualified\r\nproperty and took away a part of its value; illustrating the\r\nassertion by the case of Henry Sampson, who had been the slave of\r\nColonel Chambers, of Rapides Parish, who had gone to California as\r\nthe servant of an officer of the army, and who was afterward\r\nemployed by me in the bank at San Francisco.  At first he could not\r\nwrite or read, and I could only afford to pay him one hundred\r\ndollars a month; but he was taught to read and write by Reilley,\r\nour bank-teller, when his services became worth two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars a month, which enabled him to buy his own freedom and\r\nthat of his brother and his family.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I said was listened to by all with the most profound\r\nattention; and, when I was through, some one (I think it was Mr.\r\nHyams) struck the table with his fist, making the glasses jingle,\r\nand said, \"By God, he is right!\" and at once he took up the debate,\r\nwhich went on, for an hour or more, on both sides with ability and\r\nfairness.  Of course, I was glad to be thus relieved, because at\r\nthe time all men in Louisiana were dreadfully excited on questions\r\naffecting their slaves, who constituted the bulk of their wealth,\r\nand without whom they honestly believed that sugar, cotton, and\r\nrice, could not possibly be cultivated.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th and 31st of July, 1860, we had an examination at the\r\nseminary, winding up with a ball, and as much publicity as possible\r\nto attract general notice; and immediately thereafter we all\r\nscattered--the cadets to their homes, and the professors wherever\r\nthey pleased--all to meet again on the 1st day of the next\r\nNovember.  Major Smith and I agreed to meet in New York on a\r\ncertain day in August, to purchase books, models, etc.  I went\r\ndirectly to my family in Lancaster, and after a few days proceeded\r\nto Washington, to endeavor to procure from the General Government\r\nthe necessary muskets and equipments for our cadets by the\r\nbeginning of the next term.  I was in Washington on the 17th\r\nday of August, and hunted up my friend Major Buell, of the\r\nAdjutant-General's Department, who was on duty with the Secretary of\r\nWar, Floyd.  I had with me a letter of Governor Moore's, authorizing\r\nme to act in his name.  Major Buell took me into Floyd's room at the\r\nWar Department, to whom I explained my business, and I was agreeably\r\nsurprised to meet with such easy success.  Although the State of\r\nLouisiana had already drawn her full quota of arms, Floyd promptly\r\npromised to order my requisition to be filled, and I procured the\r\nnecessary blanks at the Ordnance-Office, filled them with two\r\nhundred cadet muskets, and all equipments complete, and was assured\r\nthat all these articles would be shipped to Louisiana in season for\r\nour use that fall.  These assurances were faithfully carried out.\r\n\r\nI then went on to New York, there met Major Smith according to\r\nappointment, and together we selected and purchased a good supply\r\nof uniforms, clothing, and text books, as well as a fair number of\r\nbooks of history and fiction, to commence a library.\r\n\r\nWhen this business was completed, I returned to Lancaster, and\r\nremained with my family till the time approached for me to return\r\nto Louisiana.  I again left my family at Lancaster, until assured\r\nof the completion of the two buildings designed for the married\r\nprofessors for which I had contracted that spring with Mr. Mills,\r\nof Alexandria, and which were well under progress when I left in\r\nAugust.  One of these was designed for me and the other for Vallas.\r\nMr. Ewing presented me with a horse, which I took down the river\r\nwith me, and en route I ordered from Grimsley & Co. a full\r\nequipment of saddle, bridle, etc., the same that I used in the war,\r\nand which I lost with my horse, shot under me at Shiloh.\r\n\r\nReaching Alexandria early in October, I pushed forward the\r\nconstruction of the two buildings, some fences, gates, and all\r\nother work, with the object of a more perfect start at the opening\r\nof the regular term November 1, 1860.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Dr. Powhatan Clark was elected Assistant Professor\r\nof Chemistry, etc., and acted as secretary of the Board of\r\nSupervisors, but no other changes were made in our small circle of\r\nprofessors.\r\n\r\nNovember came, and with it nearly if not quite all our first set of\r\ncadets, and others, to the number of about one hundred and thirty.\r\nWe divided them into two companies, issued arms and clothing, and\r\nbegan a regular system of drills and instruction, as well as the\r\nregular recitations.  I had moved into my new house, but prudently\r\nhad not sent for my family, nominally on the ground of waiting\r\nuntil the season was further advanced, but really because of the\r\nstorm that was lowering heavy on the political horizon.  The\r\npresidential election was to occur in November, and the nominations\r\nhad already been made in stormy debates by the usual conventions.\r\nLincoln and Hamlin (to the South utterly unknown) were the nominees\r\nof the Republican party, and for the first time both these\r\ncandidates were from Northern States.  The Democratic party\r\ndivided--one set nominating a ticket at Charleston, and the other\r\nat Baltimore.  Breckenridge and Lane were the nominees of the\r\nSouthern or Democratic party; and Bell and Everett, a kind of\r\ncompromise, mostly in favor in Louisiana.  Political excitement was\r\nat its very height, and it was constantly asserted that Mr.\r\nLincoln's election would imperil the Union.  I purposely kept aloof\r\nfrom politics, would take no part, and remember that on the day of\r\nthe election in November I was notified that it would be advisable\r\nfor me to vote for Bell and Everett, but I openly said I would not,\r\nand I did not.  The election of Mr. Lincoln fell upon us all like a\r\nclap of thunder.  People saw and felt that the South had threatened\r\nso long that, if she quietly submitted, the question of slavery in\r\nthe Territories was at an end forever.  I mingled freely with the\r\nmembers of the Board of Supervisors, and with the people of Rapides\r\nParish generally, keeping aloof from all cliques and parties, and I\r\ncertainly hoped that the threatened storm would blow over, as had\r\nso often occurred before, after similar threats.  At our seminary\r\nthe order of exercises went along with the regularity of the\r\nseasons.  Once a week, I had the older cadets to practise reading,\r\nreciting, and elocution, and noticed that their selections were\r\nfrom Calhoun, Yancey, and other Southern speakers, all treating of\r\nthe defense of their slaves and their home institutions as the very\r\nhighest duty of the patriot.  Among boys this was to be expected;\r\nand among the members of our board, though most of them declaimed\r\nagainst politicians generally, and especially abolitionists, as\r\npests, yet there was a growing feeling that danger was in the wind.\r\nI recall the visit of a young gentleman who had been sent from\r\nJackson, by the Governor of Mississippi, to confer with Governor\r\nMoore, then on his plantation at Bayou Robert, and who had come\r\nover to see our college.  He spoke to me openly of secession as a\r\nfixed fact, and that its details were only left open for\r\ndiscussion.  I also recall the visit of some man who was said to be\r\na high officer in the order of \"Knights of the Golden Circle,\" of\r\nthe existence of which order I was even ignorant, until explained\r\nto me by Major Smith and Dr. Clark.  But in November, 1860, no man\r\never approached me offensively, to ascertain my views, or my\r\nproposed course of action in case of secession, and no man in or\r\nout of authority ever tried to induce me to take part in steps\r\ndesigned to lead toward disunion.  I think my general opinions were\r\nwell known and understood, viz., that \"secession was treason, was\r\nwar;\" and that in no event would the North and West permit the\r\nMississippi River to pass out of their control.  But some men at\r\nthe South actually supposed at the time that the Northwestern\r\nStates, in case of a disruption of the General Government, would be\r\ndrawn in self-interest to an alliance with the South.  What I now\r\nwrite I do not offer as any thing like a history of the important\r\nevents of that time, but rather as my memory of them, the effect\r\nthey had on me personally, and to what extent they influenced my\r\npersonal conduct.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina seceded December 20, 1860, and Mississippi soon\r\nafter.  Emissaries came to Louisiana to influence the Governor,\r\nLegislature, and people, and it was the common assertion that, if\r\nall the Cotton States would follow the lead of South Carolina, it\r\nwould diminish the chances of civil war, because a bold and\r\ndetermined front would deter the General Government from any\r\nmeasures of coercion.  About this time also, viz., early in\r\nDecember, we received Mr. Buchanan's annual message to Congress, in\r\nwhich he publicly announced that the General Government had no\r\nconstitutional power to \"coerce a State.\"  I confess this staggered\r\nme, and I feared that the prophecies and assertions of Alison and\r\nother European commentators on our form of government were right,\r\nand that our Constitution was a mere rope of sand, that would break\r\nwith the first pressure.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Louisiana met on the 10th of December, and\r\npassed an act calling a convention of delegates from the people, to\r\nmeet at Baton Rouge, on the 8th of January, to take into\r\nconsideration the state of the Union; and, although it was\r\nuniversally admitted that a large majority of the voters of the\r\nState were opposed to secession, disunion, and all the steps of the\r\nSouth Carolinians, yet we saw that they were powerless, and that\r\nthe politicians would sweep them along rapidly to the end,\r\nprearranged by their leaders in Washington.  Before the ordinance\r\nof secession was passed, or the convention had assembled, on the\r\nfaith of a telegraphic dispatch sent by the two Senators, Benjamin\r\nand Slidell, from their seats in the United States Senate at\r\nWashington, Governor Moore ordered the seizure of all the United\r\nStates forts at the mouth of the Mississippi and Lake\r\nPontchartrain, and of the United States arsenal at Baton Rouge.\r\nThe forts had no garrisons, but the arsenal was held by a small\r\ncompany of artillery, commanded by Major Haskins, a most worthy and\r\nexcellent officer, who had lost an arm in Mexico.  I remember well\r\nthat I was strongly and bitterly impressed by the seizure of the\r\narsenal, which occurred on January 10, 1861.\r\n\r\nWhen I went first to Baton Rouge, in 1859, en route to Alexandria,\r\nI found Captain Rickett's company of artillery stationed in the\r\narsenal, but soon after there was somewhat of a clamor on the Texas\r\nfrontier about Brownsville, which induced the War Department to\r\norder Rickett's company to that frontier.  I remember that Governor\r\nMoore remonstrated with the Secretary of War because so much\r\ndangerous property, composed of muskets, powder, etc., had been\r\nleft by the United States unguarded, in a parish where the slave\r\npopulation was as five or six to one of whites; and it was on his\r\nofficial demand that the United States Government ordered Haskinss\r\ncompany to replace Rickett's.  This company did not number forty\r\nmen.  In the night of January 9th, about five hundred New Orleans\r\nmilitia, under command of a Colonel Wheat, went up from New Orleans\r\nby boat, landed, surrounded the arsenal, and demanded its\r\nsurrender.  Haskins was of course unprepared for such a step, yet\r\nhe at first resolved to defend the post as he best could with his\r\nsmall force.  But Bragg, who was an old army acquaintance of his,\r\nhad a parley with him, exhibited to him the vastly superior force\r\nof his assailants, embracing two field-batteries, and offered to\r\nprocure for him honorable terms, to march out with drums and\r\ncolors, and to take unmolested passage in a boat up to St. Louis;\r\nalleging, further, that the old Union was at an end, and that a\r\njust settlement would be made between the two new fragments for all\r\nthe property stored in the arsenal.  Of course it was Haskins's\r\nduty to have defended his post to the death; but up to that time\r\nthe national authorities in Washington had shown such\r\npusillanimity, that the officers of the army knew not what to do.\r\nThe result, anyhow, was that Haskins surrendered his post, and at\r\nonce embarked for St. Louis.  The arms and munitions stored in the\r\narsenal were scattered--some to Mississippi, some to New Orleans,\r\nsome to Shreveport; and to me, at the Central Arsenal, were\r\nconsigned two thousand muskets, three hundred Jager rifles, and a\r\nlarge amount of cartridges and ammunition.  The invoices were\r\nsigned by the former ordnance-sergeant, Olodowski, as a captain of\r\nordnance, and I think he continued such on General Bragg's staff\r\nthrough the whole of the subsequent civil war.  These arms, etc.,\r\ncame up to me at Alexandria, with orders from Governor Moore to\r\nreceipt for and account for them.  Thus I was made the receiver of\r\nstolen goods, and these goods the property of the United States.\r\nThis grated hard on my feelings as an ex-army-officer, and on\r\ncounting the arms I noticed that they were packed in the old\r\nfamiliar boxes, with the \"U. S.\"  simply scratched off.  General G.\r\nMason Graham had resigned as the chairman of the Executive\r\nCommittee, and Dr. S. A. Smith, of Alexandria, then a member of the\r\nState Senate, had succeeded him as chairman, and acted as head of\r\nthe Board of Supervisors.  At the time I was in most intimate\r\ncorrespondence with all of these parties, and our letters must have\r\nbeen full of politics, but I have only retained copies of a few of\r\nthe letters, which I will embody in this connection, as they will\r\nshow, better than by any thing I can now recall, the feelings of\r\nparties at that critical period.  The seizure of the arsenal at\r\nBaton Rouge occurred January 10, 1861, and the secession ordinance\r\nwas not passed until about the 25th or 26th of the same month.  At\r\nall events, after the seizure of the arsenal, and before the\r\npassage of the ordinance of secession, viz., on the 18th of\r\nJanuary, I wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nLouisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy\r\nJanuary 18, 1861\r\n\r\nGovernor THOMAS O. MOORE, Baton, Rouge, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nSir: As I occupy a quasi-military position under the laws of the\r\nState, I deem it proper to acquaint you that I accepted such\r\nposition when Louisiana was a State in the Union, and when the\r\nmotto of this seminary was inserted in marble over the main door:\r\n\"By the liberality of the General Government of the United States.\r\nThe Union--esto perpetua.\"\r\n\r\nRecent events foreshadow a great change, and it becomes all men to\r\nchoose.  If Louisiana withdraw from the Federal Union, I prefer to\r\nmaintain my allegiance to the Constitution as long as a fragment of\r\nit survives; and my longer stay here would be wrong in every sense\r\nof the word.\r\n\r\nIn that event, I beg you will send or appoint some authorized agent\r\nto take charge of the arms and munitions of war belonging to the\r\nState, or advise me what disposition to make of them.\r\n\r\nAnd furthermore, as president of the Board of Supervisors, I beg\r\nyou to take immediate steps to relieve me as superintendent, the\r\nmoment the State determines to secede, for on no earthly account\r\nwill I do any act or think any thought hostile to or in defiance of\r\nthe old Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[PRIVATE.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nTo Governor Moore:\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir: I take it for granted that you have been expecting for\r\nsome days the accompanying paper from me (the above official\r\nletter).  I have repeatedly and again made known to General Graham\r\nand Dr. Smith that, in the event of a severance of the relations\r\nhitherto existing between the Confederated States of this Union, I\r\nwould be forced to choose the old Union.  It is barely possible all\r\nthe States may secede, South and North, that new combinations may\r\nresult, but this process will be one of time and uncertainty, and I\r\ncannot with my opinions await the subsequent development.\r\n\r\nI have never been a politician, and therefore undervalue the\r\nexcited feelings and opinions of present rulers, but I do think, if\r\nthis people cannot execute a form of government like the present,\r\nthat a worse one will result.\r\n\r\nI will keep the cadets as quiet as possible.  They are nervous, but\r\nI think the interest of the State requires them here, guarding this\r\nproperty, and acquiring a knowledge which will be useful to your\r\nState in after-times.\r\n\r\nWhen I leave, which I now regard as certain, the present professors\r\ncan manage well enough, to afford you leisure time to find a\r\nsuitable successor to me.  You might order Major Smith to receipt\r\nfor the arms, and to exercise military command, while the academic\r\nexercises could go on under the board.  In time, some gentleman\r\nwill turn up, better qualified than I am, to carry on the seminary\r\nto its ultimate point of success.  I entertain the kindest feelings\r\ntoward all, and would leave the State with much regret; only in\r\ngreat events we must choose, one way or the other.\r\n\r\nTruly, your friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 19, 1881--Saturday.\r\n\r\nDr. S. A. Smith, President Board of Supervisors, Baton Rouge,\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I have just finished my quarterly reports to the parents\r\nof all the cadets here, or who have been here.  All my books of\r\naccount are written up to date.  All bills for the houses, fences,\r\netc., are settled, and nothing now remains but the daily tontine of\r\nrecitations and drills.  I have written officially and unofficially\r\nto Governor Moore, that with my opinions of the claimed right of\r\naccession, of the seizure of public forts, arsenals, etc., and the\r\nignominious capture of a United States garrison, stationed in your\r\nmidst, as a guard to the arsenal and for the protection of your own\r\npeople, it would be highly improper for me longer to remain.  No\r\ngreat inconvenience can result to the seminary.  I will be the\r\nchief loser.  I came down two months before my pay commenced.  I\r\nmade sacrifices in Kansas to enable me thus to obey the call of\r\nGovernor Wickliffe, and you know that last winter I declined a most\r\nadvantageous offer of employment abroad; and thus far I have\r\nreceived nothing as superintendent of the arsenal, though I went to\r\nWashington and New York (at my own expense) on the faith of the\r\nfive hundred dollars salary promised.\r\n\r\nThese are all small matters in comparison with those involved in\r\nthe present state of the country, which will cause sacrifices by\r\nmillions, instead of by hundreds.  The more I think of it, the more\r\nI think I should be away, the sooner the better; and therefore I\r\nhope you will join with Governor Moors in authorizing me to turn\r\nover to Major Smith the military command here, and to the academic\r\nboard the control of the daily exercises and recitations.\r\n\r\nThere will be no necessity of your coming up.  You can let Major\r\nSmith receive the few hundreds of cash I have on hand, and I can\r\nmeet you on a day certain in New Orleans, when we can settle the\r\nbank account.  Before I leave, I can pay the steward Jarrean his\r\naccount for the month, and there would be no necessity for other\r\npayments till about the close of March, by which time the board can\r\nmeet, and elect a treasurer and superintendent also.\r\n\r\nAt present I have no class, and there will be none ready till about\r\nthe month of May, when there will be a class in \"surveying.\"  Even\r\nif you do not elect a superintendent in the mean time, Major Smith\r\ncould easily teach this class, as he is very familiar with the\r\nsubject-matter: Indeed, I think you will do well to leave the\r\nsubject of a new superintendent until one perfectly satisfactory\r\nturns up.\r\n\r\nThere is only one favor I would ask.  The seminary has plenty of\r\nmoney in bank.  The Legislature will surely appropriate for my\r\nsalary as superintendent of this arsenal.  Would you not let me\r\nmake my drafts on the State Treasury, send them to you, let the\r\nTreasurer note them for payment when the appropriation is made, and\r\nthen pay them out of the seminary fund?  The drafts will be paid in\r\nMarch, and the seminary will lose nothing.  This would be just to\r\nme; for I actually spent two hundred dollars and more in going to\r\nWashington and New York, thereby securing from the United States,\r\nin advance, three thousand dollars' worth of the very best arms;\r\nand clothing and books, at a clear profit to the seminary of over\r\neight hundred dollars.  I may be some time in finding new\r\nemployment, and will stand in need of this money (five hundred\r\ndollars); otherwise I would abandon it.\r\n\r\nI will not ask you to put the Board of Supervisors to the trouble\r\nof meeting, unless you can get a quorum at Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy course of mail, I received the following answer from Governor\r\nMoore, the original of which I still possess.  It is all in General\r\nBraggs handwriting, with which I am familiar--\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Office,\r\n\r\nBATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA, January 23, 1861\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: It is with the deepest regret I acknowledge receipt of\r\nyour communication of the 18th inst.  In the pressure of official\r\nbusiness, I can now only request you to transfer to Prof. Smith the\r\narms, munitions, and funds in your hands, whenever you conclude to\r\nwithdraw from the position you have filled with so much\r\ndistinction.  You cannot regret more than I do the necessity which\r\ndeprives us of your services, and you will bear with you the\r\nrespect, confidence, and admiration, of all who have been\r\nassociated with you.  Very truly, your friend,\r\n\r\nThomas O. Moore.\r\n\r\nColonel W. T. SHERMAN, Superintendent Military Academy, Alexandria.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must have received several letters from Bragg, about this time,\r\nwhich have not been preserved; for I find that, on the 1st of\r\nFebruary, 1861, I wrote him thus:\r\n\r\nSeminary of Learning\r\nAlexandria, LOUISIANA, February 1, 1881.\r\n\r\nColonel Braxton BRAGG, Baton, Rouge, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: Yours of January 23d and 27th are received.  I thank you\r\nmost kindly, and Governor Moors through you, for the kind manner in\r\nwhich you have met my wishes.\r\n\r\nNow that I cannot be compromised by political events, I will so\r\nshape my course as best to serve the institution, which has a\r\nstrong hold on my affections and respect.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Supervisors will be called for the 9th instant, and I\r\nwill cooperate with them in their measures to place matters here on\r\na safe and secure basis.  I expect to be here two weeks, and will\r\nmake you full returns of money and property belonging to the State\r\nCentral Arsenal.  All the arms and ammunition are safely stored\r\nhere.  Then I will write you more at length.  With sincere respect,\r\nyour friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Smith's receipt to me, for the arms and property belonging\r\nboth to the seminary and to the arsenal, is dated February 19,\r\n1861.  I subjoin also, in this connection, copies of one or two\r\npapers that may prove of interest\r\n\r\n\r\nBATON ROUGE, January 28, 1881.\r\nTo Major SHERMAN, Superintendent, Alexandria.\r\n\r\nMy DEAR SIR: Your letter was duly receive, and would have been\r\nanswered ere this time could I have arranged sooner the matter of\r\nthe five hundred dollars.  I shall go from here to New Orleans\r\nto-day or tomorrow, and will remain there till Saturday after next,\r\nperhaps.  I shall expect to meet you there, as indicated in your\r\nnote to me.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you that it is with no ordinary regret that I view\r\nyour determination to leave us, for really I believe that the\r\nsuccess of our institution, now almost assured, is jeopardized\r\nthereby.  I am sore that we will never have a superintendent with\r\nwhom I shall have more pleasant relations than those which have\r\nexisted between yourself and me.\r\n\r\nI fully appreciate the motives which have induced you to give up a\r\nposition presenting so many advantages to yourself, and sincerely\r\nhope that you may, in any future enterprise, enjoy the success\r\nwhich your character and ability merit and deserve.\r\n\r\nShould you come down on the Rapides (steamer), please look after my\r\nwife, who will, I hope, accompany you on said boat, or some other\r\ngood one.\r\n\r\nColonel Bragg informs me that the necessary orders have been given\r\nfor the transfer and receipt by Major Smith of the public property.\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a request to the secretary to convene the Board\r\nof Supervisors, that they may act as seems best to them in the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Major Smith will command by seniority the cadets,\r\nand the Academic Board will be able to conduct the scientific\r\nexercises of the institution until the Board of Supervisors can\r\nhave time to act.  Hoping to meet you soon at the St. Charles, I\r\nam,\r\n\r\nMost truly, your friend and servant,    S. A. Smith\r\n\r\nP. S. Governor Moors desires me to express his profound regret that\r\nthe State is about to lose one who we all fondly hoped had cast his\r\ndestinies for weal or for woe among us; and that he is sensible\r\nthat we lose thereby an officer whom it will be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to replace.\r\n\r\nS. A. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATON ROUGE, February 11, 1881.\r\nTo Major Sherman, Alexandria.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I have been in New Orleans for ten days, and on returning\r\nhere find two letters from you, also your prompt answer to the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives, for which I am much\r\nobliged.\r\n\r\nThe resolution passed the last day before adjournment.  I was\r\npurposing to respond, when your welcome reports came to hand.  I\r\nhave arranged to pay you your five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nI will say nothing of general politics, except to give my opinion\r\nthat there is not to be any war.\r\n\r\nIn that event, would it not be possible for you to become a citizen\r\nof our State? Everyone deplores your determination to leave us.  At\r\nthe same time, your friends feel that you are abandoning a position\r\nthat might become an object of desire to any one.\r\n\r\nI will try to meet you in New Orleans at any time you may indicate;\r\nbut it would be best for you to stop here, when, if possible, I\r\nwill accompany you.  Should you do so, you will find me just above\r\nthe State-House, and facing it.\r\n\r\nBring with you a few copies of the \"Rules of the Seminary.\"\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nS. A. Smith\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nSir: I am instructed by the Board of Supervisors of this\r\ninstitution to present a copy of the resolutions adopted by them at\r\ntheir last meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Supervisors are due, and\r\nare hereby tendered, to Colonel William T. Sherman for the able and\r\nefficient manner in which he has conducted the affairs of the\r\nseminary during the time the institution has been under his\r\ncontrol--a period attended with unusual difficulties, requiring on\r\nthe part of the superintendent to successfully overcome them a high\r\norder of administrative talent.  And the board further bear willing\r\ntestimony to the valuable services that Colonel Sherman has\r\nrendered them in their efforts to establish an institution of\r\nlearning in accordance with the beneficent design of the State and\r\nFederal Governments; evincing at all times a readiness to adapt\r\nhimself to the ever-varying requirements of an institution of\r\nlearning in its infancy, struggling to attain a position of honor\r\nand usefulness.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, further, That, in accepting the resignation of Colonel\r\nSherman as Superintendent of the State Seminary of Learning and\r\nMilitary Academy, we tender to him assurances of our high personal\r\nregard, and our sincere regret at the occurrence of causes that\r\nrender it necessary to part with so esteemed and valued a friend,\r\nas well as co-laborer in the cause of education.\"\r\n\r\nPowhatan Clarke, Secretary of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\nA copy of the resolution of the Academic Board, passed at their\r\nsession of April 1,1861:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That in the resignation of the late superintendent,\r\nColonel W. T. Sherman, the Academic Board deem it not improper to\r\nexpress their deep conviction of the loss the institution has\r\nsustained in being thus deprived of an able head.  They cannot fail\r\nto appreciate the manliness of character which has always marked\r\nthe actions of Colonel Sherman.  While he is personally endeared to\r\nmany of them as a friend, they consider it their high pleasure to\r\ntender to him in this resolution their regret on his separation,\r\nand their sincere wish for his future welfare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given the above at some length, because, during the civil\r\nwar, it was in Southern circles asserted that I was guilty of a\r\nbreach of hospitality in taking up arms against the South.  They\r\nwere manifestly the aggressors, and we could only defend our own by\r\nassailing them.  Yet, without any knowledge of what the future had\r\nin store for me, I took unusual precautions that the institution\r\nshould not be damaged by my withdrawal.  About the 20th of\r\nFebruary, having turned over all property, records, and money, on\r\nhand, to Major Smith, and taking with me the necessary documents to\r\nmake the final settlement with Dr. S. A. Smith, at the bank in New\r\nOrleans, where the funds of the institution were deposited to my\r\ncredit, I took passage from Alexandria for that city, and arrived\r\nthere, I think, on the 23d.  Dr. Smith met me, and we went to the\r\nbank, where I turned over to him the balance, got him to audit all\r\nmy accounts, certify that they were correct and just, and that\r\nthere remained not one cent of balance in my hands.  I charged in\r\nmy account current for my salary up to the end of February, at the\r\nrate of four thousand dollars a year, and for the five hundred\r\ndollars due me as superintendent of the Central Arsenal, all of\r\nwhich was due and had been fairly earned, and then I stood free and\r\ndischarged of any and every obligation, honorary or business, that\r\nwas due by me to the State of Louisiana, or to any corporation or\r\nindividual in that State.\r\n\r\nThis business occupied two or three days, during which I staid at\r\nthe St. Louis Hotel.  I usually sat at table with Colonel and Mrs.\r\nBragg, and an officer who wore the uniform of the State of\r\nLouisiana, and was addressed as captain.  Bragg wore a colonel's\r\nuniform, and explained to me that he was a colonel in the State\r\nservice, a colonel of artillery, and that some companies of his\r\nregiment garrisoned Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and the arsenal\r\nat Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nBeauregard at the time had two sons at the Seminary of Learning.  I\r\nhad given them some of my personal care at the father's request,\r\nand, wanting to tell him of their condition and progress, I went to\r\nhis usual office in the Custom-House Building, and found him in the\r\nact of starting for Montgomery, Alabama.  Bragg said afterward that\r\nBeauregard had been sent for by Jefferson Davis, and that it was\r\nrumored that he had been made a brigadier-general, of which fact he\r\nseemed jealous, because in the old army Bragg was the senior.\r\n\r\nDavis and Stephens had been inaugurated President and\r\nVice-President of the Confederate States of America, February 18,\r\n1860, at Montgomery, and those States only embraced the seven\r\ncotton States.  I recall a conversation at the tea-table, one\r\nevening, at the St. Louis Hotel.  When Bragg was speaking of\r\nBeauregard's promotion, Mrs. Bragg, turning to me, said, \"You know\r\nthat my husband is not a favorite with the new President.\"  My mind\r\nwas resting on Mr. Lincoln as the new President, and I said I did\r\nnot know that Bragg had ever met Mr. Lincoln, when Mrs. Bragg said,\r\nquite pointedly, \"I didn't mean your President, but our President.\"\r\nI knew that Bragg hated Davis bitterly, and that he had resigned\r\nfrom the army in 1855, or 1856, because Davis, as Secretary of War,\r\nhad ordered him, with his battery, from Jefferson Barracks,\r\nMissouri, to Fort Smith or Fort Washita, in the Indian country, as\r\nBragg expressed it, \"to chase Indians with six-pounders.\"\r\n\r\nI visited the quartermaster, Colonel A. C. Myers, who had resigned\r\nfrom the army, January 28, 1861, and had accepted service under the\r\nnew regime.  His office was in the same old room in the Lafayette\r\nSquare building, which he had in 1853, when I was there a\r\ncommissary, with the same pictures on the wall, and the letters \"U.\r\nS.\"  on every thing, including his desk, papers, etc.  I asked him\r\nif he did not feel funny.  \"No, not at all.  The thing was\r\ninevitable, secession was a complete success; there would be no\r\nwar, but the two Governments would settle all matters of business\r\nin a friendly spirit, and each would go on in its allotted sphere,\r\nwithout further confusion.\"  About this date, February 16th,\r\nGeneral Twiggs, Myers's father-in-law, had surrendered his entire\r\ncommand, in the Department of Texas, to some State troops, with all\r\nthe Government property, thus consummating the first serious step\r\nin the drama of the conspiracy, which was to form a confederacy of\r\nthe cotton States, before working upon the other slave or border\r\nStates, and before the 4th of March, the day for the inauguration\r\nof President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nI walked the streets of New Orleans, and found business going along\r\nas usual.  Ships were strung for miles along the lower levee, and\r\nsteamboats above, all discharging or receiving cargo.  The Pelican\r\nflag of Louisiana was flying over the Custom House, Mint, City\r\nHall, and everywhere.  At the levee ships carried every flag on\r\nearth except that of the United States, and I was told that during\r\na procession on the 22d of February, celebrating their emancipation\r\nfrom the despotism of the United States Government, only one\r\nnational flag was shown from a house, and that the houses of\r\nCuthbert Bullitt, on Lafayette Square.  He was commanded to take it\r\ndown, but he refused, and defended it with his pistol.\r\n\r\nThe only officer of the army that I can recall, as being there at\r\nthe time, who was faithful, was Colonel C. L. Kilburn, of the\r\nCommissary Department, and he was preparing to escape North.\r\n\r\nEverybody regarded the change of Government as final; that\r\nLouisiana, by a mere declaration, was a free and independent State,\r\nand could enter into any new alliance or combination she chose.\r\n\r\nMen were being enlisted and armed, to defend the State, and there\r\nwas not the least evidence that the national Administration\r\ndesigned to make any effort, by force, to vindicate the national\r\nauthority.  I therefore bade adieu to all my friends, and about the\r\n25th of February took my departure by railroad, for Lancaster, via\r\nCairo and Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, I will simply record the fate of some\r\nof my associates.  The seminary was dispersed by the war, and all\r\nthe professors and cadets took service in the Confederacy, except\r\nYallas, St. Ange, and Cadet Taliaferro.  The latter joined a Union\r\nregiment, as a lieutenant, after New Orleans was retaken by the\r\nUnited States fleet under Farragut.  I think that both Yallas and\r\nSt. Ange have died in poverty since the war.  Major Smith joined\r\nthe rebel army in Virginia, and was killed in April, 1865, as he\r\nwas withdrawing his garrison, by night, from the batteries at\r\nDrury's Bluff, at the time General Lee began his final retreat from\r\nRichmond.  Boyd became a captain of engineers on the staff of\r\nGeneral Richard Taylor, was captured, and was in jail at Natchez,\r\nMississippi, when I was on my Meridian expedition.  He succeeded in\r\ngetting a letter to me on my arrival at Vicksburg, and, on my way\r\ndown to New Orleans, I stopped at Natchez, took him along, and\r\nenabled him to effect an exchange through General Banks.  As soon\r\nas the war was over, he returned to Alexandria, and reorganized the\r\nold institution, where I visited him in 1867; but, the next winter,\r\nthe building took fire end burned to the ground.  The students,\r\nlibrary, apparatus, etc., were transferred to Baton Rouge, where\r\nthe same institution now is, under the title of the Louisiana\r\nUniversity.  I have been able to do them many acts of kindness, and\r\nam still in correspondence, with Colonel Boyd, its president.\r\n\r\nGeneral G. Mason Graham is still living on his plantation, on Bayou\r\nRapides, old and much respected.\r\n\r\nDr. S. A. Smith became a surgeon in the rebel army, and at the\r\nclose of the war was medical director of the trans-Mississippi\r\nDepartment, with General Kirby Smith.  I have seen him since the\r\nwar, at New Orleans, where he died about a year ago.\r\n\r\nDr. Clark was in Washington recently, applying for a place as\r\nUnited States consul abroad.  I assisted him, but with no success,\r\nand he is now at Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Shiloh, I found among the prisoners Cadet\r\nBarrow, fitted him out with some clean clothing, of which he was in\r\nneed, and from him learned that Cadet Workman was killed in that\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nGovernor Moore's plantation was devastated by General Banks's\r\ntroops.  After the war he appealed to me, and through the\r\nAttorney-General, Henry Stanbery, I aided in having his\r\nland restored to him, and I think he is now living there.\r\n\r\nBragg, Beauregard, and Taylor, enacted high parts in the succeeding\r\nwar, and now reside in Louisiana or Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMISSOURI\r\n\r\nAPRIL AND MAY, 1861.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of these events in Louisiana, I was in constant\r\ncorrespondence with my brother, John Sherman, at Washington; Mr.\r\nEwing, at Lancaster, Ohio; and Major H. S. Turner, at St. Louis.  I\r\nhad managed to maintain my family comfortably at Lancaster, but was\r\nextremely anxious about the future.  It looked like the end of my\r\ncareer, for I did not suppose that \"civil war\" could give me an\r\nemployment that would provide for the family.  I thought, and may\r\nhave said, that the national crisis had been brought about by the\r\npoliticians, and, as it was upon us, they \"might fight it out\"\r\nTherefore, when I turned North from New Orleans, I felt more\r\ndisposed to look to St. Louis for a home, and to Major.  Turner to\r\nfind me employment, than to the public service.\r\n\r\nI left New Orleans about the 1st of March, 1861, by rail to Jackson\r\nand Clinton, Mississippi, Jackson, Tennessee, and Columbus,\r\nKentucky, where we took a boat to Cairo, and thence, by rail, to\r\nCincinnati and Lancaster.  All the way, I heard, in the cars and\r\nboats, warm discussions about polities; to the effect that, if Mr.\r\nLincoln should attempt coercion of the seceded States, the other\r\nslave or border States would make common cause, when, it was\r\nbelieved, it would be madness to attempt to reduce them to\r\nsubjection.  In the South, the people were earnest, fierce and\r\nangry, and were evidently organizing for action; whereas, in\r\nIllinois, Indiana, and Ohio, I saw not the least sign of\r\npreparation.  It certainly looked to me as though the people of the\r\nNorth would tamely submit to a disruption of the Union, and the\r\norators of the South used, openly and constantly, the expressions\r\nthat there would be no war, and that a lady's thimble would hold\r\nall the blood to be shed.  On reaching Lancaster, I found letters\r\nfrom my brother John, inviting me to come to Washington, as he\r\nwanted to see me; and from Major Tamer, at St. Louis, that he was\r\ntrying to secure for me the office of president of the Fifth Street\r\nRailroad, with a salary of twenty-five hundred dollars; that Mr.\r\nLucas and D. A. January held a controlling interest of stock, would\r\nvote for me, and the election would occur in March.  This suited me\r\nexactly, and I answered Turner that I would accept, with thanks.\r\nBut I also thought it right and proper that I should first go to\r\nWashington, to talk with my brother, Senator Sherman.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had just been installed, and the newspapers were filled\r\nwith rumors of every kind indicative of war; the chief act of\r\ninterest was that Major Robert Anderson had taken by night into\r\nFort Sumter all the troops garrisoning Charleston Harbor, and that\r\nhe was determined to defend it against the demands of the State of\r\nSouth Carolina and of the Confederate States.  I must have reached\r\nWashington about the 10th of March.  I found my brother there, just\r\nappointed Senator, in place of Mr. Chase, who was in the cabinet,\r\nand I have no doubt my opinions, thoughts, and feelings, wrought up\r\nby the events in Louisiana; seemed to him gloomy and extravagant.\r\nAbout Washington I saw but few signs of preparation, though the\r\nSouthern Senators and Representatives were daily sounding their\r\nthreats on the floors of Congress, and were publicly withdrawing to\r\njoin the Confederate Congress at Montgomery.  Even in the War\r\nDepartment and about the public offices there was open, unconcealed\r\ntalk, amounting to high-treason.\r\n\r\nOne day, John Sherman took me with him to see Mr. Lincoln.  He\r\nwalked into the room where the secretary to the President now sits,\r\nwe found the room full of people, and Mr. Lincoln sat at the end of\r\nthe table, talking with three or four gentlemen, who soon left.\r\nJohn walked up, shook hands, and took a chair near him, holding in\r\nhis hand some papers referring to, minor appointments in the State\r\nof Ohio, which formed the subject of conversation.  Mr. Lincoln\r\ntook the papers, said he would refer them to the proper heads of\r\ndepartments, and would be glad to make the appointments asked for,\r\nif not already promised.  John then turned to me, and said, \"Mr.\r\nPresident, this is my brother, Colonel Sherman, who is just up from\r\nLouisiana, he may give you some information you want.\"  \"Ah!\" said\r\nMr. Lincoln, \"how are they getting along down there?\" I said, \"They\r\nthink they are getting along swimmingly--they are preparing for\r\nwar.\"  \"Oh, well!\" said he, \"I guess we'll manage to keep house.\"\r\nI was silenced, said no more to him, and we soon left.  I was sadly\r\ndisappointed, and remember that I broke out on John, d--ning the\r\npoliticians generally, saying, \"You have got things in a hell of a\r\nfig, and you may get them out as you best can,\" adding that the\r\ncountry was sleeping on a volcano that might burst forth at any\r\nminute, but that I was going to St. Louis to take care of my\r\nfamily, and would have no more to do with it.  John begged me to be\r\nmore patient, but I said I would not; that I had no time to wait,\r\nthat I was off for St. Louis; and off I went.  At Lancaster I found\r\nletters from Major Turner, inviting me to St. Louis, as the place\r\nin the Fifth Street Railroad was a sure thing, and that Mr. Lucas\r\nwould rent me a good house on Locust Street, suitable for my\r\nfamily, for six hundred dollars a year.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sherman and I gathered our family and effects together,\r\nstarted for St. Louis March 27th, where we rented of Mr. Lucas the\r\nhouse on Locust Street, between Tenth and Eleventh, and occupied it\r\non the 1st of April.  Charles Ewing and John Hunter had formed a\r\nlaw-partnership in St. Louis, and agreed to board with us, taking\r\nrooms on the third floor In the latter part of March, I was duly\r\nelected president of the Fifth Street Railroad, and entered on the\r\ndischarge of my duties April 1, 1861.  We had a central office on\r\nthe corner of Fifth and Locust, and also another up at the stables\r\nin Bremen.  The road was well stocked and in full operation, and\r\nall I had to do was to watch the economical administration of\r\nexisting affairs, which I endeavored to do with fidelity and zeal.\r\nBut the whole air was full of wars and rumors of wars.  The\r\nstruggle was going on politically for the border States.  Even in\r\nMissouri, which was a slave State, it was manifest that the\r\nGovernor of the State, Claiborne Jackson, and all the leading\r\npoliticians, were for the South in case of a war.  The house on the\r\nnorthwest corner of Fifth and Pine was the rebel headquarters,\r\nwhere the rebel flag was hung publicly, and the crowds about the\r\nPlanters' House were all more or less rebel.  There was also a camp\r\nin Lindell's Grove, at the end of Olive, Street, under command of\r\nGeneral D. M. Frost, a Northern man, a graduate of West Point, in\r\nopen sympathy with the Southern leaders.  This camp was nominally a\r\nState camp of instruction, but, beyond doubt, was in the interest\r\nof the Southern cause, designed to be used against the national\r\nauthority in the event of the General Government's attempting to\r\ncoerce the Southern Confederacy.  General William S. Harvey was in\r\ncommand of the Department of Missouri, and resided in his own\r\nhouse, on Fourth Street, below Market; and there were five or six\r\ncompanies of United States troops in the arsenal, commanded by\r\nCaptain N. Lyon; throughout the city, there had been organized,\r\nalmost exclusively out of the German part of the population, four\r\nor five regiments of \"Home Guards,\" with which movement Frank\r\nBlair, B. Gratz Brown, John M. Schofield, Clinton B. Fisk, and\r\nothers, were most active on the part of the national authorities.\r\nFrank Blair's brother Montgomery was in the cabinet of Mr. Lincoln\r\nat Washington, and to him seemed committed the general management\r\nof affairs in Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers fanned the public excitement to the highest pitch,\r\nand threats of attacking the arsenal on the one hand, and the mob\r\nof d--d rebels in Camp Jackson on the other, were bandied about.  I\r\ntried my best to keep out of the current, and only talked freely\r\nwith a few men; among them Colonel John O'Fallon, a wealthy\r\ngentleman who resided above St. Louis.  He daily came down to my\r\noffice in Bremen, and we walked up and down the pavement by the\r\nhour, deploring the sad condition of our country, and the seeming\r\ndrift toward dissolution and anarchy.  I used also to go down to\r\nthe arsenal occasionally to see Lyon, Totten, and other of my army\r\nacquaintance, and was glad to see them making preparations to\r\ndefend their post, if not to assume the offensive.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment of Fort Sumter, which was announced by telegraph,\r\nbegan April 12th, and ended on the 14th.  We then knew that the war\r\nwas actually begun, and though the South was openly, manifestly the\r\naggressor, yet her friends and apologists insisted that she was\r\nsimply acting on a justifiable defensive, and that in the forcible\r\nseizure of, the public forts within her limits the people were\r\nacting with reasonable prudence and foresight.  Yet neither party\r\nseemed willing to invade, or cross the border.  Davis, who ordered\r\nthe bombardment of Sumter, knew the temper of his people well, and\r\nforesaw that it would precipitate the action of the border States;\r\nfor almost immediately Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and\r\nTennessee, followed the lead of the cotton States, and conventions\r\nwere deliberating in Kentucky and Missouri.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Saturday, April 6th, I received the following,\r\ndispatch:\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,  April 6,1861.\r\n\r\nMajor W. T. Sherman:\r\n\r\nWill you accept the chief clerkship of the War Department? We will\r\nmake you assistant Secretary of War when Congress meets.\r\n\r\nM. Blair, Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which I replied by telegraph, Monday morning; \"I cannot accept;\"\r\nand by mail as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, April 8, 1861.\r\nOffice of the St. Louis Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nHon. M. Blair, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nI received, about nine o'clock Saturday night, your telegraph\r\ndispatch, which I have this moment answered, \"I cannot accept.\"\r\n\r\nI have quite a large family, and when I resigned my place in\r\nLouisiana, on account of secession, I had no time to lose; and,\r\ntherefore, after my hasty visit to Washington, where I saw no\r\nchance of employment, I came to St. Louis, have accepted a place in\r\nthis company, have rented a house, and incurred other obligations,\r\nso that I am not at liberty to change.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the compliment contained in your offer, and assure\r\nyou that I wish the Administration all success in its almost\r\nimpossible task of governing this distracted and anarchical people.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nW.T. SHERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI was afterward told that this letter gave offense, and that some\r\nof Mr. Lincoln's cabinet concluded that I too would prove false to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nLater in that month, after the capture of Fort Sumter by the\r\nConfederate authorities, a Dr. Cornyn came to our house on Locust\r\nStreet, one night after I had gone to bed, and told me he had been\r\nsent by Frank Blair, who was not well, and wanted to see me that\r\nnight at his house.  I dressed and walked over to his house on\r\nWashington Avenue, near Fourteenth, and found there, in the\r\nfront-room, several gentlemen, among whom I recall Henry T. Blow.\r\nBlair was in the back-room, closeted with some gentleman, who soon\r\nleft, and I was called in.  He there told me that the Government\r\nwas mistrustful of General Harvey, that a change in the command of\r\nthe department was to be made; that he held it in his power to\r\nappoint a brigadier-general, and put him in command of the\r\ndepartment, and he offered me the place.  I told him I had once\r\noffered my services, and they were declined; that I had made\r\nbusiness engagements in St. Louis, which I could not throw off at\r\npleasure; that I had long deliberated on my course of action, and\r\nmust decline his offer, however tempting and complimentary.  He\r\nreasoned with me, but I persisted.  He told me, in that event, he\r\nshould appoint Lyon, and he did so.\r\n\r\nFinding that even my best friends were uneasy as to my political\r\nstatus, on the 8th of May I addressed the following official letter\r\nto the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the St. Louis Railroad Company,\r\nMay 8,1881.\r\n\r\nHon. S. Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I hold myself now, as always, prepared to serve my\r\ncountry in the capacity for which I was trained.  I did not and\r\nwill not volunteer for three months, because I cannot throw my\r\nfamily on the cold charity of the world.  But for the three-years\r\ncall, made by the President, an officer can prepare his command and\r\ndo good service.\r\n\r\nI will not volunteer as a soldier, because rightfully or wrongfully\r\nI feel unwilling to take a mere private's place, and, having for\r\nmany years lived in California and Louisiana, the men are not well\r\nenough acquainted with me to elect me to my appropriate place.\r\n\r\nShould my services be needed, the records of the War Department\r\nwill enable you to designate the station in which I can render most\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nYours truly,   W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this I do not think I received a direct answer; but, on the 10th\r\nof the same month, I was appointed colonel of the Thirteenth\r\nRegular Infantry.\r\n\r\nI remember going to the arsenal on the 9th of May, taking my\r\nchildren with me in the street-cars.  Within the arsenal wall were\r\ndrawn up in parallel lines four regiments of the \"Home Guards,\" and\r\nI saw men distributing cartridges to the boxes.  I also saw General\r\nLyon running about with his hair in the wind, his pockets full of\r\npapers, wild and irregular, but I knew him to be a man of vehement\r\npurpose and of determined action.  I saw of course that it meant\r\nbusiness, but whether for defense or offense I did not know.  The\r\nnext morning I went up to the railroad-office in Bremen, as usual,\r\nand heard at every corner of the streets that the \"Dutch\" were\r\nmoving on Camp Jackson.  People were barricading their houses, and\r\nmen were running in that direction.  I hurried through my business\r\nas quickly as I could, and got back to my house on Locust Street by\r\ntwelve o'clock.  Charles Ewing and Hunter were there, and insisted\r\non going out to the camp to see \"the fun.\"  I tried to dissuade\r\nthem, saying that in case of conflict the bystanders were more\r\nlikely to be killed than the men engaged, but they would go.  I\r\nfelt as much interest as anybody else, but staid at home, took my\r\nlittle son Willie, who was about seven years old, and walked up and\r\ndown the pavement in front of our house, listening for the sound of\r\nmusketry or cannon in the direction of Camp Jackson.  While so\r\nengaged Miss Eliza Dean, who lived opposite us, called me across\r\nthe street, told me that her brother-in-law, Dr. Scott, was a\r\nsurgeon in Frost's camp, and she was dreadfully afraid he would be\r\nkilled.  I reasoned with her that General Lyon was a regular\r\nofficer; that if he had gone out, as reported, to Camp Jackson, he\r\nwould take with him such a force as would make resistance\r\nimpossible; but she would not be comforted, saying that the camp\r\nwas made up of the young men from the first and best families of\r\nSt. Louis, and that they were proud, and would fight.  I explained\r\nthat young men of the best families did not like to be killed\r\nbetter than ordinary people.  Edging gradually up the street, I was\r\nin Olive Street just about Twelfth, when I saw a man running from\r\nthe direction of Camp Jackson at full speed, calling, as he went,\r\n\"They've surrendered, they've surrendered!\" So I turned back and\r\nrang the bell at Mrs. Dean's.  Eliza came to the door, and I\r\nexplained what I had heard; but she angrily slammed the door in my\r\nface!  Evidently she was disappointed to find she was mistaken in\r\nher estimate of the rash courage of the best families.\r\n\r\nI again turned in the direction of Camp Jackson, my boy Willie with\r\nme still.  At the head of Olive Street, abreast of Lindell's Grove,\r\nI found Frank Blair's regiment in the street, with ranks opened,\r\nand the Camp Jackson prisoners inside.  A crowd of people was\r\ngathered around, calling to the prisoners by name, some hurrahing\r\nfor Jeff Davis, and others encouraging the troops.  Men, women, and\r\nchildren, were in the crowd.  I passed along till I found myself\r\ninside the grove, where I met Charles Ewing and John Hunter, and we\r\nstood looking at the troops on the road, heading toward the city.\r\nA band of music was playing at the head, and the column made one or\r\ntwo ineffectual starts, but for some reason was halted.  The\r\nbattalion of regulars was abreast of me, of which Major Rufus\r\nSaxton was in command, and I gave him an evening paper, which I had\r\nbought of the newsboy on my way out.  He was reading from it some\r\npiece of news, sitting on his horse, when the column again began to\r\nmove forward, and he resumed his place at the head of his command.\r\nAt that part of the road, or street, was an embankment about eight\r\nfeet high, and a drunken fellow tried to pass over it to the people\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nOne of the regular sergeant file-closers ordered him back, but he\r\nattempted to pass through the ranks, when the sergeant barred his\r\nprogress with his musket \"a-port.\"  The drunken man seized his\r\nmusket, when the sergeant threw him off with violence, and he\r\nrolled over and over down the bank.  By the time this man had\r\npicked himself up and got his hat, which had fallen off, and had\r\nagain mounted the embankment, the regulars had passed, and the head\r\nof Osterhaus's regiment of Home Guards had come up.  The man had in\r\nhis hand a small pistol, which he fired off, and I heard that the\r\nball had struck the leg of one of Osterhaus's staff; the regiment\r\nstopped; there was a moment of confusion, when the soldiers of that\r\nregiment began to fire over our heads in the grove.  I heard the\r\nballs cutting the leaves above our heads, and saw several men and\r\nwomen running in all directions, some of whom were wounded.  Of\r\ncourse there was a general stampede.  Charles Ewing threw Willie on\r\nthe ground and covered him with his body.  Hunter ran behind the\r\nhill, and I also threw myself on the ground.  The fire ran back\r\nfrom the head of the regiment toward its rear, and as I saw the men\r\nreloading their pieces, I jerked Willie up, ran back with him into\r\na gully which covered us, lay there until I saw that the fire had\r\nceased, and that the column was again moving on, when I took up\r\nWillie and started back for home round by way of Market Street.  A\r\nwoman and child were killed outright; two or three men were also\r\nkilled, and several others were wounded.  The great mass of the\r\npeople on that occasion were simply curious spectators, though men\r\nwere sprinkled through the crowd calling out, \"Hurrah for Jeff\r\nDavis!\" and others were particularly abusive of the \"damned Dutch\"\r\nLyon posted a guard in charge of the vacant camp, and marched his\r\nprisoners down to the arsenal; some were paroled, and others held,\r\ntill afterward they were regularly exchanged.\r\n\r\nA very few days after this event, May 14th, I received a dispatch\r\nfrom my brother Charles in Washington, telling me to come on at\r\nonce; that I had been appointed a colonel of the Thirteenth Regular\r\nInfantry, and that I was wanted at Washington immediately.\r\n\r\nOf course I could no longer defer action.  I saw Mr. Lucas, Major\r\nTurner, and other friends and parties connected with the road, who\r\nagreed that I should go on.  I left my family, because I was under\r\nthe impression that I would be allowed to enlist my own regiment,\r\nwhich would take some time, and I expected to raise the regiment\r\nand organize it at Jefferson Barracks.  I repaired to Washington,\r\nand there found that the Government was trying to rise to a level\r\nwith the occasion.  Mr. Lincoln had, without the sanction of law,\r\nauthorized the raising of ten new regiments of regulars, each\r\ninfantry regiment to be composed of three battalions of eight\r\ncompanies each; and had called for seventy-five thousand State\r\nvolunteers.  Even this call seemed to me utterly inadequate; still\r\nit was none of my business.  I took the oath of office, and was\r\nfurnished with a list of officers, appointed to my regiment, which\r\nwas still, incomplete.  I reported in person to General Scott, at\r\nhis office on Seventeenth Street, opposite the War Department, and\r\napplied for authority to return West, and raise my regiment at\r\nJefferson Barracks, but the general said my lieutenant-colonel,\r\nBurbank, was fully qualified to superintend the enlistment, and\r\nthat he wanted me there; and he at once dictated an order for me to\r\nreport to him in person for inspection duty.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that I would not be permitted to return to St. Louis, I\r\ninstructed Mrs. Sherman to pack up, return to Lancaster, and trust\r\nto the fate of war.\r\n\r\nI also resigned my place as president of the Fifth Street Railroad,\r\nto take effect at the end of May, so that in fact I received pay\r\nfrom that road for only two months' service, and then began my new\r\narmy career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFROM THE BATTLE OF BULL RUN TO PADUCAH KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI\r\n\r\n1861-1862.\r\n\r\nAnd now that, in these notes, I have fairly reached the period of\r\nthe civil war, which ravaged our country from 1861 to 1865--an\r\nevent involving a conflict of passion, of prejudice, and of arms,\r\nthat has developed results which, for better or worse, have left\r\ntheir mark on the world's history--I feel that I tread on delicate\r\nground.\r\n\r\nI have again and again been invited to write a history of the war,\r\nor to record for publication my personal recollections of it, with\r\nlarge offers of money therefor; all of which I have heretofore\r\ndeclined, because the truth is not always palatable, and should not\r\nalways be told.  Many of the actors in the grand drama still live,\r\nand they and their friends are quick to controversy, which should\r\nbe avoided.  The great end of peace has been attained, with little\r\nor no change in our form of government, and the duty of all good\r\nmen is to allow the passions of that period to subside, that we may\r\ndirect our physical and mental labor to repair the waste of war,\r\nand to engage in the greater task of continuing our hitherto\r\nwonderful national development.\r\n\r\nWhat I now propose to do is merely to group some of my personal\r\nrecollections about the historic persons and events of the day,\r\nprepared not with any view to their publication, but rather for\r\npreservation till I am gone; and then to be allowed to follow into\r\noblivion the cords of similar papers, or to be used by some\r\nhistorian who may need them by way of illustration.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore recorded how I again came into the military\r\nservice of the United States as a colonel of the Thirteenth Regular\r\nInfantry, a regiment that had no existence at the time, and that,\r\ninstead of being allowed to enlist the men and instruct them, as\r\nexpected, I was assigned in Washington City, by an order of\r\nLieutenant-General Winfield Scott, to inspection duty near him on\r\nthe 20th of June, 1861.\r\n\r\nAt that time Lieutenant-General Scott commanded the army in chief,\r\nwith Colonel E. D. Townsend as his adjutant-general,\r\n\r\nMajor G. W. Cullum, United States Engineers, and Major Schuyler\r\nHamilton, as aides.-de-camp.  The general had an office up stairs\r\non Seventeenth Street, opposite the War Department, and resided in\r\na house close by, on Pennsylvania Avenue.  All fears for the\r\nimmediate safety of the capital had ceased, and quite a large force\r\nof regulars and volunteers had been collected in and about\r\nWashington.  Brigadier-General J. K. Mansfield commanded in the\r\ncity, and Brigadier-General Irvin McDowell on the other side of the\r\nPotomac, with his headquarters at Arlington House.  His troops\r\nextended in a semicircle from Alexandria to above Georgetown.\r\nSeveral forts and redoubts were either built or in progress, and\r\nthe people were already clamorous for a general forward movement.\r\nAnother considerable army had also been collected in Pennsylvania\r\nunder General Patterson, and, at the time I speak of, had moved\r\nforward to Hagerstown and Williamsport, on the Potomac River.  My\r\nbrother, John Sherman, was a volunteer aide-de-camp to General\r\nPatterson, and, toward the end of June, I went up to Hagerstown to\r\nsee him.  I found that army in the very act of moving, and we rode\r\ndown to Williamsport in a buggy, and were present when the leading\r\ndivision crossed the Potomac River by fording it waist-deep.  My\r\nfriend and classmate, George H. Thomas, was there, in command of a\r\nbrigade in the leading division.  I talked with him a good deal,\r\nalso with General Cadwalader, and with the staff-officers of\r\nGeneral Patterson, viz., Fitz-John Porter, Belger, Beckwith, and\r\nothers, all of whom seemed encouraged to think that the war was to\r\nbe short and decisive, and that, as soon as it was demonstrated\r\nthat the General Government meant in earnest to defend its rights\r\nand property, some general compromise would result.\r\n\r\nPatterson's army crossed the Potomac River on the 1st or 2d of\r\nJuly, and, as John Sherman was to take his seat as a Senator in the\r\ncalled session of Congress, to meet July 4th, he resigned his place\r\nas aide-de-camp, presented me his two horses and equipment, and we\r\nreturned to Washington together.\r\n\r\nThe Congress assembled punctually on the 4th of July, and the\r\nmessage of Mr. Lincoln was strong and good: it recognized the fact\r\nthat civil war was upon us, that compromise of any kind was at an\r\nend; and he asked for four hundred thousand men, and four hundred\r\nmillion dollars, wherewith to vindicate the national authority, and\r\nto regain possession of the captured forts and other property of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIt was also immediately demonstrated that the tone and temper of\r\nCongress had changed since the Southern Senators and members had\r\nwithdrawn, and that we, the military, could now go to work with\r\nsome definite plans and ideas.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the troops about Washington was good, but it was\r\nmanifest they were far from being soldiers.  Their uniforms were as\r\nvarious as the States and cities from which they came; their arms\r\nwere also of every pattern and calibre; and they were so loaded\r\ndown with overcoats, haversacks, knapsacks, tents, and baggage,\r\nthat it took from twenty-five to fifty wagons to move the camp of a\r\nregiment from one place to another, and some of the camps had\r\nbakeries and cooking establishments that would have done credit to\r\nDelmonico.\r\n\r\nWhile I was on duty with General Scott, viz., from June 20th to\r\nabout June 30th, the general frequently communicated to those about\r\nhim his opinions and proposed plans.  He seemed vexed with the\r\nclamors of the press for immediate action, and the continued\r\ninterference in details by the President, Secretary of War, and\r\nCongress.  He spoke of organizing a grand army of invasion, of\r\nwhich the regulars were to constitute the \"iron column,\" and seemed\r\nto intimate that he himself would take the field in person, though\r\nhe was at the time very old, very heavy, and very unwieldy.  His\r\nage must have been about seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nAt that date, July 4, 1861, the rebels had two armies in front of\r\nWashington; the one at Manassas Junction, commanded by General\r\nBeauregard, with his advance guard at Fairfax Court House, and\r\nindeed almost in sight of Washington.  The other, commanded by\r\nGeneral Joe Johnston, was at Winchester, with its advance at\r\nMartinsburg and Harper's Ferry; but the advance had fallen back\r\nbefore Patterson, who then occupied Martinsburg and the line of the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe temper of Congress and the people would not permit the slow and\r\nmethodical preparation desired by General Scott; and the cry of \"On\r\nto Richmond!\" which was shared by the volunteers, most of whom had\r\nonly engaged for ninety days, forced General Scott to hasten his\r\npreparations, and to order a general advance about the middle of\r\nJuly.  McDowell was to move from the defenses of Washington, and\r\nPatterson from Martinsburg.  In the organization of McDowell's army\r\ninto divisions and brigades, Colonel David Hunter was assigned to\r\ncommand the Second Division, and I was ordered to take command of\r\nhis former brigade, which was composed of five regiments in\r\nposition in and about Fort Corcoran, and on the ground opposite\r\nGeorgetown.  I assumed command on the 30th of June, and proceeded\r\nat once to prepare it for the general advance.  My command\r\nconstituted the Third Brigade of the First Division, which division\r\nwas commanded by Brigadier-General Daniel Tyler, a graduate of West\r\nPoint, but who had seen little or no actual service.  I applied to\r\nGeneral McDowell for home staff-officers, and he gave me, as\r\nadjutant-general, Lieutenant Piper, of the Third Artillery, and, as\r\naide-de-camp, Lieutenant McQuesten, a fine young cavalry-officer,\r\nfresh from West Point.\r\n\r\nI selected for the field the Thirteenth New York, Colonel Quinby;\r\nthe Sixty-ninth New York, Colonel Corcoran; the Seventy-ninth New\r\nYork, Colonel Cameron; and the Second Wisconsin, Lieutenant-\r\nColonel Peck.  These were all good, strong, volunteer regiments,\r\npretty well commanded; and I had reason to believe that I had one\r\nof the best brigades in the whole army.  Captain Ayres's battery of\r\nthe Third Regular Artillery was also attached to my brigade.  The\r\nother regiment, the Twenty-ninth New York, Colonel Bennett, was\r\ndestined to be left behind in charge of the forts and camps during\r\nour absence, which was expected to be short.  Soon after I had\r\nassumed the command, a difficulty arose in the Sixty-ninth, an\r\nIrish regiment.  This regiment had volunteered in New York, early\r\nin April, for ninety days; but, by reason of the difficulty of\r\npassing through Baltimore, they had come via Annapolis, had been\r\nheld for duty on the railroad as a guard for nearly a month before\r\nthey actually reached Washington, and were then mustered in about a\r\nmonth after enrollment.  Some of the men claimed that they were\r\nentitled to their discharge in ninety days from the time of\r\nenrollment, whereas the muster-roll read ninety days from the date\r\nof muster-in.  One day, Colonel Corcoran explained this matter to\r\nme.  I advised him to reduce the facts to writing, and that I would\r\nsubmit it to the War Department for an authoritative decision.  He\r\ndid so, and the War Department decided that the muster-roll was the\r\nonly contract of service, that it would be construed literally; and\r\nthat the regiment would be held till the expiration of three months\r\nfrom the date of muster-in, viz., to about August 1, 1861.  General\r\nScott at the same time wrote one of his characteristic letters to\r\nCorcoran, telling him that we were about to engage in battle, and\r\nhe knew his Irish friends would not leave him in such a crisis.\r\nCorcoran and the officers generally wanted to go to the expected\r\nbattle, but a good many of the men were not so anxious.  In the\r\nSecond Wisconsin, also, was developed a personal difficulty.  The\r\nactual colonel was S. P. Coon, a good-hearted gentleman, who knew\r\nno more of the military art than a child; whereas his lieutenant-\r\ncolonel, Peck, had been to West Point, and knew the drill.\r\nPreferring that the latter should remain in command of the\r\nregiment, I put Colonel Coon on my personal staff, which reconciled\r\nthe difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn due season, about July 15th, our division moved forward\r\nleaving our camps standing; Keyes's brigade in the lead, then\r\nSchenck's, then mine, and Richardson's last.  We marched via\r\nVienna, Germantown, and Centreville, where all the army, composed\r\nof five divisions, seemed to converge.  The march demonstrated\r\nlittle save the general laxity of discipline; for with all my\r\npersonal efforts I could not prevent the men from straggling for\r\nwater, blackberries, or any thing on the way they fancied.\r\n\r\nAt Centreville, on the 18th, Richardson's brigade was sent by\r\nGeneral Tyler to reconnoitre Blackburn's Ford across Bull Run, and\r\nhe found it strongly guarded.  From our camp, at Centreville, we\r\nheard the cannonading, and then a sharp musketry-fire.  I received\r\norders from General Tyler to send forward Ayres's battery, and very\r\nsoon after another order came for me to advance with my whole\r\nbrigade.  We marched  the three miles at the double-quick, arrived\r\nin time to relieve Richardson's brigade, which was just drawing\r\nback from the ford, worsted, and stood for half an hour or so under\r\na fire of artillery, which killed four or five of my men.  General\r\nTyler was there in person, giving directions, and soon after\r\nhe ordered us all back to our camp in Centreville.  This\r\nreconnoissance had developed a strong force, and had been made\r\nwithout the orders of General McDowell; however, it satisfied us\r\nthat the enemy was in force on the other side of Bull Run, and had\r\nno intention to leave without a serious battle.  We lay in camp at\r\nCentreville all of the 19th and 20th, and during that night began\r\nthe movement which resulted in the battle of Bull Run, on July\r\n21st.  Of this so much has been written that more would be\r\nsuperfluous; and the reports of the opposing commanders, McDowell\r\nand Johnston, are fair and correct.  It is now generally admitted\r\nthat it was one of the best-planned battles of the war, but one of\r\nthe worst-fought.  Our men had been told so often at home that all\r\nthey had to do was to make a bold  appearance, and the rebels would\r\nrun; and nearly all of us for the first time then heard the sound\r\nof cannon and muskets in anger, and saw the bloody scenes common to\r\nall battles, with which we were soon to be familiar.  We had good\r\norganization, good men, but no cohesion, no real discipline, no\r\nrespect for authority, no real knowledge of war.  Both armies were\r\nfairly defeated, and, whichever had stood fast, the other would\r\nhave run.  Though the North was overwhelmed with mortification and\r\nshame, the South really had not much to boast of, for in the three\r\nor four hours of fighting their organization was so broken up that\r\nthey did not and could not follow our army, when it was known to be\r\nin a state of disgraceful and causeless flight.  It is easy to\r\ncriticise a battle after it is over, but all now admit that none\r\nothers, equally raw in war, could have done better than we did at\r\nBull Run; and the lesson of that battle should not be lost on a\r\npeople like ours.\r\n\r\nI insert my official report, as a condensed statement of my share\r\nin the battle:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS THIRD BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION\r\nFORT CORCORAN, July 25, 1861\r\n\r\nTo Captain A. BAIRD, Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division\r\n(General Tyler's).\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to submit this my report of the operations of\r\nmy brigade during the action of the 21st instant.  The brigade is\r\ncomposed of the Thirteenth New York Volunteers, Colonel Quinby's\r\nSixty-ninth New York, Colonel Corcoran; Seventy-ninth New York,\r\nColonel Cameron; Second Wisconsin, Lieutenant-Colonel Peck; and\r\nCompany E, Third Artillery, under command of Captain R. B. Ayres,\r\nFifth Artillery.\r\n\r\nWe left our camp near Centreville, pursuant to orders, at half-past\r\n2 A. M., taking place in your column, next to the brigade of\r\nGeneral Schenck, and proceeded as far as the halt, before the\r\nenemy's position, near the stone bridge across Bull Run.  Here the\r\nbrigade was deployed in line along the skirt of timber to the right\r\nof the Warrenton road, and remained quietly in position till after\r\n10 A.M.  The enemy remained very quiet, but about that time we saw\r\na rebel regiment leave its cover in our front, and proceed in\r\ndouble-quick time on the road toward Sudley Springs, by which we\r\nknew the columns of Colonels Hunter and Heintzelman were\r\napproaching.  About the same time we observed in motion a large\r\nmass of the enemy, below and on the other side of the stone bridge.\r\nI directed Captain Ayres to take position with his battery near our\r\nright, and to open fire on this mass; but you had previously\r\ndetached the two rifle-guns belonging to this battery, and, finding\r\nthat the smooth-bore guns did not reach the enemy's position, we\r\nceased firing, and I sent a request that you would send to me the\r\nthirty-pounder rifle-gun attached to Captain Carlisle's battery.\r\nAt the same time I shifted the New York Sixty-ninth to the extreme\r\nright of the brigade.  Thus we remained till we heard the\r\nmusketry-fire across Bull Run, showing that the head of Colonel\r\nHunter's column was engaged.  This firing was brisk, and showed that\r\nHunter was driving before him the enemy, till about noon, when it\r\nbecame certain the enemy had come to a stand, and that our forces on\r\nthe other side of Bull Run were all engaged, artillery and infantry.\r\n\r\nHere you sent me the order to cross over with the whole brigade, to\r\nthe assistance of Colonel Hunter.  Early in the day, when\r\nreconnoitring the ground, I had seen a horseman descend from a\r\nbluff in our front, cross the stream, and show himself in the open\r\nfield on this aide; and, inferring that we could cross over at the\r\nsame point, I sent forward a company as skirmishers, and followed\r\nwith the whole brigade, the New York Sixty-ninth leading.\r\n\r\nWe found no difficulty in crossing over, and met with no opposition\r\nin ascending the steep bluff opposite with our infantry, but it was\r\nimpassable to the artillery, and I sent word back to Captain Ayres\r\nto follow if possible, otherwise to use his discretion.  Captain\r\nAyres did not cross Bull Run, but remained on that side, with the\r\nrest of your division.  His report herewith describes his\r\noperations during the remainder of the day.  Advancing slowly and\r\ncautiously with the head of the column, to give time for the\r\nregiments in succession to close up their ranks, we first\r\nencountered a party of the enemy retreating along a cluster of\r\npines; Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty, of the Sixty-ninth, without\r\norders, rode out alone, and endeavored to intercept their retreat.\r\nOne of the enemy, in full view, at short range, shot Haggerty, and\r\nhe fell dead from his horse.  The Sixty-ninth opened fire on this\r\nparty, which was returned; but, determined to effect our junction\r\nwith Hunter's division, I ordered this fire to cease, and we\r\nproceeded with caution toward the field where we then plainly saw\r\nour forces engaged.  Displaying our colors conspicuously at the\r\nhead of our column, we succeeded in attracting the attention of our\r\nfriends, and soon formed the brigade in rear of Colonel Porter's.\r\nHere I learned that Colonel Hunter was disabled by a severe wound,\r\nand that General McDowell was on the field.  I sought him out, and\r\nreceived his orders to join in pursuit of the enemy, who was\r\nfalling back to the left of the road by which the army had\r\napproached from Sudley Springs.  Placing Colonel Quinby's regiment\r\nof rifles in front, in column, by division, I directed the other\r\nregiments to follow in line of battle, in the order of the\r\nWisconsin Second, New York Seventy-ninth, and New York Sixty-ninth.\r\nQuinby's regiment advanced steadily down the hill and up the ridge,\r\nfrom which he opened fire upon the enemy, who had made another\r\nstand on ground very favorable to him, and the regiment continued\r\nadvancing as the enemy gave way, till the head of the column\r\nreached the point near which Rickett's battery was so severely cut\r\nup.  The other regiments descended the hill in line of battle,\r\nunder a severe cannonade; and, the ground affording comparative\r\nshelter from the enemy's artillery, they changed direction, by the\r\nright flank, and followed the road before mentioned.  At the point\r\nwhere this road crosses the ridge to our left front, the ground was\r\nswept by a most severe fire of artillery, rifles, and musketry, and\r\nwe saw, in succession, several regiments driven from it; among them\r\nthe Zouaves and battalion of marines.  Before reaching the crest of\r\nthis hill, the roadway was worn deep enough to afford shelter, and\r\nI kept the several regiments in it as long as possible; but when\r\nthe Wisconsin Second was abreast of the enemy, by order of Major\r\nWadsworth, of General McDowell's staff, I ordered it to leave the\r\nroadway, by the left flank, and to attack the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis regiment ascended to the brow of the hill steadily, received\r\nthe severe fire of the enemy, returned it with spirit, and\r\nadvanced, delivering its fire.  This regiment is uniformed in gray\r\ncloth, almost identical with that of the great bulk of the\r\nsecession army; and, when the regiment fell into confusion and\r\nretreated toward the road, there was a universal cry that they were\r\nbeing fired on by our own men.  The regiment rallied again, passed\r\nthe brow of the hill a second time, but was again repulsed in\r\ndisorder.  By this time the New York Seventy-ninth had closed up,\r\nand in like manner it was ordered to cross the brow of, the hill,\r\nand drive the enemy from cover.  It was impossible to get a good\r\nview of this ground.  In it there was one battery of artillery,\r\nwhich poured an incessant fire upon our advancing column, and the\r\nground was very irregular with small clusters of pines, affording\r\nshelter, of which the enemy took good advantage.  The fire of\r\nrifles and musketry was very severe.  The Seventy-ninth, headed by\r\nits colonel, Cameron, charged across the hill, and for a short time\r\nthe contest was severe; they rallied several times under fire, but\r\nfinally broke, and gained the cover of the hill.\r\n\r\nThis left the field open to the New York Sixty-ninth, Colonel\r\nCorcoran, who, in his turn, led his regiment over the crest; and\r\nhad in full, open view the ground so severely contested; the fire\r\nwas very severe, and the roar of cannon, musketry, and rifles,\r\nincessant; it was manifest the enemy was here in great force, far\r\nsuperior to us at that point.  The Sixty-ninth held the ground for\r\nsome time, but finally fell back in disorder.\r\n\r\nAll this time Quinby's regiment occupied another ridge, to our\r\nleft, overlooking the same field of action, and similarly engaged.\r\nHere, about half-past 3 p.m., began the scene of confusion and\r\ndisorder that characterized the remainder of the day.  Up to that\r\ntime, all had kept their places, and seemed perfectly cool, and\r\nused to the shell and shot that fell, comparatively harmless, all\r\naround us; but the short exposure to an intense fire of small-arms,\r\nat close range, had killed many, wounded more, and had produced\r\ndisorder in all of the battalions that had attempted to encounter\r\nit.  Men fell away from their ranks, talking, and in great\r\nconfusion.  Colonel Cameron had been mortally wounded, was carried\r\nto an ambulance, and reported dying.  Many other officers were\r\nreported dead or missing, and many of the wounded were making their\r\nway, with more or less assistance, to the buildings used as\r\nhospitals, on the ridge to the west.  We succeeded in partially\r\nreforming the regiments, but it was manifest that they would not\r\nstand, and I directed Colonel Corcoran to move along the ridge to\r\nthe rear, near the position where we had first formed the brigade.\r\nGeneral McDowell was there in person, and need all possible efforts\r\nto reassure the men.  By the active exertions of Colonel Corcoran,\r\nwe formed an irregular square against the cavalry which were then\r\nseen to issue from the position from which we had been driven, and\r\nwe began our retreat toward the same ford of Bull Run by which we\r\nhad approached the field of battle.  There was no positive order to\r\nretreat, although for an hour it had been going on by the operation\r\nof the men themselves.  The ranks were thin and irregular, and we\r\nfound a stream of people strung from the hospital across Bull Run,\r\nand far toward Centreville.  After putting in motion the irregular\r\nsquare in person, I pushed forward to find Captain Ayres's battery\r\nat the crossing of Bull Run.  I sought it at its last position,\r\nbefore the brigade had crossed over, but it was not there; then\r\npassing through the woods, where, in the morning, we had first\r\nformed line, we approached the blacksmith's shop, but there found a\r\ndetachment of the secession cavalry and thence made a circuit,\r\navoiding Cub Run Bridge, into Centreville, where I found General\r\nMcDowell, and from him understood that it was his purpose to rally\r\nthe forces, and make a stand at Centreville.\r\n\r\nBut, about nine o'clock at night, I received from General Tyler, in\r\nperson, the order to continue the retreat to the Potomac.  This\r\nretreat was by night, and disorderly in the extreme.  The men of\r\ndifferent regiments mingled together, and some reached the river at\r\nArlington, some at Long Bridge, and the greater part returned to\r\ntheir former camp, at or near Fort Corcoran.  I reached this point\r\nat noon the next day, and found a miscellaneous crowd crossing over\r\nthe aqueduct and ferries..  Conceiving this to be demoralizing, I\r\nat once commanded the guard to be increased, and all persons\r\nattempting to pass over to be stopped.  This soon produced its\r\neffect; men sought their proper companies and regiments.\r\nComparative order was restored, and all were posted to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nI herewith inclose the official report of Captain Belly, commanding\r\nofficer of the New York Sixty-ninth; also, fall lists of the\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing.\r\n\r\nOur loss was heavy, and occurred chiefly at the point near where\r\nRickett's battery was destroyed.  Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty was\r\nkilled about noon, before we had effected a junction with Colonel\r\nHunter's division.  Colonel Cameron was mortally wounded leading\r\nhis regiment in the charge, and Colonel Corcoran has been missing\r\nsince the cavalry-charge near the building used as a hospital.\r\n\r\nFor names, rank, etc., of the above, I refer to the lists herewith.\r\n\r\nLieutenants Piper and McQuesten, of my personal staff, were under\r\nfire all day, and carried orders to and fro with as much coolness\r\nas on parade.  Lieutenant Bagley, of the New York Sixty-ninth, a\r\nvolunteer aide, asked leave to serve with his company, during the\r\naction, and is among those reported missing.  I have intelligence\r\nthat he is a prisoner, and slightly wounded.\r\n\r\nColonel Coon, of Wisconsin, a volunteer aide, also rendered good\r\nservice during the day.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Colonel commanding Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis report, which I had not read probably since its date till now,\r\nrecalls to me vividly the whole scene of the affair at Blackburn's\r\nFord, when for the first time in my life I saw cannonballs strike\r\nmen and crash through the trees and saplings above and around us,\r\nand realized the always sickening confusion as one approaches a\r\nfight from the rear; then the night-march from Centreville, on the\r\nWarrenton road, standing for hours wondering what was meant; the\r\ndeployment along the edge of the field that sloped down to\r\nBull-Run, and waiting for Hunter's approach on the other aide from\r\nthe direction of Sudley Springs, away off to our right; the\r\nterrible scare of a poor negro who was caught between our lines;\r\nthe crossing of Bull Run, and the fear lest we should be fired on\r\nby our own men; the killing of Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty, which\r\noccurred in plain sight; and the first scenes of a field strewed\r\nwith dead men and horses.  Yet, at that period of the battle, we\r\nwere the victors and felt jubilant.  At that moment, also, my\r\nbrigade passed Hunter's division; but Heintzelman's was still ahead\r\nof us, and we followed its lead along the road toward Manassas\r\nJunction, crossing a small stream and ascending a long hill, at the\r\nsummit of which the battle was going on.  Here my regiments came\r\ninto action well, but successively, and were driven back, each in\r\nits turn.  For two hours we continued to dash at the woods on our\r\nleft front, which were full of rebels; but I was convinced their\r\norganization was broken, and that they had simply halted there and\r\ntaken advantage of these woods as a cover, to reach which we had to\r\npass over the intervening fields about the Henry House, which were\r\nclear, open, and gave them a decided advantage.  After I had put in\r\neach of my regiments, and had them driven back to the cover of the\r\nroad, I had no idea that we were beaten, but reformed the regiments\r\nin line in their proper order, and only wanted a little rest, when\r\nI found that my brigade was almost alone, except Syke's regulars,\r\nwho had formed square against cavalry and were coming back.  I then\r\nrealized that the whole army was \"in retreat,\" and that my own men\r\nwere individually making back for the stone bridge.  Corcoran and I\r\nformed the brigade into an irregular square, but it fell to pieces;\r\nand, along with a crowd, disorganized but not much scared, the\r\nbrigade got back to Centreville to our former camps.  Corcoran was\r\ncaptured, and held a prisoner for some time; but I got safe to\r\nCentreville.  I saw General McDowell in Centreville, and understood\r\nthat several of his divisions had not been engaged at all, that he\r\nwould reorganize them at Centreville, and there await the enemy.  I\r\ngot my four regiments in parallel lines in a field, the same in\r\nwhich we had camped before the battle, and had lain down to sleep\r\nunder a tree, when I heard some one asking for me.  I called out\r\nwhere I was, when General Tyler in person gave me orders to march\r\nback to our camps at Fort Corcoran.  I aroused my aides, gave them\r\norders to call up the sleeping men, have each regiment to leave the\r\nfield by a flank and to take the same road back by which we had\r\ncome.  It was near midnight, and the road was full of troops,\r\nwagons, and batteries.  We tried to keep our regiments separate,\r\nbut all became inextricably mixed.  Toward morning we reached\r\nVienna, where I slept some hours, and the next day, about noon, we\r\nreached Fort Corcoran.\r\n\r\nA slow, mizzling rain had set in, and probably a more gloomy day\r\nnever presented itself.  All organization seemed to be at an end;\r\nbut I and my staff labored hard to collect our men into their\r\nproper companies and into their former camps, and, on the 23d of\r\nJuly, I moved the Second Wisconsin and Seventy-ninth New York\r\ncloser in to Fort Corcoran, and got things in better order than I\r\nhad expected.  Of course, we took it for granted that the rebels\r\nwould be on our heels, and we accordingly prepared to defend our\r\nposts.  By the 25th I had collected all the materials, made my\r\nreport, and had my brigade about as well governed as any in that\r\narmy; although most of the ninety-day men, especially the\r\nSixty-ninth, had become extremely tired of the war, and wanted to\r\ngo home.  Some of them were so mutinous, at one time, that I had\r\nthe battery to unlimber, threatening, if they dared to leave camp\r\nwithout orders, I would open fire on them.  Drills and the daily\r\nexercises were resumed, and I ordered that at the three principal\r\nroll-calls the men should form ranks with belts and muskets, and\r\nthat they should keep their ranks until I in person had received\r\nthe reports and had dismissed them.  The Sixty-ninth still occupied\r\nFort Corcoran, and one morning, after reveille, when I had just\r\nreceived the report, had dismissed the regiment, and was leaving, I\r\nfound myself in a crowd of men crossing the drawbridge on their way\r\nto a barn close by, where they had their sinks; among them was an\r\nofficer, who said: \"Colonel, I am going to New York today.  What\r\ncan I do for you?\" I answered: \"How can you go to New York? I do\r\nnot remember to have signed a leave for you.\"  He said, \"No; he did\r\nnot want a leave.  He had engaged to serve three months, and had\r\nalready served more than that time.  If the Government did not\r\nintend to pay him, he could afford to lose the money; that he was a\r\nlawyer, and had neglected his business long enough, and was then\r\ngoing home.\"  I noticed that a good many of the soldiers had paused\r\nabout us to listen, and knew that, if this officer could defy me,\r\nthey also would.  So I turned on him sharp, and said: \"Captain,\r\nthis question of your term of service has been submitted to the\r\nrightful authority, and the decision has been published in orders.\r\nYou are a soldier, and must submit to orders till you are properly\r\ndischarged.  If you attempt to leave without orders, it will be\r\nmutiny, and I will shoot you like a dog!  Go back into the fort\r\nnow, instantly, and don't dare to leave without my consent.\"  I had\r\non an overcoat, and may have had my hand about the breast, for he\r\nlooked at me hard, paused a moment, and then turned back into the\r\nfort.  The men scattered, and I returned to the house where I was\r\nquartered, close by.\r\n\r\nThat same day, which must have been about July 26th, I was near the\r\nriver-bank, looking at a block-house which had been built for the\r\ndefense of the aqueduct, when I saw a carriage coming by the road\r\nthat crossed the Potomac River at Georgetown by a ferry.  I thought\r\nI recognized in the carriage the person of President Lincoln.  I\r\nhurried across a bend, so as to stand by the road-side as the\r\ncarriage passed.  I was in uniform, with a sword on, and was\r\nrecognized by Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward, who rode side by side in\r\nan open hack.  I inquired if they were going to my camps, and Mr.\r\nLincoln said: \"Yes; we heard that you had got over the big scare,\r\nand we thought we would come over and see the 'boys.'\"  The roads\r\nhad been much changed and were rough.  I asked if I might give\r\ndirections to his coachman, he promptly invited me to jump in and\r\nto tell the coachman which way to drive.  Intending to begin on the\r\nright and follow round to the left, I turned the driver into a\r\nside-road which led up a very steep hill, and, seeing a soldier,\r\ncalled to him and sent him up hurriedly to announce to the colonel\r\n(Bennett, I think) that the President was coming: As we slowly\r\nascended the hill, I discovered that Mr. Lincoln was full of\r\nfeeling, and wanted to encourage our men.  I asked if he intended\r\nto speak to them, and he said he would like to.  I asked him then\r\nto please discourage all cheering, noise, or any sort of confusion;\r\nthat we had had enough of it before Bull Run to ruin any set of\r\nmen, and that what we needed were cool, thoughtful, hard-fighting\r\nsoldiers--no more hurrahing, no more humbug.  He took my remarks in\r\nthe most perfect good-nature.  Before we had reached the first\r\ncamp, I heard the drum beating the \"assembly,\" saw the men running\r\nfor their tents, and in a few minutes the regiment was in line,\r\narms presented, and then brought to an order and \"parade rest!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln stood up in the carriage, and made one of the neatest,\r\nbest, and most feeling addresses I ever listened to, referring to\r\nour late disaster at Bull Run, the high duties that still devolved\r\non us, and the brighter days yet to come.  At one or two points the\r\nsoldiers began to cheer, but he promptly checked them, saying:\r\n\"Don't cheer, boys.  I confess I rather like it myself, but Colonel\r\nSherman here says it is not military; and I guess we had better\r\ndefer to his opinion.\"  In winding up, he explained that, as\r\nPresident, he was commander-in-chief; that he was resolved that the\r\nsoldiers should have every thing that the law allowed; and he\r\ncalled on one and all to appeal to him personally in case they were\r\nwronged.  The effect of this speech was excellent.\r\n\r\nWe passed along in the same manner to all the camps of my brigade;\r\nand Mr. Lincoln complimented me highly for the order, cleanliness,\r\nand discipline, that he observed.  Indeed, he and Mr. Seward both\r\nassured me that it was the first bright moment they had experienced\r\nsince the battle.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached Fort Corcoran.  The carriage could not enter, so\r\nI ordered the regiment, without arms, to come outside, and gather\r\nabout Mr. Lincoln, who would speak to them.  He made to them the\r\nsame feeling address, with more personal allusions, because of\r\ntheir special gallantry in the battle under Corcoran, who was still\r\na prisoner in the hands of the enemy; and he concluded with the\r\nsame general offer of redress in case of grievances. In the crowd I\r\nsaw the officer with whom I had had the passage at reveille that\r\nmorning.  His face was pale, and lips compressed.  I foresaw a\r\nscene, but sat on the front seat of the carriage as quiet as a\r\nlamb.  This officer forced his way through the crowd to the\r\ncarriage, and said: \"Mr. President, I have a cause of grievance.\r\nThis morning I went to speak to Colonel Sherman, and he threatened\r\nto shoot me.\"  Mr. Lincoln, who was still standing, said,\r\n\"Threatened to shoot you?\"  \"Yes, sir, he threatened to shoot me.\"\r\nMr. Lincoln looked at him, then at me, and stooping his tall, spare\r\nform toward the officer, said to him in a loud stage-whisper,\r\neasily heard for some yards around: \"Well, if I were you, and he\r\nthreatened to shoot, I would not trust him, for I believe he would\r\ndo it.\"  The officer turned about and disappeared, and the men\r\nlaughed at him.  Soon the carriage drove on, and, as we descended\r\nthe hill, I explained the facts to the President, who answered, \"Of\r\ncourse I didn't know any thing about it, but I thought you knew\r\nyour own business best.\"  I thanked him for his confidence, and\r\nassured him that what he had done would go far to enable me to\r\nmaintain good discipline, and it did.\r\n\r\nBy this time the day was well spent.  I asked to take my leave, and\r\nthe President and Mr. Seward drove back to Washington.  This spirit\r\nof mutiny was common to the whole army, and was not subdued till\r\nseveral regiments or parts of regiments had been ordered to Fort\r\nJefferson, Florida, as punishment.\r\n\r\nGeneral McDowell had resumed his headquarters at the Arlington\r\nHouse, and was busily engaged in restoring order to his army,\r\nsending off the ninety-days men, and replacing them by regiments\r\nwhich had come under the three-years call.  We were all trembling\r\nlest we should be held personally accountable for the disastrous\r\nresult of the battle.  General McClellan had been summoned from the\r\nWest to Washington, and changes in the subordinate commands were\r\nannounced almost daily.  I remember, as a group of officers were\r\ntalking in the large room of the Arlington House, used as the\r\nadjutant-general's office, one evening, some young officer came in\r\nwith a list of the new brigadiers just announced at the War\r\nDepartment, which-embraced the names of Heintzehvan, Keyes,\r\nFranklin, Andrew Porter, W. T. Sherman, and others, who had been\r\ncolonels in the battle, and all of whom had shared the common\r\nstampede.  Of course, we discredited the truth of the list; and\r\nHeintzehvan broke out in his nasal voice, \"Boys, it's all a lie!\r\nevery mother's son of you will be cashiered.\"  We all felt he was\r\nright, but, nevertheless, it was true; and we were all announced in\r\ngeneral orders as brigadier-generals of volunteers.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan arrived, and, on assuming command, confirmed\r\nMcDowell's organization.  Instead of coming over the river, as we\r\nexpected, he took a house in Washington, and only came over from\r\ntime to time to have a review or inspection.\r\n\r\nI had received several new regiments, and had begun two new forts\r\non the hill or plateau, above and farther out than Fort Corcoran;\r\nand I organized a system of drills, embracing the evolutions of the\r\nline, all of which was new to me, and I had to learn the tactics\r\nfrom books; but I was convinced that we had a long, hard war before\r\nus, and made up my mind to begin at the very beginning to prepare\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nAugust was passing, and troops were pouring in from all quarters;\r\nGeneral McClellan told me he intended to organize an army of a\r\nhundred thousand men, with one hundred field-batteries, and I still\r\nhoped he would come on our side of the Potomac, pitch his tent, and\r\nprepare for real hard work, but his headquarters still remained in\r\na house in Washington City.  I then thought, and still think, that\r\nwas a fatal mistake.  His choice as general-in-chief at the time\r\nwas fully justified by his high reputation in the army and country,\r\nand, if he then had any political views or ambition, I surely did\r\nnot suspect it.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of August I got a note from Brigadier-General\r\nRobert Anderson, asking me to come and see him at his room at\r\nWillard's Hotel.  I rode over and found him in conversation with\r\nseveral gentlemen, and he explained to me that events in Kentucky\r\nwere approaching a crisis; that the Legislature was in session, and\r\nready, as soon as properly backed by the General Government, to\r\ntake open sides for the Union cause; that he was offered the\r\ncommand of the Department of the Cumberland, to embrace Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, etc., and that he wanted help, and that the President\r\nhad offered to allow him to select out of the new brigadiers four\r\nof his own choice.  I had been a lieutenant in Captain Anderson's\r\ncompany, at Fort Moultrie, from 1843 to 1846, and he explained that\r\nhe wanted me as his right hand.  He also indicated George H.\r\nThomas, D. C. Buell, and Burnside, as the other three.  Of course,\r\nI always wanted to go West, and was perfectly willing to go with\r\nAnderson, especially in a subordinate capacity: We agreed to call\r\non the President on a subsequent day, to talk with him about it,\r\nand we did.  It hardly seems probable that Mr. Lincoln should have\r\ncome to Willard's Hotel to meet us, but my impression is that he\r\ndid, and that General Anderson had some difficulty in prevailing on\r\nhim to appoint George H. Thomas, a native of Virginia, to be\r\nbrigadier-general, because so many Southern officers, had already\r\nplayed false; but I was still more emphatic in my indorsement of\r\nhim by reason of my talk with him at the time he crossed the\r\nPotomac with Patterson's army, when Mr. Lincoln promised to appoint\r\nhim and to assign him to duty with General Anderson.  In this\r\ninterview with Mr. Lincoln, I also explained to him my extreme\r\ndesire to serve in a subordinate capacity, and in no event to be\r\nleft in a superior command.  He promised me this with promptness,\r\nmaking the jocular remark that his chief trouble was to find places\r\nfor the too many generals who wanted to be at the head of affairs,\r\nto command armies, etc.\r\n\r\nThe official order is dated:\r\n\r\n[Special Order No. 114.]\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWashington, August 24, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe following assignment is made of the general officers of the\r\nvolunteer service, whose appointment was announced in General\r\nOrders No. 82, from the War Department\r\n\r\nTo the Department of the Cumberland, Brigadier-General Robert\r\nAnderson commanding:\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General W. T. Sherman,\r\nBrigadier-General George H. Thomas.\r\n\r\nBy command of Lieutenant-General Scott:\r\nE. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter some days, I was relieved in command of my brigade and post\r\nby Brigadier General Fitz-John Porter, and at once took my\r\ndeparture for Cincinnati, Ohio, via Cresson, Pennsylvania, where\r\nGeneral Anderson was with his family; and he, Thomas, and I, met by\r\nappointment at the house of his brother, Larz Anderson, Esq., in\r\nCincinnati.  We were there on the 1st and 2d of September, when\r\nseveral prominent gentlemen of Kentucky met us, to discuss the\r\nsituation, among whom were Jackson, Harlan, Speed, and others.  At\r\nthat time, William Nelson, an officer of the navy, had been\r\ncommissioned a brigadier-general of volunteers, and had his camp at\r\nDick Robinson, a few miles beyond the Kentucky River, south of\r\nNicholasville; and Brigadier-General L. H. Rousseau had another\r\ncamp at Jeffersonville, opposite Louisville.  The State Legislature\r\nwas in session at Frankfort, and was ready to take definite action\r\nas soon as General Anderson was prepared, for the State was\r\nthreatened with invasion from Tennessee, by two forces: one from\r\nthe direction of Nashville, commanded by Generals Albert Sidney\r\nJohnston and Buckner; and the other from the direction of\r\nCumberland Gap, commanded by Generals Crittenden and Zollicoffer.\r\nGeneral Anderson saw that he had not force enough to resist these\r\ntwo columns, and concluded to send me in person for help to\r\nIndianapolis and Springfield, to confer with the Governors of\r\nIndiana, and Illinois, and to General Fremont, who commanded in St.\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nMcClellan and Fremont were the two men toward whom the country\r\nlooked as the great Union leaders, and toward them were streaming\r\nthe newly-raised regiments of infantry and cavalry, and batteries\r\nof artillery; nobody seeming to think of the intervening link\r\ncovered by Kentucky.  While I was to make this tour, Generals\r\nAnderson and Thomas were to go to Louisville and initiate the\r\ndepartment.  None of us had a staff, or any of the machinery for\r\norganizing an army, and, indeed, we had no army to organize.\r\nAnderson was empowered to raise regiments in Kentucky, and to\r\ncommission a few brigadier-generals.\r\n\r\nAt Indianapolis I found Governor Morton and all the State officials\r\nbusy in equipping and providing for the new regiments, and my\r\nobject was to divert some of them toward Kentucky; but they were\r\ncalled for as fast as they were mustered in, either for the army of\r\nMcClellan or Fremont.  At Springfield also I found the same general\r\nactivity and zeal, Governor Yates busy in providing for his men;\r\nbut these men also had been promised to Fremont.  I then went on to\r\nSt. Louis, where all was seeming activity, bustle, and preparation.\r\nMeeting R. M. Renick at the Planters' House (where I stopped), I\r\ninquired where I could find General Fremont.  Renick said, \"What do\r\nyou want with General Fremont?\"  I said I had come to see him on\r\nbusiness; and he added, \"You don't suppose that he will see such as\r\nyou?\" and went on to retail all the scandal of the day: that Fremont\r\nwas a great potentate, surrounded by sentries and guards; that he\r\nhad a more showy court than any real king; that he kept senators,\r\ngovernors, and the first citizens, dancing attendance for days and\r\nweeks before granting an audience, etc.; that if I expected to see\r\nhim on business, I would have to make my application in writing,\r\nand submit to a close scrutiny by his chief of staff and by his\r\ncivil surroundings.  Of course I laughed at all this, and renewed\r\nmy simple inquiry as to where was his office, and was informed that\r\nhe resided and had his office at Major Brant's new house on\r\nChouteau Avenue.  It was then late in the afternoon, and I\r\nconcluded to wait till the next morning; but that night I received\r\na dispatch from General Anderson in Louisville to hurry back, as\r\nevents were pressing, and he needed me.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I rose early next morning before daybreak, got\r\nbreakfast with the early railroad-passengers, and about sunrise was\r\nat the gate of General Fremont's headquarters.  A sentinel with\r\ndrawn sabre paraded up and down in front of the house.  I had on my\r\nundress uniform indicating my rank, and inquired of the sentinel,\r\n\"Is General Fremont up?\"  He answered, \"I don't know.\"  Seeing that\r\nhe was a soldier by his bearing, I spoke in a sharp, emphatic\r\nvoice, \"Then find out.\"  He called for the corporal of the guard,\r\nand soon a fine-looking German sergeant came, to whom I addressed\r\nthe same inquiry.  He in turn did not know, and I bade him find\r\nout, as I had immediate and important business with the general.\r\nThe sergeant entered the house by the front-basement door, and\r\nafter ten or fifteen minutes the main front-door above was slowly\r\nopened from the inside, and who should appear but my old San\r\nFrancisco acquaintance Isaiah C. Woods, whom I had not seen or\r\nheard of since his flight to Australia, at the time of the failure\r\nof Adams & Co. in 1851!  He ushered me in hastily, closed the door,\r\nand conducted me into the office on the right of the hall.  We were\r\nglad to meet, after so long and eventful an interval, and mutually\r\ninquired after our respective families and special acquaintances.\r\nI found that he was a commissioned officer, a major on duty with\r\nFremont, and Major Eaton, now of the paymaster's Department, was in\r\nthe same office with him.  I explained to them that I had come from\r\nGeneral Anderson, and wanted to confer with General Fremont in\r\nperson.  Woods left me, but soon returned, said the general would\r\nsee me in a very few minutes, and within ten minutes I was shown\r\nacross the hall into the large parlor, where General Fremont\r\nreceived me very politely.  We had met before, as early as 1847, in\r\nCalifornia, and I had also seen him several times when he was\r\nsenator.  I then in a rapid manner ran over all the points of\r\ninterest in General Anderson's new sphere of action, hoped he would\r\nspare us from the new levies what troops he could, and generally\r\nact in concert with us.  He told me that his first business would\r\nbe to drive the rebel General Price and his army out of Missouri,\r\nwhen he would turn his attention down the Mississippi.  He asked my\r\nopinion about the various kinds of field-artillery which\r\nmanufacturers were thrusting on him, especially the then\r\nnewly-invented James gun, and afterward our conversation took a wide\r\nturn about the character of the principal citizens of St. Louis,\r\nwith whom I was well acquainted.\r\n\r\nTelling General Fremont that I had been summoned to Louisville and\r\nthat I should leave in the first train, viz., at 3 p.m., I took my\r\nleave of him.  Returning to Wood's office, I found there two more\r\nCalifornians, viz., Messrs.  Palmer and Haskell, so I felt that,\r\nwhile Fremont might be suspicious of others, he allowed free\r\ningress to his old California acquaintances.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Planters' House, I heard of Beard, another\r\nCalifornian, a Mormon, who had the contract for the line of\r\nredoubts which Fremont had ordered to be constructed around the\r\ncity, before he would take his departure for the interior of the\r\nState; and while I stood near the office-counter, I saw old Baron\r\nSteinberger, a prince among our early California adventurers, come\r\nin and look over the register.  I avoided him on purpose, but his\r\npresence in St. Louis recalled the maxim, \"Where the vultures are,\r\nthere is a carcass close by;\" and I suspected that the profitable\r\ncontracts of the quartermaster, McKinstry, had drawn to St. Louis\r\nsome of the most enterprising men of California.  I suspect they\r\ncan account for the fact that, in a very short time, Fremont fell\r\nfrom his high estate in Missouri, by reason of frauds, or supposed\r\nfrauds, in the administration of the affairs of his command.\r\n\r\nI left St. Louis that afternoon and reached Louisville the next\r\nmorning.  I found General Anderson quartered at the Louisville\r\nHotel, and he had taken a dwelling homes on ______ Street as an\r\noffice.  Captain O. D. Greens was his adjutant-general, Lieutenant\r\nThrockmorton his aide, and Captain Prime, of the Engineer Corps,\r\nwas on duty with him.  General George H. Thomas had been dispatched\r\nto camp Dick Robinson, to relieve Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe city was full of all sorts of rumors.  The Legislature, moved\r\nby considerations purely of a political nature, had taken the step,\r\nwhatever it was, that amounted to an adherence to the Union,\r\ninstead of joining the already-seceded States.  This was\r\nuniversally known to be the signal for action.  For it we were\r\nutterly unprepared, whereas the rebels were fully prepared.\r\nGeneral Sidney Johnston immediately crossed into Kentucky, and\r\nadvanced as far as Bowling Green, which he began to fortify, and\r\nthence dispatched General Buckner with a division forward toward\r\nLouisville; General Zollicoffer, in like manner, entered the State\r\nand advanced as far as Somerset.  On the day I reached Louisville\r\nthe excitement ran high.  It was known that Columbus, Kentucky, had\r\nbeen occupied, September 7th, by a strong rebel force, under\r\nGenerals Pillow and Polk, and that General Grant had moved from\r\nCairo and occupied Paducah in force on the 6th.  Many of the rebel\r\nfamilies expected Buckner to reach Louisville at any moment.  That\r\nnight, General Anderson sent for me, and I found with him Mr.\r\nGuthrie, president of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, who had\r\nin his hands a dispatch to the effect that the bridge across the\r\nRolling Fork of Salt Creek, less than thirty miles out, had been\r\nburned, and that Buckner's force, en route for Louisville, had been\r\ndetained beyond Green River by a train thrown from the track.  We\r\nlearned afterward that a man named Bird had displaced a rail on\r\npurpose to throw the train off the track, and thereby give us time.\r\n\r\nMr. Guthrie explained that in the ravine just beyond Salt Creek\r\nwere several high and important trestles which, if destroyed, would\r\ntake months to replace, and General Anderson thought it well.\r\nworth the effort to save them.  Also, on Muldraugh's Hill beyond,\r\nwas a strong position, which had in former years been used as the\r\nsite for the State \"Camp of Instruction,\" and we all supposed that\r\nGeneral Buckner, who was familiar with the ground, was aiming for a\r\nposition there, from which to operate on Louisville.\r\n\r\nAll the troops we had to counteract Buckner were Rousseau's Legion,\r\nand a few Home Guards in Louisville.  The former were still\r\nencamped across the river at Jeffersonville; so General Anderson\r\nordered me to go over, and with them, and such Home Guards as we\r\ncould collect, make the effort to secure possession of Muldraugh's\r\nHill before Buckner could reach it.  I took Captain Prime with me;\r\nand crossed over to Rousseau's camp.  The long-roll was beaten, and\r\nwithin an hour the men, to the number of about one thousand, were\r\nmarching for the ferry-boat and for the Nashville depot.  Meantime\r\nGeneral Anderson had sent to collect some Home Guards, and Mr.\r\nGuthrie to get the trains ready.  It was after midnight before we\r\nbegan to move.  The trains proceeded slowly, and it was daybreak\r\nwhen we reached Lebanon Junction, twenty-six miles out, where we\r\ndisembarked, and marched to the bridge over Salt River, which we\r\nfound had been burnt; whether to prevent Buckner coming into\r\nLouisville, or us from going out, was not clear.  Rousseau's Legion\r\nforded the stream and marched up to the State Camp of Instruction,\r\nfinding the high trestles all secure.  The railroad hands went to\r\nwork at once to rebuild the bridge.  I remained a couple of days at\r\nLebanon Junction, during which General Anderson forwarded two\r\nregiments of volunteers that had come to him.  Before the bridge\r\nwas done we  advanced the whole camp to the summit of Muldraugh's\r\nHill, just back of Elizabethtown.  There I learned definitely that\r\nGeneral Buckner had not crossed Green River at all, that General\r\nSidney Johnston was fortifying Bowling Green, and preparing for a\r\nsystematic advance into Kentucky, of which he was a native, and\r\nwith whose people and geography he must have been familiar.  As\r\nfast as fresh troops reached Louisville, they were sent out to me\r\nat Muldraugh's Hill, where I was endeavoring to put them into shape\r\nfor service, and by the 1st of October I had the equivalent of a\r\ndivision of two brigades preparing to move forward toward Green\r\nRiver.  The daily correspondence between General Anderson and\r\nmyself satisfied me that the worry and harassment at Louisville\r\nwere exhausting his strength and health, and that he would soon\r\nleave.  On a telegraphic summons from him, about the 5th of\r\nOctober, I went down to Louisville, when General Anderson said he\r\ncould not stand the mental torture of his command any longer, and\r\nthat he must go away, or it would kill him.  On the 8th of October\r\nhe actually published an order relinquishing the command, and, by\r\nreason of my seniority, I had no alternative but to assume command,\r\nthough much against the grain, and in direct violation of Mr.\r\nLincoln's promise to me.  I am certain that, in my earliest\r\ncommunication to the War Department, I renewed the expression of my\r\nwish to remain in a subordinate position, and that I received the\r\nassurance that Brigadier-General Buell would soon arrive from\r\nCalifornia, and would be sent to relieve me.  By that time I had\r\nbecome pretty familiar with the geography and the general resources\r\nof Kentucky.  We had parties all over the State raising regiments\r\nand companies; but it was manifest that the young men were\r\ngenerally inclined to the cause of the South, while the older men\r\nof property wanted to be let alone--i.e., to remain neutral.  As to\r\na forward movement that fall, it was simply impracticable; for we\r\nwere forced to use divergent lines, leading our columns farther and\r\nfarther apart; and all I could attempt was to go on and collect\r\nforce and material at the two points already chosen, viz., Dick\r\nRobinson and Elizabethtown.  General George H. Thomas still\r\ncontinued to command the former, and on the 12th of October I\r\ndispatched Brigadier-General A. McD. McCook to command the latter,\r\nwhich had been moved forward to Nolin Creek, fifty-two miles out of\r\nLouisville, toward Bowling Green.  Staff-officers began to arrive\r\nto relieve us of the constant drudgery which, up to that time, had\r\nbeen forced on General Anderson and myself; and these were all good\r\nmen.  Colonel Thomas Swords, quartermaster, arrived on the 13th;\r\nPaymaster Larned on the 14th; and Lieutenant Smyzer, Fifth\r\nArtillery, acting ordnance-officer, on the 20th; Captain Symonds\r\nwas already on duty as the commissary of subsistence; Captain O.\r\nD. Greene was the adjutant-general, and completed a good working\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nThe everlasting worry of citizens complaining of every petty\r\ndelinquency of a soldier, and forcing themselves forward to discuss\r\npolitics, made the position of a commanding general no sinecure.  I\r\ncontinued to strengthen the two corps forward and their routes of\r\nsupply; all the time expecting that Sidney Johnston, who was a real\r\ngeneral, and who had as correct information of our situation as I\r\nhad, would unite his force with Zollicoffer, and fall on Thomas at\r\nDick Robinson, or McCook at Nolin: Had he done so in October, 1861,\r\nhe could have walked into Louisville, and the vital part of the\r\npopulation would have hailed him as a deliverer.  Why he did not,\r\nwas to me a mystery then and is now; for I know that he saw the\r\nmove; and had his wagons loaded up at one time for a start toward\r\nFrankfort, passing between our two camps.  Conscious of our\r\nweakness, I was unnecessarily unhappy, and doubtless exhibited it\r\ntoo much to those near me; but it did seem to me that the\r\nGovernment at Washington, intent on the larger preparations of\r\nFremont in Missouri and McClellan in Washington, actually ignored\r\nus in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, say the middle of October, I received notice, by\r\ntelegraph, that the Secretary of War, Mr. Cameron (then in St.\r\nLouis), would visit me at Louisville, on his way back to\r\nWashington.  I was delighted to have an opportunity to properly\r\nrepresent the actual state of affairs, and got Mr. Guthrie to go\r\nwith me across to Jeffersonville, to meet the Secretary of War and\r\nescort him to Louisville.  The train was behind time, but Mr.\r\nGuthrie and I waited till it actually arrived.  Mr. Cameron was\r\nattended by Adjutant-General Lorenzo Thomas, and six or seven\r\ngentlemen who turned out to be newspaper reporters.  Mr. Cameron's\r\nfirst inquiry was, when he could start for Cincinnati, saying that,\r\nas he had been detained at St. Louis so long, it was important he\r\nshould hurry on to Washington.  I explained that the regular\r\nmail-boat would leave very soon--viz., at 12 M.--but I begged him\r\nto come over to Louisville; that I wanted to see him on business as\r\nimportant as any in Washington, and hoped he would come and spend\r\nat least a day with us.  He asked if every thing was not well with\r\nus, and I told him far from it; that things were actually bad, as\r\nbad as bad could be.  This seemed to surprise him, and Mr. Guthrie\r\nadded his persuasion to mine; when Mr. Cameron, learning that he\r\ncould leave Louisville by rail via Frankfort next morning early,\r\nand make the same connections at Cincinnati, consented to go with\r\nus to Louisville, with the distinct understanding that he must\r\nleave early the next morning for Washington.\r\n\r\nWe accordingly all took hacks, crossed the river by the ferry, and\r\ndrove to the Galt House, where I was then staying.  Brigadier-\r\nGeneral T. J. Wood had come down from Indianapolis by the same\r\ntrain, and was one of the party.  We all proceeded to my room on\r\nthe first floor of the Galt House, where our excellent landlord,\r\nSilas Miller, Esq., sent us a good lunch and something to drink.\r\nMr. Cameron was not well, and lay on my bed, but joined in the\r\ngeneral conversation.  He and his party seemed to be full of the\r\nparticulars of the developments in St. Louis of some of Fremont's\r\nextravagant contracts and expenses, which were the occasion of\r\nCameron's trip to St. Louis, and which finally resulted in\r\nFremont's being relieved, first by General Hunter, and after by\r\nGeneral H. W. Halleck.\r\n\r\nAfter some general conversation, Mr. Cameron called to me, \"Now,\r\nGeneral Sherman, tell us of your troubles.\"  I said I preferred not\r\nto discuss business with so many strangers present.  He said,\r\n\"They are all friends, all members of my family, and you may speak\r\nyour mind freely and without restraint.\"  I am sure I stepped to\r\nthe door, locked it to prevent intrusion, and then fully and fairly\r\nrepresented the state of affairs in Kentucky, especially the\r\nsituation and numbers of my troops.  I complained that the new\r\nlevies of Ohio and Indiana were diverted East and West, and we got\r\nscarcely any thing; that our forces at Nolin and Dick Robinson were\r\npowerless for invasion, and only tempting to a general such as we\r\nbelieved Sidney Johnston to be; that, if Johnston chose, he could\r\nmarch to Louisville any day.  Cameron exclaimed: \"You astonish me!\r\nOur informants, the Kentucky Senators and members of Congress,\r\nclaim that they have in Kentucky plenty of men, and all they want\r\nare arms and money.\"  I then said it was not true; for the young\r\nmen were arming and going out openly in broad daylight to the rebel\r\ncamps, provided with good horses and guns by their fathers, who\r\nwere at best \"neutral;\" and as to arms, he had, in Washington,\r\npromised General Anderson forty thousand of the best Springfield\r\nmuskets, instead of which we had received only about twelve\r\nthousand Belgian muskets, which the Governor of Pennsylvania had\r\nrefused, as had also the Governor of Ohio, but which had been\r\nadjudged good enough for Kentucky.  I asserted that volunteer\r\ncolonels raising regiments in various parts of the State had come\r\nto Louisville for arms, and when they saw what I had to offer had\r\nscorned to receive them--to confirm the truth of which I appealed\r\nto Mr. Guthrie, who said that every word I had spoken was true, and\r\nhe repeated what I had often heard him say, that no man who owned a\r\nslave or a mule in Kentucky could be trusted.\r\n\r\nMr. Cameron appeared alarmed at what was said, and turned to\r\nAdjutant-General L. Thomas, to inquire if he knew of any troops\r\navailable, that had not been already assigned.  He mentioned\r\nNegley's Pennsylvania Brigade, at Pittsburg, and a couple of other\r\nregiments that were then en route for St. Louis.  Mr. Cameron\r\nordered him to divert these to Louisville, and Thomas made the\r\ntelegraphic orders on the spot.  He further promised, on reaching\r\nWashington, to give us more of his time and assistance.\r\n\r\nIn the general conversation which followed, I remember taking a\r\nlarge map of the United States, and assuming the people of the\r\nwhole South to be in rebellion, that our task was to subdue them,\r\nshowed that McClellan was on the left, having a frontage of less\r\nthan a hundred miles, and Fremont the right, about the same;\r\nwhereas I, the centre, had from the Big Sandy to Paducah, over\r\nthree hundred miles of frontier; that McClellan had a hundred\r\nthousand men, Fremont sixty thousand, whereas to me had only been\r\nallotted about eighteen thousand.  I argued that, for the purpose\r\nof defense we should have sixty thousand men at once, and for\r\noffense, would need two hundred thousand, before we were done.  Mr.\r\nCameron, who still lay on the bed, threw up his hands and\r\nexclaimed, \"Great God! where are they to come from?\"  I asserted\r\nthat there were plenty of men at the North, ready and willing to\r\ncome, if he would only accept their services; for it was notorious\r\nthat regiments had been formed in all the Northwestern States,\r\nwhose services had been refused by the War Department, on the\r\nground that they would not be needed.  We discussed all these\r\nmatters fully, in the most friendly spirit, and I thought I had\r\naroused Mr. Cameron to a realization of the great war that was\r\nbefore us, and was in fact upon us.  I heard him tell General\r\nThomas to make a note of our conversation, that he might attend to\r\nmy requests on reaching Washington.  We all spent the evening\r\ntogether agreeably in conversation, many Union citizens calling to\r\npay their respects, and the next morning early we took the train\r\nfor Frankfort; Mr. Cameron and party going on to Cincinnati and\r\nWashington, and I to Camp Dick Robinson to see General Thomas and\r\nthe troops there.\r\n\r\nI found General Thomas in a tavern, with most of his regiments\r\ncamped about him.  He had sent a small force some miles in advance\r\ntoward Cumberland Gap, under Brigadier-General Schoepf.  Remaining\r\nthere a couple of days, I returned to Louisville; on the 22d of\r\nOctober, General Negley's brigade arrived in boats from Pittsburg,\r\nwas sent out to Camp Nolin; and the Thirty-seventh Indiana.,\r\nColonel Hazzard, and Second Minnesota, Colonel Van Cleve, also\r\nreached Louisville by rail, and were posted at Elizabethtown and\r\nLebanon Junction.  These were the same troops which had been\r\nordered by Mr. Cameron when at Louisville, and they were all that I\r\nreceived thereafter, prior to my leaving Kentucky.  On reaching\r\nWashington, Mr. Cameron called on General Thomas, as he himself\r\nafterward told me, to submit his memorandum of events during his\r\nabsence, and in that memorandum was mentioned my insane request for\r\ntwo hundred thousand men.  By some newspaper man this was seen and\r\npublished, and, before I had the least conception of it, I was\r\nuniversally published throughout the country as \"insane, crazy,\"\r\netc.  Without any knowledge, however, of this fact, I had\r\npreviously addressed to the Adjutant-General of the army at\r\nWashington this letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OP THE CUMBERLAND, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,\r\nOctober 22, 1881.\r\n\r\nTo General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSir: On my arrival at Camp Dick Robinson, I found General\r\nThomas had stationed a Kentucky regiment at Rock Castle Hill,\r\nbeyond a river of the same name, and had sent an Ohio and an\r\nIndiana regiment forward in support.  He was embarrassed for\r\ntransportation, and I authorized him to hire teams, and to move his\r\nwhole force nearer to his advance-guard, so as to support it, as he\r\nhad information of the approach of Zollicoffer toward London.  I\r\nhave just heard from him, that he had sent forward General Schoepf\r\nwith Colonel Wolford's cavalry, Colonel Steadman's Ohio regiment,\r\nand a battery of artillery, followed on a succeeding day by a\r\nTennessee brigade.  He had still two Kentucky regiments, the\r\nThirty-eighth Ohio and another battery of artillery, with which he\r\nwas to follow yesterday.  This force, if concentrated, should be\r\nstrong enough for the purpose; at all events, it is all he had or I\r\ncould give him.\r\n\r\nI explained to you fully, when here, the supposed position of our\r\nadversaries, among which was a force in the valley of Big Sandy,\r\nsupposed to be advancing on Paris, Kentucky.  General Nelson at\r\nMaysville was instructed to collect all the men he could, and\r\nColonel Gill's regiment of Ohio Volunteers.  Colonel Harris was\r\nalready in position at Olympian Springs, and a regiment lay at\r\nLexington, which I ordered to his support.  This leaves the line of\r\nThomas's operations exposed, but I cannot help it.  I explained so\r\nfully to yourself and the Secretary of War the condition of things,\r\nthat I can add nothing new until further developments, You know my\r\nviews that this great centre of our field is too weak, far too\r\nweak, and I have begged and implored till I dare not say more.\r\n\r\nBuckner still is beyond Green River.  He sent a detachment of his\r\nmen, variously estimated at from two to four thousand toward\r\nGreensburg.  General Ward, with about one thousand men, retreated\r\nto Campbellsburg, where he called to his assistance some\r\npartially-formed regiments to the number of about two thousand.\r\nThe enemy did not advance, and General Ward was at last dates at\r\nCampbellsburg.  The officers charged with raising regiments must of\r\nnecessity be near their homes to collect men, and for this reason\r\nare out of position; but at or near Greensburg and Lebanon, I\r\ndesire to assemble as large a force of the Kentucky Volunteers as\r\npossible.  This organization is necessarily irregular, but the\r\nnecessity is so great that I must have them, and therefore have\r\nissued to them arms and clothing during the process of formation.\r\nThis has facilitated their enlistment; but inasmuch as the\r\nLegislature has provided money for organizing the Kentucky\r\nVolunteers, and intrusted its disbursement to a board of loyal\r\ngentlemen, I have endeavored to cooperate with them to hasten the\r\nformation of these corps.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty is, and has been, that as volunteers offer, we\r\nhave not arms and clothing to give them.  The arms sent us are, as\r\nyou already know, European muskets of uncouth pattern, which the\r\nvolunteers will not touch.\r\n\r\nGeneral McCook has now three brigades--Johnson's, Wood's, and\r\nRousseau's.  Negley's brigade arrived to-day, and will be sent out\r\nat once.  The Minnesota regiment has also arrived, and will be sent\r\nforward.  Hazzard's regiment of Indiana troops I have ordered to\r\nthe month of Salt Creek, an important point on the turnpike-road\r\nleading to Elizabethtown.\r\n\r\nI again repeat that our force here is out of all proportion to the\r\nimportance of the position.  Our defeat would be disastrous to the\r\nnation; and to expect of new men, who never bore arms, to do\r\nmiracles, is not right.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, yours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time my attention was drawn to the publication in all\r\nthe Eastern papers, which of course was copied at the West, of the\r\nreport that I was \"crazy, insane, and mad,\" that \"I had demanded\r\ntwo hundred thousand men for the defense of Kentucky;\" and the\r\nauthority given for this report was stated to be the Secretary of\r\nWar himself, Mr. Cameron, who never, to my knowledge, took pains to\r\naffirm or deny it.  My position was therefore simply unbearable,\r\nand it is probable I resented the cruel insult with language of\r\nintense feeling.  Still I received no orders, no reenforcements,\r\nnot a word of encouragement or relief.  About November 1st, General\r\nMcClellan was appointed commander-in-chief of all the armies in the\r\nfield, and by telegraph called for a report from me.  It is\r\nherewith given:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Louisville,\r\nKentucky, November 4, 1861\r\n\r\nGeneral L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSir: In compliance with the telegraphic orders of General\r\nMcClellan, received late last night, I submit this report of the\r\nforces in Kentucky, and of their condition.\r\n\r\nThe tabular statement shows the position of the several regiments.\r\nThe camp at Nolin is at the present extremity of the Nashville\r\nRailroad.  This force was thrown forward to meet the advance of\r\nBuckner's army, which then fell back to Green River, twenty-three\r\nmiles beyond.  These regiments were substantially without means of\r\ntransportation, other than the railroad, which is guarded at all\r\ndangerous points, yet is liable to interruption at any moment, by\r\nthe tearing up of a rail by the disaffected inhabitants or a hired\r\nenemy.  These regiments are composed of good materials, but devoid\r\nof company officers of experience, and have been put under thorough\r\ndrill since being in camp.  They are generally well clad, and\r\nprovided for.  Beyond Green River, the enemy has masked his forces,\r\nand it is very difficult to ascertain even the approximate numbers.\r\nNo pains have been spared to ascertain them, but without success,\r\nand it is well known that they far outnumber us.  Depending,\r\nhowever, on the railroads to their rear for transportation, they\r\nhave not thus far advanced this side of Green River, except in\r\nmarauding parties.  This is the proper line of advance, but will\r\nrequire a very large force, certainly fifty thousand men, as their\r\nrailroad facilities south enable them to concentrate at\r\nMunfordsville the entire strength of the South.  General McCook's\r\ncommand is divided into four brigades, under Generals Wood, R. W.\r\nJohnson, Rousseau, and Negley.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas's line of operations is from Lexington, toward\r\nCumberland Gap and Ford, which are occupied by a force of rebel\r\nTennesseeans, under the command of Zollicoffer.  Thomas occupies\r\nthe position at London, in front of two roads which lead to the\r\nfertile part of Kentucky, the one by Richmond, and the other by\r\nCrab Orchard, with his reserve at Camp Dick Robinson, eight miles\r\nsouth of the Kentucky River.  His provisions and stores go by\r\nrailroad from Cincinnati to Nicholasville, and thence in wagons to\r\nhis several regiments.  He is forced to hire transportation.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Nelson is operating by the line from Olympian\r\nSprings, east of Paris, on the Covington & Lexington Railroad,\r\ntoward Prestonburg, in the valley of the Big Sandy where is\r\nassembled a force of from twenty-five to thirty-five hundred rebel\r\nKentuckians waiting reenforcements from Virginia.  My last report\r\nfrom him was to October 28th, at which time he had Colonel Harris's\r\nOhio Second, nine hundred strong; Colonel Norton's Twenty-first\r\nOhio, one thousand; and Colonel Sill's Thirty-third Ohio, seven\r\nhundred and fifty strong; with two irregular Kentucky regiments,\r\nColonels Marshall and Metcalf.  These troops were on the road near\r\nHazel Green and West Liberty, advancing toward Prestonburg.\r\n\r\nUpon an inspection of the map, you will observe these are all\r\ndivergent lines, but rendered necessary, from the fact that our\r\nenemies choose them as places of refuge from pursuit, where they\r\ncan receive assistance from neighboring States.  Our lines are all\r\ntoo weak, probably with the exception of that to Prestonburg.  To\r\nstrengthen these, I am thrown on the raw levies of Ohio and\r\nIndiana, who arrive in detachments, perfectly fresh from the\r\ncountry, and loaded down with baggage, also upon the Kentuckians,\r\nwho are slowly forming regiments all over the State, at points\r\nremote from danger, and whom it will be almost impossible to\r\nassemble together.  The organization of this latter force is, by\r\nthe laws of Kentucky, under the control of a military board of\r\ncitizens, at the capital, Frankfort, and they think they will be\r\nenabled to have fifteen regiments toward the middle of this month,\r\nbut I doubt it, and deem it unsafe to rely on them: There are four\r\nregiments forming in the neighborhood of Owensboro, near the mouth\r\nof Green River, who are doing good service, also in the\r\nneighborhood of Campbellsville, but it is unsafe to rely on troops\r\nso suddenly armed and equipped.  They are not yet clothed or\r\nuniformed.  I know well you will think our force too widely\r\ndistributed, but we are forced to it by the attitude of our\r\nenemies, whose force and numbers the country never has and probably\r\nnever will comprehend.\r\n\r\nI am told that my estimate of troops needed for this line, viz.,\r\ntwo hundred thousand, has been construed to my prejudice, and\r\ntherefore leave it for the future.  This is the great centre on\r\nwhich our enemies can concentrate whatever force is not employed\r\nelsewhere.  Detailed statement of present force inclosed with this.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL McCOOK'S CAMP, AT NOLIN, FIFTY-TWO MILES FROM\r\nLOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, NOVEMBER 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nFirst Brigade (General ROUSSEAU).-Third Kentucky, Colonel Bulkley;\r\nFourth Kentucky, Colonel Whittaker; First Cavalry, Colonel Board;\r\nStone's battery; two companies Nineteenth United States Infantry,\r\nand two companies Fifteenth United States Infantry, Captain Gilman.\r\n\r\nSecond Brigade (General T.

Thomas, in a\r\nletter of February 1, 1862; in answer to an application of my\r\nbrother, Senator John Sherman, and on which I was adjudged insane:\r\n\r\n\r\nLouisville, November 3, 10 p.m.\r\n\r\nTo General McLELLAN, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nDispatch just received.  We are forced to operate on three lines,\r\nall dependent on railroads of doubtful safety, requiring strong\r\nguards.  From Paris to Prestonbnrg, three Ohio regiments and some\r\nmilitia--enemy variously reported from thirty-five hundred to seven\r\nthousand.  From Lexington toward Cumberland Gap, Brigadier-General\r\nThomas, one Indiana and five Ohio regiments, two Kentucky and two\r\nTennessee; hired wagons and badly clad.  Zollicoffer, at Cumberland\r\nFord, about seven thousand.  Lee reported on the way with Virginia\r\nreenforcements.  In front of Louisville, fifty-two miles, McCook,\r\nwith four brigades of about thirteen thousand, with four regiments\r\nto guard the railroad, at all times in danger.  Enemy along the\r\nrailroad from Green River to Bowling Green, Nashville, and\r\nClarksville.  Buckner, Hardee, Sidney Johnston, Folk, and Pillow,\r\nthe two former in immediate command, the force as large as they\r\nwant or can subsist, from twenty-five to thirty thousand.  Bowling\r\nGreen strongly fortified.  Our forces too small to do good, and too\r\nlarge to sacrifice.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Louisville,\r\nKentucky, November 6, 1861\r\n\r\nGeneral L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\nSir: General McClellan telegraphs me to report to him daily the\r\nsituation of affairs here.  The country is so large that it is\r\nimpossible to give clear and definite views.  Our enemies have a\r\nterrible advantage in the fact that in our midst, in our camps, and\r\nalong our avenues of travel, they have active partisans, farmers\r\nand business-men, who seemingly pursue their usual calling, but are\r\nin fact spies.  They report all our movements and strength, while\r\nwe can procure information only by circuitous and unreliable means.\r\nI inclose you the copy of an intercepted letter, which is but the\r\ntype of others.  Many men from every part of the State are now\r\nenrolled under Buckner--have gone to him--while ours have to be\r\nraised in neighborhoods, and cannot be called together except at\r\nlong notice.  These volunteers are being organized under the laws\r\nof the State, and the 10th of November is fixed for the time of\r\nconsolidating them into companies and regiments.  Many of them are\r\narmed by the United States as home guards, and many by General\r\nAnderson and myself, because of the necessity of being armed to\r\nguard their camps against internal enemies.  Should we be\r\noverwhelmed, they would scatter, and their arms and clothing will\r\ngo to the enemy, furnishing the very material they so much need.\r\nWe should have here a very large force, sufficient to give\r\nconfidence to the Union men of the ability to do what should be\r\ndone--possess ourselves of all the State.  But all see and feel we\r\nare brought to a stand-still, and this produces doubt and alarm.\r\nWith our present force it would be simple madness to cross Green\r\nRiver, and yet hesitation may be as fatal.  In like manner the\r\nother columns are in peril, not so much in front as rear, the\r\nrailroads over which our stores must pass being much exposed.  I\r\nhave the Nashville Railroad guarded by three regiments, yet it is\r\nfar from being safe; and, the moment actual hostilities commence,\r\nthese roads will be interrupted, and we will be in a dilemma.  To\r\nmeet this in part I have put a cargo of provisions at the mouth of\r\nSalt River, guarded by two regiments.  All these detachments weaken\r\nthe main force, and endanger the whole.  Do not conclude, as\r\nbefore, that I exaggerate the facts.  They are as stated, and the\r\nfuture looks as dark as possible.  It would be better if some man\r\nof sanguine mind were here, for I am forced to order according to\r\nmy convictions.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over, General Thomas J. Wood, then in command of\r\nthe district of Vicksburg, prepared a statement addressed to the\r\npublic, describing the interview with the Secretary of War, which\r\nhe calls a \"Council of War.\"  I did not then deem it necessary to\r\nrenew a matter which had been swept into oblivion by the war\r\nitself; but, as it is evidence by an eyewitness, it is worthy of\r\ninsertion here.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of October, 1861, the writer, who had been personally\r\non mustering duty in Indiana, was appointed a brigadier-general of\r\nvolunteers, and ordered to report to General Sherman, then in\r\ncommand of the Department of the Cumberland, with his headquarters\r\nat Louisville, having succeeded General Robert Anderson.  When the\r\nwriter was about leaving Indianapolis to proceed to Louisville, Mr.\r\nCameron, returning from his famous visit of inspection to General\r\nFremont's department, at St. Louis, Missouri, arrived at\r\nIndianapolis, and announced his intention to visit General Sherman.\r\n\r\nThe writer was invited to accompany the party to Louisville.\r\nTaking the early morning train from Indianapolis to Louisville on\r\nthe 16th of October, 1861, the party arrived in Jeffersonville\r\nshortly after mid-day.  General Sherman met the party in\r\nJeffersonville, and accompanied it to the Galt House, in\r\nLouisville, the hotel at which he was stopping.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon General Sherman informed the writer that a\r\ncouncil of war was to be held immediately in his private room in\r\nthe hotel, and desired him to be present at the council.  General\r\nSherman and the writer proceeded directly to the room.  The writer\r\nentered the room first, and observed in it Mr. Cameron, Adjutant-\r\nGeneral L. Thomas, and some other persons, all of whose names he\r\ndid not know, but whom he recognized as being of Mr. Cameron's\r\nparty.  The name of one of the party the writer had learned, which\r\nhe remembers as Wilkinson, or Wilkerson, and who he understood was\r\na writer for the New York Tribune newspaper.  The Hon. James\r\nGuthrie was also in the room, having been invited, on account of\r\nhis eminent position as a citizen of Kentucky, his high civic\r\nreputation, and his well-known devotion to the Union, to meet the\r\nSecretary of War in the council.  When General Sherman entered the\r\nroom he closed the door, and turned the key in the lock.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the business of the meeting, General Sherman\r\nremarked substantially: \"Mr. Cameron, we have met here to discuss\r\nmatters and interchange views which should be known only by persons\r\nhigh in the confidence of the Government.  There are persons\r\npresent whom I do not know, and I desire to know, before opening\r\nthe business of the council, whether they are persons who may be\r\nproperly allowed to hear the views which I have to submit to you.\"\r\nMr. Cameron replied, with some little testiness of manner, that the\r\npersons referred to belonged to his party, and there was no\r\nobjection to their knowing whatever might be communicated to him.\r\n\r\nCertainly the legitimate and natural conclusion from this remark of\r\nMr. Cameron's was that whatever views might be submitted by General\r\nSherman would be considered under the protection of the seal of\r\nsecrecy, and would not be divulged to the public till all\r\napprehension of injurious consequences from such disclosure had\r\npassed.  And it may be remarked, further, that justice to General\r\nSherman required that if, at any future time, his conclusions as to\r\nthe amount of force necessary to conduct the operations committed\r\nto his charge should be made public, the grounds on which his\r\nconclusions were based should be made public at the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. Cameron then asked General Sherman what his plans were.  To\r\nthis General Sherman replied that he had no plans; that no\r\nsufficient force had been placed at his disposition with which to\r\ndevise any plan of operations; that, before a commanding general\r\ncould project a plan of campaign, he must know what amount of force\r\nhe would have to operate with.\r\n\r\nThe general added that he had views which he would be happy to\r\nsubmit for the consideration of the Secretary.  Mr. Cameron desired\r\nto hear General Sherman's views.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman began by giving his opinion of the people of\r\nKentucky, and the then condition of the State.  He remarked that he\r\nbelieved a very large majority of the people of Kentucky were\r\nthoroughly devoted to the Union, and loyal to the Government, and\r\nthat the Unionists embraced almost all the older and more\r\nsubstantial men in the State; but, unfortunately, there was no\r\norganization nor arms among the Union men; that the rebel minority,\r\nthoroughly vindictive in its sentiments, was organized and armed\r\n(this having been done in advance by their leaders), and, beyond\r\nthe reach of the Federal forces, overawed and prevented the Union\r\nmen from organizing; that, in his opinion, if Federal protection\r\nwere extended throughout the State to the Union men, a large force\r\ncould be raised for the service of the Government.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman next presented a resume of the information in his\r\npossession as to the number of the rebel troops in Kentucky.\r\nCommencing with the force at Columbus, Kentucky, the reports\r\nvaried, giving the strength from ten to twenty thousand.  It was\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-General Polk.  General Sherman fixed it at\r\nthe lowest estimate; say, ten thousand.  The force at Bowling\r\nGreen, commanded by General.  A. S. Johnston, supported by Hardee,\r\nBuckner, and others, was variously estimated at from eighteen to\r\nthirty thousand.  General Sherman estimated this force at the\r\nlowest figures given to it by his information--eighteen thousand.\r\n\r\nHe explained that, for purposes of defense, these two forces ought,\r\nowing to the facility with which troops might be transported from\r\none to the other, by the net-work of railroads in Middle and West\r\nTennessee, to be considered almost as one.  General Sherman\r\nremarked, also, on the facility with which reinforcements could be\r\ntransported by railroad to Bowling Green, from the other rebellions\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe third organized body of rebel troops was in Eastern Kentucky,\r\nunder General Zollicoffer, estimated, according to the most\r\nreliable information, at six thousand men.  This force threatened a\r\ndescent, if unrestrained, on the blue-grass region of Kentucky,\r\nincluding the cities of Lexington, and Frankfort, the capital of\r\nthe State; and if successful in its primary movements, as it would\r\ngather head as it advanced, might endanger the safety of\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman said that the information in his possession\r\nindicated an intention, on the part of the rebels, of a general and\r\ngrand advance toward the Ohio River.  He further expressed the\r\nopinion that, if such advance should be made, and not checked, the\r\nrebel force would be swollen by at least twenty thousand recruits\r\nfrom the disloyalists in Kentucky.  His low computation of the\r\norganized rebel soldiers then in Kentucky fixed the strength at\r\nabout thirty-five thousand.  Add twenty thousand for reenforcements\r\ngained in Kentucky, to say nothing of troops drawn from other rebel\r\nStates, and the effective rebel force in the State, at a low\r\nestimate, would be fifty-five thousand men.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman explained forcibly how largely the difficulties of\r\nsuppressing the rebellion would be enhanced, if the rebels should\r\nbe allowed to plant themselves firmly, with strong fortifications,\r\nat commanding points on the Ohio River.  It would be facile for\r\nthem to carry the war thence into the loyal States north of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nTo resist an advance of the rebels, General Sherman stated that he\r\ndid not have at that time in Kentucky more than some twelve to\r\nfourteen thousand effective men.  The bulk of this force was posted\r\nat camp Nolin, on the Louisville & Nashville Railway, fifty miles\r\nsouth of Louisville.  A part of it was in Eastern Kentucky, under\r\nGeneral George H. Thomas, and a very small force was in the lower\r\nvalley of Green River.\r\n\r\nThis disposition of the force had been made for the double purpose\r\nof watching and checking the rebels, and protecting the raising and\r\norganization of troops among the Union men of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nHaving explained the situation from the defensive point of view,\r\nGeneral Sherman proceeded to consider it from the offensive\r\nstand-point.  The Government had undertaken to suppress the\r\nrebellion; the onus faciendi, therefore, rested on the Government.\r\nThe rebellion could never be put down, the authority of the\r\nparamount Government asserted, and the union of the States declared\r\nperpetual, by force of arms, by maintaining the defensive; to\r\naccomplish these grand desiderata, it was absolutely necessary the\r\nGovernment should adopt, and maintain until the rebellion was\r\ncrushed, the offensive.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of expelling the rebels from Kentucky, General\r\nSherman said that at least sixty thousand soldiers were necessary.\r\nConsidering that the means of accomplishment must always be\r\nproportioned to the end to be achieved, and bearing in mind the\r\narray of rebel force then in Kentucky, every sensible man must\r\nadmit that the estimate of the force given by General Sherman, for\r\ndriving the rebels out of the State, and reestablishing and\r\nmaintaining the authority of the Government, was a very low one.\r\nThe truth is that, before the rebels were driven from Kentucky,\r\nmany more than sixty thousand soldiers were sent into the State.\r\n\r\nAscending from the consideration of the narrow question of the\r\npolitical and military situation in Kentucky, and the extent of\r\nforce necessary to redeem the State from rebel thraldom,\r\nforecasting in his sagacious intellect the grand and daring\r\noperations which, three years afterward, he realized in a campaign,\r\ntaken in its entirety, without a parallel in modern times, General\r\nSherman expressed the opinion that, to carry the war to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, and destroy all armed opposition to the Goverment, in the\r\nentire Mississippi Valley, at least two hundred thousand troops\r\nwere absolutely requisite.\r\n\r\nSo soon as General Sherman had concluded the expression of his\r\nviews, Mr. Cameron asked, with much warmth and apparent irritation,\r\n\"Where do you suppose, General Sherman, all this force is to come\r\nfrom.\"  General Sherman replied that he did not know; that it was\r\nnot his duty to raise, organize, and put the necessary military\r\nforce into the field; that duty pertained to the War Department.\r\nHis duty was to organize campaigns and command the troops after\r\nthey had been put into the field.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the proceedings, General Sherman suggested that it\r\nmight be agreeable to the Secretary to hear the views of Mr.\r\nGuthrie.  Thus appealed to, Mr. Guthrie said he did not consider\r\nhimself, being a civilian, competent to give an opinion as to the\r\nextent of force necessary to parry the war to the Gulf of Mexico;\r\nbut, being well informed of the condition of things in Kentucky, he\r\nindorsed fully General Sherman's opinion of the force required to\r\ndrive the rebels out of the State.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a circumstantial account of the deliberations of\r\nthe council that were of any importance.\r\n\r\nA good deal of desultory conversation followed, on immaterial\r\nmatters; and some orders were issued by telegraph, by the Secretary\r\nof War, for some small reenforcements to be sent to Kentucky\r\nimmediately, from Pennsylvania and Indiana.\r\n\r\nA short time after the council was held--the exact time is not now\r\nremembered by the writer--an imperfect narrative of it appeared in\r\nthe New York Tribune.  This account announced to the public the\r\nconclusions uttered by General Sherman in the council, without\r\ngiving the reasons on which his conclusions were based.  The\r\nunfairness of this course to General Sherman needs no comment.  All\r\nmilitary men were shocked by the gross breach of faith which had\r\nbeen committed\r\n\r\nTH. J. WOOD, Major-General Volunteers\r\n\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi, August 24, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Don Carlos Buell arrived at Louisville about the\r\nmiddle of November, with orders to relieve me, and I was\r\ntransferred for duty to the Department of the Missouri, and ordered\r\nto report in person to Major-General H. W. Halleck at St. Louis.  I\r\naccompanied General Buell to the camp at Nolin, where he reviewed\r\nand inspected the camp and troops under the command of General A.\r\nMcD. McCook, and on our way back General Buell inspected the\r\nregiment of Hazzard at Elizabethtown.  I then turned over my\r\ncommand to him, and took my departure for St. Louis.\r\n\r\nAt the time I was so relieved I thought, of course, it was done in\r\nfulfillment of Mr. Lincoln's promise to me, and as a necessary\r\nresult of my repeated demand for the fulfillment of that promise;\r\nbut I saw and felt, and was of course deeply moved to observe, the\r\nmanifest belief that there was more or less of truth in the rumor\r\nthat the cares, perplexities, and anxiety of the situation had\r\nunbalanced my judgment and mind.  It was, doubtless, an incident\r\ncommon to all civil wars, to which I could only submit with the\r\nbest grace possible, trusting to the future for an opportunity to\r\nredeem my fortune and good name.  Of course I could not deny the\r\nfact, and had to submit to all its painful consequences for months;\r\nand, moreover, I could not hide from myself that many of the\r\nofficers and soldiers subsequently placed under my command looked\r\nat me askance and with suspicion.  Indeed, it was not until the\r\nfollowing April that the battle of Shiloh gave me personally the\r\nchance to redeem my good name.\r\n\r\nOn reaching St. Louis and reporting to General Halleck, I was\r\nreceived kindly, and was shortly afterward (viz., November 23d)\r\nsent up to Sedalia to inspect the camp there, and the troops\r\nlocated along the road back to Jefferson City, and I was ordered to\r\nassume command in a certain contingency.  I found General Steels at\r\nSedalia with his regiments scattered about loosely; and General\r\nPope at Otterville, twenty miles back, with no concert between\r\nthem.  The rebel general, Sterling Price, had his forces down about\r\nOsceola and Warsaw.  I advised General Halleck to collect the whole\r\nof his men into one camp on the La Mine River, near Georgetown, to\r\nput them into brigades and divisions, so as to be ready to be\r\nhandled, and I gave some preliminary orders looking to that end.\r\nBut the newspapers kept harping on my insanity and paralyzed my\r\nefforts.  In spite of myself, they tortured from me some words and\r\nacts of imprudence.  General Halleck telegraphed me on November\r\n26th: \"Unless telegraph-lines are interrupted, make no movement\r\nof troops without orders;\" and on November 29th: \"No forward\r\nmovement of troops on Osceola will be made; only strong\r\nreconnoitring-parties will be sent out in the supposed direction of\r\nthe enemy; the bulk of the troops being held in position till more\r\nreliable information is obtained.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time I received the following dispatch:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI\r\nNovember 28, 1881.\r\nBrigadier-General SHERMAN, Sedalia:\r\n\r\nMrs. Sherman is here.  General Halleck is satisfied, from reports\r\nof scouts received here, that no attack on Sedalia is intended.\r\nYou will therefore return to this city, and report your\r\nobservations on the condition of the troops you have examined.\r\nPlease telegraph when you will leave.\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER HAMILTON, Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nI accordingly returned to St. Louis, where I found Mrs. Sherman,\r\nnaturally and properly distressed at the continued and reiterated\r\nreports of the newspapers of my insanity, and she had come from\r\nLancaster to see me.  This recall from Sedalia simply swelled the\r\ncry.  It was alleged that I was recalled by reason of something\r\nfoolish I had done at Sedalia, though in fact I had done absolutely\r\nnothing, except to recommend what was done immediately thereafter\r\non the advice of Colonel McPherson, on a subsequent inspection.\r\nSeeing and realizing that my efforts were useless, I concluded to\r\nask for a twenty days' leave of absence, to accompany Mrs. Sherman\r\nto our home in Lancaster, and to allow the storm to blow over\r\nsomewhat.  It also happened to be mid-winter, when, nothing was\r\ndoing; so Mrs. Sherman and I returned to Lancaster, where I was\r\nborn, and where I supposed I was better known and appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers kept up their game as though instigated by malice,\r\nand chief among them was the Cincinnati Commercial, whose editor,\r\nHalsted, was generally believed to be an honorable man.  P. B.\r\nEwing, Esq., being in Cincinnati, saw him and asked him why he, who\r\ncertainly knew better, would reiterate such a damaging slander.  He\r\nanswered, quite cavalierly, that it was one of the news-items of\r\nthe day, and he had to keep up with the time; but he would be most\r\nhappy to publish any correction I might make, as though I could\r\ndeny such a malicious piece of scandal affecting myself.  On the\r\n12th of November I had occasion to write to General Halleck, and I\r\nhave a copy of his letter in answer:\r\n\r\n\r\nST. Louis, December 18, 1881.\r\nBrigadier-General W. T. SHERMAN, Lancaster, Ohio.\r\n\r\nMy DEAR GENERAL: Yours of the 12th was received a day or two ago,\r\nbut was mislaid for the moment among private papers, or I should\r\nhave answered it sooner.  The newspaper attacks are certainly\r\nshameless and scandalous, but I cannot agree with you, that they\r\nhave us in their power \"to destroy us as they please.\"  I certainly\r\nget my share of abuse, but it will not disturb me.\r\n\r\nYour movement of the troops was not countermanded by me because I\r\nthought it an unwise one in itself, but because I was not then\r\nready for it.  I had better information of Price's movements than\r\nyou had, and I had no apprehension of an attack.  I intended to\r\nconcentrate the forces on that line, but I wished the movement\r\ndelayed until I could determine on a better position.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving Lieutenant-Colonel McPherson's report, I made\r\nprecisely the location you had ordered.  I was desirous at the time\r\nnot to prevent the advance of Price by any movement on our part,\r\nhoping that he would move on Lexington; but finding that he had\r\ndetermined to remain at Osceola for some time at least, I made the\r\nmovement you proposed.  As you could not know my plans, you and\r\nothers may have misconstrued the reason of my countermanding your\r\norders....\r\n\r\nI hope to see you well enough for duty soon.  Our organization goes\r\non slowly, but we will effect it in time.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd subsequently, in a letter to Hon. Thomas Ewing, in answer to\r\nsome inquiries involving the same general subject, General Halleck\r\nwrote as follows:\r\n\r\nHon. THOMAS  EWING, Lancaster, Ohio.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: Your note of the 13th, and one of this date, from Mr.\r\nSherman, in relation to Brigadier-General Sherman's having being\r\nrelieved from command in Sedalia, in November last, are just\r\nreceived.  General Sherman was not put in command at Sedalia; he\r\nwas authorized to assume it, and did so for a day or two.  He did\r\nnot know my plans, and his movement of troops did not accord with\r\nthem.  I therefore directed him to leave them as they were, and\r\nreport here the result of his inspection, for which purpose he had\r\nbeen ordered there.\r\n\r\nNo telegram or dispatch of any kind was sent by me, or by any one\r\nwith my knowledge or authority, in relation to it.  After his\r\nreturn here, I gave him a leave of absence of twenty days, for the\r\nbenefit of his health.  As I was then pressing General McClellan\r\nfor more officers, I deemed it necessary to explain why I did so.\r\nI used these words: \"I am satisfied that General Sherman's physical\r\nand mental system is so completely broken by labor and care as to\r\nrender him, for the present, unfit for duty; perhaps a few weeks'\r\nrest may restore him.\"  This was the only communication I made on\r\nthe subject.  On no occasion have I ever expressed an opinion that\r\nhis mind was affected otherwise than by over-exertion; to have said\r\nso would have done him the greatest injustice.\r\n\r\nAfter General Sherman returned from his short leave, I found that\r\nhis health was nearly restored, and I placed him temporarily in\r\ncommand of the camp of instruction, numbering over fifteen thousand\r\nmen.  I then wrote to General McClellan that he would soon be able\r\nto again take the field.  I gave General Sherman a copy of my\r\nletter.  This is the total of my correspondence on the subject.  As\r\nevidence that I have every confidence in General Sherman, I have\r\nplaced him in command of Western Kentucky--a command only second in\r\nimportance in this department.  As soon as divisions and columns\r\ncan be organized, I propose to send him into the field where he can\r\nrender most efficient service.  I have seen newspaper squibs,\r\ncharging him with being \"crazy,\" etc.  This is the grossest\r\ninjustice; I do not, however, consider such attacks worthy of\r\nnotice.  The best answer is General Sherman's present position, and\r\nthe valuable services he is rendering to the country.  I have the\r\nfullest confidence in him.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn returning to St. Louis, on the expiration of my leave of\r\nabsence, I found that General Halleck was beginning to move his\r\ntroops: one part, under General U. S. Grant, up the Tennessee\r\nRiver; and another part, under General S. R. Curtis, in the\r\ndirection of Springfield, Missouri.  General Grant was then at\r\nPaducah, and General Curtis was under orders for Rolls.  I was\r\nordered to take Curtis's place in command of the camp of\r\ninstruction, at Benton Barracks, on the ground back of North St.\r\nLouis, now used as the Fair Grounds, by the following order:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Order No. 87].\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI\r\nSt. Louis, December 23, 1861\r\n\r\n[EXTRACT.]\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General W. T. Sherman, United States Volunteers, is\r\nhereby assigned to the command of the camp of instruction and post\r\nof Benton Barracks.  He will have every armed regiment and company\r\nin his command ready for service at a moment's warning, and will\r\nnotify all concerned that, when marching orders are received, it is\r\nexpected that they will be instantly obeyed; no excuses for delay\r\nwill be admitted.  General Sherman will immediately report to these\r\nheadquarters what regiments and companies, at Benton Barracks, are\r\nready for the field.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General Halleck,\r\n\r\nJ. C. KELTEN, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI immediately assumed command, and found, in the building\r\nconstructed for the commanding officer, Brigadier-General Strong,\r\nand the family of a captain of Iowa cavalry, with whom we boarded.\r\nMajor Curtis, son of General Curtis, was the adjutant-general, but\r\nwas soon relieved by Captain J. H. Hammond, who was appointed\r\nassistant adjutant-general, and assigned to duty with me.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Hurlbut was also there, and about a dozen\r\nregiments of infantry and cavalry.  I at once gave all matters\r\npertaining to the post my personal attention, got the regiments in\r\nas good order as possible, kept up communication with General\r\nHalleck's headquarters by telegraph, and, when orders came for the\r\nmovement of any regiment or detachment, it moved instantly.  The\r\nwinter was very wet, and the ground badly drained.  The quarters\r\nhad been erected by General Fremont, under contract; they were mere\r\nshells, but well arranged for a camp, embracing the Fair Grounds,\r\nand some forty acres of flat ground west of it.  I instituted\r\ndrills, and was specially ordered by General Halleck to watch\r\nGenerals Hurlbut and Strong, and report as to their fitness for\r\ntheir commissions as brigadier-generals.  I had known Hurlbut as a\r\nyoung lawyer, in Charleston, South Carolina, before the Mexican\r\nWar, at which time he took a special interest in military matters,\r\nand I found him far above the average in the knowledge of\r\nregimental and brigade drill, and so reported.  General Strong had\r\nbeen a merchant, and he told me that he never professed to be a\r\nsoldier, but had been urged on the Secretary of War for the\r\ncommission of a brigadier-general, with the expectation of be\r\ncoming quartermaster or commissary-general.  He was a good,\r\nkind-hearted gentleman, boiling over with patriotism and zeal.  I\r\nadvised him what to read and study, was considerably amused at his\r\nreceiving instruction from a young lieutenant who knew the company\r\nand battalion drill, and could hear him practise in his room the\r\nwords of command, and tone of voice, \"Break from the right, to\r\nmarch to the left!\"  \"Battalion, halt!\"  \"Forward into line!\" etc.\r\nOf course I made a favorable report in his case.  Among the\r\ninfantry and cavalry colonels were some who afterward rose to\r\ndistinction--David Stuart, Gordon Granger, Bussey, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThough it was mid-winter, General Halleck was pushing his\r\npreparations most vigorously, and surely he brought order out of\r\nchaos in St. Louis with commendable energy.  I remember, one night,\r\nsitting in his room, on the second floor of the Planters' House,\r\nwith him and General Cullum, his chief of staff, talking\r\nof things generally, and the subject then was of the much-talked-of\r\n\"advance,\" as soon as the season would permit.  Most people urged\r\nthe movement down the Mississippi River; but Generals Polk and\r\nPillow had a large rebel force, with heavy guns in a very strong\r\nposition, at Columbus, Kentucky, about eighteen miles below Cairo.\r\nCommodore Foote had his gunboat fleet at Cairo; and General U. S.\r\nGrant, who commanded the district, was collecting a large force at\r\nPaducah, Cairo, and Bird's Point.  General Halleck had a map on his\r\ntable, with a large pencil in his hand, and asked, \"where is the\r\nrebel line?\"  Cullum drew the pencil through Bowling Green, Forts\r\nDonelson and Henry, and Columbus, Kentucky.  \"That is their line,\"\r\nsaid Halleck.  \"Now, where is the proper place to break it?\"  And\r\neither Cullum or I said, \"Naturally the centre.\"  Halleck drew a\r\nline perpendicular to the other, near its middle, and it coincided\r\nnearly with the general course of the Tennessee River; and he said,\r\n\"That's the true line of operations.\"  This occurred more than a\r\nmonth before General Grant began the movement, and, as he was\r\nsubject to General Halleck's orders, I have always given Halleck\r\nthe full credit for that movement, which was skillful, successful,\r\nand extremely rich in military results; indeed, it was the first\r\nreal success on our side in the civil war.  The movement up the\r\nTennessee began about the 1st of February, and Fort Henry was\r\ncaptured by the joint action of the navy under Commodore Foote, and\r\nthe land forces under General Grant, on the 6th of February, 1862.\r\nAbout the same time, General S. R. Curtis had moved forward from\r\nRolls, and, on the 8th of March, defeated the rebels under\r\nMcCulloch, Van Dom, and Price, at Pea Ridge.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Fort Henry fell, General Grant marched straight across\r\nto Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River, invested the place, and,\r\nas soon as the gunboats had come round from the Tennessee, and had\r\nbombarded the water-front, he assaulted; whereupon Buckner\r\nsurrendered the garrison of twelve thousand men; Pillow and\r\nex-Secretary of War General Floyd having personally escaped across\r\nthe river at night, occasioning a good deal of fun and criticism at\r\ntheir expense.\r\n\r\nBefore the fall of Donelson, but after that of Henry, I received,\r\nat Benton Barracks, the following orders:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS THE DEPARTMENT OF MISSOURI\r\nSt. Louis, February,13, 1862\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General SHERMAN, Benton Barracks:\r\n\r\nYou will immediately repair to Paducah, Kentucky, and assume\r\ncommand of that post.  Brigadier-General Hurlbut will accompany\r\nyou.  The command of Benton Barracks will be turned over to General\r\nStrong.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALECK,  Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started for Paducah the same day, and think that General Cullum\r\nwent with me to Cairo; General Halleck's purpose being to push\r\nforward the operations up the Tennessee River with unusual vigor.\r\nOn reaching Paducah, I found this dispatch:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS THE DEPARTMENT OF MISSOURI\r\nSt. Louis, February 15, 1862\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General SHERMAN, Paducah, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nSend General Grant every thing you can spare from Paducah and Smith\r\nand also General Hurlbut.\r\n\r\nBowling Green has been evacuated entirely.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day brought us news of the surrender of Buckner, and\r\nprobably at no time during the war did we all feel so heavy a\r\nweight raised from our breasts, or so thankful for a most fruitful\r\nseries of victories.  They at once gave Generals Halleck, Grant,\r\nand C. F. Smith, great fame.  Of course, the rebels let go their\r\nwhole line, and fell back on Nashville and Island No. Ten, and to\r\nthe Memphis & Charleston Railroad.  Everybody was anxious to help.\r\nBoats passed up and down constantly, and very soon arrived the\r\nrebel prisoners from Donelson.  I saw General Buckner on the boat,\r\nhe seemed self-sufficient, and thought their loss was not really so\r\nserious to their cause as we did.\r\n\r\nAbout this time another force of twenty or twenty-five thousand men\r\nwas collected on the west bank of the Mississippi, above Cairo,\r\nunder the command of Major-General John Pope, designed to become\r\nthe \"Army of the Mississippi,\" and to operate, in conjunction with\r\nthe navy, down the river against the enemy's left flank, which had\r\nheld the strong post of Columbus, Kentucky, but which, on the fall\r\nof Fort Donelson, had fallen back to New Madrid and Island No. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBATTLE of SHILOH.\r\n\r\nMARCH AND APRIL, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of February, 1862, Major-General Halleck commanded all\r\nthe armies in the valley of the Mississippi, from his headquarters\r\nin St: Louis.  These were, the Army of the Ohio, Major-General\r\nBuell, in Kentucky; the Army of the Tennessee, Major-General Grant,\r\nat Forts Henry and Donelson; the Army of the Mississippi,\r\nMajor-General Pope; and that of General S. R. Curtis, in Southwest\r\nMissouri.  He posted his chief of staff, General Cullum, at Cairo,\r\nand me at Paducah, chiefly to expedite and facilitate the important\r\noperations then in progress up the Tennessee, and Cumberland\r\nRivers.\r\n\r\nFort Donelson had surrendered to General Grant on the 16th of\r\nFebruary, and there must have been a good deal of confusion\r\nresulting from the necessary care of the wounded, and disposition\r\nof prisoners, common to all such occasions, and there was a real\r\ndifficulty in communicating between St. Louis and Fort Donelson.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buell had also followed up the rebel army, which had\r\nretreated hastily from Bowling Green to and through Nashville, a\r\ncity of so much importance to the South, that it was at one time\r\nproposed as its capital.  Both Generals Grant and Buell looked to\r\nits capture as an event of great importance.  On the 21st General\r\nGrant sent General Smith with his division to Clarksville, fifty\r\nmiles above Donelson, toward Nashville, and on the 27th went\r\nhimself to Nashville to meet and confer with General Buell, but\r\nreturned to Donelson the next day.\r\n\r\nMeantime, General Halleck at St. Louis must have felt that his\r\narmies were getting away from him, and began to send dispatches to\r\nme at Paducah, to be forwarded by boat, or by a rickety\r\ntelegraph-line up to Fort Henry, which lay entirely in a hostile\r\ncountry, and was consequently always out of repair.  On the 1st of\r\nMarch I received the following dispatch, and forwarded it to\r\nGeneral Grant, both by the telegraph and boat:\r\n\r\nTo General GRANT, Fort Henry\r\n\r\nTransports will be sent you as soon as possible, to move your\r\ncolumn up the Tennessee River.  The main object of this expedition\r\nwill be to destroy the railroad-bridge over Bear Creek, near\r\nEastport, Mississippi; and also the railroad connections at\r\nCorinth, Jackson, and Humboldt.  It is thought best that these\r\nobjects be attempted in the order named.  Strong detachments of\r\ncavalry and light artillery, supported by infantry, may by rapid\r\nmovements reach these points from the river, without any serious\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nAvoid any general engagements with strong forces.  It will be\r\nbetter to retreat than to risk a general battle.  This should be\r\nstrongly impressed on the officers sent with expeditions from the\r\nriver.  General C. F. Smith or some very discreet officer should be\r\nselected for such commands.  Having accomplished these objects, or\r\nsuch of them as may be practicable, you will return to Danville,\r\nand move on Paris.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the troops sent to Jackson and Humbolt can reach Paris by\r\nland as easily as to return to the transports.  This must depend on\r\nthe character of the roads and the position of the enemy.  All\r\ntelegraphic lines which can be reached must be cut.  The gunboats\r\nwill accompany the transports for their protection.  Any loyal\r\nTennesseeans who desire it, may be enlisted and supplied with arms.\r\nCompetent officers should be left to command Forts Henry and\r\nDonelson in your absence.  I have indicated in general terms the\r\nobject of this.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain on the 2d:\r\n\r\nCairo, March 1, 1862\r\n\r\nTo General GRANT:\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck, February 25th, telegraphs me: \"General Grant will\r\nsend no more forces to Clarksville.  General Smith's division will\r\ncome to Fort Henry, or a point higher up on the Tennessee River;\r\ntransports will also be collected at Paducah.  Two gunboats in\r\nTennessee River with Grant.  General Grant will immediately have\r\nsmall garrisons detailed for Forts Henry and Donelson, and all\r\nother forces made ready for the field\"\r\n\r\nFrom your letter of the 28th, I learn you were at Fort Donelson,\r\nand General Smith at Nashville, from which I infer you could not\r\nhave received orders.  Halleck's telegram of last night says: \"Who\r\nsent Smith's division to Nashville?  I ordered it across to the\r\nTennessee, where they are wanted immediately.  Order them back.\r\nSend all spare transports up Tennessee to General Grant.\"\r\nEvidently the general supposes you to be on the Tennessee.  I am\r\nsending all the transports I can find for you, reporting to General\r\nSherman for orders to go up the Cumberland for you, or, if you\r\nmarch across to Fort Henry, then to send them up the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nG. W. CULLUM, Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th came this dispatch:\r\n\r\nTo Major-General U. S. GRANT\r\n\r\nYou will place Major-General C. F. Smith in command of expedition,\r\nand remain yourself at Fort Henry.  Why do you not obey my orders\r\nto report strength and positions of your command?\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalleck was evidently working himself into a passion, but he was\r\ntoo far from the seat of war to make due allowance for the actual\r\nstate of facts.  General Grant had done so much, that General\r\nHalleck should have been patient.  Meantime, at Paducah, I was busy\r\nsending boats in every direction--some under the orders of General\r\nHalleck, others of General Cullum; others for General Grant, and\r\nstill others for General Buell at Nashville; and at the same time I\r\nwas organizing out of the new troops that were arriving at Paducah\r\na division for myself when allowed to take the field, which I had\r\nbeen promised by General Halleck.  His purpose was evidently to\r\noperate up the Tennessee River, to break up Bear Creek Bridge and\r\nthe railroad communications between the Mississippi and Tennessee\r\nRivers, and no doubt he was provoked that Generals Grant and Smith\r\nhad turned aside to Nashville.  In the mean time several of the\r\ngunboats, under Captain Phelps, United States Navy, had gone up the\r\nTennessee as far as Florence, and on their return had reported a\r\nstrong Union feeling among the people along the river.  On the 10th\r\nof March, having received the necessary orders from General\r\nHalleck, I embarked my division at Paducah.  It was composed of\r\nfour brigades.  The First, commanded by Colonel S. G. Hicks, was\r\ncomposed of the Fortieth Illinois, Forty-sixth Ohio, and Morton's\r\nIndiana Battery, on the boats Sallie List, Golden Gate, J. B.\r\nAdams, and Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThe Second Brigade, Colonel D. Stuart, was composed of the\r\nFifty-fifth Illinois, Seventy-first Ohio, and Fifty-fourth Ohio;\r\nembarked on the Hannibal, Universe, Hazel Dell, Cheeseman, and\r\nPrairie Rose.\r\n\r\nThe Third Brigade, Colonel Hildebrand, was composed of the\r\nSeventy-seventh Ohio, Fifty-seventh Ohio, and Fifty-third Ohio;\r\nembarked on the Poland, Anglo-Saxon, Ohio No. Three, and\r\nContinental.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Brigade, Colonel Buckland, was composed of the\r\nSeventy-second Ohio, Forty-eighth Ohio, and Seventieth Ohio;\r\nembarked on the Empress, Baltic, Shenango, and Marrengo.\r\n\r\nWe steamed up to Fort Henry, the river being high and in splendid\r\norder.  There I reported in person to General C. F. Smith, and by\r\nhim was ordered a few miles above, to the remains of the burned\r\nrailroad bridge, to await the rendezvous of the rest of his army.\r\nI had my headquarters on the Continental.\r\n\r\nAmong my colonels I had a strange character--Thomas Worthington,\r\ncolonel of the Forty-sixth Ohio.  He was a graduate of West Point,\r\nof the class of 1827; was, therefore, older than General Halleck,\r\nGeneral Grant, or myself, and claimed to know more of war than all\r\nof us put together.  In ascending the river he did not keep his\r\nplace in the column, but pushed on and reached Savannah a day\r\nbefore the rest of my division.  When I reached that place, I found\r\nthat Worthington had landed his regiment, and was flying about\r\ngiving orders, as though he were commander-in-chief.  I made him\r\nget back to his boat, and gave him to understand that he must\r\nthereafter keep his place.  General C. F. Smith arrived about the\r\n13th of March, with a large fleet of boats, containing Hurlbut's\r\ndivision, Lew. Wallace's division, and that of himself, then\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General W. H. L. Wallace.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith sent for me to meet him on his boat, and ordered me\r\nto push on under escort of the two gunboats, Lexington and Tyler,\r\ncommanded by Captains Gwin and Shirk, United States Navy.  I was to\r\nland at some point below Eastport, and make a break of the Memphis\r\n& Charleston Railroad, between Tuscumbia and Corinth.  General\r\nSmith was quite unwell, and was suffering from his leg, which was\r\nswollen and very sore, from a mere abrasion in stepping\r\ninto a small boat.  This actually mortified, and resulted in his\r\ndeath about a month after, viz., April 25, 1862.  He was\r\nadjutant of the Military Academy during the early part of my\r\ncareer there, and afterward commandant of cadets.  He was a very\r\nhandsome and soldierly man, of great experience, and at Donelson\r\nhad acted with so much personal bravery that to him many attributed\r\nthe success of the assault.\r\n\r\nI immediately steamed up the Tennessee River, following the two\r\ngunboats, and, in passing Pittsburg Landing, was told by Captain\r\nGwin that, on his former trip up the river, he had found a rebel\r\nregiment of cavalry posted there, and that it was the usual\r\nlanding-place for the people about Corinth, distant thirty miles.\r\nI sent word back to General Smith that, if we were detained up the\r\nriver, he ought to post some troops at Pittsburg Landing.  We went\r\non up the river cautiously, till we saw Eastport and Chickasaw,\r\nboth of which were occupied by rebel batteries and a small rebel\r\nforce of infantry.\r\n\r\nWe then dropped back quietly to the mouth of Yellow River, a few\r\nmiles below, whence led a road to Burnsville, a place on the\r\nMemphis & Charleston road, where were the company's repair-shops.\r\nWe at once commenced disembarking the command: first the cavalry,\r\nwhich started at once for Burnsville, with orders to tear up the\r\nrailroad-track, and burn the depots, shops, etc; and I followed\r\nwith the infantry and artillery as fast as they were disembarked.\r\nIt was raining very hard at the time.  Daylight found us about six\r\nmiles out, where we met the cavalry returning.  They had made\r\nnumerous attempts to cross the streams, which had become so swollen\r\nthat mere brooks covered the whole bottom; and my aide-de-camp,\r\nSanger, whom I had dispatched with the cavalry, reported the loss,\r\nby drowning, of several of the men.  The rain was pouring in\r\ntorrents, and reports from the rear came that the river was rising\r\nvery fast, and that, unless we got back to our boats soon, the\r\nbottom would be simply impassable.  There was no alternative but to\r\nregain our boats; and even this was so difficult, that we had to\r\nunharness the artillery-horses, and drag the guns under water\r\nthrough the bayous, to reach the bank of the river.  Once more\r\nembarked, I concluded to drop down to Pittsburg Landing, and to\r\nmake the attempt from there.  During the night of the 14th, we\r\ndropped down to Pittsburg Landing, where I found Hurlbut's division\r\nin boats.  Leaving my command there, I steamed down to Savannah,\r\nand reported to General Smith in person, who saw in the flooded\r\nTennessee the full truth of my report; and he then instructed me to\r\ndisembark my own division, and that of General Hurlbut, at\r\nPittsburg Landing; to take positions well back, and to leave room\r\nfor his whole army; telling me that he would soon come up in\r\nperson, and move out in force to make the lodgment on the railroad,\r\ncontemplated by General Halleck's orders.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel McPherson, of General C. F. Smith's, or rather\r\nGeneral Halleck's, staff, returned with me, and on the 16th of\r\nMarch we disembarked and marched out about ten miles toward\r\nCorinth, to a place called Monterey or Pea Ridge, where the rebels\r\nhad a cavalry regiment, which of course decamped on our approach,\r\nbut from the people we learned that trains were bringing large\r\nmasses of men from every direction into Corinth.  McPherson and I\r\nreconnoitred the ground well, and then returned to our boats.  On\r\nthe 18th, Hurlbut disembarked his division and took post about a\r\nmile and a half out, near where the roads branched, one leading to\r\nCorinth and the other toward Hamburg.  On the 19th I disembarked my\r\ndivision, and took post about three miles back, three of the\r\nbrigades covering the roads to Purdy and Corinth, and the other\r\nbrigade (Stuart's) temporarily at a place on the Hamburg Road, near\r\nLick Creek Ford, where the Bark Road came into the Hamburg Road.\r\nWithin a few days, Prentiss's division arrived and camped on my\r\nleft, and afterward McClernand's and W. H. L. Wallace's divisions,\r\nwhich formed a line to our rear.  Lew Wallace's division remained\r\non the north side of Snake Creek, on a road leading from Savannah\r\nor Cramp's Landing to Purdy.\r\n\r\nGeneral C. F. Smith remained back at Savannah, in chief command,\r\nand I was only responsible for my own division.  I kept pickets\r\nwell out on the roads, and made myself familiar with all the ground\r\ninside and outside my lines.  My personal staff was composed of\r\nCaptain J. H. Hammond, assistant adjutant-general; Surgeons\r\nHartshorn and L'Hommedieu; Lieutenant Colonels Hascall and\r\nSanger, inspector-generals; Lieutenants McCoy and John Taylor,\r\naides-de-camp.  We were all conscious that the enemy was collecting\r\nat Corinth, but in what force we could not know, nor did we know\r\nwhat was going on behind us.  On the 17th of March, General U. S.\r\nGrant was restored to the command of all the troops up the\r\nTennessee River, by reason of General Smith's extreme illness, and\r\nbecause he had explained to General Halleck satisfactorily his\r\nconduct after Donelson; and he too made his headquarters at\r\nSavannah, but frequently visited our camps.  I always acted on the\r\nsupposition that we were an invading army; that our purpose was to\r\nmove forward in force, make a lodgment on the Memphis & Charleston\r\nroad, and thus repeat the grand tactics of Fort Donelson, by\r\nseparating the rebels in the interior from those at Memphis and on\r\nthe Mississippi River.  We did not fortify our camps against an\r\nattack, because we had no orders to do so, and because such a\r\ncourse would have made our raw men timid.  The position was\r\nnaturally strong, with Snake Creek on our right, a deep, bold\r\nstream, with a confluent (Owl Creek) to our right front; and Lick\r\nCreek, with a similar confluent, on our left, thus narrowing the\r\nspace over which we could be attacked to about a mile and a half or\r\ntwo miles.\r\n\r\nAt a later period of the war, we could have rendered this position\r\nimpregnable in one night, but at this time we did not do it, and it\r\nmay be it is well we did not.  From about the 1st of April we were\r\nconscious that the rebel cavalry in our front was getting bolder\r\nand more saucy; and on Friday, the 4th of April, it dashed down and\r\ncarried off one of our picket-guards, composed of an officer and\r\nseven men, posted a couple of miles out on the Corinth road.\r\nColonel Buckland sent a company to its relief, then followed\r\nhimself with a regiment, and, fearing lest he might be worsted, I\r\ncalled out his whole brigade and followed some four or five miles,\r\nwhen the cavalry in advance encountered artillery.  I then, after\r\ndark, drew back to our lines, and reported the fact by letter to\r\nGeneral Grant, at Savannah; but thus far we had not positively\r\ndetected the presence of infantry, for cavalry regiments generally\r\nhad a couple of guns along, and I supposed the guns that opened on\r\nthe on the evening of Friday, April 4th, belonged to the cavalry\r\nthat was hovering along our whole front.\r\n\r\nSaturday passed in our camps without any unusual event, the weather\r\nbeing wet and mild, and the roads back to the steamboat landing\r\nbeing heavy with mud; but on Sunday morning, the 6th, early, there\r\nwas a good deal of picket-firing, and I got breakfast, rode out\r\nalong my lines, and, about four hundred yards to the front of\r\nAppler's regiment, received from some bushes in a ravine to the\r\nleft front a volley which killed my orderly, Holliday.  About the\r\nsame time I saw the rebel lines of battle in front coming down on\r\nus as far as the eye could reach.  All my troops were in line of\r\nbattle, ready, and the ground was favorable to us.  I gave the\r\nnecessary orders to the battery (Waterhouse's) attached to\r\nHildebrand's brigade, and cautioned the men to reserve their fire\r\ntill the rebels had crossed the ravine of Owl Creek, and had begun\r\nthe ascent; also, sent staff-officers to notify Generals McClernand\r\nand Prentiss of the coming blow.  Indeed, McClernand had already\r\nsent three regiments to the support of my left flank, and they were\r\nin position when the onset came.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the battle of \"Shiloh\" began with extreme fury,\r\nand lasted two days.  Its history has been well given, and it has\r\nbeen made the subject of a great deal of controversy.  Hildebrand's\r\nbrigade was soon knocked to pieces, but Buckland's and McDowell's\r\nkept their organization throughout.  Stuart's was driven back to\r\nthe river, and did not join me in person till the second day of the\r\nbattle.  I think my several reports of that battle are condensed\r\nand good, made on the spot, when all the names and facts were fresh\r\nin my memory, and are herewith given entire:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION\r\nPITTSBURG LANDING, March 17, 1862\r\n\r\nCaptain Wm.  McMICHAEL, Assistant Adjutant-General to General C. F\r\nSMITH, Savannah, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nSIR: Last night I dispatched a party of cavalry, at 6 p.m., under\r\nthe command of Lieutenant-Colonel Heath, Fifth Ohio Cavalry, for a\r\nstrong reconnoissance, if possible, to be converted into an attack\r\nupon the Memphis road.  The command got off punctually, followed at\r\ntwelve o'clock at night by the First Brigade of my division,\r\ncommanded by Colonel McDowell, the other brigades to follow in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nAbout one at night the cavalry returned, reporting the road\r\noccupied in force by the enemy, with whose advance-guard they\r\nskirmished, driving them back--about a mile, taking two prisoners,\r\nand having their chief guide, Thomas Maxwell, Esq., and three men\r\nof the Fourth Illinois wounded.\r\n\r\nInclosed please find the report of Lieutenant-Colonel Heath; also a\r\ncopy of his instructions, and the order of march.  As soon as the\r\ncavalry returned, I saw that an attempt on the road was frustrated,\r\nand accordingly have placed McDowell's brigade to our right front,\r\nguarding the pass of Snake Creek; Stuart's brigade to the left\r\nfront, to watch the pass of Lick Creek; and I shall this morning\r\nmove directly out on the Corinth road, about eight miles to or\r\ntoward Pea Ridge, which is a key-point to the southwest.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hurlbut's division will be landed to-day, and the artillery\r\nand infantry disposed so as to defend Pittsburg, leaving my\r\ndivision entire for any movement by land or water.\r\n\r\nAs near as I can learn, there are five regiments of rebel infantry\r\nat Purdy; at Corinth, and distributed along the railroad to Inca,\r\nare probably thirty thousand men; but my information from prisoners\r\nis very indistinct.  Every road and path is occupied by the enemy's\r\ncavalry, whose orders seem to be to fire a volley, retire, again\r\nfire and retire.  The force on the Purdy road attacked and driven\r\nby Major Bowman yesterday, was about sixty strong.  That\r\nencountered last night on the Corinth road was about five companies\r\nof Tennessee cavalry, sent from Purdy about 2 p.m.  yesterday.\r\n\r\nI hear there is a force of two regiments on Pea Ridge, at the point\r\nwhere the Purdy and Corinth roads come together.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied we cannot reach the Memphis & Charleston road\r\nwithout a considerable engagement, which is prohibited by General\r\nHalleck's instructions, so that I will be governed by your orders\r\nof yesterday, to occupy Pittsburg strongly, extend the pickets so\r\nas to include a semicircle of three miles, and push a strong\r\nreconnoissance as far out as Lick Creek and Pea Ridge.\r\n\r\nI will send down a good many boats to-day, to be employed as you\r\nmay direct; and would be obliged if you would send a couple of\r\nthousand sacks of corn, as much hay as you can possibly spare, and,\r\nif possible, a barge of coal.\r\n\r\nI will send a steamboat under care of the gunboat, to collect corn\r\nfrom cribs on the river-bank.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN,\r\nBrigadier-General, commanding First Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, STEAMBOAT CONTINENTAL,\r\nPittsburg, March 18, 1882.\r\n\r\nCaptain RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\nto General GRANT.\r\n\r\nSIR: The division surgeon having placed some one hundred or more\r\nsick on board the Fanny Bullitt, I have permitted her to take them\r\nto Savannah.  There is neither house nor building of any kind that\r\ncan be used for a hospital here.\r\n\r\nI hope to receive an order to establish floating hospitals, but in\r\nthe mean time, by the advise of the surgeon, allow these sick men\r\nto leave.  Let me hope that it will meet your approbation.\r\n\r\nThe order for debarkation came while General Sherman was absent\r\nwith three brigades, and no men are left to move the effects of\r\nthese brigades.\r\n\r\nThe landing, too, is small, with scarcely any chance to increase\r\nit; therefore there is a great accumulation of boats.  Colonel\r\nMcArthur has arrived, and is now cutting a landing for himself.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman will return this evening.  I am obliged to\r\ntransgress, and write myself in the mean time,\r\n\r\nRespectfully your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. H. HAMMOND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\nP. S--4 p.m.--Just back; have been half-way to Corinth and to\r\nPurdy.  All right.  Have just read this letter, and approve all but\r\nfloating hospitals; regimental surgeons can take care of all sick,\r\nexcept chronic cases, which can always be sent down to Paducah.\r\n\r\nMagnificent plain for camping and drilling, and a military point of\r\ngreat strength.  The enemy has felt us twice, at great loss and\r\ndemoralization; will report at length this evening; am now much\r\nworn out.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION\r\nPittsburg Landing, March 19, 1862.\r\n\r\nCaptain RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\nto General GRANT, Savannah, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have just returned from an extensive reconnoissance toward\r\nCorinth and Purdy, and am strongly impressed with the importance of\r\nthis position, both for its land advantages and its strategic\r\nposition.  The ground itself admits of easy defense by a small\r\ncommand, and yet affords admirable camping-ground for a hundred\r\nthousand men.  I will as soon as possible make or cause to be made\r\na topographical sketch of the position.  The only drawback is that,\r\nat this stage of water, the space for landing is contracted too\r\nmuch for the immense fleet now here discharging.\r\n\r\nI will push the loading and unloading of boats, but suggest that\r\nyou send at once (Captain Dodd, if possible) the best quartermaster\r\nyou can, that he may control and organize this whole matter.  I\r\nhave a good commissary, and will keep as few provisions afloat as\r\npossible.  Yours, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS SHERMAN'S DIVISION\r\nCamp Shiloh, near Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, April 2, 1862\r\n\r\nCaptain J. A. RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\nto General GRANT.\r\n\r\nSIR: In obedience to General Grant's instructions of March 31st,\r\nwith one section of Captain Muench's Minnesota Battery, two\r\ntwelve-pound howitzers, a detachment of Fifth Ohio Cavalry of one\r\nhundred and fifty men, under Major Ricker, and two battalions of\r\ninfantry from the Fifty-seventh and Seventy-seventh Ohio, under the\r\ncommand of Colonels Hildebrand and Mungen, I marched to the river,\r\nand embarked on the steamers Empress and Tecumseh.  The gunboat\r\nCairo did not arrive at Pittsburg, until after midnight, and at 6\r\np.m.  Captain Bryant, commanding the gunboat, notified me that he\r\nwas ready to proceed up the river.  I followed, keeping the\r\ntransports within about three hundred yards of the gunboat.  About\r\n1 p.m., the Cairo commenced shelling the battery above the mouth of\r\nIndian Creek, but elicited no reply.  She proceeded up the river\r\nsteadily and cautiously, followed close by the Tyler and Lexington,\r\nall throwing shells at the points where, on former visits of the\r\ngunboats, enemy's batteries were found.  In this order all\r\nfollowed, till it was demonstrated that all the enemy's batteries,\r\nincluding that at Chickasaw, were abandoned.\r\n\r\nI ordered the battalion of infantry under Colonel Hildebrand to\r\ndisembark at Eastport, and with the other battalion proceeded to\r\nChickasaw and landed.  The battery at this point had evidently been\r\nabandoned some time, and consisted of the remains of an old Indian\r\nmound, partly washed away by the river, which had been fashioned\r\ninto a two-gun battery, with a small magazine.  The ground to its\r\nrear had evidently been overflowed during the late freshet, and led\r\nto the removal of the guns to Eastport, where the batteries were on\r\nhigh, elevated ground, accessible at all seasons from the country\r\nto the rear.\r\n\r\nUpon personal inspection, I attach little importance to Chickasaw\r\nas a military position.  The people, who had fled during the\r\napproach of the gunboats, returned to the village, and said the\r\nplace had been occupied by one Tennessee regiment and a battery of\r\nartillery from Pensacola.  After remaining at Chickasaw some\r\nhours, all the boats dropped back to Eastport, not more than a mile\r\nbelow, and landed there.  Eastport Landing during the late freshet\r\nmust have been about twelve feet under water, but at the present\r\nstage the landing is the best I have seen on the Tennessee River.\r\n\r\nThe levee is clear of trees or snags, and a hundred boats could\r\nland there without confusion.\r\n\r\nThe soil is of sand and gravel, and very firm.  The road back is\r\nhard, and at a distance of about four hundred yards from the water\r\nbegin the gravel hills of the country.  The infantry scouts sent\r\nout by Colonel Hildebrand found the enemy's cavalry mounted, and\r\nwatching the Inca road, about two miles back of Eastport.  The\r\ndistance to Inca is only eight miles, and Inca is the nearest point\r\nand has the best road by which the Charleston & Memphis Railroad\r\ncan be reached.  I could obtain no certain information as to the\r\nstrength of the enemy there, but am satisfied that it would have\r\nbeen folly to have attempted it with my command.  Our object being\r\nto dislodge the enemy from the batteries recently erected near\r\nEastport, and this being attained, I have returned, and report the\r\nriver to be clear to and beyond Chickasaw.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN,\r\nBrigadier-General commanding Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION\r\nCAMP SHILOH, April 5, 1862.\r\n\r\nCaptain J. A. RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General, District of\r\nWestern Tennessee.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to report that yesterday, about 3 p.m., the\r\nlieutenant commanding and seven men of the advance pickets\r\nimprudently advanced from their posts and were captured.  I ordered\r\nMajor Ricker, of the Fifth Ohio Cavalry, to proceed rapidly to the\r\npicket-station, ascertain the truth, and act according to\r\ncircumstances.  He reached the station, found the pickets had been\r\ncaptured as reported, and that a company of infantry sent by the\r\nbrigade commander had gone forward in pursuit of some cavalry.  He\r\nrapidly advanced some two miles, and found them engaged, charged\r\nthe enemy, and drove them along the Ridge road, till he\r\nmet and received three discharges of artillery, when he very\r\nproperly wheeled under cover, and returned till he met me.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I heard artillery, I advanced with two regiments of\r\ninfantry, and took position, and remained until the scattered\r\ncompanies of infantry and cavalry had returned.  This was after\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI infer that the enemy is in some considerable force at Pea Ridge,\r\nthat yesterday morning they crossed a brigade of two regiments\r\nof infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and one battery of\r\nfield-artillery, to the ridge on which the Corinth road lies.  They\r\nhalted the infantry and artillery at a point abort five miles in my\r\nfront, sent a detachment to the lane of General Meeks, on the north\r\nof Owl Creek, and the cavalry down toward our camp.  This cavalry\r\ncaptured a part of our advance pickets, and afterward engaged the\r\ntwo companies of Colonel Buckland's regiment, as described by him\r\nin his report herewith inclosed.  Our cavalry drove them back upon\r\ntheir artillery and Infantry, killing many, and bringing off ten\r\nprisoners, all of the First Alabama Cavalry, whom I send to you.\r\n\r\nWe lost of the pickets one first-lieutenant and seven men of the\r\nOhio Seventieth Infantry (list inclosed); one major, one\r\nlieutenant, and one private of the Seventy-second Ohio, taken\r\nprisoners; eight privates wounded (names in full, embraced in\r\nreport of Colonel Buckland, inclosed herewith).\r\n\r\nWe took ten prisoners, and left two rebels wounded and many killed\r\non the field.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN,\r\nBrigadier-General, commanding Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION\r\nCamp Shiloh, April 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nCaptain J. A. RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\nto General GRANT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I had the honor to report that, on Friday the 4th inst., the\r\nenemy's cavalry drove in our pickets, posted about a mile and a\r\nhalf in advance of my centre, on the main Corinth road, capturing\r\none first-lieutenant and seven men; that I caused a pursuit by the\r\ncavalry of my division, driving them back about five miles, and\r\nkilling many.  On Saturday the enemy's cavalry was again very bold,\r\ncoming well down to our front; yet I did not believe they designed\r\nany thing but a strong demonstration.  On Sunday morning early, the\r\n6th inst., the enemy drove our advance-guard back on the main body,\r\nwhen I ordered under arms all my division, and sent word to General\r\nMcClernand, asking him to support my left; to General Prentiss,\r\ngiving him notice that the enemy was in our front in force, and to\r\nGeneral Hurlbut, asking him to support General Prentiss.  At that\r\ntime--7 A.M.--my division was arranged as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst Brigade, composed of the Sixth Iowa, Colonel J. A. McDowell;\r\n\r\nFortieth Illinois, Colonel Hicks; Forty-sixth Ohio, Colonel\r\nWorthington; and the Morton battery, Captain Behr, on the extreme\r\nright, guarding the bridge on the Purdy road over Owl Creek.\r\n\r\nSecond Brigade, composed of the Fifty-fifth Illinois, Colonel D.\r\nStuart; the Fifty-fourth Ohio, Colonel T. Kilby Smith; and the\r\nSeventy-first Ohio, Colonel Mason, on the extreme left, guarding\r\nthe ford over Lick Creek.\r\n\r\nThird Brigade, composed of the Seventy-seventh Ohio, Colonel\r\nHildebrand; the Fifty-third Ohio, Colonel Appler; and the\r\nFifty-seventh Ohio, Colonel Mungen, on the left of the Corinth\r\nroad, its right resting on Shiloh meeting-house.\r\n\r\nFourth Brigade, composed of the Seventy-second Ohio, Colonel\r\nBuckland; the Forty-eighth Ohio, Colonel Sullivan; and the\r\nSeventieth Ohio, Colonel Cookerill, on the right of the Corinth\r\nroad, its left resting on Shiloh meeting-house.\r\n\r\nTwo batteries of artillery--Taylor's and Waterhouse's--were posted,\r\nthe former at Shiloh, and the latter on a ridge to the left, with a\r\nfront-fire over open ground between Mungen's and Appler's\r\nregiments.  The cavalry, eight companies of the Fourth Illinois,\r\nunder Colonel Dickey, were posted in a large open field to the left\r\nand rear of Shiloh meeting-house, which I regarded as the centre of\r\nmy position.\r\n\r\nShortly after 7 A.M., with my entire staff, I rode along a portion\r\nof our front, and when in the open field before Appler's regiment,\r\nthe enemy's pickets opened a brisk fire upon my party, killing my\r\norderly, Thomas D. Holliday, of Company H, Second Illinois Cavalry.\r\nThe fire came from the bushes which line a small stream that rises\r\nin the field in front of Appler's camp, and flows to the north\r\nalong my whole front.\r\n\r\nThis valley afforded the enemy partial cover; but our men were so\r\nposted as to have a good fire at them as they crossed the valley\r\nand ascended the rising ground on our side.\r\n\r\nAbout 8 A.M.  I saw the glistening bayonets of heavy masses of\r\ninfantry to our left front in the woods beyond the small stream\r\nalluded to, and became satisfied for the first time that the enemy\r\ndesigned a determined attack on our whole camp.\r\n\r\nAll the regiments of my division were then in line of battle at\r\ntheir proper posts.  I rode to Colonel Appler, and ordered him to\r\nhold his ground at all hazards, as he held the left flank of our\r\nfirst line of battle, and I informed him that he had a good battery\r\non his right, and strong support to his rear.  General McClernand\r\nhad promptly and energetically responded to my request, and had\r\nsent me three regiments which were posted to protect Waterhouse's\r\nbattery and the left flank of my line.\r\n\r\nThe battle opened by the enemy's battery, in the woods to our\r\nfront, throwing shells into our camp.  Taylor's and Waterhouse's\r\nbatteries promptly responded, and I then observed heavy battalions\r\nof infantry passing obliquely to the left, across the open field in\r\nAppler's front; also, other columns advancing directly upon my\r\ndivision.  Our infantry and artillery opened along the whole line,\r\nand the battle became general.  Other heavy masses of the enemy's\r\nforces kept passing across the field to our left, and directing\r\ntheir course on General Prentiss.  I saw at once that the enemy\r\ndesigned to pass my left flank, and fall upon Generals McClernand\r\nand Prentiss, whose line of camps was almost parallel with the\r\nTennessee River, and about two miles back from it.  Very soon the\r\nsound of artillery and musketry announced that General Prentiss was\r\nengaged; and about 9 A. M. I judged that he was falling back.\r\nAbout this time Appler's regiment broke in disorder, followed by\r\nMungen's regiment, and the enemy pressed forward on Waterhouse's\r\nbattery thereby exposed.\r\n\r\nThe three Illinois regiments in immediate support of this battery\r\nstood for some time; but the enemy's advance was so vigorous, and\r\nthe fire so severe, that when Colonel Raith, of the Forty-third\r\nIllinois, received a severe wound and fell from his horse, his\r\nregiment and the others manifested disorder, and the enemy got\r\npossession of three guns of this (Waterhouse's) battery.  Although\r\nour left was thus turned, and the enemy was pressing our whole\r\nline, I deemed Shiloh so important, that I remained by it and\r\nrenewed my orders to Colonels McDowell and Buckland to hold their\r\nground; and we did hold these positions until about 10 A.M., when\r\nthe enemy had got his artillery to the rear of our left flank and\r\nsome change became absolutely necessary.  Two regiments of\r\nHildebrand's brigade--Appler's and Mungen's--had already\r\ndisappeared to the rear, and Hildebrand's own regiment was in\r\ndisorder.  I therefore gave orders for Taylor's battery--still at\r\nShiloh--to fall back as far as the Purdy and Hamburg road, and for\r\nMcDowell and Buckland to adopt that road as their new line.  I rode\r\nacross the angle and met Behr's battery at the cross-roads, and\r\nordered it immediately to come into battery, action right.  Captain\r\nBehr gave the order, but he was almost immediately shot from his\r\nhorse, when drivers and gunners fled in disorder, carrying off the\r\ncaissons, and abandoning five out of six guns, without firing a\r\nshot.  The enemy pressed on, gaining this battery, and we were\r\nagain forced to choose a new line of defense.  Hildebrand's brigade\r\nhad substantially disappeared from the field, though he himself\r\nbravely remained.  McDowell's and Buckland's brigades maintained\r\ntheir organizations, and were conducted by my aides, so as to join\r\non General McClernand's right, thus abandoning my original camps\r\nand line.  This was about 10 1/2 A.M., at which time the enemy had\r\nmade a furious attack on General McClernand's whole front.  He\r\nstraggled most determinedly, but, finding him pressed, I moved\r\nMcDowell's brigade directly against the left flank of the enemy,\r\nforced him back some distance, and then directed the men to avail\r\nthemselves of every cover-trees, fallen timber, and a wooded valley\r\nto our right.  We held this position for four long hours, sometimes\r\ngaining and at others losing ground; General McClernand and myself\r\nacting in perfect concert, and struggling to maintain this line.\r\nWhile we were so hard pressed, two Iowa regiments approached from\r\nthe rear, but could not be brought up to the severe fire that was\r\nraging in our front, and General Grant, who visited us on that\r\nground, will remember our situation about 3 p.m.; but about 4 p.m.\r\nit was evident that Hurlbut's line had been driven back to the\r\nriver; and knowing that General Lew Wallace was coming with\r\nreinforcements from Cramp's Landing, General McClernand and I, on\r\nconsultation, selected a new line of defense, with its right\r\ncovering a bridge by which General Wallace had to approach.  We\r\nfell back as well as we could, gathering in addition to our own\r\nsuch scattered forces as we could find, and formed the new line.\r\n\r\nDuring this change the enemy's cavalry charged us, but were\r\nhandsomely repulsed by the Twenty-ninth Illinois Regiment.  The\r\nFifth Ohio Battery, which had come up, rendered good service in\r\nholding the enemy in check for some time, and Major Taylor also\r\ncame up with another battery and got into position, just in time to\r\nget a good flank-fire upon the enemy's column, as he pressed on\r\nGeneral McClernand's right, checking his advance; when General\r\nMcClernand's division made a fine charge on the enemy and drove him\r\nback into the ravines to our front and right.  I had a clear field,\r\nabout two hundred yards wide, in my immediate front, and contented\r\nmyself with keeping the enemy's infantry at that distance during\r\nthe rest of the day.  In this position we rested for the night.\r\n\r\nMy command had become decidedly of a mixed character.  Buckland's\r\nbrigade was the only one that retained its organization.  Colonel\r\nHildebrand was personally there, but his brigade was not.  Colonel\r\nMcDowell had been severely injured by a fall off his horse, and had\r\ngone to the river, and the three regiments of his brigade were not\r\nin line.  The Thirteenth Missouri, Colonel Crafts J. Wright, had\r\nreported to me on the field, and fought well, retaining its\r\nregimental organization; and it formed a part of my line during\r\nSunday night and all Monday.  Other fragments of regiments and\r\ncompanies had also fallen into my division, and acted with it\r\nduring the remainder of the battle.  General Grant and Buell\r\nvisited me in our bivouac that evening, and from them I learned the\r\nsituation of affairs on other parts of the field.  General Wallace\r\narrived from Crump's Landing shortly after dark, and formed his\r\nline to my right rear.  It rained hard during the night, but our\r\nmen were in good spirits, lay on their arms, being satisfied with\r\nsuch bread and meat as could be gathered at the neighboring camps,\r\nand determined to redeem on Monday the losses of Sunday.\r\n\r\nAt daylight of Monday I received General Grant's orders to advance\r\nand recapture our original camps.  I dispatched several members of\r\nmy staff to bring up all the men they could find, especially the\r\nbrigade of Colonel Stuart, which had been separated from the\r\ndivision all the day before; and at the appointed time the\r\ndivision, or rather what remained of it, with the Thirteenth\r\nMissouri and other fragments, moved forward and reoccupied the\r\nground on the extreme right of General McClernand's camp, where we\r\nattracted the fire of a battery located near Colonel McDowell's\r\nformer headquarters.  Here I remained, patiently waiting for the\r\nsound of General Buell's advance upon the main Corinth road.  About\r\n10 A.M.  the heavy firing in that direction, and its steady\r\napproach, satisfied me; and General Wallace being on our right\r\nflank with his well-conducted division, I led the head of my column\r\nto General McClernand's right, formed line of battle, facing south,\r\nwith Buckland's brigade directly across the ridge, and Stuart's\r\nbrigade on its right in the woods; and thus advanced, steadily and\r\nslowly, under a heavy fire of musketry and artillery.  Taylor had\r\njust got to me from the rear, where he had gone for ammunition, and\r\nbrought up three guns, which I ordered into position, to advance by\r\nhand firing.  These guns belonged to Company A, Chicago Light\r\nArtillery, commanded by Lieutenant P. P. Wood, and did most\r\nexcellent service.  Under cover of their fire, we advanced till we\r\nreached the point where the Corinth road crosses the line of\r\nMcClernand's camp, and here I saw for the first time the\r\nwell-ordered and compact columns of General Buell's Kentucky\r\nforces, whose soldierly movements at once gave confidence to our\r\nnewer and less disciplined men.  Here I saw Willich's regiment\r\nadvance upon a point of water-oaks and thicket, behind which I knew\r\nthe enemy was in great strength, and enter it in beautiful style.\r\nThen arose the severest musketry-fire I ever heard, and lasted some\r\ntwenty minutes, when this splendid regiment had to fall back.  This\r\ngreen point of timber is about five hundred yards east of Shiloh\r\nmeeting-home, and it was evident here was to be the struggle.  The\r\nenemy could also be seen forming his lines to the south.  General\r\nMcClernand sending to me for artillery, I detached to him the three\r\nguns of Wood's battery, with which he speedily drove them back,\r\nand, seeing some others to the rear, I sent one of my staff to\r\nbring them forward, when, by almost providential decree, they\r\nproved to be two twenty-four pound howitzers belonging to\r\nMcAlister's battery, and served as well as guns ever could be.\r\n\r\nThis was about 2 p.m.  The enemy had one battery close by Shiloh,\r\nand another near the Hamburg road, both pouring grape and canister\r\nupon any column of troops that advanced upon the green point of\r\nwater-oaks.  Willich's regiment had been repulsed, but a whole\r\nbrigade of McCook's division advanced beautifully, deployed, and\r\nentered this dreaded wood.  I ordered my second brigade (then\r\ncommanded by Colonel T. Kilby Smith, Colonel Smart being wounded)\r\nto form on its right, and my fourth brigade, Colonel Buckland, on\r\nits right; all to advance abreast with this Kentucky brigade before\r\nmentioned, which I afterward found to be Rousseau's brigade of\r\nMcCook's division.  I gave personal direction to the twenty-four\r\npounder guns, whose well-directed fire first silenced the enemy's\r\nguns to the left, and afterward at the Shiloh meeting-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nRousseau's brigade moved in splendid order steadily to the front,\r\nsweeping every thing before it, and at 4 p.m.  we stood upon the\r\nground of our original front line; and the enemy was in full\r\nretreat.  I directed my several brigades to resume at once their\r\noriginal camps.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the battle, cartridges gave out; but General\r\nGrant had thoughtfully kept a supply coming from the rear.  When I\r\nappealed to regiments to stand fast, although out of cartridges, I\r\ndid so because, to retire a regiment for any cause, has a bad\r\neffect on others.  I commend the Fortieth Illinois and Thirteenth\r\nMissouri for thus holding their ground under heavy fire, although\r\ntheir cartridge-boxes were empty.\r\n\r\nI am ordered by General Grant to give personal credit where I think\r\nit is due, and censure where I think it merited.  I concede that\r\nGeneral McCook's splendid division from Kentucky drove back the\r\nenemy along the Corinth road, which was the great centre of this\r\nfield of battle, where Beauregard commanded in person, supported by\r\nBragg's, Polk's, and Breckenridge's divisions.  I think Johnston\r\nwas killed by exposing himself in front of his troops, at the time\r\nof their attack on Buckland's brigade on Sunday morning; although\r\nin this I may be mistaken.\r\n\r\nMy division was made up of regiments perfectly new, nearly all\r\nhaving received their muskets for the first time at Paducah.  None\r\nof them had ever been under fire or beheld heavy columns of an\r\nenemy bearing down on them as they did on last Sunday.\r\n\r\nTo expect of them the coolness and steadiness of older troops would\r\nbe wrong.  They knew not the value of combination and organization.\r\nWhen individual fears seized them, the first impulse was to get\r\naway.  My third brigade did break much too soon, and I am not yet\r\nadvised where they were during Sunday afternoon and Monday morning.\r\nColonel Hildebrand, its commander, was as cool as any man I ever\r\nsaw, and no one could have made stronger efforts to hold his men to\r\ntheir places than he did.  He kept his own regiment with individual\r\nexceptions in hand, an hour after Appler's and Mungen's regiments\r\nhad left their proper field of action.  Colonel Buckland managed\r\nhis brigade well.  I commend him to your notice as a cool,\r\nintelligent, and judicious gentleman, needing only confidence and\r\nexperience, to make a good commander.  His subordinates, Colonels\r\nSullivan and Cockerill, behaved with great gallantry; the former\r\nreceiving a severe wound on Sunday, and yet commanding and holding\r\nhis regiment well in hand all day, and on Monday, until his right\r\narm was broken by a shot.  Colonel Cookerill held a larger\r\nproportion of his men than any colonel in my division, and was with\r\nme from first to last.\r\n\r\nColonel J. A. McDowell, commanding the first brigade, held his\r\nground on Sunday, till I ordered him to fall back, which he did in\r\nline of battle; and when ordered, he conducted the attack on the\r\nenemy's left in good style.  In falling back to the next position,\r\nhe was thrown from his horse and injured, and his brigade was not\r\nin position on Monday morning.  His subordinates, Colonels Hicks\r\nand Worthington, displayed great personal courage.  Colonel Hicks\r\nled his regiment in the attack on Sunday, and received a wound,\r\nwhich it is feared may prove mortal.  He is a brave and gallant\r\ngentleman, and deserves well of his country.  Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nWalcutt, of the Ohio Forty-sixth, was severely wounded on Sunday,\r\nand has been disabled ever since.  My second brigade, Colonel\r\nStuart, was detached nearly two miles from my headquarters.  He had\r\nto fight his own battle on Sunday, against superior numbers, as the\r\nenemy interposed between him and General Prentiss early in the day.\r\nColonel Stuart was wounded severely, and yet reported for duty on\r\nMonday morning, but was compelled to leave during the day, when the\r\ncommand devolved on Colonel T. Kilby Smith, who was always in the\r\nthickest of the fight, and led the brigade handsomely.\r\n\r\nI have not yet received Colonel Stuart's report of the operations\r\nof his brigade during the time he was detached, and must therefore\r\nforbear to mention names.  Lieutenant-Colonel Kyle, of the\r\nSeventy-first, was mortally wounded on Sunday, but the regiment\r\nitself I did not see, as only a small fragment of it was with the\r\nbrigade when it joined the division on Monday morning.  Great\r\ncredit is due the fragments of men of the disordered regiments who\r\nkept in the advance.  I observed and noticed them, but until the\r\nbrigadiers and colonels make their reports, I cannot venture to\r\nname individuals, but will in due season notice all who kept in our\r\nfront line, as well as those who preferred to keep back near the\r\nsteamboat-landing.  I will also send a full list of the killed,\r\nwounded, and missing, by name, rank, company, and regiment.  At\r\npresent I submit the result in figures:\r\n\r\n[Summary of General Sherman's detailed  table:]\r\nKilled ........................  318\r\nWounded ....................... 1275\r\nMissing .......................  441\r\nAggregate loss in the division: 2034\r\n\r\nThe enemy captured seven of our guns on Sunday, but on Monday we\r\nrecovered seven; not the identical guns we had lost, but enough in\r\nnumber to balance the account.  At the time of recovering our camps\r\nour men were so fatigued that we could not follow the retreating\r\nmasses of the enemy; but on the following day I followed up with\r\nBuckland's and Hildebrand's brigade for six miles, the result of\r\nwhich I have already reported.\r\n\r\nOf my personal staff, I can only speak with praise and thanks.  I\r\nthink they smelled as much gunpowder and heard as many cannon-balls\r\nand bullets as must satisfy their ambition.  Captain Hammond, my\r\nchief of staff, though in feeble health, was very active in\r\nrallying broken troops, encouraging the steadfast and aiding to\r\nform the lines of defense and attack.  I recommend him to your\r\nnotice.  Major Sanger's intelligence, quick perception, and rapid\r\nexecution, were of very great value to me, especially in bringing\r\ninto line the batteries that cooperated so efficiently in our\r\nmovements.  Captains McCoy and Dayton, aides-de-camp, were with me\r\nall the time, carrying orders, and acting with coolness, spirit,\r\nand courage.  To Surgeon Hartshorne and Dr. L'Hommedieu hundreds of\r\nwounded men are indebted for the kind and excellent treatment\r\nreceived on the field of battle and in the various temporary\r\nhospitals created along the line of our operations.  They worked\r\nday and night, and did not rest till all the wounded of our own\r\ntroops as well as of the enemy were in safe and comfortable\r\nshelter.  To Major Taylor, chief of artillery, I feel under deep\r\nobligations, for his good sense and judgment in managing the\r\nbatteries, on which so much depended.  I inclose his report and\r\nindorse his recommendations.  The cavalry of my command kept to the\r\nrear, and took little part in the action; but it would have been\r\nmadness to have exposed horses to the musketry-fire under which we\r\nwere compelled to remain from Sunday at 8 A.M. till Monday at\r\n4 p.m. Captain Kossack, of the engineers, was with me all the time,\r\nand was of great assistance.  I inclose his sketch of the\r\nbattlefield, which is the best I have seen, and which will enable\r\nyou to see the various positions occupied by my division, as well as\r\nof the others that participated in the battle.  I will also send in,\r\nduring the day, the detailed reports of my brigadiers and colonels,\r\nand will indorse them with such remarks as I deem proper.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN,\r\nBrigadier-General commanding Fifth Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION\r\nTuesday, April 8,1862\r\n\r\nSir: With the cavalry placed at my command and two brigades of my\r\nfatigued troops, I went this morning out on the Corinth road.  One\r\nafter another of the abandoned camps of the enemy lined the roads,\r\nwith hospital flags for their protection; at all we found more or\r\nless wounded and dead men.  At the forks of the road I found the\r\nhead of General T. J. Wood's division of Buell's Army.  I ordered\r\ncavalry to examine both roads leading toward Corinth, and found the\r\nenemy on both.  Colonel Dickey, of the Fourth Illinois Cavalry,\r\nasking for reenforcements, I ordered General Wood to advance the\r\nhead of his column cautiously on the left-hand road, while I\r\nconducted the head of the third brigade of my division up the\r\nright-hand road.  About half a mile from the forks was a clear\r\nfield, through which the road passed, and, immediately beyond, a\r\nspace of some two hundred yards of fallen timber, and beyond that\r\nan extensive rebel camp.  The enemy's cavalry could be seen in this\r\ncamp; after reconnoisance, I ordered the two advance companies of\r\nthe Ohio Seventy-seventh, Colonel Hildebrand, to deploy forward as\r\nskirmishers, and the regiment itself forward into line, with an\r\ninterval of one hundred yards.  In this order we advanced\r\ncautiously until the skirmishers were engaged.  Taking it for\r\ngranted this disposition would clear the camp, I held Colonel\r\nDickey's Fourth Illinois Cavalry ready for the charge.  The enemy's\r\ncavalry came down boldly at a charge, led by General Forrest in\r\nperson, breaking through our line of skirmishers; when the regiment\r\nof infantry, without cause, broke, threw away their muskets, and\r\nfled.  The ground was admirably adapted for a defense of infantry\r\nagainst cavalry, being miry and covered with fallen timber.\r\n\r\nAs the regiment of infantry broke, Dickey's Cavalry began to\r\ndischarge their carbines, and fell into disorder.  I instantly sent\r\norders to the rear for the brigade to form line of battle, which\r\nwas promptly executed.  The broken infantry and cavalry rallied on\r\nthis line, and, as the enemy's cavalry came to it, our cavalry in\r\nturn charged and drove them from the field.  I advanced the entire\r\nbrigade over the same ground and sent Colonel Dickey's cavalry a\r\nmile farther on the road.  On examining the ground which had been\r\noccupied by the Seventy-seventh Ohio, we found fifteen of our men\r\ndead and about twenty-five wounded.  I sent for wagons and had all\r\nthe wounded carried back to camp, and caused the dead to be buried,\r\nalso the whole rebel camp to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHere we found much ammunition for field-pieces, which was\r\ndestroyed; also two caissons, and a general hospital, with about\r\ntwo hundred and eighty Confederate wounded, and about fifty of our\r\nown wounded men.  Not having the means of bringing them off,\r\nColonel Dickey, by my orders, took a surrender, signed by the\r\nmedical director (Lyle) and by all the attending surgeons, and a\r\npledge to report themselves to you as prisoners of war; also a\r\npledge that our wounded should be carefully attended to, and\r\nsurrendered to us to-morrow as soon as ambulances could go out.  I\r\ninclose this written document, and request that you cause wagons or\r\nambulances for our wounded to be sent to-morrow, and that wagons'\r\nbe sent to bring in the many tents belonging to us which are\r\npitched along the road for four miles out.  I did not destroy them,\r\nbecause I knew the enemy could not move them.  The roads are very\r\nbad, and are strewed with abandoned wagons, ambulances, and\r\nlimber-boxes.  The enemy has succeeded in carrying off the guns,\r\nbut has crippled his batteries by abandoning the hind limber-boxes\r\nof at least twenty caissons.  I am satisfied the enemy's infantry\r\nand artillery passed Lick Creek this morning, traveling all of last\r\nnight, and that he left to his rear all his cavalry, which has\r\nprotected his retreat; but signs of confusion and disorder mark the\r\nwhole road.  The check sustained by us at the fallen timber delayed\r\nour advance, so that night came upon us before the wounded were\r\nprovided for and the dead buried, and our troops being fagged out\r\nby three days' hard fighting, exposure, and privation, I ordered\r\nthem back to their camps, where they now are.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.T. SHERMAN\r\nBrigadier-General commanding Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant did not make an official report of the battle of\r\nShiloh, but all its incidents and events were covered by the\r\nreports of division commanders and Subordinates.  Probably no\r\nsingle battle of the war gave rise to such wild and damaging\r\nreports.  It was publicly asserted at the North that our army was\r\ntaken completely by surprise; that the rebels caught us in our\r\ntents; bayoneted the men in their beds; that General Grant was\r\ndrunk; that Buell's opportune arrival saved the Army of the\r\nTennessee from utter annihilation, etc.  These reports were in a\r\nmeasure sustained by the published opinions of Generals Buell,\r\nNelson, and others, who had reached the steamboat-landing from the\r\neast, just before nightfall of the 6th, when there was a large\r\ncrowd of frightened, stampeded men, who clamored and declared that\r\nour army was all destroyed and beaten.  Personally I saw General\r\nGrant, who with his staff visited me about 10 A.M.  of the 6th,\r\nwhen we were desperately engaged.  But we had checked the headlong\r\nassault of our enemy, and then held our ground.  This gave him\r\ngreat satisfaction, and he told me that things did not look as well\r\nover on the left.  He also told me that on his way up from Savannah\r\nthat morning he had stopped at Crump's Landing, and had ordered Lew\r\nWallace's division to cross over Snake Creek, so as to come up on\r\nmy right, telling me to look out for him.  He came again just\r\nbefore dark, and described the last assault made by the rebels at\r\nthe ravine, near the steamboat-landing, which he had repelled by a\r\nheavy battery collected under Colonel J. D. Webster and other\r\nofficers, and he was convinced that the battle was over for that\r\nday.  He ordered me to be ready to assume the offensive in the\r\nmorning, saying that, as he had observed at Fort Donelson at the\r\ncrisis of the battle, both sides seemed defeated, and whoever\r\nassumed the offensive was sure to win.  General Grant also\r\nexplained to me that General Buell had reached the bank of the\r\nTennessee River opposite Pittsburg Landing, and was in the act of\r\nferrying his troops across at the time he was speaking to me.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour afterward General Buell himself rode up to where\r\nI was, accompanied by Colonels Fry, Michler, and others of his\r\nstaff.  I was dismounted at the time, and General Buell made of me\r\na good many significant inquiries about matters and things\r\ngenerally.  By the aid of a manuscript map made by myself, I\r\npointed out to him our positions as they had been in the morning,\r\nand our then positions; I also explained that my right then covered\r\nthe bridge over Snake Creek by which we had all day been expecting\r\nLew Wallace; that McClernand was on my left, Hurlbut on his left,\r\nand so on.  But Buell said he had come up from the landing, and had\r\nnot seen our men, of whose existence in fact he seemed to doubt.  I\r\ninsisted that I had five thousand good men still left in line, and\r\nthought that McClernand had as many more, and that with what was\r\nleft of Hurlbut's, W. H. L. Wallace's, and Prentiss's divisions, we\r\nought to have eighteen thousand men fit for battle.  I reckoned\r\nthat ten thousand of our men were dead, wounded, or prisoners, and\r\nthat the enemy's loss could not be much less.  Buell said that\r\nNelson's, McCook's, and Crittendens divisions of his army,\r\ncontaining eighteen thousand men, had arrived and could cross over\r\nin the night, and be ready for the next day's battle.  I argued\r\nthat with these reenforcements we could sweep the field.  Buell\r\nseemed to mistrust us, and repeatedly said that he did not like the\r\nlooks of things, especially about the boat-landing,--and I really\r\nfeared he would not cross over his army that night, lest he should\r\nbecome involved in our general disaster.  He did not, of course,\r\nunderstand the shape of the ground, and asked me for the use of my\r\nmap, which I lent him on the promise that he would return it.  He\r\nhanded it to Major Michler to have it copied, and the original\r\nreturned to me, which Michler did two or three days after the\r\nbattle.  Buell did cross over that night, and the next day we\r\nassumed the offensive and swept the field, thus gaining the battle\r\ndecisively.  Nevertheless, the controversy was started and kept up,\r\nmostly to the personal prejudice of General Grant, who as usual\r\nmaintained an imperturbable silence.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle, a constant stream of civilian surgeons, and\r\nsanitary commission agents, men and women, came up the Tennessee to\r\nbring relief to the thousands of maimed and wounded soldiers for\r\nwhom we had imperfect means of shelter and care.  These people\r\ncaught up the camp-stories, which on their return home they\r\nretailed through their local papers, usually elevating their own\r\nneighbors into heroes, but decrying all others: Among them was\r\nLieutenant-Governor Stanton, of Ohio, who published in Belfontaine,\r\nOhio, a most abusive article about General Grant and his\r\nsubordinate generals.  As General Grant did not and would not take\r\nup the cudgels, I did so.  My letter in reply to Stanton, dated\r\nJune 10, 1862, was published in the Cincinnati Commercial soon\r\nafter its date.  To this Lieutenant-Governor Stanton replied, and I\r\nfurther rejoined in a letter dated July 12, 1862.  These letters\r\nare too personal to be revived.  By this time the good people of\r\nthe North had begun to have their eyes opened, and to give us in\r\nthe field more faith and support.  Stanton was never again elected\r\nto any public office, and was commonly spoken of as \"the late Mr.\r\nStanton.\"  He is now dead, and I doubt not in life he often\r\nregretted his mistake in attempting to gain popular fame by abusing\r\nthe army-leaders, then as now an easy and favorite mode of gaining\r\nnotoriety, if not popularity.  Of course, subsequent events gave\r\nGeneral Grant and most of the other actors in that battle their\r\nappropriate place in history, but the danger of sudden popular\r\nclamors is well illustrated by this case.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing, was one of the most\r\nfiercely contested of the war.  On the morning of April 6, 1862,\r\nthe five divisions of McClernand, Prentiss, Hurlbut, W. H. L.\r\nWallace, and Sherman, aggregated about thirty-two thousand men.  We\r\nhad no intrenchments of any sort, on the theory that as soon as\r\nBuell arrived we would march to Corinth to attack the enemy.  The\r\nrebel army, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston, was,\r\naccording to their own reports and admissions, forty-five thousand\r\nstrong, had the momentum of attack, and beyond all question fought\r\nskillfully from early morning till about 2 A.M., when their\r\ncommander-in-chief was killed by a Mini-ball in the calf of his\r\nleg, which penetrated the boot and severed the main artery.  There\r\nwas then a perceptible lull for a couple of hours, when the attack\r\nwas renewed, but with much less vehemence, and continued up to\r\ndark.  Early at night the division of Lew Wallace arrived from the\r\nother side of Snake Creek, not having fired a shot.  A very small\r\npart of General Buell's army was on our side of the Tennessee River\r\nthat evening, and their loss was trivial.\r\n\r\nDuring that night, the three divisions of McCook, Nelson, and\r\nCrittenden, were ferried across the Tennessee, and fought with us\r\nthe next day (7th).  During that night, also, the two wooden\r\ngunboats, Tyler, commanded by Lieutenant Groin, and Lexington,\r\nLieutenant Shirk, both of the regular navy, caused shells to be\r\nthrown toward that part of the field of battle known to be occupied\r\nby the enemy.  Beauregard afterward reported his entire loss as ten\r\nthousand six hundred and ninety-nine.  Our aggregate loss, made up\r\nfrom official statements, shows seventeen hundred killed, seven\r\nthousand four hundred and ninety-five wounded, and three thousand\r\nand twenty-two prisoners; aggregate, twelve thousand two hundred\r\nand seventeen, of which twenty-one hundred and sixty-seven were in\r\nBuell's army, leaving for that of Grant ten thousand and fifty.\r\nThis result is a fair measure of the amount of fighting done by\r\neach army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSHILOH TO MEMPHIS.\r\n\r\nAPRIL TO JULY, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile, the \"Army of the Tennessee,\" under Generals Grant and C. F.\r\nSmith, was operating up the Tennessee River, another force, styled\r\nthe \"Army of the Mississippi,\" commanded by Major-General John\r\nPope, was moving directly down the Mississippi River, against that\r\nportion of the rebel line which, under Generals Polk and Pillow,\r\nhad fallen back from Columbus, Kentucky, to Island Number Ten and\r\nNew Madrid.  This army had the full cooperation of the gunboat\r\nfleet, commanded by Admiral Foote, and was assisted by the high\r\nflood of that season, which enabled General Pope, by great skill\r\nand industry, to open a canal from a point above Island Number Ten\r\nto New Madrid below, by which he interposed between the rebel army\r\nand its available line of supply and retreat.  At the very time\r\nthat we were fighting the bloody battle on the Tennessee River,\r\nGeneral Pope and Admiral Foote were bombarding the batteries on\r\nIsland Number Ten, and the Kentucky shore abreast of it; and\r\nGeneral Pope having crossed over by steamers a part of his army to\r\nthe east bank, captured a large part of this rebel army, at and\r\nnear Tiptonville.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck still remained at St. Louis, whence he gave general\r\ndirections to the armies of General Curtis, Generals Grant, Buell,\r\nand Pope; and instead of following up his most important and\r\nbrilliant successes directly down the Mississippi, he concluded to\r\nbring General Pope's army around to the Tennessee, and to come in\r\nperson to command there.  The gunboat fleet pushed on down the\r\nMississippi, but was brought up again all standing by the heavy\r\nbatteries at Fort Pillow, about fifty miles above Memphis.  About\r\nthis time Admiral Farragut, with another large sea-going fleet, and\r\nwith the cooperating army of General Butler, was entering the\r\nMississippi River by the Passes, and preparing to reduce Forts\r\nJackson and St, Philip in order to reach New Orleans; so that all\r\nminds were turned to the conquest of the Mississippi River, and\r\nsurely adequate means were provided for the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Shiloh had been fought, as described, on the 6th and\r\n7th of April; and when the movement of the 8th had revealed that\r\nour enemy was gone, in full retreat, leaving killed, wounded, and\r\nmuch property by the way, we all experienced a feeling of relief.\r\nThe struggle had been so long, so desperate and bloody, that the\r\nsurvivors seemed exhausted and nerveless; we appreciated the value\r\nof the victory, but realized also its great cost of life.  The\r\nclose of the battle had left the Army of the Tennessee on the\r\nright, and the Army of the Ohio on the left; but I believe neither\r\nGeneral Grant nor Buell exercised command, the one over the other;\r\neach of them having his hands full in repairing damages.  All the\r\ndivision, brigade, and regimental commanders were busy in\r\ncollecting stragglers, regaining lost property, in burying dead men\r\nand horses, and in providing for their wounded.  Some few new\r\nregiments came forward, and some changes of organization became\r\nnecessary.  Then, or very soon after, I consolidated my font\r\nbrigades into three, which were commanded: First, Brigadier-General\r\nMorgan L: Smith; Second, Colonel John A. McDowell; Third,\r\nBrigadier-General J. W. Denver.  About the same time I was promoted\r\nto major-general volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe Seventy-first Ohio was detached to Clarksville, Tennessee, and\r\nthe Sixth and Eighth Missouri were transferred to my division.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after the battle, General Halleck arrived by\r\nsteamboat from St. Louis, pitched his camp near the steamboat-\r\nlanding, and assumed personal command of all the armies.  He was\r\nattended by his staff, composed of General G. W. Cullum, U. S.\r\nEngineers, as his chief of staff; Colonel George Thom, U. S.\r\nEngineers; and Colonels Kelton and Kemper, adjutants-general.  It\r\nsoon became manifest that his mind had been prejudiced by the\r\nrumors which had gone forth to the detriment of General Grant; for\r\nin a few days he issued an order, reorganizing and rearranging the\r\nwhole army.  General Buell's Army of the Ohio constituted the\r\ncentre; General Pope's army, then arriving at Hamburg Landing, was\r\nthe left; the right was made up of mine and Hurlbut's divisions,\r\nbelonging to the old Army of the Tennessee, and two new ones, made\r\nup from the fragments of the divisions of Prentiss and C. F. Smith,\r\nand of troops transferred thereto, commanded by Generals T. W.\r\nSherman and Davies.  General George H. Thomas was taken from Buell,\r\nto command the right.  McClernand's and Lew Wallace's divisions\r\nwere styled the reserve, to be commanded by McClernand.  General\r\nGrant was substantially left out, and was named \"second in\r\ncommand,\" according to some French notion, with no clear,\r\nwell-defined command or authority.  He still retained his old\r\nstaff, composed of Rawlins, adjutant-general; Riggin, Lagow, and\r\nHilyer, aides; and he had a small company of the Fourth Illinois\r\nCavalry as an escort.  For more than a month he thus remained,\r\nwithout any apparent authority, frequently visiting me and others,\r\nand rarely complaining; but I could see that he felt deeply the\r\nindignity, if not insult, heaped upon him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas at once assumed command of the right wing, and,\r\nuntil we reached Corinth, I served immediately under his command.\r\nWe were classmates, intimately acquainted, had served together\r\nbefore in the old army, and in Kentucky, and it made to us little\r\ndifference who commanded the other, provided the good cause\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nCorinth was about thirty miles distant, and we all knew that we\r\nshould find there the same army with which we had so fiercely\r\ngrappled at Shiloh, reorganized, reenforced, and commanded in chief\r\nby General Beauregard in place of Johnston, who had fallen at\r\nShiloh.  But we were also reenforced by Buell's and Pope's armies;\r\nso that before the end of April our army extended from Snake Creek\r\non the right to the Tennessee River, at Hamburg, on the left, and\r\nmust have numbered nearly one hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nAmple supplies of all kinds reached us by the Tennessee River,\r\nwhich had a good stage of water; but our wagon transportation was\r\nlimited, and much confusion occurred in hauling supplies to the\r\nseveral camps.  By the end of Aril, the several armies seemed to be\r\nready, and the general forward movement on Corinth began.  My\r\ndivision was on the extreme right of the right wing, and marched\r\nout by the \"White House,\" leaving Monterey or Pea Ridge to the\r\nsouth.  Crossing Lick Creek, we came into the main road about a\r\nmile south of Monterey, where we turned square to the right, and\r\ncame into the Purdy road, near \"Elams.\"  Thence we followed the\r\nPurdy road to Corinth, my skirmishers reaching at all times the\r\nMobile & Ohio Railroad.  Of course our marches were governed by the\r\nmain centre, which followed the direct road from Pittsburg Landing\r\nto Corinth; and this movement was provokingly slow.  We fortified\r\nalmost every camp at night, though we had encountered no serious\r\nopposition, except from cavalry, which gave ground easily as we\r\nadvanced.  The opposition increased as we neared Corinth, and at a\r\nplace called Russell's we had a sharp affair of one brigade, under\r\nthe immediate direction of Brigadier-General Morgan L. Smith,\r\nassisted by the brigade of General Denver.  This affair occurred on\r\nthe 19th of May, and our line was then within about two miles of\r\nthe northern intrenchments of Corinth.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th I received orders from General Halleck \"to send a force\r\nthe next day to drive the rebels from the house in our front, on\r\nthe Corinth road, to drive in their pickets as far as possible, and\r\nto make a strong demonstration on Corinth itself;\" authorizing me\r\nto call on any adjacent division for assistance.\r\n\r\nI reconnoitred the ground carefully, and found that the main road\r\nled forward along the fence of a large cotton-field to our right\r\nfront, and ascended a wooded hill, occupied in some force by the\r\nenemy, on which was the farm-house referred to in General Halleck's\r\norders.  At the farther end of the field was a double log-house,\r\nwhose chinking had been removed; so that it formed a good block\r\nhouse from which the enemy could fire on any person approaching\r\nfrom our quarter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hurlbut's division was on my immediate left, and General\r\nMcClernand's reserve on our right rear.  I asked of each the\r\nassistance of a brigade.  The former sent General Veatch's, and the\r\nlatter General John A. Logan's brigade.  I asked the former to\r\nsupport our left flank, and the latter our right flank.  The next\r\nmorning early, Morgan L. Smith's brigade was deployed under cover\r\non the left, and Denver's on the right, ready to move forward\r\nrapidly at a signal.  I had a battery of four twenty-pound Parrott\r\nguns, commanded by Captain Silversparre.  Colonel Ezra Taylor,\r\nchief of artillery, had two of these guns moved up silently by hand\r\nbehind a small knoll, from the crest of which the enemy's\r\nblock-house and position could be distinctly seen; when all were\r\nready, these guns were moved to the crest, and several quick rounds\r\nwere fired at the house, followed after an interval by a single\r\ngun.  This was the signal agreed on, and the troops responded\r\nbeautifully, crossed the field in line of battle, preceded by their\r\nskirmishers who carried the position in good style, and pursued the\r\nenemy for half a mile beyond.\r\n\r\nThe main line halted on the crest of the ridge, from which we could\r\nlook over the parapets of the rebel works at Corinth, and hear\r\ntheir drum and bugle calls.  The rebel brigade had evidently been\r\ntaken by surprise in our attack; it soon rallied and came back on\r\nus with the usual yell, driving in our skirmishers, but was quickly\r\nchecked when it came within range of our guns and line of battle.\r\nGenerals Grant and Thomas happened to be with me during this\r\naffair, and were well pleased at the handsome manner in which the\r\ntroops behaved.  That night we began the usual entrenchments, and\r\nthe next day brought forward the artillery and the rest of the\r\ndivision, which then extended from the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, at\r\nBowie Hill Out, to the Corinth & Purdy road, there connecting with\r\nHurlbut's division.  That night, viz., May 29th, we heard unusual\r\nsounds in Corinth, the constant whistling of locomotives, and soon\r\nafter daylight occurred a series of explosions followed by a dense\r\nsmoke rising high over the town.  There was a telegraph line\r\nconnecting my headquarters with those of General Halleck, about\r\nfour miles off, on the Hamburg road.  I inquired if he knew the\r\ncause of the explosions and of the smoke, and he answered to\r\n\"advance with my division and feel the enemy if still in my front\"\r\nI immediately dispatched two regiments from each of my three\r\nbrigades to feel the immediate front, and in a very short time\r\nadvanced with the whole division.  Each brigade found the rebel\r\nparapets abandoned, and pushed straight for the town, which lies in\r\nthe northeast angle of intersection of the Mobile & Ohio and\r\nMemphis & Charleston Railroads.  Many buildings had been burned by\r\nthe enemy on evacuation, which had begun the night before at 6\r\np.m., and continued through the night, the rear-guard burning their\r\nmagazine at the time of withdrawing, about daybreak.  Morgan L.\r\nSmith's brigade followed the retreating rear-guard some four miles\r\nto the Tuacumbia Bridge, which was found burned.  I halted the\r\nother brigades at the college, about a mile to the southwest of the\r\ntown, where I was overtaken by General Thomas in person.\r\n\r\nThe heads of all the columns had entered the rebel lines about the\r\nsame time, and there was some rather foolish clamor for the first\r\nhonors, but in fact there was no honor in the event.  Beauregard\r\nhad made a clean retreat to the south, and was only seriously\r\npursued by cavalry from General Pope's flank.  But he reached\r\nTupelo, where he halted for reorganization; and there is no doubt\r\nthat at the moment there was much disorganization in his ranks, for\r\nthe woods were full of deserters whom we did not even take\r\nprisoners, but advised them to make their way home and stay there.\r\nWe spent the day at and near the college, when General Thomas, who\r\napplied for orders at Halleck's headquarters, directed me to\r\nconduct my division back to the camp of the night before, where we\r\nhad left our trains The advance on Corinth had occupied all of the\r\nmonth of May, the most beautiful and valuable month of the year for\r\ncampaigning in this latitude.  There had been little fighting, save\r\non General Pope's left flank about Farmington; and on our right.  I\r\nesteemed it a magnificent drill, as it served for the instruction\r\nof our men in guard and picket duty, and in habituating them to\r\nout-door life; and by the time we had reached Corinth I believe\r\nthat army was the best then on this continent, and could have gone\r\nwhere it pleased.  The four subdivisions were well commanded, as\r\nwere the divisions and brigades of the whole army.  General Halleck\r\nwas a man of great capacity, of large acquirements, and at the time\r\npossessed the confidence of the country, and of most of the army.\r\nI held him in high estimation, and gave him credit for the\r\ncombinations which had resulted in placing this magnificent army of\r\na hundred thousand men, well equipped and provided, with a good\r\nbase, at Corinth, from which he could move in any direction.\r\n\r\nHad he held his force as a unit, he could have gone to Mobile, or\r\nVicksburg, or anywhere in that region, which would by one move have\r\nsolved the whole Mississippi problem; and, from what he then told\r\nme, I believe he intended such a campaign, but was overruled from\r\nWashington.  Be that as it may, the army had no sooner settled down\r\nat Corinth before it was scattered: General Pope was called to the\r\nEast, and his army distributed among the others; General Thomas was\r\nrelieved from the command of the right wing, and reassigned to his\r\ndivision in the Army of the Ohio; and that whole army under General\r\nBuell was turned east along the Memphis & Charleston road, to march\r\nfor Chattanooga.  McClernand's \"reserve\" was turned west to Bolivar\r\nand Memphis.  General Halleck took post himself at Corinth,\r\nassigned Lieutenant-Colonel McPherson to take charge of the\r\nrailroads, with instructions to repair them as far as Columbus,\r\nKentucky, and to collect cars and locomotives to operate them to\r\nCorinth and Grand Junction.  I was soon dispatched with my own and\r\nHurlbut's divisions northwest fourteen miles to Chewalla, to save\r\nwhat could be of any value out of six trains of cars belonging to\r\nthe rebels which had been wrecked and partially burned at the time\r\nof the evacuation of Corinth.\r\n\r\nA short time before leaving Corinth I rode from my camp to General\r\nHalleck's headquarters, then in tents just outside of the town,\r\nwhere we sat and gossiped for some time, when he mentioned to me\r\ncasually that General Grant was going away the next morning.  I\r\ninquired the cause, and he said that he did not know, but that\r\nGrant had applied for a thirty days' leave, which had been given\r\nhim.  Of course we all knew that he was chafing under the slights\r\nof his anomalous position, and I determined to see him on my way\r\nback.  His camp was a short distance off the Monterey road, in the\r\nwoods, and consisted of four or five tents, with a sapling railing\r\naround the front.  As I rode up, Majors Rawlins, Lagow, and Hilyer,\r\nwere in front of the camp, and piled up near them were the usual\r\noffice and camp chests, all ready for a start in the morning.  I\r\ninquired for the general, and was shown to his tent, where I found\r\nhim seated on a camp-stool, with papers on a rude camp-table; he\r\nseemed to be employed in assorting letters, and tying them up with\r\nred tape into convenient bundles.  After passing the usual\r\ncompliments, I inquired if it were true that he was going away.  He\r\nsaid, \"Yes.\"  I then inquired the reason, and he said \"Sherman, you\r\nknow.  You know that I am in the way here.  I have stood it as long\r\nas I can, and can endure it no longer.\"  I inquired where he was\r\ngoing to, and he said, \"St. Louis.\"  I then asked if he had any\r\nbusiness there, and he said, \"Not a bit.\"  I then begged him to\r\nstay, illustrating his case by my own.\r\n\r\nBefore the battle of Shiloh, I had been cast down by a mere\r\nnewspaper assertion of \"crazy;\" but that single battle had given me\r\nnew life, and now I was in high feather; and I argued with him\r\nthat, if he went away, events would go right along, and he would be\r\nleft out; whereas, if he remained, some happy accident might\r\nrestore him to favor and his true place.  He certainly appreciated\r\nmy friendly advice, and promised to wait awhile; at all events, not\r\nto go without seeing me again, or communicating with me.  Very soon\r\nafter this, I was ordered to Chewalla, where, on the 6th of June, I\r\nreceived a note from him, saying that he had reconsidered his\r\nintention, and would remain.  I cannot find the note, but my answer\r\nI have kept:\r\n\r\nChewalla, Jane 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nMajor-General GRANT.\r\n\r\nMy DEAR SIR: I have just received your note, and am rejoiced at\r\nyour conclusion to remain; for you could not be quiet at home for a\r\nweek when armies were moving, and rest could not relieve your mind\r\nof the gnawing sensation that injustice had been done you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy orders at Chewalla were to rescue the wrecked trains there, to\r\nreconnoitre westward and estimate the amount of damage to the\r\nrailroad as far as Grand Junction, about fifty miles.  We camped\r\nour troops on high, healthy ground to the south of Chewalla, and\r\nafter I had personally reconnoitred the country, details of men\r\nwere made and volunteer locomotive engineers obtained to\r\nsuperintend the repairs.  I found six locomotives and about sixty\r\ncars, thrown from the track, parts of the machinery detached and\r\nhidden in the surrounding swamp, and all damaged as much by fire as\r\npossible.  It seems that these trains were inside of Corinth during\r\nthe night of evacuation, loading up with all sorts of commissary\r\nstores, etc., and about daylight were started west; but the\r\ncavalry-picket stationed at the Tuscumbia bridge had, by mistake or\r\npanic, burned the bridge before the trains got to them.  The\r\ntrains, therefore, were caught, and the engineers and guards\r\nhastily scattered the stores into the swamp, and disabled the\r\ntrains as far as they could, before our cavalry had discovered\r\ntheir critical situation.  The weather was hot, and the swamp\r\nfairly stunk with the putrid flour and fermenting sugar and\r\nmolasses; I was so much exposed there in the hot sun, pushing\r\nforward the work, that I got a touch of malarial fever, which hung\r\non me for a month, and forced me to ride two days in an ambulance,\r\nthe only time I ever did such a thing during the whole war.  By the\r\n7th I reported to General Halleck that the amount of work necessary\r\nto reestablish the railroad between Corinth and Grand Junction was\r\nso great, that he concluded not to attempt its repair, but to rely\r\non the road back to Jackson (Tennessee), and forward to Grand\r\nJunction; and I was ordered to move to Grand Junction, to take up\r\nthe repairs from there toward Memphis.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Corinth by Beauregard, and the movements of\r\nGeneral McClernand's force toward Memphis, had necessitated the\r\nevacuation of Fort Pillow, which occurred about June 1st; soon\r\nfollowed by the further withdrawal of the Confederate army from\r\nMemphis, by reason of the destruction of the rebel gunboats in the\r\nbold and dashing attack by our gun-boats under command of Admiral\r\nDavis, who had succeeded Foote.  This occurred June 7th.  Admiral\r\nFarragut had also captured New Orleans after the terrible passage\r\nof Forts Jackson and St. Philip on May 24th, and had ascended the\r\nriver as high as Vicksburg; so that it seemed as though, before the\r\nend of June, we should surely have full possession of the whole\r\nriver.  But it is now known that the progress of our Western armies\r\nhad aroused the rebel government to the exercise of the most\r\nstupendous energy.  Every man capable of bearing arms at the South\r\nwas declared to be a soldier, and forced to act as such.  All their\r\narmies were greatly reenforced, and the most despotic power was\r\ngranted to enforce discipline and supplies.  Beauregard was\r\nreplaced by Bragg, a man of more ability--of greater powers of\r\norganization, of action, and discipline--but naturally exacting and\r\nsevere, and not possessing the qualities to attract the love of his\r\nofficers and men.  He had a hard task to bring into order and\r\ndiscipline that mass of men to whose command he succeeded at\r\nTupelo, with which he afterward fairly outmanoeuvred General Buell,\r\nand forced him back from Chattanooga to Louisville.  It was a fatal\r\nmistake, however, that halted General Halleck at Corinth, and led\r\nhim to disperse and scatter the best materials for a fighting army\r\nthat, up to that date, had been assembled in the West.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of June and first half of July, I had my own\r\nand Hurlbut's divisions about Grand Junction, Lagrange, Moscow, and\r\nLafayette, building railroad-trestles and bridges, fighting off\r\ncavalry detachments coming from the south, and waging an\r\neverlasting quarrel with planters about their negroes and fences\r\n--they trying, in the midst of moving armies, to raise a crop of\r\ncorn.  On the 17th of June I sent a detachment of two brigades,\r\nunder General M. L. Smith, to Holly Springs, in the belief that I\r\ncould better protect the railroad from some point in front than\r\nby scattering our men along it; and, on the 23d, I was at\r\nLafayette Station, when General Grant, with his staff and a very\r\ninsignificant escort, arrived from Corinth en route for Memphis, to\r\ntake command of that place and of the District of West Tennessee.\r\nHe came very near falling into the hands of the enemy, who infested\r\nthe whole country with small but bold detachments of cavalry.  Up\r\nto that time I had received my orders direct from General Halleck\r\nat Corinth, but soon after I fell under the immediate command of\r\nGeneral Grant and so continued to the end of the war; but, on the\r\n29th, General Halleck notified me that \"a division of troops under\r\nGeneral C. S. Hamilton of 'Rosecrans's army corps,' had passed the\r\nHatchie from Corinth,\" and was destined for Holly Springs, ordering\r\nme to \"cooperate as far as advisable,\" but \"not to neglect the\r\nprotection of the road.\"  I ordered General Hurlbut to leave\r\ndetachments at Grand Junction and Lagrange, and to march for Holly\r\nSprings.  I left detachments at Moscow and Lafayette, and, with\r\nabout four thousand men, marched for the same point.  Hurlbut and I\r\nmet at Hudsonville, and thence marched to the Coldwater, within\r\nfour miles of Holly Springs.  We encountered only small detachments\r\nof rebel cavalry under Colonels Jackson and Pierson, and drove them\r\ninto and through Holly Springs; but they hung about, and I kept an\r\ninfantry brigade in Holly Springs to keep them out.  I heard\r\nnothing from General Hamilton till the 5th of July, when I received\r\na letter from him dated Rienzi, saying that he had been within\r\nnineteen miles of Holly Springs and had turned back for Corinth;\r\nand on the next day, July 6th, I got a telegraph order from General\r\nHalleck, of July 2d, sent me by courier from Moscow, \"not to\r\nattempt to hold Holly Springs, but to fall back and protect the\r\nrailroad.\"  We accordingly marched back twenty-five miles--Hurlbut\r\nto Lagrange, and I to Moscow.  The enemy had no infantry nearer\r\nthan the Tallahatchee bridge, but their cavalry was saucy and\r\nactive, superior to ours, and I despaired of ever protecting a\r\nrailroad, preventing a broad front of one hundred miles, from their\r\ndashes.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, we were taunted by the Confederate soldiers and\r\ncitizens with the assertion that Lee had defeated McClellan at\r\nRichmond; that he would soon be in Washington; and that our turn\r\nwould come next.  The extreme caution of General Halleck also\r\nindicated that something had gone wrong, and, on the 16th of July,\r\nat Moscow, I received a dispatch from him, announcing that he had\r\nbeen summoned to Washington, which he seemed to regret, and which\r\nat that moment I most deeply deplored.  He announced that his\r\ncommand would devolve on General Grant, who had been summoned\r\naround from Memphis to Corinth by way of Columbus, Kentucky, and\r\nthat I was to go into Memphis to take command of the District of\r\nWest Tennessee, vacated by General Grant.  By this time, also, I\r\nwas made aware that the great, army that had assembled at Corinth\r\nat the end of May had been scattered and dissipated, and that\r\nterrible disasters had befallen our other armies in Virginia and\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nI soon received orders to move to Memphis, taking Hurlbut's\r\ndivision along.  We reached Memphis on the 21st, and on the 22d I\r\nposted my three brigades mostly in and near Fort Dickering, and\r\nHurlbut's division next below on the river-bank by reason of the\r\nscarcity of water, except in the Mississippi River itself.  The\r\nweather was intensely hot.  The same order that took us to Memphis\r\nrequired me to send the division of General Lew Wallace (then\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General A. P. Hovey) to Helena, Arkansas, to\r\nreport to General Curtis, which was easily accomplished by\r\nsteamboat.  I made my own camp in a vacant lot, near Mr. Moon's\r\nhouse, and gave my chief attention to the construction of Fort\r\nPickering, then in charge of Major Prime, United States Engineers;\r\nto perfecting the drill and discipline of the two divisions under\r\nmy command; and to the administration of civil affairs.\r\n\r\nAt the time when General Halleck was  summoned from Corinth to\r\nWashington, to succeed McClellan as commander-in-chief, I surely\r\nexpected of him immediate and important results.  The Army of the\r\nOhio was at the time marching toward Chattanooga, and was strung\r\nfrom Eastport by Huntsville to Bridgeport, under the command of\r\nGeneral Buell.  In like manner, the Army of the Tennessee was\r\nstrung along the same general line, from Memphis to Tuscumbia, and\r\nwas commanded by General Grant, with no common commander for both\r\nthese forces: so that the great army which General Halleck had so\r\nwell assembled at Corinth, was put on the defensive, with a\r\nfrontage of three hundred miles.  Soon thereafter the rebels\r\ndisplayed peculiar energy and military skill.  General Bragg had\r\nreorganized the army of Beauregard at Tupelo, carried it rapidly\r\nand skillfully toward Chattanooga, whence he boldly assumed the\r\noffensive, moving straight for Nashville and Louisville, and\r\ncompelling General Buell to fall back to the Ohio River at\r\nLouisville.\r\n\r\nThe army of Van Dorn and Price had been brought from the\r\ntrans-Mississippi Department to the east of the river, and was\r\ncollected at and about Holly Springs, where, reenforced by\r\nArmstrong's and Forrests cavalry, it amounted to about forty\r\nthousand brave and hardy soldiers.  These were General Grant's\r\nimmediate antagonists, and so many and large detachments had been\r\ndrawn from him, that for a time he was put on the defensive.  In\r\nperson he had his headquarters at Corinth, with the three divisions\r\nof Hamilton, Davies, and McKean, under the immediate orders of\r\nGeneral Rosecrans.  General Ord had succeeded to the division of\r\nMcClernand (who had also gone to Washington), and held Bolivar and\r\nGrand Junction.  I had in Memphis my own and Hurlbut's divisions,\r\nand other smaller detachments were strung along the Memphis &\r\nCharleston road.  But the enemy's detachments could strike this\r\nroad at so many points, that no use could be made of it, and\r\nGeneral Grant had to employ the railroads, from Columbus, Kentucky,\r\nto Corinth and Grand Junction, by way of Jackson, Tennessee, a\r\npoint common to both roads, and held in some force.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of September the enemy in our front manifested\r\ngreat activity, feeling with cavalry at all points, and on the 13th\r\nGeneral Van Dorn threatened Corinth, while General Price seized the\r\ntown of Iuka, which was promptly abandoned by a small garrison\r\nunder Colonel Murphy.  Price's force was about eight thousand men,\r\nand the general impression was that he was en route for Eastport,\r\nwith the purpose to cross the Tennessee River in the direction of\r\nNashville, in aid of General Bragg, then in full career for\r\nKentucky.  General Grant determined to attack him in force,\r\nprepared to regain Corinth before Van Dorn could reach it.  He had\r\ndrawn Ord to Corinth, and moved him, by Burnsville, on Iuka, by the\r\nmain road, twenty-six miles.  General Grant accompanied this column\r\nas far as Burnsville.  At the same time he had dispatched Rosecrans\r\nby roads to the south, via Jacinto, with orders to approach Iuka by\r\nthe two main roads, coming into Iuka from the south, viz., they\r\nJacinto and Fulton roads.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th General Ord encountered the enemy about four miles out\r\nof Iuka.  His orders contemplated that he should not make a serious\r\nattack, until Rosecrans had gained his position on the south; but,\r\nas usual, Rosecrans had encountered difficulties in the confusion\r\nof roads, his head of column did not reach the vicinity of Iuka\r\ntill 4 p.m.  of the 19th, and then his troops were long drawn out\r\non the single Jacinto road, leaving the Fulton road clear for\r\nPrice's use.  Price perceived his advantage, and attacked with\r\nvehemence the head of Rosecrans's column, Hamilton's division,\r\nbeating it back, capturing a battery, and killing and disabling\r\nseven hundred and thirty-six men, so that when night closed in\r\nRosecrans was driven to the defensive, and Price, perceiving his\r\ndanger, deliberately withdrew by the Fulton road, and the next\r\nmorning was gone.  Although General Ord must have been within four\r\nor six miles of this battle, he did not hear a sound; and he or\r\nGeneral Grant did not know of it till advised the next morning by a\r\ncourier who had made a wide circuit to reach them.  General Grant\r\nwas much offended with General Rosecrans because of this affair,\r\nbut in my experience these concerted movements generally fail,\r\nunless with the very best kind of troops, and then in a country on\r\nwhose roads some reliance can be placed, which is not the case in\r\nNorthern Mississippi.  If Price was aiming for Tennessee; he\r\nfailed, and was therefore beaten.  He made a wide circuit by the\r\nsouth, and again joined Van Dorn.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of September, at Memphis, I received an order from\r\nGeneral Grant dated the 2d, to send Hurlbut's division to\r\nBrownsville, in the direction of Bolivar, thence to report by\r\nletter to him at Jackson.  The division started the same day, and,\r\nas our men and officers had been together side by side from the\r\nfirst landing at Shiloh, we felt the parting like the breaking up\r\nof a family.  But General Grant was forced to use every man, for he\r\nknew well that Van Dorn could attack him at pleasure, at any point\r\nof his long line.  To be the better prepared, on the 23d of\r\nSeptember he took post himself at Jackson, Tennessee, with a small\r\nreserve force, and gave Rosecrans command of Corinth, with his\r\nthree divisions and some detachments, aggregating about twenty\r\nthousand men.  He posted General Ord with his own and Hurlbut'a\r\ndivisions at Bolivar, with outposts toward Grand Junction and\r\nLagrange.  These amounted to nine or ten thousand men, and I held\r\nMemphis with my own division, amounting to about six thousand men.\r\nThe whole of General Grant's men at that time may have aggregated\r\nfifty thousand, but he had to defend a frontage of a hundred and\r\nfifty miles, guard some two hundred miles of railway, and as much\r\nriver.  Van Dom had forty thousand men, united, at perfect liberty\r\nto move in any direction, and to choose his own point of attack,\r\nunder cover of woods, and a superior body of cavalry, familiar with\r\nevery foot of the ground.  Therefore General Grant had good reason\r\nfor telegraphing to General Halleck, on the 1st of October, that\r\nhis position was precarious, \"but I hope to get out of it all\r\nright.\"  In Memphis my business was to hold fast that important\r\nflank, and by that date Fort Dickering had been made very strong,\r\nand capable of perfect defense by a single brigade.  I therefore\r\nendeavored by excursions to threaten Van Dorn's detachments to the\r\nsoutheast and east.  I repeatedly sent out strong detachments\r\ntoward Holly Springs, which was his main depot of supply; and\r\nGeneral Grierson, with his Sixth Illinois, the only cavalry I had,\r\nmade some bold and successful dashes at the Coldwater, compelling\r\nVan Dorn to cover it by Armstrong's whole division of cavalry.\r\nStill, by the 1st of October, General Grant was satisfied that the\r\nenemy was meditating an attack in force on Bolivar or Corinth; and\r\non the 2d Van Dorn made his appearance near Corinth, with his\r\nentire army.  On the 3d he moved down on that place from the north\r\nand northwest, General Roseerana went out some four miles to meet\r\nhim, but was worsted and compelled to fall back within the line of\r\nhis forts.  These had been began under General Halleck, but were\r\nmuch strengthened by General Grant, and consisted of several\r\ndetached redoubts, bearing on each other, and inclosing the town\r\nand the depots of stores at the intersection of the two railroads.\r\nVan Dorn closed down on the forts by the evening of the 3d, and on\r\nthe morning of the 4th assaulted with great vehemence.  Our men,\r\ncovered by good parapets, fought gallantly, and defended their\r\nposts well, inflicting terrible losses on the enemy, so that by\r\nnoon the rebels were repulsed at all points, and drew off, leaving\r\ntheir dead and wounded in our hands.  Their losses, were variously\r\nestimated, but the whole truth will probably never be known, for in\r\nthat army reports and returns were not the fashion.  General\r\nRosecrans admitted his own loss to be three hundred and fifteen\r\nkilled, eighteen hundred and twelve wounded, and two hundred and\r\nthirty-two missing or prisoners, and claimed on the part of the\r\nrebels fourteen hundred and twenty-three dead, two thousand and\r\ntwenty-five prisoners and wounded.  Of course, most of the wounded\r\nmust have gone off or been carried off, so that, beyond doubt, the\r\nrebel army lost at Corinth fully six thousand men.\r\n\r\nMeantime, General Grant, at Jackson, had dispatched Brigadier-\r\nGeneral McPherson, with a brigade, directly for Corinth, which\r\nreached General Rosecrans after the battle; and, in anticipation of\r\nhis victory, had ordered him to pursue instantly, notifying him\r\nthat he had ordered Ord's and Hurlbut's divisions rapidly across to\r\nPocahontas, so as to strike the rebels in flank.  On the morning of\r\nthe 5th, General Ord reached the Hatchie River, at Davies bridge,\r\nwith four thousand men; crossed over and encountered the retreating\r\narmy, captured a battery and several hundred prisoners, dispersing\r\nthe rebel advance, and forcing the main column to make a wide\r\ncircuit by the south in order to cross the Hatchie River.  Had\r\nGeneral Rosecrans pursued promptly, and been on the heels of this\r\nmass of confused and routed men, Van Dorn's army would surely have\r\nbeen utterly ruined; as it was, Van Dom regained Holly Springs\r\nsomewhat demoralized.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosecrans did not begin his pursuit till the next morning,\r\nthe 5th, and it was then too late.  General Grant was again\r\ndispleased with him, and never became fully reconciled.  General\r\nRosecrans was soon after relieved, and transferred to the Army of\r\nthe Cumberland, in Tennessee, of which he afterward obtained the\r\ncommand, in place of General Buell, who was removed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the battle of Corinth was very great.  It was,\r\nindeed, a decisive blow to the Confederate cause in our quarter,\r\nand changed the whole aspect of affairs in West Tennessee.  From\r\nthe timid defensive we were at once enabled to assume the bold\r\noffensive.  In Memphis I could see its effects upon the citizens,\r\nand they openly admitted that their cause had sustained a\r\ndeath-blow.  But the rebel government was then at its maximum\r\nstrength; Van Dorn was reenforced, and very soon Lieutenant-General\r\nJ. C. Pemberton arrived and assumed the command, adopting for his\r\nline the Tallahatchie River, with an advance-guard along the\r\nColdwater, and smaller detachments forward at Grand Junction and\r\nHernando.  General Grant, in like manner, was reenforced by new\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nOut of those which were assigned to Memphis, I organized two new\r\nbrigades, and placed them under officers who had gained skill and\r\nexperience during the previous campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMEMPHIS TO ARKANSAS POST.\r\n\r\nJULY, 1882 TO JANUARY, 1883\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we first entered Memphis, July 21,1862, I found the place\r\ndead; no business doing, the stores closed, churches, schools, and\r\nevery thing shut up.  The people were all more or less in sympathy\r\nwith our enemies, and there was a strong prospect that the whole\r\ncivil population would become a dead weight on our hands.  Inasmuch\r\nas the Mississippi River was then in our possession northward, and\r\nsteamboats were freely plying with passengers and freight, I caused\r\nall the stores to be opened, churches, schools, theatres, and\r\nplaces of amusement, to be reestablished, and very soon Memphis\r\nresumed its appearance of an active, busy, prosperous place.  I\r\nalso restored the mayor (whose name was Parks) and the city\r\ngovernment to the performance of their public functions, and\r\nrequired them to maintain a good civil police.\r\n\r\nUp to that date neither Congress nor the President had made any\r\nclear, well-defined rules touching the negro slaves, and the\r\ndifferent generals had issued orders according to their own\r\npolitical sentiments.  Both Generals Halleck and Grant regarded the\r\nslave as still a slave, only that the labor of the slave belonged\r\nto his owner, if faithful to the Union, or to the United States, if\r\nthe master had taken up arms against the Government, or adhered to\r\nthe fortunes of the rebellion.  Therefore, in Memphis, we received\r\nall fugitives, put them to work on the fortifications, supplied\r\nthem with food and clothing, and reserved the question of payment\r\nof wages for future decision.  No force was allowed to be used to\r\nrestore a fugitive slave to his master in any event; but if the\r\nmaster proved his loyalty, he was usually permitted to see his\r\nslave, and, if he could persuade him to return home, it was\r\npermitted.  Cotton, also, was a fruitful subject of controversy.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury; Mr. Chase, was extremely anxious at\r\nthat particular time to promote the purchase of cotton, because\r\neach bale was worth, in gold, about three hundred dollars, and\r\nanswered the purpose of coin in our foreign exchanges.  He\r\ntherefore encouraged the trade, so that hundreds of greedy\r\nspeculators flocked down the Mississippi, and resorted to all sorts\r\nof measures to obtain cotton from the interior, often purchasing it\r\nfrom negroes who did not own it, but who knew where it was\r\nconcealed.  This whole business was taken from the jurisdiction of\r\nthe military, and committed to Treasury agents appointed by Mr.\r\nChase.\r\n\r\nOther questions absorbed the attention of military commanders; and\r\nby way of illustration I here insert a few letters from my\r\n\"letter-book,\" which contains hundreds on similar subjects:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION\r\nMemphis, Tennessee, August 11, 1862\r\n\r\nHon. S. P. CHASE, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nSir: Your letter of August 2d, just received, invites my discussion\r\nof the cotton question.\r\n\r\nI will write plainly and slowly, because I know you have no time to\r\nlisten to trifles.  This is no trifle; when one nation is at war\r\nwith another, all the people of the one are enemies of the other:\r\nthen the rules are plain and easy of understanding.  Most\r\nunfortunately, the war in which we are now engaged has been\r\ncomplicated with the belief on the one hand that all on the other\r\nare not enemies.  It would have been better if, at the outset, this\r\nmistake had not been made, and it is wrong longer to be misled by\r\nit.  The Government of the United States may now safely proceed on\r\nthe proper rule that all in the South are enemies of all in the\r\nNorth; and not only are they unfriendly, but all who can procure\r\narms now bear them as organized regiments, or as guerrillas.  There\r\nis not a garrison in Tennessee where a man can go beyond the sight\r\nof the flag-staff without being shot or captured.  It so happened\r\nthat these people had cotton, and, whenever they apprehended our\r\nlarge armies would move, they destroyed the cotton in the belief\r\nthat, of course, we world seize it, and convert it to our use.\r\nThey did not and could not dream that we would pay money for it.\r\nIt had been condemned to destruction by their own acknowledged\r\ngovernment, and was therefore lost to their people; and could have\r\nbeen, without injustice, taken by us, and sent away, either as\r\nabsolute prize of war, or for future compensation.  But the\r\ncommercial enterprise of the Jews soon discovered that ten cents\r\nwould buy a pound of cotton behind our army; that four cents would\r\ntake it to Boston, where they could receive thirty cents in gold.\r\nThe bait was too tempting, and it spread like fire, when here they\r\ndiscovered that salt, bacon, powder, fire-arms, percussion-caps,\r\netc., etc., were worth as much as gold; and, strange to say, this\r\ntraffic was not only permitted, but encouraged.  Before we in the\r\ninterior could know it, hundreds, yea thousands of barrels of salt\r\nand millions of dollars had been disbursed; and I have no doubt\r\nthat Bragg's army at Tupelo, and Van Dorn's at Vicksburg, received\r\nenough salt to make bacon, without which they could not have moved\r\ntheir armies in mass; and that from ten to twenty thousand fresh\r\narms, and a due supply of cartridges, have also been got, I am\r\nequally satisfied.  As soon as I got to Memphis, having seen the\r\neffect in the interior, I ordered (only as to my own command) that\r\ngold, silver, and Treasury notes, were contraband of war, and\r\nshould not go into the interior, where all were hostile.  It is\r\nidle to talk about Union men here: many want peace, and fear war\r\nand its results; but all prefer a Southern, independent government,\r\nand are fighting or working for it.  Every gold dollar that was\r\nspent for cotton, was sent to the seaboard, to be exchanged for\r\nbank-notes and Confederate scrip, which will buy goods here, and\r\nare taken in ordinary transactions.  I therefore required cotton to\r\nbe paid for in such notes, by an obligation to pay at the end of\r\nthe war, or by a deposit of the price in the hands of a trustee,\r\nviz., the United States Quartermaster.  Under these rules cotton is\r\nbeing obtained about as fast as by any other process, and yet the\r\nenemy receives no \"aid or comfort.\"  Under the \"gold\" rule, the\r\ncountry people who had concealed their cotton from the burners, and\r\nwho openly scorned our greenbacks, were willing enough to take\r\nTennessee money, which will buy their groceries; but now that the\r\ntrade is to be encouraged, and gold paid out, I admit that cotton\r\nwill be sent in by our open enemies, who can make better use of\r\ngold than they can of their hidden bales of cotton.\r\n\r\nI may not appreciate the foreign aspect of the question, but my\r\nviews on this may be ventured.  If England ever threatens war\r\nbecause we don't furnish her cotton, tell her plainly if she can't\r\nemploy and feed her own people, to send them here, where they\r\ncannot only earn an honest living, but soon secure independence by\r\nmoderate labor.  We are not bound to furnish her cotton.  She has\r\nmore reason to fight the South for burning that cotton, than us for\r\nnot shipping it.  To aid the South on this ground would be\r\nhypocrisy which the world would detect at once.  Let her make her\r\nultimatum, and there are enough generous minds in Europe that will\r\ncounteract her in the balance.  Of course her motive is to cripple\r\na power that rivals her in commerce and manufactures, that\r\nthreatens even to usurp her history.  In twenty more years of\r\nprosperity, it will require a close calculation to determine\r\nwhether England, her laws and history, claim for a home the\r\nContinent of America or the Isle of Britain.  Therefore, finding us\r\nin a death-struggle for existence, she seems to seek a quarrel to\r\ndestroy both parts in detail.\r\n\r\nSouthern people know this full well, and will only accept the\r\nalliance of England in order to get arms and manufactures in\r\nexchange for their cotton.  The Southern Confederacy will accept no\r\nother mediation, because she knows full well that in Old England\r\nher slaves and slavery will receive no more encouragement than in\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nFrance certainly does not need our cotton enough to disturb her\r\nequilibrium, and her mediation would be entitled to a more respect\r\nconsideration than on the part of her present ally.  But I feel\r\nassured the French will not encourage rebellion and secession\r\nanywhere as a political doctrine.  Certainly all the German states\r\nmust be our ardent friends; and, in case of European intervention;\r\nthey could not be kept down.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION, ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Memphis, July\r\n23, 1862\r\n\r\nDr. E. S. PLUMMER and others, Physician  in Memphis, Signers to a\r\nPetition.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I have this moment received your communication, and\r\nassure you that it grieves my heart thus to be the instrument of\r\nadding to the seeming cruelty and hardship of this unnatural war.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival here, I found my predecessor (General Hovey) had\r\nissued an order permitting the departure south of all persons\r\nsubject to the conscript law of the Southern Confederacy.  Many\r\napplications have been made to me to modify this order, but I\r\nregarded it as a condition precedent by which I was bound in honor,\r\nand therefore I have made no changes or modifications; nor shall I\r\ndetermine what action I shall adopt in relation to persons\r\nunfriendly to our cause who remain after the time limited by\r\nGeneral Hovey's order had expired.  It is now sunset, and all who\r\nhave not availed themselves of General Hovey's authority, and who\r\nremain in Memphis, are supposed to be loyal and true men.\r\n\r\nI will only say that I cannot allow the personal convenience of\r\neven a large class of ladies to influence me in my determination to\r\nmake Memphis a safe place of operations for an army, and all people\r\nwho are unfriendly should forthwith prepare to depart in such\r\ndirection as I may hereafter indicate.\r\n\r\nSurgeons are not liable to be made prisoners of war, but they\r\nshould not reside within the lines of an army which they regard as\r\nhostile.  The situation would be too delicate.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, MEMPHIS, July 24, 1862\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SAWYER, Esq., Editor Union Appeal, Memphis.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: It is well I should come to an understanding at once\r\nwith the press as well as the people of Memphis, which I am ordered\r\nto command; which means, to control for the interest, welfare; and\r\nglory of the whole Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nPersonalities in a newspaper are wrong and criminal.  Thus, though\r\nyou meant to be complimentary in your sketch of my career, you make\r\nmore than a dozen mistakes of fact, which I need not correct, as I\r\ndon't desire my biography to be written till I am dead.  It is\r\nenough for the world to know that I live and am a soldier, bound to\r\nobey the orders of my superiors, the laws of my country, and to\r\nvenerate its Constitution; and that, when discretion is given me, I\r\nshall exercise it wisely and account to my superiors.\r\n\r\nI regard your article headed \"City Council--General Sherman and\r\nColonel Slack,\" as highly indiscreet.  Of course, no person who can\r\njeopardize the safety of Memphis can remain here, much less\r\nexercise public authority; but I must take time, and be satisfied\r\nthat injustice be not done.\r\n\r\nIf the parties named be the men you describe, the fact should not\r\nbe published, to put them on their guard and thus to encourage\r\ntheir escape.  The evidence should be carefully collected,\r\nauthenticated, and then placed in my hands.  But your statement of\r\nfacts is entirely qualified; in my mind, and loses its force by\r\nyour negligence of the very simple facts within your reach as to\r\nmyself: I had been in the army six years in 1846; am not related by\r\nblood to any member of Lucas, Turner & Co.; was associated with\r\nthem in business six years (instead of two); am not colonel of the\r\nFifteenth Infantry, but of the Thirteenth.  Your correction, this\r\nmorning, of the acknowledged error as to General Denver and others,\r\nis still erroneous.  General Morgan L. Smith did not belong to my\r\ncommand at the battle of Shiloh at all, but he was transferred to\r\nmy division just before reaching Corinth.  I mention these facts in\r\nkindness, to show you how wrong it is to speak of persons.\r\n\r\nI will attend to the judge, mayor, Boards of Aldermen, and\r\npolicemen, all in good time.\r\n\r\nUse your influence to reestablish system, order, government.  You\r\nmay rest easy that no military commander is going to neglect\r\ninternal safety, or to guard against external danger; but to do\r\nright requires time, and more patience than I usually possess.  If\r\nI find the press of Memphis actuated by high principle and a sole\r\ndevotion to their country, I will be their best friend; but, if I\r\nfind them personal, abusive, dealing in innuendoes and hints at a\r\nblind venture, and looking to their own selfish aggrandizement and\r\nfame, then they had better look out; for I regard such persons as\r\ngreater enemies to their country and to mankind than the men who,\r\nfrom a mistaken sense of State pride, have taken up muskets, and\r\nfight us about as hard as we care about.  In haste, but in\r\nkindness, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION,\r\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, July 27, 1882.\r\n\r\nJOHN PARK, Mayor of Memphis, present.\r\n\r\nSir: Yours of July 24th is before me, and has received, as all\r\nsimilar papers ever will, my careful and most respectful\r\nconsideration.  I have the most unbounded respect for the civil\r\nlaw, courts, and authorities, and shall do all in my power to\r\nrestore them to their proper use, viz., the protection of life,\r\nliberty, and property.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at this time, civil war prevails in the land, and\r\nnecessarily the military, for the time being, must be superior to\r\nthe civil authority, but it does not therefore destroy it.  Civil\r\ncourts and executive officers should still exist and perform\r\nduties, without which civil or municipal bodies would soon pass\r\ninto disrespect--an end to be avoided.  I am glad to find in\r\nMemphis a mayor and municipal authorities not only in existence,\r\nbut in the co-exercise of important functions, and I shall endeavor\r\nto restore one or more civil tribunals for the arbitration of\r\ncontracts and punishment of crimes, which the military have neither\r\ntime nor inclination to interfere with.  Among these, first in\r\nimportance is the maintenance of order, peace, and quiet, within\r\nthe jurisdiction of Memphis.  To insure this, I will keep a strong\r\nprovost guard in the city, but will limit their duty to guarding\r\npublic property held or claimed by the United States, and for the\r\narrest and confinement of State prisoners and soldiers who are\r\ndisorderly or improperly away from their regiments.  This guard\r\nought not to arrest citizens for disorder or minor crimes.  This\r\nshould be done by the city police.  I understand that the city\r\npolice is too weak in numbers to accomplish this perfectly, and I\r\ntherefore recommend that the City Council at once take steps to\r\nincrease this force to a number which, in their judgment, day and\r\nnight can enforce your ordinances as to peace, quiet, and order; so\r\nthat any change in our military dispositions will not have a\r\ntendency to leave your people unguarded.  I am willing to instruct\r\nthe provost guard to assist the police force when any combination\r\nis made too strong for them to overcome; but the city police should\r\nbe strong enough for any probable contingency.  The cost of\r\nmaintaining this police force must necessarily fall upon all\r\ncitizens equitably.  I am not willing, nor do I think it good\r\npolicy, for the city authorities to collect the taxes belonging to\r\nthe State and County, as you recommend; for these would have to be\r\nrefunded.  Better meet the expenses at once by a new tax on all\r\ninterested.  Therefore, if you, on consultation with the proper\r\nmunicipal body, will frame a good bill for the increase of your\r\npolice force, and for raising the necessary means for their support\r\nand maintenance, I will approve it and aid you in the collection of\r\nthe tax.  Of course, I cannot suggest how this tax should be laid,\r\nbut I think that it should be made uniform on all interests, real\r\nestate, and personal property, including money, and merchandise.\r\n\r\nAll who are protected should share the expenses in proportion to\r\nthe interests involved.  I am, with respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION,\r\nMEMPHIS, August 7, 1862.\r\n\r\nCaptain FITCH, Assistant Quartermaster, Memphis, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nSIR: The duties devolving on the quartermaster of this post, in\r\naddition to his legitimate functions, are very important and\r\nonerous, and I am fully aware that the task is more than should\r\ndevolve on one man.  I will endeavor to get you help in the person\r\nof some commissioned officer, and, if possible, one under bond, as\r\nhe must handle large amounts of money in trust; but, for the\r\npresent, we most execute the duties falling to our share as well as\r\npossible.  On the subject of vacant houses, General Grant's orders\r\nare: \"Take possession of all vacant stores and houses in the city,\r\nand have them rented at reasonable rates; rent to be paid monthly\r\nin advance.  These buildings, with their tenants, can be turned\r\nover to proprietors on proof of loyalty; also take charge of such\r\nas have been leased out by disloyal owners.\"\r\n\r\nI understand that General Grant takes the rents and profits of this\r\nclass of real property under the rules and laws of war, and not\r\nunder the confiscation act of Congress; therefore the question of\r\ntitle is not involved simply the possession, and the rents and\r\nprofits of houses belonging to our enemies, which are not vacant,\r\nwe hold in trust for them or the Government, according to the\r\nfuture decisions of the proper tribunals.\r\n\r\nMr. McDonald, your chief agent in renting and managing this\r\nbusiness, called on me last evening and left with me written\r\nquestions, which it would take a volume to answer and a Webster to\r\nelucidate; but as we can only attempt plain, substantial justice, I\r\nwill answer these questions as well as I can, briefly and to the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nFirst.  When ground is owned by parties who have gone south, and\r\nhave leased the ground to parties now in the city who own the\r\nimprovements on the ground?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  The United States takes the rents due the owner of the\r\nland; does not disturb the owner of the improvements.\r\n\r\nSecond.  When parties owning houses have gone south, and the tenant\r\nhas given his notes for the rent in advance?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  Notes are mere evidence of the debt due landlord.  The\r\ntenant pays the rent to the quartermaster, who gives a bond of\r\nindemnity against the notes representing the debt for the\r\nparticular rent.\r\n\r\nThird.  When the tenant has expended several months' rent in\r\nrepairs on the house?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  Of course, allow all such credits on reasonable proof and\r\nshowing.\r\n\r\nFourth.  When the owner has gone south, and parties here hold liens\r\non the property and are collecting the rents to satisfy their\r\nliens?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  The rent of a house can only be mortgaged to a person in\r\npossession.  If a loyal tenant be in possession and claim the rent\r\nfrom himself as due to himself on some other debt, allow it; but,\r\nif not in actual possession of the property, rents are not good\r\nliens for a debt, but must be paid to the quartermaster.\r\n\r\nFifth.  Of parties claiming foreign protection?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  Many claim foreign protection who are not entitled to it.\r\nIf they are foreign subjects residing for business in this,\r\ncountry, they are entitled to consideration and protection so\r\nlong as they obey the laws of the country.  If they occupy\r\nhouses belonging to absent rebels, they must pay rent to the\r\nquarter-master.  If they own property, they must occupy it by\r\nthemselves, tenants, or servants.\r\n\r\nEighth.  When houses are occupied and the owner has gone south,\r\nleaving an agent to collect rent for his benefit?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  Rent must be paid to the quartermaster.  No agent can\r\ncollect and remit money south without subjecting himself to arrest\r\nand trial for aiding and abetting the public enemy.\r\n\r\nNinth..  When houses are owned by loyal citizens, but are\r\nunoccupied?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  Such should not be disturbed, but it would be well to\r\nadvise them to have some servant at the house to occupy it.\r\n\r\nTenth.  When parties who occupy the house are creditors of the\r\nowner, who has gone south? Answer.  You only look to collection of\r\nrents.  Any person who transmits money south is liable to arrest\r\nand trial for aiding and abetting the enemy; but I do not think it\r\nour business to collect debts other than rents.\r\n\r\nEleventh.  When the parties who own the property have left the city\r\nunder General Hovey's Order No. 1, but are in the immediate\r\nneighborhood, on their plantations?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  It makes no difference where they are, so they are absent.\r\n\r\nTwelfth.  When movable property is found in stores that are closed?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  The goods are security for the rent.  If the owner of the\r\ngoods prefers to remove the goods to paying rent, he can do so.\r\n\r\nThirteenth.  When the owner lives in town, and refuses to take the\r\noath of allegiance?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  If the house be occupied, it does not fall under the\r\norder.  If the house be vacant, it does.  The owner can recover his\r\nproperty by taking the oath.\r\n\r\nAll persons in Memphis residing within our military lines are\r\npresumed to be loyal, good citizens, and may at any moment be\r\ncalled to serve on juries, posses comitatua, or other civil service\r\nrequired by the Constitution and laws of our country.  Should they\r\nbe called upon to do such duty, which would require them to\r\nacknowledge their allegiance and subordination to the Constitution\r\nof the United States, it would then be too late to refuse.  So long\r\nas they remain quiet and conform to these laws, they are entitled\r\nto protection in their property and lives.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to do with confiscation.  We only deal with\r\npossession, and therefore the necessity of a strict accountability,\r\nbecause the United States assumes the place of trustee, and must\r\naccount to the rightful owner for his property, rents, and profits.\r\nIn due season courts will be established to execute the laws, the\r\nconfiscation act included, when we will be relieved of this duty\r\nand trust.  Until that time, every opportunity should be given to\r\nthe wavering and disloyal to return to their allegiance to the\r\nConstitution of their birth or adoption.  I am, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nMajor-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION\r\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, August 26,1862\r\n\r\nMajor-General GRANT, Corinth, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nSir: In pursuance of your request that I should keep you advised of\r\nmatters of interest here, in addition to the purely official\r\nmatters, I now write.\r\n\r\nI dispatched promptly the thirteen companies of cavalry, nine of\r\nFourth Illinois, and four of Eleventh Illinois, to their respective\r\ndestinations, punctually on the 23d instant, although the order was\r\nonly received on the 22d.  I received at the same time, from\r\nColonel Dickey, the notice that the bridge over Hatchie was burned,\r\nand therefore I prescribed their order of march via Bolivar.  They\r\nstarted at 12 m.  of the 23d, and I have no news of them since.\r\nNone of the cavalry ordered to me is yet heard from.\r\n\r\nThe guerrillas have destroyed several bridges over Wolf Creek; one\r\nat Raleigh, on the road by which I had prescribed trade and travel\r\nto and from the city.  I have a strong guard at the lower bridge\r\nover Wolf River, by which we can reach the country to the north of\r\nthat stream; but, as the Confederates have burned their own\r\nbridges, I will hold them to my order, and allow no trade over any\r\nother road than the one prescribed, using the lower or Randolph\r\nroad for our own convenience.  I am still satisfied there is no\r\nlarge force of rebels anywhere in the neighborhood.  All the navy\r\ngunboats are below except the St. Louis, which lies off the city.\r\nWhen Commodore Davis passes down from Cairo, I will try to see him,\r\nand get him to exchange the St. Louis for a fleeter boat not\r\niron-clad; one that can move up and down the river, to break up\r\nferry-boats and canoes, and to prevent all passing across the\r\nriver.  Of course, in spite of all our efforts, smuggling is\r\ncarried on.  We occasionally make hauls of clothing, gold-lace,\r\nbuttons, etc., but I am satisfied that salt and arms are got to the\r\ninterior somehow.  I have addressed the Board of Trade a letter on\r\nthis point, which will enable us to control it better.\r\n\r\nYou may have been troubled at hearing reports of drunkenness here.\r\nThere was some after pay-day, but generally all is as quiet and\r\norderly as possible.  I traverse the city every day and night, and\r\nassert that Memphis is and has been as orderly a city as St. Louis,\r\nCincinnati, or New York.\r\n\r\nBefore the city authorities undertook to license saloons, there was\r\nas much whiskey here as now, and it would take all my command as\r\ncustomhouse inspectors, to break open all the parcels and packages\r\ncontaining liquor.  I can destroy all groggeries and shops where\r\nsoldiers get liquor just as we would in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers are accusing me of cruelty to the sick; as base a\r\ncharge as was ever made.  I would not let the Sanitary Committee\r\ncarry off a boat-load of sick, because I have no right to.  We have\r\ngood hospitals here, and plenty of them.  Our regimental hospitals\r\nare in the camps of the men, and the sick do much better there than\r\nin the general hospitals; so say my division surgeon and the\r\nregimental surgeons.  The civilian doctors would, if permitted,\r\ntake away our entire command.  General Curtis sends his sick up\r\nhere, but usually no nurses; and it is not right that nurses should\r\nbe taken from my command for his sick.  I think that, when we are\r\nendeavoring to raise soldiers and to instruct them, it is bad\r\npolicy to keep them at hospitals as attendants and nurses.\r\n\r\nI send you Dr. Derby's acknowledgment that he gave the leave of\r\nabsence of which he was charged.  I have placed him in arrest, in\r\nobedience to General Halleck's orders, but he remains in charge of\r\nthe Overton Hospital, which is not full of patients.\r\n\r\nThe State Hospital also is not full, and I cannot imagine what Dr.\r\nDerby wants with the Female Academy on Vance Street.  I will see\r\nhim again, and now that he is the chief at Overton Hospital, I\r\nthink he will not want the academy.  Still, if he does, under your\r\norders I will cause it to be vacated by the children and Sisters of\r\nMercy.  They have just advertised for more scholars, and will be\r\nsadly disappointed.  If, however, this building or any other be\r\nneeded for a hospital, it must be taken; but really, in my heart, I\r\ndo not see what possible chance there is, under present\r\ncircumstances, of filling with patients the two large hospitals now\r\nin use, besides the one asked for.  I may, however, be mistaken in\r\nthe particular building asked for by Dr. Derby, and will go myself\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nThe fort is progressing well, Captain Jenney having arrived.\r\nSixteen heavy guns are received, with a large amount of shot and\r\nshell, but the platforms are not yet ready; still, if occasion\r\nshould arise for dispatch, I can put a larger force to work.\r\nCaptain Prime, when here, advised that the work should proceed\r\nregularly under the proper engineer officers and laborers.\r\nI am, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION\r\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, September 4, 1862\r\n\r\nColonel J. C, KELTON, Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters of\r\nthe army, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDEAR COLONEL: Please acknowledge to the major-general commanding\r\nthe receipt by me of his letter, and convey to him my assurances\r\nthat I have promptly modified my first instructions about cotton,\r\nso as to conform to his orders.  Trade in cotton is now free, but\r\nin all else I endeavor so to control it that the enemy shall\r\nreceive no contraband goods, or any aid or comfort; still I feel\r\nsure that the officers of steamboats are sadly tempted by high\r\nprices to land salt and other prohibited articles at waypoints\r\nalong the river.  This, too, in time will be checked.  All seems\r\nwell here and hereabout; no large body of the enemy within striking\r\ndistance.  A force of about two thousand, cavalry passed through\r\nGrand Junction north last Friday, and fell on a detachment of the\r\nBolivar army at Middleburg, the result of which is doubtless\r\nreported to you.  As soon as I heard of the movement, I dispatched\r\na force to the southeast by way of diversion, and am satisfied that\r\nthe enemy's infantry and artillery fell back in consequence behind\r\nthe Tallahatchie.  The weather is very hot, country very dry, and\r\ndust as bad as possible.  I hold my two divisions ready, with their\r\noriginal complement of transportation, for field service.  Of\r\ncourse all things most now depend on events in front of Washington\r\nand in Kentucky.  The gunboat Eastport and four transports loaded\r\nwith prisoners of war destined for Vicksburg have been lying before\r\nMemphis for two days, but are now steaming up to resume their\r\nvoyage.  Our fort progresses well, but our guns are not yet\r\nmounted.  The engineers are now shaping the banquette to receive\r\nplatforms.  I expect Captain Prime from Corinth in two or three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, yours,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION\r\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, September 21, 1862\r\n\r\nEditor Bulletin.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your comments on the recent orders of Generals Halleck and\r\nMcClellan afford the occasion appropriate for me to make public the\r\nfact that there is a law of Congress, as old as our Government\r\nitself, but reenacted on the 10th of April, 1806, and in force ever\r\nsince.  That law reads:\r\n\r\n\"All officers and soldiers are to behave themselves orderly in\r\nquarters and on the march; and whoever shall commit any waste or\r\nspoil, either in walks of trees, parks, warrens, fish-ponds, houses\r\nand gardens, cornfields, inclosures or meadows, or shall\r\nmaliciously destroy any property whatever belonging to the\r\ninhabitants of the United States, unless by order of the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the armies of said United States, shall\r\n(besides such penalties as they are liable to by law) be punished\r\naccording to the nature and degree of the offense, by the judgment\r\nof a general or regimental court-martial.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the law of Congress; and the orders of the commander-\r\nin-chief are, that officers or soldiers convicted of straggling and\r\npillaging shall be punished with death.  These orders have not come\r\nto me officially, but I have seen them in newspapers, and am\r\nsatisfied that they express the determination of the commander-\r\nin-chief.  Straggling and pillaging have ever been great military\r\ncrimes; and every officer and soldier in my command knows what\r\nstress I have laid upon them, and that, so far as in my power lies,\r\nI will punish them to the full extent of the law and orders.\r\n\r\nThe law is one thing, the execution of the law another.  God\r\nhimself has commanded: \"Thou shalt not kill,\"  \"thou shalt not\r\nsteal,\"  \"thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods,\" etc.  Will\r\nany one say these things are not done now as well as before these\r\nlaws were announced at Sinai.  I admit the law to be that \"no officer\r\nor soldier of the United States shall commit waste or destruction\r\nof cornfields, orchards, potato-patches, or any kind of pillage on\r\nthe property of friend or foe near Memphis,\" and that I stand\r\nprepared to execute the law as far as possible.\r\n\r\nNo officer or soldier should enter the house or premises of any\r\npeaceable citizen, no matter what his politics, unless on business;\r\nand no such officer or soldier can force an entrance unless he have\r\na written order from a commanding officer or provost-marshal, which\r\nwritten authority must be exhibited if demanded.  When property\r\nsuch as forage, building or other materials are needed by the\r\nUnited States, a receipt will be given by the officer taking them,\r\nwhich receipt should be presented to the quartermaster, who will\r\nsubstitute therefor a regular voucher, to be paid-according to the\r\ncircumstances of the case.  If the officer refuse to give such\r\nreceipt, the citizen may fairly infer that the property is\r\nwrongfully taken, and he should, for his own protection, ascertain\r\nthe name, rank, and regiment of the officer, and report him in\r\nwriting.  If any soldier commits waste or destruction, the person\r\nwhose property is thus wasted must find out the name, company, and\r\nregiment of the actual transgressor.  In order to punish there must\r\nbe a trial, and there must be testimony.  It is not sufficient that\r\na general accusation be made, that soldiers are doing this or that.\r\nI cannot punish my whole command, or a whole battalion, because one\r\nor two bad soldiers do wrong.  The punishment must reach the\r\nperpetrators, and no one can identify them as well as the party who\r\nis interested.  The State of Tennessee does not hold itself\r\nresponsible for acts of larceny committed by her citizens, nor does\r\nthe United Staten or any other nation.  These are individual acts\r\nof wrong, and punishment can only be inflicted on the wrong-doer.\r\nI know the difficulty of identifying particular soldiers, but\r\ndifficulties do not alter the importance of principles of justice.\r\nThey should stimulate the parties to increase their efforts to find\r\nout the actual perpetrators of the crime.\r\n\r\nColonels of regiments and commanders of corps are liable to severe\r\npunishment for permitting their men to leave their camps to commit\r\nwaste or destruction; but I know full well that many of the acts\r\nattributed to soldiers are committed by citizens and negroes, and\r\nare charged to soldiers because of a desire to find fault with\r\nthem; but this only reacts upon the community and increases the\r\nmischief.  While every officer would willingly follow up an\r\naccusation against any one or more of his men whose names or\r\ndescription were given immediately after the discovery of the act,\r\nhe would naturally resent any general charge against his good men,\r\nfor the criminal conduct of a few bad ones.\r\n\r\nI have examined into many of the cases of complaint made in this\r\ngeneral way, and have felt mortified that our soldiers should do\r\nacts which are nothing more or less than stealing, but I was\r\npowerless without some clew whereby to reach the rightful party.  I\r\nknow that the great mass of our soldiers would scorn to steal or\r\ncommit crime, and I will not therefore entertain vague and general\r\ncomplaints, but stand, prepared always to follow up any reasonable\r\ncomplaint when the charge is definite and the names of witnesses\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nI know, moreover, in some instances when our soldiers are\r\ncomplained of, that they have been insulted by sneering remarks\r\nabout \"Yankees,\"  \"Northern barbarians,\"  \"Lincoln's hirelings,\"\r\netc.  People who use such language must seek redress through some\r\none else, for I will not tolerate insults to our country or cause.\r\nWhen people forget their obligations to a Government that made them\r\nrespected among the nations of the earth, and speak contemptuously\r\nof the flag which is the silent emblem of that country, I will not\r\ngo out of my way to protect them or their property.  I will punish\r\nthe soldiers for trespass or waste if adjudged by a court-martial,\r\nbecause they disobey orders; but soldiers are men and citizens as\r\nwell as soldiers, and should promptly resent any insult to their\r\ncountry, come from what quarter it may.  I mention this phase\r\nbecause it is too common.  Insult to a soldier does not justify\r\npillage, but it takes from the officer the disposition he would\r\notherwise feel to follow up the inquiry and punish the wrong-doers.\r\n\r\nAgain, armies in motion or stationary must commit some waste.\r\nFlankers must let down fences and cross fields; and, when an attack\r\nis contemplated or apprehended, a command will naturally clear the\r\nground of houses, fences, and trees.  This is waste, but is the\r\nnatural consequence of war, chargeable on those who caused the war.\r\nSo in fortifying a place, dwelling-houses must be taken, materials\r\nused, even wasted, and great damage done, which in the end may\r\nprove useless.  This, too, is an expense not chargeable to us, but\r\nto those who made the war; and generally war is destruction and\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nWe must bear this in mind, that however peaceful things look, we\r\nare really at war; and much that looks like waste or destruction is\r\nonly the removal of objects that obstruct our fire, or would afford\r\ncover to an enemy.\r\n\r\nThis class of waste must be distinguished from the wanton waste\r\ncommitted by army-stragglers, which is wrong, and can be punished\r\nby the death-penalty if proper testimony can be produced.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSatisfied that, in the progress of the war, Memphis would become an\r\nimportant depot, I pushed forward the construction of Fort\r\nPickering, kept most of the troops in camps back of the city, and\r\nmy own headquarters remained in tents on the edge of the city, near\r\nMr. Moon's house, until, on the approach of winter, Mrs. Sherman\r\ncame down with the children to visit me, when I took a house nearer\r\nthe fort.\r\n\r\nAll this time battalion and brigade drills were enforced, so that,\r\nwhen the season approached for active operations farther south, I\r\nhad my division in the best possible order, and about the 1st of\r\nNovember it was composed as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst Brigade, Brigadier-General M. L. SMITH--Eighth Missouri,\r\nColonel G. A. Smith; Sixth Missouri, Colonel Peter E. Bland; One\r\nHundred and Thirteenth Illinois, Colonel George B. Hoge;\r\nFifty-fourth Ohio, Colonel T. Kilby Smith; One Hundred and\r\nTwentieth Illinois, Colonel G. W. McKeaig.\r\n\r\nSecond Brigade, Colonel JOHN ADAIR McDOWELL.--Sixth Iowa,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel John M. Corse; Fortieth Illinois, Colonel J. W.\r\nBooth; Forty-sixth Ohio, Colonel O. C. Walcutt; Thirteenth United\r\nStates Infantry, First Battalion, Major D. Chase.\r\n\r\nThird Brigade, Brigadier-General J. W. DENVER.--Forty-eighth Ohio,\r\nColonel P. J. Sullivan; Fifty-third Ohio, Colonel W. S. Jones;\r\nSeventieth Ohio, Colonel J. R. Cockerill.\r\n\r\nFourth Brigade, Colonel DAVID STUART.--Fifty-fifth Illinois,\r\nColonel O. Malmburg; Fifty-seventh Ohio, Colonel W. Mungen;\r\nEighty-third Indiana, Colonel B. Spooner; One Hundred and Sixteenth\r\nIllinois, Colonel Tupper; One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Illinois,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Eldridge.\r\n\r\nFifth Brigade, Colonel R. P. BUCKLAND.--Seventy-second Ohio,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel D. W. C. Loudon; Thirty-second Wisconsin,\r\nColonel J. W. Howe; Ninety-third Indiana, Colonel Thomas;\r\nNinety-third Illinois, Major J. M. Fisher.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Brigadier-General J. G. Lauman arrived at Memphis,\r\nand I made up a sixth brigade, and organized these six brigades\r\ninto three divisions, under Brigadier-Generals M. L. Smith, J. W.\r\nDenver, and J. G. Lauman.\r\n\r\nAbout the 17th of November I received an order from General Grant,\r\ndated:\r\n\r\nLAGRANGE, November 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nMeet me at Columbus, Kentucky, on Thursday next.  If you have a\r\ngood map of the country south of you, take it up with you.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started forthwith by boat, and met General Grant, who had reached\r\nColumbus by the railroad from Jackson, Tennessee.  He explained to\r\nme that he proposed to move against Pemberton, then intrenched on a\r\nline behind the Tallahatchie River below Holly Springs; that he\r\nwould move on Holly Springs and Abberville, from Grand Junction;\r\nthat McPherson, with the troops at Corinth, would aim to make\r\njunction with him at Holly Springs; and that he wanted me to leave\r\nin Memphis a proper garrison, and to aim for the Tallahatchie, so\r\nas to come up on his right by a certain date.  He further said that\r\nhis ultimate object was to capture Vicksburg, to open the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi River, and that General Halleck had\r\nauthorized him to call on the troops in the Department of Arkansas,\r\nthen commanded by General S. R. Curtis, for cooperation.  I\r\nsuggested to him that if he would request General Curtis to send an\r\nexpedition from some point on the Mississippi, near Helena, then\r\nheld in force, toward Grenada, to the rear of Pemberton, it would\r\nalarm him for the safety of his communications, and would assist us\r\nmaterially in the proposed attack on his front.  He authorized me\r\nto send to the commanding officer at Helena a request to that\r\neffect, and, as soon as I reached Memphis, I dispatched my aide,\r\nMajor McCoy, to Helena, who returned, bringing me a letter from\r\nGeneral Frederick Steele, who had just reached Helena with\r\nOsterhaus's division, and who was temporarily in command, General\r\nCurtis having gone to St. Louis.  This letter contained the\r\nassurance that he \"would send from Friar's Point a large force\r\nunder Brigadier-General A. P. Hovey in the direction of Grenada,\r\naiming to reach the Tallahatchie at Charleston, on the next Monday,\r\nTuesday, or Wednesday (December 1st) at furthest.\"  My command was\r\nappointed to start on Wednesday, November 24th, and meantime\r\nMajor-General S. A. Hurlbut, having reported for duty, was assigned\r\nto the command of Memphis, with four regiments of infantry one\r\nbattery of artillery, two companies of Thielman's cavalry and the\r\ncertain prospect of soon receiving a number of new regiments, known\r\nto be en route.\r\n\r\nI marched out of Memphis punctually with three small divisions,\r\ntaking different roads till we approached the Tallahatchie, when we\r\nconverged on Wyatt to cross the river, there a bold, deep stream,\r\nwith a newly-constructed fort behind.  I had Grierson's Sixth\r\nIllinois Cavalry with me, and with it opened communication with\r\nGeneral Grant when we were abreast of Holly Springs.  We reached\r\nWyatt on the 2d day of December without the least opposition, and\r\nthere learned that Pemberton's whole army had fallen back to the\r\nYalabusha near Grenada, in a great measure by reason of the\r\nexaggerated reports concerning the Helena force, which had reached\r\nCharleston; and some of General Hovey's cavalry, under General\r\nWashburn, having struck the railroad in the neighborhood of\r\nCoffeeville, naturally alarmed General Pemberton for the safety of\r\nhis communications, and made him let go his Tallahatchie line with\r\nall the forts which he had built at great cost in labor.  We had to\r\nbuild a bridge at Wyatt, which consumed a couple of days, and on\r\nthe 5th of December my whole command was at College Hill, ten miles\r\nfrom Oxford, whence I reported to General Grant in Oxford.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th I received the following letter:\r\n\r\nOXFORD MISSISSIPPI, December 8, 1862--Morning\r\n\r\nGeneral SHERMAN, College Hill.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: The following is a copy of dispatch just received\r\nfrom Washington:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 7, 1862--12M\r\n\r\nGeneral GRANT:\r\n\r\nThe capture of Grenada may change our plans in regard to Vicksburg.\r\nYou will move your troops as you may deem best to accomplish the\r\ngreat object in view.  You will retain, till further orders, all\r\ntroops of General Curtis now in your department.  Telegraph to\r\nGeneral Allen in St. Louis for all steamboats you may require.  Ask\r\nPorter to cooperate.  Telegraph what are your present plans.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in.-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish you would come over this evening and stay to-night, or come\r\nin the morning.  I would like to talk with you about this matter.\r\nMy notion is to send two divisions back to Memphis, and fix upon a\r\nday when they should effect a landing, and press from here with\r\nthis command at the proper time to cooperate.  If I do not do this\r\nI will move our present force to Grenada, including Steele's,\r\nrepairing road as we proceed, and establish a depot of provisions\r\nthere.  When a good ready is had, to move immediately on Jackson,\r\nMississippi, cutting loose from the road.  Of the two plans I look\r\nmost favorably on the former.\r\n\r\nCome over and we will talk this matter over.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI repaired at once to Oxford, and found General Grant in a large\r\nhouse with all his staff, and we discussed every possible chance.\r\nHe explained to me that large reenforcements had been promised,\r\nwhich would reach Memphis very soon, if not already there; that the\r\nentire gunboat fleet, then under the command of Admiral D. D.\r\nPorter, would cooperate; that we could count on a full division\r\nfrom the troops at Helena; and he believed that, by a prompt\r\nmovement, I could make a lodgment up the Yazoo and capture\r\nVicksburg from the rear; that its garrison was small, and he, at\r\nOxford, would so handle his troops as to hold Pemberton away from\r\nVicksburg.  I also understood that, if Pemberton should retreat\r\nsouth, he would follow him up, and would expect to find me at the\r\nYazoo River, if not inside of Vicksburg.  I confess, at that moment\r\nI did not dream that General McClernand, or anybody else, was\r\nscheming for the mere honor of capturing Vicksburg.  We knew at the\r\ntime that General Butler had been reenforced by General Banks at\r\nNew Orleans, and the latter was supposed to be working his way\r\nup-stream from New Orleans, while we were working down.  That day\r\nGeneral Grant dispatched to General Halleck, in Washington, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOXFORD, December 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nMajor-General H. W. HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman will command the expedition down the Mississippi.\r\nHe will have a force of about forty thousand men; will land above\r\nVicksburg (up the Yazoo, if practicable), and out the Mississippi\r\nCentral road and the road running east from Vicksburg, where they\r\ncross Black River.  I will cooperate from here, my movements\r\ndepending on those of the enemy.  With the large cavalry force now\r\nat my command, I will be able to have them show themselves at\r\ndifferent points on the Tallahatchie and Yalabusha; and, when an\r\nopportunity occurs, make a real attack.  After cutting the two\r\nroads, General Sherman's movements to secure the end desired will\r\nnecessarily be left to his judgment.\r\n\r\nI will occupy this road to Coffeeville.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was shown this dispatch before it was sent, and afterward the\r\ngeneral drew up for me the following letter of instructions in his\r\nown handwriting, which I now possess:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,\r\nOXFORD, Mississippi, December 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Right Wing Army In the\r\nField, present.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: You will proceed with as little delay as practicable to\r\nMemphis, Tennessee, taking with you one division of your present\r\ncommand.  On your arrival at Memphis you will assume command of all\r\nthe troops there, and that portion of General Curtis's forces at\r\npresent east of the Mississippi River, and organize them into\r\nbrigades and divisions in your own way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible move with them down the river to the vicinity\r\nof Vicksburg, and, with the cooperation of the gunboat fleet under\r\ncommand of Flag-Officer Porter, proceed to the reduction of that\r\nplace in such manner as circumstances and your own judgment may\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rations, forage, land transportation, etc., necessary\r\nto take, will be left entirely to yourself.\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster in St. Louis will be instructed to send you\r\ntransportation for thirty thousand men.  Should you still find\r\nyourself deficient, your quartermaster will be authorized to make\r\nup the deficiency from such transports as may come into the port of\r\nMemphis.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Memphis put yourself in communication with Admiral\r\nPorter, and arrange with him for his cooperation.\r\n\r\nInform me at the earliest practicable day of the time when you will\r\nembark, and such plans as may then be matured.  I will hold the\r\nforces here in readiness to cooperate with you in such manner as\r\nthe movements of the enemy may make necessary.\r\n\r\nLeave the District of Memphis in the command of an efficient\r\nofficer and with a garrison of four regiments of infantry, the\r\nsiege-guns, and what  ever cavalry force may be there.\r\n\r\nOne regiment of infantry and at least a section of artillery will\r\nalso be left at Friar's Point or Delta, to protect the stores of\r\nthe cavalry post that will be left there.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also insert here another letter, dated the 14th instant, sent\r\nafterward to me at Memphis, which completes all instructions\r\nreceived by me governing the first movement against Vicksburg:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nOXFORD, MISSISSIPPI, December 14, 1862\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN, commanding, etc.,\r\nMemphis, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nI have not had one word from Grierson since he left, and am getting\r\nuneasy about him.  I hope General Gorman will give you no\r\ndifficulty about retaining the troops on this side the river, and\r\nSteele to command them.  The twenty-one thousand men you have, with\r\nthe twelve thousand from Helena, will make a good force.  The enemy\r\nare as yet on the Yalabusha.  I am pushing down on them slowly, but\r\nso as to keep up the impression of a continuous move.  I feel\r\nparticularly anxious to have the Helena cavalry on this side of the\r\nriver; if not now, at least after you start.  If Gorman will send\r\nthem, instruct them where to go and how to communicate with me.  My\r\nheadquarters will probably be in Coffeeville one week hence....  In\r\nthe mean time I will order transportation, etc.... It would be well\r\nif you could have two or three small boats suitable for navigating\r\nthe Yazoo.  It may become necessary for me to look to that base for\r\nsupplies before we get through....\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we rode to Oxford from College Hill, there happened a little\r\ncircumstance which seems worthy of record.  While General Van Dorn\r\nhad his headquarters in Holly Springs, viz., in October, 1862, he\r\nwas very short of the comforts and luxuries of life, and resorted\r\nto every possible device to draw from the abundant supplies in\r\nMemphis.  He had no difficulty whatever in getting spies into the\r\ntown for information, but he had trouble in getting bulky supplies\r\nout through our guards, though sometimes I connived at his supplies\r\nof cigars, liquors, boots, gloves, etc., for his individual use;\r\nbut medicines and large supplies of all kinds were confiscated, if\r\nattempted to be passed out.  As we rode that morning toward Oxford,\r\nI observed in a farmer's barn-yard a wagon that looked like a city\r\nfurniture-wagon with springs.  We were always short of wagons, so I\r\ncalled the attention of the quartermaster, Colonel J. Condit Smith,\r\nsaying, \"There is a good wagon; go for it.\"  He dropped out of the\r\nretinue with an orderly, and after we had ridden a mile or so he\r\novertook us, and I asked him, \"What luck?\"  He answered, \"All\r\nright; I have secured that wagon, and I also got another,\" and\r\nexplained that he had gone to the farmer's house to inquire about\r\nthe furniture-wagon, when the farmer said it did not belong to him,\r\nbut to some party in Memphis, adding that in his barn was another\r\nbelonging to the same party.  They went to the barn, and there\r\nfound a handsome city hearse, with pall and plumes.  The farmer\r\nsaid they had had a big funeral out of Memphis, but when it reached\r\nhis house, the coffin was found to contain a fine assortment of\r\nmedicines for the use of Van Dorn's army.  Thus under the pretense\r\nof a first-class funeral, they had carried through our guards the\r\nvery things we had tried to prevent.  It was a good trick, but\r\ndiminished our respect for such pageants afterward.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was in possession of General Grant's instructions of\r\nDecember 8th, with a further request that I should dispatch Colonel\r\nGrierson, with his cavalry, across by land to Helena, to notify\r\nGeneral Steele of the general plan, I returned to College Hill,\r\nselected the division of Brigadier-General Morgan L. Smith to\r\nreturn with me to Memphis; started Grierson on his errand to\r\nHelena, and ordered Generals Denver and Lauman to report to General\r\nGrant for further orders.  We started back by the most direct\r\nroute, reached Memphis by noon of December 12th, and began\r\nimmediately the preparations for the Vicksburg movement.  There I\r\nfound two irregular divisions which had arrived at Memphis in my\r\nabsence, commanded respectively by Brigadier-General A. J. Smith\r\nand Brigadier-General George W. Morgan.  These were designated the\r\nFirst and Third Divisions, leaving the Second Division of Morgan Z.\r\nSmith to retain its original name and number.\r\n\r\nI also sent orders, in the name of General Grant, to General\r\nGorman, who meantime had replaced General Steele in command of\r\nHelena, in lieu of the troops which had been east of the\r\nMississippi and had returned, to make up a strong division to\r\nreport to me on my way down.  This division was accordingly\r\norganized, and was commanded by Brigadier-General Frederick Steele,\r\nconstituting my Fourth Division.\r\n\r\nMeantime a large fleet of steamboats was assembling from St. Louis\r\nand Cairo, and Admiral Porter dropped down to Memphis with his\r\nwhole gunboat fleet, ready to cooperate in the movement.  The\r\npreparations were necessarily hasty in the extreme, but this was\r\nthe essence of the whole plan, viz., to reach Vicksburg as it were\r\nby surprise, while General Grant held in check Pemberton's army\r\nabout Grenada, leaving me to contend only with the smaller garrison\r\nof Vicksburg and its well-known strong batteries and defenses.  On\r\nthe 19th the Memphis troops were embarked, and steamed down to\r\nHelena, where on the 21st General Steele's division was also\r\nembarked; and on the 22d we were all rendezvoused at Friar's Point,\r\nin the following order, viz.:\r\n\r\nSteamer Forest Queen, general headquarters, and battalion\r\nThirteenth United States Infantry.\r\n\r\nFirst Division, Brigadier-General A. J. SMITH.--Steamers Des Arc,\r\ndivision headquarters and escort; Metropolitan, Sixth Indiana; J.\r\nH. Dickey, Twenty-third Wisconsin; J. C.

Campbell, Ninety-seventh\r\nIndiana; Duke of Argyle, Seventy-seventh Illinois; City of Alton,\r\nOne Hundred and Eighth and Forty-eighth Ohio; City of Louisiana,\r\nMercantile Battery; Ohio Belle, Seventeenth Ohio Battery; Citizen,\r\nEighty-third Ohio; Champion, commissary-boat; General Anderson,\r\nOrdnance.\r\n\r\nSecond Division,, Brigadier-General M. L. SMITH.--Steamers\r\nChancellor, headquarters, and Thielman's cavalry; Planet, One\r\nHundred and Sixteenth Illinois; City of Memphis, Batteries A and B\r\n(Missouri Artillery), Eighth Missouri, and section of Parrott guns;\r\nOmaha, Fifty-seventh Ohio; Sioux City, Eighty-third Indiana; Spread\r\nEagle, One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Illinois; Ed.  Walsh, One\r\nHundred and Thirteenth Illinois; Westmoreland, Fifty-fifth\r\nIllinois, headquarters Fourth Brigade; Sunny South, Fifty-fourth\r\nOhio; Universe, Sixth Missouri; Robert Allen, commissary-boat.\r\n\r\nThird Division, Brigadier-General G. W. MORGAN.--Steamers Empress,\r\ndivision headquarters; Key West, One Hundred and Eighteenth\r\nIllinois; Sam Gaty, Sixty-ninth Indiana; Northerner, One Hundred\r\nand Twentieth Ohio; Belle Peoria, headquarters Second Brigade, two\r\ncompanies Forty-ninth Ohio, and pontoons; Die Vernon, Third\r\nKentucky; War Eagle, Forty-ninth Indiana (eight companies), and\r\nFoster's battery; Henry von Phul, headquarters Third Brigade, and\r\neight companies Sixteenth Ohio; Fanny Bullitt, One Hundred and\r\nFourteenth Ohio, and Lamphere's battery; Crescent City,\r\nTwenty-second Kentucky and Fifty-fourth Indiana; Des Moines,\r\nForty-second Ohio; Pembina, Lamphere's and Stone's batteries; Lady\r\nJackson, commissary-boat.\r\n\r\nFourth Division, Brigadier-General FREDERICK STEELE--Steamers\r\nContinental, headquarters, escort and battery; John J. Roe, Fourth\r\nand Ninth Iowa; Nebraska, Thirty-first Iowa; Key West, First Iowa\r\nArtillery; John Warner, Thirteenth Illinois; Tecumseh, Twenty-sixth\r\nIowa; Decatur, Twenty-eighth Iowa; Quitman, Thirty-fourth Iowa;\r\nKennett, Twenty ninth Missouri; Gladiator, Thirtieth Missouri;\r\nIsabella, Thirty-first Missouri; D. G. Taylor, quartermaster's\r\nstores and horses; Sucker State, Thirty-second Missouri; Dakota,\r\nThird Missouri; Tutt, Twelfth Missouri Emma, Seventeenth Missouri;\r\nAdriatic, First Missouri; Meteor, Seventy-sixth Ohio; Polar Star,\r\nFifty-eighth Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time were communicated the following instructions:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS RIGHT WING, THIRTEENTH ARMY Corps\r\nFOREST QUEEN, December 23, 1882.\r\n\r\nTo Commanders of Divisions, Generals F. STEELE, GEORGE W. MORGAN,\r\nA.J. SMITH, and M. L. SMITH\r\n\r\nWith this I hand to each of you a copy of a map, compiled from the\r\nbest sources, and which in the main is correct.  It is the same\r\nused by Admiral Porter and myself.  Complete military success can\r\nonly be accomplished by united action on some general plan,\r\nembracing usually a large district of country.  In the present\r\ninstance, our object is to secure the navigation of the Mississippi\r\nRiver and its main branches, and to hold them as military channels\r\nof communication and for commercial purposes.  The river, above\r\nVicksburg, has been gained by conquering the country to its rear,\r\nrendering its possession by our enemy useless and unsafe to him,\r\nand of great value to us.  But the enemy still holds the river from\r\nVicksburg to Baton Rouge, navigating it with his boats, and the\r\npossession of it enables him to connect his communications and\r\nroutes of supply, east and west.  To deprive him of this will be a\r\nsevere blow, and, if done effectually, will be of great advantage\r\nto us, and probably, the most decisive act of the war.  To\r\naccomplish this important result we are to act our part--an\r\nimportant one of the great whole.  General Banks, with a large\r\nforce, has reinforced General Butler in Louisiana, and from that\r\nquarter an expedition, by water and land, is coming northward.\r\nGeneral Grant, with the Thirteenth Army Corps, of which we compose\r\nthe right wing, is moving southward.  The naval squadron (Admiral\r\nPorter) is operating with his gunboat fleet by water, each in\r\nperfect harmony with the other.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's left and centre were at last accounts approaching\r\nthe Yalabusha, near Grenada, and the railroad to his rear, by which\r\nhe drew his supplies, was reported to be seriously damaged.  This\r\nmay disconcert him somewhat, but only makes more important our line\r\nof operations.  At the Yalabusha General Grant may encounter the\r\narmy of General Pemberton, the same which refused him battle on the\r\nline of the Tallahatchie, which was strongly fortified; but, as he\r\nwill not have time to fortify it, he will hardly stand there; and,\r\nin that event, General Grant will immediately advance down the high\r\nridge between the Big Black and Yazoo, and will expect to meet us\r\non the Yazoo and receive from us the supplies which he needs, and\r\nwhich he knows we carry along.  Parts of this general plan are to\r\ncooperate with the naval squadron in the reduction of Vicksburg; to\r\nsecure possession of the land lying between the Yazoo and Big\r\nBlack; and to act in concert with General Grant against Pemberton's\r\nforces, supposed to have Jackson, Mississippi, as a point of\r\nconcentration.  Vicksburg is doubtless very strongly fortified,\r\nboth against the river and land approaches.  Already the gunboats\r\nhave secured the Yazoo up for twenty-three miles, to a fort on the\r\nYazoo at Haines's Bluff, giving us a choice for a landing-place at\r\nsome point up the Yazoo below this fort, or on the island which\r\nlies between Vicksburg and the present mouth of the Yazoo.  (See\r\nmap [b, c, d], Johnson's plantation.)\r\n\r\n     But, before any actual collision with the enemy, I purpose,\r\nafter our whole land force is rendezvoused at Gaines's Landing,\r\nArkansas, to proceed in order to Milliken's Bend (a), and there\r\ndispatch a brigade, without wagons or any incumbrances whatever, to\r\nthe Vicksburg & Shreveport Railroad (at h and k), to destroy that\r\neffectually, and to cut off that fruitful avenue of supply; then to\r\nproceed to the mouth of the Yazoo, and, after possessing ourselves\r\nof the latest and most authentic information from naval officers\r\nnow there, to land our whole force on the Mississippi side, and\r\nthen to reach the point where the Vicksburg & Jackson Railroad\r\ncrosses the Big Black (f); after which to attack Vicksburg by land,\r\nwhile the gun-boats assail it by water.  It may be necessary\r\n(looking to Grant's approach), before attacking Vicksburg, to\r\nreduce the battery at Haine's Bluff first, so as to enable some of\r\nthe lighter gunboats and transports to ascend the Yazoo and\r\ncommunicate with General Grant.  The detailed manner of\r\naccomplishing all these results will be communicated in due season,\r\nand these general points are only made known at this time, that\r\ncommanders may study the maps, and also that in the event of\r\nnon-receipt of orders all may act in perfect concert by following\r\nthe general movement, unless specially detached.\r\n\r\nYou all now have the same map, so that no mistakes or confusion\r\nneed result from different names of localities.  All possible\r\npreparations as to wagons, provisions, axes, and intrenching-tools,\r\nshould be made in advance, so that when we do land there will be no\r\nwant of them.  When we begin to act on shore, we must do the work\r\nquickly and effectually.  The gunboats under Admiral Porter will do\r\ntheir full share, and I feel every assurance that the army will not\r\nfall short in its work.\r\n\r\nDivision commanders may read this to regimental commanders, and\r\nfurnish brigade commanders a copy.  They should also cause as many\r\ncopies of the map to be made on the same scale as possible, being\r\nvery careful in copying the names.\r\n\r\nThe points marked e and g (Allan's and Mount Albans) are evidently\r\nstrategical points that will figure in our future operations, and\r\nthese positions should be well studied.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi boats were admirably calculated for handling\r\ntroops, horses, guns, stores, etc., easy of embarkation and\r\ndisembarkation, and supplies of all kinds were abundant, except\r\nfuel.  For this we had to rely on wood, but most of the wood-yards,\r\nso common on the river before the war, had been exhausted, so that\r\nwe had to use fence-rails, old dead timber, the logs of houses,\r\netc.  Having abundance of men and plenty of axes, each boat could\r\ndaily procure a supply.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding down the river, one or more of Admiral Porter's\r\ngunboats took the lead; others were distributed throughout the\r\ncolumn, and some brought up the rear.  We manoeuvred by divisions\r\nand brigades when in motion, and it was a magnificent sight as we\r\nthus steamed down the river.  What few inhabitants remained at the\r\nplantations on the river-bank were unfriendly, except the slaves;\r\nsome few guerrilla-parties infested the banks, but did not dare to\r\nmolest so, strong a force as I then commanded.\r\n\r\nWe reached Milliken's Bend on Christmas-day, when I detached one\r\nbrigade (Burbridge's), of A. J. Smith's division, to the southwest,\r\nto break up the railroad leading from Vicksburg toward Shreveport,\r\nLouisiana.  Leaving A. J. Smith's division there to await the\r\nreturn of Burbridge, the remaining three divisions proceeded, on\r\nthe 26th, to the mouth of the Yazoo, and up that river to\r\nJohnson's plantation, thirteen miles, and there disembarked\r\nSteele's division above the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou, Morgans\r\ndivision near the house of Johnson (which had been burned by the\r\ngunboats on a former occasion), and M. L. Smith's just below.  A.\r\nJ. Smith's division arrived the next night, and disembarked below\r\nthat of M. L. Smith.  The place of our disembarkation was in fact\r\nan island, separated from the high bluff known as Walnut Hills, on\r\nwhich the town of Vicksburg stands, by a broad and shallow\r\nbayou-evidently an old channel of the Yazoo.  On our right was\r\nanother wide bayou, known as Old River; and on the left still\r\nanother, much narrower, but too deep to be forded, known as\r\nChickasaw Bayou.  All the island was densely wooded, except\r\nJohnson's plantation, immediately on the bank of the Yazoo, and a\r\nseries of old cotton-fields along Chickasaw Bayou.  There was a\r\nroad from Johnson's plantation directly to Vicksburg, but it\r\ncrossed numerous bayous and deep swamps by bridges, which had been\r\ndestroyed; and this road debouched on level ground at the foot of\r\nthe Vicksburg bluff, opposite strong forts, well prepared and\r\ndefended by heavy artillery.  On this road I directed General A. J.\r\nSmith's division, not so much by way of a direct attack as a\r\ndiversion and threat.\r\n\r\nMorgan was to move to his left, to reach Chickasaw Bayou, and to\r\nfollow it toward the bluff, about four miles above A. J. Smith.\r\nSteele was on Morgan's left, across Chickasaw Bayou, and M. L.\r\nSmith on Morgan's right.  We met light resistance at all points,\r\nbut skirmished, on the 27th, up to the main bayou, that separated\r\nour position from the bluffs of Vicksburg, which were found to be\r\nstrong by nature and by art, and seemingly well defended.  On\r\nreconnoitring the front in person, during the 27th and 28th, I\r\nbecame satisfied that General A. J. Smith could not cross the\r\nintervening obstacles under the heavy fire of the forts immediately\r\nin his front, and that the main bayou was impassable, except at two\r\npoints--one near the head of Chickasaw Bayou, in front of Morgan,\r\nand the other about a mile lower down, in front of M. L. Smith's\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nDuring the general reconnoissance of the 28th General Morgan L.\r\nSmith received a severe and dangerous wound in his hip, which\r\ncompletely disabled him and compelled him to go to his steamboat,\r\nleaving the command of his division to Brigadier General D.\r\nStuart; but I drew a part of General A. J. Smith's division, and\r\nthat general himself, to the point selected for passing the bayou,\r\nand committed that special task to his management.\r\n\r\nGeneral Steele reported that it was physically impossible to reach\r\nthe bluffs from his position, so I ordered him to leave but a show\r\nof force there, and to return to the west side of Chickasaw Bayou\r\nin support of General Morgan's left.  He had to countermarch and\r\nuse the steamboats in the Yazoo to get on the firm ground on our\r\nside of the Chickasaw.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 29th all the troops were ready and in\r\nposition.  The first step was to make a lodgment on the foot-hills\r\nand bluffs abreast of our position, while diversions were made by\r\nthe navy toward Haines's Bluff, and by the first division directly\r\ntoward Vicksburg.  I estimated the enemy's forces, then strung from\r\nVicksburg to Haines's Bluff, at fifteen thousand men, commanded by\r\nthe rebel Generals Martin Luther Smith and Stephen D. Lee.  Aiming\r\nto reach firm ground beyond this bayou, and to leave as little time\r\nfor our enemy to reenforce as possible, I determined to make a show\r\nof attack along the whole front, but to break across the bayou at\r\nthe two points named, and gave general orders accordingly.  I\r\npointed out to General Morgan the place where he could pass the\r\nbayou, and he answered, \"General, in ten minutes after you give the\r\nsignal I'll be on those hills.\"  He was to lead his division in\r\nperson, and was to be supported by Steele's division.  The front\r\nwas very narrow, and immediately opposite, at the base of the hills\r\nabout three hundred yards from the bayou, was a rebel battery,\r\nsupported by an infantry force posted on the spurs of the hill\r\nbehind.  To draw attention from this, the real point of attack, I\r\ngave instructions to commence the attack at the flanks.\r\n\r\nI went in person about a mile to the right rear of Morgan's\r\nposition, at a place convenient to receive reports from all other\r\nparts of the line; and about noon of December 29th gave the orders\r\nand signal for the main attack.  A heavy artillery-fire opened\r\nalong our whole line, and was replied to by the rebel batteries,\r\nand soon the infantry-fire opened heavily, especially on A. J.\r\nSmith's front, and in front of General George W. Morgan.  One\r\nbrigade (DeCourcey's) of Morgan's troops crossed the bayou safely,\r\nbut took to cover behind the bank, and could not be moved forward.\r\nFrank Blairs brigade, of Steele's division, in support, also\r\ncrossed the bayou, passed over the space of level ground to the\r\nfoot of the hills; but, being unsupported by Morgan, and meeting a\r\nvery severe cross-fire of artillery, was staggered and gradually\r\nfell back, leaving about five hundred men behind, wounded and\r\nprisoners; among them Colonel Thomas Fletcher, afterward Governor\r\nof Missouri.  Part of Thayer's brigade took a wrong direction, and\r\ndid not cross the bayou at all; nor did General Morgan cross in\r\nperson.  This attack failed; and I have always felt that it was due\r\nto the failure of General G. W. Morgan to obey his orders, or to\r\nfulfill his promise made in person.  Had he used with skill and\r\nboldness one of his brigades, in addition to that of Blair's, he\r\ncould have made a lodgment on the bluff, which would have opened\r\nthe door for our whole force to follow.  Meantime the Sixth\r\nMissouri Infantry, at heavy loss, had also crossed the bayou at the\r\nnarrow passage lower down, but could not ascend the steep bank;\r\nright over their heads was a rebel battery, whose fire was in a\r\nmeasure kept down by our sharp-shooters (Thirteenth United States\r\nInfantry) posted behind logs, stumps, and trees, on our side of the\r\nbayou.\r\n\r\nThe men of the Sixth Missouri actually scooped out with their hands\r\ncaves in the bank, which sheltered them against the fire of the\r\nenemy, who, right over their heads, held their muskets outside the\r\nparapet vertically, and fired down So critical was the position,\r\nthat we could not recall the men till after dark, and then one at a\r\ntime.  Our loss had been pretty heavy, and we had accomplished\r\nnothing, and had inflicted little loss on our enemy.  At first I\r\nintended to renew the assault, but soon became satisfied that, the\r\nenemy's attention having been drawn to the only two practicable\r\npoints, it would prove too costly, and accordingly resolved to look\r\nelsewhere for a point below Haines's Bluff, or Blake's plantation.\r\nThat night I conferred with Admiral Porter, who undertook to cover\r\nthe landing; and the next day (December 30th) the boats were all\r\nselected, but so alarmed were the captains and pilots, that we had\r\nto place sentinels with loaded muskets to insure their remaining at\r\ntheir posts.  Under cover of night, Steele's division, and one\r\nbrigade of Stuart's, were drawn out of line, and quietly embarked\r\non steamboats in the Yazoo River.  The night of December 30th was\r\nappointed for this force, under the command of General Fred Steele,\r\nto proceed up the Yazoo just below Haines's Bluff, there to\r\ndisembark about daylight, and make a dash for the hills.  Meantime\r\nwe had strengthened our positions near Chickasaw Bayou, had all our\r\nguns in good position with parapets, and had every thing ready to\r\nrenew our attack as soon as we heard the sound of battle above.\r\n\r\nAt midnight I left Admiral Porter on his gunboat; he had his fleet\r\nready and the night was propitious.  I rode back to camp and gave\r\norders for all to be ready by daybreak; but when daylight came I\r\nreceived a note from General Steele reporting that, before his\r\nboats had got up steam, the fog had settled down on the river so\r\nthick and impenetrable, that it was simply impossible to move; so\r\nthe attempt had to be abandoned.  The rain, too, began to fall, and\r\nthe trees bore water-marks ten feet above our heads, so that I\r\nbecame convinced that the part of wisdom was to withdraw.  I\r\nordered the stores which had been landed to be reembarked on the\r\nboats, and preparations made for all the troops to regain their\r\nproper boats during the night of the 1st of January, 1863.  From\r\nour camps at Chickasaw we could hear, the whistles of the trains\r\narriving in Vicksburg, could see battalions of men marching up\r\ntoward Haines's Bluff, and taking post at all points in our front.\r\nI was more than convinced that heavy reenforcements were coming to\r\nVicksburg; whether from Pemberton at Grenada, Bragg in Tennessee,\r\nor from other sources, I could not tell; but at no point did the\r\nenemy assume the offensive; and when we drew off our rear-guard, on\r\nthe morning of the 2d, they simply followed up the movement,\r\ntimidly.  Up to that moment I had not heard a word from General\r\nGrant since leaving Memphis; and most assuredly I had listened for\r\ndays for the sound of his guns in the direction of Yazoo City.  On\r\nthe morning of January 2d, all my command were again afloat in\r\ntheir proper steamboats, when Admiral Porter told me that General\r\nMcClernand had arrived at the mouth of the Yazoo in the steamboat\r\nTigress, and that it was rumored he had come down to supersede me.\r\nLeaving my whole force where it was, I ran down to the month of the\r\nYazoo in a small tug boat, and there found General McClernand, with\r\norders from the War Department to command the expeditionary force\r\non the Mississippi River.  I explained what had been done, and what\r\nwas the actual state of facts; that the heavy reenforcements\r\npouring into Vicksburg must be Pemberton's army, and that General\r\nGrant must be near at hand.  He informed me that General Grant was\r\nnot coming at all; that his depot at Holly Springs had been\r\ncaptured by Van Dorn, and that he had drawn back from Coffeeville\r\nand Oxford to Holly Springs and Lagrange; and, further, that\r\nQuinby's division of Grant's army was actually at Memphis for\r\nstores when he passed down.  This, then, fully explained how\r\nVicksburg was being reenforced.  I saw that any attempt on the\r\nplace from the Yazoo was hopeless; and, with General McClernand's\r\nfull approval, we all came out of the Yazoo, and on the 3d of\r\nJanuary rendezvoused at Milliken's Bend, about ten miles above.\r\nOn the 4th General McClernand issued his General Order No. 1,\r\nassuming command of the Army of the Mississippi, divided into two\r\ncorps; the first to be commanded by General Morgan, composed of his\r\nown and A. J. Smith's divisions; and the second, composed of\r\nSteele's and Stuart's divisions, to be commanded by me.  Up to that\r\ntime the army had been styled the right wing of (General Grant's)\r\nThirteenth Army Corps, and numbered about thirty thousand men.  The\r\naggregate loss during the time of any command, mostly on the 29th\r\nof December, was one hundred and seventy-five killed, nine hundred\r\nand thirty wounded, and seven hundred and forty-three prisoners.\r\nAccording to Badeau, the rebels lost sixty-three killed, one\r\nhundred and thirty-four wounded, and ten prisoners.  It afterward\r\ntranspired that Van Dorn had captured Holly Springs on the 20th of\r\nDecember, and that General Grant fell back very soon after.\r\nGeneral Pemberton, who had telegraphic and railroad communication\r\nwith Vicksburg, was therefore at perfect liberty to reenforce the\r\nplace with a garrison equal, if not superior, to my command.  The\r\nrebels held high, commanding ground, and could see every movement\r\nof our men and boats, so that the only possible hope of success\r\nconsisted in celerity and surprise, and in General Grant's holding\r\nall of Pemberton's army hard pressed meantime.  General Grant was\r\nperfectly aware of this, and had sent me word of the change, but it\r\ndid not reach me in time; indeed, I was not aware of it until after\r\nmy assault of December 29th, and until the news was brought me by\r\nGeneral McClernand as related.  General McClernand was appointed to\r\nthis command by President Lincoln in person, who had no knowledge\r\nof what was then going on down the river.  Still, my relief, on the\r\nheels of a failure, raised the usual cry, at the North, of\r\n\"repulse, failure, and bungling.\"  There was no bungling on my\r\npart, for I never worked harder or with more intensity of purpose\r\nin my life; and General Grant, long after, in his report of the\r\noperations of the siege of Vicksburg, gave us all full credit for\r\nthe skill of the movement, and described the almost impregnable\r\nnature of the ground; and, although in  all official reports I\r\nassumed the whole responsibility, I have ever felt that had General\r\nMorgan promptly and skillfully sustained the lead of Frank Blair's\r\nbrigade on that day, we should have broken the rebel line, and\r\neffected a lodgment on the hills behind Vicksburg.  General Frank\r\nBlair was outspoken and  indignant against Generals Morgan and De\r\nCourcey at the time, and always abused me for assuming the whole\r\nblame.  But, had we succeeded, we might have found ourselves in a\r\nworse trap, when General Pemberton was at full liberty to turn his\r\nwhole force against us.  While I was engaged at Chickasaw Bayou,\r\nAdmiral Porter was equally busy in the Yazoo River, threatening the\r\nenemy's batteries at Haines's and Snyder's Bluffs above.  In a\r\nsharp engagement he lost one of his best officers, in the person of\r\nCaptain Gwin, United States Navy, who, though on board an ironclad,\r\ninsisted on keeping his post on deck, where he was struck in the\r\nbreast by a round shot, which carried away the muscle,  and\r\ncontused the lung within, from which he died a few days after.  We\r\nof the army deplored his loss quite as much as his fellows of the\r\nnavy, for he had been intimately associated with us in our previous\r\noperations on the Tennessee River, at Shiloh and above, and we had\r\ncome to regard him as one of us.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January, 1863, our fleet of transports was collected\r\nat Milliken's Bend, about ten miles above the mouth of the Yazoo,\r\nAdmiral Porter remaining with his gunboats at the Yazoo.  General\r\nJohn A. McClernand was in chief command, General George W. Morgan\r\ncommanded the First Corps and I the Second Corps of the Army of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nI had learned that a small steamboat, the Blue Wing, with a mail,\r\ntowing coal-barges and loaded with ammunition, had left Memphis for\r\nthe Yazoo, about the 20th of December, had been captured by a rebel\r\nboat which had come out of the Arkansas River, and had been carried\r\nup that river to Fort Hind.\r\n\r\nWe had reports from this fort, usually called the \"Post of\r\nArkansas,\" about forty miles above the mouth, that it was held by\r\nabout five thousand rebels, was an inclosed work, commanding the\r\npassage of the river, but supposed to be easy of capture from the\r\nrear.  At that time I don't think General McClernand had any\r\ndefinite views or plays of action.  If so, he did not impart them\r\nto me.  He spoke, in general terms of opening the navigation of the\r\nMississippi, \"cutting his way to the sea,\" etc., etc., but the\r\nmodus operandi was not so clear.  Knowing full well that we could\r\nnot carry on operations against Vicksburg as long as the rebels\r\nheld the Post of Arkansas, whence to attack our boats coming and\r\ngoing without convoy, I visited him on his boat, the Tigress, took\r\nwith me a boy who had been on the Blue Wing, and had escaped, and\r\nasked leave to go up the Arkansas, to clear out the Post.  He made\r\nvarious objections, but consented to go with me to see Admiral\r\nPorter about it.  We got up steam in the Forest Queen, during the\r\nnight of January 4th, stopped at the Tigress, took General\r\nMcClernand on board, and proceeded down the river by night to the\r\nadmiral's boat, the Black Hawk, lying in the mouth of the Yazoo.\r\nIt must have been near midnight, and Admiral Porter was in\r\ndeshabille.  We were seated in his cabin and I explained my views\r\nabout Arkansas Post, and asked his cooperation.  He said that he\r\nwas short of coal, and could not use wood in his iron-clad boats.\r\nOf these I asked for two, to be commanded by Captain Shirk or\r\nPhelps, or some officer of my acquaintance.  At that moment, poor\r\nGwin lay on his bed, in a state-room close by, dying from the\r\neffect of the cannon shot received at Haines's Bluff, as before\r\ndescribed.  Porter's manner to McClernand was so curt that I\r\ninvited him out into a forward-cabin where he had his charts, and\r\nasked him what he meant by it.  He said that \"he did not like him;\"\r\nthat in Washington, before coming West, he had been introduced to\r\nhim by President Lincoln, and he had taken a strong prejudice\r\nagainst him.  I begged him, for the sake of harmony, to waive that,\r\nwhich he promised to do.  Returning to the cabin, the conversation\r\nwas resumed, and, on our offering to tow his gunboats up the river\r\nto save coal, and on renewing the request for Shirk to command the\r\ndetachment, Porter said, \"Suppose I go along myself?\"  I answered,\r\nif he would do so, it would insure the success of the enterprise.\r\nAt that time I supposed General McClernand would send me on this\r\nbusiness, but he concluded to go himself, and to take his whole\r\nforce.  Orders were at once issued for the troops not to disembark\r\nat Milliken's Bend, but to remain as they were on board the\r\ntransports.  My two divisions were commanded--the First, by\r\nBrigadier-General Frederick Steele, with three brigades, commanded\r\nby Brigadier-Generals F. P. Blair, C. E. Hooey, and J. M. Thayer;\r\nthe Second, by Brigadier-General D. Stuart, with two brigades,\r\ncommanded by Colonels G. A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith.\r\n\r\nThe whole army, embarked on steamboats convoyed by the gunboats, of\r\nwhich three were iron-clads, proceeded up the Mississippi River to\r\nthe mouth of White River, which we reached January 8th.  On the\r\nnext day we continued up White River to the \"Cut-off;\" through this\r\nto the Arkansas, and up the Arkansas to Notrib's farm, just below\r\nFort Hindman.  Early the next morning we disembarked.  Stuart's\r\ndivision, moving up the river along the bank, soon encountered a\r\nforce of the enemy intrenched behind a line of earthworks,\r\nextending from the river across to the swamp.  I took Steele's\r\ndivision, marching by the flank by a road through the swamp to the\r\nfirm ground behind, and was moving up to get to the rear of Fort\r\nHindman, when General McClernand overtook me, with the report that\r\nthe rebels had abandoned their first position, and had fallen back\r\ninto the fort.  By his orders, we counter-marched, recrossed the\r\nswamp, and hurried forward to overtake Stuart, marching for Fort\r\nHindman.  The first line of the rebels was about four miles below\r\nFort Hindman, and the intervening space was densely, wooded and\r\nobscure, with the exception of some old fields back of and close to\r\nthe fort.  During the night, which was a bright moonlight one, we\r\nreconnoitred close up, and found a large number of huts which had\r\nbeen abandoned, and the whole rebel force had fallen back into and\r\nabout the fort.  Personally I crept up to a stump so close that I\r\ncould hear the enemy hard at work, pulling down houses, cutting\r\nwith axes, and building intrenchments.  I could almost hear their\r\nwords, and I was thus listening when, about 4 A. M. the bugler in\r\nthe rebel camp sounded as pretty a reveille as I ever listened to.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight broke it revealed to us a new line of parapet\r\nstraight across the peninsula, connecting Fort Hindman, on the\r\nArkansas River bank, with the impassable swamp about a mile to its\r\nleft or rear.  This peninsula was divided into two nearly equal\r\nparts by a road.  My command had the ground to the right of the\r\nroad, and Morgan's corps that to the left.  McClernand had his\r\nquarters still on the Tigress, back at Notrib's farm, but moved\r\nforward that morning (January 11th) to a place in the woods to our\r\nrear, where he had a man up a tree, to observe and report the\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThere was a general understanding with Admiral Porter that he was\r\nto attack the fort with his three ironclad gunboats directly by its\r\nwater-front, while we assaulted by land in the rear.  About 10 A.M.\r\nI got a message from General McClernand, telling me where he could\r\nbe found, and asking me what we were waiting for.  I answered that\r\nwe were then in close contact with the enemy, viz., about five or\r\nsix hundred yards off; that the next movement must be a direct\r\nassault; that this should be simultaneous along the whole line; and\r\nthat I was waiting to hear from the gunboats; asking him to notify\r\nAdmiral Porter that we were all ready.  In about half an hour I\r\nheard the clear ring of the navy-guns; the fire gradually\r\nincreasing in rapidity and advancing toward the fort.  I had\r\ndistributed our field-guns, and, when I judged the time had come, I\r\ngave the orders to begin.  The intervening ground between us and\r\nthe enemy was a dead level, with the exception of one or two small\r\ngullies, and our men had no cover but the few standing trees and\r\nsome logs on the ground.  The troops advanced well under a heavy\r\nfire, once or twice falling to the ground for a sort of rest or\r\npause.  Every tree had its group of men, and behind each log was a\r\ncrowd of sharp-shooters, who kept up so hot a fire that the rebel\r\ntroops fired wild.  The fire of the fort proper was kept busy by\r\nthe gunboats and Morgan's corps, so that all my corps had to\r\nencounter was the direct fire from the newly-built parapet across\r\nthe peninsula.  This line had three sections of field-guns, that\r\nkept things pretty lively, and several round-shot came so near me\r\nthat I realized that they were aimed at my staff; so I dismounted,\r\nand made them scatter.\r\n\r\nAs the gunboats got closer up I saw their flags actually over the\r\nparapet of Fort Hindman, and the rebel gunners scamper out of the\r\nembrasures and run down into the ditch behind.  About the same time\r\na man jumped up on the rebel parapet just where the road entered,\r\nwaving a large white flag, and numerous smaller white rags appeared\r\nabove the parapet along the whole line.  I immediately ordered,\r\n\"Cease firing!\" and sent the same word down the line to General\r\nSteele, who had made similar progress on the right, following the\r\nborder of he swamp.  I ordered my aide, Colonel Dayton, to jump on\r\nhis horse and ride straight up to the large white flag, and when\r\nhis horse was on the parapet I followed with the rest of my staff.\r\nAll firing had ceased, except an occasional shot away to the right,\r\nand one of the captains (Smith) of the Thirteenth Regulars was\r\nwounded after the display of the white flag.  On entering the line,\r\nI saw that our muskets and guns had done good execution; for there\r\nwas a horse-battery, and every horse lay dead in the traces.  The\r\nfresh-made parapet had been knocked down in many places, and dead\r\nmen lay around very thick.  I inquired who commanded at that point,\r\nand a Colonel Garland stepped up and said that he commanded that\r\nbrigade.  I ordered him to form his brigade, stack arms, hang the\r\nbelts on the muskets, and stand waiting for orders.  Stuart's\r\ndivision had been halted outside the parapet.  I then sent Major\r\nHammond down the rebel line to the right, with orders to stop\r\nSteele's division outside, and to have the other rebel brigade\r\nstack its arms in like manner, and to await further orders.  I\r\ninquired of Colonel Garland who commanded in chief, and he said\r\nthat General Churchill did, and that he was inside the fort.  I\r\nthen rode into the fort, which was well built, with good parapets,\r\ndrawbridge, and ditch, and was an inclosed work of four bastions.\r\nI found it full of soldiers and sailors, its parapets toward the\r\nriver well battered in, and Porter's gunboats in the river, close\r\nagainst the fort, with their bows on shore.  I soon found General\r\nChurchill, in conversation with Admiral Porter and General A. J.\r\nSmith, and about this time my adjutant-general, Major J. H.\r\nHammond, came and reported that General Deshler, who commanded the\r\nrebel brigade facing and opposed to Steele, had refused to stack\r\narms and surrender, on the ground that he had received no orders\r\nfrom his commanding general; that nothing separated this brigade\r\nfrom Steele's men except the light parapet, and that there might be\r\ntrouble there at any moment.  I advised General Churchill to send\r\norders at once, because a single shot might bring the whole of\r\nSteele's division on Deshler's brigade, and I would not be\r\nresponsible for the consequences; soon afterward, we both concluded\r\nto go in person.  General Churchill had the horses of himself and\r\nstaff in the ditch; they were brought in, and we rode together to\r\nwhere Garland was standing, and Churchill spoke to him in an angry\r\ntone, \"Why did you display the white flag!\"  Garland replied, \"I\r\nreceived orders to do so from one of your staff.\"  Churchill denied\r\ngiving such an order, and angry words passed between them.  I\r\nstopped them, saying that it made little difference then, as they\r\nwere in our power.  We continued to ride down the line to its\r\nextreme point, where we found Deshler in person, and his troops\r\nwere still standing to the parapet with their muskets in hand.\r\nSteele'e men were on the outside.  I asked Deshler: \"What does this\r\nmean? You are a regular officer, and ought to know better.\"  He\r\nanswered, snappishly, that \"he had received no orders to\r\nsurrender;\" when General Churchill said: \"You see, sir, that we are\r\nin their power, and you may surrender.\"  Deshler turned to his\r\nstaff-officers and ordered them to repeat the command to \"stack\r\narms,\" etc., to the colonels of his brigade.  I was on my horse,\r\nand he was on foot.  Wishing to soften the blow of defeat, I spoke\r\nto him kindly, saying that I knew a family of Deshlers in Columbus,\r\nOhio, and inquired if they were relations of his.  He disclaimed\r\nany relation with people living north of the Ohio, in an offensive\r\ntone, and I think I gave him a piece of my mind that he did not\r\nrelish.  He was a West Point graduate, small but very handsome, and\r\nwas afterward killed in battle.  I never met him again.\r\n\r\nReturning to the position where I had first entered the rebel line,\r\nI received orders from General McClernand, by one of his staff, to\r\nleave General A. J. Smith in charge of the fort and prisoners, and\r\nwith my troops to remain outside.  The officer explained that the\r\ngeneral was then on the Tigress, which had moved up from below, to\r\na point in the river just above the fort; and not understanding his\r\norders, I concluded to go and see him in person.  My troops were\r\nthen in possession of two of the three brigades which composed the\r\narmy opposed to us; and my troops were also in possession of all\r\nthe ground of the peninsula outside the \"fort-proper\" (Hindman).  I\r\nfound General McClernand on the Tigress, in high spirits.  He said\r\nrepeatedly: \"Glorious! glorious! my star is ever in the ascendant!\"\r\nHe spoke complimentarily of the troops, but was extremely jealous\r\nof the navy.  He said: \"I'll make a splendid report;\"  \"I had a man\r\nup a tree;\" etc.  I was very hungry and tired, and fear I did not\r\nappreciate the honors in reserve for us, and asked for something to\r\neat and drink.  He very kindly ordered something to be brought, and\r\nexplained to me that by his \"orders\" he did not wish to interfere\r\nwith the actual state of facts; that General A. J. Smith would\r\noccupy \"Fort Hindman,\" which his troops had first entered, and I\r\ncould hold the lines outside, and go on securing the prisoners and\r\nstores as I had begun.  I returned to the position of Garland's\r\nbrigade and gave the necessary orders for marching all the\r\nprisoners, disarmed, to a pocket formed by the river and two deep\r\ngullies just above the fort, by which time it had become quite\r\ndark.  After dark another rebel regiment arrived from Pine Bluff,\r\nmarched right in, and was also made prisoners.  There seemed to be\r\na good deal of feeling among the rebel officers against Garland,\r\nwho asked leave to stay with me that night, to which I of course\r\nconsented.  Just outside the rebel parapet was a house which had\r\nbeen used for a hospital.  I had a room cleaned out, and occupied\r\nit that night.  A cavalry-soldier lent me his battered coffee-pot\r\nwith some coffee and scraps of hard bread out of his nose-bag;\r\nGarland and I made some coffee, ate our bread together, and talked\r\npolitics by the fire till quite late at night, when we lay down on\r\nstraw that was saturated with the blood of dead or wounded men.\r\nThe next day the prisoners were all collected on their boats, lists\r\nwere made out, and orders given for their transportation to St.\r\nLouis, in charge of my aide, Major Sanger.  We then proceeded to\r\ndismantle and level the forts, destroy or remove the stores, and we\r\nfound in the magazine the very ammunition which had been sent for\r\nus in the Blue Wing, which was secured and afterward used in our\r\ntwenty-pound Parrott guns.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th we reembarked; the whole expedition returned out of the\r\nriver by the direct route down the Arkansas during a heavy\r\nsnow-storm, and rendezvoused in the Mississippi, at Napoleon, at\r\nthe mouth of the Arkansas.  Here General McClernand told me he had\r\nreceived a letter from General Grant at Memphis, who disapproved of\r\nour movement up the Arkansas; but that communication was made\r\nbefore he had learned of our complete success.  When informed of\r\nthis, and of the promptness with which it had been executed, he\r\ncould not but approve.  We were then ordered back to Milliken's\r\nBend, to await General Grant's arrival in person.  We reached\r\nMilliken's Bend January 21st.\r\n\r\nMcClernand's report of the capture of Fort Hindman almost ignored\r\nthe action of Porter's fleet altogether.  This was unfair, for I\r\nknow that the admiral led his fleet in person in the river-attack,\r\nand that his guns silenced those of Fort Hindman, and drove the\r\ngunners into the ditch.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate loss in my corps at Arkansas Post was five hundred\r\nand nineteen, viz., four officers and seventy-five men killed,\r\nthirty-four officers and four hundred and six men wounded.  I never\r\nknew the losses in the gunboat fleet, or in Morgan's corps; but\r\nthey must have been less than in mine, which was more exposed.  The\r\nnumber of rebel dead must have been nearly one hundred and fifty;\r\nof prisoners, by actual count, we secured four thousand seven\r\nhundred and ninety-one, and sent them north to St. Louis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nVICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nJANUARY TO JULY, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1863, resulting, in the capture of Vicksburg, was\r\nso important, that its history has been well studied and well\r\ndescribed in all the books treating of the civil war, more\r\nespecially by Dr. Draper, in his \"History of the Civil War in\r\nAmerica,\" and in Badeau's \"Military History of General Grant.\"  In\r\nthe latter it is more fully and accurately given than in any other,\r\nand is well illustrated by maps and original documents.  I now need\r\nonly attempt to further illustrate Badeau's account by some\r\nadditional details.  When our expedition came out of the Arkansas\r\nRiver, January, 18,1863, and rendezvoused at the river-bank, in\r\nfront of the town of Napoleon, Arkansas, we were visited by General\r\nGrant in person, who had come down from Memphis in a steamboat.\r\nAlthough at this time Major-General J. A. McClernand was in command\r\nof the Army of the Mississippi, by virtue of a confidential order\r\nof the War Department, dated October 21, 1862, which order bore the\r\nindorsement of President Lincoln, General Grant still exercised a\r\ncommand over him, by reason of his general command of the\r\nDepartment of the Tennessee.  By an order (No. 210) of December 18,\r\n1862, from the War Department, received at Arkansas Post, the\r\nWestern armies had been grouped into five corps d'armee, viz.: the\r\nThirteenth, Major-General McClernand; the Fourteenth, Major-General\r\nGeorge H. Thomas, in Middle Tennessee; the Fifteenth, Major-General\r\nW. T. Sherman; the Sixteenth, Major-General Hurlbut, then at or\r\nnear Memphis; and the Seventeenth, Major-General McPherson, also at\r\nand back of Memphis.  General Grant when at Napoleon, on the 18th\r\nof January, ordered McClernand with his own and my corps to return\r\nto Vicksburg, to disembark on the west bank, and to resume work on\r\na canal across the peninsula, which had been begun by General\r\nThomas Williams the summer before, the object being to turn the\r\nMississippi River at that point, or at least to make a passage for\r\nour fleet of gunboats and transports across the peninsula, opposite\r\nVicksburg.  General Grant then returned to Memphis, ordered to Lake\r\nProvidence, about sixty miles above us, McPherson's corps, the\r\nSeventeenth, and then came down again to give his personal\r\nsupervision to the whole movement.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi River was very high and rising, and we began that\r\nsystem of canals on which we expended so much hard work\r\nfruitlessly: first, the canal at Young's plantation, opposite\r\nVicksburg; second, that at Lake Providence; and third, at the Yazoo\r\nPass, leading into the head-waters of the Yazoo River.  Early in\r\nFebruary the gunboats Indianola and Queen of the West ran the\r\nbatteries of Vicksburg.  The latter was afterward crippled in Red\r\nRiver, and was captured by the rebels; and the Indianola was butted\r\nand sunk about forty miles below Vicksburg.  We heard the booming\r\nof the guns, but did not know of her loss till some days after.\r\nDuring the months of January and February, we were digging the\r\ncanal and fighting off the water of the Mississippi, which\r\ncontinued to rise and threatened to drown us.  We had no sure place\r\nof refuge except the narrow levee, and such steamboats as remained\r\nabreast of our camps.  My two divisions furnished alternately a\r\ndetail of five hundred men a day, to work on the canal.  So high\r\nwas the water in the beginning of March, that McClernand's corps\r\nwas moved to higher ground, at Milliken's Bend, but I remained at\r\nYoung's plantation, laid off a due proportion of the levee for each\r\nsubdivision of my command, and assigned other parts to such\r\nsteamboats as lay at the levee.  My own headquarters were in Mrs.\r\nGrove's house, which had the water all around it, and could only be\r\nreached by a plank-walk from the levee, built on posts.  General\r\nFrederick Steele commanded the first division, and General D. Smart\r\nthe second; this latter division had been reenforced by General\r\nHugh Ewing's brigade, which had arrived from West Virginia.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its date I received the following note from General\r\nGrant:\r\n\r\nMILLIKEN'S BEND, March 16, 1863\r\n\r\nGeneral SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: I have just returned from a reconnoissance up Steele's\r\nBayou, with the admiral (Porter), and five of his gunboats.  With\r\nsome labor in cutting tree-tops out of the way, it will be\r\nnavigable for any class of steamers.\r\n\r\nI want you to have your pioneer corps, or one regiment of good men\r\nfor such work, detailed, and at the landing as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe party will want to take with them their rations, arms, and\r\nsufficient camp and garrison equipage for a few days.  I will have\r\na boat at any place you may designate, as early as the men can be\r\nthere.  The Eighth Missouri (being many of them boatmen) would be\r\nexcellent men for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you give directions for these men to be in readiness,\r\ncome up and see me, and I will explain fully.  The tug that takes\r\nthis is instructed to wait for you.  A full supply of axes will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was instantly (8 A.M.) sent to Colonel Giles A. Smith,\r\ncommanding the Eighth Missouri, with orders to prepare immediately.\r\nHe returned it at 9.15, with an answer that the regiment was all\r\nready.  I went up to Milliken's Bend in the tug, and had a\r\nconference with the general, resulting in these orders:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nBEFORE VICKSBURG, March 16, 1863\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Fifteenth Army Corps.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: You will proceed as early as practicable up Steele's\r\nBayou, and through Black Bayou to Deer Creek, and thence with the\r\ngunboats now there by any route they may take to get into the Yazoo\r\nRiver, for the purpose of determining the feasibility of getting an\r\narmy through that route to the east bank of that river, and at a\r\npoint from which they can act advantageously against Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nMake such details from your army corps as may be required to clear\r\nout the channel of the various bayous through which transports\r\nwould have to ran, and to hold such points as in your judgment\r\nshould be occupied.\r\n\r\nI place at your disposal to-day the steamers Diligent and Silver\r\nWave, the only two suitable for the present navigation of this\r\nroute.  Others will be supplied you as fast as required, and they\r\ncan be got.\r\n\r\nI have given directions (and you may repeat them) that the party\r\ngoing on board the steamer Diligent push on until they reach Black\r\nBayou, only stopping sufficiently long at any point before reaching\r\nthere to remove such obstructions as prevent their own progress.\r\nCaptain Kossak, of the Engineers, will go with this party.  The\r\nother boat-load will commence their work in Steele's Bayou, and\r\nmake the navigation as free as possible all the way through.\r\n\r\nThere is but little work to be done in Steele's Bayou, except for\r\nabout five miles abort midway of the bayou.  In this portion many\r\noverhanging trees will have to be removed, and should be dragged\r\nout of the channel.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn returning to my camp at Young's Point, I started these two boats\r\nup the Yazoo and Steele's Bayou, with the Eighth Missouri and some\r\npioneers, with axes, saws, and all the tools necessary.  I gave\r\norders for a part of Stuart's division to proceed in the large\r\nboats up the Mississippi River to a point at Gwin's plantation,\r\nwhere a bend of Steele's Bayou neared the main river; and the next\r\nday, with one or two stag-officers and orderlies, got a navy-tug,\r\nand hurried up to overtake Admiral Porter.  About sixty miles up\r\nSteele's Bayou we came to the gunboat Price, Lieutenant Woodworth,\r\nUnited States Navy; commanding, and then turned into Black Bayou, a\r\nnarrow, crooked channel, obstructed by overhanging oaks, and filled\r\nwith cypress and cotton-wood trees.  The gunboats had forced their\r\nway through, pushing aside trees a foot in diameter.  In about four\r\nmiles we overtook the gunboat fleet just as it was emerging into\r\nDeer Creek.  Along Deer Creek the alluvium was higher, and there\r\nwas a large cotton-plantation belonging to a Mr. Hill, who was\r\nabsent, and the negroes were in charge of the place.  Here I\r\novertook Admiral Porter, and accompanied him a couple of miles up\r\nDeer Creek, which was much wider and more free of trees, with\r\nplantations on both sides at intervals.  Admiral Porter thought he\r\nhad passed the worst, and that he would be able to reach the\r\nRolling Fork and Sunflower.  He requested me to return and use all\r\npossible means to clear out Black Bayou.  I returned to Hill's\r\nplantation, which was soon reached by Major Coleman, with a part\r\nof the Eighth Missouri; the bulk of the regiment and the pioneers\r\nhad been distributed along the bayous, and set to work under\r\nthe general supervision of Captain Kosaak.  The Diligent and\r\nSilver Wave then returned to twin's plantation and brought up\r\nBrigadier-General Giles A. Smith, with the Sixth Missouri, and part\r\nof the One Hundred and Sixteenth Illinois.  Admiral Porter was then\r\nworking up Deer Creek with his iron-clads, but he had left me a tug,\r\nwhich enabled me to reconnoitre the country, which was all under\r\nwater except the narrow strip along Deer Creek.  During the 19th I\r\nheard the heavy navy-guns booming more frequently than seemed\r\nconsistent with mere guerrilla operations; and that night I got a\r\nmessage from Porter, written on tissue-paper, brought me through\r\nthe swamp by a negro, who had it concealed in a piece of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe admiral stated that he had met a force of infantry and\r\nartillery which gave him great trouble by killing the men who had\r\nto expose themselves outside the iron armor to shove off the bows\r\nof the boats, which had so little headway that they would not\r\nsteer.  He begged me to come to his rescue as quickly as possible.\r\nGiles A. Smith had only about eight hundred men with him, but I\r\nordered him to start up Deer Creek at once, crossing to the east\r\nside by an old bridge at Hill's plantation, which we had repaired\r\nfor the purpose; to work his way up to the gunboat, fleet, and to\r\nreport to the admiral that I would come, up with every man I could\r\nraise as soon as possible.  I was almost alone at Hill's, but took\r\na canoe, paddled down Black Bayou to the gunboat Price, and there,\r\nluckily, found the Silver wave with a load of men just arrived from\r\ntwin's plantation.  Taking some of the parties who were at work\r\nalong the bayou into an empty coal-barge, we tugged it up by a\r\nnavy-tug, followed by the Silver Wave, crashing through the trees,\r\ncarrying away pilot-house, smoke-stacks, and every thing\r\nabove-deck; but the captain (McMillan, of Pittsburg) was a brave\r\nfellow, and realized the necessity.  The night was absolutely\r\nblack, and we could only make two and a half of the four miles.  We\r\nthen disembarked, and marched through the canebrake, carrying\r\nlighted candles in our hands, till we got into the open\r\ncotton-fields at Hill's plantation, where we lay down for a few\r\nhours' rest.  These men were a part of Giles A. Smith's brigade,\r\nand part belonged to the brigade of T. Bilby Smith, the senior\r\nofficer present being Lieutenant-Colonel Rice, Fifty-fourth Ohio,\r\nan excellent young officer.  We had no horses.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, March 21st, as soon as daylight appeared, we\r\nstarted, following the same route which Giles A. Smith had taken\r\nthe day before; the battalion of the Thirteenth United States\r\nRegulars, Major Chase, in the lead.  We could hear Porter's guns,\r\nand knew that moments were precious.  Being on foot myself, no man\r\ncould complain, and we generally went at the double-quick, with\r\noccasional rests.  The road lay along Deer Creek, passing several\r\nplantations; and occasionally, at the bends, it crossed the swamp,\r\nwhere the water came above my hips.  The smaller drummer-boys had\r\nto carry their drums on their heads, and most of the men slang\r\ntheir cartridge-boxes around their necks.  The soldiers generally\r\nwere glad to have their general and field officers afoot, but we\r\ngave them a fair specimen of marching, accomplishing about\r\ntwenty-one miles by noon.  Of course, our speed was accelerated by\r\nthe sounds of the navy-guns, which became more and more distinct,\r\nthough we could see nothing.  At a plantation near some Indian\r\nmounds we met a detachment of the Eighth Missouri, that had been up\r\nto the fleet, and had been sent down as a picket to prevent any\r\nobstructions below.  This picket reported that Admiral Porter had\r\nfound Deer Creek badly obstructed, had turned back; that there was\r\na rebel force beyond the fleet, with some six-pounders, and nothing\r\nbetween us and the fleet.  So I sat down on the door-sill of a\r\ncabin to rest, but had not been seated ten minutes when, in the\r\nwood just ahead, not three hundred yards off, I heard quick and\r\nrapid firing of musketry.  Jumping up, I ran up the road, and found\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Rice, who said the head of his column had struck\r\na small force of rebels with a working gang of negroes, provided\r\nwith axes, who on the first fire had broken and run back into the\r\nswamp.  I ordered Rice to deploy his brigade, his left on the road,\r\nand extending as far into the swamp as the ground would permit, and\r\nthen to sweep forward until he uncovered the gunboats.  The\r\nmovement was rapid and well executed, and we soon came to some\r\nlarge cotton-fields and could see our gunboats in Deer Creek,\r\noccasionally firing a heavy eight-inch gun across the cotton field\r\ninto the swamp behind.  About that time Major Kirby, of the Eighth\r\nMissouri, galloped down the road on a horse he had picked up the\r\nnight before, and met me.  He explained the situation of affairs,\r\nand offered me his horse.  I got on bareback, and rode up the\r\nlevee, the sailors coming out of their iron-clads and cheering most\r\nvociferously as I rode by, and as our men swept forward across the\r\ncotton-field in full view.  I soon found Admiral Porter, who was on\r\nthe deck of one of his iron-clads, with a shield made of the\r\nsection of a smoke-stack, and I doubt if he was ever more glad to\r\nmeet a friend than he was to see me.  He explained that he had\r\nalmost reached the Rolling Fork, when the woods became full of\r\nsharp-shooters, who, taking advantage of trees, stumps, and the\r\nlevee, would shoot down every man that poked his nose outside the\r\nprotection of their armor; so that he could not handle his clumsy\r\nboats in the narrow channel.  The rebels had evidently dispatched a\r\nforce from Haines's Bluff up the Sunflower to the Rolling Fork, had\r\nanticipated the movement of Admiral Porter's fleet, and had\r\ncompletely obstructed the channel of the upper part of Deer Creek\r\nby felling trees into it, so that further progress in that\r\ndirection was simply impossible.  It also happened that, at the\r\ninstant of my arrival, a party of about four hundred rebels, armed\r\nand supplied with axes, had passed around the fleet and had got\r\nbelow it, intending in like manner to block up the channel by the\r\nfelling of trees, so as to cut off retreat.  This was the force we\r\nhad struck so opportunely at the time before described.  I inquired\r\nof Admiral Porter what he proposed to do, and he said he wanted to\r\nget out of that scrape as quickly as possible.  He was actually\r\nworking back when I met him, and, as we then had a sufficient force\r\nto cover his movement completely, he continued to back down Deer\r\nCreek.  He informed me at one time things looked so critical that\r\nhe had made up his mind to blow up the gunboats, and to escape with\r\nhis men through the swamp to the Mississippi River.  There being no\r\nlonger any sharp-shooters to bother the sailors, they made good\r\nprogress; still, it took three full days for the fleet to back out\r\nof Deer Creek into Black Bayou, at Hill's plantation, whence\r\nAdmiral Porter proceeded to his post at the month of the Yazoo,\r\nleaving Captain Owen in command of the fleet.  I reported the facts\r\nto General Grant, who was sadly disappointed at the failure of the\r\nfleet to get through to the Yazoo above Haines's Bluff, and ordered\r\nus all to resume our camps at Young's Point.  We accordingly\r\nsteamed down, and regained our camps on the 27th.  As this\r\nexpedition up Deer Creek was but one of many efforts to secure a\r\nfooting from which to operate against Vicksburg, I add the report\r\nof Brigadier-General Giles A. Smith, who was the first to reach the\r\nfleet:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, SECOND DIVISION\r\nFIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS, YOUNGS POINT, LOUISIANA,\r\nMarch 28, 1863\r\n\r\nCaptain L. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN:  I have the honor to report the movements of the First\r\nBrigade in the expedition up Steele's Bayou, Black Bayou, and Deer\r\nCreek.  The Sixth Missouri and One Hundred and Sixteenth Illinois\r\nregiments embarked at the month of Muddy Bayou on the evening of\r\nThursday, the 18th of March, and proceeded up Steele's Bayou to the\r\nmonth of Black; thence up Black Bayou to Hill's plantation, at its\r\njunction with Deer Creek, where we arrived on Friday at four\r\no'clock p.m., and joined the Eighth Missouri, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nColeman commanding, which had arrived at that point two days\r\nbefore.  General Sherman had also established his headquarters\r\nthere, having preceded the Eighth Missouri in a tug, with no other\r\nescort than two or three of his staff, reconnoitring all the\r\ndifferent bayous and branches, thereby greatly facilitating the\r\nmovements of the troops, but at the same time exposing himself\r\nbeyond precedent in a commanding general.  At three o'clock of\r\nSaturday morning, the 20th instant, General Sherman having received\r\na communication from Admiral Porter at the mouth of Rolling Fork,\r\nasking for a speedy cooperation of the land forces with his fleet,\r\nI was ordered by General Sherman to be ready, with all the\r\navailable force at that point, to accompany him to his relief; but\r\nbefore starting it was arranged that I should proceed with the\r\nforce at hand (eight hundred men), while he remained, again\r\nentirely unprotected, to hurry up the troops expected to arrive\r\nthat night, consisting of the Thirteenth Infantry and One Hundred\r\nand Thirteenth Illinois Volunteers, completing my brigade, and the\r\nSecond Brigade, Colonel T. Kilby Smith commanding.\r\n\r\nThis, as the sequel showed; proved a very wise measure, and\r\nresulted in the safety of the whole fleet.  At daybreak we were in\r\nmotion, with a regular guide.  We had proceeded but about six\r\nmiles, when we found the enemy had been very busy felling trees to\r\nobstruct the creek.\r\n\r\nAll the negroes along the route had been notified to be ready at\r\nnight fall to continue the work.  To prevent this as much as\r\npossible, I ordered all able-bodied negroes to be taken along, and\r\nwarned some of the principal inhabitants that they would be held\r\nresponsible for any more obstructions being placed across the\r\ncreek.  We reached the admiral about four o'clock p.m., with no\r\nopposition save my advance-guard (Company A, Sixth Missouri) being\r\nfired into from the opposite side of  the creek, killing one man,\r\nand slightly wounding another; having no way of crossing, we had to\r\ncontent ourselves with driving them beyond musket-range.\r\nProceeding with as little loss of time as possible, I found the\r\nfleet obstructed in front by fallen trees, in rear by a sunken\r\ncoal-barge, and surrounded, by a large force of rebels with an\r\nabundant supply of artillery, but wisely keeping their main force\r\nout of range of the admiral's guns.  Every tree and stump covered a\r\nsharp-shooter, ready to pick off any luckless marine who showed his\r\nhead above-decks, and entirely preventing the working-parties from\r\nremoving obstructions.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of orders from General Sherman, I reported to Admiral\r\nPorter for orders, who turned over to me all the land-forces in his\r\nfleet (about one hundred and fifty men), together with two\r\nhowitzers, and I was instructed by him to retain a sufficient force\r\nto clear out the sharp-shooters, and to distribute the remainder\r\nalong the creek for six or seven miles below, to prevent any more\r\nobstructions being placed in it during the night.  This was\r\nspeedily arranged, our skirmishers capturing three prisoners.\r\nImmediate steps were now taken to remove the coal-barge, which was\r\naccomplished about daylight on Sunday morning, when the fleet moved\r\nback toward Black Bayou.  By three o'clock p.m.  we had only made\r\nabout six miles, owing to the large number of trees to be removed;\r\nat this point, where our progress was very slow, we discovered a\r\nlong line of the enemy filing along the edge of the woods, and\r\ntaking position on the creek below us, and about one mile ahead of\r\nour advance.  Shortly after, they opened fire on the gunboats from\r\nbatteries behind the cavalry and infantry.  The boats not only\r\nreplied to the batteries, which they soon silenced, but poured a\r\ndestructive fire into their lines.  Heavy skirmishing was also\r\nheard in our front, supposed to be by three companies from the\r\nSixth and Eighth Missouri, whose position, taken the previous night\r\nto guard the creek, was beyond the point reached by the enemy, and\r\nconsequently liable to be cut off or captured.  Captain Owen, of\r\nthe Louisville, the leading boat, made every effort to go through\r\nthe obstructions and aid in the rescuing of the men.  I ordered\r\nMajor Kirby, with four companies of the Sixth Missouri, forward,\r\nwith two companies deployed.  He soon met General Sherman, with the\r\nThirteenth Infantry and One Hundred and Thirteenth Illinois,\r\ndriving the enemy before them, and opening communication along the\r\ncreek with the gunboats.  Instead of our three companies referred\r\nto as engaging the enemy, General Sherman had arrived at a very\r\nopportune moment with the two regiments mentioned above, and the\r\nSecond Brigade.  The enemy, not expecting an attack from that\r\nquarter, after some hot skirmishing, retreated.  General Sherman\r\nimmediately ordered the Thirteenth Infantry and One Hundred and\r\nThirteenth Illinois to pursue; but, after following their trace for\r\nabout two miles, they were recalled.\r\n\r\nWe continued our march for about two miles, when we bivouacked for\r\nthe night.  Early on Monday morning (March 22d) we continued our\r\nmarch, but owing to the slow progress of the gunboats did not reach\r\nHill's plantation until Tuesday, the 23d instant, where we remained\r\nuntil the 25th; we then reembarked, and arrived at Young's Point on\r\nFriday, the 27th instant.\r\n\r\nBelow you will find a list of casualties.  Very respectfully,\r\n\r\nGiles A. SMITH,\r\nColonel Eighth Missouri, commanding First Brigade.\r\n\r\nP. S.-I forgot to state above that the Thirteenth Infantry and One\r\nHundred and Thirteenth Illinois being under the immediate command\r\nof General Sherman, he can mention them as their conduct deserves.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of April, a division of troops, commanded by\r\nBrigadier-General J. M. Tuttle, was assigned to my corps, and\r\nwas designated the Third Division; and, on the 4th of April,\r\nBrigadier-General D. Stuart was relieved from the command of the\r\nSecond Division, to which Major-General Frank P. Blair was appointed\r\nby an order from General Grant's headquarters.  Stuart had been with\r\nme from the time we were at Benton Barracks, in command of the\r\nFifty-fifth Illinois, then of a brigade, and finally of a division;\r\nbut he had failed in seeking a confirmation by the Senate to his\r\nnomination as brigadier-general, by reason of some old affair at\r\nChicago, and, having resigned his commission as colonel, he was out\r\nof service. I esteemed him very highly, and was actually mortified\r\nthat the service should thus be deprived of so excellent and gallant\r\nan officer.  He afterward settled in New Orleans as a lawyer, and\r\ndied about 1867 or 1868.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of April, my command, the Fifteenth Corps, was composed\r\nof three divisions:\r\n\r\nThe First Division, commanded by Major-General Fred Steele; and his\r\nthree brigades by Colonel Manter, Colonel Charles R. Wood, and\r\nBrigadier-General John M. Thayer.\r\n\r\nThe Second Division, commanded by Major-General Frank P. Blair; and\r\nhis three brigades by Colonel Giles A. Smith, Colonel Thomas Gilby\r\nSmith, and Brigadier-General Hugh Ewing.\r\n\r\nThe Third Division, commanded by Brigadier-General J. M. Tuttle;\r\nand his three brigades by Brigadier-General R. P. Buckland, Colonel\r\nJ. A. Mower, and Brigadier-General John E. Smith.\r\n\r\nMy own staff then embraced: Dayton, McCoy, and Hill, aides; J. H.\r\nHammond, assistant adjutant-general; Sanger, inspector-general;\r\nMcFeeley, commissary; J. Condit Smith, quartermaster; Charles\r\nMcMillan, medical director; Ezra Taylor, chief of artillery;\r\nJno. C. Neely, ordnance-officer; Jenney and Pitzman, engineers.\r\n\r\nBy this time it had become thoroughly demonstrated that we could\r\nnot divert the main river Mississippi, or get practicable access to\r\nthe east bank of the Yazoo, in the rear of Vicksburg, by any of the\r\npasses; and we were all in the habit of discussing the various\r\nchances of the future.  General Grant's headquarters were at\r\nMilliken's Bend, in tents, and his army was strung along the river\r\nall the way from Young's Point up to Lake Providence, at least\r\nsixty miles.  I had always contended that the best way to take\r\nVicksburg was to resume the movement which had been so well begun\r\nthe previous November, viz., for the main army to march by land\r\ndown the country inland of the Mississippi River; while the\r\ngunboat-fleet and a minor land-force should threaten Vicksburg on\r\nits river-front.\r\n\r\nI reasoned that, with the large force then subject to General\r\nGrant's orders-viz., four army corps--he could easily resume the\r\nmovement from Memphis, by way of Oxford and Grenada, to Jackson,\r\nMississippi, or down the ridge between the Yazoo and Big Black; but\r\nGeneral Grant would not, for reasons other than military, take any\r\ncourse which looked like, a step backward; and he himself concluded\r\non the river movement below Vicksburg, so as to appear like\r\nconnecting with General Banks, who at the same time was besieging\r\nPort Hudson from the direction of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nPreliminary orders had already been given, looking to the digging\r\nof a canal, to connect the river at Duckport with Willow Bayou,\r\nback of Milliken's Bend, so as to form a channel for the conveyance\r\nof supplies, by way of Richmond, to New Carthage; and several steam\r\ndredge-boats had come from the upper rivers to assist in the work.\r\nOne day early in April, I was up at General Grant's headquarters,\r\nand we talked over all these things with absolute freedom.  Charles\r\nA. Dana, Assistant Secretary of War, was there, and Wilson,\r\nRawlins, Frank Blair, McPherson, etc.  We all knew, what was\r\nnotorious, that General McClernand was still intriguing against\r\nGeneral Grant, in hopes to regain the command of the whole\r\nexpedition, and that others were raising a clamor against General\r\nGrant in the news papers at the North.  Even Mr. Lincoln and\r\nGeneral Halleck seemed to be shaken; but at no instant of time did\r\nwe (his personal friends) slacken in our loyalty to him.  One\r\nnight, after such a discussion, and believing that General\r\nMcClernand had no real plan of action shaped in his mind, I wrote\r\nmy letter of April 8, 1863, to Colonel Rawlins, which letter is\r\nembraced in full at page 616 of Badeau's book, and which I now\r\nreproduce here:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,\r\nCAMP NEAR VICKSBURG, April 8,1868.\r\n\r\nColonel J. A. RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General to General GRANT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I would most respectfully suggest (for reasons which I will\r\nnot name) that General Grant call on his corps commanders for their\r\nopinions, concise and positive, on the best general plan of a\r\ncampaign.  Unless this be done, there are men who will, in any\r\nresult falling below the popular standard, claim that their advice\r\nwas unheeded, and that fatal consequence resulted therefrom.  My\r\nown opinions are:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the Army of the Tennessee is now far in advance of the\r\nother grand armies of the United States.\r\n\r\nSecond.  That a corps from Missouri should forthwith be moved from\r\nSt. Louis to the vicinity of Little Rock, Arkansas; supplies\r\ncollected there while the river is full, and land communication\r\nwith Memphis opened via Des Arc on the White, and Madison on the\r\nSt. Francis River.\r\n\r\nThird.  That as much of the Yazoo Pass, Coldwater, and Tallahatchie\r\nRivers, as can be gained and fortified, be held, and the main army\r\nbe transported thither by land and water; that the road back to\r\nMemphis be secured and reopened, and, as soon as the waters\r\nsubside, Grenada be attacked, and the swamp-road across to Helena\r\nbe patrolled by cavalry.\r\n\r\nFourth.  That the line of the Yalabusha be the base from which to\r\noperate against the points where the Mississippi Central crosses\r\nBig Black, above Canton; and, lastly, where the Vicksburg & Jackson\r\nRailroad crosses the same river (Big Black).  The capture of\r\nVicksburg would result.\r\n\r\nFifth.  That a minor force be left in this vicinity, not to exceed\r\nten thousand men, with only enough steamboats to float and\r\ntransport them to any desired point; this force to be held always\r\nnear enough to act with the gunboats when the main army is known to\r\nbe near Vicksburg--Haines's Bluff or Yazoo City.\r\n\r\nSixth.  I do doubt the capacity of Willow Bayou (which I estimate\r\nto be fifty miles long and very tortuous) as a military channel, to\r\nsupply an army large enough to operate against Jackson,\r\nMississippi, or the Black River Bridge; and such a channel will be\r\nvery vulnerable to a force coming from the west, which we must\r\nexpect.  Yet this canal will be most useful as the way to convey\r\ncoals and supplies to a fleet that should navigate the lower reach\r\nof the Mississippi between Vicksburg and the Red River.\r\n\r\nSeventh.  The chief reason for operating solely by water was the\r\nseason of the year and high water in the Tallahatchie and Yalabusha\r\nRivers.  The spring is now here, and soon these streams will be no\r\nserious obstacle, save in the ambuscades of the forest, and\r\nwhatever works the enemy may have erected at or near Grenada.\r\nNorth Mississippi is too valuable for us to allow the enemy to hold\r\nit and make crops this year.\r\n\r\nI make these suggestions, with the request that General Grant will\r\nread them and give them, as I know he will, a share of his\r\nthoughts.  I would prefer that he should not answer this letter,\r\nbut merely give it as much or as little weight as it deserves.\r\nWhatever plan of action he may adopt will receive from me the same\r\nzealous cooperation and energetic support as though conceived by\r\nmyself.  I do not believe General Banks will make any serious\r\nattack on Port Hudson this spring.  I am, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the letter which some critics have styled a \"protest.\"  We\r\nnever had a council of war at any time during the Vicksburg\r\ncampaign.  We often met casually, regardless of rank or power, and\r\ntalked and gossiped of things in general, as officers do and\r\nshould.  But my letter speaks for itself--it shows my opinions\r\nclearly at that stage of the game, and was meant partially to\r\ninduce General Grant to call on General McClernand for a similar\r\nexpression of opinion, but, so far as I know, he did not.  He went\r\non quietly to work out his own designs; and he has told me, since\r\nthe war, that had we possessed in December, 1862, the experience of\r\nmarching and maintaining armies without a regular base, which we\r\nafterward acquired, he would have gone on from Oxford as first\r\ncontemplated, and would not have turned back because of the\r\ndestruction of his depot at Holly Springs by Van Dorn.  The\r\ndistance from Oxford to the rear of Vicksburg is little greater\r\nthan by the circuitous route we afterward followed, from Bruinsburg\r\nto Jackson and Vicksburg, during which we had neither depot nor\r\ntrain of supplies.  I have never criticised General Grant's\r\nstrategy on this or any other occasion, but I thought then that\r\nhe had lost an opportunity, which cost him and us six months'\r\nextra-hard work, for we might have captured Vicksburg from the\r\ndirection of Oxford in January, quite as easily as was afterward\r\ndone in July, 1863.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's orders for the general movement past Vicksburg, by\r\nRichmond and Carthage, were dated April 20, 1863.  McClernand was\r\nto lead off with his corps, McPherson next, and my corps (the\r\nFifteenth) to bring up the rear.  Preliminary thereto, on the night\r\nof April 16th, seven iron-clads led by Admiral Porter in person, in\r\nthe Benton, with three transports, and ten barges in tow, ran the\r\nVicksburg batteries by night.  Anticipating a scene, I had four\r\nyawl-boats hauled across the swamp, to the reach of the river below\r\nVicksburg, and manned them with soldiers, ready to pick up any of\r\nthe disabled wrecks as they floated by.  I was out in the stream\r\nwhen the fleet passed Vicksburg, and the scene was truly sublime.\r\nAs soon as the rebel gunners detected the Benton, which was in the\r\nlead, they opened on her, and on the others in succession, with\r\nshot and shell; houses on the Vicksburg side and on the opposite\r\nshore were set on fire, which lighted up the whole river; and the\r\nroar of cannon, the bursting of shells, and finally the burning of\r\nthe Henry Clay, drifting with the current, made up a picture of the\r\nterrible not often seen.  Each gunboat returned the fire as she\r\npassed the town, while the transports hugged the opposite shore.\r\nWhen the Benton had got abreast of us, I pulled off to her,\r\nboarded, had a few words with Admiral Porter, and as she was\r\ndrifting rapidly toward the lower batteries at Warrenton, I left,\r\nand pulled back toward the shore, meeting the gunboat Tuscumbia\r\ntowing the transport Forest Queen into the bank out of the range of\r\nfire.  The Forest Queen, Captain Conway, had been my flag-boat up\r\nthe Arkansas, and for some time after, and I was very friendly with\r\nher officers.  This was the only transport whose captain would not\r\nreceive volunteers as a crew, but her own officers and crew stuck\r\nto their boat, and carried her safely below the Vicksburg\r\nbatteries, and afterward rendered splendid service in ferrying\r\ntroops across the river at Grand Gulf and Bruinsburg.  In passing\r\nVicksburg, she was damaged in the hull and had a steam-pipe cut\r\naway, but this was soon repaired.  The Henry Clay was set on fire\r\nby bursting shells, and burned up; one of my yawls picked up her\r\npilot floating on a piece of wreck, and the bulk of her crew\r\nescaped in their own yawl-boat to the shore above.  The Silver\r\nWave, Captain McMillan, the same that was with us up Steele's\r\nBayou, passed safely, and she also rendered good service afterward.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on the night of April 26th, six other transports with\r\nnumerous barges loaded with hay, corn, freight, and provisions,\r\nwere drifted past Vicksburg; of these the Tigress was hit, and sunk\r\njust as she reached the river-bank below, on our side: I was there\r\nwith my yawls, and saw Colonel Lagow, of General Grant's staff, who\r\nhad passed the batteries in the Tigress, and I think he was\r\nsatisfied never to attempt such a thing again.  Thus General\r\nGrant's army had below Vicksburg an abundance of stores, and boats\r\nwith which to cross the river.  The road by which the troops\r\nmarched was very bad, and it was not until the 1st of May that it\r\nwas clear for my corps.  While waiting my turn to march, I received\r\na letter from General Grant, written at Carthage, saying that he\r\nproposed to cross over and attack Grand Gulf, about the end of\r\nApril, and he thought I could put in my time usefully by making a\r\n\"feint\" on Haines's Bluff, but he did not like to order me to do\r\nit, because it might be reported at the North that I had again been\r\n\"repulsed, etc.\"  Thus we had to fight a senseless clamor at the\r\nNorth, as well as a determined foe and the obstacles of Nature.  Of\r\ncourse, I answered him that I would make the \"feint,\" regardless of\r\npublic clamor at a distance, and I did make it most effectually;\r\nusing all the old boats I could get about Milliken's Bend and the\r\nmouth of the Yazoo, but taking only ten small regiments, selected\r\nout of Blair's division, to make a show of force.  We afterward\r\nlearned that General Pemberton in Vicksburg had previously\r\ndispatched a large force to the assistance of General Bowers, at\r\nGrand Gulf and Port Gibson, which force had proceeded as far as\r\nHankinson's Ferry, when he discovered our ostentatious movement up\r\nthe Yazoo, recalled his men, and sent them up to Haines's Bluff to\r\nmeet us.  This detachment of rebel troops must have marched nearly\r\nsixty miles without rest, for afterward, on reaching Vicksburg, I\r\nheard that the men were perfectly exhausted, and lay along the road\r\nin groups, completely fagged out.  This diversion, made with so\r\nmuch pomp and display, therefore completely fulfilled its purpose,\r\nby leaving General Grant to contend with a minor force, on landing\r\nat Bruinsburg, and afterward at Port Gibson and Grand Gulf.\r\n\r\nIn May the waters of the Mississippi had so far subsided that all\r\nour canals were useless, and the roads had become practicable.\r\nAfter McPherson's corps had passed Richmond, I took up the route of\r\nmarch, with Steele's and Tuttle's divisions.  Blair's division\r\nremained at Milliken's Bend to protect our depots there, till\r\nrelieved by troops from Memphis, and then he was ordered to follow\r\nus.  Our route lay by Richmond and Roundabout Bayou; then,\r\nfollowing Bayou Vidal we struck the Mississippi at Perkins's\r\nplantation.  Thence the route followed Lake St. Joseph to a\r\nplantation called Hard Times, about five miles above Grand Gulf.\r\nThe road was more or less occupied by wagons and detachments\r\nbelonging to McPherson's corps; still we marched rapidly and\r\nreached Hard Times on the 6th of May.  Along the Bayou or Lake St.\r\nJoseph were many very fine cotton plantations, and I recall that of\r\na Mr. Bowie, brother-in-law of the Hon. Reverdy Johnson, of\r\nBaltimore.  The house was very handsome, with a fine, extensive\r\ngrass-plot in front.  We entered the yard, and, leaving our horses\r\nwith the headquarters escort, walked to the house.  On the\r\nfront-porch I found a magnificent grand-piano, with several\r\nsatin-covered arm-chairs, in one of which sat a Union soldier (one\r\nof McPherson's men), with his feet on the keys of the piano, and\r\nhis musket and knapsack lying on the porch.  I asked him what he\r\nwas doing there, and he answered that he was \"taking a rest;\" this\r\nwas manifest and I started him in a hurry, to overtake his command.\r\nThe house was tenantless, and had been completely ransacked;\r\narticles of dress and books were strewed about, and a handsome\r\nboudoir with mirror front had been cast down, striking a French\r\nbedstead, shivering the glass.  The library was extensive, with a\r\nfine collection of books; and hanging on the wall were two\r\nfull-length portraits of Reverdy Johnson and his wife, one of the\r\nmost beautiful ladies of our country, with whom I had been\r\nacquainted in Washington at the time of General Taylor's\r\nadministration.  Behind the mansion was the usual double row of\r\ncabins called the \"quarters.\"  There I found an old negro (a family\r\nservant) with several women, whom I sent to the house to put things\r\nin order; telling the old man that other troops would follow, and\r\nhe must stand on the porch to tell any officers who came along that\r\nthe property belonged to Mr. Bowie, who was the brother-in-law of\r\nour friend Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Baltimore, asking them to see\r\nthat no further harm was done.  Soon after we left the house I saw\r\nsome negroes carrying away furniture which manifestly belonged to\r\nthe house, and compelled them to carry it back; and after reaching\r\ncamp that night, at Hard Times, I sent a wagon back to Bowie's\r\nplantation, to bring up to Dr. Hollingsworth's house the two\r\nportraits for safe keeping; but before the wagon had reached\r\nBowie's the house was burned, whether by some of our men or by\r\nnegroes I have never learned.\r\n\r\nAt the river there was a good deal of scrambling to get across,\r\nbecause the means of ferriage were inadequate; but by the aid of\r\nthe Forest Queen and several gunboats I got my command across\r\nduring the 7th of May, and marched out to Hankiuson's Ferry\r\n(eighteen miles), relieving General Crocker's division of\r\nMcPherson's corps.  McClernand's corps and McPherson's were still\r\nahead, and had fought the battle of Port Gibson, on the 11th.  I\r\novertook General Grant in person at Auburn, and he accompanied my\r\ncorps all the way into Jackson, which we reached May 14th.\r\nMcClernand's corps had been left in observation toward Edwards's\r\nFerry.  McPherson had fought at Raymond, and taken the left-hand\r\nroad toward Jackson, via Clinton, while my troops were ordered by\r\nGeneral Grant in person to take the right-hand road leading through\r\nMississippi Springs.  We reached Jackson at the same time;\r\nMcPherson fighting on the Clinton road, and my troops fighting just\r\noutside the town, on the Raymond road, where we captured three\r\nentire field-batteries, and about two hundred prisoners of war.\r\nThe rebels, under General Joe Johnston, had retreated through the\r\ntown northward on the Canton road.  Generals Grant, McPherson, and\r\nI, met in the large hotel facing the State-House, where the former\r\nexplained to us that he had intercepted dispatches from Pemberton\r\nto Johnston, which made it important for us to work smart to\r\nprevent a junction of their respective forces.  McPherson was\r\nordered to march back early the next day on the Clinton road to\r\nmake junction with McClernand, and I was ordered to remain one day\r\nto break up railroads, to destroy the arsenal, a foundery, the\r\ncotton-factory of the Messrs.  Green, etc., etc., and then to\r\nfollow McPherson.\r\n\r\nMcPherson left Jackson early on the 15th, and General Grant during\r\nthe same day.  I kept my troops busy in tearing up railroad-tracks,\r\netc., but early on the morning of the 16th received notice from\r\nGeneral Grant that a battle was imminent near Edwards's Depot; that\r\nhe wanted me to dispatch one of my divisions immediately, and to\r\nfollow with the other as soon as I had completed the work of\r\ndestruction.  Steele's division started immediately, and later in\r\nthe day I followed with the other division (Tuttle's).  Just as I\r\nwas leaving Jackson, a very fat man came to see me, to inquire if\r\nhis hotel, a large, frame building near the depot, were doomed to\r\nbe burned.  I told him we had no intention to burn it, or any other\r\nhouse, except the machine-shops, and such buildings as could easily\r\nbe converted to hostile uses.  He professed to be a law-abiding\r\nUnion man, and I remember to have said that this fact was manifest\r\nfrom the sign of his hotel, which was the \"Confederate Hotel;\" the\r\nsign \"United States\" being faintly painted out, and \"Confederate\"\r\npainted over it! I remembered that hotel, as it was the\r\nsupper-station for the New Orleans trains when I used to travel the\r\nroad before the war.  I had not the least purpose, however, of\r\nburning it, but, just as we were leaving the town, it burst out in\r\nflames and was burned to the ground.  I never found out exactly who\r\nset it on fire, but was told that in one of our batteries were some\r\nofficers and men who had been made prisoners at Shiloh, with\r\nPrentiss's division, and had been carried past Jackson in a\r\nrailroad-train; they had been permitted by the guard to go to this\r\nvery hotel for supper, and had nothing to pay but greenbacks, which\r\nwere refused, with insult, by this same law-abiding landlord.\r\nThese men, it was said, had quietly and stealthily applied the fire\r\nunderneath the hotel just as we were leaving the town.\r\n\r\nAbout dark we met General Grant's staff-officer near Bolton\r\nStation, who turned us to the right, with orders to push on to\r\nVicksburg by what was known as the upper Jackson Road, which\r\ncrossed the Big Black at Bridgeport.  During that day (May 16th)\r\nthe battle of Champion Hills had been fought and won by\r\nMcClernand's and McPherson's corps, aided by one division of mine\r\n(Blairs), under the immediate command of General Grant; and\r\nMcPherson was then following the mass of  Pemberton's army,\r\ndisordered and retreating toward Vicksburg by the Edwards's Ferry\r\nroad.  General Blair's division had come up from the rear, was\r\ntemporarily attached to McClernand's corps, taking part with it in\r\nthe battle of Champion Hills, but on the 17th it was ordered by\r\nGeneral Grant across to Bridgeport, to join me there.\r\n\r\nJust beyond Bolton there was a small hewn-log house, standing back\r\nin a yard, in which was a well; at this some of our soldiers were\r\ndrawing water.  I rode in to get a drink, and, seeing a book on the\r\nground, asked some soldier to hand it to me.  It was a volume of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, and on the title-page was\r\nwritten the name of Jefferson Davis.  On inquiry of a negro, I\r\nlearned that the place belonged to the then President of the\r\nSouthern Confederation.  His brother Joe Davis's plantation was not\r\nfar off; one of my staff-officers went there, with a few soldiers,\r\nand took a pair of carriage-horses, without my knowledge at the\r\ntime.  He found Joe Davis at home, an old man, attended by a young\r\nand affectionate niece; but they were overwhelmed with grief to see\r\ntheir country overran and swarming with Federal troops.\r\n\r\nWe pushed on, and reached the Big Black early, Blair's\r\ntroops having preceded us by an hour or so.  I found General\r\nBlair in person, and he reported that there was no bridge across\r\nthe Big Black; that it was swimming-deep; and that there was\r\na rebel force on the opposite side, intrenched.  He had ordered\r\na detachment of the Thirteenth United States Regulars, under\r\nCaptain Charles Ewing, to strip some artillery-horses, mount the\r\nmen, and swim the river above the ferry, to attack and drive\r\naway the party on the opposite bank.  I did not approve of this\r\nrisky attempt, but crept down close to the brink of the\r\nriver-bank, behind a corn-crib belonging to a plantation house near\r\nby, and saw the parapet on the opposite bank.  Ordering a section of\r\nguns to be brought forward by hand behind this corn-crib, a few\r\nwell-directed shells brought out of their holes the little party\r\nthat was covering the crossing, viz., a lieutenant and ten men, who\r\ncame down to the river-bank and surrendered.  Blair's pon-toon-train\r\nwas brought up, consisting of India-rubber boats, one of which was\r\ninflated, used as a boat, and brought over the prisoners.  A\r\npontoon-bridge was at once begun, finished by night, and the troops\r\nbegan the passage.  After dark, the whole scene was lit up with\r\nfires of pitch-pine.  General Grant joined me there, and we sat on a\r\nlog, looking at the passage of the troops by the light of those\r\nfires; the bridge swayed to and fro under the passing feet, and made\r\na fine war-picture.  At daybreak we moved on, ascending the ridge,\r\nand by 10 A.M. the head of my column, long drawn out, reached the\r\nBenton road, and gave us command of the peninsula between the Yazoo\r\nand Big Black.  I dispatched Colonel Swan, of the Fourth Iowa\r\nCavalry, to Haines's Bluff, to capture that battery from the rear,\r\nand he afterward reported that he found it abandoned, its garrison\r\nhaving hastily retreated into Vicksburg, leaving their guns\r\npartially disabled, a magazine full of ammunition, and a hospital\r\nfull of wounded and sick men.  Colonel Swan saw one of our gunboats\r\nlying about two miles below in the Yazoo, to which he signaled.  She\r\nsteamed up, and to its commander the cavalry turned over the battery\r\nat Haines's Bluff, and rejoined me in front of Vicksburg.  Allowing\r\na couple of hours for rest and to close up the column, I resumed the\r\nmarch straight on Vicksburg. About two miles before reaching the\r\nforts, the road forked; the left was the main Jackson road, and the\r\nright was the \"graveyard\" road, which entered Vicksburg near a large\r\ncemetery.  General Grant in person directed me to take the\r\nright-hand road, but, as McPherson had not yet got up from the\r\ndirection of the railroad-bridge at Big Black, I sent the Eighth\r\nMissouri on the main Jackson road, to push the rebel skirmishers\r\ninto town, and to remain until relieved by McPherson's advance,\r\nwhich happened late that evening, May 18th.  The battalion of the\r\nThirteenth United States Regulars, commanded by Captain Washington,\r\nwas at the head of the column on the right-hand road, and pushed the\r\nrebels close behind their parapets; one of my staff, Captain\r\nPitzman, receiving a dangerous wound in the hip, which apparently\r\ndisabled him for life. By night Blair's whole division had closed up\r\nagainst the defenses of Vicksburg, which were found to be strong and\r\nwell manned; and, on General Steele's head of column arriving, I\r\nturned it still more to the right, with orders to work its way down\r\nthe bluff, so as to make connection with our fleet in the\r\nMississippi River.  There was a good deal of desultory fighting that\r\nevening, and a man was killed by the side of General Grant and\r\nmyself, as we sat by the road-side looking at Steele's division\r\npassing to the right.  General Steele's men reached the road which\r\nled from Vicksburg up to Haines's Bluff, which road lay at the foot\r\nof the hills, and intercepted some prisoners and wagons which were\r\ncoming down from Haines's Bluff.\r\n\r\nAll that night McPherson's troops were arriving by the main Jackson\r\nroad, and McClernand's by another near the railroad, deploying\r\nforward as fast as they struck the rebel works.  My corps (the\r\nFifteenth) had the right of the line of investment; McPherson's\r\n(the Seventeenth) the centre; and McClernand's (the Thirteenth) the\r\nleft, reaching from the river above to the railroad below.  Our\r\nlines connected, and invested about three-quarters of the\r\nland-front of the fortifications of Vicksburg.  On the supposition\r\nthat the garrison of Vicksburg was demoralized by the defeats at\r\nChampion Hills and at the railroad crossing of the Big Black,\r\nGeneral Grant ordered an assault at our respective fronts on the\r\n19th.  My troops reached the top of the parapet, but could not\r\ncross over.  The rebel parapets were strongly manned, and the enemy\r\nfought hard and well.  My loss was pretty heavy, falling chiefly on\r\nthe Thirteenth Regulars, whose commanding officer, Captain\r\nWashington, was killed, and several other regiments were pretty\r\nbadly cut up.  We, however, held the ground up to the ditch till\r\nnight, and then drew back only a short distance, and began to\r\ncounter-trench.  On the graveyard road, our parapet was within less\r\nthan fifty yards of the rebel ditch.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of May, General Grant called the three corps commanders\r\ntogether, viz., McClernand, McPherson, and Sherman.  We compared\r\nnotes, and agreed that the assault of the day before had failed, by\r\nreason of the natural strength of the position, and because we were\r\nforced by the nature of the ground to limit our attacks to the\r\nstrongest parts of the enemy's line, viz., where the three\r\nprincipal roads entered the city.\r\n\r\nIt was not a council of war, but a mere consultation, resulting in\r\norders from General Grant for us to make all possible preparations\r\nfor a renewed assault on the 22d, simultaneously, at 10 A.M.  I\r\nreconnoitred my front thoroughly in person, from right to left, and\r\nconcluded to make my real attack at the right flank of the bastion,\r\nwhere the graveyard road entered the enemy's intrenchments, and at\r\nanother point in the curtain about a hundred yards to its right\r\n(our left); also to make a strong demonstration by Steele's\r\ndivision, about a mile to our right, toward the river.  All our\r\nfield batteries were put in position, and were covered by good\r\nepaulements; the troops were brought forward, in easy support,\r\nconcealed by the shape of the ground; and to the minute,  viz.,\r\n10 A.M. of May 22d, the troops sprang to the assault.  A small\r\nparty, that might be called a forlorn hope, provided with plank to\r\ncross the ditch, advanced at a run, up to the very ditch; the lines\r\nof infantry sprang from cover, and advanced rapidly in line of\r\nbattle.  I took a position within two hundred yards of the rebel\r\nparapet, on the off slope of a spur of ground, where by advancing\r\ntwo or three steps I could see every thing.  The rebel line,\r\nconcealed by the parapet, showed no sign of unusual activity, but\r\nas our troops came in fair view, the enemy rose behind their\r\nparapet and poured a furious fire upon our lines; and, for about\r\ntwo hours, we had a severe and bloody battle, but at every point we\r\nwere repulsed.  In the very midst of this, when shell and shot fell\r\nfurious and fast, occurred that little episode which has been\r\ncelebrated in song and story, of the boy Orion P. Howe, badly\r\nwounded, bearing me a message for cartridges, calibre 54,\r\ndescribed in my letter to the Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War.\r\nThis boy was afterward appointed a cadet to the United States Naval\r\nAcademy, at Annapolis, but he could not graduate, and I do not now\r\nknow what has become of him.\r\n\r\nAfter our men had been fairly beaten back from off the parapet, and\r\nhad got cover behind the spurs of ground close up to the rebel\r\nworks, General Grant came to where I was, on foot, having left his\r\nhorse some distance to the rear.  I pointed out to him the rebel\r\nworks, admitted that my assault had failed, and he said the result\r\nwith McPherson and McClernand was about the same.  While he was\r\nwith me, an orderly or staff-officer came and handed him a piece of\r\npaper, which he read and handed to me.  I think the writing was in\r\npencil, on a loose piece of paper, and was in General McClernand's\r\nhandwriting, to the effect that \"his troops had captured the rebel\r\nparapet in his front,\" that, \"the flag of the Union waved over the\r\nstronghold of Vicksburg,\" and asking him (General Grant) to give\r\nrenewed orders to McPherson and Sherman to press their attacks on\r\ntheir respective fronts, lest the enemy should concentrate on him\r\n(McClernand).  General Grant said, \"I don't believe a word of it;\"\r\nbut I reasoned with him, that this note was official, and must be\r\ncredited, and I offered to renew the assault at once with new\r\ntroops.  He said he would instantly ride down the line to\r\nMcClernand's front, and if I did not receive orders to the\r\ncontrary, by 3 o'clock p.m., I might try it again.  Mower's fresh\r\nbrigade was brought up under cover, and some changes were made in\r\nGiles Smith's brigade; and, punctually at 3 p.m., hearing heavy\r\nfiring down along the line to my left, I ordered the second\r\nassault.  It was a repetition of the first, equally unsuccessful\r\nand bloody.  It also transpired that the same thing had occurred\r\nwith General McPherson, who lost in this second assault some most\r\nvaluable officers and men, without adequate result; and that\r\nGeneral McClernand, instead of having taken any single point of the\r\nrebel main parapet, had only taken one or two small outlying\r\nlunettes open to the rear, where his men were at the mercy of the\r\nrebels behind their main parapet, and most of them were actually\r\nthus captured.  This affair caused great feeling with us, and\r\nsevere criticisms on General McClernand, which led finally to his\r\nremoval from the command of the Thirteenth Corps, to which\r\nGeneral Ord succeeded.  The immediate cause, however, of\r\nGeneral McClernand's removal was the publication of a sort of\r\ncongratulatory order addressed to his troops, first published in\r\nSt. Louis, in which he claimed that he had actually succeeded in\r\nmaking a lodgment in Vicksburg, but had lost it, owing to the fact\r\nthat McPherson and Sherman did not fulfill their parts of the\r\ngeneral plan of attack.  This was simply untrue.  The two several\r\nassaults made May 22d, on the lines of Vicksburg, had failed, by\r\nreason of the great strength of the position and the determined\r\nfighting of its garrison.  I have since seen the position at\r\nSevastopol, and without hesitation I declare that at Vicksburg to\r\nhave been the more difficult of the two.\r\n\r\nThereafter our proceedings were all in the nature of a siege.\r\nGeneral Grant drew more troops from Memphis, to prolong our general\r\nline to the left, so as completely to invest the place on its\r\nland-side, while the navy held the river both above and below.\r\nGeneral Mower's brigade of Tuttle's division was also sent across\r\nthe river to the peninsula, so that by May 31st Vicksburg was\r\ncompletely beleaguered.  Good roads were constructed from our camps\r\nto the several landing-places on the Yazoo River, to which points\r\nour boats brought us ample supplies; so that we were in a splendid\r\ncondition for a siege, while our enemy was shut up in a close fort,\r\nwith a large civil population of men, women, and children to feed,\r\nin addition to his combatant force.  If we could prevent sallies,\r\nor relief from the outside, the fate of the garrison of Vicksburg\r\nwas merely a question of time.\r\n\r\nI had my headquarters camp close up to the works, near the centre\r\nof my corps, and General Grant had his bivouac behind a ravine to\r\nmy rear.  We estimated Pemberton's whole force in Vicksburg at\r\nthirty thousand men, and it was well known that the rebel General\r\nJoseph E. Johnston was engaged in collecting another strong force\r\nnear the Big Black, with the intention to attack our rear, and thus\r\nto afford Pemberton an opportunity to escape with his men.  Even\r\nthen the ability of General Johnston was recognized, and General\r\nGrant told me that he was about the only general on that side whom\r\nhe feared.  Each corps kept strong pickets well to the rear; but,\r\nas the rumors of Johnston's accumulating force reached us, General\r\nGrant concluded to take stronger measures.  He had received from\r\nthe North General J. G. Parker's corps (Ninth), which had been\r\nposted at Haines's Bluff; then, detailing one division from each of\r\nthe three corps d'armée investing Vicksburg, he ordered me to go\r\nout, take a general command of all, and to counteract any movement\r\non the part of General Johnston to relieve Vicksburg.  I\r\nreconnoitred the whole country, from Haines's Bluff to the railroad\r\nbridge, and posted the troops thus:\r\n\r\nParke's two divisions from Haines's Bluff out to the Benton or\r\nridge road; Tuttle's division, of my corps, joining on and\r\nextending to a plantation called Young's, overlooking Bear Creek\r\nvalley, which empties into the Big Black above Messinger's Ferry;\r\nthen McArthur's division, of McPherson's corps, took up the line,\r\nand reached to Osterhaus's division of McClernand's corps, which\r\nheld a strong fortified position at the railroad-crossing of the\r\nBig Black River.  I was of opinion that, if Johnston should cross\r\nthe Big Black, he could by the favorable nature of the country be\r\nheld in check till a concentration could be effected by us at the\r\npoint threatened.  From the best information we could gather,\r\nGeneral Johnston had about thirty or forty thousand men.  I took\r\npost near a plantation of one Trible, near Markham's, and\r\nfrequently reconnoitred the whole line, and could see the enemy\r\nengaged in like manner, on the east aide of Big Black; but he never\r\nattempted actually to cross over, except with some cavalry, just\r\nabove Bear Creek, which was easily driven back.  I was there from\r\nJune 20th to the 4th of July.  In a small log-house near Markham's\r\nwas the family of Mr. Klein, whose wife was the daughter of Mrs.\r\nDay, of New Orleans, who in turn was the sister of Judge T. W.\r\nBartley, my brother-in-law.  I used frequently to drop in and take\r\na meal with them, and Mrs. Klein was generally known as the\r\ngeneral's cousin, which doubtless saved her and her family from\r\nmolestation, too common on the part of our men.\r\n\r\nOne day, as I was riding the line near a farm known as Parson\r\nFog's, I heard that the family of a Mr. Wilkinson, of New Orleans,\r\nwas \"refugeeing\" at a house near by.  I rode up, inquired, and\r\nfound two young girls of that name, who said they were the children\r\nof General Wilkinson, of Louisiana, and that their brother had been\r\nat the Military School at Alexandria.  Inquiring for their mother,\r\nI was told she was spending the day at Parson Fox's.  As this house\r\nwas on my route, I rode there, went through a large gate into the\r\nyard, followed by my staff and escort, and found quite a number of\r\nladies sitting on the porch.  I rode up and inquired if that were\r\nParson Fox's.  The parson, a fine-looking, venerable old man, rose,\r\nand said that he was Parson Fox.  I then inquired for Mrs.\r\nWilkinson, when an elderly lady answered that she was the person.\r\nI asked her if she were from Plaquemine Parish, Louisiana, and she\r\nsaid she was.  I then inquired if she had a son who had been a\r\ncadet at Alexandria when General Sherman was superintendent, and\r\nshe answered yes.  I then announced myself, inquired after the boy,\r\nand she said he was inside of Vicksburg, an artillery lieutenant.\r\nI then asked about her husband, whom I had known, when she burst\r\ninto tears, and cried out in agony, \"You killed him at Bull Run,\r\nwhere he was fighting for his country!\"  I disclaimed killing\r\nanybody at Bull Run; but all the women present (nearly a dozen)\r\nburst into loud lamentations, which made it most uncomfortable for\r\nme, and I rode away.  On the 3d of July, as I sat at my bivouac by\r\nthe road-side near Trible's, I saw a poor, miserable horse,\r\ncarrying a lady, and led by a little negro boy, coming across a\r\ncotton-field toward me; as they approached I recognized poor Mrs.\r\nWilkinson, and helped her to dismount.  I inquired what had brought\r\nher to me in that style, and she answered that she knew Vicksburg\r\nwas going to surrender, and she wanted to go right away to see her\r\nboy.  I had a telegraph-wire to General Grant's headquarters, and\r\nhad heard that there were symptoms of surrender, but as yet nothing\r\ndefinite.  I tried to console and dissuade her, but she was\r\nresolved, and I could not help giving her a letter to General\r\nGrant, explaining to him who she was, and asking him to give her\r\nthe earliest opportunity to see her son.  The distance was fully\r\ntwenty miles, but off she started, and I afterward learned that my\r\nletter had enabled her to see her son, who had escaped unharmed.\r\nLater in the day I got by telegraph General Grant's notice of the\r\nnegotiations for surrender; and, by his directions, gave general\r\norders to my troops to be ready at a moment's notice to cross the\r\nBig Black, and go for Joe Johnston.\r\n\r\nThe next day (July 4, 1863) Vicksburg surrendered, and orders were\r\ngiven for at once attacking General Johnston.  The Thirteenth Corps\r\n(General Ord) was ordered to march rapidly, and cross the Big Black\r\nat the railroad-bridge; the Fifteenth by Mesainger's, and the Ninth\r\n(General Parker) by Birdsong's Ferry-all to converge on Bolton.  My\r\ncorps crossed the Big Black during the 5th and 6th of July, and\r\nmarched for Bolton, where we came in with General Ord's troops; but\r\nthe Ninth Corps was delayed in crossing at Birdsong's.  Johnston\r\nhad received timely notice of Pemberton's surrender, and was in\r\nfull retreat for Jackson.  On the 8th all our troops reached the\r\nneighborhood of Clinton, the weather fearfully hot, and water\r\nscarce.  Johnston had marched rapidly, and in retreating had caused\r\ncattle, hogs, and sheep, to be driven into the ponds of water, and\r\nthere shot down; so that we had to haul their dead and stinking\r\ncarcasses out to use the water.  On the 10th of July we had driven\r\nthe rebel army into Jackson, where it turned at bay behind the\r\nintrenchments, which had been enlarged and strengthened since our\r\nformer visit in May.  We closed our lines about Jackson; my corps\r\n(Fifteenth) held the centre, extending from the Clinton to the\r\nRaymond road; Ord's (Thirteenth) on the right, reaching Pearl River\r\nbelow the town; and Parker's (Ninth) the left, above the town.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th we pressed close in, and shelled the town from every\r\ndirection.  One of Ord's brigades (Lauman's) got too close, and was\r\nvery roughly handled and driven back in disorder.  General Ord\r\naccused the commander (General Lauman) of having disregarded his\r\norders, and attributed to him personally the disaster and heavy\r\nloss of men.  He requested his relief, which I granted, and General\r\nLauman went to the rear, and never regained his division.  He died\r\nafter the war, in Iowa, much respected, as before that time he had\r\nbeen universally esteemed a most gallant and excellent officer.\r\nThe weather was fearfully hot, but we continued to press the siege\r\nday and night, using our artillery pretty freely; and on the\r\nmorning of July 17th the place was found evacuated.  General\r\nSteele's division was sent in pursuit as far as Brandon (fourteen\r\nmiles), but General Johnston had carried his army safely off, and\r\npursuit in that hot weather would have been fatal to my command.\r\n\r\nReporting the fact to General Grant, he ordered me to return, to\r\nsend General Parkes's corps to Haines's Bluff, General Ord's back\r\nto Vicksburg, and he consented that I should encamp my whole corps\r\nnear the Big Black, pretty much on the same ground we had occupied\r\nbefore the movement, and with the prospect of a period of rest for\r\nthe remainder of the summer.  We reached our camps on the 27th of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a division of troops, commanded by Brigadier-General W.\r\nSooy Smith, had been added to my corps.  General Smith applied for\r\nand received a sick-leave on the 20th of July; Brigadier-General\r\nHugh Ewing was assigned to its command; and from that time it\r\nconstituted the Fourth Division of the Fifteenth Army Corps.\r\n\r\nPort Hudson had surrendered to General Banks on the 8th of July (a\r\nnecessary consequence of the fall of Vicksburg), and thus\r\nterminated probably the most important enterprise of the civil\r\nwar--the recovery of the complete control of the Mississippi River,\r\nfrom its source to its mouth--or, in the language of Mr. Lincoln,\r\nthe Mississippi went \"unvexed to the sea.\"\r\n\r\nI put my four divisions into handsome, clean camps, looking to\r\nhealth and comfort alone, and had my headquarters in a beautiful\r\ngrove near the house of that same Parson Fox where I had found the\r\ncrowd of weeping rebel women waiting for the fate of their friends\r\nin Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nThe loss sustained by the Fifteenth Corps in the assault of May\r\n19th, at Vicksburg, was mostly confined to the battalion of the\r\nThirteenth Regulars, whose commanding officer, Captain Washington,\r\nwas mortally wounded, and afterward died in the hands of the enemy,\r\nwhich battalion lost seventy-seven men out of the two hundred and\r\nfifty engaged; the Eighty-third Indiana (Colonel Spooner), and the\r\nOne Hundred and Twenty seventh Illinois (Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nEldridge), the aggregate being about two hundred.\r\n\r\nIn the assaults of the 22d, the loss in the Fifteenth Corps was\r\nabout six hundred.\r\n\r\nIn the attack on Jackson, Mississippi, during the 11th-16th of\r\nJuly, General Ord reported the loss in the Thirteenth Army Corps\r\nseven hundred and sixty-two, of which five hundred and thirty-three\r\nwere confined to Lauman's division; General Parkes reported, in the\r\nNinth Corps, thirty-seven killed, two hundred and fifty-eight\r\nwounded, and thirty-three missing: total, three hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight.  In the Fifteenth Corps the loss was less; so that,\r\nin the aggregate, the loss as reported by me at the time was less\r\nthan a thousand men, while we took that number alone of prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn General Grant's entire army before Vicksburg, composed of the\r\nNinth, part of the Sixteenth, and the whole of the Thirteenth;\r\nFifteenth, and Seventeenth Corps, the aggregate loss, as stated by\r\nBadeau, was:\r\n\r\nKilled: .......................  1243\r\nWounded:.......................  7095\r\nMissing: ......................   535\r\n\r\nTotal: ........................  8873\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas the Confederate loss, as stated by the same author,\r\n\r\nSurrendered at Vicksburg ..............  32000\r\nCaptured at Champion Hills.............   3000\r\nCaptured at Big Black Bridge ..........   2000\r\nCaptured at Port Gibson................   2000\r\nCaptured with Loring ..................   4000\r\nKilled and wounded ....................  10000\r\nStragglers.............................   3000\r\n\r\nTotal..................................  56000\r\n\r\nBesides which, \"a large amount of public property, consisting of\r\nrailroads, locomotives, cars, steamers, cotton, guns, muskets,\r\nammunition, etc., etc., was captured in Vicksburg.\"\r\n\r\nThe value of the capture of Vicksburg, however, was not measured by\r\nthe list of prisoners, guns, and small-arms, but by the fact that\r\nits possession secured the navigation of the great central river of\r\nthe continent, bisected fatally the Southern Confederacy, and set\r\nthe armies which had been used in its conquest free for other\r\npurposes; and it so happened that the event coincided as to time\r\nwith another great victory which crowned our arms far away, at\r\nGettysburg, Pennsylvania.  That was a defensive battle, whereas\r\nours was offensive in the highest acceptation of the term, and the\r\ntwo, occurring at the same moment of time, should have ended the\r\nwar; but the rebel leaders were mad, and seemed determined that\r\ntheir people should drink of the very lowest dregs of the cup of\r\nwar, which they themselves had prepared.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of Vicksburg, in its conception and execution,\r\nbelonged exclusively to General Grant, not only in the great whole,\r\nbut in the thousands of its details.  I still retain many of his\r\nletters and notes, all in his own handwriting, prescribing the\r\nroutes of march for divisions and detachments, specifying even the\r\namount of food and tools to be carried along.  Many persons gave\r\nhis adjutant general, Rawlins, the credit for these things, but\r\nthey were in error; for no commanding general of an army ever gave\r\nmore of his personal attention to details, or wrote so many of his\r\nown orders, reports, and letters, as General Grant.  His success at\r\nVicksburg justly gave him great fame at home and abroad.  The\r\nPresident conferred on him the rank of major-general in the regular\r\narmy, the highest grade then existing by law; and General McPherson\r\nand I shared in his success by receiving similar commissions as\r\nbrigadier-generals in the regular army.\r\n\r\nBut our success at Vicksburg produced other results not so\r\nfavorable to our cause--a general relaxation of effort, and desire\r\nto escape the hard drudgery of camp: officers sought leaves of\r\nabsence to visit their homes, and soldiers obtained furloughs and\r\ndischarges on the most slender pretexts; even the General\r\nGovernment seemed to relax in its efforts to replenish our ranks\r\nwith new men, or to enforce the draft, and the politicians were\r\npressing their schemes to reorganize or patch up some form of civil\r\ngovernment, as fast as the armies gained partial possession of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate this peculiar phase of our civil war, I give\r\nat this place copies of certain letters which have not heretofore\r\nbeen published:\r\n\r\n[Private.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, August 29, 1868.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, Vicksburg, Mississippi\r\n\r\nMy DEAR GENERAL: The question of reconstruction in Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, and Arkansas, will soon come up for decision of the\r\nGovernment, and not only the length of the war, but our ultimate\r\nand complete success, will depend upon its decision.  It is a\r\ndifficult matter, but I believe it can be successfully solved, if\r\nthe President will consult opinions of cool and discreet men, who\r\nare capable of looking at it in all its bearings and effects.  I\r\nthink he is disposed to receive the advice of our generals who have\r\nbeen in these States, and know much more of their condition than\r\ngassy politicians in Congress.  General Banks has written pretty\r\nfully, on the subject.  I wrote to General Grant, immediately,\r\nafter the fall of Vicksburg, for his views in regard to\r\nMississippi, but he has not yet answered.\r\n\r\nI wish you would consult with Grant, McPherson, and others of cool,\r\ngood judgment, and write me your views fully, as I may wish to use\r\nthem with the President.  You had better write me unofficially, and\r\nthen your letter will not be put on file, and cannot hereafter be\r\nused against you.  You have been in Washington enough to know how\r\nevery thing a man writes or says is picked up by his enemies and\r\nmisconstrued.  With kind wishes for your further success,\r\n\r\nI am yours truly,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK\r\n\r\n\r\n[Private and Confidential.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,\r\nCAMP ON BIG BLACK, MISSISSIPPI, September 17 1863\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Commander-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: I have received your letter of August 29th, and with\r\npleasure confide to you fully my thoughts on the important matters\r\nyou suggest, with absolute confidence that you will use what is\r\nvaluable, and reject the useless or superfluous.\r\n\r\nThat part of the continent of North America known as Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, and Arkansas, is in my judgment the key to the whole\r\ninterior.  The valley of the Mississippi is America, and, although\r\nrailroads have changed the economy of intercommunication, yet the\r\nwater-channels still mark the lines of fertile land, and afford\r\ncheap carriage to the heavy products of it.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the country on the Monongahela, the Illinois,\r\nthe Minnesota, the Yellowstone, and Osage, are as directly\r\nconcerned in the security of the Lower Mississippi as are those who\r\ndwell on its very banks in Louisiana; and now that the nation has\r\nrecovered its possession, this generation of men will make a\r\nfearful mistake if they again commit its charge to a people liable\r\nto misuse their position, and assert, as was recently done, that,\r\nbecause they dwelt on the banks of this mighty stream, they had a\r\nright to control its navigation.\r\n\r\nI would deem it very unwise at this time, or for years to come, to\r\nrevive the State governments of Louisiana, etc., or to institute in\r\nthis quarter any civil government in which the local people have\r\nmuch to say.  They had a government so mild and paternal that they\r\ngradually forgot they had any at all, save what they themselves\r\ncontrolled; they asserted an absolute right to seize public moneys,\r\nforts, arms, and even to shut up the natural avenues of travel and\r\ncommerce.  They chose war--they ignored and denied all the\r\nobligations of the solemn contract of government and appealed to\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nWe accepted the issue, and now they begin to realize that war is a\r\ntwo-edged sword, and it may be that many of the inhabitants cry for\r\npeace.  I know them well, and the very impulses of their nature;\r\nand to deal with the inhabitants of that part of the South which\r\nborders on the great river, we must recognize the classes into\r\nwhich they have divided themselves:\r\n\r\nFirst.  The large planters, owning lands, slaves, and all kinds of\r\npersonal property.  These are, on the whole, the ruling class.\r\nThey are educated, wealthy, and easily approached.  In some\r\ndistricts they are bitter as gall, and have given up slaves,\r\nplantations, and all, serving in the armies of the Confederacy;\r\nwhereas, in others, they are conservative.  None dare admit a\r\nfriendship for us, though they say freely that they were at the\r\noutset opposed to war and disunion.  I know we can manage this\r\nclass, but only by action.  Argument is exhausted, and words have\r\nlost their usual meaning.  Nothing but the logic of events touches\r\ntheir understanding; but, of late, this has worked a wonderful\r\nchange.  If our country were like Europe, crowded with people, I\r\nwould say it would be easier to replace this class than to\r\nreconstruct it, subordinate to the policy of the nation; but, as\r\nthis is not the case, it is better to allow the planters, with\r\nindividual exceptions, gradually to recover their plantations, to\r\nhire any species of labor, and to adapt themselves to the new order\r\nof things.  Still, their friendship and assistance to reconstruct\r\norder out of the present ruin cannot be depended on.  They watch\r\nthe operations of our armies, and hope still for a Southern\r\nConfederacy that will restore to them the slaves and privileges\r\nwhich they feel are otherwise lost forever.  In my judgment, we\r\nhave two more battles to win before we should even bother our minds\r\nwith the idea of restoring civil order--viz., one near Meridian, in\r\nNovember, and one near Shreveport, in February and March next, when\r\nRed River is navigable by our gunboats.  When these are done, then,\r\nand not until then, will the planters of Louisiana, Arkansas, and\r\nMississippi, submit.  Slavery is already gone, and, to cultivate\r\nthe land, negro or other labor must be hired.  This, of itself, is\r\na vast revolution, and time must be afforded to allow men to adjust\r\ntheir minds and habits to this new order of things.  A civil\r\ngovernment of the representative type would suit this class far\r\nless than a pure military role, readily adapting itself to actual\r\noccurrences, and able to enforce its laws and orders promptly and\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\nSecond.  The smaller farmers, mechanics, merchants, and laborers.\r\nThis class will probably number three-quarters of the whole; have,\r\nin fact, no real interest in the establishment of a Southern\r\nConfederacy, and have been led or driven into war on the false\r\ntheory that they were to be benefited somehow--they knew not how.\r\nThey are essentially tired of the war, and would slink back home if\r\nthey could.  These are the real tiers etat of the South, and are\r\nhardly worthy a thought; for they swerve to and fro according to\r\nevents which they do not comprehend or attempt to shape.  When the\r\ntime for reconstruction comes, they will want the old political\r\nsystem of caucuses, Legislatures, etc., to amuse them and make them\r\nbelieve they are real sovereigns; but in all things they will\r\nfollow blindly the lead of the planters.  The Southern politicians,\r\nwho understand this class, use them as the French do their masses\r\n--seemingly consult their prejudices, while they make their orders\r\nand enforce them.  We should do the same.\r\n\r\nThird.  The Union men of the South.  I must confess I have little\r\nrespect for this class.  They allowed a clamorous set of demagogues\r\nto muzzle and drive them as a pack of curs.  Afraid of shadows,\r\nthey submit tamely to squads of dragoons, and permit them, without\r\na murmur, to burn their cotton, take their horses, corn, and every\r\nthing; and, when we reach them, they are full of complaints if our\r\nmen take a few fence-rails for fire, or corn to feed our horses.\r\nThey give us no assistance or information, and are loudest in their\r\ncomplaints at the smallest excesses of our soldiers.  Their sons,\r\nhorses, arms, and every thing useful, are in the army against us,\r\nand they stay at home, claiming all the exemptions of peaceful\r\ncitizens.  I account them as nothing in this great game of war.\r\n\r\nFourth.  The young bloods of the South: sons of planters, lawyers\r\nabout towns, good billiard-players and sportsmen, men who never did\r\nwork and never will.  War suits them, and the rascals are brave,\r\nfine riders, bold to rashness, and dangerous subjects in every\r\nsense.  They care not a sou for niggers, land, or any thing.  They\r\nhate Yankees per se, and don't bother their brains about the past,\r\npresent, or future.  As long as they have good horses, plenty of\r\nforage, and an open country, they are happy.  This is a larger\r\nclass than most men suppose, and they are the most dangerous set of\r\nmen that this war has turned loose upon the world.  They are\r\nsplendid riders, first-rate shots, and utterly reckless.  Stewart,\r\nJohn Morgan, Forrest, and Jackson, are the types and leaders of\r\nthis class.  These men must all be killed or employed by us before\r\nwe can hope for peace.  They have no property or future, and\r\ntherefore cannot be influenced by any thing, except personal\r\nconsiderations.  I have two brigades of these fellows in my front,\r\ncommanded by Cosby, of the old army, and Whitfield, of Texas.\r\nStephen D. Lee is in command of the whole.  I have frequent\r\ninterviews with their officers, a good understanding with them, and\r\nam inclined to think, when the resources of their country are\r\nexhausted, we must employ them.  They are the best cavalry in the\r\nworld, but it will tax Mr. Chase's genius for finance to supply\r\nthem with horses.  At present horses cost them nothing; for they\r\ntake where they find, and don't bother their brains as to who is to\r\npay for them; the same may be said of the cornfields, which have,\r\nas they believe, been cultivated by a good-natured people for their\r\nspecial benefit.  We propose to share with them the free use of\r\nthese cornfields, planted by willing hands, that will never gather\r\nthe crops.\r\n\r\nNow that I have sketched the people who inhabit the district of\r\ncountry under consideration, I will proceed to discuss the future.\r\n\r\nA civil government now, for any part of it, would be simply\r\nridiculous.  The people would not regard it, and even the military\r\ncommanders of the antagonistic parties would treat it lightly.\r\nGovernors would be simply petitioners for military assistance, to\r\nprotect supposed friendly interests, and military commanders would\r\nrefuse to disperse and weaken their armies for military reasons.\r\nJealousies would arise between the two conflicting powers, and,\r\ninstead of contributing to the end of the war, would actually defer\r\nit.  Therefore, I contend that the interests of the United States,\r\nand of the real parties concerned, demand the continuance of the\r\nsimple military role, till after all the organized armies of the\r\nSouth are dispersed, conquered, and subjugated.\r\n\r\nThe people of all this region are represented in the Army of\r\nVirginia, at Charleston, Mobile, and Chattanooga.  They have sons\r\nand relations in each of the rebel armies, and naturally are\r\ninterested in their fate.  Though we hold military possession of\r\nthe key-points of their country, still they contend, and naturally,\r\nthat should Lee succeed in Virginia, or Bragg at Chattanooga, a\r\nchange will occur here also.  We cannot for this reason attempt to\r\nreconstruct parts of the South as we conquer it, till all idea of\r\nthe establishment of a Southern Confederacy is abandoned.  We\r\nshould avail ourselves of the present lull to secure the\r\nstrategical points that will give us an advantage in the future\r\nmilitary movements, and we should treat the idea of civil\r\ngovernment as one in which we as a nation have a minor or\r\nsubordinate interest.  The opportunity is good to impress on the\r\npopulation the truth that they are more interested in civil\r\ngovernment than we are; and that, to enjoy the protection of laws,\r\nthey most not be passive observers of events, but must aid and\r\nsustain the constituted authorities in enforcing the laws; they\r\nmust not only submit themselves, but should pay their share of\r\ntaxes, and render personal services when called on.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, in contemplating the history of the past two years,\r\nthat all the people of our country, North, South, East, and West,\r\nhave been undergoing a salutary political schooling, learning\r\nlessons which might have been acquired from the experience of other\r\npeople; but we had all become so wise in our own conceit that we\r\nwould only learn by actual experience of our own.  The people even\r\nof small and unimportant localities, North as well as South, had\r\nreasoned themselves into the belief that their opinions were\r\nsuperior to the aggregated interest of the whole nation.  Half our\r\nterritorial nation rebelled, on a doctrine of secession that they\r\nthemselves now scout; and a real numerical majority actually\r\nbelieved that a little State was endowed with such sovereignty that\r\nit could defeat the policy of the great whole.  I think the present\r\nwar has exploded that notion, and were this war to cease now, the\r\nexperience gained, though dear, would be worth the expense.\r\n\r\nAnother great and important natural truth is still in contest, and\r\ncan only be solved by war.  Numerical majorities by vote have been\r\nour great arbiter.  Heretofore all men have cheerfully submitted to\r\nit in questions left open, but numerical majorities are not\r\nnecessarily physical majorities.  The South, though numerically\r\ninferior, contend they can whip the Northern superiority of\r\nnumbers, and therefore by natural law they contend that they are\r\nnot bound to submit.  This issue is the only real one, and in my\r\njudgment all else should be deferred to it.  War alone can decide\r\nit, and it is the only question now left for us as a people to\r\ndecide.  Can we whip the South? If we can, our numerical majority\r\nhas both the natural and constitutional right to govern them.  If\r\nwe cannot whip them, they contend for the natural right to select\r\ntheir own government, and they have the argument.  Our armies must\r\nprevail over theirs; our officers, marshals, and courts, must\r\npenetrate into the innermost recesses of their land, before we have\r\nthe natural right to demand their submission.\r\n\r\nI would banish all minor questions, assert the broad doctrine that\r\nas a nation the United States has the right, and also the physical\r\npower, to penetrate to every part of our national domain, and that\r\nwe will do it--that we will do it in our own time and in our own\r\nway; that it makes no difference whether it be in one year, or two,\r\nor ten, or twenty; that we will remove and destroy every obstacle,\r\nif need be, take every life, every acre of land, every particle of\r\nproperty, every thing that to us seems proper; that we will not\r\ncease till the end is attained; that all who do not aid us are\r\nenemies, and that we will not account to them for our acts.  If the\r\npeople of the South oppose, they do so at their peril; and if they\r\nstand by, mere lookers-on in this domestic tragedy, they have no\r\nright to immunity, protection, or share in the final results.\r\n\r\nI even believe and contend further that, in the North, every member\r\nof the nation is bound by both natural and constitutional law to\r\n\"maintain and defend the Government against all its enemies and\r\nopposers whomsoever.\"  If they fail to do it they are derelict, and\r\ncan be punished, or deprived of all advantages arising from the\r\nlabors of those who do.  If any man, North or South, withholds his\r\nshare of taxes, or his physical assistance in this, the crisis of\r\nour history, he should be deprived of all voice in the future\r\nelections of this country, and might be banished, or reduced to the\r\ncondition of a mere denizen of the land.\r\n\r\nWar is upon us, none can deny it.  It is not the choice of the\r\nGovernment of the United States, but of a faction; the Government\r\nwas forced to accept the issue, or to submit to a degradation fatal\r\nand disgraceful to all the inhabitants.  In accepting war, it\r\nshould be \"pure and simple\" as applied to the belligerents.  I\r\nwould keep it so, till all traces of the war are effaced; till\r\nthose who appealed to it are sick and tired of it, and come to the\r\nemblem of our nation, and sue for peace.  I would not coax them, or\r\neven meet them half-way, but make them so sick of war that\r\ngenerations would pass away before they would again appeal to it.\r\n\r\nI know what I say when I repeat that the insurgents of the South\r\nsneer at all overtures looking to their interests.  They scorn the\r\nalliance with the Copperheads; they tell me to my face that they\r\nrespect Grant, McPherson, and our brave associates who fight\r\nmanfully and well for a principle, but despise the Copperheads and\r\nsneaks at the North, who profess friendship for the South and\r\nopposition to the war, as mere covers for their knavery and\r\npoltroonery.\r\n\r\nGod knows that I deplore this fratricidal war as much as any man\r\nliving, but it is upon us, a physical fact; and there is only one\r\nhonorable issue from it.  We must fight it out, army against army,\r\nand man against man; and I know, and you know, and civilians begin\r\nto realize the fact, that reconciliation and reconstruction will be\r\neasier through and by means of strong, well-equipped, and organized\r\narmies than through any species of conventions that can be framed.\r\nThe issues are made, and all discussion is out of place and\r\nridiculous.  The section of thirty-pounder Parrott rifles now\r\ndrilling before my tent is a more convincing argument than the\r\nlargest Democratic meeting the State of New York can possibly\r\nassemble at Albany; and a simple order of the War Department to\r\ndraft enough men to fill our skeleton regiments would be more\r\nconvincing as to our national perpetuity than an humble pardon to\r\nJeff.  Davis and all his misled host.\r\n\r\nThe only government needed or deserved by the States of Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, and Mississippi, now exists in Grant's army.  This needs,\r\nsimply, enough privates to fill its ranks; all else will follow in\r\ndue season.  This army has its well-defined code of laws and\r\npractice, and can adapt itself to the wants and necessities of a\r\ncity, the country, the rivers, the sea, indeed to all parts of this\r\nland.  It better subserves the interest and policy of the General\r\nGovernment, and the people here prefer it to any weak or servile\r\ncombination that would at once, from force of habit, revive sad\r\nperpetuate local prejudices and passions.  The people of this\r\ncountry have forfeited all right to a voice in the councils of the\r\nnation.  They know it and feel it, and in after-years they will be\r\nthe better citizens from the dear bought experience of the present\r\ncrisis.  Let them learn now, and learn it well, that good citizens\r\nmust obey as well as command.  Obedience to law, absolute--yea,\r\neven abject--is the lesson that this war, under Providence, will\r\nteach the free and enlightened American citizen.  As a nation, we\r\nshall be the better for it.\r\n\r\nI never have apprehended foreign interference in our family\r\nquarrel.  Of coarse, governments founded on a different and it may\r\nbe an antagonistic principle with ours naturally feel a pleasure at\r\nour complications, and, it may be, wish our downfall; but in the\r\nend England and France will join with us in jubilation at the\r\ntriumph of constitutional government over faction.  Even now the\r\nEnglish manifest this.  I do not profess to understand Napoleon's\r\ndesign in Mexico, and I do not, see that his taking military\r\npossession of Mexico concerns us.  We have as much territory now as\r\nwe want.  The Mexicans have failed in self-government, and it was a\r\nquestion as to what nation she should fall a prey.  That is now\r\nsolved, and I don't see that we are damaged.  We have the finest\r\npart of the North American Continent, all we can people and can\r\ntake care of; and, if we can suppress rebellion in our own land,\r\nand compose the strife generated by it, we shall have enough\r\npeople, resources, and wealth, if well combined, to defy\r\ninterference from any and every quarter.\r\n\r\nI therefore hope the Government of the United States will continue,\r\nas heretofore, to collect, in well-organized armies, the physical\r\nstrength of the nation; applying it, as heretofore, in asserting\r\nthe national authority; and in persevering, without relaxation, to\r\nthe end.  This, whether near or far off, is not for us to say; but,\r\nfortunately, we have no choice.  We must succeed--no other choice\r\nis left us except degradation.  The South must be ruled by us, or\r\nshe will rule us.  We must conquer them, or ourselves be conquered.\r\nThere is no middle course.  They ask, and will have, nothing else,\r\nand talk of compromise is bosh; for we know they would even scorn\r\nthe offer.\r\n\r\nI wish the war could have been deferred for twenty years, till the\r\nsuperabundant population of the North could flow in and replace the\r\nlosses sustained by war; but this could not be, and we are forced\r\nto take things as they are.\r\n\r\nAll therefore I can now venture to advise is to raise the draft to\r\nits maximum, fill the present regiments to as large a standard as\r\npossible, and push the war, pure and simple.  Great attention\r\nshould be paid to the discipline of our armies, for on them may be\r\nfounded the future stability of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the war is, of course, to be considered, but finances\r\nwill adjust themselves to the actual state of affairs; and, even if\r\nwe would, we could not change the cost.  Indeed, the larger the\r\ncost now, the less will it be in the end; for the end must be\r\nattained somehow, regardless of loss of life and treasure, and is\r\nmerely a question of time.\r\n\r\nExcuse so long a letter.  With great respect, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck, on receipt of this letter, telegraphed me that Mr.\r\nLincoln had read it carefully, and had instructed him to obtain my\r\nconsent to have it published.  At the time, I preferred not to be\r\ndrawn into any newspaper controversy, and so wrote to General\r\nHalleck; and the above letter has never been, to my knowledge,\r\npublished; though Mr. Lincoln more than once referred to it with\r\nmarks of approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS\r\nCAMP ON BIG BLACK, September 17, 1863\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General J. A. RAWLINS,\r\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General, Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: I inclose for your perusal, and for you to read to\r\nGeneral Grant such parts as you deem interesting, letters received\r\nby me from Prof. Mahan and General Halleck, with my answers.  After\r\nyou have read my answer to General Halleck, I beg you to inclose it\r\nto its address, and return me the others.\r\n\r\nI think Prof. Mahan's very marked encomium upon the campaign of\r\nVicksburg is so flattering to General Grant, that you may offer to\r\nlet him keep the letter, if he values such a testimonial.  I have\r\nnever written a word to General Halleck since my report of last\r\nDecember, after the affair at Chickasaw, except a short letter a\r\nfew days ago, thanking him for the kind manner of his transmitting\r\nto me the appointment of brigadier-general.  I know that in\r\nWashington I am incomprehensible, because at the outset of the war\r\nI would not go it blind and rush headlong into a war unprepared and\r\nwith an utter ignorance of its extent and purpose.  I was then\r\nconstrued unsound; and now that I insist on war pure and simple,\r\nwith no admixture of civil compromises, I am supposed vindictive.\r\nYou remember what Polonius said to his son Laertes: \"Beware of\r\nentrance to a quarrel; but, being in, bear it, that the opposed may\r\nbeware of thee.\"  What is true of the single man, is equally true\r\nof a nation.  Our leaders seemed at first to thirst for the\r\nquarrel, willing, even anxious, to array against us all possible\r\nelements of opposition; and now, being in, they would hasten to\r\nquit long before the \"opposed\" has received that lesson which he\r\nneeds.  I would make this war as severe as possible, and show no\r\nsymptoms of tiring till the South begs for mercy; indeed, I know,\r\nand you know, that the end would be reached quicker by such a\r\ncourse than by any seeming yielding on our part.  I don't want our\r\nGovernment to be bothered by patching up local governments, or by\r\ntrying to reconcile any class of men.  The South has done her\r\nworst, and now is the time for us to pile on our blows thick and\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nInstead of postponing the draft till after the elections, we ought\r\nnow to have our ranks full of drafted men; and, at best, if they\r\ncome at all, they will reach us when we should be in motion.\r\n\r\nI think General Halleck would like to have the honest, candid\r\nopinions of all of us, viz., Grant, McPherson, and Sherman.  I have\r\ngiven mine, and would prefer, of course, that it should coincide\r\nwith the others.  Still, no matter what my opinion may be, I can\r\neasily adapt my conduct to the plane of others, and am only too\r\nhappy when I find theirs better, than mine.\r\n\r\nIf no trouble, please show Halleck's letter to McPherson, and ask\r\nhim to write also.  I know his regiments are like mine (mere\r\nsquads), and need filling up.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCHATTANOOGA AND KNOXVILLE.\r\n\r\nJULY TO DECEMBER, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Vicksburg, and its corollary, Port Hudson, the\r\nMississippi River was wholly in the possession of the Union forces,\r\nand formed a perfect line of separation in the territories of our\r\nopponents.  Thenceforth, they could not cross it save by stealth,\r\nand the military affairs on its west bank became unimportant.\r\nGrant's army had seemingly completed its share of the work of war,\r\nand lay, as it were, idle for a time.  In person General Grant went\r\nto New Orleans to confer with General Banks, and his victorious\r\narmy was somewhat dispersed.  Parke's corps (Ninth) returned to\r\nKentucky, and afterward formed part of the Army of the Ohio, under\r\nGeneral Burnside; Ord's corps (Thirteenth) was sent down to\r\nNatchez, and gradually drifted to New Orleans and Texas; McPhersons\r\n(Seventeenth) remained in and near Vicksburg; Hurlbut's (Sixteenth)\r\nwas at Memphis; and mine (Fifteenth) was encamped along the Big\r\nBlack, about twenty miles east of Vicksburg.  This corps was\r\ncomposed of four divisions: Steele's (the First) was posted at and\r\nnear the railroad-bridge; Blair's (the Second), next in order, near\r\nParson Fox's; the Third Division (Tuttle's) was on the ridge about\r\nthe head of Bear Creek; and the Fourth (Ewing's) was at Messinger's\r\nFord.  My own headquarters were in tents in a fine grove of old\r\noaks near Parson Fox's house, and the battalion of the Thirteenth\r\nRegulars was the headquarters guard.\r\n\r\nAll the camps were arranged for health, comfort, rest, and drill.\r\nIt being midsummer, we did not expect any change till the autumn\r\nmonths, and accordingly made ourselves as comfortable as possible.\r\nThere was a short railroad in operation from Vicksburg to the\r\nbridge across the Big Black, whence supplies in abundance were\r\nhauled to our respective camps.  With a knowledge of this fact Mrs.\r\nSherman came down from Ohio with Minnie, Lizzie, Willie, and Tom,\r\nto pay us a visit in our camp at Parson Fog's.  Willie was then\r\nnine years old, was well advanced for his years, and took the most\r\nintense interest in the affairs of the army.  He was a great\r\nfavorite with the soldiers, and used to ride with me on horseback\r\nin the numerous drills and reviews of the time.  He then had the\r\npromise of as long a life as any of my children, and displayed more\r\ninterest in the war than any of them.  He was called a \"sergeant\"\r\nin the regular battalion, learned the manual of arms, and regularly\r\nattended the parade and guard-mounting of the Thirteenth, back of\r\nmy camp.  We made frequent visits to Vicksburg, and always stopped\r\nwith General McPherson, who had a large house, and boarded with a\r\nfamily (Mrs. Edwards's) in which were several interesting young\r\nladies.  General Grant occupied another house (Mrs. Lum's) in\r\nVicksburg during that summer, and also had his family with him.\r\nThe time passed very agreeably, diversified only by little events\r\nof not much significance, among which I will recount only one.\r\n\r\nWhile, we occupied the west bank of the Big Black, the east bank\r\nwas watched by a rebel cavalry-division, commanded by General\r\nArmstrong.  He had four brigades, commanded by Generals Whitfield,\r\nStark, Cosby, and Wirt Adams.  Quite frequently they communicated\r\nwith us by flags of truce on trivial matters, and we reciprocated;\r\nmerely to observe them.  One day a flag of truce, borne by a\r\nCaptain B...., of Louisville, Kentucky, escorted by about\r\ntwenty-five men, was reported at Messinger's Ferry, and I sent\r\norders to let them come right into my tent.  This brought them\r\nthrough the camps of the Fourth Division, and part of the Second;\r\nand as they drew up in front of my tent, I invited Captain B....\r\nand another officer with him (a major from Mobile) to dismount, to\r\nenter my tent, and to make themselves at home.  Their escort was\r\nsent to join mine, with orders to furnish them forage and every\r\nthing they wanted.  B....  had brought a sealed letter for General\r\nGrant at Vicksburg, which was dispatched to him.  In the evening we\r\nhad a good supper, with wine and cigars, and, as we sat talking,\r\nB....  spoke of his father and mother, in Louisville, got leave to\r\nwrite them a long letter without its being read by any one, and\r\nthen we talked about the war.  He said: \"What is the use of your\r\npersevering? It is simply impossible to subdue eight millions of\r\npeople;\" asserting that \"the feeling in the South had become so\r\nembittered that a reconciliation was impossible.\"  I answered that,\r\n\"sitting as we then were, we appeared very comfortable, and surely\r\nthere was no trouble in our becoming friends.\"  \"Yes,\" said he,\r\n\"that is very true of us, but we are gentlemen of education, and\r\ncan easily adapt ourselves to any condition of things; but this\r\nwould not apply equally well to the common people, or to the common\r\nsoldiers.\"  I took him out to the camp-fires behind the tent, and\r\nthere were the men of his escort and mine mingled together,\r\ndrinking their coffee, and happy as soldiers always seem.  I asked\r\nB....  what he thought of that, and he admitted that I had the best\r\nof the argument.  Before I dismissed this flag of truce, his\r\ncompanion consulted me confidentially as to what disposition he\r\nought to make of his family, then in Mobile, and I frankly gave him\r\nthe best advice I could.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus lying idle in camp on the big Black, the Army of\r\nthe Cumberland, under General Rosecrans, was moving against Bragg\r\nat Chattanooga; and the Army of the Ohio, General Burnside, was\r\nmarching toward East Tennessee.  General Rosecrans was so confident\r\nof success that he somewhat scattered his command, seemingly to\r\nsurround and capture Bragg in Chattanooga; but the latter,\r\nreenforced from Virginia, drew out of Chattanooga, concentrated his\r\narmy at Lafayette, and at Chickamauga fell on Rosecrans, defeated\r\nhim, and drove him into Chattanooga.  The whole country seemed\r\nparalyzed by this unhappy event; and the authorities in Washington\r\nwere thoroughly stampeded.  From the East the Eleventh Corps\r\n(Slocum), and the Twelfth Corps (Howard), were sent by rail to\r\nNashville, and forward under command of General Hooker; orders were\r\nalso sent to General Grant, by Halleck, to send what reenforcements\r\nhe could spare immediately toward Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nBragg had completely driven Rosecrans's army into Chattanooga; the\r\nlatter was in actual danger of starvation, and the railroad to his\r\nrear seemed inadequate to his supply.  The first intimation which I\r\ngot of this disaster was on the 22d of September, by an order from\r\nGeneral Grant to dispatch one of my divisions immediately into\r\nVicksburg, to go toward Chattanooga, and I designated the First,\r\nGeneral Osterhaus--Steele meantime having been appointed to the\r\ncommand of the Department of Arkansas, and had gone to Little Rock.\r\nGeneral Osterhaus marched the same day, and on the 23d I was\r\nsummoned to Vicksburg in person, where General Grant showed me the\r\nalarming dispatches from General Halleck, which had been sent from\r\nMemphis by General Hurlbut, and said, on further thought, that he\r\nwould send me and my whole corps.  But, inasmuch as one division of\r\nMcPherson's corps (John E. Smith's) had already started, he\r\ninstructed me to leave one of my divisions on the Big Black, and to\r\nget the other two ready to follow at once.  I designated the\r\nSecond, then commanded by Brigadier-General Giles A. Smith, and the\r\nFourth, commanded by Brigadier-General Corse.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th I returned to my camp on Big Black, gave all the\r\nnecessary orders for these divisions to move, and for the Third\r\n(Tittle's) to remain, and went into Vicksburg with my family.  The\r\nlast of my corps designed for this expedition started from camp on\r\nthe 27th, reached Vicksburg the 28th, and were embarked on boats\r\nprovided for them.  General Halleck's dispatches dwelt upon the\r\nfact that General Rosecrans's routes of supply were overtaxed, and\r\nthat we should move from Memphis eastward, repairing railroads as\r\nwe progressed, as far as Athens, Alabama, whence I was to report to\r\nGeneral Rosecrans, at Chattanooga, by letter.\r\n\r\nI took passage for myself and family in the steamer Atlantic,\r\nCaptain Henry McDougall.  When the boat was ready to start, Willie\r\nwas missing.  Mrs. Sherman supposed him to have been with me,\r\nwhereas I supposed he was with her.  An officer of the Thirteenth\r\nwent up to General McPherson's house for him, and soon returned,\r\nwith Captain Clift leading him, carrying in his hands a small\r\ndouble-barreled shot gun; and I joked him about carrying away\r\ncaptured property.  In a short time we got off.  As we all stood on\r\nthe guards to look at our old camps at Young's Point, I remarked\r\nthat Willie was not well, and he admitted that he was sick.  His\r\nmother put him to bed, and consulted Dr. Roler, of the Fifty-fifth\r\nIllinois, who found symptoms of typhoid fever.  The river was low;\r\nwe made slow progress till above Helena; and, as we approached\r\nMemphis, Dr. Roler told me that Willie's life was in danger, and he\r\nwas extremely anxious to reach Memphis for certain medicines and\r\nfor consultation.  We arrived at Memphis on the 2d of October,\r\ncarried Willie up to the Gayoso Hotel, and got the most experienced\r\nphysician there, who acted with Dr. Roler, but he sank rapidly, and\r\ndied the evening of the 3d of October.  The blow was a terrible one\r\nto us all, so sudden and so unexpected, that I could not help\r\nreproaching myself for having consented to his visit in that sickly\r\nregion in the summer-time.  Of all my children, he seemed the most\r\nprecious.  Born in San Francisco, I had watched with intense\r\ninterest his development, and he seemed more than any of the\r\nchildren to take an interest in my special profession.  Mrs.\r\nSherman, Minnie, Lizzie, and Tom, were with him at the time, and we\r\nall, helpless and overwhelmed, saw him die.  Being in the very\r\nmidst of an important military enterprise, I had hardly time to\r\npause and think of my personal loss.  We procured a metallic\r\ncasket, and had a military funeral, the battalion of the Thirteenth\r\nUnited States Regulars acting as escort from the Gayoso Hotel to\r\nthe steamboat Grey Eagle, which conveyed him and my family up to\r\nCairo, whence they proceeded to our home at Lancaster, Ohio, where\r\nhe was buried.  I here give my letter to Captain C. C. Smith, who\r\ncommanded the battalion at the time, as exhibiting our intense\r\nfeelings:\r\n\r\nGAYOSO HOUSE, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE\r\nOctober 4, 1863, Midnight\r\n\r\nCaptain C. C. SMITH, commanding Battalion Thirteenth United States\r\nRegulars.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND: I cannot sleep to-night till I record an expression\r\nof the deep feelings of my heart to you, and to the officers and\r\nsoldiers of the battalion, for their kind behavior to my poor\r\nchild.  I realize that you all feel for my family the attachment of\r\nkindred, and I assure you of full reciprocity.  Consistent with a\r\nsense of duty to my profession and office, I could not leave my\r\npost, and sent for the family to come to me in that fatal climate,\r\nand in that sickly period of the year, and behold the result!  The\r\nchild that bore my name, and in whose future I reposed with more\r\nconfidence than I did in my own plan of life, now floats a mere\r\ncorpse, seeking a grave in a distant land, with a weeping mother,\r\nbrother, and sisters, clustered about him.  For myself, I ask no\r\nsympathy.  On, on I must go, to meet a soldier's fate, or live to\r\nsee our country rise superior to all factions, till its flag is\r\nadored and respected by ourselves and by all the powers of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nBut Willie was, or thought he was, a sergeant in the Thirteenth.  I\r\nhave seen his eye brighten, his heart beat, as he beheld the\r\nbattalion under arms, and asked me if they were not real soldiers.\r\nChild as he was, he had the enthusiasm, the pure love of truth,\r\nhonor, and love of country, which should animate all soldiers.\r\n\r\nGod only knows why he should die thus young.  He is dead, but will\r\nnot be forgotten till those who knew him in life have followed him\r\nto that same mysterious end.\r\n\r\nPlease convey to the battalion my heart-felt thanks, and assure\r\neach and all that if in after-years they call on me or mine, and\r\nmention that they were of the Thirteenth Regulars when Willie was a\r\nsergeant, they will have a key to the affections of my family that\r\nwill open all it has; that we will share with them our last\r\nblanket, our last crust!  Your friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-general.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong afterward, in the spring of 1867, we had his body disinterred\r\nand brought to St. Louis, where he is now buried in a beautiful\r\nspot, in Calvary Cemetery, by the side of another child, \"Charles,\"\r\nwho was born at Lancaster, in the summer of 1864, died early, and\r\nwas buried at Notre Dame, Indiana.  His body was transferred at the\r\nsame time to the same spot.  Over Willie's grave is erected a\r\nbeautiful marble monument, designed and executed by the officers\r\nand soldiers, of that battalion which claimed him as a sergeant and\r\ncomrade.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and fall of 1863 Major-General S. A. Hurlbut was\r\nin command at Memphis.  He supplied me copies of all dispatches\r\nfrom Washington, and all the information he possessed of the events\r\nabout Chattanooga.  Two of these dispatches cover all essential\r\npoints:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, September 15, 1863--5 p.m.\r\n\r\nMajor-General S. A. HURLBUT, Memphis:\r\n\r\nAll the troops that can possibly be spared in West Tennessee and on\r\nthe Mississippi River should be sent without delay to assist\r\nGeneral Rosecrans on the Tennessee River.\r\n\r\nUrge Sherman to act with all possible promptness.\r\n\r\nIf you have boats, send them down to bring up his troops.\r\n\r\nInformation just received indicates that a part of Lee's army has\r\nbeen sent to reenforce Bragg.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, September 19, 1868--4 p.m.\r\n\r\nMajor-General S. A. HURLBUT, Memphis, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nGive me definite information of the number of troops sent toward\r\nDecatur, and where they are.  Also, what other troops are to\r\nfollow, and when.\r\n\r\nHas any thing been heard from the troops ordered from Vicksburg?\r\n\r\nNo efforts must be spared to support Rosecrans's right, and to\r\nguard the crossings of the Tennessee River.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy special orders were to repair the Memphis & Charleston Railroad\r\neastward as I progressed, as far as Athens, Alabama, to draw\r\nsupplies by that route, so that, on reaching Athens, we should not\r\nbe dependent on the roads back to Nashville, already overtaxed by\r\nthe demand of Rosecrans's army.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Memphis, October 2d, I found that Osterhaus's division\r\nhad already gone by rail as far as Corinth, and than John E.\r\nSmith's division was in the act of starting by cars.  The Second\r\nDivision, then commanded by Brigadier-General Giles A. Smith,\r\nreached Memphis at the same time with me; and the Fourth Division,\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General John M. Corse, arrived a day or two\r\nafter.  The railroad was in fair condition as far as Corinth,\r\nninety-six miles, but the road was badly stocked with locomotives\r\nand cars, so that it took until the 9th to get off the Second\r\nDivision, when I gave orders for the Fourth Division and\r\nwagon-trains to march by the common road.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, October 11th, with a special train loaded with\r\nour orderlies and clerks, the horses of our staff, the battalion of\r\nthe Thirteenth United States Regulars, and a few officers going\r\nforward to join their commands, among them Brigadier-General Hugh\r\nEwing, I started for Corinth.\r\n\r\nAt Germantown, eight miles, we passed Corse's division (Fourth) on\r\nthe march, and about noon the train ran by the depot at\r\nColliersville, twenty-six miles out.  I was in the rear car with my\r\nstaff, dozing, but observed the train slacking speed and stopping\r\nabout half a mile beyond the depot.  I noticed some soldiers\r\nrunning to and fro, got out at the end of the car, and soon Colonel\r\nAnthony (Sixty-sixth Indiana), who commanded the post, rode up and\r\nsaid that his pickets had just been driven in, and there was an\r\nappearance of an attack by a large force of cavalry coming from the\r\nsoutheast.  I ordered the men to get off the train, to form on the\r\nknoll near the railroad-cut, and soon observed a rebel officer\r\nriding toward us with a white flag.  Colonel Anthony and Colonel\r\nDayton (one of my aides) were sent to meet him, and to keep him in\r\nconversation as long as possible.  They soon returned, saying it\r\nwas the adjutant of the rebel general Chalmers, who demanded the\r\nsurrender of the place.  I instructed them to return and give a\r\nnegative answer, but to delay him as much as possible, so as to\r\ngive us time for preparation.  I saw Anthony, Dayton, and the rebel\r\nbearer of the flag, in conversation, and the latter turn his horse\r\nto ride back, when I ordered Colonel McCoy to run to the station,\r\nand get a message over the wires as quick as possible to Memphis\r\nand Germantown, to hurry forward Corse's division.  I then ordered\r\nthe train to back to the depot, and drew back the battalion of\r\nregulars to the small earth redoubt near it.  The depot-building\r\nwas of brick, and had been punctured with loop-holes.  To its east,\r\nabout two hundred yards, was a small square earthwork or fort, into\r\nwhich were put a part of the regulars along with the company of the\r\nSixty-sixth Indiana already there.  The rest of the men were\r\ndistributed into the railroad-cut, and in some shallow\r\nrifle-trenches near the depot.  We had hardly made these\r\npreparations when the enemy was seen forming in a long line on the\r\nridge to the south, about four hundred yards off, and soon after two\r\nparties of cavalry passed the railroad on both sides of us, cutting\r\nthe wires and tearing up some rails.  Soon they opened on us with\r\nartillery (of which we had none), and their men were dismounting and\r\npreparing to assault.  To the south of us was an extensive\r\ncornfield, with the corn still standing, and on the other side was\r\nthe town of Colliersville.  All the houses near, that could give\r\nshelter to the enemy, were ordered to be set on fire, and the men\r\nwere instructed to keep well under cover and to reserve their fire\r\nfor the assault, which seemed inevitable.  A long line of rebel\r\nskirmishers came down through the cornfield, and two other parties\r\napproached us along the railroad on both sides.  In the fort was a\r\nsmall magazine containing some cartridges.  Lieutenant James, a\r\nfine, gallant fellow, who was ordnance-officer on my staff, asked\r\nleave to arm the orderlies and clerks with some muskets which he had\r\nfound in the depot, to which I consented; he marched them into the\r\nmagazine, issued cartridges, and marched back to the depot to assist\r\nin its defense.  Afterward he came to me, said a party of the enemy\r\nhad got into the woods near the depot, and was annoying him, and he\r\nwanted to charge and drive it away.  I advised him to be extremely\r\ncautious, as our enemy vastly outnumbered us, and had every\r\nadvantage in position and artillery; but instructed him, if they got\r\ntoo near, he might make a sally.  Soon after, I heard a rapid fire\r\nin that quarter, and Lieutenant.  James was brought in on a\r\nstretcher, with a ball through his breast, which I supposed to be\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\n[After the fight we sent him back to Memphis, where his mother and\r\nfather came from their home on the North River to nurse him.  Young\r\nJames was recovering from his wound, but was afterward killed by a\r\nfall from his horse, near his home, when riding with the daughters\r\nof Mr. Hamilton Fish, now Secretary of State.]\r\n\r\nThe enemy closed down on us several times, and got possession of\r\nthe rear of our train, from which they succeeded in getting five of\r\nour horses, among them my favorite mare Dolly; but our men were\r\ncool and practised shots (with great experience acquired at\r\nVicksburg), and drove them back.  With their artillery they knocked\r\nto pieces our locomotive and several of the cars, and set fire to\r\nthe train; but we managed to get possession again, and extinguished\r\nthe fire.  Colonel Audenreid, aide-de-camp, was provoked to find\r\nthat his valise of nice shirts had been used to kindle the fire.\r\nThe fighting continued all round us for three or four hours, when\r\nwe observed signs of drawing off, which I attributed to the\r\nrightful cause, the rapid approach of Corse's division, which\r\narrived about dark, having marched the whole distance from Memphis,\r\ntwenty-six miles, on the double-quick.  The next day we repaired\r\ndamages to the railroad and locomotive, and went on to Corinth.\r\n\r\nAt Corinth, on the 16th, I received the following important\r\ndispatches:\r\n\r\nMEMPHIS, October 14, 1863--11 A.M.\r\n\r\nArrived this morning.  Will be off in a few hours.  My orders are\r\nonly to go to Cairo, and report from there by telegraph.  McPherson\r\nwill be in Canton to-day.  He will remain there until Sunday or\r\nMonday next, and reconnoitre as far eastward as possible with\r\ncavalry, in the mean time.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 14, 1863--1 p.m.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, Corinth\r\n\r\nYours of the 10th is received.  The important matter to be attended\r\nto is that of supplies.  When Eastport can be reached by boats, the\r\nuse of the railroad can be dispensed with; but until that time it\r\nmust be guarded as far as need.  The Kentucky Railroad can barely\r\nsupply General Rosecrans.  All these matters must be left to your\r\njudgment as circumstances may arise.  Should the enemy be so strong\r\nas to prevent your going to Athena, or connecting with General\r\nRosecrans, you will nevertheless have assisted him greatly by\r\ndrawing away a part of the enemy's forces.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, with my staff and a small escort, I rode forward to\r\nBurnsville, and on the 19th to Iuka, where, on the next day, I was\r\nmost agreeably surprised to hear of the arrival at Eastport (only\r\nten miles off) of two gunboats, under the command of Captain\r\nPhelps, which had been sent up the Tennessee River by Admiral\r\nPorter, to help us.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that, to reach Athens and to communicate with General\r\nRosecrans, we should have to take the route north of the Tennessee\r\nRiver, on the 24th I ordered the Fourth Division to cross at\r\nEastport with the aid of the gunboats, and to move to Florence.\r\nAbout the same time, I received the general orders assigning\r\nGeneral Grant to command the Military Division of the Mississippi,\r\nauthorizing him, on reaching Chattanooga, to supersede General\r\nRosecrans by General George H. Thomas, with other and complete\r\nauthority, as set, forth in the following letters of General\r\nHalleck, which were sent to me by General Grant; and the same\r\norders devolved on me the command of the Department and Army of the\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., October 16, 1863\r\n\r\nMajor-General U. S. GRANT, Louisville.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: You will receive herewith the orders of the President of\r\nthe United States, placing you in command of the Departments of the\r\nOhio, Cumberland, and Tennessee.  The organization of these\r\ndepartments will be changed as you may deem most practicable.  You\r\nwill immediately proceed to Chattanooga, and relieve General\r\nRosecrans.  You can communicate with Generals Burnside and Sherman\r\nby telegraph.  A summary of the orders sent to these officers will\r\nbe sent to you immediately.  It is left optional with you to\r\nsupersede General Rosecrans by General G. H. Thomas or not.  Any\r\nother changes will be made on your request by telegram.\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects requiring your attention is the supply of\r\nyour armies.  Another is the security of the passes in the Georgia\r\nmountains, to shut out the enemy from Tennessee and Kentucky.  You\r\nwill consult with General Meigs and Colonel Scott in regard to\r\ntransportation and supplies.\r\n\r\nShould circumstances permit, I will visit you personally in a few\r\ndays for consultation.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., October 20, 1868.\r\n\r\nMajor-General GRANT, Louisville.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: In compliance with my promise, I now proceed to give you\r\na brief statement of the objects aimed at by General Rosecrans and\r\nGeneral Burnside's movement into East Tennessee, and of the\r\nmeasures directed to be taken to attain these objects.\r\n\r\nIt has been the constant desire of the government, from the\r\nbeginning of the war, to rescue the loyal inhabitants of East\r\nTennessee from the hands of the rebels, who fully appreciated the\r\nimportance of continuing their hold upon that country.  In addition\r\nto the large amount of agricultural products drawn from the upper\r\nvalley of the Tennessee, they also obtained iron and other\r\nmaterials from the vicinity of Chattanooga.  The possession of East\r\nTennessee would cut off one of their most important railroad\r\ncommunications, and threaten their manufactories at Rome, Atlanta,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWhen General Buell was ordered into East Tennessee in the summer of\r\n1882, Chattanooga was comparatively unprotected; but Bragg reached\r\nthere before Buell, and, by threatening his communications, forced\r\nhim to retreat on Nashville and Louisville.  Again, after the\r\nbattle of Perryville, General Buell was urged to pursue Bragg's\r\ndefeated army, and drive it from East Tennessee.  The same was\r\nurged upon his successor, but the lateness of the season or other\r\ncauses prevented further operations after the battle of Stone\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nLast spring, when your movements on the Mississippi River had drawn\r\nout of Tennessee a large force of the enemy, I again urged General\r\nRosecrans to take advantage of that opportunity to carry out his\r\nprojected plan of campaign, General Burnside being ready to\r\ncooperate, with a diminished but still efficient force.  But he\r\ncould not be persuaded to act in time, preferring to lie still till\r\nyour campaign should be terminated.  I represented to him, but\r\nwithout avail, that by this delay Johnston might be able to\r\nreenforce Bragg with the troops then operating against you.\r\n\r\nWhen General Rosecrans finally determined to advance, he was\r\nallowed to select his own lines and plans for carrying out the\r\nobjects of the expedition.  He was directed, however, to report his\r\nmovements daily, till he crossed the Tennessee, and to connect his\r\nleft, so far as possible, with General Burnside's right.  General\r\nBurnside was directed to move simultaneously, connecting his right,\r\nas far as possible, with General Rosecrans's left so that, if the\r\nenemy concentrated upon either army, the other could move to its\r\nassistance.  When General Burnside reached Kingston and Knoxville,\r\nand found no considerable number of the enemy in East Tennessee, he\r\nwas instructed to move down the river and cooperate with General\r\nRosecrans.\r\n\r\nThese instructions were repeated some fifteen times, but were not\r\ncarried out, General Burnside alleging as an excuse that he\r\nbelieved that Bragg was in retreat, and that General Rosecrans\r\nneeded no reenforcements.  When the latter had gained possession of\r\nChattanooga he was directed not to move on Rome as he proposed, but\r\nsimply to hold the mountain-passes, so as to prevent the ingress of\r\nthe rebels into East Tennessee.  That object accomplished, I\r\nconsidered the campaign as ended, at least for the present.  Future\r\noperations would depend upon the ascertained strength and;\r\nmovements of the enemy.  In other words, the main objects of the\r\ncampaign were the restoration of East Tennessee to the Union, and\r\nby holding the two extremities of the valley to secure it from\r\nrebel invasion.\r\n\r\nThe moment I received reliable information of the departure of\r\nLongstreet's corps from the Army of the Potomac, I ordered forward\r\nto General Rosecrans every available man in the Department of the\r\nOhio, and again urged General Burnside to move to his assistance.\r\nI also telegraphed to Generals Hurlbut, Sherman, and yourself, to\r\nsend forward all available troops in your department.  If these\r\nforces had been sent to General Rosecrans by Nashville, they could\r\nnot have been supplied; I therefore directed them to move by\r\nCorinth and the Tennessee River.  The necessity of this has been\r\nproved by the fact that the reinforcements sent to him from the\r\nArmy of the Potomac have not been able, for the want of railroad\r\ntransportation, to reach General Rosecrans's army in the field.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the relative strength of the opposing armies, it is\r\nbelieved that General Rosecrans when he first moved against Bragg\r\nhad double, if not treble, his force.  General Burnside, also, had\r\nmore than double the force of Buckner; and, even when Bragg and\r\nBuckner united, Rosecrans's army was very greatly superior in\r\nnumber.  Even the eighteen thousand men sent from Virginia, under\r\nLongstreet, would not have given the enemy the superiority.  It is\r\nnow ascertained that the greater part of the prisoners parolled by\r\nyou at Vicksburg, and General Banks at Port Hudson, were illegally\r\nand improperly declared exchanged, and forced into the ranks to\r\nswell the rebel numbers at Chickamauga.  This outrageous act, in\r\nviolation of the laws of war, of the cartel entered into by the\r\nrebel authorities, and of all sense of honor, gives us a useful\r\nlesson in regard to the character of the enemy with whom we are\r\ncontending.  He neither regards the rules of civilized warfare, nor\r\neven his most solemn engagements.  You may, therefore, expect to\r\nmeet in arms thousands of unexchanged prisoners released by you and\r\nothers on parole, not to serve again till duly exchanged.\r\n\r\nAlthough the enemy by this disgraceful means has been able to\r\nconcentrate in Georgia and Alabama a much larger force than we\r\nanticipated, your armies will be abundantly able to defeat him.\r\nYour difficulty will not be in the want of men, but in the means of\r\nsupplying them at this season of the year.  A single-track railroad\r\ncan supply an army of sixty or seventy thousand men, with the usual\r\nnumber of cavalry and artillery; but beyond that number, or with a\r\nlarge mounted force, the difficulty of supply is very great.\r\n\r\nI do not know the present condition of the road from Nashville to\r\nDecatur, but, if practicable to repair it, the use of that triangle\r\nwill be of great assistance to you.  I hope, also, that the recent\r\nrise of water in the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers will enable\r\nyou to employ water transportation to Nashville, Eastport, or\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nIf you reoccupy the passes of Lookout Mountain, which should never\r\nhave been given up, you will be able to use the railroad and river\r\nfrom Bridgeport to Chattanooga.  This seems to me a matter of vital\r\nimportance, and should receive your early attention.\r\n\r\nI submit this summary in the hope that it will assist you in fully\r\nunderstanding the objects of the campaign, and the means of\r\nattaining these objects.  Probably the Secretary of War, in his\r\ninterviews with you at Louisville, has gone over the same ground.\r\nWhatever measures you may deem proper to adopt under existing\r\ncircumstances, you will receive all possible assistance from the\r\nauthorities at Washington.  You have never, heretofore, complained\r\nthat such assistance has not been afforded you in your operations,\r\nand I think you will have no cause of complaint in your present\r\ncampaign.  Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Frank P. Blair, who was then ahead with the two divisions\r\nof Osterhaus and John E. Smith, was temporarily assigned to the\r\ncommand of the Fifteenth Corps.  General Hurlbut remained at\r\nMemphis in command of the Sixteenth Corps, and General McPherson at\r\nVicksburg with the Seventeenth.  These three corps made up the Army\r\nof the Tennessee.  I was still busy in pushing forward the repairs\r\nto the railroad bridge at Bear Creek, and in patching up the many\r\nbreaks between it and Tuscumbia, when on the 27th of October, as I\r\nsat on the porch of a house, I was approached by a dirty,\r\nblack-haired individual with mixed dress and strange demeanor, who\r\ninquired for me, and, on being assured that I was in fact the man,\r\nhe handed me a letter from General Blair at Tuscumbia, and another\r\nshort one, which was a telegraph-message from General Grant at\r\nChattanooga, addressed to me through General George Crook,\r\ncommanding at Huntsville, Alabama, to this effect:\r\n\r\nDrop all work on Memphis & Charleston Railroad, cross the Tennessee\r\nand hurry eastward with all possible dispatch toward Bridgeport,\r\ntill you meet further orders from me.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this message was Corporal Pike, who described to me,\r\nin his peculiar way, that General Crook had sent him in a canoe;\r\nthat he had paddled down the Tennessee River, over Muscle Shoals,\r\nwas fired at all the way by guerrillas, but on reaching Tuscumbia\r\nhe had providentially found it in possession of our troops.  He had\r\nreported to General Blair, who sent him on to me at Iuka.  This\r\nPike proved to be a singular character; his manner attracted my\r\nnotice at once, and I got him a horse, and had him travel with us\r\neastward to about Elkton, whence I sent him back to General Crook\r\nat Huntsville; but told him, if I could ever do him a personal\r\nservice, he might apply to me.  The next spring when I was in\r\nChattanooga, preparing for the Atlanta campaign, Corporal Pike made\r\nhis appearance and asked a fulfillment of my promise.  I inquired\r\nwhat he wanted, and he said he wanted to do something bold,\r\nsomething that would make him a hero.  I explained to him, that we\r\nwere getting ready to go for Joe Johnston at Dalton, that I\r\nexpected to be in the neighborhood of Atlanta about the 4th of\r\nJuly, and wanted the bridge across the Savannah River at Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, to be burnt about that time, to produce alarm and\r\nconfusion behind the rebel army.  I explained to Pike that the\r\nchances were three to one that he would be caught and hanged; but\r\nthe greater the danger the greater seemed to be his desire to\r\nattempt it.  I told him to select a companion, to disguise himself\r\nas an East Tennessee refugee, work his way over the mountains into\r\nNorth Carolina, and at the time appointed to float down the\r\nSavannah River and burn that bridge.  In a few days he had made his\r\npreparations and took his departure.  The bridge was not burnt, and\r\nI supposed that Pike had been caught and hanged.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Columbia, South Carolina, in February, 1865, just\r\nas we were leaving the town, in passing near the asylum, I heard my\r\nname called, and saw a very dirty fellow followed by a file of men\r\nrunning toward me, and as they got near I recognized Pike.  He\r\ncalled to me to identify him as one of my men; he was then a\r\nprisoner under guard, and I instructed the guard to bring him that\r\nnight to my camp some fifteen miles up the road, which was done.\r\nPike gave me a graphic narrative of his adventures, which would\r\nhave filled a volume; told me how he had made two attempts to burn\r\nthe bridge, and failed; and said that at the time of our entering\r\nColumbia he was a prisoner in the hands of the rebels, under trial\r\nfor his life, but in the confusion of their retreat he made his\r\nescape and got into our lines, where he was again made a prisoner\r\nby our troops because of his looks.  Pike got some clothes, cleaned\r\nup, and I used him afterward to communicate with Wilmington, North\r\nCarolina.  Some time after the war, he was appointed a lieutenant\r\nof the Regular, Cavalry, and was killed in Oregon, by the\r\naccidental discharge of a pistol.  Just before his death he wrote\r\nme, saying that he was tired of the monotony of garrison-life, and\r\nwanted to turn Indian, join the Cheyennes on the Plains, who were\r\nthen giving us great trouble, and, after he had gained their\r\nconfidence, he would betray them into our hands.  Of course I wrote\r\nhim that he must try and settle down and become a gentleman as well\r\nas an officer, apply himself to his duties, and forget the wild\r\ndesires of his nature, which were well enough in time of war, but\r\nnot suited to his new condition as an officer; but, poor fellow!\r\nhe was killed by an accident, which probably saved him from a\r\nslower but harder fate.\r\n\r\nAt Iuka I issued all the orders to McPherson and Hurlbut necessary\r\nfor the Department of the Tennessee during my absence, and,\r\nfurther, ordered the collection of a force out of the Sixteenth\r\nCorps, of about eight thousand men, to be commanded by General G.\r\nM. Dodge, with orders to follow as far east as Athens, Tennessee,\r\nthere to await instructions.  We instantly discontinued all\r\nattempts to repair the Charleston Railroad; and the remaining three\r\ndivisions of the Fifteenth Corps marched to Eastport, crossed the\r\nTennessee River by the aid of the gunboats, a ferry-boat, and a\r\ncouple of transports which had come up, and hurried eastward.\r\n\r\nIn person I crossed on the 1st of November, and rode forward to\r\nFlorence, where I overtook Ewing's division.  The other divisions\r\nfollowed rapidly.  On the road to Florence I was accompanied by my\r\nstaff, some clerks, and mounted orderlies.  Major Ezra Taylor\r\nwas chief of artillery, and one of his sons was a clerk at\r\nhead-quarters.  The latter seems to have dropped out of the column,\r\nand gone to a farm house near the road.  There was no organized\r\nforce of the rebel army north of the Tennessee River, but the\r\ncountry was full of guerrillas.  A party of these pounced down on\r\nthe farm, caught young Taylor and another of the clerks, and after\r\nreaching Florence, Major Taylor heard of the capture of his son, and\r\nlearned that when last seen he was stripped of his hat and coat, was\r\ntied to the tail-board of a wagon, and driven rapidly to the north\r\nof the road we had traveled.  The major appealed to me to do\r\nsomething for his rescue.  I had no cavalry to send in pursuit, but\r\nknowing that there was always an understanding between these\r\nguerrillas and their friends who staid at home, I sent for three or\r\nfour of the principal men of Florence (among them a Mr. Foster, who\r\nhad once been a Senator in Congress), explained to them the capture\r\nof young Taylor and his comrade, and demanded their immediate\r\nrestoration. They, of course, remonstrated, denied all knowledge of\r\nthe acts of these guerrillas, and claimed to be peaceful citizens of\r\nAlabama, residing at home.  I insisted that these guerrillas were\r\ntheir own sons and neighbors; that they knew their haunts, and could\r\nreach them if they wanted, and they could effect the restoration to\r\nus of these men; and I said, moreover, they must do it within\r\ntwenty-four hours, or I would take them, strip them of their hats\r\nand coats, and tie them to the tail-boards of our wagons till they\r\nwere produced.  They sent off messengers at once, and young Taylor\r\nand his comrade were brought back the next day.\r\n\r\nResuming our march eastward by the large road, we soon reached Elk\r\nRiver, which was wide and deep, and could only be crossed by a\r\nferry, a process entirely too slow for the occasion; so I changed\r\nthe route more by the north, to Elkton, Winchester, and Deckerd.\r\nAt this point we came in communication with the Army of the\r\nCumberland, and by telegraph with General Grant, who was at\r\nChattanooga.  He reiterated his orders for me and my command to\r\nhurry forward with all possible dispatch, and in person I reached\r\nBridgeport during the night of November 13th, my troops following\r\nbehind by several roads.  At Bridgeport I found a garrison guarding\r\nthe railroad-bridge and pontoon bridge there, and staid with the\r\nquartermaster, Colonel William G. Le Due (who was my school-mate at\r\nHow's School in 1836).  There I received a dispatch from General\r\nGrant, at Chattanooga, to come up in person, leaving my troops to\r\nfollow as fast as possible.  At that time there were two or three\r\nsmall steamboats on the river, engaged in carrying stores up as far\r\nas Kelly's Ferry.  In one of these I took passage, and on reaching\r\nKelly's Ferry found orderlies, with one of General Grant's private\r\nhorses, waiting for me, on which I rode into Chattanooga, November\r\n14th.  Of course, I was heartily welcomed by Generals Grant,\r\nThomas, and all, who realized the extraordinary efforts we had made\r\nto come to their relief.  The next morning we walked out to Fort\r\nWood, a prominent salient of the defenses of the place, and from\r\nits parapet we had a magnificent view of the panorama.  Lookout\r\nMountain, with its rebel flags and batteries, stood out boldly, and\r\nan occasional shot fired toward Wauhatchee or Moccasin Point gave\r\nlife to the scene.  These shots could barely reach Chattanooga, and\r\nI was told that one or more shot had struck a hospital inside the\r\nlines.  All along Missionary Ridge were the tents of the rebel\r\nbeleaguering force; the lines of trench from Lookout up toward the\r\nChickamauga were plainly visible; and rebel sentinels, in a\r\ncontinuous chain, were walking their posts in plain view, not a\r\nthousand yards off.  \"Why,\" said I, \"General Grant, you are\r\nbesieged;\" and he said, \"It is too true.\"  Up to that moment I had\r\nno idea that things were so bad.  The rebel lines actually extended\r\nfrom the river, below the town, to the river above, and the Army of\r\nthe Cumberland was closely held to the town and its immediate\r\ndefenses.  General Grant pointed out to me a house on Missionary\r\nRidge, where General Bragg's headquarters were known to be.  He\r\nalso explained the situation of affairs generally; that the mules\r\nand horses of Thomas's army were so starved that they could not\r\nhaul his guns; that forage, corn, and provisions, were so scarce\r\nthat the men in hunger stole the few grains of corn that were given\r\nto favorite horses; that the men of Thomas's army had been so\r\ndemoralized by the battle of Chickamauga that he feared they could\r\nnot be got out of their trenches to assume the offensive; that\r\nBragg had detached Longstreet with a considerable force up into\r\nEast Tennessee, to defeat and capture Burnside; that Burnside was\r\nin danger, etc.; and that he (Grant) was extremely anxious to\r\nattack Bragg in position, to defeat him, or at least to force him\r\nto recall Longstreet.  The Army of the Cumberland had so long been\r\nin the trenches that he wanted my troops to hurry up, to take the\r\noffensive first; after which, he had no doubt the Cumberland army\r\nwould fight well.  Meantime the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps, under\r\nGeneral Hooker, had been advanced from Bridgeport along the\r\nrailroad to Wauhatchee, but could not as yet pass Lookout Mountain.\r\nA pontoon-bridge had been thrown across the Tennessee River at\r\nBrown's Ferry, by which supplies were hauled into Chattanooga from\r\nKelly's and Wauhatchee..\r\n\r\nAnother bridge was in course of construction at Chattanooga, under\r\nthe immediate direction of Quartermaster-General Meigs, but at the\r\ntime all wagons, etc., had to be ferried across by a flying-bridge.\r\nMen were busy and hard at work everywhere inside our lines, and\r\nboats for another pontoon-bridge were being rapidly constructed\r\nunder Brigadier-General W. F. Smith, familiarly known as \"Baldy\r\nSmith,\" and this bridge was destined to be used by my troops, at a\r\npoint of the river about four miles above Chattanooga, just below\r\nthe mouth of the Chickamauga River.  General Grant explained to me\r\nthat he had reconnoitred the rebel line from Lookout Mountain up to\r\nChickamauga, and he believed that the northern portion of\r\nMissionary Ridge was not fortified at all; and he wanted me, as\r\nsoon as my troops got up, to lay the new pontoon-bridge by night,\r\ncross over, and attack Bragg's right flank on that part of the\r\nridge abutting on Chickamauga Creek, near the tunnel; and he\r\nproposed that we should go at once to look at the ground.  In\r\ncompany with Generals Thomas, W. F. Smith, Brannan, and others, we\r\ncrossed by the flying-bridge, rode back of the hills some four\r\nmiles, left our horses, and got on a hill overlooking the whole\r\nground about the mouth of the Chickamauga River, and across to the\r\nMissionary Hills near the tunnel.  Smith and I crept down behind a\r\nfringe of trees that lined the river-bank, to the very point\r\nselected for the new bridge, where we sat for some time, seeing the\r\nrebel pickets on the opposite bank, and almost hearing their words.\r\n\r\nHaving seen enough, we returned to Chattanooga; and in order to\r\nhurry up my command, on which so much depended, I started back to\r\nKelly's in hopes to catch the steamboat that same evening; but on\r\nmy arrival the boat had gone.  I applied to the commanding officer,\r\ngot a rough boat manned by four soldiers, and started down the\r\nriver by night.  I occasionally took a turn at the oars to relieve\r\nsome tired man, and about midnight we reached Shell Mound, where\r\nGeneral Whittaker, of Kentucky, furnished us a new and good crew,\r\nwith which we reached Bridgeport by daylight.  I started Ewings\r\ndivision in advance, with orders to turn aside toward Trenton, to\r\nmake the enemy believe we were going to turn Braggs left by pretty\r\nmuch the same road Rosecrans had followed; but with the other three\r\ndivisions I followed the main road, via the Big Trestle at\r\nWhitesides, and reached General Hooker's headquarters, just above\r\nWauhatchee, on the 20th; my troops strung all the way back to\r\nBridgeport.  It was on this occasion that the Fifteenth Corps\r\ngained its peculiar badge: as the men were trudging along the\r\ndeeply-cut, muddy road, of a cold, drizzly day, one of our Western\r\nsoldiers left his ranks and joined a party of the Twelfth Corps at\r\ntheir camp-fire.  They got into conversation, the Twelfth-Corps men\r\nasking what troops we were, etc., etc.  In turn, our fellow (who\r\nhad never seen a corps-badge, and noticed that every thing was\r\nmarked with a star) asked if they were all brigadier-generals.  Of\r\ncourse they were not, but the star was their corps-badge, and every\r\nwagon, tent, hat, etc., had its star.  Then the Twelfth-Corps men\r\ninquired what corps he belonged to, and he answered, \"The Fifteenth\r\nCorps.\"  \"What is your badge?\"  \"Why,\" said he (and he was an\r\nIrishman), suiting the action to the word, \"forty rounds in the\r\ncartridge-box, and twenty in the pocket.\"  At that time Blair\r\ncommanded the corps; but Logan succeeded soon after, and, hearing\r\nthe story, adopted the cartridge-box and forty rounds as the\r\ncorps-badge.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the roads was such, and the bridge at Brown's so\r\nfrail, that it was not until the 23d that we got three of my\r\ndivisions behind the hills near the point indicated above\r\nChattanooga for crossing the river.  It was determined to begin the\r\nbattle with these three divisions, aided by a division of Thomas's\r\narmy, commanded by General Jeff.  C. Davis, that was already near\r\nthat point.  All the details of the battle of Chattanooga, so far\r\nas I was a witness, are so fully given in my official report\r\nherewith, that I need add nothing to it.  It was a magnificent\r\nbattle in its conception, in its execution, and in its glorious\r\nresults; hastened somewhat by the supposed danger of Burnside, at\r\nKnoxville, yet so completely successful, that nothing is left for\r\ncavil or fault-finding.  The first day was lowering and overcast,\r\nfavoring us greatly, because we wanted to be concealed from Bragg,\r\nwhose position on the mountain-tops completely overlooked us and\r\nour movements.  The second day was beautifully clear, and many a\r\ntime, in the midst of its carnage and noise, I could not help\r\nstopping to look across that vast field of battle, to admire its\r\nsublimity.\r\n\r\nThe object of General Hooker's and my attacks on the extreme flanks\r\nof Bragg's position was, to disturb him to such an extent, that\r\nhe would naturally detach from his centre as against us, so that\r\nThomas's army could break through his centre.  The whole plan\r\nsucceeded admirably; but it was not until after dark that I learned\r\nthe complete success at the centre, and received General Grant's\r\norders to pursue on the north side of Chickamauga Creek:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, CHATTANOOGA,\r\nTENNESSEE, Nov. 25, 1863\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: No doubt you witnessed the handsome manner in which\r\nThomas's troops carried Missionary Ridge this afternoon, and can\r\nfeel a just pride, too, in the part taken by the forces under your\r\ncommand in taking first so much of the same range of hills, and\r\nthen in attracting the attention of so many of the enemy as to make\r\nThomas's part certain of success.  The neat thing now will be to\r\nrelieve Burnside.  I have heard from him to the evening of the 23d.\r\nAt that time he had from ten to twelve days' supplies, and spoke\r\nhopefully of being able to hold out that length of time.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to move your forces out gradually until they reach the\r\nrailroad between Cleveland and Dalton.  Granger will move up the\r\nsouth side of the Tennessee with a column of twenty thousand men,\r\ntaking no wagons, or but few, with him.  His men will carry four\r\ndays' rations, and the steamer Chattanooga, loaded with rations,\r\nwill accompany the expedition.\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that Bragg's entire force has left.  If not,\r\nof course, the first thing is to dispose of him.  If he has gone,\r\nthe only thing necessary to do to-morrow will be to send out a\r\nreconnoissance to ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy.  Yours\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nU. S.  GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\nP. S.-On reflection, I think we will push Bragg with all our\r\nstrength to-morrow, and try if we cannot out off a good portion of\r\nhis rear troops and trains.  His men have manifested a strong\r\ndisposition to desert for some time past, and we will now give them\r\na chance.  I will instruct Thomas accordingly.  Move the advance\r\nforce early, on the most easterly road taken by the enemy.\r\nU. S. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis compelled me to reverse our column, so as to use the bridge\r\nacross the Chickamauga at its mouth.  The next day we struck the\r\nrebel rear at Chickamauga Station, and again near Graysville.\r\nThere we came in contact with Hooker's and Palmer's troops, who had\r\nreached Ringgold.  There I detached Howard to cross Taylor's Ridge,\r\nand strike the railroad which comes from the north by Cleveland to\r\nDalton.  Hooker's troops were roughly handled at Ringgold, and the\r\npursuit was checked.  Receiving a note from General Hooker, asking\r\nhelp, I rode forward to Ringgold to explain the movement of Howard;\r\nwhere I met General Grant, and learned that the rebels had again\r\nretreated toward Dalton.  He gave orders to discontinue the\r\npursuit, as he meant to turn his attention to General Burnside,\r\nsupposed to be in great danger at Knoxville, about one hundred and\r\nthirty miles northeast.  General Grant returned and spent part of\r\nthe night with me, at Graysville.  We talked over matters\r\ngenerally, and he explained that he had ordered General Gordon\r\nGranger, with the Fourth Corps, to move forward rapidly to\r\nBurnsides help, and that he must return to Chattanooga to push him.\r\nBy reason of the scarcity of food, especially of forage, he\r\nconsented that, instead of going back, I might keep out in the\r\ncountry; for in motion I could pick up some forage and food,\r\nespecially on the Hiawassee River, whereas none remained in\r\nChattanooga.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 29th of November, my several columns marched to\r\nCleveland, and the next day we reached the Hiawassee at Charleston,\r\nwhere the Chattanooga & Knoxville Railroad crosses it.  The\r\nrailroad-bridge was partially damaged by the enemy in retreating,\r\nbut we found some abandoned stores.  There and thereabouts I\r\nexpected some rest for my weary troops and horses; but, as I rode\r\ninto town, I met Colonel J. H. Wilson and C. A. Dana (Assistant\r\nSecretary of War), who had ridden out from Chattanooga to find me,\r\nwith the following letter from General Grant, and copies of several\r\ndispatches from General Burnside, the last which had been received\r\nfrom him by way of Cumberland Gap:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, CHATTANOOGA,\r\nTENNESSEE, Nov. 29, 1863\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN\r\n\r\nNews are received from Knoxville to the morning of the 27th.  At\r\nthat time the place was still invested, but the attack on it was\r\nnot vigorous.  Longstreet evidently determined to starve the\r\ngarrison out.  Granger is on the way to Burnside's relief, but I\r\nhave lost all faith in his energy or capacity to manage an\r\nexpedition of the importance of this one.  I am inclined to think,\r\ntherefore, I shall have to send you.  Push as rapidly as you can to\r\nthe Hiawassee, and determine for yourself what force to take with\r\nyou from that point.  Granger has his corps with him, from which\r\nyou will select in conjunction with the force now with you.  In\r\nplain words, you will assume command of all the forces now moving\r\nup the Tennessee, including the garrison at Kingston, and from that\r\nforce, organize what you deem proper to relieve Burnside.  The\r\nbalance send back to Chattanooga.  Granger has a boat loaded with\r\nprovisions, which you can issue, and return the boat.  I will have\r\nanother loaded, to follow you.  Use, of course, as sparingly as\r\npossible from the rations taken with you, and subsist off the\r\ncountry all you can.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that Foster is moving, by this time, from Cumberland\r\nGap on Knoxville.  I do not know what force he will have with him,\r\nbut presume it will range from three thousand five hundred to five\r\nthousand I leave this matter to you, knowing that you will do\r\nbetter acting upon your discretion than you could trammeled with\r\ninstructions.  I will only add, that the last advices from Burnside\r\nhimself indicated his ability to hold out with rations only to\r\nabout the 3d of December.  Very respectfully,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General commanding,\r\n\r\n\r\nThis showed that, on the 27th of November, General Burnside was in\r\nKnoxville, closely besieged by the rebel General Longstreet; that\r\nhis provisions were short, and that, unless relieved by December\r\n3d, he might have to surrender.  General Grant further wrote that\r\nGeneral Granger, instead of moving with great rapidity as ordered,\r\nseemed to move  \"slowly, and with reluctance;\" and, although he\r\n(General Grant) hated to call on me and on my tired troops, there\r\nwas no alternative.  He wanted me to take command of every thing\r\nwithin reach, and to hurry forward to Knoxville.\r\n\r\nAll the details of our march to Knoxville are also given in my\r\nofficial report.  By extraordinary efforts Long's small brigade of\r\ncavalry reached Knoxville during the night of the 3d, purposely to\r\nlet Burnside know that I was rapidly approaching with an adequate\r\nforce to raise the siege.\r\n\r\nWith the head of my infantry column I reached Marysville, about\r\nfifteen miles short of Knoxville, on the 5th of December; when I\r\nreceived official notice from Burnside that Longstreet had raised\r\nthe siege, and had started in retreat up the valley toward\r\nVirginia.  Halting all the army, except Granger's two divisions, on\r\nthe morning of the 6th, with General Granger and some of my staff I\r\nrode into Knoxville.  Approaching from the south and west, we\r\ncrossed the Holston on a pontoon bridge, and in a large pen on the\r\nKnoxville side I saw a fine lot of cattle, which did not look much\r\nlike starvation.  I found General Burnside and staff domiciled in a\r\nlarge, fine mansion, looking very comfortable, and in, a few words\r\nhe described to me the leading events, of the previous few days,\r\nand said he had already given orders looking to the pursuit of\r\nLongstreet.  I offered to join in the pursuit, though in fact my\r\nmen were worn out, and suffering in that cold season and climate.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on our way up I personally was almost frozen, and had to\r\nbeg leave to sleep in the house of a family at Athens.\r\n\r\nBurnside explained to me that, reenforced by Granger's two\r\ndivisions of ten thousand men, he would be able to push Longstreet\r\nout of East Tennessee, and he hoped to capture much of his\r\nartillery and trains.  Granger was present at our conversation, and\r\nmost unreasonably, I thought, remonstrated against being left;\r\ncomplaining bitterly of what he thought was hard treatment to his\r\nmen and himself.  I know that his language and manner at that time\r\nproduced on my mind a bad impression, and it was one of the causes\r\nwhich led me to relieve him as a corps commander in the campaign of\r\nthe next spring.  I asked General Burnside to reduce his wishes to\r\nwriting, which he did in the letter of December 7th, embodied in my\r\nofficial report.  General Burnside and I then walked along his\r\nlines and examined the salient, known as Fort Sanders, where, some\r\ndays before, Longstreet had made his assault, and had sustained a\r\nbloody repulse.\r\n\r\nReturning to Burnside's quarters, we all sat down to a good dinner,\r\nembracing roast-turkey.  There was a regular dining table, with\r\nclean tablecloth, dishes, knives, forks, spoons, etc., etc.  I had\r\nseen nothing of this kind in my field experience, and could not\r\nhelp exclaiming that I thought \"they were starving,\" etc.; but\r\nBurnside explained that Longstreet had at no time completely\r\ninvested the place, and that he had kept open communication with\r\nthe country on the south side of the river Holston, more especially\r\nwith the French Broad settlements, from whose Union inhabitants he\r\nhad received a good supply of beef, bacon, and corn meal.  Had I\r\nknown of this, I should not have hurried my men so fast; but until\r\nI reached Knoxville I thought his troops there were actually in\r\ndanger of starvation.  Having supplied General Burnside all the\r\nhelp he wanted, we began our leisurely return to Chattanooga, which\r\nwe reached on the 16th; when General Grant in person ordered me to\r\nrestore to General Thomas the divisions of Howard and Davis, which\r\nbelonged to his army, and to conduct my own corps (the Fifteenth)\r\nto North Alabama for winter-quarters.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY OF TENNESSEE, BRIDGEPORT,\r\nALABAMA December 19, 1863\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General John A. RAWLINS, Chief of Staff to General GRANT,\r\nChattanooga.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: For the first time, I am now at leisure to make an\r\nofficial record of events with which the troops under my command\r\nhave been connected daring the eventful campaign which has just\r\nclosed.  Dating the month of September last, the Fifteenth Army\r\nCorps, which I had the honor to command, lay in camps along the Big\r\nBlack, about twenty miles east of Vicksburg, Mississippi.  It\r\nconsisted of four divisions:\r\n\r\nThe First, commanded by Brigadier-General P. J. Osterhaus, was\r\ncomposed of two brigades, led by Brigadier-General C. R. Woods and\r\nColonel J. A. Williamson (of the Fourth Iowa).\r\n\r\nThe Second, commanded by Brigadier-General Morgan L. Smith, was\r\ncomposed of two brigades, led by Brigadier-Generals Giles A. Smith\r\nand J. A. J. Lightburn.\r\n\r\nThe Third, commanded by Brigadier-General J. M. Tuttle, was\r\ncomposed of three brigades, led by Brigadier-Generals J. A. Mower\r\nand R. P. Buckland, and Colonel J. J. Wood (of the Twelfth Iowa).\r\n\r\nThe Fourth, commanded by Brigadier-General Hugh Ewing, was composed\r\nof three brigades, led by Brigadier-General J. M. Corse, Colonel\r\nLoomis (Twenty-sixth Illinois), and Colonel J. R. Cockerill (of the\r\nSeventieth Ohio).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of September I received a telegraphic dispatch from\r\nGeneral Grant, then at Vicksburg, commanding the Department of the\r\nTennessee, requiring me to detach one of my divisions to march to\r\nVicksburg, there to embark for Memphis, where it was to form a part\r\nof an army to be sent to Chattanooga, to reenforce General\r\nRosecrans.  I designated the First Division, and at 4 a. m. the\r\nsame day it marched for Vicksburg, and embarked the neat day.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of September I was summoned to Vicksburg by the general\r\ncommanding, who showed me several dispatches from the general-\r\nin-chief, which led him to suppose he would have to send me and my\r\nwhole corps to Memphis and eastward, and I was instructed to\r\nprepare for such orders.  It was explained to me that, in\r\nconsequence of the low stage of water in the Mississippi, boats had\r\narrived irregularly, and had brought dispatches that seemed to\r\nconflict in their meaning, and that General John E. Smith's\r\ndivision (of General McPherson's corps) had been ordered up to\r\nMemphis, and that I should take that division and leave one of my\r\nown in its stead, to hold the line of the Big Black.  I detailed\r\nmy third division (General Tuttle) to remain and report to\r\nMajor-General McPherson, commanding the Seventeenth Corps, at\r\nVicksburg; and that of General John E. Smith, already started for\r\nMemphis, was styled the Third Division, Fifteenth Corps, though  it\r\nstill belongs to the Seventeenth Army Corps.  This division is also\r\ncomposed of three brigades, commanded by General Matthias, Colonel\r\nJ. B. Raum (of the Fifty-sixth Illinois), and Colonel J. I.\r\nAlexander (of the Fifty-ninth Indiana).\r\n\r\nThe Second and Fourth Divisions were started for Vicksburg the\r\nmoment I was notified that boats were in readiness, and on the\r\n27th of September I embarked in person in the steamer Atlantic,\r\nfor Memphis, followed by a fleet of boats conveying these\r\ntwo divisions.  Our progress was slow, on account of the\r\nunprecedentedly low water in the Mississippi, and the scarcity of\r\ncoal and wood.  We were compelled at places to gather fence-rails,\r\nand to land wagons and haul wood from the interior to the boats;\r\nbut I reached Memphis during the night of the 2d of October, and\r\nthe other boats came in on the 3d and 4th.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Memphis I saw General Hurlbut, and read all the\r\ndispatches and letters of instruction of General Halleck, and\r\ntherein derived my instructions, which I construed to be as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTo conduct the Fifteenth Army Corps, and all other troops which\r\ncould be spared from the line of the Memphis & Charleston Railroad,\r\nto Athens, Alabama, and thence report by letter for orders to\r\nGeneral Rosecrans, commanding the Army of the Cumberland, at\r\nChattanooga; to follow substantially the railroad eastward,\r\nrepairing it as I moved; to look to my own line for supplies; and\r\nin no event to depend on General Rosecrans for supplies, as the\r\nroads to his rear were already overtaxed to supply his present\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nI learned from General Hurlbut that General Osterhaus's division\r\nwas already out in front of Corinth, and that General John E. Smith\r\nwas still at Memphis, moving his troops and material by railroad as\r\nfast as its limited stock would carry them.  General J. D. Webster\r\nwas superintendent of the railroad, and was enjoined to work night\r\nand day, and to expedite the movement as rapidly as possible; but\r\nthe capacity of the road was so small, that I soon saw that I could\r\nmove horses, mules, and wagons faster by land, and therefore I\r\ndispatched the artillery and wagons by the road under escort, and\r\nfinally moved the entire Fourth Division by land.\r\n\r\nThe enemy seems to have had early notice of this movement, and he\r\nendeavored to thwart us from the start.  A considerable force\r\nassembled in a threatening attitude at Salem, south of Salisbury\r\nStation; and General Carr, who commanded at Corinth, felt compelled\r\nto turn back and use a part of my troops, that had already reached\r\nCorinth, to resist the threatened attack.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 11th, having put in motion my whole force, I\r\nstarted myself for Corinth, in a special train, with the battalion\r\nof the Thirteenth United States Regulars as escort.  We reached\r\nCollierville Station about noon, just in time to take part in the\r\ndefense made of that station by Colonel D. C. Anthony, of the\r\nSixty-sixth Indiana, against an attack made by General Chalmers\r\nwith a force of about three thousand cavalry, with eight pieces of\r\nartillery.  He was beaten off, the damage to the road repaired, and\r\nwe resumed our journey the next day, reaching Corinth at night.\r\n\r\nI immediately ordered General Blair forward to Iuka, with the First\r\nDivision, and, as fast as I got troops up, pushed them forward of\r\nBear Creek, the bridge of which was completely destroyed, and an\r\nengineer regiment, under command of Colonel Flag, was engaged in\r\nits repairs.\r\n\r\nQuite a considerable force of the enemy was assembled in our front,\r\nnear Tuscumbia, to resist our advance.  It was commanded by General\r\nStephen D. Lee, and composed of Roddy's and Ferguson's brigades,\r\nwith irregular cavalry, amounting in the aggregate to about five\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nIn person I moved from Corinth to Burnsville on the 18th, and to\r\nIuka on the 19th of October.\r\n\r\nOsterhaus's division was in the advance, constantly skirmishing\r\nwith the enemy; he was supported by General Morgan L. Smith's, both\r\ndivisions under the general command of Major-General Blair.\r\nGeneral John E. Smith's division covered the working-party engaged\r\nin rebuilding the railroad.\r\n\r\nForeseeing difficulty in crossing the Tennessee River, I had\r\nwritten to Admiral Porter, at Cairo, asking him to watch the\r\nTennessee and send up some gunboats the moment the stage of water\r\nadmitted; and had also requested General Allen, quartermaster at\r\nSt. Louis, to dispatch to Eastport a steam ferry-boat.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, ever prompt and ready to assist us, had two fine\r\ngunboats at Eastport, under Captain Phelps, the very day after my\r\narrival at Iuka; and Captain Phelps had a coal-barge decked over,\r\nwith which to cross our horses and wagons before the arrival of the\r\nferry-boat.\r\n\r\nStill following literally the instructions of General Halleck, I\r\npushed forward the repairs of the railroad, and ordered General\r\nBlair, with the two leading divisions, to drive the enemy beyond\r\nTuscumbia.  This he did successfully, after a pretty severe fight\r\nat Cane Creek, occupying Tuscumbia on the 27th of October.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime many important changes in command had occurred,\r\nwhich I must note here, to a proper understanding of the case.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had been called from Vicksburg, and sent to\r\nChattanooga to command the military division of the Mississippi,\r\ncomposed of the three Departments of the Ohio, Cumberland, and\r\nTennessee; and the Department of the Tennessee had been devolved on\r\nme, with instructions, however, to retain command of the army in\r\nthe field.  At Iuka I made what appeared to me the best disposition\r\nof matters relating to the department, giving General McPherson\r\nfull powers in Mississippi and General Hurlbut in West Tennessee,\r\nand assigned General Blair to the command of the Fifteenth Army\r\nCorps; and summoned General Hurlbut from Memphis, and General Dodge\r\nfrom Corinth, and selected out of the Sixteenth Corps a force of\r\nabout eight thousand men, which I directed General Dodge to\r\norganize with all expedition, and with it to follow me eastward.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of October, when General Blair, with two divisions, was\r\nat Tuscumbia, I ordered General Ewing, with the Fourth Division, to\r\ncross the Tennessee (by means of the gunboats and scow) as rapidly\r\nas possible at Eastport, and push forward to Florence, which he\r\ndid; and the same day a messenger from General Grant floated down\r\nthe Tennessee over Muscle Shoals, landed at Tuscumbia, and was sent\r\nto me at Iuka.  He bore a short message from the general to this\r\neffect: \"Drop all work on the railroad east of Bear Creek; push\r\nyour command toward Bridgeport till you meet orders;\" etc.\r\nInstantly the order was executed; the order of march was reversed,\r\nand all the columns were directed to Eastport, the only place where\r\nwe could cross the Tennessee.  At first we only had the gunboats\r\nand coal-barge; but the ferry-boat and two transports arrived on\r\nthe 31st of October, and the work of crossing was pushed with all\r\nthe vigor possible.  In person I crossed, and passed to the head of\r\nthe column at Florence on the 1st of November, leaving the rear\r\ndivisions to be conducted by General Blair, and marched to\r\nRogersville and Elk River.  This was found impassable.  To ferry\r\nwould have consumed to much time, and to build a bridge still more;\r\nso there was no alternative but to turn up Elk River by way of\r\nGilbertsboro, Elkton, etc., to the stone bridge at Fayetteville,\r\nwhere we crossed the Elk, and proceeded to Winchester and Deckerd.\r\n\r\nAt Fayetteville I received orders from General Grant to come to\r\nBridgeport with the Fifteenth Army Corps, and to leave General\r\nDodge's command at Pulaski, and along the railroad from Columbia to\r\nDecatur.  I instructed General Blair to follow with the Second and\r\nFirst Divisions by way of New Market, Larkinsville, and Bellefonte,\r\nwhile I conducted the other two divisions by way of Deckerd; the\r\nFourth Division crossing the mountain to Stevenson, and the Third\r\nby University Place and Sweden's Cove.\r\n\r\nIn person I proceeded by Sweden's Cove and Battle Creek, reaching\r\nBridgeport on the night of November 13th.  I immediately\r\ntelegraphed to the commanding general my arrival, and the positions\r\nof my several divisions, and was summoned to Chattanooga.  I took\r\nthe first steamboat daring the night of the 14th for Belly's Ferry,\r\nand rode into Chattanooga on the 16th.  I then learned the part\r\nassigned me in the coming drama, was supplied with the necessary\r\nmaps and information, and rode, during the 18th, in company with\r\nGenerals Grant, Thomas, W. F. Smith, Brannan, and others, to the\r\npositions occupied on the west bank of the Tennessee, from which\r\ncould be seen the camps of the enemy, compassing Chattanooga and\r\nthe line of Missionary Hills, with its terminus on Chickamauga\r\nCreek, the point that I was expected to take, hold, and fortify.\r\nPontoons, with a full supply of balks and chesses, had been\r\nprepared for the bridge over the Tennessee, and all things had been\r\nprearranged with a foresight that elicited my admiration.  From the\r\nhills we looked down on the amphitheatre of Chattanooga as on a\r\nmap, and nothing remained but for me to put my troops in the\r\ndesired position.  The plan contemplated that, in addition to\r\ncrossing the Tennessee River and making a lodgment on the terminus\r\nof Missionary Ridge, I should demonstrate against Lookout Mountain,\r\nnear Trenton, with a part of my command.\r\n\r\nAll in Chattanooga were impatient for action, rendered almost acute\r\nby the natural apprehensions felt for the safety of General\r\nBurnside in East Tennessee.\r\n\r\nMy command had marched from Memphis, three hundred and thirty\r\nmiles, and I had pushed them as fast as the roads and distance\r\nwould admit, but I saw enough of the condition of men and animals\r\nin Chattanooga to inspire me with renewed energy.  I immediately\r\nordered my leading division (General Ewing's) to march via\r\nShellmound to Trenton, demonstrating against Lookout Ridge, but to\r\nbe prepared to turn quickly and follow me to Chattanooga and in\r\nperson I returned to Bridgeport, rowing a boat down the Tennessee\r\nfrom Belly's Ferry, and immediately on arrival put in motion my\r\ndivisions in the order in which they had arrived.  The bridge of\r\nboats at Bridgeport was frail, and, though used day and night, our\r\npassage was slow; and the road thence to Chattanooga was dreadfully\r\ncut up and encumbered with the wagons of the other troops stationed\r\nalong the road.  I reached General Hooker's headquarters during a\r\nrain, in the afternoon of the 20th, and met General Grant's orders\r\nfor the general attack on the next day.  It was simply impossible\r\nfor me to fulfill my part in time; only one division (General John\r\nE. Smith's) was in position.  General Ewing was still at Trenton,\r\nand the other two were toiling along the terrible road from\r\nShellmound to Chattanooga.  No troops ever were or could be in\r\nbetter condition than mine, or who labored harder to fulfill their\r\npart.  On a proper representation, General Grant postponed the\r\nattack.  On the 21st I got the Second Division over Brown's-Ferry\r\nBridge, and General Ewing got up; but the bridge broke repeatedly,\r\nand delays occurred which no human sagacity could prevent.  All\r\nlabored night and day, and General Ewing got over on the 23d; but\r\nmy rear division was cut off by the broken bridge at Brown's Ferry,\r\nand could not join me.  I offered to go into action with my three\r\ndivisions, supported by General Jeff.  C. Davis, leaving one of my\r\nbest divisions (Osterhaus's) to act with General Hooker against\r\nLookout Mountain.  That division has not joined me yet, but I know\r\nand feel that it has served the country well, and that it has\r\nreflected honor on the Fifteenth Army Corps and the Army of the\r\nTennessee.  I leave the record of its history to General Hooker, or\r\nwhomsoever has had its services during the late memorable events,\r\nconfident that all will do it merited honor.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 28d of November, my three divisions lay behind the\r\nhills opposite the mouth of the Chickamauga.  I dispatched the\r\nbrigade of the Second Division, commanded by General Giles A.\r\nSmith, under cover of the hills, to North Chickamauga Creek, to man\r\nthe boats designed for the pontoon-bridge, with orders (at\r\nmidnight) to drop down silently to a point above the mouth of the\r\nSouth Chickamauga, there land two regiments, who were to move along\r\nthe river-bank quietly, and capture the enemy's river-pickets.\r\n\r\nGeneral Giles A. Smith then was to drop rapidly below the month of\r\nthe Chickamauga, disembark the rest of his brigade, and dispatch\r\nthe boats across for fresh loads.  These orders were skillfully\r\nexecuted, and every rebel picket but one was captured.  The balance\r\nof General Morgan L. Smith's division was then rapidly ferried\r\nacross; that of General John E. Smith followed, and by daylight of\r\nNovember 24th two divisions of about eight thousand men were on the\r\neast bank of the Tennessee, and had thrown up a very respectable\r\nrifle-trench as a tete du pont.  As soon as the day dawned, some of\r\nthe boats were taken from the use of ferrying, and a pontoon-bridge\r\nwas begun, under the immediate direction of Captain Dresser, the\r\nwhole planned and supervised by General William F. Smith in person.\r\nA pontoon-bridge was also built at the same time over Chickamanga\r\nCreek, near its mouth, giving communication with the two regiments\r\nwhich had been left on the north side, and fulfilling a most\r\nimportant purpose at a later stage of the drama.  I will here bear\r\nmy willing testimony to the completeness of this whole business.\r\nAll the officers charged with the work were present, and manifested\r\na skill which I cannot praise too highly.  I have never beheld any\r\nwork done so quietly, so well; and I doubt if the history of war\r\ncan show a bridge of that extent (viz., thirteen hundred and fifty\r\nfeet) laid so noiselessly and well, in so short a time.  I\r\nattribute it to the genius and intelligence of General William F.\r\nSmith.  The steamer Dunbar arrived up in the course of the morning,\r\nand relieved Ewing's division of the labor of rowing across; but by\r\nnoon the pontoon-bridge was done, and my three divisions were\r\nacross, with men, horses, artillery, and every thing.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jeff. C. Davis's division was ready to take the bridge, and\r\nI ordered the columns to form in order to carry the Missionary\r\nHills.  The movement had been carefully explained to all division\r\ncommanders, and at 1 p.m.  we marched from the river in three\r\ncolumns in echelon: the left, General Morgan L. Smith, the column\r\nof direction, following substantially Chickamauga Creek; the\r\ncentre, General, John E. Smith, in columns, doubled on the centre,\r\nat one brigade interval to the right and rear; the right, General\r\nEwing, in column at the same distance to the right rear, prepared\r\nto deploy to the right, on the supposition that we would meet an\r\nenemy in that direction.  Each head of column was covered by a good\r\nline of skirmishers, with supports.  A light drizzling rain\r\nprevailed, and the clouds hung low, cloaking our movement from the\r\nenemy's tower of observation on Lookout Mountain.  We soon gained\r\nthe foothills; our skirmishers crept up the face of the hills,\r\nfollowed by their supports, and at 3.30 p.m. we had gained, with no\r\nloss, the desired point.  A brigade of each division was pushed\r\nrapidly to the top of the hill, and the enemy for the first time\r\nseemed to realize the movement, but too late, for we were in\r\npossession.  He opened with artillery, but General Ewing soon got\r\nsome of Captain Richardson's guns up that steep hill and gave back\r\nartillery, and the enemy's skirmishers made one or two ineffectual\r\ndashes at General Lightburn, who had swept round and got a farther\r\nhill, which was the real continuation of the ridge.  From studying\r\nall the maps, I had inferred that Missionary Ridge was a continuous\r\nhill; but we found ourselves on two high points, with a deep\r\ndepression between us and the one immediately over the tunnel,\r\nwhich was my chief objective point.  The ground we had gained,\r\nhowever, was so important, that I could leave nothing to chance,\r\nand ordered it to be fortified during the night.  One brigade of\r\neach division was left on the hill, one of General Morgan L.\r\nSmith's closed the gap to Chickamauga Creek, two of General John E.\r\nSmith's were drawn back to the base in reserve, and General Ewing's\r\nright was extended down into the plain, thus crossing the ridge in\r\na general line, facing southeast.\r\n\r\nThe enemy felt our left flank about 4 p.m., and a pretty smart\r\nengagement with artillery and muskets ensued, when he drew off; but\r\nit cost us dear, for General Giles A. Smith was severely wounded,\r\nand had to go to the rear; and the command of the brigade devolved\r\non Colonel Topper (One Hundred and Sixteenth Illinois), who managed\r\nit with skill during the rest of the operations.  At the moment of\r\nmy crossing the bridge, General Howard appeared, having come with\r\nthree regiments from Chattanooga, along the east bank of the\r\nTennessee, connecting my new position with that of the main army in\r\nChattanooga.  He left the three regiments attached temporarily to\r\nGen. Ewing's right, and returned to his own corps at Chattanooga.\r\nAs night closed in, I ordered General Jeff. C. Davis to keep one of\r\nhis brigades at the bridge, one close up to my position, and one\r\nintermediate.  Thus we passed the night, heavy details being kept\r\nbusy at work on the intrenchments on the hill.  During the night\r\nthe sky cleared away bright, a cold frost filled the air, and our\r\ncamp-fires revealed to the enemy and to our friends in Chattanooga\r\nour position on Missionary Ridge.  About midnight I received, at\r\nthe hands of Major Rowley (of General Grant's staff), orders to\r\nattack the enemy at \"dawn of day,\" with notice that General Thomas\r\nwould attack in force early in the day.  Accordingly, before day I\r\nwas in the saddle, attended by all my staff; rode to the extreme\r\nleft of our position near Chickamauga Creek; thence up the hill,\r\nheld by General Lightburn; and round to the extreme right of\r\nGeneral Ewing.\r\n\r\nCatching as accurate an idea of the ground as possible by the dim\r\nlight of morning, I saw that our line of attack was in the\r\ndirection of Missionary Ridge, with wings supporting on either\r\nflank.  Quite a valley lay between us and the next hill of the\r\nseries, and this hill presented steep sides, the one to the west\r\npartially cleared, but the other covered with the native forest.\r\nThe crest of the ridge was narrow and wooded.  The farther point of\r\nthis hill was held-by the enemy with a breastwork of logs and fresh\r\nearth, filled with men and two guns.  The enemy was also seen in\r\ngreat force on a still higher hill beyond the tunnel, from which he\r\nhad a fine plunging fire on the hill in dispute.  The gorge\r\nbetween, through which several roads and the railroad-tunnel pass,\r\ncould not be seen from our position, but formed the natural place\r\nd'armes, where the enemy covered his masses to resist our\r\ncontemplated movement of turning his right flank and endangering\r\nhis communications with his depot at Chickamauga Station.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible, the following dispositions were made: The\r\nbrigades of Colonels Cockrell and Alexander, and General Lightburn,\r\nwere to hold our hill as the key-point.  General Corse, with as\r\nmuch of his brigade as could operate along the narrow ridge, was to\r\nattack from our right centre.  General Lightburn was to dispatch a\r\ngood regiment from his position to cooperate with General Corse;\r\nand General Morgan L. Smith was to move along the east base of\r\nMissionary Ridge, connecting with General Corse; and Colonel\r\nLoomis, in like manner, to move along the west bank, supported by\r\nthe two reserve brigades of General John E. Smith.\r\n\r\nThe sun had hardly risen before General Corse had completed his\r\npreparations and his bugle sounded the \"forward!\" The Fortieth\r\nIllinois, supported by the Forty-sixth Ohio, on our right centre,\r\nwith the Thirtieth Ohio (Colonel Jones), moved down the face of our\r\nhill, and up that held by the enemy.  The line advanced to within\r\nabout eighty yards of the intrenched position, where General Corse\r\nfound a secondary crest, which he gained and held.  To this point\r\nhe called his reserves, and asked for reenforcements, which were\r\nsent; but the space was narrow, and it was not well to crowd the\r\nmen, as the enemy's artillery and musketry fire swept the approach\r\nto his position, giving him great advantage.  As soon as General\r\nCorse had made his preparations, he assaulted, and a close, severe\r\ncontest ensued, which lasted more than an hour, gaining and losing\r\nground, but never the position first obtained, from which the enemy\r\nin vain attempted to drive him.  General Morgan L. Smith kept\r\ngaining ground on the left spurs of Missionary Ridge, and Colonel\r\nLoomis got abreast of the tunnel and railroad embankment on his\r\naide, drawing the enemy's fire, and to that extent relieving the\r\nassaulting party on the hill-crest. Captain Callender had four of\r\nhis guns on General Ewing's hill, and Captain Woods his Napoleon\r\nbattery on General Lightburn's; also, two guns of Dillon's battery\r\nwere with Colonel Alexander's brigade.  All directed their fire as\r\ncarefully as possible, to clear the hill to our front, without\r\nendangering our own men.  The fight raged furiously about 10 A.M.,\r\nwhen General Corse received a severe wound, was brought off the\r\nfield, and the command of the brigade and of the assault at that\r\nkey-point devolved on that fine young, gallant officer, Colonel\r\nWalcutt, of the Forty-sixth Ohio, who fulfilled his part manfully.\r\nHe continued the contest, pressing forward at all points.  Colonel\r\nLoomis had made good progress to the right, and about 2 p.m.,\r\nGeneral John E. Smith, judging the battle to be most severe on the\r\nhill, and being required to support General Ewing, ordered up\r\nColonel Raum's and General Matthias's brigades across the field to\r\nthe summit that was being fought for.  They moved up under a heavy\r\nfire of cannon and musketry, and joined Colonel Walcutt; but the\r\ncrest was so narrow that they necessarily occupied the west face of\r\nthe hill.  The enemy, at the time being massed in great strength in\r\nthe tunnel-gorge, moved a large force under cover of the ground and\r\nthe thick bushes, and suddenly appeared on the right rear of this\r\ncommand.  The suddenness of the attack disconcerted the men,\r\nexposed as they were in the open field; they fell back in some\r\ndisorder to the lower edge of the field, and reformed.  These two\r\nbrigades were in the nature of supports, and did not constitute a\r\npart of the real attack.\r\n\r\nThe movement, seen from Chattanooga (five miles off) with\r\nspy-glasses, gave rise to the report, which even General Meiga has\r\nrepeated, that we were repulsed on the left.  It was not so.  The\r\nreal attacking columns of General Corse, Colonel Loomis, and\r\nGeneral Smith, were not repulsed.  They engaged in a close struggle\r\nall day persistently, stubbornly, and well.  When the two reserve\r\nbrigades of General John E. Smith fell back as described, the enemy\r\nmade a show of pursuit, but were in their turn caught in flank by\r\nthe well-directed fire of our brigade on the wooded crest, and\r\nhastily sought cover behind the hill.  Thus matters stood about 3\r\np.m.  The day was bright and clear, and the amphitheatre of\r\nChattanooga sat in beauty at our feet.  I had watched for the\r\nattack of General Thomas \"early in the day.\"   Column after column\r\nof the enemy was streaming toward me; gun after  gun poured its\r\nconcentric shot on us, from every hill and spur that gave a view of\r\nany part of the ground held by us.  An occasional shot from Fort\r\nWood and Orchard Knob, and some musketry-fire and artillery over\r\nabout  Lookout Mountain, was all that I could detect on our side;\r\nbut about 3 p.m.  I noticed the white line of musketry-fire in\r\nfront of Orchard Knoll extending farther and farther right and left\r\nand on.  We could only hear  a faint echo of sound, but enough was\r\nseen to satisfy me that General Thomas was at last moving on the\r\ncentre.  I knew that our attack had drawn vast masses of the enemy\r\nto our flank, and felt sure of the result.  Some guns which had\r\nbeen firing on us all day were silent, or were turned in a\r\ndifferent direction.\r\n\r\nThe advancing line of musketry-fire from Orchard Knoll disappeared\r\nto us behind a spar of the hill, and could no longer be seen; and\r\nit was not until night closed in that I knew that the troops in\r\nChattanooga had swept across Missionary Ridge and broken the\r\nenemy's centre.  Of course, the victory was won, and pursuit was\r\nthe next step.\r\n\r\nI ordered General Morgan L. Smith to feel to the tunnel, and it was\r\nfound vacant, save by the dead and wounded of our own and the enemy\r\ncommingled.  The reserve of General Jeff. C. Davis was ordered to\r\nmarch at once by the pontoon-bridge across Chickamauga Creek, at\r\nits mouth, and push forward for the depot.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard had reported to me in the early part of the day,\r\nwith the remainder of his army corps (the Eleventh), and had been\r\nposted to connect my left with Chickamauga Creek.  He was ordered\r\nto repair an old broken bridge about two miles up the Chickamauga,\r\nand to follow General Davis at 4 A.M., and the Fifteenth Army Corps\r\nwas ordered to follow at daylight.  But General Howard found that\r\nto repair the bridge was more of a task than was at first supposed,\r\nand we were all compelled to cross the Chickamauga on the new\r\npontoon-bridge at its mouth.  By about 11 A.M.  General Jeff. C.\r\nDavis's division reached the depot, just in time to see it in\r\nflames.  He found the enemy occupying two hills, partially\r\nintrenched, just beyond the depot.  These he soon drove away.\r\nThe depot presented a scene of desolation that war alone exhibits\r\n--corn-meal and corn in huge burning piles, broken wagons, abandoned\r\ncaissons, two thirty-two-pounder rifled-guns with carriages burned,\r\npieces of pontoons, balks and chesses, etc., destined doubtless for\r\nthe famous invasion of Kentucky, and all manner of things, burning\r\nand broken.  Still, the enemy kindly left us a good supply of forage\r\nfor our horses, and meal, beans, etc., for our men.\r\n\r\nPausing but a short while, we passed on, the road filled with\r\nbroken wagons and abandoned caissons, till night.  Just as the head\r\nof the column emerged from a dark, miry swamp, we encountered the\r\nrear-guard of the retreating enemy.  The fight was sharp, but the\r\nnight closed in so dark that we could not move.  General Grant came\r\nup to us there.  At daylight we resumed the march, and at\r\nGraysville, where a good bridge spanned the Chickamauga, we found\r\nthe corps of General Palmer on the south bank, who informed us that\r\nGeneral Hooker was on a road still farther south, and we could hear\r\nhis guns near Ringgold.\r\n\r\nAs the roads were filled with all the troops they could possibly\r\naccommodate, I turned to the east, to fulfill another part of the\r\ngeneral plan, viz., to break up all communication between Bragg and\r\nLongstreet.\r\n\r\nWe had all sorts of rumors as to the latter, but it was manifest\r\nthat we should interpose a proper force between these two armies.\r\nI therefore directed General Howard to move to Parker's Gap, and\r\nthence send rapidly a competent force to Red Clay, or the\r\nCouncil-Ground, there to destroy a large section of the railroad\r\nwhich connects Dalton and Cleveland.  This work was most\r\nsuccessfully and fully accomplished that day.  The division of\r\nGeneral Jeff. C. Davis was moved close up to Ringgold, to assist\r\nGeneral Hooker if needed, and the Fifteenth Corps was held at\r\nGrayeville, for any thing that might turn up.  About noon I had a\r\nmessage from General Hooker, saying he had had a pretty hard fight\r\nat the mountain-pass just beyond Ringgold, and he wanted me to come\r\nforward to turn the position.  He was not aware at the time that\r\nHoward, by moving through Parker's Gap toward Red Clay, had already\r\nturned it.  So I rode forward to Ringgold in person, and found the\r\nenemy had already fallen back to Tunnel Hill.  He was already out\r\nof the valley of the Chickamauga, and on ground whence the waters\r\nflow to the Coosa.  He was out of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nI found General Grant at Ringgold, and, after some explanations as\r\nto breaking up the railroad from Ringgold back to the State line,\r\nas soon as some cars loaded with wounded men could be pushed back\r\nto Chickamauga depot, I was ordered to move slowly and leisurely\r\nback to Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Fifteenth Corps destroyed absolutely and\r\neffectually the railroad from a point half-way between Ringgold and\r\nGraysville, back to the State line; and General Grant, coming to\r\nGraysville, consented that, instead of returning direct to\r\nChattanooga, I might send back all my artillery-wagons and\r\nimpediments, and make a circuit by the north as far as the\r\nHiawassee River.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morning of November 29th, General Howard moved\r\nfrom Parker's Gap to Cleveland, General Davis by way of McDaniel's\r\nGap, and General Blair with two divisions of the Fifteenth Corps by\r\nway of Julien's Gap, all meeting at Cleveland that night.  Here\r\nanother good break was made in the Dalton & Cleveland road.  On the\r\n30th the army moved to Charleston, General Howard approaching so\r\nrapidly that the enemy evacuated with haste, leaving the bridge but\r\npartially damaged, and five car-loads of flour and provisions on\r\nthe north bank of the Hiawassee.\r\n\r\nThis was to have been the limit of our operations.  Officers and\r\nmen had brought no baggage or provisions, and the weather was\r\nbitter cold.  I had already reached the town of Charleston, when\r\nGeneral Wilson arrived with a letter from General Grant, at\r\nChattanooga, informing me that the latest authentic accounts from\r\nKnoxville were to the 27th, at which time General Burnside was\r\ncompletely invested, and had provisions only to include the 3d of\r\nDecember; that General Granger had left Chattanooga for Knoxville,\r\nby the river-road, with a steamboat following him in the river; but\r\nhe feared that General Granger could not reach Knoxville in time,\r\nand ordered me to take command of all troops moving for the relief\r\nof Knoxville, and hasten to General Burnside.  Seven days before,\r\nwe had left our camps on the other side of the Tennessee with two\r\ndays' rations, without a change of clothing--stripped for the\r\nfight, with but a single blanket or coat per man, from myself to\r\nthe private included.\r\n\r\nOf course, we then had no provisions save what we gathered by the\r\nroad, and were ill supplied for such a march.  But we learned that\r\ntwelve thousand of our fellow-soldiers were beleaguered in the\r\nmountain town of Knoxville, eighty-four miles distant; that they\r\nneeded relief, and must have it in three days.  This was enough\r\n--and it had to be done.  General Howard that night repaired and\r\nplanked the railroad-bridge, and at daylight the army passed over\r\nthe Hiawassee and marched to Athens, fifteen miles.  I had supposed\r\nrightly that General Granger was about the mouth of the Hiawassee,\r\nand had sent him notice of my orders; that General Grant had sent\r\nme a copy of his written instructions, which were full and\r\ncomplete, and that he must push for Kingston, near which we would\r\nmake a junction.  But by the time I reached Athens I had better\r\nstudied the geography, and sent him orders, which found him at\r\nDecatur, that Kingston was out of our way; that he should send his\r\nboat to Kingston, but with his command strike across to\r\nPhiladelphia, and report to me there.  I had but a small force of\r\ncavalry, which was, at the time of my receipt of General Grant's\r\norders, scouting over about Benton and Columbus.  I left my aide,\r\nMajor McCoy, at Charleston, to communicate with this cavalry and\r\nhurry it forward.  It overtook me in the night at Athens.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of December the army moved rapidly north toward Loudon,\r\ntwenty-six miles distant.  About 11 A.M., the cavalry passed to the\r\nhead of the column, was ordered to push to London, and, if\r\npossible, to save a pontoon-bridge across the Tennessee, held by a\r\nbrigade of the enemy commanded by General Vaughn.  The cavalry\r\nmoved with such rapidity as to capture every picket; but the\r\nbrigade of Vaughn had artillery in position, covered by earthworks,\r\nand displayed a force too respectable to be carried by a cavalry\r\ndash, so that darkness closed in before General Howard's infantry\r\ngot up.  The enemy abandoned the place in the night, destroying the\r\npontoons, running three locomotives and forty-eight cars into the\r\nTennessee River, and abandoned much provision, four guns, and other\r\nmaterial, which General Howard took at daylight.  But the bridge\r\nwas gone, and we were forced to turn east and trust to General\r\nBurnside's bridge at Knoxville.  It was all-important that General\r\nBurnside should have notice of our coming, and but one day of the\r\ntime remained.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, at Philadelphia, during the night of the 2d of\r\nDecember, I sent my aide (Major Audenried) forward to Colonel Long,\r\ncommanding the brigade of cavalry at London, to explain to him how\r\nall-important it was that notice of our approach should reach\r\nGeneral Burnside within twenty-four hours, ordering him to select\r\nthe best materials of his command, to start at once, ford the\r\nLittle Tennessee, and push into Knoxville at whatever cost of life\r\nand horse-flesh.  Major Audenried was ordered to go along.  The\r\ndistance to be traveled was about forty miles, and the roads\r\nvillainous.  Before day they were off, and at daylight the\r\nFifteenth Corps was turned from Philadelphia for the Little\r\nTennessee at Morgantown, where my maps represented the river as\r\nbeing very shallow; but it was found too deep for fording, and the\r\nwater was freezing cold--width two hundred and forty yards, depth\r\nfrom two to five feet; horses could ford, but artillery and men\r\ncould not.  A bridge was indispensable.  General Wilson (who\r\naccompanied me) undertook to superintend the bridge, and I am under\r\nmany obligations to him, as I was without an engineer, having sent\r\nCaptain Jenny back from Graysville to survey our field of battle.\r\nWe had our pioneers, but only such tools as axes, picks, and\r\nspades.  General Wilson, working partly with cut wood and partly\r\nwith square trestles (made of the houses of the late town of\r\nMorgantown), progressed apace, and by dark of December 4th troops\r\nand animals passed over the bridge, and by daybreak of the 5th the\r\nFifteenth Corps (General Blair's) was over, and Generals-Granger's\r\nand Davis's divisions were ready to pass; but the diagonal bracing\r\nwas imperfect for, want of spikes, and the bridge broke, causing\r\ndelay.  I had ordered General Blair to move out on the Marysville\r\nroad five miles, there to await notice that General Granger was on\r\na parallel road abreast of him, and in person I was at a house\r\nwhere the roads parted, when a messenger rode up, bringing me a few\r\nwords from General Burnside, to the effect that Colonel Long had\r\narrived at Knoxville with his cavalry, and that all was well with\r\nhim there; Longstreet still lay before the place, but there were\r\nsymptoms of his speedy departure.\r\n\r\nI felt that I had accomplished the first great step in the problem\r\nfor the relief of General Burnside's army, but still urged on the\r\nwork.  As soon as the bridge was mended, all the troops moved\r\nforward.  General Howard had marched from Loudon, had found a\r\npretty good ford for his horses and wagons at Davis's, seven miles\r\nbelow Morgantown, and had made an ingenious bridge of the wagons\r\nleft by General Vaughn at London, on which to pass his men.  He\r\nmarched by Unitia and Louisville.  On the night of the 5th all the\r\nheads of columns communicated at Marysville, where I met Major Van\r\nBuren (of General Burnside's staff), who announced that Longstreet\r\nhad the night before retreated on the Rutledge, Rogersville, and\r\nBristol road, leading to Virginia; that General Burnside's cavalry\r\nwas on his heels; and that the general desired to see me in person\r\nas soon as I could come to Knoxville.  I ordered all the troops to\r\nhalt and rest, except the two divisions of General Granger, which\r\nwere ordered to move forward to Little River, and General Granger\r\nto report in person to General Burnside for orders.  His was the\r\nforce originally designed to reenforce General Burnside, and it was\r\neminently proper that it should join in the stern-chase after\r\nLongstreet.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 6th I rode from Marysville into\r\nKnoxville, and met General Burnside.  General Granger arrived later\r\nin the day.  We examined his lines of fortifications, which were a\r\nwonderful production for the short time allowed in their selection\r\nof ground and construction of work.  It seemed to me that they were\r\nnearly impregnable.  We examined the redoubt named \"Sanders,\"\r\nwhere, on the Sunday previous, three brigades of the enemy had\r\nassaulted and met a bloody repulse.  Now, all was peaceful and\r\nquiet; but a few hours before, the deadly bullet sought its victim\r\nall round about that hilly barrier.\r\n\r\nThe general explained to me fully and frankly what he had done, and\r\nwhat he proposed to do.  He asked of me nothing but General\r\nGranger's command; and suggested, in view of the large force I had\r\nbrought from Chattanooga, that I should return with due expedition\r\nto the line of the Hiawassee, lest Bragg, reenforced, might take\r\nadvantage of our absence to resume the offensive.  I asked him to\r\nreduce this to writing, which he did, and I here introduce it as\r\npart of my report:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE OHIO\r\nKNOXVILLE, December 7, 1863\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding, etc.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I desire to express to you and your command my most hearty\r\nthanks and gratitude for your promptness in coming to our relief\r\nduring the siege of Knoxville, and I am satisfied your approach\r\nserved to raise the siege.  The emergency having passed, I do not\r\ndeem, for the present, any other portion of your command but the\r\ncorps of General Granger necessary for operations in this section;\r\nand, inasmuch as General Grant has weakened the forces immediately\r\nwith him in order to relieve us (thereby rendering the position of\r\nGeneral Thomas less secure), I deem it advisable that all the\r\ntroops now here, save those commanded by General Granger, should\r\nreturn at once to within supporting distance of the forces in front\r\nof Bragg's army.  In behalf of my command, I desire again to thank\r\nyou and your command for the kindness you have done us.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. E. BURNSIDE, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having seen General Burnside's forces move out of\r\nKnoxville in pursuit of Longstreet, and General Granger's move in,\r\nI put in motion my own command to return.  General Howard was\r\nordered to move, via Davis's Ford and Sweetwater, to Athena, with a\r\nguard forward at Charleston, to hold and repair the bridge which\r\nthe enemy had retaken after our passage up.  General Jeff.  C.\r\nDavis moved to Columbus, on the Hiawaesee, via Madisonville, and\r\nthe two divisions of the Fifteenth Corps moved to Tellico Plains,\r\nto cover movement of cavalry across the mountains into Georgia, to\r\novertake a wagon-train which had dodged us on our way up, and had\r\nescaped by way of Murphy.  Subsequently, on a report from General\r\nHoward that the enemy held Charleston, I diverted General Ewing's\r\ndivision to Athena, and went in person to Tellico with General\r\nMorgan L. Smith's division.  By the 9th all our troops were in\r\nposition, and we held the rich country between the Little Tennessee\r\nand the Hiawassee.  The cavalry, under Colonel Long, passed the\r\nmountain at Tellico, and proceeded about seventeen miles beyond\r\nMurphy, when Colonel Long, deeming his farther pursuit of the\r\nwagon-train useless, returned on the 12th to Tellico.  I then\r\nordered him and the division of General Morgan L. Smith to move to\r\nCharleston, to which point I had previously ordered the corps of\r\nGeneral Howard.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of December all of my command in the field lay along\r\nthe Hiawassee.  Having communicated to General Grant the actual\r\nstate of affairs, I received orders to leave, on the line of the\r\nHiawassee, all the cavalry, and come to Chattanooga with the rest\r\nof my command.  I left the brigade of cavalry commanded by Colonel\r\nLong, reenforced by the Fifth Ohio Cavalry (Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nHeath)--the only cavalry properly belonging to the Fifteenth Army\r\nCorps--at Charleston, and with the remainder moved by easy marches,\r\nby Cleveland and Tyner's Depot, into Chattanooga, where I received\r\nin person from General Grant orders to transfer back to their\r\nappropriate commands the corps of General Howard and the division\r\ncommanded by General Jeff.  C. Davis, and to conduct the Fifteenth\r\nArmy Corps to its new field of operations.\r\n\r\nIt will thus appear that we have been constantly in motion since\r\nour departure from the Big Black, in Mississippi, until the present\r\nmoment.  I have been unable to receive from subordinate commanders\r\nthe usual full, detailed reports of events, and have therefore been\r\ncompelled to make up this report from my own personal memory; but,\r\nas soon as possible, subordinate reports will be received and duly\r\nforwarded.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the facts, I must do justice to the men of my command\r\nfor the patience, cheerfulness, and courage which officers and men\r\nhave displayed throughout, in battle, on the march, and in camp.\r\nFor long periods, without regular rations or supplies of any kind,\r\nthey have marched through mud and over rocks, sometimes barefooted,\r\nwithout a murmur.  Without a moment's rest after a march of over\r\nfour hundred miles, without sleep for three successive nights, we\r\ncrossed the Tennessee, fought our part of the battle of\r\nChattanooga, pursued the enemy out of Tennessee, and then turned\r\nmore than a hundred and twenty miles north and compelled Longstreet\r\nto raise the siege of Knoxville, which gave so much anxiety to the\r\nwhole country.  It is hard to realize the importance of these\r\nevents without recalling the memory of the general feeling which\r\npervaded all minds at Chattanooga prior to our arrival.  I cannot\r\nspeak of the Fifteenth Army Corps without a seeming vanity; but as\r\nI am no longer its commander, I assert that there is no better body\r\nof soldiers in America than it.  I wish all to feel a just pride in\r\nits real honors.\r\n\r\nTo General Howard and his command, to General Jeff. C. Davis and\r\nhis, I am more than usually indebted for the intelligence of\r\ncommanders and fidelity of commands.  The brigade of Colonel\r\nBushbeck, belonging to the Eleventh Corps, which was the first to\r\ncome out of Chattanooga to my flank, fought at the Tunnel Hill, in\r\nconnection with General Ewing's division, and displayed a courage\r\nalmost amounting to rashness.  Following the enemy almost to the\r\ntunnel-gorge, it lost many valuable lives, prominent among them\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Taft, spoken of as a most gallant soldier.\r\n\r\nIn General Howard throughout I found a polished and Christian\r\ngentleman, exhibiting the highest and most chivalric traits of the\r\nsoldier.  General Davis handled his division with artistic skill,\r\nmore especially at the moment we encountered the enemy's\r\nrear-guard, near Graysville, at nightfall.  I must award to this\r\ndivision the credit of the best order during our movement through\r\nEast Tennessee, when long marches and the necessity of foraging to\r\nthe right and left gave some reason for disordered ranks:\r\n\r\nInasmuch as exception may be taken to my explanation of the\r\ntemporary confusion, during the battle of Chattanooga, of the two\r\nbrigades of General Matthias and Colonel Raum, I will here state\r\nthat I saw the whole; and attach no blame to any one.  Accidents\r\nwill happen in battle, as elsewhere; and at the point where they so\r\nmanfully went to relieve the pressure on other parts of our\r\nassaulting line, they exposed themselves unconsciously to an enemy\r\nvastly superior in force, and favored by the shape of the ground.\r\nHad that enemy come out on equal terms, those brigades would have\r\nshown their mettle, which has been tried more than once before and\r\nstood the test of fire.  They reformed their ranks, and were ready\r\nto support General Ewing's division in a very few minutes; and the\r\ncircumstance would have hardly called for notice on my part, had\r\nnot others reported what was seen from Chattanooga, a distance of\r\nnearly five miles, from where could only be seen the troops in the\r\nopen field in which this affair occurred.\r\n\r\nI now subjoin the best report of casualties I am able to compile\r\nfrom the records thus far received:\r\n\r\nKilled; Wounded; and Missing...............  1949\r\n\r\nNo report from General Davis's division, but loss is small.\r\n\r\nAmong the killed were some of our most valuable officers: Colonels\r\nPutnam, Ninety-third Illinois; O'Meara, Ninetieth Illinois; and\r\nTorrence, Thirtieth Iowa; Lieutenant-Colonel-Taft, of the Eleventh\r\nCorps; and Major Bushnell, Thirteenth Illinois.\r\n\r\nAmong the wounded are Brigadier-Generals Giles A. Smith, Corse, and\r\nMatthias; Colonel Raum; Colonel Waugelin, Twelfth Missouri;\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Partridge, Thirteenth Illinois; Major P. I.\r\nWelsh, Fifty-sixth Illinois; and Major Nathan McAlla, Tenth Iowa.\r\n\r\nAmong the missing is Lieutenant-Colonel Archer, Seventeenth Iowa.\r\n\r\nMy report is already so long, that I must forbear mentioning acts\r\nof individual merit.  These will be recorded in the reports of\r\ndivision commanders, which I will cheerfully indorse; but I must\r\nsay that it is but justice that colonels of regiments, who have so\r\nlong and so well commanded brigades, as in the following cases,\r\nshould be commissioned to the grade which they have filled with so\r\nmuch usefulness and credit to the public service, viz.: Colonel J.\r\nR. Cockerell, Seventieth, Ohio; Colonel J. M. Loomis, Twenty-sixth\r\nIllinois; Colonel C. C. Walcutt, Forty-sixth Ohio; Colonel J. A.\r\nWilliamson, Fourth Iowa; Colonel G. B. Raum, Fifty-sixth Illinois;\r\nColonel J. I. Alexander, Fifty-ninth Indiana.\r\n\r\nMy personal staff, as usual, have served their country with\r\nfidelity, and credit to themselves, throughout these events, and\r\nhave received my personal thanks.\r\n\r\nInclosed you will please find a map of that part of the\r\nbattle-field of Chattanooga fought over by the troops under my\r\ncommand, surveyed and drawn by Captain Jenney, engineer on my\r\nstaff.  I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Order No. 68.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE\r\nWASHINGTON, February 21, 1884\r\n\r\nJoint resolution tendering the thanks of Congress to Major-General\r\nW. T. Sherman and others.\r\n\r\nBe it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled, That the thanks of\r\nCongress and of the people of the United States are due, and that\r\nthe same are hereby tendered, to Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\ncommander of the Department and Army of the Tennessee, and the\r\nofficers and soldiers who served under him, for their gallant and\r\narduous services in marching to the relief of the Army of the\r\nCumberland, and for their gallantry and heroism in the battle of\r\nChattanooga, which contributed in a great degree to the success of\r\nour arms in that glorious victory.\r\n\r\nApproved February 19, 1864.\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nE. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of December I was at Bridgeport, and gave all the\r\norders necessary for the distribution of the four divisions of the\r\nFifteenth Corps along the railroad from Stevenson to Decatur, and\r\nthe part of the Sixteenth Corps; commanded by General Dodge, along\r\nthe railroad from Decatur to Nashville, to make the needed repairs,\r\nand to be in readiness for the campaign of the succeeding year; and\r\non the 21st I went up to Nashville, to confer with General Grant\r\nand conclude the arrangements for the winter.  At that time General\r\nGrant was under the impression that the next campaign would be up\r\nthe valley of East Tennessee, in the direction of Virginia; and as\r\nit was likely to be the last and most important campaign of the\r\nwar, it became necessary to set free as many of the old troops\r\nserving along the Mississippi River as possible.  This was the real\r\nobject and purpose of the Meridian campaign, and of Banks's\r\nexpedition up Red River to Shreveport during that winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMERIDIAN CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nJANUARY AND FEBRUARY, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1863-'64 opened very cold and severe; and it was\r\nmanifest after the battle of Chattanooga, November 25, 1863, and\r\nthe raising of the siege of Knoxville, December 5th, that military\r\noperations in that quarter must in a measure cease, or be limited\r\nto Burnside's force beyond Knoxville.  On the 21st of December\r\nGeneral Grant had removed his headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee,\r\nleaving General George H. Thomas at Chattanooga, in command of the\r\nDepartment of the Cumberland, and of the army round about that\r\nplace; and I was at Bridgeport, with orders to distribute my troops\r\nalong the railroad from Stevenson to Decatur, Alabama, and from\r\nDecatur up toward Nashville.\r\n\r\nGeneral G. M. Dodge, who was in command of the detachment of the\r\nSixteenth Corps, numbering about eight thousand men, had not\r\nparticipated with us in the battle of Chattanooga, but had remained\r\nat and near Pulaski, Tennessee, engaged in repairing that railroad,\r\nas auxiliary to the main line which led from Nashville to\r\nStevenson, and Chattanooga.  General John A. Logan had succeeded to\r\nthe command of the Fifteenth Corps, by regular appointment of the\r\nPresident of the United States, and had relieved General Frank P.\r\nBlair, who had been temporarily in command of that corps during the\r\nChattanooga and Knoxville movement.\r\n\r\nAt that time I was in command of the Department of the Tennessee,\r\nwhich embraced substantially the territory on the east bank of the\r\nMississippi River, from Natchez up to the Ohio River, and thence\r\nalong the Tennessee River as high as Decatur and Bellefonte,\r\nAlabama.  General McPherson was at Vicksburg and General Hurlbut at\r\nMemphis, and from them I had the regular reports of affairs in that\r\nquarter of my command.  The rebels still maintained a considerable\r\nforce of infantry and cavalry in the State of Mississippi,\r\nthreatening the river, whose navigation had become to us so\r\ndelicate and important a matter.  Satisfied that I could check this\r\nby one or two quick moves inland, and thereby set free a\r\nconsiderable body of men held as local garrisons, I went up to\r\nNashville and represented the case to General Grant, who consented\r\nthat I might go down the Mississippi River, where the bulk of my\r\ncommand lay, and strike a blow on the east of the river, while\r\nGeneral Banks from New Orleans should in like manner strike another\r\nto the west; thus preventing any further molestation of the boats\r\nnavigating the main river, and thereby widening the gap in the\r\nSouthern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nAfter having given all the necessary orders for the distribution,\r\nduring the winter months, of that part of my command which was in\r\nSouthern and Middle Tennessee, I went to Cincinnati and Lancaster,\r\nOhio, to spend Christmas with my family; and on my return I took\r\nMinnie with me down to a convent at Reading, near Cincinnati, where\r\nI left her, and took the cars for Cairo, Illinois, which I reached\r\nJanuary 3d, a very cold and bitter day.  The ice was forming fast,\r\nand there was great danger that the Mississippi River, would become\r\nclosed to navigation.  Admiral Porter, who was at Cairo, gave me a\r\nsmall gunboat (the Juliet), with which I went up to Paducah, to\r\ninspect that place, garrisoned by a small force; commanded by\r\nColonel S. G. Hicks, Fortieth Illinois, who had been with me and\r\nwas severely wounded at Shiloh.  Returning to Cairo, we started\r\ndown the Mississippi River, which was full of floating ice.  With\r\nthe utmost difficulty we made our way through it, for hours\r\nfloating in the midst of immense cakes, that chafed and ground our\r\nboat so that at times we were in danger of sinking.  But about the\r\n10th of January we reached Memphis, where I found General Hurlbut,\r\nand explained to him my purpose to collect from his garrisons and\r\nthose of McPherson about twenty thousand men, with which in\r\nFebruary to march out from Vicksburg as far as Meridian, break up\r\nthe Mobile & Ohio Railroad, and also the one leading from Vicksburg\r\nto Selma, Alabama.  I instructed him to select two good divisions,\r\nand to be ready with them to go along.  At Memphis I found\r\nBrigadier-General W. Sooy Smith, with a force of about twenty-five\r\nhundred cavalry, which he had by General Grant's orders brought\r\nacross from Middle Tennessee, to assist in our general purpose, as\r\nwell as to punish the rebel General Forrest, who had been most\r\nactive in harassing our garrisons in West Tennessee and\r\nMississippi.  After staying a couple of days at Memphis, we\r\ncontinued on in the gunboat Silver Cloud to Vicksburg, where I\r\nfound General McPherson, and, giving him similar orders, instructed\r\nhim to send out spies to ascertain and bring back timely\r\ninformation of the strength and location of the enemy.  The winter\r\ncontinued so severe that the river at Vicksburg was full of\r\nfloating ice, but in the Silver Cloud we breasted it manfully, and\r\ngot back to Memphis by the 20th.  A chief part of the enterprise\r\nwas to destroy the rebel cavalry commanded by General Forrest, who\r\nwere a constant threat to our railway communications in Middle\r\nTennessee, and I committed this task to Brigadier-General W. Sooy\r\nSmith.  General Hurlbut had in his command about seven thousand\r\nfive hundred cavalry, scattered from Columbus, Kentucky, to\r\nCorinth, Mississippi, and we proposed to make up an aggregate\r\ncavalry force of about seven thousand \"effective,\" out of these and\r\nthe twenty-five hundred which General Smith had brought with him\r\nfrom Middle Tennessee.  With this force General Smith was ordered\r\nto move from Memphis straight for Meridian, Mississippi, and to\r\nstart by February 1st.  I explained to him personally the nature of\r\nForrest as a man, and of his peculiar force; told him that in his\r\nroute he was sure to encounter Forrest, who always attacked with a\r\nvehemence for which he must be prepared, and that, after he had\r\nrepelled the first attack, he must in turn assume  the most\r\ndetermined offensive, overwhelm him and utterly destroy his whole\r\nforce.  I knew that Forrest could not have more than four thousand\r\ncavalry, and my own movement would give employment to every other\r\nman of the rebel army not immediately present with him, so that he\r\n(General Smith) might safely act on the hypothesis I have stated.\r\n\r\nHaving completed all these preparations in Memphis, being satisfied\r\nthat the cavalry force would be ready to start by the 1st of\r\nFebruary, and having seen General Hurlbut with his two divisions\r\nembark in steamers for Vicksburg, I also reembarked for the same\r\ndestination on the 27th of January.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February we rendezvoused in Vicksburg, where I found\r\na spy who had been sent out two weeks before, had been to Meridian,\r\nand brought back correct information of the state of facts in the\r\ninterior of Mississippi.  Lieutenant-General (Bishop) Polk was in\r\nchief command, with headquarters at Meridian, and had two divisions\r\nof infantry, one of which (General Loring's) was posted at Canton,\r\nMississippi, the other (General French's) at Brandon.  He had also\r\ntwo divisions of cavalry--Armstrong's, composed of the three\r\nbrigades of Ross, Stark, and Wirt Adams, which were scattered from\r\nthe neighborhood of Yazoo City to Jackson and below; and Forrest's,\r\nwhich was united, toward Memphis, with headquarters at Como.\r\nGeneral Polk seemed to have no suspicion of our intentions to\r\ndisturb his serenity.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morning of February 3d, we started in two\r\ncolumns, each of two divisions, preceded by a light force of\r\ncavalry, commanded by Colonel E. F. Winslow.  General McPherson\r\ncommanded the right column, and General Hurlbut the left.  The\r\nformer crossed the Big Black at the railroad-bridge, and the latter\r\nseven miles above, at Messinger's.  We were lightly equipped as to\r\nwagons, and marched without deployment straight for Meridian,\r\ndistant one hundred and fifty miles.  We struck the rebel cavalry\r\nbeyond the Big Black, and pushed them pell-mell into and beyond\r\nJackson during the 6th.  The next day we reached Brandon, and on\r\nthe 9th Morton, where we perceived signs of an infantry\r\nconcentration, but the enemy did not give us battle, and retreated\r\nbefore us.  The rebel cavalry were all around us, so we kept our\r\ncolumns compact and offered few or no chances for their dashes.  As\r\nfar as Morton we had occupied two roads, but there we were forced\r\ninto one.  Toward evening of the 12th, Hurlbut's column passed\r\nthrough Decatur, with orders to go into camp four miles beyond at a\r\ncreek.  McPherson's head of column was some four miles behind, and\r\nI personally detached one of Hurlbut's regiments to guard the\r\ncross-roads at Decatur till the head of McPherson's column should\r\ncome in sight.  Intending to spend the night in Decatur, I went to\r\na double log-house, and arranged with the lady for some supper.  We\r\nunsaddled our horses, tied them to the fence inside the yard, and,\r\nbeing tired, I lay down on a bed and fell asleep.  Presently I\r\nheard shouts and hallooing, and then heard pistol-shots close to\r\nthe house.  My aide, Major Audenried, called me and said we were\r\nattacked by rebel cavalry, who were all around us.  I jumped up and\r\ninquired where was the regiment of infantry I had myself posted at\r\nthe cross-roads.  He said a few moments before it had marched past\r\nthe house, following the road by which General Hurlbut had gone,\r\nand I told him to run, overtake it, and bring it back.  Meantime, I\r\nwent out into the back-yard, saw wagons passing at a run down the\r\nroad, and horsemen dashing about in a cloud of dust, firing their\r\npistols, their shots reaching the house in which we were.\r\nGathering the few orderlies and clerks that were about, I was\r\npreparing to get into a corn-crib at the back side of the lot,\r\nwherein to defend ourselves, when I saw Audenried coming back with\r\nthe regiment, on a run, deploying forward as they came.  This\r\nregiment soon cleared the place and drove the rebel cavalry back\r\ntoward the south, whence they had come.\r\n\r\nIt transpired that the colonel of this infantry regiment, whose\r\nname I do not recall, had seen some officers of McPherson's staff\r\n(among them Inspector-General Strong) coming up the road at a\r\ngallop, raising a cloud of duet; supposing them to be the head of\r\nMcPherson's column, and being anxious to get into camp before dark,\r\nhe had called in his pickets and started down the road, leaving me\r\nperfectly exposed.  Some straggling wagons, escorted by a New\r\nJersey regiment, were passing at the time, and composed the rear of\r\nHurlbut's train.  The rebel cavalry, seeing the road clear of\r\ntroops, and these wagons passing, struck them in flank, shot down\r\nthe mules of three or four wagons, broke the column, and began a\r\ngeneral skirmish.  The escort defended their wagons as well as they\r\ncould, and thus diverted their attention; otherwise I would surely\r\nhave been captured.  In a short time the head of McPherson's column\r\ncame up, went into camp, and we spent the night in Decatur.\r\n\r\nThe next day we pushed on, and on the 14th entered Meridian, the\r\nenemy retreating before us toward Demopolis, Alabama.  We at once\r\nset to work to destroy an arsenal, immense storehouses, and the\r\nrailroad in every direction.  We staid in Meridian five days,\r\nexpecting every hour to hear of General Sooy Smith, but could get\r\nno tidings of him whatever.  A large force of infantry was kept at\r\nwork all the time in breaking up the Mobile & Ohio Railroad south\r\nand north; also the Jackson & Selma Railroad, east and west.  I was\r\ndetermined to damage these roads so that they could not be used\r\nagain for hostile purposes during the rest of the war.  I never had\r\nthe remotest idea of going to Mobile, but had purposely given out\r\nthat idea to the people of the country, so as to deceive the enemy\r\nand to divert their attention.  Many persons still insist that,\r\nbecause we did not go to Mobile on this occasion, I had failed; but\r\nin the following letter to General Banks, of January 31st, written\r\nfrom Vicksburg before starting for Meridian, it will be seen\r\nclearly that I indicated my intention to keep up the delusion of an\r\nattack on Mobile by land, whereas I promised him to be back to\r\nVicksburg by the 1st of March, so as to cooperate with him in his\r\ncontemplated attack on Shreveport:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nVICKSBURG, January 31, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General N. P. BANKS, commanding Department of the Gulf, New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I received yesterday, at the hands of Captain Durham,\r\naide-de-camp, your letter of the 25th inst., and hasten to reply.\r\nCaptain Durham has gone to the mouth of White River, en route for\r\nLittle Rock, and the other officers who accompanied him have gone\r\nup to Cairo, as I understand, to charter twenty-five steamboats for\r\nthe Red River trip.  The Mississippi River, though low for the\r\nseason, is free of ice and in good boating order; but I understand\r\nthat Red River is still low.  I had a man in from Alexandria\r\nyesterday, who reported the falls or rapids at that place\r\nimpassable save by the smallest boats.  My inland expedition is now\r\nmoving, and I will be off for Jackson and Meridian to-morrow.  The\r\nonly fear I have is in the weather.  All the other combinations are\r\ngood.  I want to keep up the delusion of an attack on Mobile and\r\nthe Alabama River, and therefore would be obliged if you would keep\r\nup an irritating foraging or other expedition in that direction.\r\n\r\nMy orders from General Grant will not, as yet, justify me in\r\nembarking for Red River, though I am very anxious to move in that\r\ndirection.  The moment I learned that you were preparing for it, I\r\nsent a communication to Admiral Porter, and dispatched to General\r\nGrant at Chattanooga, asking if he wanted me and Steele to\r\ncooperate with you against Shreveport; and I will have his answer\r\nin time, for you cannot do any thing till Red River has twelve feet\r\nof water on the rapids at Alexandria.  That will be from March to\r\nJune.  I have lived on Red River, and know somewhat of the phases\r\nof that stream.  The expedition on Shreveport should be made\r\nrapidly, with simultaneous movements from Little Rock on\r\nShreveport, from Opelousas on Alexandria, and a combined force of\r\ngunboats and transports directly up Red River.  Admiral Porter will\r\nbe able to have a splendid fleet by March 1st.  I think Steele\r\ncould move with ten thousand infantry and five thousand cavalry.  I\r\ncould take about ten thousand, and you could, I suppose, have the\r\nsame.  Your movement from Opelousas, simultaneous with mine up the\r\nriver, would compel Dick Taylor to leave Fort De Russy (near\r\nMarksville), and the whole combined force could appear at\r\nShreveport about a day appointed beforehand.\r\n\r\nI doubt if the enemy will risk a siege at Shreveport, although I am\r\ninformed they are fortifying the place, and placing many heavy guns\r\nin position.  It would be better for us that they should stand\r\nthere, as we might make large and important captures.  But I do not\r\nbelieve the enemy will fight a force of thirty thousand men, acting\r\nin concert with gunboats.\r\n\r\nI will be most happy to take part in the proposed expedition, and\r\nhope, before you have made your final dispositions, that I will\r\nhave the necessary permission.  Half the Army of the Tennessee is\r\nnear the Tennessee River, beyond Huntsville, Alabama, awaiting the\r\ncompletion of the railroad, and, by present orders, I will be\r\ncompelled to hasten there to command it in person, unless meantime\r\nGeneral Grant modifies the plan.  I have now in this department\r\nonly the force left to hold the river and the posts, and I am\r\nseriously embarrassed by the promises made the veteran volunteers\r\nfor furlough.  I think, by March 1st, I can put afloat for\r\nShreveport ten thousand men, provided I succeed in my present\r\nmovement in cleaning out the State of Mississippi, and in breaking\r\nup the railroads about Meridian.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General, commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the Meridian expedition was to strike the roads\r\ninland, so to paralyze the rebel forces that we could take from the\r\ndefense of the Mississippi River the equivalent of a corps of\r\ntwenty thousand men, to be used in the next Georgia campaign; and\r\nthis was actually done.  At the same time, I wanted to destroy\r\nGeneral Forrest, who, with an irregular force of cavalry, was\r\nconstantly threatening Memphis and the river above, as well as our\r\nroutes of supply in Middle Tennessee.  In this we failed utterly,\r\nbecause General W. Sooy Smith did not fulfill his orders, which\r\nwere clear and specific, as contained in my letter of instructions\r\nto him of January 27th, at Memphis, and my personal explanations to\r\nhim at the same time.  Instead of starting at the date ordered,\r\nFebruary 1st, he did not leave Memphis till the 11th, waiting for\r\nWarings brigade that was ice-bound near Columbus, Kentucky; and\r\nthen, when he did start, he allowed General Forrest to head him off\r\nand to defeat him with an inferior force, near West Point, below\r\nOkalona, on the Mobile & Ohio Railroad.\r\n\r\nWe waited at Meridian till the 20th to hear from General Smith, but\r\nhearing nothing whatever, and having utterly destroyed the\r\nrailroads in and around that junction, I ordered General McPherson\r\nto move back slowly toward Canton.  With Winslow's cavalry, and\r\nHurlbut's infantry, I turned north to Marion, and thence to a place\r\ncalled \"Union,\" whence I dispatched the cavalry farther north to\r\nPhiladelphia and Louisville, to feel as it were for General Smith,\r\nand then turned all the infantry columns toward Canton,\r\nMississippi.  On the 26th we all reached Canton, but we had not\r\nheard a word of General Smith, nor was it until some time after (at\r\nVicksburg) that I learned the whole truth of General Smith's\r\nmovement and of his failure.  Of course I did not and could not\r\napprove of his conduct, and I know that he yet chafes under the\r\ncensure.  I had set so much store on his part of the project that I\r\nwas disappointed, and so reported officially to General Grant.\r\nGeneral Smith never regained my confidence as a soldier, though I\r\nstill regard him as a most accomplished gentleman and a skillful\r\nengineer.  Since the close of the war he has appealed to me to\r\nrelieve him of that censure, but I could not do it, because it\r\nwould falsify history.\r\n\r\nHaving assembled all my troops in and about Canton, on the 27th of\r\nFebruary I left them under the command of the senior major-general,\r\nHurlbut, with orders to remain till about the 3d of March, and then\r\nto come into Vicksburg leisurely; and, escorted by Winslow's\r\ncavalry, I rode into Vicksburg on the last day of February.  There\r\nI found letters from General Grant, at Nashville, and General\r\nBanks, at New Orleans, concerning his (General Banks's) projected\r\nmovement up Red River.  I was authorized by the former to\r\ncontribute aid to General Banks for a limited time; but General\r\nGrant insisted on my returning in person to my own command about\r\nHuntsville, Alabama, as soon as possible, to prepare for the spring\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we were much embarrassed by a general order of the\r\nWar Department, promising a thirty-days furlough to all soldiers\r\nwho would  \"veteranize\"--viz., reenlist for the rest of the war.\r\nThis was a judicious and wise measure, because it doubtless secured\r\nthe services of a very large portion of the men who had almost\r\ncompleted a three-years enlistment, and were therefore veteran\r\nsoldiers in feeling and in habit.  But to furlough so many of our\r\nmen at that instant of time was like disbanding an army in the very\r\nmidst of battle.\r\n\r\nIn order to come to a perfect understanding with General Banks, I\r\ntook the steamer Diana and ran down to New Orleans to see him.\r\nAmong the many letters which I found in Vicksburg on my return from\r\nMeridian was one from Captain D. F. Boyd, of Louisiana, written\r\nfrom the jail in Natchez, telling me that he was a prisoner of war\r\nin our hands; had been captured in Louisiana by some of our scouts;\r\nand he bespoke my friendly assistance.  Boyd was Professor of\r\nAncient Languages at the Louisiana Seminary of Learning during my\r\nadministration, in 1859-'60; was an accomplished scholar, of\r\nmoderate views in politics, but, being a Virginian, was drawn, like\r\nall others of his kind, into the vortex of the rebellion by the\r\nevents of 1861, which broke up colleges and every thing at the\r\nSouth.  Natchez, at this time, was in my command, and was held by a\r\nstrong division, commanded by Brigadier-General J. W. Davidson.  In\r\nthe Diana we stopped at Natchez, and I made a hasty inspection of\r\nthe place.  I sent for Boyd, who was in good health, but quite\r\ndirty, and begged me to take him out of prison, and to effect his\r\nexchange.  I receipted for him; took him along with me to New\r\nOrleans; offered him money, which he declined; allowed him to go\r\nfree in the city; and obtained from General Banks a promise to\r\neffect his exchange, which was afterward done.  Boyd is now my\r\nlegitimate successor in Louisiana, viz., President of the Louisiana\r\nUniversity, which is the present title of what had been the\r\nSeminary of Learning.  After the war was over, Boyd went back to\r\nAlexandria, reorganized the old institution, which I visited in\r\n1866 but the building was burnt down by an accident or by an\r\nincendiary about 1868, and the institution was then removed to\r\nBaton Rouge, where it now is, under its new title of the University\r\nof Louisiana.\r\n\r\nWe reached New Orleans on the 2d of March.  I found General Banks,\r\nwith his wife and daughter, living in a good house, and he\r\nexplained to me fully the position and strength of his troops, and\r\nhis plans of action for the approaching campaign.  I dined with\r\nhim, and, rough as I was--just out of the woods--attended, that\r\nnight, a very pleasant party at the house of a lady, whose name I\r\ncannot recall, but who is now the wife of Captain Arnold, Fifth\r\nUnited States Artillery.  At this party were also Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrank Howe.  I found New Orleans much changed since I had been\r\nfamiliar with it in 1853 and in 1860-'61.  It was full of officers\r\nand soldiers.  Among the former were General T. W. Sherman, who had\r\nlost a leg at Port Hudson, and General Charles P: Stone, whom I\r\nknew so well in California, and who is now in the Egyptian service\r\nas chief of staff.  The bulk of General Banks's army was about\r\nOpelousas, under command of General Franklin, ready to move on\r\nAlexandria.  General Banks seemed to be all ready, but intended to\r\ndelay his departure a few days to assist in the inauguration of a\r\ncivil government for Louisiana, under Governor Hahn.  In Lafayette\r\nSquare I saw the arrangements of scaffolding for the fireworks and\r\nbenches for the audience.  General Banks urged me to remain over\r\nthe 4th of March, to participate in the ceremonies, which he\r\nexplained would include the performance of the \"Anvil Chorus\" by\r\nall the bands of his army, and during the performance the\r\nchurch-bells were to be rung, and cannons were to be fired by\r\nelectricity.  I regarded all such ceremonies as out of place at a\r\ntime when it seemed to me every hour and every minute were due to\r\nthe war.  General Banks's movement, however, contemplated my\r\nsending a force of ten thousand men in boats up Red River from\r\nVicksburg, and that a junction should occur at Alexandria by March\r\n17th.  I therefore had no time to wait for the grand pageant of the\r\n4th of March, but took my departure from New Orleans in the Diana\r\nthe evening of March 3d.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, March 4th, I wrote to General Banks a letter,\r\nwhich was extremely minute in conveying to him how far I felt\r\nauthorized to go under my orders from General Grant.  At that time\r\nGeneral Grant commanded the Military Division of the Mississippi,\r\nembracing my own Department of the  Tennessee and that of General\r\nSteele in Arkansas, but not that of General Banks in Louisiana.\r\nGeneral Banks was acting on his own powers, or under the\r\ninstructions of General Halleck in Washington, and our assistance\r\nto him was designed as a loan of ten thousand men for a period of\r\nthirty days.  The instructions of March 6th to General A. J. Smith,\r\nwho commanded this detachment, were full and explicit on this\r\npoint.  The Diana reached Vicksburg on the 6th, where I found that\r\nthe expeditionary army had come in from Canton.  One division of\r\nfive thousand men was made up out of Hurlbut's command, and placed\r\nunder Brigadier-General T. Kilby Smith; and a similar division was\r\nmade out of McPherson's and Hurlbut's troops, and placed under\r\nBrigadier-General Joseph A. Mower; the whole commanded by\r\nBrigadier-General A. J. Smith.  General Hurlbut, with the rest of\r\nhis command, returned to Memphis, and General McPherson remained at\r\nVicksburg.  General A. J. Smith's command was in due season\r\nembarked, and proceeded to Red River, which it ascended, convoyed\r\nby Admiral Porter's fleet.  General Mower's division was landed\r\nnear the outlet of the Atchafalaya, marched up by land and captured\r\nthe fort below Alexandria known as Fort De Russy, and the whole\r\nfleet then proceeded up to Alexandria, reaching it on the day\r\nappointed, viz., March 17th, where it waited for the arrival of\r\nGeneral Banks, who, however, did not come till some days after.\r\nThese two divisions participated in the whole of General Banks's\r\nunfortunate Red River expedition, and were delayed so long up Red\r\nRiver, and subsequently on the Mississippi, that they did not share\r\nwith their comrades the successes and glories of the Atlanta\r\ncampaign, for which I had designed them; and, indeed, they, did not\r\njoin our army till just in time to assist General George H. Thomas\r\nto defeat General Hood before Nashville, on the 15th and 16th of\r\nDecember, 1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's letter of instructions, which was brought me by\r\nGeneral Butterfield, who had followed me to New Orleans, enjoined\r\non me, after concluding with General Banks the details for his Red\r\nRiver expedition, to make all necessary arrangements for\r\nfurloughing the men entitled to that privilege, and to hurry back\r\nto the army at Huntsville, Alabama.  I accordingly gave the\r\nnecessary orders to General McPherson, at Vicksburg, and continued\r\nup the river toward Memphis.  On our way we met Captain Badeau, of\r\nGeneral Grant's staff, bearing the following letter, of March 4th,\r\nwhich I answered on the 10th, and sent the answer by General\r\nButterfield, who had accompanied me up from New Orleans.  Copies of\r\nboth were also sent to General McPherson, at Vicksburg:\r\n\r\n[Private.]\r\n\r\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, March 4, 1864\r\n\r\nDEAR SHERMAN: The bill reviving the grade of lieutenant-general in\r\nthe army has become a law, and my name has been sent to the Senate\r\nfor the place.\r\n\r\nI now receive orders to report at Washington immediately, in\r\nperson, which indicates either a confirmation or a likelihood of\r\nconfirmation.  I start in the morning to comply with the order, but\r\nI shall say very distinctly on my arrival there that I shall accept\r\nno appointment which will require me to make that city my\r\nheadquarters.  This, however, is not what I started out to write\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWhile I have been eminently successful in this war, in at least\r\ngaining the confidence of the public, no one feels more than I how\r\nmuch of this success is due to the energy, skill, and the\r\nharmonious putting forth of that energy and skill, of those whom it\r\nhas been my good fortune to have occupying subordinate positions\r\nunder me.\r\n\r\nThere are many officers to whom these remarks are applicable to a\r\ngreater or less degree, proportionate to their ability as soldiers;\r\nbut what I want is to express my thanks to you and McPherson, as\r\nthe men to whom, above all others, I feel indebted for whatever I\r\nhave had of success.  How far your advice and suggestions have been\r\nof assistance, you know.  How far your execution of whatever has\r\nbeen given you to do entitles you to the reward I am receiving, you\r\ncannot know as well as I do.  I feel all the gratitude this letter\r\nwould express, giving it the most flattering construction.\r\n\r\nThe word you I use in the plural, intending it for McPherson also.\r\nI should write to him, and will some day, but, starting in the\r\nmorning, I do not know that I will find time just now.  Your\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL]\r\n\r\nNEAR MEMPHIS, March 10, 1864\r\n\r\nGeneral GRANT.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: I have your more than kind and characteristic letter\r\nof the 4th, and will send a copy of it to General McPherson at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nYou do yourself injustice and us too much honor in assigning to us\r\nso large a share of the merits which have led to your high\r\nadvancement.  I know you approve the friendship I have ever\r\nprofessed to you, and will permit me to continue as heretofore to\r\nmanifest it on all proper occasions.\r\n\r\nYou are now Washington's legitimate successor, and occupy a\r\nposition of almost dangerous elevation; but if you can continue as\r\nheretofore to be yourself, simple, honest, and unpretending, you\r\nwill enjoy through life the respect and love of friends, and the\r\nhomage of millions of human beings who will award to you a large\r\nshare for securing to them and their descendants a government of\r\nlaw and stability.\r\n\r\nI repeat, you do General McPherson and myself too much honor.  At\r\nBelmont you manifested your traits, neither of us being near; at\r\nDonelson also you illustrated your whole character.  I was not\r\nnear, and General McPherson in too subordinate a capacity to\r\ninfluence you.\r\n\r\nUntil you had won Donelson, I confess I was almost cowed by the\r\nterrible array of anarchical elements that presented themselves at\r\nevery point; but that victory admitted the ray of light which I\r\nhave followed ever since.\r\n\r\nI believe you are as brave, patriotic, and just, as the great\r\nprototype Washington; as unselfish, kind-hearted, and honest, as a\r\nman should be; but the chief characteristic in your nature is the\r\nsimple faith in success you have always manifested, which I can\r\nliken to nothing else than the faith a Christian has in his\r\nSaviour.\r\n\r\nThis faith gave you victory at Shiloh and Vicksburg.  Also, when\r\nyou have completed your best preparations, you go into battle\r\nwithout hesitation, as at Chattanooga--no doubts, no reserve; and I\r\ntell you that it was this that made us act with confidence.  I knew\r\nwherever I was that you thought of me, and if I got in a tight\r\nplace you would come--if alive.\r\n\r\nMy only points of doubt were as to your knowledge of grand\r\nstrategy, and of books of science and history; but I confess your\r\ncommon-sense seems to have supplied all this.\r\n\r\nNow as to the future.  Do not stay in Washington.  Halleck is\r\nbetter qualified than you are to stand the buffets of intrigue and\r\npolicy.  Come out West; take to yourself the whole Mississippi\r\nValley; let us make it dead-sure, and I tell you the Atlantic slope\r\nand Pacific shores will follow its destiny as sure as the limbs of\r\na tree live or die with the main trunk!  We have done much; still\r\nmuch remains to be done.  Time and time's influences are all with\r\nus; we could almost afford to sit still and let these influences\r\nwork.  Even in the seceded States your word now would go further\r\nthan a President's proclamation, or an act of Congress.\r\n\r\nFor God's sake and for your country's sake, come out of Washington!\r\nI foretold to General Halleck, before he left Corinth, the\r\ninevitable result to him, and I now exhort you to come out West.\r\nHere lies the seat of the coming empire; and from the West, when\r\nour task is done, we will make short work of Charleston and\r\nRichmond, and the impoverished coast of the Atlantic.  Your sincere\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached Memphis on the 13th, where I remained some days, but on\r\nthe 14th of March received from General Grant a dispatch to hurry\r\nto Nashville in person by the 17th, if possible.  Disposing of all\r\nmatters then pending, I took a steamboat to Cairo, the cars thence\r\nto Louisville and Nashville, reaching that place on the 17th of\r\nMarch, 1864.\r\n\r\nI found General Grant there.  He had been to Washington and back,\r\nand was ordered to return East to command all the armies of the\r\nUnited States, and personally the Army of the Potomac.  I was to\r\nsucceed him in command of the Military Division of the Mississippi,\r\nembracing the Departments of the Ohio, Cumberland, Tennessee, and\r\nArkansas.  General Grant was of course very busy in winding up all\r\nmatters of business, in transferring his command to me, and in\r\npreparing for what was manifest would be the great and closing\r\ncampaign of our civil war.  Mrs. Grant and some of their children\r\nwere with him, and occupied a large house in Nashville, which was\r\nused as an office, dwelling, and every thing combined.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March I had issued orders assuming command of the\r\nMilitary Division of the Mississippi, and was seated in the office,\r\nwhen the general came in and said they were about to present him a\r\nsword, inviting me to come and see the ceremony.  I went back into\r\nwhat was the dining-room of the house; on the table lay a rose-wood\r\nbox, containing a sword, sash, spurs, etc., and round about the\r\ntable were grouped Mrs. Grant, Nelly, and one or two of the boys.\r\nI was introduced to a large, corpulent gentleman, as the mayor, and\r\nanother citizen, who had come down from Galena to make this\r\npresentation of a sword to their fellow-townsman.  I think that\r\nRawlins, Bowers, Badeau, and one or more of General Grant's\r\npersonal staff, were present.  The mayor rose and in the most\r\ndignified way read a finished speech to General Grant, who stood,\r\nas usual, very awkwardly; and the mayor closed his speech by\r\nhanding him the resolutions of the City Council engrossed on\r\nparchment, with a broad ribbon and large seal attached.  After the\r\nmayor had fulfilled his office so well, General Grant said: \"Mr.\r\nMayor, as I knew that this ceremony was to occur, and as I am not\r\nused to speaking, I have written something in reply.\"  He then\r\nbegan to fumble in his pockets, first his breast-coat pocket, then\r\nhis pants, vest; etc., and after considerable delay he pulled out a\r\ncrumpled piece of common yellow cartridge-paper, which he handed to\r\nthe mayor.  His whole manner was awkward in the extreme, yet\r\nperfectly characteristic, and in strong contrast with the elegant\r\nparchment and speech of the mayor.  When read, however, the\r\nsubstance of his answer was most excellent, short, concise, and, if\r\nit had been delivered by word of mouth, would have been all that\r\nthe occasion required.\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at a scene so characteristic of the man\r\nwho then stood prominent before the country; and to whom all had\r\nturned as the only one qualified to guide the nation in a war that\r\nhad become painfully critical.  With copies of the few letters\r\nreferred to, and which seem necessary to illustrate the\r\nsubject-matter, I close this chapter:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nSTEAMER DIANA (UNDER WEIGH), March 4, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General N. P. BANKS, commanding Department of the Gulf, New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I had the honor to receive your letter of the 2d instant\r\nyesterday at New Orleans, but was unable to answer, except\r\nverbally, and I now reduce it to writing.\r\n\r\nI will arrive at Vicksburg the 6th instant, and I expect to meet\r\nthere my command from Canton, out of which I will select two\r\ndivisions of about ten thousand men, embark them under a good\r\ncommander, and order him:\r\n\r\n1st. To rendezvous at the mouth of Red River, and, in concert with\r\nAdmiral Porter (if he agree), to strike Harrisonburg a hard blow.\r\n\r\n2d.  To return to Red River and ascend it, aiming to reach\r\nAlexandria on the 17th of March, to report to you.\r\n\r\n3d.  That, as this command is designed to operate by water, it will\r\nnot be encumbered with much land transportation, say two wagons to\r\na regiment, but with an ample supply of stores, including mortars\r\nand heavy rifled guns, to be used against fortified places.\r\n\r\n4th.  That I have calculated, and so reported to General Grant,\r\nthat this detachment of his forces in no event is to go beyond\r\nShreveport, and that you will spare them the moment you can, trying\r\nto get them back to the Mississippi River in thirty days from the\r\ntime they actually enter Red River.\r\n\r\nThe year is wearing away fast, and I would like to carry to General\r\nGrant at Huntsville, Alabama, every man of his military division,\r\nas early in April as possible, for I am sure we ought to move from\r\nthe base of the Tennessee River to the south before the season is\r\ntoo far advanced, say as early as April 15th next.\r\n\r\nI feel certain of your complete success, provided you make the\r\nconcentration in time, to assure which I will see in person to the\r\nembarkation and dispatch of my quota, and I will write to General\r\nSteele, conveying to him my personal and professional opinion that\r\nthe present opportunity is the most perfect one that will ever\r\noffer itself to him to clean out his enemies in Arkansas.\r\n\r\nWishing you all honor and success, I am, with respect, your friend\r\nand servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nVICKSBURG, March 6, 1864\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General A. J. SMITH, commanding Expedition up Red River,\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: By an order this day issued, you are to command a strong,\r\nwell-appointed detachment of the Army of the Tennessee, sent to\r\nreinforce a movement up Red River, but more especially against the\r\nfortified position at Shreveport.\r\n\r\nYou will embark your command as soon as possible, little encumbered\r\nwith wagons or wheeled vehicles, but well supplied with fuel,\r\nprovisions, and ammunition.  Take with you the twelve mortars,\r\nwith their ammunition, and all the thirty-pound Parrotts the\r\nordnance-officer will supply.  Proceed to the mouth of Red River\r\nand confer with Admiral Porter.  Consult with him, and in all the\r\nexpedition rely on him implicitly, as he is the approved friend of\r\nthe Army of the Tennessee, and has been associated with us from the\r\nbeginning. I have undertaken with General Banks that you will be at\r\nAlexandria, Louisiana, on or before the 17th day of March; and you\r\nwill, if time allows, cooperate with the navy in destroying\r\nHarrisonburg, up Black River; but as I passed Red River yesterday I\r\nsaw Admiral Porter, and he told me he had already sent an expedition\r\nto Harrisonburg, so that I suppose that part of the plan will be\r\naccomplished before you reach Red River; but, in any event, be\r\ncareful to reach Alexandria about the 17th of March.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks will start by land from Franklin, in the Teche\r\ncountry, either the 6th or 7th, and will march via Opelousas to\r\nAlexandria.  You will meet him there, report to him, and act under\r\nhis orders.  My understanding with him is that his forces will move\r\nby land, via Natchitoches, to Shreveport, while the gunboat-fleet\r\nis to ascend the river with your transports in company.  Red River\r\nis very low for the season, and I doubt if any of the boats can\r\npass the falls or rapids at Alexandria.  What General Banks\r\nproposes to do in that event I do not know; but my own judgment is\r\nthat Shreveport ought not to be attacked until the gunboats can\r\nreach it.  Not that a force marching by land cannot do it alone,\r\nbut it would be bad economy in war to invest the place with an army\r\nso far from heavy guns, mortars, ammunition, and provisions, which\r\ncan alone reach Shreveport by water.  Still, I do not know about\r\nGeneral Banks's plans in that event; and whatever they may be, your\r\nduty will be to conform, in the most hearty manner.\r\n\r\nMy understanding with General Banks is that he will not need the\r\ncooperation of your force beyond thirty days from the date you\r\nreach Red River.  As soon as he has taken Shreveport, or as soon as\r\nhe can spare you, return to Vicksburg with all dispatch, gather up\r\nyour detachments, wagons, tents, transportation, and all property\r\npertaining to so much of the command as belongs to the Sixteenth\r\nArmy Corps, and conduct it to Memphis, where orders will await you.\r\nMy present belief is your division, entire, will be needed with the\r\nArmy of the Tennessee, about Huntsville or Bridgeport.  Still, I\r\nwill leave orders with General, Hurlbut, at Memphis, for you on\r\nyour return.\r\n\r\nI believe if water will enable the gunboats to cross the rapids at\r\nAlexandria, you will be able to make a quick, strong, and effective\r\nblow at our enemy in the West, thus widening the belt of our\r\nterritory, and making the breach between the Confederate Government\r\nand its outlying trans-Mississippi Department more perfect.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that General Steele makes a simultaneous move from\r\nLittle Rock, on Shreveport or Natchitoches, with a force of about\r\nten thousand men.  Banks will have seventeen thousand, and you ten\r\nthousand.  If these can act concentrically and simultaneously, you\r\nwill make short work of it, and then General Banks will have enough\r\nforce to hold as much of the Red River country as he deems wise,\r\nleaving you to bring to General Grant's main army the seven\r\nthousand five hundred men of the Sixteenth Corps now with you.\r\nHaving faith in your sound judgment and experience, I confide this\r\nimportant and delicate command to you, with certainty that you will\r\nharmonize perfectly with Admiral Porter and General Banks, with\r\nwhom you are to act, and thereby insure success.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nMEMPHIS, March 14, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor General McPHERSON, commanding, etc, Vicksburg, Mississippi\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: I wrote you at length on the 11th, by a special\r\nbearer of dispatches, and now make special orders to cover the\r\nmovements therein indicated.  It was my purpose to await your\r\nanswer, but I am summoned by General Grant to be in Nashville on\r\nthe 17th, and it will keep me moving night and day to get there by\r\nthat date.  I must rely on you, for you understand that we must\r\nreenforce the great army at the centre (Chattanooga) as much as\r\npossible, at the same time not risking the safety of any point on\r\nthe Mississippi which is fortified and armed with heavy guns.  I\r\nwant you to push matters as rapidly as possible, and to do all you\r\ncan to put two handsome divisions of your own corps at Cairo, ready\r\nto embark up the Tennessee River by the 20th or 30th of April at\r\nthe very furthest.  I wish it could be done quicker; but the\r\npromise of those thirty-days furloughs in the States of enlistment,\r\nthough politic, is very unmilitary.  It deprives us of our ability\r\nto calculate as to time; but do the best you can.  Hurlbut can do\r\nnothing till A. J. Smith returns from Red River.  I will then order\r\nhim to occupy Grenada temporarily, and to try and get those\r\nlocomotives that we need here.  I may also order him with cavalry\r\nand infantry to march toward Tuscaloosa, at the same time that we\r\nmove from the Tennessee River about Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nI don't know as yet the grand strategy of the next campaign, but on\r\narrival at Nashville I will soon catch the main points, and will\r\nadvise you of them..\r\n\r\nSteal a furlough and run to Baltimore incog.; but get back in time\r\nto take part in the next grand move.\r\n\r\nWrite me fully and frequently of your progress.  I have ordered the\r\nquartermaster to send down as many boats as he can get, to\r\nfacilitate your movements.  Mules, wagons, etc., can come up\r\nafterward by transient boats.  I am truly your friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Order No. 28.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nMEMPHIS, March 14, 1864\r\n\r\n1.  Major-General McPherson will organize two good divisions of his\r\ncorps (Seventeenth) of about five thousand men, each embracing in\r\npart the reenlisted veterans of his corps whose furloughs will\r\nexpire in April, which he will command in person, and will\r\nrendezvous at Cairo, Illinois, and report by telegraph and letter\r\nto the general commanding at department headquarters, wherever they\r\nmay be.  These divisions will be provided with new arms and\r\naccoutrements, and land transportation (wagons and mules) out of\r\nthe supplies now at Vicksburg, which will be conveyed to Cairo by\r\nor before April 15th.\r\n\r\n4.  During the absence of General McPherson from the district of\r\nVicksburg, Major-General Hurlbut will exercise command over all the\r\ntroops in the Department of the Tennessee from Cairo to Natchez,\r\ninclusive, and will receive special instructions from department\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman:\r\n\r\nL. M. DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO VOLUME I.\r\n\r\nCHICKASAW BAYOU.\r\n\r\nReport of Brigadier-General G. W. Morgan.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, RIGHT WING, THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,\r\nSTEAMER EMPRESS,\r\nJanuary 8, 1868.\r\n\r\nMajor J. H. HAMMOND, Chief of Staff:\r\n\r\nSIR: On the 1st instant, while pressed by many arduous duties, I\r\nwas requested to report to the commanding general the operations of\r\nmy division during the affair of the 27th, the action of the 28th,\r\nand the battle of the 29th ult.\r\n\r\nI had not received the report of subordinate commanders, nor had I\r\ntime to review the report I have the honor to submit.\r\n\r\nHerewith I have the honor to forward these reports, connected with\r\nwhich I will submit a few remarks.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Blair speaks of having discovered, while on his\r\nretreat from the enemy's works, a broad and easy road running from\r\nthe left of my position to the enemy's lines.  The road is neither\r\nbroad nor easy, and was advanced over by De Courcey when leading\r\nhis brigade to the charge.  The road General Blair speaks of is the\r\none running from Lake's Landing and intersecting with the Vicksburg\r\nroad on the Chickasaw Bluffs.  Its existence was known to me on the\r\n28th ult., but it was left open intentionally by the enemy, and was\r\ncommanded by a direct and cross fire from batteries and rifle-pits.\r\nThe withdrawal of his brigade from the assault by Colonel De\r\nCourcey was justified by the failure of the corps of A. J. Smith,\r\nand the command of Colonel Lindsey, to advance simultaneously to\r\nthe assault.  Both had the same difficulties to encounter\r\n--impassable bayous.  The enemy's line of battle was concave, and\r\nDe Courcey advanced against his centre--hence he sustained a\r\nconcentric fire, and the withdrawal of Steele from the front of the\r\nenemy's right on the 28th ult. enabled the enemy on the following\r\nday to concentrate his right upon his centre.\r\n\r\nI regret to find, from the report of Brigadier-General Thayer, some\r\none regiment skulked; this I did not observe, nor is it mentioned\r\nby General Blair, though his were the troops which occupied that\r\nportion of the field.  As far as my observation extended, the\r\ntroops bore themselves nobly; but the Sixteenth Ohio Infantry was\r\npeerless on the field, as it had ever been in camp or on the march.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Kershner, commanding, was wounded and taken\r\nprisoner.  He is an officer of rare merit, and deserves to command\r\na brigade.  Lieutenant-Colonel Dieter, commanding the Fifty-eighth\r\nOhio, was killed within the enemy's works; and Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMonroe, Twenty-second Kentucky, was struck down at the head of his\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nI again express my profound acknowledgments to Brigadier-Generals\r\nBlair and Thayer, and Colonels De Conrcey, Lindsey, and Sheldon,\r\nbrigade commanders.  Also to Major M. C. Garber, assistant\r\nquartermaster; Captain S. S. Lyon, acting topographical engineer;\r\nLieutenant Burdick, acting ordnance officer; Lieutenant Hutchins,\r\nacting chief of staff; Lieutenants H. G. Fisher and Smith, of\r\nSignal Corps; Lieutenant E. D. Saunders, my acting assistant\r\nadjutant-general; and Lieutenants English and Montgomery, acting\r\naides-de-camp, for the efficient services rendered me.\r\n\r\nNor can I close this report without speaking in terms of high\r\npraise of the meritorious and gallant services of Captains Foster\r\nand Lamphier.  Their batteries silenced several of the enemy's\r\nworks, and throughout the operations rendered good service.  My\r\nsincere acknowledgments are also due to Captain Griffith,\r\ncommanding First Iowa Battery, and Captain Hoffman, commanding\r\nFourth Ohio Battery.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. MORGAN, Brigadier-General Volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI, February 8, 1876.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL: Regarding the attack at Chickasaw Bayou, my record\r\nshows the position of Steele on the left; Morgan to his right;\r\nMorgan L. Smith to his right, and A. J. Smith on the extreme right;\r\nthe latter not expected to accomplish much more than a diversion,\r\nthe result to come from the three other divisions, Morgan having\r\nthe best opportunity.  Saturday night they were in position; you\r\nwere at Lake's plantation, right and rear of Morgan.\r\n\r\nThe attack for lodgment on the hills was ordered for Sunday\r\nmorning, December 28th.  I was sent to A. J. Smith before daylight,\r\nand returned to you soon after.  You were with Morgan.  You had\r\nfully explained to him the importance of his success, and that he\r\nshould be present with the attacking column, which was to be a part\r\nof his division, supported by the remainder, and by Blair's brigade\r\nof Steele's division cooperating.  The attack was to be\r\nsimultaneous, by the four divisions, on a signal.\r\n\r\nMorgan's answer to you was that, when the signal was given, he\r\nwould lead his attack, and with his life he would be on the bluffs\r\nin fifteen minutes. He seemed of positive knowledge, and as sure of\r\nsuccess.  You then retired to a central point, to be in easy\r\ncommunication with Steele and Morgan L. Smith.  The attack was\r\nmade, and developed, in the case of Steele, M. L. Smith, and A. J.\r\nSmith, that to cross the bayou was impossible, if opposed by any\r\nforce, and in each they were by a strong one.  Morgan's attacking\r\nforce succeeded in getting across the causeway and marsh, but he\r\ndid not go with it, nor support it with more men, and a large\r\nnumber were captured from Blair's brigade after gaining the enemy's\r\nlast line of works covering the bayou.  At the time everybody\r\nblamed and criticised Morgan with the failure.  You felt from the\r\nadvance of his attack it must be successful, and, as it pushed\r\nforward, you sent me to urge on M. L. Smith, as Morgan was over,\r\nand he, Smith, must aid by persistent attack, and give Morgan as\r\ngood a chance as could be to make his lodgment....\r\n\r\nI am, etc.,    L. M. DAYTON\r\nLate Colonel of the Staff, now of Cincinnati, Ohio\r\nGeneral W. T. SHERMAN, St. Louis, Missouri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[COPY.]\r\n\r\n\" .  .  .  .  The expedition was wonderfully well provided with\r\nprovisions, transportation, and munitions, and even axes, picks,\r\nand shovels, so much in use later in the war, evidenced the\r\nforethought that governed this force.  The boats, from their open\r\nlower deck construction, proved admirable for transports, but their\r\ntinder-box construction made fire-traps of them, requiring\r\nunremitting vigilance.  These points were well understood, and the\r\nreadiness with which the troops adapted themselves to circumstances\r\nwas a constant source of wonder and congratulations.\r\n\r\n\"The fleet collected at Friar's Point for final orders, and there\r\nthe order of sailing was laid down with great minuteness, and\r\nprivate instructions issued to commanders of divisions, all of whom\r\nhad personal interviews with the commanding general, and received\r\npersonal explanations on pretty much every point involved.  Our\r\nheadquarters boat, the Forest Queen, was not very comfortable, nor\r\nwell provided, but General Sherman submitted cheerfully, on the\r\ngrounds of duty, and thought Conway a fine fellow.  I was only able\r\nto concede that he was a good steamboat captain....\r\n\r\n\"Our camp appointments were Spartan in the extreme, and in their\r\nsimplicity would have met the demands of any demagogue in the land.\r\nThe nights were cold and damp, and General Sherman uncomfortably\r\nactive in his preparations, so that the assistant adjutant-general\r\nhad no very luxurious  post just then.  We were surrounded with\r\nsloughs.  The ground was wet, and the water, although in winter,\r\nwas very unwholesome.  Many of our men, to this day, have reminders\r\nof the Yazoo in ague, fevers, and diseases of the bowels.  Cavalry\r\nwas useless.  One battalion of Illinois cavalry was strongly\r\nsuspected of camping in the timber, until time passed enough to\r\njustify the suspicion of having been somewhere.  Really the\r\nstrength of Vicksburg was in being out of reach of attack....\r\n\r\n\"My orders were to learn and report what was going on on the right,\r\nparticularly to try and form an idea of the enemy's force in front\r\nof M. L. Smith's division, and at the sand-bar.  Leaving my horse\r\nclose in the rear of the Sixth Missouri, when the fire became too\r\nheavy for riding, I succeeded, by taking frequent cover, in\r\nreaching unhurt the verge of the bayou among the drift-logs.\r\nThere, by concert of action with Lieutenant-Colonel Blood, of the\r\nSixth Missouri, his regiment, and the Thirteenth Regular Infantry,\r\nkept up a heavy fire on everything that showed along the levee and\r\nearthworks in front.  The enemy were behind the embankment, not\r\nover one hundred and fifty yards across the bayou.  Several\r\nofficers, including Colonel Blood, Colonel Kilby Smith, and myself,\r\nmanaged, by getting on the piles of drift, to see over the levee\r\nthrough the cleared fields beyond, even to the foot of the bluff.\r\nThe chips and twigs flew around lively enough, but we staid up long\r\nenough to make sure that the enemy had as many men behind the levee\r\nas could get cover.  We saw, also, a line of rifle-pits in the\r\nrear, commanding the rear of the levee, and still beyond, winding\r\nalong the foot of the bluff, a road worn by long use deep into the\r\nside-hill, and with the side next us strengthened with a good\r\nearthwork, affording a covered line of communication in the rear.\r\nThe fire of our men was so well maintained that we were able to see\r\nall these things, say a minute or more.  Some of those who ventured\r\nwere wounded, but those mentioned and myself escaped unhurt.  I\r\nadvised that men enough to hold the position, once across--say\r\nthree hundred--should make a rush (protected as our lookout had\r\nbeen by a heavy fire) across the sand-bar, and get a footing under\r\nthe other bank of the bayou, as the nucleus of an attacking force,\r\nif General Sherman decided to attack there, or to make a strong\r\ndiversion if the attack was made at the head of Chickasaw Bayou, in\r\nfront of Morgan.  General A. J. Smith, commanding First and Second\r\nDivisions, approved of this.  While returning to General Sherman, I\r\npassed along the Second and part of the Third Division.  On the\r\nleft of the Second I found a new Illinois regiment, high up in\r\nnumbers, working its way into position.  The colonel, a brave but\r\ninexperienced officer, was trying to lead his men according to the\r\npopular pictorial idea, viz., riding in advance waving his sword.\r\nI was leading my horse, and taking advantage of such cover as I\r\ncould find on my course, but this man acted so bravely that I tried\r\nto save him.  He did not accept my expostulations with very good\r\ngrace, but was not rough about it.  While I was begging him to\r\ndismount, he waved his sword and advanced.  In a second he was\r\nshot, through the chest, and dropped from his horse, plucky to the\r\nlast. He died, I was told, within the hour.  Many of the regiments\r\nwere new and inexperienced, but as a rule behaved well.  The fire\r\nalong the bayou was severe, but not very fatal, on account of the\r\ncover.  I was constantly asked what news from Grant, for from the\r\nmoment of our arrival in the Yazoo we were in expectation of either\r\nhearing his guns in the rear, or of having communication with him.\r\nThis encouraged the men greatly, but the long waiting was\r\ndisappointing, as the enemy was evidently in large force in the\r\nplenty of works, and a very strong position.  Careful estimates and\r\navailable information placed their force at fifteen to twenty\r\nthousand men.  I returned to headquarters about the middle of the\r\nafternoon, and made my report to the general.  We were busy till\r\nafter midnight, and again early in the morning of the 29th, in\r\npreparing orders for the attack.  These were unusually minute in\r\ndetail.  It seemed as though no contingency was left unprovided\r\nfor.  Urgent orders and cautions as to rations and ammunition were\r\ngiven.  Drawings of the line of attack, orders for supports, all\r\nand everything was foreseen and given in writing, with personal\r\nexplanations to commanders of divisions, brigades, and even\r\ncommanders of regiments.  Indeed, the commanding general, always\r\ncareful as to detail, left nothing to chance, and with experienced\r\nand ordinate officers we would have succeeded, for the troops were\r\ngood.  The general plan involved a feint on our left toward\r\nHaines's Bluff, by the navy, under Admiral Porter, with whom we\r\nwere in constant communication, while between him and General\r\nSherman perfect harmony existed.  On the right a demonstration by\r\nA. J. Smith was to be made.  The Second Division (Stuart's) was to\r\ncross the sand-bar, and the Third (General Morgan's) was to cross\r\non a small bridge over the dough at the head of Chickasaw Bayou,\r\nand, supported by Steele, was to push straight for the Bluff at the\r\nnearest spur where there was a battery in position, and to effect\r\na lodgment there and in the earthworks.  General Sherman gave his\r\norders in person to Morgan and Steele.  I understood Morgan to\r\npromise that he would lead his division in person, and he seemed to\r\nexpect an easy victory, and expressed himself freely to that\r\neffect.  The aides were sent out, until I was left alone with the\r\ngeneral and a couple of orderlies.  He located himself in a\r\nposition easy of access, and the most convenient afforded to the\r\npoint of attack.  He directed me to see what I could, and report if\r\nI met anything that he should know.  I galloped as fast as possible\r\nto the right, and found part of the Sixth Missouri pushing over the\r\nsand-bar covered by the Thirteenth Regulars with a heavy fire.  We\r\nsupposed, if once across, they could get up the bank and turn the\r\nlevee against the enemy, and left with that impression.  Being in\r\nheavy timber, I was not quite sure of my way back to the general,\r\nhis location being new, and therefore pushed full gallop for\r\nMorgan's front, catching a good many stray shots from the\r\nsharpshooters behind the levee, as I was compelled to keep in sight\r\nof the bayou to hold direction.  Something over half-way along\r\nMorgan's division front, the commander of a Kentucky regiment\r\nhailed me and said he must have support, as he was threatened by a\r\nmasked battery, and the enemy was in force in his front, and might\r\ncross any moment.  I answered, rather shortly, 'How the devil do\r\nyou know there is a masked battery?  If you can't get over, how can\r\nthe rebels get at you?'  He insisted on the battery, and danger.  I\r\nfinally told him the bayou was utterly impassable there, but, if he\r\ninsisted the enemy could cross, I would insist on an advance on our\r\nside at that point.  Hurrying on to make up lost time, I soon\r\nreached Morgan.  He was making encouraging speeches in a general\r\nway, but stopped to ask me questions as to Steele's rank, date of\r\ncommission, etc.  I was very much disturbed at this, fearing want\r\nof harmony, and rode on to Steele, whom I found cursing Morgan so\r\nfiercely that I could not exactly make out the source of the\r\ntrouble, or reason why; but saw want of concert clearly enough.  I\r\nhastened back to General Sherman, and endeavored to impress my\r\nideas on him and my fears; but, while he admitted the facts, he\r\ncould not be made to believe that any jealousy or personal quarrel\r\ncould lead to a failure to support each other, and a neglect of\r\nduty.  The signal for attack had already been given, and the\r\nartillery had opened, when I left him again for Morgan's front.  I\r\nfound Morgan where I left him, and the troops advancing.  I had\r\nunderstood that he was to lead his division, and asked about it,\r\nbut, getting no satisfaction, pushed for the front, crossing the\r\nslough at the little bridge at the head of the bayou.  I found the\r\nwillows cut off eighteen inches or two feet long, with sharp points\r\nabove the mud, making it slow and difficult to pass, save at the\r\nbridge.  I overtook the rear of the advance about two or three\r\nhundred feet up the gentle slope, and was astonished to find how\r\nsmall a force was making the attack.  I was also surprised to find\r\nthat they were Steele's men instead of Morgan's.  I also saw\r\nseveral regiments across the bayou, but not advancing; they were\r\nnear the levee.  A heavy artillery and infantry fire was going on\r\nall this time.  While making my way along the column, from which\r\nthere were very few falling back, a shell burst near me, and the\r\nconcussion confused me at the time and left me with a headache for\r\nseveral months.  When I got my wits about me again I found a good\r\nmany coming back, but the main part of the force was compact and\r\nkeeping up the fight.  I did not get closer to the woods than about\r\nfive hundred feet, and found that a large number had penetrated\r\ninto the enemy's works.  When our men fell back, very few ran, but\r\ncame slowly and sullenly, far more angry than frightened.  I found\r\nGeneral Frank Blair on foot, and with him Colonel Sea, of Southwest\r\nMissouri, and learned that Colonel Thomas Fletcher, afterward\r\nGovernor of Missouri, was captured with many of his men.  They both\r\ninsisted there on the spot, with those around us, that if all the\r\nmen ordered up had gone up, or even all that crossed the bayou had\r\nmoved forward, we could have readily established ourselves in the\r\nenemy's works.  I was firmly of the same opinion at the time on the\r\nground; and, an entrance effected, we could have brought the whole\r\nforce on dry ground, and had a base of operations against\r\nVicksburg--though probably, in view of later events, we would have\r\nhad to stand a siege from Pemberton's army.  After explanations\r\nwith Blair, I rode to where the men were, who had crossed the\r\nbayou, but had not advanced with the others.  I found them to be De\r\nCourcey's brigade; of Morgan's division, which General Sherman\r\nsupposed to be in advance.  In fact, it was the intended support\r\nthat made the attack.  A correspondence and controversy followed\r\nbetween General Blair and Colonel De Courcey, most of which I have,\r\nbut nothing came of it.  On reaching the bayou, I found that\r\nThayer's brigade, of Steele's division, had in some way lost its\r\ndirection and filed off to the right.  Remembering the masked\r\nbattery, I suspected that had something to do with the matter, and,\r\non following it up, I learned that the Kentucky colonel before\r\nmentioned had appealed for aid against the masked battery and\r\ninvisible force of rebels, and that a regiment had been ordered to\r\nhim.  This regiment, filing off into the timber, had been followed\r\nby Thayer's brigade, supposing it to be advancing to the front, and\r\nthus left a single brigade to attack a superior force of the enemy\r\nin an intrenched and naturally strong position.  By the time the\r\nmistake could be rectified, it was too late.  Our loss was from one\r\nhundred and fifty to two hundred killed, and about eleven hundred\r\nprisoners and wounded.  During the afternoon I went with a flag of\r\ntruce, with reference to burying the dead.  I saw between eighty\r\nand one hundred of our men dead, all stripped.  There were others\r\ncloser into the enemy's works than I was allowed to go.  On going\r\nlater to where the Sixth Missouri crossed, I found that they were\r\nunder the bank, and had dug in with their hands and bayonets, or\r\nanything in reach, to protect themselves from a vertical fire from\r\nthe enemy overhead, who had a heavy force there.  With great\r\ndifficulty they were withdrawn at night.  Next day arrangements\r\nwere made to attempt a lodgment below Haines's Bluff: This was to\r\nbe done by Steele's command, while the rest of the force attacked\r\nagain where we had already tried.  During the day locomotives\r\nwhistled, and a great noise and fuss went on in our front, and we\r\nsupposed that Grant was driving in Pemberton, and expected firing\r\nany moment up the Yazoo or in the rear of Vicksburg.  Not hearing\r\nthis, we concluded that Pemberton was throwing his forces into\r\nVicksburg.  A heavy fog prevented Steele from making his movement.\r\nRain began to fall, and our location was not good to be in after a\r\nheavy rain, or with the river rising.  During the night (I think)\r\nof January, 1, 1863, our troops were embarked, material and\r\nprovisions having been loaded during the day.  A short time before\r\ndaylight of the 2d, I went by order of the general commanding, to\r\nour picket lines and carefully examined the enemy's lines, wherever\r\na camp-fire indicated their presence.  They were not very vigilant,\r\nand I once got close enough to hear them talk, but could understand\r\nnothing.  Early in the morning I came in with the rear-guard, the\r\nenemy advancing his pickets and main guards only, and making no\r\neffort at all to press us.  Once I couldn't resist the temptation\r\nto fire into a squad that came bolder than the rest, and the two\r\nshots were good ones.  We received a volley in return that did come\r\nvery close among us, but hurt none of my party.  Very soon after\r\nour rear-guard was aboard, General Sherman learned from Admiral\r\nPorter that McClernand had arrived at the mouth of the Yazoo.  He\r\nwent, taking me and one other staff-officer, to see McClernand, and\r\nfound that, under an order from the President, he had taken command\r\nof the Army of the Mississippi.  He and his staff, of whom I only\r\nremember two-Colonels Scates and Braham, assistant adjutant-general\r\nand aide-de-camp--seemed to think they had a big thing, and, so far\r\nas I could judge, they had just that.  All hands thought the\r\ncountry expected them to cut their way to the Gulf; and to us, who\r\nhad just come out of the swamp, the cutting didn't seem such an\r\neasy job as to the new-comers.  Making due allowance for the\r\nelevation they seemed to feel in view of their job, everything\r\npassed off pleasantly, and we learned that General Grant's\r\ncommunications had been cut at Holly Springs by the capture of\r\nMurphy and his force (at Holly Springs), and that he was either in\r\nMemphis by that time or would soon be.  So that, everything\r\nconsidered, it was about as well that we did not get our forces on\r\nthe bluff's of Walnut Hill.\"\r\n\r\nThe above statement was sent to General Sherman in a letter dated\r\n\"Chicago, February 5,1876,\" and signed \"John H. Hammond.\"  Hammond\r\nwas General Sherman's assistant adjutant-general at the Chickasaw\r\nBayou.\r\n\r\nJ. E. TOURTELOTTE, Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 29th December, 1862, at Chickasaw Bayou, I was in command of the\r\nThirty-first Missouri Volunteer Infantry, First Brigade, First\r\nDivision, Fifteenth Army Corps (Blair's brigade).  Colonel Wyman,\r\nof the Thirteenth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, having been killed,\r\nI was the senior colonel of the brigade.  General Blair rode up to\r\nwhere my regiment lay, and said to me:\r\n\r\n\"We are to make a charge here; we will charge in two lines; your\r\nregiment will be in the first line, and the Twenty-ninth\r\n(Cavender's) will support you.  Form here in the timber, and move\r\nout across the bayou on a double-quick, and go right on to the top\r\nof the heights in your front.\"  He then told me to await a signal.\r\nI then attempted to make a reconnaissance of the ground over which\r\nwe would have to charge, and rode out to the open ground in my\r\nfront, and saw that there was water and soft mud in the bayou, and\r\nwas fired upon by the sharp-shooters of the enemy, and turned and\r\nwent back into the woods where my command lay.  Soon after that\r\nGeneral Blair came near me, and I told him there was water and mud\r\nin the bayou, and I doubted if we could get across.  He answered me\r\nthat General Morgan told him there was no water nor mud to hinder\r\nus.  I remarked that I had seen it myself, and General Morgan, or\r\nany one else, could see it if he would risk being shot at pretty\r\nlively.  I then told General Blair that it was certain destruction\r\nto us if we passed over the abatis upon the open ground where there\r\nhad once been a corn-field; that we could never reach the base of\r\nthe hill.  He turned to me and said, \"Can't you take your regiment\r\nup there?\"  I told him, \"Yes, I can take my regiment anywhere,\r\nbecause the men do not know any better than to go,\" but remarked\r\nthat old soldiers could not be got to go up there.  General Blair\r\nthen said,  \"Tom, if we succeed, this will be a grand thing; you\r\nwill have the glory of leading the assault.\"  He then went on to\r\nsay that General Morgan's division would support us, and they were\r\nheroes of many battles, and pointed to the Fifty-eighth Ohio, then\r\nforming in the rear of the Thirteenth Illinois on my right, and\r\nsaid: \"See these men? They are a part of Morgan's division, and are\r\nheroes of many battles.\"  I laughingly said that they might be\r\nheroes, but the regiment did not number as many as one of my\r\ncompanies.  He again assured me we would be supported by Morgan's\r\ndivision, and all I had to do was to keep right on and  \"keep going\r\ntill you get into Vicksburg.\"  I took my position in advance of my\r\nregiment and awaited the signal.  When we heard it, we raised a\r\nshout, and started at a double-quick, the Thirteenth Illinois on my\r\nright.  I saw no troops on my left.  When we emerged from the\r\nwoods, the enemy opened upon us; crossing the bayou under fire, and\r\nmany of the men sinking in the mud and water, our line was very\r\nmuch disordered, but we pretty well restored it before reaching the\r\nabatis.  Here we were greatly disordered, but somewhat restored the\r\nline on reaching the plateau or corn-field.  The Twenty-ninth\r\nMissouri came on, gallantly supporting us.  The Thirteenth Illinois\r\ncame out upon the corn-field, and the Fifty-eighth Ohio followed\r\nclose upon it.  There was firing to my left, and as I afterward\r\nlearned was from the Fourth Iowa of Thayer's brigade (and I believe\r\nof Steele's division).  I was struck and fell, and my regiment went\r\nback in great disorder.  The fire was terrific.  I saw beyond the\r\nThirteenth Illinois, to my right, a disordered line, and learned\r\nafterward it was the Sixteenth Ohio.  When I was taken from the\r\nfield by the enemy and taken into Vicksburg, I found among the\r\nwounded and prisoners men and officers of the Sixteenth and\r\nFifty-eighth Ohio, and of the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first\r\nMissouri, and Thirteenth Illinois.  After I was exchanged and\r\njoined my command, General Blair laughingly remarked to me that I\r\nhad literally obeyed his order and gone \"straight on to Vicksburg.\"\r\nHe lamented the cutting to pieces of our force on that day.  We\r\ntalked the whole matter over at his headquarters during the siege\r\nof Vicksburg.  He said that if the charge had been made along our\r\nwhole line with the same vigor of attack made by his brigade, and\r\nif we had been supported as Morgan promised to do, we might have\r\nsucceeded.  I dissented from the opinion that we could even then\r\nhave succeeded.  I asked him what excuse Morgan gave for failing to\r\nsupport us, and he said that Colonel or General De Courcey was in\r\nsome manner to blame for that, but he said Morgan was mistaken as\r\nto the nature of the ground and generally as to the feasibility of\r\nthe whole thing, and was responsible for the failure to afford us\r\nthe support he had promised; that he and General Sherman and all of\r\nthem were misled by the statements and opinions of Morgan as to the\r\nsituation in our front, and Morgan was, on his part, deceived by\r\nthe reports of his scouts about other matters as well as the matter\r\nof the water in the bayou.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS C. FLETCHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARKANSAS POST.\r\n\r\nExtracts from Admiral Porter's Journal.\r\n\r\nSherman and I had made arrangements to capture Arkansas Post.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, while preparing to go out of the Yazoo, an\r\narmy officer called to see me, and said that he belonged to General\r\nMcClernand's staff, and that the general was at the mouth of the\r\nYazoo River, and desired to see me at once.  I sent word to the\r\ngeneral that if he wished to see me he could have an opportunity by\r\ncalling on board my flag-ship.\r\n\r\nA few moments after I had heard the news of McClernand'a arrival, I\r\nsaw Sherman pulling about in a boat, and hailed him, informing him\r\nthat McClernand was at the mouth of the Yazoo.  Sherman then came\r\non board, and, in consequence of this unexpected news, determined\r\nto postpone the movement out of the Yazoo River, and let McClernand\r\ntake that upon himself.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClernand took my hint and came on board the flag-ship,\r\nbut I soon discovered that any admiral, Grant, Sherman, or all the\r\ngenerals in the army, were nobody in his estimation.  Sherman had\r\nbeen at McClernand's headquarters to see him and state the\r\ncondition of affairs, and he then suggested to the latter the plan\r\nof going to Arkansas Post.\r\n\r\nI had a number of fine maps hanging up in my cabin, and when\r\nMcClernand came on board he examined them all with the eye of a\r\nconnoisseur.  He then stated to me as a new thing the plan he\r\nproposed!!! of going to Arkansas Post and stirring up our troops,\r\nwhich had been \"demoralized by the late defeat\" (Sherman was\r\npresent, looking daggers at him).  I answered, \"Yes, General\r\nSherman and myself have already arranged for going to Arkansas\r\nPost.\"  Sherman then made some remark about the disposition of the\r\ntroops in the coming expedition, when McClernand gave him rather a\r\ncurt answer.  McClernand then remarked, \"If you will let me have\r\nthree gunboats, I will go and take the place.\"  Now General\r\nMcClernand had about as much idea of what a gunboat was, or could\r\ndo, as the man in the moon.  He did not know, the difference\r\nbetween an ironclad and a \"tin-clad.\"  He had heard that gunboats\r\nhad taken Fort Henry, and that was all he knew about them.  I said\r\nto him: \"I'll tell you what I will do, General McClernand.  If\r\nGeneral Sherman goes in command of the troops, I will go myself in\r\ncommand of a proper force, and will insure the capture of the\r\npost.\"  McClernand winced under this, and Sherman quietly walked\r\noff into the after-cabin.  He beckoned me to come there, while\r\nMcClernand was apparently deeply engaged in studying out a chart,\r\nmaking believe he was interested, in order to conceal his temper.\r\nSherman said to me: \"Admiral, how could you make such a remark to\r\nMcClernand?  He hates me already, and you have made him an enemy\r\nfor life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" said I; \"he shall not treat you rudely in my cabin,\r\nand I was glad of the opportunity of letting him know my\r\nsentiments.\"  By this time, General McClernand having bottled up\r\nhis wrath, or cooled down, I went in to him and we discussed the\r\nmatter.  He consented that Sherman should go in command of the\r\ntroops, and the interview ended pleasantly enough.\r\n\r\nThe above extracts from Admiral Porter's journal were sent by the\r\nadmiral to General Sherman, inclosed in a letter dated \"Washington,\r\nMay 29, 1875,\" and signed \"David D. Porter.\"\r\n\r\nJ. E. TOURTELOTTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Yazoo, the Army of the Mississippi rendezvous was\r\nat Milliken's Bend.  During the night of January 4th or 5th,\r\nGeneral McClernand came on board the Forest Queen, and with General\r\nSherman went to the Black Hawk flag-boat.  There an interview took\r\nplace, during which the expedition to Arkansas Post took shape.\r\nGeneral Sherman having asked leave to take the post, and Admiral\r\nPorter having decided to go along, McClernand thought best to go\r\nwith his entire army, although the enemy were supposed to have only\r\nabout four or five thousand men, and the fort was little more than\r\na large earthwork commanding the river.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman's command was then entitled the Second Corps, Army\r\nof the Mississippi, and was comprised of the First Division,\r\nBlair's, Hovey's, and Thayer's brigades, commanded by Steele; and\r\nthe Second Division, commanded by David Stuart, with Colonels Giles\r\nA. and Kilby Smith commanding brigades.\r\n\r\nOur fleet was convoyed by three ironclads and several other\r\ngunboats.  The weather was bitterly cold for that latitude; we were\r\nfour days getting into the Arkansas River, which we entered by the\r\nWhite River cut-off; and my recollection is, that our passing the\r\nmouth of the main river deceived the enemy as to our destination.\r\nThe entrance through the cut-off was feasible by reason of high\r\nwater, and I think made our appearance a surprise to the force at\r\nthe post.  We disembarked on the morning of the 10th of January.\r\nStuart's division first encountered the enemy behind an earthwork\r\nabout four miles from the fort, running across the solid ground\r\nfrom the river to a swamp.  General Sherman in person took Steele's\r\ndivision, and followed a road leading to the rear of the earthwork\r\njust mentioned.  We had got fairly under way when the rebels fell\r\nback to the fort, and McClernand, coming up, ordered us to fall\r\nback, and march up the river.  It seemed to me then, and afterward,\r\nthat it would have been better to have marched straight to the rear\r\nof the fort, as we started to do.  We soon overtook Stuart and\r\nclosed in, General Sherman on the right, Morgan's force on the\r\nleft, reaching to the river, where the gunboats were, while Sherman\r\nreached from the road which connected the post with the back\r\ncountry, toward where the earthworks reached the river above the\r\nfort, and threatened their communications with Little Rock.  The\r\nnight was cold and cloudy, with some snow.  There were a good many\r\nabandoned huts to our rear, but our forces in position lay on the\r\nfrozen ground, sheltered as best they could, among the bushes and\r\ntimber.  We were so close that they could have reached us any time\r\nduring the night with light artillery.  The gun-boats threw heavy\r\nshells into the fort and behind the earthworks all night, keeping\r\nthe enemy awake and anxious.  The heavy boom of the artillery was\r\nfollowed by the squeak, squeak of Admiral Porter's little tug, as\r\nhe moved around making his arrangements for the morrow.  The sounds\r\nwere ridiculous by comparison.  General Sherman and staff lay on\r\nthe roots of an old oak-tree, that kept them partly clear of mud.\r\nThe cold was sharp, my right boot being frozen solid in a puddle in\r\nthe morning.  About half-past two or three o'clock, General\r\nSherman, with another and myself, crept in as close as possible and\r\nreconnoitred the position.  The general managed to creep in much\r\ncloser than the rest of us--in fact, so close as to cause us\r\nanxiety.  The enemy worked hard all night on their abatis and\r\nintrenchments, and in the morning we found a ditch and parapet\r\nrunning clear across the point on which the post was situated.\r\nThis point was cut by a road from the back country, across which\r\nwas a heavy earthwork and a battery.  This road was at the\r\nextremity of our left.  General McClernand kept his head-quarters\r\non his boat, the Tigress.  He came up in the morning to a place in\r\nthe woods in our rear.  One of his staff, a cavalry-officer,\r\nclimbed a tree to report movements; but from that point there was\r\nvery little to be seen.  Between ten and eleven o'clock the fire\r\nopened from the fleet, and we opened along the whole line from\r\ninfantry and field-guns.  Our men soon worked in close enough to\r\nkeep down the fire of the enemy to a very marked degree.\r\n\r\nAfter reporting to General Sherman, and while explaining the\r\nposition of the fleet, the smoke-stacks and flags appeared above\r\nthe fort.  What firing was going on in our immediate front ceased.\r\nA good many rebels were in plain sight, running away from the fort\r\nand scattering.  While we were still surprised, the cry was raised\r\nthat a white flag was hung out.  I did not see it, but in a few\r\nminutes saw others along the line, and just as the general started\r\nfor the fort I saw the flag not far from the white house, near the\r\nparapet.  Orders were given to cease firing.  Captain Dayton was\r\nsent to the fort where the first flag was raised.  Some shots were\r\nfired and some men hurt after this.  The first rebel officer we\r\nencountered was Colonel or General Garland, commanding brigade, who\r\nwas ordered to put his men in line and stack arms, which was done.\r\nI was directed to pass along the line to the right, and cause the\r\nprisoners to stack arms and form our men in line, just outside the\r\nwork.  This I did till I reached Deshler's brigade, on our extreme\r\nright, or nearly so, and who was opposed to the right of Steele's\r\nforce.  Steele's men had rushed up to the very foot of the parapet,\r\nand some were on it, though they did not fire.  The commander of\r\nthe enemy (Deshler) refused to obey my orders to stack arms, and\r\nasked a good many questions as to \"how it happened;\" said he was\r\nnot whipped, but held us in check, etc.  I told him there were\r\neight or nine thousand men right there, that a shot from me, or a\r\ncall, would bring down on him, and that we had entire possession of\r\nthe place.  After sending two officers from the nearest troops to\r\nexplain the condition to Steele, and to warn every officer they met\r\nto pass the word for everybody to be on the sharp lookout, I\r\narranged with Deshler to keep quiet until I could bring his own\r\ncommander, or orders from him.  Returning to General Sherman, I\r\nfound a party of young rebel officers, including Robert Johnston's\r\nson (rebel Senate) and Captain Wolf, quartermaster, of New Orleans,\r\nwho declined to surrender except to gentlemen.  Some German\r\nMissouri soldiers didn't relish the distinction, and were about\r\nclubbing them over the head, when I interfered and received their\r\nsurrender.  Hurrying back to the general, I reported the dangerous\r\ncondition of things.  He and General Churchill, commanding officer\r\nof the enemy, started for Deshler's brigade; meeting Garland, a\r\nquarrel and some recrimination followed between him and Churchill,\r\nas to where the fault of the surrender belonged, which was rather\r\npromptly silenced by General Sherman, who hurried to the scene of\r\ntrouble.  There, after some ill-natured talk, Deshler ordered his\r\nmen to lay down their arms.  I rode into the fort, and found the\r\nparapet badly torn up by the fire from the fleet.  On going to the\r\nembrasure where I had seen the gun while on the river-bank talking\r\nto Captain Shirk, the piece was found split back about eighteen\r\ninches, and the lower half of the muzzle dropped out.  A battered\r\nbut unexploded shell lying with the piece explained that it must\r\nhave struck the gun in the muzzle, almost squarely.  On passing\r\nalong the inside I saw from the torn condition of the earthworks\r\nhow tremendous our fire was, and how the fire of the enemy was kept\r\ndown.  The fire of the navy had partly torn down the side of the\r\nfort next the river.  A good many sailors were in the fort.\r\nGeneral A. J. Smith, Admiral Porter, and General Burbridge were\r\nthere--all in high spirits, but in some contention as to who got in\r\nfirst. Toward dark, or nearly so, an Arkansas regiment came in as\r\nreenforcements, but surrendered without any trouble.  About the\r\nsame time General Sherman received orders to put General A. J.\r\nSmith in charge of the fort, and stay outside with his men.  As his\r\ntroops were nearly all inside, and had four-fifths of the prisoners\r\nin charge, these orders were not very clear, and the general left\r\nfor headquarters to find out what was meant.  I went on collecting\r\narms, and as our men were scattering a good deal and were greatly\r\nexcited, I took the precaution to pass along the line and march the\r\nprisoners far enough from the stacked arms to be out of temptation.\r\nI was especially urged to this by hearing several rebel officers\r\nspeak of their guns being still loaded.  It was dark before all the\r\nprisoners were collected and under guard, including the regiment\r\nthat arrived after the fight.  I am confident that all the\r\nprisoners were under guard by General Sherman's troops.\r\n\r\nEverything being secure, the staff-officers, all of whom had been\r\nbusily engaged, scattered to compare notes and enjoy the victory.\r\nI found my way onboard the Tigress, where every one was greatly\r\nexcited, and in high feather regarding our victory, the biggest\r\nthing since Donelson.  I also obtained some food and small comforts\r\nfor a few rebel officers, including young Johnston, Wolfe, and the\r\nColonel Deshler already mentioned.  Then hunted up General Sherman,\r\nwhom I found sitting on a cracker-boa in the white house already\r\nmentioned, near where the white flag first appeared.  Garland was\r\nwith him, and slept with him that night, while the rest of us laid\r\naround wherever we could.  It was a gloomy, bloody house, and\r\nsuggestive of war.  Garland was blamed by the other Confederate\r\nofficers for the white flag, and remained with us for safety.  Next\r\nday was very cold.  We worked hard at the lists of prisoners\r\n--nearly five thousand in number--all of whom were sent to St.\r\nLouis, in charge of our inspector-general, Major Sanger.  Our\r\nloss was less than one hundred.  The enemy, although behind\r\nintrenchments, lost more than double what we did.  Their wounded\r\nwere much worse hurt than ours, who were mostly hit around the head\r\nand arms.\r\n\r\nThe losses were nearly all in General Sherman's wing of the army.\r\nThe loss in the fleet amounted to little, but their service was\r\nvery valuable, and deserved great credit, though they received\r\nlittle.  There was a good deal of sympathy between our part of the\r\nforces and the fleet people, and I then thought, and still think,\r\nif we had been on the left next the river, that in connection with\r\nthe tremendous fire from the navy, we could have carried the work\r\nin an hour after we opened on it.  Their missiles traversed the\r\nwhole fortification, clear through to the hospitals at the upper\r\nend, and I stood five minutes in rifle-range of the fort next the\r\nriver--not hit, and but seldom shot at, and no one hit near me.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th we embarked, in a snow-storm; collected at Napoleon,\r\nwhich seemed to be washing away; and steamed to Milliken's Bend,\r\nwere we arrived on January 21st, and soon after went to Young's\r\nplantation, near Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nThe above statement from General Hammond was received by General\r\nSherman, inclosed in a letter dated \"Chicago, February 5, 1876\" and\r\nsigned \"John H. Hammond,\" who was adjutant-general to General\r\nSherman during the winter of 1862-'83.\r\n\r\nJ. E. TOURTELLOTTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI, February 3, 1876\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL: At Arkansas Post the troops debarked from steamer\r\nJanuary 9th, from one o'clock to dark, in the vicinity of Notrib's\r\nfarm, and on the 10th moved out to get position; Steele to the\r\nright, crossing the low ground to the north, to get a higher\r\nground, avoid crowding the moving columns, and gain the left (our\r\nright) and rear of the \"post,\" and the river-bank above the post.\r\nStuart took the river-road the movement commencing at 11 o'clock\r\nA.M.. After crossing the low ground covered with water, you were\r\ncalled back with Steele, as Stuart had driven out the enemy's\r\nrifle-trench pickets, this giving more and feasible room for\r\nmoving.  Stuart was pushed forward, and by dark he and Steele were\r\nwell up to their expected positions.  Before daylight on the 11th\r\nyou directed me to accompany you for a personal inspection of the\r\nground to your front, which we made on foot, going so far forward\r\nthat we could easily hear the enemy at work and moving about.\r\nDiscovering the open fields, you at once directed Steele to move to\r\nthe right and front, and pushed Stuart out so as to fully command\r\nthem and the field-work of the enemy extending from the fort, to\r\nprevent farther strengthening, as it was evident these works were\r\nthe product of a recent thought.  Stuart and Steele were prompt in\r\ntaking position, but Morgan's command (not under your control) did\r\nnot seem to work up, or keep in junction with you.  At ten o'clock\r\nyou sent me to McClernand to ascertain why the delay of attack.  He\r\nattributed it to Admiral Porter, which was really unjust.  The\r\nattack began at 1 p.m., by Admiral Porter, and the sound of his\r\nfirst gun had not died till your men were engaged--Wood's,\r\nBarrett's, and the Parrott batteries and infantry.  It was\r\nlively for a time, and Stuart pushed clear up to the enemy's\r\nrifle-trenches, and forced them to keep sheltered.  Hammond was\r\nmostly with Steele; Sanger sent to McClernand, and McCoy, myself,\r\nand John Taylor were with you and Stuart.  At about half-past three\r\nI got your permission to go to Giles Smith's skirmish-line, and,\r\nthinking I saw evidence of the enemy weakening, I hurried back to\r\nyou and reported my observations.  I was so confident that a demand\r\nfor it would bring a surrender, that I asked permission to make it,\r\nand, as you granted me, but refused to let another member of your\r\nstaff, at his request, go with me, I rode directly down the road\r\nwith only an orderly.  Colonel Garland, commanding a brigade, was\r\nthe first officer I saw, to whom, for you, I made the demand.  All\r\nfiring ceased at once, or in a few moments.  I sent the orderly back\r\nto you, and you rode forward.  It was then four o'clock.\r\n\r\nDuring the attack, nobody seemed to think McClernand had any clear\r\nidea of what or how it was to be done.  During the day he gave you\r\nno directions, nor came where you were; he was well to the rear,\r\nwith his \"man up a tree,\" who in the capacity of a lookout gave\r\nMcClernand information, from which he based such instructions as he\r\nmade to his subordinates.  He was free to express himself as being\r\na man of \"destiny,\" and his \"star\" was in the ascendance.  I am,\r\netc.,\r\n\r\nL. M. DAYTON, late Colonel of the Staff, now of Cincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERIDIAN CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No. 11.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nMEMPHIS, January 27, 1864\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The expedition is one of celerity, and all things must tend to\r\nthat.  Corps commanders and staff-officers will see that our\r\nmovements are not encumbered by wheeled vehicles improperly loaded.\r\nNot a tent, from the commander-in-chief down, will be carried.  The\r\nsick will be left behind, and the surgeons can find houses and\r\nsheds for all hospital purposes.\r\n\r\nVI. All the cavalry in this department is placed under the orders\r\nand command of Brigadier-General W. S. Smith, who will receive\r\nspecial instructions.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. SHERMAN\r\n\r\nL. M. DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.-That same evening I started in a steamboat for Vicksburg.\r\nW. T. S.\r\nSt. Louis, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nMEMPHIS, January 27, 1864\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General W. S. SMITH, commanding Cavalry, etc., present.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: By an order issued this day I have placed all the\r\ncavalry of this department subject to your command.  I estimate you\r\ncan make a force of full seven thousand men, which I believe to be\r\nsuperior and better in all respects than the combined cavalry which\r\nthe enemy has in all the State of Mississippi.  I will in person\r\nstart for Vicksburg to-day, and with four divisions of infantry,\r\nartillery, and cavalry move out for Jackson, Brandon, and Meridian,\r\naiming to reach the latter place by February 10th.  General Banks\r\nwill feign on Pascagoula and General Logan on Rome.  I want you\r\nwith your cavalry to move from Colliersville on Pontotoc and\r\nOkolona; thence sweeping down near the Mobile & Ohio Railroad,\r\ndisable that road as much as possible, consume or destroy the\r\nresources of the enemy along that road, break up the connection\r\nwith Columbus, Mississippi, and finally reach me at or near\r\nMeridian as near the date I have mentioned as possible.  This will\r\ncall for great energy of action on your part, but I believe you are\r\nequal to it, and you have the best and most experienced troops in\r\nthe service, and they will do anything that is possible.  General\r\nGrierson is with you, and is familiar with the whole country.  I\r\nwill send up from Haines's Bluff an expedition of gunboats and\r\ntransports combined, to feel up the Yazoo as far as the present\r\nwater will permit.  This will disconcert the enemy.  My movement on\r\nJackson will also divide the enemy, so that by no combination can\r\nhe reach you with but a part of his force.  I wish you to attack\r\nany force of cavalry you meet and follow them southward, but in no\r\nevent be drawn into the forks of the streams that make up the Yazoo\r\nnor over into Alabama.  Do not let the enemy draw you into minor\r\naffairs, but look solely to the greater object to destroy his\r\ncommunication from Okolona to Meridian, and thence eastward to\r\nSelma.  From Okolona south you will find abundance of forage\r\ncollected along the railroad, and the farmers have corn standing in\r\nthe fields.  Take liberally of all these, as well as horses, mules,\r\ncattle, etc.  As a rule, respect dwellings and families as\r\nsomething too sacred to be disturbed by soldiers, but mills, barns,\r\nsheds, stables, and such like things use for the benefit or\r\nconvenience of your command.  If convenient, send into Columbus,\r\nMississippi, and destroy all machinery there, and the bridge across\r\nthe Tombigbee, which enables the enemy to draw the resources of the\r\neast side of the valley, but this is not of sufficient importance\r\nto delay your movement.  Try and communicate with me by scouts and\r\nspies from the time you reach Pontotoc.  Avoid any large force of\r\ninfantry, leaving them to me.  We have talked over this matter so\r\nmuch that the above covers all points not provided for in my\r\npublished orders of to-day.  I am, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Mayor-General, commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, January 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General J. P. HATCH, in charge of Cavalry Bureau, St.\r\nLouis, Missouri.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your favor of the 21st inst. is just received.  Up to the\r\npresent time eight hundred and eighteen horses have arrived here\r\nsince Captain Hudson's visit to St. Louis.  I wrote you upon his\r\nreturn several days ago that it would not be necessary to divert\r\nshipments to this point which could not reach us before February\r\n1st. We shall certainly get off on our contemplated expedition\r\nbefore that time.  The number of horses estimated for in this\r\ndepartment by its chief quartermaster was two thousand, and this\r\nnumber, including those already sent, will, I think, completely\r\nmount all the dismounted cavalry of this department.  Recruits for\r\ncavalry regiments are arriving freely, and this will swell our\r\nrequisitions for a couple of months to come.  I will as far as\r\npossible procure horses from the regions of country traversed by\r\nour cavalry.\r\n\r\nYours truly,   W. SOOY SMITH, Brigadier-General,\r\n\r\nChief of Cavalry, Military Division of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, January 28, 1864\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General GEORGE CROOK, commanding Second Cavalry Division,\r\nHuntsville, Alabama.\r\n\r\nI start in about three days with seven, thousand men to Meridian\r\nvia Pontotoc.  Demonstrate on Decatur, to hold Roddy.\r\n\r\nW. SOOY SMITH, Brigadier-General,\r\nChief of Cavalry, Military Division of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYWOOD, ILLINOIS, July 9,1875\r\nGeneral W. T. SHERMAN, Commander-in-Chief, United States Army.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of July 7th is just received.\r\n\r\nYour entire statement in the \"Memoirs\" concerning my part in the\r\nMeridian campaign is incorrect.\r\n\r\nYou overstate my strength, placing it at seven thousand effective,\r\nwhen it was but six.  The nominal strength of my command was seven\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nYou understate the strength of my enemy, putting Forrest's force at\r\nfour thousand.  On our return to Nashville, you stated it, in\r\nGeneral Grant's presence, to have been but twenty-five hundred.\r\nBefore and during my movement I positively knew Forrest's strength\r\nto be full six thousand, and he has since told me so himself.\r\n\r\nInstead of delaying from the 1st to the 11th of February for \"some\r\nregiment that was ice-bound near Columbus, Kentucky,\" it was an\r\nentire brigade, Colonel Waring's, without which your orders to me\r\nwere peremptory not to move.  I asked you if I should wait its\r\narrival, and you answered: \"Certainly; if you go without it, you\r\nwill be, too weak, and I want you strong enough to go where you\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nThe time set for our arrival at Meridian, the 10th of February, had\r\narrived before it was possible for me, under your orders, to move\r\nfrom Memphis, and I would have been entirely justifiable if I had\r\nnot started at all.  But I was at that time, and at all times\r\nduring the war, as earnest and anxious to carry out my orders, and\r\ndo my full duty as you or any other officer could be, and I set out\r\nto make a march of two hundred and fifty miles into the\r\nConfederacy, having to drive back a rebel force equal to my own.\r\nAfter the time had arrived for the full completion of my movement,\r\nI drove this force before me, and penetrated one hundred and sixty\r\nmiles into the Confederacy--did more hard fighting, and killed,\r\nwounded, and captured more of the enemy than you did during the\r\ncampaign--did my work most thoroughly, as far as I could go without\r\nencountering the rebel cavalry set loose by your return from\r\nMeridian, and brought off my command, with all the captured\r\nproperty and rescued negroes, with very small loss, considering\r\nthat inflicted on the enemy, and the long-continued and very severe\r\nfighting.  If I had disobeyed your orders, and started without\r\nWaring's brigade, I would have been \"too weak,\" would probably have\r\nbeen defeated, and would  have been subjected to just censure.\r\nHaving awaited its arrival, as I was positively and distinctly\r\nordered to do, it only remained for me to start upon its arrival,\r\nand accomplish all that I could of the work allotted to me.  To\r\nhave attempted to penetrate farther into the enemy's country, with\r\nthe cavalry of Polk's army coming up to reenforce Forrest, would\r\nhave insured the destruction of my entire command, situated as it\r\nwas.  I cannot now go into all the particulars, though I assure you\r\nthat they make the proof of the correctness of my conduct as\r\nconclusive as I could desire it to be.  I was not headed off and\r\ndefeated by an inferior force near West Point.  We had the fighting\r\nall our own way near West Point, and at all other points except at\r\nOkalona, on our return, when we had the worst of it for a little\r\nwhile, but finally checked the enemy handsomely, and continued our\r\nreturn march, fighting at the rear and on both flanks, repulsing\r\nall attacks and moving in perfect order.  And so my movement was\r\nnot a failure, except that I did not reach Meridian as intended,\r\nfor the reason stated, and for many more which it is not necessary\r\nfor me to detail here.  On the other hand, it was a very decided\r\nsuccess, inflicting a terrible destruction of supplies of every\r\nkind, and a heavy loss of men upon the enemy.  You should have so\r\nreported it in the beginning.  You should so amend your report, and\r\n\"Memoirs\" now.  This, and no less than this, is due from one\r\nsoldier to another.  It is due to the exalted position which you\r\noccupy, and, above all, it is due to that truthfulness in history\r\nwhich you claim to revere.  If you desire it, I will endeavor to\r\nvisit you, and in a friendly manner \"fight our battles o'er again,\"\r\nand endeavor to convince you that you have always been mistaken as\r\nto the manner in which my part in the \"Meridian campaign\" was\r\nperformed.  But I will never rest until the wrong statements\r\nregarding it are fully and fairly corrected.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SOOY SMITH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri, July 11, 1875.\r\n\r\nGeneral J. D. WEBSTER, Chicago, Illinois\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: General W. Sooy Smith feels aggrieved and wronged by\r\nmy account of his part in the Meridian campaign, in my \"Memoirs,\"\r\npages 394, 395, and properly appeals to me for correction.  I have\r\noffered to modify any words or form of expression that he may point\r\nout, but he asks me to completely change the whole that concerns\r\nhim.  This, of course, I will not do, as his part was material to\r\nthe whole, and cannot be omitted or materially altered without\r\nchanging the remainder, for his failure to reach Meridian by\r\nFebruary 10th was the reason for other movements distant from him.\r\nI now offer him, what seems to me fair and liberal, that we submit\r\nthe points at issue to you as arbitrator.  You are familiar with\r\nthe ground, the coincident history, and most, if not all, the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nI propose to supply you with\r\n\r\n1.  Copy of my orders placing all the cavalry under General Smith's\r\norders (with returns).\r\n\r\n2.  My letter of instructions to him of January 27th.\r\n\r\n3.  My official report of the campaign, dated Vicksburg, March 7,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n4.  General W. Sooy Smith's report of his operations, dated\r\nNashville, Tennessee, March 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nAfter reading these, I further propose that you address us\r\nquestions which we will answer in writing, when you are to make us\r\na concise, written decision, which I will have published in close\r\nconnection with the subject in controversy.  If General Smith will\r\nshow you my letter to him of this date, and also deliver this with\r\nhis written assent, I will promptly furnish you the above\r\ndocuments, and also procure from the official files a return of the\r\ncavalry force available at and near Memphis on the date of my\r\norders, viz., January 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, General.\r\n\r\nNOTE:--General Smith never submitted his case to the arbitration\r\noffered.  The whole will be made clear by the publication of the\r\nofficial records, which are already in print, though not yet\r\nissued.  His orders were in writing, and I have no recollection of\r\nthe \"peremptory\" verbal orders to which he refers, and quotes as\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\nST. Louis, Missouri, 1895.    W. T. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYWOOD, ILLINOIS, July 14, 1875.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. T. SHERMAN, Commander-in-Chief, etc.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: Your letter of the 11th of July reaches me just as I\r\nam starting to spend the first vacation I have ever allowed myself\r\n--in the Territories, with my wife and son.\r\n\r\nIt indicates a spirit of fairness from which we have better things\r\nthan an arbitration to hope for.  Though, if we should reach such a\r\nnecessity, there is no one living to whom our differences might\r\nmore properly be referred than to General Webster.  I make no\r\nobjection to your writing your \"Memoirs,\" and, as long as they\r\nrefer to your own conduct, you are at liberty to write them as you\r\nlike; but, when they refer to mine, and deal unjustly with my\r\nreputation, I, of right, object.\r\n\r\nNeither do I wish to write my \"Memoirs,\" unless compelled to do so\r\nto vindicate my good name.  There were certain commands which were\r\nto make up mine.  These, Waring's brigade included, were spoken of\r\nby us in the long conversation to which you refer.  This brigade we\r\nknew was having a hard time of it in its movement from Columbus to\r\nMemphis.  I asked you if I should move without it if it did not\r\narrive, and you answered me as stated in my last letter to you.\r\nThose who immediately surrounded me during the painful delay that\r\noccurred will inform you how sorely I chafed under the restraint of\r\nthat peremptory order.\r\n\r\nIn the conversation that occurred between us at Nashville, while\r\nall the orders, written and verbal, were still fresh in your\r\nmemory, you did not censure me for waiting for Waring, but for\r\nallowing myself to be encumbered with fugitive negroes to such an\r\nextent that my command was measurably unfit for active movement or\r\neasy handling, and for turning back from West Point, instead of\r\npressing on toward Meridian.  Invitations had been industriously\r\ncirculated, by printed circulars and otherwise, to the negroes to\r\ncome into our lines, and to seek our protection wherever they could\r\nfind it, and I considered ourselves pledged to receive and protect\r\nthem.  Your censure for so doing, and your remarks on that subject\r\nto me in Nashville, are still fresh in my memory, and of a\r\ncharacter which you would now doubtless gladly disavow.\r\n\r\nBut we must meet and talk the whole matter over, and I will be at\r\nany trouble to see you when I return.\r\n\r\nMeantime I will not let go the hope that I will convince you\r\nabsolutely of your error, for the facts are entirely on my side.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SOOY SMITH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN\r\n\r\nBy William T. Sherman\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nATLANTA CAMPAIGN-NASHVILLE AND CHATTANOOGA TO BENEBAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH, APRIL, AND MAY, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th day of March, 1864, at Nashville, Tennessee, I relieved\r\nLieutenant-General Grant in command of the Military Division of the\r\nMississippi, embracing the Departments of the Ohio, Cumberland,\r\nTennessee, and Arkansas, commanded respectively by Major-Generals\r\nSchofield, Thomas, McPherson, and Steele.  General Grant was in the\r\nact of starting East to assume command of all the armies of the\r\nUnited States, but more particularly to give direction in person to\r\nthe Armies of the Potomac and James, operating against Richmond;\r\nand I accompanied him as far as Cincinnati on his way, to avail\r\nmyself of the opportunity to discuss privately many little details\r\nincident to the contemplated changes, and of preparation for the\r\ngreat events then impending.  Among these was the intended\r\nassignment to duty of many officers of note and influence, who had,\r\nby the force of events, drifted into inactivity and discontent.\r\nAmong these stood prominent Generals McClellan, Burnside, and\r\nFremont, in, the East; and Generals Buell, McCook, Negley, and\r\nCrittenden, at the West. My understanding was that General Grant\r\nthought it wise and prudent to give all these officers appropriate\r\ncommands, that would enable them to regain the influence they had\r\nlost; and, as a general reorganization of all the armies was then\r\nnecessary, he directed me to keep in mind especially the claims of\r\nGenerals Buell, McCook, and Crittenden, and endeavor to give them\r\ncommands that would be as near their rank and dates of commission\r\nas possible; but I was to do nothing until I heard further from\r\nhim on the subject, as he explained that he would have to consult\r\nthe Secretary of War before making final orders.  General Buell and\r\nhis officers had been subjected to a long ordeal by a court of\r\ninquiry, touching their conduct of the campaign in Tennessee and\r\nKentucky, that resulted in the battle of Perryville, or Chaplin's\r\nHills, October 8,1862, and they had been substantially acquitted;\r\nand, as it was manifest that we were to have some hard fighting, we\r\nwere anxious to bring into harmony every man and every officer of\r\nskill in the profession of arms.  Of these, Generals Buell and\r\nMcClellan were prominent in rank, and also by reason of their fame\r\nacquired in Mexico, as well as in the earlier part of the civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to Nashville I addressed myself to the task of\r\norganization and preparation, which involved the general security\r\nof the vast region of the South which had been already conquered,\r\nmore especially the several routes of supply and communication with\r\nthe active armies at the front, and to organize a large army to\r\nmove into Georgia, coincident with the advance of the Eastern\r\narmies against Richmond.  I soon received from Colonel J. B. Fry\r\n--now of the Adjutant-General's Department, but then at Washington in\r\ncharge of the Provost-Marshal-General's office--a letter asking me to\r\ndo something for General Buell.  I answered him frankly, telling him\r\nof my understanding with General Grant, and that I was still awaiting\r\nthe expected order of the War Department, assigning General Buell to\r\nmy command.  Colonel Fry, as General Buell's special friend, replied\r\nthat he was very anxious that I should make specific application for\r\nthe services of General Buell by name, and inquired what I proposed\r\nto offer him.  To this I answered that, after the agreement with\r\nGeneral Grant that he would notify me from Washington, I could not\r\nwith propriety press the matter, but if General Buell should be\r\nassigned to me specifically I was prepared to assign him to command\r\nall the troops on the Mississippi River from Cairo to Natchez,\r\ncomprising about three divisions, or the equivalent of a corps\r\nd'armée.  General Grant never afterward communicated to me on the\r\nsubject at all; and I inferred that Mr. Stanton, who was notoriously\r\nvindictive in his prejudices, would not consent to the employment of\r\nthese high officers.  General Buell, toward the close of the war,\r\npublished a bitter political letter, aimed at General Grant,\r\nreflecting on his general management of the war, and stated that both\r\nGenerals Canby and Sherman had offered him a subordinate command,\r\nwhich he had declined because he had once outranked us.  This was not\r\ntrue as to me, or Canby either, I think, for both General Canby and I\r\nranked him at West Point and in the old army, and he (General Buell)\r\nwas only superior to us in the date of his commission as\r\nmajor-general, for a short period in 1862.  This newspaper\r\ncommunication, though aimed at General Grant, reacted on himself, for\r\nit closed his military career.  General Crittenden afterward obtained\r\nauthority for service, and I offered him a division, but he declined\r\nit for the reason, as I understood it, that he had at one time\r\ncommanded a corps.  He is now in the United States service,\r\ncommanding the Seventeenth Infantry.  General McCook obtained a\r\ncommand under General Canby, in the Department of the Gulf, where he\r\nrendered good service, and he is also in the regular service,\r\nlieutenant-colonel Tenth Infantry.\r\n\r\nI returned to Nashville from Cincinnati about the 25th of March,\r\nand started at once, in a special car attached to the regular\r\ntrain, to inspect my command at the front, going to Pulaski,\r\nTennessee, where I found General G. M. Dodge; thence to Huntsville,\r\nAlabama, where I had left a part of my personal staff and the\r\nrecords of the department during the time we had been absent at\r\nMeridian; and there I found General McPherson, who had arrived from\r\nVicksburg, and had assumed command of the Army of the Tennessee.\r\nGeneral McPherson accompanied me, and we proceeded by the cars to\r\nStevenson, Bridgeport, etc., to Chattanooga, where we spent a day\r\nor two with General George H.  Thomas, and then continued on to\r\nKnoxville, where was General Schofield.  He returned with us to\r\nChattanooga, stopping by the way a few hours at Loudon, where were\r\nthe headquarters of the Fourth Corps (Major-General Gordon\r\nGranger).  General Granger, as usual, was full of complaints at the\r\ntreatment of his corps since I had left him with General Burnside,\r\nat Knoxville, the preceding November; and he stated to me\r\npersonally that he had a leave of absence in his pocket, of which\r\nhe intended to take advantage very soon.  About the end of March,\r\ntherefore, the three army commanders and myself were together at\r\nChattanooga.  We had nothing like a council of war, but conversed\r\nfreely and frankly on all matters of interest then in progress or\r\nimpending.  We all knew that, as soon as the spring was fairly\r\nopen, we should have to move directly against our antagonist,\r\nGeneral Jos. E. Johnston, then securely intrenched at Dalton,\r\nthirty miles distant; and the purpose of our conference at the time\r\nwas to ascertain our own resources, and to distribute to each part\r\nof the army its appropriate share of work.  We discussed every\r\npossible contingency likely to arise, and I simply instructed each\r\narmy commander to make immediate preparations for a hard campaign,\r\nregulating the distribution of supplies that were coming up by rail\r\nfrom Nashville as equitably as possible.  We also agreed on some\r\nsubordinate changes in the organization of the three separate\r\narmies which were destined to take the field; among which was the\r\nconsolidation of the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps (Howard and Slocum)\r\ninto a single corps, to be commanded by General Jos. Hooker.\r\nGeneral Howard was to be transferred to the Fourth Corps, vice\r\nGordon Granger to avail himself of his leave of absence; and\r\nGeneral Slocum was to be ordered down the Mississippi River, to\r\ncommand the District of Vicksburg.  These changes required the\r\nconsent of the President, and were all in due time approved.\r\n\r\nThe great question of the campaign was one of supplies.  Nashville,\r\nour chief depot, was itself partially in a hostile country, and\r\neven the routes of supply from Louisville to Nashville by rail, and\r\nby way of the Cumberland River, had to be guarded.  Chattanooga\r\n(our starting-point) was one hundred and thirty-six miles in front\r\nof Nashville, and every foot of the way, especially the many\r\nbridges, trestles, and culverts, had to be strongly guarded against\r\nthe acts of a local hostile population and of the enemy's cavalry.\r\nThen, of course, as we advanced into Georgia, it was manifest that\r\nwe should have to repair the railroad, use it, and guard it\r\nlikewise: General Thomas's army was much the largest of the three,\r\nwas best provided, and contained the best corps of engineers,\r\nrailroad managers, and repair parties, as well as the best body of\r\nspies and provost-marshals.  On him we were therefore compelled in a\r\ngreat measure to rely for these most useful branches of service.  He\r\nhad so long exercised absolute command and control over the railroads\r\nin his department, that the other armies were jealous, and these\r\nthought the Army of the Cumberland got the lion's share of the\r\nsupplies and other advantages of the railroads.  I found a good deal\r\nof feeling in the Army of the Tennessee on this score, and therefore\r\ntook supreme control of the roads myself, placed all the army\r\ncommanders on an equal footing, and gave to each the same control, so\r\nfar as orders of transportation for men and stores were concerned.\r\nThomas's spies brought him frequent and accurate reports of Jos. E.\r\nJohnston's army at Dalton, giving its strength anywhere between forty\r\nand fifty thousand men, and these were being reenforced by troops\r\nfrom Mississippi, and by the Georgia militia, under General G. W.\r\nSmith.  General Johnston seemed to be acting purely on the defensive,\r\nso that we had time and leisure to take all our measures deliberately\r\nand fully.  I fixed the date of May 1st, when all things should be in\r\nreadiness for the grand forward movement, and then returned to\r\nNashville; General Schofield going back to Knoxville, and McPherson\r\nto Huntsville, Thomas remaining at Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of April, at Nashville, I wrote to General Grant, then at\r\nWashington, reporting to him the results of my visit to the several\r\narmies, and asked his consent to the several changes proposed,\r\nwhich was promptly given by telegraph.  I then addressed myself\r\nspecially to the troublesome question of transportation and\r\nsupplies.  I found the capacity of the railroads from Nashville\r\nforward to Decatur, and to Chattanooga, so small, especially in the\r\nnumber of locomotives and care, that it was clear that they were\r\nbarely able to supply the daily wants of the armies then dependent\r\non them, with no power of accumulating a surplus in advance.  The\r\ncars were daily loaded down with men returning from furlough, with\r\ncattle, horses, etc.; and, by reason of the previous desolation of\r\nthe country between Chattanooga and Knoxville, General Thomas had\r\nauthorized the issue of provisions to the suffering inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe could not attempt an advance into Georgia without food,\r\nammunition, etc.; and ordinary prudence dictated that we should\r\nhave an accumulation at the front, in case of interruption to the\r\nrailway by the act of the enemy, or by common accident.\r\nAccordingly, on the 6th of April, I issued a general order,\r\nlimiting the use of the railroad-cars to transporting only the\r\nessential articles of food, ammunition, and supplies for the army\r\nproper, forbidding any further issues to citizens, and cutting off\r\nall civil traffic; requiring the commanders of posts within thirty\r\nmiles of Nashville to haul out their own stores in wagons;\r\nrequiring all troops destined for the front to march, and all\r\nbeef-cattle to be driven on their own legs.  This was a great help,\r\nbut of course it naturally raised a howl.  Some of the poor Union\r\npeople of East Tennessee appealed to President Lincoln, whose kind\r\nheart responded promptly to their request. He telegraphed me to know\r\nif I could not modify or repeal my orders; but I answered him that a\r\ngreat campaign was impending, on which the fate of the nation hung;\r\nthat our railroads had but a limited capacity, and could not provide\r\nfor the necessities of the army and of the people too; that one or\r\nthe other must quit, and we could not until the army of Jos. Johnston\r\nwas conquered, etc., etc.  Mr. Lincoln seemed to acquiesce, and I\r\nadvised the people to obtain and drive out cattle from Kentucky, and\r\nto haul out their supplies by the wagon-road from the same quarter,\r\nby way of Cumberland Gap.  By these changes we nearly or quite\r\ndoubled our daily accumulation of stores at the front, and yet even\r\nthis was not found enough.\r\n\r\nI accordingly called together in Nashville the master of\r\ntransportation, Colonel Anderson, the chief quartermaster, General\r\nJ. L. Donaldson, and the chief commissary, General Amos Beckwith,\r\nfor conference.  I assumed the strength of the army to move from\r\nChattanooga into Georgia at one hundred thousand men, and the\r\nnumber of animals to be fed, both for cavalry and draught, at\r\nthirty-five thousand; then, allowing for occasional wrecks of\r\ntrains, which were very common, and for the interruption of the\r\nroad itself by guerrillas and regular raids, we estimated it would\r\nrequire one hundred and thirty cars, of ten tons each, to reach\r\nChattanooga daily, to be reasonably certain of an adequate supply.\r\nEven with this calculation, we could not afford to bring forward\r\nhay for the horses and mules, nor more than five pounds of oats or\r\ncorn per day for each animal.  I was willing to risk the question\r\nof forage in part, because I expected to find wheat and corn\r\nfields, and a good deal of grass, as we advanced into Georgia at\r\nthat season of the year.  The problem then was to deliver at\r\nChattanooga and beyond one hundred and thirty car-loads daily,\r\nleaving the beef-cattle to be driven on the hoof, and all the\r\ntroops in excess of the usual train-guards to march by the ordinary\r\nroads.  Colonel Anderson promptly explained that he did not possess\r\ncars or locomotives enough to do this work.  I then instructed and\r\nauthorized him to hold on to all trains that arrived at Nashville\r\nfrom Louisville, and to allow none to go back until he had secured\r\nenough to fill the requirements of our problem.  At the time he\r\nonly had about sixty serviceable locomotives, and about six hundred\r\ncars of all kinds, and he represented that to provide for all\r\ncontingencies he must have at least one hundred locomotives and one\r\nthousand cars.  As soon as Mr. Guthrie, the President of the\r\nLouisville & Nashville Railroad, detected that we were holding on\r\nto all his locomotives and cars, he wrote me, earnestly\r\nremonstrating against it, saying that he would not be able with\r\ndiminished stock to bring forward the necessary stores from\r\nLouisville to Nashville.  I wrote to him, frankly telling him\r\nexactly how we were placed, appealed to his patriotism to stand by\r\nus, and advised him in like manner to hold on to all trains coming\r\ninto Jeffersonville, Indiana.  He and General Robert Allen, then\r\nquartermaster-general at Louisville, arranged a ferry-boat so as to\r\ntransfer the trains over the Ohio River from Jeffersonville, and in\r\na short time we had cars and locomotives from almost every road at\r\nthe North; months afterward I was amused to see, away down in\r\nGeorgia, cars marked \"Pittsburg & Fort Wayne,\" \"Delaware &\r\nLackawanna,\" \"Baltimore & Ohio,\" and indeed with the names of\r\nalmost every railroad north of the Ohio River.  How these railroad\r\ncompanies ever recovered their property, or settled their\r\ntransportation accounts, I have never heard, but to this fact, as\r\nmuch as to any other single fact, I attribute the perfect success\r\nwhich afterward attended our campaigns; and I have always felt\r\ngrateful to Mr. Guthrie, of Louisville, who had sense enough and\r\npatriotism enough to subordinate the interests of his railroad\r\ncompany to the cause of his country.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, viz., the early part of April, I was much\r\ndisturbed by a bold raid made by the rebel General Forrest up\r\nbetween the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers.  He reached the Ohio\r\nRiver at Paducah, but was handsomely repulsed by Colonel Hicks.  He\r\nthen swung down toward Memphis, assaulted and carried Fort Pillow,\r\nmassacring a part of its garrison, composed wholly of negro troops.\r\nAt first I discredited the story of the massacre, because, in\r\npreparing for the Meridian campaign, I had ordered Fort Pillow to\r\nbe evacuated, but it transpired afterward that General Hurlbut had\r\nretained a small garrison at Fort Pillow to encourage the\r\nenlistment of the blacks as soldiers, which was a favorite\r\npolitical policy at that day.  The massacre at Fort Pillow occurred\r\nApril 12, 1864, and has been the subject of congressional inquiry.\r\nNo doubt Forrest's men acted like a set of barbarians, shooting\r\ndown the helpless negro garrison after the fort was in their\r\npossession; but I am told that Forrest personally disclaims any\r\nactive participation in the assault, and that he stopped the firing\r\nas soon as he could.  I also take it for granted that Forrest did\r\nnot lead the assault in person, and consequently that he was to the\r\nrear, out of sight if not of hearing at the time, and I was told by\r\nhundreds of our men, who were at various times prisoners in\r\nForrest's possession, that he was usually very kind to them.  He\r\nhad a desperate set of fellows under him, and at that very time\r\nthere is no doubt the feeling of the Southern people was fearfully\r\nsavage on this very point of our making soldiers out of their late\r\nslaves, and Forrest may have shared the feeling.\r\n\r\nI also had another serious cause of disturbance about that time.  I\r\nwanted badly the two divisions of troops which had been loaned to\r\nGeneral Banks in the month of March previously, with the express\r\nunderstanding that their absence was to endure only one month, and\r\nthat during April they were to come out of Red River, and be again\r\nwithin the sphere of my command.  I accordingly instructed one of\r\nmy inspector-generals, John M.  Corse, to take a fleet steamboat at\r\nNashville, proceed via Cairo, Memphis, and Vicksburg, to General\r\nBanks up the Red River, and to deliver the following letter of\r\nApril 3d, as also others, of like tenor, to Generals A. J. Smith\r\nand Fred Steele, who were supposed to be with him:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, April 3, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General N. P. BANKS, commanding Department of the Gulf, Red\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: The thirty days for which I loaned you the command of\r\nGeneral A. J. Smith will expire on the 10th instant.  I send with\r\nthis Brigadier-General J. M. Corse, to carry orders to General A.\r\nJ. Smith, and to give directions for a new movement, which is\r\npreliminary to the general campaign.  General Corse may see you and\r\nexplain in full, but, lest he should not find you in person, I will\r\nsimply state that Forrest, availing himself of the absence of our\r\nfurloughed men and of the detachment with you, has pushed up\r\nbetween the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers, even to the Ohio.  He\r\nattacked Paducah, but got the worst of it, and he still lingers\r\nabout the place.  I hope that he will remain thereabouts till\r\nGeneral A. J. Smith can reach his destined point, but this I can\r\nhardly expect; yet I want him to reach by the Yazoo a position near\r\nGrenada, thence to operate against Forrest, after which to march\r\nacross to Decatur, Alabama.  You will see that he has a big job,\r\nand therefore should start at once.  From all that I can learn, my\r\ntroops reached Alexandria, Louisiana, at the time agreed on, viz.,\r\nMarch 17th, and I hear of them at Natchitoches, but cannot hear of\r\nyour troops being above Opelousas.\r\n\r\nSteele is also moving.  I leave Steele's entire force to cooperate\r\nwith you and the navy, but, as I before stated, I must have A. T.\r\nSmith's troops now as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI beg you will expedite their return to Vicksburg, if they have not\r\nalready started, and I want them if possible to remain in the same\r\nboats they have used up Red River, as it will save the time\r\notherwise consumed in transfer to other boats.\r\n\r\nAll is well in this quarter, and I hope by the time you turn\r\nagainst Mobile our forces will again act toward the same end,\r\nthough from distant points.  General Grant, now having lawful\r\ncontrol, will doubtless see that all minor objects are disregarded,\r\nand that all the armies act on a common plan.\r\n\r\nHoping, when this reaches you, that you will be in possession of\r\nShreveport, I am, with great respect, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nRumors were reaching us thick and fast of defeat and disaster in\r\nthat quarter; and I feared then, what afterward actually happened,\r\nthat neither General Banks nor Admiral Porter could or would spare\r\nthose two divisions.  On the 23d of April, General Corse returned,\r\nbringing full answers to my letters, and I saw that we must go on\r\nwithout them.  This was a serious loss to the Army of the\r\nTennessee, which was also short by two other divisions that were on\r\ntheir veteran furlough, and were under orders to rendezvous at\r\nCairo, before embarking for Clifton, on the Tennessee River.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of April, 1864, the headquarters of the three Armies of\r\nthe Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio, were at Chattanooga.,\r\nHuntsville, and Knoxville, and the tables on page 16, et seq., give\r\ntheir exact condition and strength.\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Arkansas was then subject to my command, but\r\nGeneral Fred Steele, its commander, was at Little Rock, remote from\r\nme, acting in cooperation with General Banks, and had full\r\nemployment for every soldier of his command; so that I never\r\ndepended on him for any men, or for any participation in the\r\nGeorgia campaign.  Soon after, viz., May 8th, that department was\r\ntransferred to the Military Division of \"the Gulf,\" or \"Southwest,\"\r\nMajor-General E.  R. S. Canby commanding, and General Steele served\r\nwith him in the subsequent movement against Mobile.\r\n\r\nIn Generals Thomas, McPherson, and Schofield, I had three generals\r\nof education and experience, admirably qualified for the work\r\nbefore us.  Each has made a history of his own, and I need not here\r\ndwell on their respective merits as men, or as commanders of\r\narmies, except that each possessed special qualities of mind and of\r\ncharacter which fitted them in the highest degree for the work then\r\nin contemplation.\r\n\r\nBy the returns of April 10, 1864, it will be seen that the\r\nArmy of the Cumberland had on its muster-rolls--\r\n\r\n                                       Men.\r\nPresent and absent...................171,450\r\nPresent for duty..................... 88,883\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Tennessee--\r\nPresent and absent....................134,763\r\nPresent for duty...................... 64,957\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Ohio--\r\nPresent and absent ................... 46,052\r\nPresent for duty ..................... 26,242\r\n\r\n\r\nThe department and army commanders had to maintain strong garrisons\r\nin their respective departments, and also to guard their respective\r\nlines of supply.  I therefore, in my mind, aimed to prepare out of\r\nthese three armies, by the 1st of May, 1864, a compact army for\r\nactive operations in Georgia, of about the following numbers:\r\n\r\nArmy of the Cumberland................ 50,000\r\nArmy of the Tennessee................. 35,000\r\nArmy of the Ohio ..................... 15,000\r\n\r\nTotal ............................... 100,000\r\n\r\nand, to make these troops as mobile as possible, I made the\r\nstrictest possible orders in relation to wagons and all species of\r\nincumbrances and impedimenta whatever.  Each officer and soldier\r\nwas required to carry on his horse or person food and clothing\r\nenough for five days.  To each regiment was allowed but one wagon\r\nand one ambulance, and to the officers of each company one pack\r\nhorse or mule.\r\n\r\nEach division and brigade was provided a fair proportion of wagons\r\nfor a supply train, and these were limited in their loads to carry\r\nfood, ammunition, and clothing.  Tents were forbidden to all save\r\nthe sick and wounded, and one tent only was allowed to each\r\nheadquarters for use as an office.  These orders were not\r\nabsolutely enforced, though in person I set the example, and did\r\nnot have a tent, nor did any officer about me have one; but we had\r\nwall tent-flies, without poles, and no tent-furniture of any kind.\r\nWe usually spread our flies over saplings, or on fence-rails or\r\nposts improvised on the spot.  Most of the general officers, except\r\nThomas, followed my example strictly; but he had a regular\r\nheadquarters-camp.  I frequently called his attention to the orders\r\non this subject, rather jestingly than seriously.  He would break\r\nout against his officers for having such luxuries, but, needing a\r\ntent himself, and being good-natured and slow to act, he never\r\nenforced my orders perfectly.  In addition to his regular\r\nwagon-train, he had a big wagon which could be converted into an\r\noffice, and this we used to call \"Thomas's circus.\" Several times\r\nduring the campaign I found quartermasters hid away in some\r\ncomfortable nook to the rear, with tents and mess-fixtures which\r\nwere the envy of the passing soldiers; and I frequently broke them\r\nup, and distributed the tents to the surgeons of brigades.  Yet my\r\norders actually reduced the transportation, so that I doubt if any\r\narmy ever went forth to battle with fewer impedimenta, and where\r\nthe regular and necessary supplies of food, ammunition, and\r\nclothing, were issued, as called for, so regularly and so well.\r\n\r\nMy personal staff was then composed of Captain J. C. McCoy,\r\naide-de-camp; Captain L. M. Dayton, aide-de-camp; Captain J. C.\r\nAudenried, aide-de-camp; Brigadier-General J. D. Webster, chief of\r\nstaff; Major R. M. Sawyer, assistant adjutant-general; Captain\r\nMontgomery Rochester, assistant adjutant-general.  These last three\r\nwere left at Nashville in charge of the office, and were empowered\r\nto give orders in my name, communication being generally kept up by\r\ntelegraph.\r\n\r\nSubsequently were added to my staff, and accompanied me in the\r\nfield, Brigadier-General W. F. Barry, chief of artillery; Colonel\r\nO. M. Poe, chief of engineers; Colonel L. C. Easton, chief\r\nquartermaster; Colonel Amos Beckwith, chief commissary; Captain\r\nThos. G. Baylor, chief of ordnance; Surgeon E. D.  Kittoe, medical\r\ndirector; Brigadier-General J. M. Corse, inspector-general;\r\nLieutenant-Colonel C. Ewing, inspector-general; and Lieutenant-\r\nColonel Willard Warner, inspector-general.\r\n\r\nThese officers constituted my staff proper at the beginning of the\r\ncampaign, which remained substantially the same till the close of\r\nthe war, with very few exceptions; viz.: Surgeon John Moore, United\r\nStates Army, relieved Surgeon Kittoe of the volunteers (about\r\nAtlanta) as medical director; Major Henry Hitchcock joined as\r\njudge-advocate, and Captain G. Ward Nichols reported as an extra\r\naide-de-camp (after the fall of Atlanta) at Gaylesville, just\r\nbefore we started for Savannah.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole month of April the preparations for active war\r\nwere going on with extreme vigor, and my letter-book shows an\r\nactive correspondence with Generals Grant, Halleck, Thomas,\r\nMcPherson, and Schofield on thousands of matters of detail and\r\narrangement, most of which are embraced in my testimony before the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War, vol. i., Appendix.\r\n\r\nWhen the time for action approached, viz., May 1, 1864, the actual\r\narmies prepared to move into Georgia resulted as follows, present\r\nfor battle:\r\n                                   Men.\r\nArmy of the Cumberland, Major-General THOMAS.\r\nInfantry ....................... 54,568\r\nArtillery ......................  2,377\r\nCavalry.........................  3,828\r\n        Aggregate............... 60,773\r\nNumber of field-guns, 130.\r\n\r\nArmy of the Tennessee, Major-General McPHERSON.\r\n\r\nInfantry ....................... 22,437\r\nArtillery ......................  1,404\r\nCavalry ........................    624\r\n         Aggregate ............. 24,465\r\nGuns, 96\r\n\r\n\r\nArmy of the Ohio, Major-General SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nInfantry ....................... 11,183\r\nArtillery.......................    679\r\nCavalry.........................  1,697\r\n        Aggregate .............. 13,559\r\nGuns, 28.\r\n\r\nGrand aggregate, 98,797 men and 254 guns\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures do not embrace the cavalry divisions which were still\r\nincomplete, viz., of General Stoneman, at Lexington, Kentucky, and\r\nof General Garrard, at Columbia, Tennessee, who were then rapidly\r\ncollecting horses, and joined us in the early stage of the\r\ncampaign.  General Stoneman, having a division of about four\r\nthousand men and horses, was attached to Schofield's Army of the\r\nOhio.  General Garrard's division, of about four thousand five\r\nhundred men and horses, was attached to General Thomas's command;\r\nand he had another irregular division of cavalry, commanded by\r\nBrigadier-General E.  McCook.  There was also a small brigade of\r\ncavalry, belonging to the Army of the Cumberland, attached\r\ntemporarily to the Army of the Tennessee, which was commanded by\r\nBrigadier-General Judson Kilpatrick.  These cavalry commands\r\nchanged constantly in strength and numbers, and were generally used\r\non the extreme flanks, or for some special detached service, as\r\nwill be herein-after related.  The Army of the Tennessee was still\r\nshort by the two divisions detached with General Banks, up Red\r\nRiver, and two other divisions on furlough in Illinois, Indiana,\r\nand Ohio, but which were rendezvousing at Cairo, under Generals\r\nLeggett and Crocker, to form a part of the Seventeenth Corps, which\r\ncorps was to be commanded by Major-General Frank P. Blair, then a\r\nmember of Congress, in Washington.  On the 2d of April I notified\r\nhim by letter that I wanted him to join and to command these two\r\ndivisions, which ought to be ready by the 1st of May.  General\r\nBlair, with these two divisions, constituting the Seventeenth Army\r\nCorps, did not actually overtake us until we reached Acworth and\r\nBig Shanty, in Georgia, about the 9th of June, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of April 4th to General John A. Rawlins, chief of\r\nstaff to General Grant at Washington, I described at length all the\r\npreparations that were in progress for the active campaign thus\r\ncontemplated, and therein estimated Schofield at twelve thousand,\r\nThomas at forty-five thousand, and McPherson at thirty thousand.\r\nAt first I intended to open the campaign about May 1st, by moving\r\nSchofield on Dalton from Cleveland, Thomas on the same objective\r\nfrom Chattanooga, and McPherson on Rome and Kingston from Gunter's\r\nLanding.  My intention was merely to threaten Dalton in front, and\r\nto direct McPherson to act vigorously against the railroad below\r\nResaca, far to the rear of the enemy.  But by reason of his being\r\nshort of his estimated strength by the four divisions before\r\nreferred to, and thus being reduced to about twenty-four thousand\r\nmen, I did not feel justified in placing him so far away from the\r\nsupport of the main body of the army, and therefore subsequently\r\nchanged the plan of campaign, so far as to bring that army up to\r\nChattanooga, and to direct it thence through Ship's Gap against the\r\nrailroad to Johnston's rear, at or near Resaca, distant from Dalton\r\nonly eighteen miles, and in full communication with the other\r\narmies by roads behind Rocky face Ridge, of about the same length.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of April I received General Grant's letter of April 4th\r\nfrom Washington, which formed the basis of all the campaigns of the\r\nyear 1864, and subsequently received another of April 19th, written\r\nfrom Culpepper, Virginia, both of which are now in my possession,\r\nin his own handwriting, and are here given entire.  These letters\r\nembrace substantially all the orders he ever made on this\r\nparticular subject, and these, it will be seen, devolved on me the\r\ndetails both as to the plan and execution of the campaign by the\r\narmies under my immediate command.  These armies were to be\r\ndirected against the rebel army commanded by General Joseph E.\r\nJohnston, then lying on the defensive, strongly intrenched at\r\nDalton, Georgia; and I was required to follow it up closely and\r\npersistently, so that in no event could any part be detached to\r\nassist General Lee in Virginia; General Grant undertaking in like\r\nmanner to keep Lee so busy that he could not respond to any calls\r\nof help by Johnston.  Neither Atlanta, nor Augusta, nor Savannah,\r\nwas the objective, but the \"army of Jos. Johnston,\" go where it\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\r\n[PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nWASHINGTON D. C., April 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: It is my design, if the enemy keep quiet and allow me to\r\ntake the initiative in the spring campaign, to work all parts of\r\nthe army together, and somewhat toward a common centre.  For your\r\ninformation I now write you my programme, as at present determined\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nI have sent orders to Banks, by private messenger, to finish up his\r\npresent expedition against Shreveport with all dispatch; to turn\r\nover the defense of Red River to General Steels and the navy, and\r\nto return your troops to you, and his own to New Orleans; to\r\nabandon all of Texas, except the Rio Grande, and to hold that with\r\nnot to exceed four thousand men; to reduce the number of troops on\r\nthe Mississippi to the lowest number necessary to hold it, and to\r\ncollect from his command not less than twenty-five thousand men.\r\nTo this I will add five thousand from Missouri.  With this force he\r\nis to commence operations against Mobile as soon as he can.  It\r\nwill be impossible for him to commence too early.\r\n\r\nGillmore joins Butler with ten thousand men, and the two operate\r\nagainst Richmond from the south aide of James River.  This will\r\ngive Butler thirty-three thousand men to operate with, W. F. Smith\r\ncommanding the right wing of his forces, and Gillmore the left\r\nwing.  I will stay with the Army of the Potomac, increased by\r\nBurnside's corps of not less than twenty-five thousand effective\r\nmen, and operate directly against Lee's army, wherever it may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nSigel collects all his available force in two columns, one, under\r\nOrd and Averill, to start from Beverly, Virginia, and the other,\r\nunder Crook, to start from Charleston, on the Kanawha, to move\r\nagainst the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad.\r\n\r\nCrook will have all cavalry, and will endeavor to get in about\r\nSaltville, and move east from there to join Ord.  His force will be\r\nall cavalry, while Ord will have from ten to twelve thousand men of\r\nall arms.\r\n\r\nYou I propose to move against Johnston's army, to break it up, and\r\nto get into the interior of the enemy's country as far as you can,\r\ninflicting all the damage you can against their war resources.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign, but simply\r\nto lay down the work it is desirable to have done, and leave you\r\nfree to execute it in your own way.  Submit to me, however, as\r\nearly as you can, your plan of operations.\r\n\r\nAs stated, Banks is ordered to commence operations as soon as he\r\ncan. Gillmore is ordered to report at Fortress Monroe by the 18th\r\ninst., or as soon thereafter as practicable.  Sigel is\r\nconcentrating now.  None will move from their places of rendezvous\r\nuntil I direct, except Banks.  I want to be ready to move by the\r\n25th inst., if possible; but all I can now direct is that you get\r\nready as soon as possible.  I know you will have difficulties to\r\nencounter in getting through the mountains to where supplies are\r\nabundant, but I believe you will accomplish it.\r\n\r\nFrom the expedition from the Department of West Virginia I do not\r\ncalculate on very great results; but it is the only way I can take\r\ntroops from there.  With the long line of railroad Sigel has to\r\nprotect, he can spare no troops, except to move directly to his\r\nfront.  In this way he must get through to inflict great damage on\r\nthe enemy, or the enemy must detach from one of his armies a large\r\nforce to prevent it.  In other words, if Sigel can't skin himself,\r\nhe can hold a leg while some one else skins.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, April 10, 1864\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, Commander-in-Chief, Washington, D.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: Your two letters of April 4th are now before me, and\r\nafford me infinite satisfaction.  That we are now all to act on a\r\ncommon plan, converging on a common centre, looks like enlightened\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nLike yourself, you take the biggest load, and from me you shall\r\nhave thorough and hearty cooperation.  I will not let side issues\r\ndraw me off from your main plans in which I am to knock Jos.\r\nJohnston, and to do as much damage to the resources of the enemy as\r\npossible.  I have heretofore written to General Rawlins and to\r\nColonel Comstock (of your staff) somewhat of the method in which I\r\npropose to act.  I have seen all my army, corps, and division\r\ncommanders, and have signified only to the former, viz., Schofield,\r\nThomas, and McPherson, our general plans, which I inferred from the\r\npurport of our conversation here and at Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nFirst, I am pushing stores to the front with all possible dispatch,\r\nand am completing the army organization according to the orders\r\nfrom Washington, which are ample and perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt will take us all of April to get in our furloughed veterans, to\r\nbring up A. J. Smith's command, and to collect provisions and\r\ncattle on the line of the Tennessee.  Each of the armies will\r\nguard, by detachments of its own, its rear communications.\r\n\r\nAt the signal to be given by you, Schofield, leaving a select\r\ngarrison at Knoxville and London, with twelve thousand men will\r\ndrop down to the Hiawassee, and march against Johnston's right by\r\nthe old Federal road.  Stoneman, now in Kentucky, organizing the\r\ncavalry forces of the Army of the Ohio, will operate with Schofield\r\non his left front--it may be, pushing a select body of about two\r\nthousand cavalry by Ducktown or Elijah toward Athens, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThomas will aim to have forty-five thousand men of all arms, and\r\nmove straight against Johnston, wherever he may be, fighting him\r\ncautiously, persistently, and to the best advantage.  He will have\r\ntwo divisions of cavalry, to take advantage of any offering.\r\n\r\nMcPherson will have nine divisions of the Army of the Tennessee, if\r\nA. J. Smith gets here, in which case he will have full thirty\r\nthousand of the best men in America.  He will cross the Tennessee\r\nat Decatur and Whitesburg, march toward Rome, and feel for Thomas.\r\nIf Johnston falls behind the Coosa, then McPherson will push for\r\nRome; and if Johnston falls behind the Chattahoochee, as I believe\r\nhe will, then McPherson will cross over and join Thomas.\r\n\r\nMcPherson has no cavalry, but I have taken one of Thomas's\r\ndivisions, viz., Garrard's, six thousand strong, which is now at\r\nColombia, mounting, equipping, and preparing.  I design this\r\ndivision to operate on McPherson's right, rear, or front, according\r\nas the enemy appears.  But the moment I detect Johnston falling\r\nbehind the Chattahoochee, I propose to cast off the effective part\r\nof this cavalry division, after crossing the Coosa, straight for\r\nOpelika, West Point, Columbus, or Wetumpka, to break up the road\r\nbetween Montgomery and Georgia.  If Garrard can do this work well,\r\nhe can return to the Union army; but should a superior force\r\ninterpose, then he will seek safety at Pensacola and join Banks,\r\nor, after rest, will act against any force that he can find east of\r\nMobile, till such time as he can reach me.\r\n\r\nShould Johnston fall behind the Chattahoochee, I will feign to the\r\nright, but pass to the left and act against Atlanta or its eastern\r\ncommunications, according to developed facts.\r\n\r\nThis is about as far ahead as I feel disposed, to look, but I will\r\never bear in mind that Johnston is at all times to be kept so busy\r\nthat he cannot in any event send any part of his command against\r\nyou or Banks.\r\n\r\nIf Banks can at the same time carry Mobile and open up the Alabama\r\nRiver, he will in a measure solve the most difficult part of my\r\nproblem, viz., \"provisions.\" But in that I must venture.  Georgia\r\nhas a million of inhabitants.  If they can live, we should not\r\nstarve.  If the enemy interrupt our communications, I will be\r\nabsolved from all obligations to subsist on our own resources, and\r\nwill feel perfectly justified in taking whatever and wherever we\r\ncan find. I will inspire my command, if successful, with the\r\nfeeling that beef and salt are all that is absolutely necessary to\r\nlife, and that parched corn once fed General Jackson's army on that\r\nvery ground.\r\nAs ever, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCULPEPPER COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA, April 19, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Since my letter to you of April 4th I have seen no reason\r\nto change any portion of the general plan of campaign, if the enemy\r\nremain still and allow us to take the initiative.  Rain has\r\ncontinued so uninterruptedly until the last day or two that it will\r\nbe impossible to move, however, before the 27th, even if no more\r\nshould fall in the meantime.  I think Saturday, the 30th, will\r\nprobably be the day for our general move.\r\n\r\nColonel Comstock, who will take this, can spend a day with you, and\r\nfill up many little gaps of information not given in any of my\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nWhat I now want more particularly to say is, that if the two main\r\nattacks, yours and the one from here, should promise great success,\r\nthe enemy may, in a fit of desperation, abandon one part of their\r\nline of defense, and throw their whole strength upon the other,\r\nbelieving a single defeat without any victory to sustain them\r\nbetter than a defeat all along their line, and hoping too, at the\r\nsame time, that the army, meeting with no resistance, will rest\r\nperfectly satisfied with their laurels, having penetrated to a\r\ngiven point south, thereby enabling them to throw their force first\r\nupon one and then on the other.\r\n\r\nWith the majority of military commanders they might do this.\r\n\r\nBut you have had too much experience in traveling light, and\r\nsubsisting upon the country, to be caught by any such ruse.  I hope\r\nmy experience has not been thrown away.  My directions, then, would\r\nbe, if the enemy in your front show signs of joining Lee, follow\r\nhim up to the full extent of your ability.  I will prevent the\r\nconcentration of Lee upon your front, if it is in the power of this\r\narmy to do it.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac looks well, and, so far as I can judge,\r\nofficers and men feel well.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, April 24, 1864\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, Commander-in-Chief,\r\nCulpepper, Virginia\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I now have, at the hands of Colonel Comstock, of your\r\nstaff, the letter of April 19th, and am as far prepared to assume\r\nthe offensive as possible.  I only ask as much time as you think\r\nproper, to enable me to get up McPherson's two divisions from\r\nCairo.  Their furloughs will expire about this time, and some of\r\nthem should now be in motion for Clifton, whence they will march to\r\nDecatur, to join General Dodge.\r\n\r\nMcPherson is ordered to assemble the Fifteenth Corps near Larkin's,\r\nand to get the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Corps (Dodge and Blair) at\r\nDecatur at the earliest possible moment.  From these two points he\r\nwill direct his forces on Lebanon, Summerville, and Lafayette,\r\nwhere he will act against Johnston, if he accept battle at Dalton;\r\nor move in the direction of Rome, if the enemy give up Dalton, and\r\nfall behind the Oostenaula or Etowah.  I see that there is some\r\nrisk in dividing our forces, but Thomas and Schofield will have\r\nstrength enough to cover all the valleys as far as Dalton; and,\r\nshould Johnston turn his whole force against McPherson, the latter\r\nwill have his bridge at Larkin's, and the route to Chattanooga via\r\nWilla's Valley and the Chattanooga Creek, open for retreat; and if\r\nJohnston attempt to leave Dalton, Thomas will have force enough to\r\npush on through Dalton to Kingston, which will checkmate him.  My\r\nown opinion is that Johnston will be compelled to hang to his\r\nrailroad, the only possible avenue of supply to his army, estimated\r\nat from forty-five to sixty thousand men.\r\n\r\nAt Lafayette all our armies will be together, and if Johnston\r\nstands at Dalton we must attack him in position.  Thomas feels\r\ncertain that he has no material increase of force, and that he has\r\nnot sent away Hardee, or any part of his army.  Supplies are the\r\ngreat question.  I have materially increased the number of cars\r\ndaily.  When I got here, the average was from sixty-five to eighty\r\nper day.  Yesterday the report was one hundred and ninety-three;\r\nto-day, one hundred and thirty-four; and my estimate is that one\r\nhundred and forty-five cars per day will give us a day's supply and\r\na day's accumulation.\r\n\r\nMcPherson is ordered to carry in wagons twenty day's rations, and\r\nto rely on the depot at Ringgold for the renewal of his bread.\r\nBeeves are now being driven on the hoof to the front; and the\r\ncommissary, Colonel Beckwith, seems fully alive to the importance\r\nof the whole matter.\r\n\r\nOur weakest point will be from the direction of Decatur, and I will\r\nbe forced to risk something from that quarter, depending on the\r\nfact that the enemy has no force available with which to threaten\r\nour communications from that direction.\r\n\r\nColonel Comstock will explain to you personally much that I cannot\r\ncommit to paper.  I am, with great respect,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of April I removed my headquarters to Chattanooga, and\r\nprepared for taking the field in person.  General Grant had first\r\nindicated the 30th of April as the day for the simultaneous\r\nadvance, but subsequently changed the day to May 5th.  McPhersons\r\ntroops were brought forward rapidly to Chattanooga, partly by rail\r\nand partly by marching.  Thomas's troops were already in position\r\n(his advance being out as far as Ringgold-eighteen miles), and\r\nSchofield was marching down by Cleveland to Red Clay and Catoosa\r\nSprings.  On the 4th of May, Thomas was in person at Ringgold, his\r\nleft at Catoosa, and his right at Leet's Tan-yard.  Schofield was\r\nat Red Clay, closing upon Thomas's left; and McPherson was moving\r\nrapidly into Chattanooga, and out toward Gordon's Mill.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th I rode out to Ringgold, and on the very day appointed by\r\nGeneral Grant from his headquarters in Virginia the great campaign\r\nwas begun.  To give all the minute details will involve more than\r\nis contemplated, and I will endeavor only to trace the principal\r\nevents, or rather to record such as weighed heaviest on my own mind\r\nat the time, and which now remain best fixed in my memory.\r\n\r\nMy general headquarters and official records remained back at\r\nNashville, and I had near me only my personal staff and\r\ninspectors-general, with about half a dozen wagons, and a single\r\ncompany of Ohio sharp-shooters (commanded by Lieutenant McCrory) as\r\nheadquarters or camp guard.  I also had a small company of\r\nirregular Alabama cavalry (commanded by Lieutenant Snelling), used\r\nmostly as orderlies and couriers.  No wall-tents were allowed, only\r\nthe flies.  Our mess establishment was less in bulk than that of\r\nany of the brigade commanders; nor was this from an indifference to\r\nthe ordinary comforts of life, but because I wanted to set the\r\nexample, and gradually to convert all parts of that army into a\r\nmobile machine, willing and able to start at a minute's notice, and\r\nto subsist on the scantiest food.  To reap absolute success might\r\ninvolve the necessity even of dropping all wagons, and to subsist\r\non the chance food which the country was known to contain.  I had\r\nobtained not only the United States census-tables of 1860, but a\r\ncompilation made by the Controller of the State of Georgia for the\r\npurpose of taxation, containing in considerable detail the\r\n\"population and statistics\" of every county in Georgia.  One of my\r\naides (Captain Dayton) acted as assistant adjutant general, with an\r\norder-book, letter-book, and writing-paper, that filled a small\r\nchest not much larger than an ordinary candle-boa.  The only\r\nreports and returns called for were the ordinary tri-monthly\r\nreturns of \"effective strength.\"  As these accumulated they were\r\nsent back to Nashville, and afterward were embraced in the archives\r\nof the Military Division of the Mississippi, changed in 1865 to the\r\nMilitary Division of the Missouri, and I suppose they were burned\r\nin the Chicago fire of 1870.  Still, duplicates remain of all\r\nessential papers in the archives of the War Department.\r\n\r\nThe 6th of May was given to Schofield and McPherson to get into\r\nposition, and on the 7th General Thomas moved in force against\r\nTunnel Hill, driving off a mere picket-guard of the enemy, and I\r\nwas agreeably surprised to find that no damage had been done to the\r\ntunnel or the railroad.  From Tunnel Hill I could look into the\r\ngorge by which the railroad passed through a straight and\r\nwell-defined range of mountains, presenting sharp palisade faces,\r\nand known as \"Rocky Face.\"  The gorge itself was called the\r\n\"Buzzard Roost.\"  We could plainly see the enemy in this gorge and\r\nbehind it, and Mill Creek which formed the gorge, flowing toward\r\nDalton, had been dammed up, making a sort of irregular lake,\r\nfilling the road, thereby obstructing it, and the enemy's batteries\r\ncrowned the cliffs on either side.  The position was very strong,\r\nand I knew that such a general as was my antagonist (Jos.\r\nJohnston), who had been there six months, had fortified it to the\r\nmaximum.  Therefore I had no intention to attack the position\r\nseriously in front, but depended on McPherson to capture and hold\r\nthe railroad to its rear, which would force Johnston to detach\r\nlargely against him, or rather, as I expected, to evacuate his\r\nposition at Dalton altogether.  My orders to Generals Thomas and\r\nSchofield were merely to press strongly at all points in front,\r\nready to rush in on the first appearance of \"let go,\" and, if\r\npossible, to catch our enemy in the confusion of retreat.\r\n\r\nAll the movements of the 7th and 8th were made exactly as ordered,\r\nand the enemy seemed quiescent, acting purely on the defensive.\r\n\r\nI had constant communication with all parts of the army, and on the\r\n9th McPherson's head of column entered and passed through Snake\r\nCreek, perfectly undefended, and accomplished a complete surprise\r\nto the enemy.  At its farther debouche he met a cavalry brigade,\r\neasily driven, which retreated hastily north toward Dalton, and\r\ndoubtless carried to Johnston the first serious intimation that a\r\nheavy force of infantry and artillery was to his rear and within a\r\nfew miles of his railroad.  I got a short note from McPherson that\r\nday (written at 2 p.m., when he was within a mile and a half of the\r\nrailroad, above and near Resaca), and we all felt jubilant.  I\r\nrenewed orders to Thomas and Schofield to be ready for the instant\r\npursuit of what I expected to be a broken and disordered army,\r\nforced to retreat by roads to the east of Resaca, which were known\r\nto be very rough and impracticable.\r\n\r\nThat night I received further notice from McPherson that he had\r\nfound Resaca too strong for a surprise; that in consequence he had\r\nfallen back three miles to the month of Snake Creek Gap, and was\r\nthere fortified.  I wrote him the next day the following letters,\r\ncopies of which are in my letter-book; but his to me were mere\r\nnotes in pencil, not retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, TUNNEL HILL, GEORGIA, May 11, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General McPHERSON, commanding army of the Tennessee,\r\nSugar Valley, Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I received by courier (in the night) yours of 5 and 8.30\r\nP. M. of yesterday.\r\n\r\nYou now have your twenty-three thousand men, and General Hooker is\r\nin close support, so that you can hold all of Jos. Johnston's army\r\nin check should he abandon Dalton.  He cannot afford to abandon\r\nDalton, for he has fixed it up on purpose to receive us, and he\r\nobserves that we are close at hand, waiting for him to quit.  He\r\ncannot afford a detachment strong enough to fight you, as his army\r\nwill not admit of it.\r\n\r\nStrengthen your position; fight any thing that comes; and threaten\r\nthe safety of the railroad all the time.  But, to tell the truth, I\r\nwould rather the enemy would stay in Dalton two more days, when he\r\nmay find in his rear a larger party than he expects in an open\r\nfield.  At all events, we can then choose our own ground, and he\r\nwill be forced to move out of his works.  I do not intend to put a\r\ncolumn into Buzzard-Roost Gap at present.\r\n\r\nSee that you are in easy communication with me and with all\r\nhead-quarters.  After to-day the supplies will be at Ringgold.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, TUNNEL HILL, GEORGIA, May 11, 1864-Evening\r\n\r\nMajor-General McPHERSON, commanding army of the Tennessee,\r\nSugar Valley, Georgia\r\n\r\nGENERAL: The indications are that Johnston is evacuating Dalton.\r\nIn that event, Howard's corps and the cavalry will pursue; all the\r\nrest will follow your route.  I will be down early in the morning.\r\n\r\nTry to strike him if possible about the forks of the road.\r\n\r\nHooker must be with you now, and you may send General Garrard by\r\nSummerville to threaten Rome and that flank.  I will cause all the\r\nlines to be felt at once.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, major-general commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcPherson had startled Johnston in his fancied security, but had\r\nnot done the full measure of his work.  He had in hand twenty-three\r\nthousand of the best men of the army, and could have walked into\r\nResaca (then held only by a small brigade), or he could have placed\r\nhis whole force astride the railroad above Resaca, and there have\r\neasily withstood the attack of all of Johnston's army, with the\r\nknowledge that Thomas and Schofield were on his heels.  Had he done\r\nso, I am certain that Johnston would not have ventured to attack\r\nhim in position, but would have retreated eastward by Spring Place,\r\nand we should have captured half his army and all his artillery and\r\nwagons at the very beginning of the campaign.\r\n\r\nSuch an opportunity does not occur twice in a single life, but at\r\nthe critical moment McPherson seems to have been a little cautious.\r\nStill, he was perfectly justified by his orders, and fell back and\r\nassumed an unassailable defensive position in Sugar Valley, on the\r\nResaca side of Snake-Creek Gap.  As soon as informed of this, I\r\ndetermined to pass the whole army through Snake-Creek Gap, and to\r\nmove on Resaca with the main army.\r\n\r\nBut during the 10th, the enemy showed no signs of evacuating\r\nDalton, and I was waiting for the arrival of Garrard's and\r\nStoneman's cavalry, known to be near at hand, so as to secure the\r\nfull advantages of victory, of which I felt certain.  Hooker's\r\nTwentieth Corps was at once moved down to within easy supporting\r\ndistance of McPherson; and on the 11th, perceiving signs of\r\nevacuation of Dalton, I gave all the orders for the general\r\nmovement, leaving the Fourth Corps (Howard) and Stoneman's cavalry\r\nin observation in front of Buzzard-Roost Gap, and directing all the\r\nrest of the army to march through Snake-Creek Gap, straight on\r\nResaca.  The roads were only such as the country afforded, mere\r\nrough wagon-ways, and these converged to the single narrow track\r\nthrough Snake-Creek Gap; but during the 12th and 13th the bulk of\r\nThomas's and Schofield's armies were got through, and deployed\r\nagainst Resaca, McPherson on the right, Thomas in the centre, and\r\nSchofield on the left.  Johnston, as I anticipated, had abandoned\r\nall his well-prepared defenses at Dalton, and was found inside of\r\nResaca with the bulk of his army, holding his divisions well in\r\nhand, acting purely on the defensive, and fighting well at all\r\npoints of conflict.  A complete line of intrenchments was found\r\ncovering the place, and this was strongly manned at all points.  On\r\nthe 14th we closed in, enveloping the town on its north and west,\r\nand during the 15th we had a day of continual battle and skirmish.\r\nAt the same time I caused two pontoon-bridges to be laid across the\r\nOostenaula River at Lay's Ferry, about three miles below the town,\r\nby which we could threaten Calhoun, a station on the railroad seven\r\nmiles below Resaca.  At the same time, May 14th, I dispatched\r\nGeneral Garrard, with his cavalry division, down the Oostenaula by\r\nthe Rome road, with orders to cross over, if possible, and to\r\nattack or threaten the railroad at any point below Calhoun and\r\nabove Kingston.\r\n\r\nDuring the 15th, without attempting to assault the fortified works,\r\nwe pressed at all points, and the sound of cannon and musketry rose\r\nall day to the dignity of a battle.  Toward evening McPherson moved\r\nhis whole line of battle forward, till he had gained a ridge\r\noverlooking the town, from which his field-artillery could reach\r\nthe railroad-bridge across the Oostenaula.  The enemy made several\r\nattempts to drive him away, repeating the sallies several times,\r\nand extending them into the night; but in every instance he was\r\nrepulsed with bloody loss.\r\n\r\nHooker's corps had also some heavy and handsome fighting that\r\nafternoon and night on the left, where the Dalton roan entered the\r\nintrenchments, capturing a four-gun intrenched battery, with its\r\nmen and guns; and generally all our men showed the finest fighting\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nHoward's corps had followed Johnston down from Dalton, and was in\r\nline; Stoneman's division of cavalry had also got up, and was on\r\nthe extreme left, beyond the Oostenaula.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 15th Johnston got his army across the bridges,\r\nset them on fire, and we entered Resaca at daylight.  Our loss up\r\nto that time was about six hundred dead and thirty-three hundred\r\nand seventy-five wounded--mostly light wounds that did not\r\nnecessitate sending the men to the rear for treatment.  That\r\nJohnston had deliberately designed in advance to give up such\r\nstrong positions as Dalton and Resaca, for the purpose of drawing\r\nus farther south, is simply absurd.  Had he remained in Dalton\r\nanother hour, it would have been his total defeat, and he only\r\nevacuated Resaca because his safety demanded it.  The movement by\r\nus through Snake-Creek Gap was a total surprise to him.  My army\r\nabout doubled his in size, but he had all the advantages of natural\r\npositions, of artificial forts and roads, and of concentrated\r\naction.  We were compelled to grope our way through forests, across\r\nmountains, with a large army, necessarily more or less dispersed.\r\nOf course, I was disappointed not to have crippled his, army more\r\nat that particular stage of the game; but, as it resulted, these\r\nrapid successes gave us the initiative, and the usual impulse of a\r\nconquering army.\r\n\r\nJohnston having retreated in the night of May 15th, immediate\r\npursuit was begun.  A division of infantry (Jeff. C. Davis's) was\r\nat once dispatched down the valley toward Rome, to support\r\nGarrard's cavalry, and the whole army was ordered to pursue,\r\nMcPherson by Lay's Ferry, on the right, Thomas directly by the\r\nrailroad, and Schofield by the left, by the old road that crossed\r\nthe Oostenaula above Echota or Newtown.\r\n\r\nWe hastily repaired the railroad bridge at Resaca, which had been\r\npartially burned, and built a temporary floating bridge out of\r\ntimber and materials found on the spot; so that Thomas got his\r\nadvance corps over during the 16th, and marched as far as Calhoun,\r\nwhere he came into communication with McPherson's troops, which had\r\ncrossed the Oostenaula at Lay's Ferry by our pontoon-bridges,\r\npreviously laid.  Inasmuch as the bridge at Resaca was overtaxed,\r\nHooker's Twentieth Corps was also diverted to cross by the fords\r\nand ferries above Resaca, in the neighborhood of Echota.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, toward evening, the head of Thomas's column, Newton's\r\ndivision, encountered the rear-guard of Johnston's army near\r\nAdairsville.  I was near the head of column at the time, trying to\r\nget a view of the position of the enemy from an elevation in an\r\nopen field.  My party attracted the fire of a battery; a shell\r\npassed through the group of staff-officers and burst just beyond,\r\nwhich scattered us promptly.  The next morning the enemy had\r\ndisappeared, and our pursuit was continued to Kingston, which we\r\nreached during Sunday forenoon, the 19th.\r\n\r\nFrom Resaca the railroad runs nearly due south, but at Kingston it\r\nmakes junction with another railroad from Rome, and changes\r\ndirection due east. At that time McPherson's head of column was\r\nabout four miles to the west of Kingston, at a country place called\r\n\"Woodlawn;\" Schofield and Hooker were on the direct roads leading\r\nfrom Newtown to Casaville, diagonal to the route followed by\r\nThomas.  Thomas's head of column, which had followed the country\r\nroads alongside of the railroad, was about four miles east of\r\nKingston, toward Cassville, when about noon I got a message from\r\nhim that he had found the enemy, drawn up in line of battle, on\r\nsome extensive, open ground, about half-way between Kingston and\r\nCassville, and that appearances indicated a willingness and\r\npreparation for battle.\r\n\r\nHurriedly sending orders to McPherson to resume the march, to\r\nhasten forward by roads leading to the south of Kingston, so as to\r\nleave for Thomas's troops and trains the use of the main road, and\r\nto come up on his right, I rode forward rapidly, over some rough\r\ngravel hills, and about six miles from Kingston found General\r\nThomas, with his troops deployed; but he reported that the enemy\r\nhad fallen back in echelon of divisions, steadily and in superb\r\norder, into Cassville.  I knew that the roads by which Generals\r\nHooker and Schofield were approaching would lead them to a seminary\r\nnear Cassville, and that it was all-important to secure the point\r\nof junction of these roads with the main road along which we were\r\nmarching.  Therefore I ordered General Thomas to push forward his\r\ndeployed lines as rapidly as possible; and, as night was\r\napproaching, I ordered two field-batteries to close up at a gallop\r\non some woods which lay between us and the town of Cassville.  We\r\ncould not see the town by reason of these woods, but a high range\r\nof hills just back of the town was visible over the tree-tops.  On\r\nthese hills could be seen fresh-made parapets, and the movements of\r\nmen, against whom I directed the artillery to fire at long range.\r\nThe stout resistance made by the enemy along our whole front of a\r\ncouple of miles indicated a purpose to fight at Cassville; and, as\r\nthe night was closing in, General Thomas and I were together, along\r\nwith our skirmish-lines near the seminary, on the edge of the town,\r\nwhere musket-bullets from the enemy were cutting the leaves of the\r\ntrees pretty thickly about us.  Either Thomas or I remarked that\r\nthat was not the place for the two senior officers of a great army,\r\nand we personally went back to the battery, where we passed the\r\nnight on the ground.  During the night I had reports from\r\nMcPherson, Hooker, and Schofield.  The former was about five miles\r\nto my right rear, near the \"nitre-caves;\" Schofield was about six\r\nmiles north, and Hooker between us, within two miles.  All were\r\nordered to close down on Cassville at daylight, and to attack the\r\nenemy wherever found.  Skirmishing was kept up all night, but when\r\nday broke the next morning, May 20th, the enemy was gone, and our\r\ncavalry was sent in pursuit.  These reported him beyond the Etowah\r\nRiver.  We were then well in advance of our railroad-trains, on\r\nwhich we depended for supplies; so I determined to pause a few days\r\nto repair the railroad, which had been damaged but little, except\r\nat the bridge at Resaca, and then to go on.\r\n\r\nNearly all the people of the country seemed to have fled with\r\nJohnston's army; yet some few families remained, and from one of\r\nthem I procured the copy of an order which Johnston had made at\r\nAdairsville, in which he recited that he had retreated as far as\r\nstrategy required, and that his army must be prepared for battle at\r\nCassville.  The newspapers of the South, many of which we found,\r\nwere also loud in denunciation of Johnston's falling back before us\r\nwithout a serious battle, simply resisting by his skirmish-lines\r\nand by his rear-guard.  But his friends proclaimed that it was all\r\nstrategic; that he was deliberately drawing us farther and farther\r\ninto the meshes, farther and farther away from our base of\r\nsupplies, and that in due season he would not only halt for battle,\r\nbut assume the bold offensive.  Of course it was to my interest to\r\nbring him to battle as soon as possible, when our numerical\r\nsuperiority was at the greatest; for he was picking up his\r\ndetachments as he fell back, whereas I was compelled to make\r\nsimilar and stronger detachments to repair the railroads as we\r\nadvanced, and to guard them.  I found at Cassville many evidences\r\nof preparation for a grand battle, among them a long line of fresh\r\nintrenchments on the hill beyond the town, extending nearly three\r\nmiles to the south, embracing the railroad-crossing.  I was also\r\nconvinced that the whole of Polk's corps had joined Johnston from\r\nMississippi, and that he had in hand three full corps, viz.,\r\nHood's, Polk's, and Hardee's, numbering about sixty thousand men,\r\nand could not then imagine why he had declined battle, and did not\r\nlearn the real reason till after the war was over, and then from\r\nGeneral Johnston himself.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1865, when in command of the Military Division of\r\nthe Missouri, I went from St. Louis to Little Rock, Arkansas, and\r\nafterward to Memphis.  Taking a steamer for Cairo, I found as\r\nfellow-passengers Generals Johnston and Frank Blair.  We were, of\r\ncourse, on the most friendly terms, and on our way up we talked\r\nover our battles again, played cards, and questioned each other as\r\nto particular parts of our mutual conduct in the game of war.  I\r\ntold Johnston that I had seen his order of preparation, in the\r\nnature of an address to his army, announcing his purpose to retreat\r\nno more, but to accept battle at Cassville.  He answered that such\r\nwas his purpose; that he had left Hardee's corps in the open fields\r\nto check Thomas, and gain time for his formation on the ridge, just\r\nbehind Cassville; and it was this corps which General Thomas had\r\nseen deployed, and whose handsome movement in retreat he had\r\nreported in such complimentary terms.  Johnston described how he\r\nhad placed Hood's corps on the right, Polk's in the centre, and\r\nHardee's on the left.  He said he had ridden over the ground, given\r\nto each corps commander his position, and orders to throw up\r\nparapets during the night; that he was with Hardee on his extreme\r\nleft as the night closed in, and as Hardee's troops fell back to\r\nthe position assigned them for the intended battle of the next day;\r\nand that, after giving Hardee some general instructions, he and his\r\nstaff rode back to Cassville.  As he entered the town, or village,\r\nhe met Generals Hood and Polk.  Hood inquired of him if he had had\r\nany thing to eat, and he said no, that he was both hungry and\r\ntired, when Hood invited him to go and share a supper which had\r\nbeen prepared for him at a house close by.  At the supper they\r\ndiscussed the chances of the impending battle, when Hood spoke of\r\nthe ground assigned him as being enfiladed by our (Union)\r\nartillery, which Johnston disputed, when General Polk chimed in\r\nwith the remark that General Hood was right; that the cannon-shots\r\nfired by us at nightfall had enfiladed their general line of\r\nbattle, and that for this reason he feared they could not hold\r\ntheir men.  General Johnston was surprised at this, for he\r\nunderstood General Hood to be one of those who professed to\r\ncriticise his strategy, contending that, instead of retreating, he\r\nshould have risked a battle.  General Johnston said he was\r\nprovoked, accused them of having been in conference, with being\r\nbeaten before battle, and added that he was unwilling to engage in\r\na critical battle with an army so superior to his own in numbers,\r\nwith two of his three corps commanders dissatisfied with the ground\r\nand positions assigned them.  He then and there made up his mind to\r\nretreat still farther south, to put the Etowah River and the\r\nAllatoona range between us; and he at once gave orders to resume\r\nthe retrograde movement.\r\n\r\nThis was my recollection of the substance of the conversation, of\r\nwhich I made no note at the time; but, at a meeting of the Society\r\nof the Army of the Cumberland some years after, at Cleveland, Ohio,\r\nabout 1868, in a short after-dinner speech, I related this\r\nconversation, and it got into print.  Subsequently, in the spring\r\nof 1870, when I was at New Orleans, on route for Texas, General\r\nHood called to see me at the St. Charles Hotel, explained that he\r\nhad seen my speech reprinted in the newspapers and gave me his\r\nversion of the same event, describing the halt at Cassville, the\r\ngeneral orders for battle on that ground, and the meeting at supper\r\nwith Generals Johnston and Polk, when the chances of the battle to\r\nbe fought the next day were freely and fully discussed; and he\r\nstated that he had argued against fighting the battle purely on the\r\ndefensive, but had asked General Johnston to permit him with his\r\nown corps and part of Polk's to quit their lines, and to march\r\nrapidly to attack and overwhelm Schofield, who was known to be\r\nseparated from Thomas by an interval of nearly five miles, claiming\r\nthat he could have defeated Schofield, and got back to his position\r\nin time to meet General Thomas's attack in front.  He also stated\r\nthat he had then contended with Johnston for the \"offensive-\r\ndefensive\" game, instead of the \"pure defensive,\" as proposed by\r\nGeneral Johnston; and he said that it was at this time that General\r\nJohnston had taken offense, and that it was for this reason he had\r\nordered the retreat that night.  As subsequent events estranged\r\nthese two officers, it is very natural they should now differ on\r\nthis point; but it was sufficient for us that the rebel army did\r\nretreat that night, leaving us masters of all the country above the\r\nEtowah River.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of rest, to give time for the repair of the\r\nrailroads, and to replenish supplies, we lay by some few days in\r\nthat quarter--Schofield with Stoneman's cavalry holding the ground\r\nat Cassville Depot, Cartersville, and the Etowah Bridge; Thomas\r\nholding his ground near Cassville, and McPherson that near\r\nKingston.  The officer intrusted with the repair of the railroads\r\nwas Colonel W. W. Wright, a railroad-engineer, who, with about two\r\nthousand men, was so industrious and skillful that the bridge at\r\nResaca was rebuilt in three days, and cars loaded with stores came\r\nforward to Kingston on the 24th.  The telegraph also brought us the\r\nnews of the bloody and desperate battles of the Wilderness, in\r\nVirginia, and that General Grant was pushing his operations against\r\nLee with terrific energy.  I was therefore resolved to give my\r\nenemy no rest.\r\n\r\nIn early days (1844), when a lieutenant of the Third Artillery, I\r\nhad been sent from Charleston, South Carolina, to Marietta,\r\nGeorgia, to assist Inspector-General Churchill to take testimony\r\nconcerning certain losses of horses and accoutrements by the\r\nGeorgia Volunteers during the Florida War; and after completing the\r\nwork at Marietta we transferred our party over to Bellefonte,\r\nAlabama.  I had ridden the distance on horseback, and had noted\r\nwell the topography of the country, especially that about Kenesaw,\r\nAllatoona, and the Etowah River.  On that occasion I had stopped\r\nsome days with a Colonel Tumlin, to see some remarkable Indian\r\nmounds on the Etowah River, usually called the \"Hightower:\" I\r\ntherefore knew that the Allatoona Pass was very strong, would be\r\nhard to force, and resolved not even to attempt it, but to turn the\r\nposition, by moving from Kingston to Marietta via. Dallas;\r\naccordingly I made orders on the 20th to get ready for the march to\r\nbegin on the 23d.  The Army of the Cumberland was ordered to march\r\nfor Dallas, by Euharlee and Stilesboro; Davis's division, then in\r\nRome, by Van Wert; the Army of the Ohio to keep on the left of\r\nThomas, by a place called Burnt Hickory; and the Army of the\r\nTennessee to march for a position a little to the south, so as to\r\nbe on the right of the general army, when grouped about Dallas.\r\n\r\nThe movement contemplated leaving our railroad, and to depend for\r\ntwenty days on the contents of our wagons; and as the country was\r\nvery obscure, mostly in a state of nature, densely wooded, and with\r\nfew roads, our movements were necessarily slow.  We crossed the\r\nEtowah by several bridges and fords, and took as many roads as\r\npossible, keeping up communication by cross-roads, or by couriers\r\nthrough the woods.  I personally joined General Thomas, who had the\r\ncentre, and was consequently the main column, or \"column of\r\ndirection.\"  The several columns followed generally the valley of\r\nthe Euharlee, a tributary coming into the Etowah from the south,\r\nand gradually crossed over a ridge of mountains, parts of which had\r\nonce been worked over for gold, and were consequently full of paths\r\nand unused wagon-roads or tracks.  A cavalry picket of the enemy at\r\nBurnt Hickory was captured, and had on his person an order from\r\nGeneral Johnston, dated at Allatoona, which showed that he had\r\ndetected my purpose of turning his position, and it accordingly\r\nbecame necessary to use great caution, lest some of the minor\r\ncolumns should fall into ambush, but, luckily the enemy was not\r\nmuch more familiar with that part of the country than we were.  On\r\nthe other side of the Allatoona range, the Pumpkin-Vine Creek, also\r\na tributary of the Etowah, flowed north and west; Dallas, the point\r\naimed at, was a small town on the other or east side of this creek,\r\nand was the point of concentration of a great many roads that led\r\nin every direction.  Its possession would be a threat to Marietta\r\nand Atlanta, but I could not then venture to attempt either, till I\r\nhad regained the use of the railroad, at least as far down as its\r\ndebouche from the Allatoona range of mountains.  Therefore, the\r\nmovement was chiefly designed to compel Johnston to give up\r\nAllatoona.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th all the columns were moving steadily on Dallas\r\n--McPherson and Davis away off to the right, near Van Wert; Thomas on\r\nthe main road in the centre, with Hooker's Twentieth Corps ahead,\r\ntoward Dallas; and Schofield to the left rear.  For the convenience\r\nof march, Hooker had his three divisions on separate roads, all\r\nleading toward Dallas, when, in the afternoon, as he approached a\r\nbridge across Pumpkin-Vine Creek, he found it held by a cavalry\r\nforce, which was driven off, but the bridge was on fire.  This fire\r\nwas extinguished, and Hooker's leading division (Geary's) followed\r\nthe retreating cavalry on a road leading due east toward Marietta,\r\ninstead of Dallas.  This leading division, about four miles out from\r\nthe bridge, struck a heavy infantry force, which was moving down from\r\nAllatoona toward Dallas, and a sharp battle ensued.  I came up in\r\nperson soon after, and as my map showed that we were near an\r\nimportant cross-road called \"New Hope,\" from a Methodist\r\nmeeting-house there of that name, I ordered General Hooker to secure\r\nit if possible that night.  He asked for a short delay, till he could\r\nbring up his other two divisions, viz., of Butterfield and Williams,\r\nbut before these divisions had got up and were deployed, the enemy\r\nhad also gained corresponding strength.  The woods were so dense, and\r\nthe resistance so spirited, that Hooker could not carry the position,\r\nthough the battle was noisy, and prolonged far into the night.  This\r\npoint, \"New Hope,\" was the accidental intersection of the road\r\nleading from Allatoona to Dallas with that from Van Wert to Marietta,\r\nwas four miles northeast of Dallas, and from the bloody fighting\r\nthere for the next week was called by the soldiers \"Hell-Hole.\"\r\n\r\nThe night was pitch-dark, it rained hard, and the convergence of\r\nour columns toward Dallas produced much confusion.  I am sure\r\nsimilar confusion existed in the army opposed to us, for we were\r\nall mixed up.  I slept on the ground, without cover, alongside of a\r\nlog, got little sleep, resolved at daylight to renew the battle,\r\nand to make a lodgment on the Dallas and Allatoona road if\r\npossible, but the morning revealed a strong line of intrenchments\r\nfacing us, with a heavy force of infantry and guns.  The battle was\r\nrenewed, and without success.  McPherson reached Dallas that\r\nmorning, viz., the 26th, and deployed his troops to the southeast\r\nand east of the town, placing Davis's division of the Fourteenth\r\nCorps, which had joined him on the road from Rome, on his left; but\r\nthis still left a gap of at least three miles between Davis and\r\nHooker.  Meantime, also, General Schofield was closing up on\r\nThomas's left.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that Johnston in person was at New Hope with all his\r\narmy, and that it was so much nearer my \"objective;\" the railroad,\r\nthan Dallas, I concluded to draw McPherson from Dallas to Hooker's\r\nright, and gave orders accordingly; but McPherson also was\r\nconfronted with a heavy force, and, as he began to withdraw\r\naccording to his orders, on the morning of the 28th he was fiercely\r\nassailed on his right; a bloody battle ensued, in which he repulsed\r\nthe attack, inflicting heavy loss on his assailants, and it was not\r\nuntil the 1st of June that he was enabled to withdraw from Dallas,\r\nand to effect a close junction with Hooker in front of New Hope.\r\nMeantime Thomas and Schofield were completing their deployments,\r\ngradually overlapping Johnston on his right, and thus extending our\r\nleft nearer and nearer to the railroad, the nearest point of which\r\nwas Acworth, about eight miles distant.  All this time a continual\r\nbattle was in progress by strong skirmish-lines, taking advantage\r\nof every species of cover, and both parties fortifying each night\r\nby rifle-trenches, with head-logs, many of which grew to be as\r\nformidable as first-class works of defense.  Occasionally one party\r\nor the other would make a dash in the nature of a sally, but\r\nusually it sustained a repulse with great loss of life.  I visited\r\npersonally all parts of our lines nearly every day, was constantly\r\nwithin musket-range, and though the fire of musketry and cannon\r\nresounded day and night along the whole line, varying from six to\r\nten miles, I rarely saw a dozen of the enemy at any one time; and\r\nthese were always skirmishers dodging from tree to tree, or behind\r\nlogs on the ground, or who occasionally showed their heads above\r\nthe hastily-constructed but remarkably strong rifle-trenches.  On\r\nthe occasion of my visit to McPherson on the 30th of May, while\r\nstanding with a group of officers, among whom were Generals\r\nMcPherson, Logan, Barry, and Colonel Taylor, my former chief of\r\nartillery, a Minie-ball passed through Logan's coat-sleeve,\r\nscratching the skin, and struck Colonel Taylor square in the\r\nbreast; luckily he had in his pocket a famous memorandum-book, in\r\nwhich he kept a sort of diary, about which we used to joke him a\r\ngood deal; its thickness and size saved his life, breaking the\r\nforce of the ball, so that after traversing the book it only\r\npenetrated the breast to the ribs, but it knocked him down and\r\ndisabled him for the rest of the campaign.  He was a most competent\r\nand worthy officer, and now lives in poverty in Chicago, sustained\r\nin part by his own labor, and in part by a pitiful pension recently\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June General McPherson closed in upon the right, and,\r\nwithout attempting further to carry the enemy's strong position at\r\nNew Hope Church, I held our general right in close contact with it,\r\ngradually, carefully, and steadily working by the left, until our\r\nstrong infantry-lines had reached and secured possession of all the\r\nwagon-roads between New Hope, Allatoona, and Acworth, when I\r\ndispatched Generals Garrard's and Stoneman's divisions of cavalry\r\ninto Allatoona, the first around by the west end of the pass, and\r\nthe latter by the direct road.  Both reached their destination\r\nwithout opposition, and orders were at once given to repair the\r\nrailroad forward from Kingston to Allatoona, embracing the bridge\r\nacross the Etowah River.  Thus the real object of my move on Dallas\r\nwas accomplished, and on the 4th of June I was preparing to draw\r\noff from New Hope Church, and to take position on the railroad in\r\nfront of Allatoona, when, General Johnston himself having evacuated\r\nhis position, we effected the change without further battle, and\r\nmoved to the railroad, occupying it from Allatoona and Acworth\r\nforward to Big Shanty, in sight of the famous Kenesaw Mountain.\r\n\r\nThus, substantially in the month of May, we had steadily driven our\r\nantagonist from the strong positions of Dalton, Resaea, Cassville,\r\nAllatoona, and Dallas; had advanced our lines in strong, compact\r\norder from Chattanooga to Big Shanty, nearly a hundred miles of as\r\ndifficult country as was ever fought over by civilized armies; and\r\nthus stood prepared to go on, anxious to fight, and confident of\r\nsuccess as soon as the railroad communications were complete to\r\nbring forward the necessary supplies.  It is now impossible to\r\nstate accurately our loss of life and men in any one separate\r\nbattle; for the fighting was continuous, almost daily, among trees\r\nand bushes, on ground where one could rarely see a hundred yards\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate loss in the several corps for the month of May is\r\nreported-as follows in the usual monthly returns sent to the\r\nAdjutant-General's office, which are, therefore, official:\r\n\r\nCasualties during the Month of May, 1864\r\n(Major-General SHERMAN commanding).\r\n\r\n            Killed and Missing.      Wounded.       Total.\r\n                1,863                 7,436         9,299\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Joseph E.  Johnston, in his \"Narrative of his Military\r\nOperations,\" just published (March 27, 1874), gives the effective\r\nstrength of his army at and about Dalton on the 1st of May, 1864\r\n(page 302), as follows:\r\n\r\nInfantry..................... 37,652\r\nArtillery....................  2,812\r\nCavalry......................  2,392\r\n\r\n    Total ................... 42,856\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring May, and prior to reaching Cassville, he was further\r\nreenforced (page 352)\r\n\r\nPolk's corps of three divisions....... 12,000\r\nMartin's division of cavalry..........  3,500\r\nJackson's division of cavalry.........  3,900\r\n\r\nAnd at New Hope Church, May 26th\r\n\r\nBrigade of Quarles....................  2,200\r\n\r\n         Grand-total.................. 64,456\r\n\r\n\r\nHis losses during the month of May are stated by him, as taken from\r\nthe report of Surgeon Foard (page 325)\r\n\r\n\r\n            Killed       Wounded       Total\r\n             721          4,672        5,393\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures include only the killed and wounded, whereas my\r\nstatement of losses embraces the \"missing,\" which are usually\r\n\"prisoners,\" and of these we captured, during the whole campaign of\r\nfour and a half months, exactly 12,983, whose names, rank, and\r\nregiments, were officially reported to the Commissary-General of\r\nPrisoners; and assuming a due proportion for the month of May,\r\nviz., one-fourth, makes 3,245 to be added to the killed and wounded\r\ngiven above, making an aggregate loss in Johnston's army, from\r\nDalton to New Hope, inclusive, of 8,638, against ours of 9,299.\r\n\r\nTherefore General Johnston is greatly in error, in his estimates on\r\npage 357, in stating our loss, as compared with his, at six or ten\r\nto one.\r\n\r\nI always estimated my force at about double his, and could afford\r\nto lose two to one without disturbing our relative proportion; but\r\nI also reckoned that, in the natural strength of the country, in\r\nthe abundance of mountains, streams, and forests, he had a fair\r\noffset to our numerical superiority, and therefore endeavored to\r\nact with reasonable caution while moving on the vigorous\r\n\"offensive.\"\r\n\r\nWith the drawn battle of New Hope Church, and our occupation of the\r\nnatural fortress of Allatoona, terminated the month of May, and the\r\nfirst stage of the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nATLANTA CAMPAIGN--BATTLES ABOUT KENESAW MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nJUNE, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June our three armies were well in hand, in the\r\nbroken and densely-wooded country fronting the enemy intrenched at\r\nNew Hope Church, about five miles north of Dallas.  General\r\nStoneman's division of cavalry had occupied Allatoona, on the\r\nrailroad, and General Garrard's division was at the western end of\r\nthe pass, about Stilesboro.  Colonel W. W. Wright, of the\r\nEngineers, was busily employed in repairing the railroad and\r\nrebuilding the bridge across the Etowah (or Hightower) River,\r\nwhich had been destroyed by the enemy on his retreat; and the\r\narmies were engaged in a general and constant skirmish along a\r\nfront of about six miles--McPherson the right, Thomas the centre,\r\nand Schofield on the left.  By gradually covering our front with\r\nparapet, and extending to the left, we approached the railroad\r\ntoward Acworth and overlapped the enemy's right.  By the 4th of\r\nJune we had made such progress that Johnston evacuated his lines in\r\nthe night, leaving us masters of the situation, when I deliberately\r\nshifted McPherson's army to the extreme left, at and in front of\r\nAcworth, with Thomas's about two miles on his right, and\r\nSchofield's on his right all facing east. Heavy rains set in about\r\nthe 1st of June, making the roads infamous; but our marches were\r\nshort, as we needed time for the repair of the railroad, so as to\r\nbring supplies forward to Allatoona Station.  On the 6th I rode\r\nback to Allatoona, seven miles, found it all that was expected, and\r\ngave orders for its fortification and preparation as a \"secondary\r\nbase.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Blair arrived at Acworth on the 8th with his two divisions\r\nof the Seventeenth Corps--the same which had been on veteran\r\nfurlough--had come up from Cairo by way of Clifton, on the\r\nTennessee River, and had followed our general route to Allatoona,\r\nwhere he had left a garrison of about fifteen hundred men.  His\r\neffective strength, as reported, was nine thousand.  These, with\r\nnew regiments and furloughed men who had joined early in the month\r\nof May, equaled our losses from battle, sickness, and by\r\ndetachments; so that the three armies still aggregated about one\r\nhundred thousand effective men.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June the whole combined army moved forward six\r\nmiles, to \"Big Shanty,\" a station on the railroad, whence we had a\r\ngood view of the enemy's position, which embraced three prominent\r\nhills known as Kenesaw, Pine Mountain, and Lost Mountain.  On each\r\nof these hills the enemy had signal-stations and fresh lines of\r\nparapets.  Heavy masses of infantry could be distinctly seen with\r\nthe naked eye, and it was manifest that Johnston had chosen his\r\nground well, and with deliberation had prepared for battle; but his\r\nline was at least ten miles in extent--too long, in my judgment, to\r\nbe held successfully by his force, then estimated at sixty\r\nthousand.  As his position, however, gave him a perfect view over\r\nour field, we had to proceed with due caution.  McPherson had the\r\nleft, following the railroad, which curved around the north base of\r\nKenesaw; Thomas the centre, obliqued to the right, deploying below\r\nKenesaw and facing Pine Hill; and Schofield, somewhat refused, was\r\non the general right, looking south, toward Lost Mountain.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th the Etowah bridge was done; the railroad was repaired\r\nup to our very skirmish line, close to the base of Kenesaw, and a\r\nloaded train of cars came to Big Shanty.  The locomotive, detached,\r\nwas run forward to a water-tank within the range of the enemy's\r\nguns on Kenesaw, whence the enemy opened fire on the locomotive;\r\nbut the engineer was not afraid, went on to the tank, got water,\r\nand returned safely to his train, answering the guns with the\r\nscreams of his engine, heightened by the cheers and shouts of our\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe rains continued to pour, and made our developments slow and\r\ndilatory, for there were no roads, and these had to be improvised\r\nby each division for its own supply train from the depot in Big\r\nShanty to the camps.  Meantime each army was deploying carefully\r\nbefore the enemy, intrenching every camp, ready as against a sally.\r\nThe enemy's cavalry was also busy in our rear, compelling us to\r\ndetach cavalry all the way  back as far as Resaca, and to\r\nstrengthen all the infantry posts  as far as Nashville.  Besides,\r\nthere was great danger, always in my mind, that Forrest would\r\ncollect a heavy cavalry command in Mississippi, cross the Tennessee\r\nRiver, and break up our railroad below Nashville.  In anticipation\r\nof this very danger, I had sent General Sturgis to Memphis to take\r\ncommand of all the cavalry in that quarter, to go out toward\r\nPontotoc, engage Forrest and defeat him; but on the 14th of June I\r\nlearned that General Sturgis had himself been defeated on the 10th\r\nof June, and had been driven by Forrest back into Memphis in\r\nconsiderable confusion.  I expected that this would soon be\r\nfollowed by a general raid on all our roads in Tennessee.  General\r\nG. J. Smith, with the two divisions of the Sixteenth and\r\nSeventeenth Corps which had been with General Banks up Red River,\r\nhad returned from that ill-fated expedition, and had been ordered\r\nto General Canby at New Orleans, who was making a diversion about\r\nMobile; but, on hearing of General Sturgis's defeat, I ordered\r\nGeneral Smith to go out from Memphis and renew the offensive, so as\r\nto keep Forrest off our roads.  This he did finally, defeating\r\nForrest at Tupelo, on the 13th, 14th, and 15th  days of July; and\r\nhe so stirred up matters in North Mississippi that Forrest could\r\nnot leave for Tennessee.  This, for a time, left me only the task\r\nof covering the roads against such minor detachments of cavalry as\r\nJohnston could spare from his immediate army, and I proposed to\r\nkeep these too busy in their own defense to spare detachments.  By\r\nthe 14th the rain slackened, and we occupied a continuous line of\r\nten miles, intrenched, conforming to the irregular position of the\r\nenemy, when I reconnoitred, with a view to make a break in their\r\nline between Kenesaw and Pine Mountain.  When abreast of Pine\r\nMountain I noticed a rebel battery on its crest, with a continuous\r\nline of fresh rifle-trench about half-way down the hill.  Our\r\nskirmishers were at the time engaged in the woods about the base of\r\nthis hill between the lines, and I estimated the distance to the\r\nbattery on the crest at about eight hundred yards.  Near it, in\r\nplain view, stood a group of the enemy, evidently observing us with\r\nglasses.  General Howard, commanding the Fourth Corps, was near by,\r\nand I called his attention to this group, and ordered him to compel\r\nit to keep behind its cover.  He replied that his orders from\r\nGeneral Thomas were to spare artillery-ammunition.  This was right,\r\naccording to the general policy, but I explained to him that we\r\nmust keep up the morale of a bold offensive, that he must use his\r\nartillery, force the enemy to remain on the timid defensive, and\r\nordered him to cause a battery close by to fire three volleys.  I\r\ncontinued to ride down our line, and soon heard, in quick\r\nsuccession, the three volleys.  The next division in order was\r\nGeary's, and I gave him similar orders.  General Polk, in my\r\nopinion, was killed by the second volley fired from the first\r\nbattery referred to.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with General Johnston, after the war, he\r\nexplained that on that day he had ridden in person from Marietta to\r\nPine Mountain, held by Bates's division, and was accompanied by\r\nGenerals Hardee and Polk.  When on Pine Mountain, reconnoitring,\r\nquite a group of soldiers, belonging to the battery close by,\r\nclustered about him.  He noticed the preparations of our battery to\r\nfire, and cautioned these men to scatter.  They did so, and he\r\nlikewise hurried behind the parapet, from which he had an equally\r\ngood view of our position but General Polk, who was dignified and\r\ncorpulent, walked back slowly, not wishing to appear too hurried or\r\ncautious in the presence of the men, and was struck across the\r\nbreast by an unexploded shell, which killed him instantly.  This is\r\nmy memory of the conversation, and it is confirmed by Johnston\r\nhimself in his \"Narrative,\" page 337, except that he calculated the\r\ndistance of our battery at six hundred yards, and says that Polk\r\nwas killed by the third shot; I know that our guns fired by volley,\r\nand believe that he was hit by a shot of the second volley.  It has\r\nbeen asserted that I fired the gun which killed General Polk, and\r\nthat I knew it was directed against that general.  The fact is, at\r\nthat distance we could not even tell that the group were officers\r\nat all; I was on horseback, a couple of hundred yards off, before\r\nmy orders to fire were executed, had no idea that our shot had\r\ntaken effect, and continued my ride down along the line to\r\nSchofield's extreme flank, returning late in the evening to my\r\nhead-quarters at Big Shanty, where I occupied an abandoned house.\r\nIn a cotton-field back of that house was our signal-station, on the\r\nroof of an old gin-house.  The signal-officer reported that by\r\nstudying the enemy's signals he had learned the key, and that he\r\ncould read their signals.  He explained to me that he had\r\ntranslated a signal about noon, from Pine Mountain to Marietta,\r\n\"Send an ambulance for General Polk's body;\" and later in the day\r\nanother, \"Why don't you send an ambulance for General Polk?\"  From\r\nthis we inferred that General Polk had been killed, but how or\r\nwhere we knew not; and this inference was confirmed later in the\r\nsame day by the report of some prisoners who had been captured.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th we advanced our general lines, intending to attack at\r\nany weak point discovered between Kenesaw and Pine Mountain; but\r\nPine Mountain was found to be abandoned, and Johnston had\r\ncontracted his front somewhat, on a direct line, connecting Kenesaw\r\nwith Lost Mountain.  Thomas and Schofield thereby gained about two\r\nmiles of most difficult, country, and McPherson's left lapped well\r\naround the north end of Kenesaw.  We captured a good many\r\nprisoners, among them a whole infantry regiment, the Fourteenth\r\nAlabama, three hundred and twenty strong.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the general movement was continued, when Lost Mountain\r\nwas abandoned by the enemy.  Our right naturally swung round, so as\r\nto threaten the railroad below Marietta, but Johnston had still\r\nfurther contracted and strengthened his lines, covering Marietta\r\nand all the roads below.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th and 18th the rain again fell in torrents, making army\r\nmovements impossible, but we devoted the time to strengthening our\r\npositions, more especially the left and centre, with a view\r\ngradually to draw from the left to add to the right; and we had to\r\nhold our lines on the left extremely strong, to guard against a\r\nsally from Kenesaw against our depot at Big Shanty.  Garrard's\r\ndivision of cavalry was kept busy on our left, McPherson had\r\ngradually extended to his right, enabling Thomas to do the same\r\nstill farther; but the enemy's position was so very strong, and\r\neverywhere it was covered by intrenchments, that we found it as\r\ndangerous to assault as a permanent fort.  We in like manner\r\ncovered our lines of battle by similar works, and even our\r\nskirmishers learned to cover their bodies by the simplest and best\r\nforms of defensive works, such as rails or logs, piled in the form\r\nof a simple lunette, covered on the outside with earth thrown up at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe enemy and ourselves used the same form of rifle-trench, varied\r\naccording to the nature of the ground, viz.: the trees and bushes\r\nwere cut away for a hundred yards or more in front, serving as an\r\nabatis or entanglement; the parapets varied from four to six feet\r\nhigh, the dirt taken from a ditch outside and from a covered way\r\ninside, and this parapet was surmounted by a \"head-log,\" composed\r\nof the trunk of a tree from twelve to twenty inches at the butt,\r\nlying along the interior crest of the parapet and resting in\r\nnotches cut in other trunks which extended back, forming an\r\ninclined plane, in case the head-log should be knocked inward by a\r\ncannon-shot.  The men of both armies became extremely skillful in\r\nthe construction of these works, because each man realized their\r\nvalue and importance to himself, so that it required no orders for\r\ntheir construction.  As soon as a regiment or brigade gained a\r\nposition within easy distance for a sally, it would set to work\r\nwith a will, and would construct such a parapet in a single night;\r\nbut I endeavored to spare the soldiers this hard labor by\r\nauthorizing each division commander to organize out of the freedmen\r\nwho escaped to us a pioneer corps of two hundred men, who were fed\r\nout of the regular army supplies, and I promised them ten dollars a\r\nmonth, under an existing act of Congress.  These pioneer\r\ndetachments became very useful to us during the rest of the war,\r\nfor they could work at night while our men slept; they in turn were\r\nnot expected to fight, and could therefore sleep by day.  Our\r\nenemies used their slaves for a similar purpose, but usually kept\r\nthem out of the range of fire by employing them to fortify and\r\nstrengthen the position to their rear next to be occupied in their\r\ngeneral retrograde.  During this campaign hundreds if not thousands\r\nof miles of similar intrenchments were built by both armies, and,\r\nas a rule, whichever party attacked got the worst of it.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of June the rebel army again fell back on its flanks,\r\nto such an extent that for a time I supposed it had retreated to\r\nthe Chattahoochee River, fifteen miles distant; but as we pressed\r\nforward we were soon undeceived, for we found it still more\r\nconcentrated, covering Marietta and the railroad.  These successive\r\ncontractions of the enemy's line encouraged us and discouraged him,\r\nbut were doubtless justified by sound reasons.  On the 20th\r\nJohnston's position was unusually strong.  Kenesaw Mountain was his\r\nsalient; his two flanks were refused and covered by parapets and by\r\nNoonday and Nose's Creeks.  His left flank was his weak point, so\r\nlong as he acted on the \"defensive,\" whereas, had he designed to\r\ncontract the extent of his line for the purpose of getting in\r\nreserve a force with which to strike \"offensively\" from his right,\r\nhe would have done a wise act, and I was compelled to presume that\r\nsuch was his object: We were also so far from Nashville and\r\nChattanooga that we were naturally sensitive for the safety of our\r\nrailroad and depots, so that the left (McPherson) was held very\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nAbout this time came reports that a large cavalry force of the\r\nenemy had passed around our left flank, evidently to strike this\r\nvery railroad somewhere below Chattanooga.  I therefore reenforced\r\nthe cavalry stationed from Resaca to Casaville, and ordered forward\r\nfrom Huntsville, Alabama, the infantry division of General John E.\r\nSmith, to hold Kingston securely.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus engaged about Kenesaw, General Grant had his\r\nhands full with Lee, in Virginia.  General Halleck was the chief of\r\nstaff at Washington, and to him I communicated almost daily.  I\r\nfind from my letter-book that on the 21st of June I reported to him\r\ntersely and truly the condition of facts on that day: \"This is the\r\nnineteenth day of rain, and the prospect of fair weather is as far\r\noff as ever.  The roads are impassable; the fields and woods become\r\nquagmire's after a few wagons have crossed over.  Yet we are at\r\nwork all the time.  The left flank is across Noonday Creek, and the\r\nright is across Nose's Creek.  The enemy still holds Kenesaw, a\r\nconical mountain, with Marietta behind it, and has his flanks\r\nretired, to cover that town and the railroad behind.  I am all\r\nready to attack the moment the weather and roads will permit troops\r\nand artillery to move with any thing like life.\"\r\n\r\nThe weather has a wonderful effect on troops: in action and on the\r\nmarch, rain is favorable; but in the woods, where all is blind and\r\nuncertain, it seems almost impossible for an army covering ten\r\nmiles of front to act in concert during wet and stormy weather.\r\nStill I pressed operations with the utmost earnestness, aiming\r\nalways to keep our fortified lines in absolute contact with the\r\nenemy, while with the surplus force we felt forward, from one flank\r\nor the other, for his line of communication and retreat.  On the\r\n22d of June I rode the whole line, and ordered General Thomas in\r\nperson to advance his extreme right corps (Hooker's); and\r\ninstructed General Schofield, by letter, to keep his entire army,\r\nviz., the Twenty-third Corps, as a strong right flank in close\r\nsupport of Hooker's deployed line.  During this day the sun came\r\nout, with some promise of clear weather, and I had got back to my\r\nbivouac about dark, when a signal message was received, dated--\r\n\r\nKULP HOUSE, 5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nGeneral SHERMAN:\r\nWe have repulsed two heavy attacks, and feel confident, our only\r\napprehension being from our extreme right flank.  Three entire\r\ncorps are in front of us.\r\n\r\nMajor-General HOOKER.\r\n\r\nHooker's corps (the Twentieth) belonged to Thomas's army; Thomas's\r\nheadquarters were two miles nearer to Hooker than mine; and Hooker,\r\nbeing an old army officer, knew that he should have reported this\r\nfact to Thomas and not to me; I was, moreover, specially disturbed\r\nby the assertion in his report that he was uneasy about his right\r\nflank, when Schofield had been specially ordered to protect that.\r\nI first inquired of my adjutant, Dayton, if he were certain that\r\nGeneral Schofield had received his orders, and he answered that the\r\nenvelope in which he had sent them was receipted by General\r\nSchofield himself.  I knew, therefore, that General Schofield must\r\nbe near by, in close support of Hooker's right flank.  General\r\nThomas had before this occasion complained to me of General\r\nHooker's disposition to \"switch off,\" leaving wide gaps in his\r\nline, so as to be independent, and to make glory on his own\r\naccount.  I therefore resolved not to overlook this breach of\r\ndiscipline and propriety.  The rebel army was only composed of\r\nthree corps; I had that very day ridden six miles of their lines,\r\nfound them everywhere strongly occupied, and therefore Hooker could\r\nnot have encountered \"three entire corps.\"  Both McPherson and\r\nSchofield had also complained to me of this same tendency of Hooker\r\nto widen the gap between his own corps and his proper army\r\n(Thomas's), so as to come into closer contact with one or other of\r\nthe wings, asserting that he was the senior by commission to both\r\nMcPherson and Schofield, and that in the event of battle he should\r\nassume command over them, by virtue of his older commission.\r\n\r\nThey appealed to me to protect them.  I had heard during that day\r\nsome cannonading and heavy firing down toward the \"Kulp House,\"\r\nwhich was about five miles southeast of where I was, but this was\r\nnothing unusual, for at the same moment there was firing along our\r\nlines full ten miles in extent.  Early the next day (23d) I rode\r\ndown to the \"Kulp House,\" which was on a road leading from Powder\r\nSprings to Marietta, about three miles distant from the latter.  On\r\nthe way I passed through General Butterfield's division of Hooker's\r\ncorps, which I learned had not been engaged at all in the battle of\r\nthe day before; then I rode along Geary's and Williams's divisions,\r\nwhich occupied the field of battle, and the men were engaged in\r\nburying the dead.  I found General Schofield's corps on the Powder\r\nSprings road, its head of column abreast of Hooker's right,\r\ntherefore constituting \"a strong right flank,\" and I met Generale\r\nSchofield and Hooker together.  As rain was falling at the moment,\r\nwe passed into a little church standing by the road-side, and I\r\nthere showed General Schofield Hooker's signal-message of the day\r\nbefore.  He was very angry, and pretty sharp words passed between\r\nthem, Schofield saying that his head of column (Hascall's division)\r\nhad been, at the time of the battle, actually in advance of\r\nHooker's line; that the attack or sally of the enemy struck his\r\ntroops before it did Hooker's; that General Hooker knew of it at\r\nthe time; and he offered to go out and show me that the dead men of\r\nhis advance division (Hascall's) were lying farther out than any of\r\nHooker's.  General Hooker pretended not to have known this fact.  I\r\nthen asked him why he had called on me for help, until he had used\r\nall of his own troops; asserting that I had just seen Butterfield's\r\ndivision, and had learned from him that he had not been engaged the\r\nday before at all; and I asserted that the enemy's sally must have\r\nbeen made by one corps (Hood's), in place of three, and that it had\r\nfallen on Geary's and Williams's divisions, which had repulsed the\r\nattack handsomely.  As we rode away from that church General Hooker\r\nwas by my side, and I told him that such a thing must not occur\r\nagain; in other words, I reproved him more gently than the occasion\r\ndemanded, and from that time he began to sulk.  General Hooker had\r\ncome from the East with great fame as a \"fighter,\" and at\r\nChattanooga he was glorified by his \"battle above the clouds,\"\r\nwhich I fear turned his head.  He seemed jealous of all the army\r\ncommanders, because in years, former rank, and experience, he\r\nthought he was our superior.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of June I telegraphed to General Halleck this summary,\r\nwhich I cannot again better state:\r\n\r\nWe continue to press forward on the principle of an advance against\r\nfortified positions.  The whole country is one vast fort, and\r\nJohnston must have at least fifty miles of connected trenches, with\r\nabatis and finished batteries.  We gain ground daily, fighting all\r\nthe time.  On the 21st General Stanley gained a position near the\r\nsouth end of Kenesaw, from which the enemy attempted in vain to\r\ndrive him; and the same day General T. J. Wood's division took a\r\nhill, which the enemy assaulted three times at night without\r\nsuccess, leaving more than a hundred dead on the ground.  Yesterday\r\nthe extreme right (Hooker and Schofield) advanced on the Powder\r\nSprings road to within three miles of Marietta.  The enemy made a\r\nstrong effort to drive them away, but failed signally, leaving more\r\nthan two hundred dead on the field.  Our lines are now in close\r\ncontact, and the fighting is incessant, with a good deal of\r\nartillery-fire.  As fast as we gain one position the enemy has\r\nanother all ready, but I think he will soon have to let go Kenesaw,\r\nwhich is the key to the whole country.  The weather is now better,\r\nand the roads are drying up fast. Our losses are light, and,\r\nnot-withstanding the repeated breaks of the road to our rear,\r\nsupplies are ample.\r\n\r\nDuring the 24th and 25th of June General Schofield extended his\r\nright as far as prudent, so as to compel the enemy to thin out his\r\nlines correspondingly, with the intention to make two strong\r\nassaults at points where success would give us the greatest\r\nadvantage.  I had consulted Generals Thomas, McPherson, and\r\nSchofield, and we all agreed that we could not with prudence\r\nstretch out any more, and therefore there was no alternative but to\r\nattack \"fortified lines,\" a thing carefully avoided up to that\r\ntime.  I reasoned, if we could make a breach anywhere near the\r\nrebel centre, and thrust in a strong head of column, that with the\r\none moiety of our army we could hold in check the corresponding\r\nwing of the enemy, and with the other sweep in flank and overwhelm\r\nthe other half.  The 27th of June was fixed as the day for the\r\nattempt, and in order to oversee the whole, and to be in close\r\ncommunication with all parts of the army, I had a place cleared on\r\nthe top of a hill to the rear of Thomas's centre, and had the\r\ntelegraph-wires laid to it.  The points of attack were chosen, and\r\nthe troops were all prepared with as little demonstration as\r\npossible.  About 9 A.M.  Of the day appointed, the troops moved to\r\nthe assault, and all along our lines for ten miles a furious fire\r\nof artillery and musketry was kept up.  At all points the enemy met\r\nus with determined courage and in great force.  McPherson's\r\nattacking column fought up the face of the lesser Kenesaw, but\r\ncould not reach the summit.  About a mile to the right (just below\r\nthe Dallas road) Thomas's assaulting column reached the parapet,\r\nwhere Brigadier-General Barker was shot down mortally wounded, and\r\nBrigadier-General Daniel McCook (my old law-partner) was\r\ndesperately wounded, from the effects of which he afterward died.\r\nBy 11.30 the assault was in fact over, and had failed.  We had not\r\nbroken the rebel line at either point, but our assaulting columns\r\nheld their ground within a few yards of the rebel trenches, and\r\nthere covered themselves with parapet.  McPherson lost about five\r\nhundred men and several valuable officers, and Thomas lost nearly\r\ntwo thousand men.  This was the hardest fight of the campaign up to\r\nthat date, and it is well described by Johnston in his \"Narrative\"\r\n(pages 342, 343), where he admits his loss in killed and wounded\r\nas\r\n\r\n        Total ............. 808\r\n\r\nThis, no doubt, is a true and fair statement; but, as usual,\r\nJohnston overestimates our loss, putting it at six thousand,\r\nwhereas our entire loss was about twenty-five hundred, killed and\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nWhile the battle was in progress at the centre, Schofield crossed\r\nOlley's Creek on the right, and gained a position threatening\r\nJohnston's line of retreat; and, to increase the effect, I ordered\r\nStoneman's cavalry to proceed rapidly still farther to the right,\r\nto Sweetwater.  Satisfied of the bloody cost of attacking\r\nintrenched lines, I at once thought of moving the whole army to the\r\nrailroad at a point (Fulton) about ten miles below Marietta, or to\r\nthe Chattahoochee River itself, a movement similar to the one\r\nafterward so successfully practised at Atlanta.  All the orders\r\nwere issued to bring forward supplies enough to fill our wagons,\r\nintending to strip the railroad back to Allatoona, and leave that\r\nplace as our depot, to be covered as well as possible by Garrard's\r\ncavalry.  General Thomas, as usual, shook his head, deeming it\r\nrisky to leave the railroad; but something had to be done, and I\r\nhad resolved on this move, as reported in my dispatch to General\r\nHalleck on July 1st:\r\n\r\nGeneral Schofield is now south of Olley's Creek, and on the head of\r\nNickajack.  I have been hurrying down provisions and forage, and\r\ntomorrow night propose to move McPherson from the left to the\r\nextreme right, back of General Thomas.  This will bring my right\r\nwithin three miles of the Chattahoochee River, and about five miles\r\nfrom the railroad.  By this movement I think I can force Johnston\r\nto move his whole army down from Kenesaw to defend his railroad and\r\nthe Chattahoochee, when I will (by the left flank) reach the\r\nrailroad below Marietta; but in this I must cut loose from the\r\nrailroad with ten days' supplies in wagons.  Johnston may come out\r\nof his intrenchments to attack Thomas, which is exactly what I\r\nwant, for General Thomas is well intrenched on a line parallel with\r\nthe enemy south of Kenesaw.  I think that Allatoona and the line of\r\nthe Etowah are strong enough for me to venture on this move.  The\r\nmovement is substantially down the Sandtown road straight for\r\nAtlanta.\r\n\r\nMcPherson drew out of his lines during the night of July 2d,\r\nleaving Garrard's cavalry, dismounted, occupying his trenches, and\r\nmoved to the rear of the Army of the Cumberland, stretching down\r\nthe Nickajack; but Johnston detected the movement, and promptly\r\nabandoned Marietta and Kenesaw.  I expected as much, for, by the\r\nearliest dawn of the 3d of July, I was up at a large spy-glass\r\nmounted on a tripod, which Colonel Poe, United States Engineers,\r\nhad at his bivouac close by our camp.  I directed the glass on\r\nKenesaw, and saw some of our pickets crawling up the hill\r\ncautiously; soon they stood upon the very top, and I could plainly\r\nsee their movements as they ran along the crest just abandoned by\r\nthe enemy.  In a minute I roused my staff, and started them off\r\nwith orders in every direction for a pursuit by every possible\r\nroad, hoping to catch Johnston in the confusion of retreat,\r\nespecially at the crossing of the Chattahoochee River.\r\n\r\nI must close this chapter here, so as to give the actual losses\r\nduring June, which are compiled from the official returns by\r\nmonths.  These losses, from June 1st to July 3d, were all\r\nsubstantially sustained about Kenesaw and Marietta, and it was\r\nreally a continuous battle, lasting from the 10th day of June till\r\nthe 3d of July, when the rebel army fell back from Marietta toward\r\nthe Chattahoochee River.  Our losses were:\r\n\r\n                      Killed and Missing      Wounded     Total\r\nLoss in June Aggregate      1,790              5,740      7,530\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnston makes his statement of losses from the report of his\r\nsurgeon Foard, for pretty much the same period, viz., from June 4th\r\nto July 4th (page 576):\r\n                            Killed           Wounded     Total\r\n         Total............   468               3,480      3,948\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the tabular statement the \"missing\" embraces the prisoners; and,\r\ngiving two thousand as a fair proportion of prisoners captured by\r\nus for the month of June (twelve thousand nine hundred and\r\neighty-three in all the campaign), makes an aggregate loss in the\r\nrebel army of fifty-nine hundred and forty-eight, to ours of\r\nseventy-five hundred and thirty--a less proportion than in the\r\nrelative strength of our two armies, viz., as six to ten, thus\r\nmaintaining our relative superiority, which the desperate game\r\nof war justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nATLANTA CAMPAIGN--BATTLES ABOUT ATLANTA\r\n\r\nJULY, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs before explained, on the 3d of July, by moving McPherson's\r\nentire army from the extreme left, at the base of Kenesaw to the\r\nright, below Olley's Creek, and stretching it down the Nickajack\r\ntoward Turner's Ferry of the Chattahoochee, we forced Johnston to\r\nchoose between a direct assault on Thomas's intrenched position, or\r\nto permit us to make a lodgment on his railroad below Marietta, or\r\neven to cross the Chattahoochee.  Of course, he chose to let go\r\nKenesaw and Marietta, and fall back on an intrenched camp prepared\r\nby his orders in advance on the north and west bank of the\r\nChattahoochee, covering the railroad-crossing and his several\r\npontoon-bridges.  I confess I had not learned beforehand of the\r\nexistence of this strong place, in the nature of a tete-du-pont,\r\nand had counted on striking him an effectual blow in the expected\r\nconfusion of his crossing the Chattahoochee, a broad and deep river\r\nthen to his rear.  Ordering every part of the army to pursue\r\nvigorously on the morning of the 3d of July, I rode into Marietta,\r\njust quitted by the rebel rear-guard, and was terribly angry at the\r\ncautious pursuit by Garrard's cavalry, and even by the head of our\r\ninfantry columns.  But Johnston had in advance cleared and\r\nmultiplied his roads, whereas ours had to cross at right angles\r\nfrom the direction of Powder Springs toward Marrietta, producing\r\ndelay and confusion.  By night Thomas's head of column ran up\r\nagainst a strong rear-guard intrenched at Smyrna camp-ground, six\r\nmiles below Marietta, and there on the next day we celebrated our\r\nFourth of July, by a noisy but not a desperate battle, designed\r\nchiefly to hold the enemy there till Generals McPherson and\r\nSchofield could get well into position below him, near the\r\nChattahoochee crossings.\r\n\r\nIt was here that General Noyes, late Governor of Ohio, lost his\r\nleg.  I came very near being shot myself while reconnoitring in the\r\nsecond story of a house on our picket-line, which was struck\r\nseveral times by cannon-shot, and perfectly riddled with\r\nmusket-balls.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Johnston drew back all his army and trains inside\r\nthe tete-du-pont at the Chattahoochee, which proved one of the\r\nstrongest pieces of field-fortification I ever saw.  We closed up\r\nagainst it, and were promptly met by a heavy and severe fire.\r\nThomas was on the main road in immediate pursuit; next on his right\r\nwas Schofield; and McPherson on the extreme right, reaching the\r\nChattahoochee River below Turner's Ferry.  Stoneman's cavalry was\r\nstill farther to the right, along down the Chattahoochee River as\r\nfar as opposite Sandtown; and on that day I ordered Garrard's\r\ndivision of cavalry up the river eighteen miles, to secure\r\npossession of the factories at Roswell, as well as to hold an\r\nimportant bridge and ford at that place.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles out from the Chattahoochee the main road forked,\r\nthe right branch following substantially the railroad, and the left\r\none leading straight for Atlanta, via Paice's Ferry and Buckhead.\r\nWe found the latter unoccupied and unguarded, and the Fourth Corps\r\n(Howard's) reached the river at Paice's Ferry.  The right-hand road\r\nwas perfectly covered by the tete-du-pont before described, where\r\nthe resistance was very severe, and for some time deceived me, for\r\nI was pushing Thomas with orders to fiercely assault his enemy,\r\nsupposing that he was merely opposing us to gain time to get his\r\ntrains and troops across the Chattahoochee; but, on personally\r\nreconnoitring, I saw the abatis and the strong redoubts, which\r\nsatisfied me of the preparations that had been made by Johnston in\r\nanticipation of this very event.  While I was with General Jeff. C.\r\nDavis, a poor negro came out of the abatis, blanched with fright,\r\nsaid he had been hidden under a log all day, with a perfect storm\r\nof shot, shells, and musket-balls, passing over him, till a short\r\nlull had enabled him to creep out and make himself known to our\r\nskirmishers, who in turn had sent him back to where we were.  This\r\nnegro explained that he with about a thousand slaves had been at\r\nwork a month or more on these very lines, which, as he explained,\r\nextended from the river about a mile above the railroad-bridge to\r\nTurner's Ferry below,--being in extent from five to six miles.\r\n\r\nTherefore, on the 5th of July we had driven our enemy to cover in\r\nthe valley of the Chattahoochee, and we held possession of the\r\nriver above for eighteen miles, as far as Roswell, and below ten\r\nmiles to the mouth of the Sweetwater.  Moreover, we held the high\r\nground and could overlook his movements, instead of his looking\r\ndown on us, as was the case at Kenesaw.\r\n\r\nFrom a hill just back of Mining's Station I could see the houses in\r\nAtlanta, nine miles distant, and the whole intervening valley of\r\nthe Chattahoochee; could observe the preparations for our reception\r\non the other side, the camps of men and large trains of covered\r\nwagons; and supposed, as a matter of course, that Johnston had\r\npassed the river with the bulk of his army, and that he had only\r\nleft on our side a corps to cover his bridges; but in fact he had\r\nonly sent across his cavalry and trains.  Between Howard's corps at\r\nPaice's Ferry and the rest of Thomas's army pressing up against\r\nthis tete-du-pont, was a space concealed by dense woods, in\r\ncrossing which I came near riding into a detachment of the enemy's\r\ncavalry; and later in the same day Colonel Frank Sherman, of\r\nChicago, then on General Howard's staff, did actually ride straight\r\ninto the enemy's camp, supposing that our lines were continuous.\r\nHe was carried to Atlanta, and for some time the enemy supposed\r\nthey were in possession of the commander-in-chief of the opposing\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nI knew that Johnston would not remain long on the west bank of the\r\nChattahoochee, for I could easily practise on that ground to better\r\nadvantage our former tactics of intrenching a moiety in his front,\r\nand with the rest of our army cross the river and threaten either\r\nhis rear or the city of Atlanta itself, which city was of vital\r\nimportance to the existence not only of his own army, but of the\r\nConfederacy itself.  In my dispatch of July 6th to General Halleck,\r\nat Washington, I state that:\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnston (in his retreat from Kenesaw) has left two breaks in the\r\nrailroad--one above Marietta and one near Mining's Station.  The\r\nformer is already repaired, and Johnston's army has heard the sound\r\nof our locomotives.  The telegraph is finished to Mining's Station,\r\nand the field-wire has just reached my bivouac, and will be ready\r\nto convey this message as soon as it is written and translated into\r\ncipher.\r\n\r\nI propose to study the crossings of the Chattahoochee, and, when\r\nall is ready, to move quickly.  As a beginning, I will keep the\r\ntroops and wagons well back from the river, and only display to the\r\nenemy our picket-line, with a few field-batteries along at random.\r\nI have already shifted Schofield to a point in our left rear,\r\nwhence he can in a single move reach the Chattahoochee at a point\r\nabove the railroad-bridge, where there is a ford.  At present the\r\nwaters are turbid and swollen from recent rains; but if the present\r\nhot weather lasts, the water will run down very fast. We have\r\npontoons enough for four bridges, but, as our crossing will be\r\nresisted, we must manoeuvre some.  All the regular crossing-places\r\nare covered by forts, apparently of long construction; but we shall\r\ncross in due time, and, instead of attacking Atlanta direct, or any\r\nof its forts, I propose to make a circuit, destroying all its\r\nrailroads.  This is a delicate movement, and must be done with\r\ncaution.  Our army is in good condition and full of confidence; but\r\nthe weather is intensely hot, and a good many men have fallen with\r\nsunstroke.  The country is high and healthy, and the sanitary\r\ncondition of the army is good.\r\n\r\nAt this time Stoneman was very active on our extreme right,\r\npretending to be searching the river below Turner's Ferry for a\r\ncrossing, and was watched closely by the enemy's cavalry on the\r\nother side, McPherson, on the right, was equally demonstrative at\r\nand near Turner's Ferry.  Thomas faced substantially the intrenched\r\ntete-du-pont, and had his left on the Chattahoochee River, at\r\nPaice's Ferry.  Garrard's cavalry was up at Roswell, and McCook's\r\nsmall division of cavalry was intermediate, above Soap's Creek.\r\nMeantime, also, the railroad-construction party was hard at work,\r\nrepairing the railroad up to our camp at Vining's Station.\r\n\r\nOf course, I expected every possible resistance in crossing the\r\nChattahoochee River, and had made up my mind to feign on the right,\r\nbut actually to cross over by the left.  We had already secured a\r\ncrossing place at Roswell, but one nearer was advisable; General\r\nSchofield had examined the river well, found a place just below the\r\nmouth of Soap's Creek which he deemed advantageous, and was\r\ninstructed to effect an early crossing there, and to intrench a\r\ngood position on the other side, viz., the east bank.  But,\r\npreliminary thereto, I had ordered General Rousseau, at Nashville,\r\nto collect, out of the scattered detachments of cavalry in\r\nTennessee, a force of a couple of thousand men, to rendezvous at\r\nDecatur, Alabama, thence to make a rapid march for Opelika, to\r\nbreak up the railroad links between Georgia and Alabama, and then\r\nto make junction with me about Atlanta; or, if forced, to go on to\r\nPensacola, or even to swing across to some of our posts in\r\nMississippi.  General Rousseau asked leave to command this\r\nexpedition himself, to which I consented, and on the 6th of July he\r\nreported that he was all ready at Decatur, and I gave him orders to\r\nstart.  He moved promptly on the 9th, crossed the Coosa below the\r\n\"Ten Islands\" and the Tallapoosa below \"Horseshoe Bend,\" having\r\npassed through Talladega.  He struck the railroad west of Opelika,\r\ntore it up for twenty miles, then turned north and came to Marietta\r\non the 22d of July, whence he reported to me.  This expedition was\r\nin the nature of a raid, and must have disturbed the enemy\r\nsomewhat; but, as usual, the cavalry did not work hard, and their\r\ndestruction of the railroad was soon repaired.  Rousseau, when he\r\nreported to me in person before Atlanta, on the 28d of July, stated\r\nhis entire loss to have been only twelve killed and thirty wounded.\r\nHe brought in four hundred captured mules and three hundred horses,\r\nand also told me a good story.  He said he was far down in Alabama,\r\nbelow Talladega, one hot, dusty day, when the blue clothing of his\r\nmen was gray with dust; he had halted his column along a road, and\r\nhe in person, with his staff, had gone to the house of a planter,\r\nwho met him kindly on the front-porch.  He asked for water, which\r\nwas brought, and as the party sat on the porch in conversation he\r\nsaw, in a stable-yard across the road, quite a number of good\r\nmules. He remarked to the planter, \"My good sir, I fear I must take\r\nsome of your mules.\"  The planter remonstrated, saying he had\r\nalready contributed liberally to the good cause; that it was only\r\nlast week he had given to General Roddy ten mules.  Rousseau\r\nreplied, \"Well, in this war you should be at least neutral--that\r\nis, you should be as liberal to us as to Roddy\" (a rebel cavalry\r\ngeneral).  \"Well, ain't you on our side?\"  \"No,\" said Rousseau; \"I\r\nam General Rousseau, and all these men you see are Yanks.\"  \"Great\r\nGod! is it possible!  Are these Yanks!  Who ever supposed they\r\nwould come away down here in Alabama?\"   Of course, Rousseau took\r\nhis ten mules.\r\n\r\nSchofield effected his crossing at Soap's Creek very handsomely on\r\nthe 9th, capturing the small guard that was watching the crossing.\r\nBy night he was on the high ground beyond, strongly intrenched,\r\nwith two good pontoon-bridges finished, and was prepared, if\r\nnecessary, for an assault by the whole Confederate army.  The same\r\nday Garrard's cavalry also crossed over at Roswell, drove away the\r\ncavalry-pickets, and held its ground till relieved by Newton's\r\ndivision of Howard's corps, which was sent up temporarily, till it\r\nin turn was relieved by Dodge's corps (Sixteenth) of the Army of\r\nthe Tennessee, which was the advance of the whole of that army.\r\n\r\nThat night Johnston evacuated his trenches, crossed over the\r\nChattahoochee, burned the railroad bridge and his pontoon and\r\ntrestle bridges, and left us in full possession of the north or\r\nwest bank-besides which, we had already secured possession of the\r\ntwo good crossings at Roswell and Soap's Creek.  I have always\r\nthought Johnston neglected his opportunity there, for he had lain\r\ncomparatively idle while we got control of both banks of the river\r\nabove him.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th I ordered McPherson, with the Fifteenth Corps, to move\r\nup to Roswell, to cross over, prepare good bridges, and to make a\r\nstrong tete-du-pont on the farther side.  Stoneman had been sent\r\ndown to Campbellton, with orders to cross over and to threaten the\r\nrailroad below Atlanta, if he could do so without too much risk;\r\nand General Blair, with the Seventeenth Corps, was to remain at\r\nTurner's Ferry, demonstrating as much as possible, thus keeping up\r\nthe feint below while we were actually crossing above.  Thomas was\r\nalso ordered to prepare his bridges at Powers's and Paice's\r\nFerries.  By crossing the Chattahoochee above the railroad bridge,\r\nwe were better placed to  cover our railroad and depots than below,\r\nthough a movement across the river below the railroad, to the south\r\nof Atlanta, might have been more decisive.  But we were already so\r\nfar from home, and would be compelled to accept battle whenever\r\noffered, with the Chattahoochee to our rear, that it became\r\nimperative for me to take all prudential measures the case admitted\r\nof, and I therefore determined to pass the river above the\r\nrailroad-bridge-McPherson on the left, Schofield in the  centre,\r\nand Thomas on the right. On the 13th I reported to General Halleck\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll is well.  I have now accumulated stores at Allatoona and\r\nMarietta, both fortified and garrisoned points.  Have also three\r\nplaces at which to cross the Chattahoochee in our possession, and\r\nonly await General Stoneman's return from a trip down the river, to\r\ncross the army in force and move on Atlanta.\r\n\r\nStoneman is now out two days, and had orders to be back on the\r\nfourth or fifth day at furthest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the 10th to the 15th we were all busy in strengthening the\r\nseveral points for the proposed passage of the Chattahoochee, in\r\nincreasing the number and capacity of the bridges, rearranging the\r\ngarrisons to our rear, and in bringing forward supplies.  On the\r\n15th General Stoneman got back to Powder Springs, and was ordered\r\nto replace General Blair at Turner's Ferry, and Blair, with the\r\nSeventeenth Corps, was ordered up to Roswell to join McPherson.  On\r\nthe 17th we began the general movement against Atlanta, Thomas\r\ncrossing the Chattahoochee at Powers's and Paice's, by pontoon-\r\nbridges; Schofield moving out toward Cross Keys, and McPherson\r\ntoward Stone Mountain.  We encountered but little opposition except\r\nby cavalry.  On the 18th all the armies moved on a general right\r\nwheel, Thomas to Buckhead, forming line of  battle facing\r\nPeach-Tree Creek; Schofield was on his left, and McPherson well\r\nover toward the railroad between Stone Mountain and Decatur, which\r\nhe reached at 2 p.m.  of that day, about four miles from Stone\r\nMountain, and seven miles east of Decatur, and there he turned\r\ntoward Atlanta, breaking up the railroad as he progressed, his\r\nadvance-guard reaching Ecatur about night, where he came into\r\ncommunication with Schofield's troops, which had also reached\r\nDecatur.  About 10 A.M. of that day (July 18th), when the armies\r\nwere all in motion, one of General Thomas's staff-officers brought\r\nme a citizen, one of our spies, who had just come out of Atlanta,\r\nand had brought a newspaper of the same day, or of the day before,\r\ncontaining Johnston's order relinquishing the command of the\r\nConfederate forces in Atlanta, and Hood's order assuming the\r\ncommand.  I immediately inquired of General Schofield, who was his\r\nclassmate at West Point, about Hood, as to his general character,\r\netc., and learned that he was bold even to rashness, and courageous\r\nin the extreme; I inferred that the change of commanders meant\r\n\"fight.\"  Notice of this important change was at once sent to all\r\nparts of the army, and every division commander was cautioned to be\r\nalways prepared for battle in any shape.  This was just what we\r\nwanted, viz., to fight in open ground, on any thing like equal\r\nterms, instead of being forced to run up against prepared\r\nintrenchments; but, at the same time, the enemy having Atlanta\r\nbehind him, could choose the time and place of attack, and could at\r\npleasure mass a superior force on our weakest points.  Therefore,\r\nwe had to be constantly ready for sallies.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th the three armies were converging toward Atlanta,\r\nmeeting such feeble resistance that I really thought the enemy\r\nintended to evacuate the place.  McPherson was moving astride of\r\nthe railroad, near Decatur; Schofield along a road leading toward\r\nAtlanta, by Colonel Howard's house and the distillery; and Thomas\r\nwas crossing \"Peach-Tree\" in line of battle, building bridges for\r\nnearly every division as deployed.  There was quite a gap between\r\nThomas and Schofield, which I endeavored to close by drawing two of\r\nHoward's divisions nearer Schofield.  On the 20th I was with\r\nGeneral Schofield near the centre, and soon after noon heard heavy\r\nfiring in front of Thomas's right, which lasted an hour or so, and\r\nthen ceased.\r\n\r\nI soon learned that the enemy had made a furious sally, the blow\r\nfalling on Hooker's corps (the Twentieth), and partially on\r\nJohnson's division of the Fourteenth, and Newton's of the Fourth.\r\nThe troops had crossed Peach-Tree Creek, were deployed, but at the\r\ntime were resting for noon, when, without notice, the enemy came\r\npouring out of their trenches down upon them, they became\r\ncommingled, and fought in many places hand to hand.  General Thomas\r\nhappened to be near the rear of Newton's division, and got some\r\nfield-batteries in a good position, on the north side of Peach-Tree\r\nCreek, from which he directed a furious fire on a mass of the\r\nenemy, which was passing around Newton's left and exposed flank.\r\nAfter a couple of hours of hard and close conflict, the enemy\r\nretired slowly within his trenches, leaving his dead and many\r\nwounded on the field. Johnson's and Newton's losses were light, for\r\nthey had partially covered their fronts with light parapet; but\r\nHooker's whole corps fought in open ground, and lost about fifteen\r\nhundred men.  He reported four hundred rebel dead left on the\r\nground, and that the rebel wounded would number four thousand; but\r\nthis was conjectural, for most of them got back within their own\r\nlines.  We had, however, met successfully a bold sally, had\r\nrepelled it handsomely, and were also put on our guard; and the\r\nevent illustrated the future tactics of our enemy.  This sally came\r\nfrom the Peach-Tree line, which General Johnston had carefully\r\nprepared in advance, from which to fight us outside of Atlanta.  We\r\nthen advanced our lines in compact order, close up to these\r\nfinished intrenchments, overlapping them on our left. From various\r\nparts of our lines the houses inside of Atlanta were plainly\r\nvisible, though between us were the strong parapets, with ditch,\r\nfraise, chevaux-de-frise, and abatis, prepared long in advance by\r\nColonel Jeremy F. Gilmer, formerly of the United States Engineers.\r\nMcPherson had the Fifteenth Corps astride the Augusta Railroad, and\r\nthe Seventeenth deployed on its left.  Schofield was next on his\r\nright, then came Howard's, Hooker's, and Palmer's corps, on the\r\nextreme right.  Each corps was deployed with strong reserves, and\r\ntheir trains were parked to their rear.  McPherson's trains were in\r\nDecatur, guarded by a brigade commanded by Colonel Sprague of the\r\nSixty-third Ohio.  The Sixteenth Corps (Dodge's) was crowded out of\r\nposition on the right of McPherson's line, by the contraction of\r\nthe circle of investment; and, during the previous afternoon, the\r\nSeventeenth Corps (Blair's) had pushed its operations on the\r\nfarther side of the Augusta Railroad, so as to secure possession of\r\na hill, known as Leggett's Hill, which Leggett's and Force's\r\ndivisions had carried by assault.  Giles A. Smith's division was on\r\nLeggett's left, deployed with a weak left flank \"in air,\" in\r\nmilitary phraseology.  The evening before General Gresham, a great\r\nfavorite, was badly wounded; and there also Colonel Tom Reynolds,\r\nnow of Madison, Wisconsin, was shot through the leg.  When the\r\nsurgeons were debating the propriety of amputating it in his\r\nhearing, he begged them to spare the leg, as it was very valuable,\r\nbeing an \"imported leg.\"  He was of Irish birth, and this\r\nwell-timed piece of wit saved his leg, for the surgeons thought, if\r\nhe could perpetrate a joke at such a time, they would trust to his\r\nvitality to save his limb.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, I had full reports from all parts of our line,\r\nmost of which was partially intrenched as against a sally, and\r\nfinding that McPherson was stretching out too much on his left\r\nflank, I wrote him a note early in the morning not to extend so\r\nmuch by his left; for we had not troops enough to completely invest\r\nthe place, and I intended to destroy utterly all parts of the\r\nAugusta Railroad to the east of Atlanta, then to withdraw from the\r\nleft flank and add to the right.  In that letter I ordered\r\nMcPherson not to extend any farther to the left, but to employ\r\nGeneral Dodge's corps (Sixteenth), then forced out of position, to\r\ndestroy every rail and tie of the railroad, from Decatur up to his\r\nskirmish-line, and I wanted him (McPherson) to be ready, as soon as\r\nGeneral Garrard returned from Covington (whither I had sent him),\r\nto move to the extreme right of Thomas, so as to reach if possible\r\nthe railroad below Atlanta, viz., the Macon road.  In the morning\r\nwe found the strong line of parapet, \"Peach-Tree line,\" to the\r\nfront of Schofield and Thomas, abandoned, and our lines were\r\nadvanced rapidly close up to Atlanta.  For some moments I supposed\r\nthe enemy intended to evacuate, and in person was on horseback at\r\nthe head of Schofield's troops, who had advanced in front of the\r\nHoward House to some open ground, from which we could plainly see\r\nthe whole rebel line of parapets, and I saw their men dragging up\r\nfrom the intervening valley, by the distillery, trees and saplings\r\nfor abatis.  Our skirmishers found the enemy down in this valley,\r\nand we could see the rebel main line strongly manned, with guns in\r\nposition at intervals.  Schofield was dressing forward his lines,\r\nand I could hear Thomas farther to the right engaged, when General\r\nMcPherson and his staff rode up.  We went back to the Howard House,\r\na double frame-building with a porch, and sat on the steps,\r\ndiscussing the chances of battle, and of Hood's general character.\r\nMcPherson had also been of the same class at West Point with Hood,\r\nSchofield, and Sheridan.  We agreed that we ought to be unusually\r\ncautious and prepared at all times for sallies and for hard\r\nfighting, because Hood, though not deemed much of a scholar, or of\r\ngreat mental capacity, was undoubtedly a brave, determined, and\r\nrash man; and the change of commanders at that particular crisis\r\nargued the displeasure of the Confederate Government with the\r\ncautious but prudent conduct of General Jos. Johnston.\r\n\r\nMcPherson was in excellent spirits, well pleased at the progress of\r\nevents so far, and had come over purposely to see me about the\r\norder I had given him to use Dodge's corps to break up the\r\nrailroad, saying that the night before he had gained a position on\r\nLeggett's Hill from which he could look over the rebel parapet, and\r\nsee the high smoke-stack of a large foundery in Atlanta; that\r\nbefore receiving my order he had diverted Dodge's two divisions\r\n(then in motion) from the main road, along a diagonal one that led\r\nto his extreme left flank, then held by Giles A. Smith's division\r\n(Seventeenth Corps), for the purpose of strengthening that flank;\r\nand that he had sent some intrenching-tools there, to erect some\r\nbatteries from which he intended to knock down that foundery, and\r\notherwise to damage the buildings inside of Atlanta.  He said he\r\ncould put all his pioneers to work, and do with them in the time\r\nindicated all I had proposed to do with General Dodge's two\r\ndivisions.  Of course I assented at once, and we walked down the\r\nroad a short distance, sat down by the foot of a tree where I had\r\nmy map, and on it pointed out to him Thomas's position and his own.\r\nI then explained minutely that, after we had sufficiently broken up\r\nthe Augusta road, I wanted to shift his whole army around by the\r\nrear to Thomas's extreme right, and hoped thus to reach the other\r\nrailroad at East Point.  While we sat there we could hear lively\r\nskirmishing going on near us (down about the distillery), and\r\noccasionally round-shot from twelve or twenty-four pound guns came\r\nthrough the trees in reply to those of Schofield, and we could hear\r\nsimilar sounds all along down the lines of Thomas to our right, and\r\nhis own to the left; but presently the firing appeared a little\r\nmore brisk (especially over about Giles G. Smith's division), and\r\nthen we heard an occasional gun back toward Decatur.  I asked him\r\nwhat it meant.  We took my pocket-compass (which I always carried),\r\nand by noting the direction of the sound, we became satisfied that\r\nthe firing was too far to our left rear to be explained by known\r\nfacts, and he hastily called for his horse, his staff, and his\r\norderlies.\r\n\r\nMcPherson was then in his prime (about thirty-four years old), over\r\nsix feet high, and a very handsome man in every way, was\r\nuniversally liked, and had many noble qualities.  He had on his\r\nboots outside his pantaloons, gauntlets on his hands, had on his\r\nmajor-general's uniform, and wore a sword-belt, but no sword.  He\r\nhastily gathered his papers (save one, which I now possess) into a\r\npocket-book, put it in his breast-pocket, and jumped on his horse,\r\nsaying he would hurry down his line and send me back word what\r\nthese sounds meant.  His adjutant-general, Clark, Inspector-General\r\nStrong, and his aides, Captains Steele and Gile, were with him.\r\nAlthough the sound of musketry on our left grew in volume, I was\r\nnot so much disturbed by it as by the sound of artillery back\r\ntoward Decatur.  I ordered Schofield at once to send a brigade back\r\nto Decatur (some five miles) and was walking up and down the porch\r\nof the Howard House, listening, when one of McPherson's staff, with\r\nhis horse covered with sweat, dashed up to the porch, and reported\r\nthat General McPherson was either \"killed or a prisoner.\"  He\r\nexplained that when they had left me a few minutes before, they had\r\nridden rapidly across to the railroad, the sounds of battle\r\nincreasing as they neared the position occupied by General Giles A.\r\nSmith's division, and that McPherson had sent first one, then\r\nanother of his staff to bring some of the reserve brigades of the\r\nFifteenth Corps over to the exposed left flank; that he had reached\r\nthe head of Dodge's corps (marching by the flank on the diagonal\r\nroad as described), and had ordered it to hurry forward to the same\r\npoint; that then, almost if not entirely alone, he had followed\r\nthis road leading across the wooded valley behind the Seventeenth\r\nCorps, and had disappeared in these woods, doubtless with a sense\r\nof absolute security.  The sound of musketry was there heard, and\r\nMcPherson's horse came back, bleeding, wounded, and riderless.  I\r\nordered the staff-officer who brought this message to return at\r\nonce, to find General Logan (the senior officer present with the\r\nArmy of the Tennessee), to report the same facts to him, and to\r\ninstruct him to drive back this supposed small force, which had\r\nevidently got around the Seventeenth Corps through the blind woods\r\nin rear of our left flank.  I soon dispatched one of my own staff\r\n(McCoy, I think) to General Logan with similar orders, telling him\r\nto refuse his left flank, and to fight the battle (holding fast to\r\nLeggett's Hill) with the Army of the Tennessee; that I would\r\npersonally look to Decatur and to the safety of his rear, and would\r\nreenforce him if he needed it.  I dispatched orders to General\r\nThomas on our right, telling him of this strong sally, and my\r\ninference that the lines in his front had evidently been weakened\r\nby reason thereof, and that he ought to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity to make a lodgment in Atlanta, if possible.\r\n\r\nMeantime the sounds of the battle rose on our extreme left more and\r\nmore furious, extending to the place where I stood, at the Howard\r\nHouse.  Within an hour an ambulance came in (attended by Colonels\r\nClark and Strong, and Captains Steele and Gile), bearing\r\nMcPherson's body.  I had it carried inside of the Howard House, and\r\nlaid on a door wrenched from its hinges.  Dr. Hewitt, of the army,\r\nwas there, and I asked him to examine the wound.  He opened the\r\ncoat and shirt, saw where the ball had entered and where it came\r\nout, or rather lodged under the skin, and he reported that\r\nMcPherson must have died in a few seconds after being hit; that the\r\nball had ranged upward across his body, and passed near the heart.\r\nHe was dressed just as he left me, with gauntlets and boots on, but\r\nhis pocket-book was gone.  On further inquiry I learned that his\r\nbody must have been in possession of the enemy some minutes, during\r\nwhich time it was rifled of the pocket-book, and I was much\r\nconcerned lest the letter I had written him that morning should\r\nhave fallen into the hands of some one who could read and\r\nunderstand its meaning.  Fortunately the spot in the woods where\r\nMcPherson was shot was regained by our troops in a few minutes, and\r\nthe pocket-book found in the haversack of a prisoner of war\r\ncaptured at the time, and it and its contents were secured by one\r\nof McPherson's staff.\r\n\r\nWhile we were examining the body inside the house, the battle was\r\nprogressing outside, and many shots struck the building, which I\r\nfeared would take fire; so I ordered Captains Steele and Gile to\r\ncarry the body to Marietta.  They reached that place the same\r\nnight, and, on application, I ordered his personal staff to go on\r\nand escort the body to his home, in Clyde, Ohio, where it was\r\nreceived with great honor, and it is now buried in a small\r\ncemetery, close by his mother's house, which cemetery is composed\r\nin part of the family orchard, in which he used to play when a boy.\r\nThe foundation is ready laid for the equestrian monument now in\r\nprogress, under the auspices of the Society of the Army of the\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nThe reports that came to me from all parts of the field revealed\r\nclearly what was the game of my antagonist, and the ground somewhat\r\nfavored him.  The railroad and wagon-road from Decatur to Atlanta\r\nlie along the summit, from which the waters flow, by short, steep\r\nvalleys, into the \"Peach-Tree\" and Chattahoochee, to the west, and\r\nby other valleys, of gentler declivity, toward the east (Ocmulgee).\r\nThe ridges and level ground were mostly cleared, and had been\r\ncultivated as corn or cotton fields; but where the valleys were\r\nbroken, they were left in a state of nature--wooded, and full of\r\nundergrowth.  McPherson's line of battle was across this railroad,\r\nalong a general ridge, with a gentle but cleared valley to his\r\nfront, between him and the defenses of Atlanta; and another valley,\r\nbehind him, was clear of timber in part, but to his left rear the\r\ncountry was heavily wooded.  Hood, during the night of July 21st,\r\nhad withdrawn from his Peach-Tree line, had occupied the fortified\r\nline of Atlanta, facing north and east, with Stewart's--formerly\r\nPolk's--corps and part of Hardee's, and with G. W. Smith's division\r\nof militia.  His own corps, and part of Hardee's, had marched out\r\nto the road leading from McDonough to Decatur, and had turned so as\r\nto strike the left and, rear of McPherson's line \"in air.\"  At the\r\nsame time he had sent Wheeler's division of cavalry against the\r\ntrains parked in Decatur.  Unluckily for us, I had sent away the\r\nwhole of Garrard's division of cavalry during the night of the\r\n20th, with orders to proceed to Covington, thirty miles east, to\r\nburn two important bridges across the Ulcofauhatchee and Yellow\r\nRivers, to tear up the railroad, to damage it as much as possible\r\nfrom Stone Mountain eastward, and to be gone four days; so that\r\nMcPherson had no cavalry in hand to guard that flank.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was therefore enabled, under cover or the forest, to\r\napproach quite near before he was discovered; indeed, his\r\nskirmish-line had worked through the timber and got into the field to\r\nthe rear of Giles A. Smith's division of the Seventeenth Corps\r\nunseen, had captured Murray's battery of regular artillery, moving\r\nthrough these woods entirely unguarded, and had got possession of\r\nseveral of the hospital camps.  The right of this rebel line struck\r\nDodge's troops in motion; but, fortunately, this corps (Sixteenth)\r\nhad only to halt, face to the left, and was in line of battle; and\r\nthis corps not only held in check the enemy, but drove him back\r\nthrough the woods.  About the same time this same force had struck\r\nGeneral Giles A. Smith's left flank, doubled it back, captured four\r\nguns in position and the party engaged in building the very battery\r\nwhich was the special object of McPherson's visit to me, and almost\r\nenveloped the entire left flank.  The men, however, were skillful and\r\nbrave, and fought for a time with their backs to Atlanta.  They\r\ngradually fell back, compressing their own line, and gaining strength\r\nby making junction with Leggett's division of the Seventeenth Corps,\r\nwell and strongly posted on the hill.  One or two brigades of the\r\nFifteenth Corps, ordered by McPherson, came rapidly across the open\r\nfield to the rear, from the direction of the railroad, filled up the\r\ngap from Blair's new left to the head of Dodge's column--now facing\r\nto the general left--thus forming a strong left flank, at right\r\nangles to the original line of battle. The enemy attacked, boldly and\r\nrepeatedly, the whole of this flank, but met an equally fierce\r\nresistance; and on that ground a bloody battle raged from little\r\nafter noon till into the night.  A part of Hood's plan of action was\r\nto sally from Atlanta at the same moment; but this sally was not, for\r\nsome reason, simultaneous, for the first attack on our extreme left\r\nflank had been checked and repulsed before the sally came from the\r\ndirection of Atlanta. Meantime, Colonel Sprague, in Decatur, had got\r\nhis teams harnessed up, and safely conducted his train to the rear of\r\nSchofield's position, holding in check Wheeler's cavalry till he had\r\ngot off all his trains, with the exception of three or four wagons.\r\nI remained near the Howard House, receiving reports and sending\r\norders, urging Generals Thomas and Schofield to take advantage of the\r\nabsence from their front of so considerable a body as was evidently\r\nengaged on our left, and, if possible, to make a lodgment in Atlanta\r\nitself; but they reported that the lines to their front, at all\r\naccessible points, were strong, by nature and by art, and were fully\r\nmanned.  About 4 p.m. the expected, sally came from Atlanta, directed\r\nmainly against Leggett's Hill and along the Decatur road.  At\r\nLeggett's Hill they were met and bloodily repulsed.  Along the\r\nrailroad they were more successful.  Sweeping over a small force with\r\ntwo guns, they reached our main line, broke through it, and got\r\npossession of De Gress's battery of four twenty-pound Parrotts,\r\nkilling every horse, and turning the guns against us.  General\r\nCharles R. Wood's division of the Fifteenth Corps was on the extreme\r\nright of the Army of the Tennessee, between the railroad and the\r\nHoward House, where he connected with Schofield's troops.  He\r\nreported to me in person that the line on his left had been swept\r\nback, and that his connection with General Logan, on Leggett's Hill,\r\nwas broken.  I ordered him to wheel his brigades to the left, to\r\nadvance in echelon, and to catch the enemy in flank.  General\r\nSchofield brought forward all his available batteries, to the number\r\nof twenty guns, to a position to the left front of the Howard House,\r\nwhence we could overlook the field of action, and directed a heavy\r\nfire over the heads of General Wood's men against the enemy; and we\r\nsaw Wood's troops advance and encounter the enemy, who had secured\r\npossession of the old line of parapet which had been held by our men.\r\nHis right crossed this parapet, which he swept back, taking it in\r\nflank; and, at the same time, the division which had been driven back\r\nalong the railroad was rallied by General Logan in person, and fought\r\nfor their former ground.  These combined forces drove the enemy into\r\nAtlanta, recovering the twenty pound Parrott guns but one of them was\r\nfound \"bursted\" while in the possession of the enemy.  The two\r\nsix-pounders farther in advance were, however, lost, and had been\r\nhauled back by the enemy into Atlanta.  Poor Captain de Gress came to\r\nme in tears, lamenting the loss of his favorite guns; when they were\r\nregained he had only a few men left, and not a single horse. He asked\r\nan order for a reequipment, but I told him he must beg and borrow of\r\nothers till he could restore his battery, now reduced to three guns.\r\nHow he did so I do not know, but in a short time he did get horses,\r\nmen, and finally another gun, of the same special pattern, and served\r\nthem with splendid effect till the very close of the war.  This\r\nbattery had also been with me from Shiloh till that time.\r\n\r\nThe battle of July 22d is usually called the battle of Atlanta.  It\r\nextended from the Howard House to General Giles A. Smith's\r\nposition, about a mile beyond the Augusta Railroad, and then back\r\ntoward Decatur, the whole extent of ground being fully seven miles.\r\nIn part the ground was clear and in part densely wooded.  I rode\r\nover the whole of it the next day, and it bore the marks of a\r\nbloody conflict.  The enemy had retired during the night inside of\r\nAtlanta, and we remained masters of the situation outside.  I\r\npurposely allowed the Army of the Tennessee to fight this battle\r\nalmost unaided, save by demonstrations on the part of General\r\nSchofield and Thomas against the fortified lines to their immediate\r\nfronts, and by detaching, as described, one of Schofield's brigades\r\nto Decatur, because I knew that the attacking force could only be a\r\npart of Hood's army, and that, if any assistance were rendered by\r\neither of the other armies, the Army of the Tennessee would be\r\njealous.  Nobly did they do their work that day, and terrible was\r\nthe slaughter done to our enemy, though at sad cost to ourselves,\r\nas shown by the following reports:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD NEAR ATLANTA, July 23,1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral HALLECK, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning the enemy fell back to the intrenchments proper\r\nof the city of Atlanta, which are in a general circle, with a\r\nradius of one and a half miles, and we closed in.  While we were\r\nforming our lines, and selecting positions for our batteries, the\r\nenemy appeared suddenly out of the dense woods in heavy masses on\r\nour extreme left, and struck the Seventeenth Corps (General Blair)\r\nin flank, and was forcing it back, when the Sixteenth Corps\r\n(General Dodge) came up and checked the movement, but the enemy's\r\ncavalry got well to our rear, and into Decatur, and for some hours\r\nour left flank was completely enveloped.  The fight that resulted\r\nwas continuous until night, with heavy loss on both sides.  The\r\nenemy took one of our batteries (Murray's, of the Regular Army)\r\nthat was marching in its place in column in the road, unconscious\r\nof danger.  About 4 p.m. the enemy sallied against the division of\r\nGeneral Morgan L. Smith, of the Fifteenth Corps, which occupied an\r\nabandoned line of rifle-trench near the railroad east of the city,\r\nand forced it back some four hundred yards, leaving in his hands\r\nfor the time two batteries, but the ground and batteries were\r\nimmediately after recovered by the same troops reenforced.  I\r\ncannot well approximate our loss, which fell heavily on the\r\nFifteenth and Seventeenth Corps, but count it as three thousand; I\r\nknow that, being on the defensive, we have inflicted equally heavy\r\nloss on the enemy.\r\n\r\nGeneral McPherson, when arranging his troops about 11.00 A.M., and\r\npassing from one column to another, incautiously rode upon an\r\nambuscade without apprehension, at some distance ahead of his staff\r\nand orderlies, and was shot dead.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD NEAR ATLANTA, July 26,1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General HALLECK, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I find it difficult to make prompt report of results,\r\ncoupled with some data or information, without occasionally making\r\nmistakes.  McPherson's sudden death, and Logan succeeding to the\r\ncommand as it were in the midst of battle, made some confusion on\r\nour extreme left; but it soon recovered and made sad havoc with the\r\nenemy, who had practised one of his favorite games of attacking our\r\nleft when in motion, and before it had time to cover its weak\r\nflank.  After riding over the ground and hearing the varying\r\nstatements of the actors, I directed General Logan to make an\r\nofficial report of the actual result, and I herewith inclose it.\r\n\r\nThough the number of dead rebels seems excessive, I am disposed to\r\ngive full credit to the report that our loss, though only\r\nthirty-five hundred and twenty-one killed, wounded, and missing, the\r\nenemy's dead alone on the field nearly equaled that number, viz.,\r\nthirty-two hundred and twenty.  Happening at that point of the line\r\nwhen a flag of truce was sent in to ask permission for each party to\r\nbury its dead, I gave General Logan authority to permit a temporary\r\ntruce on that flank alone, while our labors and fighting proceeded at\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nI also send you a copy of General Garrard's report of the breaking\r\nof the railroad toward Augusta.  I am now grouping my command to\r\nattack the Macon road, and with that view will intrench a strong\r\nline of circumvallation with flanks, so as to have as large an\r\ninfantry column as possible, with all the cavalry to swing round to\r\nthe south and east, to strike that road at or below East Point.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nBEFORE ATLANTA GEORGIA, July 24, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have the honor to report the following general summary\r\nof the result of the attack of the enemy on this army on the 22d\r\ninst.\r\n\r\nTotal loss, killed, wounded, and missing, thirty-five hundred and\r\ntwenty-one, and ten pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nWe have buried and delivered to the enemy, under a flag of truce\r\nsent in by them, in front of the Third Division, Seventeenth Corps,\r\none thousand of their killed.\r\n\r\nThe number of their dead in front of the Fourth Division of the\r\nsame corps, including those on the ground not now occupied by our\r\ntroops, General Blair reports, will swell the number of their dead\r\non his front to two thousand.\r\n\r\nThe number of their dead buried in front of the Fifteenth Corps, up\r\nto this hour, is three hundred and sixty, and the commanding\r\nofficer reports that at least as many more are yet unburied;\r\nburying-parties being still at work.\r\n\r\nThe number of dead buried in front of the Sixteenth Corps is four\r\nhundred and twenty-two.  We have over one thousand of their wounded\r\nin our hands, the larger number of the wounded being carried off\r\nduring the night, after the engagement, by them.\r\n\r\nWe captured eighteen stands of colors, and have them now.  We also\r\ncaptured five thousand stands of arms.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made on our lines seven times, and was seven times\r\nrepulsed.  Hood's and Hardee's corps and Wheeler's cavalry engaged\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe have sent to the rear one thousand prisoners, including\r\nthirty-three commissioned officers of high rank.\r\n\r\nWe still occupy the field, and the troops are in fine spirits.  A\r\ndetailed and full report will be furnished as soon as completed.\r\n\r\nRecapitulation.\r\n\r\nOur total loss............................ 3,521\r\nEnemy's dead, thus far reported, buried,\r\nand delivered to them..................... 3,220\r\nTotal prisoners sent North................ 1,017\r\nTotal prisoners, wounded, in our hands.... 1,000\r\nEstimated loss of the enemy, at least.... 10,000\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\nJoan A.  Logan, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of July General Rousseau reached Marietta, having\r\nreturned from his raid on the Alabama road at Opelika, and on the\r\nnext day General Garrard also returned from Covington, both having\r\nbeen measurably successful.  The former was about twenty-five\r\nhundred strong, the latter about four thousand, and both reported\r\nthat their horses were jaded and tired, needing shoes and rest.\r\nBut, about this time, I was advised by General Grant (then\r\ninvesting Richmond) that the rebel Government had become aroused to\r\nthe critical condition of things about Atlanta, and that I must\r\nlook out for Hood being greatly reenforced.  I therefore was\r\nresolved to push matters, and at once set about the original\r\npurpose of transferring the whole of the Army of the Tennessee to\r\nour right flank, leaving Schofield to stretch out so as to rest his\r\nleft on the Augusta road, then torn up for thirty miles eastward;\r\nand, as auxiliary thereto, I ordered all the cavalry to be ready to\r\npass around Atlanta on both flanks, to break up the Macon road at\r\nsome point below, so as to cut off all supplies to the rebel army\r\ninside, and thus to force it to evacuate, or come out and fight us\r\non equal terms.\r\n\r\nBut it first became necessary to settle the important question of\r\nwho should succeed General McPherson?  General Logan had taken\r\ncommand of the Army of the Tennessee by virtue of his seniority,\r\nand had done well; but I did not consider him equal to the command\r\nof three corps.  Between him and General Blair there existed a\r\nnatural rivalry.  Both were men of great courage and talent, but\r\nwere politicians by nature and experience, and it may be that for\r\nthis reason they were mistrusted by regular officers like Generals\r\nSchofield, Thomas, and myself.  It was all-important that there\r\nshould exist a perfect understanding among the army commanders, and\r\nat a conference with General George H. Thomas at the headquarters\r\nof General Thomas J. Woods, commanding a division in the Fourth\r\nCorps, he (Thomas) remonstrated warmly against my recommending that\r\nGeneral Logan should be regularly assigned to the command of the\r\nArmy of the Tennessee by reason of his accidental seniority.  We\r\ndiscussed fully the merits and qualities of every officer of high\r\nrank in the army, and finally settled on Major-General O. O. Howard\r\nas the best officer who was present and available for the purpose;\r\non the 24th of July I telegraphed to General Halleck this\r\npreference, and it was promptly ratified by the President.  General\r\nHoward's place in command of the Fourth Corps was filled by General\r\nStanley, one of his division commanders, on the recommendation of\r\nGeneral Thomas.  All these promotions happened to fall upon\r\nWest-Pointers, and doubtless Logan and Blair had some reason to\r\nbelieve that we intended to monopolize the higher honors of the war\r\nfor the regular officers.  I remember well my own thoughts and\r\nfeelings at the time, and feel sure that I was not intentionally\r\npartial to any class, I wanted to succeed in taking Atlanta, and\r\nneeded commanders who were purely and technically soldiers, men who\r\nwould obey orders and execute them promptly and on time; for I knew\r\nthat we would have to execute some most delicate manoeuvres,\r\nrequiring the utmost skill, nicety, and precision.  I believed that\r\nGeneral Howard would do all these faithfully and well, and I think\r\nthe result has justified my choice.  I regarded both Generals Logan\r\nand Blair as \"volunteers,\" that looked to personal fame and glory\r\nas auxiliary and secondary to their political ambition, and not as\r\nprofessional soldiers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was known that General Howard had been chosen to\r\ncommand the Army of the Tennessee; General Hooker applied to\r\nGeneral Thomas to be relieved of the command of the Twentieth\r\nCorps, and General Thomas forwarded his application to me approved\r\nand heartily recommended.  I at once telegraphed to General\r\nHalleck, recommending General Slocum (then at Vicksburg) to be his\r\nsuccessor, because Slocum had been displaced from the command of\r\nhis corps at the time when the Eleventh and Twelfth were united and\r\nmade the Twentieth.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hooker was offended because he was not chosen to succeed\r\nMcPherson; but his chances were not even considered; indeed, I had\r\nnever been satisfied with him since his affair at the Gulp House,\r\nand had been more than once disposed to relieve him of his corps,\r\nbecause of his repeated attempts to interfere with Generals\r\nMcPherson and Schofield.  I had known Hooker since 1836, and was\r\nintimately associated with him in California, where we served\r\ntogether on the staff of General Persifer F. Smith.  He had come to\r\nus from the East with a high reputation as a \"fighter,\" which he\r\nhad fully justified at Chattanooga and Peach-Tree Creek; at which\r\nlatter battle I complimented him on the field for special\r\ngallantry, and afterward in official reports.  Still, I did feel a\r\nsense of relief when he left us.  We were then two hundred and\r\nfifty miles in advance of our base, dependent on a single line of\r\nrailroad for our daily food.  We had a bold, determined foe in our\r\nimmediate front, strongly intrenched, with communication open to\r\nhis rear for supplies and reenforcements, and every soldier\r\nrealized that we had plenty of hard fighting ahead, and that all\r\nhonors had to be fairly earned.\r\n\r\nUntil General Slocum joined (in the latter part of August), the\r\nTwentieth Corps was commanded by General A. S. Williams, the senior\r\ndivision commander present.  On the 25th of July the army,\r\ntherefore, stood thus: the Army of the Tennessee (General O. O.\r\nHoward commanding) was on the left, pretty much on the same ground\r\nit had occupied during the battle of the 22d, all ready to move\r\nrapidly by the rear to the extreme right beyond Proctor's Creek;\r\nthe Army of the Ohio (General Schofield) was next in order, with\r\nits left flank reaching the Augusta Railroad; next in order,\r\nconforming closely with the rebel intrenchments of Atlanta, was\r\nGeneral Thomas's Army of the Cumberland, in the order of--the\r\nFourth Corps (Stanley's), the Twentieth Corps (Williams's), and the\r\nFourteenth Corps (Palmer's).  Palmer's right division (Jefferson C.\r\nDavis's) was strongly refused along Proctor's Creek.  This line was\r\nabout five miles long, and was intrenched as against a sally about\r\nas strong as was our enemy.  The cavalry was assembled in two\r\nstrong divisions; that of McCook (including the brigade of Harrison\r\nwhich had been brought in from Opelika by General Rousseau)\r\nnumbered about thirty-five hundred effective cavalry, and was\r\nposted to our right rear, at Turner's Ferry, where we had a good\r\npontoon-bridge; and to our left rear, at and about Decatur, were\r\nthe two cavalry divisions of Stoneman, twenty-five hundred, and\r\nGarrard, four thousand, united for the time and occasion under the\r\ncommand of Major-General George Stoneman, a cavalry-officer of high\r\nrepute.  My plan of action was to move the Army of the Tennessee to\r\nthe right rapidly and boldly against the railroad below Atlanta,\r\nand at the same time to send all the cavalry around by the right\r\nand left to make a lodgment on the Macon road about Jonesboro.\r\n\r\nAll the orders were given, and the morning of the 27th was fixed\r\nfor commencing the movement.  On the 26th I received from General\r\nStoneman a note asking permission (after having accomplished his\r\norders to break up the railroad at Jonesboro) to go on to Macon to\r\nrescue our prisoners of war known to be held there, and then to\r\npush on to Andersonville, where was the great depot of Union\r\nprisoners, in which were penned at one time as many as twenty-three\r\nthousand of our men, badly fed and harshly treated.  I wrote him an\r\nanswer consenting substantially to his proposition, only modifying\r\nit by requiring him to send back General Garrard's division to its\r\nposition on our left flank after he had broken up the railroad at\r\nJonesboro.  Promptly, and on time, all got off, and General Dodge's\r\ncorps (the Sixteenth, of the Army of the Tennessee) reached its\r\nposition across Proctor's Creek the same evening, and early the\r\nnext morning (the 28th) Blair's corps (the Seventeenth) deployed on\r\nhis right, both corps covering their front with the usual parapet;\r\nthe Fifteenth Corps (General Logan's) came up that morning on the\r\nright of Blair, strongly refused, and began to prepare the usual\r\ncover.  As General Jeff. C. Davis's division was, as it were, left\r\nout of line, I ordered it on the evening before to march down\r\ntoward Turner's Ferry, and then to take a road laid down on our\r\nmaps which led from there toward East Point, ready to engage any\r\nenemy that might attack our general right flank, after the same\r\nmanner as had been done to the left flank on the 22d.\r\n\r\nPersonally on the morning of the 28th I followed the movement, and\r\nrode to the extreme right, where we could hear some skirmishing and\r\nan occasional cannon-shot.  As we approached the ground held by the\r\nFifteenth Corps, a cannon-ball passed over my shoulder and killed\r\nthe horse of an orderly behind; and seeing that this gun enfiladed\r\nthe road by which we were riding, we turned out of it and rode down\r\ninto a valley, where we left our horses and walked up to the hill\r\nheld by Morgan L. Smith's division of the Fifteenth Corps.  Near a\r\nhouse I met Generals Howard and Logan, who explained that there was\r\nan intrenched battery to their front, with the appearance of a\r\nstrong infantry support.  I then walked up to the ridge, where I\r\nfound General Morgan L. Smith.  His men were deployed and engaged\r\nin rolling logs and fence-rails, preparing a hasty cover.  From\r\nthis ridge we could overlook the open fields near a meeting-house\r\nknown as \"Ezra Church,\" close by the Poor-House.  We could see the\r\nfresh earth of a parapet covering some guns (that fired an\r\noccasional shot), and there was also an appearance of activity\r\nbeyond.  General Smith was in the act of sending forward a regiment\r\nfrom, his right flank to feel the position of the enemy, when I\r\nexplained to him and to Generals Logan and Howard that they must\r\nlook out for General Jeff. C. Davis's division, which was coming\r\nup from the direction of Turner's Ferry.\r\n\r\nAs the skirmish-fire warmed up along the front of Blair's corps, as\r\nwell as along the Fifteenth Corps (Logan's), I became convinced\r\nthat Hood designed to attack this right flank, to prevent, if\r\npossible, the extension of our line in that direction.  I regained\r\nmy horse, and rode rapidly back to see that Davis's division had\r\nbeen dispatched as ordered.  I found General Davis in person, who\r\nwas unwell, and had sent his division that morning early, under the\r\ncommand of his senior brigadier, Morgan; but, as I attached great\r\nimportance to the movement, he mounted his horse, and rode away to\r\novertake and to hurry forward the movement, so as to come up on the\r\nleft rear of the enemy, during the expected battle.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sound of cannon and musketry denoted a severe\r\nbattle as in progress, which began seriously at 11.30 A.M., and\r\nended substantially by 4 p.m.  It was a fierce attack by the enemy\r\non our extreme right flank, well posted and partially covered.  The\r\nmost authentic account of the battle is given by General Logan, who\r\ncommanded the Fifteenth Corps, in his official report to the\r\nAdjutant-General of the Army of the Tennessee, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS\r\nBEFORE ATLANTA, GEORGIA, July 29, 1864\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel WILLIAM T. CLARK, Assistant Adjutant-General,\r\nArmy of the Tennessee, present.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL: I have the honor to report that, in pursuance of orders, I\r\nmoved my command into position on the right of the Seventeenth\r\nCorps, which was the extreme right of the army in the field, during\r\nthe night of the 27th and morning of the 28th; and, while advancing\r\nin line of battle to a more favorable position, we were met by the\r\nrebel infantry of Hardee's and Lee's corps, who made a determined\r\nand desperate attack on us at 11 A.M. of the 28th (yesterday).\r\n\r\nMy lines were only protected by logs and rails, hastily thrown up\r\nin front of them.\r\n\r\nThe first onset was received and checked, and the battle commenced\r\nand lasted until about three o'clock in the evening.  During that\r\ntime six successive charges were made, which were six times\r\ngallantly repulsed, each time with fearful loss to the enemy.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening my lines were several times assaulted\r\nvigorously, but each time with like result.  The worst of the\r\nfighting occurred on General Harrow's and Morgan L. Smith's fronts,\r\nwhich formed the centre and right of the corps.  The troops could\r\nnot have displayed greater courage, nor greater determination not\r\nto give ground; had they shown less, they would have been driven\r\nfrom their position.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-Generals C. R. Woods, Harrow, and Morgan L. Smith,\r\ndivision commanders, are entitled to equal credit for gallant\r\nconduct and skill in repelling the assault.  My thanks are due to\r\nMajor-Generals Blair and Dodge for sending me reenforcements at a\r\ntime when they were much needed.  My losses were fifty killed, four\r\nhundred and forty-nine wounded, and seventy-three missing:\r\naggregate, five hundred and seventy-two.\r\n\r\nThe division of General Harrow captured five battle-flags.  There\r\nwere about fifteen hundred or two thousand muskets left on the\r\nground. One hundred and six prisoners were captured, exclusive of\r\nseventy-three wounded, who were sent to our hospital, and are being\r\ncared for by our surgeons.  Five hundred and sixty-five rebels have\r\nup to this time been buried, and about two hundred are supposed to\r\nbe yet unburied.  A large number of their wounded were undoubtedly\r\ncarried away in the night, as the enemy did not withdraw till near\r\ndaylight.  The enemy's loss could not have been less than six or\r\nseven thousand men.  A more detailed report will hereafter be made.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully,\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN A.  LOGAN,\r\nMajor-General, commanding Fifteenth Army Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard, in transmitting this report, added:\r\n\r\nI wish to express my high gratification with the conduct of the\r\ntroops engaged.  I never saw better conduct in battle.  General\r\nLogan, though ill and much worn out, was indefatigable, and the\r\nsuccess of the day is as much attributable to him as to any one\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was, of coarse, the first fight in which General Howard had\r\ncommanded the Army of the Tennessee, and he evidently aimed to\r\nreconcile General Logan in his disappointment, and to gain the\r\nheart of his army, to which he was a stranger.  He very properly\r\nleft General Logan to fight his own corps, but exposed himself\r\nfreely; and, after the firing had ceased, in the afternoon he\r\nwalked the lines; the men, as reported to me, gathered about him in\r\nthe most affectionate way, and he at once gained their respect and\r\nconfidence.  To this fact I at the time attached much importance,\r\nfor it put me at ease as to the future conduct of that most\r\nimportant army.\r\n\r\nAt no instant of time did I feel the least uneasiness about the\r\nresult on the 28th, but wanted to reap fuller results, hoping that\r\nDavis's division would come up at the instant of defeat, and catch\r\nthe enemy in flank; but the woods were dense, the roads obscure,\r\nand as usual this division got on the wrong road, and did not come\r\ninto position until about dark.  In like manner, I thought that\r\nHood had greatly weakened his main lines inside of Atlanta, and\r\naccordingly sent repeated orders to Schofield and Thomas to make an\r\nattempt to break in; but both reported that they found the parapets\r\nvery strong and full manned.\r\n\r\nOur men were unusually encouraged by this day's work, for they\r\nrealized that we could compel Hood to come out from behind his\r\nfortified lines to attack us at a disadvantage.  In conversation\r\nwith me, the soldiers of the Fifteenth Corps, with whom I was on\r\nthe most familiar terms, spoke of the affair of the 28th as the\r\neasiest thing in the world; that, in fact, it was a common\r\nslaughter of the enemy; they pointed out where the rebel lines had\r\nbeen, and how they themselves had fired deliberately, had shot down\r\ntheir antagonists, whose bodies still lay unburied, and marked\r\nplainly their lines of battle, which must have halted within easy\r\nmusket-range of our men, who were partially protected by their\r\nimprovised line of logs and fence-rails.  All bore willing\r\ntestimony to the courage and spirit of the foe, who, though\r\nrepeatedly repulsed, came back with increased determination some\r\nsix or more times.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Fifteenth Corps wheeled forward to the left\r\nover the battle-field of the day before, and Davis's division still\r\nfarther prolonged the line, which reached nearly to the\r\never-to-be-remembered \"Sandtown road.\"\r\n\r\nThen, by further thinning out Thomas's line, which was well\r\nentrenched, I drew another division of Palmer's corps (Baird's)\r\naround to the right, to further strengthen that flank.  I was\r\nimpatient to hear from the cavalry raid, then four days out, and\r\nwas watching for its effect, ready to make a bold push for the\r\npossession of East Point.  General Garrard's division returned to\r\nDecatur on the 31st, and reported that General Stoneman had posted\r\nhim at Flat Rock, while he (Stoneman) went on.  The month of July\r\ntherefore closed with our infantry line strongly entrenched, but\r\ndrawn out from the Augusta road on the left to the Sandtown road on\r\nthe right, a distance of full ten measured miles.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, though evidently somewhat intimidated by the results of\r\ntheir defeats on the 22d and 28th, still presented a bold front at\r\nall points, with fortified lines that defied a direct assault.  Our\r\nrailroad was done to the rear of our camps, Colonel W. P. Wright\r\nhaving reconstructed the bridge across the Chattahoochee in six\r\ndays; and our garrisons and detachments to the rear had so\r\neffectually guarded the railroad that the trains from Nashville\r\narrived daily, and our substantial wants were well supplied.\r\n\r\nThe month, though hot in the extreme, had been one of constant\r\nconflict, without intermission, and on four several occasions\r\n--viz., July 4th, 20th, 22d, and 28th--these affairs had amounted to\r\nreal battles, with casualty lists by the thousands.  Assuming the\r\ncorrectness of the rebel surgeon Foard's report, on page 577 of\r\nJohnston's \"Narrative,\" commencing with July 4th and terminating\r\nwith July 31st, we have:\r\n\r\n        Aggregate loss of the enemy......... 10,841\r\n\r\nOur losses, as compiled from the official returns for July,\r\n1864, are:\r\n                     Killed and Missing.    Wounded.    Total.\r\n\r\nAggregate loss of July....... 3,804          5,915      9,719\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this table the column of \"killed and missing\" embraces the\r\nprisoners that fell into the hands of the enemy, mostly lost in the\r\nSeventeenth Corps, on the 22d of July, and does not embrace the\r\nlosses in the cavalry divisions of Garrard and McCook, which,\r\nhowever, were small for July.  In all other respects the statement\r\nis absolutely correct.  I am satisfied, however, that Surgeon Foard\r\ncould not have been in possession of data sufficiently accurate to\r\nenable him to report the losses in actual battle of men who never\r\nsaw the hospital.  During the whole campaign I had rendered to me\r\ntri-monthly statements of \"effective strength,\" from which I\r\ncarefully eliminated the figures not essential for my conduct, so\r\nthat at all times I knew the exact fighting-strength of each corps,\r\ndivision, and brigade, of the whole army, and also endeavored to\r\nbear in mind our losses both on the several fields of battle and by\r\nsickness, and well remember that I always estimated that during the\r\nmonth of July we had inflicted heavier loss on the enemy than we\r\nhad sustained ourselves, and the above figures prove it\r\nconclusively.  Before closing this chapter, I must record one or\r\ntwo minor events that occurred about this time, that may prove of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July I received a dispatch from Inspector-General\r\nJames A. Hardie, then on duty at the War Department in Washington,\r\nto the effect that Generals Osterhaus and Alvan P. Hovey had been\r\nappointed major-generals.  Both of these had begun the campaign\r\nwith us in command of divisions, but had gone to the rear--the\r\nformer by reason of sickness, and the latter dissatisfied with\r\nGeneral Schofield and myself about the composition of his division\r\nof the Twenty-third Corps.  Both were esteemed as first-class\r\nofficers, who had gained special distinction in the Vicksburg\r\ncampaign.  But up to that time, when the newspapers announced daily\r\npromotions elsewhere, no prominent officers serving with me had\r\nbeen advanced a peg, and I felt hurt.  I answered Hardie on the\r\n25th, in a dispatch which has been made public, closing with this\r\nlanguage: \"If the rear be the post of honor, then we had better all\r\nchange front on Washington.\"  To my amazement, in a few days I\r\nreceived from President Lincoln himself an answer, in which he\r\ncaught me fairly.  I have not preserved a copy of that dispatch,\r\nand suppose it was burned up in the Chicago fire; but it was\r\ncharacteristic of Mr. Lincoln, and was dated the 26th or 27th day\r\nof July, contained unequivocal expressions of respect for those who\r\nwere fighting hard and unselfishly, offering us a full share of the\r\nhonors and rewards of the war, and saying that, in the cases of\r\nHovey and Osterhaus, he was influenced mainly by the\r\nrecommendations of Generals Grant and Sherman.  On the 27th I\r\nreplied direct, apologizing somewhat for my message to General\r\nHardie, saying that I did not suppose such messages ever reached\r\nhim personally, explaining that General Grant's and Sherman's\r\nrecommendations for Hovey and Osterhaus had been made when the\r\nevents of the Vicksburg campaign were fresh with us, and that my\r\ndispatch of the 25th to General Hardie had reflected chiefly the\r\nfeelings of the officers then present with me before Atlanta.  The\r\nresult of all this, however, was good, for another dispatch from\r\nGeneral Hardie, of the 28th, called on me to nominate eight\r\ncolonels for promotion as brigadier-generals.  I at once sent a\r\ncircular note to the army-commanders to nominate two colonels from\r\nthe Army of the Ohio and three from each of the others; and the\r\nresult was, that on the 29th of July I telegraphed the names of--\r\n\r\nColonel William Gross, Thirty-sixth Indiana; Colonel Charles C.\r\nWalcutt, Forty-sixth Ohio; Colonel James W. Riley, One Hundred and\r\nFourth Ohio; Colonel L. P. Bradley, Fifty-first Illinois; Colonel\r\nJ. W. Sprague, Sixty-third Ohio; Colonel Joseph A. Cooper, Sixth\r\nEast Tennessee; Colonel John T. Croxton, Fourth Kentucky; Colonel\r\nWilliam W. Belknap, Fifteenth Iowa.  These were promptly appointed\r\nbrigadier-generals, were already in command of brigades or\r\ndivisions; and I doubt if eight promotions were ever made fairer,\r\nor were more honestly earned, during the whole war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF ATLANTA.\r\n\r\nAUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, 1864\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of August opened hot and sultry, but our position before\r\nAtlanta was healthy, with ample supply of wood, water, and\r\nprovisions.  The troops had become habituated to the slow and\r\nsteady progress of the siege; the skirmish-lines were held close up\r\nto the enemy, were covered by rifle-trenches or logs, and kept up a\r\ncontinuous clatter of musketry.  The mainlines were held farther\r\nback, adapted to the shape of the ground, with muskets loaded and\r\nstacked for instant use.  The field-batteries were in select\r\npositions, covered by handsome parapets, and occasional shots from\r\nthem gave life and animation to the scene.  The men loitered about\r\nthe trenches carelessly, or busied themselves in constructing\r\ningenious huts out of the abundant timber, and seemed as snug,\r\ncomfortable, and happy, as though they were at home.  General\r\nSchofield was still on the extreme left, Thomas in the centre, and\r\nHoward on the right.  Two divisions of the Fourteenth Corps\r\n(Baird's and Jeff.  C. Davis's) were detached to the right rear,\r\nand held in reserve.\r\n\r\nI thus awaited the effect of the cavalry movement against the\r\nrailroad about Jonesboro, and had heard from General Garrard that\r\nStoneman had gone on to Mason; during that day (August 1st) Colonel\r\nBrownlow, of a Tennessee cavalry regiment, came in to Marietta from\r\nGeneral McCook, and reported that McCook's whole division had been\r\noverwhelmed, defeated, and captured at Newnan.  Of course, I was\r\ndisturbed by this wild report, though I discredited it, but made\r\nall possible preparations to strengthen our guards along the\r\nrailroad to the rear, on the theory that the force of cavalry which\r\nhad defeated McCook would at once be on the railroad about\r\nMarietta.  At the same time Garrard was ordered to occupy the\r\ntrenches on our left, while Schofield's whole army moved to the\r\nextreme right, and extended the line toward East Point.  Thomas was\r\nalso ordered still further to thin out his lines, so as to set free\r\nthe other division (Johnson's) of the Fourteenth Corps (Palmer's),\r\nwhich was moved to the extreme right rear, and held in reserve\r\nready to make a bold push from that flank to secure a footing on\r\nthe Mason Railroad at or below East Point.\r\n\r\nThese changes were effected during the 2d and 3d days of August,\r\nwhen General McCook came in and reported the actual results of his\r\ncavalry expedition.  He had crossed the Chattahoochee River below\r\nCampbellton, by his pontoon-bridge; had then marched rapidly across\r\nto the Mason Railroad at Lovejoy's Station, where he had reason to\r\nexpect General Stoneman; but, not hearing of him, he set to work,\r\ntore up two miles of track, burned two trains of cars, and cut away\r\nfive miles of telegraph-wire.  He also found the wagon-train\r\nbelonging to the rebel army in Atlanta, burned five hundred wagons,\r\nkilled eight hundred mules; and captured seventy-two officers and\r\nthree hundred and fifty men.  Finding his progress eastward, toward\r\nMcDonough, barred by a superior force, he turned back to Newnan,\r\nwhere he found himself completely surrounded by infantry and\r\ncavalry.  He had to drop his prisoners and fight his way out,\r\nlosing about six hundred men in killed and captured, and then\r\nreturned with the remainder to his position at Turner's Ferry.\r\nThis was bad enough, but not so bad as had been reported by Colonel\r\nBrownlow.  Meantime, rumors came that General Stoneman was down\r\nabout Mason, on the east bank of the Ocmulgee.  On the 4th of\r\nAugust Colonel Adams got to Marietta with his small brigade of nine\r\nhundred men belonging to Stoneman's cavalry, reporting, as usual,\r\nall the rest lost, and this was partially confirmed by a report\r\nwhich came to me all the way round by General Grant's headquarters\r\nbefore Richmond.  A few days afterward Colonel Capron also got in,\r\nwith another small brigade perfectly demoralized, and confirmed the\r\nreport that General Stoneman had covered the escape of these two\r\nsmall brigades, himself standing with a reserve of seven hundred\r\nmen, with which he surrendered to a Colonel Iverson.  Thus another\r\nof my cavalry divisions was badly damaged, and out of the fragments\r\nwe hastily reorganized three small divisions under\r\nBrigadier-Generals Garrard, McCook, and Kilpatrick.\r\n\r\nStoneman had not obeyed his orders to attack the railroad first\r\nbefore going to Macon and Andersonville, but had crossed the\r\nOcmulgee River high up near Covington, and had gone down that river\r\non the east bank.  He reached Clinton, and sent out detachments\r\nwhich struck the railroad leading from Macon to Savannah at\r\nGriswold Station, where they found and destroyed seventeen\r\nlocomotives and over a hundred cars; then went on and burned the\r\nbridge across the Oconee, and reunited the division before Macon.\r\nStoneman shelled the town across the river, but could not cross\r\nover by the bridge, and returned to Clinton, where he found his\r\nretreat obstructed, as he supposed, by a superior force.  There he\r\nbecame bewildered, and sacrificed himself for the safety of his\r\ncommand.  He occupied the attention of his enemy by a small force\r\nof seven hundred men, giving Colonels Adams and Capron leave, with\r\ntheir brigades, to cut their way back to me at Atlanta.  The former\r\nreached us entire, but the latter was struck and scattered at some\r\nplace farther north, and came in by detachments.  Stoneman\r\nsurrendered, and remained a prisoner until he was exchanged some\r\ntime after, late in September, at Rough and Ready.\r\n\r\nI now became satisfied that cavalry could not, or would not, make a\r\nsufficient lodgment on the railroad below Atlanta, and that nothing\r\nwould suffice but for us to reach it with the main army.  Therefore\r\nthe most urgent efforts to that end were made, and to Schofield, on\r\nthe right, was committed the charge of this special object.  He had\r\nhis own corps (the Twenty-third), composed of eleven thousand and\r\nseventy-five infantry and eight hundred and eighty-five artillery,\r\nwith McCook's broken division of cavalry, seventeen hundred and\r\nfifty-four men and horses.  For this purpose I also placed the\r\nFourteenth Corps (Palmer) under his orders.  This corps numbered at\r\nthe time seventeen thousand two hundred and eighty-eight infantry\r\nand eight hundred and twenty-six artillery; but General Palmer\r\nclaimed to rank General Schofield in the date of his commission as\r\nmajor-general, and denied the latter's right to exercise command\r\nover him.  General Palmer was a man of ability, but was not\r\nenterprising.  His three divisions were compact and strong, well\r\ncommanded, admirable on the defensive, but slow to move or to act\r\non the offensive.  His corps (the Fourteenth) had sustained, up to\r\nthat time, fewer hard knocks than any other corps in the whole\r\narmy, and I was anxious to give it a chance.  I always expected to\r\nhave a desperate fight to get possession of the Macon road, which\r\nwas then the vital objective of the campaign.  Its possession by us\r\nwould, in my judgment, result in the capture of Atlanta, and give\r\nus the fruits of victory, although the destruction of Hood's army\r\nwas the real object to be desired.  Yet Atlanta was known as the\r\n\"Gate-City of the South,\" was full of founderies, arsenals, and\r\nmachine-shops, and I knew that its capture would be the death-knell\r\nof the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of August I ordered General Schofield to make a bold\r\nattack on the railroad, anywhere about East Point, and ordered\r\nGeneral Palmer to report to him for duty.  He at once denied\r\nGeneral Schofield's right to command him; but, after examining the\r\ndates of their respective commissions, and hearing their arguments,\r\nI wrote to General Palmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 4th.-10.45 p.m.\r\n\r\nFrom the statements made by yourself and General Schofield to-day,\r\nmy decision is, that he ranks you as a major-general, being of the\r\nsame date of present commission, by reason of his previous superior\r\nrank as brigadier-general.  The movements of to-morrow are so\r\nimportant that the orders of the superior on that flank must be\r\nregarded as military orders, and not in the nature of cooperation.\r\nI did hope that there would be no necessity for my making this\r\ndecision; but it is better for all parties interested that no\r\nquestion of rank should occur in actual battle.  The Sandtown road,\r\nand the railroad, if possible, must be gained to-morrow, if it\r\ncosts half your command.  I regard the loss of time this afternoon\r\nas equal to the loss of two thousand men.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also communicated the substance of this to General Thomas, to\r\nwhose army Palmer's corps belonged, who replied on the 5th:\r\n\r\n\r\nI regret to hear that Palmer has taken the course he has, and I\r\nknow that he intends to offer his resignation as soon as he can\r\nproperly do so.  I recommend that his application be granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on the 5th I again wrote to General Palmer, arguing the point\r\nwith him, advising him, as a friend, not to resign at that crisis\r\nlest his motives might be misconstrued, and because it might damage\r\nhis future career in civil life; but, at the same time, I felt it\r\nmy duty to say to him that the operations on that flank, during the\r\n4th and 5th, had not been satisfactory--not imputing to him,\r\nhowever, any want of energy or skill, but insisting that \"the\r\nevents did not keep pace with my desires.\"  General Schofield had\r\nreported to me that night:\r\n\r\n\r\nI am compelled to acknowledge that I have totally failed to make\r\nany aggressive movement with the Fourteenth Corps.  I have ordered\r\nGeneral Johnson's division to replace General Hascall's this\r\nevening, and I propose to-morrow to take my own troops\r\n(Twenty-third Corps) to the right, and try to recover what has been\r\nlost by two days' delay.  The force may likely be too small.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sanctioned the movement, and ordered two of Palmers divisions\r\n--Davis's and Baird's--to follow en echelon in support of Schofield,\r\nand summoned General Palmer to meet me in person: He came on the\r\n6th to my headquarters, and insisted on his resignation being\r\naccepted, for which formal act I referred him to General Thomas.\r\nHe then rode to General Thomas's camp, where he made a written\r\nresignation of his office as commander of the Fourteenth Corps, and\r\nwas granted the usual leave of absence to go to his home in\r\nIllinois, there to await further orders.  General Thomas\r\nrecommended that the resignation be accepted; that Johnson, the\r\nsenior division commander of the corps, should be ordered back to\r\nNashville as chief of cavalry, and that Brigadier-General Jefferson\r\nC. Davis, the next in order, should be promoted major general, and\r\nassigned to command the corps.  These changes had to be referred to\r\nthe President, in Washington, and were, in due time, approved and\r\nexecuted; and thenceforward I had no reason to complain of the\r\nslowness or inactivity of that splendid corps. It had been\r\noriginally formed by General George H. Thomas, had been commanded\r\nby him in person, and had imbibed some what his personal character,\r\nviz., steadiness, good order, and deliberation nothing hasty or\r\nrash, but always safe, \"slow, and sure.\"  On August 7th I\r\ntelegraphed to General Halleck:\r\n\r\n\r\nHave received to-day the dispatches of the Secretary of War and of\r\nGeneral Grant, which are very satisfactory.  We keep hammering away\r\nall the time, and there is no peace, inside or outside of Atlanta.\r\nTo-day General Schofield got round the line which was assaulted\r\nyesterday by General Reilly's brigade, turned it and gained the\r\nground where the assault had been made, and got possession of all\r\nour dead and wounded.  He continued to press on that flank, and\r\nbrought on a noisy but not a bloody battle.  He drove the enemy\r\nbehind his main breastworks, which cover the railroad from Atlanta\r\nto East Point, and captured a good many of the skirmishers, who are\r\nof his best troops--for the militia hug the breastworks close.  I\r\ndo not deem it prudent to extend any more to the right, but will\r\npush forward daily by parallels, and make the inside of Atlanta too\r\nhot to be endured.  I have sent back to Chattanooga for two\r\nthirty-pound Parrotts, with which we can pick out almost any house in\r\ntown.  I am too impatient for a siege, and don't know but this is as\r\ngood a place to fight it out on, as farther inland.  One thing is\r\ncertain, whether we get inside of Atlanta or not, it will be a\r\nused-up community when we are done with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Schofield's extension on the 5th, General Reilly's brigade had\r\nstruck an outwork, which he promptly attacked, but, as usual, got\r\nentangled in the trees and bushes which had been felled, and lost\r\nabout five hundred men, in killed and wounded; but, as above\r\nreported, this outwork was found abandoned the next day, and we\r\ncould see from it that the rebels were extending their lines,\r\nparallel with the railroad, about as fast as we could add to our\r\nline of investment.  On the 10th of August the Parrott\r\nthirty-pounders were received and placed in Position; for a couple\r\nof days we kept up a sharp fire from all our batteries converging\r\non Atlanta, and at every available point we advanced our\r\ninfantry-lines, thereby shortening and strengthening the\r\ninvestment; but I was not willing to order a direct assault, unless\r\nsome accident or positive neglect on the part of our antagonist\r\nshould reveal an opening.  However, it was manifest that no such\r\nopening was intended by Hood, who felt secure behind his strong\r\ndefenses.  He had repelled our cavalry attacks on his railroad, and\r\nhad damaged us seriously thereby, so I expected that he would\r\nattempt the same game against our rear.  Therefore I made\r\nextraordinary exertions to recompose our cavalry divisions, which\r\nwere so essential, both for defense and offense.  Kilpatrick was\r\ngiven that on our right rear, in support of Schofield's exposed\r\nflank; Garrard retained that on our general left; and McCook's\r\ndivision was held somewhat in reserve, about Marietta and the\r\nrailroad.  On the 10th, having occasion to telegraph to General\r\nGrant, then in Washington, I used this language:\r\n\r\n\r\nSince July 28th Hood has not attempted to meet us outside his\r\nparapets.  In order to possess and destroy effectually his\r\ncommunications, I may have to leave a corps at the railroad-bridge,\r\nwell intrenched, and cut loose with the balance to make a circle of\r\ndesolation around Atlanta.  I do not propose to assault the works,\r\nwhich are too strong, nor to proceed by regular approaches.  I have\r\nlost a good many regiments, and will lose more, by the expiration\r\nof service; and this is the only reason why I want reenforcements.\r\nWe have killed, crippled, and captured more of the enemy than we\r\nhave lost by his acts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August I heard of the success of Admiral Farragut in\r\nentering Mobile Bay, which was regarded as a most valuable\r\nauxiliary to our operations at Atlanta; and learned that I had been\r\ncommissioned a major-general in the regular army, which was\r\nunexpected, and not desired until successful in the capture of\r\nAtlanta.  These did not change the fact that we were held in check\r\nby the stubborn defense of the place, and a conviction was forced\r\non my mind that our enemy would hold fast, even though every house\r\nin the town should be battered down by our artillery.  It was\r\nevident that we most decoy him out to fight us on something like\r\nequal terms, or else, with the whole army, raise the siege and\r\nattack his communications.  Accordingly, on the 13th of August, I\r\ngave general orders for the Twentieth Corps to draw back to the\r\nrailroad-bridge at the Chattahoochee, to protect our trains,\r\nhospitals, spare artillery, and the railroad-depot, while the rest\r\nof the army should move bodily to some point on the Macon Railroad\r\nbelow East Point.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I learned just then that the enemy's cavalry, under\r\nGeneral Wheeler, had made a wide circuit around our left flank, and\r\nhad actually reached our railroad at Tilton Station, above Resaca,\r\ncaptured a drove of one thousand of our beef-cattle, and was strong\r\nenough to appear before Dalton, and demand of its commander,\r\nColonel Raum, the surrender of the place.  General John E. Smith,\r\nwho was at Kingston, collected together a couple of thousand men,\r\nand proceeded in cars to the relief of Dalton when Wheeler\r\nretreated northward toward Cleveland.  On the 16th another\r\ndetachment of the enemy's cavalry appeared in force about Allatoona\r\nand the Etowah bridge, when I became fully convinced that Hood had\r\nsent all of his cavalry to raid upon our railroads.  For some days\r\nour communication with Nashville was interrupted by the destruction\r\nof the telegraph-lines, as well as railroad.  I at once ordered\r\nstrong reconnoissances forward from our flanks on the left by\r\nGarrard, and on the right by Kilpatrick.  The former moved with so\r\nmuch caution that I was displeased; but Kilpatrick, on the\r\ncontrary, displayed so much zeal and activity that I was attracted\r\nto him at once.  He reached Fairburn Station, on the West Point\r\nroad, and tore it up, returning safely to his position on our right\r\nflank.  I summoned him to me, and was so pleased with his spirit\r\nand confidence, that I concluded to suspend the general movement of\r\nthe main army, and to send him with his small division of cavalry\r\nto break up the Macon road about Jonesboro, in the hopes that it\r\nwould force Hood to evacuate Atlanta, and that I should thereby not\r\nonly secure possession of the city itself, but probably could catch\r\nHood in the confusion of retreat; and, further to increase the\r\nchances of success.\r\n\r\nI ordered General Thomas to detach two brigades of Garrard's\r\ndivision of cavalry from the left to the right rear, to act as a\r\nreserve in support of General Kilpatrick.  Meantime, also, the\r\nutmost activity was ordered along our whole front by the infantry\r\nand artillery.  Kilpatrick got off during the night of the 18th,\r\nand returned to us on the 22d, having made the complete circuit of\r\nAtlanta.  He reported that he had destroyed three miles of the\r\nrailroad about Jonesboro, which he reckoned would take ten days to\r\nrepair; that he had encountered a division of infantry and a\r\nbrigade of cavalry (Ross's); that he had captured a battery and\r\ndestroyed three of its guns, bringing one in as a trophy, and he\r\nalso brought in three battle-flags and seventy prisoners.  On the\r\n23d, however, we saw trains coming into Atlanta from the south,\r\nwhen I became more than ever convinced that cavalry could not or\r\nwould not work hard enough to disable a railroad properly, and\r\ntherefore resolved at once to proceed to the execution of my\r\noriginal plan.  Meantime, the damage done to our own railroad and\r\ntelegraph by Wheeler, about Resaca and Dalton, had been repaired,\r\nand Wheeler himself was too far away to be of any service to his\r\nown army, and where he could not do us much harm, viz., up about\r\nthe Hiawassee.  On the 24th I rode down to the Chattahoochee\r\nbridge, to see in person that it could be properly defended by the\r\nsingle corps proposed to be left there for that purpose, and found\r\nthat the rebel works, which had been built by Johnston to resist\r\nus, could be easily utilized against themselves; and on returning\r\nto my camp, at   that same evening, I telegraphed to General\r\nHalleck as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHeavy fires in Atlanta all day, caused by our artillery.  I will be\r\nall ready, and will commence the movement around Atlanta by the\r\nsouth, tomorrow night, and for some time you will hear little of\r\nus.  I will keep open a courier line back to the Chattahoochee\r\nbridge, by way of Sandtown.  The Twentieth Corps will hold the\r\nrailroad-bridge, and I will move with the balance of the army,\r\nprovisioned for twenty days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime General Dodge (commanding the Sixteenth Corps) had been\r\nwounded in the forehead, had gone to the rear, and his two\r\ndivisions were distributed to the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps.\r\nThe real movement commenced on the 25th, at night.  The Twentieth\r\nCorps drew back and took post at the railroad-bridge, and the\r\nFourth Corps (Stanley) moved to his right rear, closing up with the\r\nFourteenth Corps (Jeff. C. Davis) near Utoy Creek; at the same time\r\nGarrard's cavalry, leaving their horses out of sight, occupied the\r\nvacant trenches, so that the enemy did not detect the change at\r\nall.  The next night (26th) the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps,\r\ncomposing the Army of the Tennessee (Howard), drew out of their\r\ntrenches, made a wide circuit, and came up on the extreme right of\r\nthe Fourth and Fourteenth Corps of the Army of the Cumberland\r\n(Thomas) along Utoy Creek, facing south.  The enemy seemed to\r\nsuspect something that night, using his artillery pretty freely;\r\nbut I think he supposed we were going to retreat altogether.  An\r\nartillery-shot, fired at random, killed one man and wounded\r\nanother, and the next morning some of his infantry came out of\r\nAtlanta and found our camps abandoned.  It was afterward related\r\nthat there was great rejoicing in Atlanta \"that the Yankees were\r\ngone;\" the fact was telegraphed all over the South, and several\r\ntrains of cars (with ladies) came up from Macon to assist in the\r\ncelebration of their grand victory.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th (making a general left-wheel, pivoting on Schofield)\r\nboth Thomas and Howard reached the West Point Railroad, extending\r\nfrom East Point to Red-Oak Station and Fairburn, where we spent the\r\nnext day (29th) in breaking it up thoroughly.  The track was heaved\r\nup in sections the length of a regiment, then separated rail by\r\nrail; bonfires were made of the ties and of fence-rails on which\r\nthe rails were heated, carried to trees or telegraph-poles, wrapped\r\naround and left to cool.  Such rails could not be used again; and,\r\nto be still more certain, we filled up many deep cuts with trees,\r\nbrush, and earth, and commingled with them loaded shells, so\r\narranged that they would explode on an attempt to haul out the\r\nbushes.  The explosion of one such shell would have demoralized a\r\ngang of negroes, and thus would have prevented even the attempt to\r\nclear the road.\r\n\r\nMeantime Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, presented a bold\r\nfront toward East Point, daring and inviting the enemy to sally out\r\nto attack him in position.  His first movement was on the 30th, to\r\nMount Gilead Church, then to Morrow's Mills, facing Rough and\r\nReady.  Thomas was on his right, within easy support, moving by\r\ncross-roads from Red Oak to the Fayetteville road, extending from\r\nCouch's to Renfrew's; and Howard was aiming for Jonesboro.\r\n\r\nI was with General Thomas that day, which was hot but otherwise\r\nvery pleasant.  We stopped for a short noon-rest near a little\r\nchurch (marked on our maps as Shoal-Creek Church), which stood back\r\nabout a hundred yards from the road, in a grove of native oaks.\r\nThe infantry column had halted in the road, stacked their arms, and\r\nthe men were scattered about--some lying in the shade of the trees,\r\nand others were bringing corn-stalks from a large corn-field across\r\nthe road to feed our horses, while still others had arms full of\r\nthe roasting-ears, then in their prime.  Hundreds of fires were\r\nsoon started with the fence-rails, and the men were busy roasting\r\nthe ears.  Thomas and I were walking up and down the road which led\r\nto the church, discussing the chances of the movement, which he\r\nthought were extra-hazardous, and our path carried us by a fire at\r\nwhich a soldier was roasting his corn.  The fire was built\r\nartistically; the man was stripping the ears of their husks,\r\nstanding them in front of his fire, watching them carefully, and\r\nturning each ear little by little, so as to roast it nicely.  He\r\nwas down on his knees intent on his business, paying little heed to\r\nthe stately and serious deliberations of his leaders.  Thomas's\r\nmind was running on the fact that we had cut loose from our base of\r\nsupplies, and that seventy thousand men were then dependent for\r\ntheir food on the chance supplies of the country (already\r\nimpoverished by the requisitions of the enemy), and on the contents\r\nof our wagons.  Between Thomas and his men there existed a most\r\nkindly relation, and he frequently talked with them in the most\r\nfamiliar way.  Pausing awhile, and watching the operations of this\r\nman roasting his corn, he said, \"What are you doing?\"  The man\r\nlooked up smilingly \"Why, general, I am laying in a supply of\r\nprovisions.\"  \"That is right, my man, but don't waste your\r\nprovisions.\"  As we resumed our walk, the man remarked, in a sort\r\nof musing way, but loud enough for me to hear: \"There he goes,\r\nthere goes the old man, economizing as usual.\"  \"Economizing\" with\r\ncorn, which cost only the labor of gathering and roasting!\r\n\r\nAs we walked, we could hear General Howard's guns at intervals,\r\naway off to our right front, but an ominous silence continued\r\ntoward our left, where I was expecting at each moment to hear the\r\nsound of battle.  That night we reached Renfrew's, and had reports\r\nfrom left to right (from General Schofield, about Morrow's Mills,\r\nto General Howard, within a couple of miles of Jonesboro).  The\r\nnext morning (August 31st) all moved straight for the railroad.\r\nSchofield reached it near Rough and Ready, and Thomas at two points\r\nbetween there and Jonesboro.  Howard found an intrenched foe\r\n(Hardee's corps) covering Jonesboro, and his men began at once to\r\ndig their accustomed rifle-pits.  Orders were sent to Generals\r\nThomas and Schofield to turn straight for Jonesboro, tearing up the\r\nrailroad-track as they advanced.  About 3.00 p.m.  the enemy\r\nsallied from Jonesboro against the Fifteenth corps, but was easily\r\nrepulsed, and driven back within his lines.  All hands were kept\r\nbusy tearing up the railroad, and it was not until toward evening\r\nof the 1st day of September that the Fourteenth Corps (Davis)\r\nclosed down on the north front of Jonesboro, connecting on his\r\nright with Howard, and his left reaching the railroad, along which\r\nGeneral Stanley was moving, followed by Schofield.  General Davis\r\nformed his divisions in line about 4 p.m., swept forward over some\r\nold cotton-fields in full view, and went over the rebel parapet\r\nhandsomely, capturing the whole of Govan's brigade, with two\r\nfield-batteries of ten guns.  Being on the spot, I checked Davis's\r\nmovement, and ordered General Howard to send the two divisions of\r\nthe Seventeenth Corps (Blair) round by his right rear, to get below\r\nJonesboro, and to reach the railroad, so as to cut off retreat in\r\nthat direction.  I also dispatched orders after orders to hurry\r\nforward Stanley, so as to lap around Jonesboro on the east, hoping\r\nthus to capture the whole of Hardee's corps.  I sent first Captain\r\nAudenried (aide-de-camp), then Colonel Poe, of the Engineers, and\r\nlastly General Thomas himself (and that is the only time during the\r\ncampaign I can recall seeing General Thomas urge his horse into a\r\ngallop).  Night was approaching, and the country on the farther\r\nside of the railroad was densely wooded.  General Stanley had come\r\nup on the left of Davis, and was deploying, though there could not\r\nhave been on his front more than a skirmish-line.  Had he moved\r\nstraight on by the flank, or by a slight circuit to his left, he\r\nwould have inclosed the whole ground occupied by Hardee's corps,\r\nand that corps could not have escaped us; but night came on, and\r\nHardee did escape.\r\n\r\nMeantime General Slocum had reached his corps (the Twentieth),\r\nstationed at the Chattahoochee bridge, had relieved General A. S.\r\nWilliams in command, and orders had been sent back to him to feel\r\nforward occasionally toward Atlanta, to observe the effect when we\r\nhad reached the railroad.  That night I was so restless and\r\nimpatient that I could not sleep, and about midnight there arose\r\ntoward Atlanta sounds of shells exploding, and other sound like\r\nthat of musketry.  I walked to the house of a farmer close by my\r\nbivouac, called him out to listen to the reverberations which came\r\nfrom the direction of Atlanta (twenty miles to the north of us),\r\nand inquired of him if he had resided there long.  He said he had,\r\nand that these sounds were just like those of a battle.  An\r\ninterval of quiet then ensued, when again, about 4 A.M., arose\r\nother similar explosions, but I still remained in doubt whether the\r\nenemy was engaged in blowing up his own magazines, or whether\r\nGeneral Slocum had not felt forward, and become engaged in a real\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe next morning General Hardee was gone, and we all pushed forward\r\nalong the railroad south, in close pursuit, till we ran up against\r\nhis lines at a point just above Lovejoy's Station.  While bringing\r\nforward troops and feeling the new position of our adversary,\r\nrumors came from the rear that the enemy had evacuated Atlanta, and\r\nthat General Slocum was in the city.  Later in the day I received a\r\nnote in Slocum's own handwriting, stating that he had heard during\r\nthe night the very sounds that I have referred to; that he had\r\nmoved rapidly up from the bridge about daylight, and had entered\r\nAtlanta unopposed.  His letter was dated inside the city, so there\r\nwas no doubt of the fact.  General Thomas's bivouac was but a short\r\ndistance from mine, and, before giving notice to the army in\r\ngeneral orders, I sent one of my staff-officers to show him the\r\nnote.  In a few minutes the officer returned, soon followed by\r\nThomas himself, who again examined the note, so as to be perfectly\r\ncertain that it was genuine.  The news seemed to him too good to be\r\ntrue.  He snapped his fingers, whistled, and almost danced, and, as\r\nthe news spread to the army, the shouts that arose from our men,\r\nthe wild hallooing and glorious laughter, were to us a full\r\nrecompense for the labor and toils and hardships through which we\r\nhad passed in the previous three months.\r\n\r\nA courier-line was at once organized, messages were sent back and\r\nforth from our camp at Lovejoy's to Atlanta, and to our\r\ntelegraph-station at the Chattahoochee bridge.  Of course, the glad\r\ntidings flew on the wings of electricity to all parts of the North,\r\nwhere the people had patiently awaited news of their husbands, sons,\r\nand brothers, away down in \"Dixie Land;\" and congratulations came\r\npouring back full of good-will and patriotism.  This victory was most\r\nopportune; Mr. Lincoln himself told me afterward that even he had\r\npreviously felt in doubt, for the summer was fast passing away; that\r\nGeneral Grant seemed to be checkmated about Richmond and Petersburg,\r\nand my army seemed to have run up against an impassable barrier,\r\nwhen, suddenly and unexpectedly, came the news that \"Atlanta was\r\nours, and fairly won.\"  On this text many a fine speech was made, but\r\nnone more eloquent than that by Edward Everett, in Boston.  A\r\npresidential election then agitated the North.  Mr. Lincoln\r\nrepresented the national cause, and General McClellan had accepted\r\nthe nomination of the Democratic party, whose platform was that the\r\nwar was a failure, and that it was better to allow the South to go\r\nfree to establish a separate government, whose corner-stone should be\r\nslavery.  Success to our arms at that instant was therefore a\r\npolitical necessity; and it was all-important that something\r\nstartling in our interest should occur before the election in\r\nNovember.  The brilliant success at Atlanta filled that requirement,\r\nand made the election of Mr. Lincoln certain.  Among the many letters\r\nof congratulation received, those of Mr. Lincoln and General Grant\r\nseem most important:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. September 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe national thanks are rendered by the President to Major-General\r\nW. T. Sherman and the gallant officers and soldiers of his command\r\nbefore Atlanta, for the distinguished ability and perseverance\r\ndisplayed in the campaign in Georgia, which, under Divine favor,\r\nhas resulted in the capture of Atlanta.  The marches, battles,\r\nsieges, and other military operations, that have signalized the\r\ncampaign, must render it famous in the annals of war, and have\r\nentitled those who have participated therein to the applause and\r\nthanks of the nation.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\nPresident of the United States\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT VIRGINIA, September 4, 1864-9 P.M.\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\nI have just received your dispatch announcing the capture of\r\nAtlanta.  In honor of your great victory, I have ordered a salute\r\nto be fired with shotted guns from every battery bearing upon the\r\nenemy.  The salute will be fired within an hour, amid great\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese dispatches were communicated to the army in general orders,\r\nand we all felt duly encouraged and elated by the praise of those\r\ncompetent to bestow it.\r\n\r\nThe army still remained where the news of success had first found\r\nus, viz., Lovejoy's; but, after due refection, I resolved not to\r\nattempt at that time a further pursuit of Hood's army, but slowly\r\nand deliberately to move back, occupy Atlanta, enjoy a short period\r\nof rest, and to think well over the next step required in the\r\nprogress of events.  Orders for this movement were made on the 5th\r\nSeptember, and three days were given for each army to reach the\r\nplace assigned it, viz.: the Army of the Cumberland in and about\r\nAtlanta; the Army of the Tennessee at East Point; and the Army of\r\nthe Ohio at Decatur.\r\n\r\nPersonally I rode back to Jonesboro on the 6th, and there inspected\r\nthe rebel hospital, full of wounded officers and men left by Hardee\r\nin his retreat.  The next night we stopped at Rough and Ready, and\r\non the 8th of September we rode into Atlanta, then occupied by the\r\nTwentieth Corps (General Slocum).  In the Court-House Square was\r\nencamped a brigade, embracing the Massachusetts Second and\r\nThirty-third Regiments, which had two of the finest bands of the\r\narmy, and their music was to us all a source of infinite pleasure\r\nduring our sojourn in that city.  I took up my headquarters in the\r\nhouse of Judge Lyons, which stood opposite one corner of the\r\nCourt-House Square, and at once set about a measure already ordered,\r\nof which I had thought much and long, viz., to remove the entire\r\ncivil population, and to deny to all civilians from the rear the\r\nexpected profits of civil trade.  Hundreds of sutlers and traders\r\nwere waiting at Nashville and Chattanooga, greedy to reach Atlanta\r\nwith their wares and goods, with, which to drive a profitable trade\r\nwith the inhabitants.  I gave positive orders that none of these\r\ntraders, except three (one for each separate army), should be\r\npermitted to come nearer than Chattanooga; and, moreover, I\r\nperemptorily required that all the citizens and families resident in\r\nAtlanta should go away, giving to each the option to go south or\r\nnorth, as their interests or feelings dictated.  I was resolved to\r\nmake Atlanta a pure military garrison or depot, with no civil\r\npopulation to influence military measures.  I had seen Memphis,\r\nVicksburg, Natchez, and New Orleans, all captured from the enemy, and\r\neach at once was garrisoned by a full division of troops, if not\r\nmore; so that success was actually crippling our armies in the field\r\nby detachments to guard and protect the interests of a hostile\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nI gave notice of this purpose, as early as the 4th of September, to\r\nGeneral Halleck, in a letter concluding with these words:\r\n\r\nIf the people raise a howl against my barbarity and cruelty, I will\r\nanswer that war is war, and not popularity-seeking.  If they want\r\npeace, they and their relatives most stop the war.\r\n\r\nI knew, of course, that such a measure would be strongly\r\ncriticised, but made up my mind to do it with the absolute\r\ncertainty of its justness, and that time would sanction its wisdom.\r\nI knew that the people of the South would read in this measure two\r\nimportant conclusions: one, that we were in earnest; and the other,\r\nif they were sincere in their common and popular clamor \"to die in\r\nthe last ditch,\" that the opportunity would soon come.\r\n\r\nSoon after our reaching Atlanta, General Hood had sent in by a flag\r\nof truce a proposition, offering a general exchange of prisoners,\r\nsaying that he was authorized to make such an exchange by the\r\nRichmond authorities, out of the vast number of our men then held\r\ncaptive at Andersonville, the same whom General Stoneman had hoped\r\nto rescue at the time of his raid.  Some of these prisoners had\r\nalready escaped and got in, had described the pitiable condition of\r\nthe remainder, and, although I felt a sympathy for their hardships\r\nand sufferings as deeply as any man could, yet as nearly all the\r\nprisoners who had been captured by us during the campaign had been\r\nsent, as fast as taken, to the usual depots North, they were then\r\nbeyond my control.  There were still about two thousand, mostly\r\ncaptured at Jonesboro, who had been sent back by cars, but had not\r\npassed Chattanooga.  These I ordered back, and offered General Hood\r\nto exchange them for Stoneman, Buell, and such of my own army as\r\nwould make up the equivalent; but I would not exchange for his\r\nprisoners generally, because I knew these would have to be sent to\r\ntheir own regiments, away from my army, whereas all we could give\r\nhim could at once be put to duty in his immediate army.  Quite an\r\nangry correspondence grew up between us, which was published at the\r\ntime in the newspapers, but it is not to be found in any book of\r\nwhich I have present knowledge, and therefore is given here, as\r\nillustrative of the events referred to, and of the feelings of the\r\nactors in the game of war at that particular crisis, together with\r\ncertain other original letters of Generals Grant and Halleck, never\r\nhitherto published.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, September 12, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I send Lieutenant-Colonel Horace Porter, of my staff, with\r\nthis.  Colonel Porter will explain to you the exact condition of\r\naffairs here, better than I can do in the limits of a letter.\r\nAlthough I feel myself strong enough now for offensive operations,\r\nI am holding on quietly, to get advantage of recruits and\r\nconvalescents, who are coming forward very rapidly.  My lines are\r\nnecessarily very long, extending from Deep Bottom, north of the\r\nJames, across the peninsula formed by the Appomattox and the James,\r\nand south of the Appomattox to the Weldon road.  This line is very\r\nstrongly fortified, and can be held with comparatively few men;\r\nbut, from its great length, necessarily takes many in the\r\naggregate.  I propose, when I do move, to extend my left so as to\r\ncontrol what is known as the Southside, or Lynchburg & Petersburg\r\nroad; then, if possible, to keep the Danville road out.  At the\r\nsame time this move is made, I want to send a force of from six to\r\nten thousand men against Wilmington.  The way I propose to do this\r\nis to land the men north of Fort Fisher, and hold that point.  At\r\nthe same time a large naval fleet will be assembled there, and the\r\niron-clads will run the batteries as they did at Mobile.  This will\r\ngive us the same control of the harbor of Wilmington that we now\r\nhave of the harbor of Mobile.  What you are to do with the forces\r\nat your command, I do not exactly see.  The difficulties of\r\nsupplying your army, except when they are constantly moving beyond\r\nwhere you are, I plainly see.  If it had not been for Price's\r\nmovement, Canby could have sent twelve thousand more men to Mobile.\r\nFrom your command on the Mississippi, an equal number could have\r\nbeen taken.  With these forces, my idea would have been to divide\r\nthem, sending one-half to Mobile, and the other half to Savannah.\r\nYou could then move as proposed in your telegram, so as to threaten\r\nMacon and Augusta equally.  Whichever one should be abandoned by\r\nthe enemy, you could take and open up a new base of supplies.  My\r\nobject now in sending a staff-officer to you is not so much to\r\nsuggest operations for you as to get your views, and to have plans\r\nmatured by the time every thing can be got ready.  It would\r\nprobably be the 5th of October before any of the plans here\r\nindicated will be executed.  If you have any promotions to\r\nrecommend, send the names forward, and I will approve them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is hardly necessary for me to say that I feel you\r\nhave accomplished the most gigantic undertaking given to any\r\ngeneral in this war, and with a skill and ability that will be\r\nacknowledged in history as unsurpassed, if not unequaled.  It gives\r\nme as much pleasure to record this in your favor as it world in\r\nfavor of any living man, myself included.\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, Commander-in-Chief, City Point,\r\nVirgina.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge, at the hands of\r\nLieutenant  Colonel Porter, of your staff, your letter of September\r\n12th, and accept with thanks the honorable and kindly mention\r\nof the services of this army in the great cause in which we are all\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nI send by Colonel Porter all official reports which are completed,\r\nand will in a few days submit a list of names which are deemed\r\nworthy of promotion.\r\n\r\nI think we owe it to the President to save him the invidious task\r\nof selection among the vast number of worthy applicants, and have\r\nordered my army commanders to prepare their lists with great care,\r\nand to express their preferences, based upon claims of actual\r\ncapacity and services rendered.\r\n\r\nThese I will consolidate, and submit in such a form that, if\r\nmistakes are made, they will at least be sanctioned by the best\r\ncontemporaneous evidence of merit, for I know that vacancies do not\r\nexist equal in number to that of the officers who really deserve\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nAs to the future, I am pleased to know that your army is being\r\nsteadily reinforced by a good class of men, and I hope it will go\r\non until you have a force that is numerically double that of your\r\nantagonist, so that with one part you can watch him, and with the\r\nother push out boldly from your left flank, occupy the Southside\r\nRailroad, compel him to attack you in position, or accept battle on\r\nyour own terms.\r\n\r\nWe ought to ask our country for the largest possible armies that\r\ncan be raised, as so important a thing as the self-existence of a\r\ngreat nation should not be left to the fickle chances of war.\r\n\r\nNow that Mobile is shut out to the commerce of our enemy, it calls\r\nfor no further effort on our part, unless the capture of the city\r\ncan be followed by the occupation of the Alabama River and the\r\nrailroad to Columbus, Georgia, when that place would be a\r\nmagnificent auxiliary to my further progress into Georgia; but,\r\nuntil General Canby is much reinforced, and until he can more\r\nthoroughly subdue the scattered armies west of the Mississippi, I\r\nsuppose that much cannot be attempted by him against the Alabama\r\nRiver and Columbus, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe utter destruction of Wilmington, North Carolina, is of\r\nimportance only in connection with the necessity of cutting off all\r\nforeign trade to our enemy, and if Admiral Farragut can get across\r\nthe bar, and move quickly, I suppose he will succeed.  From my\r\nknowledge of the mouth of Cape Fear River, I anticipate more\r\ndifficulty in getting the heavy ships across the bar than in\r\nreaching the town of Wilmington; but, of course, the soundings of\r\nthe channel are well known at Washington, as well as the draught of\r\nhis iron-clads, so that it must be demonstrated to be feasible, or\r\nelse it would not be attempted.  If successful, I suppose that Fort\r\nCaswell will be occupied, and the fleet at once sent to the\r\nSavannah River.  Then the reduction of that city is the next\r\nquestion.  It once in our possession, and the river open to us, I\r\nwould not hesitate to cross the State of Georgia with sixty\r\nthousand men, hauling some stores, and depending on the country for\r\nthe balance.  Where a million of people find subsistence, my army\r\nwon't starve; but, as you know, in a country like Georgia, with few\r\nroads and innumerable streams, an inferior force can so delay an\r\narmy and harass it, that it would not be a formidable object; but\r\nif the enemy knew that we had our boats in the Savannah River I\r\ncould rapidly move to Milledgeville, where there is abundance of\r\ncorn and meat, and could so threaten Macon and Augusta that the\r\nenemy world doubtless give up Macon for Augusta; then I would move\r\nso as to interpose between Augusta and Savannah, and force him to\r\ngive us Augusta, with the only powder-mills and factories remaining\r\nin the South, or let us have the use of the Savannah River.  Either\r\nhorn of the dilemma will be worth a battle.  I would prefer his\r\nholding Augusta (as the probabilities are); for then, with the\r\nSavannah River in our possession, the taking of Augusta would be a\r\nmere matter of time.  This campaign can be made in the winter.\r\n\r\nBut the more I study the game, the more am I convinced that it\r\nwould be wrong for us to penetrate farther into Georgia without an\r\nobjective beyond.  It would not be productive of much good.  I can\r\nstart east and make a circuit south and back, doing vast damage to\r\nthe State, but resulting in no permanent good; and by mere\r\nthreatening to do so, I hold a rod over the Georgians, who are not\r\nover-loyal to the South.  I will therefore give it as my opinion\r\nthat your army and Canby's should be reinforced to the maximum;\r\nthat, after you get Wilmington, you should strike for Savannah and\r\nits river; that General Canby should hold the Mississippi River,\r\nand send a force to take Columbus, Georgia, either by way of the\r\nAlabama or Appalachicola River; that I should keep Hood employed\r\nand put my army in fine order for a march on Augusta, Columbia, and\r\nCharleston; and start as soon as Wilmington is sealed to commerce,\r\nand the city of Savannah is in our possession.\r\n\r\nI think it will be found that the movements of Price and Shelby,\r\nwest of the Mississippi, are mere diversions.  They cannot hope to\r\nenter Missouri except as raiders; and the truth is, that General\r\nRosecrans should be ashamed to take my troops for such a purpose.\r\nIf you will secure Wilmington and the city of Savannah from your\r\ncentre, and let General Canby leave command over the Mississippi\r\nRiver and country west of it, I will send a force to the Alabama\r\nand Appalachicola, provided you give me one hundred thousand of the\r\ndrafted men to fill up my old regiments; and if you will fix a day\r\nto be in Savannah, I will insure our possession of Macon and a\r\npoint on the river below Augusta.  The possession of the Savannah\r\nRiver is more than fatal to the possibility of Southern\r\nindependence.  They may stand the fall of Richmond, but not of all\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nI will have a long talk with Colonel Porter, and tell him every\r\nthing that may occur to me of interest to you.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, know that I admire your dogged perseverance and\r\npluck more than ever.  If you can whip Lee and I can march to the\r\nAtlantic, I think Uncle Abe will give us a twenty days' leave of\r\nabsence to see the young folks.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\nWASHINGTON, September 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. T. SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nMy DEAR GENERAL: Your very interesting letter of the 4th is just\r\nreceived.  Its perusal has given me the greatest pleasure.  I have\r\nnot written before to congratulate you on the capture of Atlanta,\r\nthe objective point of your brilliant campaign, for the reason that\r\nI have been suffering from my annual attack of \"coryza,\" or\r\nhay-cold.  It affects my eyes so much that I can scarcely see to\r\nwrite.  As you suppose, I have watched your movements most\r\nattentively and critically, and I do not hesitate to say that your\r\ncampaign has been the most brilliant of the war.  Its results are\r\nless striking and less complete than those of General Grant at\r\nVicksburg, but then you have had greater difficulties to encounter,\r\na longer line of communications to keep up, and a longer and more\r\ncontinuous strain upon yourself and upon your army.\r\n\r\nYou must have been very considerably annoyed by the State negro\r\nrecruiting-agents.  Your letter was a capital one, and did much\r\ngood.  The law was a ridiculous one; it was opposed by the War\r\nDepartment, but passed through the influence of Eastern\r\nmanufacturers, who hoped to escape the draft in that way.  They\r\nwere making immense fortunes out of the war, and could well afford\r\nto purchase negro recruits, and thus save their employees at home.\r\n\r\nI fully agree with you in regard to the policy of a stringent\r\ndraft; but, unfortunately, political influences are against us, and\r\nI fear it will not amount to much.  Mr. Seward's speech at Auburn,\r\nagain prophesying, for the twentieth time, that the rebellion would\r\nbe crushed in a few months, and saying that there would be no\r\ndraft, as we now had enough soldiers to end the war, etc., has done\r\nmuch harm, in a military point of view.  I have seen enough of\r\npolitics here to last me for life.  You are right in avoiding them.\r\nMcClellan may possibly reach the White House, but he will lose the\r\nrespect of all honest, high-minded patriots, by his affiliation\r\nwith such traitors and Copperheads as B---, V---, W---, S---, & Co.\r\nHe would not stand upon the traitorous Chicago platform, but he had\r\nnot the manliness to oppose it.  A major-general in the United\r\nStates Army, and yet not one word to utter against rebels or the\r\nrebellion!  I had much respect for McClellan before he became a\r\npolitician, but very little after reading his letter accepting the\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nHooker certainly made a mistake in leaving before the capture of\r\nAtlanta.  I understand that, when here, he said that you would\r\nfail; your army was discouraged and dissatisfied, etc., etc.  He is\r\nmost unmeasured in his abuse of me.  I inclose you a specimen of\r\nwhat he publishes in Northern papers, wherever he goes.  They are\r\ndictated by himself and written by W. B.  and such worthies.  The\r\nfunny part of the business is, that I had nothing whatever to do\r\nwith his being relieved on either occasion.  Moreover, I have never\r\nsaid any thing to the President or Secretary of War to injure him\r\nin the slightest degree, and he knows that perfectly well.  His\r\nanimosity arises from another source.  He is aware that I know some\r\nthings about his character and conduct in California, and, fearing\r\nthat I may use that information against him, he seeks to ward off\r\nits effect by making it appear that I am his personal enemy, am\r\njealous of him, etc.  I know of no other reason for his hostility\r\nto me.  He is welcome to abuse me as much as he pleases; I don't\r\nthink it will do him much good, or me much harm.  I know very\r\nlittle of General Howard, but believe him to be a true, honorable\r\nman.  Thomas is also a noble old war-horse.  It is true, as you\r\nsay, that he is slow, but he is always sure.\r\n\r\nI have not seen General Grant since the fall of Atlanta, and do not\r\nknow what instructions he has sent you.  I fear that Canby has not\r\nthe means to do much by way of Mobile.  The military effects of\r\nBanks's disaster are now showing themselves by the threatened\r\noperations of Price & Co. toward Missouri, thus keeping in check\r\nour armies west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nWith many thanks for your kind letter, and wishes for your future\r\nsuccess, yours truly,\r\n\r\nH. W.  HALLECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor General HALLECK, Chief of Staff, Washington D.C.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have the honor herewith to submit copies of a\r\ncorrespondence between General Hood, of the Confederate Army, the\r\nMayor of Atlanta, and myself, touching the removal of the\r\ninhabitants of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the tone which marks some of these letters, I\r\nwill only call your attention to the fact that, after I had\r\nannounced my determination, General Hood took upon himself to\r\nquestion my motives.  I could not tamely submit to such\r\nimpertinence; and I have also seen that, in violation of all\r\nofficial usage, he has published in the Macon newspapers such parts\r\nof the correspondence as suited his purpose.  This could have had\r\nno other object than to create a feeling on the part of the people;\r\nbut if he expects to resort to such artifices, I think I can meet\r\nhim there too.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient for my Government to know that the removal of the\r\ninhabitants has been made with liberality and fairness, that it has\r\nbeen attended with no force, and that no women or children have\r\nsuffered, unless for want of provisions by their natural protectors\r\nand friends.\r\n\r\nMy real reasons for this step were:\r\n\r\nWe want all the houses of Atlanta for military storage and\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nWe want to contract the lines of defense, so as to diminish the\r\ngarrison to the limit necessary to defend its narrow and vital\r\nparts, instead of embracing, as the lines now do, the vast suburbs.\r\nThis contraction of the lines, with the necessary citadels and\r\nredoubts, will make it necessary to destroy the very houses used by\r\nfamilies as residences.\r\n\r\nAtlanta is a fortified town, was stubbornly defended, and fairly\r\ncaptured.  As captors, we have a right to it.\r\n\r\nThe residence here of a poor population would compel us, sooner or\r\nlater, to feed them or to see them starve under our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe residence here of the families of our enemies would be a\r\ntemptation and a means to keep up a correspondence dangerous and\r\nhurtful to our cause; a civil population calls for provost-guards,\r\nand absorbs the attention of officers in listening to everlasting\r\ncomplaints and special grievances that are not military.\r\n\r\nThese are my reasons; and, if satisfactory to the Government of the\r\nUnited States, it makes no difference whether it pleases General\r\nHood and his people or not.  I am, with respect, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral HOOD, commanding Confederate Army.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have deemed it to the interest of the United States that\r\nthe citizens now residing in Atlanta should remove, those who\r\nprefer it to go south, and the rest north.  For the latter I can\r\nprovide food and transportation to points of their election in\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, or farther north.  For the former I can\r\nprovide transportation by cars as far as Rough and Ready, and also\r\nwagons; but, that their removal may be made with as little\r\ndiscomfort as possible, it will be necessary for you to help the\r\nfamilies from Rough and Ready to the care at Lovejoy's.  If you\r\nconsent, I will undertake to remove all the families in Atlanta who\r\nprefer to go south to Rough and Ready, with all their movable\r\neffects, viz., clothing, trunks, reasonable furniture, bedding,\r\netc., with their servants, white and black, with the proviso that\r\nno force shall be used toward the blacks, one way or the other.  If\r\nthey want to go with their masters or mistresses, they may do so;\r\notherwise they will be sent away, unless they be men, when they may\r\nbe employed by our quartermaster.  Atlanta is no place for families\r\nor non-combatants, and I have no desire to send them north if you\r\nwill assist in conveying them south.  If this proposition meets\r\nyour views, I will consent to a truce in the neighborhood of Rough\r\nand Ready, stipulating that any wagons, horses, animals, or persons\r\nsent there for the purposes herein stated, shall in no manner be\r\nharmed or molested; you in your turn agreeing that any care,\r\nwagons, or carriages, persons or animals sent to the same point,\r\nshall not be interfered with.  Each of us might send a guard of,\r\nsay, one hundred men, to maintain order, and limit the truce to,\r\nsay, two days after a certain time appointed.\r\n\r\nI have authorized the mayor to choose two citizens to convey to you\r\nthis letter, with such documents as the mayor may forward in\r\nexplanation, and shall await your reply.  I have the honor to be\r\nyour obedient servant.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding United States Forces in\r\nGeorgia\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your letter of yesterday's date, borne by James M. Ball\r\nand James R. Crew, citizens of Atlanta, is received.  You say\r\ntherein, \"I deem it to be to the interest of the United States that\r\nthe citizens now residing in Atlanta should remove,\" etc.  I do not\r\nconsider that I have any alternative in this matter.  I therefore\r\naccept your proposition to declare a truce of two days, or such\r\ntime as may be necessary to accomplish the purpose mentioned, and\r\nshall render all assistance in my power to expedite the\r\ntransportation of citizens in this direction.  I suggest that a\r\nstaff-officer be appointed by you to superintend the removal from\r\nthe city to Rough and Ready, while I appoint a like officer to\r\ncontrol their removal farther south; that a guard of one hundred\r\nmen be sent by either party as you propose, to maintain order at\r\nthat place, and that the removal begin on Monday next.\r\n\r\nAnd now, sir, permit me to say that the unprecedented measure you\r\npropose transcends, in studied and ingenious cruelty, all acts ever\r\nbefore brought to my attention in the dark history of war.\r\n\r\nIn the name of God and humanity, I protest, believing that you will\r\nfind that you are expelling from their homes and firesides the\r\nwives and children of a brave people.  I am, general, very\r\nrespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. B. HOOD, General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral J. B. HOOD, commanding Army of Tennessee, Confederate Army.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter\r\nof this date, at the hands of Messrs.  Ball and Crew, consenting to\r\nthe arrangements I had proposed to facilitate the removal south of\r\nthe people of Atlanta, who prefer to go in that direction.  I\r\ninclose you a copy of my orders, which will, I am satisfied,\r\naccomplish my purpose perfectly.\r\n\r\nYou style the measures proposed \"unprecedented,\" and appeal to the\r\ndark history of war for a parallel, as an act of \"studied and\r\ningenious cruelty.\"  It is not unprecedented; for General Johnston\r\nhimself very wisely and properly removed the families all the way\r\nfrom Dalton down, and I see no reason why Atlanta should be\r\nexcepted.  Nor is it necessary to appeal to the dark history of\r\nwar, when recent and modern examples are so handy.  You yourself\r\nburned dwelling-houses along your parapet, and I have seen to-day\r\nfifty houses that you have rendered uninhabitable because they\r\nstood in the way of your forts and men.  You defended Atlanta on a\r\nline so close to town that every cannon-shot and many musket-shots\r\nfrom our line of investment, that overshot their mark, went into\r\nthe habitations of women and children.  General Hardee did the same\r\nat Jonesboro, and General Johnston did the same, last summer, at\r\nJackson, Mississippi.  I have not accused you of heartless cruelty,\r\nbut merely instance these cases of very recent occurrence, and\r\ncould go on and enumerate hundreds of others, and challenge any\r\nfair man to judge which of us has the heart of pity for the\r\nfamilies of a \"brave people.\"\r\n\r\nI say that it is kindness to these families of Atlanta to remove\r\nthem now, at once, from scenes that women and children should not\r\nbe exposed to, and the \"brave people\" should scorn to commit their\r\nwives and children to the rude barbarians who thus, as you say,\r\nviolate the laws of war, as illustrated in the pages of its dark\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn the name of common-sense, I ask you not to appeal to a just God\r\nin such a sacrilegious manner.  You who, in the midst of peace and\r\nprosperity, have plunged a nation into war--dark and cruel war--who\r\ndared and badgered us to battle, insulted our flag, seized our\r\narsenals and forts that were left in the honorable custody of\r\npeaceful ordnance-sergeants, seized and made \"prisoners of war\" the\r\nvery garrisons sent to protect your people against negroes and\r\nIndians, long before any overt act was committed by the (to you)\r\nhated Lincoln Government; tried to force Kentucky and Missouri into\r\nrebellion, spite of themselves; falsified the vote of Louisiana;\r\nturned loose your privateers to plunder unarmed ships; expelled\r\nUnion families by the thousands, burned their houses, and declared,\r\nby an act of your Congress, the confiscation of all debts due\r\nNorthern men for goods had and received!  Talk thus to the marines,\r\nbut not to me, who have seen these things, and who will this day\r\nmake as much sacrifice for the peace and honor of the South as the\r\nbest-born Southerner among you! If we must be enemies, let us be\r\nmen, and fight it out as we propose to do, and not deal in arch\r\nhypocritical appeals to God and humanity.  God will judge us in due\r\ntime, and he will pronounce whether it be more humane to fight with\r\na town full of women and the families of a brave people at our back\r\nor to remove them in time to places of safety among their own\r\nfriends and people.\r\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE\r\nSeptember 12, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T, SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter\r\nof the 9th inst., with its inclosure in reference to the women,\r\nchildren, and others, whom you have thought proper to expel from\r\ntheir homes in the city of Atlanta.  Had you seen proper to let the\r\nmatter rest there, I would gladly have allowed your letter to close\r\nthis correspondence, and, without your expressing it in words,\r\nwould have been willing to believe that, while \"the interests of\r\nthe United States,\" in your opinion, compelled you to an act of\r\nbarbarous cruelty, you regretted the necessity, and we would have\r\ndropped the subject; but you have chosen to indulge in statements\r\nwhich I feel compelled to notice, at least so far as to signify my\r\ndissent, and not allow silence in regard to them to be construed as\r\nacquiescence.\r\n\r\nI see nothing in your communication which induces me to modify the\r\nlanguage of condemnation with which I characterized your order.  It\r\nbut strengthens me in the opinion that it stands \"preeminent in the\r\ndark history of war for studied and ingenious cruelty.\"  Your\r\noriginal order was stripped of all pretenses; you announced the\r\nedict for the sole reason that it was \"to the interest of the\r\nUnited States.\"  This alone you offered to us and the civilized\r\nworld as an all-sufficient reason for disregarding the laws of God\r\nand man.  You say that \"General Johnston himself very wisely and\r\nproperly removed the families all the way from Dalton down.\"  It is\r\ndue to that gallant soldier and gentleman to say that no act of his\r\ndistinguished career gives the least color to your unfounded\r\naspersions upon his conduct.  He depopulated no villages, nor\r\ntowns, nor cities, either friendly or hostile.  He offered and\r\nextended friendly aid to his unfortunate fellow-citizens who\r\ndesired to flee from your fraternal embraces.  You are equally\r\nunfortunate in your attempt to find a justification for this act of\r\ncruelty, either in the defense of Jonesboro, by General Hardee, or\r\nof Atlanta, by myself.  General Hardee defended his position in\r\nfront of Jonesboro at the expense of injury to the houses; an\r\nordinary, proper, and justifiable act of war.  I defended Atlanta\r\nat the same risk and cost. If there was any fault in either case,\r\nit was your own, in not giving notice, especially in the case of\r\nAtlanta, of your purpose to shell the town, which is usual in war\r\namong civilized nations.  No inhabitant was expelled from his home\r\nand fireside by the orders of General Hardee or myself, and\r\ntherefore your recent order can find no support from the conduct of\r\neither of us.  I feel no other emotion other than pain in reading\r\nthat portion of your letter which attempts to justify your shelling\r\nAtlanta without notice under pretense that I defended Atlanta upon\r\na line so close to town that every cannon-shot and many\r\nmusket-balls from your line of investment, that overshot their mark,\r\nwent into the habitations of women and children.  I made no complaint\r\nof your firing into Atlanta in any way you thought proper.  I make\r\nnone now, but there are a hundred thousand witnesses that you fired\r\ninto the habitations of women and children for weeks, firing far\r\nabove and miles beyond my line of defense.  I have too good an\r\nopinion, founded both upon observation and experience, of the skill\r\nof your artillerists, to credit the insinuation that they for several\r\nweeks unintentionally fired too high for my modest field-works, and\r\nslaughtered women and children by accident and want of skill.\r\n\r\nThe residue of your letter is rather discussion.  It opens a wide\r\nfield for the discussion of questions which I do not feel are\r\ncommitted to me.  I am only a general of one of the armies of the\r\nConfederate States, charged with military operations in the field,\r\nunder the direction of my superior officers, and I am not called\r\nupon to discuss with you the causes of the present war, or the\r\npolitical questions which led to or resulted from it.  These grave\r\nand important questions have been committed to far abler hands than\r\nmine, and I shall only refer to them so far as to repel any unjust\r\nconclusion which might be drawn from my silence.  You charge my\r\ncountry with \"daring and badgering you to battle.\"  The truth is,\r\nwe sent commissioners to you, respectfully offering a peaceful\r\nseparation, before the first gun was fired on either aide.  You say\r\nwe insulted your flag.  The truth is, we fired upon it, and those\r\nwho fought under it, when you came to our doors upon the mission of\r\nsubjugation.  You say we seized upon your forts and arsenals, and\r\nmade prisoners of the garrisons sent to protect us against negroes\r\nand Indians.  The truth is, we, by force of arms, drove out\r\ninsolent intruders and took possession of our own forts and\r\narsenals, to resist your claims to dominion over masters, slaves,\r\nand Indians, all of whom are to this day, with a unanimity\r\nunexampled in the history of the world, warring against your\r\nattempts to become their masters.  You say that we tried to force\r\nMissouri and Kentucky into rebellion in spite of themselves.  The\r\ntruth is, my Government, from the beginning of this struggle to\r\nthis hour, has again and again offered, before the whole world, to\r\nleave it to the unbiased will of these States, and all others, to\r\ndetermine for themselves whether they will cast their destiny with\r\nyour Government or ours; and your Government has resisted this\r\nfundamental principle of free institutions with the bayonet, and\r\nlabors daily, by force and fraud, to fasten its hateful tyranny\r\nupon the unfortunate freemen of these States.  You say we falsified\r\nthe vote of Louisiana.  The truth is, Louisiana not only separated\r\nherself from your Government by nearly a unanimous vote of her\r\npeople, but has vindicated the act upon every battle-field from\r\nGettysburg to the Sabine, and has exhibited an heroic devotion to\r\nher decision which challenges the admiration and respect of every\r\nman capable of feeling sympathy for the oppressed or admiration for\r\nheroic valor.  You say that we turned loose pirates to plunder your\r\nunarmed ships.  The truth is, when you robbed us of our part of the\r\nnavy, we built and bought a few vessels, hoisted the flag of our\r\ncountry, and swept the seas, in defiance of your navy, around the\r\nwhole circumference of the globe.  You say we have expelled Union\r\nfamilies by thousands.  The truth is, not a single family has been\r\nexpelled from the Confederate States, that I am aware of; but, on\r\nthe contrary, the moderation of our Government toward traitors has\r\nbeen a fruitful theme of denunciation by its enemies and\r\nwell-meaning friends of our cause.  You say my Government, by acts\r\nof Congress, has confiscated \"all debts due Northern men for goods\r\nsold and delivered.\"  The truth is, our Congress gave due and ample\r\ntime to your merchants and traders to depart from our shores with\r\ntheir ships, goods, and effects, and only sequestrated the property\r\nof our enemies in retaliation for their acts--declaring us\r\ntraitors, and confiscating our property wherever their power\r\nextended, either in their country or our own.  Such are your\r\naccusations, and such are the facts known of all men to be true.\r\n\r\nYou order into exile the whole population of a city; drive men,\r\nwomen and children from their homes at the point of the bayonet,\r\nunder the plea that it is to the interest of your Government, and\r\non the claim that it is \"an act of kindness to these families of\r\nAtlanta.\"  Butler only banished from New Orleans the registered\r\nenemies of his Government, and acknowledged that he did it as a\r\npunishment.  You issue a sweeping edict, covering all the\r\ninhabitants of a city, and add insult to the injury heaped upon the\r\ndefenseless by assuming that you have done them a kindness.  This\r\nyou follow by the assertion that you will \"make as much sacrifice\r\nfor the peace and honor of the South as the best-born Southerner.\"\r\nAnd, because I characterize what you call as kindness as being real\r\ncruelty, you presume to sit in judgment between me and my God; and\r\nyou decide that my earnest prayer to the Almighty Father to save\r\nour women and children from what you call kindness, is a\r\n\"sacrilegious, hypocritical appeal.\"\r\n\r\nYou came into our country with your army, avowedly for the purpose\r\nof subjugating free white men, women, and children, and not only\r\nintend to rule over them, but you make negroes your allies, and\r\ndesire to place over us an inferior race, which we have raised from\r\nbarbarism to its present position, which is the highest ever\r\nattained by that race, in any country, in all time.  I must,\r\ntherefore, decline to accept your statements in reference to your\r\nkindness toward the people of Atlanta, and your willingness to\r\nsacrifice every thing for the peace and honor of the South, and\r\nrefuse to be governed by your decision in regard to matters between\r\nmyself, my country, and my God.\r\n\r\nYou say, \"Let us fight it out like men.\"  To this my reply is--for\r\nmyself, and I believe for all the free men, ay, and women and\r\nchildren, in my country--we will fight you to the death!  Better\r\ndie a thousand deaths than submit to live under you or your\r\nGovernment and your negro allies!\r\n\r\nHaving answered the points forced upon me by your letter of the 9th\r\nof September, I close this correspondence with you; and,\r\nnotwithstanding your comments upon my appeal to God in the cause of\r\nhumanity, I again humbly and reverently invoke his almighty aid in\r\ndefense of justice and right. Respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. B. HOOD, General.\r\n\r\n\r\nATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 11, 1864\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nSir: We the undersigned, Mayor and two of the Council for the city\r\nof Atlanta, for the time being the only legal organ of the people\r\nof the said city, to express their wants and wishes, ask leave most\r\nearnestly but respectfully to petition you to reconsider the order\r\nrequiring them to leave Atlanta.\r\n\r\nAt first view, it struck us that the measure world involve\r\nextraordinary hardship and loss, but since we have seen the\r\npractical execution of it so far as it has progressed, and the\r\nindividual condition of the people, and heard their statements as\r\nto the inconveniences, loss, and suffering attending it, we are\r\nsatisfied that the amount of it will involve in the aggregate\r\nconsequences appalling and heart-rending.\r\n\r\nMany poor women are in advanced state of pregnancy, others now\r\nhaving young children, and whose husbands for the greater part are\r\neither in the army, prisoners, or dead.  Some say: \"I have such a\r\none sick at my house; who will wait on them when I am gone?\"\r\nOthers say: \"What are we to do? We have no house to go to, and no\r\nmeans to buy, build, or rent any; no parents, relatives, or\r\nfriends, to go to.\"  Another says: \"I will try and take this or\r\nthat article of property, but such and such things I must leave\r\nbehind, though I need them much.\"  We reply to them: \"General\r\nSherman will carry your property to Rough and Ready, and General\r\nHood will take it thence on.\"  And they will reply to that: \"But I\r\nwant to leave the railroad at such a place, and cannot get\r\nconveyance from there on.\"\r\n\r\nWe only refer to a few facts, to try to illustrate in part how this\r\nmeasure will operate in practice.  As you advanced, the people\r\nnorth of this fell back; and before your arrival here, a large\r\nportion of the people had retired south, so that the country south\r\nof this is already crowded, and without houses enough to\r\naccommodate the people, and we are informed that many are now\r\nstaying in churches and other out-buildings.\r\n\r\nThis being so, how is it possible for the people still here (mostly\r\nwomen and children) to find any shelter?  And how can they live\r\nthrough the winter in the woods--no shelter or subsistence, in the\r\nmidst of strangers who know them not, and without the power to\r\nassist them much, if they were willing to do so?\r\n\r\nThis is but a feeble picture of the consequences of this measure.\r\nYou know the woe, the horrors, and the suffering, cannot be\r\ndescribed by words; imagination can only conceive of it, and we ask\r\nyou to take these things into consideration.\r\n\r\nWe know your mind and time are constantly occupied with the duties\r\nof your command, which almost deters us from asking your attention\r\nto this matter, but thought it might be that you had not considered\r\nthis subject in all of its awful consequences, and that on more\r\nreflection you, we hope, would not make this people an exception to\r\nall mankind, for we know of no such instance ever having occurred\r\n--surely never in the United States--and what has this helpless\r\npeople done, that they should be driven from their homes, to wander\r\nstrangers and outcasts, and exiles, and to subsist on charity?\r\n\r\nWe do not know as yet the number of people still here; of those who\r\nare here, we are satisfied a respectable number, if allowed to\r\nremain at home, could subsist for several months without\r\nassistance, and a respectable number for a much longer time, and\r\nwho might not need assistance at any time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we most earnestly and solemnly petition you to\r\nreconsider this order, or modify it, and suffer this unfortunate\r\npeople to remain at home, and enjoy what little means they have.\r\nRespectfully submitted\r\nJAMES M.  CALHOUN, Mayor.\r\nE.  E.  RAWSON, Councilman.\r\nS.  C.  Warns, Councilman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 12, 1864.\r\n\r\nJAMES M. CALHOUN, Mayor, E. E. RAWSON and S. C. Wares, representing\r\nCity Council of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I have your letter of the 11th, in the nature of a\r\npetition to revoke my orders removing all the inhabitants from\r\nAtlanta.  I have read it carefully, and give full credit to your\r\nstatements of the distress that will be occasioned, and yet shall\r\nnot revoke my orders, because they were not designed to meet the\r\nhumanities of the case, but to prepare for the future struggles in\r\nwhich millions of good people outside of Atlanta have a deep\r\ninterest. We must have peace, not only at Atlanta, but in all\r\nAmerica.  To secure this, we must stop the war that now desolates\r\nour once happy and favored country.  To stop war, we must defeat\r\nthe rebel armies which are arrayed against the laws and\r\nConstitution that all must respect and obey.  To defeat those\r\narmies, we must prepare the way to reach them in their recesses,\r\nprovided with the arms and instruments which enable us to\r\naccomplish our purpose.  Now, I know the vindictive nature of our\r\nenemy, that we may have many years of military operations from this\r\nquarter; and, therefore, deem it wise and prudent to prepare in\r\ntime.  The use of Atlanta for warlike purposes is inconsistent with\r\nits character as a home for families.  There will be no\r\nmanufactures, commerce, or agriculture here, for the maintenance of\r\nfamilies, and sooner or later want will compel the inhabitants to\r\ngo.  Why not go now, when all the arrangements are completed for\r\nthe transfer,--instead of waiting till the plunging shot of\r\ncontending armies will renew the scenes of the past months.  Of\r\ncourse, I do not apprehend any such thing at this moment, but you\r\ndo not suppose this army will be here until the war is over.  I\r\ncannot discuss this subject with you fairly, because I cannot\r\nimpart to you what we propose to do, but I assert that our military\r\nplans make it necessary for the inhabitants to go away, and I can\r\nonly renew my offer of services to make their exodus in any\r\ndirection as easy and comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\nYou cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will.  War is\r\ncruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into\r\nour country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can\r\npour out.  I know I had no hand in making this war, and I know I\r\nwill make more sacrifices to-day than any of you to secure peace.\r\nBut you cannot have peace and a division of our country.  If the\r\nUnited States submits to a division now, it will not stop, but will\r\ngo on until we reap the fate of Mexico, which is eternal war.  The\r\nUnited States does and must assert its authority, wherever it once\r\nhad power; for, if it relaxes one bit to pressure, it is gone, and\r\nI believe that such is the national feeling.  This feeling assumes\r\nvarious shapes, but always comes back to that of Union.  Once admit\r\nthe Union, once more acknowledge the authority of the national\r\nGovernment, and, instead of devoting your houses and streets and\r\nroads to the dread uses of war, I and this army become at once your\r\nprotectors and supporters, shielding you from danger, let it come\r\nfrom what quarter it may.  I know that a few individuals cannot\r\nresist a torrent of error and passion, such as swept the South into\r\nrebellion, but you can point out, so that we may know those who\r\ndesire a government, and those who insist on war and its\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nYou might as well appeal against the thunder-storm as against these\r\nterrible hardships of war.  They are inevitable, and the only way\r\nthe people of Atlanta can hope once more to live in peace and quiet\r\nat home, is to stop the war, which can only be done by admitting\r\nthat it began in error and is perpetuated in pride.\r\n\r\nWe don't want your negroes, or your horses, or your houses, or your\r\nlands, or any thing you have, but we do want and will have a just\r\nobedience to the laws of the United States.  That we will have,\r\nand, if it involves the destruction of your improvements, we cannot\r\nhelp it.\r\n\r\nYou have heretofore read public sentiment in your newspapers, that\r\nlive by falsehood and excitement; and the quicker you seek for\r\ntruth in other quarters, the better.  I repeat then that, by the\r\noriginal compact of Government, the United States had certain\r\nrights in Georgia, which have never been relinquished and never\r\nwill be; that the South began war by seizing forts, arsenals,\r\nmints, custom-houses, etc., etc., long before Mr. Lincoln was\r\ninstalled, and before the South had one jot or tittle of\r\nprovocation.  I myself have seen in Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nand Mississippi, hundreds and thousands of women and children\r\nfleeing from your armies and desperadoes, hungry and with bleeding\r\nfeet.  In Memphis, Vicksburg, and Mississippi, we fed thousands\r\nupon thousands of the families of rebel soldiers left on our hands,\r\nand whom we could not see starve.  Now that war comes home to you;\r\nyou feel very different.  You deprecate its horrors, but did not\r\nfeel them when you sent car-loads of soldiers and ammunition, and\r\nmoulded shells and shot, to carry war into Kentucky and Tennessee,\r\nto desolate the homes of hundreds and thousands of good people who\r\nonly asked to live in peace at their old homes, and under the\r\nGovernment of their inheritance.  But these comparisons are idle.\r\nI want peace, and believe it can only be reached through union and\r\nwar, and I will ever conduct war with a view to perfect and early\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBut, my dear sirs, when peace does come, you may call on me for any\r\nthing.  Then will I share with you the last cracker, and watch with\r\nyou to shield your homes and families against danger from every\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nNow you must go, and take with you the old and feeble, feed and\r\nnurse them, and build for them, in more quiet places, proper\r\nhabitations to shield them against the weather until the mad\r\npassions of men cool down, and allow the Union and peace once more\r\nto settle over your old homes at Atlanta.  Yours in haste,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral J. B. HOOD, commanding Army of the Tennessee, Confederate\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Yours of September 12th is received, and has been\r\ncarefully perused.  I agree with you that this discussion by two\r\nsoldiers is out of place, and profitless; but you must admit that\r\nyou began the controversy by characterizing an official act of mine\r\nin unfair and improper terms.  I reiterate my former answer, and to\r\nthe only new matter contained in your rejoinder add: We have no\r\n\"negro allies\" in this army; not a single negro soldier left\r\nChattanooga with this army, or is with it now.  There are a few\r\nguarding Chattanooga, which General Steedman sent at one time to\r\ndrive Wheeler out of Dalton.\r\n\r\nI was not bound by the laws of war to give notice of the shelling\r\nof Atlanta, a \"fortified town, with magazines, arsenals,\r\nfounderies, and public stores;\" you were bound to take notice.  See\r\nthe books.\r\n\r\nThis is the conclusion of our correspondence, which I did not\r\nbegin, and terminate with satisfaction.  I am, with respect, your\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, September 28, 1864,\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your communications of the 20th in regard to the removal\r\nof families from Atlanta, and the exchange of prisoners, and also\r\nthe official report of your campaign, are just received.  I have\r\nnot had time as yet to examine your report.  The course which you\r\nhave pursued in removing rebel families from Atlanta, and in the\r\nexchange of prisoners, is fully approved by the War Department.\r\nNot only are you justified by the laws and usages of war in\r\nremoving these people, but I think it was your duty to your own\r\narmy to do so.  Moreover, I am fully of opinion that the nature of\r\nyour position, the character of the war, the conduct of the enemy\r\n(and especially of non-combatants and women of the territory which\r\nwe have heretofore conquered and occupied), will justify you in\r\ngathering up all the forage and provisions which your army may\r\nrequire, both for a siege of Atlanta and for your supply in your\r\nmarch farther into the enemy's country.  Let the disloyal families\r\nof the country, thus stripped, go to their husbands, fathers, and\r\nnatural protectors, in the rebel ranks; we have tried three years\r\nof conciliation and kindness without any reciprocation; on the\r\ncontrary, those thus treated have acted as spies and guerrillas in\r\nour rear and within our lines.  The safety of our armies, and a\r\nproper regard for the lives of our soldiers, require that we apply\r\nto our inexorable foes the severe rules of war.  We certainly are\r\nnot required to treat the so-called non-combatant rebels better\r\nthan they themselves treat each other.  Even herein Virginia,\r\nwithin fifty miles of Washington, they strip their own families of\r\nprovisions, leaving them, as our army advances, to be fed by us, or\r\nto starve within our lines.  We have fed this class of people long\r\nenough.  Let them go with their husbands and fathers in the rebel\r\nranks; and if they won't go, we must send them to their friends and\r\nnatural protectors.  I would destroy every mill and factory within\r\nreach which I did not want for my own use.  This the rebels have\r\ndone, not only in Maryland and Pennsylvania, but also in Virginia\r\nand other rebel States, when compelled to fall back before our\r\narmies.  In many sections of the country they have not left a mill\r\nto grind grain for their own suffering families, lest we might use\r\nthem to supply our armies.  We most do the same.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to impress these views upon our commanders for\r\nthe last two years.  You are almost the only one who has properly\r\napplied them.  I do not approve of General Hunter's course in\r\nburning private homes or uselessly destroying private property.\r\nThat is barbarous.  But I approve of taking or destroying whatever\r\nmay serve as supplies to us or to the enemy's army.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief of Staff\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to effect the exchange of prisoners, to facilitate the\r\nexodus of the people of Atlanta, and to keep open communication\r\nwith the South, we established a neutral camp, at and about the\r\nrailroad-station next south of Atlanta, known as \"Rough and Ready,\"\r\nto which point I dispatched Lieutenant-Colonel Willard Warner, of\r\nmy staff, with a guard of one hundred men, and General Hood sent\r\nColonel Clare, of his staff, with a similar guard; these officers\r\nand men harmonized perfectly, and parted good friends when their\r\nwork was done.  In the mean time I also had reconnoitred the entire\r\nrebel lines about Atlanta, which were well built, but were entirely\r\ntoo extensive to be held by a single corps or division of troops,\r\nso I instructed Colonel Poe, United States Engineers, on my staff,\r\nto lay off an inner and shorter line, susceptible of defense by a\r\nsmaller garrison.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of September all these matters were in progress, the\r\nreports of the past campaign were written up and dispatched to\r\nWashington, and our thoughts began to turn toward the future.\r\nAdmiral Farragut had boldly and successfully run the forts at the\r\nentrance to Mobile Bay, which resulted in the capture of Fort\r\nMorgan, so that General Canby was enabled to begin his regular\r\noperations against Mobile City, with a view to open the Alabama\r\nRiver to navigation.  My first thoughts were to concert operations\r\nwith him, either by way of Montgomery, Alabama, or by the\r\nAppalachicula; but so long a line, to be used as a base for further\r\noperations eastward, was not advisable, and I concluded to await\r\nthe initiative of the enemy, supposing that he would be forced to\r\nresort to some desperate campaign by the clamor raised at the South\r\non account of the great loss to them of the city of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas occupied a house on Marietta Streets which had a\r\nveranda with high pillars.  We were sitting there one evening,\r\ntalking about things generally, when General Thomas asked leave to\r\nsend his trains back to Chattanooga, for the convenience and\r\neconomy of forage.  I inquired of him if he supposed we would be\r\nallowed much rest at Atlanta, and he said he thought we would, or\r\nthat at all events it would not be prudent for us to go much\r\nfarther into Georgia because of our already long line of\r\ncommunication, viz., three hundred miles from Nashville.  This was\r\ntrue; but there we were, and we could not afford to remain on the\r\ndefensive, simply holding Atlanta and fighting for the safety of\r\nits railroad.  I insisted on his retaining all trains, and on\r\nkeeping all his divisions ready to move at a moment's warning.  All\r\nthe army, officers and men, seemed to relax more or less, and sink\r\ninto a condition of idleness.  General Schofield was permitted to\r\ngo to Knoxville, to look after matters in his Department of the\r\nOhio; and Generals Blair and Logan went home to look after\r\npolitics.  Many of the regiments were entitled to, and claimed,\r\ntheir discharge, by reason of the expiration of their term of\r\nservice; so that with victory and success came also many causes of\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\nThe rebel General Wheeler was still in Middle Tennessee,\r\nthreatening our railroads, and rumors came that Forrest was on his\r\nway from Mississippi to the same theatre, for the avowed purpose of\r\nbreaking up our railroads and compelling us to fall back from our\r\nconquest. To prepare for this, or any other emergency, I ordered\r\nNewton's division of the Fourth Corps back to Chattanooga, and\r\nCorse's division of the Seventeenth Corps to Rome, and instructed\r\nGeneral Rousseau at Nashville, Granger at Decatur, and Steadman at\r\nChattanooga, to adopt the most active measures to protect and\r\ninsure the safety of our roads.\r\n\r\nHood still remained about Lovejoy's Station, and, up to the 15th of\r\nSeptember, had given no signs of his future plans; so that with\r\nthis date I close the campaign of Atlanta, with the following\r\nreview of our relative losses during the months of August and\r\nSeptember, with a summary of those for the whole campaign,\r\nbeginning May 6 and ending September 15, 1864.  The losses for\r\nAugust and September are added together, so as to include those\r\nabout Jonesboro:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Killed and Missing    Wounded    Total\r\n        Grand Aggregate..... 1,408             3,731    5,139\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHood's losses, as reported for the same period, page 577,\r\nJohnston's \"Narrative:\"\r\n\r\n                         Killed             Wounded     Total\r\n                           482               3,223      3,705\r\n\r\nTo which should be added:\r\n\r\n       Prisoners captured by us:............ 3,738\r\n\r\n       Giving his total loss ............... 7,440\r\n\r\n\r\nOn recapitulating the entire losses of each army during the entire\r\ncampaign, from May to September, inclusive, we have, in the Union\r\narmy, as per table appended:\r\n\r\nKilled ........................  4,423\r\nWounded ....................... 22,822\r\nMissing........................  4,442\r\n       Aggregate Loss ......... 31,627\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Southern army, according to the reports of Surgeon Foard\r\n(pp.  576, 577, Johnston's \"Narrative \")\r\n\r\n        Total killed ................  3,044\r\n        Total killed and wounded..... 21,996\r\n        Prisoners captured by us .... 12,983\r\n\r\n        Aggregate loss to the\r\n             Southern Army .......... 34,979\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing figures are official, and are very nearly correct.  I\r\nsee no room for error save in the cavalry, which was very much\r\nscattered, and whose reports are much less reliable than of the\r\ninfantry and artillery; but as Surgeon Foard's tables do not\r\nembrace Wheeler's, Jackson's, and Martin's divisions of cavalry, I\r\ninfer that the comparison, as to cavalry losses, is a \"stand-off.\"\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the Southern officers flattered themselves\r\nthat they had filled and crippled of us two and even six to one, as\r\nstated by Johnston; but they were simply mistaken, and I herewith\r\nsubmit official tabular statements made up from the archives of the\r\nWar Department, in proof thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also had a careful tabular statement compiled from official\r\nrecords in the adjutant-general's office, giving the \"effective\r\nstrength\" of the army under my command for each of the months of\r\nMay, June, July, August, and September, 1864, which enumerate every\r\nman (infantry, artillery, and cavalry) for duty.  The\r\nrecapitulation clearly exhibits the actual truth.  We opened the\r\ncampaign with 98,797 (ninety-eight thousand seven hundred and\r\nninety-seven) men.  Blair's two divisions joined us early in June,\r\ngiving 112,819 (one hundred and twelve thousand eight hundred and\r\nnineteen), which number gradually became reduced to 106,070 (one\r\nhundred and six thousand and seventy men), 91,675 (ninety-one\r\nthousand six hundred and seventy-five), and 81,758 (eighty-one\r\nthousand seven hundred and fifty-eight) at the end of the campaign.\r\nThis gradual reduction was not altogether owing to death and\r\nwounds, but to the expiration of service, or by detachments sent to\r\npoints at the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nATLANTA AND AFTER--PURSUIT OF HOOD.\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of September, matters and things had settled down in\r\nAtlanta, so that we felt perfectly at home.  The telegraph and\r\nrailroads were repaired, and we had uninterrupted communication to\r\nthe rear.  The trains arrived with regularity and dispatch, and\r\nbrought us ample supplies.  General Wheeler had been driven out of\r\nMiddle Tennessee, escaping south across the Tennessee River at\r\nBainbridge; and things looked as though we were to have a period of\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nOne day, two citizens, Messrs. Hill and Foster, came into our lines\r\nat Decatur, and were sent to my headquarters.  They represented\r\nthemselves as former members of Congress, and particular friends of\r\nmy brother John Sherman; that Mr. Hill had a son killed in the\r\nrebel army as it fell back before us somewhere near Cassville, and\r\nthey wanted to obtain the body, having learned from a comrade where\r\nit was buried.  I gave them permission to go by rail to the rear,\r\nwith a note to the commanding officer, General John E. Smith, at\r\nCartersville, requiring him to furnish them an escort and an\r\nambulance for the purpose.  I invited them to take dinner with our\r\nmess, and we naturally ran into a general conversation about\r\npolitics and the devastation and ruin caused by the war.  They had\r\nseen a part of the country over which the army had passed, and\r\ncould easily apply its measure of desolation to the remainder of\r\nthe State, if necessity should compel us to go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. Hill resided at Madison, on the main road to Augusta, and\r\nseemed to realize fully the danger; said that further resistance on\r\nthe part of the South was madness, that he hoped Governor Brown, of\r\nGeorgia, would so proclaim it, and withdraw his people from the\r\nrebellion, in pursuance of what was known as the policy of\r\n\"separate State action.\"  I told him, if he saw Governor Brown, to\r\ndescribe to him fully what he had seen, and to say that if he\r\nremained inert, I would be compelled to go ahead, devastating the\r\nState in its whole length and breadth; that there was no adequate\r\nforce to stop us, etc.; but if he would issue his proclamation\r\nwithdrawing his State troops from the armies of the Confederacy, I\r\nwould spare the State, and in our passage across it confine the\r\ntroops to the main roads, and would, moreover, pay for all the corn\r\nand food we needed.  I also told Mr. Hill that he might, in my\r\nname, invite Governor Brown to visit Atlanta; that I would give him\r\na safeguard, and that if he wanted to make a speech, I would\r\nguarantee him as full and respectable an audience as any he had\r\never spoken to.  I believe that Mr. Hill, after reaching his home\r\nat Madison, went to Milledgeville, the capital of the State, and\r\ndelivered the message to Governor Brown.  I had also sent similar\r\nmessages by Judge Wright of Rome, Georgia, and by Mr. King, of\r\nMarietta.  On the 15th of September I telegraphed to General\r\nHalleck as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nMy report is done, and will be forwarded as soon as I get in a few\r\nmore of the subordinate reports.  I am awaiting a courier from\r\nGeneral Grant.  All well; the troops are in good, healthy camps,\r\nand supplies are coming forward finely.  Governor Brown has\r\ndisbanded his militia, to gather the corn and sorghum of the State.\r\nI have reason to believe that he and Stephens want to visit me, and\r\nhave sent them hearty invitation.  I will exchange two thousand\r\nprisoners with Hood, but no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Brown's action at that time is fully explained by the\r\nfollowing letter, since made public, which was then only known to\r\nus in part by hearsay:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT\r\nMILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA, September 10, 1864\r\n\r\nGeneral J. B. HOOD, commanding army of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: As the militia of the State were called out for the\r\ndefense of Atlanta during the campaign against it, which has\r\nterminated by the fall of the city into the hands of the enemy, and\r\nas many of these left their homes without preparation (expecting to\r\nbe gone but a few weeks), who have remained in service over three\r\nmonths (most of the time in the trenches), justice requires that\r\nthey be permitted, while the enemy are preparing for the winter\r\ncampaign, to return to their homes, and look for a time after\r\nimportant interests, and prepare themselves for such service as may\r\nbe required when another campaign commences against other important\r\npoints in the State.  I therefore hereby withdraw said organization\r\nfrom your command .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nJOSEPH C. BROWN\r\n\r\n\r\nThis militia had composed a division under command of Major-General\r\nGustavus W.  Smith, and were thus dispersed to their homes, to\r\ngather the corn and sorghum, then ripe and ready for the\r\nharvesters.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I received by telegraph from President Lincoln this\r\ndispatch:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 17, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nI feel great interest in the subjects of your dispatch, mentioning\r\ncorn and sorghum, and the contemplated visit to you.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nI replied at once:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nPresident LINCOLN, Washington., D. C.:\r\n\r\nI will keep the department fully advised of all developments\r\nconnected with the subject in which you feel interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wright, former member of Congress from Rome, Georgia, and Mr.\r\nKing, of Marietta, are now going between Governor Brown and myself.\r\nI have said to them that some of the people of Georgia are engaged\r\nin rebellion, began in error and perpetuated in pride, but that\r\nGeorgia can now save herself from the devastations of war preparing\r\nfor her, only by withdrawing her quota out of the Confederate Army,\r\nand aiding me to expel Hood from the borders of the State; in which\r\nevent, instead of desolating the land as we progress, I will keep\r\nour men to the high-roads and commons, and pay for the corn and\r\nmeat we need and take.\r\n\r\nI am fully conscious of the delicate nature of such assertions, but\r\nit would be a magnificent stroke of policy if we could, without\r\nsurrendering principle or a foot of ground, arouse the latent\r\nenmity of Georgia against Davis.\r\n\r\nThe people do not hesitate to say that Mr. Stephens was and is a\r\nUnion man at heart; and they say that Davis will not trust him or\r\nlet him have a share in his Government.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not the least doubt that Governor Brown, at that time,\r\nseriously entertained the proposition; but he hardly felt ready to\r\nact, and simply gave a furlough to the militia, and called a\r\nspecial session of the Legislature, to meet at Milledgeville, to\r\ntake into consideration the critical condition of affairs in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of September Colonel Horace Porter arrived from General\r\nGrant, at City Point, bringing me the letter of September 12th,\r\nasking my general views as to what should next be done.  He staid\r\nseveral days at Atlanta, and on his return carried back to\r\nWashington my full reports of the past campaign, and my letter of\r\nSeptember 20th to General Grant in answer to his of the 12th.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we detected signs of activity on the part of the\r\nenemy.  On the 21st Hood shifted his army across from the Mason\r\nroad, at Lovejoy's, to the West Point road, at Palmetto Station,\r\nand his cavalry appeared on the west side of the Chattahoochee,\r\ntoward Powder Springs; thus, as it were, stepping aside, and\r\nopening wide the door for us to enter Central Georgia.  I inferred,\r\nhowever, that his real purpose was to assume the offensive against\r\nour railroads, and on the 24th a heavy force of cavalry from\r\nMississippi, under General Forrest, made its appearance at Athena,\r\nAlabama, and captured its garrison.\r\n\r\nGeneral Newton's division (of the Fourth Corps), and Corse's (of\r\nthe Seventeenth), were sent back by rail, the former to\r\nChattanooga, and the latter to Rome.  On the 25th I telegraphed to\r\nGeneral Halleck:\r\n\r\nHood seems to be moving, as it were, to the Alabama line, leaving\r\nopen the road to Mason, as also to Augusta; but his cavalry is busy\r\non all our roads.  A force, number estimated as high as eight\r\nthousand, are reported to have captured Athena, Alabama; and a\r\nregiment of three hundred and fifty men sent to its relief.  I have\r\nsent Newton's division up to Chattanooga in cars, and will send\r\nanother division to Rome.  If I were sure that Savannah would soon\r\nbe in our possession, I should be tempted to march for\r\nMilledgeville and Augusta; but I must first secure what I have.\r\nJeff. Davis is at Macon.\r\n\r\nOn the next day I telegraphed further that Jeff. Davis was with\r\nHood at Palmetto Station.  One of our spies was there at the time,\r\nwho came in the next night, and reported to me the substance of his\r\nspeech to the soldiers.  It was a repetition of those he had made\r\nat Colombia, South Carolina, and Mason, Georgia, on his way out,\r\nwhich I had seen in the newspapers.  Davis seemed to be perfectly\r\nupset by the fall of Atlanta, and to have lost all sense and\r\nreason.  He denounced General Jos. Johnston and Governor Brown as\r\nlittle better than traitors; attributed to them personally the many\r\nmisfortunes which had befallen their cause, and informed the\r\nsoldiers that now the tables were to be turned; that General\r\nForrest was already on our roads in Middle Tennessee; and that\r\nHood's army would soon be there.  He asserted that the Yankee army\r\nwould have to retreat or starve, and that the retreat would prove\r\nmore disastrous than was that of Napoleon from Moscow.  He promised\r\nhis Tennessee and Kentucky soldiers that their feet should soon\r\ntread their \"native soil,\" etc., etc.  He made no concealment of\r\nthese vainglorious boasts, and thus gave us the full key to his\r\nfuture designs.  To be forewarned was to be forearmed, and I think\r\nwe took full advantage of the occasion.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th I received this dispatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA,September 26,1864-10 A.M.\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN, Atlanta\r\nIt will be better to drive Forrest out of Middle Tennessee as a\r\nfirst step, and do any thing else you may feel your force\r\nsufficient for.  When a movement is made on any part of the\r\nsea-coast, I will advise you.  If Hood goes to the Alabama line,\r\nwill it not be impossible for him to subsist his army?\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have your dispatch of to-day. I have already sent one\r\ndivision (Newton's) to Chattanooga, and another (Corse's) to Rome.\r\n\r\nOur armies are much reduced, and if I send back any more, I will\r\nnot be able to threaten Georgia much.  There are men enough to the\r\nrear to whip Forrest, but they are necessarily scattered to defend\r\nthe roads.\r\n\r\nCan you expedite the sending to Nashville of the recruits that are\r\nin Indiana and Ohio? They could occupy the forts.\r\n\r\nHood is now on the West Point road, twenty-four miles south of\r\nthis, and draws his supplies by that road.  Jefferson Davis is\r\nthere to-day, and superhuman efforts will be made to break my road.\r\n\r\nForrest is now lieutenant-general, and commands all the enemy's\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant first thought I was in error in supposing that Jeff.\r\nDavis was at Macon and Palmetto, but on the 27th I received a\r\nprinted copy of his speech made at Macon on the 22d, which was so\r\nsignificant that I ordered it to be telegraphed entire as far as\r\nLouisville, to be sent thence by mail to Washington, and on the\r\nsame day received this dispatch:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., September 27, 1864-9 A.M.\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN, Atlanta:\r\nYou say Jeff Davis is on a visit to General Hood.  I judge that\r\nBrown and Stephens are the objects of his visit.\r\nA. LINCOLN, President of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo which I replied:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, September 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nPresident LINCOLN, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nI have positive knowledge that Mr. Davis made a speech at Macon, on\r\nthe 22d, which I mailed to General Halleck yesterday.  It was\r\nbitter against General Jos. Johnston and Governor Brown.  The\r\nmilitia are on furlough.  Brown is at Milledgeville, trying to get\r\na Legislature to meet next month, but he is afraid to act unless in\r\nconcert with other Governors, Judge Wright, of Rome, has been here,\r\nand Messrs. Hill and Nelson, former members of Congress, are here\r\nnow, and will go to meet Wright at Rome, and then go back to\r\nMadison and Milledgeville.\r\n\r\nGreat efforts are being made to reenforce Hood's army, and to break\r\nup my railroads, and I should have at once a good reserve force at\r\nNashville.  It would have a bad effect, if I were forced to send\r\nback any considerable part of my army to guard roads, so as to\r\nweaken me to an extent that I could not act offensively if the\r\noccasion calls for it.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this time Hood and I were carrying on the foregoing\r\ncorrespondence relating to the exchange of prisoners, the removal\r\nof the people from Atlanta, and the relief of our prisoners of war\r\nat Andersonville.  Notwithstanding the severity of their\r\nimprisonment, some of these men escaped from Andersonville, and got\r\nto me at Atlanta.  They described their sad condition: more than\r\ntwenty-five thousand prisoners confined in a stockade designed for\r\nonly ten thousand; debarred the privilege of gathering wood out of\r\nwhich to make huts; deprived of sufficient healthy food, and the\r\nlittle stream that ran through their prison pen poisoned and\r\npolluted by the offal from their cooking and butchering houses\r\nabove.  On the 22d of September I wrote to General Hood, describing\r\nthe condition of our men at Andersonville, purposely refraining\r\nfrom casting odium on him or his associates for the treatment of\r\nthese men, but asking his consent for me to procure from our\r\ngenerous friends at the North the articles of clothing and comfort\r\nwhich they wanted, viz., under-clothing, soap, combs, scissors,\r\netc.--all needed to keep them in health--and to send these stores\r\nwith a train, and an officer to issue them.  General Hood, on the\r\n24th, promptly consented, and I telegraphed to my friend Mr. James\r\nE. Yeatman, Vice-President of the Sanitary Commission at St. Louis,\r\nto send us all the under-clothing and soap he could spare,\r\nspecifying twelve hundred fine-tooth combs, and four hundred pairs\r\nof shears to cut hair.  These articles indicate the plague that\r\nmost afflicted our prisoners at Andersonville.\r\n\r\nMr. Yeatman promptly responded to my request, expressed the\r\narticles, but they did not reach Andersonville in time, for the\r\nprisoners were soon after removed; these supplies did, however,\r\nfinally overtake them at Jacksonville, Florida, just before the war\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th I received from General Grant two dispatches\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA; September 27, 1864-8.30 A.M.\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\nIt is evident, from the tone of the Richmond press and from other\r\nsources of information, that the enemy intend making a desperate\r\neffort to drive you from where you are.  I have directed all new\r\ntroops from the West, and from the East too, if necessary, in case\r\nnone are ready in the West, to be sent to you.  If General\r\nBurbridge is not too far on his way to Abingdon, I think he had\r\nbetter be recalled and his surplus troops sent into Tennessee.\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA; September 27, 1864-10.30 A.M.\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\nI have directed all recruits and new troops from all the Western\r\nStates to be sent to Nashville, to receive their further orders\r\nfrom you.  I was mistaken about Jeff. Davis being in Richmond on\r\nThursday last.  He was then on his way to Macon.\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nForrest having already made his appearance in Middle Tennessee, and\r\nHood evidently edging off in that direction, satisfied me that the\r\ngeneral movement against our roads had begun.  I therefore\r\ndetermined to send General Thomas back to Chattanooga, with another\r\ndivision (Morgan's, of the Fourteenth Corps), to meet the danger in\r\nTennessee.  General Thomas went up on the 29th, and Morgan's\r\ndivision followed the same day, also by rail.  And I telegraphed to\r\nGeneral Halleck\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that Forrest will cut our road, but think we\r\ncan prevent him from making a serious lodgment.  His cavalry will\r\ntravel a hundred miles where ours will ten.  I have sent two\r\ndivisions up to Chattanooga and one to Rome, and General Thomas\r\nstarted to-day to drive Forrest out of Tennessee.  Our roads should\r\nbe watched from the rear, and I am glad that General Grant has\r\nordered reserves to Nashville.  I prefer for the future to make the\r\nmovement on Milledgeville, Millen, and Savannah.  Hood now rests\r\ntwenty-four miles south, on the Chattahoochee, with his right on\r\nthe West Point road.  He is removing the iron of the Macon road.  I\r\ncan whip his infantry, but his cavalry is to be feared.\r\n\r\nThere was great difficulty in obtaining correct information about\r\nHood's movements from Palmetto Station.  I could not get spies to\r\npenetrate his camps, but on the 1st of October I was satisfied that\r\nthe bulk of his infantry was at and across the Chattahoochee River,\r\nnear Campbellton, and that his cavalry was on the west side, at\r\nPowder Springs.  On that day I telegraphed to General Grant:\r\n\r\nHood is evidently across the Chattahoochee, below Sweetwater.  If\r\nhe tries to get on our road, this side of the Etowah, I shall\r\nattack him; but if he goes to the Selma & Talladega road, why will\r\nit not do to leave Tennessee to the forces which Thomas has, and\r\nthe reserves soon to come to Nashville, and for me to destroy\r\nAtlanta and march across Georgia to Savannah or Charleston,\r\nbreaking roads and doing irreparable damage? We cannot remain on\r\nthe defensive.\r\n\r\nThe Selma & Talladega road herein referred to was an unfinished\r\nrailroad from Selma, Alabama, through Talladega, to Blue Mountain,\r\na terminus sixty-five miles southwest of Rome and about fifteen\r\nmiles southeast of Gadsden, where the rebel army could be supplied\r\nfrom the direction of Montgomery and Mobile, and from which point\r\nHood could easily threaten Middle Tennessee.  My first impression\r\nwas, that Hood would make for that point; but by the 3d of October\r\nthe indications were that he would strike our railroad nearer us,\r\nviz., about Kingston or Marietta.\r\n\r\nOrders were at once made for the Twentieth Corps (Slocum's) to hold\r\nAtlanta and the bridges of the Chattahoochee, and the other corps\r\nwere put in motion for Marietta.\r\n\r\nThe army had undergone many changes since the capture of Atlanta.\r\nGeneral Schofield had gone to the rear, leaving General J. D. Cog\r\nin command of the Army of the Ohio (Twenty-third Corps).  General\r\nThomas, also, had been dispatched to Chattanooga, with Newton's\r\ndivision of the Fourth Corps and Morgan's of the Fourteenth Corps,\r\nleaving General D. S. Stanley, the senior major-general of the two\r\ncorps of his Army of the Cumberland, remaining and available for\r\nthis movement, viz., the Fourth and Fourteenth, commanded by\r\nhimself and Major-General Jeff. C. Davis; and after General Dodge\r\nwas wounded, his corps (the Sixteenth) had been broken up, and its\r\ntwo divisions were added to the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps,\r\nconstituting the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Major-General\r\nO. O. Howard.  Generals Logan and Blair had gone home to assist in\r\nthe political canvass, leaving their corps, viz., the Fifteenth and\r\nSeventeenth, under the command of Major-Generals Osterhaus and T.\r\nE. G. Ransom.\r\n\r\nThese five corps were very much reduced in strength, by detachments\r\nand by discharges, so that for the purpose of fighting Hood I had\r\nonly about sixty thousand infantry and artillery, with two small\r\ndivisions of cavalry (Kilpatrick's and Garrard's).  General Elliott\r\nwas the chief of cavalry to the Army of the Cumberland, and was the\r\nsenior officer of that arm of service present for duty with me.\r\n\r\nWe had strong railroad guards at Marietta and Kenesaw, Allatoona,\r\nEtowah Bridge, Kingston, Rome, Resaca, Dalton, Ringgold, and\r\nChattanooga.  All the important bridges were likewise protected by\r\ngood block-houses, admirably constructed, and capable of a strong\r\ndefense against cavalry or infantry; and at nearly all the regular\r\nrailroad-stations we had smaller detachments intrenched.  I had\r\nlittle fear of the enemy's cavalry damaging our roads seriously,\r\nfor they rarely made a break which could not be repaired in a few\r\ndays; but it was absolutely necessary to keep General Hood's\r\ninfantry off our main route of communication and supply.  Forrest\r\nhad with him in Middle Tennessee about eight thousand cavalry, and\r\nHood's army was estimated at from thirty-five to forty thousand\r\nmen, infantry and artillery, including Wheeler's cavalry, then\r\nabout three thousand strong.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Chattahoochee River during the 3d and 4th of\r\nOctober, rendezvoused at the old battle-field of Smyrna Camp, and\r\nthe next day reached Marietta and Kenesaw.  The telegraph-wires had\r\nbeen cut above Marietta, and learning that heavy masses of\r\ninfantry, artillery, and cavalry, had been seen from Kenesaw\r\n(marching north), I inferred that Allatoona was their objective\r\npoint; and on the 4th of October I signaled from Mining's Station\r\nto Kenesaw, and from Kenesaw to Allatoona, over the heads of the\r\nenemy, a message for General Corse, at Rome, to hurry back to the\r\nassistance of the garrison at Allatoona.  Allatoona was held by, a\r\nsmall brigade, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Tourtellotte, my\r\npresent aide-de-camp.  He had two small redoubts on either side of\r\nthe railroad, overlooking the village of Allatoona, and the\r\nwarehouses, in which were stored over a million rations of bread.\r\n\r\nReaching Kenesaw Mountain about 8 A.M. of October 5th (a beautiful\r\nday), I had a superb view of the vast panorama to the north and\r\nwest.  To the southwest, about Dallas, could be seen the smoke of\r\ncamp-fires, indicating the presence of a large force of the enemy,\r\nand the whole line of railroad from Big Shanty up to Allatoona\r\n(full fifteen miles) was marked by the fires of the burning\r\nrailroad.  We could plainly see the smoke of battle about,\r\nAllatoona, and hear the faint reverberation of the cannon.\r\n\r\nFrom Kenesaw I ordered the Twenty-third Corps (General Cox) to\r\nmarch due west on the Burnt Hickory road, and to burn houses or\r\npiles of brush as it progressed, to indicate the head of column,\r\nhoping to interpose this corps between Hood's main army at Dallas\r\nand the detachment then assailing Allatoona.  The rest of the army\r\nwas directed straight for Allatoona, northwest, distant eighteen\r\nmiles.  The signal-officer on Kenesaw reported that since daylight\r\nhe had failed to obtain any answer to his call for Allatoona; but,\r\nwhile I was with him, he caught a faint glimpse of the tell-tale\r\nflag through an embrasure, and after much time he made out these\r\nletters-\" C.,\" \"R.,\" \"S.,\" \"E.,\" \"H.,\" \"E.,\" \"R.,\" and translated\r\nthe message--\"Corse is here.\"  It was a source of great relief, for\r\nit gave me the first assurance that General Corse had received his\r\norders, and that the place was adequately garrisoned.\r\n\r\nI watched with painful suspense the indications of the battle\r\nraging there, and was dreadfully impatient at the slow progress of\r\nthe relieving column, whose advance was marked by the smokes which\r\nwere made according to orders, but about 2 p.m.  I noticed with\r\nsatisfaction that the smoke of battle about Allatoona grew less and\r\nless, and ceased altogether about 4 p.m.  For a time I attributed\r\nthis result to the effect of General Cog's march, but later in the\r\nafternoon the signal-flag announced the welcome tidings that the\r\nattack had been fairly repulsed, but that General Corse was\r\nwounded.  The next day my aide, Colonel Dayton, received this\r\ncharacteristic dispatch:\r\n\r\nALLATOONA, GEORGIA, October 6, 1884-2 P.M.\r\nCaptain L. M. DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp:\r\nI am short a cheek-bone and an ear, but am able to whip all h--l\r\nyet!  My losses are very heavy.  A force moving from Stilesboro' to\r\nKingston gives me some anxiety.  Tell me where Sherman is.\r\nJOHN M. CORSE, Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the enemy had retreated southwest, and would probably\r\nnext appear at Rome, I answered General Corse with orders to get\r\nback to Rome with his troops as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nGeneral Corse's report of this fight at Allatoona is very full and\r\ngraphic.  It is dated Rome, October 27, 1864; recites the fact that\r\nhe received his orders by signal to go to the assistance of\r\nAllatoona on the 4th, when he telegraphed to Kingston for cars, and\r\na train of thirty empty cars was started for him, but about ten of\r\nthem got off the track and caused delay.  By 7 p.m. he had at Rome\r\na train of twenty cars, which he loaded up with Colonel Rowett's\r\nbrigade, and part of the Twelfth Illinois Infantry; started at 8\r\np.m., reached  Allatoona (distant thirty-five miles) at 1 A.M.  of\r\nthe 5th, and sent the train back for more men; but the road was in\r\nbad order, and no more men came in time.  He found Colonel\r\nTourtellotte's garrison composed of eight hundred and ninety men;\r\nhis reenforcement was one thousand and fifty-four: total for the\r\ndefense, nineteen hundred and forty-four.  The outposts were\r\nalready engaged, and as soon as daylight came he drew back the men\r\nfrom the village to the ridge on which the redoubts were built.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was composed of French's division of three brigades,\r\nvariously reported from four to five thousand strong.  This force\r\ngradually surrounded the place by 8 A.M., when General French sent\r\nin by flag of truce this note:\r\n\r\n\r\nAROUND ALLATOONA, October 5, 1884.\r\n\r\nCommanding Officer, United States Forces, Allatoona:\r\n\r\nI have placed the forces under my command in such positions that\r\nyou are surrounded, and to avoid a needless effusion of blood I\r\ncall on you to surrender your forces at once, and unconditionally.\r\n\r\nFive minutes will be allowed you to decide.  Should you accede to\r\nthis, you will be treated in the most honorable manner as prisoners\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\nS.  G.  FRENCH,\r\nMajor-General commanding forces Confederate States.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Corse answered immediately:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTEENTH CORPS\r\nALLATOONA, GEORGIA, October 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General S. G. FRENCH, Confederate States, etc:\r\n\r\nYour communication demanding surrender of my command I acknowledge\r\nreceipt of, and respectfully reply that we are prepared for the\r\n\"needless effusion of blood\" whenever it is agreeable to you.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN M. CORSE,\r\nBrigadier-General commanding forces United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the attack began at once, coming from front, flank, and\r\nrear.  There were two small redoubts, with slight parapets and\r\nditches, one on each side of the deep railroad-cut.  These redoubts\r\nhad been located by Colonel Poe, United States Engineers, at the\r\ntime of our advance on Kenesaw, the previous June.  Each redoubt\r\noverlooked the storehouses close by the railroad, and each could\r\naid the other defensively by catching in flank the attacking force\r\nof the other.  Our troops at first endeavored to hold some ground\r\noutside the redoubts, but were soon driven inside, when the enemy\r\nmade repeated assaults, but were always driven back.  About 11 A.M.,\r\nColonel Redfield, of the Thirty-ninth Iowa, was killed, and Colonel\r\nRowett was wounded, but never ceased to fight and encourage his\r\nmen.  Colonel Tourtellotte was shot through the hips, but continued\r\nto command.  General Corse was, at 1 p.m., shot across the face,\r\nthe ball cutting his ear, which stunned him, but he continued to\r\nencourage his men and to give orders.  The enemy (about 1.30 p.m.)\r\nmade a last and desperate effort to carry one of the redoubts, but\r\nwas badly cut to pieces by the artillery and infantry fire from the\r\nother, when he began to draw off, leaving his dead and wounded on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nBefore finally withdrawing, General French converged a heavy fire\r\nof his cannon on the block-house at Allatoona Creek, about two\r\nmiles from the depot, set it on fire, and captured its garrison,\r\nconsisting of four officers and eighty-five men.  By 4 p.m.  he was\r\nin full retreat south, on the Dallas road, and got by before the\r\nhead of General Cox's column had reached it; still several\r\nambulances and stragglers were picked up by this command on that\r\nroad.  General Corse reported two hundred and thirty-one rebel\r\ndead, four hundred and eleven prisoners, three regimental colors,\r\nand eight hundred muskets captured.\r\n\r\nAmong the prisoners was a Brigadier-General Young, who thought that\r\nFrench's aggregate loss would reach two thousand.  Colonel\r\nTourtellotte says that, for days after General Corse had returned\r\nto Rome, his men found and buried at least a hundred more dead\r\nrebels, who had doubtless been wounded, and died in the woods near\r\nAllatoona.  I know that when I reached Allatoona, on the 9th, I saw\r\na good many dead men, which had been collected for burial.\r\n\r\nCorse's entire loss, officially reported, was:\r\n\r\n        Killed.    Wounded.    Missing.     Total.\r\n         142         353         212         707\r\n\r\n\r\nI esteemed this defense of Allatoona so handsome and important,\r\nthat I made it the subject of a general order, viz., No. 86, of\r\nOctober 7, 1864:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general commanding avails himself of the opportunity, in the\r\nhandsome defense made of Allatoona, to illustrate the most\r\nimportant principle in war, that fortified posts should be defended\r\nto the last, regardless of the relative numbers of the party\r\nattacking and attacked .  .  .  .  The thanks of this army are due\r\nand are hereby accorded to General Corse, Colonel Tourtellotte,\r\nColonel Rowett, officers, and men, for their determined and gallant\r\ndefense of Allatoona, and it is made an example to illustrate the\r\nimportance of preparing in time, and meeting the danger, when\r\npresent, boldly, manfully, and well.\r\n\r\nCommanders and garrisons of the posts along our railroad are hereby\r\ninstructed that they must hold their posts to the last minute, sure\r\nthat the time gained is valuable and necessary to their comrades at\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\nL.  M.  DAYTON, Aide-A-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rebels had struck our railroad a heavy blow, burning every tie,\r\nbending the rails for eight miles, from Big Shanty to above\r\nAcworth, so that the estimate for repairs called for thirty-five\r\nthousand new ties, and six miles of iron.  Ten thousand men were\r\ndistributed along the break to replace the ties, and to prepare the\r\nroad-bed, while the regular repair-party, under Colonel W. W.\r\nWright, came down from Chattanooga with iron, spikes, etc., and in\r\nabout seven days the road was all right again.  It was by such acts\r\nof extraordinary energy that we discouraged our adversaries, for\r\nthe rebel soldiers felt that it was a waste of labor for them to\r\nmarch hurriedly, on wide circuits, day and night, to burn a bridge\r\nand tear up a mile or so of track, when they knew that we could lay\r\nit back so quickly.  They supposed that we had men and money\r\nwithout limit, and that we always kept on hand, distributed along\r\nthe road, duplicates of every bridge and culvert of any importance.\r\n\r\nA good story is told of one who was on Kenesaw Mountain during our\r\nadvance in the previous June or July.  A group of rebels lay in the\r\nshade of a tree, one hot day, overlooking our camps about Big\r\nShanty.  One soldier remarked to his fellows:\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Yanks will have to git up and git now, for I heard\r\nGeneral Johnston himself say that General Wheeler had blown up the\r\ntunnel near Dalton, and that the Yanks would have to retreat,\r\nbecause they could get no more rations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hell!\" said a listener, \"don't you know that old Sherman\r\ncarries a duplicate tunnel along?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over, General Johnston inquired of me who was our\r\nchief railroad-engineer.  When I told him that it was Colonel W. W.\r\nWright, a civilian, he was much surprised, said that our feats of\r\nbridge-building and repairs of roads had excited his admiration;\r\nand he instanced the occasion at Kenesaw in June, when an officer\r\nfrom Wheeler's cavalry had reported to him in person that he had\r\ncome from General Wheeler, who had made a bad break in our road\r\nabout Triton Station, which he said would take at least a fortnight\r\nto repair; and, while they were talking, a train was seen coming\r\ndown the road which had passed that very break, and had reached me\r\nat Big Shanty as soon as the fleet horseman had reached him\r\n(General Johnston) at Marietta\r\n\r\nI doubt whether the history of war can furnish more examples of\r\nskill and bravery than attended the defense of the railroad from\r\nNashville to Atlanta during the year 1864.\r\n\r\nIn person I reached Allatoona on the 9th of October, still in doubt\r\nas to Hood's immediate intentions.  Our cavalry could do little\r\nagainst his infantry in the rough and wooded country about Dallas,\r\nwhich masked the enemy's movements; but General Corse, at Rome,\r\nwith Spencer's First Alabama Cavalry and a mounted regiment of\r\nIllinois Infantry, could feel the country south of Rome about\r\nCedartown and Villa Rica; and reported the enemy to be in force at\r\nboth places.  On the 9th I telegraphed to General Thomas, at\r\nNashville, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nI came up here to relieve our road.  The Twentieth Corps remains at\r\nAtlanta.  Hood reached the road and broke it up between Big Shanty\r\nand Acworth.  He attacked Allatoona, but was repulsed.  We have\r\nplenty of bread and meat, but forage is scarce.  I want to destroy\r\nall the road below Chattanooga, including Atlanta, and to make for\r\nthe sea-coast. We cannot defend this long line of road.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on the same day I telegraphed to General Grant, at City Point:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be a physical impossibility to protect the roads, now that\r\nHood, Forrest, Wheeler, and the whole batch of devils, are turned\r\nloose without home or habitation.  I think Hood's movements\r\nindicate a diversion to the end of the Selma & Talladega road, at\r\nBlue Mountain, about sixty miles southwest of Rome, from which he\r\nwill threaten Kingston, Bridgeport, and Decatur, Alabama.  I\r\npropose that we break up the railroad from Ohattanooga forward, and\r\nthat we strike out with our wagons for Milledgeville, Millen, and\r\nSavannah.  Until we can repopulate Georgia, it is useless for us to\r\noccupy it; but the utter destruction of its roads, houses, and\r\npeople, will cripple their military resources.  By attempting to\r\nhold the roads, we will lose a thousand men each month, and will\r\ngain no result.  I can make this march, and make Georgia howl!  We\r\nhave on hand over eight thousand head of cattle and three million\r\nrations of bread, but no corn.  We can find plenty of forage in the\r\ninterior of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime the rebel General Forrest had made a bold circuit in\r\nMiddle Tennessee, avoiding all fortified points, and breaking up\r\nthe railroad at several places; but, as usual, he did his work so\r\nhastily and carelessly that our engineers soon repaired the\r\ndamage--then, retreating before General Rousseau, he left the State\r\nof Tennessee, crossing the river near Florence, Alabama, and got\r\noff unharmed.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October the enemy appeared south of the Etowah River\r\nat Rome, when I ordered all the armies to march to Kingston, rode\r\nmyself to Cartersville with the Twenty-third Corps (General Cox),\r\nand telegraphed from there to General Thomas at Nashville:\r\n\r\nIt looks to me as though Hood was bound for Tuscumbia.  He is now\r\ncrossing the Coosa River below Rome, looking west. Let me know if\r\nyou can hold him with your forces now in Tennessee and the expected\r\nreenforeements, as, in that event, you know what I propose to do.\r\n\r\nI will be at Kingston to-morrow.  I think Rome is strong enough to\r\nresist any attack, and the rivers are all high. If he turns up by\r\nSummerville, I will get in behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on the same day to General Grant, at City Point:\r\n\r\nHood is now crossing the Coosa, twelve miles below Rome, bound\r\nwest. If he passes over to the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, had I not\r\nbetter execute the plan of my letter sent you by Colonel Porter,\r\nand leave General Thomas, with the troops now in Tennessee, to\r\ndefend the State? He will have an ample force when the\r\nreenforcements ordered reach Nashville.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found General John E.  Smith at Cartersville, and on the 11th\r\nrode on to Kingston, where I had telegraphic communications in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nFrom General Corse, at Rome, I learned that Hood's army had\r\ndisappeared, but in what direction he was still in doubt; and I was\r\nso strongly convinced of the wisdom of my proposition to change the\r\nwhole tactics of the campaign, to leave Hood to General Thomas, and\r\nto march across Georgia for Savannah or Charleston, that I again\r\ntelegraphed to General Grant:\r\n\r\nWe cannot now remain on the defensive.  With twenty-five thousand\r\ninfantry and the bold cavalry he has, Hood can constantly break my\r\nroad.  I would infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road and of\r\nthe country from Chattanooga to Atlanta, including the latter city;\r\nsend back all my wounded and unserviceable men, and with my\r\neffective army move through Georgia, smashing things to the sea.\r\nHood may turn into Tennessee and Kentucky, but I believe he will be\r\nforced to follow me.  Instead of being on the defensive, I will be\r\non the offensive.  Instead of my guessing at what he means to do,\r\nhe will have to guess at my plans.  The difference in war would be\r\nfully twenty-five per pent.  I can make Savannah, Charleston, or\r\nthe month of the Chattahoochee (Appalachicola).  Answer quick, as I\r\nknow we will not have the telegraph long.\r\n\r\n\r\nI received no answer to this at the time, and the next day went on\r\nto Rome, where the news came that Hood had made his appearance at\r\nResaca, and had demanded the surrender of the place, which was\r\ncommanded by Colonel Weaver, reenforced by Brevet Brigadier-General\r\nRaum.  General Hood had evidently marched with rapidity up the\r\nChattooga Valley, by Summerville, Lafayette, Ship's Gap, and\r\nSnake-Creek Gap, and had with him his whole army, except a small\r\nforce left behind to watch Rome.  I ordered Resaca to be further\r\nreenforced by rail from Kingston, and ordered General Cox to make a\r\nbold reconnoissance down the Coosa Valley, which captured and\r\nbrought into Rome some cavalrymen and a couple of field-guns, with\r\ntheir horses and men.  At first I thought of interposing my whole\r\narmy in the Chattooga Valley, so as to prevent Hood's escape south;\r\nbut I saw at a glance that he did not mean to fight, and in that\r\nevent, after damaging the road all he could, he would be likely to\r\nretreat eastward by Spring Place, which I did not want him to do;\r\nand, hearing from General Raum that he still held Resaca safe, and\r\nthat General Edward McCook had also got there with some cavalry\r\nreenforcements, I turned all the heads of columns for Resaca, viz.,\r\nGeneral Cox's, from Rome; General Stanley's, from McGuire's; and\r\nGeneral Howard's, from Kingston.  We all reached Resaca during that\r\nnight, and the next morning (13th) learned that Hood's whole army\r\nhad passed up the valley toward Dalton, burning the railroad and\r\ndoing all the damage possible.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th he had demanded the surrender of Resaca in the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE\r\nIN THE FIELD, October 12,1861.\r\n\r\nTo the officer commanding the United States Forces at Resaca,\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nSIR: I demand the immediate and unconditional surrender of the post\r\nand garrison under your command, and, should this be acceded to,\r\nall white officers and soldiers will be parolled in a few days.  If\r\nthe place is carried by assault, no prisoners will be taken.  Most\r\nrespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.  B.  HOOD, General.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Colonel Weaver, then in command, replied:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, THIRD DIVISION, FIFTEENTH CORPS\r\nRESACA, GEORGIA,  October 12, 1884.\r\n\r\nTo General J. B. HOOD\r\n\r\nYour communication of this date just received.  In reply, I have to\r\nstate that I am somewhat surprised at the concluding paragraph, to\r\nthe effect that, if the place is carried by assault, no prisoners\r\nwill be taken.  In my opinion I can hold this post. If you want it,\r\ncome and take it.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nCLARK R. WEAVER, Commanding Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brigade  was very small, and as Hood's investment extended\r\nonly from the Oostenaula, below the town, to the Connesauga above,\r\nhe left open the approach from the south, which enabled General\r\nRaum and the cavalry of Generals McCook and Watkins to reenforce\r\nfrom Kingston.  In fact, Hood, admonished by his losses at\r\nAllatoona, did not attempt an assault at all, but limited his\r\nattack to the above threat, and to some skirmishing, giving his\r\nattention chiefly to the destruction of the railroad, which he\r\naccomplished all the way up to Tunnel Hill, nearly twenty miles,\r\ncapturing en route the regiment of black troops at Dalton\r\n(Johnson's Forty-fourth United States colored).  On the 14th, I\r\nturned General Howard through Snake-Creek Gap, and sent General\r\nStanley around by Tilton, with orders to cross the mountain to the\r\nwest, so as to capture, if possible, the force left by the enemy in\r\nSnake-Creek Gap.  We found this gap very badly obstructed by fallen\r\ntimber, but got through that night, and the next day the main army\r\nwas at Villanow.  On the morning of the 16th, the leading division\r\nof General Howard's column, commanded by General Charles R. Woods,\r\ncarried Ship's Gap, taking prisoners part of the Twenty-fourth\r\nSouth Carolina Regiment, which had been left there to hold us in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe best information there obtained located Hood's army at\r\nLafayette, near which place I hoped to catch him and force him to\r\nbattle; but, by the time we had got enough troops across the\r\nmountain at Ship's Gap, Hood had escaped down the valley of the\r\nChattooga, and all we could do was to follow him as closely as\r\npossible.  From Ship's Gap I dispatched couriers to Chattanooga,\r\nand received word back that General Schofield was there,\r\nendeavoring to cooperate with me, but Hood had broken up the\r\ntelegraph, and thus had prevented quick communication.  General\r\nSchofield did not reach me till the army had got down to\r\nGaylesville, about the 21st of October.\r\n\r\nIt was at Ship's Gap that a courier brought me the cipher message\r\nfrom General Halleck which intimated that the authorities in\r\nWashington were willing I should undertake the march across Georgia\r\nto the sea.  The translated dispatch named \"Horse-i-bar Sound\" as\r\nthe point where the fleet would await my arrival.  After much time\r\nI construed it to mean, \"Ossabaw Sound,\" below Savannah, which was\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th I telegraphed to General Thomas, at Nashville:\r\n\r\nSend me Morgan's and Newton's old divisions.  Reestablish the road,\r\nand I will follow Hood wherever he may go.  I think he will move to\r\nBlue Mountain.  We can maintain our men and animals on the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas's reply was:\r\n\r\nNASHVILLE, October 17, 1864--10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nYour dispatch from Ship's Gap, 5 p.m. of the 16th, just received.\r\nSchofield, whom I placed in command of the two divisions (Wagner's\r\nand Morgan's), was to move up Lookout Valley this A.M., to\r\nintercept Hood, should he be marching for Bridgeport.  I will order\r\nhim to join you with the two divisions, and will reconstruct the\r\nroad as soon as possible.  Will also reorganize the guards for\r\nposts and block-houses ....  Mower and Wilson have arrived, and are\r\non their way to join you.  I hope you will adopt Grant's idea of\r\nturning Wilson loose, rather than undertake the plan of a march\r\nwith the whole force through Georgia to the sea, inasmuch as\r\nGeneral Grant cannot cooperate with you as at first arranged.\r\n\r\nGEORGE H.  THOMAS, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it is clear that at that date neither General Grant nor General\r\nThomas heartily favored my proposed plan of campaign.  On the same\r\nday, I wrote to General Schofield at Chattanooga:\r\n\r\nHood is not at Dear Head Cove.  We occupy Ship's Gap and Lafayette.\r\nHood is moving south via Summerville, Alpine, and Gadsden.  If he\r\nenters Tennessee, it will be to the west of Huntsville, but I think\r\nhe has given up all such idea.  I want the road repaired to\r\nAtlanta; the sick and wounded men sent north of the Tennessee; my\r\narmy recomposed; and I will then make the interior of Georgia feel\r\nthe weight of war.  It is folly for us to be moving our armies on\r\nthe reports of scouts and citizens.  We must maintain the\r\noffensive.  Your first move on Trenton and Valley Head was right\r\n--the move to defend Caperton's Ferry is wrong.  Notify General\r\nThomas of these my views.  We must follow Hood till he is beyond\r\nthe reach of mischief, and then resume the offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between me and the authorities at Washington, as\r\nwell as with the several army commanders, given at length in the\r\nreport of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, is full on all\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\nAfter striking our road at Dalton, Hood was compelled to go on to\r\nChattanooga and Bridgeport, or to pass around by Decatur and\r\nabandon altogether his attempt to make us let go our hold of\r\nAtlanta by attacking our communications.  It was clear to me that\r\nhe had no intention to meet us in open battle, and the lightness\r\nand celerity of his army convinced me that I could not possibly\r\ncatch him on a stern-chase.  We therefore quietly followed him down\r\nthe Chattooga Valley to the neighborhood of Gadsden, but halted the\r\nmain armies near the Coosa River, at the mouth of the Chattooga,\r\ndrawing our supplies of corn and meat from the farms of that\r\ncomparatively rich valley and of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nGeneral Slocum, in Atlanta, had likewise sent out, under strong\r\nescort, large trains of wagons to the east, and brought back corn,\r\nbacon, and all kinds of provisions, so that Hood's efforts to cut\r\noff our supplies only reacted on his own people.  So long as the\r\nrailroads were in good order, our supplies came full and regular\r\nfrom the North; but when the enemy broke our railroads we were\r\nperfectly justified in stripping the inhabitants of all they had.\r\nI remember well the appeal of a very respectable farmer against our\r\nmen driving away his fine flock of sheep.  I explained to him that\r\nGeneral Hood had broken our railroad; that we were a strong, hungry\r\ncrowd, and needed plenty of food; that Uncle Sam was deeply\r\ninterested in our continued health and would soon repair these\r\nroads, but meantime we must eat; we preferred Illinois beef, but\r\nmutton would have to answer.  Poor fellow!  I don't believe he was\r\nconvinced of the wisdom or wit of my explanation.  Very soon after\r\nreaching Lafayette we organized a line of supply from Chattanooga\r\nto Ringgold by rail, and thence by wagons to our camps about\r\nGaylesville.  Meantime, also, Hood had reached the neighborhood of\r\nGadsden, and drew his supplies from the railroad at Blue Mountain.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October I telegraphed to General Halleck, at\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\nHood has retreated rapidly by all the roads leading south.  Our\r\nadvance columns are now at Alpine and Melville Post-Office.  I\r\nshall pursue him as far as Gaylesville.  The enemy will not venture\r\ntoward Tennessee except around by Decatur.  I propose to send the\r\nFourth Corps back to General Thomas, and leave him, with that\r\ncorps, the garrisons, and new troops, to defend the line of the\r\nTennessee River; and with the rest I will push into the heart of\r\nGeorgia and come out at Savannah, destroying all the railroads of\r\nthe State.  The break in our railroad at Big Shanty is almost\r\nrepaired, and that about Dalton should be done in ten days.  We\r\nfind abundance of forage in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day I telegraphed to General L. C. Easton,\r\nchief-quartermaster, who had been absent on a visit to Missouri,\r\nbut had got back to Chattanooga:\r\n\r\nGo in person to superintend the repairs of the railroad, and make\r\nall orders in my name that will expedite its completion.  I want it\r\nfinished, to bring back from Atlanta to Chattanooga the sick and\r\nwounded men and surplus stores.  On the 1st of November I want\r\nnothing in front of Chattanooga except what we can use as food and\r\nclothing and haul in our wagons.  There is plenty of corn in the\r\ncountry, and we only want forage for the posts.  I allow ten days\r\nfor all this to be done, by which time I expect to be at or near\r\nAtlanta.\r\n\r\n\r\nI telegraphed also to General Amos Beckwith, chief-commissary in\r\nAtlanta, who was acting as chief-quartermaster during the absence\r\nof General Easton:\r\n\r\nHood will escape me.  I want to prepare for my big raid.  On the\r\n1st of November I want nothing in Atlanta but what is necessary for\r\nwar.  Send all trash to the rear at once, and have on hand thirty\r\ndays' food and but little forage.  I propose to abandon Atlanta,\r\nand the railroad back to Chattanooga, to sally forth to ruin\r\nGeorgia and bring up on the seashore.  Make all dispositions\r\naccordingly.  I will go down the Coosa until I am sure that Hood\r\nhas gone to Blue Mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of October I reached Gaylesville, had my bivouac in an\r\nopen field back of the village, and remained there till the 28th.\r\nDuring that time General Schofield arrived, with the two divisions\r\nof Generals Wagner (formerly Newton's) and Morgan, which were\r\nreturned to their respective corps (the Fourth and Fourteenth), and\r\nGeneral Schofield resumed his own command of the Army of the Ohio,\r\nthen on the Coosa River, near Cedar Bluff.  General Joseph A. Mower\r\nalso arrived, and was assigned to command a division in the\r\nSeventeenth Corps; and General J. H. Wilson came, having been sent\r\nfrom Virginia by General Grant, for the purpose of commanding all\r\nmy cavalry.  I first intended to organize this cavalry into a corps\r\nof three small divisions, to be commanded by General Wilson; but\r\nthe horses were well run down, and, at Wilson's instance, I\r\nconcluded to retain only one division of four thousand five hundred\r\nmen, with selected horses, under General Kilpatrick, and to send\r\nGeneral Wilson back with all the rest to Nashville, to be\r\nreorganized and to act under General Thomas in the defense of\r\nTennessee.  Orders to this effect were made on the 24th of October.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, in designating General Wilson to command my cavalry,\r\npredicted that he would, by his personal activity, increase the\r\neffect of that arm \"fifty per cent.,\" and he advised that he should\r\nbe sent south, to accomplish all that I had proposed to do with the\r\nmain army; but I had not so much faith in cavalry as he had, and\r\npreferred to adhere to my original intention of going myself with a\r\ncompetent force.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I learned that General Beauregard had reached\r\nHood's army at Gadsden; that, without assuming direct command of\r\nthat army, he had authority from the Confederate Government to\r\ndirect all its movements, and to call to his assistance the whole\r\nstrength of the South.  His orders, on assuming command, were full\r\nof alarm and desperation, dated:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST\r\nOctober 17, 1864\r\n\r\nIn assuming command, at this critical juncture, of the Military\r\nDivision of the West, I appeal to my countrymen, of all classes and\r\nsections, for their generous support.  In assigning me to this\r\nresponsible position, the President of the Confederate States has\r\nextended to me the assurance of his earnest support.  The\r\nExecutives of your States meet me with similar expressions of their\r\ndevotion to our cause.  The noble army in the field, composed of\r\nbrave men and gallant officers, are strangers to me, but I know\r\nthey will do all that patriots can achieve.....\r\n\r\nThe army of Sherman still defiantly holds Atlanta.  He can and must\r\nbe driven from it.  It is only for the good people of Georgia and\r\nsurrounding states to speak the word, and the work is done, we have\r\nabundant provisions.  There are men enough in the country, liable\r\nto and able for service, to accomplish the result.....\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, respond to this call as you have done in days that\r\nare past, and, with the blessing of a kind and overruling\r\nProvidence, the enemy shall be driven from your soil.  The security\r\nof your wives and daughters from the insults and outrages of a\r\nbrutal foe shall be established soon, and be followed by a\r\npermanent and honorable peace.  The claims of home and country,\r\nwife and children, uniting with the demands of honor and\r\npatriotism, summon us to the field.  We cannot, dare not, will not\r\nfail to respond.  Full of hope and confidence, I come to join you\r\nin your struggles, sharing your privations, and, with your brave\r\nand true men, to strike the blow that shall bring success to our\r\narms, triumph to our cause, and peace to our country! . . .\r\n\r\nG. T. BEAUREGARD, General.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this somewhat boastful order or appeal, General\r\nBeauregard did not actually accompany General Hood on his\r\ndisastrous march to Nashville, but took post at Corinth,\r\nMississippi, to control the movement of his supplies and to watch\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAt Gaylesville the pursuit of Hood by the army under my immediate\r\ncommand may be said to have ceased.  During this pursuit, the\r\nFifteenth Corps was commanded by its senior major-general present,\r\nP. J. Osterhaus, in the absence of General John A. Logan; and the\r\nSeventeenth Corps was commanded by Brigadier-General T. E. G.\r\nRansom, the senior officer present, in the absence of General Frank\r\nP.  Blair.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ransom was a young, most gallant, and promising officer,\r\nson of the Colonel Ransom who was killed at Chapultepec, in the\r\nMexican War.  He had served with the Army of the Tennessee in 1862\r\nand 1863, at Vicksburg, where he was severely wounded.  He was not\r\nwell at the time we started from Atlanta, but he insisted on going\r\nalong with his command.  His symptoms became more aggravated on the\r\nmarch, and when we were encamped near Gaylesville, I visited him in\r\ncompany with Surgeon John Moors, United States Army, who said that\r\nthe case was one of typhoid fever, which would likely prove fatal.\r\nA few days after, viz., the 28th, he was being carried on a litter\r\ntoward Rome; and as I rode from Gaylesville to Rome, I passed him\r\nby the way, stopped, and spoke with him, but did not then suppose\r\nhe was so near his end.  The next day, however, his escort reached\r\nRome, bearing his dead body.  The officer in charge reported that,\r\nshortly after I had passed, his symptoms became so much worse that\r\nthey stopped at a farmhouse by the road-side, where he died that\r\nevening.  His body was at once sent to Chicago for burial, and a\r\nmonument has been ordered by the Society of the Army of the\r\nTennessee to be erected in his memory.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of October I learned that Hood's whole army had made\r\nits appearance about Decatur, Alabama, and at once caused a strong\r\nreconnoissance to be made down the Coosa to near Gadsden, which\r\nrevealed the truth that the enemy was gone except a small force of\r\ncavalry, commanded by General Wheeler, which had been left to watch\r\nus.  I then finally resolved on my future course, which was to\r\nleave Hood to be encountered by General Thomas, while I should\r\ncarry into full effect the long-contemplated project of marching\r\nfor the sea-coast, and thence to operate toward Richmond.  But it\r\nwas all-important to me and to our cause that General Thomas should\r\nhave an ample force, equal to any and every emergency.\r\n\r\nHe then had at Nashville about eight or ten thousand new troops,\r\nand as many more civil employs of the Quartermaster's Department,\r\nwhich were not suited for the field, but would be most useful in\r\nmanning the excellent forts that already covered Nashville.  At\r\nChattanooga, he had General Steedman's division, about five\r\nthousand men, besides garrisons for Chattanooga, Bridgeport, and\r\nStevenson; at Murfreesboro' he also had General Rousseau's\r\ndivision, which was full five thousand strong, independent of the\r\nnecessary garrisons for the railroad.  At Decatur and Huntsville,\r\nAlabama, was the infantry division of General R. S. Granger,\r\nestimated at four thousand; and near Florence, Alabama, watching\r\nthe crossings of the Tennessee, were General Edward Hatch's\r\ndivision of cavalry, four thousand; General Croxton's brigade,\r\ntwenty-five hundred; and Colonel Capron's brigade, twelve hundred;\r\nbesides which, General J.  H.  Wilson had collected in Nashville\r\nabout ten thousand dismounted cavalry, for which he was rapidly\r\ncollecting the necessary horses for a remount.  All these\r\naggregated about forty-five thousand men.  General A. J. Smith at\r\nthat time was in Missouri, with the two divisions of the Sixteenth\r\nCorps which had been diverted to that quarter to assist General\r\nRosecrans in driving the rebel General Price out of Missouri.  This\r\nobject had been accomplished, and these troops, numbering from\r\neight to ten thousand, had been ordered to Nashville.  To these I\r\nproposed at first to add only the Fourth Corps (General Stanley),\r\nfifteen thousand; and that corps was ordered from Gaylesville to\r\nmarch to Chattanooga, and thence report for orders to General\r\nThomas; but subsequently, on the 30th of October, at Rome, Georgia,\r\nlearning from General Thomas that the new troops promised by\r\nGeneral Grant were coming forward very slowly, I concluded to\r\nfurther reenforce him by General Schofield's corps (Twenty-third),\r\ntwelve thousand, which corps accordingly marched for Resaca, and\r\nthere took the cars for Chattanooga.  I then knew that General\r\nThomas would have an ample force with which to encounter General\r\nHood anywhere in the open field, besides garrisons to secure the\r\nrailroad to his rear and as far forward as Chattanooga.  And,\r\nmoreover, I was more than convinced that he would have ample time\r\nfor preparation; for, on that very day, General R. S. Granger had\r\ntelegraphed me from Decatur, Alabama:\r\n\r\nI omitted to mention another reason why Hood will go to Tusomnbia\r\nbefore crossing the Tennessee River.  He was evidently out of\r\nsupplies.  His men were all grumbling; the first thing the\r\nprisoners asked for was something to eat.  Hood could not get any\r\nthing if he should cross this side of Rogersville.\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew that the country about Decatur and Tuscumbia, Alabama, was\r\nbare of provisions, and inferred that General Hood would have to\r\ndraw his supplies, not only of food, but of stores, clothing, and\r\nammunition, from Mobile, Montgomery, and Selma, Alabama, by the\r\nrailroad around by Meridian and Corinth, Mississippi, which we had\r\nmost effectually disabled the previous winter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hood did not make a serious attack on Decatur, but hung\r\naround it from October 26th to the 30th, when he drew off and\r\nmarched for a point on the south side of the Tennessee River,\r\nopposite Florence, where he was compelled to remain nearly a month,\r\nto collect the necessary supplies for his contemplated invasion of\r\nTennessee and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Corps (Stanley) had already reached Chattanooga, and had\r\nbeen transported by rail to Pulaski, Tennessee; and General Thomas\r\nordered General Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, to\r\nColumbia, Tennessee, a place intermediate between Hood (then on the\r\nTennessee River, opposite Florence) and Forrest, opposite\r\nJohnsonville.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October General Croxton, of the cavalry, reported\r\nthat the enemy had crossed the Tennessee River four miles above\r\nFlorence, and that he had endeavored to stop him, but without\r\nsuccess.  Still, I was convinced that Hood's army was in no\r\ncondition to march for Nashville, and that a good deal of further\r\ndelay might reasonably be counted on.  I also rested with much\r\nconfidence on the fact that the Tennessee River below Muscle Shoals\r\nwas strongly patrolled by gunboats, and that the reach of the river\r\nabove Muscle Shoals, from Decatur as high up as our railroad at\r\nBridgeport, was also guarded by gunboats, so that Hood, to cross\r\nover, would be compelled to select a point inaccessible to these\r\ngunboats.  He actually did choose such a place, at the old\r\nrailroad-piers, four miles above Florence, Alabama, which is below\r\nMuscle Shoals and above Colbert Shoals.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October Forrest made his appearance on the Tennessee\r\nRiver opposite Johnsonville (whence a new railroad led to\r\nNashville), and with his cavalry and field pieces actually crippled\r\nand captured two gunboats with five of our transports, a feat of\r\narms which, I confess, excited my admiration.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the month of October closed to us looking\r\ndecidedly squally; but, somehow, I was sustained in the belief that\r\nin a very few days the tide would turn.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November I telegraphed very fully to General Grant,\r\nat City Point, who must have been disturbed by the wild rumors that\r\nfilled the country, and on the 2d of November received (at Rome)\r\nthis dispatch:\r\n\r\nCITY POINT,  November 1, 1864--6 P.M.\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nDo you not think it advisable, now that Hood has gone so far north,\r\nto entirely ruin him before starting on your proposed campaign?\r\nWith Hood's army destroyed, you can go where you please with\r\nimpunity.  I believed and still believe, if you had started south\r\nwhile Hood was in the neighborhood of you, he would have been\r\nforced to go after you.  Now that he is far away he might look upon\r\nthe chase as useless, and he will go in one direction while you are\r\npushing in the other.  If you can see a chance of destroying Hood's\r\narmy, attend to that first, and make your other move secondary.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy answer is dated\r\n\r\nROME, GEORGIA, November 2, 1864.\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour dispatch is received.  If I could hope to overhaul Hood, I\r\nwould turn against him with my whole force; then he would retreat\r\nto the south west, drawing me as a decoy away from Georgia, which\r\nis his chief object. If he ventures north of the Tennessee River, I\r\nmay turn in that direction, and endeavor to get below him on his\r\nline of retreat; but thus far he has not gone above the Tennessee\r\nRiver.  General Thomas will have a force strong enough to prevent\r\nhis reaching any country in which we have an interest; and he has\r\norders, if Hood turns to follow me, to push for Selma, Alabama.  No\r\nsingle army can catch Hood, and I am convinced the best results\r\nwill follow from our defeating Jeff. Davis's cherished plea of\r\nmaking me leave Georgia by manoeuvring.  Thus far I have confined\r\nmy efforts to thwart this plan, and have reduced baggage so that I\r\ncan pick up and start in any direction; but I regard the pursuit of\r\nHood as useless.  Still, if he attempts to invade Middle Tennessee,\r\nI will hold Decatur, and be prepared to move in that direction;\r\nbut, unless I let go of Atlanta, my force will not be equal to his.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this date, under the intelligent and energetic action of Colonel\r\nW. W. Wright, and with the labor of fifteen hundred men, the\r\nrailroad break of fifteen miles about Dalton was repaired so far as\r\nto admit of the passage of cars, and I transferred my headquarters\r\nto Kingston as more central; and from that place, on the same day\r\n(November 2d), again telegraphed to General Grant:\r\n\r\nKINGSTON, GEORGIA, November 2, 1884.\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\nIf I turn back, the whole effect of my campaign will be lost. By my\r\nmovements I have thrown Beauregard (Hood) well to the west, and\r\nThomas will have ample time and sufficient troops to hold him until\r\nthe reenforcements from Missouri reach him.  We have now ample\r\nsupplies at Chattanooga and Atlanta, and can stand a month's\r\ninterruption to our communications.  I do not believe the\r\nConfederate army can reach our railroad-lines except by\r\ncavalry-raids, and Wilson will have cavalry enough to checkmate\r\nthem.  I am clearly of opinion that the best results will follow my\r\ncontemplated movement through Georgia.\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same day I received, in answer to the Rome dispatch, the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, November 2,1864--11.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nYour dispatch of 9 A.M. yesterday is just received.  I dispatched\r\nyou the same date, advising that Hood's army, now that it had\r\nworked so far north, ought to be looked upon now as the \"object.\"\r\nWith the force, however, that you have left with General Thomas, he\r\nmust be able to take care of Hood and destroy him.\r\n\r\nI do not see that you can withdraw from where you are to follow\r\nHood, without giving up all we have gained in territory.  I say,\r\nthen, go on as you propose.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General,\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that General Grant ordered the \"march to\r\nthe sea,\" and, although many of his warm friends and admirers\r\ninsist that he was the author and projector of that march, and that\r\nI simply executed his plans, General Grant has never, in my\r\nopinion, thought so or said so.  The truth is fully given in an\r\noriginal letter of President Lincoln, which I received at Savannah,\r\nGeorgia, and have at this instant before me, every word of which is\r\nin his own familiar handwriting.  It is dated--\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nWhen you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was\r\nanxious, if not fearful; but, feeling that you were the better\r\njudge, and remembering \"nothing risked, nothing gained,\" I did not\r\ninterfere.  Now, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all\r\nyours; for I believe none of us went further than to acquiesce;\r\nand, taking the work of General Thomas into account, as it should\r\nbe taken, it is indeed a great success.  Not only does it afford\r\nthe obvious and immediate military advantages, but, in showing to\r\nthe world that your army could be divided, putting the stronger\r\npart to an important new service, and yet leaving enough to\r\nvanquish the old opposing force of the whole, Hood's army, it\r\nbrings those who sat in darkness to see a great light.  But what\r\nnext?  I suppose it will be safer if I leave General Grant and\r\nyourself to decide.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, this judgment; made after the event, was extremely\r\nflattering and was all I ever expected, a recognition of the truth\r\nand of its importance.  I have often been asked, by well-meaning\r\nfriends, when the thought of that march first entered my mind.  I\r\nknew that an army which had penetrated Georgia as far as Atlanta\r\ncould not turn back.  It must go ahead, but when, how, and where,\r\ndepended on many considerations.  As soon as Hood had shifted\r\nacross from Lovejoy's to Palmetto, I saw the move in my \"mind's\r\neye;\" and, after Jeff. Davis's speech at Palmetto, of September\r\n26th, I was more positive in my conviction, but was in doubt as to\r\nthe time and manner.  When General Hood first struck our railroad\r\nabove Marietta, we were not ready, and I was forced to watch his\r\nmovements further, till he had \"carromed\" off to the west of\r\nDecatur.  Then I was perfectly convinced, and had no longer a\r\nshadow of doubt.  The only possible question was as to Thomas's\r\nstrength and ability to meet Hood in the open field.  I did not\r\nsuppose that General Hood, though rash, would venture to attack\r\nfortified places like Allatoona, Resaca, Decatur, and Nashville;\r\nbut he did so, and in so doing he played into our hands perfectly.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of November I was at Kingston, Georgia, and my four\r\ncorps--the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, Fourteenth, and Twentieth--with\r\none division of cavalry, were strung from Rome to Atlanta.  Our\r\nrailroads and telegraph had been repaired, and I deliberately\r\nprepared for the march to Savannah, distant three hundred miles\r\nfrom Atlanta.  All the sick and wounded men had been sent back by\r\nrail to Chattanooga; all our wagon-trains had been carefully\r\noverhauled and loaded, so as to be ready to start on an hour's\r\nnotice, and there was no serious enemy in our front.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hood remained still at Florence, Alabama, occupying both\r\nbanks of the Tennessee River, busy in collecting shoes and clothing\r\nfor his men, and the necessary ammunition and stores with which to\r\ninvade Tennessee, most of which had to come from Mobile, Selma, and\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, over railroads that were still broken.\r\nBeauregard was at Corinth, hastening forward these necessary\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas was at Nashville, with Wilson's dismounted cavalry\r\nand a mass of new troops and quartermaster's employs amply\r\nsufficient to defend the place.  The Fourth and Twenty-third Corps,\r\nunder Generals Stanley and Schofield were posted at Pulaski,\r\nTennessee, and the cavalry of Hatch, Croxton, and Capron, were\r\nabout Florence, watching Hood.  Smith's (A. J.) two divisions of\r\nthe Sixteenth Corps were still in Missouri, but were reported as\r\nready to embark at Lexington for the Cumberland River and\r\nNashville.  Of course, General Thomas saw that on him would likely\r\nfall the real blow, and was naturally anxious.  He still kept\r\nGranger's division at Decatur, Rousseau's at Murfreesboro', and\r\nSteedman's at Chattanooga, with strong railroad guards at all the\r\nessential points intermediate, confident that by means of this very\r\nrailroad he could make his concentration sooner than Hood could\r\npossibly march up from Florence.\r\n\r\nMeantime, General F. P. Blair had rejoined his corps (Seventeenth),\r\nand we were receiving at Kingston recruits and returned\r\nfurlough-men, distributing them to their proper companies.\r\nPaymasters had come down to pay off our men before their departure to\r\na new sphere of action, and commissioners were also on hand from the\r\nseveral States to take the vote of our men in the presidential\r\nelection then agitating the country.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of November, at Kingston, I wrote and telegraphed to\r\nGeneral Grant, reviewing the whole situation, gave him my full plan\r\nof action, stated that I was ready to march as soon as the election\r\nwas over, and appointed November 10th as the day for starting.  On\r\nthe 8th I received this dispatch:\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, November 7, 1864-10.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nYour dispatch of this evening received.  I see no present reason\r\nfor changing your plan.  Should any arise, you will see it, or if I\r\ndo I will inform you.  I think everything here is favorable now.\r\nGreat good fortune attend you! I believe you will be eminently\r\nsuccessful, and, at worst, can only make a march less fruitful of\r\nresults than hoped for.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime trains of cars were whirling by, carrying to the rear an\r\nimmense amount of stores which had accumulated at Atlanta, and at\r\nthe other stations along the railroad; and General Steedman had\r\ncome down to Kingston, to take charge of the final evacuation and\r\nwithdrawal of the several garrisons below Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November the movement may be said to have fairly\r\nbegun.  All the troops designed for the campaign were ordered to\r\nmarch for Atlanta, and General Corse, before evacuating his post at\r\nRome, was ordered to burn all the mills, factories, etc., etc.,\r\nthat could be useful to the enemy, should he undertake to pursue\r\nus, or resume military possession of the country.  This was done on\r\nthe night of the 10th, and next day Corse reached Kingston.  On the\r\n11th General Thomas and I interchanged full dispatches.  He had\r\nheard of the arrival of General A. J. Smith's two divisions at\r\nPaducah, which would surely reach Nashville much sooner than\r\nGeneral Hood could possibly do from Florence, so that he was\r\nperfectly satisfied with his share of the army.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, with a full staff, I started from Kingston for\r\nAtlanta; and about noon of that day we reached Cartersville, and\r\nsat on the edge of a porch to rest, when the telegraph operator,\r\nMr. Van Valkenburg, or Eddy, got the wire down from the poles to\r\nhis lap, in which he held a small pocket instrument.  Calling\r\n\"Chattanooga,\" he received this message from General Thomas,\r\ndated--\r\n\r\n\r\nNASHVILLE, November 12, 1884--8.80 A.M.\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nYour dispatch of twelve o'clock last night is received.  I have no\r\nfears that Beauregard can do us any harm now, and, if he attempts\r\nto follow you, I will follow him as far as possible.  If he does\r\nnot follow you, I will then thoroughly organize my troops, and\r\nbelieve I shall have men enough to ruin him unless he gets out of\r\nthe way very rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe country of Middle Alabama, I learn, is teeming with supplies\r\nthis year, which will be greatly to our advantage.  I have no\r\nadditional news to report from the direction of Florence.\r\nI am now convinced that the greater part of Beauregard's army is\r\nnear Florence and Tuscumbia, and that you will have at least a\r\nclear road before you for several days, and that your success will\r\nfully equal your expectations.\r\n\r\nGeorge H.  THOMAS, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI answered simply: \"Dispatch received--all right.\"  About that\r\ninstant of time, some of our men burnt a bridge, which severed the\r\ntelegraph-wire, and all communication with the rear ceased\r\nthenceforth.\r\n\r\nAs we rode on toward Atlanta that night, I remember the railroad-\r\ntrains going to the rear with a furious speed; the engineers and\r\nthe few men about the trains waving us an affectionate adieu.  It\r\nsurely was a strange event--two hostile armies marching in opposite\r\ndirections, each in the full belief that it was achieving a final\r\nand conclusive result in a great war; and I was strongly inspired\r\nwith the feeling that the movement on our part was a direct attack\r\nupon the rebel army and the rebel capital at Richmond, though a\r\nfull thousand miles of hostile country intervened, and that, for\r\nbetter or worse, it would end the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH TO THE SEA FROM ATLANTA TO SAVANNAH.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications\r\nwith the rear were broken, and the army stood detached from all\r\nfriends, dependent on its own resources and supplies.  No time was\r\nto be lost; all the detachments were ordered to march rapidly for\r\nAtlanta, breaking up the railroad en route, and generally to so\r\ndamage the country as to make it untenable to the enemy.  By the\r\n14th all the troops had arrived at or near Atlanta, and were,\r\naccording to orders, grouped into two wings, the right and left,\r\ncommanded respectively by Major-Generals O. O. Howard and H. W.\r\nSlocum, both comparatively young men, but educated and experienced\r\nofficers, fully competent to their command.\r\n\r\nThe right wing was composed of the Fifteenth Corps, Major-General\r\nP. J. Osterhaus commanding, and the Seventeenth Corps,\r\nMajor-General Frank P. Blair commanding.\r\n\r\nThe left wing was composed of the Fourteenth Corps, Major-General\r\nJefferson C. Davis commanding, and the Twentieth Corps,\r\nBrigadier-General A. S. Williams commanding.\r\n\r\nThe Fifteenth Corps had four divisions, commanded by\r\nBrigadier-Generals Charles R. Woods, W. B. Hazen, John E. Smith,\r\nand John M. Gorse.\r\n\r\nThe Seventeenth Corps had three divisions, commanded by\r\nMajor-General J. A. Mower, and Brigadier-Generals M. D. Leggett\r\nand Giles A. Smith.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Corps had three divisions, commanded by\r\nBrigadier-Generals W. P. Carlin, James D. Morgan, and A. Baird.\r\n\r\nThe Twentieth Corps had also three divisions, commanded by\r\nBrigadier-Generals N. J. Jackson, John W. Geary, and W. T. Ward.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry division was held separate, subject to my own orders.\r\nIt was commanded by Brigadier-General Judson Kilpatrick, and was\r\ncomposed of two brigades, commanded by Colonels Eli H. Murray, of\r\nKentucky, and Smith D. Atkins, of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the army, as officially reported, is given in the\r\nfollowing tables, and shows an aggregate of fifty-five thousand\r\nthree hundred and twenty-nine infantry, five thousand and\r\nsixty-three cavalry, and eighteen hundred and twelve artillery in\r\nall, sixty-two thousand two hundred and four officers and men.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary efforts had been made to purge this army of\r\nnon-combatants and of sick men, for we knew well that there was to\r\nbe no place of safety save with the army itself; our wagons were\r\nloaded with ammunition, provisions, and forage, and we could ill\r\nafford to haul even sick men in the ambulances, so that all on this\r\nexhibit may be assumed to have been able-bodied, experienced\r\nsoldiers, well armed, well equipped and provided, as far as human\r\nforesight could, with all the essentials of life, strength, and\r\nvigorous action.\r\n\r\nThe two general orders made for this march appear to me, even at\r\nthis late day, so clear, emphatic, and well-digested, that no\r\naccount of that historic event is perfect without them, and I give\r\nthem entire, even at the seeming appearance of repetition; and,\r\nthough they called for great sacrifice and labor on the part of the\r\nofficers and men, I insist that these orders were obeyed as well as\r\nany similar orders ever were, by an army operating wholly in an\r\nenemy's country, and dispersed, as we necessarily were, during the\r\nsubsequent period of nearly six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No. 119.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, KINGSTON, GEORGIA, November 8, 1864\r\n\r\nThe general commanding deems it proper at this time to inform the\r\nofficers and men of the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and\r\nTwentieth Corps, that he has organized them into an army for a\r\nspecial purpose, well known to the War Department and to General\r\nGrant.  It is sufficient for you to know that it involves a\r\ndeparture from our present base, and a long and difficult march to\r\na new one.  All the chances of war have been considered and\r\nprovided for, as far as human sagacity can.  All he asks of you is\r\nto maintain that discipline, patience, and courage, which have\r\ncharacterized you in the past; and he hopes, through you, to strike\r\na blow at our enemy that will have a material effect in producing\r\nwhat we all so much desire, his complete overthrow.  Of all things,\r\nthe most important is, that the men, during marches and in camp,\r\nkeep their places and do not scatter about as stragglers or\r\nforagers, to be picked up by a hostile people in detail.  It is\r\nalso of the utmost importance that our wagons should not be loaded\r\nwith any thing but provisions and ammunition.  All surplus\r\nservants, noncombatants, and refugees, should now go to the rear,\r\nand none should be encouraged to encumber us on the march.  At some\r\nfuture time we will be able to provide for the poor whites and\r\nblacks who seek to escape the bondage under which they are now\r\nsuffering.  With these few simple cautions, he hopes to lead you to\r\nachievements equal in importance to those of the past.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\nL. M. DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No. 120.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, KINGSTON, GEORGIA, November 9, 1864\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  For the purpose of military operations, this army is divided\r\ninto two wings viz.:\r\n\r\nThe right wing, Major-General O. O. Howard commanding, composed of\r\nthe Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps; the left wing, Major-General\r\nH. W. Slocum commanding, composed of the Fourteenth and Twentieth\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\n2.  The habitual order of march will be, wherever practicable, by\r\nfour roads, as nearly parallel as possible, and converging at\r\npoints hereafter to be indicated in orders.  The cavalry,\r\nBrigadier-General Kilpatrick commanding, will receive special\r\norders from the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n3.  There will be no general train of supplies, but each corps will\r\nhave its ammunition-train and provision-train, distributed\r\nhabitually as follows: Behind each regiment should follow one wagon\r\nand one ambulance; behind each brigade should follow a due\r\nproportion of ammunition-wagons, provision-wagons, and ambulances.\r\nIn case of danger, each corps commander should change this order of\r\nmarch, by having his advance and rear brigades unencumbered by\r\nwheels.  The separate columns will start habitually at 7 A.M., and\r\nmake about fifteen miles per day, unless otherwise fixed in orders.\r\n\r\n4.  The army will forage liberally on the country during the march.\r\nTo this end, each brigade commander will organize a good and\r\nsufficient foraging party, under the command of one or more\r\ndiscreet officers, who will gather, near the route traveled, corn\r\nor forage of any kind, meat of any kind, vegetables, corn-meal, or\r\nwhatever is needed by the command, aiming at all times to keep in\r\nthe wagons at least ten days' provisions for his command, and three\r\ndays' forage.  Soldiers must not enter the dwellings of the\r\ninhabitants, or commit any trespass; but, during a halt or camp,\r\nthey may be permitted to gather turnips, potatoes, and other\r\nvegetables, and to drive in stock in sight of their camp.  To\r\nregular foraging-parties must be intrusted the gathering of\r\nprovisions and forage, at any distance from the road traveled.\r\n\r\n6.  To corps commanders alone is intrusted the power to destroy\r\nmills, houses, cotton-gins, etc.; and for them this general\r\nprinciple is laid down:\r\n\r\nIn districts and neighborhoods where the army is unmolested, no\r\ndestruction of each property should be permitted; but should\r\nguerrillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the\r\ninhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest\r\nlocal hostility, then army commanders should order and enforce a\r\ndevastation more or less relentless, according to the measure of\r\nsuch hostility.\r\n\r\n6.  As for horses, mules, wagons, etc., belonging to the\r\ninhabitants, the cavalry and artillery may appropriate freely and\r\nwithout limit; discriminating, however, between the rich, who are\r\nusually hostile, and the poor and industrious, usually neutral or\r\nfriendly.  Foraging-parties may also take mules or horses, to\r\nreplace the jaded animals of their trains, or to serve as\r\npack-mules for the regiments or brigades.  In all foraging, of\r\nwhatever kind, the parties engaged will refrain from abusive or\r\nthreatening language, and may, where the officer in command thinks\r\nproper, give written certificates of the facts, but no receipts;\r\nand they will endeavor to leave with each family a reasonable\r\nportion for their maintenance,\r\n\r\n7.  Negroes who are able-bodied and can be of service to the\r\nseveral columns may be taken along; but each army commander will\r\nbear in mind that the question of supplies is a very important one,\r\nand that his first duty is to see to those who bear arms.\r\n\r\n8.  The organization, at once, of a good pioneer battalion for each\r\narmy corps, composed if possible of negroes, should be attended to.\r\nThis battalion should follow the advance-guard, repair roads and\r\ndouble them if possible, so that the columns will not be delayed\r\nafter reaching bad places.  Also, army commanders should practise\r\nthe habit of giving the artillery and wagons the road, marching\r\ntheir troops on one side, and instruct their troops to assist\r\nwagons at steep hills or bad crossings of streams.\r\n\r\n9.  Captain O. M. Poe, chief-engineer, will assign to each wing of\r\nthe army a pontoon-train, fully equipped and organized; and the\r\ncommanders thereof will see to their being properly protected at\r\nall times.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\n\r\nL. M. DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest possible attention had been given to the artillery and\r\nwagon trains.  The number of guns had been reduced to sixty-five,\r\nor about one gun to each thousand men, and these were generally in\r\nbatteries of four guns each.\r\n\r\nEach gun, caisson, and forges was drawn by four teams of horses.\r\nWe had in all about twenty-five hundred wagons, with teams of six\r\nmules to each, and six hundred ambulances, with two horses to each.\r\nThe loads were made comparatively light, about twenty-five hundred\r\npounds net; each wagon carrying in addition the forage needed by\r\nits own team: Each soldier carried on his person forty rounds of\r\nammunition, and in the wagons were enough cartridges to make up\r\nabout two hundred rounds per man, and in like manner two hundred\r\nrounds of assorted ammunition were carried for each gun.\r\n\r\nThe wagon-trains were divided equally between the four corps, so\r\nthat each had about eight hundred wagons, and these usually on the\r\nmarch occupied five miles or more of road.  Each corps commander\r\nmanaged his own train; and habitually the artillery and wagons had\r\nthe road, while the men, with the exception of the advance and rear\r\nguards, pursued paths improvised by the aide of the wagons, unless\r\nthey were forced to use a bridge or causeway in common.\r\n\r\nI reached Atlanta during the afternoon of the 14th, and found that\r\nall preparations had been made-Colonel Beckwith, chief commissary,\r\nreporting one million two hundred thousand rations in possession of\r\nthe troops, which was about twenty days' supply, and he had on hand\r\na good supply of beef-cattle to be driven along on the hoof.  Of\r\nforage, the supply was limited, being of oats and corn enough for\r\nfive days, but I knew that within that time we would reach a\r\ncountry well stocked with corn, which had been gathered and stored\r\nin cribs, seemingly for our use, by Governor Brown's militia.\r\n\r\nColonel Poe, United States Engineers, of my staff, had been busy in\r\nhis special task of destruction.  He had a large force at work, had\r\nleveled the great depot, round house, and the machine-shops of the\r\nGeorgia Railroad, and had applied fire to the wreck.  One of these\r\nmachine-shops had been used by the rebels as an arsenal, and in it\r\nwere stored piles of shot and shell, some of which proved to be\r\nloaded, and that night was made hideous by the bursting of shells,\r\nwhose fragments came uncomfortably, near Judge Lyon's house, in\r\nwhich I was quartered. The fire also reached the block of stores\r\nnear the depot, and the heart of the city was in flames all night,\r\nbut the fire did not reach the parts of Atlanta where the\r\ncourt-house was, or the great mass of dwelling houses.\r\n\r\nThe march from Atlanta began on the morning of November 15th, the\r\nright wing and cavalry following the railroad southeast toward\r\nJonesboro', and General Slocum with the Twentieth Corps leading off\r\nto the east by Decatur and Stone Mountain, toward Madison.  These\r\nwere divergent lines, designed to threaten both Mason and Augusta\r\nat the same time, so as to prevent a concentration at our intended\r\ndestination, or \"objective,\" Milledgeville, the capital of Georgia,\r\ndistant southeast about one hundred miles.  The time allowed each\r\ncolumn for reaching Milledgeville was seven days.  I remained in\r\nAtlanta during the 15th with the Fourteenth Corps, and the\r\nrear-guard of the right wing, to complete the loading of the trains,\r\nand the destruction of the buildings of Atlanta which could be\r\nconverted to hostile uses, and on the morning of the 16th started\r\nwith my personal staff, a company of Alabama cavalry, commanded by\r\nLieutenant Snelling, and an infantry company, commanded by Lieutenant\r\nMcCrory, which guarded our small train of wagons.\r\n\r\nMy staff was then composed of Major L. M. Dayton, aide-de-camp and\r\nacting adjutant-general, Major J. C. McCoy, and Major J. C.\r\nAudenried, aides.  Major Ward Nichols had joined some weeks before\r\nat Gaylesville, Alabama, and was attached as an acting\r\naide-de-camp.  Also Major Henry Hitchcock had joined at the same\r\ntime as judge-advocate.  Colonel Charles Ewing was\r\ninspector-general, and Surgeon John Moore medical director.  These\r\nconstituted our mess.  We had no tents, only the flies, with which\r\nwe nightly made bivouacs with the assistance of the abundant\r\npine-boughs, which made excellent shelter, as well as beds.\r\n\r\nColonel L. C. Easton was chief-quartermaster; Colonel Amos\r\nBeckwith, chief-commissary; Colonel O. M. Poe, chief-engineer; and\r\nColonel T. G. Baylor, chief of ordnance.  These invariably rode\r\nwith us during the day, but they had a separate camp and mess at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nGeneral William F.  Barry had been chief of artillery in the\r\nprevious campaign, but at Kingston his face was so swollen with\r\nerysipelas that he was reluctantly compelled to leave us for the\r\nrear; and he could not, on recovering, rejoin us till we had\r\nreached Savannah.\r\n\r\nAbout 7 A.M. of November 16th we rode out of Atlanta by the Decatur\r\nroad, filled by the marching troops and wagons of the Fourteenth\r\nCorps; and reaching the hill, just outside of the old rebel works,\r\nwe naturally paused to look back upon the scenes of our past\r\nbattles.  We stood upon the very ground whereon was fought the\r\nbloody battle of July 22d, and could see the copse of wood where\r\nMcPherson fell.  Behind us lay Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins,\r\nthe black smoke rising high in air, and hanging like a pall over\r\nthe ruined city.  Away off in the distance, on the McDonough road,\r\nwas the rear of Howard's column, the gun-barrels glistening in the\r\nsun, the white-topped wagons stretching away to the south; and\r\nright before us the Fourteenth Corps, marching steadily and\r\nrapidly, with a cheery look and swinging pace, that made light of\r\nthe thousand miles that lay between us and Richmond.  Some band, by\r\naccident, struck up the anthem of \"John Brown's soul goes marching\r\non;\" the men caught up the strain, and never before or since have I\r\nheard the chorus of \"Glory, glory, hallelujah!\" done with more\r\nspirit, or in better harmony of time and place.\r\n\r\nThen we turned our horses' heads to the east; Atlanta was soon lost\r\nbehind the screen of trees, and became a thing of the past.  Around\r\nit clings many a thought of desperate battle, of hope and fear,\r\nthat now seem like the memory of a dream; and I have never seen the\r\nplace since.  The day was extremely beautiful, clear sunlight, with\r\nbracing air, and an unusual feeling of exhilaration seemed to\r\npervade all minds--a feeling of something to come, vague and\r\nundefined, still full of venture and intense interest.  Even the\r\ncommon soldiers caught the inspiration, and many a group called out\r\nto me as I worked my way past them, \"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is\r\nwaiting for us at Richmond!\"  Indeed, the general sentiment was\r\nthat we were marching for Richmond, and that there we should end\r\nthe war, but how and when they seemed to care not; nor did they\r\nmeasure the distance, or count the cost in life, or bother their\r\nbrains about the great rivers to be crossed, and the food required\r\nfor man and beast, that had to be gathered by the way.  There was a\r\n\"devil-may-care\" feeling pervading officers and men, that made me\r\nfeel the full load of responsibility, for success would be accepted\r\nas a matter of course, whereas, should we fail, this \"march\" would\r\nbe adjudged the wild adventure of a crazy fool.  I had no purpose\r\nto march direct for Richmond by way of Augusta and Charlotte, but\r\nalways designed to reach the sea-coast first at Savannah or Port\r\nRoyal, South Carolina, and even kept in mind the alternative of\r\nPensacola.\r\n\r\nThe first night out we camped by the road-side near Lithonia.\r\nStone Mountain, a mass of granite, was in plain view, cut out in\r\nclear outline against the blue sky; the whole horizon was lurid\r\nwith the bonfires of rail-ties, and groups of men all night were\r\ncarrying the heated rails to the nearest trees, and bending them\r\naround the trunks.  Colonel Poe had provided tools for ripping up\r\nthe rails and twisting them when hot; but the best and easiest way\r\nis the one I have described, of heating the middle of the\r\niron-rails on bonfires made of the cross-ties, and then winding\r\nthem around a telegraph-pole or the trunk of some convenient\r\nsapling.  I attached much importance to this destruction of the\r\nrailroad, gave it my own personal attention, and made reiterated\r\norders to others on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe next day we passed through the handsome town of Covington, the\r\nsoldiers closing up their ranks, the color-bearers unfurling their\r\nflags, and the bands striking up patriotic airs.  The white people\r\ncame out of their houses to behold the sight, spite of their deep\r\nhatred of the invaders, and the negroes were simply frantic with\r\njoy.  Whenever they heard my name, they clustered about my horse,\r\nshouted and prayed in their peculiar style, which had a natural\r\neloquence that would have moved a stone.  I have witnessed\r\nhundreds, if not thousands, of such scenes; and can now see a poor\r\ngirl, in the very ecstasy of the Methodist \"shout,\" hugging the\r\nbanner of one of the regiments, and jumping up to the \"feet of\r\nJesus.\"\r\n\r\nI remember, when riding around by a by-street in Covington, to\r\navoid the crowd that followed the marching column, that some one\r\nbrought me an invitation to dine with a sister of Sam. Anderson,\r\nwho was a cadet at West Point with me; but the messenger reached me\r\nafter we had passed the main part of the town.  I asked to be\r\nexcused, and rode on to a place designated for camp, at the\r\ncrossing of the Ulcofauhachee River, about four miles to the east\r\nof the town.  Here we made our bivouac, and I walked up to a\r\nplantation-house close by, where were assembled many negroes, among\r\nthem an old, gray-haired man, of as fine a head as I ever saw.  I\r\nasked him if he understood about the war and its progress.  He said\r\nhe did; that he had been looking for the \"angel of the Lord\" ever\r\nsince he was knee-high, and, though we professed to be fighting for\r\nthe Union, he supposed that slavery was the cause, and that our\r\nsuccess was to be his freedom.  I asked him if all the negro slaves\r\ncomprehended this fact, and he said they surely did.  I then\r\nexplained to him that we wanted the slaves to remain where they\r\nwere, and not to load us down with useless mouths, which would eat\r\nup the food needed for our fighting men; that our success was their\r\nassured freedom; that we could receive a few of their young, hearty\r\nmen as pioneers; but that, if they followed us in swarms of old and\r\nyoung, feeble and helpless, it would simply load us down and\r\ncripple us in our great task.  I think Major Henry Hitchcock was\r\nwith me on that occasion, and made a note of the conversation, and\r\nI believe that old man spread this message to the slaves, which was\r\ncarried from mouth to mouth, to the very end of our journey, and\r\nthat it in part saved us from the great danger we incurred of\r\nswelling our numbers so that famine would have attended our\r\nprogress.  It was at this very plantation that a soldier passed me\r\nwith a ham on his musket, a jug of sorghum-molasses under his arm,\r\nand a big piece of honey in his hand, from which he was eating,\r\nand, catching my eye, he remarked sotto voce and carelessly to a\r\ncomrade, \"Forage liberally on the country,\" quoting from my general\r\norders.  On this occasion, as on many others that fell under my\r\npersonal observation, I reproved the man, explained that foraging\r\nmust be limited to the regular parties properly detailed, and that\r\nall provisions thus obtained must be delivered to the regular\r\ncommissaries, to be fairly distributed to the men who kept their\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nFrom Covington the Fourteenth Corps (Davis's), with which I was\r\ntraveling, turned to the right for Milledgeville, via Shady Dale.\r\nGeneral Slocum was ahead at Madison, with the Twentieth Corps,\r\nhaving torn up the railroad as far as that place, and thence had\r\nsent Geary's division on to the Oconee, to burn the bridges across\r\nthat stream, when this corps turned south by Eatonton, for\r\nMilledgeville, the common \"objective\" for the first stage of the\r\n\"march.\"  We found abundance of corn, molasses, meal, bacon, and\r\nsweet-potatoes.  We also took a good many cows and oxen, and a\r\nlarge number of mules.  In all these the country was quite rich,\r\nnever before having been visited by a hostile army; the recent crop\r\nhad been excellent, had been just gathered and laid by for the\r\nwinter.  As a rule, we destroyed none, but kept our wagons full,\r\nand fed our teams bountifully.\r\n\r\nThe skill and success of the men in collecting forage was one of\r\nthe features of this march.  Each brigade commander had authority\r\nto detail a company of foragers, usually about fifty men, with one\r\nor two commissioned officers selected for their boldness and\r\nenterprise.  This party would be dispatched before daylight with a\r\nknowledge of the intended day's march and camp; would proceed on\r\nfoot five or six miles from the route traveled by their brigade,\r\nand then visit every plantation and farm within range.  They would\r\nusually procure a wagon or family carriage, load it with bacon,\r\ncorn-meal, turkeys, chickens, ducks, and every thing that could be\r\nused as food or forage, and would then regain the main road,\r\nusually in advance of their train.  When this came up, they would\r\ndeliver to the brigade commissary the supplies thus gathered by the\r\nway.  Often would I pass these foraging-parties at the roadside,\r\nwaiting for their wagons to come up, and was amused at their\r\nstrange collections--mules, horses, even cattle, packed with old\r\nsaddles and loaded with hams, bacon, bags of cornmeal, and poultry\r\nof every character and description.  Although this foraging was\r\nattended with great danger and hard work, there seemed to be a\r\ncharm about it that attracted the soldiers, and it was a privilege\r\nto be detailed on such a party.  Daily they returned mounted on all\r\nsorts of beasts, which were at once taken from them and\r\nappropriated to the general use; but the next day they would start\r\nout again on foot, only to repeat the experience of the day before.\r\nNo doubt, many acts of pillage, robbery, and violence, were\r\ncommitted by these parties of foragers, usually called \"bummers;\"\r\nfor I have since heard of jewelry taken from women, and the plunder\r\nof articles that never reached the commissary; but these acts were\r\nexceptional and incidental.  I never heard of any cases of murder\r\nor rape; and no army could have carried along sufficient food and\r\nforage for a march of three hundred miles; so that foraging in some\r\nshape was necessary.  The country was sparsely settled, with no\r\nmagistrates or civil authorities who could respond to requisitions,\r\nas is done in all the wars of Europe; so that this system of\r\nforaging was simply indispensable to our success.  By it our men\r\nwere well supplied with all the essentials of life and health,\r\nwhile the wagons retained enough in case of unexpected delay, and\r\nour animals were well fed.  Indeed, when we reached Savannah, the\r\ntrains were pronounced by experts to be the finest in flesh and\r\nappearance ever seen with any army.\r\n\r\nHabitually each corps followed some main road, and the foragers,\r\nbeing kept out on the exposed flank, served all the military uses\r\nof flankers.  The main columns gathered, by the roads traveled,\r\nmuch forage and food, chiefly meat, corn, and sweet-potatoes, and\r\nit was the duty of each division and brigade quartermaster to fill\r\nhis wagons as fast as the contents were issued to the troops.  The\r\nwagon-trains had the right to the road always, but each wagon was\r\nrequired to keep closed up, so as to leave no gaps in the column.\r\nIf for any purpose any wagon or group of wagons dropped out of\r\nplace, they had to wait for the rear.  And this was always dreaded,\r\nfor each brigade commander wanted his train up at camp as soon\r\nafter reaching it with his men as possible.\r\n\r\nI have seen much skill and industry displayed by these\r\nquarter-masters on the march, in trying to load their wagons with\r\ncorn and fodder by the way without losing their place in column.\r\nThey would, while marching, shift the loads of wagons, so as to have\r\nsix or ten of them empty.  Then, riding well ahead, they would secure\r\npossession of certain stacks of fodder near the road, or cribs of\r\ncorn, leave some men in charge, then open fences and a road back for\r\na couple of miles, return to their trains, divert the empty wagons\r\nout of column, and conduct them rapidly to their forage, load up and\r\nregain their place in column without losing distance. On one occasion\r\nI remember to have seen ten or a dozen wagons thus loaded with corn\r\nfrom two or three full cribs, almost without halting.  These cribs\r\nwere built of logs, and roofed.  The train-guard, by a lever, had\r\nraised the whole side of the crib a foot or two; the wagons drove\r\nclose alongside, and the men in the cribs, lying on their backs,\r\nkicked out a wagon-load of corn in the time I have taken to describe\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn a well-ordered and well-disciplined army, these things might be\r\ndeemed irregular, but I am convinced that the ingenuity of these\r\nyounger officers accomplished many things far better than I could\r\nhave ordered, and the marches were thus made, and the distances\r\nwere accomplished, in the most admirable way.  Habitually we\r\nstarted from camp at the earliest break of dawn, and usually\r\nreached camp soon after noon.  The marches varied from ten to\r\nfifteen miles a day, though sometimes on extreme flanks it was\r\nnecessary to make as much as twenty, but the rate of travel was\r\nregulated by the wagons; and, considering the nature of the roads,\r\nfifteen miles per day was deemed the limit.\r\n\r\nThe pontoon-trains were in like manner distributed in about equal\r\nproportions to the four corps, giving each a section of about nine\r\nhundred feet.  The pontoons were of the skeleton pattern, with\r\ncotton-canvas covers, each boat, with its proportion of balks and\r\ncheeses, constituting a load for one wagon.  By uniting two such\r\nsections together, we could make a bridge of eighteen hundred feet,\r\nenough for any river we had to traverse; but habitually the leading\r\nbrigade would, out of the abundant timber, improvise a bridge\r\nbefore the pontoon-train could come up, unless in the cases of\r\nrivers of considerable magnitude, such as the Ocmulgee, Oconee,\r\nOgeechee, Savannah, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November I was still with the Fourteenth Corps, near\r\nEatonton Factory, waiting to hear of the Twentieth Corps; and on\r\nthe 21st we camped near the house of a man named Mann; the next\r\nday, about 4 p.m., General Davis had halted his head of column on a\r\nwooded ridge, overlooking an extensive slope of cultivated country,\r\nabout ten miles short of Milledgeville, and was deploying his\r\ntroops for camp when I got up.  There was a high, raw wind blowing,\r\nand I asked him why he had chosen so cold and bleak a position.  He\r\nexplained that he had accomplished his full distance for the day,\r\nand had there an abundance of wood and water.  He explained further\r\nthat his advance-guard was a mile or so ahead; so I rode on, asking\r\nhim to let his rear division, as it came up, move some distance\r\nahead into the depression or valley beyond.  Riding on some\r\ndistance to the border of a plantation, I turned out of the main\r\nroad into a cluster of wild-plum bushes, that broke the force of\r\nthe cold November wind, dismounted, and instructed the staff to\r\npick out the place for our camp.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was unusually raw and cold.  My orderly was at hand\r\nwith his invariable saddle-bags, which contained a change of\r\nunder-clothing, my maps, a flask of whiskey, and bunch of cigars.\r\nTaking a drink and lighting a cigar, I walked to a row of\r\nnegro-huts close by, entered one and found a soldier or two warming\r\nthemselves by a wood-fire.  I took their place by the fire,\r\nintending to wait there till our wagons had got up, and a camp made\r\nfor the night.  I was talking to the old negro woman, when some one\r\ncame and explained to me that, if I would come farther down the\r\nroad, I could find a better place.  So I started on foot, and found\r\non the main road a good double-hewed-log house, in one room of\r\nwhich Colonel Poe, Dr. Moore, and others, had started a fire.  I\r\nsent back orders to the \"plum-bushes\" to bring our horses and\r\nsaddles up to this house, and an orderly to conduct our headquarter\r\nwagons to the same place.  In looking around the room, I saw a\r\nsmall box, like a candle-box, marked \"Howell Cobb,\" and, on\r\ninquiring of a negro, found that we were at the plantation of\r\nGeneral Howell Cobb, of Georgia, one of the leading rebels of the\r\nSouth, then a general in the Southern army, and who had been\r\nSecretary of the United States Treasury in Mr. Buchanan's time.  Of\r\ncourse, we confiscated his property, and found it rich in corn,\r\nbeans, pea-nuts, and sorghum-molasses.  Extensive fields were all\r\nround the house; I sent word back to General David to explain whose\r\nplantation it was, and instructed him to spare nothing.  That night\r\nhuge bonfires consumed the fence-rails, kept our soldiers warm, and\r\nthe teamsters and men, as well as the slaves, carried off an\r\nimmense quantity of corn and provisions of all sorts.\r\n\r\nIn due season the headquarter wagons came up, and we got supper.\r\nAfter supper I sat on a chair astride, with my back to a good fire,\r\nmusing, and became conscious that an old negro, with a\r\ntallow-candle in his hand, was scanning my face closely.  I inquired,\r\n\"What do you want, old man!\"  He answered, \"Dey say you is Massa\r\nSherman.\"  I answered that such was the case, and inquired what he\r\nwanted.  He only wanted to look at me, and kept muttering, \"Dis\r\nnigger can't sleep dis night.\"  I asked him why he trembled so, and\r\nhe said that he wanted to be sure that we were in fact \"Yankees,\"\r\nfor on a former occasion some rebel cavalry had put on light-blue\r\novercoats, personating Yankee troops, and many of the negroes were\r\ndeceived thereby, himself among the number had shown them sympathy,\r\nand had in consequence been unmercifully beaten therefor.  This\r\ntime he wanted to be certain before committing himself; so I told\r\nhim to go out on the porch, from which he could see the whole\r\nhorizon lit up with camp-fires, and he could then judge whether he\r\nhad ever seen any thing like it before.  The old man became\r\nconvinced that the \"Yankees\" had come at last, about whom he had\r\nbeen dreaming all his life; and some of the staff officers gave him\r\na strong drink of whiskey, which set his tongue going.  Lieutenant\r\nSpelling, who commanded my escort, was a Georgian, and recognized\r\nin this old negro a favorite slave of his uncle, who resided about\r\nsix miles off; but the old slave did not at first recognize his\r\nyoung master in our uniform.  One of my staff-officers asked him\r\nwhat had become of his young master, George.  He did not know, only\r\nthat he had gone off to the war, and he supposed him killed, as a\r\nmatter of course.  His attention was then drawn to Spelling's face,\r\nwhen he fell on his knees and thanked God that he had found his\r\nyoung master alive and along with the Yankees.  Spelling inquired\r\nall about his uncle and the family, asked my permission to go and\r\npay his uncle a visit, which I granted, of course, and the next\r\nmorning he described to me his visit.  The uncle was not cordial,\r\nby any means, to find his nephew in the ranks of the host that was\r\ndesolating the land, and Spelling came back, having exchanged his\r\ntired horse for a fresher one out of his uncle's stables,\r\nexplaining that surely some of the \"bummers\" would have got the\r\nhorse had he not.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, November 23d, we rode into Milledgeville, the\r\ncapital of the State, whither the Twentieth Corps had preceded us;\r\nand during that day the left wing was all united, in and around\r\nMilledgeville.  From the inhabitants we learned that some of\r\nKilpatrick's cavalry had preceded us by a couple of days, and that\r\nall of the right wing was at and near Gordon, twelve miles off,\r\nviz., the place where the branch railroad came to Milledgeville\r\nfrom the Mason & Savannah road.  The first stage of the journey\r\nwas, therefore, complete, and absolutely successful.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard soon reported by letter the operations of his right\r\nwing, which, on leaving Atlanta, had substantially followed the two\r\nroads toward Mason, by Jonesboro' and McDonough, and reached the\r\nOcmulgee at Planters' Factory, which they crossed, by the aid of\r\nthe pontoon-train, during the 18th and 19th of November.  Thence,\r\nwith the Seventeenth Corps (General Blair's) he (General Howard)\r\nhad marched via Monticello toward Gordon, having dispatched\r\nKilpatrick's cavalry, supported by the Fifteenth Corps\r\n(Osterhaus's), to feign on Mason.  Kilpatrick met the enemy's\r\ncavalry about four miles out of Mason, and drove them rapidly back\r\ninto the bridge-defenses held by infantry.  Kilpatrick charged\r\nthese, got inside the parapet, but could not hold it, and retired\r\nto his infantry supports, near Griswold Station.  The Fifteenth\r\nCorps tore up the railroad-track eastward from Griswold, leaving\r\nCharles R.  Wood's division behind as a rear-guard-one brigade of\r\nwhich was intrenched across the road, with some of Kilpatrick's\r\ncavalry on the flanks.  On the 22d of November General G. W. Smith,\r\nwith a division of troops, came out of Mason, attacked this brigade\r\n(Walcutt's) in position, and was handsomely repulsed and driven\r\nback into Mason.  This brigade was in part armed with Spencer\r\nrepeating-rifles, and its fire was so rapid that General Smith\r\ninsists to this day that he encountered a whole division; but he is\r\nmistaken; he was beaten by one brigade (Walcutt's), and made no\r\nfurther effort to molest our operations from that direction.\r\nGeneral Walcutt was wounded in the leg, and had to ride the rest of\r\nthe distance to Savannah in a carriage.\r\n\r\nTherefore, by the 23d, I was in Milledgeville with the left wing,\r\nand was in full communication with the right wing at Gordon.  The\r\npeople of Milledgeville remained at home, except the Governor\r\n(Brown), the State officers, and Legislature, who had ignominiously\r\nfled, in the utmost disorder and confusion; standing not on the\r\norder of their going, but going at once--some by rail, some by\r\ncarriages, and many on foot.  Some of the citizens who remained\r\nbehind described this flight of the \"brave and patriotic\" Governor\r\nBrown.  He had occupied a public building known as the \"Governor's\r\nMansion,\" and had hastily stripped it of carpets, curtains, and\r\nfurniture of all sorts, which were removed to a train of\r\nfreight-cars, which carried away these things--even the cabbages and\r\nvegetables from his kitchen and cellar--leaving behind muskets,\r\nammunition, and the public archives.  On arrival at Milledgeville I\r\noccupied the same public mansion, and was soon overwhelmed with\r\nappeals for protection.  General Slocum had previously arrived with\r\nthe Twentieth Corps, had taken up his quarters at the Milledgeville\r\nHotel, established a good provost-guard, and excellent order was\r\nmaintained.  The most frantic appeals had been made by the Governor\r\nand Legislature for help from every quarter, and the people of the\r\nState had been called out en masse to resist and destroy the invaders\r\nof their homes and firesides.  Even the prisoners and convicts of the\r\npenitentiary were released on condition of serving as soldiers, and\r\nthe cadets were taken from their military college for the same\r\npurpose.  These constituted a small battalion, under General Harry\r\nWayne, a former officer of the United States Army, and son of the\r\nthen Justice Wayne of the Supreme Court.  But these hastily retreated\r\neast across the Oconee River, leaving us a good bridge, which we\r\npromptly secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Milledgeville we found newspapers from all the South, and\r\nlearned the consternation which had filled the Southern mind at our\r\ntemerity; many charging that we were actually fleeing for our lives\r\nand seeking safety at the hands of our fleet on the sea-coast.  All\r\ndemanded that we should be assailed, \"front, flank, and rear;\" that\r\nprovisions should be destroyed in advance, so that we would starve;\r\nthat bridges should be burned, roads obstructed, and no mercy shown\r\nus.  Judging from the tone of the Southern press of that day, the\r\noutside world must have supposed us ruined and lost.  I give a few\r\nof these appeals as samples, which to-day must sound strange to the\r\nparties who made them:\r\n\r\n\r\nCorinth, Mississippi, November 18, 1884.\r\n\r\nTo the People of Georgia:\r\n\r\n\r\nArise for the defense of your native soil!  Rally around your\r\npatriotic Governor and gallant soldiers!  Obstruct and destroy all\r\nthe roads in Sherman's front, flank, and rear, and his army will\r\nsoon starve in your midst. Be confident.  Be resolute.  Trust in an\r\noverruling Providence, and success will soon crown your efforts.  I\r\nhasten to join you in the defense of your homes and firesides.\r\n\r\nG.  T.  BEAUREGARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, November 18, 1884.\r\n\r\nTo the People of Georgia:\r\n\r\nYou have now the best opportunity ever yet presented to destroy the\r\nenemy.  Put every thing at the disposal of our generals; remove all\r\nprovisions from the path of the invader, and put all obstructions\r\nin his path.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen with his gun, and every negro with his spade and axe,\r\ncan do the work of a soldier.  You can destroy the enemy by\r\nretarding his march.\r\n\r\nGeorgians, be firm!  Act promptly, and fear not!\r\n\r\nB. H. Hill, Senator.\r\n\r\nI most cordially approve the above.\r\nJames A. SEDDON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichmond, November 19,1864.\r\n\r\nTo the People of Georgia:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have had a special conference with President Davis and the\r\nSecretary of War, and are able to assure you that they have done\r\nand are still doing all that can be done to meet the emergency that\r\npresses upon you.  Let every man fly to arms! Remove your negroes,\r\nhorses, cattle, and provisions from Sherman's army, and burn what\r\nyou cannot carry.  Burn all bridges, and block up the roads in his\r\nroute.  Assail the invader in front, flank, and rear, by night and\r\nby day.  Let him have no rest.\r\n\r\nJULIAN HARTRIDGE\r\nMARK BLANDFORD,\r\nJ. H. ECHOLS\r\nGEO. N. LESTER\r\nJOHN T. SHUEMAKER\r\nJAS. M. SMITH,\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, we were rather amused than alarmed at these threats, and\r\nmade light of the feeble opposition offered to our progress.  Some\r\nof the officers (in the spirit of mischief) gathered together in\r\nthe vacant hall of Representatives, elected a Speaker, and\r\nconstituted themselves the Legislature of the State of Georgia!  A\r\nproposition was made to repeal the ordinance of secession, which\r\nwas well debated, and resulted in its repeal by a fair vote!  I was\r\nnot present at these frolics, but heard of them at the time, and\r\nenjoyed the joke.\r\n\r\nMeantime orders were made for the total destruction of the arsenal\r\nand its contents, and of such public buildings as could be easily\r\nconverted to hostile uses.  But little or no damage was done to\r\nprivate property, and General Slocum, with my approval, spared\r\nseveral mills, and many thousands of bales of cotton, taking what\r\nhe knew to be worthless bonds, that the cotton should not be used\r\nfor the Confederacy.  Meantime the right wing continued its\r\nmovement along the railroad toward Savannah, tearing up the track\r\nand destroying its iron.  At the Oconee was met a feeble resistance\r\nfrom Harry Wayne's troops, but soon the pontoon-bridge was laid,\r\nand that wing crossed over.  Gilpatrick's cavalry was brought into\r\nMilledgeville, and crossed the Oconee by the bridge near the town;\r\nand on the 23d I made the general orders for the next stage of the\r\nmarch as far as Millen.  These were, substantially, for the right\r\nwing to follow the Savannah Railroad, by roads on its south; the\r\nleft wing was to move to Sandersville, by Davisboro' and\r\nLouisville, while the cavalry was ordered by a circuit to the\r\nnorth, and to march rapidly for Millen, to rescue our prisoners of\r\nwar confined there.  The distance was about a hundred miles.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wheeler, with his division of rebel cavalry, had succeeded\r\nin getting ahead of us between Milledgeville and Augusta, and\r\nGeneral P. J. Hardee had been dispatched by General Beauregard from\r\nHood's army to oppose our progress directly in front.  He had,\r\nhowever, brought with him no troops, but relied on his influence\r\nwith the Georgians (of whose State he was a native) to arouse the\r\npeople, and with them to annihilate Sherman's army!\r\n\r\nOn the 24th we renewed the march, and I accompanied the Twentieth\r\nCorps, which took the direct road to Sandersville, which we reached\r\nsimultaneously with the Fourteenth Corps, on the 26th.  A brigade\r\nof rebel cavalry was deployed before the town, and was driven in\r\nand through it by our skirmish-line.  I myself saw the rebel cavalry\r\napply fire to stacks of fodder standing in the fields at\r\nSandersville, and gave orders to burn some unoccupied dwellings\r\nclose by.  On entering the town, I told certain citizens (who would\r\nbe sure to spread the report) that, if the enemy attempted to carry\r\nout their threat to burn their food, corn, and fodder, in our\r\nroute, I would most undoubtedly execute to the letter the general\r\norders of devastation made at the outset of the campaign.  With\r\nthis exception, and one or two minor cases near Savannah, the\r\npeople did not destroy food, for they saw clearly that it would be\r\nruin to themselves.\r\n\r\nAt Sandersville I halted the left wing until I heard that the right\r\nwing was abreast of us on the railroad.  During the evening a negro\r\nwas brought to me, who had that day been to the station (Tenille),\r\nabout six miles south of the town.  I inquired of him if there were\r\nany Yankees there, and he answered, \"Yes.\"  He described in his own\r\nway what he had seen.\r\n\r\n\"First, there come along some cavalry-men, and they burned the\r\ndepot; then come along some infantry-men, and they tore up the\r\ntrack, and burned it;\" and just before he left they had \"sot fire\r\nto the well.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, viz., the 27th, I rode down to the station, and\r\nfound General Corse's division (of the Fifteenth Corps) engaged in\r\ndestroying the railroad, and saw the well which my negro informant\r\nhad seen \"burnt.\"  It was a square pit about twenty-five feet deep,\r\nboarded up, with wooden steps leading to the bottom, wherein was a\r\nfine copper pump, to lift the water to a tank above.  The soldiers\r\nhad broken up the pump, heaved in the steps and lining, and set\r\nfire to the mass of lumber in the bottom of the well, which\r\ncorroborated the negro's description.\r\n\r\nFrom this point Blair's corps, the Seventeenth, took up the work of\r\ndestroying the railroad, the Fifteenth Corps following another road\r\nleading eastward, farther to the south of the railroad.  While the\r\nleft wing was marching toward Louisville, north of the railroad,\r\nGeneral Kilpatrick had, with his cavalry division, moved rapidly\r\ntoward Waynesboro', on the branch railroad leading from Millen to\r\nAugusta.  He found Wheeler's division of rebel cavalry there, and\r\nhad considerable skirmishing with it; but, learning that our\r\nprisoners had been removed two days before from Millen, he returned\r\nto Louisville on the 29th, where he found the left wing.  Here he\r\nremained a couple of days to rest his horses, and, receiving orders\r\nfrom me to engage Wheeler and give him all the fighting he wanted,\r\nhe procured from General Slocum the assistance of the infantry\r\ndivision of General Baird, and moved back for Waynesboro' on the 2d\r\nof December, the remainder of the left wing continuing its march on\r\ntoward Millers.  Near Waynesboro' Wheeler was again encountered,\r\nand driven through the town and beyond Brier Creek, toward Augusta,\r\nthus keeping up the delusion that the main army was moving toward\r\nAugusta.  General Kilpatrick's fighting and movements about\r\nWaynesboro' and Brier Creek were spirited, and produced a good\r\neffect by relieving the infantry column and the wagon-trains of all\r\nmolestation during their march on Millen.  Having thus covered that\r\nflank, he turned south and followed the movement of the Fourteenth\r\nCorps to Buckhead Church, north of Millen and near it.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of December I entered Millen with the Seventeenth Corps\r\n(General Frank P.  Blair), and there paused one day, to communicate\r\nwith all parts of the army.  General Howard was south of the\r\nOgeechee River, with the Fifteenth Corps, opposite Scarboro'.\r\nGeneral Slocum was at Buckhead Church, four miles north of Millen,\r\nwith the Twentieth Corps.  The Fourteenth (General Davis) was at\r\nLumpkin's Station, on the Augusta road, about ten miles north of\r\nMillen, and the cavalry division was within easy support of this\r\nwing.  Thus the whole army was in good position and in good\r\ncondition.  We had largely subsisted on the country; our wagons\r\nwere full of forage and provisions; but, as we approached the\r\nsea-coast, the country became more sandy and barren, and food\r\nbecame more scarce; still, with little or no loss, we had traveled\r\ntwo-thirds of our distance, and I concluded to push on for\r\nSavannah.  At Millen I learned that General Bragg was in Augusta,\r\nand that General Wade Hampton had been ordered there from Richmond,\r\nto organize a large cavalry force with which to resist our\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hardee was ahead, between us and Savannah, with McLaw's\r\ndivision, and other irregular troops, that could not, I felt\r\nassured, exceed ten thousand men.  I caused the fine depot at\r\nMillen to be destroyed, and other damage done, and then resumed the\r\nmarch directly on Savannah, by the four main roads.  The Seventeenth\r\nCorps (General Blair) followed substantially the railroad,\r\nand, along with it, on the 5th of December, I reached Ogeechee\r\nChurch, about fifty miles from Savannah, and found there fresh\r\nearthworks, which had been thrown up by McLaw's division; but he\r\nmust have seen that both his flanks were being turned, and\r\nprudently retreated to Savannah without a fight.  All the columns\r\nthen pursued leisurely their march toward Savannah, corn and forage\r\nbecoming more and more scarce, but rice-fields beginning to occur\r\nalong the Savannah and Ogeechee Rivers, which proved a good\r\nsubstitute, both as food and forage.  The weather was fine, the\r\nroads good, and every thing seemed to favor us.  Never do I recall\r\na more agreeable sensation than the sight of our camps by night,\r\nlit up by the fires of fragrant pine-knots.  The trains were all in\r\ngood order, and the men seemed to march their fifteen miles a day\r\nas though it were nothing.  No enemy opposed us, and we could only\r\noccasionally hear the faint reverberation of a gun to our left\r\nrear, where we knew that General Kilpatrick was skirmishing with\r\nWheeler's cavalry, which persistently followed him.  But the\r\ninfantry columns had met with no opposition whatsoever.  McLaw's\r\ndivision was falling back before us, and we occasionally picked up\r\na few of his men as prisoners, who insisted that we would meet with\r\nstrong opposition at Savannah.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th, as I rode along, I found the column turned out of the\r\nmain road, marching through the fields.  Close by, in the corner of\r\na fence, was a group of men standing around a handsome young\r\nofficer, whose foot had been blown to pieces by a torpedo planted\r\nin the road.  He was waiting for a surgeon to amputate his leg, and\r\ntold me that he was riding along with the rest of his brigade-staff\r\nof the Seventeenth Corps, when a torpedo trodden on by his horse\r\nhad exploded, killing the horse and literally blowing off all the\r\nflesh from one of his legs.  I saw the terrible wound, and made\r\nfull inquiry into the facts.  There had been no resistance at that\r\npoint, nothing to give warning of danger, and the rebels had\r\nplanted eight-inch shells in the road, with friction-matches to\r\nexplode them by being trodden on.  This was not war, but murder,\r\nand it made me very angry.  I immediately ordered a lot of rebel\r\nprisoners to be brought from the provost-guard, armed with picks\r\nand spades, and made them march in close order along the road, so\r\nas to explode their own torpedoes, or to discover and dig them up.\r\nThey begged hard, but I reiterated the order, and could hardly help\r\nlaughing at their stepping so gingerly along the road, where it was\r\nsupposed sunken torpedoes might explode at each step, but they\r\nfound no other torpedoes till near Fort McAllister.  That night we\r\nreached Pooler's Station, eight miles from Savannah, and during the\r\nnext two days, December 9th and 10th, the several corps reached the\r\ndefenses of Savannah--the Fourteenth Corps on the left, touching\r\nthe river; the Twentieth Corps next; then the Seventeenth; and the\r\nFifteenth on the extreme right; thus completely investing the city.\r\nWishing to reconnoitre the place in person, I rode forward by the\r\nLouisville road, into a dense wood of oak, pine, and cypress, left\r\nthe horses, and walked down to the railroad-track, at a place where\r\nthere was a side-track, and a cut about four feet deep.  From that\r\npoint the railroad was straight, leading into Savannah, and about\r\neight hundred yards off were a rebel parapet and battery.  I could\r\nsee the cannoneers preparing to fire, and cautioned the officers\r\nnear me to scatter, as we would likely attract a shot.  Very soon I\r\nsaw the white puff of smoke, and, watching close, caught sight of\r\nthe ball as it rose in its flight, and, finding it coming pretty\r\nstraight, I stepped a short distance to one side, but noticed a\r\nnegro very near me in the act of crossing the track at right\r\nangles.  Some one called to him to look out; but, before the poor\r\nfellow understood his danger, the ball (a thirty-two-pound round\r\nshot) struck the ground, and rose in its first ricochet, caught the\r\nnegro under the right jaw, and literally carried away his head,\r\nscattering blood and brains about.  A soldier close by spread an\r\novercoat over the body, and we all concluded to get out of that\r\nrailroad-cut.  Meantime, General Mower's division of the Seventeenth\r\nCorps had crossed the canal to the right of the Louisville\r\nroad, and had found the line of parapet continuous; so at Savannah\r\nwe had again run up against the old familiar parapet, with its deep\r\nditches, canals, and bayous, full of water; and it looked as though\r\nanother siege was inevitable.  I accordingly made a camp or bivouac\r\nnear the Louisville road, about five miles from Savannah, and\r\nproceeded to invest the place closely, pushing forward\r\nreconnoissances at every available point.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was demonstrated that Savannah was well fortified,\r\nwith a good garrison, commanded by General William J. Hardee, a\r\ncompetent soldier, I saw that the first step was to open\r\ncommunication with our fleet, supposed to be waiting for us with\r\nsupplies and clothing in Ossabaw Sound.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard had, some nights previously, sent one of his best\r\nscouts, Captain Duncan, with two men, in a canoe, to drift past\r\nFort McAllister, and to convey to the fleet a knowledge of our\r\napproach.  General Kilpatrick's cavalry had also been transferred\r\nto the south bank of the Ogeechee, with orders to open\r\ncommunication with the fleet.  Leaving orders with General Slocum\r\nto press the siege, I instructed General Howard to send a division\r\nwith all his engineers to Grog's Bridge, fourteen and a half miles\r\nsouthwest from Savannah, to rebuild it.  On the evening of the 12th\r\nI rode over myself, and spent the night at Mr. King's house, where\r\nI found General Howard, with General Hazen's division of the\r\nFifteenth Corps.  His engineers were hard at work on the bridge,\r\nwhich they finished that night, and at sunrise Hazen's division\r\npassed over.  I gave General Hazen, in person, his orders to march\r\nrapidly down the right bank of the Ogeechee, and without hesitation\r\nto assault and carry Fort McAllister by storm.  I knew it to be\r\nstrong in heavy artillery, as against an approach from the sea, but\r\nbelieved it open and weak to the rear.  I explained to General\r\nHazen, fully, that on his action depended the safety of the whole\r\narmy, and the success of the campaign.  Kilpatrick had already felt\r\nthe fort, and had gone farther down the coast to Kilkenny Bluff, or\r\nSt. Catharine's Sound, where, on the same day, he had communication\r\nwith a vessel belonging to the blockading fleet; but, at the time,\r\nI was not aware of this fact, and trusted entirely to General Hazen\r\nand his division of infantry, the Second of the Fifteenth Corps,\r\nthe same old division which I had commanded at Shiloh and\r\nVicksburg, in which I felt a special pride and confidence.\r\n\r\nHaving seen General Hazen fairly off, accompanied by General\r\nHoward, I rode with my staff down the left bank of the Ogeechee,\r\nten miles to the rice-plantation of a Mr. Cheevea, where General\r\nHoward had established a signal-station to overlook the lower\r\nriver, and to watch for any vessel of the blockading squadron,\r\nwhich the negroes reported to be expecting us, because they nightly\r\nsent up rockets, and daily dispatched a steamboat up the Ogeechee\r\nas near to Fort McAllister as it was safe.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the rice-mill at Cheevea's, I found a guard and a\r\ncouple of twenty-pound Parrott gone, of De Gres's battery, which\r\nfired an occasional shot toward Fort McAllister, plainly seen over\r\nthe salt-marsh, about three miles distant.  Fort McAllister had the\r\nrebel flag flying, and occasionally sent a heavy shot back across\r\nthe marsh to where we were, but otherwise every thing about the\r\nplace looked as peaceable and quiet as on the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nThe signal-officer had built a platform on the ridge-pole of\r\nthe rice-mill.  Leaving our horses behind the stacks of rice-straw,\r\nwe all got on the roof of a shed attached to the mill, wherefrom I\r\ncould communicate with the signal-officer above, and at the same\r\ntime look out toward Ossabaw Sound, and across the Ogeechee River\r\nat Fort McAllister.  About 2 p.m.  we observed signs of commotion\r\nin the fort, and noticed one or two guns fired inland, and some\r\nmusket-skirmishing in the woods close by.\r\n\r\nThis betokened the approach of Hazen's division, which had been\r\nanxiously expected, and soon thereafter the signal-officer\r\ndiscovered about three miles above the fort a signal-flag, with\r\nwhich he conversed, and found it to belong to General Hazen, who\r\nwas preparing to assault the fort, and wanted to know if I were\r\nthere.  On being assured of this fact, and that I expected the fort\r\nto be carried before night, I received by signal the assurance of\r\nGeneral Hazen that he was making his preparations, and would soon\r\nattempt the assault.  The sun was rapidly declining, and I was\r\ndreadfully impatient.  At that very moment some one discovered a\r\nfaint cloud of smoke, and an object gliding, as it were, along the\r\nhorizon above the tops of the sedge toward the sea, which little by\r\nlittle grew till it was pronounced to be the smoke-stack of a\r\nsteamer coming up the river.  \"It must be one of our squadron!\"\r\nSoon the flag of the United States was plainly visible, and our\r\nattention was divided between this approaching steamer and the\r\nexpected assault.  When the sun was about an hour high, another\r\nsignal-message came from General Hazen that he was all ready, and I\r\nreplied to go ahead, as a friendly steamer was approaching from\r\nbelow.  Soon we made out a group of officers on the deck of this\r\nvessel, signaling with a flag, \"Who are you!\"  The answer went back\r\npromptly, \"General Sherman.\"  Then followed the question, \"Is Fort\r\nMcAllister taken?\"  \"Not yet, but it will be in a minute!\"  Almost\r\nat that instant of time, we saw Hazen's troops come out of the dark\r\nfringe of woods that encompassed the fort, the lines dressed as on\r\nparade, with colors flying, and moving forward with a quick, steady\r\npace.  Fort McAllister was then all alive, its big guns belching\r\nforth dense clouds of smoke, which soon enveloped our assaulting\r\nlines.  One color went down, but was up in a moment.  On the lines\r\nadvanced, faintly seen in the white, sulphurous smoke; there was a\r\npause, a cessation of fire; the smoke cleared away, and the\r\nparapets were blue with our men, who fired their muskets in the\r\nair, and shouted so that we actually heard them, or felt that we\r\ndid.  Fort McAllister was taken, and the good news was instantly\r\nsent by the signal-officer to our navy friends on the approaching\r\ngunboat, for a point of timber had shut out Fort McAllister from\r\ntheir view, and they had not seen the action at all, but must have\r\nheard the cannonading.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the assault, our little group on Cheeves's\r\nmill hardly breathed; but no sooner did we see our flags on the\r\nparapet than I exclaimed, in the language of the poor negro at\r\nCobb's plantation, \"This nigger will have no sleep this night!\"\r\n\r\nI was resolved to communicate with our fleet that night, which\r\nhappened to be a beautiful moonlight one.  At the wharf belonging\r\nto Cheeves's mill was a small skiff, that had been used by our men\r\nin fishing or in gathering oysters.  I was there in a minute,\r\ncalled for a volunteer crew, when several young officers, Nichols\r\nand Merritt among the number; said they were good oarsmen, and\r\nvolunteered to pull the boat down to Fort McAllister.  General\r\nHoward asked to accompany me; so we took seats in the stern of the\r\nboat, and our crew of officers pulled out with a will.  The tide\r\nwas setting in strong, and they had a hard pull, for, though the\r\ndistance was but three miles in an air-line, the river was so\r\ncrooked that the actual distance was fully six miles.  On the way\r\ndown we passed the wreck of a steamer which had been sunk some\r\nyears before, during a naval attack on Fort McAllister.\r\n\r\nNight had fairly set in when we discovered a soldier on the beach.\r\nI hailed him, and inquired if he knew where General Hazen was.  He\r\nanswered that the general was at the house of the overseer of the\r\nplantation (McAllister's), and that he could guide me to it.  We\r\naccordingly landed, tied our boat to a driftlog, and followed our\r\nguide through bushes to a frame-house, standing in a grove of\r\nlive-oaks, near a row of negro quarters.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hazen was there with his staff, in the act of getting\r\nsupper; he invited us to join them, which we accepted promptly, for\r\nwe were really very hungry.  Of course, I congratulated Hazen most\r\nheartily on his brilliant success, and praised its execution very\r\nhighly, as it deserved, and he explained to me more in detail the\r\nexact results.  The fort was an inclosed work, and its land-front\r\nwas in the nature of a bastion and curtains, with good parapet,\r\nditch, fraise, and chevaux-de-frise, made out of the large branches\r\nof live-oaks.  Luckily, the rebels had left the larger and unwieldy\r\ntrunks on the ground, which served as a good cover for the\r\nskirmish-line, which crept behind these logs, and from them kept\r\nthe artillerists from loading and firing their guns accurately.\r\n\r\nThe assault had been made by three parties in line, one from below,\r\none from above the fort, and the third directly in rear, along the\r\ncapital.  All were simultaneous, and had to pass a good abatis and\r\nline of torpedoes, which actually killed more of the assailants\r\nthan the heavy guns of the fort, which generally overshot the mark.\r\nHazen's entire loss was reported, killed and wounded, ninety-two.\r\nEach party reached the parapet about the same time, and the\r\ngarrison inside, of about two hundred and fifty men (about fifty of\r\nthem killed or wounded), were in his power.  The commanding\r\nofficer, Major Anderson, was at that moment a prisoner, and\r\nGeneral Hazen invited him in to take supper with us, which he did.\r\n\r\nUp to this time General Hazen did not know that a gunboat was in\r\nthe river below the fort; for it was shut off from sight by a point\r\nof timber, and I was determined to board her that night, at\r\nwhatever risk or cost, as I wanted some news of what was going on\r\nin the outer world.  Accordingly, after supper, we all walked down\r\nto the fort, nearly a mile from the house where we had been,\r\nentered Fort McAllister, held by a regiment of Hazen's troops, and\r\nthe sentinel cautioned us to be very careful, as the ground outside\r\nthe fort was full of torpedoes.  Indeed, while we were there, a\r\ntorpedo exploded, tearing to pieces a poor fellow who was hunting\r\nfor a dead comrade.  Inside the fort lay the dead as they had\r\nfallen, and they could hardly be distinguished from their living\r\ncomrades, sleeping soundly side by side in the pale moonlight.  In\r\nthe river, close by the fort, was a good yawl tied to a stake, but\r\nthe tide was high, and it required some time to get it in to the\r\nbank; the commanding officer, whose name I cannot recall, manned\r\nthe boat with a good crew of his men, and, with General Howard, I\r\nentered, and pulled down-stream, regardless of the warnings all\r\nabout the torpedoes.\r\n\r\nThe night was unusually bright, and we expected to find the gunboat\r\nwithin a mile or so; but, after pulling down the river fully three\r\nmiles, and not seeing the gunboat, I began to think she had turned\r\nand gone back to the sound; but we kept on, following the bends of\r\nthe river, and about six miles below McAllister we saw her light,\r\nand soon were hailed by the vessel at anchor.  Pulling alongside,\r\nwe announced ourselves, and were received with great warmth and\r\nenthusiasm on deck by half a dozen naval officers, among them\r\nCaptain Williamson, United States Navy.  She proved to be the\r\nDandelion, a tender of the regular gunboat Flag, posted at the\r\nmouth of the Ogeechee.  All sorts of questions were made and\r\nanswered, and we learned that Captain Duncan had safely reached the\r\nsquadron, had communicated the good news of our approach, and they\r\nhad been expecting us for some days.  They explained that Admiral\r\nDahlgren commanded the South-Atlantic Squadron, which was then\r\nengaged in blockading the coast from Charleston south, and was on\r\nhis flag-ship, the Harvest Moon, lying in Wassaw Sound; that\r\nGeneral J. G. Foster was in command of the Department of the South,\r\nwith his headquarters at Hilton Head; and that several ships loaded\r\nwith stores for the army were lying in Tybee Roads and in Port\r\nRoyal Sound.  From these officers I also learned that General Grant\r\nwas still besieging Petersburg and Richmond, and that matters and\r\nthings generally remained pretty much the same as when we had left\r\nAtlanta.  All thoughts seemed to have been turned to us in Georgia,\r\ncut off from all communication with our friends; and the rebel\r\npapers had reported us to be harassed, defeated, starving, and\r\nfleeing for safety to the coast.  I then asked for pen and paper,\r\nand wrote several hasty notes to General Foster, Admiral Dahlgren,\r\nGeneral Grant, and the Secretary of War, giving in general terms\r\nthe actual state of affairs, the fact of the capture of Fort\r\nMcAllister, and of my desire that means should be taken to\r\nestablish a line of supply from the vessels in port up the Ogeechee\r\nto the rear of the army.  As a sample, I give one of these notes,\r\naddressed to the Secretary of War, intended for publication to\r\nrelieve the anxiety of our friends at the North generally:\r\n\r\n\r\nON BOARD DANDELION, OSSABAW SOUND, December 13, 1864--11.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Hon. E.  M.  STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nTo-day, at 6 p. m., General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps\r\ncarried Fort McAllister by assault, capturing its entire garrison\r\nand stores.  This opened to us Ossabaw Sound, and I pushed down to\r\nthis gunboat to communicate with the fleet.  Before opening\r\ncommunication we had completely destroyed all the railroads leading\r\ninto Savannah, and invested the city.  The left of the army is on\r\nthe Savannah River three miles above the city, and the right on the\r\nOgeechee, at King's Bridge.  The army is in splendid order, and\r\nequal to any thing.  The weather has been fine, and supplies were\r\nabundant.  Our march was most agreeable, and we were not at all\r\nmolested by guerrillas.\r\n\r\nWe reached Savannah three days ago, but, owing to Fort McAllister,\r\ncould not communicate; but, now that we have McAllister, we can go\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nWe have already captured two boats on the Savannah river and\r\nprevented their gunboats from coming down.\r\n\r\nI estimate the population of Savannah at twenty-five thousand, and\r\nthe garrison at fifteen thousand.  General Hardee commands.\r\n\r\nWe have not lost a wagon on the trip; but have gathered a large\r\nsupply of negroes, mules, horses, etc., and our teams are in far\r\nbetter condition than when we started.\r\n\r\nMy first duty will be to clear the army of surplus negroes, mules,\r\nand horses.  We have utterly destroyed over two hundred miles of\r\nrails, and consumed stores and provisions that were essential to\r\nLee's and Hood's armies.\r\n\r\nThe quick work made with McAllister, the opening of communication\r\nwith our fleet, and our consequent independence as to supplies,\r\ndissipate all their boasted threats to head us off and starve the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI regard Savannah as already gained.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time the night was well advanced, and the tide was running\r\nebb-strong; so I asked.  Captain Williamson to tow us up as near\r\nFort McAllister as he would venture for the torpedoes, of which the\r\nnavy-officers had a wholesome dread.  The Dandelion steamed up some\r\nthree or four miles, till the lights of Fort McAllister could be\r\nseen, when she anchored, and we pulled to the fort in our own boat.\r\nGeneral Howard and I then walked up to the McAllister House, where\r\nwe found General Hazen and his officers asleep on the floor of one\r\nof the rooms.  Lying down on the floor, I was soon fast asleep, but\r\nshortly became conscious that some one in the room was inquiring\r\nfor me among the sleepers.  Calling out, I was told that an officer\r\nof General Fosters staff had just arrived from a steamboat anchored\r\nbelow McAllister; that the general was extremely anxious to see me\r\non important business, but that he was lame from an old Mexican-War\r\nwound, and could not possibly come to me.  I was extremely weary\r\nfrom the incessant labor of the day and night before, but got up,\r\nand again walked down the sandy road to McAllister, where I found a\r\nboat awaiting us, which carried us some three miles down the river,\r\nto the steamer W.  W.  Coit (I think), on board of which we found\r\nGeneral Foster.  He had just come from Port Royal, expecting to\r\nfind Admiral Dahlgren in Ossabaw Sound, and, hearing of the capture\r\nof Fort McAllister, he had come up to see me.  He described fully\r\nthe condition of affairs with his own command in South Carolina.\r\nHe had made several serious efforts to effect a lodgment on the\r\nrailroad which connects Savannah with Charleston near Pocotaligo,\r\nbut had not succeeded in reaching the railroad itself, though he\r\nhad a full division of troops, strongly intrenched, near Broad\r\nRiver, within cannon-range of the railroad.  He explained,\r\nmoreover, that there were at Port Royal abundant supplies of bread\r\nand provisions, as well as of clothing, designed for our use.  We\r\nstill had in our wagons and in camp abundance of meat, but we\r\nneeded bread, sugar, and coffee, and it was all-important that a\r\nroute of supply should at once be opened, for which purpose the\r\nassistance of the navy were indispensable.  We accordingly\r\nsteamed down the Ogeechee River to Ossabaw Sound, in hopes to meet\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren, but he was not there, and we continued on by the\r\ninland channel to Warsaw Sound, where we found the Harvest Moon,\r\nand Admiral Dahlgren.  I was not personally acquainted with him at\r\nthe time, but he was so extremely kind and courteous that I was at\r\nonce attracted to him.  There was nothing in his power, he said,\r\nwhich he would not do to assist us, to make our campaign absolutely\r\nsuccessful.  He undertook at once to find vessels of light draught\r\nto carry our supplies from Port Royal to Cheeves's Mill, or to\r\nGrog's Bridge above, whence they could be hauled by wagons to our\r\nseveral camps; he offered to return with me to Fort McAllister, to\r\nsuperintend the removal of the torpedoes, and to relieve me of all\r\nthe details of this most difficult work.  General Foster then\r\nconcluded to go on to Port Royal, to send back to us six hundred\r\nthousand rations, and all the rifled guns of heavy calibre, and\r\nammunition on hand, with which I thought we could reach the city of\r\nSavannah, from the positions already secured.  Admiral Dahlgren\r\nthen returned with me in the Harvest Moon to Fort McAllister.  This\r\nconsumed all of the 14th of December; and by the 15th I had again\r\nreached Cheeves's Mill, where my horse awaited me, and rode on to\r\nGeneral Howard's headquarters at Anderson's plantation, on the\r\nplank-road, about eight miles back of Savannah.  I reached this\r\nplace about noon, and immediately sent orders to my own\r\nhead-quarters, on the Louisville road, to have them brought over to\r\nthe plank-road, as a place more central and convenient; gave written\r\nnotice to Generals Slocum and Howard of all the steps taken, and\r\nordered them to get ready to receive the siege-guns, to put them in\r\nposition to bombard Savannah, and to prepare for the general assault.\r\nThe country back of Savannah is very low, and intersected with\r\ninnumerable saltwater creeks, swamps, and rice-fields. Fortunately\r\nthe weather was good and the roads were passable, but, should the\r\nwinter rains set in, I knew that we would be much embarrassed.\r\nTherefore, heavy details of men were at once put to work to prepare a\r\nwharf and depot at Grog's Bridge, and the roads leading thereto were\r\ncorduroyed in advance.  The Ogeechee Canal was also cleared out for\r\nuse; and boats, such as were common on the river plantations, were\r\ncollected, in which to float stores from our proposed base on the\r\nOgeechee to the points most convenient to the several camps.\r\n\r\nSlocum's wing extended from the Savannah River to the canal, and\r\nHoward's wing from the canal to the extreme right, along down the\r\nLittle Ogeechee.  The enemy occupied not only the city itself, with\r\nits long line of outer works, but the many forts which had been\r\nbuilt to guard the approaches from the sea-such as at Beaulieu,\r\nRosedew, White Bluff, Bonaventura, Thunderbolt, Cansten's Bluff,\r\nForts Tatnall, Boggs, etc., etc.  I knew that General Hardee could\r\nnot have a garrison strong enough for all these purposes, and I was\r\ntherefore anxious to break his lines before he could receive\r\nreenforcements from Virginia or Augusta.  General Slocum had\r\nalready captured a couple of steamboats trying to pass down the\r\nSavannah River from Augusta, and had established some of his men on\r\nArgyle and Hutchinson Islands above the city, and wanted to\r\ntransfer a whole corps to the South Carolina bank; but, as the\r\nenemy had iron-clad gunboats in the river, I did not deem it\r\nprudent, because the same result could be better accomplished from\r\nGeneral Fosters position at Broad River.\r\n\r\nFort McAllister was captured as described, late in the evening of\r\nDecember 13th, and by the 16th many steamboats had passed up as\r\nhigh as King's Bridge; among them one which General Grant had\r\ndispatched with the mails for the army, which had accumulated since\r\nour departure from Atlanta, under charge of Colonel A. H. Markland.\r\nThese mails were most welcome to all the officers and soldiers of\r\nthe army, which had been cut off from friends and the world for two\r\nmonths, and this prompt receipt of letters from home had an\r\nexcellent effect, making us feel that home was near.  By this\r\nvessel also came Lieutenant Dune, aide-de-camp, with the following\r\nletter of December 3d, from General Grant, and on the next day\r\nColonel Babcock, United States Engineers, arrived with the letter\r\nof December 6th, both of which are in General Grant's own\r\nhandwriting, and are given entire:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA,  December 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Armies near Savannah,\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: The little information gleaned from the Southern press\r\nindicating no great obstacle to your progress, I have directed your\r\nmails (which had been previously collected in Baltimore by Colonel\r\nMarkland, special-agent of the Post-Office Department) to be sent\r\nas far as the blockading squadron off Savannah, to be forwarded to\r\nyou as soon as heard from on the coast.\r\n\r\nNot liking to rejoice before the victory is assured, I abstain from\r\ncongratulating you and those under your command, until bottom has\r\nbeen struck.  I have never had a fear, however, for the result.\r\n\r\nSince you left Atlanta no very great progress has been made here.\r\nThe enemy has been closely watched, though, and prevented from\r\ndetaching against you.  I think not one man has gone from here,\r\nexcept some twelve or fifteen hundred dismounted cavalry.  Bragg\r\nhas gone from Wilmington.  I am trying to take advantage of his\r\nabsence to get possession of that place.  Owing to some\r\npreparations Admiral Porter and General Butler are making to blow\r\nup Fort Fisher (which, while hoping for the best, I do not believe\r\na particle in), there is a delay in getting this expedition off.  I\r\nhope they will be ready to start by the 7th, and that Bragg will\r\nnot have started back by that time.\r\n\r\nIn this letter I do not intend to give you any thing like\r\ndirections for future action, but will state a general idea I have,\r\nand will get your views after you have established yourself on the\r\nsea-coast.  With your veteran army I hope to get control of the only\r\ntwo through routes from east to west possessed by the enemy before\r\nthe fall of Atlanta.  The condition will be filled by holding\r\nSavannah and Augusta, or by holding any other port to the east of\r\nSavannah and Branchville.  If Wilmington falls, a force from there\r\ncan cooperate with you.\r\n\r\nThomas has got back into the defenses of Nashville, with Hood close\r\nupon him.  Decatur has been abandoned, and so have all the roads,\r\nexcept the main one leading to Chattanooga.  Part of this falling\r\nback was undoubtedly necessary, and all of it may have been.  It\r\ndid not look so, however, to me.  In my opinion, Thomas far\r\noutnumbers Hood in infantry.  In cavalry Hood has the advantage in\r\nmorale and numbers.  I hope yet that Hood will be badly crippled,\r\nif not destroyed.  The general news you will learn from the papers\r\nbetter than I can give it.\r\n\r\nAfter all becomes quiet, and roads become so bad up here that there\r\nis likely to be a week or two when nothing can be done, I will run\r\ndown the coast to see you.  If you desire it, I will ask Mrs.\r\nSherman to go with me.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi\r\n\r\nGENERAL: On reflection since sending my letter by the hands of\r\nLieutenant Dunn, I have concluded that the most important operation\r\ntoward closing out the rebellion will be to close out Lee and his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nYou have now destroyed the roads of the South so that it will\r\nprobably take them three months without interruption to reestablish\r\na through line from east to west.  In that time I think the job here\r\nwill be effectually completed.\r\n\r\nMy idea now is that you establish a base on the sea-coast, fortify\r\nand leave in it all your artillery and cavalry, and enough infantry\r\nto protect them, and at the same time so threaten the interior that\r\nthe militia of the South will have to be kept at home.  With the\r\nbalance of your command come here by water with all dispatch.\r\nSelect yourself the officer to leave in command, but you I want in\r\nperson.  Unless you see objections to this plan which I cannot see,\r\nuse every vessel going to you for purposes of transportation.\r\n\r\nHood has Thomas close in Nashville.  I have said all I can to force\r\nhim to attack, without giving the positive order until to-day.\r\nTo-day, however, I could stand it no longer, and gave the order\r\nwithout any reserve.  I think the battle will take place to-morrow.\r\nThe result will probably be known in New York before Colonel\r\nBabcock (the bearer of this) will leave it.  Colonel Babcock will\r\ngive you full information of all operations now in progress.\r\nVery respectfully your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contents of these letters gave me great uneasiness, for I had\r\nset my heart on the capture of Savannah, which I believed to be\r\npracticable, and to be near; for me to embark for Virginia by sea\r\nwas so complete a change from what I had supposed would be the\r\ncourse of events that I was very much concerned.  I supposed, as a\r\nmatter of course, that a fleet of vessels would soon pour in, ready\r\nto convey the army to Virginia, and as General Grant's orders\r\ncontemplated my leaving the cavalry, trains, and artillery, behind,\r\nI judged Fort McAllister to be the best place for the purpose, and\r\nsent my chief-engineer, Colonel Poe, to that fort, to reconnoitre\r\nthe ground, and to prepare it so as to make a fortified camp large\r\nenough to accommodate the vast herd of mules and horses that would\r\nthus be left behind.  And as some time might be required to collect\r\nthe necessary shipping, which I estimated at little less than a\r\nhundred steamers and sailing-vessels, I determined to push\r\noperations, in hopes to secure the city of Savannah before the\r\nnecessary fleet could be available.  All these ideas are given in\r\nmy answer to General Grant's letters (dated December 16, 1864)\r\nherewith, which is a little more full than the one printed in the\r\nreport of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, because in that\r\ncopy I omitted the matter concerning General Thomas, which now need\r\nno longer be withheld:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, December 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, Commander-in-Chief, City Point,\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I received, day before yesterday, at the hands of\r\nLieutenant Dunn, your letter of December 8d, and last night, at the\r\nhands of Colonel Babcock, that of December 6th.  I had previously\r\nmade you a hasty scrawl from the tugboat Dandelion, in Ogeechee\r\nRiver, advising you that the army had reached the sea-coast,\r\ndestroying all the railroads across the State of Georgia, investing\r\nclosely the city of Savannah, and had made connection with the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nSince writing that note, I have in person met and conferred with\r\nGeneral Foster and Admiral Dahlgren, and made all the arrangements\r\nwhich were deemed essential for reducing the city of Savannah to\r\nour possession.  But, since the receipt of yours of the 6th, I have\r\ninitiated measures looking principally to coming to you with fifty\r\nor Sixty thousand infantry, and incidentally to capture Savannah,\r\nif time will allow.\r\n\r\nAt the time we carried Fort McAllister by assault so handsomely,\r\nwith its twenty-two guns and entire garrison, I was hardly aware\r\nof its importance; but, since passing down the river with General\r\nFoster and up with Admiral Dahlgren, I realize how admirably\r\nadapted are Ossabaw Sound and Ogeechee River to supply an army\r\noperating against Savannah.  Seagoing vessels can easily come to\r\nKing's Bridge, a point on Ogeechee River, fourteen and a half miles\r\ndue west of Savannah, from which point we have roads leading to all\r\nour camps.  The country is low and sandy, and cut up with marshes,\r\nwhich in wet weather will be very bad, but we have been so favored\r\nwith weather that they are all now comparatively good, and heavy\r\ndetails are constantly employed in double-corduroying the marshes,\r\nso that I have no fears even of bad weather.  Fortunately, also, by\r\nliberal and judicious foraging, we reached the sea-coast abundantly\r\nsupplied with forage and provisions, needing nothing on arrival\r\nexcept bread.  Of this we started from Atlanta, with from eight to\r\ntwenty days' supply per corps and some of the troops only had one\r\nday's issue of bread during the trip of thirty days; yet they did\r\nnot want, for sweet-potatoes were very abundant, as well as\r\ncorn-meal, and our soldiers took to them naturally.  We started\r\nwith about five thousand head of cattle, and arrived with over ten\r\nthousand, of course consuming mostly turkeys, chickens, sheep,\r\nhogs, and the cattle of the country.  As to our mules and horses,\r\nwe left Atlanta with about twenty-five hundred wagons, many of\r\nwhich were drawn by mules which had not recovered from the\r\nChattanooga starvation, all of which were replaced, the poor mules\r\nshot, and our transportation is now in superb condition.  I have no\r\ndoubt the State of Georgia has lost, by our operations, fifteen\r\nthousand first-rate mules.  As to horses, Kilpatrick collected all\r\nhis remounts, and it looks to me, in riding along our\r\ncolumns, as though every officer had three or four led horses, and\r\neach regiment seems to be followed by at least fifty negroes and\r\nfoot-sore soldiers, riding on horses and mules.  The custom was for\r\neach brigade to send out daily a foraging-party of about fifty men,\r\non foot, who invariably returned mounted, with several wagons\r\nloaded with poultry, potatoes, etc., and as the army is composed of\r\nabout forty brigades, you can estimate approximately the number of\r\nhorses collected.  Great numbers of these were shot by my order,\r\nbecause of the disorganizing effect on our infantry of having too\r\nmany idlers mounted.  General Euston is now engaged in collecting\r\nstatistics on this subject, but I know the Government will never\r\nreceive full accounts of our captures, although the result aimed at\r\nwas fully attained, viz., to deprive our enemy of them.  All these\r\nanimals I will have sent to Port Royal, or collected behind Fort\r\nMcAllister, to be used by General Saxton in his farming operations,\r\nor by the Quartermaster's Department, after they are systematically\r\naccounted for.  While General Easton is collecting transportation\r\nfor my troops to James River, I will throw to Port Royal Island all\r\nour means of transportation I can, and collect the rest near Fort\r\nMcAllister, covered by the Ogeeehee River and intrenchments to be\r\nerected, and for which Captain Poe, my chief-engineer, is now\r\nreconnoitring the ground, but in the mean time will act as I have\r\nbegun, as though the city of Savannah were my objective: namely,\r\nthe troops will continue to invest Savannah closely, making attacks\r\nand feints wherever we have fair ground to stand upon, and I will\r\nplace some thirty-pound Parrotts, which I have got from General\r\nFoster, in position, near enough to reach the centre of the city,\r\nand then will demand its surrender.  If General Hardee is alarmed,\r\nor fears starvation, he may surrender; otherwise I will bombard the\r\ncity, but not risk the lives of our men by assaults across the\r\nnarrow causeways, by which alone I can now reach it.\r\n\r\nIf I had time, Savannah, with all its dependent fortifications,\r\nwould surely fall into our possession, for we hold all its avenues\r\nof supply.\r\n\r\nThe enemy has made two desperate efforts to get boats from above to\r\nthe city, in both of which he has been foiled-General Slocum (whose\r\nleft flank rests on the river) capturing and burning the first\r\nboat, and in the second instance driving back two gunboats and\r\ncapturing the steamer Resolute, with seven naval officers and a\r\ncrew of twenty-five seamen.  General Slocum occupies Argyle Island\r\nand the upper end of Hutchinson Inland, and has a brigade on the\r\nSouth Carolina shore opposite, and is very urgent to pass one of\r\nhis corps over to that shore.  But, in view of the change of plan\r\nmade necessary by your order of the 6th, I will maintain things in\r\nstatu quo till I have got all my transportation to the rear and out\r\nof the way, and until I have sea-transportation for the troops you\r\nrequire at James River, which I will accompany and command in\r\nperson.  Of course, I will leave Kilpatrick, with his cavalry (say\r\nfive thousand three hundred), and, it may be, a division of the\r\nFifteenth Corps; but, before determining on this, I must see\r\nGeneral Foster, and may arrange to shift his force (now over above\r\nthe Charleston Railroad, at the head of Broad River) to the\r\nOgeeohee, where, in cooperation with Kilpatrick's cavalry, he can\r\nbetter threaten the State of Georgia than from the direction of\r\nPort Royal.  Besides, I would much prefer not to detach from my\r\nregular corps any of its veteran divisions, and would even prefer\r\nthat other less valuable troops should be sent to reenforce Foster\r\nfrom some other quarter.  My four corps, full of experience and\r\nfull of ardor, coming to you en masse, equal to sixty thousand\r\nfighting men, will be a reenforcement that Lee cannot disregard.\r\nIndeed, with my present command, I had expected, after reducing\r\nSavannah, instantly to march to Columbia, South Carolina; thence to\r\nRaleigh, and thence to report to you.  But this would consume, it\r\nmay be, six weeks' time after the fall of Savannah; whereas, by\r\nsea, I can probably reach you with my men and arms before the\r\nmiddle of January.\r\n\r\nI myself am somewhat astonished at the attitude of things in\r\nTennessee.  I purposely delayed at Kingston until General Thomas\r\nassured me that he was all ready, and my last dispatch from him of\r\nthe 12th of November was full of confidence, in which he promised\r\nme that he would ruin Hood if he dared to advance from Florence,\r\nurging me to go ahead, and give myself no concern about Hood's army\r\nin Tennessee.\r\n\r\nWhy he did not turn on him at Franklin, after checking and\r\ndiscomfiting him, surpasses my understanding.  Indeed, I do not\r\napprove of his evacuating Decatur, but think he should have assumed\r\nthe offensive against Hood from Pulaski, in the direction of\r\nWaynesburg.\r\nI know full well that General Thomas is slow in mind and in action;\r\nbut he is judicious and brave and the troops feel great confidence\r\nin him.  I still hope he will out-manoeuvre and destroy Hood.\r\n\r\nAs to matters in the Southeast, I think Hardee, in Savannah, has\r\ngood  artillerists, some five or six thousand good infantry, and,\r\nit may be, a mongrel mass of eight to ten thousand militia.  In all\r\nour marching through Georgia, he has not forced us to use any thing\r\nbut a skirmish-line, though at several points he had erected\r\nfortifications and tried to alarm us by bombastic threats.  In\r\nSavannah he has taken refuge in a line constructed behind swamps\r\nand overflowed rice-fields, extending from a point on the Savannah\r\nRiver about three miles above the city, around by a branch of the\r\nLittle Ogeechee, which stream is impassable from its salt-marshes\r\nand boggy swamps, crossed only by narrow causeways or common\r\ncorduroy-roads.\r\n\r\nThere must be twenty-five thousand citizens, men, women, and\r\nchildren, in Savannah, that must also be fed, and how he is to feed\r\nthem beyond a few days I cannot imagine.  I know that his\r\nrequisitions for corn on the interior counties were not filled, and\r\nwe are in possession of the rice-fields and mills, which could\r\nalone be of service to him in this neighborhood.  He can draw\r\nnothing from South Carolina, save from a small corner down in the\r\nsoutheast, and that by a disused wagon-road.  I could easily get\r\npossession of this, but hardly deem it worth the risk of making a\r\ndetachment, which would be in danger by its isolation from the main\r\narmy.  Our whole army is in fine condition as to health, and the\r\nweather is splendid.  For that reason alone I feel a personal\r\ndislike to turning northward.  I will keep Lieutenant Dunn here\r\nuntil I know the result of my demand for the surrender of Savannah,\r\nbut, whether successful or not, shall not delay my execution of\r\nyour order of the 6th, which will depend alone upon the time it\r\nwill require to obtain transportation by sea.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, etc., your obedient servant,\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General United States Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving concluded all needful preparations, I rode from my\r\nheadquarters, on the plank-road, over to General Slocum's\r\nheadquarters, on the Macon road, and thence dispatched (by flag of\r\ntruce) into Savannah, by the hands of Colonel Ewing,\r\ninspector-general, a demand for the surrender of the place.  The\r\nfollowing letters give the result.  General Hardee refused to\r\nsurrender, and I then resolved to make the attempt to break his\r\nline of defense at several places, trusting that some one would\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, December 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral WILLIAM J. HARDEE, commanding Confederate Forces in\r\nSavannah.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: You have doubtless observed, from your station at Rosedew\r\nthat sea-going vessels now come through Ossabaw Sound and up the\r\nOgeechee to the rear of my army, giving me abundant supplies of all\r\nkinds, and more especially heavy ordnance necessary for the\r\nreduction of Savannah.  I have already received guns that can cast\r\nheavy and destructive shot as far as the heart of your city; also,\r\nI have for some days held and controlled every avenue by which the\r\npeople and garrison of Savannah can be supplied, and I am therefore\r\njustified in demanding the surrender of the city of Savannah, and\r\nits dependent forts, and shall wait a reasonable time for your\r\nanswer, before opening with heavy ordnance.  Should you entertain\r\nthe proposition, I am prepared to grant liberal terms to the\r\ninhabitants and garrison; but should I be forced to resort to\r\nassault, or the slower and surer process of starvation, I shall\r\nthen feel justified in resorting to the harshest measures, and\r\nshall make little effort to restrain my army--burning to avenge the\r\nnational wrong which they attach to Savannah and other large cities\r\nwhich have been so prominent in dragging our country into civil\r\nwar.  I inclose you a copy of General Hood's demand for the\r\nsurrender of the town of Resaoa, to be used by you for what it is\r\nworth. I have the honor to be your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA AND FLORIDA\r\nSAVANNAH, GEORGIA, December 17, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Federal Forces near\r\nSavannah, Georgia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from\r\nyou of this date, in which you demand \"the surrender of Savannah\r\nand its dependent forts,\" on the ground that you \"have received\r\nguns that can cast heavy and destructive shot into the heart of the\r\ncity,\" and for the further reason that you \"have, for some days,\r\nheld and controlled every avenue by which the people and garrison\r\ncan be supplied.\"  You add that, should you be \"forced to resort to\r\nassault, or to the slower and surer process of starvation, you will\r\nthen feel justified in resorting to the harshest measures, and will\r\nmake little effort to restrain your army,\" etc., etc.  The position\r\nof your forces (a half-mile beyond the outer line for the\r\nland-defense of Savannah) is, at the nearest point, at least four\r\nmiles from the heart of the city.  That and the interior line are\r\nboth intact.\r\n\r\nYour statement that you have, for some days, held and controlled\r\nevery avenue by which the people and garrison can be supplied, is\r\nincorrect.  I am in free and constant communication with my\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nYour demand for the surrender of Savannah and its dependent forts\r\nis refused.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the threats conveyed in the closing paragraphs of\r\nyour letter (of what may be expected in case your demand is not\r\ncomplied with), I have to say that I have hitherto conducted the\r\nmilitary operations intrusted to my direction in strict accordance\r\nwith the rules of civilized warfare, and I should deeply regret the\r\nadoption of any course by you that may force me to deviate from\r\nthem in future.  I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.  J.  HARDEE, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, December 18, 1864 8 p.m.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, City Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I wrote you at length (by Colonel Babcock) on the 16th\r\ninstant.  As I therein explained my purpose, yesterday I made a\r\ndemand on General Hardee for the surrender of the city of Savannah,\r\nand to-day received his answer--refusing; copies of both letters\r\nare herewith inclosed.  You will notice that I claim that my lines\r\nare within easy cannon-range of the heart of Savannah; but General\r\nHardee asserts that we are four and a half miles distant.  But I\r\nmyself have been to the intersection of the Charleston and Georgia\r\nCentral Railroads, and the three-mile post is but a few yards\r\nbeyond, within the line of our pickets.  The enemy has no pickets\r\noutside of his fortified line (which is a full quarter of a mile\r\nwithin the three-mile post), and I have the evidence of Mr. R. R.\r\nCuyler, President of the Georgia Central Railroad (who was a\r\nprisoner in our hands), that the mile-posts are measured from the\r\nExchange, which is but two squares back from the river.  By\r\nto-morrow morning I will have six thirty-pound Parrotts in\r\nposition, and General Hardee will learn whether I am right or not.\r\nFrom the left of our line, which is on the Savannah River, the\r\nspires can be plainly seen; but the country is so densely wooded\r\nwith pine and live-oak, and lies so flat, that we can see nothing\r\nfrom any other portion of our lines.  General Slocum feels\r\nconfident that he can make a successful assault at one or two\r\npoints in front of General Davis's (Fourteenth) corps.  All of\r\nGeneral Howard's troops (the right wing) lie behind the Little\r\nOgeechee, and I doubt if it can be passed by troops in the face of\r\nan enemy.  Still, we can make strong feints, and if I can get a\r\nsufficient number of boats, I shall make a cooperative\r\ndemonstration up Vernon River or Wassaw Sound.  I should like very\r\nmuch indeed to take Savannah before coming to you; but, as I wrote\r\nto you before, I will do nothing rash or hasty, and will embark for\r\nthe James River as soon as General Easton (who is gone to Port\r\nRoyal for that purpose) reports to me that he has an approximate\r\nnumber of vessels for the transportation of the contemplated force.\r\nI fear even this will cost more delay than you anticipate, for\r\nalready the movement of our transports and the gunboats has\r\nrequired more time than I had expected.  We have had dense fogs;\r\nthere are more mud-banks in the Ogeechee than were reported, and\r\nthere are no pilots whatever.  Admiral Dahlgren promised to have\r\nthe channel buoyed and staked, but it is not done yet.  We find\r\nonly six feet of water up to King's Bridge at low tide, about ten\r\nfeet up to the rice-mill, and sixteen to Fort McAllister.  All\r\nthese points may be used by us, and we have a good, strong bridge\r\nacross Ogeechee at King's, by which our wagons can go to Fort\r\nMcAllister, to which point I am sending all wagons not absolutely\r\nnecessary for daily use, the negroes, prisoners of war, sick, etc.,\r\nen route for Port Royal.  In relation to Savannah, you will remark\r\nthat General Hardee refers to his still being in communication with\r\nhis department.  This language he thought would deceive me; but I\r\nam confirmed in the belief that the route to which he refers (the\r\nUnion Plank-road on the South Carolina shore) is inadequate to feed\r\nhis army and the people of Savannah, and General Foster assures me\r\nthat he has his force on that very road, near the head of Broad\r\nRiver, so that cars no longer run between Charleston and Savannah.\r\nWe hold this end of the Charleston Railroad, and have destroyed it\r\nfrom the three-mile post back to the bridge (about twelve miles).\r\nIn anticipation of leaving this country, I am continuing the\r\ndestruction of their railroads, and at this moment have two\r\ndivisions and the cavalry at work breaking up the Gulf Railroad\r\nfrom the Ogeechee to the Altamaha; so that, even if I do not take\r\nSavannah, I will leave it in a bad way.  But I still hope that\r\nevents will give me time to take Savannah, even if I have to\r\nassault with some loss.  I am satisfied that, unless we take it,\r\nthe gunboats never will, for they can make no impression upon the\r\nbatteries which guard every approach from the sea.  I have a faint\r\nbelief that, when Colonel Babcock reaches you, you will delay\r\noperations long enough to enable me to succeed here.  With Savannah\r\nin our possession, at some future time if not now, we can punish\r\nSouth Carolina as she deserves, and as thousands of the people in\r\nGeorgia hoped we would do.  I do sincerely believe that the whole\r\nUnited States, North and South, would rejoice to have this army\r\nturned loose on South Carolina, to devastate that State in the\r\nmanner we have done in Georgia, and it would have a direst and\r\nimmediate bearing on your campaign in Virginia.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General United States Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the army had reached Savannah, and had opened\r\ncommunication with the fleet, I endeavored to ascertain what had\r\ntranspired in Tennessee since our departure.  We received our\r\nletters and files of newspapers, which contained full accounts of\r\nall the events there up to about the 1st of December.  As before\r\ndescribed, General Hood had three full corps of infantry--S. D.\r\nLee's, A. P. Stewart's, and Cheatham's, at Florence, Alabama--with\r\nForrest's corps of cavalry, numbering in the aggregate about\r\nforty-five thousand men.  General Thomas was in Nashville, Tennessee,\r\nquietly engaged in reorganizing his army out of the somewhat broken\r\nforces at his disposal.  He had posted his only two regular corps,\r\nthe Fourth and Twenty-third, under the general command of\r\nMajor-General J. M. Schofield, at Pulaski, directly in front of\r\nFlorence, with the three brigades of cavalry (Hatch, Croxton, and\r\nCapron), commanded by Major-General Wilson, watching closely for\r\nHood's initiative.\r\n\r\nThis force aggregated about thirty thousand men, was therefore\r\ninferior to the enemy; and General Schofield was instructed, in\r\ncase the enemy made a general advance, to fall back slowly toward\r\nNashville, fighting, till he should be reenforced by General Thomas\r\nin person.  Hood's movement was probably hurried by reason of my\r\nadvance into Georgia; for on the 17th his infantry columns marched\r\nfrom Florence in the direction of Waynesboro', turning, Schofield's\r\nposition at Pulaski.  The latter at once sent his trains to the\r\nrear, and on the 21st fell back to Columbia, Tennessee.  General\r\nHood  followed up this movement, skirmished lightly with Schofield\r\nat Columbia, began the passage of Duck River, below the town, and\r\nCheatham's corps reached the vicinity of Spring Hill, whither\r\nGeneral Schofield had sent General Stanley, with two of his\r\ndivisions, to cover the movement of his trains.  During the night\r\nof November 29th General Schofield passed Spring Hill with his\r\ntrains and army, and took post at Franklin, on the south aide of\r\nHarpeth River.  General Hood now attaches serious blame to General\r\nCheatham for not attacking General Schofield in flank while in\r\nmotion at Spring Hill, for he was bivouacked within eight hundred\r\nyards of the road at the time of the passage of our army.  General\r\nSchofield reached Franklin on the morning of November 30th, and\r\nposted his army in front of the town, where some\r\nrifle-intrenchments had been constructed in advance.  He had the\r\ntwo corps of Stanley and Cox (Fourth and Twenty-third), with\r\nWilson's cavalry on his flanks, and sent his trains behind the\r\nHarpeth.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hood closed upon him the same day, and assaulted his\r\nposition with vehemence, at one time breaking the line and wounding\r\nGeneral Stanley seriously; but our men were veterans, cool and\r\ndetermined, and fought magnificently.  The rebel officers led their\r\nmen in person to the several persistent assaults, continuing the\r\nbattle far into the night, when they drew off, beaten and\r\ndiscomfited.\r\n\r\nTheir loss was very severe, especially in general officers; among\r\nthem Generals Cleburn and Adams, division commanders.  Hood's loss\r\non that day was afterward ascertained to be (Thomas's report):\r\nBuried on the field, seventeen hundred and fifty; left in hospital\r\nat Franklin, thirty-eight hundred; and seven hundred and two\r\nprisoners captured and held: aggregate, six thousand two hundred\r\nand fifty-two.  General Schofields lose, reported officially, was\r\none hundred and eighty-nine killed, one thousand and thirty-three\r\nwounded, and eleven hundred and four prisoners or missing:\r\naggregate, twenty-three hundred and twenty-six.  The next day\r\nGeneral Schofield crossed the Harpeth without trouble, and fell\r\nback to the defenses of Nashville.\r\n\r\nMeantime General Thomas had organized the employees of the\r\nQuartermaster's Department into a corps, commanded by the\r\nchief-quartermaster, General J. Z. Donaldson, and placed them in the\r\nfortifications of Nashville, under the general direction of\r\nMajor-General Z. B. Tower, now of the United States Engineers.  He\r\nhad also received the two veteran divisions of the Sixteenth Corps,\r\nunder General A. J. Smith, long absent and long expected; and he\r\nhad drawn from Chattanooga and Decatur (Alabama) the divisions of\r\nSteedman and of R. S. Granger.  These, with General Schofields army\r\nand about ten thousand good cavalry, under General J.  H.  Wilson,\r\nconstituted a strong army, capable not only of defending Nashville,\r\nbut of beating Hood in the open field.  Yet Thomas remained inside\r\nof Nashville, seemingly passive, until General Hood had closed upon\r\nhim and had entrenched his position.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas had furthermore held fast to the railroad leading\r\nfrom Nashville to Chattanooga, leaving strong guards at its\r\nprincipal points, as at Murfreesboro', Deckerd, Stevenson,\r\nBridgeport, Whitesides, and Chattanooga.  At Murfreesboro' the\r\ndivision of Rousseau was reenforced and strengthened up to about\r\neight thousand men.\r\n\r\nAt that time the weather was cold and sleety, the ground was\r\ncovered with ice and snow, and both parties for a time rested on\r\nthe defensive.  Those matters stood at Nashville, while we were\r\nclosing down on Savannah, in the early part of December, 1864; and\r\nthe country, as well as General Grant, was alarmed at the seeming\r\npassive conduct of General Thomas; and General Grant at one time\r\nconsidered the situation so dangerous that he thought of going to\r\nNashville in person, but General John A. Logan, happening to be at\r\nCity Point, was sent out to supersede General Thomas; luckily for\r\nthe latter, he acted in time, gained a magnificent victory, and\r\nthus escaped so terrible a fate.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December, at my camp by the side of the plank-road,\r\neight miles back of Savannah, I received General Hardee's letter\r\ndeclining to surrender, when nothing remained but to assault.  The\r\nground was difficult, and, as all former assaults had proved so\r\nbloody, I concluded to make one more effort to completely surround\r\nSavannah on all aides, so as further to excite Hardee's fears, and,\r\nin case of success, to capture the whole of his army.  We had\r\nalready completely invested the place on the north, west, and\r\nsouth, but there remained to the enemy, on the east, the use of the\r\nold dike or plank-road leading into South Carolina, and I knew that\r\nHardee would have a pontoon-bridge across the river.  On examining\r\nmy maps, I thought that the division of John P. Hatch, belonging to\r\nGeneral Fosters command, might be moved from its then position at\r\nBroad River, by water, down to Bluffton, from which it could reach\r\nthis plank-road, fortify and hold it--at some risk, of course,\r\nbecause Hardee could avail himself of his central position to fall\r\non this detachment with his whole army.  I did not want to make a\r\nmistake like \"Ball's Bluff\" at that period of the war; so, taking\r\none or two of my personal staff, I rode back to Grog's Bridge,\r\nleaving with Generals Howard and Slocum orders to make all\r\npossible preparations, but not to attack, during my two or three\r\ndays' absence; and there I took a boat for Wassaw Sound, whence\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren conveyed me in his own boat (the Harvest Moon) to\r\nHilton Head, where I represented the matter to General Foster, and\r\nhe promptly agreed to give his personal attention to it.  During\r\nthe night of the 20th we started back, the wind blowing strong,\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren ordered the pilot of the Harvest Moon to run into\r\nTybee, and to work his way through to Wassaw Sound and the Ogeechee\r\nRiver by the Romney Marshes.  We were caught by a low tide and\r\nstuck in the mud.  After laboring some time, the admiral ordered\r\nout his barge; in it we pulled through this intricate and shallow\r\nchannel, and toward evening of December 21st we discovered, coming\r\ntoward us, a tug, called the Red Legs, belonging to the\r\nQuarter-master's Department, with a staff-officer on board, bearing\r\nletters from Colonel Dayton to myself and the admiral, reporting that\r\nthe city of Savannah had been found evacuated on the morning of\r\nDecember 21st, and was then in our possession.  General Hardee had\r\ncrossed the Savannah River by a pontoon-bridge, carrying off his men\r\nand light artillery, blowing up his iron-clads and navy-yard, but\r\nleaving for us all the heavy guns, stores, cotton, railway-cars,\r\nsteamboats, and an immense amount of public and private property.\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren concluded to go toward a vessel (the Sonoma) of his\r\nblockading fleet, which lay at anchor near Beaulieu, and I\r\ntransferred to the Red Legs, and hastened up the Ogeechee River to\r\nGrog's Bridge, whence I rode to my camp that same night. I there\r\nlearned that, early on the morning of December 21st, the skirmishers\r\nhad detected the absence of the enemy, and had occupied his lines\r\nsimultaneously along their whole extent; but the left flank (Slocum),\r\nespecially Geary's division of the Twentieth Corps, claimed to have\r\nbeen the first to reach the heart of the city.\r\n\r\nGenerals Slocum and Howard moved their headquarters at once into\r\nthe city, leaving the bulk of their troops in camps outside.  On\r\nthe morning of December 22d I followed with my own headquarters,\r\nand rode down Bull Street to the custom-house, from the roof of\r\nwhich we had an extensive view over the city, the river, and the\r\nvast extent of marsh and rice-fields on the South Carolina side.\r\nThe navy-yard, and the wreck of the iron-clad ram Savannah, were\r\nstill smouldering, but all else looked quiet enough.  Turning back,\r\nwe rode to the Pulaski Hotel, which I had known in years long gone,\r\nand found it kept by a Vermont man with a lame leg, who used to be\r\na clerk in the St. Louis Hotel, New Orleans, and I inquired about\r\nthe capacity of his hotel for headquarters.  He was very anxious to\r\nhave us for boarders, but I soon explained to him that we had a\r\nfull mess equipment along, and that we were not in the habit of\r\npaying board; that one wing of the building would suffice for our\r\nuse, while I would allow him to keep an hotel for the accommodation\r\nof officers and gentlemen in the remainder.  I then dispatched an\r\nofficer to look around for a livery-stable that could accommodate\r\nour horses, and, while waiting there, an English gentleman, Mr.\r\nCharles Green, came and said that he had a fine house completely\r\nfurnished, for which he had no use, and offered it as headquarters.\r\nHe explained, moreover, that General Howard had informed him, the\r\nday before, that I would want his house for headquarters.  At first\r\nI felt strongly disinclined to make use of any private dwelling,\r\nlest complaints should arise of damage and lose of furniture, and\r\nso expressed myself to Mr. Green; but, after riding about the city,\r\nand finding his house so spacious, so convenient, with large yard\r\nand stabling, I accepted his offer, and occupied that house during\r\nour stay in Savannah.  He only reserved for himself the use of a\r\ncouple of rooms above the dining-room, and we had all else, and a\r\nmost excellent house it was in all respects.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed that Hardee had escaped with his army, but on\r\nthe whole we had reason to be content with the substantial fruits\r\nof victory.  The Savannah River was found to be badly obstructed by\r\ntorpedoes, and by log piers stretched across the channel below the\r\ncity, which piers were filled with the cobble stones that formerly\r\npaved the streets.  Admiral Dahlgren was extremely active, visited\r\nme repeatedly in the city, while his fleet still watched\r\nCharleston, and all the avenues, for the blockade-runners that\r\ninfested the coast, which were notoriously owned and managed by\r\nEnglishmen, who used the island of New Providence (Nassau) as a\r\nsort of entrepot.  One of these small blockade-runners came into\r\nSavannah after we were in full possession, and the master did not\r\ndiscover his mistake till he came ashore to visit the custom-house.\r\nOf coarse his vessel fell a prize to the navy.  A heavy force was\r\nat once set to work to remove the torpedoes and obstructions in the\r\nmain channel of the river, and, from that time forth, Savannah\r\nbecame the great depot of supply for the troops operating in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nMeantime, on the 15th and 16th of December, were fought, in front\r\nof Nashville, the great battles in which General Thomas so nobly\r\nfulfilled his promise to ruin Hood, the details of which are fully\r\ngiven in his own official reports, long-since published.  Rumors of\r\nthese great victories reached us at Savannah by piecemeal, but his\r\nofficial report came on the 24th of December, with a letter from\r\nGeneral Grant, giving in general terms the events up to the 18th,\r\nand I wrote at once through my chief of staff, General Webster, to\r\nGeneral Thomas, complimenting him in the highest terms.  His\r\nbrilliant victory at Nashville was necessary to mine at Savannah to\r\nmake a complete whole, and this fact was perfectly comprehended by\r\nMr. Lincoln, who recognized it fully in his personal letter of\r\nDecember 26th, hereinbefore quoted at length, and which is also\r\nclaimed at the time, in my Special Field Order No. 6, of January 8,\r\n1865, here given:\r\n\r\n(Special Field Order No. 6.)\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, January 8, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe general commanding announces to the troops composing the\r\nMilitary Division of the Mississippi that he has received from the\r\nPresident of the United States, and from Lieutenant-General Grant,\r\nletters conveying their high sense and appreciation of the campaign\r\njust closed, resulting in the capture of Savannah and the defeat of\r\nHood's army in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nIn order that all may understand the importance of events, it is\r\nproper to revert to the situation of affairs in September last.  We\r\nheld Atlanta, a city of little value to us, but so important to the\r\nenemy that Mr. Davis, the head of the rebellious faction in the\r\nSouth, visited his army near Palmetto, and commanded it to regain\r\nthe place and also to ruin and destroy us, by a series of measures\r\nwhich he thought would be effectual.  That army, by a rapid march,\r\ngained our railroad near Big Shanty, and afterward about Dalton.\r\nWe pursued it, but it moved so rapidly that we could not overtake\r\nit, and General Hood led his army successfully far over toward\r\nMississippi, in hope to decoy us out of Georgia.  But we were not\r\nthus to be led away by him, and preferred to lead and control\r\nevents ourselves.  Generals Thomas and Schofield, commanding the\r\ndepartments to our rear, returned to their posts and prepared to\r\ndecoy General Hood into their meshes, while we came on to complete\r\nthe original journey.  We quietly and deliberately destroyed\r\nAtlanta, and all the railroads which the enemy had used to carry on\r\nwar against us, occupied his State capital, and then captured his\r\ncommercial capital, which had been so strongly fortified from the\r\nsea as to defy approach from that quarter.  Almost at the moment of\r\nour victorious entry into Savannah came the welcome and expected\r\nnews that our comrades in Tennessee had also fulfilled nobly and\r\nwell their part, had decoyed General Hood to Nashville and then\r\nturned on him, defeating his army thoroughly, capturing all his\r\nartillery, great numbers of prisoners, and were still pursuing the\r\nfragments down in Alabama.  So complete success in military\r\noperations, extending over half a continent, is an achievement that\r\nentitles it to a place in the military history of the world.  The\r\narmies serving in Georgia and Tennessee, as well as the local\r\ngarrisons of Decatur, Bridgeport, Chattanooga, and Murfreesboro',\r\nare alike entitled to the common honors, and each regiment may\r\ninscribe on its colors, at pleasure, the word \"Savannah\" or\r\n\"Nashville.\"  The general commanding embraces, in the same general\r\nsuccess, the operations of the cavalry under Generals Stoneman,\r\nBurbridge, and Gillem, that penetrated into Southwest Virginia, and\r\nparalyzed the efforts of the enemy to disturb the peace and safety\r\nof East Tennessee.  Instead of being put on the defensive, we have\r\nat all points assumed the bold offensive, and have completely\r\nthwarted the designs of the enemies of our country.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\nL.  M.  DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere terminated the \"March to the Sea,\" and I only add a few\r\nletters, selected out of many, to illustrate the general feeling of\r\nrejoicing throughout the country at the time.  I only regarded the\r\nmarch from Atlanta to Savannah as a \"shift of base,\" as the\r\ntransfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and had finished\r\nits then work, from the interior to a point on the sea-coast, from\r\nwhich it could achieve other important results.  I considered this\r\nmarch as a means to an end, and not as an essential act of war.\r\nStill, then, as now, the march to the sea was generally regarded as\r\nsomething extraordinary, something anomalous, something out of the\r\nusual order of events; whereas, in fact, I simply moved from\r\nAtlanta to Savannah, as one step in the direction of Richmond, a\r\nmovement that had to be met and defeated, or the war was\r\nnecessarily at an end.\r\n\r\nWere I to express my measure of the relative importance of the\r\nmarch to the sea, and of that from Savannah northward, I would\r\nplace the former at one, and the latter at ten, or the maximum.\r\n\r\nI now close this long chapter by giving a tabular statement of the\r\nlosses during the march, and the number of prisoners captured.  The\r\nproperty captured consisted of horses and mules by the thousand,\r\nand of quantities of subsistence stores that aggregate very large,\r\nbut may be measured with sufficient accuracy by assuming that\r\nsixty-five thousand men obtained abundant food for about forty\r\ndays, and thirty-five thousand animals were fed for a like period,\r\nso as to reach Savannah in splendid flesh and condition.  I also\r\nadd a few of the more important letters that passed between\r\nGenerals Grant, Halleck, and myself, which illustrate our opinions\r\nat that stage of the war:\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF CASUALTIES AND PRISONERS CAPTURED BY THE ARMY IN THE\r\nFIELD, CAMPAIGN OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n   Killed        Wounded         Missing       Captured\r\nOfficers/Men   Officers/Men   Officers/Men   Officers/Men\r\n   10    93        24   404       1    277       77  1,261\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, December 16, 1864\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN (via Hilton Head).\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Lieutenant-General Grant informs me that, in his last\r\ndispatch sent to you, he suggested the transfer of your infantry to\r\nRichmond.  He now wishes me to say that you will retain your entire\r\nforce, at least for the present, and, with such assistance as may\r\nbe given you by General Foster and Admiral Dahlgren, operate from\r\nsuch base as you may establish on the coast.  General Foster will\r\nobey such instructions as may be given by you.\r\n\r\nShould you have captured Savannah, it is thought that by\r\ntransferring the water-batteries to the land side that place may be\r\nmade a good depot and base of operations on Augusta, Branchville,\r\nor Charleston.  If Savannah should not be captured, or if captured\r\nand not deemed suitable for this purpose, perhaps Beaufort would\r\nserve as a depot.  As the rebels have probably removed their most\r\nvaluable property from Augusta, perhaps Branchville would be the\r\nmost important point at which to strike in order to sever all\r\nconnection between Virginia and the Southwestern Railroad.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's wishes, however, are, that this whole matter of\r\nyour future actions should be entirely left to your discretion.\r\n\r\nWe can send you from here a number of complete batteries of\r\nfield-artillery, with or without horses, as you may desire; also, as\r\nsoon as General Thomas can spare them, all the fragments,\r\nconvalescents, and furloughed men of your army.  It is reported that\r\nThomas defeated Hood yesterday, near Nashville, but we have no\r\nparticulars nor official reports, telegraphic communication being\r\ninterrupted by a heavy storm.\r\n\r\nOur last advises from you was General Howard's note, announcing his\r\napproach to Savannah.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, December 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, Savannah (via Hilton Head).\r\n\r\nMy DEAR GENERAL: Yours of the 13th, by Major Anderson, is just\r\nreceived.  I congratulate you on your splendid success, and shall\r\nvery soon expect to hear of the crowning work of your campaign--the\r\ncapture of Savannah.  Your march will stand out prominently as the\r\ngreat one of this great war.  When Savannah falls, then for another\r\nwide swath through the centre of the Confederacy.  But I will not\r\nanticipate.  General Grant is expected here this morning, and will\r\nprobably write you his own views.\r\n\r\nI do not learn from your letter, or from Major Anderson, that you\r\nare in want of any thing which we have not provided at Hilton Head.\r\nThinking it probable that you might want more field-artillery, I\r\nhad prepared several batteries, but the great difficulty of\r\nforaging horses on the sea-coast will prevent our sending any\r\nunless you actually need them.  The hay-crop this year is short,\r\nand the Quartermaster's Department has great difficulty in\r\nprocuring a supply for our animals.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas has defeated Hood, near Nashville, and it is hoped\r\nthat he will completely, crush his army.  Breckenridge, at last\r\naccounts, was trying to form a junction near Murfreesboro', but, as\r\nThomas is between them, Breckenridge must either retreat or be\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosecrans made very bad work of it in Missouri, allowing\r\nPrice with a small force to overrun the State and destroy millions\r\nof property.\r\n\r\nOrders have been issued for all officers and detachments having\r\nthree months or more to serve, to rejoin your army via Savannah.\r\nThose having less than three months to serve, will be retained by\r\nGeneral Thomas.\r\n\r\nShould you capture Charleston, I hope that by some accident the\r\nplace may be destroyed, and, if a little salt should be sown upon\r\nits site, it may prevent the growth of future crops of\r\nnullification and secession.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, December 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nTo Major-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nMy DEAR GENERAL: I have just received and read, I need not tell you\r\nwith how mush gratification, your letter to General Halleck.  I\r\ncongratulate you and the brave officers and men under your command\r\non the successful termination of your most brilliant campaign.  I\r\nnever had a doubt of the result.  When apprehensions for your\r\nsafety were expressed by the President, I assured him with the army\r\nyou had, and you in command of it, there was no danger but you\r\nwould strike bottom on salt-water some place; that I would not feel\r\nthe same security--in fact, would not have intrusted the expedition\r\nto any other living commander.\r\n\r\nIt has been very hard work to get Thomas to attack Hood.  I gave\r\nhim the most peremptory order, and had started to go there myself,\r\nbefore he got off.  He has done magnificently, however, since he\r\nstarted.  Up to last night, five thousand prisoners and forty-nine\r\npieces of captured artillery, besides many wagons and innumerable\r\nsmall-arms, had been received in Nashville.  This is exclusive of\r\nthe enemy's loss at Franklin, which amounted to thirteen general\r\nofficers killed, wounded, and captured.  The enemy probably lost\r\nfive thousand men at Franklin, and ten thousand in the last three\r\ndays' operations.  Breckenridge is said to be making for\r\nMurfreesboro'.\r\n\r\nI think he is in a most excellent place.  Stoneman has nearly wiped\r\nout John Morgan's old command, and five days ago entered Bristol.\r\nI did think the best thing to do was to bring the greater part of\r\nyour army here, and wipe out Lee.  The turn affairs now seem to be\r\ntaking has shaken me in that opinion.  I doubt whether you may not\r\naccomplish more toward that result where you are than if brought\r\nhere, especially as I am informed, since my arrival in the city,\r\nthat it would take about two months to get you here with all the\r\nother calls there are for ocean transportation.\r\n\r\nI want to get your views about what ought to be done, and what can\r\nbe done.  If you capture the garrison of Savannah, it certainly\r\nwill compel Lee to detach from Richmond, or give us nearly the\r\nwhole South.  My own opinion is that Lee is averse to going out of\r\nVirginia, and if the cause of the South is lost he wants Richmond\r\nto be the last place surrendered.  If he has such views, it may be\r\nwell to indulge him until we get every thing else in our hands.\r\n\r\nCongratulating you and the army again upon the splendid results of\r\nyour campaign, the like of which is not read of in past history, I\r\nsubscribe myself, more than ever, if possible, your friend,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, Savannah, Georgia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your very interesting letter of the 22d inst., brought by\r\nMajor Grey of General Foster's staff; is fast at hand.  As the\r\nmajor starts back at once, I can do no more at present than simply\r\nacknowledge its receipt.  The capture of Savannah, with all its\r\nimmense stores, must tell upon the people of the South.  All well\r\nhere.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nSAVANNAH, GEORGIA, December 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, City Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your letter of December 18th is just received.  I feel\r\nvery much gratified at receiving the handsome commendation you pay\r\nmy army.  I will, in general orders, convey to the officers and men\r\nthe substance of your note.\r\n\r\nI am also pleased that you have modified your former orders, for I\r\nfeared that the transportation by sea would very much disturb the\r\nunity and morale of my army, now so perfect.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Savannah, which I have heretofore reported,\r\ncompletes the first part of our game, and fulfills a great part of\r\nyour instructions; and we are now engaged in dismantling the rebel\r\nforts which bear upon the sea-channels, and transferring the heavy\r\nordnance and ammunition to Fort Pulaski and Hilton Head, where they\r\ncan be more easily guarded than if left in the city.\r\n\r\nThe rebel inner lines are well adapted to our purpose, and with\r\nslight modifications can be held by a comparatively small force;\r\nand in about ten days I expect to be ready to sally forth again.  I\r\nfeel no doubt whatever as to our future plans.  I have thought them\r\nover so long and well that they appear as clear as daylight.  I\r\nleft Augusta untouched on purpose, because the enemy will be in\r\ndoubt as to my objective point, after we cross the Savannah River,\r\nwhether it be Augusta or Charleston, and will naturally divide his\r\nforces.  I will then move either on Branchville or Colombia, by any\r\ncurved line that gives us the best supplies, breaking up in our\r\ncourse as much railroad as possible; then, ignoring Charleston and\r\nAugusta both, I would occupy Columbia and Camden, pausing there\r\nlong enough to observe the effect.  I would then strike for the\r\nCharleston & Wilmington Railroad, somewhere between the Santee and\r\nCape Fear Rivers, and, if possible, communicate with the fleet\r\nunder Admiral Dahlgren (whom I find a most agreeable gentleman,\r\naccommodating himself to our wishes and plans).  Then I would favor\r\nan attack on Wilmington, in the belief that Porter and Butler will\r\nfail in their present undertaking.  Charleston is now a mere\r\ndesolated wreck, and is hardly worth the time it would take to\r\nstarve it out.  Still, I am aware that, historically and\r\npolitically, much importance is attached to the place, and it may\r\nbe that, apart from its military importance, both you and the\r\nAdministration may prefer I should give it more attention; and it\r\nwould be well for you to give me some general idea on that subject,\r\nfor otherwise I would treat it as I have expressed, as a point of\r\nlittle importance, after all its railroads leading into the\r\ninterior have been destroyed or occupied by us.  But, on the\r\nhypothesis of ignoring Charleston and taking Wilmington, I would\r\nthen favor a movement direct on Raleigh.  The game is then up with\r\nLee, unless he comes out of Richmond, avoids you and fights me; in\r\nwhich case I should reckon on your being on his heels.  Now that\r\nHood is used up by Thomas, I feel disposed to bring the matter to\r\nan issue as quick as possible.  I feel confident that I can break\r\nup the whole railroad system of South Carolina and North Carolina,\r\nand be on the Roanoke, either at Raleigh or Weldon, by the time\r\nspring fairly opens; and, if you feel confident that you can whip\r\nLee outside of his intrenchments, I feel equally confident that I\r\ncan handle him in the open country.\r\n\r\nOne reason why I would ignore Charleston is this: that I believe\r\nHardee will reduce the garrison to a small force, with plenty of\r\nprovisions; I know that the neck back of Charleston can be made\r\nimpregnable to assault, and we will hardly have time for siege\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nI will have to leave in Savannah a garrison, and, if Thomas can\r\nspare them, I would like to have all detachments, convalescents,\r\netc., belonging to these four corps, sent forward at once.  I do\r\nnot want to cripple Thomas, because I regard his operations as\r\nall-important, and I have ordered him to pursue Hood down into\r\nAlabama, trusting to the country for supplies.\r\n\r\nI reviewed one of my corps to-day, and shall continue to review the\r\nwhole army.  I do not like to boast, but believe this army has a\r\nconfidence in itself that makes it almost invincible.  I wish you\r\ncould run down and see us; it would have a good effect, and show to\r\nboth armies that they are acting on a common plan.  The weather is\r\nnow cool and pleasant, and the general health very good. Your true\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, December 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General H. W. HALLECK, Chief-of-Staff; Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I had the pleasure of receiving your two letters of the\r\n16th and 18th instant to-day, and feel more than usually flattered\r\nby the high encomiums you have passed on our recent campaign, which\r\nis now complete by the occupation of Savannah.\r\n\r\nI am also very glad that General Grant has changed his mind about\r\nembarking my troops for James River, leaving me free to make the\r\nbroad swath you describe through South and North Carolina; and\r\nstill more gratified at the news from Thomas, in Tennessee, because\r\nit fulfills my plans, which contemplated his being able to dispose\r\nof Hood, in case he ventured north of the Tennessee River.  So, I\r\nthink, on the whole, I can chuckle over Jeff. Davis's\r\ndisappointment in not turning my Atlanta campaign into a \"Moscow\r\ndisaster.\"\r\n\r\nI have just finished a long letter to General Grant, and have\r\nexplained to him that we are engaged in shifting our base from the\r\nOgeeohee to the Savannah River, dismantling all the forts made by\r\nthe enemy to bear upon the salt-water channels, transferring the\r\nheavy ordnance, etc., to Fort Pulaski and Hilton Head, and in\r\nremodeling the enemy's interior lines to suit our future plans and\r\npurposes.  I have also laid down the programme for a campaign which\r\nI can make this winter, and which will put me in the spring on the\r\nRoanoke, in direct communication with General Grant on James River.\r\nIn general terms, my plan is to turn over to General Foster the\r\ncity of Savannah, to sally forth with my army resupplied, cross the\r\nSavannah, feign on Charleston and Augusta, but strike between,\r\nbreaking en route the Charleston & Augusta Railroad, also a large\r\npart of that from Branchville and Camden toward North Carolina, and\r\nthen rapidly to move for some point of the railroad from Charleston\r\nto Wilmington, between the Santee and Cape Fear Rivers; then,\r\ncommunicating with the fleet in the neighborhood of Georgetown, I\r\nwould turn upon Wilmington or Charleston, according to the\r\nimportance of either.  I rather prefer Wilmington, as a live place,\r\nover Charleston, which is dead and unimportant when its railroad\r\ncommunications are broken.  I take it for granted that the present\r\nmovement on Wilmington will fail.  If I should determine to take\r\nCharleston, I would turn across the country (which I have hunted\r\nover many a time) from Santee to Mount Pleasant, throwing one wing\r\non the peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper.  After\r\naccomplishing one or other of these ends, I would make a bee-line\r\nfor Raleigh or Weldon, when Lee world be forced to come out of\r\nRichmond, or acknowledge himself beaten. He would, I think, by the\r\nuse of the Danville Railroad, throw himself rapidly between me and\r\nGrant, leaving Richmond in the hands of the latter.  This would not\r\nalarm me, for I have an army which I think can maneuver, and I\r\nworld force him to attack me at a disadvantage, always under the\r\nsupposition that Grant would be on his heels; and, if the worst\r\ncome to the worst, I can fight my way down to Albermarle Sound, or\r\nNewbern.\r\n\r\nI think the time has come now when we should attempt the boldest\r\nmoves, and my experience is, that they are easier of execution than\r\nmore timid ones, because the enemy is disconcerted by them--as, for\r\ninstance, my recent campaign.\r\n\r\nI also doubt the wisdom of concentration beyond a certain extent,\r\nfor the roads of this country limit the amount of men that can be\r\nbrought to bear in any one battle, and I do not believe that any\r\none general can handle more than sixty thousand men in battle.\r\n\r\nI think our campaign of the last month, as well as every step I\r\ntake from this point northward, is as much a direct attack upon\r\nLee's army as though we were operating within the sound of his\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nI am very anxious that Thomas should follow up his success to the\r\nvery utmost point. My orders to him before I left Kingston were,\r\nafter beating Hood, to follow him as far as Columbus, Mississippi,\r\nor Selma, Alabama, both of which lie in districts of country which\r\nare rich in corn and meat.\r\n\r\nI attach more importance to these deep incisions into the enemy's\r\ncountry, because this war differs from European wars in this\r\nparticular: we are not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile\r\npeople, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard\r\nhand of war, as well as their organized armies.  I know that this\r\nrecent movement of mine through Georgia has had a wonderful effect\r\nin this respect.  Thousands who had been deceived by their lying\r\nnewspapers to believe that we were being whipped all the time now\r\nrealize the truth, and have no appetite for a repetition of the\r\nsame experience.  To be sure, Jeff. Davis has his people under\r\npretty good discipline, but I think faith in him is much shaken in\r\nGeorgia, and before we have done with her South Carolina will not\r\nbe quite so tempestuous.\r\n\r\nI will bear in mind your hint as to Charleston, and do not think\r\n\"salt\" will be necessary.  When I move, the Fifteenth Corps will be\r\non the right of the right wing, and their position will naturally\r\nbring them into Charleston first; and, if you have watched the\r\nhistory of that corps, you will have remarked that they generally\r\ndo their work pretty well.  The truth is, the whole army is burning\r\nwith an insatiable desire to wreak vengeance upon South Carolina.\r\nI almost tremble at her fate, but feel that she deserves all that\r\nseems in store for her.\r\n\r\nMany and many a person in Georgia asked me why we did not go to\r\nSouth Carolina; and, when I answered that we were enroute for that\r\nState, the invariable reply was, \"Well, if you will make those\r\npeople feel the utmost severities of war, we will pardon you for\r\nyour desolation of Georgia.\"\r\n\r\nI look upon Colombia as quite as bad as Charleston, and I doubt if\r\nwe shall spare the public buildings there as we did at\r\nMilledgeville.\r\n\r\nI have been so busy lately that I have not yet made my official\r\nreport, and I think I had better wait until I get my subordinate\r\nreports before attempting it, as I am anxious to explain clearly\r\nnot only the reasons for every step, but the amount of execution\r\ndone, and this I cannot do until I get the subordinate reports; for\r\nwe marched the whole distance in four or more columns, and, of\r\ncourse, I could only be present with one, and generally that one\r\nengaged in destroying railroads.  This work of destruction was\r\nperformed better than usual, because I had an engineer-regiment,\r\nprovided with claws to twist the bars after being heated.  Such\r\nbars can never be used again, and the only way in which a railroad\r\nline can be reconstructed across Georgia is, to make a new road\r\nfrom Fairburn Station (twenty-four miles southwest of Atlanta) to\r\nMadison, a distance of one hundred miles; and, before that can be\r\ndone, I propose to be on the road from Augusta to Charleston, which\r\nis a continuation of the same.  I felt somewhat disappointed at\r\nHardee's escape, but really am not to blame.  I moved as quickly as\r\npossible to close up the \"Union Causeway,\" but intervening\r\nobstacles were such that, before I could get troops on the road,\r\nHardee had slipped out.  Still, I know that the men that were in\r\nSavannah will be lost in a measure to Jeff. Davis, for the Georgia\r\ntroops, under G. W. Smith, declared they would not fight in South\r\nCarolina, and they have gone north, en route for Augusta, and I\r\nhave reason to believe the North Carolina troops have gone to\r\nWilmington; in other words, they are scattered.  I have reason to\r\nbelieve that Beauregard was present in Savannah at the time of its\r\nevacuation, and think that he and Hardee are now in Charleston,\r\nmaking preparations for what they suppose will be my next step.\r\n\r\nPlease say to the President that I have received his kind message\r\n(through Colonel Markland), and feel thankful for his high favor.\r\nIf I disappoint him in the future, it shall not be from want of\r\nzeal or love to the cause.\r\n\r\nFrom you I expect a full and frank criticism of my plans for the\r\nfuture, which may enable me to correct errors before it is too\r\nlate.  I do not wish to be rash, but want to give my rebel friends\r\nno chance to accuse us of want of enterprise or courage.\r\n\r\nAssuring you of my high personal respect, I remain, as ever, your\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Order No. 3.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE\r\nWASHINGTON, January 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives\r\nis published to the army:\r\n\r\n[PUBLIC RESOLUTION--No. 4.]\r\n\r\nJoint resolution tendering the thanks of the people and of Congress\r\nto Major-General William T.

A. NICHOLS, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSAVANNAH AND POCOTALIGO.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1884, AND JANUARY, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe city of Savannah was an old place, and usually accounted a\r\nhandsome one.  Its houses were of brick or frame, with large yards,\r\nornamented with shrubbery and flowers; its streets perfectly\r\nregular, crossing each other at right angles; and at many of the\r\nintersections were small inclosures in the nature of parks.  These\r\nstreets and parks were lined with the handsomest shade-trees of\r\nwhich I have knowledge, viz., the Willow-leaf live-oak, evergreens\r\nof exquisite beauty; and these certainly entitled Savannah to its\r\nreputation as a handsome town more than the houses, which, though\r\ncomfortable, would hardly make a display on Fifth Avenue or the\r\nBoulevard Haussmann of Paris.  The city was built on a plateau of\r\nsand about forty feet above the level of the sea, abutting against\r\nthe river, leaving room along its margin for a street of stores and\r\nwarehouses.  The customhouse, court-house, post-office, etc., were\r\non the plateau above.  In rear of Savannah was a large park, with a\r\nfountain, and between it and the court-house was a handsome\r\nmonument, erected to the memory of Count Pulaski, who fell in 1779\r\nin the assault made on the city at the time it was held by the\r\nEnglish during the Revolutionary War.  Outside of Savannah there\r\nwas very little to interest a stranger, except the cemetery of\r\nBonaventura, and the ride along the Wilmington Channel by way of\r\nThunderbolt, where might be seen some groves of the majestic\r\nlive-oak trees, covered with gray and funereal moss, which were\r\ntruly sublime in grandeur, but gloomy after a few days' camping\r\nunder them:\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of taking up my quarters in Mr. Green's house, Mr.\r\nA. G. Browne, of Salem, Massachusetts, United States Treasury agent\r\nfor the Department of the South, made his appearance to claim\r\npossession, in the name of the Treasury Department, of all captured\r\ncotton, rice, buildings, etc.  Having use for these articles\r\nourselves, and having fairly earned them, I did not feel inclined\r\nto surrender possession, and explained to him that the\r\nquartermaster and commissary could manage them more to my liking\r\nthan he; but I agreed, after the proper inventories had been\r\nprepared, if there remained any thing for which we had no special\r\nuse, I would turn it over to him.  It was then known that in the\r\nwarehouses were stored at least twenty-five thousand bales of\r\ncotton, and in the forts one hundred and fifty large, heavy\r\nsea-coast guns: although afterward, on a more careful count, there\r\nproved to be more than two hundred and fifty sea-coast or siege\r\nguns, and thirty-one thousand bales of cotton.  At that interview\r\nMr. Browne, who was a shrewd, clever Yankee, told me that a vessel\r\nwas on the point of starting for Old Point Comfort, and, if she had\r\ngood weather off Cape Hatteras, would reach Fortress Monroe by\r\nChristmas-day, and he suggested that I might make it the occasion\r\nof sending a welcome Christmas gift to the President, Mr. Lincoln,\r\nwho peculiarly enjoyed such pleasantry.  I accordingly sat down and\r\nwrote on a slip of paper, to be left at the telegraph-office at\r\nFortress Monroe for transmission, the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVANNAH GEORGIA, December 22, 1884.\r\nTo His Excellency President Lincoln, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nI beg to present you as a Christmas-gift the city of Savannah, with\r\none hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, also\r\nabout twenty five thousand bales of cotton.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message actually reached him on Christmas-eve, was extensively\r\npublished in the newspapers, and made many a household unusually\r\nhappy on that festive day; and it was in the answer to this\r\ndispatch that Mr. Lincoln wrote me the letter of December 28th,\r\nalready given, beginning with the words, \"many, many thanks,\" etc.,\r\nwhich he sent at the hands of General John A.  Logan, who happened\r\nto be in Washington, and was coming to Savannah, to rejoin his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of December were made the following general orders for\r\nthe disposition of the troops in and about Savannah:\r\n\r\n[Special Field Order No. 139.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, December 23, 1864.\r\n\r\nSavannah, being now in our possession, the river partially cleared\r\nout, and measures having been taken to remove all obstructions,\r\nwill at once be made a grand depot for future operations:\r\n\r\n1.  The chief-quartermaster, General Euston, will, after giving the\r\nnecessary orders touching the transports in Ogeechee River and\r\nOasabaw Sound, come in person to Savannah, and take possession of\r\nall public buildings, vacant storerooms, warehouses, etc., that may\r\nbe now or hereafter needed for any department of the army.  No\r\nrents will be paid by the Government of the United States during\r\nthe war, and all buildings must be distributed according to the\r\naccustomed rates of the Quartermaster's Department, as though they\r\nwere public property.\r\n\r\n2.  The chief commissary of subsistence, Colonel A.  Beckwith, will\r\ntransfer the grand depot of the army to the city of Savannah,\r\nsecure possession of the needful buildings and offices, and give\r\nthe necessary orders, to the end that the army may be supplied\r\nabundantly and well.\r\n\r\n3.  The chief-engineer, Captain Poe, will at once direct which of\r\nthe enemy's forts are to be retained for our use, and which\r\ndismantled and destroyed.  The chief ordnance-officer, Captain\r\nBaylor, will in like manner take possession of all property\r\npertaining to his department captured from the enemy, and cause the\r\nsame to be collected and conveyed to points of security; all the\r\nheavy coast-guns will be dismounted and carried to Fort Pulaski.\r\n\r\n4.  The troops, for the present, will be grouped about the city of\r\nSavannah, looking to convenience of camps; General Slocum taking\r\nfrom the Savannah River around to the seven-mile post on the Canal,\r\nand General Howard thence to the sea; General Kilpatrick will hold\r\nKing's Bridge until Fort McAllister is dismantled, and the troops\r\nwithdrawn from the south side of the Ogeechee, when he will take\r\npost about Anderson's plantation, on the plank-road, and picket all\r\nthe roads leading from the north and west.\r\n\r\n5.  General Howard will keep a small guard at Forts Rosedale,\r\nBeaulieu, Wimberley, Thunderbolt, and Bonaventura, and he will\r\ncause that shore and Skidaway Island to be examined very closely,\r\nwith a view to finding many and convenient points for the\r\nembarkation of troops and wagons on seagoing vessels.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\n\r\nL.  M. DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Order No. 143.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, December 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe city of Savannah and surrounding country will be held as a\r\nmilitary post, and adapted to future military uses, but, as it\r\ncontains a population of some twenty thousand people, who must be\r\nprovided for, and as other citizens may come, it is proper to lay\r\ndown certain general principles, that all within its military\r\njurisdiction may understand their relative duties and obligations.\r\n\r\n1.  During war, the military is superior to civil authority, and,\r\nwhere interests clash, the civil must give way; yet, where there is\r\nno conflict, every encouragement should be given to well-disposed\r\nand peaceful inhabitants to resume their usual pursuits.  Families\r\nshould be disturbed as little as possible in their residences, and\r\ntradesmen allowed the free use of their shops, tools, etc.;\r\nchurches, schools, and all places of amusement and recreation,\r\nshould be encouraged, and streets and roads made perfectly safe to\r\npersons in their pursuits.  Passes should not be exacted within the\r\nline of outer pickets, but if any person shall abuse these\r\nprivileges by communicating with the enemy, or doing any act of\r\nhostility to the Government of the United States, he or she will be\r\npunished with the utmost rigor of the law.  Commerce with the outer\r\nworld will be resumed to an extent commensurate with the wants of\r\nthe citizens, governed by the restrictions and rules of the\r\nTreasury Department.\r\n\r\n2.  The chief quartermaster and commissary of the army may give\r\nsuitable employment to the people, white and black, or transport\r\nthem to such points as they may choose where employment can be had;\r\nand may extend temporary relief in the way of provisions and vacant\r\nhouses to the worthy and needy, until such time as they can help\r\nthemselves.  They will select first the buildings for the necessary\r\nuses of the army; next, a sufficient number of stores, to be turned\r\nover to the Treasury agent for trade-stores.  All vacant\r\nstore-houses or dwellings, and all buildings belonging to absent\r\nrebels, will be construed and used as belonging to the United States,\r\nuntil such time as their titles can be settled by the courts of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n8.  The Mayor and City Council of Savannah will continue to\r\nexercise their functions, and will, in concert with the commanding\r\nofficer of the post and the chief-quartermaster, see that the\r\nfire-companies are kept in organization, the streets cleaned and\r\nlighted, and keep up a good understanding between the citizens and\r\nsoldiers.  They will ascertain and report to the chief commissary\r\nof subsistence, as soon as possible, the names and number of worthy\r\nfamilies that need assistance and support.  The mayor will forth\r\nwith give public notice that the time has come when all must choose\r\ntheir course, viz., remain within our lines, and conduct themselves\r\nas good citizens, or depart in peace.  He will ascertain the names\r\nof all who choose to leave Savannah, and report their names and\r\nresidence to the chief-quartermaster, that measures may be taken to\r\ntransport them beyond our lines.\r\n\r\n4.  Not more than two newspapers will be published in Savannah;\r\ntheir editors and proprietors will be held to the strictest\r\naccountability, and will be punished severely, in person and\r\nproperty, for any libelous publication, mischievous matter,\r\npremature news, exaggerated statements, or any comments whatever\r\nupon the acts of the constituted authorities; they will be held\r\naccountable for such articles, even though copied from other\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\n\r\nL.  M.  DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that there were about twenty thousand inhabitants\r\nin Savannah, all of whom had participated more or less in the war,\r\nand had no special claims to our favor, but I regarded the war as\r\nrapidly drawing to a close, and it was becoming a political\r\nquestion as to what was to be done with the people of the South,\r\nboth white and black, when the war was actually over.  I concluded\r\nto give them the option to remain or to join their friends in\r\nCharleston or Augusta, and so announced in general orders.  The\r\nmayor, Dr. Arnold, was completely \"subjugated,\" and, after\r\nconsulting with him, I authorized him to assemble his City Council\r\nto take charge generally of the interests of the people; but warned\r\nall who remained that they must be strictly subordinate to the\r\nmilitary law, and to the interests of the General Government.\r\nAbout two hundred persona, mostly the families of men in the\r\nConfederate army, prepared to follow the fortunes of their husbands\r\nand fathers, and these were sent in a steamboat under a flag of\r\ntruce, in charge of my aide Captain Audenried, to Charleston\r\nharbor, and there delivered to an officer of the Confederate army.\r\nBut the great bulk of the inhabitants chose to remain in Savannah,\r\ngenerally behaved with propriety, and good social relations at once\r\narose between them and the army.  Shortly after our occupation of\r\nSavannah, a lady was announced at my headquarters by the orderly or\r\nsentinel at the front-door, who was ushered into the parlor, and\r\nproved to be the wife of General G. W. Smith, whom I had known\r\nabout 1850, when Smith was on duty at West Point.  She was a native\r\nof New London, Connecticut, and very handsome.  She began her\r\ninterview by presenting me a letter from her husband, who then\r\ncommanded a division of the Georgia militia in the rebel army,\r\nwhich had just quitted Savannah, which letter began, \"DEAR SHERMAN:\r\nThe fortunes of war, etc-., compel me to leave my wife in Savannah,\r\nand I beg for her your courteous protection,\" etc., etc.  I\r\ninquired where she lived, and if anybody was troubling her.  She\r\nsaid she was boarding with a lady whose husband had, in like manner\r\nwith her own, gone off with Hardee's army; that a part of the house\r\nhad been taken for the use of Major-General Ward, of Kentucky; that\r\nher landlady was approaching her confinement, and was nervous at\r\nthe noise which the younger staff-officers made at night; etc.  I\r\nexplained to her that I could give but little personal attention to\r\nsuch matters, and referred her to General Slocum, whose troops\r\noccupied the city.  I afterward visited her house, and saw,\r\npersonally, that she had no reason to complain.  Shortly afterward\r\nMr. Hardee, a merchant of Savannah, came to me and presented a\r\nletter from his brother, the general, to the same effect, alleging\r\nthat his brother was a civilian, had never taken up arms, and asked\r\nof me protection for his family, his cotton, etc.  To him I gave\r\nthe general assurance that no harm was designed to any of the\r\npeople of Savannah who would remain quiet and peaceable, but that I\r\ncould give him no guarantee as to his cotton, for over it I had no\r\nabsolute control; and yet still later I received a note from the\r\nwife of General A. P. Stewart (who commanded a corps in Hood's\r\narmy), asking me to come to see her.  This I did, and found her to\r\nbe a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, wanting protection, and who was\r\nnaturally anxious about the fate of her husband, known to be with\r\nGeneral Hood, in Tennessee, retreating before General Thomas.  I\r\nremember that I was able to assure her that he had not been killed\r\nor captured, up to that date, and think that I advised her, instead\r\nof attempting to go in pursuit of her husband, to go to Cincinnati,\r\nto her uncle, Judge Storer, there await the issue of events.\r\n\r\nBefore I had reached Savannah, and during our stay there, the rebel\r\nofficers and newspapers represented the conduct of the men of our\r\narmy as simply infamous; that we respected neither age nor sex;\r\nthat we burned every thing we came across--barns, stables,\r\ncotton-gins, and even dwelling-houses; that we ravished the women\r\nand killed the men, and perpetrated all manner of outrages on the\r\ninhabitants.  Therefore it struck me as strange that Generals\r\nHardee and Smith should commit their, families to our custody, and\r\neven bespeak our personal care and attention.  These officers knew\r\nwell that these reports were exaggerated in the extreme, and yet\r\ntacitly assented to these publications, to arouse the drooping\r\nenergies of the people of the South.\r\n\r\nAs the division of Major-General John W. Geary, of the Twentieth\r\nCorps, was the first to enter Savannah, that officer was appointed\r\nto command the place, or to act as a sort of governor.  He very\r\nsoon established a good police, maintained admirable order, and I\r\ndoubt if Savannah, either before or since, has had a better\r\ngovernment than during our stay.  The guard-mountings and parades,\r\nas well as the greater reviews, became the daily resorts of the\r\nladies, to hear the music of our excellent bands; schools were\r\nopened, and the churches every Sunday were well filled with most\r\ndevout and respectful congregations; stores were reopened, and\r\nmarkets for provisions, meat, wood, etc., were established, so that\r\neach family, regardless of race, color, or opinion, could procure\r\nall the necessaries and even luxuries of life, provided they had\r\nmoney.  Of course, many families were actually destitute of this,\r\nand to these were issued stores from our own stock of supplies.  I\r\nremember to have given to Dr. Arnold, the mayor, an order for the\r\ncontents of a large warehouse of rice, which he confided to a\r\ncommittee of gentlemen, who went North (to Boston), and soon\r\nreturned with one or more cargoes of flour, hams, sugar, coffee,\r\netc., for gratuitous distribution, which relieved the most pressing\r\nwants until the revival of trade and business enabled the people to\r\nprovide for themselves.\r\n\r\nA lady, whom I had known in former years as Miss Josephine Goodwin,\r\ntold me that, with a barrel of flour and some sugar which she had\r\nreceived gratuitously from the commissary, she had baked cakes and\r\npies, in the sale of which she realized a profit of fifty-six\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nMeantime Colonel Poe had reconnoitred and laid off new lines of\r\nparapet, which would enable a comparatively small garrison to hold\r\nthe place, and a heavy detail of soldiers was put to work thereon;\r\nGenerals Easton and Beckwith had organized a complete depot of\r\nsupplies; and, though vessels arrived almost daily with mails and\r\nprovisions, we were hardly ready to initiate a new and hazardous\r\ncampaign.  I had not yet received from General Grant or General\r\nHalleck any modification of the orders of December 6, 1864, to\r\nembark my command for Virginia by sea; but on the 2d of January,\r\n1865, General J. G. Barnard, United States Engineers, arrived\r\ndirect from General Grant's headquarters, bearing the following\r\nletter, in the general's own handwriting, which, with my answer, is\r\nhere given:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Before writing you definite instructions for the next\r\ncampaign, I wanted to receive your answer to my letter written from\r\nWashington.  Your confidence in being able to march up and join\r\nthis army pleases me, and I believe it can be done.  The effect of\r\nsuch a campaign will be to disorganize the South, and prevent the\r\norganization of new armies from their broken fragments.  Hood is\r\nnow retreating, with his army broken and demoralized.  His loss in\r\nmen has probably not been far from twenty thousand, besides\r\ndeserters.  If time is given, the fragments may be collected\r\ntogether and many of the deserters reassembled.  If we can, we\r\nshould act to prevent this.  Your spare army, as it were, moving as\r\nproposed, will do it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to holding Savannah, it looks to me that an intrenched\r\ncamp ought to be held on the railroad between Savannah and\r\nCharleston.  Your movement toward Branchville will probably enable\r\nFoster to reach this with his own force.  This will give us a\r\nposition in the South from which we can threaten the interior\r\nwithout marching over long, narrow causeways, easily defended, as\r\nwe have heretofore been compelled to do.  Could not such a camp be\r\nestablished about Pocotaligo or Coosawhatchie?\r\n\r\nI have thought that, Hood being so completely wiped out for present\r\nharm, I might bring A. J. Smith here, with fourteen to fifteen\r\nthousand men.  With this increase I could hold my lines, and move\r\nout with a greater force than Lee has.  It would compel Lee to\r\nretain all his present force in the defenses of Richmond or abandon\r\nthem entirely.  This latter contingency is probably the only danger\r\nto the easy success of your expedition.  In the event you should\r\nmeet Lee's army, you would be compelled to beat it or find the\r\nsea-coast.  Of course, I shall not let Lee's army escape if I can\r\nhelp it, and will not let it go without following to the best of my\r\nability.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting further directions, than, you may make your\r\npreparations to start on your northern expedition without delay.\r\nBreak up the railroads in South and North Carolina, and join the\r\narmies operating against Richmond as soon as you can.  I will leave\r\nout all suggestions about the route you should take, knowing that\r\nyour information, gained daily in the course of events, will be\r\nbetter than any that can be obtained now.\r\n\r\nIt may not be possible for you to march to the rear of Petersburg;\r\nbut, failing in this, you could strike either of the sea-coast\r\nports in North Carolina held by us.  From there you could take\r\nshipping.  It would be decidedly preferable, however, if you could\r\nmarch the whole distance.\r\n\r\nFrom the best information I have, you will find no difficulty in\r\nsupplying your army until you cross the Roanoke.  From there here\r\nis but a few days' march, and supplies could be collected south of\r\nthe river to bring you through.  I shall establish communication\r\nwith you there, by steamboat and gunboat.  By this means your wants\r\ncan be partially supplied.  I shall hope to hear from you soon, and\r\nto hear your plan, and about the time of starting.\r\n\r\nPlease instruct Foster to hold on to all the property in Savannah,\r\nand especially the cotton.  Do not turn it over to citizens or\r\nTreasury agents, without orders of the War Department.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, January 2, 1865.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, City Point.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have received, by the hands of General Barnard, your\r\nnote of 26th and letter of 27th December.\r\n\r\nI herewith inclose to you a copy of a projet which I have this\r\nmorning, in strict confidence, discussed with my immediate\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\nI shall need, however, larger supplies of stores, especially grain.\r\nI will inclose to you, with this, letters from General Easton,\r\nquartermaster, and Colonel Beckwith, commissary of subsistence,\r\nsetting forth what will be required, and trust you will forward\r\nthem to Washington with your sanction, so that the necessary steps\r\nmay be taken at once to enable me to carry out this plan on time.\r\n\r\nI wrote you very fully on the 24th, and have nothing to add.  Every\r\nthing here is quiet, and if I can get the necessary supplies in our\r\nwagons, shall be ready to start at the time indicated in my projet\r\n(January 15th).  But, until those supplies are in hand, I can do\r\nnothing; after they are, I shall be ready to move with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nI have heard of the affair at Cape Fear.  It has turned out as you\r\nwill remember I expected.\r\n\r\nI have furnished General Easton a copy of the dispatch from the\r\nSecretary of War.  He will retain possession of all cotton here,\r\nand ship it as fast as vessels can be had to New York.\r\n\r\nI shall immediately send the Seventeenth Corps over to Port Royal,\r\nby boats, to be furnished by Admiral Dahlgren and General Foster\r\n(without interfering with General Easton's vessels), to make a\r\nlodgment on the railroad at Pocotaligo.\r\n\r\nGeneral Barnard will remain with me a few days, and I send this by\r\na staff-officer, who can return on one of the vessels of the\r\nsupply-fleet.  I suppose that, now that General Butler has got\r\nthrough with them, you can spare them to us.\r\n\r\nMy report of recent operations is nearly ready, and will be sent\r\nyou in a day or two, as soon as some farther subordinate reports\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, very truly, your friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Entirely confidential]\r\n\r\nPROJET FOR JANUARY.\r\n\r\n1.  Right wing to move men and artillery by transports to head of\r\nBroad River and Beaufort; reestablish Port Royal Ferry, and mass\r\nthe wing at or in the neighborhood of Pocotaligo.\r\n\r\nLeft wing and cavalry to work slowly across the causeway toward\r\nHardeeville, to open a road by which wagons can reach their corps\r\nabout Broad River; also, by a rapid movement of the left, to secure\r\nSister's Ferry, and Augusta road out to Robertsville.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, all guns, shot, shell, cotton, etc., to be moved\r\nto a safe place, easy to guard, and provisions and wagons got ready\r\nfor another swath, aiming to have our army in hand about the head\r\nof Broad River, say Pocotaligo, Robertsville, and Coosawhatchie, by\r\nthe 15th January.\r\n\r\n2.  The whole army to move with loaded wagons by the roads leading\r\nin the direction of Columbia, which afford the best chance of\r\nforage and provisions.  Howard to be at Pocotaligo by the 15th\r\nJanuary, and Slocum to be at Robertsville, and Kilpatrick at or\r\nnear Coosawhatchie about the same date.  General Fosters troops to\r\noccupy Savannah, and gunboats to protect the rivers as soon as\r\nHoward gets Pocotaligo.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, on the 2d of January, I was authorized to march with my\r\nentire army north by land, and concluded at once to secure a\r\nfoothold or starting-point on the South Carolina side, selecting\r\nPocotaligo and Hardeeville as the points of rendezvous for the two\r\nwings; but I still remained in doubt as to the wishes of the\r\nAdministration, whether I should take Charleston en route, or\r\nconfine my whole attention to the incidental advantages of breaking\r\nup the railways of South and North Carolina, and the greater object\r\nof uniting my army with that of General Grant before Richmond.\r\n\r\nGeneral Barnard remained with me several days, and was regarded\r\nthen, as now, one of the first engineers of the age, perfectly\r\ncompetent to advise me on the strategy and objects of the new\r\ncampaign.  He expressed himself delighted with the high spirit of\r\nthe army, the steps already taken, by which we had captured\r\nSavannah, and he personally inspected some of the forts, such as\r\nThunderbolt and Causten's Bluff, by which the enemy had so long\r\nheld at bay the whole of our navy, and had defeated the previous\r\nattempts made in April, 1862, by the army of General Gillmore,\r\nwhich had bombarded and captured Fort Pulaski, but had failed to\r\nreach the city of Savannah.  I think General Barnard expected me to\r\ninvite him to accompany us northward in his official capacity; but\r\nColonel Poe, of my staff, had done so well, and was so perfectly\r\ncompetent, that I thought it unjust to supersede him by a senior in\r\nhis own corps.  I therefore said nothing of this to General\r\nBarnard, and soon after he returned to his post with General Grant,\r\nat City Point, bearing letters and full personal messages of our\r\nsituation and wants.\r\n\r\nWe were very much in want of light-draught steamers for navigating\r\nthe shallow waters of the coast, so that it took the Seventeenth\r\nCorps more than a week to transfer from Thunderbolt to Beaufort,\r\nSouth Carolina.  Admiral Dahlgren had supplied the Harvest Moon and\r\nthe Pontiac, and General Foster gave us a couple of hired steamers;\r\nI was really amused at the effect this short sea-voyage had on our\r\nmen, most of whom had never before looked upon the ocean.  Of\r\ncourse, they were fit subjects for sea-sickness, and afterward they\r\nbegged me never again to send them to sea, saying they would rather\r\nmarch a thousand miles on the worst roads of the South than to\r\nspend a single night on the ocean.  By the 10th General Howard had\r\ncollected the bulk of the Seventeenth Corps (General Blair) on\r\nBeaufort Island, and began his march for Pocotaligo, twenty-five\r\nmiles inland.  They crossed the channel between the island and\r\nmain-land during Saturday, the 14th of January, by a pontoon-\r\nbridge, and marched out to Garden's Corners, where there was some\r\nlight skirmishing; the next day, Sunday, they continued on to\r\nPocotaligo, finding the strong fort there abandoned, and\r\naccordingly made a lodgment on the railroad, having lost only two\r\nofficers and eight men.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time General Slocum crossed two divisions of the\r\nTwentieth Corps over the Savannah River, above the city, occupied\r\nHardeeville by one division and Purysburg by another.  Thus, by the\r\nmiddle of January, we had effected a lodgment in South Carolina,\r\nand were ready to resume the march northward; but we had not yet\r\naccumulated enough provisions and forage to fill the wagons, and\r\nother causes of delay occurred, of which I will make mention in due\r\norder.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of December, 1864, Captain Breese, United States\r\nNavy, flag-officer to Admiral Porter, reached Savannah, bringing\r\nthe first news of General Butler's failure at Fort Fisher, and that\r\nthe general had returned to James River with his land-forces,\r\nleaving Admiral Porter's fleet anchored off Cape Fear, in that\r\ntempestuous season.  Captain Breese brought me a letter from the\r\nadmiral, dated December 29th, asking me to send him from Savannah\r\none of my old divisions, with which he said he would make short\r\nwork of Fort Fisher; that he had already bombarded and silenced its\r\nguns, and that General Butler had failed because he was afraid to\r\nattack, or even give the order to attack, after (as Porter\r\ninsisted) the guns of Fort Fisher had been actually silenced by the\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nI answered him promptly on the 31st of December, that I proposed to\r\nmarch north inland, and that I would prefer to leave the rebel\r\ngarrisons on the coast, instead of dislodging and piling them up in\r\nmy front as we progressed.  From the chances, as I then understood\r\nthem, I supposed that Fort Fisher was garrisoned by a comparatively\r\nsmall force, while the whole division of General Hoke remained\r\nabout the city of Wilmington; and that, if Fort Fisher were\r\ncaptured, it would leave General Hoke free to join the larger force\r\nthat would naturally be collected to oppose my progress northward.\r\nI accordingly answered  Admiral Porter to this effect, declining to\r\nloan him the use of one of my divisions.  It subsequently\r\ntranspired, however, that, as soon as General Butler reached City\r\nPoint, General Grant was unwilling to rest under a sense of\r\nfailure, and accordingly dispatched back the same troops,\r\nreenforced and commanded by General A. H. Terry, who, on the 15th\r\nday of January, successfully assaulted and captured Fort Fisher,\r\nwith its entire garrison.  After the war was over, about the 20th\r\nof May, when I was giving my testimony before the Congressional\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War, the chairman of the committee,\r\nSenator B. F. Wade, of Ohio, told me that General Butler had been\r\nsummoned before that committee during the previous January, and had\r\njust finished his demonstration to their entire satisfaction that\r\nFort Fisher could not be carried by assault, when they heard the\r\nnewsboy in the hall crying out an \"extra\" Calling him in, they\r\ninquired the news, and he answered, \"Fort Fisher done took!\"  Of\r\ncourse, they all laughed, and none more heartily than General\r\nButler himself.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January there arrived at Savannah a revenue-cutter,\r\nhaving on board Simeon Draper, Esq., of New York City, the Hon. E.\r\nM. Stanton, Secretary of War, Quartermaster-General Meigs,\r\nAdjutant-General Townsend, and a retinue of civilians, who had come\r\ndown from the North to regulate the civil affairs of Savannah....\r\n\r\nI was instructed by Mr. Stanton to transfer to Mr. Draper the\r\ncustom house, post-office, and such other public buildings as these\r\ncivilians needed in the execution of their office, and to cause to\r\nbe delivered into their custody the captured cotton.  This was\r\naccomplished by--\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No. 10.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, January 12, 1865.\r\n\r\n1.  Brevet Brigadier-General Euston, chief-quartermaster, will turn\r\nover to Simeon Draper, Esq., agent of the United States Treasury\r\nDepartment, all cotton now in the city of Savannah, prize of war,\r\ntaking his receipt for the same in gross, and returning for it to\r\nthe quartermaster-general.  He will also afford Mr. Draper all the\r\nfacilities in his power in the way of transportation, labor, etc.,\r\nto enable him to handle the cotton with expedition.\r\n\r\n2.  General Euston will also turn over to Mr. Draper the\r\ncustom-house, and such other buildings in the city of Savannah as\r\nhe may need in the execution of his office.\r\n\r\nBy order of General W. T. Sherman,\r\n\r\nL. M. DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this time all the cotton had been carefully guarded, with\r\norders to General Euston to ship it by the return-vessels to New\r\nYork, for the adjudication of the nearest prize-court, accompanied\r\nwith invoices and all evidence of title to ownership.  Marks,\r\nnumbers, and other figures, were carefully preserved on the bales,\r\nso that the court might know the history of each bale.  But Mr.\r\nStanton, who surely was an able lawyer, changed all this, and\r\nordered the obliteration of all the marks; so that no man, friend\r\nor foe, could trace his identical cotton.  I thought it strange at\r\nthe time, and think it more so now; for I am assured that claims,\r\nreal and fictitious, have been proved up against this identical\r\ncotton of three times the quantity actually captured, and that\r\nreclamations on the Treasury have been allowed for more than the\r\nactual quantity captured, viz., thirty-one thousand bales.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton staid in Savannah several days, and seemed very curious\r\nabout matters and things in general.  I walked with him through the\r\ncity, especially the bivouacs of the several regiments that\r\noccupied the vacant squares, and he seemed particularly pleased at\r\nthe ingenuity of the men in constructing their temporary huts.\r\nFour of the \"dog-tents,\" or tentes d'abri, buttoned together,\r\nserved for a roof, and the sides were made of clapboards, or rough\r\nboards brought from demolished houses or fences.  I remember his\r\nmarked admiration for the hut of a soldier who had made his door\r\nout of a handsome parlor mirror, the glass gone and its gilt frame\r\nserving for his door.\r\n\r\nHe talked to me a great deal about the negroes, the former slaves,\r\nand I told him of many interesting incidents, illustrating their\r\nsimple character and faith in our arms and progress.  He inquired\r\nparticularly about General Jeff. C. Davis, who, he said, was a\r\nDemocrat, and hostile to the negro.  I assured him that General\r\nDavis was an excellent soldier, and I did not believe he had any\r\nhostility to the negro; that in our army we had no negro soldiers,\r\nand, as a rule, we preferred white soldiers, but that we employed a\r\nlarge force of them as servants, teamsters, and pioneers, who had\r\nrendered admirable service.  He then showed me a newspaper account\r\nof General Davis taking up his pontoon-bridge across Ebenezer\r\nCreek, leaving sleeping negro men, women, and children, on the\r\nother side, to be slaughtered by Wheeler's cavalry.  I had heard\r\nsuch a rumor, and advised Mr. Stanton, before becoming prejudiced,\r\nto allow me to send for General Davis, which he did, and General\r\nDavis explained the matter to his entire satisfaction.  The truth\r\nwas, that, as we approached the seaboard, the freedmen in droves,\r\nold and young, followed the several columns to reach a place of\r\nsafety.  It so happened that General Davis's route into Savannah\r\nfollowed what was known as the \"River-road,\" and he had to make\r\nconstant use of his pontoon-train--the head of his column reaching\r\nsome deep, impassable creek before the rear was fairly over\r\nanother.  He had occasionally to use the pontoons both day and\r\nnight.  On the occasion referred to, the bridge was taken up from\r\nEbenezer Creek while some of the camp-followers remained asleep on\r\nthe farther side, and these were picked up by Wheeler's cavalry.\r\nSome of them, in their fright, were drowned in trying to swim over,\r\nand others may have been cruelly killed by Wheeler's men, but this\r\nwas a mere supposition.  At all events, the same thing might have\r\nresulted to General Howard, or to any other of the many most humane\r\ncommanders who filled the army.  General Jeff. C. Davis was\r\nstrictly a soldier, and doubtless hated to have his wagons and\r\ncolumns encumbered by these poor negroes, for whom we all felt\r\nsympathy, but a sympathy of a different sort from that of Mr.\r\nStanton, which was not of pure humanity, but of politics.  The\r\nnegro question was beginning to loom up among the political\r\neventualities of the day, and many foresaw that not only would the\r\nslaves secure their freedom, but that they would also have votes.\r\nI did not dream of such a result then, but knew that slavery, as\r\nsuch, was dead forever, and did not suppose that the former slaves\r\nwould be suddenly, without preparation, manufactured into voters,\r\nequal to all others, politically and socially.  Mr. Stanton seemed\r\ndesirous of coming into contact with the negroes to confer with\r\nthem, and he asked me to arrange an interview for him.  I\r\naccordingly sent out and invited the most intelligent of the\r\nnegroes, mostly Baptist and Methodist preachers, to come to my\r\nrooms to meet the Secretary of War.  Twenty responded, and were\r\nreceived in my room up-stairs in Mr. Green's house, where Mr.\r\nStanton and Adjutant-General Townsend took down the conversation in\r\nthe form of questions and answers.  Each of the twenty gave his\r\nname and partial history, and then selected Garrison Frazier as\r\ntheir spokesman:\r\n\r\nFirst Question.  State what your understanding is in regard to the\r\nacts of Congress and President Lincoln's proclamation touching the\r\ncolored people in the rebel States?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  So far as I understand President Lincoln's proclamation to\r\nthe rebel States, it is, that if they will lay down their arms and\r\nsubmit to the laws of the United States, before the 1st of January,\r\n1863, all should be well; but if they did not, then all the slaves\r\nin the Southern States should be free, henceforth and forever.\r\nThat is what I understood.\r\n\r\nSecond Question.  State what you understand by slavery, and the\r\nfreedom that was to be given by the President's proclamation?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  Slavery is receiving by irresistible power the work of\r\nanother man, and not by his consent.  The freedom, as I understand\r\nit, promised by the proclamation, is taking us from under the yoke\r\nof bondage and placing us where we can reap the fruit of our own\r\nlabor, and take care of ourselves and assist the Government in\r\nmaintaining our freedom.\r\n\r\nFourth Question.  State in what manner you would rather live\r\n--whether scattered among the whites, or in colonies by yourselves?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  I would prefer to live by ourselves, for there is a\r\nprejudice against us in the South that will take years to get over;\r\nbut I do not know that I can answer for my brethren.\r\n\r\n(All but Mr. Lynch, a missionary from the North, agreed with\r\nFrazier, but he thought they ought to live together, along with the\r\nwhites.)\r\n\r\nEighth Question.  If the rebel leaders were to arm the slaves, what\r\nwould be its effect?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  I think they would fight as long as they were before the\r\n\"bayonet,\" and just as soon as they could get away they would\r\ndesert, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTenth Question.  Do you understand the mode of enlistment of\r\ncolored persons in the rebel States by State agents, under the act\r\nof Congress; if yea, what is your understanding?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  My understanding is, that colored persons enlisted by\r\nState agents are enlisted as substitutes, and give credit to the\r\nState and do not swell the army, because every black man enlisted\r\nby a State agent leaves a white man at home; and also that larger\r\nbounties are given, or promised, by the State agents than are given\r\nby the United States.  The great object should be to push through\r\nthis rebellion the shortest way; and there seems to be something\r\nwanting in the enlistment by State agents, for it don't strengthen\r\nthe army, but takes one away for every colored man enlisted.\r\n\r\nEleventh Question.  State what, in your opinion, is the best way to\r\nenlist colored men as soldiers?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  I think, sir, that all compulsory operations should be put\r\na stop to.  The ministers would talk to them, and the young men\r\nwould enlist.  It is my opinion that it world be far better for the\r\nState agents to stay at home and the enlistments be made for the\r\nUnited States under the direction of General Sherman.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I was present, and, on Mr. Stanton's intimating\r\nthat he wanted to ask some questions affecting me, I withdrew, and\r\nthen he put the twelfth and last question.\r\n\r\nTwelfth Question.  State what is the feeling of the colored people\r\ntoward General Sherman, and how far do they regard his sentiments\r\nand actions as friendly to their rights and interests, or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nAnswer.  We looked upon General Sherman, prior to his arrival, as a\r\nman, in the providence of God, specially set apart to accomplish\r\nthis work, and we unanimously felt inexpressible gratitude to him,\r\nlooking upon him as a man who should be honored for the faithful\r\nperformance of his duty.  Some of us called upon him immediately\r\nupon his arrival, and it is probable he did not meet the secretary\r\nwith more courtesy than he did us.  His conduct and deportment\r\ntoward us characterized him as a friend and gentleman.  We have\r\nconfidence in General Sherman, and think what concerns us could not\r\nbe in better hands.  This is our opinion now, from the short\r\nacquaintance and intercourse we have had.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a strange fact that the great War Secretary should\r\nhave catechized negroes concerning the character of a general who\r\nhad commanded a hundred thousand men in battle, had captured cities\r\nconducted sixty-five thousand men successfully across four hundred\r\nmiles of hostile territory, and had just brought tens of thousands\r\nof freedmen to a place of security; but because I had not loaded\r\ndown my army by other hundreds of thousands of poor negroes, I was\r\nconstrued by others as hostile to the black race.  I had received\r\nfrom General Halleck, at Washington, a letter warning me that there\r\nwere certain influential parties near the President who were\r\ntorturing him with suspicions of my fidelity to him and his negro\r\npolicy; but I shall always believe that Mr. Lincoln, though a\r\ncivilian, knew better, and appreciated my motives and character.\r\nThough this letter of General Halleck has always been treated by me\r\nas confidential, I now insert it here at length:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., December 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, Savannah.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL: I take the liberty of calling your attention, in\r\nthis private and friendly way, to a matter which may possibly\r\nhereafter be of more importance to you than either of us may now\r\nanticipate.\r\n\r\nWhile almost every one is praising your great march through\r\nGeorgia, and the capture of Savannah, there is a certain class\r\nhaving now great influence with the President, and very probably\r\nanticipating still more on a change of cabinet, who are decidedly\r\ndisposed to make a point against you.  I mean in regard to\r\n\"inevitable Sambo.\"  They say that you have manifested an almost\r\ncriminal dislike to the negro, and that you are not willing to\r\ncarry out the wishes of the Government in regard to him, but\r\nrepulse him with contempt! They say you might have brought with you\r\nto Savannah more than fifty thousand, thus stripping Georgia of\r\nthat number of laborers, and opening a road by which as many more\r\ncould have escaped from their masters; but that, instead of this,\r\nyou drove them from your ranks, prevented their following you by\r\ncutting the bridges in your rear, and thus caused the massacre of\r\nlarge numbers by Wheeler's cavalry.\r\n\r\nTo those who know you as I do, such accusation will pass as the\r\nidle winds, for we presume that you discouraged the negroes from\r\nfollowing you because you had not the means of supporting them, and\r\nfeared they might seriously embarrass your march.  But there are\r\nothers, and among them some in high authority, who think or pretend\r\nto think otherwise, and they are decidedly disposed to make a point\r\nagainst you.\r\n\r\nI do not write this to induce you to conciliate this class of men\r\nby doing any thing which you do not deem right and proper, and for\r\nthe interest of the Government and the country; but simply to call\r\nyour attention to certain things which are viewed here somewhat\r\ndifferently than from your stand-point.  I will explain as briefly\r\nas possible:\r\n\r\nSome here think that, in view of the scarcity of labor in the\r\nSouth, and the probability that a part, at least, of the\r\nable-bodied slaves will be called into the military service of the\r\nrebels, it is of the greatest importance to open outlets by which\r\nthese slaves can escape into our lines, and they say that the route\r\nyou have passed over should be made the route of escape, and\r\nSavannah the great place of refuge.  These, I know, are the views\r\nof some of the leading men in the Administration, and they now\r\nexpress dissatisfaction that you did not carry them out in your\r\ngreat raid.\r\n\r\nNow that you are in possession of Savannah, and there can be no\r\nfurther fears about supplies, would it not be possible for you to\r\nreopen these avenues of escape for the negroes, without interfering\r\nwith your military operations? Could not such escaped slaves find\r\nat least a partial supply of food in the rice-fields about\r\nSavannah, and cotton plantations on the coast?\r\n\r\nI merely throw out these suggestions.  I know that such a course\r\nwould be approved by the Government, and I believe that a\r\nmanifestation on your part of a desire to bring the slaves within\r\nour lines will do much to silence your opponents.  You will\r\nappreciate my motives in writing this private letter.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Mr. Stanton, when he reached Savannah,\r\nshared these thoughts, but luckily the negroes themselves convinced\r\nhim that he was in error, and that they understood their own\r\ninterests far better than did the men in Washington, who tried to\r\nmake political capital out of this negro question.  The idea that\r\nsuch men should have been permitted to hang around Mr. Lincoln, to\r\ntorture his life by suspicions of the officers who were toiling\r\nwith the single purpose to bring the war to a successful end, and\r\nthereby to liberate all slaves, is a fair illustration of the\r\ninfluences that poison a political capital.\r\n\r\nMy aim then was, to whip the rebels, to humble their pride, to\r\nfollow them to their inmost recesses, and make them fear and dread\r\nus.  \"Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"  I did not want\r\nthem to cast in our teeth what General Hood had once done in\r\nAtlanta, that we had to call on their slaves to help us to subdue\r\nthem.  But, as regards kindness to the race, encouraging them to\r\npatience and forbearance, procuring them food and clothing, and\r\nproviding them with land whereon to labor, I assert that no army\r\never did more for that race than the one I commanded in Savannah.\r\nWhen we reached Savannah, we were beset by ravenous State agents\r\nfrom Hilton Head, who enticed and carried away our servants, and\r\nthe corps of pioneers which we had organized, and which had done\r\nsuch excellent service.  On one occasion, my own aide-de-camp,\r\nColonel Audenried, found at least a hundred poor negroes shut up in\r\na house and pen, waiting for the night, to be conveyed stealthily\r\nto Hilton Head.  They appealed to him for protection, alleging that\r\nthey had been told that they must be soldiers, that \"Massa Lincoln\"\r\nwanted them, etc.  I never denied the slaves a full opportunity for\r\nvoluntary enlistment, but I did prohibit force to be used, for I\r\nknew that the State agents were more influenced by the profit they\r\nderived from the large bounties then being paid than by any love of\r\ncountry or of the colored race.  In the language of Mr. Frazier,\r\nthe enlistment of every black man \"did not strengthen the army, but\r\ntook away one white man from the ranks.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Mr. Stanton's stay in Savannah we discussed this negro\r\nquestion very fully; he asked me to draft an order on the subject,\r\nin accordance with my own views, that would meet the pressing\r\nnecessities of the case, and I did so.  We went over this order,\r\nNo. 15, of January 16, 1865, very carefully.  The secretary made\r\nsome verbal modifications, when it was approved by him in all its\r\ndetails, I published it, and it went into operation at once.  It\r\nprovided fully for the enlistment of colored troops, and gave the\r\nfreedmen certain possessory rights to land, which afterward became\r\nmatters of judicial inquiry and decision.  Of course, the military\r\nauthorities at that day, when war prevailed, had a perfect right to\r\ngrant the possession of any vacant land to which they could extend\r\nmilitary protection, but we did not undertake to give a fee-simple\r\ntitle; and all that was designed by these special field orders was\r\nto make temporary provisions for the freedmen and their families\r\nduring the rest of the war, or until Congress should take action in\r\nthe premises.  All that I now propose to assert is, that Mr.\r\nStanton, Secretary of War, saw these orders in the rough, and\r\napproved every paragraph thereof, before they were made public:\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No. 15.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, January 16, 1865.\r\n\r\n1.  The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice-fields\r\nalong the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the\r\ncountry bordering the St. John's River, Florida, are reserved and\r\nset apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the\r\nacts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n2.  At Beaufort, Hilton Head, Savannah, Fernandina, St. Augustine,\r\nand Jacksonville, the blacks may remain in their chosen or\r\naccustomed vocations; but on the islands, and in the settlements\r\nhereafter to be established, no white person whatever, unless\r\nmilitary officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted\r\nto reside; and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be\r\nleft to the freed people themselves, subject only to the United\r\nStates military authority, and the acts of Congress.  By the laws\r\nof war, and orders of the President of the United States, the negro\r\nis free, and must be dealt with as such.  He cannot be subjected to\r\nconscription, or forced military service, save by the written\r\norders of the highest military authority of the department, under\r\nsuch regulations as the President or Congress may prescribe.\r\nDomestic servants, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other mechanics,\r\nwill be free to select their own work and residence, but the young\r\nand able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist as soldiery in\r\nthe service of the United States, to contribute their share toward\r\nmaintaining their own freedom, and securing their rights as\r\ncitizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nNegroes so enlisted will be organized into companies, battalions,\r\nand regiments, under the orders of the United States military\r\nauthorities, and will be paid, fed, and clothed; according to law.\r\nThe bounties paid on enlistment may, with the consent of the\r\nrecruit, go to assist his family and settlement in procuring\r\nagricultural implements, seed, tools, boots, clothing, and other\r\narticles necessary for their livelihood.\r\n\r\n3.  Whenever three respectable negroes, heads of families, shall\r\ndesire to settle on land, and shall have selected for that purpose\r\nan island or a locality clearly defined within the limits above\r\ndesignated, the Inspector of Settlements and Plantations will\r\nhimself, or, by such subordinate officer as he may appoint, give\r\nthem a license to settle such island or district, and afford them\r\nsuch assistance as he can to enable them to establish a peaceable\r\nagricultural settlement.  The three parties named will subdivide\r\nthe land, under the supervision of the inspector, among themselves,\r\nand such others as may choose to settle near them, so that each\r\nfamily shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable\r\nground, and, when it borders on some water-channel, with not more\r\nthan eight hundred feet water-front, in the possession of which\r\nland the military authorities will afford them protection until\r\nsuch time as they can protect themselves, or until Congress shall\r\nregulate their title.  The quartermaster may, on the requisition of\r\nthe Inspector of Settlements and Plantations, place at the disposal\r\nof the inspector one or more of the captured steamers to ply\r\nbetween the settlements and one or more of the commercial points\r\nheretofore named, in order to afford the settlers the opportunity\r\nto supply their necessary wants, and to sell the products of their\r\nland and labor.\r\n\r\n4.  Whenever a negro has enlisted in the military service of the\r\nUnited States, he may locate his family in any one of the\r\nsettlements at pleasure, and acquire a homestead, and all other\r\nrights and privileges of a settler, as though present in person.\r\nIn like manner, negroes may settle their families and engage on\r\nboard the gunboats, or in fishing, or in the navigation of the\r\ninland waters, without losing any claim to land or other advantages\r\nderived from this system.  But no one, unless an actual settler as\r\nabove defined, or unless absent on Government service, will be\r\nentitled to claim any right to land or property in any settlement\r\nby virtue of these orders.\r\n\r\n5.  In order to carry out this system of settlement, a general\r\nofficer will be detailed as Inspector of Settlements and\r\nPlantations, whose duty it shall be to visit the settlements, to\r\nregulate their police and general arrangement, and who will furnish\r\npersonally to each head of a family, subject to the approval of the\r\nPresident of the United States, a possessory title in writing,\r\ngiving as near as possible the description of boundaries; and who\r\nshall adjust all claims or conflicts that may arise under the same,\r\nsubject to the like approval, treating such titles altogether as\r\npossessory.  The same general officer will also be charged with the\r\nenlistment and organization of the negro recruits, and protecting\r\ntheir interests while absent from their settlements; and will be\r\ngoverned by the rules and regulations prescribed by the War\r\nDepartment for such purposes.\r\n\r\n6.  Brigadier-General R.  Saxton is hereby appointed Inspector of\r\nSettlements and Plantations, and will at once enter on the\r\nperformance of his duties.  No change is intended or desired in the\r\nsettlement now on Beaufort Island, nor will any rights to property\r\nheretofore acquired be affected thereby.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\nL.  M.  DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw a good deal of the secretary socially, during the time of his\r\nvisit to Savannah.  He kept his quarters on the revenue-cutter with\r\nSimeon Draper, Esq., which cutter lay at a wharf in the river, but\r\nhe came very often to my quarters at Mr. Green's house.  Though\r\nappearing robust and strong, he complained a good deal of internal\r\npains, which he said threatened his life, and would compel him soon\r\nto quit public office.  He professed to have come from Washington\r\npurposely for rest and recreation, and he spoke unreservedly of the\r\nbickerings and jealousies at the national capital; of the\r\ninterminable quarrels of the State Governors about their quotas,\r\nand more particularly of the financial troubles that threatened the\r\nvery existence of the Government itself.  He said that the price of\r\nevery thing had so risen in comparison with the depreciated money,\r\nthat there was danger of national bankruptcy, and he appealed to\r\nme, as a soldier and patriot, to hurry up matters so as to bring\r\nthe war to a close.\r\n\r\nHe left for Port Royal about the 15th of January, and promised to\r\ngo North without delay, so as to hurry back to me the supplies I\r\nhad called for, as indispensable for the prosecution of the next\r\nstage of the campaign.  I was quite impatient to get off myself,\r\nfor a city-life had become dull and tame, and we were all anxious\r\nto get into the pine-woods again, free from the importunities of\r\nrebel women asking for protection, and of the civilians from the\r\nNorth who were coming to Savannah for cotton and all sorts of\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January General Slocum was ordered to turn over the\r\ncity of Savannah to General J. G. Foster, commanding the Department\r\nof the South, who proposed to retain his own headquarters at Hilton\r\nHead, and to occupy Savannah by General Grovers division of the\r\nNineteenth Corps, just arrived from James River; and on the next\r\nday, viz., January 19th, I made the first general orders for the\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nThese were substantially to group the right wing of the army at\r\nPocotaligo, already held by the Seventeenth Corps, and the left\r\nwing and cavalry at or near Robertsville, in South Carolina.  The\r\narmy remained substantially the same as during the march from\r\nAtlanta, with the exception of a few changes in the commanders of\r\nbrigades and divisions, the addition of some men who had joined\r\nfrom furlough, and the loss of others from the expiration of their\r\nterm of service.  My own personal staff remained the same, with the\r\nexception that General W. F. Barry had rejoined us at Savannah,\r\nperfectly recovered from his attack of erysipelas, and continued\r\nwith us to the end of the war.  Generals Easton and Beckwith\r\nremained at Savannah, in charge of their respective depots, with\r\norders to follow and meet us by sea with supplies when we should\r\nreach the coast at Wilmington or Newbern, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nOf course, I gave out with some ostentation, especially among the\r\nrebels, that we were going to Charleston or Augusta; but I had long\r\nbefore made up my mind to waste no time on either, further than to\r\nplay off on their fears, thus to retain for their protection a\r\nforce of the enemy which would otherwise concentrate in our front,\r\nand make the passage of some of the great rivers that crossed our\r\nroute more difficult and bloody.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished all that seemed necessary, on the 21st of\r\nJanuary, with my entire headquarters, officers, clerks, orderlies,\r\netc., with wagons and horses, I embarked in a steamer for Beaufort,\r\nSouth Carolina, touching at Hilton Head, to see General Foster.\r\nThe weather was rainy and bad, but we reached Beaufort safely on\r\nthe 23d, and found some of General Blair's troops there.  The pink\r\nof his corps (Seventeenth) was, however, up on the railroad about\r\nPocotaligo, near the head of Broad River, to which their supplies\r\nwere carried from Hilton Head by steamboats.  General Hatch's\r\ndivision (of General Foster's command) was still at Coosawhatchie\r\nor Tullafinny, where the Charleston & Savannah Railroad crosses the\r\nriver of that name.  All the country between Beaufort and\r\nPocotaligo was low alluvial land, cut up by an infinite number of\r\nsalt-water sloughs and freshwater creeks, easily susceptible of\r\ndefense by a small force; and why the enemy had allowed us to make\r\na lodgment at Pocotaligo so easily I did not understand, unless it\r\nresulted from fear or ignorance.  It seemed to me then that the\r\nterrible energy they had displayed in the earlier stages of the war\r\nwas beginning to yield to the slower but more certain industry and\r\ndiscipline of our Northern men.  It was to me manifest that the\r\nsoldiers and people of the South entertained an undue fear of our\r\nWestern men, and, like children, they had invented such ghostlike\r\nstories of our prowess in Georgia, that they were scared by their\r\nown inventions.  Still, this was a power, and I intended to utilize\r\nit.  Somehow, our men had got the idea that South Carolina was the\r\ncause of all our troubles; her people were the first to fire on\r\nFort Sumter, had been in a great hurry to precipitate the country\r\ninto civil war; and therefore on them should fall the scourge of\r\nwar in its worst form.  Taunting messages had also come to us, when\r\nin Georgia, to the effect that, when we should reach South\r\nCarolina, we would find a people less passive, who would fight us\r\nto the bitter end, daring us to come over, etc.; so that I saw and\r\nfelt that we would not be able longer to restrain our men as we had\r\ndone in Georgia.\r\n\r\nPersonally I had many friends in Charleston, to whom I would gladly\r\nhave extended protection and mercy, but they were beyond my\r\npersonal reach, and I would not restrain the army lest its vigor\r\nand energy should be impaired; and I had every reason to expect\r\nbold and strong resistance at the many broad and deep rivers that\r\nlay across our path.\r\n\r\nGeneral Foster's Department of the South had been enlarged to\r\nembrace the coast of North Carolina, so that the few troops serving\r\nthere, under the command of General Innis N. Palmer, at Newbern,\r\nbecame subject to my command.  General A. H. Terry held Fort\r\nFisher, and a rumor came that he had taken the city of Wilmington;\r\nbut this was premature.  He had about eight thousand men.  General\r\nSchofield was also known to be en route from Nashville for North\r\nCarolina, with the entire Twenty-third Corps, so that I had every\r\nreason to be satisfied that I would receive additional strength as\r\nwe progressed northward, and before I should need it.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. J. Hardee commanded the Confederate forces in\r\nCharleston, with the Salkiehatchie River as his line of defense.\r\nIt was also known that General Beauregard had come from the\r\ndirection of Tennessee, and had assumed the general command of all\r\nthe troops designed to resist our progress.\r\n\r\nThe heavy winter rains had begun early in January, rendered the\r\nroads execrable, and the Savannah River became so swollen that it\r\nfilled its many channels, overflowing the vast extent of\r\nrice-fields that lay on the east bank.  This flood delayed our\r\ndeparture two weeks; for it swept away our pontoon-bridge at\r\nSavannah, and came near drowning John E. Smith's division of the\r\nFifteenth Corps, with several heavy trains of wagons that were en\r\nroute from Savannah to Pocotaligo by the old causeway.\r\n\r\nGeneral Slocum had already ferried two of his divisions across the\r\nriver, when Sister's Ferry, about forty miles above Savannah, was\r\nselected for the passage of the rest of his wing and of\r\nKilpatrick's cavalry.  The troops were in motion for that point\r\nbefore I quitted Savannah, and Captain S. B. Luce, United States\r\nNavy, had reported to me with a gunboat (the Pontiac) and a couple\r\nof transports, which I requested him to use in protecting Sister's\r\nFerry during the passage of Slocum's wing, and to facilitate the\r\npassage of the troops all he could.  The utmost activity prevailed\r\nat all points, but it was manifest we could not get off much before\r\nthe 1st day of February; so I determined to go in person to\r\nPocotaligo, and there act as though we were bound for Charleston.\r\nOn the 24th of January I started from Beaufort with a part of my\r\nstaff, leaving the rest to follow at leisure, rode across the\r\nisland to a pontoon-bridge that spanned the channel between it and\r\nthe main-land, and thence rode by Garden's Corners to a plantation\r\nnot far from Pocotaligo, occupied by General Blair.  There we found\r\na house, with a majestic avenue of live-oaks, whose limbs had been\r\ncut away by the troops for firewood, and desolation marked one of\r\nthose splendid South Carolina estates where the proprietors\r\nformerly had dispensed a hospitality that distinguished the old\r\nregime of that proud State.  I slept on the floor of the house, but\r\nthe night was so bitter cold that I got up by the fire several\r\ntimes, and when it burned low I rekindled it with an old\r\nmantel-clock and the wreck of a bedstead which stood in a corner of\r\nthe room--the only act of vandalism that I recall done by myself\r\npersonally during the war.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I rode to Pocotaligo, and thence reconnoitred our\r\nentire line down to Coosawhatchie.  Pocotaligo Fort was on low,\r\nalluvial ground, and near it began the sandy pine-land which\r\nconnected with the firm ground extending inland, constituting the\r\nchief reason for its capture at the very first stage of the\r\ncampaign.  Hatch's division was ordered to that point from\r\nCoosawhatchie, and the whole of Howard's right wing was brought\r\nnear by, ready to start by the 1st of February.  I also\r\nreconnoitred the point of the Salkiehatchie River, where the\r\nCharleston Railroad crossed it, found the bridge protected by a\r\nrebel battery on the farther side, and could see a few men about\r\nit; but the stream itself was absolutely impassable, for the whole\r\nbottom was overflowed by its swollen waters to the breadth of a\r\nfull mile.  Nevertheless, Force's and Mower's divisions of the\r\nSeventeenth Corps were kept active, seemingly with the intention to\r\ncross over in the direction of Charleston, and thus to keep up the\r\ndelusion that that city was our immediate \"objective.\"  Meantime, I\r\nhad reports from General Slocum of the terrible difficulties he had\r\nencountered about Sister's Ferry, where the Savannah River was\r\nreported nearly three miles wide, and it seemed for a time almost\r\nimpossible for him to span it at all with his frail pontoons.\r\nAbout this time (January 25th), the weather cleared away bright and\r\ncold, and I inferred that the river would soon run down, and enable\r\nSlocum to pass the river before February 1st.  One of the divisions\r\nof the Fifteenth Corps (Corse's) had also been cut off by the loss\r\nof the pontoon-bridge at Savannah, so that General Slocum had with\r\nhim, not only his own two corps, but Corse's division and\r\nKilpatrick's cavalry, without which it was not prudent for me to\r\ninaugurate the campaign.  We therefore rested quietly about\r\nPocotaligo, collecting stores and making final preparations, until\r\nthe 1st of February, when I learned that the cavalry and two\r\ndivisions of the Twentieth Corps were fairly across the river, and\r\nthen gave the necessary orders for the march northward.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter, I will add a few original letters that\r\nbear directly on the subject, and tend to illustrate it:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C.  January 21, 1866.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your letters brought by General Barnard were received at\r\nCity Point, and read with interest. Not having them with me,\r\nhowever, I cannot say that in this I will be able to satisfy you on\r\nall points of recommendation.  As I arrived here at 1 p.m., and\r\nmust leave at 6 p.m., having in the mean time spent over three\r\nhours with the secretary and General Halleck, I must be brief.\r\nBefore your last request to have Thomas make a campaign into the\r\nheart of Alabama, I had ordered Schofield to Annapolis, Maryland,\r\nwith his corps.  The advance (six thousand) will reach the seaboard\r\nby the 23d, the remainder following as rapidly as railroad\r\ntransportation can be procured from Cincinnati.  The corps numbers\r\nover twenty-one thousand men.\r\n\r\nThomas is still left with a sufficient force, surplus to go to\r\nSelma under an energetic leader.  He has been telegraphed to, to\r\nknow whether he could go, and, if so, by which of several routes he\r\nwould select.  No reply is yet received.  Canby has been ordered to\r\nset offensively from the seacoast to the interior, toward\r\nMontgomery and Selma.  Thomas's forces will move from the north at\r\nan early day, or some of his troops will be sent to Canby.  Without\r\nfurther reenforcement Canby will have a moving column of twenty\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nFort Fisher, you are aware, has been captured.  We have a force\r\nthere of eight thousand effective.  At Newbern about half the\r\nnumber.  It is rumored, through deserters, that Wilmington also has\r\nfallen.  I am inclined to believe the rumor, because on the 17th we\r\nknew the enemy were blowing up their works about Fort Caswell, and\r\nthat on the 18th Terry moved on Wilmington.\r\n\r\nIf Wilmington is captured, Schofield will go there.  If not, he\r\nwill be sent to Newbern.  In either event, all the surplus forces\r\nat the two points will move to the interior, toward Goldsboro', in\r\ncooperation with your movements.  From either point, railroad\r\ncommunications can be run out, there being here abundance of\r\nrolling-stock suited to the gauge of those roads.\r\n\r\nThere have been about sixteen thousand men sent from Lee's army\r\nsouth.  Of these, you will have fourteen thousand against you, if\r\nWilmington is not held by the enemy, casualties at Fort Fisher\r\nhaving overtaken about two thousand.\r\n\r\nAll other troops are subject to your orders as you come in\r\ncommunication with them.  They will be so instructed.  From about\r\nRichmond I will watch Lee closely, and if he detaches many men, or\r\nattempts to evacuate, will pitch in.  In the meantime, should you\r\nbe brought to a halt anywhere, I can send two corps of thirty\r\nthousand effective men to your support, from the troops about\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nTo resume: Canby is ordered to operate to the interior from the\r\nGulf.  A. J. Smith may go from the north, but I think it doubtful.\r\nA force of twenty-eight or thirty thousand will cooperate with you\r\nfrom Newbern or Wilmington, or both.  You can call for\r\nreenforcements.\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by Captain Hudson, of my staff, who will\r\nreturn with any message you may have for me.  If there is any thing\r\nI can do for you in the way of having supplies on shipboard, at any\r\npoint on the seacoast, ready for you, let me know it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, POCOTALIGO, SOUTH CAROLINA, January 29, 1885.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, City Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: Captain Hudson has this moment arrived with your\r\nletter of January 21st, which I have read with interest.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Fort Fisher has a most important bearing on my\r\ncampaign, and I rejoice in it for many reasons, because of its\r\nintrinsic importance, and because it gives me another point of\r\nsecurity on the seaboard.  I hope General Terry will follow it up\r\nby the capture of Wilmington, although I do not look for it, from\r\nAdmiral Porter's dispatch to me.  I rejoice that Terry was not a\r\nWest-Pointer, that he belonged to your army, and that he had the\r\nsame troops with which Butler feared to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren, whose fleet is reenforced by some more ironclads,\r\nwants to make an assault a la Fisher on Fort Moultrie, but I\r\nwithhold my consent, for the reason that the capture of all\r\nSullivan's Island is not conclusive as to Charleston; the capture\r\nof James Island would be, but all pronounce that impossible at this\r\ntime.  Therefore, I am moving (as hitherto designed) for the\r\nrailroad west of Branchville, then will swing across to Orangeburg,\r\nwhich will interpose my army between Charleston and the interior.\r\nContemporaneous with this, Foster will demonstrate up the Edisto,\r\nand afterward make a lodgment at Bull's Bay, and occupy the common\r\nroad which leads from Mount Pleasant toward Georgetown.  When I get\r\nto Columbia, I think I shall move straight for Goldsboro', via\r\nFayetteville.  By this circuit I cut all roads, and devastate the\r\nland; and the forces along the coast, commanded by Foster, will\r\nfollow my movement, taking any thing the enemy lets go, or so\r\noccupy his attention that he cannot detach all his forces against\r\nme.  I feel sure of getting Wilmington, and may be Charleston, and\r\nbeing at Goldsboro', with its railroads finished back to Morehead\r\nCity and Wilmington, I can easily take Raleigh, when it seems that\r\nLee must come out.  If Schofield comes to Beaufort, he should be\r\npushed out to Kinston, on the Neuse, and may be Goldsboro' (or,\r\nrather, a point on the Wilmington road, south of Goldsboro').  It\r\nis not necessary to storm Goldsboro', because it is in a distant\r\nregion, of no importance in itself, and, if its garrison is forced\r\nto draw supplies from its north, it, will be eating up the same\r\nstores on which Lee depends for his command.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt Hood will bring his army to Augusta.  Canby and\r\nThomas should penetrate Alabama as far as possible, to keep\r\nemployed at least a part of Hood's army; or, what would accomplish\r\nthe same thing, Thomas might reoccupy the railroad from Chattanooga\r\nforward to the Etowah, viz., Rome, Kingston, and Allatoona, thereby\r\nthreatening Georgia.  I know that the Georgia troops are\r\ndisaffected.  At Savannah I met delegates from several counties of\r\nthe southwest, who manifested a decidedly hostile spirit to the\r\nConfederate cause.  I nursed the feeling as far as possible, and\r\ninstructed Grower to keep it up.\r\n\r\nMy left wing must now be at Sister's Ferry, crossing the Savannah\r\nRiver to the east bank.  Slocum has orders to be at Robertsville\r\nto-morrow, prepared to move on Barnwell.  Howard is here, all ready\r\nto start for the Augusta Railroad at Midway.\r\n\r\nWe find the enemy on the east aide of the Salkiehatchie, and\r\ncavalry in our front; but all give ground on our approach, and seem\r\nto be merely watching us.  If we start on Tuesday, in one week we\r\nshall be near Orangeburg, having broken up the Augusta road from\r\nthe Edisto westward twenty or twenty-five miles.  I will be sure\r\nthat every rail is twisted.  Should we encounter too much\r\nopposition near Orangeburg, then I will for a time neglect that\r\nbranch, and rapidly move on Columbia, and fill up the triangle\r\nformed by the Congaree and Wateree (tributaries of the Santee),\r\nbreaking up that great centre of the Carolina roads.  Up to that\r\npoint I feel full confidence, but from there may have to manoeuvre\r\nsome, and will be guided by the questions of weather and supplies.\r\n\r\nYou remember we had fine weather last February for our Meridian\r\ntrip, and my memory of the weather at Charleston is, that February\r\nis usually a fine month.  Before the March storms come we should be\r\nwithin striking distance of the coast. The months of April and May\r\nwill be the best for operations from Goldsboro' to Raleigh and the\r\nRoanoke.  You may rest assured that I will keep my troops well in\r\nhand, and, if I get worsted, will aim to make the enemy pay so\r\ndearly that you will have less to do.  I know that this trip is\r\nnecessary; it must be made sooner or later; I am on time, and in\r\nthe right position for it.  My army is large enough for the\r\npurpose, and I ask no reinforcement, but simply wish the utmost\r\nactivity to be kept up at all other points, so that concentration\r\nagainst me may not be universal.\r\n\r\nI suspect that Jeff. Davis will move heaven and earth to catch me,\r\nfor success to this column is fatal to his dream of empire.\r\nRichmond is not more vital to his cause than Columbia and the heart\r\nof South Carolina.\r\n\r\nIf Thomas will not move on Selma, order him to occupy Rome,\r\nKingston, and Allatoona, and again threaten Georgia in the\r\ndirection of Athena.\r\n\r\nI think the \"poor white trash\" of the South are falling out of\r\ntheir ranks by sickness, desertion, and every available means; but\r\nthere is a large class of vindictive Southerners who will fight to\r\nthe last.  The squabbles in Richmond, the howls in Charleston, and\r\nthe disintegration elsewhere, are all good omens for us; we must\r\nnot relax one iota, but, on the contrary, pile up our efforts: I\r\nworld, ere this, have been off, but we had terrific rains, which\r\ncaught us in motion, and nearly drowned some of the troops in the\r\nrice-fields of the Savannah, swept away our causeway (which had\r\nbeen carefully corduroyed), and made the swamps hereabout mere\r\nlakes of slimy mud.  The weather is now good, and I have the army\r\non terra firma.  Supplies, too, came for a long time by daily\r\ndriblets instead of in bulk; this is now all remedied, and I hope\r\nto start on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nI will issue instructions to General Foster, based on the\r\nreenforcements of North Carolina; but if Schofield comes, you had\r\nbetter relieve Foster, who cannot take the field, and needs an\r\noperation on his leg.  Let Schofield take command, with his\r\nheadquarters at Beaufort, North Carolina, and with orders to secure\r\nGoldsboro' (with its railroad communication back to Beaufort and\r\nWilmington).  If Lee lets us get that position, he is gone up.\r\n\r\nI will start with my Atlanta army (sixty thousand), supplied as\r\nbefore, depending on the country for all food in excess of thirty\r\ndays.  I will have less cattle on the hoof, but I hear of hogs,\r\ncows, and calves, in Barnwell and the Colombia districts.  Even\r\nhere we have found some forage.  Of course, the enemy will carry\r\noff and destroy some forage, but I will burn the houses where the\r\npeople burn their forage, and they will get tired of it.\r\n\r\nI must risk Hood, and trust to you to hold Lee or be on his heels\r\nif he comes south.  I observe that the enemy has some respect for\r\nmy name, for they gave up Pocotaligo without a fight when they\r\nheard that the attacking force belonged to my army.  I will try and\r\nkeep up that feeling, which is a real power.  With respect, your\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-general commanding.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I leave my chief-quartermaster and commissary behind to\r\nfollow coastwise.\r\nW. T. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dispatch No. 6.]\r\n\r\nFLAG-STEAMER PHILADELPHIA\r\nSAVANNAH RIVER, January 4, 1865.\r\n\r\nHON. GIDEON WELLS, Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have already apprised the Department that the army of\r\nGeneral Sherman occupied the city of Savannah on the 21st of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe rebel army, hardly respectable in numbers or condition, escaped\r\nby crossing the river and taking the Union Causeway toward the\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nI have walked about the city several times, and can affirm that its\r\ntranquillity is undisturbed.  The Union soldiers who are stationed\r\nwithin its limits are as orderly as if they were in New York or\r\nBoston....  One effect of the march of General Sherman through\r\nGeorgia has been to satisfy the people that their credulity has\r\nbeen imposed upon by the lying assertions of the rebel Government,\r\naffirming the inability of the United States Government to\r\nwithstand the armies of rebeldom.  They have seen the old flag of\r\nthe United States carried by its victorious legions through their\r\nState, almost unopposed, and placed in their principal city without\r\na blow.\r\n\r\nSince the occupation of the city General Sherman has been occupied\r\nin making arrangements for its security after he leaves it for the\r\nmarch that he meditates.  My attention has been directed to such\r\nmeasures of cooperation as the number and quality of my force\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d I arrived here from Charleston, whither, as I stated in\r\nmy dispatch of the 29th of December, I had gone in consequence of\r\ninformation from the senior officer there that the rebels\r\ncontemplated issuing from the harbor, and his request for my\r\npresence.  Having placed a force there of seven monitors,\r\nsufficient to meet each an emergency, and not perceiving any sign\r\nof the expected raid, I returned to Savannah, to keep in\r\ncommunication with General Sherman and be ready to render any\r\nassistance that might be desired.  General Sherman has fully\r\ninformed me of his plans, and, so far as my means permit, they\r\nshall not lack assistance by water.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d the transfer of the right wing to Beaufort was began, and\r\nthe only suitable vessel I had at hand (the Harvest Moon) was sent\r\nto Thunderbolt to receive the first embarkation.  This took place\r\nabout 3 p.m., and was witnessed by General Sherman and General\r\nBernard (United States Engineers) and myself.  The Pontiac is\r\nordered around to assist, and the army transports also followed the\r\nfirst move by the Harvest Moon.\r\n\r\nI could not help remarking the unbroken silence that prevailed in\r\nthe large array of troops; not a voice was to be heard, as they\r\ngathered in masses on the bluff to look at the vessels.  The notes\r\nof a solitary bugle alone came from their midst.\r\n\r\nGeneral Barnard made a brief visit to one of the rebel works\r\n(Cansten's Bluff) that dominated this water-course--the best\r\napproach of the kind to Savannah.\r\n\r\nI am collecting data that will fully exhibit to the Department the\r\npowerful character of the defenses of the city and its approaches.\r\nGeneral Sherman will not retain the extended limits they embrace.\r\nbut will contract the line very much.\r\n\r\nGeneral Foster still holds the position near the Tullifinny.  With\r\nhis concurrence I have detached the fleet brigade, and the men\r\nbelonging to it have returned to their vessels.  The excellent\r\nservice performed by this detachment has fully realized my wishes,\r\nand exemplified the efficiency of the organization--infantry and\r\nlight artillery handled as skirmishers.  The howitzers were always\r\nlanded as quickly as the men, and were brought into action before\r\nthe light pieces of the land-service could be got ashore.\r\n\r\nI regret very much that the reduced complements of the vessels\r\nprevent me from maintaining the force in constant organization.\r\nWith three hundred more marines and five hundred seamen I could\r\nfrequently operate to great advantage, at the present time, when\r\nthe attention of the rebels is so engrossed by General Sherman.\r\n\r\nIt is said that they have a force at Hardeeville, the pickets of\r\nwhich were retained on the Union Causeway until a few days since,\r\nwhen some of our troops crossed the river and pushed them back.\r\nConcurrently with this, I caused the Sonoma to anchor so as to\r\nsweep the ground in the direction of the causeway.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the right-wing (thirty thousand men) to Beaufort\r\nwill so imperil the rebel force at Hardeeville that it will be cut\r\noff or dispersed, if not moved in season.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I will send the Dai-Ching to St. Helena, to meet any want\r\nthat may arise in that quarter, while the Mingo and Pontiac will be\r\nready to act from Broad River.\r\n\r\nThe general route of the army will be northward; but the exact\r\ndirection must be decided more or less by circumstances which it\r\nmay not be possible to foresee....\r\n\r\nMy cooperation will be confined to assistance in attacking\r\nCharleston, or in establishing communication at Georgetown, in case\r\nthe army pushes on without attacking Charleston, and time alone\r\nwill show which of these will eventuate.\r\n\r\nThe weather of the winter first, and the condition of the ground in\r\nspring, would permit little advantage to be derived from the\r\npresence of the army at Richmond until the middle of May.  So that\r\nGeneral Sherman has no reason to move in haste, but can choose such\r\nobjects as he prefers, and take as much time as their attainment\r\nmay demand.  The Department will learn the objects in view of\r\nGeneral Sherman more precisely from a letter addressed by him to\r\nGeneral Halleck, which he read to me a few days since.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. A. DAHLGREN,\r\nRear-Admiral, commanding South-Atlantic Blockading Squadron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, POCOTALIGO, SOUTH CAROLINA, January 29, 1885.\r\n\r\nMajor-General J. G. FOSTER, commanding Department of the South.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have just received dispatches from General Grant,\r\nstating that Schofield's corps (the Twenty-third), twenty-one\r\nthousand strong, is ordered east from Tennessee, and will be sent\r\nto Beaufort, North Carolina.  That is well; I want that force to\r\nsecure a point on the railroad about Goldsboro', and then to build\r\nthe railroad out to that point.  If Goldsboro' be too strong to\r\ncarry by a rapid movement, then a point near the Neuse, south of\r\nGoldsboro', will answer, but the bridge and position about Kinston,\r\nshould be held and fortified strong.  The movement should be masked\r\nby the troops already at Newbern.  Please notify General Palmer\r\nthat these troops are coming, and to be prepared to receive them.\r\nMajor-General Schofield will command in person, and is admirably\r\nadapted for the work.  If it is possible, I want him to secure\r\nGoldsboro', with the railroad back to Morehead City and Wilmington.\r\nAs soon as General Schofield reaches Fort Macon, have him to meet\r\nsome one of your staff, to explain in full the details of the\r\nsituation of affairs with me; and you can give him the chief\r\ncommand of all troops at Cape Fear and in North Carolina.  If he\r\nfinds the enemy has all turned south against me, he need not\r\nfollow, but turn his attention against Raleigh; if he can secure\r\nGoldsboro' and Wilmington, it will be as much as I expect before I\r\nhave passed the Santee.  Send him all detachments of men that have\r\ncome to join my army.  They can be so organized and officered as to\r\nbe efficient, for they are nearly all old soldiers who have been\r\ndetached or on furlough.  Until I pass the Santee, you can better\r\nuse these detachments at Bull's Bay, Georgetown, etc.\r\n\r\nI will instruct General McCallum, of the Railroad Department, to\r\ntake his men up to Beaufort, North Carolina, and employ them on the\r\nroad out.  I do not know that he can use them on any road here.  I\r\ndid instruct him, while awaiting information from North Carolina,\r\nto have them build a good trestle-bridge across Port Royal ferry;\r\nbut I now suppose the pontoon-bridge will do.  If you move the\r\npontoons, be sure to make a good road out to Garden's Corners, and\r\nmark it with sign-boards--obstructing the old road, so that, should\r\nI send back any detachments, they would not be misled.\r\n\r\nI prefer that Hatch's force should not be materially weakened until\r\nI am near Columbia, when you may be governed by the situation of\r\naffairs about Charleston.  If you can break the railroad between\r\nthis and Charleston, then this force could be reduced.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, POCOTALIGO, SOUTH CAROLINA, January 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nHon. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR: When you left Savannah a few days ago, you forgot the map\r\nwhich General Geary had prepared for you, showing the route by\r\nwhich his division entered the city of Savannah, being the first\r\ntroops to occupy that city.  I now send it to you.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of the opportunity also to inclose you copies of all\r\nmy official orders touching trade and intercourse with the people\r\nof Georgia, as well as for the establishment of the negro\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nDelegations of the people of Georgia continue to come in, and I am\r\nsatisfied that, by judicious handling and by a little respect shown\r\nto their prejudices, we can create a schism in Jeff. Davis's\r\ndominions.  All that I have conversed with realize the truth that\r\nslavery as an institution is defunct, and the only questions that\r\nremain are what disposition shall be made of the negroes\r\nthemselves.  I confess myself unable to offer a complete solution\r\nfor these questions, and prefer to leave it to the slower\r\noperations of time.  We have given the initiative, and can afford\r\nto await the working of the experiment.\r\n\r\nAs to trade-matters, I also think it is to our interest to keep the\r\nSouthern people somewhat dependent on the articles of commerce to\r\nwhich they have hitherto been accustomed.  General Grover is now\r\nhere, and will, I think, be able to handle this matter judiciously,\r\nand may gradually relax, and invite cotton to come in in large\r\nquantities.  But at first we should manifest no undue anxiety on\r\nthat score; for the rebels would at once make use of it as a power\r\nagainst us.  We should assume, a tone of perfect contempt for\r\ncotton and every thing else in comparison with the great object of\r\nthe war--the restoration of the Union, with all its rights and\r\npower.  It the rebels burn cotton as a war measure, they simply\r\nplay into our hands by taking away the only product of value they\r\nhave to exchange in foreign ports for war-ships and munitions.  By\r\nsuch a course, also, they alienate the feelings of a large class of\r\nsmall farmers who look to their little parcels of cotton to\r\nexchange for food and clothing for their families.  I hope the\r\nGovernment will not manifest too much anxiety to obtain cotton in\r\nlarge quantities, and especially that the President will not\r\nindorse the contracts for the purchase of large quantities of\r\ncotton.  Several contracts, involving from six to ten thousand\r\nbales, indorsed by Mr. Lincoln, have been shown me, but were not in\r\nsuch a form as to amount to an order to compel me to facilitate\r\ntheir execution.\r\n\r\nAs to Treasury agents, and agents to take charge of confiscated and\r\nabandoned property, whose salaries depend on their fees, I can only\r\nsay that, as a general rule, they are mischievous and disturbing\r\nelements to a military government, and it is almost impossible for\r\nus to study the law and regulations so as to understand fully their\r\npowers and duties.  I rather think the Quartermaster's Department\r\nof the army could better fulfill all their duties and accomplish\r\nall that is aimed at by the law.  Yet on this subject I will leave\r\nGenerals Foster and Grover to do the best they can.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, POCOTALIGO, SOUTH CAROLINA, January 2, 1865.\r\n\r\nHon. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have just received from Lieutenant-General Grant a copy of\r\nthat part of your telegram to him of December 26th relating to\r\ncotton, a copy of which has been immediately furnished to General\r\nEaston, chief-quartermaster, who will be strictly governed by it.\r\n\r\nI had already been approached by all the consuls and half the\r\npeople of Savannah on this cotton question, and my invariable\r\nanswer was that all the cotton in Savannah was prize of war,\r\nbelonged to the United States, and nobody should recover a bale of\r\nit with my consent; that, as cotton had been one of the chief\r\ncauses of this war, it should help to pay its expenses; that all\r\ncotton became tainted with treason from the hour the first act of\r\nhostility was committed against the United States some time in\r\nDecember, 1860; and that no bill of sale subsequent to that date\r\ncould convey title.\r\n\r\nMy orders were that an officer of the Quartermaster's Department,\r\nUnited States Army, might furnish the holder, agent, or attorney, a\r\nmere certificate of the fact of seizure, with description of the\r\nbales' marks, etc., the cotton then to be turned over to the agent\r\nof the Treasury Department, to be shipped to New York for sale.\r\nBut, since the receipt of your dispatch, I have ordered General\r\nEaston to make the shipment himself to the quartermaster at New\r\nYork, where you can dispose of it at pleasure.  I do not think the\r\nTreasury Department ought to bother itself with the prizes or\r\ncaptures of war.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay, former consul at New York, representing Mr. Molyneux,\r\nformer consul here, but absent a long time, called on me with\r\nreference to cotton claimed by English subjects.  He seemed amazed\r\nwhen I told him I should pay no respect to consular certificates,\r\nthat in no event would I treat an English subject with more favor\r\nthan one of our own deluded citizens, and that for my part I was\r\nunwilling to fight for cotton for the benefit of Englishmen openly\r\nengaged in smuggling arms and instruments of war to kill us; that,\r\non the contrary, it would afford me great satisfaction to conduct\r\nmy army to Nassau, and wipe out that nest of pirates.  I explained\r\nto him, however, that I was not a diplomatic agent of the General\r\nGovernment of the United States, but that my opinion, so frankly\r\nexpressed, was that of a soldier, which it would be well for him to\r\nheed.  It appeared, also, that he owned a plantation on the line of\r\ninvestment of Savannah, which, of course, was pillaged, and for\r\nwhich he expected me to give some certificate entitling him to\r\nindemnification, which I declined emphatically.\r\n\r\nI have adopted in Savannah rules concerning property--severe but\r\njust--founded upon the laws of nations and the practice of\r\ncivilized governments, and am clearly of opinion that we should\r\nclaim all the belligerent rights over conquered countries, that the\r\npeople may realize the truth that war is no child's play.\r\n\r\nI embrace in this a copy of a letter, dated December 31, 1864, in\r\nanswer to one from Solomon Cohen (a rich lawyer) to General Blair,\r\nhis personal friend, as follows:\r\n\r\nMajor-General F. P. BLAIR, commanding Seventeenth Army Corps.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your note, inclosing Mr. Cohen's of this date, is\r\nreceived, and I answer frankly through you his inquiries.\r\n\r\n1.  No one can practise law as an attorney in the United States\r\nwithout acknowledging the supremacy of our Government.  If I am not\r\nin error, an attorney is as much an officer of the court as the\r\nclerk, and it would be a novel thing in a government to have a\r\ncourt to administer law which denied the supremacy of the\r\ngovernment itself.\r\n\r\n2.  No one will be allowed the privileges of a merchant, or,\r\nrather, to trade is a privilege which no one should seek of the\r\nGovernment without in like manner acknowledging its supremacy.\r\n\r\n3.  If Mr. Cohen remains in Savannah as a denizen, his property,\r\nreal and personal, will not be disturbed unless its temporary use\r\nbe necessary for the military authorities of the city.  The title\r\nto property will not be disturbed in any event, until adjudicated\r\nby the courts of the United States.\r\n\r\n4.  If Mr. Cohen leaves Savannah under my Special Order No. 148, it\r\nis a public acknowledgment that he \"adheres to the enemies of the\r\nUnited States,\" and all his property becomes forfeited to the\r\nUnited States.  But, as a matter of favor, he will be allowed to\r\ncarry with him clothing and furniture for the use of himself, his\r\nfamily, and servants, and will be trans ported within the enemy's\r\nlines, but not by way of Port Royal.\r\n\r\nThese rules will apply to all parties, and from them no exception\r\nwill be made.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was in answer to specific inquiries; it is clear, and\r\ncovers all the points, and, should I leave before my orders are\r\nexecuted, I will endeavor to impress upon my successor, General\r\nFoster, their wisdom and propriety.\r\n\r\nI hope the course I have taken in these matters will meet your\r\napprobation, and that the President will not refund to parties\r\nclaiming cotton or other property, without the strongest evidence\r\nof loyalty and friendship on the part of the claimant, or unless\r\nsome other positive end is to be gained.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN OF THE CAROLINAS.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY AND MARCH, 1865.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of February, as before explained, the army designed\r\nfor the active campaign from Savannah northward was composed of two\r\nwings, commanded respectively by Major-Generals Howard and Slocum,\r\nand was substantially the same that had marched from Atlanta to\r\nSavannah.  The same general orders were in force, and this campaign\r\nmay properly be classed as a continuance of the former.\r\n\r\nThe right wing, less Corse's division, Fifteenth Corps, was grouped\r\nat or near Pocotaligo, South Carolina, with its wagons filled with\r\nfood, ammunition, and forage, all ready to start, and only waiting\r\nfor the left wing, which was detained by the flood in the Savannah\r\nRiver.  It was composed as follows:\r\n\r\nFifteenth Corps, Major-General JOHN A. LOGAN.\r\n\r\nFirst Division, Brigadier-General Charles R. Woods;\r\nSecond Division, Major-General W. B. Hazen;\r\nThird Division, Brigadier-General John E. Smith;\r\nFourth Division, Brigadier-General John M. Corse.\r\nArtillery brigade, eighteen guns, Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. Ross,\r\nFirst Michigan Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeenth.  Corps, Major-General FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.\r\n\r\nFirst Division, Major-General Joseph A.  Mower;\r\nSecond Division, Brigadier-General M.  F.  Force;\r\nFourth Division, Brigadier-General Giles A.  Smith.\r\nArtillery brigade, fourteen guns, Major A.  C.  Waterhouse, First\r\nIllinois Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe left wing, with Corse's division and Kilpatrick's cavalry,\r\nwas at and near Sister's Ferry, forty miles above the city of\r\nSavannah, engaged in crossing the river, then much swollen.\r\nIt was composed as follows:\r\n\r\nFourteenth Corps, Major-General JEFF. C. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nFirst Division, Brigadier-General W.  P.  Carlin;\r\nSecond Division, Brigadier-General John D.  Morgan;\r\nThird Division, Brigadier-General A.  Baird.\r\nArtillery brigade, sixteen guns, Major Charles Houghtaling, First\r\nIllinois Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwentieth Corps, Brigadier-General A. S. WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nFirst Division, Brigadier-General N. I. Jackson;\r\nSecond Division, Brigadier-General J. W. Geary;\r\nThird Division, Brigadier-General W. T. Ward.\r\nArtillery brigade, Sixteen gnus, Major J. A. Reynolds, First New\r\nYork Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nCavalry Division, Brigadier-General JUDSON KILPATRICK.\r\n\r\nFirst Brigade, Colonel T. J. Jordan, Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry;\r\nSecond Brigade, Colonel S. D. Atkins, Ninety-second Illinois Vol.;\r\nThird Brigade, Colonel George E.  Spencer, First Alabama Cavalry.\r\nOne battery of four guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual strength of the army, as given in the following official\r\ntabular statements, was at the time sixty thousand and seventy-nine\r\nmen, and sixty-eight guns.  The trains were made up of about\r\ntwenty-five hundred wagons, with six mules to each wagon, and about\r\nsix hundred ambulances, with two horses each.  The contents of the\r\nwagons embraced an ample supply of ammunition for a great battle;\r\nforage for about seven days, and provisions for twenty days, mostly\r\nof bread, sugar, coffee, and salt, depending largely for fresh meat\r\non beeves driven on the hoof and such cattle, hogs, and poultry, as\r\nwe expected to gather along our line of march.\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION-CAMPAIGN OF THE CAROLINAS.\r\n\r\n      February 1.    March 1.    April 1.    April 10\r\nPers:  60,079         57,676      81,150      88,948\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enemy occupied the cities of Charleston and Augusta, with\r\ngarrisons capable of making a respectable if not successful\r\ndefense, but utterly unable to meet our veteran columns in the open\r\nfield.  To resist or delay our progress north, General Wheeler had\r\nhis division of cavalry (reduced to the size of a brigade by his\r\nhard and persistent fighting ever since the beginning of the\r\nAtlanta campaign), and General Wade Hampton had been dispatched\r\nfrom the Army of Virginia to his native State of South Carolina,\r\nwith a great flourish of trumpets, and extraordinary powers to\r\nraise men, money, and horses, with which \"to stay the progress of\r\nthe invader,\" and \"to punish us for our insolent attempt to invade\r\nthe glorious State of South Carolina!\"  He was supposed at the time\r\nto have, at and near Columbia, two small divisions of cavalry\r\ncommanded by himself and General Butler.\r\n\r\nOf course, I had a species of contempt for these scattered and\r\ninconsiderable forces, knew that they could hardly delay us an\r\nhour; and the only serious question that occurred to me was, would\r\nGeneral Lee sit down in Richmond (besieged by General Grant), and\r\npermit us, almost unopposed, to pass through the States of South\r\nand North Carolina, cutting off and consuming the very supplies on\r\nwhich he depended to feed his army in Virginia, or would he make an\r\neffort to escape from General Grant, and endeavor to catch us\r\ninland somewhere between Columbia and Raleigh?  I knew full well at\r\nthe time that the broken fragments of Hood's army (which had\r\nescaped from Tennessee) were being hurried rapidly across Georgia,\r\nby Augusta, to make junction in my front; estimating them at the\r\nmaximum twenty-five thousand men, and Hardee's, Wheeler's, and\r\nHampton's forces at fifteen thousand, made forty thousand; which,\r\nif handled with spirit and energy, would constitute a formidable\r\nforce, and might make the passage of such rivers as the Santee and\r\nCape Fear a difficult undertaking.  Therefore, I took all possible\r\nprecautions, and arranged with Admiral Dahlgren and General Foster\r\nto watch our progress inland by all the means possible, and to\r\nprovide for us points of security along the coast; as, at Bull's\r\nBay, Georgetown, and the mouth of Cape Fear River.  Still, it was\r\nextremely desirable in one march to reach Goldsboro' in the State\r\nof North Carolina (distant four hundred and twenty-five miles), a\r\npoint of great convenience for ulterior operations, by reason of\r\nthe two railroads which meet there, coming from the seacoast at\r\nWilmington and Newbern.  Before leaving Savannah I had sent to\r\nNewbern Colonel W. W. Wright, of the Engineers, with orders to look\r\nto these railroads, to collect rolling-stock, and to have the roads\r\nrepaired out as far as possible in six weeks--the time estimated as\r\nnecessary for us to march that distance.\r\n\r\nThe question of supplies remained still the one of vital\r\nimportance, and I reasoned that we might safely rely on the country\r\nfor a considerable quantity of forage and provisions, and that, if\r\nthe worst came to the worst, we could live several months on the\r\nmules and horses of our trains.  Nevertheless, time was equally\r\nmaterial, and the moment I heard that General Slocum had finished\r\nhis pontoon-bridge at Sister's Ferry, and that Kilpatrick's cavalry\r\nwas over the river, I gave the general orders to march, and\r\ninstructed all the columns to aim for the South Carolina Railroad\r\nto the west of Branchville, about Blackville and Midway.\r\n\r\nThe right wing moved up the Salkiehatchie, the Seventeenth Corps on\r\nthe right, with orders on reaching Rivers's Bridge to cross over,\r\nand the Fifteenth Corps by Hickory Hill to Beaufort's Bridge.\r\nKilpatrick was instructed to march by way of Barnwell; Corse's\r\ndivision and the Twentieth Corps to take such roads as would bring\r\nthem into communication with the Fifteenth Corps about Beaufort's\r\nBridge.  All these columns started promptly on the 1st of February.\r\nWe encountered Wheeler's cavalry, which had obstructed the road by\r\nfelling trees, but our men picked these up and threw them aside, so\r\nthat this obstruction hardly delayed us an hour.  In person I\r\naccompanied the Fifteenth Corps (General Logan) by McPhersonville\r\nand Hickory Hill, and kept couriers going to and fro to General\r\nSlocum with instructions to hurry as much as possible, so as to\r\nmake a junction of the whole army on the South Carolina Railroad\r\nabout Blackville.\r\n\r\nI spent the night of February 1st at Hickory Hill Post-Office, and\r\nthat of the 2d at Duck Branch Post-Office, thirty-one miles out\r\nfrom Pocotaligo.  On the 3d the Seventeenth Corps was opposite\r\nRivers's Bridge, and the Fifteenth approached Beaufort's Bridge.\r\nThe Salkiehatchie was still over its banks, and presented a most\r\nformidable obstacle.  The enemy appeared in some force on the\r\nopposite bank, had cut away all the bridges which spanned the many\r\ndeep channels of the swollen river, and the only available passage\r\nseemed to be along the narrow causeways which constituted the\r\ncommon roads.  At Rivers's Bridge Generals Mower and Giles A.\r\nSmith led, their heads of column through this swamp, the water up\r\nto their shoulders, crossed over to the pine-land, turned upon the\r\nrebel brigade which defended the passage, and routed it in utter\r\ndisorder.  It was in this attack that General Wager Swayne lost his\r\nleg, and he had to be conveyed back to Pocotaligo.  Still, the loss\r\nof life was very small, in proportion to the advantages gained, for\r\nthe enemy at once abandoned the whole line of the Salkiehatchie,\r\nand the Fifteenth Corps passed over at Beaufort's Bridge, without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February I was at Beaufort's Bridge, by which time\r\nGeneral A. S. Williams had got up with five brigades' of the\r\nTwentieth Corps; I also heard of General Kilpatrick's being abreast\r\nof us, at Barnwell, and then gave orders for the march straight for\r\nthe railroad at Midway.  I still remained with the Fifteenth Corps,\r\nwhich, on the 6th of February, was five miles from Bamberg.  As a\r\nmatter of course, I expected severe resistance at this railroad,\r\nfor its loss would sever all the communications of the enemy in\r\nCharleston with those in Augusta.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 7th, in the midst of a rain-storm, we reached the\r\nrailroad; almost unopposed, striking it at several points.  General\r\nHoward told me a good story concerning this, which will bear\r\nrepeating: He was with the Seventeenth Corps, marching straight for\r\nMidway, and when about five miles distant he began to deploy the\r\nleading division, so as to be ready for battle.  Sitting on his\r\nhorse by the road-side, while the deployment was making, he saw a\r\nman coming down the road, riding as hard as he could, and as he\r\napproached he recognized him as one of his own \"foragers,\" mounted\r\non a white horse, with a rope bridle and a blanket for saddle.  As\r\nhe came near he called out, \"Hurry up, general; we have got the\r\nrailroad!\"  So, while we, the generals, were proceeding\r\ndeliberately to prepare for a serious battle, a parcel of our\r\nforagers, in search of plunder, had got ahead and actually captured\r\nthe South Carolina Railroad, a line of vital importance to the\r\nrebel Government.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we struck the railroad, details of men were set to work\r\nto tear up the rails, to burn the ties and twist the bars.  This\r\nwas a most important railroad, and I proposed to destroy it\r\ncompletely for fifty miles, partly to prevent a possibility of its\r\nrestoration and partly to utilize the time necessary for General\r\nSlocum to get up.\r\n\r\nThe country thereabouts was very poor, but the inhabitants mostly\r\nremained at home.  Indeed, they knew not where to go.  The enemy's\r\ncavalry had retreated before us, but his infantry was reported in\r\nsome strength at Branchville, on the farther side of the Edisto;\r\nyet on the appearance of a mere squad of our men they burned their\r\nown bridges the very thing I wanted, for we had no use for them,\r\nand they had.\r\n\r\nWe all remained strung along this railroad till the 9th of\r\nFebruary--the Seventeenth Corps on the right, then the Fifteenth,\r\nTwentieth, and cavalry, at Blackville.  General Slocum reached\r\nBlackville that day, with Geary's division of the Twentieth Corps,\r\nand reported the Fourteenth Corps (General Jeff. C. Davis's) to be\r\nfollowing by way of Barnwell.  On the 10th I rode up to Blackville,\r\nwhere I conferred with Generals Slocum and Kilpatrick, became\r\nsatisfied that the whole army would be ready within a day, and\r\naccordingly made orders for the next movement north to Columbia,\r\nthe right wing to strike Orangeburg en route.  Kilpatrick was\r\nordered to demonstrate strongly toward Aiken, to keep up the\r\ndelusion that we might turn to Augusta; but he was notified that\r\nColumbia was the next objective, and that he should cover the left\r\nflank against Wheeler, who hung around it.  I wanted to reach\r\nColumbia before any part of Hood's army could possibly get there.\r\nSome of them were reported as having reached Augusta, under the\r\ncommand of General Dick Taylor.\r\n\r\nHaving sufficiently damaged the railroad, and effected the junction\r\nof the entire army, the general march was resumed on the 11th, each\r\ncorps crossing the South Edisto by separate bridges, with orders to\r\npause on the road leading from Orangeberg to Augusta, till it was\r\ncertain that the Seventeenth Corps had got possession of\r\nOrangeburg.  This place was simply important as its occupation\r\nwould sever the communications between Charleston and Columbia.\r\nAll the heads of column reached this road, known as the Edgefield\r\nroad, during the 12th, and the Seventeenth Corps turned to the\r\nright, against Orangeburg.  When I reached the head of column\r\nopposite Orangeburg, I found Giles A. Smith's division halted, with\r\na battery unlimbered, exchanging shots with a party on the opposite\r\nside of the Edisto.  He reported that the bridge was gone, and that\r\nthe river was deep and impassable.  I then directed General Blair\r\nto send a strong division below the town, some four or five miles,\r\nto effect a crossing there.  He laid his pontoon-bridge, but the\r\nbottom on the other side was overflowed, and the men had to wade\r\nthrough it, in places as deep as their waists.  I was with this\r\ndivision at the time, on foot, trying to pick my way across the\r\noverflowed bottom; but, as soon as the head of column reached the\r\nsand-hills, I knew that the enemy would not long remain in\r\nOrangeburg, and accordingly returned to my horse, on the west bank,\r\nand rode rapidly up to where I had left Giles A. Smith.  I found\r\nhim in possession of the broken bridge, abreast of the town, which\r\nhe was repairing, and I was among the first to cross over and enter\r\nthe town.  By and before the time either Force's or Giles A.\r\nSmith's skirmishers entered the place, several stores were on fire,\r\nand I am sure that some of the towns-people told me that a Jew\r\nmerchant had set fire to his own cotton and store, and from this\r\nthe fire had spread.  This, however, was soon put out, and the\r\nSeventeenth Corps (General Blair) occupied the place during that\r\nnight.  I remember to have visited a large hospital, on the hill\r\nnear the railroad depot, which was occupied by the orphan children\r\nwho had been removed from the asylum in Charleston.  We gave them\r\nprotection, and, I think, some provisions.  The railroad and depot\r\nwere destroyed by order, and no doubt a good deal of cotton was\r\nburned, for we all regarded cotton as hostile property, a thing to\r\nbe destroyed.  General Blair was ordered to break up this railroad,\r\nforward to the point where it crossed the Santee, and then to turn\r\nfor Columbia.  On the morning of the 13th I again joined the\r\nFifteenth Corps, which crossed the North Edisto by Snilling's\r\nBridge, and moved straight for Columbia, around the head of Caw-Caw\r\nSwamp.  Orders were sent to all the columns to turn for Columbia,\r\nwhere it was supposed the enemy had concentrated all the men they\r\ncould from Charleston, Augusta, and even from Virginia.  That night\r\nI was with the Fifteenth Corps, twenty-one miles from Columbia,\r\nwhere my aide, Colonel Audenried, picked up a rebel officer on the\r\nroad, who, supposing him to be of the same service with himself,\r\nanswered all his questions frankly, and revealed the truth that\r\nthere was nothing in Columbia except Hampton's cavalry.  The fact\r\nwas, that General Hardee, in Charleston, took it for granted that\r\nwe were after Charleston; the rebel troops in Augusta supposed they\r\nwere \"our objective;\" so they abandoned poor Columbia to the care\r\nof Hampton's cavalry, which was confused by the rumors that poured\r\nin on it, so that both Beauregard and Wade Hampton, who were in\r\nColumbia, seem to have lost their heads.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th the head of the Fifteenth Corps, Charles R. Woods's\r\ndivision, approached the Little Congaree, a broad, deep stream,\r\ntributary to the Main Congaree; six or eight miles below Columbia.\r\nOn the opposite side of this stream was a newly-constructed fort,\r\nand on our side--a wide extent of old cotton-fields, which, had been\r\noverflowed, and was covered with a deep slime.  General Woods had\r\ndeployed his leading brigade, which was skirmishing forward, but he\r\nreported that the bridge was gone, and that a considerable force of\r\nthe enemy was on the other side.  I directed General Howard or\r\nLogan to send a brigade by a circuit to the left, to see if this\r\nstream could not be crossed higher up, but at the same time knew\r\nthat General Slocum's route world bring him to Colombia behind this\r\nstream, and that his approach would uncover it.  Therefore, there\r\nwas no need of exposing much life.  The brigade, however, found\r\nmeans to cross the Little Congaree, and thus uncovered the passage\r\nby the main road, so that General Woods's skirmishers at once\r\npassed over, and a party was set to work to repair the bridge,\r\nwhich occupied less than an hour, when I passed over with my whole\r\nstaff.  I found the new fort unfinished and unoccupied, but from\r\nits parapet could see over some old fields bounded to the north and\r\nwest by hills skirted with timber.  There was a plantation to our\r\nleft, about half a mile, and on the edge of the timber was drawn up\r\na force of rebel cavalry of about a regiment, which advanced, and\r\ncharged upon some, of our foragers, who were plundering the\r\nplantation; my aide, Colonel Audenried, who had ridden forward,\r\ncame back somewhat hurt and bruised, for, observing this charge of\r\ncavalry, he had turned for us, and his horse fell with him in\r\nattempting to leap a ditch.  General Woods's skirmish-line met this\r\ncharge of cavalry, and drove it back into the woods and beyond.  We\r\nremained on that ground during the night of the 15th, and I camped\r\non the nearest dry ground behind the Little Congaree, where on the\r\nnext morning were made the written' orders for the government of\r\nthe troops while occupying Columbia.  These are dated February 16,\r\n1865, in these words:\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard will cross the Saluda and Broad Rivers as near their\r\nmouths as possible, occupy Columbia, destroy the public buildings,\r\nrailroad property, manufacturing and machine shops; but will spare\r\nlibraries, asylums, and private dwellings.  He will then move to\r\nWinnsboro', destroying en route utterly that section of the\r\nrailroad.  He will also cause all bridges, trestles, water-tanks,\r\nand depots on the railroad back to the Wateree to be burned,\r\nswitches broken, and such other destruction as he can find time to\r\naccomplish consistent with proper celerity.\r\n\r\nThese instructions were embraced in General Order No. 26, which\r\nprescribed the routes of march for the several columns as far as\r\nFayetteville, North Carolina, and is conclusive that I then\r\nregarded Columbia as simply one point on our general route of\r\nmarch, and not as an important conquest.\r\n\r\nDuring the 16th of February the Fifteenth Corps reached the point\r\nopposite Columbia, and pushed on for the Saluda Factory three miles\r\nabove, crossed that stream, and the head of column reached Broad\r\nRiver just in time to find its bridge in flames, Butler's cavalry\r\nhaving just passed over into Columbia.  The head of Slocum's column\r\nalso reached the point opposite Columbia the same morning, but the\r\nbulk of his army was back at Lexington.  I reached this place early\r\nin the morning of the 16th, met General Slocum there; and explained\r\nto him the purport of General Order No. 26, which contemplated the\r\npassage of his army across Broad River at Alston, fifteen miles\r\nabove Columbia.  Riding down to the river-bank, I saw the wreck of\r\nthe large bridge which had been burned by the enemy, with its many\r\nstone piers still standing, but the superstructure gone.  Across\r\nthe Congaree River lay the city of Columbia, in plain, easy view.\r\nI could see the unfinished State-House, a handsome granite\r\nstructure, and the ruins of the railroad depot, which were still\r\nsmouldering.  Occasionally a few citizens or cavalry could be seen\r\nrunning across the streets, and quite a number of negroes were\r\nseemingly busy in carrying off bags of grain or meal, which were\r\npiled up near the burned depot.\r\n\r\nCaptain De Gres had a section of his twenty-pound Parrott guns\r\nunlimbered, firing into the town.  I asked him what he was firing\r\nfor; he said he could see some rebel cavalry occasionally at the\r\nintersections of the streets, and he had an idea that there was a\r\nlarge force of infantry concealed on the opposite bank, lying low,\r\nin case we should attempt to cross over directly into the town.  I\r\ninstructed him not to fire any more into the town, but consented to\r\nhis bursting a few shells near the depot, to scare away the negroes\r\nwho were appropriating the bags of corn and meal which we wanted,\r\nalso to fire three shots at the unoccupied State-House.  I stood by\r\nand saw these fired, and then all firing ceased.  Although this\r\nmatter of firing into Columbia has been the subject of much abuse\r\nand investigation, I have yet to hear of any single person having\r\nbeen killed in Columbia by our cannon.  On the other hand, the\r\nnight before, when Woods's division was in camp in the open fields\r\nat Little Congaree, it was shelled all night by a rebel battery\r\nfrom the other aide of the river.  This provoked me much at the\r\ntime, for it was wanton mischief, as Generals Beauregard and\r\nHampton must have been convinced that they could not prevent our\r\nentrance into Columbia.  I have always contended that I would have\r\nbeen justified in retaliating for this unnecessary act of war, but\r\ndid not, though I always characterized it as it deserved.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 16th I camped near an old prison bivouac opposite\r\nColumbia, known to our prisoners of war as \"Camp Sorghum,\" where\r\nremained the mud-hovels and holes in the ground which our prisoners\r\nhad made to shelter themselves from the winter's cold and the\r\nsummer's heat.  The Fifteenth Corps was then ahead, reaching to\r\nBroad River, about four miles above Columbia; the Seventeenth Corps\r\nwas behind, on the river-bank opposite Columbia; and the left wing\r\nand cavalry had turned north toward Alston.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, viz., February 17th, I rode to the head of\r\nGeneral Howard's column, and found that during the night he had\r\nferried Stone's brigade of Woods's division of the Fifteenth\r\nCorps across by rafts made of the pontoons, and that brigade was\r\nthen deployed on the opposite bank to cover the construction of a\r\npontoon-bridge nearly finished.\r\n\r\nI sat with General Howard on a log, watching the men lay this\r\nbridge; and about 9 or 10 A.M.  a messenger came from Colonel Stone\r\non the other aide, saying that the Mayor of Columbia had come out\r\nof the city to surrender the place, and asking for orders.  I\r\nsimply remarked to General Howard that he had his orders, to let\r\nColonel Stone go on into the city, and that we would follow as soon\r\nas the bridge was ready.  By this same messenger I received a note\r\nin pencil from the Lady Superioress of a convent or school in\r\nColumbia, in which she claimed to have been a teacher in a convent\r\nin Brown County, Ohio, at the time my daughter Minnie was a pupil\r\nthere, and therefore asking special protection.  My recollection\r\nis, that I gave the note to my brother-in-law, Colonel Ewing, then\r\ninspector-general on my staff, with instructions to see this lady,\r\nand assure her that we contemplated no destruction of any private\r\nproperty in Columbia at all.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bridge was done, I led my horse over it, followed by\r\nmy whole staff.  General Howard accompanied me with his, and\r\nGeneral Logan was next in order, followed by General C.  R.  Woods,\r\nand the whole of the Fifteenth Corps.  Ascending the hill, we soon\r\nemerged into a broad road leading into Columbia, between old fields\r\nof corn and cotton, and, entering the city, we found seemingly all\r\nits population, white and black, in the streets.  A high and\r\nboisterous wind was prevailing from the north, and flakes of cotton\r\nwere flying about in the air and lodging in the limbs of the trees,\r\nreminding us of a Northern snow-storm.  Near the market-square we\r\nfound Stone's brigade halted, with arms stacked, and a large detail\r\nof his men, along with some citizens, engaged with an old\r\nfire-engine, trying to put out the fire in a long pile of burning\r\ncotton-bales, which I was told had been fired by the rebel cavalry\r\non withdrawing from the city that morning.  I know that, to avoid\r\nthis row of burning cotton-bales, I had to ride my horse on the\r\nsidewalk.  In the market-square had collected a large crowd of\r\nwhites and blacks, among whom was the mayor of the city, Dr.\r\nGoodwin, quite a respectable old gentleman, who was extremely\r\nanxious to protect the interests of the citizens.  He was on foot,\r\nand I on horseback, and it is probable I told him then not to be\r\nuneasy, that we did not intend to stay long, and had no purpose to\r\ninjure the private citizens or private property.  About this time I\r\nnoticed several men trying to get through the crowd to speak with\r\nme, and called to some black people to make room for them; when\r\nthey reached me, they explained that they were officers of our\r\narmy, who had been prisoners, had escaped from the rebel prison and\r\nguard, and were of course overjoyed to find themselves safe with\r\nus.  I told them that, as soon as things settled down, they should\r\nreport to General Howard, who would provide for their safety, and\r\nenable them to travel with us.  One of them handed me a paper,\r\nasking me to read it at my leisure; I put it in my breast-pocket\r\nand rode on.  General Howard was still with me, and, riding down\r\nthe street which led by the right to the Charleston depot, we found\r\nit and a large storehouse burned to the ground, but there were, on\r\nthe platform and ground near by, piles of cotton bags filled with\r\ncorn and corn-meal, partially burned.\r\n\r\nA detachment of Stone's brigade was guarding this, and separating\r\nthe good from the bad.  We rode along the railroad-track, some\r\nthree or four hundred yards, to a large foundery, when some man\r\nrode up and said the rebel cavalry were close by, and he warned us\r\nthat we might get shot.  We accordingly turned back to the\r\nmarket-square, and en route noticed that, several of the men were\r\nevidently in liquor, when I called General Howard's attention to\r\nit.  He left me and rode toward General Woods's head of column,\r\nwhich was defiling through the town.  On reaching the\r\nmarket-square, I again met Dr. Goodwin, and inquired where he\r\nproposed to quarter me, and he said that he had selected the house\r\nof Blanton Duncan, Esq., a citizen of Louisville, Kentucky, then a\r\nresident there, who had the contract for manufacturing the\r\nConfederate money, and had fled with Hampton's cavalry.  We all\r\nrode some six or eight squares back from the new State-House, and\r\nfound a very good modern house, completely furnished, with stabling\r\nand a large yard, took it as our headquarters, and occupied it\r\nduring our stay.  I considered General Howard as in command of the\r\nplace, and referred the many applicants for guards and protection\r\nto him.  Before our headquarters-wagons had got up, I strolled\r\nthrough the streets of Columbia, found sentinels posted at the\r\nprincipal intersections, and generally good order prevailing, but\r\ndid not again return to the main street, because it was filled with\r\na crowd of citizens watching the soldiers marching by.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of that day, February 17th, the whole of the\r\nFifteenth Corps passed through the town and out on the Camden and\r\nWinnsboro' roads.  The Seventeenth Corps did not enter the city at\r\nall, but crossed directly over to the Winnsboro' road from the\r\npontoon bridge at Broad River, which was about four miles above the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nAfter we had got, as it were, settled in Blanton Duncan's house,\r\nsay about 2 p.m., I overhauled my pocket according to custom, to\r\nread more carefully the various notes and memoranda received during\r\nthe day, and found the paper which had been given me, as described,\r\nby one of our escaped prisoners.  It proved to be the song of\r\n\"Sherman's March to the Sea,\" which had been composed by Adjutant\r\nS. H. M. Byers, of the Fifth Iowa Infantry, when a prisoner in the\r\nasylum at Columbia, which had been beautifully written off by a\r\nfellow-prisoner, and handed to me in person.  This appeared to me\r\nso good that I at once sent for Byers, attached him to my staff,\r\nprovided him with horse and equipment, and took him as far as\r\nFayetteville, North Carolina, whence he was sent to Washington as\r\nbearer of dispatches.  He is now United States consul at Zurich,\r\nSwitzerland, where I have since been his guest. I insert the song\r\nhere for convenient reference and preservation.  Byers said that\r\nthere was an excellent glee-club among the prisoners in Columbia,\r\nwho used to sing it well, with an audience often of rebel ladies:\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA.\r\n\r\nComposed by Adjutant Byers, Fifth Iowa Infantry.  Arranged and sung\r\nby the Prisoners in Columbia Prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOur camp-fires shone bright on the mountain\r\nThat frowned on the river below,\r\nAs we stood by our guns in the morning,\r\nAnd eagerly watched for the foe;\r\nWhen a rider came out of the darkness\r\nThat hung over mountain and tree,\r\nAnd shouted, \"Boys, up and be ready!\r\nFor Sherman will march to the sea!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS:\r\n\r\nThen sang we a song of our chieftain,\r\nThat echoed over river and lea;\r\nAnd the stars of our banner shone brighter\r\nWhen Sherman marched down to the sea!\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThen cheer upon cheer for bold Sherman\r\nWent up from each valley and glen,\r\nAnd the bugles reechoed the music\r\nThat came from the lips of the men;\r\nFor we knew that the stars in our banner\r\nMore bright in their splendor would be,\r\nAnd that blessings from Northland world greet us,\r\nWhen Sherman marched down to the sea!\r\n             Then sang we a song, etc.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThen forward, boys! forward to battle!\r\nWe marched on our wearisome way,\r\nWe stormed the wild hills of Resacar\r\nGod bless those who fell on that day!\r\nThen Kenesaw frowned in its glory,\r\nFrowned down on the flag of the free;\r\nBut the East and the West bore our standard,\r\nAnd Sherman marched on to the sea!\r\n        Then sang we a song, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nStill onward we pressed, till our banners\r\nSwept out from Atlanta's grim walls,\r\nAnd the blood of the patriot dampened\r\nThe soil where the traitor-flag falls;\r\nBut we paused not to weep for the fallen,\r\nWho slept by each river and tree,\r\nYet we twined them a wreath of the laurel,\r\nAs Sherman marched down to the sea!\r\n        Then sang we a song, etc.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOh, proud was our army that morning,\r\nThat stood where the pine darkly towers,\r\nWhen Sherman said, \"Boys, you are weary,\r\nBut to-day fair Savannah is ours!\"\r\nThen sang we the song of our chieftain,\r\nThat echoed over river and lea,\r\nAnd the stars in our banner shone brighter\r\nWhen Sherman camped down by the sea!\r\n\r\n\r\nToward evening of February 17th, the mayor, Dr. Goodwin, came to my\r\nquarters at Duncan's house, and remarked that there was a lady in\r\nColumbia who professed to be a special friend of mine.  On his\r\ngiving her name, I could not recall it, but inquired as to her\r\nmaiden or family name.  He answered Poyas.  It so happened that,\r\nwhen I was a lieutenant at Fort Moultrie, in 1842-'46, I used very\r\noften to visit a family of that name on the east branch of Cooper\r\nRiver, about forty miles from Fort Moultrie, and to hunt with the\r\nson, Mr. James Poyas, an elegant young fellow and a fine sportsman.\r\nHis father, mother, and several sisters, composed the family, and\r\nwere extremely hospitable.  One of the ladies was very fond of\r\npainting in water-colors, which was one of my weaknesses, and on\r\none occasion I had presented her with a volume treating of\r\nwater-colors.  Of course, I was glad to renew the acquaintance, and\r\nproposed to Dr. Goodwin that we should walk to her house and visit\r\nthis lady, which we did.  The house stood beyond the Charlotte\r\ndepot, in a large lot, was of frame, with a high porch, which was\r\nreached by a set of steps outside.  Entering this yard, I noticed\r\nducks and chickens, and a general air of peace and comfort that was\r\nreally pleasant to behold at that time of universal desolation; the\r\nlady in question met us at the head of the steps and invited us\r\ninto a parlor which was perfectly neat and well furnished.  After\r\ninquiring about her father, mother, sisters, and especially her\r\nbrother James, my special friend, I could not help saying that I\r\nwas pleased to notice that our men had not handled her house and\r\npremises as roughly as was their wont.  \"I owe it to you, general,\"\r\nshe answered.  \"Not at all.  I did not know you were here till a\r\nfew minutes ago.\"  She reiterated that she was indebted to me for\r\nthe perfect safety of her house and property, and added, \"You\r\nremember, when you were at our house on Cooper River in 1845, you\r\ngave me a book;\" and she handed me the book in question, on the fly\r\nleaf of which was written: \"To Miss Poyas, with the compliments of\r\nW. T. Sherman, First-lieutenant Third Artillery.\"  She then\r\nexplained that, as our army approached Columbia, there was a doubt\r\nin her mind whether the terrible Sherman who was devastating the\r\nland were W. T. Sherman or T. W. Sherman, both known to be generals\r\nin the Northern army; but, on the supposition that he was her old\r\nacquaintance, when Wade Hampton's cavalry drew out of the city,\r\ncalling out that the Yankees were coming, she armed herself with\r\nthis book, and awaited the crisis.  Soon the shouts about the\r\nmarkethouse announced that the Yankees had come; very soon men were\r\nseen running up and down the streets; a parcel of them poured over\r\nthe fence, began to chase the chickens and ducks, and to enter her\r\nhouse.  She observed one large man, with full beard, who exercised\r\nsome authority, and to him she appealed in the name of \"his\r\ngeneral.\"  \"What do you know of Uncle Billy?\"  \"Why,\" she said,\r\n\"when he was a young man he used to be our friend in Charleston,\r\nand here is a book he gave me.\"  The officer or soldier took the\r\nbook, looked at the inscription, and, turning to his fellows, said:\r\n\"Boys, that's so; that's Uncle Billy's writing, for I have seen it\r\noften before.\"  He at once commanded the party to stop pillaging,\r\nand left a man in charge of the house, to protect her until the\r\nregular provost-guard should be established.  I then asked her if\r\nthe regular guard or sentinel had been as good to her.  She assured\r\nme that he was a very nice young man; that he had been telling her\r\nall about his family in Iowa; and that at that very instant of time\r\nhe was in another room minding her baby.  Now, this lady had good\r\nsense and tact, and had thus turned aside a party who, in five\r\nminutes more, would have rifled her premises of all that was good\r\nto eat or wear.  I made her a long social visit, and, before\r\nleaving Columbia, gave her a half-tierce of rice and about one\r\nhundred pounds of ham from our own mess-stores.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, that same evening I found in Mrs. Simons another\r\nacquaintance--the wife of the brother of Hon. James Simons, of\r\nCharleston, who had been Miss Wragg.  When Columbia was on fire\r\nthat night, and her house in danger, I had her family and effects\r\ncarried to my own headquarters, gave them my own room and bed, and,\r\non leaving Columbia the next day, supplied her with a half-barrel\r\nof hams and a half-tierce of rice.  I mention these specific facts\r\nto show that, personally, I had no malice or desire to destroy that\r\ncity or its inhabitants, as is generally believed at the South.\r\n\r\nHaving walked over much of the suburbs of Columbia in the\r\nafternoon, and being tired, I lay down on a bed in Blanton Duncan's\r\nhouse to rest. Soon after dark I became conscious that a bright\r\nlight was shining on the walls; and, calling some one of my staff\r\n(Major Nichols, I think) to inquire the cause, he said there seemed\r\nto be a house on fire down about the market-house.  The same high\r\nwind still prevailed, and, fearing the consequences, I bade him go\r\nin person to see if the provost-guard were doing its duty.  He soon\r\nreturned, and reported that the block of buildings directly\r\nopposite the burning cotton of that morning was on fire, and that\r\nit was spreading; but he had found General Woods on the ground,\r\nwith plenty of men trying to put the fire out, or, at least, to\r\nprevent its extension.  The fire continued to increase, and the\r\nwhole heavens became lurid.  I dispatched messenger after messenger\r\nto Generals Howard, Logan, and Woods, and received from them\r\nrepeated assurances that all was being done that could be done, but\r\nthat the high wind was spreading the flames beyond all control.\r\nThese general officers were on the ground all night, and Hazen's\r\ndivision had been brought into the city to assist Woods's division,\r\nalready there.  About eleven o'clock at night I went down-town\r\nmyself, Colonel Dayton with me; we walked to Mr. Simons's house,\r\nfrom which I could see the flames rising high in the air, and could\r\nhear the roaring of the fire.  I advised the ladies to move to my\r\nheadquarters, had our own headquarter-wagons hitched up, and their\r\neffects carried there, as a place of greater safety.  The whole air\r\nwas full of sparks and of flying masses of cotton, shingles, etc.,\r\nsome of which were carried four or five blocks, and started new\r\nfires.  The men seemed generally under good control, and certainly\r\nlabored hard to girdle the fire, to prevent its spreading; but, so\r\nlong as the high wind prevailed, it was simply beyond human\r\npossibility.  Fortunately, about 3 or 4 A.M., the wind moderated,\r\nand gradually the fire was got under control; but it had burned out\r\nthe very heart of the city, embracing several churches, the old\r\nState-House, and the school or asylum of that very Sister of\r\nCharity who had appealed for my personal protection.  Nickerson's\r\nHotel, in which several of my staff were quartered, was burned\r\ndown, but the houses occupied by myself, Generals Howard and Logan,\r\nwere not burned at all.  Many of the people thought that this fire\r\nwas deliberately planned and executed.  This is not true.  It was\r\naccidental, and in my judgment began with the cotton which General\r\nHampton's men had set fire to on leaving the city (whether by his\r\norders or not is not material), which fire was partially subdued\r\nearly in the day by our men; but, when night came, the high wind\r\nfanned it again into full blaze, carried it against the\r\nframe-houses, which caught like tinder, and soon spread beyond our\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThis whole subject has since been thoroughly and judicially\r\ninvestigated, in some cotton cases, by the mixed commission on\r\nAmerican and British claims, under the Treaty of Washington, which\r\ncommission failed to award a verdict in favor of the English\r\nclaimants, and thereby settled the fact that the destruction of\r\nproperty in Columbia, during that night, did not result from the\r\nacts of the General Government of the United States--that is to\r\nsay, from my army.  In my official report of this conflagration, I\r\ndistinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so\r\npointedly, to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in\r\nmy opinion boastful, and professed to be the special champion of\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe morning sun of February 18th rose bright and clear over a\r\nruined city.  About half of it was in ashes and in smouldering\r\nheaps.  Many of the people were houseless, and gathered in groups\r\nin the suburbs, or in the open parks and spaces, around their\r\nscanty piles of furniture.  General Howard, in concert with the\r\nmayor, did all that was possible to provide other houses for them;\r\nand by my authority he turned over to the Sisters of Charity the\r\nMethodist College, and to the mayor five hundred beef-cattle; to\r\nhelp feed the people; I also gave the mayor (Dr.  Goodwin) one\r\nhundred muskets, with which to arm a guard to maintain order after\r\nwe should leave the neighborhood.  During the 18th and 19th we\r\nremained in Columbia, General Howard's troops engaged in tearing up\r\nand destroying the railroad, back toward the Wateree, while a\r\nstrong detail, under the immediate supervision of Colonel O. M.\r\nPoe, United States Engineers, destroyed the State Arsenal, which\r\nwas found to be well supplied with shot, shell, and ammunition.\r\nThese were hauled in wagons to the Saluda River, under the\r\nsupervision of Colonel Baylor, chief of ordnance, and emptied into\r\ndeep water, causing a very serious accident by the bursting of a\r\npercussion-shell, as it struck another on the margin of the water.\r\nThe flame followed back a train of powder which had sifted out,\r\nreached the wagons, still partially loaded, and exploded them,\r\nkilling sixteen men and destroying several wagons and teams of\r\nmules.  We also destroyed several valuable founderies and the\r\nfactory of Confederate money.  The dies had been carried away, but\r\nabout sixty handpresses remained.  There was also found an immense\r\nquantity of money, in various stages of manufacture, which our men\r\nspent and gambled with in the most lavish manner.\r\n\r\nHaving utterly ruined Columbia, the right wing began its march\r\nnorthward, toward Winnsboro', on the 20th, which we reached on the\r\n21st, and found General Slocum, with the left wing, who had come by\r\nthe way of Alston.  Thence the right wing was turned eastward,\r\ntoward Cheraw, and Fayetteville, North Carolina, to cross the\r\nCatawba River at Peay's Ferry.  The cavalry was ordered to follow\r\nthe railroad north as far as Chester, and then to turn east to\r\nRocky Mount, the point indicated for the passage of the left wing.\r\nIn person I reached Rocky Mount on the 22d, with the Twentieth\r\nCorps, which laid its pontoon-bridge and crossed over during the\r\n23d.  Kilpatrick arrived the next day, in the midst of heavy rain,\r\nand was instructed to cross the Catawba at once, by night, and to\r\nmove up to Lancaster, to make believe we were bound for Charlotte,\r\nto which point I heard that Beauregard had directed all his\r\ndetachments, including a corps of Hood's old army, which had been\r\nmarching parallel with us, but had failed to make junction with,\r\nthe forces immediately opposing us.  Of course, I had no purpose of\r\ngoing to Charlotte, for the right wing was already moving rapidly\r\ntoward Fayetteville, North Carolina.  The rain was so heavy and\r\npersistent that the Catawba, River rose fast, and soon after I had\r\ncrossed the pontoon bridge at Rocky Mount it was carried away,\r\nleaving General Davis, with the Fourteenth Corps, on the west bank.\r\nThe roads were infamous, so I halted the Twentieth Corps at Hanging\r\nRock for some days, to allow time for the Fourteenth to get over.\r\n\r\nGeneral Davis had infinite difficulty in reconstructing his bridge,\r\nand was compelled to use the fifth chains of his wagons for\r\nanchor-chains, so that we were delayed nearly a week in that\r\nneighborhood. While in camp at Hanging Rock two prisoners were\r\nbrought to me--one a chaplain, the other a boy, son of Richard Bacot,\r\nof Charleston, whom I had known as a cadet at West Point.  They were\r\njust from Charleston, and had been sent away by General Hardee in\r\nadvance, because he was, they said, evacuating Charleston.  Rumors to\r\nthe same effect had reached me through the negroes, and it was,\r\nmoreover, reported that Wilmington, North Carolina, was in possession\r\nof the Yankee troops; so that I had every reason to be satisfied that\r\nour march was fully reaping all the fruits we could possibly ask for.\r\nCharleston was, in fact, evacuated by General Hardee on the 18th of\r\nFebruary, and was taken possession of by a brigade of General Fosters\r\ntroops, commanded by General Schimmelpfennig, the same day.  Hardee\r\nhad availed himself of his only remaining railroad, by Florence to\r\nCheraw; had sent there much of his ammunition and stores, and reached\r\nit with the effective part of the garrison in time to escape across\r\nthe Pedee River before our arrival.  Wilmington was captured by\r\nGeneral Terry on the 22d of February; but of this important event we\r\nonly knew by the vague rumors which reached us through rebel sources.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jeff. C. Davis got across the Catawba during the 27th, and\r\nthe general march was resumed on Cheraw.  Kilpatrick remained near\r\nLancaster, skirmishing with Wheeler's and Hampton's cavalry,\r\nkeeping up the delusion that we proposed to move on Charlotte and\r\nSalisbury, but with orders to watch the progress of the Fourteenth\r\nCorps, and to act in concert with it, on its left rear.  On the 1st\r\nof March I was at Finlay's Bridge across Lynch's Creek, the roads\r\nso bad that we had to corduroy nearly every foot of the way; but I\r\nwas in communication with all parts of the army, which had met no\r\nserious opposition from the enemy.  On the 2d of March we entered\r\nthe village of Chesterfield, skirmishing with Butler's cavalry,\r\nwhich gave ground rapidly.  There I received a message from General\r\nHoward, who, reported that he was already in Cheraw with the\r\nSeventeenth Corps, and that the Fifteenth was near at hand.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hardee had retreated eastward across the Pedee, burning the\r\nbridge.  I therefore directed the left wing to march for\r\nSneedsboro', about ten miles above Cheraw, to cross the Pedee\r\nthere, while I in person proposed to cross over and join the right\r\nwing in Cheraw.  Early in the morning of the 3d of March I rode out\r\nof Chesterfield along with the Twentieth Corps, which filled the\r\nroad, forded Thompson's Creek, and, at the top of the hill beyond,\r\nfound a road branching off to the right, which corresponded with\r\nthe one, on my map leading to Cheraw.  Seeing a negro standing by\r\nthe roadside, looking at the troops passing, I inquired of him what\r\nroad that was.  \"Him lead to Cheraw, master!\"  \"Is it a good road,\r\nand how far?\"  \"A very good road, and eight or ten miles.\"  \"Any\r\nguerrillas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no, master, dey is gone two days ago; you could have played\r\ncards on der coat-tails, dey was in sich a hurry!\"  I was on my\r\nLexington horse, who was very handsome and restive, so I made\r\nsignal to my staff to follow, as I proposed to go without escort.\r\nI turned my horse down the road, and the rest of the staff\r\nfollowed.  General Barry took up the questions about the road, and\r\nasked the same negro what he was doing there.  He answered, \"Dey\r\nsay Massa Sherman will be along soon!\"  \"Why,\" said General Barry,\r\n\"that was General Sherman you were talking to.\"  The poor negro,\r\nalmost in the attitude of prayer, exclaimed: \"De great God! just\r\nlook at his horse!\"  He ran up and trotted by my side for a mile or\r\nso, and gave me all the information he possessed, but he seemed to\r\nadmire the horse more than the rider.\r\n\r\nWe reached Cheraw in a couple of hours in a drizzling rain, and,\r\nwhile waiting for our wagons to come up, I staid with General Blair\r\nin a large house, the property of a blockade-runner, whose family\r\nremained.  General Howard occupied another house farther down-town.\r\nHe had already ordered his pontoon-bridge to be laid across the\r\nPedee, there a large, deep, navigable stream, and Mower's division\r\nwas already across, skirmishing with the enemy about two miles out.\r\nCheraw was found to be full of stores which had been sent up from\r\nCharleston prior to its evacuation, and which could not be removed.\r\nI was satisfied, from inquiries, that General Hardee had with him\r\nonly the Charleston garrison, that the enemy had not divined our\r\nmovements, and that consequently they were still scattered from\r\nCharlotte around to Florence, then behind us.  Having thus secured\r\nthe passage of the Pedee, I felt no uneasiness about the future,\r\nbecause there remained no further great impediment between us and\r\nCape Fear River, which I felt assured was by that time in\r\npossession of our friends.  The day was so wet that we all kept\r\nin-doors; and about noon General Blair invited us to take lunch\r\nwith him.  We passed down into the basement dining-room, where the\r\nregular family table was spread with an excellent meal; and during\r\nits progress I was asked to take some wine, which stood upon the\r\ntable in venerable bottles.  It was so very good that I inquired\r\nwhere it came from.  General Blair simply asked, \"Do you like it?\"\r\nbut I insisted upon knowing where he had got it; he only replied by\r\nasking if I liked it, and wanted some.  He afterward sent to my\r\nbivouac a case containing a dozen bottles of the finest madeira I\r\never tasted; and I learned that he had captured, in Cheraw, the\r\nwine of some of the old aristocratic families of Charleston, who\r\nhad sent it up to Cheraw for safety, and heard afterward that Blair\r\nhad found about eight wagon-loads of this wine, which he\r\ndistributed to the army generally, in very fair proportions.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing our lunch, as we passed out of the dining room,\r\nGeneral Blair asked me, if I did not want some saddle-blankets, or\r\na rug for my tent, and, leading me into the hall to a space under\r\nthe stairway, he pointed out a pile of carpets which had also been\r\nsent up from Charleston for safety.  After our headquarter-wagons\r\ngot up, and our bivouac was established in a field near by, I sent\r\nmy orderly (Walter) over to General Blair, and he came back\r\nstaggering under a load of carpets, out of which the officers and\r\nescort made excellent tent-rugs, saddle-cloths, and blankets.\r\nThere was an immense amount of stores in Cheraw, which were used or\r\ndestroyed; among them twenty-four guns, two thousand muskets, and\r\nthirty-six hundred barrels of gunpowder.  By the carelessness of a\r\nsoldier, an immense pile of this powder was exploded, which shook\r\nthe town badly; and killed and maimed several of our men.\r\n\r\nWe remained in or near Cheraw till the 6th of March, by which time\r\nthe army was mostly across the Pedee River, and was prepared to\r\nresume the march on Fayetteville.  In a house where General Hardee\r\nhad been, I found a late New York Tribune, of fully a month later\r\ndate than any I had seen.  It contained a mass of news of great\r\ninterest to us, and one short paragraph which I thought extremely\r\nmischievous.  I think it was an editorial, to the effect that at\r\nlast the editor had the satisfaction to inform his readers that\r\nGeneral Sherman would next be heard from about Goldsboro', because\r\nhis supply-vessels from Savannah were known to be rendezvousing at\r\nMorehead City:--Now, I knew that General Hardee had read that same\r\npaper, and that he would be perfectly able to draw his own\r\ninferences.  Up to, that moment I had endeavored so to feign to our\r\nleft that we had completely, misled our antagonists; but this was\r\nno longer possible, and I concluded that we must be ready, for the\r\nconcentration in our front of all the force subject to General Jos.\r\nJohnston's orders, for I was there also informed that he had been\r\nrestored to the full command of the Confederate forces in South and\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March I crossed the Pedee, and all the army marched\r\nfor Fayetteville: the Seventeenth Corps kept well to the right, to\r\nmake room; the Fifteenth Corps marched by a direct road; the\r\nFourteenth Corps also followed a direct road from Sneedsboro',\r\nwhere it had crossed the Pedee; and the Twentieth Corps, which had\r\ncome into Cheraw for the convenience of the pontoon-bridge,\r\ndiverged to the left, so as to enter Fayetteville next after the\r\nFourteenth Corps, which was appointed to lead into Fayetteville.\r\nKilpatrick held his cavalry still farther to the left rear on the\r\nroads from Lancaster, by way of Wadesboro' and New Gilead, so as to\r\ncover our trains from Hampton's and Wheeler's cavalry, who had\r\nfirst retreated toward the north.  I traveled with the Fifteenth\r\nCorps, and on the 8th of March reached Laurel Hill, North Carolina.\r\nSatisfied that our troops must be at Wilmington, I determined to\r\nsend a message there; I called for my man, Corporal Pike, whom I\r\nhad rescued as before described, at Columbia, who was then\r\ntraveling with our escort, and instructed him in disguise to work\r\nhis way to the Cape Fear River, secure a boat, and float down to\r\nWilmington to convey a letter, and to report our approach.  I also\r\ncalled on General Howard for another volunteer, and he brought me a\r\nvery clever young sergeant, who is now a commissioned officer in\r\nthe regular army.  Each of these got off during the night by\r\nseparate routes, bearing the following message, reduced to the same\r\ncipher we used in telegraphic messages:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, LAUREL HILL, Wednesday, March 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nCommanding Officer, Wilmington, North Carolina:\r\n\r\nWe are marching for Fayetteville, will be there Saturday, Sunday,\r\nand Monday, and will then march for Goldsboro'.\r\n\r\nIf possible, send a boat up Cape Fear River, and have word conveyed\r\nto General Schofield that I expect to meet him about Goldsboro'.\r\nWe are all well and have done finely.  The rains make our roads\r\ndifficult, and may delay us about Fayetteville, in which case I\r\nwould like to have some bread, sugar, and coffee.  We have\r\nabundance of all else.  I expect to reach Goldsboro' by the 20th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 9th I was with the Fifteenth Corps, and toward evening\r\nreached a little church called Bethel, in the woods, in which we\r\ntook refuge in a terrible storm of rain, which poured all night,\r\nmaking the roads awful.  All the men were at work corduroying the\r\nroads, using fence-rails and split saplings, and every foot of the\r\nway had thus to be corduroyed to enable the artillery and wagons to\r\npass.  On the 10th we made some little progress; on the 11th I\r\nreached Fayetteville, and found that General Hardee, followed by\r\nWade Hampton's cavalry, had barely escaped across Cape Fear River,\r\nburning the bridge which I had hoped to save.  On reaching\r\nFayetteville I found General Slocum already in possession with the\r\nFourteenth Corps, and all the rest of the army was near at hand.  A\r\nday or two before, General Kilpatrick, to our left rear, had\r\ndivided his force into two parts, occupying roads behind the\r\nTwentieth Corps, interposing between our infantry columns and Wade\r\nHampton's cavalry.  The latter, doubtless to make junction with\r\nGeneral Hardee, in Fayetteville, broke across this line, captured\r\nthe house in which General Kilpatrick and the brigade-commander,\r\nGeneral Spencer, were, and for a time held possession of the camp\r\nand artillery of the brigade.  However, General Kilpatrick and most\r\nof his men escaped into a swamp with their arms, reorganized and\r\nreturned, catching Hampton's men--in turn, scattered and drove them\r\naway, recovering most of his camp and artillery; but Hampton got\r\noff with Kilpatrick's private horses and a couple hundred\r\nprisoners, of which he boasted much in passing through\r\nFayetteville.\r\n\r\nIt was also reported that, in the morning after Hardee's army was\r\nall across the bridge at Cape Fear River, Hampton, with a small\r\nbodyguard, had remained in town, ready to retreat and burn the\r\nbridge as soon as our forces made their appearance.  He was getting\r\nbreakfast at the hotel when the alarm was given, when he and his\r\nescort took saddle, but soon realized that the alarm came from a\r\nset of our foragers, who, as usual, were extremely bold and rash.\r\nOn these he turned, scattered them, killing some and making others\r\nprisoners; among them General Howard's favorite scout, Captain\r\nDuncan.  Hampton then crossed the bridge and burned it.\r\n\r\nI took up my quarters at the old United States Arsenal, which was\r\nin fine order, and had been much enlarged by the Confederate\r\nauthorities, who never dreamed that an invading army would reach it\r\nfrom the west; and I also found in Fayetteville the widow and\r\ndaughter of my first captain (General Childs), of the Third\r\nArtillery, learned that her son Fred had been the ordnance-officer\r\nin charge of the arsenal, and had of course fled with Hardee's\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nDuring the 11th. the whole army closed down upon Fayetteville, and\r\nimmediate preparations were made to lay two pontoon bridges, one\r\nnear the burned bridge, and another about four miles lower down.\r\n\r\nSunday, March 12th, was a day of Sabbath stillness in Fayetteville.\r\nThe people generally attended their churches, for they were a very\r\npious people, descended in a large measure from the old Scotch\r\nCovenanters, and our men too were resting from the toils and labors\r\nof six weeks of as hard marching as ever fell to the lot of\r\nsoldiers.  Shortly after noon was heard in the distance the shrill\r\nwhistle of a steamboat, which came nearer and nearer, and soon a\r\nshout, long and continuous, was raised down by the river, which\r\nspread farther and farther, and we all felt that it meant a\r\nmessenger from home.  The effect was electric, and no one can\r\nrealize the feeling unless, like us, he has been for months cut off\r\nfrom all communication with friends, and compelled to listen to the\r\ncroakings and prognostications of open enemies.  But in a very few\r\nminutes came up through the town to the arsenal on the plateau\r\nbehind a group of officers, among whom was a large, florid\r\nseafaring man, named Ainsworth, bearing a small mail-bag from\r\nGeneral Terry, at Wilmington, having left at 2 p.m.  the day\r\nbefore.  Our couriers had got through safe from Laurel Hill, and\r\nthis was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of our former march from Atlanta, intense anxiety\r\nhad been felt for our safety, and General Terry had been prompt to\r\nopen communication.  After a few minutes' conference with Captain\r\nAinsworth about the capacity of his boat, and the state of facts\r\nalong the river, I instructed him to be ready to start back at 6\r\np.m., and ordered Captain Byers to get ready to carry dispatches to\r\nWashington.  I also authorized General Howard to send back by this\r\nopportunity some of the fugitives who had traveled with his army\r\nall the way from Columbia, among whom were Mrs. Feaster and her two\r\nbeautiful daughters.\r\n\r\nI immediately prepared letters for Secretary Stanton, Generals\r\nHalleck and Grant, and Generals Schofield, Foster, Easton, and\r\nBeckwith, all of which have been published, but I include here only\r\nthose to the Secretary of War, and Generals Grant and Terry, as\r\nsamples of the whole:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, IN THE FIELD,\r\nFAYETTVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, Sunday, March.  12, 1885.\r\n\r\nHon. E.  M.  STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: I know you will be pleased to hear that my army has\r\nreached this point, and has opened communication with Wilmington.\r\nA tug-boat came up this morning, and will start back at 6 P. M.\r\n\r\nI have written a letter to General Grant, the substance of which he\r\nwill doubtless communicate, and it must suffice for me to tell you\r\nwhat I know will give you pleasure--that I have done all that I\r\nproposed, and the fruits seem to me ample for the time employed.\r\nCharleston, Georgetown, and Wilmington, are incidents, while the\r\nutter demolition of the railroad system of South Carolina, and the\r\nutter destruction of the enemy's arsenals of Columbia, Cheraw, and\r\nFayetteville, are the principals of the movement.  These points\r\nwere regarded as inaccessible to us, and now no place in the\r\nConfederacy is safe against the army of the West.  Let Lee hold on\r\nto Richmond, and we will destroy his country; and then of what use\r\nis Richmond.  He must come out and fight us on open ground, and for\r\nthat we must ever be ready.  Let him stick behind his parapets, and\r\nhe will perish.\r\n\r\nI remember well what you asked me, and think I am on the right\r\nroad, though a long one.  My army is as united and cheerful as\r\never, and as full of confidence in itself and its leaders.  It is\r\nutterly impossible for me to enumerate what we have done, but I\r\ninclose a slip just handed me, which is but partial.  At Columbia\r\nand Cheraw we destroyed nearly all the gunpowder and cartridges\r\nwhich the Confederacy had in this part of the country.  This\r\narsenal is in fine order, and has been much enlarged.  I cannot\r\nleave a detachment to hold it, therefore shall burn it, blow it up\r\nwith gunpowder, and then with rams knock down its walls.  I take it\r\nfor granted the United States will never again trust North Carolina\r\nwith an arsenal to appropriate at her pleasure.\r\n\r\nHoping that good fortune may still attend my army.  I remain your\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, IN THE FIELD,\r\nFAYETTVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, Sunday, March.  12, 1885.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, commanding United States Army,\r\nCity Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: We reached this place yesterday at noon; Hardee, as\r\nusual, retreating across the Cape Fear, burning his bridges; but\r\nour pontoons will be up to-day, and, with as little delay as\r\npossible, I will be after him toward Goldsboro'.\r\n\r\nA tug has just come up from Wilmington, and before I get off from\r\nhere, I hope to get from Wilmington some shoes and stockings,\r\nsugar, coffee, and flour.  We are abundantly supplied with all\r\nelse, having in a measure lived off the country.\r\n\r\nThe army is in splendid health, condition, and spirits, though we\r\nhave had foul weather, and roads that would have stopped travel to\r\nalmost any other body of men I ever heard of.\r\n\r\nOur march, was substantially what I designed--straight on Columbia,\r\nfeigning on Branchville and Augusta.  We destroyed, in passing, the\r\nrailroad from the Edisto nearly up to Aiken; again, from Orangeburg\r\nto the Congaree; again, from Colombia down to Kingsville on the\r\nWateree, and up toward Charlotte as far as the Chester line; thence\r\nwe turned east on Cheraw and Fayetteville.  At Colombia we\r\ndestroyed immense arsenals and railroad establishments, among which\r\nwore forty-three cannon.  At Cheraw we found also machinery and\r\nmaterial of war sent from Charleston, among which were twenty-five\r\nguns and thirty-six hundred barrels of powder; and here we find\r\nabout twenty guns and a magnificent United States' arsenal.\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to leave detachments, and I shall therefore\r\ndestroy this valuable arsenal, so the enemy shall not have its use;\r\nand the United States should never again confide such valuable\r\nproperty to a people who have betrayed a trust.\r\n\r\nI could leave here to-morrow, but want to clear my columns of the\r\nvast crowd of refugees and negroes that encumber us.  Some I will\r\nsend down the river in boats, and the rest to Wilmington by land,\r\nunder small escort, as soon as we are across Cape Fear River.\r\n\r\nI hope you have not been uneasy about us, and that the fruits of\r\nthis march will be appreciated.  It had to be made not only to\r\ndestroy the valuable depots by the way, but for its incidents in\r\nthe necessary fall of Charleston, Georgetown, and Wilmington.  If I\r\ncan now add Goldsboro' without too much cost, I will be in a\r\nposition to aid you materially in the spring campaign.\r\n\r\nJos. Johnston may try to interpose between me here and Schofield\r\nabout Newbern; but I think he will not try that, but concentrate\r\nhis scattered armies at Raleigh, and I will go straight at him as\r\nsoon as I get our men reclothed and our wagons reloaded.\r\n\r\nKeep everybody busy, and let Stoneman push toward Greensboro' or\r\nCharlotte from Knoxville; even a feint in that quarter will be most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThe railroad from Charlotte to Danville is all that is left to the\r\nenemy, and it will not do for me to go there, on account of the\r\nred-clay hills which are impassable to wheels in wet weather.\r\n\r\nI expect to make a junction with General Schofield in ten days.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, IN THE FIELD,\r\nFAYETTVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, Sunday, March.  12, 1885.\r\n\r\nMajor-General TERRY, commanding United States Forces,\r\nWilmington, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have just received your message by the tug which left\r\nWilmington at 2 p.m.  yesterday, which arrived here without\r\ntrouble.  The scout who brought me your cipher-message started back\r\nlast night with my answers, which are superseded by the fact of\r\nyour opening the river.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard just reports that he has secured one of the enemy's\r\nsteamboats below the city, General Slocum will try to secure two\r\nothers known to be above, and we will load them with refugees\r\n(white and black) who have clung to our skirts, impeded our\r\nmovements, and consumed our food.\r\n\r\nWe have swept the country well from Savannah to here, and the men\r\nand animals are in fine condition.  Had it not been for the foul\r\nweather, I would have caught Hardee at Cheraw or here; but at\r\nColumbia, Cheraw, and here, we have captured immense stores, and\r\ndestroyed machinery, guns, ammunition, and property, of inestimable\r\nvalue to our enemy.  At all points he has fled from us, \"standing\r\nnot on the order of his going.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of South Carolina, instead of feeding Lee's army, will\r\nnow call on Lee to feed them.\r\n\r\nI want you to send me all the shoes, stockings, drawers, sugar,\r\ncoffee, and flour, you can spare; finish the loads with oats or\r\ncorn: Have the boats escorted, and let them run at night at any\r\nrisk.  We must not give time for Jos. Johnston to concentrate at\r\nGoldsboro'.  We cannot prevent his concentrating at Raleigh, but he\r\nshall have no rest. I want General Schofield to go on with his\r\nrailroad from Newbern as far as he can, and you should do the same\r\nfrom Wilmington.  If we can get the roads to and secure Goldsboro'\r\nby April 10th, it will be soon enough; but every day now is worth a\r\nmillion of dollars.  I can whip Jos. Johnston provided he does not\r\ncatch one of my corps in flank, and I will see that the army\r\nmarches hence to Goldsboro' in compact form.\r\n\r\nI must rid our army of from twenty to thirty thousand useless\r\nmouths; as many to go down Cape Fear as possible, and the rest to\r\ngo in vehicles or on captured horses via Clinton to Wilmington.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the energetic action that has marked your course,\r\nand shall be most happy to meet you.  I am, truly your friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\nIn quick succession I received other messages from General Terry,\r\nof older date, and therefore superseded by that brought by the tug\r\nDavidson, viz., by two naval officers, who had come up partly by\r\ncanoes and partly by land; General Terry had also sent the\r\nThirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry to search for us, under Colonel\r\nKerwin, who had dispatched Major Berks with fifty men, who reached\r\nus at Fayetteville; so that, by March 12th, I was in full\r\ncommunication with General Terry and the outside world.  Still, I\r\nwas anxious to reach Goldsboro', there to make junction with\r\nGeneral Schofield, so as to be ready for the next and last stage of\r\nthe war.  I then knew that my special antagonist, General Jos. E.\r\nJohnston, was back, with part of his old army; that he would not be\r\nmisled by feints and false reports, and would somehow compel me to\r\nexercise more caution than I had hitherto done.  I then\r\nover-estimated his force at thirty-seven thousand infantry,\r\nsupposed to be made up of S. D.  Lee's corps, four thousand;\r\nCheatham's, five thousand; Hoke's, eight thousand; Hardee's, ten\r\nthousand; and other detachments, ten thousand; with Hampton's,\r\nWheeler's, and Butler's cavalry, about eight thousand.  Of these,\r\nonly Hardee and the cavalry were immediately in our front, while\r\nthe bulk of Johnston's army was supposed to be collecting at or\r\nnear Raleigh.  I was determined, however, to give him as little\r\ntime for organization as possible, and accordingly crossed Cape\r\nFear River, with all the army, during the 13th and 14th, leaving\r\none division as a rearguard, until the arsenal could be completely\r\ndestroyed.  This was deliberately and completely leveled on the\r\n14th, when fire was applied to the wreck.  Little other damage was\r\ndone at Fayetteville.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th the tug Davidson again arrived from Wilmington, with\r\nGeneral Dodge, quartermaster, on board, reporting that there was no\r\nclothing to be had at Wilmington; but he brought up some sugar and\r\ncoffee, which were most welcome, and some oats.  He was followed by\r\na couple of gunboats, under command of Captain Young, United States\r\nNavy, who reached Fayetteville after I had left, and undertook to\r\npatrol the river as long as the stage of water would permit; and\r\nGeneral Dodge also promised to use the captured steamboats for a\r\nlike purpose.  Meantime, also, I had sent orders to General\r\nSchofield, at Newbern, and to General Terry, at Wilmington, to move\r\nwith their effective forces straight for Goldsboro', where I\r\nexpected to meet them by the 20th of March.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of March the whole army was across Cape Fear River, and\r\nat once began its march for Goldsboro'; the Seventeenth Corps still\r\non the right, the Fifteenth next in order, then the Fourteenth and\r\nTwentieth on the extreme left; the cavalry, acting in close concert\r\nwith the left flank.  With almost a certainty of being attacked on\r\nthis flank, I had instructed General Slocum to send his\r\ncorps-trains under strong escort by an interior road, holding four\r\ndivisions ready for immediate battle.  General Howard was in like\r\nmanner ordered to keep his trains well to his right, and to have\r\nfour divisions unencumbered, about six miles ahead of General\r\nSlocum, within easy support.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I had dispatched by land to Wilmington a train of\r\nrefugees who had followed the army all the way from Columbia, South\r\nCarolina, under an escort of two hundred men, commanded by Major\r\nJohn A.  Winson (One Hundred and Sixteenth Illinois Infantry), so\r\nthat we were disencumbered, and prepared for instant battle on our\r\nleft and exposed flank.\r\n\r\nIn person I accompanied General Slocum, and during the night of\r\nMarch 15th was thirteen miles out on the Raleigh road.  This flank\r\nfollowed substantially a road along Cape Fear River north,\r\nencountered pretty stubborn resistance by Hardee's infantry,\r\nartillery, and cavalry, and the ground favored our enemy; for the\r\ndeep river, Cape Fear, was on his right, and North River on his\r\nleft, forcing us to attack him square in front.  I proposed to\r\ndrive Hardee well beyond Averysboro', and then to turn to the right\r\nby Bentonville for Goldsboro'.  During the day it rained very\r\nhard, and I had taken refuge in an old cooper-shop, where a\r\nprisoner of war was brought to me (sent back from the skirmish-line\r\nby General Kilpatrick), who proved to be Colonel Albert Rhett,\r\nformer commander of Fort Sumter.  He was a tall, slender, and\r\nhandsome young man, dressed in the most approved rebel uniform,\r\nwith high jackboots beautifully stitched, and was dreadfully\r\nmortified to find himself a prisoner in our hands.  General Frank\r\nBlair happened to be with me at the moment, and we were much amused\r\nat Rhett's outspoken disgust at having been captured without a\r\nfight.  He said he was a brigade commander, and that his brigade\r\nthat day was Hardee's rear-guard; that his command was composed\r\nmostly of the recent garrisons of the batteries of Charleston\r\nHarbor, and had little experience in woodcraft; that he was giving\r\nground to us as fast as Hardee's army to his rear moved back, and\r\nduring this operation he was with a single aide in the woods, and\r\nwas captured by two men of Kilpatrick's skirmish-line that was\r\nfollowing up his retrograde movement.  These men called on him to\r\nsurrender, and ordered him, in language more forcible than polite,\r\nto turn and ride back.  He first supposed these men to be of\r\nHampton's cavalry, and threatened to report them to General Hampton\r\nfor disrespectful language; but he was soon undeceived, and was\r\nconducted to Kilpatrick, who sent him back to General Slocum's\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nThe rain was falling heavily, and, our wagons coming up, we went\r\ninto camp there, and had Rhett and General Blair to take supper\r\nwith us, and our conversation was full and quite interesting.  In\r\ndue time, however, Rhett was passed over by General Slocum to his\r\nprovost-guard, with orders to be treated with due respect,--and was\r\nfurnished with a horse to ride.\r\n\r\nThe next day (the 16th) the opposition continued stubborn, and near\r\nAverysboro' Hardee had taken up a strong position, before which\r\nGeneral Slocum deployed Jackson's division (of the Twentieth\r\nCorps), with part of Ward's.  Kilpatrick was on his right front.\r\nComing up, I advised that a brigade should make a wide circuit by\r\nthe left, and, if possible, catch this line in flank.  The movement\r\nwas completely successful, the first line of the enemy was swept\r\naway, and we captured the larger part of Rhett's brigade, two\r\nhundred and seventeen men, including Captain Macbeth's battery of\r\nthree guns, and buried one hundred and eight dead.\r\n\r\nThe deployed lines (Ward's and Jackson's) pressed on, and found\r\nHardee again intrenched; but the next morning he was gone, in full\r\nretreat toward Smithfield.  In this action, called the battle of\r\nAverysboro', we lost twelve officers and sixty-five men killed, and\r\nfour hundred and seventy-seven men wounded; a serious loss, because\r\nevery wounded man had to be carried in an ambulance.  The rebel\r\nwounded (sixty-eight) were carried to a house near by, all surgical\r\noperations necessary were performed by our surgeons, and then these\r\nwounded men were left in care of an officer and four men of the\r\nrebel prisoners, with a scanty supply of food, which was the best\r\nwe could do for them.  In person I visited this house while the\r\nsurgeons were at work, with arms and legs lying around loose, in\r\nthe yard and on the porch; and in a room on a bed lay a pale,\r\nhandsome young fellow, whose left arm had just been cut off near\r\nthe shoulder.  Some one used my name, when he asked, in a feeble\r\nvoice, if I were General Sherman.  He then announced himself as\r\nCaptain Macbeth, whose battery had just been captured; and said\r\nthat he remembered me when I used to visit his father's house, in\r\nCharleston.  I inquired about his family, and enabled him to write\r\na note to his mother, which was sent her afterward from Goldsboro'.\r\nI have seen that same young gentleman since in St. Louis, where he\r\nwas a clerk in an insurance-office.\r\n\r\nWhile the battle of Averysboro' was in progress, and I was sitting\r\non my horse, I was approached by a man on foot, without shoes or\r\ncoat, and his head bandaged by a handkerchief.  He announced\r\nhimself as the Captain Duncan who had been captured by Wade Hampton\r\nin Fayetteville, but had escaped; and, on my inquiring how he\r\nhappened to be in that plight, he explained that when he was a\r\nprisoner Wade Hampton's men had made him \"get out of his coat, hat,\r\nand shoes,\" which they appropriated to themselves.  He said Wade\r\nHampton had seen them do it, and he had appealed to him personally\r\nfor protection, as an officer, but Hampton answered him with a\r\ncurse.  I sent Duncan to General Kilpatrick, and heard afterward\r\nthat Kilpatrick had applied to General Slocum for his prisoner,\r\nColonel Rhett, whom he made march on foot the rest of the way to\r\nGoldsboro', in retaliation.  There was a story afloat that\r\nKilpatrick made him get out of those fine boots, but restored them\r\nbecause none of his own officers had feet delicate enough to wear\r\nthem.  Of course, I know nothing of this personally, and have never\r\nseen Rhett since that night by the cooper-shop; and suppose that he\r\nis the editor who recently fought a duel in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nFrom Averysboro' the left wing turned east, toward Goldsboro', the\r\nFourteenth Corps leading.  I remained with this wing until the\r\nnight of the 18th, when we were within twenty-seven miles of\r\nGoldsboro' and five from Bentonsville; and, supposing that all\r\ndanger was over, I crossed over to join Howard's column, to the\r\nright, so as to be nearer to Generals Schofield and Terry, known to\r\nbe approaching Goldsboro'.  I overtook General Howard at\r\nFalling-Creek Church, and found his column well drawn out, by reason\r\nof the bad roads.  I had heard some cannonading over about Slocum's\r\nhead of column, and supposed it to indicate about the same measure of\r\nopposition by Hardee's troops and Hampton's cavalry before\r\nexperienced; but during the day a messenger overtook me, and notified\r\nme that near Bentonsville General Slocum had run up against\r\nJohnston's whole army.  I sent back orders for him to fight\r\ndefensively to save time, and that I would come up with\r\nreenforcements from the direction of Cog's Bridge, by the road which\r\nwe had reached near Falling-Creek Church.  The country was very\r\nobscure, and the maps extremely defective.\r\n\r\nBy this movement I hoped General Slocum would hold Johnston's army\r\nfacing west, while I would come on his rear from the east. The\r\nFifteenth Corps, less one division (Hazen's), still well to the\r\nrear, was turned at once toward Bentonsville; Hazen's division was\r\nordered to Slocum's flank, and orders were also sent for General\r\nBlair, with the Seventeenth Corps, to come to the same destination.\r\nMeantime the sound of cannon came from the direction of\r\nBentonsville.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 19th caught us near Falling-Creek Church; but\r\nearly the next morning the Fifteenth Corps, General C. R. Woods's\r\ndivision leading, closed down on Bentonsville, near which it was\r\nbrought up by encountering a line of fresh parapet, crossing the\r\nroad and extending north, toward Mill Creek.\r\n\r\nAfter deploying, I ordered General Howard to proceed with due\r\ncaution, using skirmishers alone, till he had made junction with\r\nGeneral Slocum, on his left.  These deployments occupied all day,\r\nduring which two divisions of the Seventeenth Corps also got up.\r\nAt that time General Johnston's army occupied the form of a V, the\r\nangle reaching the road leading from Averysboro' to Goldsboro', and\r\nthe flanks resting on Mill Creek, his lines embracing the village\r\nof Bentonsville.\r\n\r\nGeneral Slocum's wing faced one of these lines and General Howard's\r\nthe other; and, in the uncertainty of General Johnston's strength,\r\nI did not feel disposed to invite a general battle, for we had been\r\nout from Savannah since the latter part of January, and our\r\nwagon-trains contained but little food.  I had also received messages\r\nduring the day from General Schofield, at Kinston, and General\r\nTerry, at Faison's Depot, approaching Goldsboro', both expecting to\r\nreach it by March 21st.  During the 20th we simply held our ground\r\nand started our trains back to Kinston for provisions, which would\r\nbe needed in the event of being forced to fight a general battle at\r\nBentonsville.  The next day (21st) it began to rain again, and we\r\nremained quiet till about noon, when General Mower, ever rash,\r\nbroke through the rebel line on his extreme left flank, and was\r\npushing straight for Bentonsville and the bridge across Mill Creek.\r\nI ordered him back to connect with his own corps; and, lest the\r\nenemy should concentrate on him, ordered the whole rebel line to be\r\nengaged with a strong skirmish-fire.\r\n\r\nI think I made a mistake there, and should rapidly have followed\r\nMower's lead with the whole of the right wing, which would have\r\nbrought on a general battle, and it could not have resulted\r\notherwise than successfully to us, by reason of our vastly superior\r\nnumbers; but at the moment, for the reasons given, I preferred to\r\nmake junction with Generals Terry and Schofield, before engaging\r\nJohnston's army, the strength of which was utterly unknown.  The\r\nnext day he was gone, and had retreated on Smithfield; and, the\r\nroads all being clear, our army moved to Goldsboro'.  The heaviest\r\nfighting at Bentonsville was on the first day, viz., the 19th, when\r\nJohnston's army struck the head of Slocum's columns, knocking back\r\nCarlin's division; but, as soon as General Slocum had brought up\r\nthe rest of the Fourteenth Corps into line, and afterward the\r\nTwentieth on its left, he received and repulsed all attacks, and\r\nheld his ground as ordered, to await the coming back of the right\r\nwing.  His loss, as reported, was nine officers and one hundred and\r\nforty-five men killed, eight hundred and sixteen wounded, and two\r\nhundred and twenty-six missing.  He reported having buried of the\r\nrebel dead one hundred and sixty-seven, and captured three hundred\r\nand thirty-eight prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the right wing was two officers and thirty-five men\r\nkilled, twelve officers and two hundred and eighty-nine men\r\nwounded, and seventy missing.  General Howard reported that he had\r\nburied one hundred of the rebel dead, and had captured twelve\r\nhundred and eighty-seven prisoners.\r\n\r\nOur total loss, therefore, at Bentonsville was: 1,604\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston, in his \"Narrative\" (p. 392), asserts that his\r\nentire force at Bentonsville, omitting Wheeler's and Butler's\r\ncavalry, only amounted to fourteen thousand one hundred infantry\r\nand artillery; and (p. 393) states his losses as: 2,343\r\n\r\n\r\nWide discrepancies exist in these figures: for instance, General\r\nSlocum accounts for three hundred and thirty-eight prisoners\r\ncaptured, and General Howard for twelve hundred and eighty-seven,\r\nmaking sixteen hundred and twenty-five in all, to Johnston's six\r\nhundred and fifty three--a difference of eight hundred and\r\nseventy-two.  I have always accorded to General Johnston due credit\r\nfor boldness in his attack on our exposed flank at Bentonville,\r\nbut I think he understates his strength, and doubt whether at the\r\ntime he had accurate returns from his miscellaneous army, collected\r\nfrom Hoke, Bragg, Hardee, Lee, etc.  After the first attack on\r\nCarlin's division, I doubt if the fighting was as desperate as\r\ndescribed by him, p. 385, et seq.  I was close up with the\r\nFifteenth Corps, on the 20th and 21st, considered the fighting as\r\nmere skirmishing, and know that my orders were to avoid a general\r\nbattle, till we could be sure of Goldsboro', and of opening up a\r\nnew base of supply.  With the knowledge now possessed of his small\r\nforce, of course I committed an error in not overwhelming\r\nJohnston's army on the 21st of March, 1865.  But I was content then\r\nto let him go, and on the 22d of March rode to Cog's Bridge, where\r\nI met General Terry, with his two divisions of the Tenth Corps; and\r\nthe next day we rode into Goldsboro', where I found General\r\nSchofield with the Twenty-third Corps, thus effecting a perfect\r\njunction of all the army at that point, as originally contemplated.\r\nDuring the 23d and 24th the whole army was assembled at Goldsboro';\r\nGeneral Terry's two divisions encamped at Faison's Depot to the\r\nsouth, and General Kilpatrick's cavalry at Mount Olive Station,\r\nnear him, and there we all rested, while I directed my special\r\nattention to replenishing the army for the next and last stage of\r\nthe campaign.  Colonel W. W. Wright had been so indefatigable, that\r\nthe Newbern Railroad was done, and a locomotive arrived in\r\nGoldsboro' on the 25th of March.\r\n\r\nThus was concluded one of the longest and most important marches\r\never made by an organized army in a civilized country.  The\r\ndistance from Savannah to Goldsboro' is four hundred and\r\ntwenty-five miles, and the route traversed embraced five large\r\nnavigable rivers, viz., the Edisto, Broad, Catawba, Pedee, and Cape\r\nFear, at either of which a comparatively small force, well-handled,\r\nshould have made the passage most difficult, if not impossible.\r\nThe country generally was in a state of nature, with innumerable\r\nswamps, with simply mud roads, nearly every mile of which had to be\r\ncorduroyed.  In our route we had captured Columbia, Cheraw, and\r\nFayetteville, important cities and depots of supplies, had\r\ncompelled the evacuation of Charleston City and Harbor, had utterly\r\nbroken up all the railroads of South Carolina, and had consumed a\r\nvast amount of food and forage, essential to the enemy for the\r\nsupport of his own armies.  We had in mid-winter accomplished the\r\nwhole journey of four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days,\r\naveraging ten miles per day, allowing ten lay-days, and had reached\r\nGoldsboro' with the army in superb order, and the trains almost as\r\nfresh as when we had started from Atlanta.\r\n\r\nIt was manifest to me that we could resume our march, and come\r\nwithin the theatre of General Grant's field of operations in all\r\nApril, and that there was no force in existence that could delay\r\nour progress, unless General Lee should succeed in eluding General\r\nGrant at Petersburg, make junction with General Johnston, and thus\r\nunited meet me alone; and now that we had effected a junction with\r\nGenerals Terry and Schofield, I had no fear even of that event.  On\r\nreaching Goldsboro, I learned from General Schofield all the\r\ndetails of his operations about Wilmington and Newbern; also of the\r\nfight of the Twenty-third Corps about Kinston, with General Bragg.\r\nI also found Lieutenant Dunn, of General Grant's staff, awaiting\r\nme, with the general's letter of February 7th, covering\r\ninstructions to Generals Schofield and Thomas; and his letter of\r\nMarch 16th, in answer to mine of the 12th, from Fayetteville.\r\n\r\nThese are all given here to explain the full reasons for the events\r\nof the war then in progress, with two or three letters from myself,\r\nto fill out the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, February 7, 1865\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Without much expectation of it reaching you in time to be\r\nof any service, I have mailed to you copies of instructions to\r\nSchofield and Thomas.  I had informed Schofield by telegraph of the\r\ndeparture of Mahone's division, south from the Petersburg front.\r\nThese troops marched down the Weldon road, and, as they apparently\r\nwent without baggage, it is doubtful whether they have not\r\nreturned.  I was absent from here when they left.  Just returned\r\nyesterday morning from Cape Fear River.  I went there to determine\r\nwhere Schofield's corps had better go to operate against Wilmington\r\nand Goldsboro'.  The instructions with this will inform you of the\r\nconclusion arrived at.\r\n\r\nSchofield was with me, and the plan of the movement against\r\nWilmington fully determined before we started back; hence the\r\nabsence of more detailed instructions to him.  He will land one\r\ndivision at Smithville, and move rapidly up the south side of the\r\nriver, and secure the Wilmington & Charlotte Railroad, and with his\r\npontoon train cross over to the island south of the city, if he\r\ncan.  With the aid of the gunboats, there is no doubt but this move\r\nwill drive the enemy from their position eight miles east of the\r\ncity, either back to their line or away altogether.  There will be\r\na large force on the north bank of Cape Fear River, ready to follow\r\nup and invest the garrison, if they should go inside.\r\n\r\nThe railroads of North Carolina are four feet eight and one-half\r\ninches gauge.  I have sent large parties of railroad-men there to\r\nbuild them up, and have ordered stock to run them.  We have\r\nabundance of it idle from the non-use of the Virginia roads.  I\r\nhave taken every precaution to have supplies ready for you wherever\r\nyou may turn up.  I did this before when you left Atlanta, and\r\nregret that they did not reach you promptly when you reached\r\nsalt-water....\r\n\r\nAlexander Stephens, R. M. T. Hunter, and Judge Campbell, are now at\r\nmy headquarters, very desirous of going to Washington to see Mr.\r\nLincoln, informally, on the subject of peace.  The peace feeling\r\nwithin the rebel lines is gaining ground rapidly.  This, however,\r\nshould not relax our energies in the least, but should stimulate us\r\nto greater activity.\r\n\r\nI have received your very kind letters, in which you say you would\r\ndecline, or are opposed to, promotion.  No one world be more\r\npleased at your advancement than I, and if you should be placed in\r\nmy position, and I put subordinate, it would not change our\r\npersonal relations in the least. I would make the same exertions to\r\nsupport you that you have ever done to support me, and would do all\r\nin my power to make our cause win.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, January 81, 1865.\r\n\r\nMajor-General G. H. THOMAS, commanding Army of the Cumberland.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: With this I send you a letter from General Sherman.  At\r\nthe time of writing it, General Sherman was not informed of the\r\ndepletion of your command by my orders.  It will, be impossible at\r\npresent for you to move south as he contemplated, with the force of\r\ninfantry indicated.  General Slocum is advised before this of the\r\nchanges made, and that for the winter you will be on the defensive.\r\nI think, however, an expedition from East Tennessee, under General\r\nStoneman might penetrate South Carolina, well down toward Columbia,\r\ndestroying the railroad and military resources of the country, thus\r\nvisiting a portion of the State which will not be reached by\r\nSherman's forces.  He might also be able to return to East\r\nTennessee by way of Salisbury, North Carolina, thus releasing home\r\nour prisoners of war in rebel hands.\r\n\r\nOf the practicability of doing this, General Stoneman will have to\r\nbe the judge, making up his mind from information obtained while\r\nexecuting the first part of his instructions.  Sherman's movements\r\nwill attract the attention of all the force the enemy can collect,\r\nthus facilitating the execution of this.\r\n\r\nThree thousand cavalry would be a sufficient force to take.  This\r\nprobably can be raised in the old Department of the Ohio, without\r\ntaking any now under General Wilson.  It would require, though, the\r\nreorganization of the two regiments of Kentucky Cavalry, which\r\nStoneman had in his very successful raid into Southwestern\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary, probably, for you to send, in addition to the\r\nforce now in East Tennessee, a small division of infantry, to\r\nenable General Gillem to hold the upper end of Holston Valley, and\r\nthe mountain-passes in rear of Stevenson.\r\n\r\nYou may order such an expedition.  To save time, I will send a copy\r\nof this to General Stoneman, so that he can begin his preparations\r\nwithout loss of time, and can commence his correspondence with you\r\nas to these preparations.\r\n\r\nAs this expedition goes to destroy and not to fight battles, but to\r\navoid them when practicable, particularly against any thing like\r\nequal forces, or where a great object is to be gained, it should go\r\nas light as possible.  Stoneman's experience, in raiding will teach\r\nhim in this matter better than he can be directed.\r\n\r\nLet there be no delay in the preparations for this expedition, and\r\nkeep me advised of its progress.  Very respectfully, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, January 81, 1865.\r\n\r\nMajor-General J. M. SCHOFIELD, commanding army of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have requested by telegraph that, for present purposes,\r\nNorth Carolina be erected into a department, and that you be placed\r\nin command of it, subject to Major-General Sherman's orders.  Of\r\ncourse, you will receive orders from me direct until such time as\r\nGeneral Sherman gets within communicating distance of you.  This\r\nobviates the necessity of my publishing the order which I informed\r\nyou would meet you at Fortress Monroe.  If the order referred to\r\nshould not be published from the Adjutant-General's office, you\r\nwill read these instructions as your authority to assume command of\r\nall the troops in North Carolina, dating all official\r\ncommunications, \"Headquarters Army of the Ohio.\"  Your headquarters\r\nwill be in the field, and with the portion of the army where you\r\nfeel yourself most needed.  In the first move you will go to Cape\r\nFear River.\r\n\r\nYour movements are intended as cooperative with Sherman's movement\r\nthrough the States of South and North Carolina.  The first point to\r\nbe obtained is to secure Wilmington.  Goldsboro' will then be your\r\nobjective point, moving either from Wilmington or Newbern, or both,\r\nas you may deem best. Should you not be able to reach Goldsboro',\r\nyou will advance on the line or lines of railway connecting that\r\nplace with the sea-coast, as near to it as you can, building the\r\nroad behind you.  The enterprise under you has two objects: the\r\nfirst is, to give General Sherman material aid, if needed, in his\r\nmarch north; the second, to open a base of supplies for him on the\r\nline of his march.  As soon, therefore, as you can determine which\r\nof the two points, Wilmington or Newbern, you can best use for\r\nthrowing supplies from to the interior, you will commence the\r\naccumulation of twenty days rations and forage for sixty thousand\r\nmen and twenty thousand animals.  You will get of these as many as\r\nyou can house and protect, to such point in the interior as you may\r\nbe able to occupy.\r\n\r\nI believe General Innis N. Palmer has received some instructions\r\ndirectly from General Sherman, on the subject of securing supplies\r\nfor his army.  You can learn what steps he has taken, and be\r\ngoverned in your requisitions accordingly.  A supply of\r\nordnance-stores will also be necessary.\r\n\r\nMake all your requisitions upon the chiefs of their respective\r\ndepartments, in the field, with me at City Point.  Communicate with\r\nme by every opportunity, and, should you deem it necessary at any\r\ntime, send a special boat to Fortress Monroe, from which point you\r\ncan communicate by telegraph.\r\n\r\nThe supplies referred to in these instructions are exclusive of\r\nthose required by your own command.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the enemy may justify you, or even make it your\r\nimperative duty, to cut loose from your base and strike for the\r\ninterior, to aid Sherman.  In such case you will act on your own\r\njudgment, without waiting for instructions.  You will report,\r\nhowever, what you propose doing.  The details for carrying out\r\nthese instructions are necessarily left to you.  I would urge,\r\nhowever, if I did not know that you are already fully alive to the\r\nimportance of it, prompt action.  Sherman may be looked for in the\r\nneighborhood of Goldsboro' any time from the 22d to the 28th of\r\nFebruary.  This limits your time very materially.\r\n\r\nIf rolling-stock is not secured in the capture of Wilmington, it\r\ncan be supplied from Washington: A large force of railroad-men has\r\nalready been sent to Beaufort, and other mechanics will go to Fort\r\nFisher in a day or two.  On this point I have informed you by\r\ntelegraph.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 16, 1865.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your interesting letter of the 12th inst. is just\r\nreceived.  I have never felt any uneasiness for your safety, but I\r\nhave felt great anxiety to know just how you were progressing.  I\r\nknew, or thought I did, that, with the magnificent army with you,\r\nyou would come out safely somewhere.\r\n\r\nTo secure certain success, I deemed the capture of Wilmington of\r\nthe greatest importance.  Butler came near losing that prize to us.\r\nBut Terry and Schofield have since retrieved his blunders, and I do\r\nnot know but the first failure has been as valuable a success for\r\nthe country as the capture of Fort Fisher.  Butler may not see it\r\nin that light.\r\n\r\nEver since you started on the last campaign, and before, I have\r\nbeen attempting to get something done in the West, both to\r\ncooperate with you and to take advantage of the enemy's weakness\r\nthere--to accomplish results favorable to us.  Knowing Thomas to be\r\nslow beyond excuse, I depleted his army to reinforce Canby, so that\r\nhe might act from Mobile Bay on the interior.  With all I have\r\nsaid, he has not moved at last advices.  Canby was sending a\r\ncavalry force, of about seven thousand, from Vicksburg toward\r\nSelma.  I ordered Thomas to send Wilson from Eastport toward the\r\nsame point, and to get him off as soon after the 20th of February\r\nas possible.  He telegraphed me that he would be off by that date.\r\nHe has not yet started, or had not at last advices.  I ordered him\r\nto send Stoneman from East Tennessee into Northwest South Carolina,\r\nto be there about the time you would reach Columbia.  He would\r\neither have drawn off the enemy's cavalry from you, or would have\r\nsucceeded in destroying railroads, supplies, and other material,\r\nwhich you could not reach.  At that time the Richmond papers were\r\nfull of the accounts of your movements, and gave daily accounts of\r\nmovements in West North Carolina.  I supposed all the time it was\r\nStoneman.  You may judge my surprise when I afterward learned that\r\nStoneman was still in Louisville, Kentucky, and that the troops in\r\nNorth Carolina were Kirk's forces!  In order that Stoneman might\r\nget off without delay, I told Thomas that three thousand men would\r\nbe sufficient for him to take.  In the mean time I had directed\r\nSheridan to get his cavalry ready, and, as soon as the snow in the\r\nmountains melted sufficiently, to start for Staunton, and go on and\r\ndestroy the Virginia Central Railroad and canal.  Time advanced,\r\nuntil he set the 28th of February for starting.  I informed Thomas,\r\nand directed him to change the course of Stoneman toward Lynchburg,\r\nto destroy the road in Virginia up as near to that place as\r\npossible.  Not hearing from Thomas, I telegraphed to him about the\r\n12th, to know if Stoneman was yet off.  He replied not, but that he\r\n(Thomas) would start that day for Knoxville, to get him off as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nSheridan has made his raid, and with splendid success, so far as\r\nheard.  I am looking for him at \"White House\" to-day.  Since about\r\nthe 20th of last month the Richmond papers have been prohibited\r\nfrom publishing accounts of army movements.  We are left to our own\r\nresources, therefore, for information.  You will see from the\r\npapers what Sheridan has done; if you do not, the officer who bears\r\nthis will tell you all.\r\n\r\nLee has depleted his army but very little recently, and I learn of\r\nnone going south.  Some regiments may have been detached, but I\r\nthink no division or brigade.  The determination seems to be to\r\nhold Richmond as long as possible.  I have a force sufficient to\r\nleave enough to hold our lines (all that is necessary of them), and\r\nmove out with plenty to whip his whole army.  But the roads are\r\nentirely impassable.  Until they improve, I shall content myself\r\nwith watching Lee, and be prepared to pitch into him if he attempts\r\nto evacuate the place.  I may bring Sheridan over--think I will\r\n--and break up the Danville and Southside Railroads.  These are the\r\nlast avenues left to the enemy.\r\n\r\nRecruits have come in so rapidly at the West that Thomas has now\r\nabout as much force as he had when he attacked Hood.  I have\r\nstopped all who, under previous orders, would go to him, except\r\nthose from Illinois.\r\n\r\nFearing the possibility of the enemy falling back to Lynchburg, and\r\nafterward attempting to go into East Tennessee or Kentucky, I have\r\nordered Thomas to move the Fourth Corps to Bull's Gap, and to\r\nfortify there, and to hold out to the Virginia line, if he can.  He\r\nhas accumulated a large amount of supplies in Knoxville, and has\r\nbeen ordered not to destroy any of the railroad west of the\r\nVirginia Hue.  I told him to get ready for a campaign toward\r\nLynchburg, if it became necessary.  He never can make one there or\r\nelsewhere; but the steps taken will prepare for any one else to\r\ntake his troops and come east or go toward Rome, whichever may be\r\nnecessary.  I do not believe either will.\r\n\r\nWhen I hear that you and Schofield are together, with your back\r\nupon the coast, I shall feel that you are entirely safe against any\r\nthing the enemy can do.  Lee may evacuate Richmond, but he cannot\r\nget there with force enough to touch you.  His army is now\r\ndemoralized and deserting very fast, both to us and to their homes.\r\nA retrograde movement would cost him thousands of men, even if we\r\ndid not follow.\r\n\r\nFive thousand men, belonging to the corps with you, are now on\r\ntheir way to join you.  If more reenforcements are necessary, I\r\nwill send them.  My notion is, that you should get Raleigh as soon\r\nas possible, and hold the railroad from there back.  This may take\r\nmore force than you now have.\r\n\r\nFrom that point all North Carolina roads can be made useless to the\r\nenemy, without keeping up communications with the rear.\r\n\r\nHoping to hear soon of your junction with the forces from\r\nWilmington and Newborn, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI IN THE FIELD,\r\nCOX'S BRIGADE, NEUSE RIVER, NORTH CAROLINA, March 22, 1865\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, Commander-in-Chief, City Point,\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I wrote you from Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Tuesday,\r\nthe 14th instant, that I was all ready to start for Goldsboro', to\r\nwhich point I had also ordered General Schofield, from Newborn, and\r\nGeneral Terry, from Wilmington.  I knew that General Jos. Johnston\r\nwas supreme in command against me, and that he would have time to\r\nconcentrate a respectable army to oppose the last stage of this\r\nmarch.  Accordingly, General Slocum was ordered to send his main\r\nsupply-train, under escort of two divisions, straight for\r\nBentonsville, while he, with his other four divisions,\r\ndisencumbered of all unnecessary wagons, should march toward\r\nRaleigh, by way of threat, as far as Averysboro'.  General Howard,\r\nin like manner, sent his trains with the Seventeenth Corps, well to\r\nthe right, and, with the four divisions of the Fifteenth Corps,\r\ntook roads which would enable him to come promptly to the exposed\r\nleft flank.  We started on the 16th, but again the rains set in,\r\nand the roads, already bad enough, became horrible.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 16th, General Slocum found Hardee's army, from\r\nCharleston, which had retreated before us from Cheraw, in position\r\nacross the narrow, swampy neck between Cape Fear and North Rivers,\r\nwhere the road branches off to Goldsboro'.  There a pretty severe\r\nfight occurred, in which General Slocum's troops carried handsomely\r\nthe advanced line, held by a South Carolina brigade, commanded by a\r\nColonel Butler.  Its Commander, Colonel Rhett, of Fort Sumter\r\nnotoriety, with one of his staff, had the night before been\r\ncaptured, by Kilpatrick's scouts, from his very skirmish-line.  The\r\nnext morning Hardee was found gone, and was pursued through and\r\nbeyond Averysboro'.  General Slocum buried one hundred and eight\r\ndead rebels, and captured and destroyed three guns.  Some eighty\r\nwounded rebels were left in our hands, and, after dressing their\r\nwounds, we left them in a house, attended by a Confederate officer\r\nand four privates, detailed out of our prisoners and paroled for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nWe resumed the march toward Goldsboro'.  I was with the left wing\r\nuntil I supposed all danger had passed; but, when General Slocum's\r\nhead of column was within four miles of Bentonsville, after\r\nskirmishing as usual with cavalry, he became aware that there was\r\ninfantry in his front.  He deployed a couple of brigades, which, on\r\nadvancing, sustained a partial repulse, but soon rallied, when he\r\nformed a line of the two leading divisions (Morgan's and Carlin's)\r\nof Jeff. C. Davis's corps.  The enemy attacked these with violence,\r\nbut was repulsed.  This was in the forenoon of Sunday, the 19th.\r\nGeneral Slocum brought forward the two divisions of the Twentieth\r\nCorps, hastily disposed of them for defense, and General Kilpatrick\r\nmassed his cavalry on the left.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jos. Johnston had, the night before, marched his whole army\r\n(Bragg, Cheatham, S. D. Lee, Hardee, and all the troops he had\r\ndrawn from every quarter), determined, as he told his men, to crash\r\none of our corps, and then defeat us in detail.  He attacked\r\nGeneral Slocum in position from 3 P. M.  on the 19th till dark; but\r\nwas everywhere repulsed, and lost heavily.  At the time, I was with\r\nthe Fifteenth Corps, marching on a road more to the right; but, on\r\nhearing of General Slocum's danger, directed that corps toward\r\nCox's Bridge, in the night brought Blair's corps over, and on the\r\n20th marched rapidly on Johnston's flank and rear.  We struck him\r\nabout noon, forced him to assume the defensive, and to fortify.\r\nYesterday we pushed him hard, and came very near crushing him, the\r\nright division of the Seventeenth Corps (Mower's) having broken in\r\nto within a hundred yards of where Johnston himself was, at the\r\nbridge across Mill Creek.  Last night he retreated, leaving us in\r\npossession of the field, dead, and wounded.  We have over two\r\nthousand prisoners from this affair and the one at Averysboro', and\r\nI am satisfied that Johnston's army was so roughly handled\r\nyesterday that we could march right on to Raleigh; but we have now\r\nbeen out six weeks, living precariously upon the collections of our\r\nforagers, our men dirty, ragged, and saucy, and we must rest and\r\nfix up a little.  Our entire losses thus far (killed, wounded, and\r\nprisoners) will be covered by twenty-five hundred, a great part of\r\nwhich are, as usual, slight wounds.  The enemy has lost more than\r\ndouble as many, and we have in prisoners alone full two thousand.\r\n\r\nI limited the pursuit, this morning, to Mill Creek, and will\r\nforthwith march the army to Goldsboro', there to rest, reclothe,\r\nand get some rations.\r\n\r\nOur combinations were such that General Schofield entered\r\nGoldsboro' from Newborn; General Terry got Cox's Bridge, with\r\npontoons laid, and a brigade across Neuse River intrenched; and we\r\nwhipped Jos. Johnston--all on the same day.\r\n\r\nAfter riding over the field of battle to-day, near Bentonsville,\r\nand making the necessary orders, I have ridden down to this place\r\n(Cox's Bridge) to see General Terry, and to-morrow shall ride into\r\nGoldsboro.\r\n\r\nI propose to collect there my army proper; shall post General Terry\r\nabout Faison's Depot, and General Schofield about Kinston, partly\r\nto protect the road, but more to collect such food and forage as\r\nthe country affords, until the railroads are repaired leading into\r\nGoldsboro'.\r\n\r\nI fear these have not been pushed with the vigor I had expected;\r\nbut I will soon have them both going.  I shall proceed at once to\r\norganize three armies of twenty-five thousand men each, and will\r\ntry and be all ready to march to Raleigh or Weldon, as we may\r\ndetermine, by or before April 10th.\r\n\r\nI inclose you a copy of my orders of to-day.  I would like to be\r\nmore specific, but have not the data.  We have lost no general\r\nofficers nor any organization.  General Slocum took three guns at\r\nAverysboro', and lost three others at the first dash on him at\r\nBentonsville.  We have all our wagons and trains in good order.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI IN THE FIELD,\r\nCOX'S BRIGADE, GOLDSBORO', NORTH CAROLINA, March 23, 1865.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, commanding the Armies of the United\r\nStates, City Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:  On reaching Goldsboro' this morning, I found Lieutenant\r\nDunn awaiting me with your letter of March 18th and dispatch of the\r\n17th.  I wrote you fully from Cox's Bridge yesterday, and since\r\nreaching Goldsboro' have learned that my letter was sent punctually\r\nto Newborn, whence it will be dispatched to you.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear that General Sheridan did such good service\r\nbetween Richmond and Lynchburg, and hope he will keep the ball\r\nmoving, I know that these raids and dashes disconcert our enemy and\r\ndiscourage him much.\r\n\r\nGeneral Slocum's two corps (Fourteenth and Twentieth) are now\r\ncoming in.  I will dispose of them north of Goldsboro', between the\r\nWeldon road and Little River.  General Howard to-day is marching\r\nsouth of the Nenae, and to-morrow will come in and occupy ground\r\nnorth of Goldsboro', extending from the Weldon Railroad to that\r\nleading to Kinston.\r\n\r\nI have ordered all the provisional divisions, made up of troops\r\nbelonging to the regular corps, to be broken up, and the men to\r\njoin their proper regiments and organizations; and have ordered\r\nGeneral Schofield to guard the railroads back to Newborn and\r\nWilmington, and to make up a movable column equal to twenty-five\r\nthousand men, with which to take the field.  His army will be the\r\ncentre, as on the Atlanta campaign.  I do not think I want any more\r\ntroops (other than absentees and recruits) to fill up the present\r\nregiments, and I can make up an army of eighty thousand men by\r\nApril 10th.  I will post General Kilpatrick at Mount Olive Station\r\non the Wilmington road, and then allow the army some rest.\r\n\r\nWe have sent all our empty wagons, under escort, with the proper\r\nstaff-officers, to bring up from Kinston clothing and provisions.\r\nAs long as we move we can gather food and forage; but, the moment\r\nwe stop, trouble begins.\r\n\r\nI feel sadly disappointed that our railroads are not done.  I do\r\nnot like to say there has been any neglect until I make inquiries;\r\nbut it does seem to me the repairs should have been made ere this,\r\nand the road properly stocked.  I can only hear of one locomotive\r\n(besides the four old ones) on the Newbern road, and two damaged\r\nlocomotives (found by General Terry) on the Wilmington road.  I\r\nleft Generals Easton and Beckwith purposely to make arrangements in\r\nanticipation of my arrival, and have heard from neither, though I\r\nsuppose them both to be at Morehead City.\r\n\r\nAt all events, we have now made a junction of all the armies, and\r\nif we can maintain them, will, in a short time, be in a position to\r\nmarch against Raleigh, Gaston, Weldon, or even Richmond, as you may\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nIf I get the troops all well planed, and the supplies working well,\r\nI may run up to see you for a day or two before diving again into\r\nthe bowels of the country.\r\n\r\nI will make, in a very short time, accurate reports of our\r\noperations for the past two months.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI IN THE FIELD,\r\nCOX'S BRIGADE, GOLDSBORO', NORTH CAROLINA, March 24, 1865.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, City Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have kept Lieutenant Dunn over to-day that I might\r\nreport farther.  All the army is now in, save the cavalry (which I\r\nhave posted at Mount Olive Station, south of the Nenae) and General\r\nTerry's command (which--to-morrow will move from Cog's Ferry to\r\nFaison's Depot, also on the Wilmington road).  I send you a copy of\r\nmy orders of this morning, the operation of which will, I think,\r\nsoon complete our roads.  The telegraph is now done to Morehead\r\nCity, and by it I learn that stores have been sent to Kinston in\r\nboats, and that our wagons are loading with rations and clothing.\r\nBy using the Neuse as high up as Kinston, hauling from there\r\ntwenty-six miles, and by equipping the two roads to Morehead City\r\nand Wilmington, I feel certain we can not only feed and equip the\r\narmy, but in a short time fill our wagons for another start.  I\r\nfeel certain, from the character of the fighting, that we have got\r\nJohnston's army afraid of us.  He himself acts with timidity and\r\ncaution.  His cavalry alone manifests spirit, but limits its\r\noperations to our stragglers and foraging-parties.  My marching\r\ncolumns of infantry do not pay the cavalry any attention, but walk\r\nright through it.\r\n\r\nI think I see pretty clearly how, in one more move, we can\r\ncheckmate Lee, forcing him to unite Johnston with him in the defense\r\nof Richmond, or to abandon the cause.  I feel certain, if he leaves\r\nRichmond, Virginia leaves the Confederacy.  I will study my maps a\r\nlittle more before giving my positive views.  I want all possible\r\ninformation of the Roanoke as to navigability, how far up, and with\r\nwhat draught.\r\n\r\nWe find the country sandy, dry, with good roads, and more corn and\r\nforage than I had expected.  The families remain, but I will\r\ngradually push them all out to Raleigh or Wilmington.  We will need\r\nevery house in the town.  Lieutenant Dunn can tell you of many\r\nthings of which I need not write.  Yours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI IN THE FIELD,\r\nCOX'S BRIGADE, GOLDSBORO', NORTH CAROLINA, April 5,1865\r\n\r\nMajor-General George H. Thomas, commanding Department of the\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: I can hardly help smiling when I contemplate my\r\ncommand--it is decidedly mixed.  I believe, but am not certain,\r\nthat you are in my jurisdiction, but I certainly cannot help you in\r\nthe way of orders or men; nor do I think you need either.  General\r\nCruft has just arrived with his provisional division, which will at\r\nonce be broken up and the men sent to their proper regiments, as\r\nthat of Meagher was on my arrival here.\r\n\r\nYou may have some feeling about my asking that General Slocum\r\nshould have command of the two corps that properly belong to you,\r\nviz., the Fourteenth and Twentieth, but you can recall that he was\r\nbut a corps commander, and could not legally make orders of\r\ndischarge, transfer, etc., which was imperatively necessary.  I\r\ntherefore asked that General Slocum should be assigned to command\r\n\"an army in the field,\" called the Army of Georgia, composed of the\r\nFourteenth and Twentieth Corps.  The order is not yet made by the\r\nPresident, though I have recognized it because both, General Grant\r\nand the President have sanctioned it, and promised to have the\r\norder made.\r\n\r\nMy army is now here, pretty well clad and provided, divided into\r\nthree parts, of two corps each--much as our old Atlanta army was.\r\n\r\nI expect to move on in a few days, and propose (if Lee remains in\r\nRichmond) to pass the Roanoke, and open communication with the\r\nChowan and Norfolk.  This will bring me in direct communication\r\nwith General Grant.\r\n\r\nThis is an admirable point--country open, and the two railroads in\r\ngood order back to Wilmington and Beaufort.  We have already\r\nbrought up stores enough to fill our wagons, and only await some\r\nfew articles, and the arrival of some men who are marching up from\r\nthe coast, to be off.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant explained to me his orders to you, which, of course,\r\nare all right.  You can make reports direct to Washington or to\r\nGeneral Grant, but keep me advised occasionally of the general\r\nstate of affairs, that I may know what is happening.  I must give\r\nmy undivided attention to matters here.  You will hear from a\r\nthousand sources pretty fair accounts of our next march.  Yours\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[LETTER FROM ADMIRAL DAHLGREN]\r\n\r\nSOUTH ATLANTIC SQUADRON\r\nFLAG-SHIP PHILADELPHIA, CHARLESTON, April 20, 1865\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Armies of the Tennessee,\r\nGeorgia, and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nMr DEAR GENERAL: I was much gratified by a sight of your\r\nhandwriting, which has just reached me from Goldsboro'; it was very\r\nsuggestive of a past to me, when these regions were the scene of\r\nyour operations.\r\n\r\nAs you progressed through South Carolina, there was no\r\nmanifestation of weakness or of an intention to abandon Charleston,\r\nuntil within a few hours of the fact.  On the 11th of February I\r\nwas at Stono, and a spirited demonstration was made by General\r\nSchimmel-pfennig and the vessels.  He drove the rebels from their\r\nrifle-pits in front of the lines, extending from Fort Pringle, and\r\npushed them vigorously.  The next day I was at Bull's Bay, with a\r\ndozen steamers, among them the finest of the squadron.  General\r\nPotter had twelve to fifteen hundred men, the object being to carry\r\nout your views.  We made as much fuss as possible, and with better\r\nsuccess than I anticipated, for it seems that the rebs conceived\r\nStono to be a feint, and the real object at Bull's Bay, supposing,\r\nfrom the number of steamers and boats, that we had several thousand\r\nmen.  Now came an aide from General Gillmore, at Port Royal, with\r\nyour cipher-dispatch from Midway, so I steamed down to Port Royal\r\nto see him.  Next day was spent in vain efforts to decipher-finally\r\nit was accomplished.  You thought that the state of the roads might\r\nforce you to turn upon Charleston; so I went there on the 15th, but\r\nthere was no sign yet of flinching.  Then I went to Bull's Bay next\r\nday (16th), and found that the troops were not yet ashore, owing to\r\nthe difficulties of shoal water.  One of the gunboats had contrived\r\nto get up to within shelling range, and both soldiers and sailors\r\nwere working hard.  On the evening of the 18th I steamed down to\r\nStono to see how matters were going there.  Passing Charleston, I\r\nnoticed two large fires, well inside--probably preparing to leave.\r\nOn the 17th, in Stono, rumors were flying about loose of\r\nevacuation.  In course of the morning, General Schimmelpfennig\r\ntelegraphed me, from Morris Island, that there were symptoms of\r\nleaving; that he would again make a push at Stono, and asked for\r\nmonitors.  General Schimmelpfennig came down in the afternoon, and\r\nwe met in the Folly Branch, near Secessionville.  He was sore that\r\nthe rebs would be off that night, so he was to assault them in\r\nfront, while a monitor and gunboats stung their flanks both sides.\r\nI also sent an aide to order my battery of five eleven-inch guns,\r\nat Cumming's Point, to fire steadily all night on Sullivan's\r\nIsland, and two monitors to close up to the island for the same\r\nobject.  Next morning (18th) the rascals were found to be off, and\r\nwe broke in from all directions, by land and water.  The main\r\nbodies had left at eight or nine in the evening, leaving\r\ndetachments to keep up a fire from the batteries.  I steamed round\r\nquickly, and soon got into the city, threading the streets with a\r\nlarge group of naval captains who had joined me.  All was silent as\r\nthe grave.  No one to be seen but a few firemen.\r\n\r\nNo one can question the excellence of your judgment in taking the\r\ntrack you did, and I never had any misgivings, but it was natural\r\nto desire to go into the place with a strong hand, for, if any one\r\nspot in the land was foremost in the trouble, it was Charleston.\r\n\r\nYour campaign was the final blow, grand in conception, complete in\r\nexecution; and now it is yours to secure the last army which\r\nrebeldom possesses.  I hear of your being in motion by the 9th, and\r\nhope that the result may be all that you wish.\r\n\r\nTidings of the murder of the President have just come, and shocked\r\nevery mind.  Can it be that such a resort finds root in any stratum\r\nof American opinion?  Evidently it has not been the act of one man,\r\nnor of a madman.  Who have prompted him?\r\n\r\nI am grateful for your remembrance of my boy; the thought of him is\r\never nearest to my heart.  Generous, brave, and noble, as I ever\r\nknew him to be, that he should close his young life so early, even\r\nunder the accepted conditions of a soldier's life, as a son of the\r\nUnion, would have been grief sufficient for me to bear; but that\r\nhis precious remains should have been so treated by the brutes into\r\nwhose hands they fell, adds even to the bitterness of death.  I am\r\nnow awaiting the hour when I can pay my last duties to his memory.\r\n\r\nWith my best and sincere wishes, my dear general, for your success\r\nand happiness, I am, most truly, your friend,\r\n\r\nJ.

That at the hour of noon, on the 14th day of April,\r\n1885, Brevet Major-General Anderson will raise and plant upon the\r\nruins of Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, the same United States\r\nflag which floated over the battlements of that fort during the\r\nrebel assault, and which was lowered and saluted by him and the\r\nsmall force of his command when the works were evacuated on the\r\n14th day of April, 1861.\r\n\r\n2.  That the flag, when raised, be saluted by one hundred guns from\r\nFort Sumter, and by a national salute from every fort and rebel\r\nbattery that fired upon Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\n3.  That suitable ceremonies be had upon the occasion, under the\r\ndirection of Major-General William T. Sherman, whose military\r\noperations compelled the rebels to evacuate Charleston, or, in his\r\nabsence, under the charge of Major-General Q. A. Gilmore,\r\ncommanding the department.  Among the ceremonies will be the\r\ndelivery of a public address by the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher.\r\n\r\n4.  That the naval forces at Charleston, and their commander on\r\nthat station, be invited to participate in the ceremonies of the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President of the United States,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M.

A befitting celebration on\r\nthat day, in honor of its reoccupation by the national forces, has\r\nbeen ordered by the President, in pursuance of which Brevet Major-\r\nGeneral Robert Anderson, United States Army, will restore to its\r\noriginal place on the fort the identical flag which, after an\r\nhonorable and gallant defense, he was compelled to lower to the\r\ninsurgents in South Carolina, in April, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies for the occasion will commence with prayer, at\r\nthirty minutes past eleven o'clock A.M.\r\n\r\nAt noon precisely, the flag will be raised and saluted with one\r\nhundred guns from Fort Sumter, and with a national salute from Fort\r\nMoultrie and Battery Bee on Sullivan's Island, Fort Putnam on\r\nMorris Island, and Fort Johnson on James's Island; it being\r\neminently appropriate that the places which were so conspicuous in\r\nthe inauguration of the rebellion should take a part not less\r\nprominent in this national rejoicing over the restoration of the\r\nnational authority.\r\n\r\nAfter the salutes, the Rev.  Henry Ward Beecher will deliver an\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies will close with prayer and a benediction.\r\n\r\nColonel Stewart L.

Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington\r\n\r\nHaving defended Fort Sumter for thirty-four hours, until the\r\nquarters were entirely burned, the main gates destroyed by fire,\r\nthe gorge-walls seriously injured, the magazine surrounded by\r\nflames, and its door closed from the effect of heat, four barrels\r\nand three cartridges of powder only being available, and no\r\nprovisions remaining but pork, I accepted terms of evacuation\r\noffered by General Beauregard, being the same offered by him on the\r\n11th inst., prior to the commencement of hostilities, and marched\r\nout of the fort, Sunday afternoon, the 14th inst., with colors\r\nflying and drums beating, bringing away company and private\r\nproperty, and saluting my flag with fifty guns.\r\n\r\nROBERT ANDERSON, Major First Artillery, commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE WAR--FROM GOLDSBORO' TO RALEIGH AND WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nAPRIL AND MAY, 1865.\r\n\r\nAs before described, the armies commanded respectively by Generals\r\nJ. M. Schofield, A. H. Terry, and myself, effected a junction in\r\nand about Goldsboro', North Carolina, during the 22d and 23d of\r\nMarch, 1865, but it required a few days for all the troops and\r\ntrains of wagons to reach their respective camps.  In person I\r\nreached Goldsboro' on the 23d, and met General Schofield, who\r\ndescribed fully his operations in North Carolina up to that date;\r\nand I also found Lieutenant Dunn, aide-de-camp to General Grant,\r\nwith a letter from him of March 16th, giving a general description\r\nof the state of facts about City Point.  The next day I received\r\nanother letter, more full, dated the 22d, which I give herewith.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I deemed it of great importance that I should have a\r\npersonal interview with the general, and determined to go in person\r\nto City Point as soon as the repairs of the railroad, then in\r\nprogress under the personal direction of Colonel W. W. Wright,\r\nwould permit:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 22, 1865\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN, Commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Although the Richmond papers do not communicate the fact,\r\nyet I saw enough in them to satisfy me that you occupied Goldsboro'\r\non the 19th inst. I congratulate you and the army on what may be\r\nregarded as the successful termination of the third campaign since\r\nleaving the Tennessee River, less than one year ago.\r\n\r\nSince Sheridan's very successful raid north of the James, the enemy\r\nare left dependent on the Southside and Danville roads for all\r\ntheir supplies.  These I hope to cut next week.  Sheridan is at\r\nWhite House, \"shoeing up\" and resting his cavalry.  I expect him to\r\nfinish by Friday night and to start the following morning, raid\r\nLong Bridge, Newmarket, Bermuda Hundred, and the extreme left of\r\nthe army around Petersburg.  He will make no halt with the armies\r\noperating here, but will be joined by a division of cavalry, five\r\nthousand five hundred strong, from the Army of the Potomac, and\r\nwill proceed directly to the Southside and Danville roads.  His\r\ninstructions will be to strike the Southside road as near\r\nPetersburg as he can, and destroy it so that it cannot be repaired\r\nfor three or four days, and push on to the Danville road, as near\r\nto the Appomattox as he can get.  Then I want him to destroy the\r\nroad toward Burkesville as far as he can; then push on to the\r\nSouthside road, west of Burkesville, and destroy it effectually.\r\nFrom that point I shall probably leave it to his discretion either\r\nto return to this army, crossing the Danville road south of\r\nBurkesville, or go and join you, passing between Danville and\r\nGreensboro'.  When this movement commences I shall move out by my\r\nleft, with all the force I can, holding present intrenched lines.\r\nI shall start with no distinct view, further than holding Lee's\r\nforces from following Sheridan.  But I shall be along myself, and\r\nwill take advantage of any thing that turns up.  If Lee detaches, I\r\nwill attack; or if he comes out of his lines I will endeavor to\r\nrepulse him, and follow it up to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is most difficult to understand what the rebels intend to do; so\r\nfar but few troops have been detached from Lee's army.  Much\r\nmachinery has been removed, and material has been sent to\r\nLynchburg, showing a disposition to go there.  Points, too, have\r\nbeen fortified on the Danville road.\r\n\r\nLee's army is much demoralized, and great numbers are deserting.\r\nProbably, from returned prisoners, and such conscripts as can be\r\npicked up, his numbers may be kept up.  I estimate his force now at\r\nabout sixty-five thousand men.\r\n\r\nWilson started on Monday, with twelve thousand cavalry, from\r\nEastport.  Stoneman started on the same day, from East Tennessee,\r\ntoward Lynchburg.  Thomas is moving the Fourth Corps to Bull's Gap.\r\nCanby is moving with a formidable force on Mobile and the interior\r\nof Alabama.\r\n\r\nI ordered Gilmore, as soon as the fall of Charleston was known, to\r\nhold all important posts on the sea-coast, and to send to\r\nWilmington all surplus forces.  Thomas was also directed to forward\r\nto Newbern all troops belonging to the corps with you.  I\r\nunderstand this will give you about five thousand men, besides\r\nthose brought east by Meagher.\r\n\r\nI have been telegraphing General Meigs to hasten up locomotives and\r\ncars for you.  General McCallum, he informs me, is attending to it.\r\nI fear they are not going forward as fast as I world like.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want more troops, or any thing else.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU. S.  GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railroad was repaired to Goldsboro' by the evening of March\r\n25th, when, leaving General Schofield in chief command, with a\r\ncouple of staff-officers I started for City Point, Virginia, in a\r\nlocomotive, in company with Colonel Wright, the constructing\r\nengineer.  We reached Newbern that evening, which was passed in the\r\ncompany of General Palmer and his accomplished lady, and early the\r\nnext morning we continued on to Morehead City, where General Easton\r\nhad provided for us the small captured steamer Russia, Captain\r\nSmith.  We put to sea at once and steamed up the coast, reaching\r\nFortress Monroe on the morning of the 27th, where I landed and\r\ntelegraphed to my brother, Senator Sherman, at Washington, inviting\r\nhim to come down and return with me to Goldsboro.  We proceeded on\r\nup James River to City Point, which we reached the same afternoon.\r\nI found General Grant, with his family and staff, occupying a\r\npretty group of huts on the bank of James River, overlooking the\r\nharbor, which was full of vessels of all classes, both war and\r\nmerchant, with wharves and warehouses on an extensive scale.  The\r\ngeneral received me most heartily, and we talked over matters very\r\nfully.  After I had been with him an hour or so, he remarked that\r\nthe President, Mr. Lincoln, was then on board the steamer River\r\nQueen, lying at the wharf, and he proposed that we should call and\r\nsee him.  We walked down to the wharf, went on board, and found Mr.\r\nLincoln alone, in the after-cabin.  He remembered me perfectly, and\r\nat once engaged in a most interesting conversation.  He was full of\r\ncuriosity about the many incidents of our great march, which had\r\nreached him officially and through the newspapers, and seemed to\r\nenjoy very much the more ludicrous parts-about the \"bummers,\" and\r\ntheir devices to collect food and forage when the outside world\r\nsupposed us to be starving; but at the same time he expressed a\r\ngood deal of anxiety lest some accident might happen to the army in\r\nNorth Carolina during my absence.  I explained to him that that\r\narmy was snug and comfortable, in good camps, at Goldsboro'; that\r\nit would require some days to collect forage and food for another\r\nmarch; and that General Schofield was fully competent to command it\r\nin my absence.  Having made a good, long, social visit, we took our\r\nleave and returned to General Grant's quarters, where Mrs. Grant\r\nhad provided tea.  While at the table, Mrs. Grant inquired if we\r\nhad seen Mrs. Lincoln.  \"No,\" said the general, \"I did not ask for\r\nher;\" and I added that I did not even know that she was on board.\r\nMrs. Grant then exclaimed, \"Well, you are a pretty pair!\" and added\r\nthat our neglect was unpardonable; when the general said we would\r\ncall again the next day, and make amends for the unintended slight.\r\n\r\nEarly the next day, March 28th, all the principal officers of the\r\narmy and navy called to see me, Generals Meade, Ord, Ingalls, etc.,\r\nand Admiral Porter.  At this time the River Queen was at anchor out\r\nin the river, abreast of the wharf, and we again started to visit\r\nMr. and Mrs. Lincoln.  Admiral Porter accompanied us.  We took a\r\nsmall, tug at the wharf, which conveyed us on board, where we were\r\nagain received most courteously by the President, who conducted us\r\nto the after-cabin.  After the general compliments, General Grant\r\ninquired after Mrs. Lincoln, when the President went to her state-\r\nroom, returned, and begged us to excuse her, as she was not well.\r\nWe then again entered upon a general conversation, during which\r\nGeneral Grant explained to the President that at that very instant\r\nof time General Sheridan was crossing James River from the north,\r\nby a pontoon-bridge below City Point; that he had a large,\r\nwell-appointed force of cavalry, with which he proposed to strike\r\nthe Southside and Danville Railroads, by which alone General Lee,\r\nin Richmond, supplied his army; and that, in his judgment, matters\r\nwere drawing to a crisis, his only apprehension being that General\r\nLee would not wait long enough.  I also explained that my army at\r\nGoldsboro' was strong enough to fight Lee's army and Johnston's\r\ncombined, provided that General Grant could come up within a day or\r\nso; that if Lee would only remain in Richmond another fortnight, I\r\ncould march up to Burkesville, when Lee would have to starve inside\r\nof his lines, or come out from his intrenchments and fight us on\r\nequal terms.\r\n\r\nBoth General Grant and myself supposed that one or the other of us\r\nwould have to fight one more bloody battle, and that it would be\r\nthe last.  Mr. Lincoln exclaimed, more than once, that there had\r\nbeen blood enough shed, and asked us if another battle could not be\r\navoided.  I remember well to have said that we could not control\r\nthat event; that this necessarily rested with our enemy; and I\r\ninferred that both Jeff. Davis and General Lee would be forced to\r\nfight one more desperate and bloody battle.  I rather supposed it\r\nwould fall on me, somewhere near Raleigh; and General Grant added\r\nthat, if Lee would only wait a few more days, he would have his\r\narmy so disposed that if the enemy should abandon Richmond, and\r\nattempt to make junction with General Jos. Johnston in North\r\nCarolina, he (General Grant) would be on his heels.  Mr. Lincoln\r\nmore than once expressed uneasiness that I was not with my army at\r\nGoldsboro', when I again assured him that General Schofield was\r\nfully competent to command in my absence; that I was going to start\r\nback that very day, and that Admiral Porter had kindly provided for\r\nme the steamer Bat, which he said was much swifter than my own\r\nvessel, the Russia.  During this interview I inquired of the\r\nPresident if he was all ready for the end of the war.  What was to\r\nbe done with the rebel armies when defeated?  And what should be\r\ndone with the political leaders, such as Jeff. Davis, etc.?  Should\r\nwe allow them to escape, etc.?  He said he was all ready; all he\r\nwanted of us was to defeat the opposing armies, and to get the men\r\ncomposing the Confederate armies back to their homes, at work on\r\ntheir farms and in their shops.  As to Jeff. Davis, he was hardly\r\nat liberty to speak his mind fully, but intimated that he ought to\r\nclear out, \"escape the country,\" only it would not do for him to\r\nsay so openly.  As usual, he illustrated his meaning by a story:\r\n\r\nA man once had taken the total-abstinence pledge. When visiting a\r\nfriend, he was invited to take a drink, but declined, on the score\r\nof his pledge; when his friend suggested lemonade, which was\r\naccepted.  In preparing the lemonade, the friend pointed to the\r\nbrandy-bottle, and said the lemonade would be more palatable if he\r\nwere to pour in a little brandy; when his guest said, if he could\r\ndo so \"unbeknown\" to him, he would \"not object.\"  From which\r\nillustration I inferred that Mr. Lincoln wanted Davis to escape,\r\n\"unbeknown\" to him.\r\n\r\nI made no notes of this conversation at the time, but Admiral\r\nPorter, who was present, did, and in 1866 he furnished me an\r\naccount thereof, which I insert below, but the admiral describes\r\nthe first visit, of the 27th, whereas my memory puts Admiral\r\nPorter's presence on the following day.  Still he may be right, and\r\nhe may have been with us the day before, as I write this chiefly\r\nfrom memory.  There were two distinct interviews; the first was\r\nlate in the afternoon of March 27th, and the other about noon of\r\nthe 28th, both in the after-cabin of the steamer River Queen; on\r\nboth occasions Mr. Lincoln was full and frank in his conversation,\r\nassuring me that in his mind he was all ready for the civil\r\nreorganization of affairs at the South as soon as the war was over;\r\nand he distinctly authorized me to assure Governor Vance and the\r\npeople of North Carolina that, as soon as the rebel armies laid\r\ndown their arms, and resumed their civil pursuits, they would at\r\nonce be guaranteed all their rights as citizens of a common\r\ncountry; and that to avoid anarchy the State governments then in\r\nexistence, with their civil functionaries, would be recognized by\r\nhim as the government de facto till Congress could provide others.\r\n\r\nI know, when I left him, that I was more than ever impressed by his\r\nkindly nature, his deep and earnest sympathy with the afflictions\r\nof the whole people, resulting from the war, and by the march of\r\nhostile armies through the South; and that his earnest desire\r\nseemed to be to end the war speedily, without more bloodshed or\r\ndevastation, and to restore all the men of both sections to their\r\nhomes. In the language of his second inaugural address, he seemed\r\nto have \"charity for all, malice toward none,\" and, above all, an\r\nabsolute faith in the courage, manliness, and integrity of the\r\narmies in the field.  When at rest or listening, his legs and arms\r\nseemed to hang almost lifeless, and his face was care-worn and\r\nhaggard; but, the moment he began to talk, his face lightened up,\r\nhis tall form, as it were, unfolded, and he was the very\r\nimpersonation of good-humor and fellowship.  The last words I\r\nrecall as addressed to me were that he would feel better when I was\r\nback at Goldsboro'.  We parted at the gangway of the River Queen,\r\nabout noon of March 28th, and I never saw him again.  Of all the\r\nmen I ever met, he seemed to possess more of the elements of\r\ngreatness, combined with goodness, than any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL PORTER'S ACCOUNT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH\r\nMr. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nThe day of General Sherman's arrival at City Point (I think the\r\n27th of March, 1866), I accompanied him and General Grant on board\r\nthe President's flagship, the Queen, where the President received\r\nus in the upper saloon, no one but ourselves being present.\r\n\r\nThe President was in an exceedingly pleasant mood, and delighted to\r\nmeet General Sherman, whom he cordially greeted.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this was the first time he had met Sherman, to\r\nremember him, since the beginning of the war, and did not remember\r\nwhen he had seen him before, until the general reminded him of the\r\ncircumstances of their first meeting.\r\n\r\nThis was rather singular on the part of Mr. Lincoln, who was, I\r\nthink, remarkable for remembering people, having that kingly\r\nquality in an eminent degree.  Indeed, such was the power of his\r\nmemory, that he seemed never to forget the most minute\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nThe conversation soon turned on the events of Sherman's campaign\r\nthrough the South, with every movement of which the President\r\nseemed familiar.\r\n\r\nHe laughed over some of the stories Sherman told of his \"bummers,\"\r\nand told others in return, which illustrated in a striking manner\r\nthe ideas he wanted to convey.  For example, he would often express\r\nhis wishes by telling an apt story, which was quite a habit with\r\nhim, and one that I think he adopted to prevent his committing\r\nhimself seriously.\r\n\r\nThe interview between the two generals and the President lasted\r\nabout an hour and a half, and, as it was a remarkable one, I jotted\r\ndown what I remembered of the conversation, as I have made a\r\npractice of doing during the rebellion, when any thing interesting\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nI don't regret having done so, as circumstances afterward occurred\r\n(Stanton's ill conduct toward Sherman) which tended to cast odium\r\non General Sherman for allowing such liberal terms to Jos.\r\nJohnston.\r\n\r\nCould the conversation that occurred on board the Queen, between\r\nthe President and General Sherman, have been known, Sherman would\r\nnot, and could not, have been censored.  Mr. Lincoln, had he lived,\r\nwould have acquitted the general of any blame, for he was only\r\ncarrying out the President's wishes.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is, that Mr. Lincoln came down to City Point with the\r\nmost liberal views toward the rebels.  He felt confident that we\r\nwould be successful, and was willing that the enemy should\r\ncapitulate on the most favorable terms.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the President would have done had he been left to\r\nhimself, and had our army been unsuccessful, but he was than\r\nwrought up to a high state of excitement.  He wanted peace on\r\nalmost any terms, and there is no knowing what proposals he might\r\nhave been willing to listen to.  His heart was tenderness\r\nthroughout, and, as long as the rebels laid down their arms, he did\r\nnot care how it was done.  I do not know how far he was influenced\r\nby General Grant, but I presume, from their long conferences, that\r\nthey must have understood each other perfectly, and that the terms\r\ngiven to Lee after his surrender were authorized by Mr. Lincoln.  I\r\nknow that the latter was delighted when he heard that they had been\r\ngiven, and exclaimed, a dozen times, \"Good!\"  \"All right!\"\r\n\"Exactly the thing!\" and other similar expressions.  Indeed, the\r\nPresident more than once told me what he supposed the terms would\r\nbe: if Lee and Johnston surrendered, he considered the war ended,\r\nand that all the other rebel forces world lay down their arms at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIn this he proved to be right.  Grant and Sherman were both of the\r\nsame opinion, and so was everyone else who knew anything about the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWhat signified the terms to them, so long as we obtained the actual\r\nsurrender of people who only wanted a good opportunity to give up\r\ngracefully?  The rebels had fought \"to the last ditch,\" and all\r\nthat they had left them was the hope of being handed down in\r\nhistory as having received honorable terms.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing General Sherman's account of his own position, and\r\nthat of Johnston, at that time, the President expressed fears that\r\nthe rebel general would escape south again by the railroads, and\r\nthat General Sherman would have to chase him anew, over the same\r\nground; but the general pronounced this to be impracticable.  He\r\nremarked: \"I have him where he cannot move without breaking up his\r\narmy, which, once disbanded, can never again be got together; and I\r\nhave destroyed the Southern railroads, so that they cannot be used\r\nagain for a long time.\"  General Grant remarked, \"What is to\r\nprevent their laying the rails again?\"  \"Why,\" said General\r\nSherman, \"my bummers  don't do things by halves.  Every rail, after\r\nhaving been placed over a hot fire, has been twisted as crooked as\r\na ram's-horn, and they never can be used again.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the only remark made by General Grant during the\r\ninterview, as he sat smoking a short distance from the President,\r\nintent, no doubt, on his own plans, which were being brought to a\r\nsuccessful termination.\r\n\r\nThe conversation between the President and General Sherman, about\r\nthe terms of surrender to be allowed Jos. Johnston, continued.\r\nSherman energetically insisted that he could command his own terms,\r\nand that Johnston would have to yield to his demands; but the\r\nPresident was very decided about the matter, and insisted that the\r\nsurrender of Johnston's army most be obtained on any terms.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was evidently of the same way of thinking, for,\r\nalthough he did not join in the conversation to any extent, yet he\r\nmade no objections, and I presume had made up his mind to allow the\r\nbest terms himself.\r\n\r\nHe was also anxious that Johnston should not be driven into\r\nRichmond, to reenforce the rebels there, who, from behind their\r\nstrong intrenchments, would have given us incalculable trouble.\r\n\r\nSherman, as a subordinate officer, yielded his views to those of\r\nthe President, and the terms of capitulation between himself and\r\nJohnston were exactly in accordance with Mr. Lincoln's wishes.  He\r\ncould not have done any thing which would have pleased the\r\nPresident better.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln did, in fact, arrange the (so considered) liberal terms\r\noffered General Jos. Johnston, and, whatever may have been General\r\nSherman's private views, I feel sure that he yielded to the wishes\r\nof the President in every respect.  It was Mr. Lincoln's policy\r\nthat was carried out, and, had he lived long enough, he would have\r\nbeen but too glad to have acknowledged it.  Had Mr. Lincoln lived,\r\nSecretary Stanton would have issued no false telegraphic\r\ndispatches, in the hope of killing off another general in the\r\nregular army, one who by his success had placed himself in the way\r\nof his own succession.\r\n\r\nThe disbanding of Jos. Johnston's army was so complete, that the\r\npens and ink used in the discussion of the matter were all wasted.\r\n\r\nIt was asserted, by the rabid ones, that General Sherman had given\r\nup all that we had been fighting for, had conceded every thing to\r\nJos. Johnston, and had, as the boys say, \"knocked the fat into the\r\nfire;\" but sober reflection soon overruled these harsh expressions,\r\nand, with those who knew General Sherman, and appreciated him, he\r\nwas still the great soldier, patriot, and gentleman.  In future\r\ntimes this matter will be looked at more calmly and\r\ndispassionately.  The bitter animosities that have been engendered\r\nduring the rebellion will have died out for want of food on which\r\nto live, and the very course Grant, Sherman, and others pursued, in\r\ngranting liberal terms to the defeated rebels, will be applauded.\r\nThe fact is, they met an old beggar in the road, whose crutches had\r\nbroken from under him: they let him have only the broken crutches\r\nto get home with!\r\n\r\nI sent General Sherman back to Newbern, North Carolina, in the\r\nsteamer Bat.\r\n\r\nWhile he was absent from his command he was losing no time, for he\r\nwas getting his army fully equipped with stores and clothing; and,\r\nwhen he returned, he had a rested and regenerated army, ready to\r\nswallow up Jos. Johnston and all his ragamuffins.\r\n\r\nJohnston was cornered, could not move without leaving every thing\r\nbehind him, and could not go to Richmond without bringing on a\r\nfamine in that destitute city.\r\n\r\nI was with Mr. Lincoln all the time he was at City Point, and until\r\nhe left for Washington.  He was more than delighted with the\r\nsurrender of Lee, and with the terms Grant gave the rebel general;\r\nand would have given Jos. Johnston twice as much, had the latter\r\nasked for it, and could he have been certain that the rebel world\r\nhave surrendered without a fight.  I again repeat that, had Mr.\r\nLincoln lived, he would have shouldered all the responsibility.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: had Jos. Johnston escaped and got into\r\nRichmond, and caused a larger list of killed and wounded than we\r\nhad, General Sherman would have been blamed.  Then why not give him\r\nthe full credit of capturing on the best terms the enemy's last\r\nimportant army and its best general, and putting an end to the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nIt was a finale worthy of Sherman's great march through the swamps\r\nand deserts of the South, a march not excelled by any thing we read\r\nof in modern military history.\r\n\r\nD. D. PORTER, Vice-Admiral.\r\n\r\n(Written by the admiral in 1866, at the United States Naval Academy\r\nat Annapolis, Md., and mailed to General Sherman at St. Louis, Mo.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible, I arranged with General Grant for certain\r\nchanges in the organization of my army; and the general also\r\nundertook to send to North Carolina some tug-boat and barges to\r\ncarry stores from Newbern up as far as Kinston, whence they could\r\nbe hauled in wagons to our camps, thus relieving our railroads to\r\nthat extent.  I undertook to be ready to march north by April 10th,\r\nand then embarked on the steamer Bat, Captain Barnes, for North\r\nCarolina.  We steamed down James River, and at Old Point Comfort\r\ntook on board my brother, Senator Sherman, and Mr. Edwin Stanton,\r\nson of the Secretary of War, and proceeded at once to our\r\ndestination.  On our way down the river, Captain Barnes expressed\r\nhimself extremely obliged to me for taking his vessel, as it had\r\nrelieved him of a most painful dilemma.  He explained that he had\r\nbeen detailed by Admiral Porter to escort the President's unarmed\r\nboat, the River Queen, in which capacity it became his special duty\r\nto look after Mrs. Lincoln.  The day before my arrival at City\r\nPoint, there had been a grand review of a part of the Army of the\r\nJames, then commanded by General Ord.  The President rode out from\r\nCity Point with General Grant on horseback, accompanied by a\r\nnumerous staff, including Captain Barnes and Mrs. Ord; but Mrs.\r\nLincoln and Mrs. Grant had followed in a carriage.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade reached the review-ground some five or six miles out\r\nfrom City Point, found the troops all ready, drawn up in line, and\r\nafter the usual presentation of arms, the President and party,\r\nfollowed by Mrs. Ord and Captain Barnes on horseback, rode the\r\nlines, and returned to the reviewing stand, which meantime had been\r\nreached by Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Grant in their carriage, which had\r\nbeen delayed by the driver taking a wrong road.  Mrs. Lincoln,\r\nseeing Mrs. Ord and Captain Barnes riding with the retinue, and\r\nsupposing that Mrs. Ord had personated her, turned on Captain\r\nBarnes and gave him a fearful scolding; and even indulged in some\r\npretty sharp upbraidings to Mrs. Ord.\r\n\r\nThis made Barne's position very unpleasant, so that he felt much\r\nrelieved when he was sent with me to North Carolina.  The Bat was\r\nvery fast, and on the morning of the 29th we were near Cape\r\nHatteras; Captain Barnes, noticing a propeller coming out of\r\nHatteras Inlet, made her turn back and pilot us in.  We entered\r\nsafely, steamed up Pamlico Sound into Neuse River, and the next\r\nmorning,--by reason of some derangement of machinery, we anchored\r\nabout seven miles below Newbern, whence we went up in Captain\r\nBarnes's barge.  As soon as we arrived at Newbern, I telegraphed up\r\nto General Schofield at Goldsboro' the fact of my return, and that\r\nI had arranged with General Grant for the changes made necessary in\r\nthe reorganization of the army, and for the boats necessary to\r\ncarry up the provisions and stores we needed, prior to the renewal\r\nof our march northward.\r\n\r\nThese changes amounted to constituting the left wing a distinct\r\narmy, under the title of \"the Army of Georgia,\" under command of\r\nGeneral Slocum, with his two corps commanded by General Jeff. C.\r\nDavis and General Joseph A. Mower; the Tenth and Twenty-third Corps\r\nalready constituted another army, \"of the Ohio,\" under the command\r\nof Major-General Schofield, and his two corps were commanded by\r\nGenerals J. D. Cox and A. H. Terry.  These changes were necessary,\r\nbecause army commanders only could order courts-martial, grant\r\ndischarges, and perform many other matters of discipline and\r\nadministration which were indispensable; but my chief purpose was\r\nto prepare the whole army for what seemed among the probabilities\r\nof the time--to fight both Lee's and Johnston's armies combined, in\r\ncase their junction could be formed before General Grant could\r\npossibly follow Lee to North Carolina.\r\n\r\nGeneral George H. Thomas, who still remained at Nashville, was not\r\npleased with these changes, for the two corps with General Slocum,\r\nviz., the Fourteenth and Twentieth, up to that time, had remained\r\ntechnically a part of his \"Army of the Cumberland;\" but he was so\r\nfar away, that I had to act to the best advantage with the troops\r\nand general officers actually present.  I had specially asked for\r\nGeneral Mower to command the Twentieth Corps, because I regarded\r\nhim as one of the boldest and best fighting generals in the whole\r\narmy.  His predecessor, General A. S. Williams, the senior division\r\ncommander present, had commanded the corps well from Atlanta to\r\nGoldsboro', and it may have seemed unjust to replace him at that\r\nprecise moment; but I was resolved to be prepared for a most\r\ndesperate and, as then expected, a final battle, should it fall on\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI returned to Goldsboro' from Newbern by rail the evening of March\r\n30th, and at once addressed myself to the task of reorganization\r\nand replenishment of stores, so as to be ready to march by April\r\n10th, the day agreed on with General Grant.\r\n\r\nThe army was divided into the usual three parts, right and left\r\nwings, and centre.  The tabular statements herewith will give the\r\nexact composition of these separate armies, which by the 10th of\r\nApril gave the following effective strength:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Infantry ................... 80,968\r\n        Artillery ..................  2,448\r\n        Cavalry ....................  5,587\r\n\r\n              Aggregate ............ 88,948\r\n        Total number of guns, 91\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railroads to our rear had also been repaired, so that stores\r\nwere arriving very fast, both from Morehead City and Wilmington.\r\nThe country was so level that a single locomotive could haul\r\ntwenty-five and thirty cars to a train, instead of only ten, as was\r\nthe case in Tennessee and Upper Georgia.\r\n\r\nBy the 5th of April such progress had been made, that I issued the\r\nfollowing Special Field Orders, No. 48, prescribing the time and\r\nmanner of the next march\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No. 48.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, GOLDSBORO', NORTH CAROLINA, April 5, 1865.\r\n\r\nConfidential to Army Commanders, Corps Commanders, and Chiefs of\r\nStaff Departments:\r\n\r\nThe next grand objective is to place this army (with its full\r\nequipment) north of Roanoke River, facing west, with a base for\r\nsupplies at Norfolk, and at Winton or Murfreesboro' on the Chowan,\r\nand in full communication with the Army of the Potomac, about\r\nPetersburg; and also to do the enemy as much harm as possible en\r\nroute:\r\n\r\n1.  To accomplish this result the following general plan will be\r\nfollowed, or modified only by written orders from these\r\nheadquarters, should events require a change:\r\n\r\n(1.) On Monday, the 10th of April, all preparations are presumed to\r\nbe complete, and the outlying detachments will be called in, or\r\ngiven directions to meet on the next march.  All preparations will\r\nalso be complete to place the railroad-stock back of Kinston on the\r\none road, and below the Northeast Branch on the other.\r\n\r\n(2.) On Tuesday, the 11th, the columns will draw out on their lines\r\nof march, say, about seven miles, and close up.\r\n\r\n(3.) On Wednesday the march will begin in earnest, and will be kept\r\nup at the rate, say, of about twelve miles a day, or according to\r\nthe amount of resistance.  All the columns will dress to the left\r\n(which is the exposed flank), and commanders will study always to\r\nfind roads by which they can, if necessary, perform a general left\r\nwheel, the wagons to be escorted to some place of security on the\r\ndirect route of march.  Foraging and other details may continue as\r\nheretofore, only more caution and prudence should be observed; and\r\nforagers should not go in advance of the advance-guard, but look\r\nmore to our right rear for corn, bacon, and meal.\r\n\r\n2.  The left wing (Major-General Slocum commanding) will aim\r\nstraight for the railroad-bridge near Smithfield; thence along up\r\nthe Neuse River to the railroad-bridge over Neuse River, northeast\r\nof Raleigh (Powell's); thence to Warrenton, the general point of\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nThe centre (Major-General Schofield commanding) will move to\r\nWhitley's Mill, ready to support the left until it is past\r\nSmithfield, when it will follow up (substantially) Little River to\r\nabout Rolesville, ready at all times to move to the support of the\r\nleft; after passing Tar River, to move to Warrenton.\r\n\r\nThe right wing (Major-General Howard commanding), preceded by the\r\ncavalry, will move rapidly on Pikeville and Nahunta, then swing\r\nacross to Bulah to Folk's Bridge, ready to make junction with the\r\nother armies in case the enemy offers battle this side of Neuse\r\nRiver, about Smithfield; thence, in case of no serious opposition\r\non the left, will work up toward Earpsboro', Andrews, B----, and\r\nWarrenton.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry (General Kilpatrick commanding), leaving its\r\nencumbrances with the right wing, will push as though straight for\r\nWeldon, until the enemy is across Tar River, and that bridge\r\nburned; then it will deflect toward Nashville and Warrenton,\r\nkeeping up communication with general headquarters.\r\n\r\n3.  As soon as the army starts, the chief-quartermaster and\r\ncommissary will prepare a resupply of stores at some point on\r\nPamlico or Albemarle Sounds, ready to be conveyed to Kinston or\r\nWinton and Murfreesboro', according to developments.  As soon as\r\nthey have satisfactory information that the army is north of the\r\nRoanoke, they will forthwith establish a depot at Winton, with a\r\nsub-depot at Murfreesboro'.  Major-General Schofield will hold, as\r\nheretofore, Wilmington (with the bridge across Northern Branch as\r\nan outpost), Newborn (and Kinston as its outpost), and will be\r\nprepared to hold Winton and Murfreesboro' as soon as the time\r\narrives for that move.  The navy has instructions from Admiral\r\nPorter to cooperate, and any commanding officer is authorized to\r\ncall on the navy for assistance and cooperation, always in writing,\r\nsetting forth the reasons, of which necessarily the naval\r\ncommander must be the judge.\r\n\r\n4.  The general-in-chief will be with the centre habitually, but\r\nmay in person shift to either flank where his presence may be\r\nneeded, leaving a staff-officer to receive reports.  He requires,\r\nabsolutely, a report of each army or grand detachment each night,\r\nwhether any thing material has occurred or not, for often the\r\nabsence of an enemy is a very important fact in military\r\nprognostication.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\n\r\nL. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the whole problem became suddenly changed by the news of the\r\nfall of Richmond and Petersburg, which reached as at Goldsboro', on\r\nthe 6th of April.  The Confederate Government, with Lee's army, had\r\nhastily abandoned Richmond, fled in great disorder toward Danville,\r\nand General Grant's whole army was in close pursuit.  Of course, I\r\ninferred that General Lee would succeed in making junction with\r\nGeneral Johnston, with at least a fraction of his army, somewhere\r\nto my front.  I at once altered the foregoing orders, and prepared\r\non the day appointed, viz., April 10th, to move straight on\r\nRaleigh, against the army of General Johnston, known to be at\r\nSmithfield, and supposed to have about thirty-five thousand men.\r\nWade Hampton's cavalry was on his left front and Wheeler's on his\r\nright front, simply watching us and awaiting our initiative.\r\nMeantime the details of the great victories in Virginia came thick\r\nand fast, and on the 8th I received from General Grant this\r\ncommunication, in the form of a cipher-dispatch:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nWILSON'S STATION, April 5, 1865\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General SHERMAN, Goldsboro', North Carolina:\r\n\r\nAll indications now are that Lee will attempt to reach Danville\r\nwith the remnant of his force.  Sheridan, who was up with him last\r\nnight, reports all that is left with him--horse, foot, and\r\ndragoons--at twenty thousand, much demoralized.  We hope to reduce\r\nthis number one-half.  I will push on to Burkesville, and, if a\r\nstand is made at Danville, will, in a very few days, go there.  If\r\nyou can possibly do so, push on from where you are, and let us see\r\nif we cannot finish the job with Lee's and Johnston's armies.\r\nWhether it will be better for you to strike for Greensboro' or\r\nnearer to Danville, you will be better able to judge when you\r\nreceive this.  Rebel armies now are the only strategic points to\r\nstrike at.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI answered immediately that we would move on the 10th, prepared to\r\nfollow Johnston wherever he might go.  Promptly on Monday morning,\r\nApril 10th, the army moved straight on Smithfield; the right wing\r\nmaking a circuit by the right, and the left wing, supported by the\r\ncentre, moving on the two direct roads toward Raleigh, distant\r\nfifty miles.  General Terry's and General Kilpatrick's troops moved\r\nfrom their positions on the south or west bank of the Neuse River\r\nin the same general direction, by Cox's Bridge.  On the 11th we\r\nreached Smithfield, and found it abandoned by Johnston's army,\r\nwhich had retreated hastily on Raleigh, burning the bridges.  To\r\nrestore these consumed the remainder of the day, and during that\r\nnight I received a message from General Grant, at Appomattox, that\r\nGeneral Lee had surrendered to him his whole army, which I at once\r\nannounced to the troops in orders:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No.  54]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, SMITHFIELD, NORTH CAROLINA, April 12, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe general commanding announces to the army that he has official\r\nnotice from General Grant that General Lee surrendered to him his\r\nentire army, on the 9th inst., at Appomattox Court-House, Virginia.\r\n\r\nGlory to God and our country, and all honor to our comrades in\r\narms, toward whom we are marching!\r\n\r\nA little more labor, a little more toil on our part, the great race\r\nis won, and our Government stands regenerated, after four long\r\nyears of war.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, this created a perfect furore, of rejoicing, and we all\r\nregarded the war as over, for I knew well that General Johnston had\r\nno army with which to oppose mine.  So that the only questions that\r\nremained were, would he surrender at Raleigh?  or would he allow\r\nhis army to disperse into guerrilla bands, to \"die in the last\r\nditch,\" and entail on his country an indefinite and prolonged\r\nmilitary occupation, and of consequent desolation?  I knew well\r\nthat Johnston's army could not be caught; the country was too open;\r\nand, without wagons, the men could escape us, disperse, and\r\nassemble again at some place agreed on, and thus the war might be\r\nprolonged indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI then remembered Mr. Lincoln's repeated expression that he wanted\r\nthe rebel soldiers not only defeated, but \"back at their homes,\r\nengaged in their civil pursuits.\"  On the evening of the 12th I was\r\nwith the head of Slocum's column, at Gulley's, and General\r\nKilpatrick's cavalry was still ahead, fighting Wade Hampton's\r\nrear-guard, with orders to push it through Raleigh, while I would\r\ngive a more southerly course to the infantry columns, so as, if\r\npossible, to prevent a retreat southward.  On the 13th, early, I\r\nentered Raleigh, and ordered the several heads of column toward\r\nAshville in the direction of Salisbury or Charlotte.  Before\r\nreaching Raleigh, a locomotive came down the road to meet me,\r\npassing through both Wade Hampton's and Kilpatrick's cavalry,\r\nbringing four gentlemen, with a letter from Governor Vance to me,\r\nasking protection for the citizens of Raleigh.  These gentlemen\r\nwere, of course, dreadfully excited at the dangers through which\r\nthey had passed.  Among them were ex-Senator Graham, Mr. Swain,\r\npresident of Chapel Hill University, and a Surgeon Warren, of the\r\nConfederate army.  They had come with a flag of truce, to which\r\nthey were not entitled; still, in the interest of peace, I\r\nrespected it, and permitted them to return to Raleigh with their\r\nlocomotive, to assure the Governor and the people that the war was\r\nsubstantially over, and that I wanted the civil authorities to\r\nremain in the execution of their office till the pleasure of the\r\nPresident could be ascertained.  On reaching Raleigh I found these\r\nsame gentlemen, with Messrs. Badger, Bragg, Holden, and others, but\r\nGovernor Vance had fled, and could not be prevailed on to return,\r\nbecause he feared an arrest and imprisonment.  From the Raleigh\r\nnewspapers of the 10th I learned that General Stoneman, with his\r\ndivision of cavalry, had come across the mountains from East\r\nTennessee, had destroyed the railroad at Salisbury, and was then\r\nsupposed to be approaching Greensboro'.  I also learned that\r\nGeneral Wilson's cavalry corps was \"smashing things\" down about\r\nSelma and Montgomery, Alabama, and was pushing for Columbus and\r\nMacon, Georgia; and I also had reason to expect that General\r\nSheridan would come down from Appomattox to join us at Raleigh with\r\nhis superb cavalry corps.  I needed more cavalry to check\r\nJohnston's retreat, so that I could come up to him with my\r\ninfantry, and therefore had good reason to delay.  I ordered the\r\nrailroad to be finished up to Raleigh, so that I could operate from\r\nit as a base, and then made:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No. 55]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI IN THE FIELD,\r\nRALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe next movement will be on Ashboro', to turn the position of the\r\nenemy at the \"Company's Shops\" in rear of Haw River Bridge, and at\r\nGreensboro', and to cut off his only available line of retreat by\r\nSalisbury and Charlotte:\r\n\r\n1.  General Kilpatrick will keep up a show of pursuit in the\r\ndirection of Hillsboro' and Graham, but be ready to cross Haw River\r\non General Howard's bridge, near Pittsboro', and thence will\r\noperate toward Greensboro', on the right front of the right wing.\r\n\r\n2.  The right wing, Major-General Howard commanding, will move out\r\non the Chapel Hill road, and send a light division up in the\r\ndirection of Chapel Hill University to act in connection with the\r\ncavalry; but the main columns and trains will move via Hackney's\r\nCross-Roads, and Trader's Hill, Pittsboro', St. Lawrence, etc., to\r\nbe followed by the cavalry and light division, as soon as the\r\nbridge is laid over Haw River.\r\n\r\n8.  The centre, Major-General Schofield commanding, will move via\r\nHolly Springs, New Hill, Haywood, and Moffitt's Mills.\r\n\r\n4.  The left wing, Major-General Slocum commanding, will move\r\nrapidly by the Aven's Ferry road, Carthage, Caledonia, and Cox's\r\nMills.\r\n\r\n5.  All the troops will draw well out on the roads designated\r\nduring today and to-morrow, and on the following day will move with\r\nall possible rapidity for Ashboro'.  No further destruction of\r\nrailroads, mills, cotton, and produce, will be made without the\r\nspecific orders of an army commander, and the inhabitants will be\r\ndealt with kindly, looking to an early reconciliation.  The troops\r\nwill be permitted, however, to gather forage and provisions as\r\nheretofore; only more care should be taken not to strip the poorer\r\nclasses too closely.\r\n\r\nBy order of General W. T. Sherman,\r\n\r\nL. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus matters stood, when on the morning of the 14th General\r\nKilpatrick reported from Durham's Station, twenty-six miles up the\r\nrailroad toward Hillsboro', that a flag of truce had come in from\r\nthe enemy with a package from General Johnston addressed to me.\r\nTaking it for granted that this was preliminary to a surrender, I\r\nordered the message to be sent me at Raleigh, and on the 14th\r\nreceived from General Johnston a letter dated April 13, 1865, in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of the recent campaign in Virginia have changed the\r\nrelative military condition of the belligerents.  I am, therefore,\r\ninduced to address you in this form the inquiry whether, to stop\r\nthe further effusion of blood and devastation of property, you are\r\nwilling to make a temporary suspension of active operations, and to\r\ncommunicate to Lieutenant-General Grant, commanding the armies of\r\nthe United States, the request that he will take like action in\r\nregard to other armies, the object being to permit the civil\r\nauthorities to enter into the needful arrangements to terminate the\r\nexisting war.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which I replied as follows:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral J. E. JOHNSTON, commanding Confederate Army.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have this moment received your communication of this\r\ndate.  I am fully empowered to arrange with you any terms for the\r\nsuspension of farther hostilities between the armies commanded by\r\nyou and those commanded by myself, and will be willing to confer\r\nwith you to that end.  I will limit the advance of my main column,\r\nto-morrow, to Morrisville, and the cavalry to the university, and\r\nexpect that you will also maintain the present position of your\r\nforces until each has notice of a failure to agree.\r\n\r\nThat a basis of action may be had, I undertake to abide by the same\r\nterms and conditions as were made by Generals Grant and Lee at\r\nAppomattox Court-House, on the 9th instant, relative to our two\r\narmies; and, furthermore, to obtain from General Grant an order to\r\nsuspend the movements of any troops from the direction of Virginia.\r\nGeneral Stoneman is under my command, and my order will suspend any\r\ndevastation or destruction contemplated by him.  I will add that I\r\nreally desire to save the people of North Carolina the damage they\r\nwould sustain by the march of this army through the central or\r\nwestern parts of the State.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sent my aide-de-camp, Colonel McCoy, up to Durham's Station with\r\nthis letter, with instructions to receive the answer, to telegraph\r\nits contents back to me at Raleigh, and to arrange for an\r\ninterview.  On the 16th I received a reply from General Johnston,\r\nagreeing to meet me the next day at a point midway between our\r\nadvance at Durham and his rear at Hillsboro'.  I ordered a car and\r\nlocomotive to be prepared to convey me up to Durham's at eight\r\no'clock of the morning of April 17th.  Just as we were entering the\r\ncar, the telegraph-operator, whose office was up-stairs in the\r\ndepot-building, ran down to me and said that he was at that instant\r\nof time receiving a most important dispatch in cipher from Morehead\r\nCity, which I ought to see.  I held the train for nearly half an\r\nhour, when he returned with the message translated and written out.\r\nIt was from Mr. Stanton, announcing the assassination of Mr.\r\nLincoln, the attempt on the life of  Mr. Seward and son, and a\r\nsuspicion that a like fate was designed for General Grant and all\r\nthe principal officers of the Government.  Dreading the effect of\r\nsuch a message at that critical instant of time, I asked the\r\noperator if any one besides himself had seen it; he answered No!\r\nI then bade him not to reveal the contents by word or look till I\r\ncame back, which I proposed to do the same afternoon.  The train\r\nthen started, and, as we passed Morris's Station, General Logan,\r\ncommanding the Fifteenth Corps, came into my car, and I told him I\r\nwanted to see him on my return, as I had something very important\r\nto communicate.  He knew I was going to meet General Johnston, and\r\nvolunteered to say that he hoped I would succeed in obtaining his\r\nsurrender, as the whole army dreaded the long march to Charlotte\r\n(one hundred and seventy-five miles), already begun, but which had\r\nbeen interrupted by the receipt of General Johnston's letter of the\r\n13th.  We reached Durham's, twenty-six miles, about 10 A.M., where\r\nGeneral Kilpatrick had a squadron of cavalry drawn up to receive\r\nme.  We passed into the house in which he had his headquarters, and\r\nsoon after mounted some led horses, which he had prepared for\r\nmyself and staff.  General Kilpatrick sent a man ahead with a white\r\nflag, followed by a small platoon, behind which we rode, and were\r\nfollowed by the rest of the escort.  We rode up the Hillsboro' road\r\nfor about five miles, when our flag bearer discovered another\r\ncoming to meet him: They met, and word was passed back to us that\r\nGeneral Johnston was near at hand, when we rode forward and met\r\nGeneral Johnston on horseback, riding side by side with General\r\nWade Hampton.  We shook hands, and introduced our respective\r\nattendants.  I asked if there was a place convenient where we could\r\nbe private, and General Johnston said he had passed a small\r\nfarmhouse a short distance back, when we rode back to it together\r\nside by side, our staff-officers and escorts following.  We had\r\nnever met before, though we had been in the regular army together\r\nfor thirteen years; but it so happened that we had never before\r\ncome\r\ntogether.  He was some twelve or more years my senior; but we knew\r\nenough of each other to be well acquainted at once.  We soon\r\nreached the house of a Mr. Bennett, dismounted, and left our horses\r\nwith orderlies in the road.  Our officers, on foot, passed into the\r\nyard, and General Johnston and I entered the small frame-house.  We\r\nasked the farmer if we could have the use of his house for a few\r\nminutes, and he and his wife withdrew into a smaller log-house,\r\nwhich stood close by.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were alone together I showed him the dispatch\r\nannouncing Mr. Lincoln's assassination, and watched him closely.\r\nThe perspiration came out in large drops on his forehead, and he\r\ndid not attempt to conceal his distress.  He denounced the act as a\r\ndisgrace to the age, and hoped I did not charge it to the\r\nConfederate Government.  I told him I could not believe that he or\r\nGeneral Lee, or the officers of the Confederate army, could\r\npossibly be privy to acts of assassination; but I would not say as\r\nmuch for Jeff. Davis, George Sanders, and men of that stripe.  We\r\ntalked about the effect of this act on the country at large and on\r\nthe armies, and he realized that it made my situation extremely\r\ndelicate.  I explained to him that I had not yet revealed the news\r\nto my own personal staff or to the army, and that I dreaded the\r\neffect when made known in Raleigh.  Mr. Lincoln was peculiarly\r\nendeared to the soldiers, and I feared that some foolish woman or\r\nman in Raleigh might say something or do something that would\r\nmadden our men, and that a fate worse than that of Columbia would\r\nbefall the place.\r\n\r\nI then told Johnston that he must be convinced that he could not\r\noppose my army, and that, since Lee had surrendered, he could do\r\nthe same with honor and propriety.  He plainly and repeatedly\r\nadmitted this, and added that any further fighting would be\r\n\"murder;\" but he thought that, instead of surrendering piecemeal,\r\nwe might arrange terms that would embrace all the Confederate\r\narmies.  I asked him if he could control other armies than his own;\r\nhe said, not then, but intimated that he could procure authority\r\nfrom Mr. Davis.  I then told him that I had recently had an\r\ninterview with General Grant and President Lincoln, and that I was\r\npossessed of their views; that with them and the people North there\r\nseemed to be no vindictive feeling against the Confederate armies,\r\nbut there was against Davis and his political adherents; and that\r\nthe terms that General Grant had given to General Lee's army were\r\ncertainly most generous and liberal.  All this he admitted, but\r\nalways recurred to the idea of a universal surrender, embracing his\r\nown army, that of Dick Taylor in Louisiana and Texas, and of Maury,\r\nForrest, and others, in Alabama and Georgia.  General Johnston's\r\naccount of our interview in his \"Narrative\" (page 402, et seq.) is\r\nquite accurate and correct, only I do not recall his naming the\r\ncapitulation of Loeben, to which he refers.  Our conversation was\r\nvery general and extremely cordial, satisfying me that it could\r\nhave but one result, and that which we all desired, viz., to end\r\nthe war as quickly as possible; and, being anxious to return to\r\nRaleigh before the news of Mr. Lincoln's assassination could be\r\ndivulged, on General Johnston's saying that he thought that, during\r\nthe night, he could procure authority to act in the name of all the\r\nConfederate armies in existence we agreed to meet again the next\r\nday at noon at the same place, and parted, he for Hillsboro' and I\r\nfor Raleigh.\r\n\r\nWe rode back to Durham's Station in the order we had come, and then\r\nI showed the dispatch announcing Mr. Lincoln's death.  I cautioned\r\nthe officers to watch the soldiers closely, to prevent any violent\r\nretaliation by them, leaving that to the Government at Washington;\r\nand on our way back to Raleigh in the cars I showed the same\r\ndispatch to General Logan and to several of the officers of the\r\nFifteenth Corps that were posted at Morrisville and Jones's\r\nStation, all of whom were deeply impressed by it; but all gave\r\ntheir opinion that this sad news should not change our general\r\ncourse of action.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I reached Raleigh I published the following orders to\r\nthe army, announcing the assassination of the President, and I\r\ndoubt if, in the whole land, there were more sincere mourners over\r\nhis sad fate than were then in and about Raleigh.  I watched the\r\neffect closely, and was gratified that there was no single act of\r\nretaliation; though I saw and felt that one single word by me would\r\nhave laid the city in ashes, and turned its whole population\r\nhouseless upon the country, if not worse:\r\n\r\n[Special Field Orders, No.  56.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe general commanding announces, with pain and sorrow, that on the\r\nevening of the 14th instant, at the theatre in Washington city, his\r\nExcellency the President of the United States, Mr. Lincoln, was\r\nassassinated by one who uttered the State motto of Virginia.  At\r\nthe same time, the Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, while suffering\r\nfrom a broken arm, was also stabbed by another murderer in his own\r\nhouse, but still survives, and his son was wounded, supposed\r\nfatally.  It is believed, by persons capable of judging, that other\r\nhigh officers were designed to share the same fate.  Thus it seems\r\nthat our enemy, despairing of meeting us in open, manly warfare,\r\nbegins to resort to the assassin's tools.\r\n\r\nYour general does not wish you to infer that this is universal, for\r\nhe knows that the great mass of the Confederate army world scorn to\r\nsanction each acts, but he believes it the legitimate consequence\r\nof rebellion against rightful authority.\r\n\r\nWe have met every phase which this war has assumed, and must now be\r\nprepared for it in its last and worst shape, that of assassins and\r\nguerrillas; but woe onto the people who seek to expend their wild\r\npassions in such a manner, for there is but one dread result!\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W. T. Sherman,\r\n\r\nL.  M.  DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of the 17th and morning of the 18th I saw nearly\r\nall the general officers of the army (Schofield, Slocum, Howard,\r\nLogan, Blair), and we talked over the matter of the conference at\r\nBennett's house of the day before, and, without exception, all\r\nadvised me to agree to some terms, for they all dreaded the long\r\nand harassing march in pursuit of a dissolving and fleeing army--\r\na march that might carry us back again over the thousand miles that\r\nwe had just accomplished.  We all knew that if we could bring\r\nJohnston's army to bay, we could destroy it in an hour, but that\r\nwas simply impossible in the country in which we found ourselves.\r\nWe discussed all the probabilities, among which was, whether, if\r\nJohnston made a point of it, I should assent to the escape from the\r\ncountry of Jeff. Davis and his fugitive cabinet; and some one of my\r\ngeneral officers, either Logan or Blair, insisted that, if asked\r\nfor, we should even provide a vessel to carry them to Nassau from\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I again started in the cars to Durham's Station,\r\naccompanied by most of my personal staff, and by Generals Blair,\r\nBarry, Howard, etc., and, reaching General Kilpatrick's\r\nheadquarters at Durham's, we again mounted, and rode, with the same\r\nescort of the day, before, to Bennett's house, reaching there\r\npunctually at noon.  General Johnston had not yet arrived, but a\r\ncourier shortly came, and reported him as on the way.  It must have\r\nbeen nearly 2 p.m.  when he arrived, as before, with General Wade\r\nHampton.  He had halted his escort out of sight, and we again\r\nentered Bennett's house, and I closed the door.  General Johnston\r\nthen assured me that he had authority over all the Confederate\r\narmies, so that they would obey his orders to surrender on the same\r\nterms with his own, but he argued that, to obtain so cheaply this\r\ndesirable result, I ought to give his men and officers some\r\nassurance of their political rights after their surrender.  I\r\nexplained to him that Mr. Lincoln's proclamation of amnesty, of\r\nDecember 8, 1863, still in force; enabled every Confederate soldier\r\nand officer, below the rank of colonel, to obtain an absolute\r\npardon, by simply laying down his arms, and taking the common oath\r\nof allegiance, and that General Grant, in accepting the surrender\r\nof General Lee's army, had extended the same principle to all the\r\nofficers, General Lee included; such a pardon, I understood, would\r\nrestore to them all their rights of citizenship.  But he insisted\r\nthat the officers and men of the Confederate army were\r\nunnecessarily alarmed about this matter, as a sort of bugbear.  He\r\nthen said that Mr. Breckenridge was near at hand, and he thought\r\nthat it would be well for him to be present.  I objected, on the\r\nscore that he was then in Davis's cabinet, and our negotiations\r\nshould be confined strictly to belligerents.  He then said\r\nBreckenridge was a major-general in the Confederate army, and might\r\nsink his character of Secretary of War.  I consented, and he sent\r\none of his staff-officers back, who soon returned with\r\nBreckenridge, and he entered the room.  General Johnston and I then\r\nagain went over the whole ground, and Breckenridge confirmed what\r\nhe had said as to the uneasiness of the Southern officers and\r\nsoldiers about their political rights in case of surrender.  While\r\nwe were in consultation, a messenger came with a parcel of papers,\r\nwhich General Johnston said were from Mr. Reagan,\r\nPostmaster-General.  He and Breckenridge looked over them, and,\r\nafter some side conversation, he handed one of the papers to me.\r\nIt was in Reagan's handwriting, and began with a long preamble and\r\nterms, so general and verbose, that I said they were inadmissible.\r\nThen recalling the conversation of Mr. Lincoln, at City Point, I\r\nsat down at the table, and wrote off the terms, which I thought\r\nconcisely expressed his views and wishes, and explained that I was\r\nwilling to submit these terms to the new President, Mr. Johnson,\r\nprovided that both armies should remain in statu quo until the\r\ntruce therein declared should expire.  I had full faith that\r\nGeneral Johnston would religiously respect the truce, which he did;\r\nand that I would be the gainer, for in the few days it would take\r\nto send the papers to Washington, and receive an answer, I could\r\nfinish the railroad up to Raleigh, and be the better prepared for a\r\nlong chase.\r\n\r\nNeither Mr. Breckenridge nor General Johnston wrote one word of\r\nthat paper.  I wrote it myself, and announced it as the best I\r\ncould do, and they readily assented.\r\n\r\nWhile copies of this paper were being made for signature, the\r\nofficers of our staffs commingled in the yard at Bennett's house,\r\nand were all presented to Generals Johnston and Breckenridge.  All\r\nwithout exception were rejoiced that the war was over, and that in\r\na very few days we could turn our faces toward home.  I remember\r\ntelling Breckenridge that he had better get away, as the feeling of\r\nour people was utterly hostile to the political element of the\r\nSouth, and to him especially, because he was the Vice-President of\r\nthe United States, who had as such announced Mr. Lincoln, of\r\nIllinois, duly and properly elected the President of the United\r\nStates, and yet that he had afterward openly rebelled and taken up\r\narms against the Government.  He answered me that he surely would\r\ngive us no more trouble, and intimated that he would speedily leave\r\nthe country forever.  I may have also advised him that Mr. Davis\r\ntoo should get abroad as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe papers were duly signed; we parted about dark, and my party\r\nreturned to Raleigh.  Early the next morning, April 19th, I\r\ndispatched by telegraph to Morehead City to prepare a fleet-steamer\r\nto carry a messenger to Washington, and sent Major Henry Hitchcock\r\ndown by rail, bearing the following letters, and agreement with\r\nGeneral Johnston, with instructions to be very careful to let\r\nnothing escape him to the greedy newspaper correspondents, but to\r\nsubmit his papers to General Halleck, General Grant, or the\r\nSecretary of War, and to bring me back with all expedition their\r\norders and instructions.\r\n\r\nOn their face they recited that I had no authority to make final\r\nterms involving civil or political questions, but that I submitted\r\nthem to the proper quarter in Washington for their action; and the\r\nletters fully explained that the military situation was such that\r\nthe delay was an advantage to us.  I cared little whether they were\r\napproved, modified, or disapproved in toto; only I wanted\r\ninstructions.  Many of my general officers, among whom, I am almost\r\npositive, were Generals Logan and Blair, urged me to accept the\r\n\"terms,\" without reference at all to Washington, but I preferred\r\nthe latter course:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, IN THE FIELD,\r\nRALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 18, 1886.\r\n\r\nGeneral H.  W.  HALLECK, Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I received your dispatch describing the man Clark,\r\ndetailed to assassinate me.  He had better be in a hurry, or he\r\nwill be too late.\r\n\r\nThe news of Mr. Lincoln's death produced a most intense effect on\r\nour troops.  At first I feared it would lead to excesses; but now\r\nit has softened down, and can easily be guided.  None evinced more\r\nfeeling than General Johnston, who admitted that the act was\r\ncalculated to stain his cause with a dark hue; and he contended\r\nthat the loss was most serious to the South, who had begun to\r\nrealize that Mr. Lincoln was the best friend they had.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that even Mr. Davis was privy to the diabolical\r\nplot, but think it the emanation of a set of young men of the\r\nSouth, who are very devils.  I want to throw upon the South the\r\ncare of this class of men, who will soon be as obnoxious to their\r\nindustrial classes as to us.\r\n\r\nHad I pushed Johnston's army to an extremity, it would have\r\ndispersed, and done infinite mischief.  Johnston informed me that\r\nGeneral Stoneman had been at Salisbury, and was now at Statesville.\r\nI have sent him orders to come to me.\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston also informed me that General Wilson was at\r\nColumbia, Georgia, and he wanted me to arrest his progress.  I leave\r\nthat to you.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if the President sanctions my agreement with Johnston, our\r\ninterest is to cease all destruction.\r\n\r\nPlease give all orders necessary according to the views the\r\nExecutive may take, and influence him, if possible, not to vary the\r\nterms at all, for I have considered every thing, and believe that,\r\nthe Confederate armies once dispersed, we can adjust all else\r\nfairly and well.  I am, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, or Major-General HALLECK,\r\nWashington, D. C.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I inclose herewith a copy of an agreement made this day\r\nbetween General Joseph E. Johnston and myself, which, if approved\r\nby the President of the United States, will produce peace from the\r\nPotomac to the Rio Grande.  Mr. Breckenridge was present at our\r\nconference, in the capacity of major-general, and satisfied me of\r\nthe ability of General Johnston to carry out to their full extent\r\nthe terms of this agreement; and if you will get the President to\r\nsimply indorse the copy, and commission me to carry out the terms,\r\nI will follow them to the conclusion.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that it is an absolute submission of the enemy to\r\nthe lawful authority of the United States, and disperses his armies\r\nabsolutely; and the point to which I attach most importance is,\r\nthat the dispersion and disbandment of these armies is done in such\r\na manner as to prevent their breaking up into guerrilla bands.  On\r\nthe other hand, we can retain just as much of an army as we please.\r\nI agreed to the mode and manner of the surrender of arms set forth,\r\nas it gives the States the means of repressing guerrillas, which we\r\ncould not expect them to do if we stripped them of all arms.\r\n\r\nBoth Generals Johnston and Breckenridge admitted that slavery was\r\ndead, and I could not insist on embracing it in such a paper,\r\nbecause it can be made with the States in detail.  I know that all\r\nthe men of substance South sincerely want peace, and I do not\r\nbelieve they will resort to war again during this century.  I have\r\nno doubt that they will in the future be perfectly subordinate to\r\nthe laws of the United States.  The moment my action in this matter\r\nis approved, I can spare five corps, and will ask for orders to\r\nleave General Schofield here with the Tenth Corps, and to march\r\nmyself with the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, Twentieth, and\r\nTwenty-third Corps via Burkesville and Gordonsville to Frederick or\r\nHagerstown, Maryland, there to be paid and mustered out.\r\n\r\nThe question of finance is now the chief one, and every soldier and\r\nofficer not needed should be got home at work.  I would like to be\r\nable to begin the march north by May 1st.\r\n\r\nI urge, on the part of the President, speedy action, as it is\r\nimportant to get the Confederate armies to their homes as well as\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorandum, or Basis of agreement, made this 18th day of April, A.\r\nD.  1865, near Durham's Station, in the State of North Carolina, by\r\nand between General Joseph E. JOHNSTON, commanding the Confederate\r\nArmy, and Major-General William T. SHERMAN, commanding the army of\r\nthe United States in North Carolina, both present:\r\n\r\n1.  The contending armies now in the field to maintain the statu\r\nquo until notice is given by the commanding general of any one to\r\nits opponent, and reasonable time--say, forty-eight hours--allowed.\r\n\r\n2.  The Confederate armies now in existence to be disbanded and\r\nconducted to their several State capitals, there to deposit their\r\narms and public property in the State Arsenal; and each officer and\r\nman to execute and file an agreement to cease from acts of war, and\r\nto abide the action of the State and Federal authority.  The number\r\nof arms and munitions of war to be reported to the Chief of\r\nOrdnance at Washington City, subject to the future action of the\r\nCongress of the United States, and, in the mean time, to be needed\r\nsolely to maintain peace and order within the borders of the States\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n3.  The recognition, by the Executive of the United States, of the\r\nseveral State governments, on their officers and Legislatures\r\ntaking the oaths prescribed by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and, where conflicting State governments have resulted from\r\nthe war, the legitimacy of all shall be submitted to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States.\r\n\r\n4.  The reestablishment of all the Federal Courts in the several\r\nStates, with powers as defined by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and of the States respectively.\r\n\r\n5.  The people and inhabitants of all the States to be guaranteed,\r\nso far as the Executive can, their political rights and franchises,\r\nas well as their rights of person sad property, as defined by the\r\nConstitution of the United States and of the States respectively.\r\n\r\n6.  The Executive authority of the Government of the United States\r\nnot to disturb any of the people by reason of the late war, so long\r\nas they live in peace and quiet, abstain from acts of armed\r\nhostility, and obey the laws in existence at the place of their\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n7.  In general terms--the war to cease; a general amnesty, so far\r\nas the Executive of the United States can command, on condition of\r\nthe disbandment of the Confederate armies, the distribution of the\r\narms, and the resumption of peaceful pursuits by the officers and\r\nmen hitherto composing said armies.\r\n\r\nNot being fully empowered by our respective principals to fulfill\r\nthese terms, we individually and officially pledge ourselves to\r\npromptly obtain the necessary authority, and to carry out the above\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General,\r\nCommanding Army of the United States in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nJ. E. JOHNSTON, General,\r\nCommanding Confederate States Army in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Hitchcock got off on the morning of the 20th, and I reckoned\r\nthat it would take him four or five days to go to Washington and\r\nback.  During that time the repairs on all the railroads and\r\ntelegraph-lines were pushed with energy, and we also got possession\r\nof the railroad and telegraph from Raleigh to Weldon, in the\r\ndirection of Norfolk.  Meantime the troops remained statu quo, our\r\ncavalry occupying Durham's Station and Chapel Hill.  General\r\nSlocum's head of column was at Aven's Ferry on Cape Fear River, and\r\nGeneral Howard's was strung along the railroad toward Hillsboro';\r\nthe rest of the army was in and about Raleigh.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th I reviewed the Tenth Corps, and was much pleased at the\r\nappearance of General Paines's division of black troops, the first\r\nI had ever seen as a part of an organized army; and on the 21st I\r\nreviewed the Twenty-third Corps, which had been with me to Atlanta,\r\nbut had returned to Nashville had formed an essential part of the\r\narmy which fought at Franklin, and with which General Thomas had\r\ndefeated General Hood in Tennessee.  It had then been transferred\r\nrapidly by rail to Baltimore and Washington by General Grant's\r\norders, and thence by sea to North Carolina.  Nothing of interest\r\nhappened at Raleigh till the evening of April 23d, when Major\r\nHitchcock reported by telegraph his return to Morehead City, and\r\nthat he would come up by rail during the night.  He arrived at 6\r\nA.M., April 24th, accompanied by General Grant and one or two\r\nofficers of his staff, who had not telegraphed the fact of their\r\nbeing on the train, for prudential reasons.  Of course, I was both\r\nsurprised and pleased to see the general, soon learned that my\r\nterms with Johnston had been disapproved, was instructed by him to\r\ngive the forty-eight hours' notice required by the terms of the\r\ntruce, and afterward to proceed to attack or follow him.  I\r\nimmediately telegraphed to General Kilpatrick, at Durham's, to have\r\na mounted courier ready to carry the following message, then on its\r\nway up by rail, to the rebel lines:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 24, 1865 6 A.M.\r\n\r\nGeneral JOHNSTON, commanding Confederate Army, Greensboro':\r\n\r\nYou will take notice that the truce or suspension of hostilities\r\nagreed to between us will cease in forty-eight hours after this is\r\nreceived at your lines, under the first of the articles of\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time I wrote another short note to General Johnston, of\r\nthe same date:\r\n\r\nI have replies from Washington to my communications of April 18th.\r\nI am instructed to limit my operations to your immediate command,\r\nand not to attempt civil negotiations.  I therefore demand the\r\nsurrender of your army on the same terms as were given to General\r\nLee at Appomattox, April 9th instant, purely and simply.\r\n\r\nOf course, both these papers were shown to General Grant at the\r\ntime, before they were sent, and he approved of them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time orders were sent to all parts of the army to be\r\nready to resume the pursuit of the enemy on the expiration of the\r\nforty-eight hours' truce, and messages were sent to General\r\nGillmore (at Hilton Head) to the same effect, with instructions to\r\nget a similar message through to General Wilson, at Macon, by some\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had brought with him, from Washington, written\r\nanswers from the Secretary of War, and of himself, to my\r\ncommunications of the 18th, which I still possess, and here give\r\nthe originals.  They embrace the copy of a dispatch made by Mr.\r\nStanton to General Grant, when he was pressing Lee at Appomattox,\r\nwhich dispatch, if sent me at the same time (as should have been\r\ndone), would have saved a world of trouble.  I did not understand\r\nthat General Grant had come down to supersede me in command, nor\r\ndid he intimate it, nor did I receive these communications as a\r\nserious reproof, but promptly acted on them, as is already shown;\r\nand in this connection I give my answer made to General Grant, at\r\nRaleigh, before I had received any answer from General Johnston to\r\nthe demand for the surrender of his own army, as well as my answer\r\nto Mr. Stanton's letter, of the same date, both written on the\r\nsupposition that I might have to start suddenly in pursuit of\r\nJohnston, and have no other chance to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, April 21, 1865.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General GRANT.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: The memorandum or basis agreed upon between General\r\nSherman and General Johnston having been submitted to the\r\nPresident, they are disapproved.  You will give notice of the\r\ndisapproval to General Sherman, and direct him to resume\r\nhostilities at the earliest moment.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to you by the late President, Abraham\r\nLincoln, on the 3d of March, by my telegraph of that date,\r\naddressed to you, express substantially the views of President\r\nAndrew Johnson, and will be observed by General Sherman.  A copy is\r\nherewith appended.\r\n\r\nThe President desires that you proceed immediately to the\r\nheadquarters of Major-General Sherman, and direct operations\r\nagainst the enemy.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following telegram was received 2 p.m., City Point, March 4,\r\n1865 (from Washington, 12 M., March 3,1865)\r\n\r\n[CIPHER]\r\n\r\nOFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH,\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General GRANT:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have\r\nno conference with General Lee, unless it be for the capitulation\r\nof Lee's army or on solely minor and purely military matters.\r\n\r\nHe instructs me to say that you are not to decide, discuss, or\r\nconfer upon any political question; such questions the President\r\nholds in his own hands, and will submit them to no military\r\nconferences or conventions.\r\n\r\nMeantime you are to press to the utmost your military advantages.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  April 21, 1865.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding Military Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: The basis of agreement entered into between yourself and\r\nGeneral J. E. Johnston, for the disbandment of the Southern army,\r\nand the extension of the authority of the General Government over\r\nall the territory belonging to it, sent for the approval of the\r\nPresident, is received.\r\n\r\nI read it carefully myself before submitting it to the President\r\nand Secretary of War, and felt satisfied that it could not possibly\r\nbe approved.  My reason for these views I will give you at another\r\ntime, in a more extended letter.\r\n\r\nYour agreement touches upon questions of such vital importance\r\nthat, as soon as read, I addressed a note to the Secretary of War,\r\nnotifying him of their receipt, and the importance of immediate\r\naction by the President; and suggested, in view of their\r\nimportance, that the entire Cabinet be called together, that all\r\nmight give an expression of their opinions upon the matter.  The\r\nresult was a disapproval by the President of the basis laid down; a\r\ndisapproval of the negotiations altogether except for the surrender\r\nof the army commanded by General Johnston, and directions to me to\r\nnotify you of this decision.  I cannot do no better than by sending\r\nyou the inclosed copy of a dispatch (penned by the late President,\r\nthough signed by the Secretary of War) in answer to me, on sending\r\na letter received from General Lee, proposing to meet me for the\r\npurpose of submitting the question of peace to a convention of\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nPlease notify General Johnston, immediately on receipt of this, of\r\nthe termination of the truce, and resume hostilities against his\r\narmy at the earliest moment you can, acting in good faith.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 25, 1865.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, present.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I had the honor to receive your letter of April 21st, with\r\ninclosures, yesterday, and was well pleased that you came along, as\r\nyou must have observed that I held the military control so as to\r\nadapt it to any phase the case might assume.\r\n\r\nIt is but just I should record the fact that I made my terms with\r\nGeneral Johnston under the influence of the liberal terms you\r\nextended to the army of General Lee at Appomattox Court-House on\r\nthe 9th, and the seeming policy of our Government, as evinced by\r\nthe call of the Virginia Legislature and Governor back to Richmond,\r\nunder yours and President Lincoln's very eyes.\r\n\r\nIt now appears this last act was done without any consultation with\r\nyou or any knowledge of Mr. Lincoln, but rather in opposition to a\r\nprevious policy well considered.\r\n\r\nI have not the least desire to interfere in the civil policy of our\r\nGovernment, but would shun it as something not to my liking; but\r\noccasions do arise when a prompt seizure of results is forced on\r\nmilitary commanders not in immediate communication with the proper\r\nauthority.  It is probable that the terms signed by General\r\nJohnston and myself were not clear enough on the point, well\r\nunderstood between us, that our negotiations did not apply to any\r\nparties outside the officers and men of the Confederate armies,\r\nwhich could easily have been remedied.\r\n\r\nNo surrender of any army not actually at the mercy of an antagonist\r\nwas ever made without \"terms,\" and these always define the military\r\nstatus of the surrendered.  Thus you stipulated that the officers\r\nand men of Lee's army should not be molested at their homes so long\r\nas they obeyed the laws at the place of their residence.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to discuss these points involved in our recognition\r\nof the State governments in actual existence, but will merely state\r\nmy conclusions, to await the solution of the future.\r\n\r\nSuch action on our part in no manner recognizes for a moment the\r\nso-called Confederate Government, or makes us liable for its debts\r\nor acts.\r\n\r\nThe laws and acts done by the several States during the period of\r\nrebellion are void, because done without the oath prescribed by our\r\nConstitution of the United States, which is a \"condition\r\nprecedent.\"\r\n\r\nWe have a right to, use any sort of machinery to produce military\r\nresults; and it is the commonest thing for military commanders to\r\nuse the civil governments in actual existence as a means to an end.\r\nI do believe we could and can use the present State governments\r\nlawfully, constitutionally, and as the very best possible means to\r\nproduce the object desired, viz., entire and complete submission to\r\nthe lawful authority of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs to punishment for past crimes, that is for the judiciary, and\r\ncan in no manner of way be disturbed by our acts; and, so far as I\r\ncan, I will use my influence that rebels shall suffer all the\r\npersonal punishment prescribed by law, as also the civil\r\nliabilities arising from their past acts.\r\n\r\nWhat we now want is the new form of law by which common men may\r\nregain the positions of industry, so long disturbed by the war.\r\n\r\nI now apprehend that the rebel armies will disperse; and, instead\r\nof dealing with six or seven States, we will have to deal with\r\nnumberless bands of desperadoes, headed by such men as Mosby,\r\nForrest, Red Jackson, and others, who know not and care not for\r\ndanger and its consequences.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 25, 1865.\r\n\r\nHon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: I have been furnished a copy of your letter of April 21st\r\nto General Grant, signifying your disapproval of the terms on which\r\nGeneral Johnston proposed to disarm and disperse the insurgents, on\r\ncondition of amnesty, etc.  I admit my folly in embracing in a\r\nmilitary convention any civil matters; but, unfortunately, such is\r\nthe nature of our situation that they seem inextricably united, and\r\nI understood from you at Savannah that the financial state of the\r\ncountry demanded military success, and would warrant a little\r\nbending to policy.\r\n\r\nWhen I had my conference with General Johnston I had the public\r\nexamples before me of General Grant's terms to Lee's army, and\r\nGeneral Weitzel's invitation to the Virginia Legislature to\r\nassemble at Richmond.\r\n\r\nI still believe the General Government of the United States has\r\nmade a mistake; but that is none of my business--mine is a\r\ndifferent task; and I had flattered myself that, by four years of\r\npatient, unremitting, and successful labor, I deserved no reminder\r\nsuch as is contained in the last paragraph of your letter to\r\nGeneral Grant.  You may assure the President that I heed his\r\nsuggestion.  I am truly, etc.,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, but later, I received an answer from General\r\nJohnston, agreeing to meet me again at Bennett's house the next\r\nday, April 26th, at noon.  He did not even know that General Grant\r\nwas in Raleigh.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant advised me to meet him, and to accept his surrender\r\non the same terms as his with General Lee; and on the 26th I again\r\nwent up to Durham's Station by rail, and rode out to Bennett's\r\nhouse, where we again met, and General Johnston, without\r\nhesitation, agreed to, and we executed, the following final terms:\r\n\r\n\r\nTerms of a Military Convention, entered into this 26th day of\r\nApril, 1865, at Bennett's House, near Durham's Station., North\r\nCarolina, between General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, commanding the\r\nConfederate Army, and Major-General W. T. SHERMAN, commanding the\r\nUnited States Army in North Carolina:\r\n\r\n1.  All acts of war on the part of the troops under General\r\nJohnston's command to cease from this date.\r\n\r\n2.  All arms and public property to be deposited at Greensboro',\r\nand delivered to an ordnance-officer of the United States Army.\r\n\r\n3.  Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate; one\r\ncopy to be retained by the commander of the troops, and the other\r\nto be given to an officer to be designated by General Sherman.\r\nEach officer and man to give his individual obligation in writing\r\nnot to take up arms against the Government of the United States,\r\nuntil properly released from this obligation.\r\n\r\n4.  The side-arms of officers, and their private horses and\r\nbaggage, to be retained by them.\r\n\r\n5.  This being done, all the officers and men will be permitted to\r\nreturn to their homes, not to be disturbed by the United States\r\nauthorities, so long as they observe their obligation and the laws\r\nin force where they may reside.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General,\r\nCommanding United States Forces in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nJ. E. JOHNSTON, General,\r\nCommanding Confederate States Forces in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nApproved:\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI returned to Raleigh the same evening, and, at my request, General\r\nGrant wrote on these terms his approval, and then I thought the\r\nmatter was surely at an end.  He took the original copy, on the\r\n27th returned to Newbern, and thence went back to Washington.\r\n\r\nI immediately made all the orders necessary to carry into effect\r\nthe terms of this convention, devolving on General Schofield the\r\ndetails of granting the parole and making the muster-rolls of\r\nprisoners, inventories of property, etc., of General Johnston's\r\narmy at and about Greensboro', North Carolina, and on General\r\nWilson the same duties in Georgia; but, thus far, I had been\r\ncompelled to communicate with the latter through rebel sources, and\r\nGeneral Wilson was necessarily confused by the conflict of orders\r\nand information.  I deemed it of the utmost importance to establish\r\nfor him a more reliable base of information and supply, and\r\naccordingly resolved to go in person to Savannah for that purpose.\r\nBut, before starting, I received a New York Times, of April 24th,\r\ncontaining the following extraordinary communications:\r\n\r\n\r\n[First Bulletin]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, April 22, 1885.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening a bearer of dispatches arrived from General\r\nSherman.  An agreement for a suspension of hostilities, and a\r\nmemorandum of what is called a basis for peace, had been entered\r\ninto on the 18th inst.   by General Sherman, with the rebel General\r\nJohnston.  Brigadier-General Breckenridge was present at the\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nA cabinet meeting was held at eight o'clock in the evening, at\r\nwhich the action of General Sherman was disapproved by the\r\nPresident, by the Secretary of War, by General Grant, and by every\r\nmember of the cabinet.  General Sherman was ordered to resume\r\nhostilities immediately, and was directed that the instructions\r\ngiven by the late President, in the following telegram, which was\r\npenned by Mr. Lincoln himself, at the Capitol, on the night of the\r\n3d of March, were approved by President Andrew Johnson, and were\r\nreiterated to govern the action of military commanders.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 3d of March, while President Lincoln and his\r\ncabinet were at the Capitol, a telegram from General Grant was\r\nbrought to the Secretary of War, informing him that General Lee had\r\nrequested an interview or conference, to make an arrangement for\r\nterms of peace.  The letter of General Lee was published in a\r\nletter to Davis and to the rebel Congress.  General Grant's\r\ntelegram was submitted to Mr. Lincoln, who, after pondering a few\r\nminutes, took up his pen and wrote with his own hand the following\r\nreply, which he submitted to the Secretary of State and Secretary\r\nof War.  It was then dated, addressed, and signed, by the Secretary\r\nof War, and telegraphed to General Grant:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 3, 1865-12 P.M.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General GRANT:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have\r\nno conference with General Lee, unless it be for the capitulation\r\nof General Lee's army, or on some minor or purely military matter.\r\nHe instructs me to say that you are not to decide, discuss, or\r\nconfer upon any political questions.  Such questions the President\r\nholds in his own hands, and will submit them to no military\r\nconferences or conventions.\r\n\r\nMeantime you are to press to the utmost your military advantages.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orders of General Sherman to General Stoneman to withdraw from\r\nSalisbury and join him will probably open the way for Davis to\r\nescape to Mexico or Europe with his plunder, which is reported to\r\nbe very large, including not only the plunder of the Richmond\r\nbanks, but previous accumulations.\r\n\r\nA dispatch received by this department from Richmond says: \"It is\r\nstated here, by respectable parties, that the amount of specie\r\ntaken south by Jeff.  Davis and his partisans is very large,\r\nincluding not only the plunder of the Richmond banks, but previous\r\naccumulations.  They hope, it is said, to make terms with General\r\nSherman, or some other commander, by which they will be permitted,\r\nwith their effects, including this gold plunder, to go to Mexico or\r\nEurope.  Johnston's negotiations look to this end.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the cabinet meeting last night, General Grant started for\r\nNorth Carolina, to direct operations against Johnston's army.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere followed the terms, and Mr. Stanton's ten reasons for\r\nrejecting them.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this bulletin by authority was an outrage on me,\r\nfor Mr. Stanton had failed to communicate to me in advance, as was\r\nhis duty, the purpose of the Administration to limit our\r\nnegotiations to purely military matters; but, on the contrary, at\r\nSavannah he had authorized me to control all matters, civil and\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nBy this bulletin, he implied that I had previously been furnished\r\nwith a copy of his dispatch of March 3d to General Grant, which was\r\nnot so; and he gave warrant to the impression, which was sown\r\nbroadcast, that I might be bribed by banker's gold to permit Davis\r\nto escape.  Under the influence of this, I wrote General Grant the\r\nfollowing letter of April 28th, which has been published in the\r\nProceedings of the Committee on the Conduct of the War.\r\n\r\nI regarded this bulletin of Mr. Stanton as a personal and official\r\ninsult, which I afterward publicly resented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nIN THE FIELD, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, April 28,1865.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General U. S. GRANT, General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Since you left me yesterday, I have seen the New York\r\nTimes of the 24th, containing a budget of military news,\r\nauthenticated by the signature of the Secretary of War, Hon. E. M.\r\nStanton, which is grouped in such a way as to give the public very\r\nerroneous impressions.  It embraces a copy of the basis of\r\nagreement between myself and General Johnston, of April 18th, with\r\ncomments, which it will be time enough to discuss two or three\r\nyears hence, after the Government has experimented a little more in\r\nthe machinery by which power reaches the scattered people of the\r\nvast country known as the \"South.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, however, I did think that my rank (if not past\r\nservices) entitled me at least to trust that the Secretary of War\r\nwould keep secret what was communicated for the use of none but the\r\ncabinet, until further inquiry could be made, instead of giving\r\npublicity to it along with documents which I never saw, and drawing\r\ntherefrom inferences wide of the truth.  I never saw or had\r\nfurnished me a copy of President Lincoln's dispatch to you of the\r\n3d of March, nor did Mr. Stanton or any human being ever convey to\r\nme its substance, or any thing like it.  On the contrary, I had\r\nseen General Weitzel's invitation to the Virginia Legislature, made\r\nin Mr. Lincoln's very presence, and failed to discover any other\r\nofficial hint of a plan of reconstruction, or any ideas calculated\r\nto allay the fears of the people of the South, after the\r\ndestruction of their armies and civil authorities would leave them\r\nwithout any government whatever.\r\n\r\nWe should not drive a people into anarchy, and it is simply\r\nimpossible for our military power to reach all the masses of their\r\nunhappy country.\r\n\r\nI confess I did not desire to drive General Johnston's army into\r\nbands of armed men, going about without purpose, and capable only\r\nof infinite mischief.  But you saw, on your arrival here, that I\r\nhad my army so disposed that his escape was only possible in a\r\ndisorganized shape; and as you did not choose to \"direct military\r\noperations in this quarter,\" I inferred that you were satisfied\r\nwith the military situation; at all events, the instant I learned\r\nwhat was proper enough, the disapproval of the President, I acted\r\nin such a manner as to compel the surrender of General Johnston's\r\nwhole army on the same terms which you had prescribed to General\r\nLee's army, when you had it surrounded and in your absolute power.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton, in stating that my orders to General Stoneman were\r\nlikely to result in the escape of \"Mr. Davis to Mexico or Europe,\"\r\nis in deep error.  General Stoneman was not at \"Salisbury,\" but had\r\ngone back to \"Statesville.\"  Davis was between us, and therefore\r\nStoneman was beyond him.  By turning toward me he was approaching\r\nDavis, and, had he joined me as ordered, I would have had a mounted\r\nforce greatly needed for Davis's capture, and for other purposes.\r\nEven now I don't know that Mr. Stanton wants Davis caught, and as\r\nmy official papers, deemed sacred, are hastily published to the\r\nworld, it will be imprudent for me to state what has been done in\r\nthat regard.\r\n\r\nAs the editor of the Times has (it may be) logically and fairly\r\ndrawn from this singular document the conclusion that I am\r\ninsubordinate, I can only deny the intention.\r\n\r\nI have never in my life questioned or disobeyed an order, though\r\nmany and many a time have I risked my life, health, and reputation,\r\nin obeying orders, or even hints to execute plans and purposes, not\r\nto my liking.  It is not fair to withhold from me the plans and\r\npolicy of Government (if any there be), and expect me to guess at\r\nthem; for facts and events appear quite different from different\r\nstand-points.  For four years I have been in camp dealing with\r\nsoldiers, and I can assure you that the conclusion at which the\r\ncabinet arrived with such singular unanimity differs from mine.\r\nI conferred freely with the best officers in this army as to the\r\npoints involved in this controversy, and, strange to say, they were\r\nsingularly unanimous in the other conclusion.  They will learn with\r\npain and amazement that I am deemed insubordinate, and wanting in\r\ncommonsense; that I, who for four years have labored day and night,\r\nwinter and summer, who have brought an army of seventy thousand men\r\nin magnificent condition across a country hitherto deemed\r\nimpassable, and placed it just where it was wanted, on the day\r\nappointed, have brought discredit on our Government!  I do not wish\r\nto boast of this, but I do say that it entitled me to the courtesy\r\nof being consulted, before publishing to the world a proposition\r\nrightfully submitted to higher authority for adjudication, and then\r\naccompanied by statements which invited the dogs of the press to be\r\nlet loose upon me.  It is true that non-combatants, men who sleep\r\nin comfort and security while we watch on the distant lines, are\r\nbetter able to judge than we poor soldiers, who rarely see a\r\nnewspaper, hardly hear from our families, or stop long enough to\r\ndraw our pay.  I envy not the task of \"reconstruction,\" and am\r\ndelighted that the Secretary of War has relieved me of it.\r\n\r\nAs you did not undertake to assume the management of the affairs of\r\nthis army, I infer that, on personal inspection, your mind arrived\r\nat a different conclusion from that of the Secretary of War.  I\r\nwill therefore go on to execute your orders to the conclusion, and,\r\nwhen done, will with intense satisfaction leave to the civil\r\nauthorities the execution of the task of which they seem so\r\njealous.  But, as an honest man and soldier, I invite them to go\r\nback to Nashville and follow my path, for they will see some things\r\nand hear some things that may disturb their philosophy.\r\n\r\nWith sincere respect,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\nP. S.--As Mr. Stanton's most singular paper has been published, I\r\ndemand that this also be made public, though I am in no manner\r\nresponsible to the press, but to the law, and my proper superiors.\r\nW. T. S., Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 28th I summoned all the army and corps commanders together\r\nat my quarters in the Governor's mansion at Raleigh, where every\r\nthing was explained to them, and all orders for the future were\r\ncompleted.  Generals Schofield, Terry, and Kilpatrick, were to\r\nremain on duty in the Department of North Carolina, already\r\ncommanded by General Schofield, and the right and left wings were\r\nordered to march under their respective commanding generals North\r\nby easy stages to Richmond, Virginia, there to await my return\r\nfrom the South.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of April, with a part of my personal staff, I proceeded\r\nby rail to Wilmington, North Carolina, where I found Generals\r\nHawley and Potter, and the little steamer Russia, Captain Smith,\r\nawaiting me.  After a short pause in Wilmington, we embarked, and\r\nproceeded down the coast to Port Royal and the Savannah River,\r\nwhich we reached on the 1st of May.  There Captain Hoses, who had\r\njust come from General Wilson at Macon, met us, bearing letters for\r\nme and General Grant, in which General Wilson gave a brief summary\r\nof his operations up to date.  He had marched from Eastport,\r\nMississippi, five hundred miles in thirty days, took six thousand\r\nthree hundred prisoners, twenty-three colors, and one hundred and\r\nfifty-six guns, defeating Forrest, scattering the militia, and\r\ndestroying every railroad, iron establishment, and factory, in\r\nNorth Alabama and Georgia.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in the highest terms of his cavalry, as \"cavalry,\"\r\nclaiming that it could not be excelled, and he regarded his corps\r\nas a model for modern cavalry in organization, armament, and\r\ndiscipline.  Its strength was given at thirteen thousand five\r\nhundred men and horses on reaching Macon.  Of course I was\r\nextremely gratified at his just confidence, and saw that all he\r\nwanted for efficient action was a sure base of supply, so that he\r\nneed no longer depend for clothing, ammunition, food, and forage,\r\non the country, which, now that war had ceased, it was our solemn\r\nduty to protect, instead of plunder.  I accordingly ordered the\r\ncaptured steamer Jeff. Davis to be loaded with stores, to proceed\r\nat once up the Savannah River to Augusta, with a small detachment\r\nof troops to occupy the arsenal, and to open communication with\r\nGeneral Wilson at Macon; and on the next day, May 2d, this steamer\r\nwas followed by another with a fall cargo of clothing, sugar,\r\ncoffee, and bread, sent from Hilton Head by the department\r\ncommander, General Gillmore, with a stronger guard commanded by\r\nGeneral Molineux.  Leaving to General Gillmore, who was present,\r\nand in whose department General Wilson was, to keep up the supplies\r\nat Augusta, and to facilitate as far as possible General Wilson's\r\noperations inland, I began my return on the 2d of May.  We went\r\ninto Charleston Harbor, passing the ruins of old Forts Moultrie and\r\nSumter without landing.  We reached the city of Charleston, which\r\nwas held by part of the division of General John P.  Hatch, the\r\nsame that we had left at Pocotaligo.  We walked the old familiar\r\nstreets--Broad, King, Meeting, etc.--but desolation and ruin were\r\neverywhere.  The heart of the city had been burned during the\r\nbombardment, and the rebel garrison at the time of its final\r\nevacuation had fired the railroad-depots, which fire had spread,\r\nand was only subdued by our troops after they had reached the city.\r\n\r\nI inquired for many of my old friends, but they were dead or gone,\r\nand of them all I only saw a part of the family of Mrs. Pettigru.\r\nI doubt whether any city was ever more terribly punished than\r\nCharleston, but, as her people had for years been agitating for war\r\nand discord, and had finally inaugurated the civil war by an attack\r\non the small and devoted garrison of Major Anderson, sent there by\r\nthe General Government to defend them, the judgment of the world\r\nwill be, that Charleston deserved the fate that befell her.\r\nResuming our voyage, we passed into Cape Fear River by its mouth at\r\nFort Caswell and Smithville, and out by the new channel at Fort\r\nFisher, and reached Morehead City on the 4th of May.  We found\r\nthere the revenue-cutter Wayanda, on board of which were the Chief-\r\nJustice, Mr. Chase, and his daughter Nettie, now Mrs. Hoyt.  The\r\nChief-Justice at that moment was absent on a visit to Newbern, but\r\ncame back the next day.  Meantime, by means of the telegraph, I was\r\nagain in correspondence with General Schofield at Raleigh.  He had\r\nmade great progress in paroling the officers and men of Johnston's\r\narmy at Greensboro', but was embarrassed by the utter confusion and\r\nanarchy that had resulted from a want of understanding on many\r\nminor points, and on the political questions that had to be met at\r\nthe instant.  In order to facilitate the return to their homes of\r\nthe Confederate officers and men, he had been forced to make with\r\nGeneral Johnston the following supplemental terms, which were of\r\ncourse ratified and approved:\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY CONVENTION OF APRIL 26, 1865.\r\nSUPPLEMENTAL TERMS.\r\n\r\n1.  The field transportation to be loaned to the troops for their\r\nmarch to their homes, and for subsequent use in their industrial\r\npursuits.  Artillery-horses may be used in field-transportation, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n2.  Each brigade or separate body to retain a number of arms equal\r\nto one-seventh of its effective strength, which, when the troops\r\nreach the capitals of their states, will be disposed of as the\r\ngeneral commanding the department may direct.\r\n\r\n3.  Private horses, and other private property of both officers and\r\nmen, to be retained by them.\r\n\r\n4.  The commanding general of the Military Division of West\r\nMississippi, Major-General Canby, will be requested to give\r\ntransportation by water, from Mobile or New Orleans, to the troops\r\nfrom Arkansas and Texas.\r\n\r\n5.  The obligations of officers and soldiers to be signed by their\r\nimmediate commanders.\r\n\r\n6.  Naval forces within the limits of General Johnston's command to\r\nbe included in the terms of this convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. M. SCHOFIELD, Major-General,\r\nCommanding United States Forces in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. E. JOHNSTON, General,\r\nCommanding Confederate States Forces in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total number of prisoners of war parolled by\r\nGeneral Schofield, at Greensboro', North Carolina,\r\nas afterward officially reported, amounted to ........ 38,817\r\n\r\nAnd the total number who surrendered in Georgia\r\nand Florida, as reported by General J.  H.  Wilson,\r\nwas .................................................. 52,458\r\n\r\nAggregate surrendered under the capitulation of\r\nGeneral J. E. Johnston ............................... 89,270\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th I also received from General Schofield\r\nthis dispatch:\r\n\r\n\r\nRALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, May 5, 1866.\r\n\r\nTo Major-General W: T. SHERMAN, Morehead City:\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant was here, as you doubtless recollect, he said\r\nthe lines (for trade and intercourse) had been extended to embrace\r\nthis and other States south.  The order, it seems, has been\r\nmodified so as to include only Virginia and Tennessee.  I think it\r\nwould be an act of wisdom to open this State to trade at once.\r\n\r\nI hope the Government will make known its policy as to the organs\r\nof State government without delay.  Affairs must necessarily be in\r\na very unsettled state until that is done.  The people are now in a\r\nmood to accept almost anything which promises a definite\r\nsettlement.  \"What is to be done with the freedmen?\" is the\r\nquestion of all, and it is the all important question.  It requires\r\nprompt and wise notion to prevent the negroes from becoming a huge\r\nelephant on our hands.  If I am to govern this State, it is\r\nimportant for me to know it at once.  If another is to be sent\r\nhere, it cannot be done too soon, for he probably will undo the\r\nmost that I shall have done.  I shall be glad to hear from you\r\nfully, when you have time to write.  I will send your message to\r\nGeneral Wilson at once.\r\n\r\nJ. M. SCHOFIELD, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was utterly without instructions from any source on the points of\r\nGeneral Schofield's inquiry, and under the existing state of facts\r\ncould not even advise him, for by this time I was in possession of\r\nthe second bulletin of Mr. Stanton, published in all the Northern\r\npapers, with comments that assumed that I was a common traitor and\r\na public enemy; and high officials had even instructed my own\r\nsubordinates to disobey my lawful orders.  General Halleck, who had\r\nso long been in Washington as the chief of staff, had been sent on\r\nthe 21st of April to Richmond, to command the armies of the Potomac\r\nand James, in place of General Grant, who had transferred his\r\nheadquarters to the national capital, and he (General Halleck) was\r\ntherefore in supreme command in Virginia, while my command over\r\nNorth Carolina had never been revoked or modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Second Bulletin.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, April 27 9.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nTo Major-General DIX:\r\n\r\nThe department has received the following dispatch from Major-\r\nGeneral Halleck, commanding the Military Division of the James.\r\nGenerals Canby and Thomas were instructed some days ago that\r\nSherman's arrangements with Johnston were disapproved by the\r\nPresident, and they were ordered to disregard it and push the enemy\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nE.  M.  STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, VIRGINIA, April 26-9.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nHON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nGenerals Meade, Sheridan, and Wright, are acting under orders to\r\npay no regard to any truce or orders of General Sherman respecting\r\nhostilities, on the ground that Sherman's agreement could bind his\r\ncommand only, and no other.\r\n\r\nThey are directed to push forward, regardless of orders from any\r\none except from General Grant, and cut off Johnston's retreat.\r\n\r\nBeauregard has telegraphed to  Danville that a new arrangement has\r\nbeen made with Sherman, and that the advance of the Sixth Corps was\r\nto be suspended until further orders.\r\n\r\nI have telegraphed back to obey no orders of Sherman, but to push\r\nforward as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe bankers here have information to-day that Jeff. Davis's specie\r\nis moving south from Goldsboro', in wagons, as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nI suggest that orders be telegraphed, through General Thomas, that\r\nWilson obey no orders from Sherman, and notifying him and Canby,\r\nand all commanders on the Mississippi, to take measures to\r\nintercept the rebel chiefs and their plunder.\r\n\r\nThe specie taken with them is estimated here at from six to\r\nthirteen million dollars.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, before the Committee on the Conduct of the War, in\r\nWashington, on the 22d of May, I testified fully on this whole\r\nmatter, and will abide the judgment of the country on the\r\npatriotism and wisdom of my public conduct in this connection.\r\nGeneral Halleck's measures to capture General Johnston's army,\r\nactually surrendered to me at the time, at Greensboro', on the 26th\r\nof April, simply excited my contempt for a judgment such as he was\r\nsupposed to possess.  The assertion that Jeff. Davis's specie-\r\ntrain, of six to thirteen million dollars, was reported to be\r\nmoving south from Goldsboro' in wagons as fast as possible, found\r\nplenty of willing ears, though my army of eighty thousand men had\r\nbeen at Goldsboro' from March 22d to the date of his dispatch,\r\nApril 26th; and such a train would have been composed of from\r\nfifteen to thirty-two six-mule teams to have hauled this specie,\r\neven if it all were in gold.  I suppose the exact amount of\r\ntreasure which Davis had with him is now known to a cent; some of\r\nit was paid to his escort, when it disbanded at and near\r\nWashington, Georgia, and at the time of his capture he had a small\r\nparcel of gold and silver coin, not to exceed ten thousand dollars,\r\nwhich is now retained in the United States Treasury-vault at\r\nWashington, and shown to the curious.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen millions of treasure, with which Jeff. Davis was to\r\ncorrupt our armies and buy his escape, dwindled down to the\r\ncontents of a hand-valise!\r\n\r\nTo say that I was merely angry at the tone and substance of these\r\npublished bulletins of the War Department, would hardly express the\r\nstate of my feelings.  I was outraged beyond measure, and was\r\nresolved to resent the insult, cost what it might.  I went to the\r\nWayanda and showed them to Mr. Chase, with whom I had a long and\r\nfrank conversation, during which he explained to me the confusion\r\ncaused in Washington by the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, the\r\nsudden accession to power of Mr. Johnson, who was then supposed to\r\nbe bitter and vindictive in his feelings toward the South, and the\r\nwild pressure of every class of politicians to enforce on the new\r\nPresident their pet schemes.  He showed me a letter of his own,\r\nwhich was in print, dated Baltimore, April 11th, and another of\r\nApril 12th, addressed to the President, urging him to recognize the\r\nfreedmen as equal in all respects to the whites.  He was the first\r\nman, of any authority or station, who ever informed me that the\r\nGovernment of the United States would insist on extending to the\r\nformer slaves of the South the elective franchise, and he gave as a\r\nreason the fact that the slaves, grateful for their freedom, for\r\nwhich they were indebted to the armies and Government of the North,\r\nwould, by their votes, offset the disaffected and rebel element of\r\nthe white population of the South.  At that time quite a storm was\r\nprevailing at sea, outside, and our two vessels lay snug at the\r\nwharf at Morehead City.  I saw a good deal of Mr. Chase, and\r\nseveral notes passed between us, of which I have the originals yet.\r\nAlways claiming that the South had herself freed all her slaves by\r\nrebellion, and that Mr. Lincoln's proclamation of freedom (of\r\nSeptember 22, 1862) was binding on all officers of the General\r\nGovernment, I doubted the wisdom of at once clothing them with the\r\nelective franchise, without some previous preparation and\r\nqualification; and then realized the national loss in the death at\r\nthat critical moment of Mr. Lincoln, who had long pondered over the\r\ndifficult questions involved, who, at all events, would have been\r\nhonest and frank, and would not have withheld from his army\r\ncommanders at least a hint that would have been to them a guide.\r\nIt was plain to me, therefore, that the manner of his assassination\r\nhad stampeded the civil authorities in Washington, had unnerved\r\nthem, and that they were then undecided as to the measures\r\nindispensably necessary to prevent anarchy at the South.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May the storm subsided, and we put to sea, Mr. Chase\r\nto the south, on his proposed tour as far as New Orleans, and I for\r\nJames River.  I reached Fortress Monroe on the 8th, and thence\r\ntelegraphed my arrival to General Grant, asking for orders.  I\r\nfound at Fortress Monroe a dispatch from General Halleck,\r\nprofessing great friendship, and inviting me to accept his\r\nhospitality at Richmond.  I answered by a cipher-dispatch that I\r\nhad seen his dispatch to Mr. Stanton, of April 26th, embraced in\r\nthe second bulletin, which I regarded as insulting, declined his\r\nhospitality, and added that I preferred we should not meet as I\r\npassed through Richmond.  I thence proceeded to City Point in the\r\nRussia, and on to Manchester, opposite Richmond, via Petersburg, by\r\nrail.  I found that both wings of the army had arrived from\r\nRaleigh, and were in camp in and around Manchester, whence I again\r\ntelegraphed General Grant, an the 9th of May, for orders, and also\r\nreported my arrival to General Halleck by letter.  I found that\r\nGeneral Halleck had ordered General Davis's corps (the Fourteenth)\r\nfor review by himself.  This I forbade.  All the army knew of the\r\ninsult that had been made me by the Secretary of War and General\r\nHalleck, and watched me closely to see if I would tamely submit.\r\nDuring the 9th I made a full and complete report of all these\r\nevents, from the last report made at Goldsboro' up to date, and the\r\nnext day received orders to continue the march to Alexandria, near\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 11th we crossed the pontoon-bridge at\r\nRichmond, marched through that city, and out on the Hanover\r\nCourt House road, General Slocum's left wing leading. The right wing\r\n(General Logan) followed the next day, viz., the 12th.  Meantime,\r\nGeneral O. O. Howard had been summoned to Washington to take charge\r\nof the new Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, and,\r\nfrom that time till the army was finally disbanded, General John A.\r\nLogan was in command of the right wing, and of the Army of the\r\nTennessee.  The left wing marched through Hanover Court House, and\r\nthence took roads well to the left by Chilesburg; the Fourteenth\r\nCorps by New Market and Culpepper, Manassas, etc.; the Twentieth\r\nCorps by Spotsylvania Court-House and Chancellorsville.  The right\r\nwing followed the more direct road by Fredericksburg.  On my way\r\nnorth I endeavored to see as much of the battle-fields of the Army\r\nof the Potomac as I could, and therefore shifted from one column to\r\nthe other, visiting en route Hanover Court-House, Spotsylvania,\r\nFredericksburg, Dumfries, etc., reaching Alexandria during the\r\nafternoon of May 19th, and pitched my camp by the road side, about\r\nhalf-way between Alexandria and the Long Bridge.  During the same\r\nand next day the whole army reached Alexandria, and camped round\r\nabout it; General Meade's Army of the Potomac had possession of the\r\ncamps above, opposite Washington and Georgetown.  The next day (by\r\ninvitation) I went over to Washington and met many friends--among\r\nthem General Grant and President Johnson.  The latter occupied\r\nrooms in the house on the corner of Fifteenth and H Streets,\r\nbelonging to Mr. Hooper.  He was extremely cordial to me, and\r\nknowing that I was chafing under the censures of the War\r\nDepartment, especially of the two war bulletins of Mr. Stanton, he\r\nvolunteered to say that he knew of neither of them till seen in the\r\nnewspapers, and that Mr. Stanton had shown neither to him nor to\r\nany of his associates in the cabinet till they were published.\r\nNearly all the members of the cabinet made similar assurances to me\r\nafterward, and, as Mr. Stanton made no friendly advances, and\r\noffered no word of explanation or apology, I declined General\r\nGrant's friendly offices for a reconciliation, but, on the\r\ncontrary, resolved to resent what I considered an insult, as\r\npublicly as it was made.  My brother, Senator Sherman, who was Mr.\r\nStanton's neighbor, always insisted that Mr. Stanton had been\r\nfrightened by the intended assassination of himself, and had become\r\nembittered thereby.  At all events, I found strong military guards\r\naround his house, as well as all the houses occupied by the cabinet\r\nand by the principal officers of Government; and a sense of\r\ninsecurity pervaded Washington, for which no reason existed.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th I received a copy of War Department Special Order No.\r\n239, Adjutant-General's office, of May 18th, ordering a grand\r\nreview, by the President and cabinet, of all the armies then near\r\nWashington; General Meade's to occur on Tuesday, May 23d, mine on\r\nWednesday, the 24th; and on the 20th I made the necessary orders\r\nfor my part.  Meantime I had also arranged (with General Grant's\r\napproval) to remove after the review, my armies from the south side\r\nof the Potomac to the north; both for convenience and because our\r\nmen had found that the grounds assigned them had been used so long\r\nfor camps that they were foul and unfit.\r\n\r\nBy invitation I was on the reviewing-stand, and witnessed the\r\nreview of the Army of the Potomac (on the 23d), commanded by\r\nGeneral Meade in person.  The day was beautiful, and the pageant\r\nwas superb.  Washington was full of strangers, who filled the\r\nstreets in holiday-dress, and every house was decorated with flags.\r\nThe army marched by divisions in close column around the Capitol,\r\ndown Pennsylvania Avenue, past the President and cabinet, who\r\noccupied a large stand prepared for the occasion, directly in front\r\nof the White House.\r\n\r\nI had telegraphed to Lancaster for Mrs. Sherman, who arrived that\r\nday, accompanied by her father, the Hon. Thomas Ewing, and my son\r\nTom, then eight years old.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon and night of the 23d, the Fifteenth, Seventeenth,\r\nand Twentieth Corps, crossed Long Bridge, bivouacked in the\r\nstreets about the Capitol, and the Fourteenth Corps closed up to\r\nthe bridge.  The morning of the 24th was extremely beautiful, and\r\nthe ground was in splendid order for our review.  The streets were\r\nfilled with people to see the pageant, armed with bouquets of\r\nflowers for their favorite regiments or heroes, and every thing was\r\npropitious.  Punctually at 9 A.M. the signal-gun was fired, when in\r\nperson, attended by General Howard and all my staff, I rode slowly\r\ndown Pennsylvania Avenue, the crowds of men, women, and children,\r\ndensely lining the sidewalks, and almost obstructing the way.  We\r\nwere followed close by General Logan and the head of the Fifteenth\r\nCorps.  When I reached the Treasury-building, and looked back, the\r\nsight was simply magnificent.  The column was compact, and the\r\nglittering muskets looked like a solid mass of steel, moving with\r\nthe regularity of a pendulum.  We passed the Treasury building, in\r\nfront of which and of the White House was an immense throng of\r\npeople, for whom extensive stands had been prepared on both sides\r\nof the avenue.  As I neared the brick-house opposite the lower\r\ncorner of Lafayette Square, some one asked me to notice Mr. Seward,\r\nwho, still feeble and bandaged for his wounds, had been removed\r\nthere that he might behold the troops.  I moved in that direction\r\nand took off my hat to Mr. Seward, who sat at an upper window.  He\r\nrecognized the salute, returned it, and then we rode on steadily\r\npast the President, saluting with our swords.  All on his stand\r\narose and acknowledged the salute.  Then, turning into the gate of\r\nthe presidential grounds, we left our horses with orderlies, and\r\nwent upon the stand, where I found Mrs. Sherman, with her father\r\nand son.  Passing them, I shook hands with the President, General\r\nGrant, and each member of the cabinet.  As I approached Mr.\r\nStanton, he offered me his hand, but I declined it publicly, and\r\nthe fact was universally noticed. I then took my post on the left\r\nof the President, and for six hours and a half stood, while the\r\narmy passed in the order of the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, Twentieth,\r\nand Fourteenth Corps. It was, in my judgment, the most magnificent\r\narmy in existence--sixty-five thousand men, in splendid physique,\r\nwho had just completed a march of nearly two thousand miles in a\r\nhostile country, in good drill, and who realized that they were\r\nbeing closely scrutinized by thousands of their fellow-countrymen\r\nand by foreigners.  Division after division passed, each commander\r\nof an army corps or division coming on the stand during the passage\r\nof his command, to be presented to the President, cabinet, and\r\nspectators.  The steadiness and firmness of the tread, the careful\r\ndress on the guides, the uniform intervals between the companies,\r\nall eyes directly to the front, and the tattered and bullet-ridden\r\nflags, festooned with flowers, all attracted universal notice.\r\nMany good people, up to that time, had looked upon our Western army\r\nas a sort of mob; but the world then saw, and recognized the fact,\r\nthat it was an army in the proper sense, well organized, well\r\ncommanded and disciplined; and there was no wonder that it had\r\nswept through the South like a tornado.  For six hours and a half\r\nthat strong tread of the Army of the West resounded along\r\nPennsylvania Avenue; not a soul of that vast crowd of spectators\r\nleft his place; and, when the rear of the column had passed by,\r\nthousands of the spectators still lingered to express their sense\r\nof confidence in the strength of a Government which could claim\r\nsuch an army.\r\n\r\nSome little scenes enlivened the day, and called for the laughter\r\nand cheers of the crowd.  Each division was followed by six\r\nambulances, as a representative of its baggage-train.  Some of the\r\ndivision commanders had added, by way of variety, goats, milch-\r\ncows, and pack-mules, whose loads consisted of game-cocks, poultry,\r\nhams, etc., and some of them had the families of freed slaves\r\nalong, with the women leading their children.  Each division was\r\npreceded by its corps of black pioneers, armed with picks and\r\nspades.  These marched abreast in double ranks, keeping perfect\r\ndress and step, and added much to the interest of the occasion.  On\r\nthe whole, the grand review was a splendid success, and was a\r\nfitting conclusion to the campaign and the war.\r\n\r\nI will now conclude by a copy of my general orders taking leave of\r\nthe army, which ended my connection with the war, though I\r\nafterward visited and took a more formal leave of the officers and\r\nmen on July 4, 1865, at Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[SPECIAL FIELD ORDERS NO. 76]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nIN THE FIELD, WASHINGTON, D.C. May 30, 1865\r\n\r\nThe general commanding announces to the Armies of the Tennessee and\r\nGeorgia that the time has come for us to part.  Our work is done,\r\nand armed enemies no longer defy us.  Some of you will go to your\r\nhomes, and others will be retained in military service till further\r\norders.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we are all about to separate, to mingle with the civil\r\nworld, it becomes a pleasing duty to recall to mind the situation\r\nof national affairs when, but little more than a year ago, we were\r\ngathered about the cliffs of Lookout Mountain, and all the future\r\nwas wrapped in doubt and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThree armies had come together from distant fields, with separate\r\nhistories, yet bound by one common cause--the union of our country,\r\nand the perpetuation of the Government of our inheritance.  There\r\nis no need to recall to your memories Tunnel Hill, with Rocky-Face\r\nMountain and Buzzard-Roost Gap, and the ugly forts of Dalton\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nWe were in earnest, and paused not for danger and difficulty, but\r\ndashed through Snake-Creek Gap and fell on Resaca; then on to the\r\nEtowah, to Dallas, Kenesaw; and the heats of summer found us on the\r\nbanks of the Chattahoochee, far from home, and dependent on a\r\nsingle road for supplies.  Again we were not to be held back by any\r\nobstacle, and crossed over and fought four hard battles for the\r\npossession of the citadel of Atlanta.  That was the crisis of our\r\nhistory.  A doubt still clouded our future, but we solved the\r\nproblem, destroyed Atlanta, struck boldly across the State of\r\nGeorgia, severed all the main arteries of life to our enemy, and\r\nChristmas found us at Savannah.\r\n\r\nWaiting there only long enough to fill our wagons, we again began a\r\nmarch which, for peril, labor, and results, will compare with any\r\never made by an organized army.  The floods of the Savannah, the\r\nswamps of the Combahee and Edisto, the \"high hills\" and rocks of\r\nthe Santee, the flat quagmires of the Pedee and Cape Fear Rivers,\r\nwere all passed in midwinter, with its floods and rains, in the\r\nface of an accumulating enemy; and, after the battles of\r\nAverysboro' and Bentonsville, we once more came out of the\r\nwilderness, to meet our friends at Goldsboro'.  Even then we paused\r\nonly long enough to get new clothing, to reload our wagons, again\r\npushed on to Raleigh and beyond, until we met our enemy suing for\r\npeace, instead of war, and offering to submit to the injured laws\r\nof his and our country.  As long as that enemy was defiant, nor\r\nmountains nor rivers, nor swamps, nor hunger, nor cold, had checked\r\nus; but when he, who had fought us hard and persistently, offered\r\nsubmission, your general thought it wrong to pursue him farther,\r\nand negotiations followed, which resulted, as you all know, in his\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nHow far the operations of this army contributed to the final\r\noverthrow of the Confederacy and the peace which now dawns upon us,\r\nmust be judged by others, not by us; but that you have done all\r\nthat men could do has been admitted by those in authority, and we\r\nhave a right to join in the universal joy that fills our land\r\nbecause the war is over, and our Government stands vindicated\r\nbefore the world by the joint action of the volunteer armies and\r\nnavy of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo such as remain in the service, your general need only remind you\r\nthat success in the past was due to hard work and discipline, and\r\nthat the same work and discipline are equally important in the\r\nfuture.  To such as go home, he will only say that our favored\r\ncountry is so grand, so extensive, so diversified in climate, soil,\r\nand productions, that every man may find a home and occupation\r\nsuited to his taste; none should yield to the natural impatience\r\nsure to result from our past life of excitement and adventure.  You\r\nwill be invited to seek new adventures abroad; do not yield to the\r\ntemptation, for it will lead only to death and disappointment.\r\n\r\nYour general now bids you farewell, with the full belief that, as\r\nin war you have been good soldiers, so in peace you will make good\r\ncitizens; and if, unfortunately, new war should arise in our\r\ncountry, \"Sherman's army\" will be the first to buckle on its old\r\narmor, and come forth to defend and maintain the Government of our\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major-General W.

General Scott\r\ntold me on my arrival at New York, as early as 1850, that the\r\ncountry was on the eve of civil war; and the Southern politicians\r\nopenly asserted that it was their purpose to accept as a casus\r\nbelli the election of General Fremont in 1856; but, fortunately or\r\nunfortunately, he was beaten by Mr. Buchanan, which simply\r\npostponed its occurrence for four years.  Mr. Seward had also\r\npublicly declared that no government could possibly exist half\r\nslave and half free; yet the Government made no military\r\npreparation, and the Northern people generally paid no attention,\r\ntook no warning of its coming, and would not realize its existence\r\ntill Fort Sumter was fired on by batteries of artillery, handled by\r\ndeclared enemies, from the surrounding islands and from the city of\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bragg, who certainly was a man of intelligence, and who, in\r\nearly life, ridiculed a thousand times, in my hearing, the threats\r\nof the people of South Carolina to secede from the Federal Union,\r\nsaid to me in New Orleans, in February, 1861, that he was convinced\r\nthat the feeling between the slave and free States had become so\r\nembittered that it was better to part in peace; better to part\r\nanyhow; and, as a separation was inevitable, that the South should\r\nbegin at once, because the possibility of a successful effort was\r\nyearly lessened by the rapid and increasing inequality between the\r\ntwo sections, from the fact that all the European immigrants were\r\ncoming to the Northern States and Territories, and none to the\r\nSouthern.\r\n\r\nThe slave population m 1860 was near four millions, and the money\r\nvalue thereof not far from twenty-five hundred million dollars.\r\nNow, ignoring the moral side of the question, a cause that\r\nendangered so vast a moneyed interest was an adequate cause of\r\nanxiety and preparation, and the Northern leaders surely ought to\r\nhave foreseen the danger and prepared for it.  After the election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln in 1860, there was no concealment of the declaration\r\nand preparation for war in the South.  In Louisiana, as I have\r\nrelated, men were openly enlisted, officers were appointed, and war\r\nwas actually begun, in January, 1861.  The forts at the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi were seized, and occupied by garrisons that hauled\r\ndown the United States flag and hoisted that of the State.  The\r\nUnited States Arsenal at Baton Rouge was captured by New Orleans\r\nmilitia, its garrison ignominiously sent off, and the contents of\r\nthe arsenal distributed.  These were as much acts of war as was the\r\nsubsequent firing on Fort Sumter, yet no public notice was taken\r\nthereof; and when, months afterward, I came North, I found not one\r\nsingle sign of preparation.  It was for this reason, somewhat, that\r\nthe people of the South became convinced that those of the North\r\nwere pusillanimous and cowardly, and the Southern leaders were\r\nthereby enabled to commit their people to the war, nominally in\r\ndefense of their slave property.  Up to the hour of the firing on\r\nFort Sumter, in April, 1861, it does seem to me that our public\r\nmen, our politicians, were blamable for not sounding the note of\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nThen, when war was actually begun, it was by a call for seventy-\r\nfive thousand \"ninety-day\" men, I suppose to fulfill Mr. Seward's\r\nprophecy that the war would last but ninety days.\r\n\r\nThe earlier steps by our political Government were extremely\r\nwavering and weak, for which an excuse can be found in the fact\r\nthat many of the Southern representatives remained in Congress,\r\nsharing in the public councils, and influencing legislation.  But\r\nas soon as Mr. Lincoln was installed, there was no longer any\r\nreason why Congress and the cabinet should have hesitated.  They\r\nshould have measured the cause, provided the means, and left the\r\nExecutive to apply the remedy.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Mr. Lincoln's inauguration, viz., March 4, 1861, the\r\nRegular Army, by law, consisted of two regiments of dragoons, two\r\nregiments of cavalry, one regiment of mounted rifles, four\r\nregiments of artillery, and ten regiments of infantry, admitting of\r\nan aggregate strength of thirteen thousand and twenty-four officers\r\nand men.  On the subsequent 4th of May the President, by his own\r\norders (afterward sanctioned by Congress), added a regiment of\r\ncavalry, a regiment of artillery, and eight regiments of infantry,\r\nwhich, with the former army, admitted of a strength of thirty-nine\r\nthousand nine hundred and seventy-three; but at no time during the\r\nwar did the Regular Army attain a strength of twenty-five thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nTo the new regiments of infantry was given an organization\r\ndiffering from any that had heretofore prevailed in this country--\r\nof three battalions of eight companies each; but at no time did\r\nmore than one of these regiments attain its full standard; nor in\r\nthe vast army of volunteers that was raised during the war were any\r\nof the regiments of infantry formed on the three-battalion system,\r\nbut these were universally single battalions of ten companies; so\r\nthat, on the reorganization of the Regular Army at the close of the\r\nwar, Congress adopted the form of twelve companies for the\r\nregiments of cavalry and artillery, and that of ten companies for\r\nthe infantry, which is the present standard.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Regular Army will naturally form the standard of\r\norganization for any increase or for new regiments of volunteers,\r\nit becomes important to study this subject in the light of past\r\nexperience, and to select that form which is best for peace as well\r\nas war.\r\n\r\nA cavalry regiment is now composed of twelve companies, usually\r\ndivided into six squadrons, of two companies each, or better\r\nsubdivided into three battalions of four companies each.  This is\r\nan excellent form, easily admitting of subdivision as well as union\r\ninto larger masses.\r\n\r\nA single battalion of four companies, with a field-officer, will\r\ncompose a good body for a garrison, for a separate expedition, or\r\nfor a detachment; and, in war, three regiments would compose a good\r\nbrigade, three brigades a division, and three divisions a strong\r\ncavalry corps, such as was formed and fought by Generals Sheridan\r\nand Wilson during the war.\r\n\r\nIn the artillery arm, the officers differ widely in their opinion\r\nof the true organization.  A single company forms a battery, and\r\nhabitually each battery acts separately, though sometimes several\r\nare united or \"massed;\" but these always act in concert with\r\ncavalry or infantry.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the regimental organization for artillery has always\r\nbeen maintained in this country for classification and promotion.\r\nTwelve companies compose a regiment, and, though probably no\r\ncolonel ever commanded his full regiment in the form of twelve\r\nbatteries, yet in peace they occupy our heavy sea-coast forts or\r\nact as infantry; then the regimental organization is both necessary\r\nand convenient.\r\n\r\nBut the infantry composes the great mass of all armies, and the\r\ntrue form of the regiment or unit has been the subject of infinite\r\ndiscussion; and, as I have stated, during the civil war the\r\nregiment was a single battalion of ten companies.  In olden times\r\nthe regiment was composed of eight battalion companies and two\r\nflank companies.  The first and tenth companies were armed with\r\nrifles, and were styled and used as \"skirmishers;\" but during 'the\r\nwar they were never used exclusively for that special purpose, and\r\nin fact no distinction existed between them and the other eight\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThe ten-company organization is awkward in practice, and I am\r\nsatisfied that the infantry regiment should have the same identical\r\norganization as exists for the cavalry and artillery, viz., twelve\r\ncompanies, so as to be susceptible of division into three\r\nbattalions of four companies each.\r\n\r\nThese companies should habitually be about a hundred one men\r\nstrong, giving twelve hundred to a regiment, which in practice\r\nwould settle down to about one thousand men.\r\n\r\nThree such regiments would compose a brigade, three brigades a\r\ndivision, and three divisions a corps.  Then, by allowing to an\r\ninfantry corps a brigade of cavalry and six batteries of\r\nfield-artillery, we would have an efficient  corps d'armée of\r\nthirty thousand men, whose organization would be simple and most\r\nefficient, and whose strength should never be allowed to fall below\r\ntwenty-five thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe corps is the true unit for grand campaigns and battle, should\r\nhave a full and perfect staff, and every thing requisite for\r\nseparate action, ready at all times to be detached and sent off for\r\nany nature of service.  The general in command should have the rank\r\nof lieutenant-general, and should be, by experience and education,\r\nequal to any thing in war.  Habitually with us he was a major-\r\ngeneral, specially selected and assigned to the command by an order\r\nof the President, constituting, in fact, a separate grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe division is the unit of administration, and is the legitimate\r\ncommand of a major general.\r\n\r\nThe brigade is the next subdivision, and is commanded by a\r\nbrigadier-general.\r\n\r\nThe regiment is the family.  The colonel, as the father, should\r\nhave a personal acquaintance with every officer and man, and should\r\ninstill a feeling of pride and affection for himself, so that his\r\nofficers and men would naturally look to him for personal advice\r\nand instruction.  In war the regiment should never be subdivided,\r\nbut should always be maintained entire.  In peace this is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe company is the true unit of discipline, and the captain is the\r\ncompany.  A good captain makes a good company, and he should have\r\nthe power to reward as well as punish.  The fact that soldiers\r\nworld naturally like to have a good fellow for their captain is the\r\nbest reason why he should be appointed by the colonel, or by some\r\nsuperior authority, instead of being elected by the men.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the people are the \"sovereign,\" all power\r\noriginally proceeds from them, and therefore the election of\r\nofficers by the men is the common rule.  This is wrong, because an\r\narmy is not a popular organization, but an animated machine, an\r\ninstrument in the hands of the Executive for enforcing the law, and\r\nmaintaining the honor and dignity of the nation; and the President,\r\nas the constitutional commander-in-chief of the army and navy,\r\nshould exercise the power of appointment (subject to the\r\nconfirmation of the Senate) of the officers of \"volunteers,\" as\r\nwell as of \"regulars.\"\r\n\r\nNo army can be efficient unless it be a unit for action; and the\r\npower must come from above, not from below: the President usually\r\ndelegates his power to the commander-in-chief, and he to the next,\r\nand so on down to the lowest actual commander of troops, however\r\nsmall the detachment.  No matter how troops come together, when\r\nonce united, the highest officer in rank is held responsible, and\r\nshould be consequently armed with the fullest power of the\r\nExecutive, subject only to law and existing orders.  The more\r\nsimple the principle, the greater the likelihood of determined\r\naction; and the less a commanding officer is circumscribed by\r\nbounds or by precedent, the greater is the probability that he will\r\nmake the best use of his command and achieve the best results.\r\n\r\nThe Regular Army and the Military Academy at West Point have in the\r\npast provided, and doubtless will in the future provide an ample\r\nsupply of good officers for future wars; but, should their numbers\r\nbe insufficient, we can always safely rely on the great number of\r\nyoung men of education and force of character throughout the\r\ncountry, to supplement them.  At the close of our civil war,\r\nlasting four years, some of our best corps and division generals,\r\nas well as staff-officers, were from civil life; but I cannot\r\nrecall any of the most successful who did not express a regret that\r\nhe had not received in early life instruction in the elementary\r\nprinciples of the art of war, instead of being forced to acquire\r\nthis knowledge in the dangerous and expensive school of actual war.\r\n\r\nBut the vital difficulty was, and will be again, to obtain an\r\nadequate number of good soldiers.  We tried almost every system\r\nknown to modern nations, all with more or less success--voluntary\r\nenlistments, the draft, and bought substitutes--and I think that all\r\nofficers of experience will confirm my assertion that the men who\r\nvoluntarily enlisted at the outbreak of the war were the best,\r\nbetter than the conscript, and far better than the bought\r\nsubstitute.  When a regiment is once organized in a State, and\r\nmustered into the service of the United States, the officers and\r\nmen become subject to the same laws of discipline and government as\r\nthe regular troops.  They are in no sense \"militia,\" but compose\r\na part of the Army of the United States, only retain their State\r\ntitle for convenience, and yet may be principally recruited from\r\nthe neighborhood of their original organization: Once organized,\r\nthe regiment should be kept full by recruits, and when it becomes\r\ndifficult to obtain more recruits the pay should be raised by\r\nCongress, instead of tempting new men by exaggerated bounties.  I\r\nbelieve it would have been more economical to have raised the pay\r\nof the soldier to thirty or even fifty dollars a month than to have\r\nheld out the promise of three hundred and even six hundred dollars\r\nin the form of bounty.  Toward the close of the war, I have often\r\nheard the soldiers complain that the \"stay at-home\" men got better\r\npay, bounties, and food, than they who were exposed to all the\r\ndangers and vicissitudes of the battles and marches at the front.\r\nThe feeling of the soldier should be that, in every event, the\r\nsympathy and preference of his government is for him who fights,\r\nrather than for him who is on provost or guard duty to the rear,\r\nand, like most men, he measures this by the amount of pay.  Of\r\ncourse, the soldier must be trained to obedience, and should be\r\n\"content with his wages;\" but whoever has commanded an army in the\r\nfield knows the difference between a willing, contented mass of\r\nmen, and one that feels a cause of grievance.  There is a soul to\r\nan army as well as to the individual man, and no general can\r\naccomplish the full work of his army unless he commands the soul of\r\nhis men, as well as their bodies and legs.\r\n\r\nThe greatest mistake made in our civil war was in the mode of\r\nrecruitment and promotion.  When a regiment became reduced by the\r\nnecessary wear and tear of service, instead of being filled up at\r\nthe bottom, and the vacancies among the officers filled from the\r\nbest noncommissioned officers and men, the habit was to raise new\r\nregiments, with new colonels, captains, and men, leaving the old\r\nand experienced battalions to dwindle away into mere skeleton\r\norganizations.  I believe with the volunteers this matter was left\r\nto the States exclusively, and I remember that Wisconsin kept her\r\nregiments filled with recruits, whereas other States generally\r\nfilled their quotas by new regiments, and the result was that we\r\nestimated a Wisconsin regiment equal to an ordinary brigade.  I\r\nbelieve that five hundred new men added to an old and experienced\r\nregiment were more valuable than a thousand men in the form of a\r\nnew regiment, for the former by association with good, experienced\r\ncaptains, lieutenants, and non-commissioned officers, soon became\r\nveterans, whereas the latter were generally unavailable for a year.\r\nThe German method of recruitment is simply perfect, and there is no\r\ngood reason why we should not follow it substantially.\r\n\r\nOn a road, marching by the flank, it would be considered \"good\r\norder\" to have five thousand men to a mile, so that a full corps of\r\nthirty thousand men would extend six miles, but with the average\r\ntrains and batteries of artillery the probabilities are that it\r\nwould draw out to ten miles.  On a long and regular march the\r\ndivisions and brigades should alternate in the lead, the leading\r\ndivision should be on the road by the earliest dawn, and march at\r\nthe rate of about two miles, or, at most, two and a half miles an\r\nhour, so as to reach camp by noon.  Even then the rear divisions\r\nand trains will hardly reach camp much before night. Theoretically,\r\na marching column should preserve such order that by simply halting\r\nand facing to the right or left, it would be in line of battle; but\r\nthis is rarely the case, and generally deployments are made\r\n\"forward,\" by conducting each brigade by the flank obliquely to the\r\nright or left to its approximate position in line of battle, and\r\nthere deployed.  In such a line of battle, a brigade of three\r\nthousand infantry would occupy a mile of \"front;\" but for a strong\r\nline of battle five-thousand men with two batteries should be\r\nallowed to each mile, or a division would habitually constitute a\r\ndouble line with skirmishers and a reserve on a mile of \"front.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"feeding\" of an army is a matter of the most vital importance,\r\nand demands the earliest attention of the general intrusted with a\r\ncampaign.  To be strong, healthy, and capable of the largest\r\nmeasure of physical effort, the soldier needs about three pounds\r\ngross of food per day, and the horse or mule about twenty pounds.\r\nWhen a general first estimates the quantity of food and forage\r\nneeded for an army of fifty or one hundred thousand men, he is apt\r\nto be dismayed, and here a good staff is indispensable, though the\r\ngeneral cannot throw off on them the responsibility.  He must give\r\nthe subject his personal attention, for the army reposes in him\r\nalone, and should never doubt the fact that their existence\r\noverrides in importance all other considerations.  Once satisfied\r\nof this, and that all has been done that can be, the soldiers are\r\nalways willing to bear the largest measure of privation.  Probably\r\nno army ever had a more varied experience in this regard than the\r\none I commanded in 1864'65.\r\n\r\nOur base of supply was at Nashville, supplied by railways and the\r\nCumberland River, thence by rail to Chattanooga, a \"secondary\r\nbase,\" and thence forward a single-track railroad.  The stores came\r\nforward daily, but I endeavored to have on hand a full supply for\r\ntwenty days in advance.  These stores were habitually in the\r\nwagon-trains, distributed to corps, divisions, and regiments, in\r\ncharge of experienced quartermasters and commissaries, and became\r\nsubject to the orders of the generals commanding these bodies.\r\nThey were generally issued on provision returns, but these had to\r\nbe closely scrutinized, for too often the colonels would make\r\nrequisitions for provisions for more men than they reported for\r\nbattle.  Of course, there are always a good many non-combatants\r\nwith an army, but, after careful study, I limited their amount to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of the \"effective strength,\" and that was\r\nfound to be liberal.  An ordinary army-wagon drawn by six mules may\r\nbe counted on to carry three thousand pounds net, equal to the food\r\nof a full regiment for one day, but, by driving along beef-cattle,\r\na commissary may safely count the contents of one wagon as\r\nsufficient for two days' food for a regiment of a thousand men; and\r\nas a corps should have food on hand for twenty days ready for\r\ndetachment, it should have three hundred such wagons, as a\r\nprovision-train; and for forage, ammunition, clothing, and other\r\nnecessary stores, it was found necessary to have three hundred more\r\nwagons, or six hundred wagons in all, for a corps d'armée.\r\n\r\nThese should be absolutely under the immediate control of the corps\r\ncommander, who will, however, find it economical to distribute them\r\nin due proportion to his divisions, brigades, and even regiments.\r\nEach regiment ought usually to have at least one wagon for\r\nconvenience to distribute stores, and each company two pack-mules,\r\nso that the regiment may always be certain of a meal on reaching\r\ncamp without waiting for the larger trains.\r\n\r\nOn long marches the artillery and wagon-trains should always have\r\nthe right of way, and the troops should improvise roads to one\r\nside, unless forced to use a bridge in common, and all trains\r\nshould have escorts to protect them, and to assist them in bad\r\nplaces.  To this end there is nothing like actual experience, only,\r\nunless the officers in command give the subject their personal\r\nattention, they will find their wagon-trains loaded down with\r\ntents, personal baggage, and even the arms and knapsacks of the\r\nescort.  Each soldier should, if not actually \"sick or wounded,\"\r\ncarry his musket and equipments containing from forty to sixty\r\nrounds of ammunition, his shelter-tent, a blanket or overcoat, and\r\nan extra pair of pants, socks, and drawers, in the form of a scarf,\r\nworn from the left shoulder to the right side in lieu of knapsack,\r\nand in his haversack he should carry some bread, cooked meat, salt,\r\nand coffee.  I do not believe a soldier should be loaded down too\r\nmuch, but, including his clothing, arms, and equipment, he can\r\ncarry about fifty pounds without impairing his health or activity.\r\nA simple calculation will show that by such a distribution a corps\r\nwill-thus carry the equivalent of five hundred wagon-loads--an\r\nimmense relief to the trains.\r\n\r\nWhere an army is near one of our many large navigable rivers, or\r\nhas the safe use of a railway, it can usually be supplied with the\r\nfull army ration, which is by far the best furnished to any army in\r\nAmerica or Europe; but when it is compelled to operate away from\r\nsuch a base, and is dependent on its own train of wagons, the\r\ncommanding officer must exercise a wise discretion in the selection\r\nof his stores.  In my opinion, there is no better food for man than\r\nbeef-cattle driven on the hoof, issued liberally, with salt, bacon,\r\nand bread.  Coffee has also become almost indispensable, though\r\nmany substitutes were found for it, such as Indian-corn, roasted,\r\nground, and boiled as coffee; the sweet-potato, and the seed of the\r\nokra plant prepared in the same way.  All these were used by the\r\npeople of the South, who for years could procure no coffee, but I\r\nnoticed that the women always begged of us some real coffee, which\r\nseems to satisfy a natural yearning or craving more powerful than\r\ncan be accounted for on the theory of habit.  Therefore I would\r\nalways advise that the coffee and sugar ration be carried along,\r\neven at the expense of bread, for which there are many substitutes.\r\nOf these, Indian-corn is the best and most abundant.  Parched in a\r\nfrying-pan, it is excellent food, or if ground, or pounded and\r\nboiled with meat of any sort, it makes a most nutritious meal.  The\r\npotato, both Irish and sweet, forms an excellent substitute for\r\nbread, and at Savannah we found that rice (was) also suitable, both for\r\nmen and animals.  For the former it should be cleaned of its husk\r\nin a hominy block, easily prepared out of a log, and sifted with a\r\ncoarse corn bag; but for horses it should be fed in the straw.\r\nDuring the Atlanta campaign we were supplied by our regular\r\ncommissaries with all sorts of patent compounds, such as desiccated\r\nvegetables, and concentrated milk, meat-biscuit, and sausages, but\r\nsomehow the men preferred the simpler and more familiar forms of\r\nfood, and usually styled these \"desecrated vegetables and\r\nconsecrated milk.\"  We were also supplied liberally with\r\nlime-juice, sauerkraut, and pickles, as an antidote to scurvy, and\r\nI now recall the extreme anxiety of my medical director, Dr. Kittoe,\r\nabout the scurvy, which he reported at one time as spreading and\r\nimperiling the army.  This occurred at a crisis about Kenesaw, when\r\nthe railroad was taxed to its utmost capacity to provide the\r\nnecessary ammunition, food, and forage, and could not possibly\r\nbring us an adequate supply of potatoes and cabbage, the usual\r\nanti-scorbutics, when providentially the black berries ripened and\r\nproved an admirable antidote, and I have known the skirmish-line,\r\nwithout orders, to fight a respectable battle for the possession of\r\nsome old fields that were full of blackberries.  Soon, thereafter,\r\nthe green corn or roasting-ear came into season, and I heard no\r\nmore of the scurvy.  Our country abounds with plants which can be\r\nutilized for a prevention to the scurvy; besides the above are the\r\npersimmon, the sassafras root and bud, the wild-mustard, the\r\n\"agave,\" turnip tops, the dandelion cooked as greens, and a\r\ndecoction of the ordinary pine-leaf.\r\n\r\nFor the more delicate and costly articles of food for the sick we\r\nrelied mostly on the agents of the Sanitary Commission.  I do not\r\nwish to doubt the value of these organizations, which gained so\r\nmuch applause during our civil war, for no one can question the\r\nmotives of these charitable and generous people; but to be honest I\r\nmust record an opinion that the Sanitary Commission should limit\r\nits operations to the hospitals at the rear, and should never\r\nappear at the front.  They were generally local in feeling, aimed\r\nto furnish their personal friends and neighbors with a better class\r\nof food than the Government supplied, and the consequence was, that\r\none regiment of a brigade would receive potatoes and fruit which\r\nwould be denied another regiment close by: Jealousy would be the\r\ninevitable result, and in an army all parts should be equal; there\r\nshould be no \"partiality, favor, or affection.\"  The Government\r\nshould supply all essential wants, and in the hospitals to the rear\r\nwill be found abundant opportunities for the exercise of all\r\npossible charity and generosity.  During the war I several times\r\ngained the ill-will of the agents of the Sanitary Commission\r\nbecause I forbade their coming to the front unless they would\r\nconsent to distribute their stores equally among all, regardless of\r\nthe parties who had contributed them.\r\n\r\nThe sick, wounded, and dead of an army are the subjects of the\r\ngreatest possible anxiety, and add an immense amount of labor to\r\nthe well men.  Each regiment in an active campaign should have a\r\nsurgeon and two assistants always close at hand, and each brigade\r\nand division should have an experienced surgeon as a medical\r\ndirector.  The great majority of wounds and of sickness should be\r\ntreated by the regimental surgeon, on the ground, under the eye of\r\nthe colonel.  As few should be sent to the brigade or division\r\nhospital as possible, for the men always receive better care with\r\ntheir own regiment than with strangers, and as a rule the cure is\r\nmore certain; but when men receive disabling wounds, or have\r\nsickness likely to become permanent, the sooner they go far to the\r\nrear the better for all.  The tent or the shelter of a tree is a\r\nbetter hospital than a house, whose walls absorb fetid and\r\npoisonous emanations, and then give them back to the atmosphere.\r\nTo men accustomed to the open air, who live on the plainest food,\r\nwounds seem to give less pain, and are attended with less danger to\r\nlife than to ordinary soldiers in barracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds which, in 1861, would have sent a man to the hospital for\r\nmonths, in 1865 were regarded as mere scratches, rather the subject\r\nof a joke than of sorrow.  To new soldiers the sight of blood and\r\ndeath always has a sickening effect, but soon men become accustomed\r\nto it, and I have heard them exclaim on seeing a dead comrade borne\r\nto the rear, \"Well, Bill has turned up his toes to the daisies.\"\r\nOf course, during a skirmish or battle, armed men should never\r\nleave their ranks to attend a dead or wounded comrade--this should\r\nbe seen to in advance by the colonel, who should designate his\r\nmusicians or company cooks as hospital attendants, with a white rag\r\non their arm to indicate their office.  A wounded man should go\r\nhimself (if able) to the surgeon near at hand, or, if he need help,\r\nhe should receive it from one of the attendants and not a comrade.\r\nIt is wonderful how soon the men accustom themselves to these\r\nsimple rules.  In great battles these matters call for a more\r\nenlarged attention, and then it becomes the duty of the division\r\ngeneral to see that proper stretchers and field hospitals are ready\r\nfor the wounded, and trenches are dug for the dead.  There should\r\nbe no real neglect of the dead, because it has a bad effect on the\r\nliving; for each soldier values himself and comrade as highly as\r\nthough he were living in a good house at home.\r\n\r\nThe regimental chaplain, if any, usually attends the burials from\r\nthe hospital, should make notes and communicate details to the\r\ncaptain of the company, and to the family at home.  Of course it is\r\nusually impossible to mark the grave with names, dates, etc., and\r\nconsequently the names of the \"unknown\" in our national cemeteries\r\nequal about one-half of all the dead.\r\n\r\nVery few of the battles in which I have participated were fought as\r\ndescribed in European text-books, viz., in great masses, in perfect\r\norder, manoeuvring by corps, divisions, and brigades.  We were\r\ngenerally in a wooded country, and, though our lines were deployed\r\naccording to tactics, the men generally fought in strong\r\nskirmish-lines, taking advantage of the shape of ground, and of\r\nevery cover.  We were generally the assailants, and in wooded and\r\nbroken countries the \"defensive\" had a positive advantage over us,\r\nfor they were always ready, had cover, and always knew the ground\r\nto their immediate front; whereas we, their assailants, had to\r\ngrope our way over unknown ground, and generally found a cleared\r\nfield or prepared entanglements that held us for a time under a\r\nclose and withering fire.  Rarely did the opposing lines in compact\r\norder come into actual contact, but when, as at Peach-Tree Creek\r\nand Atlanta, the lines did become commingled, the men fought\r\nindividually in every possible style, more frequently with the\r\nmusket clubbed than with the bayonet, and in some instances the men\r\nclinched like wrestlers, and went to the ground together.\r\nEuropeans frequently criticised our war, because we did not always\r\ntake full advantage of a victory; the true reason was, that\r\nhabitually the woods served as a screen, and we often did not\r\nrealize the fact that our enemy had retreated till he was already\r\nmiles away and was again intrenched, having left a mere\r\nskirmish-line to cover the movement, in turn to fall back to the\r\nnew position.\r\n\r\nOur war was fought with the muzzle-loading rifle.  Toward the close\r\nI had one brigade (Walcutt's) armed with breech-loading \"Spencer's;\"\r\nthe cavalry generally had breach-loading carbines, \"Spencer's\" and\r\n\"Sharp's,\" both of which were good arms.\r\n\r\nThe only change that breech-loading arms will probably make in the\r\nart and practice of war will be to increase the amount of\r\nammunition to be expended, and necessarily to be carried along; to\r\nstill further \"thin out\" the lines of attack, and to reduce battles\r\nto short, quick, decisive conflicts.  It does not in the least\r\naffect the grand strategy, or the necessity for perfect\r\norganization, drill, and discipline.  The companies and battalions\r\nwill be more dispersed, and the men will be less under the\r\nimmediate eye of their officers, and therefore a higher order of\r\nintelligence and courage on the part of the individual soldier will\r\nbe an element of strength.\r\n\r\nWhen a regiment is deployed as skirmishers, and crosses an open\r\nfield or woods, under heavy fire, if each man runs forward from\r\ntree to tree, or stump to stump, and yet preserves a good general\r\nalignment, it gives great confidence to the men themselves, for\r\nthey always keep their eyes well to the right and left, and watch\r\ntheir comrades; but when some few hold back, stick too close or too\r\nlong to a comfortable log, it often stops the line and defeats the\r\nwhole object.  Therefore, the more we improve the fire-arm the more\r\nwill be the necessity for good organization, good discipline and\r\nintelligence on the part of the individual soldier and officer.\r\nThere is, of course, such a thing as individual courage, which has\r\na value in war, but familiarity with danger, experience in war and\r\nits common attendants, and personal habit, are equally valuable\r\ntraits, and these are the qualities with which we usually have to\r\ndeal in war.  All men naturally shrink from pain and danger, and\r\nonly incur their risk from some higher motive, or from habit; so\r\nthat I would define true courage to be a perfect sensibility of the\r\nmeasure of danger, and a mental willingness to incur it, rather\r\nthan that insensibility to danger of which I have heard far more\r\nthan I have seen.  The most courageous men are generally\r\nunconscious of possessing the quality; therefore, when one\r\nprofesses it too openly, by words or bearing, there is reason to\r\nmistrust it.  I would further illustrate my meaning by describing a\r\nman of true courage to be one who possesses all his faculties and\r\nsenses perfectly when serious danger is actually present.\r\n\r\nModern wars have not materially changed the relative values or\r\nproportions of the several arms of service: infantry, artillery,\r\ncavalry, and engineers.  If any thing, the infantry has been\r\nincreased in value.  The danger of cavalry attempting to charge\r\ninfantry armed with breech-loading rifles was fully illustrated at\r\nSedan, and with us very frequently.  So improbable has such a thing\r\nbecome that we have omitted the infantry-square from our recent\r\ntactics.  Still, cavalry against cavalry, and as auxiliary to\r\ninfantry, will always be valuable, while all great wars will, as\r\nheretofore, depend chiefly on the infantry.  Artillery is more\r\nvaluable with new and inexperienced troops than with veterans.  In\r\nthe early stages of the war the field-guns often bore the\r\nproportion of six to a thousand men; but toward the close of the\r\nwar one gun; or at most two, to a thousand men, was deemed enough.\r\nSieges; such as characterized the wars of the last century, are too\r\nslow for this period of the world, and the Prussians recently\r\nalmost ignored them altogether, penetrated France between the\r\nforts, and left a superior force \"in observation,\" to watch the\r\ngarrison and accept its surrender when the greater events of the\r\nwar ahead made further resistance useless; but earth-forts, and\r\nespecially field-works, will hereafter play an important part in\r\nwar, because they enable a minor force to hold a superior one in\r\ncheck for a time, and time is a most valuable element in all wars.\r\nIt was one of Prof. Mahan's maxims that the spade was as useful in\r\nwar as the musket, and to this I will add the axe.  The habit of\r\nintrenching certainly does have the effect of making new troops\r\ntimid.  When a line of battle is once covered by a good parapet,\r\nmade by the engineers or by the labor of the men themselves, it\r\ndoes require an effort to make them leave it in the face of danger;\r\nbut when the enemy is intrenched, it becomes absolutely necessary\r\nto permit each brigade and division of the troops immediately\r\nopposed to throw up a corresponding trench for their own protection\r\nin case of a sudden sally.  We invariably did this in all our\r\nrecent campaigns, and it had no ill effect, though sometimes our\r\ntroops were a little too slow in leaving their well-covered lines\r\nto assail the enemy in position or on retreat.  Even our\r\nskirmishers were in the habit of rolling logs together, or of\r\nmaking a lunette of rails, with dirt in front, to cover their\r\nbodies; and, though it revealed their position, I cannot say that\r\nit worked a bad effect; so that, as a rule, it may safely be left\r\nto the men themselves: On the \"defensive,\" there is no doubt of the\r\npropriety of fortifying; but in the assailing army the general must\r\nwatch closely to see that his men do not neglect an opportunity to\r\ndrop his precautionary defenses, and act promptly on the\r\n\"offensive\" at every chance.\r\n\r\nI have many a time crept forward to the skirmish-line to avail\r\nmyself of the cover of the pickets \"little fort,\" to observe more\r\nclosely some expected result; and always talked familiarly with the\r\nmen, and was astonished to see how well they comprehended the\r\ngeneral object, and how accurately they were informed of the sate\r\nof facts existing miles away from their particular corps.  Soldiers\r\nare very quick to catch the general drift and purpose of a\r\ncampaign, and are always sensible when they are well commanded or\r\nwell cared for.  Once impressed with this fact, and that they are\r\nmaking progress, they bear cheerfully any amount of labor and\r\nprivation.\r\n\r\nIn camp, and especially in the presence of an active enemy, it is\r\nmuch easier to maintain discipline than in barracks in time of\r\npeace.  Crime and breaches of discipline are much less frequent,\r\nand the necessity for courts-martial far less.  The captain can\r\nusually inflict all the punishment necessary, and the colonel\r\nshould always.  The field-officers' court is the best form for war,\r\nviz., one of the field-officers-the lieutenant-colonel or major\r\n--can examine the case and report his verdict, and the colonel\r\nshould execute it.  Of course, there are statutory offenses which\r\ndemand a general court-martial, and these must be ordered by the\r\ndivision or corps commander; but, the presence of one of our\r\nregular civilian judge-advocates in an army in the field would be a\r\nfirst-class nuisance, for technical courts always work mischief.\r\nToo many courts-martial in any command are evidence of poor\r\ndiscipline and inefficient officers.\r\n\r\nFor the rapid transmission of orders in an army covering a large\r\nspace of ground, the magnetic telegraph is by far the best, though\r\nhabitually the paper and pencil, with good mounted orderlies,\r\nanswer every purpose.  I have little faith in the signal-service by\r\nflags and torches, though we always used them; because, almost\r\ninvariably when they were most needed, the view was cut off by\r\nintervening trees, or by mists and fogs.  There was one notable\r\ninstance in my experience, when the signal-flags carried a message.\r\nof vital importance over the heads of Hood's army, which had\r\ninterposed between me and Allatoona, and had broken the\r\ntelegraph-wires--as recorded in Chapter XIX.; but the value of the\r\nmagnetic telegraph in war cannot be exaggerated, as was illustrated\r\nby the perfect concert of action between the armies in Virginia and\r\nGeorgia during 1864.  Hardly a day intervened when General Grant\r\ndid not know the exact state of facts with me, more than fifteen\r\nhundred miles away as the wires ran.  So on the field a thin\r\ninsulated wire may be run on improvised stakes or from tree to tree\r\nfor six or more miles in a couple of hours, and I have seen\r\noperators so skillful, that by cutting the wire they would receive\r\na message with their tongues from a distant station.  As a matter\r\nof course, the ordinary commercial wires along the railways form\r\nthe usual telegraph-lines for an army, and these are easily\r\nrepaired and extended as the army advances, but each army and wing\r\nshould have a small party of skilled men to put up the field-wire,\r\nand take it down when done.  This is far better than the\r\nsignal-flags and torches.  Our commercial telegraph-lines will\r\nalways supply for war enough skillful operators.\r\n\r\nThe value of railways is also fully recognized in war quite as much\r\nas, if not more so than, in peace.  The Atlanta campaign would\r\nsimply have been impossible without the use of the railroads from\r\nLouisville to Nashville--one hundred and eighty-five miles--from\r\nNashville to Chattanooga--one hundred and fifty-one miles--and from\r\nChattanooga to Atlanta--one hundred and thirty-seven miles.  Every\r\nmile of this \"single track\" was so delicate, that one man could in\r\na minute have broken or moved a rail, but our trains usually\r\ncarried along the tools and means to repair such a break.  We had,\r\nhowever, to maintain strong guards and garrisons at each important\r\nbridge or trestle--the destruction of which would have necessitated\r\ntime for rebuilding.  For the protection of a bridge, one or two\r\nlog block houses, two stories high, with a piece of ordnance and a\r\nsmall infantry guard, usually sufficed.  The block-house had a\r\nsmall parapet and ditch about it, and the roof was made shot proof\r\nby earth piled on.  These points could usually be reached only by a\r\ndash of the enemy's cavalry, and many of these block houses\r\nsuccessfully resisted serious attacks by both cavalry and\r\nartillery. The only block-house that was actually captured on the\r\nmain was the one described near Allatoona.  Our trains from\r\nNashville forward were operated under military rules, and ran about\r\nten miles an hour in gangs of four trains of ten cars each.  Four\r\nsuch groups of trains daily made one hundred and sixty cars, of ten\r\ntons each, carrying sixteen hundred tons, which exceeded the\r\nabsolute necessity of the army, and allowed for the accidents that\r\nwere common and inevitable.  But, as I have recorded, that single\r\nstem of railroad, four hundred and seventy-three miles long,\r\nsupplied an army of one hundred thousand men and thirty-five\r\nthousand animals for the period of one hundred and ninety-six days,\r\nviz., from May 1 to November 12, 1864.  To have delivered regularly\r\nthat amount of food and forage by ordinary wagons would have\r\nrequired thirty-six thousand eight hundred wagons of six mules\r\neach, allowing each wagon to have hauled two tons twenty miles each\r\nday, a simple impossibility in roads such as then existed in that\r\nregion of country.  Therefore, I reiterate that the Atlanta\r\ncampaign was an impossibility without these railroads; and only\r\nthen, because we had the men and means to maintain and defend them,\r\nin addition to what were necessary to overcome the enemy.\r\nHabitually, a passenger-car will carry fifty men with their\r\nnecessary baggage.  Box-cars, and even platform-cars, answer the\r\npurpose well enough, but they, should always have rough\r\nboard-seats.  For sick and wounded men, box-cars filled with straw\r\nor bushes were usually employed.  Personally, I saw but little of\r\nthe practical working of the railroads, for I only turned back once\r\nas far as Resaca; but I had daily reports from the engineer in\r\ncharge, and officers who came from the rear often explained to me\r\nthe whole thing, with a description of the wrecked trains all the\r\nway from Nashville to Atlanta.  I am convinced that the risk to\r\nlife to the engineers and men on that railroad fully equaled that\r\non the skirmish-line, called for as high an order of courage, and\r\nfully equaled it in importance.  Still, I doubt if there be any\r\nnecessity in time of peace to organize a corps specially to work\r\nthe military railroads in time of war, because in peace these same\r\nmen gain all the necessary experience, possess all the daring and\r\ncourage of soldiers, and only need the occasional protection and\r\nassistance of the necessary train-guard, which may be composed of\r\nthe furloughed men coming and going, or of details made from the\r\nlocal garrisons to the rear.\r\n\r\nFor the transfer of large armies by rail, from one theatre of\r\naction to another by the rear--the cases of the transfer of the\r\nEleventh and Twelfth Corps--General Hooker, twenty-three thousand\r\nmen--from the East to Chattanooga, eleven hundred and ninety-two\r\nmiles in seven days, in the fall of 1863; and that of the Army of\r\nthe Ohio--General Schofield, fifteen thousand men--from the valley\r\nof the Tennessee to Washington, fourteen hundred miles in eleven\r\ndays, en route to North Carolina in January, 1865, are the best\r\nexamples of which I have any knowledge, and reference to these is\r\nmade in the report of the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, dated\r\nNovember 22, 1865.\r\n\r\nEngineer troops attached to an army are habitually employed in\r\nsupervising the construction of forts or field works of a nature\r\nmore permanent than the lines need by the troops in motion, and in\r\nrepairing roads and making bridges.  I had several regiments of\r\nthis kind that were most useful, but as a rule we used the\r\ninfantry, or employed parties of freedmen, who worked on the\r\ntrenches at night while the soldiers slept, and these in turn\r\nrested by day.  Habitually the repair of the railroad and its\r\nbridges was committed to hired laborers, like the English navies,\r\nunder the supervision of Colonel W. W. Wright, a railroad-engineer,\r\nwho was in the military service at the time, and his successful\r\nlabors were frequently referred to in the official reports of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nFor the passage of rivers, each army corps had a pontoon-train with\r\na detachment of engineers, and, on reaching a river, the leading\r\ninfantry division was charged with the labor of putting it down.\r\nGenerally the single pontoon-train could provide for nine hundred\r\nfeet of bridge, which sufficed; but when the rivers were very wide\r\ntwo such trains would be brought together, or the single train was\r\nsupplemented by a trestle-bridge, or bridges made on crib-work, out\r\nof timber found near the place.  The pontoons in general use were\r\nskeleton frames, made with a hinge, so as to fold back and\r\nconstitute a wagon-body.  In this same wagon were carried the\r\ncotton canvas cover, the anchor and chains, and a due proportion of\r\nthe balks, cheeses, and lashings.  All the troops became very\r\nfamiliar with their mechanism and use, and we were rarely delayed\r\nby reason of a river, however broad.  I saw, recently, in\r\nAldershot, England, a very complete pontoon-train; the boats were\r\nsheathed with wood and felt, made very light; but I think these\r\nwere more liable to chafing and damage in rough handling than were\r\nour less expensive and rougher boats.  On the whole, I would prefer\r\nthe skeleton frame and canvas cover to any style of pontoon that I\r\nhave ever seen.\r\n\r\nIn relation to guards, pickets, and vedettes, I doubt if any\r\ndiscoveries or improvements were made during our war, or in any of\r\nthe modern wars in Europe.  These precautions vary with the nature\r\nof the country and the situation of each army.  When advancing or\r\nretreating in line of battle, the usual skirmish-line constitutes\r\nthe picket-line, and may have \"reserves,\" but usually the main line\r\nof battle constitutes the reserve; and in this connection I will\r\nstate that the recent innovation introduced into the new infantry\r\ntactics by General Upton is admirable, for by it each regiment,\r\nbrigade, and division deployed, sends forward as \"skirmishers\" the\r\none man of each set of fours, to cover its own front, and these can\r\nbe recalled or reenforced at pleasure by the bugle-signal.\r\n\r\nFor flank-guards and rear-guards, one or more companies should be\r\ndetached under their own officers, instead of making up the guard\r\nby detailing men from the several companies.\r\n\r\nFor regimental or camp guards, the details should be made according\r\nto existing army regulations; and all the guards should be posted\r\nearly in the evening, so as to afford each sentinel or vedette a\r\nchance to study his ground before it becomes too dark.\r\n\r\nIn like manner as to the staff.  The more intimately it comes into\r\ncontact with the troops, the more useful and valuable it becomes.\r\nThe almost entire separation of the staff from the line, as now\r\npractised by us, and hitherto by the French, has proved\r\nmischievous, and the great retinues of staff-officers with which\r\nsome of our earlier generals began the war were simply ridiculous.\r\nI don't believe in a chief of staff at all, and any general\r\ncommanding an army, corps, or division, that has a staff-officer\r\nwho professes to know more than his chief, is to be pitied.  Each\r\nregiment should have a competent adjutant, quartermaster, and\r\ncommissary, with two or three medical officers.  Each brigade\r\ncommander should have the same staff, with the addition of a couple\r\nof young aides-de-camp, habitually selected from the subalterns of\r\nthe brigade, who should be good riders, and intelligent enough to\r\ngive and explain the orders of their general.\r\n\r\nThe same staff will answer for a division.  The general in command\r\nof a separate army, and of a corps d'armée, should have the same\r\nprofessional assistance, with two or more good engineers, and his\r\nadjutant-general should exercise all the functions usually ascribed\r\nto a chief of staff, viz., he should possess the ability to\r\ncomprehend the scope of operations, and to make verbally and in\r\nwriting all the orders and details necessary to carry into effect\r\nthe views of his general, as well as to keep the returns and\r\nrecords of events for the information of the next higher authority,\r\nand for history.  A bulky staff implies a division of\r\nresponsibility, slowness of action, and indecision, whereas a small\r\nstaff implies activity and concentration of purpose.  The smallness\r\nof General Grant's staff throughout the civil war forms the best\r\nmodel for future imitation.  So of tents, officers furniture, etc.,\r\netc.  In real war these should all be discarded, and an army is\r\nefficient for action and motion exactly in the inverse ratio of its\r\nimpedimenta.  Tents should be omitted altogether, save one to a\r\nregiment for an office, and a few for the division hospital.\r\nOfficers should be content with a tent fly, improvising poles and\r\nshelter out of bushes.  The tents d'abri, or shelter-tent, carried\r\nby the soldier himself, is all-sufficient.  Officers should never\r\nseek for houses, but share the condition of their men.\r\n\r\nA recent message (July 18, 1874) made to the French Assembly by\r\nMarshal MacMahon, President of the French Republic, submits a\r\nprojet de loi, with a report prepared by a board of French generals\r\non \"army administration,\" which is full of information, and is as\r\napplicable to us as to the French.  I quote from its very\r\nbeginning: \"The misfortunes of the campaign of 1870 have\r\ndemonstrated the inferiority of our system....  Two separate\r\norganizations existed with parallel functions--the 'general' more\r\noccupied in giving direction to his troops than in providing for\r\ntheir material wants, which he regarded as the special province of\r\nthe staff, and the 'intendant' (staff) often working at random,\r\ntaking on his shoulders a crushing burden of functions and duties,\r\nexhausting himself with useless efforts, and aiming to accomplish\r\nan insufficient service, to the disappointment of everybody.  This\r\nseparation of the administration and command, this coexistence of\r\ntwo wills, each independent of the other, which paralyzed both and\r\nannulled the dualism, was condemned.  It was decided by the board\r\nthat this error should be \"proscribed\" in the new military system.\r\nThe report then goes on at great length discussing the provisions.\r\nof the \"new law,\" which is described to be a radical change from\r\nthe old one on the same subject.  While conceding to the Minister\r\nof War in Paris the general control and supervision of the entire\r\nmilitary establishment primarily, especially of the annual\r\nestimates or budget, and the great depots of supply, it distributes\r\nto the commanders of the corps d'armée in time of peace, and to all\r\narmy commanders generally in time of war, the absolute command of\r\nthe money, provisions, and stores, with the necessary staff-\r\nofficers to receive, issue, and account for them.  I quote further:\r\n\"The object of this law is to confer on the commander of troops\r\nwhatever liberty of action the case demands.  He has the power even\r\nto go beyond the regulations, in circumstances of urgency and\r\npressing necessity.  The extraordinary measures he may take on\r\nthese occasions may require their execution without delay.  The\r\nstaff-officer has but one duty before obeying, and that is to\r\nsubmit his observations to the general, and to ask his orders in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nWith this formality his responsibility ceases, and the\r\nresponsibility for the extraordinary act falls solely on the\r\ngeneral who gives the order.  The officers and agents charged with\r\nsupplies are placed under the orders of the general in command of\r\nthe troops, that is, they are obliged both in war and peace to\r\nobey, with the single qualification above named, of first making\r\ntheir observations and securing the written order of the general.\r\n\r\nWith us, to-day, the law and regulations are that, no matter what\r\nmay be the emergency, the commanding general in Texas, New Mexico,\r\nand the remote frontiers, cannot draw from the arsenals a pistol-\r\ncartridge, or any sort of ordnance-stores, without first procuring\r\nan order of the Secretary of War in Washington.  The commanding\r\ngeneral--though intrusted with the lives of his soldiers and with\r\nthe safety of a frontier in a condition of chronic war--cannot\r\ntouch or be trusted with ordnance-stores or property, and that is\r\ndeclared to be the law!  Every officer of the old army remembers\r\nhow, in 1861, we were hampered with the old blue army regulations,\r\nwhich  tied our hands, and that to do any thing positive and\r\nnecessary we had to tear it all to pieces--cut the red-tape, as it\r\nwas called, a dangerous thing for an army to do, for it was\r\ncalculated to bring the law and authority into contempt; but war\r\nwas upon us, and overwhelming necessity overrides all law.\r\n\r\nThis French report is well worth the study of our army-officers, of\r\nall grades and classes, and I will only refer again, casually, to\r\nanother part, wherein it discusses the subject of military\r\ncorrespondence: whether the staff-officer should correspond\r\ndirectly with his chief in Paris, submitting to his general copies,\r\nor whether he should be required to carry on his correspondence\r\nthrough his general, so that the latter could promptly forward the\r\ncommunication, indorsed with his own remarks and opinions.  The\r\nlatter is declared by the board to be the only safe role, because\r\n\"the general should never be ignorant of any thing that is\r\ntranspiring that concerns his command.\"\r\n\r\nIn this country, as in France, Congress controls the great\r\nquestions of war and peace, makes all laws for the creation and\r\ngovernment of armies, and votes the necessary supplies, leaving to\r\nthe President to execute and apply these laws, especially the\r\nharder task of limiting the expenditure of public money to the\r\namount of the annual appropriations.  The executive power is\r\nfurther subdivided into the seven great departments, and to the\r\nSecretary of War is confided the general care of the military\r\nestablishment, and his powers are further subdivided into ten\r\ndistinct and separate bureaus.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of these bureaus are under the immediate orders of the\r\nSecretary of War, who, through them, in fact commands the army from\r\n\"his office,\" but cannot do so \"in the field\"--an absurdity in\r\nmilitary if not civil law.\r\n\r\nThe subordinates of these staff-corps and departments are selected\r\nand chosen from the army itself, or fresh from West Point, and too\r\ncommonly construe themselves into the elite, as made of better clay\r\nthan the common soldier.  Thus they separate themselves more and\r\nmore from their comrades of the line, and in process of time\r\nrealize the condition of that old officer of artillery who thought\r\nthe army would be a delightful place for a gentleman if it were not\r\nfor the d-d soldier; or, better still, the conclusion of the young\r\nlord in \"Henry IV.,\" who told Harry Percy (Hotspur) that \"but for\r\nthese vile guns he would himself have been a soldier.\"  This is all\r\nwrong; utterly at variance with our democratic form of government\r\nand of universal experience; and now that the French, from whom we\r\nhad copied the system, have utterly \"proscribed\" it, I hope that\r\nour Congress will follow suit.  I admit, in its fullest force, the\r\nstrength of the maxim that the civil law should be superior to the\r\nmilitary in time of peace; that the army should be at all times\r\nsubject to the direct control of Congress; and I assert that, from\r\nthe formation of our Government to the present day, the Regular\r\nArmy has set the highest example of obedience to law and authority;\r\nbut, for the very reason that our army is comparatively so very\r\nsmall, I hold that it should be the best possible, organized and\r\ngoverned on true military principles, and that in time of peace we\r\nshould preserve the \"habits and usages of war,\" so that, when war\r\ndoes come, we may not again be compelled to suffer the disgrace,\r\nconfusion, and disorder of 1861.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officers of divisions, departments, and posts,\r\nshould have the amplest powers, not only to command their troops,\r\nbut all the stores designed for their use, and the officers of the\r\nstaff necessary to administer them, within the area of their\r\ncommand; and then with fairness they could be held to the most\r\nperfect responsibility.  The President and Secretary of War can\r\ncommand the army quite as well through these generals as through\r\nthe subordinate staff-officers.  Of course, the Secretary would, as\r\nnow, distribute the funds according to the appropriation bills, and\r\nreserve to himself the absolute control and supervision of the\r\nlarger arsenals and depots of supply.  The error lies in the law,\r\nor in the judicial interpretation thereof, and no code of army\r\nregulations can be made that meets the case, until Congress, like\r\nthe French Corps Legislatif, utterly annihilates and \"proscribes\"\r\nthe old law and the system which has grown up under it.\r\n\r\nIt is related of Napoleon that his last words were, \"Tete d'armée!\"\r\nDoubtless, as the shadow of death obscured his memory, the last\r\nthought that remained for speech was of some event when he was\r\ndirecting an important \"head of column.\"  I believe that every\r\ngeneral who has handled armies in battle most recall from his own\r\nexperience the intensity of thought on some similar occasion, when\r\nby a single command he had given the finishing stroke to some\r\ncomplicated action; but to me recurs another thought that is worthy\r\nof record, and may encourage others who are to follow us in our\r\nprofession.  I never saw the rear of an army engaged in battle but\r\nI feared that some calamity had happened at the front the apparent\r\nconfusion, broken wagons, crippled horses, men lying about dead and\r\nmaimed, parties hastening to and fro in seeming disorder, and a\r\ngeneral apprehension of something dreadful about to ensue; all\r\nthese signs, however, lessened as I neared the front, and there the\r\ncontrast was complete--perfect order, men and horses--full of\r\nconfidence, and it was not unusual for general hilarity, laughing,\r\nand cheering.  Although cannon might be firing, the musketry\r\nclattering, and the enemy's shot hitting close, there reigned a\r\ngeneral feeling of strength and security that bore a marked\r\ncontrast to the bloody signs that had drifted rapidly to the rear;\r\ntherefore, for comfort and safety, I surely would rather be at the\r\nfront than the rear line of battle.  So also on the march, the head\r\nof a column moves on steadily, while the rear is alternately\r\nhalting and then rushing forward to close up the gap; and all sorts\r\nof rumors, especially the worst, float back to the rear.  Old\r\ntroops invariably deem it a special privilege to be in the front\r\n--to be at the \"head of column\"--because experience has taught them\r\nthat it is the easiest and most comfortable place, and danger only\r\nadds zest and stimulus to this fact.\r\n\r\nThe hardest task in war is to lie in support of some position or\r\nbattery, under fire without the privilege of returning it; or to\r\nguard some train left in the rear, within hearing but out of\r\ndanger; or to provide for the wounded and dead of some corps which\r\nis too busy ahead to care for its own.\r\n\r\nTo be at the head of a strong column of troops, in the execution of\r\nsome task that requires brain, is the highest pleasure of war--a\r\ngrim one and terrible, but which leaves on the mind and memory the\r\nstrongest mark; to detect the weak point of an enemy's line; to\r\nbreak through with vehemence and thus lead to victory; or to\r\ndiscover some key-point and hold it with tenacity; or to do some\r\nother distinct act which is afterward recognized as the real cause\r\nof success.  These all become matters that are never forgotten.\r\nOther great difficulties, experienced by every general, are to\r\nmeasure truly the thousand-and-one reports that come to him in the\r\nmidst of conflict; to preserve a clear and well-defined purpose at\r\nevery instant of time, and to cause all efforts to converge to that\r\nend.\r\n\r\nTo do these things he must know perfectly the strength and quality\r\nof each part of his own army, as well as that of his opponent, and\r\nmust be where he can personally see and observe with his own eyes,\r\nand judge with his own mind.  No man can properly command an army\r\nfrom the rear, he must be \"at its front;\" and when a detachment is\r\nmade, the commander thereof should be informed of the object to be\r\naccomplished, and left as free as possible to execute it in his own\r\nway; and when an army is divided up into several parts, the\r\nsuperior should always attend that one which he regards as most\r\nimportant.  Some men think that modern armies may be so regulated\r\nthat a general can sit in an office and play on his several columns\r\nas on the keys of a piano; this is a fearful mistake.  The\r\ndirecting mind must be at the very head of the army--must be seen\r\nthere, and the effect of his mind and personal energy must be felt\r\nby every officer and man present with it, to secure the best\r\nresults.  Every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in\r\nhumiliation and disaster.\r\n\r\nLastly, mail facilities should be kept up with an army if possible,\r\nthat officers and men may receive and send letters to their\r\nfriends, thus maintaining the home influence of infinite assistance\r\nto discipline.  Newspaper correspondents with an army, as a rule,\r\nare mischievous.  They are the world's gossips, pick up and retail\r\nthe camp scandal, and gradually drift to the headquarters of some\r\ngeneral, who finds it easier to make reputation at home than with\r\nhis own corps or division.  They are also tempted to prophesy\r\nevents and state facts which, to an enemy, reveal a purpose in time\r\nto guard against it.  Moreover, they are always bound to see facts\r\ncolored by the partisan or political character of their own\r\npatrons, and thus bring army officers into the political\r\ncontroversies of the day, which are always mischievous and wrong.\r\nYet, so greedy are the people at large for war news, that it is\r\ndoubtful whether any army commander can exclude all reporters,\r\nwithout bringing down on himself a clamor that may imperil his own\r\nsafety.  Time and moderation must bring a just solution to this\r\nmodern difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE WAR\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages I have endeavored to describe the public\r\nevents in which I was an actor or spectator before and during the\r\ncivil war of 1861-'65, and it now only remains for me to treat of\r\nsimilar matters of general interest subsequent to the civil war.\r\nWithin a few days of the grand review of May 24, 1865, I took leave\r\nof the army at Washington, and with my family went to Chicago to\r\nattend a fair held in the interest of the families of soldiers\r\nimpoverished by the war.  I remained there about two weeks; on the\r\n22d of June was at South Bend, Indiana, where two of my children\r\nwere at school, and reached my native place, Lancaster, Ohio, on\r\nthe 24th.  On the 4th of July I visited at Louisville, Kentucky,\r\nthe Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Army Corps,\r\nwhich had come from Washington, under the command of General John\r\nA. Logan, for \"muster out,\" or \"further orders.\"  I then made a\r\nshort visit to General George H. Thomas at Nashville, and returned\r\nto Lancaster, where I remained with the family till the receipt of\r\nGeneral Orders No. 118 of June 27, 1865, which divided the whole\r\nterritory of the United States into nineteen departments and five\r\nmilitary divisions, the second of which was the military division\r\nof the \"Mississippi,\" afterward changed to \"Missouri,\" Major-\r\nGeneral W. T. Sherman to command, with, headquarters at St. Louis,\r\nto embrace the Departments of the Ohio, Missouri, and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThis territorial command included the States north of the Ohio\r\nRiver, and the States and Territories north of Texas, as far west\r\nas the Rocky Mountains, including Montana, Utah, and New Mexico,\r\nbut the part east of the Mississippi was soon transferred to\r\nanother division.  The department commanders were General E. O. C.\r\nOrd, at Detroit; General John Pope, at Fort Leavenworth; and\r\nGeneral J. J. Reynolds, at Little Rock, but these also were soon\r\nchanged.  I at once assumed command, and ordered my staff and\r\nheadquarters from Washington to St. Louis, Missouri, going there in\r\nperson on the 16th of July.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts and feelings at once reverted to the construction of\r\nthe great Pacific Railway, which had been chartered by Congress in\r\nthe midst of war, and was then in progress.  I put myself in\r\ncommunication with the parties engaged in the work, visiting them\r\nin person, and assured them that I would afford them all possible\r\nassistance and encouragement.  Dr. Durant, the leading man of the\r\nUnion Pacific, seemed to me a person of ardent nature, of great\r\nability and energy, enthusiastic in his undertaking, and determined\r\nto build the road from Omaha to San Francisco.  He had an able\r\ncorps of assistants, collecting materials, letting out contracts\r\nfor ties, grading, etc., and I attended the celebration of the\r\nfirst completed division of sixteen and a half miles, from Omaha to\r\nPapillon.  When the orators spoke so confidently of the\r\ndetermination to build two thousand miles of railway across the\r\nplains, mountains, and desert, devoid of timber, with no\r\npopulation, but on the contrary raided by the bold and bloody Sioux\r\nand Cheyennes, who had almost successfully defied our power for\r\nhalf a century, I was disposed to treat it jocularly, because I\r\ncould not help recall our California experience of 1855-'56, when\r\nwe celebrated the completion of twenty-two and a half miles of the\r\nsame road eastward of Sacramento; on which occasion Edward Baker\r\nhad electrified us by his unequalled oratory, painting the glorious\r\nthings which would result from uniting the Western coast with the\r\nEast by bands of iron.  Baker then, with a poet's imagination, saw\r\nthe vision of the mighty future, but not the gulf which meantime\r\nwas destined to swallow up half a million of the brightest and best\r\nyouth of our land, and that he himself would be one of the first\r\nvictims far away on the banks of the Potomac (he was killed in\r\nbattle at Balls Bluff, October 21, 1861).\r\n\r\nThe Kansas Pacific was designed to unite with the main branch about\r\nthe 100 deg. meridian, near Fort Kearney.  Mr. Shoemaker was its\r\ngeneral superintendent and building contractor, and this branch in\r\n1865 was finished about forty miles to a point near Lawrence,\r\nKansas.  I may not be able to refer to these roads again except\r\nincidentally, and will, therefore, record here that the location of\r\nthis branch afterward was changed from the Republican to the Smoky\r\nHill Fork of the Kansas River, and is now the main line to Denver.\r\nThe Union and Central Railroads from the beginning were pushed with\r\na skill, vigor, and courage which always commanded my admiration,\r\nthe two meeting at Promontory Point, Utah, July 15, 1869, and in my\r\njudgment constitute one of the greatest and most beneficent\r\nachievements of man on earth.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Union Pacific Railroad was deemed so\r\nimportant that the President, at my suggestion, constituted on the\r\n5th of March, 1866, the new Department of the Platte, General P.\r\nSt. George Cooke commanding, succeeded by General C. C. Augur,\r\nheadquarters at Omaha, with orders to give ample protection to the\r\nworking-parties, and to afford every possible assistance in the\r\nconstruction of the road; and subsequently in like manner the\r\nDepartment of Dakota was constituted, General A. H. Terry\r\ncommanding, with headquarters at St. Paul, to give similar\r\nprotection and encouragement to the Northern Pacific Railroad.\r\nThese departments, with changed commanders, have continued up to\r\nthe present day, and have fulfilled perfectly the uses for which\r\nthey were designed.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1865 and 1866 the great plains remained almost in\r\na state of nature, being the pasture-fields of about ten million\r\nbuffalo, deer, elk, and antelope, and were in full possession of\r\nthe Sioux, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Kiowas, a race of bold\r\nIndians, who saw plainly that the construction of two parallel\r\nrailroads right through their country would prove destructive to\r\nthe game on which they subsisted, and consequently fatal to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe troops were posted to the best advantage to protect the parties\r\nengaged in building these roads, and in person I reconnoitred well\r\nto the front, traversing the buffalo regions from south to north,\r\nand from east to west, often with a very small escort, mingling\r\nwith the Indians whenever safe, and thereby gained personal\r\nknowledge of matters which enabled me to use the troops to the best\r\nadvantage.  I am sure that without the courage and activity of the\r\ndepartment commanders with the small bodies of regular troops on\r\nthe plains during the years 1866-'69, the Pacific Railroads could\r\nnot have been built; but once built and in full operation the fate\r\nof the buffalo and Indian was settled for all time to come.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the civil war there were one million five hundred\r\nand sixteen names on the muster-rolls, of which seven hundred and\r\nninety-seven thousand eight hundred and seven were present, and two\r\nhundred and two thousand seven hundred and nine absent, of which\r\ntwenty-two thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine were regulars, the\r\nothers were volunteers, colored troops, and veteran reserves.  The\r\nregulars consisted of six regiments of cavalry, five of artillery,\r\nand nineteen of infantry.  By the act of July 28, 1866, the peace\r\nestablishment was fixed at one general (Grant), one lieutenant-\r\ngeneral (Sherman), five major-generals (Halleck, Meade, Sheridan,\r\nThomas, and Hancock), ten brigadiers (McDowell, Cooke, Pope,\r\nHooker, Schofield, Howard, Terry, Ord, Canby, and Rousseau), ten\r\nregiments of cavalry, five of artillery, and forty-five of\r\ninfantry, admitting of an aggregate force of fifty-four thousand\r\nsix hundred and forty-one men.\r\n\r\nAll others were mustered out, and thus were remanded to their homes\r\nnearly a million of strong, vigorous men who had imbibed the\r\nsomewhat erratic habits of the soldier; these were of every\r\nprofession and trade in life, who, on regaining their homes, found\r\ntheir places occupied by others, that their friends and neighbors\r\nwere different, and that they themselves had changed.  They\r\nnaturally looked for new homes to the great West, to the new\r\nTerritories and States as far as the Pacific coast, and we realize\r\nto-day that the vigorous men who control Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota,\r\nMontana, Colorado, etc., etc., were soldiers of the civil war.\r\nThese men flocked to the plains, and were rather stimulated than\r\nretarded by the danger of an Indian war.  This was another potent\r\nagency in producing the result we enjoy to-day, in having in so\r\nshort a time replaced the wild buffaloes by more numerous herds of\r\ntame cattle, and by substituting for the useless Indians the\r\nintelligent owners of productive farms and cattle-ranches.\r\n\r\nWhile these great changes were being wrought at the West, in the\r\nEast politics had resumed full sway, and all the methods of\r\nanti-war times had been renewed.  President Johnson had differed\r\nwith his party as to the best method of reconstructing the State\r\ngovernments of the South, which had been destroyed and impoverished\r\nby the war, and the press began to agitate the question of the next\r\nPresident.  Of course, all Union men naturally turned to General\r\nGrant, and the result was jealousy of him by the personal friends\r\nof President Johnson and some of his cabinet.  Mr. Johnson always\r\nseemed very patriotic and friendly, and I believed him honest and\r\nsincere in his declared purpose to follow strictly the Constitution\r\nof the United States in restoring the Southern States to their\r\nnormal place in the Union; but the same cordial friendship\r\nsubsisted between General Grant and myself, which was the outgrowth\r\nof personal relations dating back to 1839.  So I resolved to keep\r\nout of this conflict.  In September, 1866, I was in the mountains\r\nof New Mexico, when a message reached me that I was wanted at\r\nWashington.  I had with me a couple of officers and half a dozen\r\nsoldiers as escort, and traveled down the Arkansas, through the\r\nKiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, and Arapahoes, all more or less\r\ndisaffected, but reached St. Louis in safety, and proceeded to\r\nWashington, where I reported to General Grant.\r\n\r\nHe explained to me that President Johnson wanted to see me.  He did\r\nnot know the why or wherefore, but supposed it had some connection\r\nwith an order he (General Grant) had received to escort the newly\r\nappointed Minister, Hon. Lew Campbell, of Ohio, to the court of\r\nJuarez, the President-elect of Mexico, which country was still in\r\npossession of the Emperor Maximilian, supported by a corps of\r\nFrench troops commanded by General Bazaine.  General Grant denied\r\nthe right of the President to order him on a diplomatic mission\r\nunattended by troops; said that he had thought the matter over,\r\nworld disobey the order, and stand the consequences.  He manifested\r\nmuch feeling; and said it was a plot to get rid of him.  I then\r\nwent to President Johnson, who treated me with great cordiality,\r\nand said that he was very glad I had come; that General Grant was\r\nabout to go to Mexico on business of importance, and he wanted me\r\nat Washington to command the army in General Grant's absence.  I\r\nthen informed him that General Grant would not go, and he seemed\r\namazed; said that it was generally understood that General Grant\r\nconstrued the occupation of the territories of our neighbor,\r\nMexico, by French troops, and the establishment of an empire\r\ntherein, with an Austrian prince at its head, as hostile to\r\nrepublican America, and that the Administration had arranged with\r\nthe French Government for the withdrawal of Bazaine's troops, which\r\nwould leave the country free for the President-elect Juarez to\r\nreoccupy the city of Mexico, etc., etc.; that Mr. Campbell had been\r\naccredited to Juarez, and the fact that he was accompanied by so\r\ndistinguished a soldier as General Grant would emphasize the act of\r\nthe United States.  I simply reiterated that General Grant would\r\nnot go, and that he, Mr. Johnson, could not afford to quarrel with\r\nhim at that time.  I further argued that General Grant was at the\r\nmoment engaged on the most delicate and difficult task of\r\nreorganizing the army under the act of July 28, 1866; that if the\r\nreal object was to put Mr. Campbell in official communication with\r\nPresident Juarez, supposed to be at El Paso or Monterey, either\r\nGeneral Hancock, whose command embraced New Mexico, or General\r\nSheridan, whose command included Texas, could fulfill the object\r\nperfectly; or, in the event of neither of these alternates proving\r\nsatisfactory to the Secretary of State, that I could be easier\r\nspared than General Grant.  \"Certainly,\" answered the President,\r\n\"if you will go, that will answer perfectly.\"\r\n\r\nThe instructions of the Secretary of State, W. H. Seward, to Hon.\r\nLewis D.  Campbell, Minister to Mexico, dated October 25, 1866; a\r\nletter from President Johnson to Secretary of War Stanton, dated\r\nOctober 26, 1866; and the letter of Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of\r\nWar, to General Grant, dated October 27th, had been already\r\nprepared and printed, and the originals or copies were furnished\r\nme; but on the 30th of October, 1866, the following letter passed\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., October 30,1866.\r\n\r\nSIR: General Ulysses S. Grant having found it inconvenient to\r\nassume the duties specified in my letter to you of the 26th inst.,\r\nyou will please relieve him, and assign them in all respects to\r\nWilliam T. Sherman, Lieutenant-General of the Army of the United\r\nStates.  By way of guiding General Sherman in the performance of\r\nhis duties, you will furnish him with a copy of your special orders\r\nto General Grant made in compliance with my letter of the 26th\r\ninst., together with a copy of the instructions of the Secretary of\r\nState to Lewis D. Campbell, Esq., therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-general will proceed to the execution of his duties\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully yours,\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON\r\nTo the Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nAt the Navy Department I learned that the United States ship\r\nSusquehanna, Captain Alden, was fitting out in New York for the use\r\nof this mission, and that there would be time for me to return to\r\nSt. Louis to make arrangements for a prolonged absence, as also to\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Campbell, who was still at his home in\r\nHamilton, Ohio.  By correspondence we agreed to meet in New York,\r\nNovember 8th, he accompanied by Mr. Plumb, secretary of legation,\r\nand I by my aide, Colonel Audenried.\r\n\r\nWe embarked November 10th, and went to sea next day, making for\r\nHavana and Vera Cruz, and, as soon as we were outside of Sandy\r\nHook, I explained to Captain Alden that my mission was ended,\r\nbecause I believed by substituting myself for General Grant I had\r\nprevented a serious quarrel between him and the Administration,\r\nwhich was unnecessary.  We reached Havana on the 18th, with nothing\r\nto vary the monotony of an ordinary sea-voyage, except off Hatteras\r\nwe picked up one woman and twenty men from open boats, who had just\r\nabandoned a propeller bound from Baltimore to Charleston which\r\nfoundered.  The sea was very rough, but by the personal skill and\r\nsupervision of Captain Alden every soul reached our deck safely,\r\nand was carried to our consul at Havana.  At Havana we were very\r\nhandsomely entertained, especially by Senor Aldama, who took us by\r\nrail to his sugar-estates at Santa Ross, and back by Matanzas.\r\n\r\nWe took our departure thence on the 25th, and anchored under Isla\r\nVerde, off Vera Cruz, on the 29th.\r\n\r\nEverything about Vera Cruz indicated the purpose of the French to\r\nwithdraw, and also that the Emperor Maximilian would precede them,\r\nfor the Austrian frigate Dandolo was in port, and an Austrian bark,\r\non which were received, according to the report of our consul, Mr.\r\nLane, as many as eleven hundred packages of private furniture to be\r\ntransferred to Miramar, Maximilian's home; and Lieutenant Clarin,\r\nof the French navy, who visited the Susquehanna from the French\r\ncommodore, Clouet, told me, without reserve, that, if we had\r\ndelayed eight days more, we would have found Maximilian gone.\r\nGeneral Bazaine was reported to be in the city of Mexico with about\r\ntwenty-eight thousand French troops; but instead of leaving Mexico\r\nin three detachments, viz., November, 1866, March, 1867, and\r\nNovember, 1867, as described in Mr. Seward's letter to Mr.\r\nCampbell, of October 25, 1866, it looked to me that, as a soldier,\r\nhe would evacuate at some time before November, 1867, all at once,\r\nand not by detachments.  Lieutenant Clarin telegraphed Bazaine at\r\nthe city of Mexico the fact of our arrival, and he sent me a most\r\ncourteous and pressing invitation to come up to the city; but, as\r\nwe were accredited to the government of Juarez, it was considered\r\nundiplomatic to establish friendly relations with the existing\r\nauthorities.  Meantime we could not hear a word of Juarez, and\r\nconcluded to search for him along the coast northward.  When I was\r\nin Versailles, France, July, 1872, learning that General Bazaine\r\nwas in arrest for the surrender of his army and post at Metz, in\r\n1870, I wanted to call on him to thank him for his courteous\r\ninvitation to me at Vera Cruz in 1866.  I inquired of President\r\nThiera if I could with propriety call on the marshal.  He answered\r\nthat it would be very acceptable, no doubt, but suggested for\r\nform's sake that I should consult the Minister of War, General de\r\nCissey, which I did, and he promptly assented.  Accordingly, I\r\ncalled with my aide, Colonel Audenried, on Marshal Bazaine, who\r\noccupied a small, two-story stone house at Versailles, in an\r\ninclosure with a high garden wall, at the front gate or door of\r\nwhich was a lodge, in which was a military guard.  We were shown to\r\na good room on the second floor, where was seated the marshal in\r\nmilitary half-dress, with large head, full face, short neck, and\r\nevidently a man of strong physique.  He did not speak English, but\r\nspoke Spanish perfectly.  We managed to carry on a conversation in\r\nwhich I endeavored to convey my sense of his politeness in inviting\r\nme so cordially up to the city of Mexico, and my regret that the\r\npeculiar duty on which I was engaged did not admit of a compliance,\r\nor even of an intelligent explanation, at the time.  He spoke of\r\nthe whole Mexican business as a \"sad affair,\" that the empire\r\nnecessarily fell with the result of our civil war, and that poor\r\nMaximilian was sacrificed to his own high sense of honor.\r\n\r\nWhile on board the Susquehanna, on the 1st day of December, 1866,\r\nwe received the proclamation made by the Emperor Maximilian at\r\nOrizaba, in which, notwithstanding the near withdrawal of the\r\nFrench troops, he declared his purpose to remain and \"shed the last\r\ndrop of his blood in defense of his dear country.\"  Undoubtedly\r\nmany of the most substantial people of Mexico, having lost all\r\nfaith in the stability of the native government, had committed\r\nthemselves to what they considered the more stable government of\r\nMaximilian, and Maximilian, a man of honor, concluded at the last\r\nmoment he could not abandon them; the consequence was his death.\r\n\r\nFailing to hear of Juarez, we steamed up the coast to the Island of\r\nLobos, and on to Tampico, off which we found the United States\r\nsteamer Paul Jones, which, drawing less water than the Susquehanna,\r\ncarried us over the bar to the city, then in possession of the\r\nLiberal party, which recognized Juarez as their constitutional\r\nPresident, but of Juarez and his whereabout we could hear not a\r\nword; so we continued up the coast and anchored off Brazos\r\nSantiago, December 7th.  Going ashore in small boats, we found a\r\nrailroad, under the management of General J. R. West, now one of\r\nthe commissioners of the city of Washington, who sent us up to\r\nBrownsville, Texas.  We met on the way General Sheridan, returning\r\nfrom a tour of inspection of the Rio Grande frontier.  On Sunday,\r\nDecember 9th, we were all at Matamoras, Mexico, where we met\r\nGeneral Escobedo, one of Juarez's trusty lieutenants, who developed\r\nto us the general plan agreed on for the overthrow of the empire,\r\nand the reestablishment of the republican government of Mexico.  He\r\nasked of us no assistance, except the loan of some arms,\r\nammunition, clothing, and camp-equipage.  It was agreed that Mr.\r\nCampbell should, as soon as he could get his baggage off the\r\nSusquehanna, return to Matamoras, and thence proceed to Monterey,\r\nto be received by Juarez in person as, the accredited Minister of\r\nthe United States to the Republic of Mexico.  Meantime the weather\r\noff the coast was stormy, and the Susquehanna parted a cable, so\r\nthat we were delayed some days at Brazos; but in due time Mr.\r\nCampbell got his baggage, and we regained the deck of the\r\nSusquehanna, which got up steam and started for New Orleans.  We\r\nreached New Orleans December 20th, whence I reported fully\r\neverything to General Grant, and on the 21st received the following\r\ndispatch:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 21,1866.\r\nLieutenant-General SHERMAN, New Orleans.\r\n\r\nYour telegram of yesterday has been submitted to the President.\r\nYou are authorized to proceed to St. Louis at your convenience.\r\nYour proceedings in the special and delicate duties assigned you\r\nare cordially approved by the President and Cabinet and this\r\ndepartment.\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON.\r\n\r\nAnd on the same day I received this dispatch\r\n\r\nGALVESTON, December 21, 1866.\r\nTo General SHERMAN, or General SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\nWill be in New Orleans to-morrow.  Wish to see you both on arrival,\r\non matters of importance.\r\nLEWIS D. CAMPBELL, Minister to Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell arrived on the 22d, but had nothing to tell of the\r\nleast importance, save that he was generally disgusted with the\r\nwhole thing, and had not found Juarez at all.  I am sure this whole\r\nmovement was got up for the purpose of getting General Grant away\r\nfrom Washington, on the pretext of his known antagonism to the\r\nFrench occupation of Mexico, because he was looming up as a\r\ncandidate for President, and nobody understood the animus and\r\npurpose better than did Mr. Stanton.  He himself was not then on\r\ngood terms with President Johnson, and with several of his\r\nassociates in the Cabinet.  By Christmas I was back in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nBy this time the conflict between President Johnson and Congress\r\nhad become open and unconcealed.  Congress passed the bill known as\r\nthe \"Tenure of Civil Office\" on the 2d of March, 1867 (over the\r\nPresident's veto), the first clause of which, now section 1767 of\r\nthe Revised Statutes, reads thus: \"Every person who holds any civil\r\noffice to which he has been or hereafter may be appointed, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, and who shall have\r\nbecome duly qualified to act therein, shall be entitled to hold\r\nsuch office during the term for which he was appointed, unless\r\nsooner removed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or\r\nby the appointment with the like advice and consent of a successor\r\nin his place, except as herein otherwise provided.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral E. D. Townsend, in his \"Anecdotes of the Civil War,\" states\r\ntersely and correctly the preliminary circumstances of which I must\r\ntreat.  He says: \"On Monday morning, August 5, 1867, President\r\nJohnson invited Mr. Stanton to resign as Secretary of War.  Under\r\nthe tenure-of-civil-office law, Mr. Stanton declined.  The President\r\na week after suspended him, and appointed General Grant, General-\r\nin-Chief of the Army, to exercise the functions.  This continued\r\nuntil January 13, 1868, when according to the law the Senate passed\r\na resolution not sustaining the President's action.  The next\r\nmorning General Grant came to my office and handed me the key of\r\nthe Secretary's room, saying: 'I am to be found over at my office\r\nat army headquarters.  I was served with a copy of the Senate\r\nresolution last evening.'  I then went up-stairs and delivered the\r\nkey of his room to Mr. Stanton.\"\r\n\r\nThe mode and manner of Mr. Stanton's regaining his office, and of\r\nGeneral Grant's surrendering it, were at the time subjects of\r\nbitter controversy.  Unhappily I was involved, and must bear\r\ntestimony.  In all January, 1868, I was a member of a board ordered\r\nto compile a code of articles of war and army regulations, of which\r\nMajor-General Sheridan and Brigadier-General C. C. Augur were\r\nassociate members.  Our place of meeting was in the room of the old\r\nWar Department, second floor, next to the corner room occupied by\r\nthe Secretary of War, with a door of communication.  While we were\r\nat work it was common for General Grant and, afterward, for Mr.\r\nStanton to drop in and chat with us on the social gossip of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, January 11th, General Grant said that he had more\r\ncarefully read the law (tenure of civil office), and it was\r\ndifferent from what he had supposed; that in case the Senate did\r\nnot consent to the removal of Secretary of War Stanton, and he\r\n(Grant) should hold on, he should incur a liability of ten thousand\r\ndollars and five years' imprisonment.  We all expected the\r\nresolution of Senator Howard, of Michigan, virtually restoring Mr.\r\nStanton to his office, would pass the Senate, and knowing that the\r\nPresident expected General Grant to hold on, I inquired if he had\r\ngiven notice of his change of purpose; he answered that there was\r\nno hurry, because he supposed Mr. Stanton would pursue toward him\r\n(Grant) the same course which he (Stanton) had required of him the\r\npreceding August, viz., would address him a letter claiming the\r\noffice, and allow him a couple of days for the change.  Still, he\r\nsaid he would go to the White House the same day and notify the\r\nPresident of his intended action.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I went over to the White House to present General\r\nPope, who was on a visit to Washington, and we found the President\r\nand General Grant together.  We made our visit and withdrew,\r\nleaving them still together, and I always supposed the subject of\r\nthis conference was the expected decision of the Senate, which\r\nwould in effect restore Mr. Stanton to his civil office of\r\nSecretary of War.  That evening I dined with the Hon. Reverdy\r\nJohnson, Senator from Maryland, and suggested to him that the best\r\nway to escape a conflict was for the President to nominate some\r\ngood man as Secretary of War whose confirmation by the Senate would\r\nfall within the provisions of the law, and named General J. D. Cox,\r\nthen Governor of Ohio, whose term of office was drawing to a close,\r\nwho would, I knew, be acceptable to General Grant and the army\r\ngenerally.  Mr. Johnson was most favorably impressed with this\r\nsuggestion, and promised to call on the President the next day\r\n(Sunday), which he did, but President Johnson had made up his mind\r\nto meet the conflict boldly.  I saw General Grant that afternoon at\r\nhis house on I Street, and told him what I had done, and so anxious\r\nwas he about it that he came to our room at the War Department the\r\nnext morning (Monday), the 13th, and asked me to go in person to\r\nthe White House to urge the President to send in the name of\r\nGeneral Cox.  I did so, saw the President, and inquired if he had\r\nseen Mr. Reverdy Johnson the day before about General Cox.  He\r\nanswered that he had, and thought well of General Cox, but would\r\nsay no further.\r\n\r\nTuesday, January 14, 1868, came, and with it Mr. Stanton.  He\r\nresumed possession of his former office; came into that where\r\nGeneral Sheridan, General Augur, and I were at work, and greeted us\r\nvery cordially.  He said he wanted to see me when at leisure, and\r\nat half-past 10 A.M.  I went into his office and found him and\r\nGeneral Grant together.  Supposing they had some special matters of\r\nbusiness, I withdrew, with the remark that I was close at hand, and\r\ncould come in at any moment.  In the afternoon I went again into\r\nMr. Stanton's office, and we had a long and most friendly\r\nconversation; but not one word was spoken about the\r\n\"tenure-of-office\" matter.  I then crossed over Seventeenth Street\r\nto the headquarters of the army, where I found General Grant, who\r\nexpressed himself as by no means pleased with the manner in which\r\nMr. Stanton had regained his office, saying that he had sent a\r\nmessenger for him that morning as of old, with word that \"he wanted\r\nto see him.\"  We then arranged to meet at his office the next\r\nmorning at half-past nine, and go together to see the President.\r\n\r\nThat morning the National Intelligencer published an article\r\naccusing General Grant of acting in bad faith to the President, and\r\nof having prevaricated in making his personal explanation to the\r\nCabinet, so that General Grant at first felt unwilling to go, but\r\nwe went.  The President received us promptly and kindly.  Being\r\nseated, General Grant said, \"Mr. President, whoever gave the facts\r\nfor the article of the Intelligencer of this morning has made some\r\nserious mistakes.\"  The President: \"General Grant, let me interrupt\r\nyou just there.  I have not seen the Intelligencer of this morning,\r\nand have no knowledge of the contents of any article therein\"\r\nGeneral Grant then went on: \"Well, the idea is given there that I\r\nhave not kept faith with you.  Now, Mr. President, I remember, when\r\nyou spoke to me on this subject last summer, I did say that, like\r\nthe case of the Baltimore police commissioners, I did suppose Mr.\r\nStanton could not regain his office except by a process through the\r\ncourts.\"  To this the President assented, saying he \"remembered the\r\nreference to the case of the Baltimore commissioners,\" when General\r\nGrant resumed: \"I said if I changed my opinion I would give you\r\nnotice, and put things as they were before my appointment as\r\nSecretary of War ad interim.\"\r\n\r\nWe then entered into a general friendly conversation, both parties\r\nprofessing to be satisfied, the President claiming that he had\r\nalways been most friendly to General Grant, and the latter\r\ninsisting that he had taken the office, not for honor or profit,\r\nbut in the general interests of the army.\r\n\r\nAs we withdrew, at the very door, General Grant said, \"Mr.\r\nPresident, you should make some order that we of the army are not\r\nbound to obey the orders of Mr. Stanton as Secretary of War,\" which\r\nthe President intimated he would do.\r\n\r\nNo such \"orders\" were ever made; many conferences were held, and\r\nthe following letters are selected out of a great mass to show the\r\ngeneral feeling at the time:\r\n\r\n\r\n1321 K STREET, WASHINGTON,\r\nJanuary 28,1868, Saturday.\r\n\r\nTo the President:\r\n\r\nI neglected this morning to say that I had agreed to go down to\r\nAnnapolis to spend Sunday with Admiral Porter.  General Grant also\r\nhas to leave for Richmond on Monday morning at 6 A.M.\r\n\r\nAt a conversation with the General after our interview, wherein I\r\noffered to go with him on Monday morning to Mr. Stanton, and to say\r\nthat it was our joint opinion be should resign, it was found\r\nimpossible by reason of his (General Grant) going to Richmond and\r\nmy going to Annapolis.  The General proposed this course: He will\r\ncall on you to-morrow, and offer to go to Mr. Stanton to say, for\r\nthe good of the Army and of the country, he ought to resign.  This\r\non Sunday.  On Monday I will again call on you, and, if you think\r\nit necessary, I will do the same, viz., go to Mr. Stanton and tell\r\nhim he should resign.\r\n\r\nIf he will not, then it will be time to contrive ulterior measures.\r\nIn the mean time it so happens that no necessity exists for\r\nprecipitating matters.\r\nYours truly,\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: On the point of starting, I have written the above,\r\nand will send a fair copy of it to the President.  Please retain\r\nthis, that in case of necessity I may have a copy.  The President\r\nclearly stated to me that he relied on us in this category.\r\n\r\nThink of the propriety of your putting in writing what you have to\r\nsay tomorrow, even if you have to put it in the form of a letter to\r\nhand him in person, retaining a copy.  I'm afraid that acting as a\r\ngo-between for three persons, I may share the usual fate of\r\nmeddlers, at last get kinks from all.  We ought not to be involved\r\nin politics, but for the sake of the Army we are justified in\r\ntrying at least to cut this Gordian knot, which they do not appear\r\nto have any practicable plan to do.  In haste as usual,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\nJanuary 29, 1888.\r\n\r\nDEAR SHERMAN: I called on the President and Mr. Stanton to-day, but\r\nwithout any effect.\r\n\r\nI soon found that to recommend resignation to Mr. Stanton would\r\nhave no effect, unless it was to incur further his displeasure;\r\nand, therefore, did not directly suggest it to him.  I explained to\r\nhim, however, the course I supposed he would pursue, and what I\r\nexpected to do in that case, namely, to notify the President of his\r\nintentions, and thus leave him to violate the \"Tenure-of-Office\r\nBill\" if he chose, instead of having me do it.\r\n\r\nI would advise that you say nothing to Mr. Stanton on the subject\r\nunless he asks your advice.  It will do no good, and may embarrass\r\nyou.  I did not mention your name to him, at least not in\r\nconnection with his position, or what you thought upon it.\r\n\r\nAll that Mr. Johnson said was pacific and compromising.  While I\r\nthink he wanted the constitutionality of the \"Tenure Bill\" tested,\r\nI think now he would be glad either to get the vacancy of Secretary\r\nof War, or have the office just where it was during suspension.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S.  GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON D. C., January 27, 1868.\r\n\r\nTo the President.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: As I promised, I saw Mr. Ewing yesterday, and after a\r\nlong conversation asked him to put down his opinion in writing,\r\nwhich he has done and which I now inclose.\r\n\r\nI am now at work on these Army Regulations, and in the course of\r\npreparation have laid down the Constitution and laws now in force,\r\nclearer than I find them elsewhere; and beg leave herewith to\r\ninclose you three pages of printed matter for your perusal.  My\r\nopinion is, if you will adopt these rules and make them an\r\nexecutive order to General Grant, they will so clearly define the\r\nduties of all concerned that no conflict can arise.  I hope to get\r\nthrough this task in the course of this week, and want very much to\r\ngo to St. Louis.  For eleven years I have been tossed about so much\r\nthat I really do want to rest, study, and make the acquaintance of\r\nmy family.  I do not think, since 1857, I have averaged thirty days\r\nout of three hundred and sixty-five at home.\r\n\r\nNext summer also, in fulfillment of our promise to the Sioux, I\r\nmust go to Fort Phil Kearney early in the spring, so that, unless I\r\ncan spend the next two months at home, I might as well break up my\r\nhouse at St. Louis, and give up all prospect of taking care of my\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons especially I shall soon ask leave to go to St.\r\nLouis, to resume my proper and legitimate command.  With great\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Inclosure]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 25, 1868.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL: I am quite clear in the opinion that it is not\r\nexpedient for the President to take any action now in the case of\r\nStanton.  So far as he and his interests are concerned, things are\r\nin the best possible condition.  Stanton is in the Department, got\r\nhis secretary, but the secretary of the Senate, who have taken upon\r\nthemselves his sins, and who place him there under a large salary\r\nto annoy and obstruct the operations of the Executive.  This the\r\npeople well enough understand, and he is a stench in the nostrils\r\nof their own party.\r\n\r\nI thought the nomination of Cox at the proper juncture would have\r\nbeen wise as a peace-offering, but perhaps it would have let off\r\nthe Senate too easily from the effect of their arbitrary act.  Now\r\nthe dislodging of Stanton and filling the office even temporarily\r\nwithout the consent of the Senate would raise a question as to the\r\nlegality of the President's acts, and he would belong to the\r\nattacked instead of the attacking party.  If the war between\r\nCongress and the President is to go on, as I suppose it is, Stanton\r\nshould be ignored by the President, left to perform his clerical\r\nduties which the law requires him to perform, and let the party\r\nbear the odium which is already upon them for placing him where he\r\nis.  So much for the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to yourself, I wish you as far as possible to keep clear of\r\npolitical complications.  I do not think the President will require\r\nyou to do an act of doubtful legality.  Certainly he will not\r\nwithout sanction of the opinion of his Attorney-General; and you\r\nshould have time, in a questionable case, to consult with me before\r\ncalled upon to act.  The office of Secretary of War is a civil\r\noffice, as completely so as that of Secretary of State; and you as\r\na military officer cannot, I think, be required to assume or\r\nexercise it. This may, if necessary, be a subject for further\r\nconsideration.  Such, however, will not, I think, be the case.\r\nThe appeal is to the people, and it is better for the President to\r\npersist in the course he has for some time pursued--let the\r\naggressions all come from the other side; and I think there is no\r\ndoubt he will do so.  Affectionately,   T. EWING.\r\n\r\nTo--Lieutenant-General SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARY ROOM, WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 31, 1868.\r\n\r\nTo the President:\r\n\r\nSince our interview of yesterday I have given the subject of our\r\nconversation all my thoughts, and I beg you will pardon my reducing\r\nthe same to writing.\r\n\r\nMy personal preferences, as expressed, were to be allowed to return\r\nto St. Louis to resume my present command, because my command was\r\nimportant, large, suited to my rank and inclination, and because my\r\nfamily was well provided for there in house, facilities, schools,\r\nliving, and agreeable society; while, on the other hand, Washington\r\nwas for many (to me) good reasons highly objectionable, especially\r\nbecause it is the political capital of the country; and focus of\r\nintrigue, gossip, and slander.  Your personal preferences were, as\r\nexpressed, to make a new department East, adequate to my rank, with\r\nheadquarters at Washington, and assign me to its command, to remove\r\nmy family here, and to avail myself of its schools, etc.; to remove\r\nMr. Stanton from his office as Secretary of War, and have me to\r\ndischarge the duties.\r\n\r\nTo effect this removal two modes were indicated: to simply cause\r\nhim to quit the War-Office Building, and notify the Treasury\r\nDepartment and the Army Staff Departments no longer to respect him\r\nas Secretary of War; or to remove him and submit my name to the\r\nSenate for confirmation.\r\n\r\nPermit me to discuss these points a little, and I will premise by\r\nsaying that I have spoken to no one on the subject, and have not\r\neven seen Mr. Ewing, Mr. Stanbery, or General Grant, since I was\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nIt has been the rule and custom of our army, since the organization\r\nof the government, that the second officer of the army should be at\r\nthe second (in importance) command, and remote from general\r\nheadquarters.  To bring me to Washington world put three heads to\r\nan army, yourself, General Grant, and myself, and we would be more\r\nthan human if we were not to differ.  In my judgment it world ruin\r\nthe army, and would be fatal to one or two of us.\r\n\r\nGenerals Scott and Taylor proved themselves soldiers and patriots\r\nin the field, but Washington was fatal to both.  This city, and the\r\ninfluences that centre here, defeated every army that had its\r\nheadquarters here from 1861 to 1864, and would have overwhelmed\r\nGeneral Grant at Spottsylvania and Petersburg, had he not been\r\nfortified by a strong reputation, already hard-earned, and because\r\nno one then living coveted the place; whereas, in the West, we made\r\nprogress from the start, because there was no political capital\r\nnear enough to poison our minds, and kindle into life that craving,\r\nitching for fame which has killed more good men than bullets.  I\r\nhave been with General Grant in the midst of death and slaughter\r\nwhen the howls of people reached him after Shiloh; when messengers\r\nwere speeding to and from his army to Washington, bearing slanders,\r\nto induce his removal before he took Vicksburg; in Chattanooga,\r\nwhen the soldiers were stealing the corn of the starving mules to\r\nsatisfy their own hunger; at Nashville, when he was ordered to the\r\n\"forlorn hope\" to command the Army of the Potomac, so often\r\ndefeated--and yet I never saw him more troubled than since he has\r\nbeen in Washington, and been compelled to read himself a \"sneak and\r\ndeceiver,\" based on reports of four of the Cabinet, and apparently\r\nwith your knowledge.  If this political atmosphere can disturb the\r\nequanimity of one so guarded and so prudent as he is, what will be\r\nthe result with me, so careless, so outspoken as I am?  Therefore,\r\nwith my consent, Washington never.\r\n\r\nAs to the Secretary of War, his office is twofold.  As a Cabinet\r\nofficer he should not be there without your hearty, cheerful\r\nassent, and I believe that is the judgment and opinion of every\r\nfair-minded man.  As the holder of a civil office, having the\r\nsupervision of moneys appropriated by Congress and of contracts for\r\narmy supplies, I do think Congress, or the Senate by delegation\r\nfrom Congress, has a lawful right to be consulted.  At all events,\r\nI would not risk a suit or contest on that phase of the question.\r\nThe law of Congress, of March 2, 1867, prescribing the manner in\r\nwhich orders and instructions relating to \"military movements\"\r\nshall reach the army, gives you as constitutional Commander-in-\r\nChief the very power you want to exercise, and enables you to\r\nprevent the Secretary from making any such orders and instructions;\r\nand consequently he cannot control the army, but is limited and\r\nrestricted to a duty that an Auditor of the Treasury could perform.\r\nYou certainly can afford to await the result.  The Executive power\r\nis not weakened, but rather strengthened.  Surely he is not such an\r\nobstruction as would warrant violence, or even s show of force,\r\nwhich would produce the very reaction and clamor that he hopes for\r\nto save him from the absurdity of holding an empty office \"for the\r\nsafety of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThis is so much as I ought to say, and more too, but if it produces\r\nthe result I will be more than satisfied, viz., that I be simply\r\nallowed to resume my proper post and duties in St. Louis.  With\r\ngreat respect, yours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February, the board of which I was the president\r\nsubmitted to the adjutant-general our draft of the \"Articles of War\r\nand Army Regulations,\" condensed to a small compass, the result of\r\nour war experience.  But they did not suit the powers that were,\r\nand have ever since slept the sleep that knows no waking, to make\r\nroom for the ponderous document now in vogue, which will not stand\r\nthe strain of a week's campaign in real war.\r\n\r\nI hurried back to St. Louis to escape the political storm I saw\r\nbrewing.  The President repeatedly said to me that he wanted me in\r\nWashington, and I as often answered that nothing could tempt me to\r\nlive in that center of intrigue and excitement; but soon came the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\nWASHINGTON, February 10, 1868.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: I have received at last the President's reply to my\r\nlast, letter.  He attempts to substantiate his statements by his\r\nCabinet.  In this view it is important that I should have a letter\r\nfrom you, if you are willing to give it, of what I said to you\r\nabout the effect of the \"Tenure-of-Office Bill,\" and my object in\r\ngoing to see the President on Saturday before the installment of\r\nMr. Stanton.  What occurred after the meeting of the Cabinet on the\r\nTuesday following is not a subject under controversy now;\r\ntherefore, if you choose to write down your recollection (and I\r\nwould like to have it) on Wednesday, when you and I called on the\r\nPresident, and your conversation with him the last time you saw\r\nhim, make that a separate communication.\r\n\r\nYour order to come East was received several days ago, but the\r\nPresident withdrew it, I supposed to make some alteration, but it\r\nhas not been returned.\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[TELEGRAM.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., February 18, 1868.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General W. T.

I was in hopes I had escaped the danger, and now were I\r\nprepared I should resign on the spot, as it requires no foresight\r\nto predict such must be the inevitable result in the end.

C., February 12, 1868.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: You will please issue an order creating a military\r\ndivision to be styled the Military Division of the Atlantic, to be\r\ncomposed of the Department of the Lakes, the Department of the\r\nEast, and the Department of Washington, to be commanded by\r\nLieutenant-General W. T. Sherman, with his headquarters at\r\nWashington.  Until further orders from the President, you will\r\nassign no officer to the permanent command of the Military Division\r\nof the Missouri.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL U. S. GRANT,\r\nCommanding Armies of The United States, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nMajor-General P. H. Sheridan, the senior officer in the Military\r\nDivision of the Missouri, will temporarily perform the duties of\r\ncommander of the Military Division of the Missouri in addition to\r\nhis duties of department commander.  By command of General Grant:\r\n\r\nE. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis order, if carried into effect, would have grouped in\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n1.  The President, constitutional Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n2.  The Secretary of War, congressional Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n3.  The General of the Armies of the United States.\r\n\r\n4.  The Lieutenant-General of the Army.\r\n\r\n5.  The Commanding General of the Department of Washington.\r\n\r\n6.  The commander of the post-of Washington.\r\n\r\nAt that date the garrison of Washington was a brigade of infantry\r\nand a battery of artillery.  I never doubted Mr. Johnson's\r\nsincerity in wishing to befriend me, but this was the broadest kind\r\nof a farce, or meant mischief.  I therefore appealed to him by\r\nletter to allow me to remain where I was, and where I could do\r\nservice, real service, and received his most satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,\r\nSt. Louis, MISSOURI, February 14, 1868.\r\n\r\nGeneral U.

C.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: Last evening, just before leaving my office, I\r\nreceived your note of the 10th, and had intended answering it\r\naccording to your request; but, after I got home, I got your\r\ndispatch of yesterday, announcing that the order I dreaded so much\r\nwas issued.  I never felt so troubled in my life.  Were it an order\r\nto go to Sitka, to the devil, to battle with rebels or Indians, I\r\nthink you would not hear a whimper from me, but it comes in such a\r\nquestionable form that, like Hamlet's ghost, it curdles my blood\r\nand mars my judgment.  My first thoughts were of resignation, and I\r\nhad almost made up my mind to ask Dodge for some place on the\r\nPacific road, or on one of the Iowa roads, and then again various\r\ncolleges ran through my memory, but hard times and an expensive\r\nfamily have brought me back to staring the proposition square in\r\nthe face, and I have just written a letter to the President, which\r\nI herewith transmit through you, on which I will hang a hope of\r\nrespite till you telegraph me its effect.  The uncertainties ahead\r\nare too great to warrant my incurring the expense of breaking up my\r\nhouse and family here, and therefore in no event will I do this\r\ntill I can be assured of some permanence elsewhere.  If it were at\r\nall certain that you would accept the nomination of President in\r\nMay, I would try and kill the intervening time, and then judge of\r\nthe chances, but I do not want you to reveal your plans to me till\r\nyou choose to do so.\r\n\r\nI have telegraphed to John Sherman to oppose the nomination which\r\nthe papers announce has been made of me for brevet general.\r\n\r\nI have this minute received your cipher dispatch of to-day, which I\r\nhave just answered and sent down to the telegraph-office, and the\r\nclerk is just engaged in copying my letter to the President to go\r\nwith this.  If the President or his friends pretend that I seek to\r\ngo to Washington, it will be fully rebutted by letters I have\r\nwritten to the President, to you, to John Sherman, to Mr. Ewing,\r\nand to Mr. Stanbery.  You remember that in our last talk you\r\nsuggested I should write again to the President.  I thought of it,\r\nand concluded my letter of January 31st, already delivered, was\r\nfull and emphatic.  Still, I did write again to Mr. Stanbery,\r\nasking him as a friend to interpose in my behalf.  There are plenty\r\nof people who know my wishes, and I would avoid, if possible, the\r\npublication of a letter so confidential as that of January 31st, in\r\nwhich I notice I allude to the President's purpose of removing Mr.\r\nStanton by force, a fact that ought not to be drawn out through me\r\nif it be possible to avoid it.  In the letter herewith I confine\r\nmyself to purely private matters, and will not object if it reaches\r\nthe public in any proper way.  My opinion is, the President thinks\r\nMrs. Sherman would like to come to Washington by reason of her\r\nfather and brothers being there.  This is true, for Mrs. Sherman\r\nhas an idea that St. Louis is unhealthy for our children, and\r\nbecause most of the Catholics here are tainted with the old secesh\r\nfeeling.  But I know better what is to our common interest, and\r\nprefer to judge of the proprieties myself.  What I do object to is\r\nthe false position I would occupy as between you and the President.\r\nWere there an actual army at or near Washington, I could be\r\nwithdrawn from the most unpleasant attitude of a \"go-between,\" but\r\nthere is no army there, nor any military duties which you with a\r\nhost of subordinates can not perform.  Therefore I would be there\r\nwith naked, informal, and sinecure duties, and utterly out of\r\nplace.  This you understand well enough, and the army too, but the\r\nPresident and the politicians, who flatter themselves they are\r\nsaving the country, cannot and will not understand.  My opinion is,\r\nthe country is doctored to death, and if President and Congress\r\nwould go to sleep like Rip Van Winkle, the country would go on\r\nunder natural influences, and recover far faster than under their\r\njoint and several treatment.  This doctrine would be accounted by\r\nCongress, and by the President too, as high treason, and therefore\r\nI don't care about saying so to either of them, but I know you can\r\nhear anything, and give it just what thought or action it merits.\r\n\r\nExcuse this long letter, and telegraph me the result of my letter\r\nto the President as early as you can.  If he holds my letter so\r\nlong as to make it improper for me to await his answer, also\r\ntelegraph me.\r\n\r\nThe order, when received, will, I suppose, direct me as to whom and\r\nhow I am to turn over this command, which should, in my judgment,\r\nnot be broken up, as the three departments composing the division\r\nshould be under one head.\r\n\r\nI expect my staff-officers to be making for me within the hour to\r\nlearn their fate, so advise me all you can as quick as possible.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, yours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the President.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: It is hard for me to conceive you would purposely do me\r\nan unkindness unless under the pressure of a sense of public duty,\r\nor because you do not believe me sincere.  I was in hopes, since my\r\nletter to you of the 31st of January, that you had concluded to\r\npass over that purpose of yours expressed more than once in\r\nconversation--to organize a new command for me in the East, with\r\nheadquarters in Washington; but a telegram from General Grant of\r\nyesterday says that \"the order was issued ordering you\" (me) \"to\r\nAtlantic Division\"; and the newspapers of this morning contain the\r\nsame information, with the addition that I have been nominated as\r\nbrevet general.  I have telegraphed my own brother in the Senate to\r\noppose my confirmation, on the ground that the two higher grades in\r\nthe army ought not to be complicated with brevets, and I trust you\r\nwill conceive my motives aright.  If I could see my way clear to\r\nmaintain my family, I should not hesitate a moment to resign my\r\npresent commission, and seek some business wherein I would be free\r\nfrom these unhappy complications that seem to be closing about me,\r\nspite of my earnest efforts to avoid them; but necessity ties my\r\nhands, and I must submit with the best grace I can till I make\r\nother arrangements.\r\n\r\nIn Washington are already the headquarters of a department, and of\r\nthe army itself, and it is hard for me to see wherein I can render\r\nmilitary service there.  Any staff-officer with the rank of major\r\ncould surely fill any gap left between these two military officers;\r\nand, by being placed in Washington, I will be universally construed\r\nas a rival to the General-in-Chief, a position damaging to me in\r\nthe highest degree.  Our relations have always been most\r\nconfidential and friendly, and if, unhappily, any cloud of\r\ndifferences should arise between us, my sense of personal dignity\r\nand duty would leave me no alternative but resignation.  For this I\r\nam not yet prepared, but I shall proceed to arrange for it as\r\nrapidly as possible, so that when the time does come (as it surely\r\nwill if this plan is carried into effect) I may act promptly.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the order is now issued, I cannot expect a full\r\nrevocation of it, but I beg the privilege of taking post at New\r\nYork, or any point you may name within the new military division\r\nother than Washington.  This privilege is generally granted to all\r\nmilitary commanders, and I see no good reason why I too may not ask\r\nfor it, and this simple concession, involving no public interest,\r\nwill much soften the blow, which, right or wrong, I construe as one\r\nof the hardest I have sustained in a life somewhat checkered with\r\nadversity.  With great respects yours truly,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., 2 p.m., February 19, 1888.\r\nLieutenant-General W. T. SHERMAN, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nI have just received, with General Grant's indorsement of\r\nreference, your letter to me of the fourteenth (14th) inst.\r\n\r\nThe order to which you refer was made in good faith, and with a\r\nview to the best interests of the country and the service; as,\r\nhowever, your assignment to a new military division seems so\r\nobjectionable, you will retain your present command.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that same 19th of February he appointed Adjutant, General\r\nLorenzo Thomas to be Secretary of War ad interim, which finally\r\nresulted in the articles of impeachment and trial of President\r\nJohnson before the Senate.  I was a witness on that trial, but of\r\ncourse the lawyers would not allow me to express any opinion of the\r\nPresident's motives or intentions, and restricted me to the facts\r\nset forth in the articles of impeachment, of which I was glad to\r\nknow nothing.  The final test vote revealed less than two thirds,\r\nand the President was consequently acquitted.  Mr. Stanton\r\nresigned.  General Schofield, previously nominated, was confirmed\r\nas Secretary of War, thus putting an end to what ought never to\r\nhave happened at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN PEACE COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July, 1867, President Johnson approved an act to\r\nestablish peace with certain hostile Indian tribes, the first\r\nsection of which reads as follows: \"Be it enacted, etc., that the\r\nPresident of the United States be and is hereby authorized to\r\nappoint a commission to consist of three (3) officers of the army\r\nnot below the rank of brigadier-general, who, together with N. G.\r\nTaylor, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John B.  Henderson,\r\nchairman of the Committee of Indian Affairs of the Senate, S. F.\r\nTappan, and John B.  Sanborn, shall have power and authority to\r\ncall together the chiefs and head men of such bands or tribes of\r\nIndians as are now waging war against the United States, or\r\ncommitting depredations on the people thereof, to ascertain the\r\nalleged reasons for their acts of hostility, and in their\r\ndiscretion, under the direction of the President, to make and\r\nconclude with said bands or tribes such treaty stipulations,\r\nsubject to the action of the Senate, as may remove all just causes\r\nof complaint on their part, and at the same time establish security\r\nfor person and property along the lines of railroad now being\r\nconstructed to the Pacific and other thoroughfares of travel to the\r\nWestern Territories, and such as will most likely insure\r\ncivilization for the Indians, and peace and safety for the whites.\"\r\n\r\nThe President named as the military members Lieutenant-General\r\nSherman, Brigadier-Generals A. H. Terry and W. S. Harney.\r\nSubsequently, to insure a full attendance, Brigadier-General C. C.\r\nAugur was added to the commission, and his name will be found on\r\nmost of the treaties.  The commissioners met at St. Louis and\r\nelected N. G. Taylor, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\r\npresident; J. B. Sanborn, treasurer; and A. S. H. White, Esq., of\r\nWashington, D. C., secretary.  The year 1867 was too far advanced\r\nto complete the task assigned during that season, and it was agreed\r\nthat a steamboat (St. John's) should be chartered to convey the\r\ncommission up the Missouri River, and we adjourned to meet at\r\nOmaha.  In the St. John's the commission proceeded up the Missouri\r\nRiver, holding informal \"talks\" with the Santees at their agency\r\nnear the Niobrara, the Yanktonnais at Fort Thompson, and the\r\nOgallallas, Minneconjous, Sans Arcs, etc., at Fort Sully.  From\r\nthis point runners were sent out to the Sioux occupying the country\r\nwest of the Missouri River, to meet us in council at the Forks of\r\nthe Platte that fall, and to Sitting Bull's band of outlaw Sioux,\r\nand the Crows on the upper Yellowstone, to meet us in May, 1868, at\r\nFort Laramie.  We proceeded up the river to the mouth of the\r\nCheyenne and turned back to Omaha, having ample time on this\r\nsteamboat to discuss and deliberate on the problems submitted to\r\nour charge.\r\n\r\nWe all agreed that the nomad Indians should be removed from the\r\nvicinity of the two great railroads then in rapid construction, and\r\nbe localized on one or other of the two great reservations south of\r\nKansas and north of Nebraska; that agreements not treaties, should\r\nbe made for their liberal maintenance as to food, clothing,\r\nschools, and farming implements for ten years, during which time we\r\nbelieved that these Indians should become self-supporting.  To the\r\nnorth we proposed to remove the various bands of Sioux, with such\r\nothers as could be induced to locate near them; and to the south,\r\non the Indian Territory already established, we proposed to remove\r\nthe Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Kiowas, Comanches, and such others as we\r\ncould prevail on to move thither.\r\n\r\nAt that date the Union Pacific construction had reached the Rocky\r\nMountains at Cheyenne, and the Kansas Pacific to about Fort\r\nWallace.  We held council with the Ogallallas at the Forks of the\r\nPlatte, and arranged to meet them all the next spring, 1868.  In\r\nthe spring of 1868 we met the Crows in council at Fort Laramie, the\r\nSioux at the North Platte, the Shoshones or Snakes at Fort Hall,\r\nthe Navajos at Fort Sumner, on the Pecos, and the Cheyennes and\r\nArapahoes at Medicine Lodge.  To accomplish these results the\r\ncommission divided up into committees, General Augur going to the\r\nShoshones, Mr. Tappan and I to the Navajos, and the remainder to\r\nMedicine Lodge.  In that year we made treaties or arrangements with\r\nall the tribes which before had followed the buffalo in their\r\nannual migrations, and which brought them into constant conflict\r\nwith the whites.\r\n\r\nMr. Tappan and I found it impossible to prevail on the Navajos to\r\nremove to the Indian Territory, and had to consent to their return\r\nto their former home, restricted to a limited reservation west of\r\nSanta Fe, about old Fort Defiance, and there they continue unto\r\nthis day, rich in the possession of herds of sheep and goats, with\r\nsome cattle and horses; and they have remained at peace ever since.\r\n\r\nA part of our general plan was to organize the two great\r\nreservations into regular Territorial governments, with Governor,\r\nCouncil, courts, and civil officers.  General Harney was\r\ntemporarily assigned to that of the Sioux at the north, and General\r\nHazen to that of the Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, etc.,\r\netc., at the south, but the patronage of the Indian Bureau was too\r\nstrong for us, and that part of our labor failed.  Still, the\r\nIndian Peace Commission of 1867-'68 did prepare the way for the\r\ngreat Pacific Railroads, which, for better or worse, have settled\r\nthe fate of the buffalo and Indian forever.  There have been wars\r\nand conflicts since with these Indians up to a recent period too\r\nnumerous and complicated in their detail for me to unravel and\r\nrecord, but they have been the dying struggles of a singular race\r\nof brave men fighting against destiny, each less and less violent,\r\ntill now the wild game is gone, the whites too numerous and\r\npowerful; so that the Indian question has become one of sentiment\r\nand charity, but not of war.\r\n\r\nThe peace, or \"Quaker\" policy, of which so much has been said,\r\noriginated about thus: By the act of Congress, approved March\r\n3,1869, the forty-five regiments of infantry were reduced to\r\ntwenty-five, and provision was made for the \"muster out\" of many of\r\nthe surplus officers, and for retaining others to be absorbed by\r\nthe usual promotions and casualties.  On the 7th of May of that\r\nyear, by authority of an act of Congress approved June 30, 1834,\r\nnine field-officers and fifty-nine captains and subalterns were\r\ndetached and ordered to report to the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, to serve as Indian superintendents and agents.  Thus by an\r\nold law surplus army officers were made to displace the usual civil\r\nappointees, undoubtedly a change for the better, but most\r\ndistasteful to members of Congress, who looked to these\r\nappointments as part of their proper patronage.  The consequence\r\nwas the law of July 15, 1870, which vacated the military commission\r\nof any officer who accepted or exercised the functions of a civil\r\nofficer.  I was then told that certain politicians called on\r\nPresident Grant, informing him that this law was chiefly designed\r\nto prevent his using army officers for Indian agents, \"civil\r\noffices,\" which he believed to be both judicious and wise; army\r\nofficers, as a rule, being better qualified to deal with Indians\r\nthan the average political appointees.  The President then quietly\r\nreplied: \"Gentlemen, you have defeated my plan of Indian\r\nmanagement; but you shall not succeed in your purpose, for I will\r\ndivide these appointments up among the religious churches, with\r\nwhich you dare not contend.\"  The army officers were consequently\r\nrelieved of their \"civil offices,\" and the Indian agencies were\r\napportioned to the several religious churches in about the\r\nproportion of their--supposed strength--some to the Quakers, some\r\nto the Methodists, to the Catholics, Episcopalians, Presbyterians,\r\netc., etc.--and thus it remains to the present time, these\r\nreligious communities selecting the agents to be appointed by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior.  The Quakers, being first named, gave\r\nname to the policy, and it is called the \"Quaker\" policy to-day.\r\nMeantime railroads and settlements by hardy, bold pioneers have\r\nmade the character of Indian agents of small concern, and it\r\nmatters little who are the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nAs was clearly foreseen, General U. S. Grant was duly nominated,\r\nand on the 7th of November, 1868, was elected President of the\r\nUnited States for the four years beginning with March 4, 1869.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th and 16th of December, 1868, the four societies of the\r\nArmies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, Ohio, and Georgia, held a\r\njoint reunion at Chicago, at which were present over two thousand\r\nof the surviving officers and soldiers of the war.  The ceremonies\r\nconsisted of the joint meeting in Crosby's magnificent opera-house,\r\nat which General George H. Thomas presided.  General W. W. Belknap\r\nwas the orator for the Army of the Tennessee, General Charles Cruft\r\nfor the Army of the Cumberland, General J. D. Cox for the Army of\r\nthe Ohio, and General William Cogswell for the Army of Georgia.\r\nThe banquet was held in the vast Chamber of Commerce, at which I\r\npresided.  General Grant, President-elect, General J. M. Schofield,\r\nSecretary of War, General H. W. Slocum, and nearly every general\r\nofficer of note was present except General Sheridan, who at the\r\nmoment was fighting the Cheyennes in Southern Kansas and the Indian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt that time we discussed the army changes which would necessarily\r\noccur in the following March, and it was generally understood that\r\nI was to succeed General Grant as general-in-chief, but as to my\r\nsuccessor, Meade, Thomas, and Sheridan were candidates.  And here I\r\nwill remark that General Grant, afterward famous as the \"silent\r\nman,\" used to be very gossipy, and no one was ever more fond than\r\nhe of telling anecdotes of our West Point and early army life.  At\r\nthe Chicago reunion he told me that I would have to come to\r\nWashington, that he wanted me to effect a change as to the general\r\nstaff, which he had long contemplated, and which was outlined in\r\nhis letter to Mr. Stanton of January 29,1866, given hereafter,\r\nwhich had been repeatedly published, and was well known to the\r\nmilitary world; that on being inaugurated President on the 4th of\r\nMarch he would retain General Schofield as his Secretary of War\r\nuntil the change had become habitual; that the modern custom of the\r\nSecretary of War giving military orders to the adjutant-general and\r\nother staff officers was positively wrong and should be stopped.\r\nSpeaking of General Grant's personal characteristics at that period\r\nof his life, I recall a conversation in his carriage, when, riding\r\ndown Pennsylvania Avenue, he, inquired of me in a humorous way,\r\n\"Sherman, what special hobby do you intend to adopt?\"  I inquired\r\nwhat he meant, and he explained that all men had their special\r\nweakness or vanity, and that it was wiser to choose one's own than\r\nto leave the newspapers to affix one less acceptable, and that for\r\nhis part he had chosen the \"horse,\" so that when anyone tried to\r\npump him he would turn the conversation to his \"horse.\"  I answered\r\nthat I would stick to the \"theatre and balls,\" for I was always\r\nfond of seeing young people happy, and did actually acquire a\r\nreputation for \"dancing,\" though I had not attempted the waltz, or\r\nanything more than the ordinary cotillon, since the war.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1869, I was summoned to Washington,\r\narriving on the 26th, taking along my aides, Lieutenant-Colonels\r\nDayton and Audenried.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March General Grant was duly inaugurated President of\r\nthe United States, and I was nominated and confirmed as General of\r\nthe Army.\r\n\r\nMajor-General P. H. Sheridan was at the same time nominated and\r\nconfirmed as lieutenant-general, with orders to command the\r\nMilitary Division of the Missouri, which he did, moving the\r\nheadquarters from St. Louis to Chicago; and General Meade was\r\nassigned to command the Military Division of the Atlantic, with\r\nheadquarters at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAt that moment General Meade was in Atlanta, Georgia, commanding\r\nthe Third Military District under the \"Reconstruction Act;\" and\r\nGeneral Thomas, whose post was in Nashville, was in Washington on a\r\ncourt of inquiry investigating certain allegations against General\r\nA. B. Dyer, Chief of Ordnance.  He occupied the room of the second\r\nfloor in the building on the corner of H and Fifteenth Streets,\r\nsince become Wormley's Hotel.  I at the time was staying with my\r\nbrother, Senator Sherman, at his residence, 1321 K Street, and it\r\nwas my habit each morning to stop at Thomas's room on my way to the\r\noffice in the War Department to tell him the military news, and to\r\ntalk over matters of common interest.  We had been intimately\r\nassociated as \"man and boy\" for thirty-odd years, and I profess to\r\nhave had better opportunities to know him than any man then living.\r\nHis fame as the \"Rock of Chickamauga\" was perfect, and by the world\r\nat large he was considered as the embodiment of strength, calmness,\r\nand imperturbability.  Yet of all my acquaintances Thomas worried\r\nand fretted over what he construed neglects or acts of favoritism\r\nmore than any other.\r\n\r\nAt that time he was much worried by what he supposed was injustice\r\nin the promotion of General Sheridan, and still more that General\r\nMeade should have an Eastern station, which compelled him to remain\r\nat Nashville or go to the Pacific.  General Thomas claimed that all\r\nhis life he had been stationed in the South or remote West, and had\r\nnot had a fair share of Eastern posts, whereas that General Meade\r\nhad always been there.  I tried to get him to go with me to see\r\nPresident Grant and talk the matter over frankly, but he would not,\r\nand I had to act as a friendly mediator.  General Grant assured me\r\nat the time that he not only admired and respected General Thomas,\r\nbut actually loved him as a man, and he authorized me in making up\r\ncommands for the general officers to do anything and everything to\r\nfavor him, only he could not recede from his former action in\r\nrespect to Generals Sheridan and Meade.\r\n\r\nPrior to General Grant's inauguration the army register showed as\r\nmajor-generals Halleck, Meade, Sheridan, Thomas, and Hancock.\r\nTherefore, the promotion of General Sheridan to be lieutenant-\r\ngeneral did not \"overslaugh\" Thomas, but it did Meade and Halleck.\r\nThe latter did not expect promotion; General Meade did, but was\r\npartially, not wholly, reconciled by being stationed at\r\nPhiladelphia, the home of his family; and President Grant assured\r\nme that he knew of his own knowledge that General Sheridan had been\r\nnominated major-general before General Meade, but had waived dates\r\nout of respect for his age and longer service, and that he had\r\nnominated him as lieutenant-general by reason of his special\r\nfitness to command the Military Division of the Missouri, embracing\r\nall the wild Indians, at that very moment in a state of hostility.\r\nI gave General Thomas the choice of every other command in the\r\narmy, and of his own choice he went to San Francisco, California,\r\nwhere he died, March 28, 1870.  The truth is, Congress should have\r\nprovided by law for three lieutenant-generals for these three\r\npre-eminent soldiers, and should have dated their commissions with\r\n\"Gettysburg,\" \"Winchester,\" and \"Nashville.\"  It would have been a\r\ngraceful act, and might have prolonged the lives of two most\r\npopular officers, who died soon after, feeling that they had\r\nexperienced ingratitude and neglect.\r\n\r\nSoon after General Grant's inauguration as President, and, as I\r\nsupposed, in fulfilment of his plan divulged in Chicago the\r\nprevious December, were made the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\nWASHINGTON, March 8, 1869.\r\n\r\nGeneral Orders No. 11:\r\n\r\nThe following orders of the President of the United States are\r\npublished for the information and government of all concerned:\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, March 5, 1869.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the President, General William T. Sherman will\r\nassume command of the Army of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of staff corps, departments, and bureaus will report to\r\nand act under the immediate orders of the general commanding the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nAny official business which by law or regulation requires the\r\naction of the President or Secretary of War will be submitted by\r\nthe General of the Army to the Secretary of War, and in general all\r\norders from the President or Secretary of War to any portion of the\r\narmy, line or staff, will be transmitted through the General of the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nJ. M. SCHOFIELD, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nBy command of the General of the Army.\r\n\r\nE.  D.  TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day I issued my General Orders No. 12, assuming command\r\nand naming all the heads of staff departments and bureaus as\r\nmembers of my staff, adding to my then three aides, Colonels McCoy,\r\nDayton, and Audenried, the names of Colonels Comstock, Horace\r\nPorter, and Dent, agreeing with President Grant that the two latter\r\ncould remain with him till I should need their personal services or\r\nask their resignations.\r\n\r\nI was soon made aware that the heads of several of the staff corps\r\nwere restive under this new order of things, for by long usage they\r\nhad grown to believe themselves not officers of the army in a\r\ntechnical sense, but a part of the War Department, the civil branch\r\nof the Government which connects the army with the President and\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn a short time General John A. Rawlins, General Grant's former\r\nchief of staff, was nominated and confirmed as Secretary of War;\r\nand soon appeared this order:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\nWASHINGTON, March 27, 1869.\r\n\r\nGeneral Orders No.  28:\r\n\r\nThe following orders received for the War Department are published\r\nfor the government of all concerned:\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, March 26, 1869.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the President, the order of the Secretary of War,\r\ndated War Department, March 5, 1869, and published in General\r\nOrders No. 11, headquarters of the army, Adjutant-General's Office,\r\ndated March 8, 1869, except so much as directs General W. T.\r\nSherman to assume command of the Army of the United States, is\r\nhereby rescinded.\r\n\r\nAll official business which by law or regulations requires the\r\naction of the President or Secretary of War will be submitted by\r\nthe chiefs of staff corps, departments, and bureaus to the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nAll orders and instructions relating to military operations issued\r\nby the President or Secretary of War will be issued through the\r\nGeneral of the Army.\r\n\r\nJOHN A.  RAWLINS, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nBy command of General SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nE.  D.  TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we were thrown back on the old method in having a double--if\r\nnot a treble-headed machine.  Each head of a bureau in daily\r\nconsultation with the Secretary of War, and the general to command\r\nwithout an adjutant, quartermaster, commissary, or any staff except\r\nhis own aides, often reading in the newspapers of military events\r\nand orders before he could be consulted or informed.  This was the\r\nvery reverse of what General Grant, after four years' experience in\r\nWashington as general-in-chief, seemed to want, different from what\r\nhe had explained to me in Chicago, and totally different from the\r\ndemand he had made on Secretary of War Stanton in his complete\r\nletter of January 29, 1866.  I went to him to know the cause: He\r\nsaid he had been informed by members of Congress that his action,\r\nas defined by his order of March 5th, was regarded as a violation\r\nof laws making provision for the bureaus of the War Department;\r\nthat he had repealed his own orders, but not mine, and that he had\r\nno doubt that General Rawlins and I could draw the line of\r\nseparation satisfactorily to us both.  General Rawlins was very\r\nconscientious, but a very sick man when appointed Secretary of War.\r\nSeveral times he made orders through the adjutant-general to\r\nindividuals of the army without notifying me, but always when his\r\nattention was called to it he apologized, and repeatedly said to me\r\nthat he understood from his experience on General Grant's staff how\r\nalmost insulting it was for orders to go to individuals of a\r\nregiment, brigade, division, or an army of any kind without the\r\ncommanding officer being consulted or even advised.  This habit is\r\nmore common at Washington than any place on earth, unless it be in\r\nLondon, where nearly the same condition of facts exists.  Members\r\nof Congress daily appeal to the Secretary of War for the discharge\r\nof some soldier on the application of a mother, or some young\r\nofficer has to be dry-nursed, withdrawn from his company on the\r\nplains to be stationed near home.  The Secretary of War, sometimes\r\nmoved by private reasons, or more likely to oblige the member of\r\nCongress, grants the order, of which the commanding general knows\r\nnothing till he reads it in the newspapers.  Also, an Indian tribe,\r\ngoaded by the pressure of white neighbors, breaks out in revolt.\r\nThe general-in-chief must reenforce the local garrisons not only\r\nwith men, but horses, wagons, ammunition, and food.  All the\r\nnecessary information is in the staff bureaus in Washington, but\r\nthe general has no right to call for it, and generally finds it\r\nmore practicable to ask by telegraph of the distant division or\r\ndepartment commanders for the information before making the formal\r\norders.  The general in actual command of the army should have a\r\nfull staff, subject to his own command.  If not, he cannot be held\r\nresponsible for results.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rawlins sank away visibly, rapidly, and died in Washington,\r\nSeptember 6,1869, and I was appointed to perform the duties of his\r\noffice till a successor could be selected.  I realized how much\r\neasier and better it was to have both offices conjoined.\r\n\r\nThe army then had one constitutional commander-in-chief of both\r\narmy and navy, and one actual commanding general, bringing all\r\nparts into real harmony.  An army to be useful must be a unit, and\r\nout of this has grown the saying, attributed to Napoleon, but\r\ndoubtless spoken before the days of Alexander, that an army with an\r\ninefficient commander was better than one with two able heads.  Our\r\npolitical system and methods, however, demanded a separate\r\nSecretary of War, and in October President Grant asked me to scan\r\nthe list of the volunteer generals of good record who had served in\r\nthe civil war, preferably from the \"West.\"  I did so, and submitted\r\nto him in writing the names of W. W. Belknap, of Iowa; G.  M.\r\nDodge, the Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad; and Lucius\r\nFairchild, of Madison, Wisconsin.  I also named General John W.\r\nSprague, then employed by the Northern Pacific Railroad in\r\nWashington Territory.  General Grant knew them all personally, and\r\nsaid if General Dodge were not connected with the Union Pacific\r\nRailroad, with which the Secretary of War must necessarily have\r\nlarge transactions, he would choose him, but as the case stood, and\r\nremembering the very excellent speech made by General Belknap at\r\nthe Chicago reunion of December, 1868, he authorized me to\r\ncommunicate with him to ascertain if he were willing to come to\r\nWashington as Secretary of War.  General Belknap was then the\r\ncollector of internal revenue at Keokuk, Iowa.  I telegraphed him\r\nand received a prompt and favorable answer.  His name was sent to\r\nthe Senate, promptly confirmed, and he entered on his duties\r\nOctober 25,1869.  General Belknap surely had at that date as fair a\r\nfame as any officer of volunteers of my personal acquaintance.  He\r\ntook up the business where it was left off, and gradually fell into\r\nthe current which led to the command of the army itself as of the\r\nlegal and financial matters which properly pertain to the War\r\nDepartment.  Orders granting leaves of absence to officers,\r\ntransfers, discharges of soldiers for favor, and all the old\r\nabuses, which had embittered the life of General Scott in the days\r\nof Secretaries of War Marcy and Davis, were renewed.  I called his\r\nattention to these facts, but without sensible effect.  My office\r\nwas under his in the old War Department, and one day I sent my\r\naide-de-camp, Colonel Audenried, up to him with some message, and\r\nwhen he returned red as a beet, very much agitated, he asked me as\r\na personal favor never again to send him to General Belknap.  I\r\ninquired his reason, and he explained that he had been treated with\r\na rudeness and discourtesy he had never seen displayed by any\r\nofficer to a soldier.  Colonel Audenried was one of the most\r\npolished gentlemen in the army, noted for his personal bearing and\r\ndeportment, and I had some trouble to impress on him the patience\r\nnecessary for the occasion, but I promised on future occasions to\r\nsend some other or go myself.  Things went on from bad to worse,\r\ntill in 1870 I received from Mr. Hugh Campbell, of St. Louis, a\r\npersonal friend and an honorable gentleman, a telegraphic message\r\ncomplaining that I had removed from his position Mr. Ward, post\r\ntrader at Fort Laramie, with only a month in which to dispose of\r\nhis large stock of goods, to make room for his successor.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that we of the Indian Peace Commission had been much\r\nindebted to this same trader, Ward, for advances of flour, sugar,\r\nand coffee, to provide for the Crow Indians, who had come down from\r\ntheir reservation on the Yellowstone to meet us in 1868, before our\r\nown supplies had been received.  For a time I could not-comprehend\r\nthe nature of Mr. Campbell's complaint, so I telegraphed to the\r\ndepartment commander, General C. C. Augur, at Omaha, to know if any\r\nsuch occurrence had happened, and the reasons therefor.  I received\r\na prompt answer that it was substantially true, and had been\r\nordered by The Secretary of War.  It so happened that during\r\nGeneral Grant's command of the army Congress had given to the\r\ngeneral of the army the appointment of \"post-traders.\"  He had\r\nnaturally devolved it on the subordinate division and department\r\ncommanders, but the legal power remained with the general of the\r\narmy.  I went up to the Secretary of War, showed him the\r\ntelegraphic correspondence, and pointed out the existing law in the\r\nRevised Statutes.  General Belknap was visibly taken aback, and\r\nexplained that he had supposed the right of appointment rested with\r\nhim, that Ward was an old rebel Democrat, etc.; whereas Ward had\r\nbeen in fact the sutler of Fort Laramie, a United States military\r\npost, throughout the civil war.  I told him that I should revoke\r\nhis orders, and leave the matter where it belonged, to the local\r\ncouncil of administration and commanding officers.  Ward was\r\nunanimously reelected and reinstated.  He remained the trader of\r\nthe post until Congress repealed the law, and gave back the power\r\nof appointment to the Secretary of War, when of course he had to\r\ngo.  But meantime he was able to make the necessary business\r\narrangements which saved him and his partners the sacrifice which\r\nwould have been necessary in the first instance.  I never had any\r\nknowledge whatever of General Belknap's transactions with the\r\ntraders at Fort Sill and Fort Lincoln which resulted in his\r\ndownfall.  I have never sought to ascertain his motives for\r\nbreaking with me, because he knew I had always befriended him while\r\nunder my military command, and in securing him his office of\r\nSecretary of War.  I spoke frequently to President Grant of the\r\ngrowing tendency of his Secretary of War to usurp all the powers of\r\nthe commanding general, which would surely result in driving me\r\naway.  He as frequently promised to bring us together to agree upon\r\na just line of separation of our respective offices, but never did.\r\n\r\nDetermined to bring the matter to an issue, I wrote the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE  UNITED STATES,\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 17, 1870.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. W. BELKNAP, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I must urgently and respectfully invite your attention\r\nwhen at leisure to a matter of deep interest to future commanding\r\ngenerals of the army more than to myself, of the imperative\r\nnecessity of fixing and clearly defining the limits of the powers\r\nand duties of the general of the army or of whomsoever may succeed\r\nto the place of commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nThe case is well stated by General Grant in his letter of January\r\n29, 1866, to the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, hereto appended,\r\nand though I find no official answer recorded, I remember that\r\nGeneral Grant told me that the Secretary of War had promptly\r\nassured him in conversation that he fully approved of his views as\r\nexpressed in this letter.\r\n\r\nAt that time the subject was much discussed, and soon after\r\nCongress enacted the bill reviving the grade of general, which bill\r\nwas approved July 25, 1866, and provided that the general, when\r\ncommissioned, may be authorized under the direction and during the\r\npleasure of the President to command the armies of the United\r\nStates; and a few days after, viz., July 28, 1866, was enacted the\r\nlaw which defined the military peace establishment.  The enacting\r\nclause reads: \"That the military peace establishment of the United\r\nStates shall hereafter consist of five regiments of artillery, ten\r\nregiments of cavalry, forty-five regiments of infantry, the\r\nprofessors and Corps of Cadets of the United States Military\r\nAcademy, and such other forces as shall be provided for by this\r\nact, to be known as the army of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe act then recites in great detail all the parts of the army,\r\nmaking no distinction between the line and staff, but clearly makes\r\neach and every part an element of the whole.\r\n\r\nSection 37 provides for a board to revise the army regulations and\r\nreport; and declares that the regulations then in force, viz.,\r\nthose of 1863, should remain until Congress \"shall act on said\r\nreport;\" and section 38 and last enacts that all laws and parts of\r\nlaws inconsistent with the provisions of this act be and the same\r\nare hereby repealed.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of this law my predecessor, General Grant, did\r\nnot hesitate to command and make orders to all parts of the army,\r\nthe Military Academy, and staff, and it was under his advice that\r\nthe new regulations were compiled in 1868 that drew the line more\r\nclearly between the high and responsible duties of the Secretary of\r\nWar and the general of the army.  He assured me many a time before\r\nI was called here to succeed him that he wanted me to perfect the\r\ndistinction, and it was by his express orders that on assuming the\r\ncommand of the army I specifically placed the heads of the staff\r\ncorps here in Washington in the exact relation to the army which\r\nthey would bear to an army in the field.\r\n\r\nI am aware that subsequently, in his orders of March 26th, he\r\nmodified his former orders of March 5th, but only as to the heads\r\nof bureaus in Washington, who have, he told me, certain functions\r\nof office imposed on them by special laws of Congress, which laws,\r\nof course, override all orders and regulations, but I did not\r\neither understand from him in person, or from General Rawlins, at\r\nwhose instance this order was made, that it was designed in any way\r\nto modify, alter, or change his purposes that division and\r\ndepartment commanders, as well as the general of the army, should\r\nexercise the same command of the staff as they did of the line of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nI need not remind the Secretary that orders and reports are made to\r\nand from the Military Academy which the general does not even see,\r\nthough the Military Academy is specifically named as a part of that\r\narmy which he is required to command.  Leaves of absence are\r\ngranted, the stations of officers are changed, and other orders are\r\nnow made directly to the army, not through the general, but direct\r\nthrough other officials and the adjutant-general.\r\n\r\nSo long as this is the case I surely do not command the army of the\r\nUnited States, and am not responsible for it.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the confusion results from the fact that the\r\nthirty-seventh section of the act of July 28, 1866, clothes the\r\narmy regulations of 1863 with the sanction of law, but the next\r\nsection repeals all laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the\r\nprovisions of this act.  The regulations of 1863 are but a\r\ncompilation of orders made prior to the war, when such men as Davis\r\nand Floyd took pleasure in stripping General Scott of even the\r\nsemblance of power, and purposely reduced him to a cipher in the\r\ncommand of the army.\r\n\r\nNot one word can be found in those regulations speaking of the\r\nduties of the lieutenant-general commanding the army, or defining a\r\nsingle act of authority rightfully devolving on him.  Not a single\r\nmention is made of the rights and duties of a commander-in-chief of\r\nthe army.  He is ignored, and purposely, too, as a part of the\r\nprogramme resulting in the rebellion, that the army without a\r\nlegitimate head should pass into the anarchy which these men were\r\nshaping for the whole country.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the army regulations of 1847, when our\r\nbest soldiers lived, among whom was your own father, and see\r\nparagraphs 48 and 49, page 8, and they are so important that I\r\nquote them entire:\r\n\r\n\"48.  The military establishment is placed under the orders of the\r\nmajor-general commanding in chief in all that regards its\r\ndiscipline and military control.  Its fiscal arrangements properly\r\nbelong to the administrative departments of the staff and to the\r\nTreasury Department under the direction of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\"49.  The general of the army will watch over the economy of the\r\nservice in all that relates to the expenditure of money, supply of\r\narms, ordnance and ordnance stores, clothing, equipments,\r\ncamp-equipage, medical and hospital stores, barracks, quarters,\r\ntransportation, Military Academy, pay, and subsistence: in short,\r\neverything which enters into the expenses of the military\r\nestablishment, whether personal or material.  He will also see that\r\nthe estimates for the military service are based on proper data,\r\nand made for the objects contemplated by law, and necessary to the\r\ndue support and useful employment of the army.  In carrying into\r\neffect these important duties, he will call to his counsel and\r\nassistance the staff, and those officers proper, in his opinion, to\r\nbe employed in verifying and inspecting all the objects which may\r\nrequire attention.  The rules and regulations established for the\r\ngovernment of the army, and the laws relating to the military\r\nestablishment, are the guides to the commanding general in the\r\nperformance of his duties.\"\r\n\r\nWhy was this, or why was all mention of any field of duty for the\r\nhead of the army left out of the army regulations?  Simply because\r\nJefferson Davis had a purpose, and absorbed to himself, as\r\nSecretary of War, as General Grant well says, all the powers of\r\ncommander-in-chief.  Floyd succeeded him, and the last regulations\r\nof 1863 were but a new compilation of their orders, hastily\r\ncollected and published to supply a vast army with a new edition.\r\n\r\nI contend that all parts of these regulations inconsistent with the\r\nlaw of July 28, 1866, are repealed.\r\n\r\nI surely do not ask for any power myself, but I hope and trust, now\r\nwhen we have a military President and a military Secretary of War,\r\nthat in the new regulations to be laid before Congress next session\r\nthe functions and duties of the commander-in-chief will be so\r\nclearly marked out and defined that they may be understood by\r\nhimself and the army at large.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, General.\r\n\r\n[Inclosure.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 29, 1866.\r\n\r\nHon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nFrom the period of the difficulties between Major-General (now\r\nLieutenant-General) Scott with Secretary Marcy, during the\r\nadministration of President Polk, the command of the army virtually\r\npassed into the hands of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nFrom that day to the breaking out of the rebellion the general-\r\nin-chief never kept his headquarters in Washington, and could not,\r\nconsequently, with propriety resume his proper functions.  To\r\nadminister the affairs of the army properly, headquarters and the\r\nadjutant-general's office must be in the same place.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, while in the field, my functions as commander of\r\nall the armies was never impaired, but were facilitated in all\r\nessential matters by the Administration and by the War Department.\r\nNow, however, that the war is over, and I have brought my head-\r\nquarters to the city, I find my present position embarrassing and,\r\nI think, out of place.  I have been intending, or did intend, to\r\nmake the beginning of the New Year the time to bring this matter\r\nbefore you, with the view of asking to have the old condition of\r\naffairs restored, but from diffidence about mentioning the matter\r\nhave delayed.  In a few words I will state what I conceive to be my\r\nduties and my place, and ask respectfully to be restored to them\r\nand it.\r\n\r\nThe entire adjutant-general's office should be under the entire\r\ncontrol of the general-in-chief of the army.  No orders should go\r\nto the army, or the adjutant-general, except through the general-\r\nin-chief.  Such as require the action of the President would be\r\nlaid before the Secretary of War, whose actions would be regarded\r\nas those of the President.  In short, in my opinion, the general-\r\nin-chief stands between the President and the army in all official\r\nmatters, and the Secretary of War is between the army (through the\r\ngeneral-in-chief) and the President.\r\n\r\nI can very well conceive that a rule so long disregarded could not,\r\nor would not, be restored without the subject being presented, and\r\nI now do so respectfully for your consideration.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Belknap never answered that letter.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1870, was held at Des Moines, Iowa, an encampment of old\r\nsoldiers which I attended, en route to the Pacific, and at Omaha\r\nreceived this letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG BRANCH, New Jersey, August 18,1870.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: Your letter of the 7th inst. did not reach Long\r\nBranch until after I had left for St. Louis, and consequently is\r\njust before me for the first time.  I do not know what changes\r\nrecent laws, particularly the last army bill passed, make in the\r\nrelations between the general of the army and the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nNot having this law or other statutes here, I cannot examine the\r\nsubject now, nor would I want to without consultation with the\r\nSecretary of War.  On our return to Washington I have no doubt but\r\nthat the relations between the Secretary and yourself can be made\r\npleasant, and the duties of each be so clearly defined as to leave\r\nno doubt where the authority of one leaves off and the other\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\nMy own views, when commanding the army, were that orders to the\r\narmy should go through the general.  No changes should be made,\r\nhowever, either of the location of troops or officers, without the\r\nknowledge of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nIn peace, the general commanded them without reporting to the\r\nSecretary farther than he chose the specific orders he gave from\r\ntime to time, but subjected himself to orders from the Secretary,\r\nthe latter deriving his authority to give orders from the\r\nPresident.  As Congress has the right, however, to make rules and\r\nregulations for the government of the army, rules made by them\r\nwhether they are as they should be or not, will have to govern.  As\r\nbefore stated, I have not examined the recent law.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which I replied:\r\n\r\nOMAHA, NEBRASKA, September 2,1870.\r\n\r\nGeneral U. S. GRANT, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL: I have received your most acceptable letter of August\r\n18th, and assure you that I am perfectly willing to abide by any\r\ndecision you may make.  We had a most enthusiastic meeting at Des\r\nMoines, and General Bellknap gave us a fine, finished address.  I\r\nhave concluded to go over to San Francisco to attend the annual\r\ncelebration of the Pioneers, to be held on the 9th instant; from\r\nthere I will make a short tour, aiming to get back to St. Louis by\r\nthe 1st of October, and so on to Washington without unnecessary\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nConscious of the heavy burdens already on you, I should refrain\r\nfrom adding one ounce to your load of care, but it seems to me now\r\nis the time to fix clearly and plainly the field of duty for the\r\nSecretary of War and the commanding general of the army, so that we\r\nmay escape the unpleasant controversy that gave so much scandal in\r\nGeneral Scott's time, and leave to our successors a clear field.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the result, I promise to submit to whatever decision\r\nyou may make.  I also feel certain that General Belknap thinks he\r\nis simply executing the law as it now stands, but I am equally\r\ncertain that he does not interpret the law reviving the grade of\r\ngeneral, and that fixing the \"peace establishment\" of 1868, as I\r\nconstrue them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I am supposed to control the discipline of the\r\nMilitary Academy as a part of the army, whereas General Belknap\r\nordered a court of inquiry in the case of the colored cadet, made\r\nthe detail, reviewed the proceedings, and made his order, without\r\nmy knowing a word of it, except through the newspapers; and more\r\nrecently, when I went to Chicago to attend to some division\r\nbusiness, I found the inspector-general (Hardie) under orders from\r\nthe Secretary of War to go to Montana on some claim business.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is that such orders should go through me.  If all the\r\nstaff-officers are subject to receive orders direct from the\r\nSecretary of War it will surely clash with the orders they may be\r\nin the act of executing from me, or from their immediate\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\nI ask that General Belknap draw up some clear, well-defined rules\r\nfor my action, that he show them to me before publication, that I\r\nmake on them my remarks, and then that you make a final decision.\r\nI promise faithfully to abide by it, or give up my commission.\r\n\r\nPlease show this to General Belknap, and I will be back early in\r\nOctober.  With great respect, your friend,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN\r\n\r\nI did return about October 15th, saw President Grant, who said\r\nnothing had been done in the premises, but that he would bring\r\nGeneral Belknap and me together and settle this matter.  Matters\r\nwent along pretty much as usual till the month of August, 1871,\r\nwhen I dined at the Arlington with Admiral Alder and General\r\nBelknap.  The former said he had been promoted to rear-admiral and\r\nappointed to command the European squadron, then at Villa Franca,\r\nnear Nice, and that he was going out in the frigate Wabash,\r\ninviting me to go along.  I had never been to Europe, and the\r\nopportunity was too tempting to refuse.  After some preliminaries I\r\nagreed to go along, taking with me as aides-de-camp Colonel\r\nAudenried and Lieutenant Fred Grant.  The Wabash was being\r\noverhauled at the Navy-Yard at Boston, and was not ready to sail\r\ntill November, when she came to New-York, where we all embarked\r\nSaturday, November 11th.\r\n\r\nI have very full notes of the whole trip, and here need only state\r\nthat we went out to the Island of Madeira, and thence to Cadiz and\r\nGibraltar.  Here my party landed, and the Wabash went on to Villa\r\nFranca.  From Gibraltar we made the general tour of Spain to\r\nBordeaux, through the south of France to Marseilles, Toulon, etc.,\r\nto Nice, from which place we rejoined the Wabash and brought ashore\r\nour baggage.\r\n\r\nFrom Nice we went to Genoa, Turin, the Mont Cenis Tunnel, Milan,\r\nVenice, etc., to Rome.  Thence to Naples, Messina, and Syracuse,\r\nwhere we took a steamer to Malta.  From Malta to Egypt and\r\nConstantinople, to Sebastopol, Poti, and Tiflis.  At Constantinople\r\nand Sebastopol my party was increased by Governor Curtin, his son,\r\nand Mr. McGahan.\r\n\r\nIt was my purpose to have reached the Caspian, and taken boats to\r\nthe Volga, and up that river as far as navigation would permit, but\r\nwe were dissuaded by the Grand-Duke Michael, Governor-General of\r\nthe Caucasas, and took carriages six hundred miles to Taganrog, on\r\nthe Sea of Azof, to which point the railroad system of Russia was\r\ncompleted.  From Taganrog we took cars to Moscow and St.\r\nPetersburg.  Here Mr. Curtin and party remained, he being our\r\nMinister at that court; also Fred Grant left us to visit his aunt\r\nat Copenhagen.  Colonel Audenried and I then completed the tour of\r\ninterior Europe, taking in Warsaw, Berlin, Vienna, Switzerland,\r\nFrance, England, Scotland, and Ireland, embarking for home in the\r\ngood steamer Baltic, Saturday, September 7, 1872, reaching\r\nWashington, D. C., September 22d.  I refrain from dwelling on this\r\ntrip, because it would swell this chapter beyond my purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen I regained my office I found matters unchanged since my\r\ndeparture, the Secretary of War exercising all the functions of\r\ncommander-in-chief, and I determined to allow things to run to their\r\nnecessary conclusion.  In 1873 my daughter Minnie also made a trip\r\nto Europe, and I resolved as soon as she returned that I would\r\nsimply move back to St. Louis to execute my office there as best I\r\ncould.  But I was embarrassed by being the possessor of a large\r\npiece of property in Washington on I Street, near the corner of\r\nThird, which I could at the time neither sell nor give away.  It\r\ncame into my possession as a gift from friends in New York and\r\nBoston, who had purchased it of General Grant and transferred to me\r\nat the price of $65,000.\r\n\r\nThe house was very large, costly to light, heat, and maintain, and\r\nCongress had reduced my pay four or five thousand dollars a year,\r\nso that I was gradually being impoverished.  Taxes, too, grew\r\nannually, from about four hundred dollars a year to fifteen\r\nhundred, besides all sorts of special taxes.\r\n\r\nFinding myself caught in a dilemma, I added a new hall, and made\r\nout of it two houses, one of which I occupied, and the other I\r\nrented, and thus matters stood in 1873-'74.  By the agency of Mr.\r\nHall, a neighbor and broker, I effected a sale of the property to\r\nthe present owner, Mr. Emory, at a fair price, accepting about half\r\npayment in notes, and the other half in a piece of property on E\r\nStreet, which I afterward exchanged for a place in Cite Brilliante,\r\na suburb of St. Louis, which I still own.  Being thus foot-loose,\r\nand having repeatedly notified President Grant of my purpose, I\r\nwrote the Secretary of War on the 8th day of May, 1874, asking the\r\nauthority of the President and the War Department to remove my\r\nheadquarters to St. Louis.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th day of May General Belknap replied that I had the\r\nassent of the President and himself, inclosing the rough draft of\r\nan order to accomplish this result, which I answered on the 15th,\r\nexpressing my entire satisfaction, only requesting delay in the\r\npublication of the orders till August or September, as I preferred\r\nto make the changes in the month of October.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of September these orders were made:\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON, September 8,\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nGeneral Orders No. 108.\r\n\r\nWith the assent of the President, and at the request of the\r\nGeneral, the headquarters of the armies of the United States will\r\nbe established at St. Louis, Missouri, in the month of October\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThe regulations and orders now governing the functions of the\r\nGeneral of the Army, and those in relation to transactions of\r\nbusiness with the War Department and its bureaus, will continue in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nE.  D.  TOWNSEND, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur daughter Minnie was married October 1, 1874, to Thomas W.\r\nFitch, United States Navy, and we all forthwith packed up and\r\nregained our own house at St. Louis, taking an office on the corner\r\nof Tenth and Locust Streets.  The only staff I brought with me were\r\nthe aides allowed by law, and, though we went through the forms of\r\n\"command,\" I realized that it was a farce, and it did not need a\r\nprophet to foretell it would end in a tragedy.  We made ourselves\r\nvery comfortable, made many pleasant excursions into the interior,\r\nhad a large correspondence, and escaped the mortification of being\r\nslighted by men in Washington who were using their temporary power\r\nfor selfish ends.\r\n\r\nEarly in March, 1676, appeared in all the newspapers of the day the\r\nsensational report from Washington that Secretary of War Belknap\r\nhad been detected in selling sutlerships in the army; that he had\r\nconfessed it to Representative Blackburn, of Kentucky; that he had\r\ntendered his resignation, which had been accepted by the President;\r\nand that he was still subject to impeachment,--would be impeached\r\nand tried by the Senate.  I was surprised to learn that General\r\nBelknap was dishonest in money matters, for I believed him a brave\r\nsoldier, and I sorely thought him honest; but the truth was soon\r\nrevealed from Washington, and very soon after I received from Judge\r\nAlphonso Taft, of Cincinnati, a letter informing me that he had\r\nbeen appointed Secretary of War, and should insist on my immediate\r\nreturn to Washington.  I answered that I was ready to go to\r\nWashington, or anywhere, if assured of decent treatment.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to Washington, when, on the 6th of April, were\r\npublished these orders:\r\n\r\nGeneral Orders No. 28.\r\n\r\nThe following orders of the President of the United States are\r\nhereby promulgated for the information and guidance of all\r\nconcerned:\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the army are hereby reestablished at Washington\r\nCity, and all orders and instructions relative to military\r\noperations or affecting the military control and discipline of the\r\narmy issued by the President through the Secretary of War, shall be\r\npromulgated through the General of the Army, and the departments of\r\nthe Adjutant-General and the Inspector-General shall report to him,\r\nand be under his control in all matters relating thereto.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nE.  D.  TOWNSEND, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was all I had ever asked; accordingly my personal staff were\r\nbrought back to Washington, where we resumed our old places; only I\r\ndid not, for some time, bring back the family, and then only to a\r\nrented house on Fifteenth Street, which we occupied till we left\r\nWashington for good.  During the period from 1876 to 1884 we had as\r\nSecretaries of War in succession, the Hon's. Alphonso Taft, J. D.\r\nCameron, George W. McCrary, Alexander Ramsey, and R. T. Lincoln,\r\nwith each and all of whom I was on terms of the most intimate and\r\nfriendly relations.\r\n\r\nAnd here I will record of Washington that I saw it, under the magic\r\nhand of Alexander R. Shepherd, grow from a straggling, ill-paved\r\ncity, to one of the cleanest, most beautiful, and attractive cities\r\nof the whole world.  Its climate is salubrious, with as much\r\nsunshine as any city of America.  The country immediately about it\r\nis naturally beautiful and romantic, especially up the Potomac, in\r\nthe region of the Great Falls; and, though the soil be poor as\r\ncompared with that of my present home, it is susceptible of easy\r\nimprovement and embellishment.  The social advantages cannot be\r\nsurpassed even in London, Paris, or Vienna; and among the resident\r\npopulation, the members of the Supreme Court, Senate, House of\r\nRepresentatives, army, navy, and the several executive departments,\r\nmay be found an intellectual class one cannot encounter in our\r\ncommercial and manufacturing cities.  The student may, without tax\r\nand without price, have access, in the libraries of Congress and of\r\nthe several departments, to books of every nature and kind; and the\r\nmuseums of natural history are rapidly approaching a standard of\r\ncomparison with the best of the world.  Yet it is the usual and\r\nproper center of political intrigue, from which the army especially\r\nshould keep aloof, because the army must be true and faithful to\r\nthe powers that be, and not be subjected to a temptation to favor\r\none or other of the great parties into which our people have\r\ndivided, and will continue to divide, it may be, with advantage to\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nIt would be a labor of love for me, in this connection, to pay a\r\ntribute of respect, by name, to the many able and most patriotic\r\nofficers with whom I was so long associated as the commanding\r\ngenerals of military divisions and departments, as well as\r\nstaff-officers; but I must forego the temptation, because of the\r\nmagnitude of the subject, certain that each and all of them will\r\nfind biographers better posted and more capable than myself; and I\r\nwould also like to make recognition of the hundreds of acts of most\r\ngraceful hospitality on the part of the officers and families at\r\nour remote military posts in the days, of the \"adobe,\" the \"jacal,\"\r\nand \"dug-out,\" when a board floor and a shingle roof were luxuries\r\nexpected by none except the commanding officer.  I can see, in\r\nmemory, a beautiful young city-bred lady, who had married a poor\r\nsecond-lieutenant, and followed him to his post on the plains,\r\nwhose quarters were in a \"dug-out\" ten feet by about fifteen, seven\r\nfeet high, with a dirt roof; four feet of the walls were the\r\nnatural earth, the other three of sod, with holes for windows and\r\ncorn-sacks for curtains.  This little lady had her Saratoga trunk,\r\nwhich was the chief article of furniture; yet, by means of a rug on\r\nthe ground-floor, a few candle-boxes covered with red cotton calico\r\nfor seats, a table improvised out of a barrel-head, and a fireplace\r\nand chimney excavated in the back wall or bank, she had transformed\r\nher \"hole in the ground\" into a most attractive home for her young\r\nwarrior husband; and she entertained me with a supper consisting of\r\nthe best of coffee, fried ham, cakes, and jellies from the\r\ncommissary, which made on my mind an impression more lasting than\r\nhave any one of the hundreds of magnificent banquets I have since\r\nattended in the palaces and mansions of our own and foreign lands.\r\n\r\nStill more would I like to go over again the many magnificent trips\r\nmade across the interior plains, mountains, and deserts before the\r\ndays of the completed Pacific Railroad, with regular \"Doughertys\"\r\ndrawn by four smart mules, one soldier with carbine or loaded\r\nmusket in hand seated alongside the driver; two in the back seat\r\nwith loaded rifles swung in the loops made for them; the lightest\r\nkind of baggage, and generally a bag of oats to supplement the\r\ngrass, and to attach the mules to their camp.  With an outfit of\r\ntwo, three, or four of such, I have made journeys of as much as\r\neighteen hundred miles in a single season, usually from post to\r\npost, averaging in distance about two hundred miles a week, with as\r\nmuch regularity as is done today by the steam-car its five hundred\r\nmiles a day; but those days are gone, and, though I recognize the\r\ngreat national advantages of the more rapid locomotion, I cannot\r\nhelp occasionally regretting the change.  One instance in 1866\r\nrises in my memory, which I must record: Returning eastward from\r\nFort Garland, we ascended the Rocky Mountains to the Sangre-de-\r\nCristo Pass.  The road descending the mountain was very rough and\r\nsidling.  I got out with my rifle, and walked ahead about four\r\nmiles, where I awaited my \"Dougherty.\"  After an hour or so I saw,\r\ncoming down the road, a wagon; and did not recognize it as my own\r\ntill quite near.  It had been upset, the top all mashed in, and no\r\nmeans at hand for repairs.  I consequently turned aside from the\r\nmain road to a camp of cavalry near the Spanish Peaks, where we\r\nwere most hospitably received by Major A---- and his accomplished\r\nwife.  They occupied a large hospital-tent, which about a dozen\r\nbeautiful greyhounds were free to enter at will.  The ambulance was\r\nrepaired, and the next morning we renewed our journey, escorted by\r\nthe major and his wife on their fine saddle-horses.\r\n\r\nThey accompanied us about ten miles of the way; and, though age has\r\nsince begun to tell on them, I shall ever remember them in their\r\npride and strength as they galloped alongside our wagons down the\r\nlong slopes of the Spanish Peaks in a driving snow-storm.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again would it be a pleasant task to recall the many\r\nbanquets and feasts of the various associations of officers and\r\nsoldiers, who had fought the good battles of the civil war, in\r\nwhich I shared as a guest or host, when we could indulge in a\r\nreasonable amount of glorification at deeds done and recorded, with\r\nwit, humor, and song; these when memory was fresh, and when the old\r\nsoldiers were made welcome to the best of cheer and applause in\r\nevery city and town of the land.  But no! I must hurry to my\r\nconclusion, for this journey has already been sufficiently\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\nI had always intended to divide time with my natural successor,\r\nGeneral P. H. Sheridan, and early, notified him that I should about\r\nthe year 1884 retire from the command of the army, leaving him\r\nabout an equal period of time for the highest office in the army.\r\nIt so happened that Congress had meantime by successive \"enactments\"\r\ncut down the army to twenty-five thousand men, the usual strength\r\nof a corps d'armée, the legitimate command of a lieutenant-general.\r\nUp to 1882 officers not disabled by wounds or sickness could only\r\navail themselves of the privileges of retirement on application,\r\nafter thirty years of service, at sixty-two years of age; but on\r\nthe 30th of June, 1882, a bill was passed which, by operation of\r\nthe law itself, compulsorily retired all army officers, regardless\r\nof rank, at the age of sixty-four years.  At the time this law was\r\ndebated in Congress, I was consulted by Senators and others in the\r\nmost friendly manner, representing that, if I wanted it, an\r\nexception could justly and easily be made in favor of the general\r\nand lieutenant-general, whose commissions expired with their lives;\r\nbut I invariably replied that I did not ask or expect an exception\r\nin my case, because no one could know or realize when his own\r\nmental and physical powers began to decline.  I remembered well the\r\nexperience of Gil Blas with the Bishop of Granada, and favored the\r\npassage of the law fixing a positive period for retirement, to\r\nobviate in the future special cases of injustice such as I had seen\r\nin the recent past. The law was passed, and every officer then knew\r\nthe very day on which he must retire, and could make his\r\npreparations accordingly.  In my own case the law was liberal in\r\nthe extreme, being \"without reduction in his current pay and\r\nallowances.\"\r\n\r\nI would be sixty-four years old on the 8th of February, 1884, a\r\ndate inconvenient to move, and not suited to other incidents; so I\r\nresolved to retire on the 1st day of November, 1883, to resume my\r\nformer home at St. Louis, and give my successor ample time to meet\r\nthe incoming Congress, But, preliminary thereto, I concluded to\r\nmake one more tour of the continent, going out to the Pacific by\r\nthe Northern route, and returning by that of the thirty-fifth\r\nparallel.  This we accomplished, beginning at Buffalo, June 21st,\r\nand ending at St. Louis, Missouri, September 30, 1883, a full and\r\nmost excellent account of which can be found in Colonel Tidball's\r\n\"Diary,\" which forms part of the report of the General of the Army\r\nfor the year 1883.\r\n\r\nBefore retiring also, as was my duty, I desired that my aides-\r\nde-camp who had been so faithful and true to me should not suffer\r\nby my act.  All were to retain the rank of colonels of cavalry till\r\nthe last day, February 8, 1884; but meantime each secured places,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nColonel O. M. Poe was lieutenant-colonel of the Engineer Corps\r\nUnited States Army, and was by his own choice assigned to Detroit\r\nin charge of the engineering works on the Upper Lakes, which duty\r\nwas most congenial to him.\r\n\r\nColonel J. C. Tidball was assigned to command the Artillery School\r\nat Fort Monroe, by  virtue of his commission as lieutenant-colonel,\r\nThird Artillery, a station for which he was specially qualified.\r\n\r\nColonel John E.  Tourtelotte was then entitled to promotion to\r\nmajor of the Seventh Cavalry, a rank in which he could be certain\r\nof an honorable command.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining aide-de-camp was Colonel John M. Bacon, who\r\nutterly ignored self in his personal attachment to me.  He was then\r\na captain of the Ninth Cavalry, but with almost a certainty of\r\npromotion to be major of the Seventh before the date of my official\r\nretirement, which actually resulted.  The last two accompanied me\r\nto St. Louis, and remained with me to the end.  Having previously\r\naccomplished the removal of my family to St. Louis, and having\r\ncompleted my last journey to the Pacific, I wrote the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY UNITED STATES,\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., October 8, 1883.\r\n\r\nHon. R. T. LINCOLN, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nSIR: By the act of Congress, approved June 30, 1882, all\r\narmy-officers are retired on reaching the age of sixty-four years.\r\nIf living, I will attain that age on the 8th day of February, 1884;\r\nbut as that period of the year is not suited for the changes\r\nnecessary on my retirement, I have contemplated anticipating the\r\nevent by several months, to enable the President to meet these\r\nchanges at a more convenient season of the year, and also to enable\r\nmy successor to be in office before the assembling of the next\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI therefore request authority to turn over the command of the army\r\nto Lieutenant-General Sheridan on the 1st day of November, 1883,\r\nand that I be ordered to my home at St. Louis, Missouri, there to\r\nawait the date of my legal retirement; and inasmuch as for a long\r\ntime I must have much correspondence about war and official\r\nmatters, I also ask the favor to have with me for a time my two\r\npresent aides-de-camp, Colonels J. E. Tourtelotte and J. M. Bacon.\r\n\r\nThe others of my personal staff, viz., Colonels O. M. Poe and J.\r\nC. Tidball, have already been assigned to appropriate duties in\r\ntheir own branches of the military service, the engineers and\r\nartillery.  All should retain the rank and pay as aides-de-camp\r\nuntil February 8,1884.  By or before the 1st day of November I can\r\ncomplete all official reports, and believe I can surrender the army\r\nto my successor in good shape and condition, well provided in all\r\nrespects, and distributed for the best interests of the country.\r\n\r\nI am grateful that my physical and mental-strength remain\r\nunimpaired by years, and am thankful for the liberal provision made\r\nby Congress for my remaining years, which will enable me to respond\r\npromptly to any call the President may make for my military service\r\nor judgment as long as I live.  I have the honor to be your\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer was:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, October 10, 1888.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. T. SHERMAN, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have submitted to the President your letter of the 8th\r\ninstant, requesting that you be relieved of the command of the army\r\non the 1st of November next, as a more convenient time for making\r\nthe changes in military commands which must follow your retirement\r\nfrom active service, than would be the date of your retirement\r\nunder the law.\r\n\r\nIn signifying his approval of your request, the President directs\r\nme to express to you his earnest hope that there may be given you\r\nmany years of health and happiness in which to enjoy the gratitude\r\nof your fellow-citizens, well earned by your most distinguished\r\npublic services.\r\n\r\nIt will give me pleasure to comply with your wishes respecting your\r\naides-de-camp, and the necessary orders will be duly issued.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, General, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT T.  LINCOLN, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 27th day of October I submitted to the Secretary of\r\nWar, the Hon. R. T. Lincoln, my last annual report, embracing among\r\nother valuable matters the most interesting and condensed report of\r\nColonel O. M. Poe, A. D. C., of the \"original conception, progress,\r\nand completion\" of the four great transcontinental railways, which\r\nhave in my judgment done more for the subjugation and civilization\r\nof the Indians than all other causes combined, and have made\r\npossible the utilization of the vast area of pasture lands and\r\nmineral regions which before were almost inaccessible, for my\r\nagency in which I feel as much pride as for my share in any of the\r\nbattles in which I took part.\r\n\r\nPromptly on the 1st of November were made the following general\r\norders, and the command of the Army of the United States passed\r\nfrom me to Lieutenant-General P. H. Sheridan, with as little\r\nceremony as would attend the succession of the lieutenant-colonel\r\nof a regiment to his colonel about to take a leave of absence:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, November 1, 1885.\r\n\r\nGeneral Orders No. 77:\r\n\r\nBy and with the consent of the President, as contained in General\r\nOrders No. 71, of October 13, 1883, the undersigned relinquishes\r\ncommand of the Army of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn thus severing relations which have hitherto existed between us,\r\nhe thanks all officers and men for their fidelity to the high trust\r\nimposed on them during his official life, and will, in his\r\nretirement, watch with parental solicitude their progress upward in\r\nthe noble profession to which they have devoted their lives.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, General.\r\n\r\nOfficial: R. C. DRUM, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY\r\nWASHINGTON, November 1, 1885.\r\n\r\nGeneral Orders No. 78:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to orders of the President, promulgated in General\r\nOrders No. 71, October 13, 1883, from these headquarters, the\r\nundersigned hereby assumes command of the Army of the United\r\nStates....\r\n\r\nP. H. SHERIDAN, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\nOfficial: R.  C.  DRUM, adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a few days in which to complete my social visits, and after a\r\nshort visit to my daughter, Mrs. A. M. Thackara, at Philadelphia, I\r\nquietly departed for St. Louis; and, as I hope, for \"good and all,\"\r\nthe family was again reunited in the same place from which we were\r\ndriven by a cruel, unnecessary civil war initiated in Charleston\r\nHarbor in April, 1861.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of February, 1884; I was sixty-four years of age,\r\nand therefore retired by the operation of the act of Congress,\r\napproved June 30, 1882; but the fact was gracefully noticed by\r\nPresident Arthur in the following general orders:\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\nWASHINGTON, February 8, 1984.\r\n\r\nThe following order of the President is published to the army:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 8, 1884.\r\n\r\nGeneral William T. Sherman, General of the Army, having this day\r\nreached the age of sixty-four years, is, in accordance with the\r\nlaw, placed upon the retired list of the army, without reduction in\r\nhis current pay and allowances.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the severance from the command of the army of\r\none who has been for so many years its distinguished chief, can but\r\nawaken in the minds, not only of the army, but of the people of the\r\nUnited States, mingled emotions of regret and gratitude--regret at\r\nthe withdrawal from active military service of an officer whose\r\nlofty sense of duty has been a model for all soldiers since he\r\nfirst entered the army in July, 1840; and gratitude, freshly\r\nawakened, for the services of incalculable value rendered by him in\r\nthe war for the Union, which his great military genius and daring\r\ndid so much to end.\r\n\r\nThe President deems this a fitting occasion to give expression, in\r\nthis manner, to the gratitude felt toward General Sherman by his\r\nfellow-citizens, and to the hope that Providence may grant him many\r\nyears of health and happiness in the relief from the active duties\r\nof his profession.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nR. C. DRUM, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which I replied:\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, February 9, 1884.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency CHESTER A. ARTHUR,\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: Permit me with a soldier's frankness to thank you\r\npersonally for the handsome compliment bestowed in general orders\r\nof yesterday, which are reported in the journals of the day.  To me\r\nit was a surprise and a most agreeable one.  I had supposed the\r\nactual date of my retirement would form a short paragraph in the\r\ncommon series of special orders of the War Department; but as the\r\nhonored Executive of our country has made it the occasion for his\r\nown hand to pen a tribute of respect and affection to an officer\r\npassing from the active stage of life to one of ease and rest, I\r\ncan only say I feel highly honored, and congratulate myself in thus\r\nrounding out my record of service in a manner most gratifying to my\r\nfamily and friends.  Not only this, but I feel sure, when the\r\norders of yesterday are read on parade to the regiments and\r\ngarrisons of the United States, many a young hero will tighten his\r\nbelt, and resolve anew to be brave and true to the starry flag,\r\nwhich we of our day have carried safely through one epoch of\r\ndanger, but which may yet be subjected to other trials, which may\r\ndemand similar sacrifices, equal fidelity and courage, and a larger\r\nmeasure of intelligence.  Again thanking you for so marked a\r\ncompliment, and reciprocating the kind wishes for the future,\r\n\r\nI am, with profound respect, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, General.\r\n\r\nThis I construe as the end of my military career.  In looking back\r\nupon the past I can only say, with millions of others, that I have\r\ndone many things I should not have done, and have left undone still\r\nmore which ought to have been done; that I can see where hundreds\r\nof opportunities have been neglected, but on the whole am content;\r\nand feel sure that I can travel this broad country of ours, and be\r\neach night the welcome guest in palace or cabin; and, as\r\n\r\n               \"all the world's stage,\r\n                And all the men and women merely players,\"\r\n\r\nI claim the privilege to ring down the curtain.\r\n\r\nW. T. SHERMAN, General.",
