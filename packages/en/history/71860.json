Some of these notes were published in\r\n_Murray’s Magazine_ in 1887 under the title of ‘Scraps from my\r\nNote-book’; others were laid by to be incorporated in a complete volume.\r\nThe work was, however, interrupted by an accident to one of his eyes\r\nwhich rendered it impossible for him to write. For a time he confined\r\nhimself to dictating to my sister, who acted as his amanuensis, quaint\r\nstories and detached incidents connected with the Moors, intending to\r\nresume the continuous tale of his life when his sight grew stronger.\r\nBut, shortly after the recovery of his eyesight, and before he had\r\nproceeded much further in ‘unwinding the skein of his memories,’ he was\r\nprostrated by a severe illness, followed by influenza, of which he died\r\nin 1893.\r\n\r\nIt has fallen therefore to my sister, Miss Drummond Hay, and myself,\r\nhis two daughters, to endeavour to unite, to the best of our ability,\r\nthese scattered notes and memoranda, and to add to them such details as\r\ncould be supplied from our own recollections. In this task we have been\r\nnaturally somewhat restricted. In the first place, we have been obliged\r\nto omit from the memoirs of one who lived and died so recently much\r\nthat might have been published twenty years hence. In the second place,\r\nas we have been necessarily debarred from using any official documents\r\nexcept those published in the Blue Books, our work can scarcely do full\r\njustice to the life of a public servant. These restrictions have not\r\nlightened our task; and, had it not been for the kindly help and advice\r\nof friends, we should have had still greater difficulty in tracing,\r\nfrom my father’s notes and private correspondence, the course of his\r\nlifelong labours in Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of Sir John’s letters are addressed to his mother—to\r\nwhom he was a devoted son—and, later, to his eldest sister, Mrs.\r\nNorderling, who was during her lifetime the sympathetic and intelligent\r\nsharer of his confidences. Except with his mother and sister he carried\r\non but little private correspondence, principally on account of his\r\nsight, which was enfeebled after an illness in 1859. But he wrote\r\noccasionally to friends, several of whom preserved and have kindly lent\r\nus his letters. Some of these have been utilised, and for all of them\r\nour thanks are most gratefully tendered.\r\n\r\nOn my father’s account of his school days at the Academy in Edinburgh\r\nand at the Charterhouse in London, on his early life at Tangier, or on\r\nhis apprenticeship to diplomacy at Constantinople under Lord Ponsonby\r\nand the great Elchi, it is unnecessary to dilate. The recollections and\r\nimpressions of boyhood and youth break off when more serious work\r\npresses on him after his appointment as Consul General in Morocco in\r\n1845. Though considered very young for such a post, for he was only\r\ntwenty-eight, his training in Egypt and Turkey well qualified him for a\r\nposition which was destined to give scope to a character eulogised by\r\none of his chiefs as vigorous, temperate, and straightforward. He was\r\naided by his great facility in writing and speaking foreign languages,\r\nas at that time he had perfect command of Turkish, Italian, Spanish,\r\nFrench, and Arabic; and to the end he retained his fluency in the\r\nlast three.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that he was appointed Consul General in Morocco, his\r\nletters are animated by the one great aim on which his public career\r\nwas concentrated—the increase and consolidation of British influence\r\nin Morocco. British interests, he believed, could best be furthered by\r\nthe encouragement of commerce, by the amelioration of the condition of\r\nthe Moors, and also by personally gaining the respect of the people.\r\nExtracts from his diary of 1846 tend to show how he set himself to\r\nattain these objects; and his endeavours bore good fruit. The account\r\nof the arrest of piracy in Rif, through his intervention, may be taken\r\nas an instance of his direct personal influence in dealing with the\r\nwild mountain tribes.\r\n\r\nHis power of talking familiarly in their own tongue with natives of\r\nevery degree was of great advantage to him in gaining a personal hold\r\non the people, and many illustrations might be quoted from the stories\r\nwhich he tells of his meetings with various governors of the provinces\r\nthrough which he travelled in the course of his frequent journeys to the\r\nCourt at the cities of Marákesh, Fas, Meknes, or Rabát. In fact his\r\npurity of motive, tenacity of purpose, his ever ready and shrewd advice,\r\nwon the respect and good opinion of the people of Morocco. Implicit\r\nconfidence was placed in him by high and low alike.\r\n\r\nOn his influence with successive Sultans it is unnecessary to enlarge.\r\nThe offer of Sultan Sid Mohammed to place in his hands the entire\r\ncontrol of the foreign affairs of Morocco speaks for itself. The story\r\nof Benabu, again, relates how the latter entrusted untold gold to my\r\nfather’s keeping, assured that his treasure would reach its destination,\r\nthough no witness or written paper attested to the transaction. Lastly,\r\nto take an instance in humble life, we may point to the pitiful faith\r\nplaced in him by a wretched Rifian criminal when on the point of\r\nsurrendering himself to the authorities.\r\n\r\nNor were this reliance in his uprightness and this respect for his\r\njudgment confined to the Moors. During the war between Spain and\r\nMorocco, when he alone of all the Foreign Representatives remained at\r\nhis post, he was appealed to by the Spanish friars to protect their\r\nchurch and its sacred contents from the insults of the angry Moslems.\r\nTheir confidence was not misplaced: his protection secured the sacred\r\nbuilding from the slightest injury.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish war at first seemed likely to check the development of\r\ntrade in Morocco at the moment when it was on the point of revival.\r\nThe promise of prosperity was due to the Commercial Convention\r\nnegotiated by my father in 1856, a convention which an old resident\r\nin Morocco, one well qualified to appreciate its value, has termed\r\nthe Magna Charta of that country. But when peace was declared, the\r\nresult of the contest proved eventually to be rather a blessing than a\r\ncurse. The necessity of raising a loan to pay the war indemnity impelled\r\nthe Sultan to ask help from Great Britain, thus enabling my father the\r\nmore forcibly to impress upon H.S.M. the necessity of introducing into\r\nthe administration of the Customs reforms which immediately and\r\nsubstantially increased the revenues of Morocco.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of the good results which in this instance followed the\r\nacceptance of his advice, the apathetic and ignorant Moors could rarely\r\nbe induced to take active steps in the path of reform. It was only under\r\nthe pressure of necessity that any advance was made. This lethargy did\r\nnot, however, proceed from any want of plain speaking on my father’s\r\npart. As is shown by the account of his private interview with Sultan\r\nSid Mohammed at Marákesh in 1872, he indicated to that potentate, in\r\nthe clearest and most emphatic language, the debased condition of his\r\nrealm, and the iniquities of the system under which his subjects were\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nBut it was not with the recalcitrant Moorish Government alone that my\r\nfather had to contend. His later letters recount his failure to put a\r\ncheck on the abuses caused by the protection of natives by foreigners,\r\nand the consequent downfall of his hope that the end of his career might\r\nbe signalised by another and more extended commercial treaty. The\r\nMoorish Government was not inclined to promote foreign trade, contending\r\nthat greater facilities for commerce would inevitably cause an influx\r\nof alien traders, each of whom would have his native agents and servants\r\nunder the protection of a foreign flag, and that such protected\r\nsubjects, not being immediately amenable to the native authorities,\r\nwould only increase friction, lessen the Sultan’s authority, and\r\ndiminish the exchequer.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty’s Government recognised my father’s value by repeated\r\npromotion, and honours were bestowed on him under various\r\nadministrations; but he was given to understand that his services could\r\nnot be spared from the country where, it may be said, he was an\r\nacknowledged power. Indeed, the principal aim of my father’s life during\r\nhis long career in Morocco—the preponderance of British influence over\r\nthat of all other nations—may be said to have been attained and\r\nmaintained during his tenure of office. In 1885, the last year of his\r\nofficial life, he writes with reference to his unceasing anxiety that\r\nneither France nor any other country should by any means obtain a\r\nfooting in Morocco, ‘As a sentinel of the Straits, I fire my gun, as a\r\nwarning, when I know of a move to obtain that object.’\r\n\r\nSir Francis de Winton, in his kindly and graceful introduction, touches\r\non the expedition to the lower slopes of the Atlas made by the Mission,\r\nof which he was a member, in 1872, when the heights to the eternal snow\r\nwere climbed by Capt. Sawle and Mr. Drummond Hay, and when the cordial\r\nreception offered by the wild natives left a pleasant impression on my\r\nfather and his party. He also refers to my father in the light of a\r\nsportsman. The latter’s recollections of many of the happiest days of\r\nhis life spent in pursuit of wild boar and other game were noted by\r\nhimself, and some of them have been embodied in this work. A keen and\r\nhard rider, an unerring shot in his earlier days, before his eyesight\r\nwas impaired, and of almost reckless courage, he was well fitted to\r\nbecome the elected leader and head of the native hunters. Under his rule\r\nsport flourished in the environs of Tangier, the ground allotted for\r\nthe purpose by the Sultan was properly guarded, and the close season\r\nstrictly observed: it was then that pigsticking in Morocco reached its\r\nhighest perfection, and gave pleasure to many of every rank and\r\ncondition, whether Europeans or natives.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether sport could again flourish in the environs of\r\nTangier as it did in my father’s day. An increasing armed European\r\npopulation, the introduction of weapons of precision, and the denudation\r\nof the woods, render such a prospect unlikely. His stories therefore of\r\nnarrow escapes and exciting days may prove of interest to the lover of\r\nthe chase; and to some, who in those bygone years shared his sport, may\r\nperhaps recall the memory of pleasant times spent with him in the field.\r\n\r\n                                                      L. A. E. BROOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nTo this memoir of the late Sir John Hay Drummond Hay I have been asked\r\nby his daughters to write a few introductory lines.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with Sir John began in the year 1870. At that time I\r\nwas quartered at Gibraltar, being on the staff of Sir William Fenwick\r\nWilliams of Kars, who was then Governor of the fortress.\r\n\r\nThey were old comrades, Sir John and Sir Fenwick, having served together\r\nin Constantinople, and the friendship begun in Turkey was continued at\r\nthe gates of the Mediterranean. Often and often Sir John and Lady\r\nDrummond Hay, with their two daughters, visited the Convent at\r\nGibraltar; and in return the doors of the Legation at Tangier were ever\r\nopen, and always gave us a hearty welcome.\r\n\r\nIt was between 1870 and 1875 that this intercourse took place, and to\r\nme it is filled with happy recollections. The quaint old town of\r\nTangier, full of the decaying influences of Moslem rule, yet keeping\r\nup the struggle of life after an existence of over a thousand years;\r\nracial and religious differences, civilisation and barbarism,\r\nstruggling along together, while Jews and Arabs, unchanged for five\r\nhundred years, jostled with Christendom of the present day. It was a\r\nstrange medley: and out of it all stands one figure prominent, nay\r\npre-eminent, in the history of Morocco during the past forty years.\r\n\r\nI do not think Sir John’s reminiscences sufficiently convey the enormous\r\ninfluence he wielded in the empire, so called, of Morocco. Throughout\r\nthe Sherifian dominions his name was known and respected; and after the\r\nEmperor and the Sheríf of Wazan, his was the most powerful influence in\r\nthe state. His long residence in the country; his intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the manners and customs of the people; his perfect knowledge of\r\nArabic; his love of justice; his absolute fearlessness; his keen\r\nappreciation of their sports and amusements, in which he often joined;\r\nnot only made him the trusted friend of the late Emperor and his\r\npredecessors, but also the chosen friend of the people.\r\n\r\nIn the many expeditions in which I had the good fortune to be one of\r\nSir John’s companions, I had abundant opportunities of observing the\r\npower he possessed over the different tribes with whom we came in\r\ncontact; and especially among the hill tribes of Jebel Musa, who occupy\r\nthe country between Tangier and Tetuan. These people held him in great\r\nesteem, and often sought his advice and counsel in their tribal\r\ndifferences; thus enabling him to be of service to the Emperor in the\r\nconstant struggles between that ruler and his people.\r\n\r\nA description of Morocco and its government has often been essayed by\r\nvarious writers; but no one could give an adequate idea of Sir John’s\r\ninfluence who had not personally witnessed his intercourse with the\r\ndiscordant elements which constitute the government of that country.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I had the pleasure of being on Sir John’s staff when he\r\npaid a visit to the Emperor, who was then residing at Marákesh. What a\r\npleasant journey it was! The daily ride, the evening camp, our first\r\nview of the great Atlas range of mountains, the entry into Marákesh, our\r\nreception by the Sultan, and the six weeks we spent in the city but\r\nlittle known to Europeans; and it was, perhaps, the events of that\r\njourney which impressed one more than anything as to the individuality\r\nand power of the British Representative.\r\n\r\nBy many Sir John will also be remembered as an ardent sportsman. Whether\r\nhe was organising a boar-hunt, or a day after partridge, or enjoying a\r\nrun with the Calpe hounds, there was always the same keen interest,\r\nthe thorough enjoyment of sport, which characterised the man. Under\r\nhis guidance you were always sure of finding boar, or of getting a\r\ngood bag of partridge; and it was through Sir John that, some twelve\r\nmiles South of Tangier, where the ground was favourable, the exciting\r\nsport of pigsticking was introduced into Africa. Well do I remember\r\nafter a day’s sport the evening camp fire, round which we gathered after\r\ndinner, when Sir John would tell us of some of his earlier hunting\r\nrecollections. He was an excellent story-teller, keeping his audience\r\nin a state of the deepest interest to the end; and then, with a merry\r\ntwinkle in his eye, he would finish his narrative by a description of\r\nsome ludicrous incident in which he was often the chief actor, and no\r\none joined more heartily in the laughter which followed than he himself.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, within the short space of an introduction, to give\r\nmore than a mere outline of the personality of Sir John Drummond Hay.\r\nHis recollections furnish the true index to his character. In them\r\nare reflected the sterling honesty, the integrity, and the courage\r\nand capacity of the man who, though working in a country but little\r\nknown and full of prejudice and fanaticism, made England respected and\r\ntrusted. He belonged to that band of the men of Great Britain who\r\nserve their country wherever they are placed, and who, while mindful\r\nof her interests and her honour, gain the good will of the rulers and\r\nthe people to whom they are accredited.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I shall ever remember him as a friend whom I respected,\r\nand for whom I always had a true affection; and when asked to write\r\nthese few lines, while wishing the duty had fallen to an abler pen than\r\nmine, I felt that, having been honoured with his friendship, I might, in\r\naffectionate remembrance of that friendship, write this brief tribute\r\nto his memory.\r\n\r\n                                                         F.

According to this system, vowels are pronounced\r\nas in Italian; consonants as in English; _kh_ and _gh_ as the Oriental\r\ngutturals.\r\n\r\nMorocco, the name of the region of _Western_ Mauritania of Roman\r\ngeography, has undoubtedly been corrupted from the native name ‘Moghreb’\r\n(setting sun). Maroc, Marocco, Marruecos, Marok, &c., written by\r\ndifferent peoples of Europe, are curious corruptions, some even further\r\noff from Moghreb than the English corruption of the native name, and no\r\nnearer to the old classic corruption _Mauritania_ than in beginning with\r\n_Ma_ instead of _Mo_.\r\n\r\nThe name of the ancient _city_ which we British call _Marocco_, or yet\r\nmore absurdly _Morocco_, is in the mouth of the natives ‘_Marákesh_.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SIR JOHN HAY DRUMMOND HAY\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                          BOYHOOD. 1816-1834.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1816, my father, at that time Major in the 73rd Regiment,\r\nwas on the staff of Lord Lynedoch—then in command of the army\r\nof occupation—and held the post of ‘Majeur de Place’ at\r\nValenciennes; where my mother, after the conclusion of peace,\r\nhad joined him. Here I was born on the 1st of June of that year,\r\nand my name was inscribed as a French citizen at the Mayoralty.\r\n\r\nAfter my father retired from the army, he was offered by his\r\nrelative the Earl of Kinnoull, hereditary Lord-Lyon, the office\r\nat Edinburgh of Lord-Lyon Clerk. At Edinburgh we resided first in\r\nan old-fashioned house at Deanhaugh—the boards of the room where\r\nI slept were stained with the blood of a tenant who had committed\r\nsuicide there—the garden adjoined that attached to the house where\r\nthe painter Raeburn dwelt. Later, we moved into a house in Athol\r\nCrescent, one of the first of the new buildings in Edinburgh in those\r\ndays; I have a little sketch, from a window at the back of the house,\r\nof the pretty country seen therefrom and which is now all built over.\r\n\r\nWith my elder brother, I was sent as day-boarder to the Academy. Early\r\nin the morning, after a breakfast of porridge, and having been given\r\nby my mother a penny to buy a ‘bap’ for my luncheon, I started\r\noff, with my satchel on my back, for school. Near Stockbridge I\r\nwould meet ‘daft Jamie’—walking up and down in all weathers,\r\nbareheaded, with his hands behind his back—and often gave the poor\r\nfellow half my bap: one day he had disappeared, and afterwards I\r\nlearnt he had been one of the first victims of the murderers Burke\r\nand Hare, who sold bodies for dissection to the eminent surgeon, Knox.\r\n\r\nBeing an indolent boy, and having great difficulty in learning\r\nby heart any lesson, I was always at the bottom of the form, but,\r\nfor my age and size, I was the best runner and player at football;\r\nat which game I broke my arm and was taken to the well-known surgeon,\r\nSymes, to have it set.\r\n\r\nOn going to school in the morning, I passed through Charlotte\r\nSquare and there frequently met Lord Cockburn[1] taking an early\r\nwalk, wearing Hessian boots, a large frill of shirt showing from his\r\nwaistcoat and a long chain with seals dangling from the fob in the top\r\nof his trousers. He was a friend of my father’s, and on one occasion\r\nhe stopped and asked me to state what place I held in the form.\r\n\r\nHanging my head with shame, I did not reply.\r\n\r\n‘Come,’ he said, ‘I dare say you are dunce! Tell me.’ I\r\nreplied that I was always at the bottom of the form. Upon which Lord\r\nCockburn said, ‘That’s right, my dear boy; keep there and you\r\nare sure to get on in life and become an eminent man. Do you know\r\nwho I am?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ I said, ‘you are a judge.’\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ he resumed, ‘I was like you, always at the bottom of\r\nthe form. Some day you may be a judge, or a greater man than I am.’\r\n\r\nShortly after this happened, having reported to my mother that\r\nI was dunce as usual, she remonstrated with me for being such an\r\nidle boy. Then I joyfully related Lord Cockburn’s language to me,\r\nadding, ‘Some day I shall be as great a man as he is.’\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, the judge was rebuked by my parents for\r\nencouraging me in idleness!\r\n\r\nThe future archbishop, Tait, was at the Edinburgh Academy at the same\r\ntime as myself. Though an idle boy, I learnt more at that school\r\nthan I did in the five years I spent at Charterhouse—whither I\r\nwas transferred with my brother in 1827—and it was at the Academy\r\nthat I won a prize of which I was very proud. It was not a reward\r\nfor efficiency in study, but an annual prize given to the boy who\r\nwas elected by a majority of votes as the favourite of the school.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, being on a visit to a friend in Edinburgh, I went to the\r\nAcademy, and on inquiring of the porter at the entrance who were then\r\nthe masters, I learnt that one of them was Ferguson, who had been\r\nmaster of my form, and that he was then at lunch in the lodge with\r\nthe other masters. I entered, without my name being announced, and,\r\nrecognising Ferguson, gravely said: ‘I beg to be let off to-day,\r\nSir, for being late; I was prevented coming earlier.’\r\n\r\n‘Hay junior,’ he replied at once, ‘you are forgiven.’ How he\r\nhad been able to remember my face after a lapse of sixteen years,\r\nwhen he had known me only a smooth-faced boy, who now returned as\r\na man with a moustache, was especially strange to me, who never can\r\nrecollect any face—unless indeed it be that of a pretty woman!\r\n\r\nWalter Scott was a great friend of my family and frequently came to\r\nAthol Crescent. I have often sat on his knee and had stories told\r\nme by him. I also accompanied my father to Abbotsford and spent\r\nsome days there, and I remember that on our arrival Walter Scott,\r\nfollowed by his sleugh-hound ‘Maida,’ came out to welcome us,\r\nand, taking my father by the arm, he turned round to ‘Maida’\r\nand said, ‘Do you take care of Johnny and let him have a ride on\r\nyour back if he likes.’ ‘Maida’ and I became great friends,\r\nand she allowed me to get on her back; for I was a very slight boy.\r\n\r\nWhen in Edinburgh, Walter Scott for a time lived in Walker Street,\r\nleading out of Coates Crescent, opposite to our house. He called one\r\nday on my mother and said he was going away for a month and requested\r\nthat he should be allowed to send, at night, his writing-table, desk,\r\nand chair to her house, as he said his housekeeper complained bitterly\r\nthat she had no peace from the constant visits of travellers, asking\r\npermission to see the chair, &c., where he wrote his works. My mother\r\nconsented, and Walter Scott then added: ‘I shall put a notice on\r\nthe door of my house, “Walter Scott has left this house and his\r\nfurniture has been removed.”’\r\n\r\nA few days after the removal to Athol Crescent of the desk and other\r\narticles, there was an unceasing knocking and ringing of bells at\r\nour front door by travellers, begging to be admitted to see the\r\ndesk. My mother had to have it removed, and a notice, similar to\r\nthat suggested by Walter Scott, was placed on the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nMention is here omitted of an incident well remembered by his children\r\nas related by Sir John’s mother, Mrs. Hay. Some visitors who gained\r\nadmittance to her house removed surreptitiously her own worn quill\r\npen from Walter Scott’s desk, under the impression that it had\r\nbeen used and left there by him!\r\n\r\nAmong the memoranda left by Sir John are notes to the effect that\r\nwhen he entered Charterhouse, Thackeray had either just left or was\r\nabout to leave that school; but Havelock, Leech, and John Murray\r\nwere his schoolfellows, as also a young Sheridan, who was remembered\r\nby him chiefly on account of the readiness with which he would\r\nimprovise verses on any subject. This boy appears to have been of\r\nimprovident habits, and was generally in a state of impecuniosity,\r\nwhich debarred him from buying the dainties in which other boys\r\nindulged. His schoolfellows would offer to share their tarts, &c.,\r\nwith him if he would make verses in reference to them—to which he\r\nwould instantly respond with apt rhymes.\r\n\r\nDuring their early school life at Charterhouse the brothers\r\nspent their holidays with either of their two grandfathers, the\r\none being the Rector of Hadleigh, Dean Drummond (youngest son\r\nof the Archbishop of York of that day, and brother of the ninth\r\nEarl of Kinnoull), through whom lay Sir John’s claim to French\r\nextraction, as the Dean’s wife was a daughter of the Prince de\r\nVismes et de Ponthieu. Captain J. Thomson was their other and maternal\r\ngrandfather. A very learned linguist, he had been private secretary\r\nto the Marquess of Hastings in India, spoke twenty-five languages,\r\nand was author of _Etymons of the English Language_, which work was\r\ncompleted after his death by his son-in-law, Mr. E. A. Drummond Hay,\r\nfather of the subject of the present memoir.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas-time, however, the two boys returned to their parents\r\nin Edinburgh, a long, wearisome journey from London, travelling by\r\ncoach through two days and nights in bitterly cold weather. The\r\nreturn journey to school, in particular, seems to have left a\r\ndesolate remembrance of arriving in London, cold and stiff after long\r\nconfinement in the crowded coach, but also a pleasant recollection\r\nof the gruff kindness to the young travellers of the guards, who\r\nwould often forego their customary tip when changing, rather than\r\ndisturb from their sleep the schoolboys who were going from home.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Dean Drummond, and the appointment of their father\r\nto a foreign post in 1829, the brothers were wont to spend a portion\r\nof their holidays at Dupplin Castle with the Earl of Kinnoull, to\r\nwhom they were then prospective heirs: the elder to the earldom,\r\nthe younger to the property of Cromlix. In fact, Lord Kinnoull\r\nasked their father to allow him to have entire charge of the two\r\nboys and of their education, in view of their being his probable\r\nsuccessors. But this offer was prudently declined, their father\r\nnot wishing them—the sons of a poor man—to be brought up amidst\r\nsurroundings unsuited to adapt them for pushing their own way in life,\r\nand in the expectation of a prosperous future which, in their case,\r\nmight fail to be realised. In this he judged wisely; as, while still\r\nin the prime of life, Lord Kinnoull married and had a large family.\r\n\r\nThe boys, however, continued to spend many happy holidays at Dupplin;\r\nposting from Edinburgh to Perth, a pleasanter mode of travelling\r\nthan by coach.\r\n\r\nAnother recollection, in connection with their visits to Dupplin,\r\nwas the ceremonious importance of their attendance at the parish\r\nchurch at Aberdalgie on Sundays. Though only a short distance\r\nintervened between this place and the Castle, the family coach,\r\nwith four horses and postilions, was always prepared, and in this\r\nmanner the two schoolboys proceeded alone to the church, to occupy\r\non arrival the family ‘sitting,’ and listen, with what patience\r\nthey might, to the long discourse of the minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1829 my father was appointed Political Agent and Consul\r\nGeneral in Morocco. At that time I was at Charterhouse, and first\r\nreceived the tidings from another boy who had seen the notice\r\nin the _Gazette_. Geography was not taught at Charterhouse, and,\r\nas my informant professed ignorance regarding the whereabouts of\r\nMorocco, beyond that ‘it was a country in Africa inhabited by\r\nnaked niggers,’ we got hold of a map and made therein a voyage of\r\ndiscovery until we found Morocco.\r\n\r\nMy family came up to London from Edinburgh and rented a house in\r\nClarges Street for the season, and my father decided that my elder\r\nbrother, the late Sir Edward Hay, and I should remain at Charterhouse\r\ntwo or three years longer; then rejoin our family at Tangier, and\r\nthere be placed under a private tutor.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious coincidence that before my father was appointed to\r\nMorocco, or had indeed any expectation of obtaining any employment\r\nin a foreign country, the boys at Charterhouse had nicknamed me\r\n‘Othello,’ or ‘the Moor,’ not only because I was a passionate\r\nyoungster who resented an injury, but also on account of my dark eyes\r\nand hair and olive complexion; typical of a thorough Hay, according\r\nto Sir Walter Scott in _The Fair Maid of Perth_, where he describes\r\nthe clan as ‘a dark, short race.’\r\n\r\nA frigate, H.M.S. Athol, in command of Captain Gordon, conveyed my\r\nfather and family to Tangier.\r\n\r\nThree years later [1832], when I was fifteen, my brother and I, to\r\nour great joy, were summoned to join them. Steam communication was\r\nvery rare in those days, and we sailed from Plymouth in a merchant\r\nbrig of about a hundred and fifty tons, with only a skipper and four\r\nseamen on board. She was a clipper and made the run in seven days.\r\n\r\nIt was a rough life on board the brig: hard sea-biscuit, salt pork,\r\nwith now and then currant dumplings, was the fare.\r\n\r\nNothing particular occurred during the voyage, except that after\r\nrounding Cape St. Vincent, when off the Spanish coast, a large lateen\r\ncraft—called a ‘mistico’—gave chase, making signals to the\r\nbrig to heave to: but our skipper, who declared the ‘mistico’\r\nto be a pirate, responded to the signals by hoisting every stitch\r\nof canvas—though a strong breeze was blowing—and we flew through\r\nthe water, leaving the ‘mistico’ far behind, and she gave up the\r\nchase after firing shots which missed us. Probably she was a Spanish\r\nrevenue vessel and her commander had mistaken us for a smuggler.\r\n\r\nThere was a six-horned Barbary ram on board, which the skipper had\r\nnot been allowed by the Customs’ officers to land in England,\r\nfor fear, I suppose, of its contaminating the British breed of\r\nsheep. No provision of fodder had been made for the poor animal,\r\nbut, as he had become a great favourite with the sailors, he was not\r\nmade mutton of, and lived on a pittance of hard biscuit, which the\r\nsailors gave him from their rations. The poor ram was so ravenous\r\nthat I mischievously offered him one day a slice of cold mutton\r\nbetween two pieces of biscuit, and this he devoured with avidity!\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Tangier, my brother and I were placed under the\r\ntuition of a Spanish gentleman, Don Gregorio de Borgas y Tarius,\r\nwhose father had been Captain-General in Estramadura; but, during the\r\nreign of Ferdinand, having taken part in some ‘pronunciamiento’\r\nagainst the despotic acts of that sovereign, he was compelled to\r\nfly from Spain. His property was confiscated, and he and his son\r\ngained their livelihood by giving lessons. Don Gregorio was a learned\r\nman—not only a classical scholar, but a good mathematician, and\r\nspoke French perfectly.\r\n\r\nDuring the five years I had spent at Charterhouse I had studied\r\nlittle or nothing except football, cricket, tennis, and other games;\r\nin these I took the lead of others of my age. What I knew of Latin\r\nor Greek had been acquired by me when a day-boarder at the Edinburgh\r\nAcademy—a far superior school at that time to Charterhouse for\r\neducation, as idle boys were there made to study: but even at\r\nthe Academy, geography and modern history were not taught. I had\r\nlearnt the history of the gods and goddesses, and knew much about\r\nthe doings of Jupiter, Juno, Hercules, Venus, &c., but was left in\r\ntotal ignorance of English history, except what my mother taught me,\r\nwhile knowing little or nothing of the history of Europe, or even\r\nof the recent great war with Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAfter we had spent two years in Tangier, my elder brother was\r\nappointed a clerk in the Colonial Office, through the influence of\r\nour relative, Mr. Robert Hay, then Under-Secretary for the Colonies;\r\nso I was left alone under the tuition of Don Gregorio, but made\r\nlittle progress, except in the French and Spanish languages, which\r\nI acquired with as much ease as I had experienced difficulty in\r\nmastering the classics.\r\n\r\n\r\n          LETTER FROM MISS SHIRREFF TO SIR JOHN’S DAUGHTERS.\r\n\r\n                           41 Stanhope Gardens, S.W., _Jan. 31_, 1895.\r\n\r\nYou have asked me, my dear friends, to tell you something of\r\nour recollections and impressions of your father’s early home;\r\nnot that of his childhood, but of his early youth—that in which\r\nhis character was formed and the bent and purpose of his manhood\r\nreceived its definite direction. It is but little that I can tell;\r\nbut as I am one of the few survivors of those who had the privilege\r\nof knowing that home in those early days I will do what I can.\r\n\r\nIt was my father’s appointment late in 1830 to the post of Captain\r\nof the Port at Gibraltar that first brought us into contact with\r\nthe Hay family. Not long after our arrival Mr. Drummond Hay came\r\nover to see us and claim my mother as his cousin, though till then\r\npersonally unknown; and his kindness and delightful conversation\r\nand old-world courtesy had made an easy conquest of us all. The\r\ninvitation that followed for Minnie[2] and myself to pay a visit\r\nto Tangier was therefore at once accepted with great glee; though\r\ncircumstances—a deep family sorrow, illness, and my father’s\r\nabsence in England—delayed it till the spring of ’33. At last the\r\nmoment came. My father took us over, and we were left among strangers\r\nwho were to become the dearest friends of all our after lives.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drummond Hay’s kind motherly greeting to her two young guests\r\nsoon set us at ease. Mr. Hay delighted us again as at first, and we\r\nthen were at leisure to make acquaintance with the younger members\r\nof the family; first Louisa[3], the eldest daughter, a year older\r\nthan myself; then your father, at that time a lad between sixteen\r\nand seventeen.\r\n\r\nYour father, who had but lately left Charterhouse and come to live\r\nat home, was at this time engaged with the study of Arabic, more\r\nrare then than now, and which was carried on more or less secretly\r\nowing to native jealousies. He was thus not only preparing for work,\r\nbut was also laying in great measure the foundation of that immense\r\ninfluence and popularity among the Moorish population, for which he\r\nwas so remarkable in after years.\r\n\r\nWhen the busy mornings were over, riding and music were the two\r\ndelights that drew the young party together. Under Mr. Hay’s\r\nguidance, and with the escort of a Moorish soldier, still at that\r\ntime necessary for protection, many were the delightful rides that\r\nwe took beyond the precincts of the old town, along the shore, or\r\nthrough the half-wild country, so new in all its aspects to our eyes.\r\n\r\nThen on our return, and often far into the evening hours, the long\r\nbalcony, or gallery as it was called, outside the drawing-room windows\r\nwas our favourite resort. Here we eat fruit, and talked over our ride,\r\nand here guitars were brought out, and song and merry talk went on.\r\n\r\nThe garden, full of flowers and lovely shrubs, lay below us; in the\r\ndistance stretched the rugged coast of Spain; Gibraltar reared aloft\r\nits rocky summit, whence the flash of the evening gun might be seen;\r\nwhile the golden glory of the Western skies lighted up the narrow sea\r\nbetween, alive with fishing craft, or some stately vessel passing\r\nthrough the straits. Truly it was a lovely view, and once enjoyed\r\ncould never fade from one’s memory. That enjoyment was only changed\r\nfor the pleasant circle at dinner, or in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the fact of our close intimacy with dear Mrs. Hay\r\nthrough the long years of her many changes and trials that makes\r\nthe recollection of the first impressions of her less vivid; yet\r\nher gracious beauty, her gentle, pleasant ways in the midst of the\r\ncares of such a household, can never be forgotten. But Mr. Hay was\r\nhimself emphatically the centre and ruler of the family life—a\r\nstern ruler at times to his children, but they revered the will which\r\nthey were bound to obey, and loved the father. Louisa’s congenial\r\nspirit, her sympathy in his literary tastes, made her naturally his\r\ncompanion, young as she was, and as secretary—no such person was\r\nthen officially recognised—she was invaluable.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, as I have striven partly to describe it, was the home\r\nin which John Hay was gradually developing the qualities that were\r\nmost remarkable in him through later years—courage, resolution,\r\nsense of duty, power of work and willingness to work, warm and wide\r\nsympathies, overflowing fun, and readiness to give help, no matter\r\nin what direction: if the thing wanted were in his power to do it\r\nwas done, from mastering an unruly horse to teaching algebra to a\r\nbackward student.\r\n\r\nThe outside surroundings of the home had also their influence. Society\r\nin Tangier was necessarily restricted, but within the small circle\r\nof different nationalities the social tone of various countries\r\nbecame familiar, and then the intercourse tended to dissipate\r\nnational prejudices, and to lead the young to wider sympathies\r\nthan generally prevail where all are more or less under the sway\r\nof the same habits and associations. This was naturally favourable\r\nto one who was destined to the diplomatic service, as was also the\r\nnecessary use of at least two foreign languages—French for society,\r\nand Spanish, partly for the same, but also as the medium of common\r\nintercourse with all the non-Arabic surroundings.\r\n\r\nWith reference to your dear father especially I may truly say that\r\nwhenever we met him in after years we felt that we were meeting\r\nthe same valued friend of our youth, and again our thoughts turned\r\nto the dear old home where, under a noble father’s guidance,\r\nhe was trained to all manly excellence, and where he had learned\r\nto form his ideal of womanhood under the influence of the loving,\r\nunselfish mother, and the sister whose bright intellect added force\r\nto the pure beauty of her character, and made her worthy to be his\r\ntrusted friend and confidant to the last hours of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n               WAITING FOR EMPLOYMENT—JOSÉ MARIA. 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1834, I travelled through Andalusia with my tutor, and visited,\r\namongst other towns, Seville, where I had been requested by my father\r\nto rent a furnished house for three months, as he had obtained leave\r\nof absence and intended to spend it there with his family. Mr. Ford,\r\nthe author of the _Handbook on Spain_, and father of Sir Francis Clare\r\nFord, afterwards Ambassador at Madrid, then resided at Seville; and,\r\nas he was about to leave, I hired his house.\r\n\r\nFord had made the acquaintance of José Maria, the famous\r\nbrigand—the ‘Little John’ of Spain—who had been pardoned by\r\nthe Queen on condition of his acting as chief of a body of ‘guardia\r\ncivil’ and devoting himself to suppressing brigandage. He asked me\r\nif I would like to see this notorious ex-robber and hear, from his\r\nown lips, anecdotes of his life as a brigand. I readily assented,\r\nso José Maria was invited to a luncheon at which I was present.\r\n\r\nJosé Maria told us that all the robbers and thieves in the Southern\r\nprovinces of Spain had been for some years under his control—he\r\ncould collect when required a body of about forty well-mounted and\r\narmed men—and related how his pardon and present appointment had\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nHearing that Queen Christina, attended by an escort of cavalry,\r\nwas about to pass, on her return to Madrid from a visit to Granada,\r\nthrough a wooded country known to be infested by banditti, José\r\nMaria collected his well-mounted brigands, armed and dressed in\r\nhandsome ‘majo’ costume, and placed them at the entrance of the\r\nforest through which Her Majesty would pass.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of the royal cortège, José Maria, observing a\r\ntrooper posted as vedette in advance of Her Majesty’s escort,\r\naccosted the man and informed him that, as a loyal subject of the\r\nQueen, he had brought a body of well-armed and mounted inhabitants of\r\nthe neighbourhood to escort Her Majesty through the woods in safety.\r\n\r\nThe trooper rode back and reported this language to the officer in\r\ncommand of the escort, adding that he suspected from the appearance\r\nof their chief that the men were banditti.\r\n\r\nThis was repeated to the Queen by the officer, who also informed\r\nHer Majesty that he was prepared to attack the supposed banditti.\r\n\r\nQueen Christina, however, ordered him not to attack, but, after\r\ntaking the necessary precautions against treachery, to bring the\r\nchief of the band to her carriage.\r\n\r\nJosé Maria, at the request of the officer, then came forward. The\r\nQueen thanked him for his loyalty in having assembled a body of\r\nmounted men to ensure her safety in a district said to be infested\r\nby brigands. ‘Place your men,’ said Her Majesty, ‘in front of\r\nthe escort, and then come yourself to the one side of my carriage,\r\nwhilst the officer in command of the cavalry rides on the other.’\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the forest, José Maria asked permission to retire\r\nwith his mounted followers, and at the same time announced that he\r\nhad a boon to beg.\r\n\r\n‘What is it?’ said Her Majesty. ‘I shall be glad to make my\r\nacknowledgement of the service you have rendered.’\r\n\r\nBowing low, he answered, ‘I am José Maria, the chief of the\r\nbanditti who infest your realms. I ask for pardon for myself and for\r\nthose of my followers who may be ready to accept it: for those who\r\ndo not accept, as they have accompanied me on the present occasion\r\nwithout knowledge of my intended petition, I beg that they be allowed\r\nto depart without hindrance.’\r\n\r\nThe Queen, after conferring with the officer in command, granted José\r\nMaria’s prayer, on condition, however, that he should become a chief\r\nof the ‘guardia civil’ and assist in putting down brigandage.\r\n\r\nAll the brigands accepted Her Majesty’s pardon, with the exception\r\nof a man nicknamed ‘Veneno’ (poison), who had been José Maria’s\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\nJosé Maria related to us stories of the most daring robberies\r\nhe had committed, in various parts of Spain, on passengers by\r\ndiligence and other travellers. He declared that his band had never\r\nrobbed or molested the farmers or peasantry; but, on the contrary,\r\nwhen they heard that a wedding or other feast was taking place,\r\nhe would appear with some of his men in smart ‘majo’ costume\r\nand bring presents for the bridegroom and bride. Also that the\r\nAlcaldes, or petty magistrates of the villages, were all bribed by\r\nhim when a robbery was committed in other districts than their own;\r\nand when cavalry were sent in pursuit of the banditti, the country\r\npeople never betrayed them, but kept José Maria informed of their\r\nmovements whilst they misled his pursuers.\r\n\r\nThe brigand told us that on one occasion he had robbed an English\r\ngentleman travelling in Andalusia on horseback, with a Spanish guide,\r\nof their horses and everything they possessed except the clothes they\r\nwore. ‘The Englishman,’ he added, ‘was a bright, pleasant youth,\r\nand submitted with good humour to the robbery; so I felt sorry, as\r\nhe was forty miles from Seville, whither he was going, that he should\r\nhave to walk that distance, and I gave him back his servant’s horse\r\nand a doubloon (sixteen dollars) out of the two hundred dollars I\r\nhad taken from him, mentioning that he might require that money for\r\nlodging and food on the road before he had reached his destination.’\r\n\r\n‘My young friend,’ José continued, ‘thanked me warmly,\r\nadding that since I had been so kind he had a great favour to ask,\r\nwhich was that I should return him his gold watch as it had been\r\nthe parting gift of his dear father.’\r\n\r\n‘Is your father alive, and does he love you very much?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, yes,’ replied the youth, ‘he lives and loves me.’\r\n\r\n‘Then,’ said José Maria, ‘I shall keep this watch, and as\r\nyour father loves you so dearly he is sure to give you another!’\r\n\r\nJosé then gave the young Englishman a signed pass, requiring that\r\nall brigands or thieves in Andalusia or Estramadura should refrain\r\nfrom robbing or molesting the bearer. He also told him, if robbed\r\nat any time, where to send a note which would be sure to find him.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman spent some weeks at Seville, and, returning one evening\r\nfrom Alcalá, was attacked and robbed by a man armed with a gun. He\r\nshowed the pass to the footpad, who only remarked that he was not\r\ngoing to have the bread taken out of his mouth by the brigand José\r\nMaria or any other man.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman then had a note written in Spanish and sent to the\r\ncare of the head man of a village mentioned by José Maria, to be\r\nforwarded to the great brigand, stating the sum of money that had\r\nbeen stolen from him. Within a week a Spaniard called at the hotel\r\nwhere the traveller lodged and returned the money, adding, ‘The\r\n“ratero” (thief) has been stabbed for paying no attention to\r\nJosé Maria’s pass.’\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, José Maria had his horse brought for us to see. It\r\nwas a well-made Spanish ‘jinete,’ standing about 15.1, and had\r\nthe appearance of being fast. He mounted the nag and rode rapidly up\r\na street, presently returned at a gallop, jumped off, and, removing\r\nthe bridle, gave the animal a slap and then ran into the house. The\r\nhorse went off at full gallop and disappeared up one of the streets.\r\n\r\n‘Now,’ said José Maria, ‘I am supposed to have committed\r\na robbery and to have been pursued by cavalry in a wood. I have\r\ntaken off the bridle, and my horse, if chased, will be sure from his\r\nswiftness and being riderless, to escape. Suppose me to have climbed a\r\ntree or hidden amongst bushes or rocks and thus eluded my enemies.’\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval he continued, ‘I must now recall the horse,\r\nwho, not being pursued, will not have gone far and is listening for\r\nmy summons.’ So, taking a large whistle from his pocket, he walked\r\nup the street and commenced whistling. In a few minutes the horse\r\ngalloped up, neighing as he recognised his master, who put on the\r\nbridle and caressed the intelligent beast.\r\n\r\n‘For two years I have been employed,’ said José Maria, ‘in\r\nputting down brigandage, and have succeeded in arresting many robbers\r\nand “rateros,” but my late lieutenant “Veneno” has hitherto\r\nescaped us, and some day he will kill me!’\r\n\r\nA year after my meeting with José Maria, I saw in the newspapers\r\nthat ‘Veneno’ had been tracked by him to a cave in the mountains,\r\nfrequented by this robber and his band. The ex-brigand entered the\r\ncave one night at the head of a body of ‘guardia civil’ and was\r\nkilled by ‘Veneno’ while in the act of arresting him. ‘Veneno’\r\nand his companions were then shot by José Maria’s men.\r\n\r\nWhilst residing with my father and family in the house he had rented\r\nin Seville, it happened on one occasion that I had dined and spent\r\nthe evening with my friend Don ———, and did not leave his house\r\nuntil nearly eleven o’clock. It was fortunately bright moonlight,\r\nfor Seville was then but dimly lighted. On saying good-night, my\r\nhost accompanied me to his door and warned me to keep well in the\r\ncentre of the streets, as at that late hour wayfarers were often\r\nattacked and robbed.\r\n\r\nI had no weapon—not even a stick—with me. The evening was fresh,\r\nso I threw my Spanish ‘capa’ round me and walked briskly down\r\nthe centre of the narrow streets which led to the great Plaza,\r\nabout a mile distant, near which our house was situated. Presently\r\nI heard footsteps and, looking back, saw a figure following me,\r\nbut keeping in the shadow.\r\n\r\nI knew I was fleet of foot, so set off running at a good pace, feeling\r\nsure that if the fellow were dodging me he would follow. As soon as I\r\nquickened my speed the man sprang into the light and came after me,\r\nand I dashed on with him in pursuit. As I turned a corner I caught\r\nsight of his long ‘navaja’ gleaming in the moonlight. Finding my\r\ncloak heavy, I unfastened it and let it trail behind, determined to\r\nhold on to my new capa as long as I could. However, I soon outstripped\r\nmy pursuer, and on reaching the Plaza paused to again wrap my capa\r\nabout me and to reconnoitre well before venturing into the street\r\nwhere our house stood. The footpad had vanished on seeing me reach\r\nthe lit and frequented Plaza.\r\n\r\nAfter this I never ventured out at night without a pistol.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Hay had become very proficient in Arabic, and\r\nhis family have still in their possession some examples of Arabic\r\nwriting, then beautifully executed by him in the highest style of\r\nOriental manuscript; and a friend, writing from London to his mother,\r\nMrs. Drummond Hay, says, ‘I met the other evening Mr. Burchardt\r\nBarker, the Oriental translator to the Foreign Office; he told me that\r\na letter from the Sultan of Morocco had been sent home by your son,\r\nMr. John Hay, and that he had never seen anything more beautifully\r\ntranslated by any Orientalist.’\r\n\r\nIt was either during this stay at Seville, or on a subsequent\r\noccasion, that Mr. Hay visited the Alcazar, then in course of\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\nThe architect was employed in reconstructing the beautiful arabesque\r\nstucco-work on the walls, by taking moulds of the injured portions,\r\nand, after remodelling the defaced parts, casting from these moulds\r\nfresh plaques to replace those injured or missing.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing for some time on these restorations, and vainly\r\nendeavouring to puzzle out the Arabic inscriptions which enter so\r\nlargely into arabesque decorations, Mr. Hay asked for the architect\r\nand inquired of him whether he was aware that he had reversed all\r\nthe inscriptions!\r\n\r\nThe poor man was horrified. He declared he would undo and rectify his\r\nwork, begging Mr. Hay, for pity’s sake, not to betray to any one\r\nhis discovery: as, if it were made known, he would be a ruined man,\r\nand he and his children would starve. Mr. Hay having shown him exactly\r\nwhat his error had been, left Seville without betraying the architect.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1838 Mr. Hay made an expedition into the interior of\r\nMorocco, of which he wrote an account entitled _Western Barbary_. This\r\nlittle book, written with all the vigour and freshness inspired by\r\nyouth, and with a thorough knowledge of the wild people amongst whom\r\nhe travelled and whose sport he shared, was published by Mr. Murray\r\nand attracted much attention and praise from the press at the time.\r\n\r\nDuring a visit to England in 1838, Mr. Hay made an application to\r\nLord Palmerston for a diplomatic appointment in the East, and in this\r\nconnection relates the following incident, which occurred after his\r\nreturn to Tangier in the next year.\r\n\r\n\r\nA respectable Moor, named Selam Lamarti, who was employed by my\r\nfather to attend as guard upon my younger brothers and sisters,\r\nand who was very anxious about my future career, inquired one day\r\nwhether I should like to have my fortune told by one who had never\r\nfailed to predict correctly the life and fortune of any man or woman\r\nwhom she might have happened to see, and the chief events of whose\r\nfuture life she felt intuitively that she could foretell. I replied,\r\n‘As you say _she_, you refer, I suppose, to a woman, and probably\r\nto an Arab gossip, who expects that I shall reward her handsomely\r\nfor telling me a parcel of lies about the happiness and good fortune\r\nwhich are in store for me.’\r\n\r\n‘No,’ he said, ‘she is not an Arab gipsy, but my first cousin,\r\na young Moorish maiden named Leila, with whom I have been brought up\r\nfrom infancy as with a sister. If she tells your fortune she will not\r\ntake money, nor even a present, in return for her predictions. The\r\nMost High God, who foresees and knows all things, has gifted her with\r\nthis incomprehensible power, for which she has attained great fame;\r\nbut it is not every one whose fortune can be told by her, only those\r\nwhom she occasionally selects, from feeling—as she describes—a\r\nsudden innate inspiration which she cannot explain. Last Friday,’ he\r\ncontinued, ‘she and her mother were seated, muffled in their haiks,\r\npraying at the grave of a relative in the Mohammedan cemetery. You,\r\nwhom she knows by sight, were walking with a companion on the high\r\nroad through the cemetery, and you stopped for some minutes near\r\nto the spot where Leila was seated, and she had a good view of your\r\nfeatures. After you had passed Leila told her mother, and afterwards\r\nmyself on her return home, that your future life was seen by her\r\nclearly, as in a mirror.’\r\n\r\n‘Is she fair? Is she pretty? Can I hear from her own lips my\r\nfuture?’ I exclaimed, foolishly flattering myself that this maiden\r\nmight have fallen in love with me and sought an excuse for a meeting.\r\n\r\n‘Hasha’ (God forbid), cried Selam, ‘that you or any man should\r\nvisit, or even speak to her, until she meet her bridegroom on her\r\nwedding night, except it be her father, or I as her foster-brother,\r\nin the presence of her mother. Yes, she is very fair and pretty,\r\nwith a sweet gentle voice and manner. If you wish to learn the chief\r\nevents of your future life, Leila says she must see you again and\r\nhave a long look at your features and expression. I will arrange\r\nto-night the hour when you are to accompany me to stand below the\r\nlattice window of her house, where she will be able to gaze at you,\r\nthough, as you know, her features will not thus be visible to you.’\r\n\r\nThis was agreed upon, and the next day Selam accompanied me to the\r\ndoor of Leila’s house, where, leaving me standing in the street,\r\nhe entered, but shortly rejoined me, saying, ‘She is now at the\r\nwindow.’ I could just see there was some one behind the lattice,\r\nso I looked up and smiled, hoping she might show herself; but not a\r\nglimpse had I of the fair Leila. After waiting a few minutes there\r\nwas a tap at the window, and Selam said,\r\n\r\n‘That is the signal that you may leave. To-night I shall learn\r\nfrom Leila, in presence of her mother, the chief events of your\r\nfuture life. She is a clever girl, and, what is rare with our women,\r\ncan read and write Arabic.’\r\n\r\nThe following day Selam related Leila’s predictions as follows:\r\n\r\n‘John, whom I have so often seen as he passes through the cemetery\r\non Fridays, will in a few months return to London, and will be\r\nappointed “Katseb” (secretary) to the English “Bashador”\r\n(ambassador) at Stambul; he will rise in favour and become his\r\nconfidential secretary. He will be sent by the Bashador on missions\r\nto several countries in the East and return to Stambul. After a few\r\nyears he will go back to England, and then on his intended return to\r\nStambul he will visit Tangier, where he will find his father in bad\r\nhealth. His father will die and he will be appointed in his place. He\r\nwill be in great favour with the present and future Sultans, and\r\nwill attain to a much higher rank than his father now holds. There\r\nare two maidens who will love him—one dark, the other fair. He will\r\nmarry the fair one, who lives in a distant land. He will have a long\r\nand happy life, and when he is old he will retire to his own country\r\nwith high honours from his sovereign and from other sovereigns of\r\nforeign countries. He will live to an advanced age.’\r\n\r\nLeila declined an offer of money or a present, and I was never allowed\r\nto see her fair face or hear her sweet voice. Without narrating\r\nhere the various events which have happened in my long life I may\r\nsay that Leila’s predictions, by an extraordinary combination of\r\ncircumstances or chances, have all been verified. Though I never\r\nhad an opportunity of letting Leila know that I had fulfilled her\r\nexpectations, I hope she may have continued to take an interest in\r\nmy career, whether she be in this or in the other world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                           ALEXANDRIA. 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hay did not long remain without employment. In his Note Book for\r\n1840 he thus describes his entrance on the career of a diplomatist.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting with some anxiety to learn what might turn up and be my fate,\r\nI stayed for some months in Town, and in May, as I was walking down\r\nSt. James’ Street towards the Foreign Office, I met Henry Forster,\r\nbrother of the late General Forster, then a senior clerk in the\r\nForeign Office, who said, ‘Hay, I have to congratulate you, for\r\nyou have just been marked with our chief’s initial letter.’\r\n\r\nOn my asking for an explanation, Forster informed me that my name had\r\nbeen sent up by my kind friend Mr. Hammond (the late Lord Hammond,\r\nthen Senior Clerk) for the post of attaché at Constantinople,\r\nand that Lord Palmerston, as usual when he approved a note or a\r\nmemorandum, had signed P. Before I received this appointment, Lord\r\nPalmerston’s private secretary asked me whether I was a Whig or a\r\nTory, adding that his Lordship had directed him to question me, as\r\nhe had appointed so many members of Tory families to foreign posts\r\nthat it was his intention in future before making an appointment to\r\ninquire of a candidate to which party he belonged.\r\n\r\nI replied that, as I hoped to obtain employment abroad, where it\r\nwould not be necessary for me to take part in politics as Whig or\r\nTory, my party would always be that which upheld the honour and\r\ninterests of my own country.\r\n\r\nI was told that, when my reply was reported to Lord Palmerston,\r\nhe said, ‘Mr. Hay may be a Tory, but he will do for diplomacy.’\r\n\r\nOn my appointment I was directed, before proceeding to my post,\r\nto attend for some weeks at the Foreign Office to learn the forms, &c.\r\n\r\nBefore the present Foreign Office was built there was, at the back\r\nof the old buildings, a street, the houses on the opposite side of\r\nwhich were overlooked by the rooms occupied by some of the junior\r\nclerks. In a window of one of these houses two elderly ladies used\r\nsometimes to be seated, sewing, and a youthful clerk was wont to amuse\r\nhimself dazzling them by means of a looking-glass. The ladies wrote\r\na note to Lord Palmerston, complaining of this annoyance; upon which\r\nhis Lordship sent a memorandum to be circulated amongst the clerks:\r\n\r\n‘The gentlemen in the office are requested not to cast reflections\r\non ladies. P.’\r\n\r\nAfter working for some weeks as an assistant clerk in the Foreign\r\nOffice I was ordered to proceed, in the first place, to Alexandria,\r\nwhere I was to remain for some time to assist Colonel Hodges, then our\r\nAgent and Consul-General in Egypt—as there was a press of work in\r\nconsequence of the question with Mehemet Ali—and was told that Lord\r\nPalmerston desired to know when I should be ready to start. I replied,\r\n‘To-day.’ This pleased Lord Palmerston, but I was given three days\r\nin which to prepare, and told that, if I had not a carriage of my own,\r\nI was to buy one at Calais and post with all speed through France to\r\nMarseilles in order to catch the mail-packet thence to Alexandria. At\r\nthe Foreign Office I was given £100 to pay all expenses.\r\n\r\nPosting down to Dover, I crossed to Calais, and there bought,\r\nsecond-hand, a light _britzska_, in which I deposited the two huge\r\nbags of dispatches, of which I was in charge for the admiral at Malta\r\nand our agent in Egypt. As bearer of dispatches I had the preference\r\nover other travellers for fresh horses, and travelled very rapidly,\r\nday and night, arriving at Marseilles several hours before the\r\npacket left. After selling the carriage I had bought at Calais,\r\nI took a bath and had dinner at an hotel.\r\n\r\nDuring dinner, I was waited on by two Maltese. Having finished,\r\nI requested that my bill should be brought; upon which, one of the\r\nwaiters observed to the other _sotto voce_ in Arabic, ‘We will\r\nnot present a bill; let us charge him fifteen francs, and we will\r\ndivide the five which remain over and above the charge for bath\r\nand dinner.’ Knowing Arabic, I understood the plot; so when they\r\ntold me I had fifteen francs to pay, I replied that I wished to see\r\nthe landlord before leaving. He was summoned and I then related to\r\nhim what had passed between these rogues of waiters. Upon which he\r\ndemanded very angrily what they meant, and one of them, very much\r\nflurried, replied foolishly that they had not supposed the gentleman\r\nknew Maltese! The landlord dismissed the two waiters from his service\r\nthen and there, and I paid him his bill of ten francs.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that though Malta has been occupied by a great number\r\nof nations—Phœnicians, Romans, Arabs, Franks and English—Arabic\r\nis still the language of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBefore arriving at Alexandria, I learnt that the plague was in Egypt,\r\nand, having heard so many dread stories about this disease and the\r\ndangers incurred from contagion, I landed with my hair standing on\r\nend from terror, fearing I should be plague-stricken and die—as\r\nI had heard might happen—after a few hours’ illness.\r\n\r\nThere was much contention at that time between medical men at\r\nAlexandria regarding the contagion from plague. The chief Italian\r\ndoctor—whose name I have forgotten—who was said to be very\r\nclever, mounted a donkey covered with oil-skin, the doctor wearing\r\nalso clothing of a supposed non-contagion-bearing texture. He visited\r\nthe plague patients, but carried an ivory wand with which he touched\r\ntheir ‘buboes.’\r\n\r\nThe other chief medical man was Dr. Lorimer, an Englishman, who did\r\nnot believe in great danger from contagion but rather in the risk\r\nof infection from visiting, or living in, unhealthy quarters of the\r\ntown where there were no sanitary arrangements.\r\n\r\nThese two doctors were on friendly terms, and when they met in the\r\nstreets during their visits to plague patients, some banter generally\r\npassed. The Italian doctor was wont to salute Dr. Lorimer with ‘Tu\r\ncreparai’ (Thou wilt die), and the latter returned the gloomy\r\nsalutation with a ‘tu quoque.’ The Italian died of the plague\r\nwhilst I was at Alexandria, but Dr. Lorimer kept in good health and\r\nwas unremitting in his attendance on the sick, doing many acts of\r\ncharity. He told me, in support of his theory of infection rather than\r\ncontagion, that there were several houses in Alexandria of a better\r\nclass, but situated in an unhealthy part of the town, whose tenants,\r\neven when observing the strictest quarantine, had caught the plague,\r\nwhilst there were whole streets in a healthy quarter where no cases\r\never occurred.\r\n\r\nSome years before, in Morocco, I had experience of the danger of\r\ngoing into dwellings where there is disease.\r\n\r\nWhen the cholera morbus visited Tangier in 1836, Mr. Bell—at that\r\ntime Consul under my father, and who had been surgeon on board Lord\r\nYarborough’s yacht Falcon—devoted his spare time after office\r\nhours to attending, gratis, upon cholera patients and had much\r\nsuccess: I sometimes accompanied him to interpret when he could\r\nnot find an assistant who spoke Arabic, and on one occasion he\r\nrequested me to aid him in giving directions to a poor Moor whose\r\nson was attacked with cholera. I accompanied Dr. Bell without fear,\r\nbut when he requested me to lift the dying man, already looking like\r\na livid corpse, to enable him to pour some liquid down his throat,\r\nI shuddered, and, trembling, held the man in my arms till the dose\r\nwas administered. The patient died shortly after.\r\n\r\nI returned home feeling ill and shaken; and, whilst standing before\r\na fire trying to warm myself, was seized with terrible cramps and\r\nfell in pain on the hearth-rug. I was put to bed with bottles of\r\nhot water on my body. Dr. Bell was sent for, but was not to be\r\nfound. Having heard that sometimes oil relieved pain in cholera, I\r\ngot a bottle of good French oil and adding a few drops of laudanum\r\nto a full tumbler of oil, drank it off. This relieved the intense\r\npain. When the doctor arrived, he approved of my remedy and said I\r\nhad an attack of cholera asiatica.\r\n\r\nThe danger from plague by contagion cannot, however, to my mind be\r\ncalled in question. That dire disease was introduced into Morocco\r\nabout the year 1826 by an English frigate which our Government\r\nhad dispatched to Alexandria, where the plague was then raging, to\r\nconvey from that port to Tangier two sons of the Sultan, returning\r\nfrom a pilgrimage to Mecca. No case of plague or other illness had\r\noccurred on board the frigate during the voyage, and the Sultan’s\r\nsons and other passengers were allowed to land at Tangier.\r\n\r\nThe Customs’ officers being suspicious that in the numerous boxes,\r\nbrought by pilgrims who had been permitted to embark with the\r\nMoorish princes, contraband goods were being smuggled, caused some\r\nof the cases to be opened. One contained Egyptian wearing apparel,\r\nwhich the owner said he had bought second-hand, and subsequently\r\nconfessed had belonged to a person who had died of the plague at\r\nAlexandria. The two Moorish officials who opened the boxes were\r\nattacked with the plague that night and died in a few hours. The\r\ndisease spread rapidly throughout Morocco, carrying off eighty per\r\ncent. of those who were attacked.\r\n\r\nShortly after my arrival at Alexandria, I was presented to Mehemet Ali\r\nby Colonel Hodges. I need not give a description of this remarkable\r\nman, of whom so much has been written, but I was much struck by his\r\nkeen eyes, like those of an eagle. The Colonel proved to be no match\r\nfor him in discussing the grave questions then at issue regarding his\r\ndesire to be independent of the Sultan’s sway, whilst Mehemet Ali\r\nshowed markedly his personal dislike to the Irish colonel, who was\r\nhot-tempered and blurted out in very unguarded language the views\r\nentertained by the British Government at that time regarding Egypt.\r\n\r\nOn hearing that I was attached to the Embassy at Constantinople,\r\nMehemet Ali fixed on me his eagle eyes with no friendly expression,\r\nand I could perceive, from words let drop then and afterwards, the\r\nextreme hatred his Highness entertained towards any one connected\r\nwith our Ambassador, Lord Ponsonby, the persistent and successful\r\nopponent of his ambitious views.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a portion of the Mahmud Canal was being dug by the\r\nunfortunate Egyptian fellahin, assisted by their wives and children,\r\naccording to the ‘corvée’ system. Men, women and children\r\ndwelt in miserable hovels near the canal, and I have seen the\r\nwretched people working by thousands. A platter of bean soup and some\r\ncoarse bread was all that each person received to keep body and soul\r\ntogether. No pay was given—or if any were made, it was retained by\r\nthe overseers—and the greatest misery prevailed. I was told that\r\nthere were two young fellah girls, sisters, who possessed only one\r\ngarment between them; so whilst one worked the other remained in her\r\nhovel until her turn came, and then she donned the long blue shift\r\nand the weary one remained nude. Yet have I seen this joyous race,\r\nafter emptying the baskets of earth they carried, filled with mud\r\ngrubbed up by their hands, without aid of spade or other implement,\r\nsinging and clapping their hands as they returned to the canal,\r\nbalancing the empty baskets on their heads.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians have been bondsmen for thousands of years, and are a\r\ndegenerate and cowardly race.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when the younger son of Mehemet Ali, Abbas Pasha, a\r\ncruel tyrant, visited the canal, a wretched fellah, with hardly a rag\r\nto his back, walked to a mound of earth above where the Pasha stood\r\nand cried out to his fellow-workmen: ‘Slaves and cowards! There\r\nstands the tyrant. Strike and destroy him, or—if you have not the\r\ncourage to strike—spit, and you will drown him!’ This rash but\r\nbrave fellah was seized and beaten until he lay a corpse.\r\n\r\nTo give another instance of the cruelty of this monster, Abbas\r\nPasha. It was the custom in Egypt for any one of position to be\r\naccompanied, when on horseback, by a ‘sais,’ or footman, who ran\r\nbeside, or preceded, the rider; and it was astonishing how these\r\nmen could keep up for miles with a horse going at a fast amble or\r\ntrot. The ‘sais’ of Abbas Pasha, having run by the side of his\r\nmaster during a long journey, became footsore and, his shoes being\r\nworn out, begged that a new pair might be given him at the next\r\nvillage. The Pasha replied, ‘Thy petition shall be granted.’\r\nOn arrival at the village, Abbas Pasha ordered that a blacksmith\r\nshould be sent for, and when he came said, ‘Bind the sais, and\r\nnail on his feet two horse-shoes; see that they are red hot before\r\nthey are fastened on.’ This was done, and the tortured man was\r\nleft writhing in agony, whilst the Pasha returned to Alexandria.\r\n\r\nOne day, finding that I was not needed at the office, I went for a\r\nride. When I had gone about four miles beyond the town I met an Arab,\r\nmounted on a ‘huri,’ or dromedary, riding at a great pace towards\r\nAlexandria, his face muffled up, as is usual with these people. He\r\nstopped his animal as I passed, and, showing me a little object he\r\nhad in his hand, said, ‘I hear you Franks care about these things,\r\nand am going to Alexandria to find a purchaser.’\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be a very beautiful gem, apparently cut in agate,\r\nof the head of Bacchus. On my asking where he had found it, he told\r\nme in some ruins at a distant spot. I offered him a few piastres\r\nfor the gem: but he refused my offer, saying that he knew a similar\r\nobject found on the same site had been sold by a friend of his for\r\na sum equivalent in piastres to about £5.\r\n\r\nThough not myself a collector of antiquities, my father was an\r\narchaeologist, and possessed a beautiful collection of coins, &c.,\r\nand I decided on purchasing the gem as a gift to him: so, after\r\nsome wrangling, I became the owner on paying about £2. The Arab,\r\non receiving the money, turned back and rode off at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nBeing very anxious to learn whether my acquisition was one of\r\ngreat value, I returned to Alexandria and called on the Austrian\r\nConsul-General, Monsieur Laurin, a collector of gems and other\r\nantiquities, and a great connoisseur. On showing him the gem he\r\npronounced it to be a very beautiful work of art, and, if genuine,\r\nof great value and worth ten times what I had given; but said he\r\nreally could not say without putting it to a test whether or no it\r\nwere counterfeit. He informed me that imitations of all kinds of\r\nantiquities were imported from Italy and sold to travellers. When I\r\nrelated to him the incident of my meeting with the Arab, when riding\r\nout in the country, and the language and appearance of the man,\r\nhe said there were Europeans at Alexandria who sold these objects,\r\nwho were quite capable of hiring an Arab and his camel, and, on\r\nseeing that an English stranger was about to take a ride, sending\r\nhim to encounter the traveller, in the hope of getting a good price.\r\n\r\nWith my permission, Monsieur Laurin used a penknife to scratch the\r\nback of the gem, which he said was agate, but he still hesitated\r\nin declaring, though he used a magnifying glass, whether the head\r\nof Bacchus was also cut on the agate or was composition. He said\r\nthere was one way of solving the doubt, which would not injure a gem,\r\nbut that if it were a counterfeit it would disappear,—which was to\r\nplunge it into hot water. He added that the head was so beautifully\r\nexecuted, it deserved to be kept on its own merits and not to be put\r\nunder the test, as it would be greatly admired, he felt sure, by my\r\nfather. I insisted, however, on the test being applied, so hot water\r\nwas brought. Into this I dropped the gem, and in an instant Bacchus\r\ndisappeared and I found myself the possessor of a flat piece of agate.\r\n\r\nMy father, as I have said, was an archaeologist. When he lived\r\nin the neighbourhood of Valenciennes, in 1826, a French labourer\r\ndiscovered, in the neighbourhood of that town, a beautiful bronze\r\nstatue of Hercules, about eighteen inches high, and, hearing that\r\nmy father bought coins and other antiques, brought it to him. The\r\nstatue was then in a perfect state: the club was of silver, in the\r\nleft hand were apples of gold; the lion’s skin over the shoulder\r\nwas in silver, and in the eyes were two small rubies. My father made\r\nthe man an offer, which he refused.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards he brought back the statue in a mutilated\r\nstate—the club, apples, lion’s skin, and ruby eyes were gone,\r\nhaving been sold to a jeweller. My father gave the man 100 francs\r\nfor the statue, and this beautiful work of art became his idol;\r\nthough offered a large sum to part with it, he declined, and in\r\nhis will bequeathed it to the British Museum, where it can be seen\r\namongst other gems of ancient art. His collection of coins and\r\nother antiquities he left to the Museum of the Antiquarian Society\r\nin Edinburgh, of which he was for many years honorary secretary.\r\n\r\nDated June 27, 1840, Cairo, I find among my notes the following\r\nentry:—\r\n\r\n‘Heard a good story of the last of the Mamelukes, a fine old\r\nSaracen, one of the very few who escaped the massacre at Cairo.\r\n\r\n‘The old fellow had been invited to an evening party at the house\r\nof the former Consul-General, Colonel Campbell, where there was\r\nassembled a large party of ladies, to each individual of whom he\r\ndetermined, in his politeness, to address what he imagined to be\r\nthe most flattering remark possible. Thus he made the tour of the\r\nfair sex, saying to each, “I see you will soon make a child!”\r\naccompanying his words with an expressive gesture. Married and\r\nunmarried were greeted alike! and to a young widow, a flame of the\r\nColonel’s, notwithstanding her persistent denial and offended\r\ndignity, he repeatedly asseverated she would “make a child!”’\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                CONSTANTINOPLE AND LORD PONSONBY. 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Hodges had been hospitable and very kindly disposed towards\r\nme, but I hailed with pleasure the day when I embarked—in an\r\nAustrian steamer, in consequence of relations being broken off with\r\nMehemet Ali—to proceed to Beyrout and thence to Constantinople,\r\nto join the Embassy.\r\n\r\nAt Beyrout, where I spent a few hours, I went on board the flag-ship\r\nof Admiral Sir Charles Napier, where I heard it was decided to attack\r\nAcre, and that a battle was impending between the army of Ibrahim\r\nPasha, and the Turkish and British troops commanded by General Smith.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Constantinople, I presented myself to Lord Ponsonby,\r\nwho, after listening to the tidings I brought, directed me to address\r\nhim a dispatch reporting all I had related to his Excellency; adding,\r\nthat I must lose no time in preparing it, as he was about to dispatch\r\na messenger overland to England.\r\n\r\nNever having written a dispatch in my life, though I had\r\ncorresponded privately on passing events in Egypt with members\r\nof the Embassy at Constantinople and the Foreign Office, I felt\r\nvery nervous—especially as the report was required immediately by\r\nhis Excellency. Half-an-hour after my interview with Lord Ponsonby,\r\nwhile I was still writing, the late Percy Doyle, then first attaché,\r\ncame in with a message from the Ambassador to request that my report\r\nshould be brought to his Excellency at once. I said the draft was\r\nnot quite finished, and that I wished to copy it out.\r\n\r\nDoyle answered he must take it up at once to his Excellency, so,\r\nafter I had scribbled the few lines that remained, without allowing me\r\neven to read it over, he carried it off. I waited for some time for\r\nhis return and then, to my dismay, he announced that Lord Ponsonby\r\nhad read my draft, and, as there was no time to have it copied,\r\nhad enclosed it, as it was, in a dispatch to Lord Palmerston. It was\r\npublished in the Blue Book, with other dispatches on Eastern affairs.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year, when a victory had been gained over the Egyptian\r\narmy in Syria by the combined British and Turkish forces, that a\r\nnumber of trophies in flags, banners, &c., were sent by General Smith\r\nand Admiral Sir Charles Napier, who commanded the British forces,\r\nto the Ambassador to present to the Sultan.\r\n\r\nA day having been fixed for the audience, Lord Ponsonby prepared the\r\nspeech he proposed to deliver, and directed Mr. Frederick Pisani,\r\nChief Dragoman of the Embassy, to write out a translation into the\r\nTurkish language, and to learn it by heart. He was instructed not to\r\npay any attention to Lord Ponsonby’s utterances during the audience,\r\nbut, when requested by his Excellency, he was to repeat the prepared\r\nspeech, and subsequently the replies, which had likewise been prepared\r\nin answer to the Sultan’s language, of which his Excellency was\r\nable to guess the purport. Lord Ponsonby gave these directions, as he\r\nknew that Mr. Pisani was a nervous man, and might find it difficult\r\non such an occasion to render the Ambassador’s language adequately\r\ninto eloquent and polite Turkish, if not prepared beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador and members of the Embassy in uniform, with numerous\r\nkavasses, proceeded in the state kaik from Therapia to the Sultan’s\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nTo each attaché a banner or flag was given, to carry for presentation\r\nat the audience. To me was allotted a Turkish banner, on a very long\r\npole, with crescent and spear.\r\n\r\nAll the ministers and other dignitaries of the Porte were assembled\r\nat the palace, and stood in two lines on each side of the Sultan,\r\nas the Ambassador and suite entered the reception hall.\r\n\r\nKeeping my eyes fixed upon the Sultan as I entered, I lowered\r\nunwittingly the pole and banner, which were very heavy, and nearly\r\ncarried off on the spear the fez of one of the ministers. This\r\n‘gaucherie’ produced a suppressed giggle from an attaché.\r\n\r\nThe scene that followed was very ludicrous, especially as Lord\r\nPonsonby had not warned the members of the Embassy of the nature of\r\nthe address he was about to deliver, or of the instructions he had\r\ngiven to Mr. Pisani. Advancing with great dignity near to where the\r\nSultan stood, and putting out occasionally his hand as an orator\r\nmight do, Lord Ponsonby commenced with a very grave expression of\r\ncountenance, counting ‘one, two, three, four, five,’ &c., up\r\nto fifty, occasionally modulating his voice, as if he desired to\r\nmake an impression upon the minds of his hearers, putting emphasis\r\nupon some numbers, and smiling with satisfaction and pleasure when\r\nhe reached the higher numbers of thirty up to forty. Of course his\r\nExcellency knew that the Sultan, his ministers, and other officials\r\nat the Court were not acquainted with the English language.\r\n\r\nOn concluding, he turned to the interpreter and motioned him to\r\nspeak. Mr. Pisani recited in very eloquent and flowery Turkish the\r\nAmbassador’s prepared speech.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Ponsonby commenced the enumeration, I hid my face behind\r\nthe banner, and pinched myself sharply, to check the outburst of\r\nlaughter which inwardly convulsed me.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan replied, expressing his sense of gratitude to the British\r\nGovernment, his thanks to the British naval and military forces\r\nand their Commanders, as also to the Ambassador. This Mr. Pisani\r\ntranslated. Then Lord Ponsonby commenced again to count from sixty\r\nupwards, pausing now and then as if dwelling upon particular numbers,\r\nwhich by his voice and gesture it would appear he desired especially\r\nto impress on H.I.M.’s mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Pisani again repeated the language which he had been desired\r\nto prepare.\r\n\r\nThe trophies were handed over to Turkish officers appointed by the\r\nSultan to receive them, and the Ambassador and his suite retired.\r\n\r\nNot one of the Turkish officers present during the audience appeared\r\nto have the slightest suspicion of what was taking place, and even if\r\nthey had subsequently learnt that the Ambassador had counted instead\r\nof making a speech, they would have comprehended that the desire\r\nof his Excellency was that his prepared speech should be clearly\r\nand properly translated by the interpreter on such an interesting\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Bosco, famed for sleight of hand and\r\nmagic art, visited the Turkish capital; and Lord Ponsonby—who\r\nnever went out at night, not even to a dinner or reception at other\r\nEmbassies—being desirous of witnessing the performance of this\r\nrenowned magician, invited Bosco, who was a gentleman by birth,\r\nto dinner to meet a large party, requesting that he would entertain\r\nthe company after dinner by his marvellous sleight of hand.\r\n\r\nBosco arrived a little time before dinner was announced. The room was\r\ncrowded, and he was introduced and entered into conversation with\r\nseveral of the guests. During dinner he was quiet and unassuming,\r\nand did not take part in the general conversation; but just as\r\nLady Ponsonby was preparing to move, Bosco rose and, turning to the\r\nAmbassador, said, ‘I beg your Excellency’s permission to say a few\r\nwords before the company leave the table. It has been a high honour\r\nto have been invited by your Excellency to dine in company with such\r\ndistinguished men and noble ladies; but I feel that it would be an\r\nact of ingratitude on my part were I to conceal from your Excellency\r\nproceedings which have been passing both before and during dinner,\r\nand which have come to my knowledge through the extraordinary gift\r\nof vision I possess, and the faculty of perception of the acts and\r\nmovements of those around me. Humble individual as I am, I have no\r\nhesitation in declaring that the very unusual proceedings in which\r\ncertain persons in this society have taken part might reflect, in\r\nsome degree, upon all present—even upon myself, a poor conjurer,\r\nwho has been thrown into their company—should it be known that I\r\nhave associated with gentlemen and ladies, whose conduct might be\r\nstigmatised as criminal!’\r\n\r\nHe spoke thus with such a grave countenance that even Lord Ponsonby\r\nseemed puzzled, and thought the man was demented.\r\n\r\nBosco continued, ‘Your Lordship cannot but admit that the grave\r\ncharge I have put forward is not without foundation, when I declare\r\nthat in the coat pockets, or the breasts of the waistcoats, of several\r\nof the gentlemen there will be found some of your Lordship’s\r\nsilver spoons—and the selection has not been confined to the\r\nclean alone.’\r\n\r\nThe guests put their hands into their pockets, from which they\r\nextracted spoons and forks still greasy from use, salt spoons,\r\ntops of cruets, &c. Great merriment ensued, especially on the part\r\nof the ladies at the expense of the unfortunate men who were thus\r\nproved to be guilty.\r\n\r\nThen Bosco, turning to some ladies who were on the opposite side of\r\nthe table, and with whom he had been holding a lively conversation\r\nbefore dinner, said, ‘That noble lady,’ indicating one, ‘ought\r\nhardly to laugh at the disclosure I have made, since it will be found\r\nthat she has secreted in the bodice of her dress the bouquet of one\r\nof the gentlemen, who has since been making a vain search for it,\r\nhaving possibly received the pretty flowers from another fair hand.’\r\n\r\nThe lady flushed up angrily; but, in searching, found the lost\r\nbouquet concealed in the folds of her dress.\r\n\r\nThen turning to another, he said, ‘Madame, you cannot be justified\r\nin speaking, as it appears to me I have heard you doing, regarding\r\nthe gentlemen who took possession of his Lordship’s spoons, when\r\nyou will find, concealed in your hair, an ornament which rightfully\r\nbelongs to that lady upon whose person sparkle so many beautiful\r\njewels.’\r\n\r\nThe ornament in question was found fixed in the hair of the accused.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Bosco explained the extraordinary gift he possessed\r\nof sleight of hand and of his being able—while calling the attention\r\nof the person, with whom he was conversing, to some indifferent object\r\nor otherwise distracting attention—to abstract, by an instantaneous\r\nand almost imperceptible movement, some ornament from their person\r\nand again to be able to place, or cast it with precision, wherever\r\nhe desired. He also explained the trick which many have of shuffling\r\ncards, so that when dealing at whist or écarté, &c., he could put\r\ninto his own hand or that of others the cards he pleased. He added\r\nthat, though possessing this extraordinary faculty from boyhood,\r\nhe had never taken advantage of it in a dishonest or unworthy manner\r\nexcept when, as quite a youth, he desired to go to Paris to make his\r\nway in the world as a conjurer, and his father, a poor gentleman, had\r\nnot been able to give him more than a few gold pieces wherewith to\r\ndefray the expenses of his journey. He described how he had started\r\nwith his knapsack from some town in Austria, occasionally travelling\r\nby diligence, and passing the nights at inns on the road. During\r\nthe journey, Bosco said, he frequently had a gold piece changed,\r\nand whilst the change was being delivered he managed to recover the\r\ngold coin, and thus arrived at Paris with sufficient means to enable\r\nhim to live until he found employment. ‘Since then,’ he added,\r\n‘I have been an honest man.’\r\n\r\nOther recollections of those days follow.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Londonderry arrived at Constantinople and called on\r\nthe Ambassador, and Lady Londonderry requested his Excellency to\r\npresent her to the Sultan.\r\n\r\nAs the presentation of a European lady to H.I.M. had never been\r\nheard of in those days, Lord Ponsonby declined to take steps to meet\r\nthe wishes of the fair lady, on the plea that such an unprecedented\r\nrequest might give annoyance to the Sultan. Lady Londonderry was,\r\nhowever, determined to gain her point, and also to show Lord Ponsonby\r\nthat if he had not sufficient influence to obtain such a special\r\nfavour from the Sultan, another Representative might be found who\r\nwould pay more attention to her wishes.\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry had made the acquaintance at Vienna of Baron Stummer,\r\nthe Austrian Ambassador at Constantinople, who, though he had not the\r\npowerful influence which Lord Ponsonby then enjoyed, was regarded\r\nby the Sultan and his Ministers as a very important personage to\r\nwhose wishes it was politic and advisable to attend.\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry made known her request to the Baron, who at first\r\ndemurred for the same reason as Lord Ponsonby; but pressed by the\r\nfair dame—who pleaded that she only asked for a private interview\r\nwith the Sultan—and knowing that Lord Londonderry held a high\r\nposition in his own country, he promised to mention her wishes to\r\nReshid Pasha, who was at that time Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nspoke French fluently, to ascertain whether it was possible that\r\nsuch an extraordinary favour could be granted by H.I.M.\r\n\r\nReshid Pasha raised many objections; but being most desirous to\r\nplease the Austrian Ambassador, he informed him that there was one\r\npossible way by which the lady could be brought very privately into\r\nthe presence of His Majesty. He had heard, he said, that the noble\r\nlady travelled with untold wealth in diamonds, &c.: the Sultan was\r\npassionately fond of jewelry, of which he made frequent purchases;\r\nand possibly His Majesty might consent, on learning that there was a\r\nperson in Constantinople who had a large assortment of jewels, that\r\nshe should be allowed to bring them herself to the Palace. Should\r\nHis Majesty consent, the Pasha informed the Baron, no one but himself\r\n(Reshid) and Lady Londonderry would be present at the interview with\r\nthe Sultan, and in such case he would act as interpreter.\r\n\r\nReshid Pasha having made known to the Sultan that a person had\r\narrived at Constantinople with a wonderful collection of most valuable\r\njewelry, asked whether His Majesty would like to see them.\r\n\r\nThe following conversation is said to have taken place:—\r\n\r\n_Sultan._ ‘Let the jewelry be brought and prices stated.’\r\n\r\n_Reshid._ ‘This individual never trusts the jewelry to any one,\r\nand would have to come in person.’\r\n\r\n_Sultan._ ‘Bring the jeweller.’\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (in a hesitating manner). ‘I beg your Majesty’s pardon\r\nfor indelicacy, but it is—it is—a female[4], and she always\r\ncarries the jewels on her person when she wishes to dispose of them\r\nfor sale, and never puts them in a case.’\r\n\r\n_Sultan._ ‘Bring her, and let her put them all on. You come also,\r\nto interpret.’\r\n\r\nReshid returned and told the Baron he might inform Lady Londonderry\r\nthat she would be presented at a private audience by him, but that\r\nthe Sultan, having heard of the fame of her jewelry, had particularly\r\nrequested she would put it all on, and he, the Pasha, hoped therefore\r\nshe would raise no objection to such a strange request.\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry was very good-natured, and being much amused at\r\nthe condition made by the Sultan, consented to put on all her most\r\nvaluable jewelry.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at the Palace, Reshid Pasha conducted Lady Londonderry\r\ninto the presence of the Sultan. Her dress glittered with diamonds,\r\npearls, turquoises, and other precious stones.\r\n\r\n‘_Pekkei_—good,’ said the Sultan (as Lady Londonderry\r\ncurtseyed), ‘she has brought magnificent jewels.’\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (turning to the lady). ‘His Majesty graciously bids\r\nyou welcome.’\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry bowed and expressed her thanks in French.\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (interpreting). ‘She says she has other jewelry, but\r\ncould not put on all.’\r\n\r\n_Sultan._ ‘Ask her what is the price of that diamond necklace.’\r\n\r\n_Reshid._ ‘His Majesty inquires whether this is your first visit\r\nto Constantinople.’\r\n\r\n_Lady Londonderry._ ‘It is my first visit, and I am delighted with\r\nall I have seen.’\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (_to Sultan_). ‘She asks a million of piastres.’\r\n\r\n_Sultan._ ‘That is too much.’\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (_to Lady Londonderry_). ‘His Majesty asks whether you\r\nhave seen the Mosques. If not, offers you a firman.’\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry expresses her thanks.\r\n\r\n_Sultan._ ‘What price does she put on that set of turquoises?’\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (_to Lady Londonderry_). ‘His Majesty says that perhaps\r\nyou would like to take a walk in the garden.’\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry expresses her thanks, and would like to see the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (_to Sultan_). ‘She says 400,000 piastres.’\r\n\r\n_Sultan._ ‘Take her away, I shall not give such prices.’\r\n\r\n_Reshid_ (_to Lady Londonderry_). ‘His Majesty graciously expresses\r\nsatisfaction at having made your acquaintance.’\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry curtseys low and withdraws from His Majesty’s\r\npresence to visit the garden with the amiable and courteous Reshid\r\nPasha.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn the summer months at Constantinople, Turkish ladies and their\r\nchildren were wont to drive in ‘arabas’ to the ‘Sweet Waters.’\r\nGroups of Mohammedan women of the better class, with their families\r\nand slaves, were to be seen in picturesque dresses reclining on\r\ncarpets and cushions, enjoying coffee, sweetmeats, &c., under the\r\nshade of the fine old trees on this beautiful spot. Men were not\r\nallowed to approach the ground where the women were seated. Kavasses\r\nwarned off intruders; but the members of Embassies, especially when\r\naccompanied by a kavass, were not interfered with, even if they\r\nwalked near the groups of women.\r\n\r\nTurkish ladies in those days wore the ‘yashmak’ or veil, supposed\r\nto cover their faces, but worn so low as frequently to expose even the\r\nmouth, and at the ‘Sweet Waters’ yashmaks were thrown aside still\r\nmore, thus displaying embroidered jackets, bright-coloured belts,\r\nand silk or cotton ‘shalvas.’ Turkish women, even the far-famed\r\nCircassians, are not in general pretty, but they have fine eyes and\r\na piquant expression.\r\n\r\nWhen passing these groups of ladies, I have often heard humorous\r\nremarks, evidently intended to reach the ears of the unabashed\r\n‘Frank’ who had ventured to intrude amongst them.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when taking a walk, I had wandered to a secluded spot,\r\nwhen I suddenly came upon two Turkish ladies and a slave taking\r\ncoffee. One of the ladies looked up and smiled, making some remark\r\nto her companion, evidently about myself, the purport of which I\r\ndid not quite understand. I merely returned the smile and walked\r\nhurriedly away, for the dinner-hour at the Embassy was approaching. I\r\nhad gone but a short distance when I heard some one running up behind\r\nme. On turning round I was accosted by an old black woman, who, in a\r\nbreathless voice, said, ‘Khanem’ (my mistress), ‘whom you have\r\njust passed, requests that you will give her a pin for her dress.’\r\n\r\nAs I happened to have a pin, I was about to hand it to the slave,\r\nwhen she said, ‘Khanem wishes you to bring it to her;’ adding,\r\nin a whisper, ‘there is no one near, and she has something to say\r\nto you.’\r\n\r\nLooking at my watch, I replied it was late, and requested her to tell\r\nher mistress that I was sorry I could not comply with her request,\r\nadding, ‘Tell me, who is your beautiful khanem?’\r\n\r\nThe slave replied, ‘She is the wife of the late Sultan Mahmud’s\r\ndwarf.’\r\n\r\nI had already heard something about this lady, but having a vivid\r\nrecollection of a late adventure of Baron B., a member of a foreign\r\nLegation and a particular friend of mine, whom I had helped out of\r\na serious scrape where his life had been in great danger, and who\r\nhad been obliged to quit Constantinople suddenly (having been given\r\nto understand that unless he left the country his recall would be\r\nrequired by the Turkish Government), I made up my mind not to satisfy\r\nmy curiosity by seeking for an interview with the fair Circassian.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I requested a Turkish police officer of high rank,\r\nwho had aided me in helping Baron B. out of the scrape to which I\r\nhave alluded, to tell me what he knew about the wife of the dwarf,\r\nnot mentioning, however, the incident which had occurred at the\r\n‘Sweet Waters.’\r\n\r\nThe officer then related the following tale:—\r\n\r\n‘Sultan Mahmud had a humpbacked dwarf, with a hideous countenance,\r\nbut who was renowned for wit and humour. This monster was frequently\r\nadmitted by the Sultan into the harem when H.M. was seated with his\r\nodalisques enjoying the “chebúk.”\r\n\r\n‘To please the ladies, the dwarf was made a constant butt, both\r\nby H.I.M. and the odalisques, and he answered them by his gibes\r\nand ready repartee: having full permission to say what he pleased,\r\neven should he cast reflections on H.I.M.’s sacred person.\r\n\r\n‘Amongst the odalisques who happened to be present one evening,\r\nwas a tall Circassian of great beauty, with a graceful figure. She\r\nwas very lively, and in order to amuse the Sultan, had made pert\r\nremarks about the admirable figure and handsome countenance of the\r\ndwarf, thus giving rise to much merriment, in which the Sultan Mahmud\r\njoined. Turning to the dwarf, H.I.M. said, “Now if you can kiss\r\nLeila (the tall Circassian) she shall be your wife.”\r\n\r\n‘The dwarf replied, “Can a dog reach the moon? Can a bramble\r\nentwine the top of the lofty cypress?”\r\n\r\n‘The Circassian continued to make fun of the dwarf, who appeared\r\nto take no further thought of the Sultan’s words, though it was\r\nobserved he kept his eye on her tall figure.\r\n\r\n‘Later in the evening, when the pipe which the Sultan was smoking\r\nhad to be renewed, Leila bent down for that purpose. In a moment\r\nthe dwarf, watching his opportunity, sprang up and kissed her as she\r\nstooped. She struck him, and, in a volley of violent and passionate\r\nlanguage, implored the Sultan to punish him for his insolence and\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\n‘The dwarf exclaimed, “The Commander of the Faithful, the Sultan\r\nof Sultans, has spoken. His word cannot be broken. I claim Leila\r\nfor my wife.”\r\n\r\n‘The Sultan looked displeased; and, after a pause, with a severe\r\nexpression on his countenance, ordered the dwarf to leave the room;\r\nthen, turning to Leila, said, “Retire. Henceforth consider yourself\r\nthe wife of the dwarf. A dowry shall be given you, and the wedding\r\nshall forthwith take place. Depart from my presence. I see you\r\nno more.”\r\n\r\n‘The Circassian, as she left the room, turned towards the dwarf, who\r\nwas also about to withdraw, and cursed him, saying, “Monster! The\r\nday will come when you will rue and bitterly repent your cruel\r\ntreachery.”\r\n\r\n‘Leila duly became the wife of the dwarf. She drove about in her\r\n“araba” through the streets of Pera, and, wearing a transparent\r\n“yashmak” lowered to the chin, even entered the shops, and\r\nconversed—when not observed—with Europeans. She visited the studio\r\nof a French artist, by whom her portrait was painted in water-colours,\r\nand of which she allowed copies to be taken to present to favourite\r\nFranks with whom she became acquainted. Her conduct became a source\r\nof great scandal, and was brought under the notice of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n‘H.I.M. said, “Let her be free to do what she pleases. I committed\r\na great injustice in giving her to the dwarf; but my word could not\r\nbe set aside.”’\r\n\r\nThe police officer having thus concluded his story, I inquired where\r\nthe French artist lived, and, calling on him, offered to purchase a\r\ncopy of the portrait. He told me he could not give it without the\r\nconsent of the wife of the dwarf. I then requested him to let her\r\nknow that the ‘Frank,’ one of the British Secretaries, of whom\r\nshe had requested the gift of a pin at the ‘Sweet Waters,’ begged\r\nfor her portrait. Her consent was thereupon given, on condition that\r\nI should not show it to any one in Constantinople.\r\n\r\nI paid a round sum for the water-colour, and on my return to England,\r\nafter Lord Ponsonby had resigned the post of Ambassador, I gave the\r\nportrait of the beautiful Circassian to Lady Ponsonby—from whom\r\nI had received great kindness—as a souvenir of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nVery extraordinary hours were kept at the Embassy: we rarely sat down\r\nto dinner before 9.30, and frequently not till ten p.m. At eleven\r\no’clock Lord and Lady Ponsonby had a rubber of whist in which I was\r\nalways required to take a hand, it being thought I knew more about the\r\ngame than the other members of the Embassy. As his Excellency required\r\nthat Lady Ponsonby should be his partner, and as that charming lady\r\nknew very little about the game, they almost invariably lost.\r\n\r\nAfter whist, Lord Ponsonby was wont to request one of the attachés\r\nto remain and converse, and his Excellency would then hold forth\r\nfor hours upon events present and future, both in Turkey and Egypt;\r\nforetelling much that has since happened to the ‘Sick Man.’ One\r\nnight, when it was my watch, and I had listened to his Lordship until\r\nI nearly fell asleep and was conscious that dawn was approaching, he\r\nrose, opened one of the blinds and said, ‘The sun is rising. I think\r\nit is time, Mr. Hay, to go to bed. Have you followed and understood\r\nmy views upon the Eastern Question?’ I answered, I had, to the\r\nbest of my ability. ‘Then,’ said he, ‘have the goodness to\r\nembody to-morrow in a memorandum all that you may have retained.’\r\nObserving that I looked aghast at having such a task imposed upon\r\nme, he patted me on the shoulder and added, ‘Well, well, don’t\r\ntrouble yourself. Eat, drink, and sleep; the rest’s a joke.’\r\n\r\nThere was great charm in the manner of both Lord and Lady Ponsonby,\r\nand they showed much kindness to all the members of the Embassy. There\r\nwas not one of us who would not have been ready to make any sacrifice\r\nof time and pleasure to meet their wishes.\r\n\r\nLord Ponsonby was not a wealthy peer, but his expenditure was lavish\r\nas far as the table was concerned. Briant, a Frenchman, was steward\r\nand head cook, and his wife was maid to Lady Ponsonby. They received\r\n£400 a year between them for their services, but it was well known by\r\nthe members of the Embassy that Briant, during the few years he had\r\nbeen at Constantinople, had been enabled to deposit several thousand\r\npounds in one of the banks at Pera, levying a heavy percentage on\r\neverything that he purchased, wine included, and some of which it\r\nwas discovered he was in the habit of selling to an hotel in Pera;\r\nso when any member of the Embassy passed a night in the town and dined\r\nat the said hotel, he always called for ‘Chateau Briant’! An old\r\nfriend of Lord Ponsonby’s, who remained for some months on a visit\r\nat the Embassy, hearing of the scandalous manner in which Briant was\r\naccumulating money at the bank, thought it would be a friendly act\r\nto make known to his Lordship that which was in the mouth of every\r\none—Briant’s system of peculation. He did so. Lord Ponsonby\r\nthanked him for the information and observed, ‘How much do you\r\nthink Briant robs annually and deposits in the bank?’\r\n\r\n‘At least £1000 a year,’ his friend replied.\r\n\r\n‘Pray,’ said Lord Ponsonby, ‘pray keep what has passed between\r\nus most secret; I had thought Briant’s pilferings far exceeded\r\nthat sum. I would not, for double that amount, lose such an excellent\r\nchef. Keep it secret, Mr. ———, keep it secret!’\r\n\r\nThough he may not have possessed the brilliant talents of his\r\nsuccessor, the great ‘Elchi,’ Lord Ponsonby acted with much\r\nenergy, decision, and success in carrying out the views which he knew\r\nwere entertained by that most admirable of statesmen, Lord Palmerston,\r\nregarding the Turkish Empire at the time when Mehemet Ali, backed by\r\nFrance, was seeking to declare his independence, and to place Egypt\r\nunder the aegis of the latter power; to attain which object has been,\r\nand is, the aim of France even up to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan, Abdul Mijid, and his Minister, Reshid Pasha, accepted\r\nthankfully and unreservedly the dictum of Lord Ponsonby in all\r\nquestions—and as long as Palmerston was at the head of foreign\r\naffairs, Lord Ponsonby carried out his views in the East without a\r\ncheck, notwithstanding the vigorous opposition made by the French\r\nAmbassador, Monsieur Pontet, and the constant threat that extreme\r\nmeasures would be adopted by France under certain contingencies; but\r\nwhen Lord Aberdeen came into power and sought to pursue a conciliatory\r\npolicy towards France, Lord Ponsonby received dispatches, couched in a\r\nspirit which pointed out distinctly that he should moderate his action\r\nin support of the Sultan against Mehemet Ali’s pretensions. From\r\nprivate letters that Lord Ponsonby received from friends at home, he\r\nknew more or less what was the tenor of the instructions contained\r\nin those dispatches, so he did not break the seals but continued\r\nto follow up vigorously the same policy as before, until the object\r\nhe had in view, viz., Mehemet Ali’s submission to the Porte, was\r\nachieved, and then Lord Ponsonby retired, or was required to retire.\r\n\r\nIt happened one day that I was standing near the Ambassador at\r\nhis writing-table whilst he was giving me directions to convey a\r\nmessage to an Armenian banker of the Porte, upon a monetary question\r\naffecting the interests of the Turkish Government. He pulled open\r\nthe drawer of the table at which he was seated to get out a paper,\r\nand I caught a glimpse of several sealed dispatches, addressed to his\r\nExcellency, from the Foreign Office. Lord Ponsonby, whilst closing\r\nthe drawer, perceiving, as I suppose, an expression of surprise on\r\nmy face, looked up with a smile, and re-opening the drawer, said,\r\n‘You are astonished, Mr. Hay, at seeing such a number of Foreign\r\nOffice dispatches lying here unopened: so am I!—for though I had\r\ncertainly left in this drawer a few sealed letters, they have since\r\nbeen breeding;’ adding, whilst he re-closed the drawer, ‘Let\r\nthem breed!’\r\n\r\nThose were days when an Ambassador possessed extraordinary powers, and\r\ncould carry out a policy which he considered best for the interests\r\nof his country, without allowing himself to be fettered by the\r\nvacillating views of Government and be moved—as now happens—like\r\na puppet, by telegraph wires or other rapid means of communication.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of instructions received from Lord Ponsonby, I called on\r\nthe Armenian banker, before mentioned, at his private dwelling. This\r\nwas a beautiful house, fitted up in the same manner as was then usual\r\nwith Turks, for the Armenians of Constantinople at that time adopted\r\nthe Turkish mode of living. The Armenian women veiled their faces and\r\nwore costumes similar to those of the Mohammedans, except that their\r\nslippers were red, whereas those used by Turkish females were yellow.\r\n\r\nAfter making known to the porter who I was, and that I had come\r\nupon an errand from the Ambassador, the old banker came to meet me,\r\nled me to a room set apart for receiving his guests, and seated me\r\non a luxurious divan. He was attired in a handsome Armenian costume,\r\nwearing a black head-dress much like an inverted iron cauldron.\r\n\r\nA few moments after my arrival, a damsel of about seventeen—daughter\r\nof the banker—set before me a ‘narghileh,’ and adroitly\r\nplaced between my lips the amber mouthpiece. I had never used a\r\n‘narghileh’ or smoked ‘tumbaki,’ which is the form of tobacco\r\nemployed in that kind of pipe, and was glad to have an opportunity\r\nof trying it, as presented to me by the Armenian maiden.\r\n\r\nShe was a pretty girl, with brilliant dark eyes, and features much\r\nresembling those of a Jewess of Morocco. The Turkish costume, with its\r\nyellow satin ‘shalvas’ or trousers, and the graceful shawl which\r\ngirded her waist, looked most picturesque and charming, and I sank\r\nback on the cushions and gurgled my hubble-bubble with satisfaction;\r\nwhilst another pretty damsel, a younger sister, brought in coffee,\r\nwhich she presented with a graceful bow.\r\n\r\nThe banker and I talked and puffed, drank coffee and sherbet, and eat\r\nsweetmeats of all kinds which were brought to us in succession. I felt\r\nhappy, as if I had reached the seventh heaven of the Mohammedan. Time\r\nslipped by very quickly. I had finished the business of my mission\r\nwhen the old banker looked at his watch, put aside his ‘narghileh’\r\nand fidgeted a little, thus giving me clearly to understand it would\r\nbe convenient that I should leave. Much as I was enjoying myself,\r\nI was also of the same opinion, and made an effort to rise and\r\nget my feet to the ground—for I was seated cross-legged on the\r\ndivan—but could not move them; they seemed to be paralysed. The\r\nbanker, not knowing my state, and fancying perhaps that my admiration\r\nfor his pretty daughters had checked my departure, told them rather\r\nroughly, when they again appeared smiling and bringing more Turkish\r\nsweetmeats, that their presence was no longer required, and then,\r\nlooking once more at his watch, he said most politely, and with\r\nprofuse apologies, ‘I see the hour is past at which I ought to\r\npresent myself to the Porte.’\r\n\r\nI made many excuses for not having taken my leave and told him,\r\nwith a nervous laugh, that I felt very strange sensations, but\r\ndid not know the cause; that on attempting to rise I found I had\r\nno control over my legs, and could not remove them from the divan,\r\nfeeling as if my body did not belong to me. I added, ‘You can see\r\nhowever I am not deprived of my senses.’ Could it be the effect\r\nof the narghileh—which I had never smoked before—and that the\r\ntumbaki had produced this extraordinary languor in my limbs, as it\r\npossibly contained opium?\r\n\r\nThe Armenian appeared much amused on hearing of my helpless state. He\r\nassisted me from the divan, supporting me while I tried to walk,\r\nand finding that I could not do so, a daughter was summoned to\r\nfetch some cordial, which the maiden, with an expression of mirth,\r\nbrought and administered. Having taken this and rested awhile,\r\nI regained the use of my legs. The banker, on my taking leave,\r\nexpressed repeatedly his regret that I should have suffered any\r\ninconvenience from the effects of the narghileh, and added that were\r\nnot his presence required at the Porte he would have insisted on my\r\nremaining at his house to rest for that night at least.\r\n\r\nAbout a year or more after this incident, when Sir Stratford Canning\r\nhad replaced Lord Ponsonby as Ambassador, a fancy ball was given\r\nby Lady Canning at the Embassy at Pera, and I was requested by her\r\nLadyship to take the lead and the direction of the dancing. I was\r\ndressed in Highland costume, and had selected for my partner in\r\nthe cotillon the daughter of the Armenian banker mentioned in this\r\nstory. In those days Armenian ladies rarely mixed in European society,\r\nbut she had been permitted on this special occasion to appear at the\r\nball at the Embassy, accompanied by her father. She was beautifully\r\ndressed in the ancient Armenian costume, was certainly the belle\r\nof the evening, and waltzed like a sylph, so made a perfect partner\r\nfor one who loved dancing as I did, and we led the various figures\r\nin the cotillon with great spirit. Our conversation was carried on\r\nin Turkish, which I spoke fluently.\r\n\r\nWhilst we danced I observed that one of the Turkish Ministers,\r\nwho was present at the ball, took every opportunity of coming close\r\nto where I happened to halt with my partner; gazing at her rudely,\r\nas I thought, especially as she was a shy and modest girl.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the cotillon was drawing to a close, the Pasha came\r\nup to us smiling and said, ‘Pekkei, pekkei’ (very good). ‘You\r\nare suited to each other. She is “chok ghazal” (very pretty),\r\nand you are a well-favoured youth. You must marry her: she will\r\nhave money; you have position. My friend the banker will consent;\r\nI am pleased.’ And so the old fellow rattled on, much to my dismay\r\nand to the confusion of the pretty Armenian maiden.\r\n\r\nI remonstrated courteously with the old Minister, saying, ‘My\r\npartner is very beautiful, but we have not thought of love or\r\nmarriage, for we are of different nations and creeds. Moreover, she\r\nwould not accept me as a candidate for wedlock, even if I offered\r\nmyself; but I shall always look back with pleasure to this evening\r\nwhen I have been honoured by having such a lovely partner for this\r\ndance.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah,’ said the Pasha, ‘she is, I know, the daughter of the\r\nbanker. I will speak to him and arrange matters, for I should like\r\nto make you both happy.’\r\n\r\nLuckily the time had come for me to bring the cotillon to a close;\r\nso, bowing to the meddling old gentleman, I carried off my partner to\r\nher father, telling her how vexed I felt; for she must have suffered\r\ngreat annoyance from the foolish language held by the Pasha. The\r\nfair Armenian replied, very shyly and prettily, that she did not\r\nthink he had said anything from malice, so she hoped I would forgive,\r\nas she had done, his remarks. To this I readily agreed, and leading\r\nher back to where her father the banker was standing I took my leave,\r\nand never met again the pretty Armenian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n           CONSTANTINOPLE WITH SIR STRATFORD CANNING. 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Stratford Canning succeeded Lord Ponsonby as Ambassador in\r\n1841. He arrived at Constantinople on board a Government steamer, and\r\nall the members of the Embassy presented themselves on the arrival of\r\nhis Excellency. These were Charles Bankhead, Secretary of Embassy,\r\nPercy Doyle, Charles Alison, and myself; Lord Napier and Ettrick,\r\nWilliam Maule, Mactavish, and Count Pisani, keeper of the archives,\r\nbesides the elder Pisani (Etienne). Robert Curzon, afterwards Lord\r\nZouche, accompanied his Excellency as private secretary.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Sir Stratford for severity towards his subordinates had\r\npreceded him, and we all felt sad at the loss of our late chief,\r\nthe kind and courteous Lord Ponsonby, and at the prospect of being\r\nruled with an iron hand.\r\n\r\nSir Stratford inquired of Doyle as to the method employed in the\r\nconduct of business at the Chancery. He replied that office hours\r\nwere from eleven till half-past three, but that Lord Ponsonby allowed\r\nthe gentlemen of the Embassy to attend at, or leave, the Chancery\r\nwhen they pleased, so long as the work was done efficiently. Sir\r\nStratford said that such an irregular way of conducting business\r\nwould not suit him and that he should appoint one of the gentlemen to\r\nhold the key of the archives, to receive the dispatches and letters\r\nand come to him for orders every morning. Then, turning towards us,\r\nhe added, ‘I am not acquainted personally with any one of you,\r\nand therefore have no ground for selection, but I choose Mr. Hay.’\r\n\r\nGladness flashed across the faces of the other attachés, and,\r\nwhen out of hearing of the great Elchi, they chaffed me by saying,\r\n‘You are the smallest, so his Excellency thinks he can get the\r\nbetter of you if there is a row!’\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the Embassy, which was at that time at Buyukdere,\r\nI was summoned, and was directed by the Ambassador to take possession\r\nof the key of the archives and not to allow any one to have access\r\nto, or to see, the dispatches which might be received from, or\r\nwritten to, the Secretary of State on political subjects, and that I\r\nshould be held responsible if anything of importance transpired. Sir\r\nStratford told me his reason for making this arrangement was that\r\nan attaché, at one of the Missions he had held, had by foolish\r\nindiscretion betrayed the contents of an important dispatch to a\r\nmember of a foreign Legation. He directed that I should myself copy\r\nall dispatches of importance to the Secretary of State and give out\r\nthe rest of the work to the other attachés.\r\n\r\nI made known to the Secretary of Embassy, Bankhead, and to the\r\nattachés, the instructions I had received. They were indignant—it\r\nappeared to me with good reason—that they were not to be trusted;\r\nespecially Bankhead, who remonstrated and said he considered he had\r\na right to see all the dispatches to and from the Foreign Office, and\r\ntherefore should pay no attention to the Ambassador’s directions. I\r\nreplied that, having told them the orders I had received, they\r\nwere free to act as they thought fit and that I was not going to\r\nbe a Cerberus, but suggested that they should remonstrate with Sir\r\nStratford and not with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Stratford seems to have been satisfied with his selection of\r\nMr. Hay as his confidential attaché, for shortly after he writes\r\nin a note dated from Buyukdere to Mr. Hay at the Embassy, ‘I\r\nhave welcomed your first communication to me in writing. All quite\r\nclear. Everything necessary, nothing superfluous.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1843, the British Consul at Broussa laid before the Ambassador\r\ncomplaints against the Pasha of the district where he resided, and\r\nthe latter had also brought under the notice of the Porte grievances\r\nof a serious character, alleged to have been suffered from the\r\nproceedings of the Consul. Attempts were made by both the Porte and\r\nthe Ambassador to bring about a settlement of the differences but\r\nwithout success. British subjects, Ionians, and Turks whose interests\r\nwere affected by this state of affairs, appealed to the Embassy and\r\nto the Porte, urging that steps should be taken to secure the ends\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nSir Stratford Canning proposed to the Porte that an officer of\r\nthe Embassy should be sent to Broussa to make an inquiry into the\r\nconduct of the two functionaries, and that he should be empowered\r\nboth by the Porte and the Ambassador to bring about a settlement\r\nof these differences, which had been a constant source of vexatious\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nSir Stratford selected me for this duty, and delivered to me\r\nletters from the Porte to the Pasha and from himself to the Consul,\r\nacquainting them respectively that I had been authorised to inquire\r\ninto the various questions at issue, and to endeavour to bring about\r\na settlement.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a Greek servant, who knew the country and could act\r\nas guide, I embarked in a steamer which took us to a port where we\r\nhired horses and proceeded to Broussa.\r\n\r\nBoth the Consul and Pasha, on my arrival, offered me hospitality,\r\nwhich I declined under the peculiar circumstances in which I was\r\nplaced by my mission.\r\n\r\nThe day after my arrival the Pasha summoned a Divan of several local\r\nnotables, who were to give evidence, and the Consul was also requested\r\nto attend.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the Divan, being then a youth of about twenty-six,\r\nI was much shocked at seeing that the Pasha, Consul, and other\r\nnotables—upon whom I had, as it were, to sit in judgment—were\r\nmen with white and hoary beards and of a venerable appearance.\r\n\r\nAfter pipes and coffee, the hearing of the various subjects in\r\ndispute commenced. Though I refer to this scene, as it affects the\r\nend of my tale, it is needless to relate what passed, further than\r\nto mention that I found both Pasha and Consul were in the wrong, but\r\nthat neither had acted in a manner to require any severe censure on\r\nthe part of the Porte or Ambassador, and I drew up a report in that\r\nsense. On my return journey to the port, having heard that game was\r\nplentiful, I gave my horse to the Greek to lead and wandered over the\r\ncountry. I had good sport; and the Greek frequently warned me that\r\nunless we kept to the beaten path and rode on quickly, we should\r\nnot be able to reach the port before dark.\r\n\r\nContinuing however to shoot, I wandered after game many miles from\r\nthe road, or rather track, until it became so dark that I could no\r\nlonger see the birds rise. On remounting, I told the Greek to lead\r\nthe way, but he declined; he knew not where we were, nor even what\r\ndirection to take. It was a bright clear night, and at a distance\r\nof about two miles I espied a light; thither I decided to direct\r\nour steps and to ask for shelter for the night, or for a guide.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at a large building, with lattice windows several feet\r\nfrom the ground, surrounded by a high wall enclosing what appeared to\r\nbe farm-buildings, with a large double gate where carts and cattle\r\ncould pass. After knocking loudly, an old Turk appeared. Telling\r\nhim I was an English traveller and had lost my way, I begged to\r\nhave shelter for the night anywhere in the farm-yard; a feed for my\r\nhorses and some bread and coffee, if nothing else in the way of food\r\nwas procurable, for myself and servant, for we were very hungry.\r\n\r\nThe Turk replied that his master was ——— Bey, who had formerly\r\nbeen in the service of the Porte; that he was a landed proprietor;\r\nthat as his family dwelt with him, no man could be admitted into the\r\nhouse; but he offered to ask the Bey’s permission to allow us to\r\npass the night in one of the outhouses and to put up our horses.\r\n\r\nThe gate was again closed, and after waiting a few minutes, a Turkish\r\ngentleman, dressed in a handsome fur pelisse and fez, appeared.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual salutations, he said, ‘Are you an Englishman?’\r\nI replied that I was, without making myself known as one of the\r\nSecretaries of the British Embassy. He bade me welcome in a hearty\r\nmanner, and turning to the old man who had just opened the gate,\r\ndirected that my attendant should be lodged in a room in the\r\nfarm-buildings and given whatever he might require, and that the\r\nhorses should be stalled and fed.\r\n\r\nThen taking me to the door of his house and opening it with a large\r\nkey, he stopped on the threshold and said, ‘You are an English\r\ngentleman, and therefore a man of honour. I am about to do that\r\nwhich no Mohammedan will or ought to do, and admit you to my harem\r\namongst my family. I have heard how English gentlemen visit the\r\nhouses of friends and live as men of honour with their families,\r\nwithout restraint. I shall do the same, for I have special reasons\r\nfor my conduct, which I will relate when you have rested. It is my\r\nearnest hope that you should feel as if you were with one of your\r\nown countrymen; but I beg you to keep secret from every one your\r\nvisit to my house, and never to mention whom you may see within it.’\r\n\r\nHe then led me up a narrow staircase into a well-lighted room,\r\nhandsomely furnished with beautiful carpeting, comfortable divans,\r\nmirrors, Turkish tables, arms hung on the wall, and a couch with\r\npretty embroidered cushions and silk quilt, which he said was to be\r\nmy bed.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he bade me welcome, adding, ‘I shall leave you to\r\nrepose—you must be hungry. Supper is ordered. A pipe and coffee\r\nwill be brought to you, order what you please;’ then as he withdrew\r\nhe repeated again in a kind manner, ‘An English Effendi is always\r\na man of honour.’\r\n\r\nWhilst inspecting the room and wondering what all this meant, I heard\r\na gentle step, and a tall graceful figure of a girl about seventeen\r\nentered. She was dressed handsomely in a jacket used by Turkish\r\nladies, with a bodice open in front, like the square dresses now worn\r\nby English ladies of an evening. She had on yellow silk ‘shalvas’\r\nfastened by a white muslin sash, the ends of which were prettily\r\nembroidered. Her complexion was olive, with very large dark eyes and\r\nlong eyelashes; her nose aquiline, and her mouth like a ring set in\r\nruby lips. She looked grave and sad, but blushes diffused her cheeks\r\nas she bowed gracefully, and with a sweet smile put a ‘chebúk’\r\nto my mouth, and then retired. Her hair was braided in tresses around\r\nher head and adorned with coins. Two long braids hung down her back.\r\n\r\nThis vision of a Turkish maiden seemed like a dream, and whilst\r\npondering over the pretty figure that had just left and wondering\r\nwhether she would return, another damsel appeared bearing a cup\r\nof coffee in a ‘finjan’ studded with precious stones. Bending\r\nbefore me, she put it on the little table.\r\n\r\nShe appeared to be about fifteen, dressed like the bearer of the\r\n‘chebúk,’ but of a fairer complexion, with dark blue eyes,\r\nher nose _retroussé_. She was not so demure in her looks or\r\nmanner, and standing before me blushing and smiling with a mirthful\r\nexpression, said in a very sweet voice, ‘My father bids me ask if\r\nthere is anything you wish for, and to say your supper will soon be\r\nready.’ After thanking her, I held my tongue, remembering I was\r\nan ‘honourable man.’ She retired, turning at the threshold to\r\nlook at me, with a pretty smile of mischief. Shortly afterwards the\r\nelder damsel reappeared, bringing sherbet. I thanked her, and she\r\nbowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\nThen the host followed to announce that supper was ready and inquiring\r\nwhether I had been properly attended to, led me to a lower room,\r\nremarking that he thought I should be better able to enjoy my repast\r\nwithout his presence, but that he hoped in the evening to converse\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nDuring the supper I was waited on by both the fair maidens, who\r\nbrought me in succession a number of savoury dishes, with fruit and\r\nsweets of all kinds, for which the Turks are famous.\r\n\r\nI partook of everything largely, to the evident amusement and pleasure\r\nof the maidens. The elder was no longer so demure in her manner,\r\nand the eyes of the younger sparkled with fun as she waited on me;\r\nbut I indulged in no conversation further than to thank them now\r\nand then, saying ever to myself, ‘my host says I am an honourable\r\nman;’ but I fear my looks betrayed my admiration.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the Bey conducted me to my apartment, where coffee\r\nwas brought to us by the damsels, both of whom, I learnt, were\r\nhis daughters. I expressed to the Bey my warmest thanks for his\r\nhospitality, and for the great confidence he had shown by admitting\r\nme amongst his family. Upon this, he said he would relate why he had\r\nbroken through the Mohammedan custom and usages and bidden me welcome\r\nin his harem. He was fulfilling a vow made years ago, that whenever he\r\nhad an opportunity, he would endeavour to give proof of his gratitude\r\nfor kindness received from the captain of a British merchant vessel.\r\n\r\n‘When I was a young man,’ continued the Bey, ‘before I was\r\nmarried, I went on a pilgrimage to Mecca. On my return I embarked\r\nfrom Alexandria on a Turkish vessel bound to Constantinople. We\r\nencountered a heavy gale; the vessel was old and rotten; leaks were\r\nsprung, and the captain, crew, and myself who was the only passenger,\r\nhad barely time to get into the ship’s boat, when the vessel\r\nsunk. I lost all my clothes and money, with the exception of a few\r\npiastres. We expected every moment the boat would be swamped by the\r\nheavy seas breaking around us, when a ship hove in sight. Signals\r\nof distress were made, and she came to our assistance, and we were\r\nall taken safely on board. She proved to be an English vessel bound\r\nfor Salonica. The captain, a kind-hearted but rough-looking sailor,\r\ngave us dry clothes, dressed me in a warm suit of his own and supplied\r\nus with food.\r\n\r\n‘We arrived at Salonica and I was enabled through the pratique\r\nmaster, who understood a little English, to express my gratitude. I\r\noffered to pay for my passage and food. The captain was indignant,\r\nand said he would not accept a farthing; but, on the contrary,\r\nhaving learnt that I had no money to continue my voyage and had\r\nno friends at Salonica, put a small sum into my hands which would\r\nenable me to proceed to Constantinople.\r\n\r\n‘You,’ he continued, ‘are the first Englishman to whom I have\r\nhad an opportunity of showing feelings of gratitude, long pent-up,\r\nto your countryman who saved my life.’\r\n\r\nI then told him that I was one of the Secretaries of the British\r\nEmbassy at Constantinople, and what had been the object of my visit\r\nto Broussa. I said I should make known to the ‘great Elchi’\r\nhis hospitality and kindness. He again impressed upon me his\r\nanxious wish that I should keep my reception in his household a\r\nsecret, and, above all, the fact that I had been waited on by his\r\ndaughters—for he said it would be a serious matter if this was\r\nknown to his co-religionists. He consented, however, to my telling\r\nthe Ambassador confidentially all that had happened; but to my\r\nTurkish friends at Constantinople I was only to mention that I and\r\nmy servant had received shelter for the night. He also requested me\r\nnot to tell my Greek attendant that I had seen any women in the house.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise next day I was up, and going into the courtyard gave\r\ndirections to my servant to have the horses ready for a start as soon\r\nas I had breakfasted. He informed me that he had been well taken care\r\nof. I gave the Greek several gold piastres, which I directed should\r\nbe distributed amongst the dependants of the Bey. He informed me that\r\nhe had learnt from the old gatekeeper that the Bey had only one wife,\r\nand no other inmates of the harem except his two daughters and some\r\nblack slaves.\r\n\r\nA good breakfast was ready for me as I re-entered the house, and again\r\nthe pretty damsels waited on me without the presence of their father;\r\nand though I had lost my heart (it was an easy matter in those days)\r\nto the blue-eyed little maiden, I refrained from saying more than\r\nexpressions of thanks in the most polite Turkish, keeping steadfastly\r\nin mind that an ‘English gentleman is an honourable man.’\r\n\r\nOn going away, the Bey accompanied me to the door, and whilst I\r\nreiterated my warmest thanks, he put into my hand a little sealed\r\npacket, observing, ‘You will pardon me for returning the handsome\r\n“bakshish” you had directed the Greek to distribute amongst my\r\ndependants. The latter have made known and returned to me what they\r\nhad received; I shall reward them, but I cannot allow that you should\r\ndo so. It would have given me,’ he added, ‘great pain if they had\r\nretained the money, and it would have deprived me of the pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction I have felt in welcoming an Englishman to my house.’\r\nI said not a word, and put the money into my pocket. As I left the\r\nhouse I could not help looking back as long as the lattice windows\r\nwere in sight, and thought I espied bright eyes peering out at the\r\nparting guest; but I refrained from waving hand or handkerchief.\r\n\r\nSir Stratford Canning, to whom I related this adventure confidentially\r\non my arrival, made known to the Porte that I had received hospitality\r\nand great kindness from this Bey when benighted on my return from\r\nBroussa, and expressed a hope that the Porte would in some suitable\r\nform mark approval of such kindness shown to a member of the Embassy.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Government announced their satisfaction and thanks\r\nfor the report I had presented, through the Ambassador, giving the\r\nresult of my inquiry into the conduct of Pasha and Consul, and sent\r\nto H.E. a Sultan’s ‘berat’ or edict, placing the Bey under\r\nthe special protection of the Porte and of His Imperial Majesty, and\r\nrecommending him to the good offices of the Pasha and other officials.\r\n\r\nThis ‘berat’ I forwarded in a letter to the Bey; but, alas! I\r\ncould not send the messages I should have wished to have done to\r\nFatima and the ‘dil bere’ (heart-robber) Aisha.\r\n\r\nThat year Sir Stratford Canning, accompanied by all his family and\r\nall the members of the Embassy except myself, who was left in charge\r\nfor a few days, made an excursion to Broussa and were received with\r\ngreat attention and hospitality by the Pasha. In 1844 the latter\r\nwas removed from his government and returned to Constantinople,\r\nwhere he resided in a large kiosk on the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1844, having obtained leave of absence from Her\r\nMajesty’s Government, I made arrangements to embark in a French\r\nsteamer bound for Marseilles.\r\n\r\nOn taking leave of the Ambassador, he told me he had ordered his\r\n‘kaik’ to convey me from Buyukdere, where his Excellency\r\nthen resided, to the steamer in Pera harbour, but that he was\r\nanxious I should call on the ex-Pasha of Broussa and present to\r\nhim a gold chronometer, worth about £60, as a token of his—Sir\r\nStratford’s—friendship, and acknowledgement of the hospitality\r\nshown to himself and family on his visit.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency added, ‘I am especially anxious you should present\r\nthis gift, and renew your acquaintance with the Pasha, and thus\r\nremove any feeling that might possibly exist in his mind regarding\r\nthe inquiry made by you into his and the Consul’s conduct, and the\r\ndecision that was come to by the Porte in consequence of your report;\r\nfor the Pasha will probably be employed again by the Government,\r\nand when you return to the Embassy it is desirable that you should\r\nboth be on friendly terms.’ In pursuance of these instructions I\r\ncalled on the Pasha, who received me very kindly and told me he had\r\na lively recollection of my visit to Broussa, and of my statement\r\nin the report that both he and the Consul were in the wrong and had\r\nbeen quarrelling upon trivial matters.\r\n\r\nHe laughed and added, ‘You were quite right; the Consul and I\r\nmade it up and became good friends, so I feel indebted to you for\r\nnot having unduly taken the part of your Consul.’\r\n\r\nI presented the chronometer, with a suitable message from the\r\nAmbassador, and then told the Pasha I could not wait for the usual\r\npipes and coffee, as I had to embark in a steamer which was about\r\nto start. He replied that he should only detain me for a moment,\r\nand left the room. He returned immediately, bringing a small green\r\nleathern case, suspended in a little muslin kerchief, which he put\r\ninto my hands, saying, ‘You are going to your own country and you\r\nmay not return, so I beg you to keep this as a little souvenir of\r\nmy friendship.’\r\n\r\nThough I knew not what were the contents of the leathern case,\r\nI thought by the shape it was a ‘finjan’ or Turkish saucer for\r\nholding a small cup; but as it is against the established regulations\r\nfor a diplomatic officer to accept presents from a foreign official,\r\nI told the Pasha my scruples, and that it would affect me injuriously\r\nif I accepted even the smallest gift.\r\n\r\nHe said all he could to induce me to waive my objection; but finding\r\nme resolute, he became very grave, took the little muslin kerchief\r\ncontaining the case from me, as I held it towards him, and handed me\r\nback at the same time the case containing the watch, saying that ‘if\r\na Secretary of the Embassy cannot receive a little token of friendship\r\non going away, from a man who no longer holds any appointment,\r\nneither can I, a retired Governor, accept this chronometer from the\r\nAmbassador; have the goodness to make this known to his Excellency,\r\nwith my best thanks and excuses.’ As I felt that Sir Stratford\r\nwould be excessively annoyed if the gift were returned, and might\r\nthink I had not managed to present the gift in a proper manner,\r\nI came (after some parley) to a compromise with the Pasha, that he\r\nshould retain the chronometer and I his gift; that I should write\r\na note at once to the Ambassador explaining all that had happened,\r\nand dispatch it to his Excellency by the ‘kaik’ that brought\r\nme; that if the Ambassador disapproved of my accepting the gift\r\nI should be allowed to return it to the Pasha, with a letter of\r\nexplanation, and in such case he would retain the chronometer;\r\nbut if his Excellency approved, there was an end of the matter,\r\nand under any circumstances, I told the Pasha, I was much pleased\r\nand most grateful for his kind intention.\r\n\r\nI sent off the ‘kaik’ to the Embassy, and proceeded in another\r\nto the French steamer, which was about to leave. On getting into the\r\n‘kaik,’ I opened the little leather case. It contained a small\r\ngold ‘finjan’ encrusted with rose diamonds, worth about £70.\r\n\r\nJust as the steamer was on the point of leaving, the Ambassador’s\r\n‘kaik’ came alongside, with a messenger bringing a note\r\nfrom Lady Stratford Canning. The note stated that the Ambassador\r\nentirely approved all I had done, and directed that I should keep\r\nthe Pasha’s gift.\r\n\r\nOn my way to England I stopped at Paris for a few days to make the\r\nacquaintance of Admiral Lalande, who had commanded the French fleet\r\nwhich had been sent to Besika Bay during the Egyptian question in\r\n1840. He was married to the sister of my brother-in-law, the late\r\nM. Mauboussin.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral received me very cordially. He was looking ill, and\r\ntold me it was probable that he would be in his grave before the\r\nend of three weeks, as he was suffering from an internal disease\r\nand lived entirely upon milk. He was not confined to his couch but\r\nwalked about the room whilst conversing, as if full of vigour both\r\nin mind and body. He asked me if I should see, whilst in London, Lord\r\nPonsonby; saying he was very anxious to send him ‘the message of a\r\ndying man.’ I replied that I should make a point of calling on his\r\nLordship, from whom I had received much kindness. The Admiral then\r\nobserved that he entertained the highest opinion of Lord Ponsonby,\r\nthough he was aware that he had successfully opposed French views\r\nand projects in Egypt, and had assumed an ascendency over the minds\r\nof the Sultan and his advisers which redounded to his credit as a\r\ndiplomatist, though antagonistic to France.\r\n\r\n‘From the fact,’ said the Admiral, ‘of my having such a high\r\nopinion of the character of your Ambassador, it has been very painful\r\nto me to have learnt, from communications which have been imparted\r\nto me by my Government, that Lord Ponsonby is under the impression\r\nthat I took a prominent part in inducing the Turkish Admiral to be\r\na traitor to his sovereign and deliver over the Turkish fleet to\r\nMehemet Ali. It was of course,’ he said, ‘an event to which much\r\nimportance was attached by those who had desired to support Mehemet\r\nAli’s independence; but,’ he added, ‘no possible advantage to\r\nFrench interests would ever have induced me to advise or encourage any\r\nman to turn traitor to his sovereign, and I hold the Turkish Admiral\r\nin utter contempt for that act of infamy. I am now,’ he continued,\r\n‘as I have told you, a dying man; in a few days you will hear I have\r\npassed away, and I desire that you should convey to Lord Ponsonby\r\nthe following message:—“I swear, as a dying man, that whatever\r\nmay have been done by other French officials, I took no part in the\r\nmatter, nor indeed was I aware, until the Turkish fleet was delivered\r\nover to Mehemet Ali, of the intention of the Turkish Admiral.”\r\n\r\n‘It is my anxious desire, as I have the highest opinion of Lord\r\nPonsonby as an honourable man, that any erroneous impression on\r\nthis subject should be removed from his mind before I die, and\r\nthat he should give me credit also for being an honourable man,\r\nand incapable of counselling any one to turn traitor to his sovereign.\r\n\r\n‘Take his Lordship,’ he added, ‘this message, and let me know\r\nbefore I die whether he gives credence to my declaration.’ This\r\nI promised to do.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Lalande related to me that, during the time the French and\r\nBritish fleet lay together in Besika Bay, he had become very intimate\r\nwith Admiral Sir Robert Stopford, that they dined frequently together\r\nand had become fast friends.\r\n\r\nHe observed that I was no doubt aware that it was then expected,\r\nat any moment, that a declaration of war would take place, and that\r\nan engagement would follow between the two fleets. ‘It is all\r\nsettled now,’ he said, ‘and we are at peace, so I can tell you\r\nconfidentially that we two old men talked over the probability of a\r\nsudden declaration of war one evening after dinner, and as we each\r\nexpressed a sincere desire that no undue advantage should be taken by\r\neither through receiving earlier tidings of a rupture, we concerted\r\nthat a private signal should be hoisted on our respective flagships,\r\nthe object of which should be unknown to the officers of our fleets,\r\nwhen either of us received tidings that war was declared, so that each\r\nmight be prepared, without undue advantage, to take measures for a\r\nfair fight. Every morning and evening we were wont to look for this\r\nsignal. At that time,’ the admiral continued, ‘the French fleet\r\nwas in first-rate order, and we had one vessel more than the English\r\nat anchor, as the latter had a vessel or two on the coast of Egypt.\r\n\r\n‘Your fleet,’ he said, ‘was also in admirable order, but we\r\nwere quite your match; and I tell you frankly that though I have\r\nno unfriendly feeling towards your nation, I die a disappointed man\r\nin that I lost the opportunity of a fight; for I had hoped, if not\r\nvictorious, to have been able to wage such a battle as would have\r\nwiped out the defeats our squadrons and ships had almost always\r\nexperienced in the last great war.’\r\n\r\nLord Ponsonby was in town when I arrived; he took the greatest\r\ninterest in the message I brought him, and requested me to inform\r\nAdmiral Lalande it was perfectly correct that he had been led to\r\nbelieve he had induced, or secretly encouraged, the Turkish Admiral\r\nto deliver up the fleet to Mehemet Ali; but that Admiral Lalande’s\r\ndeclaration was sufficient to convince him that he was mistaken,\r\nand that he greatly regretted having joined with others in putting\r\nforward such an accusation. He requested me also to say that he was\r\nmuch pleased and gratified that the Admiral should have desired to\r\nhave this matter cleared up, and told me to thank him and to express\r\na hope that he would yet live for many years to serve his country.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Admiral Lalande and made known Lord Ponsonby’s reply. My\r\nletter reached him a few days before his death, which occurred within\r\nthe three weeks, as he had prognosticated.\r\n\r\nIn the same year I was directed, by order of Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment, to accompany Colonel Barnett to Egypt, on his appointment\r\nas Political Agent and Consul-General, and remained there several\r\nmonths. After a few weeks’ residence at Cairo, I was offered by\r\nLord Palmerston, through Colonel Barnett, the post of Consul at\r\nAlexandria, which the latter endeavoured to persuade me to accept\r\nas he urged it would lead to my being appointed his successor;\r\nbut the climate of Egypt did not agree with me and I declined,\r\npreferring to return to the Embassy at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nCommodore Porter was at this time Minister of the United States\r\nat Constantinople.\r\n\r\nHe was a distinguished officer, who had rendered important services\r\nduring the war with Great Britain. The commodore was very eccentric,\r\na type of the rough sailor of by-gone days, but pleasant and amusing,\r\nand, when spinning yarns about actions between British and United\r\nStates ships, always careful to avoid—even when the story related\r\nregarded the capture by himself of one of our ships—any expression\r\nwhich he thought might wound my susceptibilities as a ‘Britisher.’\r\n\r\nHe lived at San Stefano, a village about ten miles from\r\nConstantinople. I had made the acquaintance of his nephew,\r\nMr. George Porter, the Secretary of the United States Legation,\r\nwho frequently invited me—when there was a passage of quail—to\r\na day’s shooting and to dinner with his uncle; but I was the only\r\nmember of the Diplomatic Corps at Constantinople thus favoured.\r\n\r\nSince he had presented his credentials to the Sultan, and made the\r\nusual formal visits to his colleagues, he called upon no one—not\r\neven upon the Vizir or any member of the Turkish Government.\r\n\r\nOne day, after dinner, I happened to relate to the Commodore a\r\npolitical event that had recently occurred, in which he appeared\r\nto take great interest; so, finding him in good humour, I took the\r\nliberty of observing that, as he had mentioned he never visited or\r\nreceived visits from members of the Turkish Government or of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps, I thought he must find it a difficult matter to\r\nkeep his Government properly and correctly informed upon passing\r\nevents, which were at that time of the greatest importance to the\r\npolitical world.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore replied, his eyes twinkling with humour, ‘I am very\r\ncareful to keep my Government fully informed of all that takes place,\r\nand I receive replies expressing satisfaction with my interesting\r\nreports and the foresight they declare I show in predicting events\r\nwhich are likely to happen.’\r\n\r\n‘Now,’ said the Commodore, ‘I will make known to you, in the\r\ngreatest confidence, how I acquire the information which enables me\r\nto draw up those very able reports. I take _Galignani’s Messenger_,\r\nwhich reaches me regularly, and this paper—as you know—contains\r\nextracts from the English and foreign journals, with reports\r\nfrom their correspondents at Constantinople, regarding the various\r\nquestions which are taking place and other occurrences of a political\r\ncharacter. I have all these under my careful consideration, and,\r\nassisted by the local knowledge of my nephew, draw my conclusions\r\nand transmit, with some slight alteration in language, copies of\r\nthe articles which appear in the _Galignani_. I may be sometimes\r\nthree or four days later than my colleagues in forwarding reports of\r\npassing events to our respective Governments, but I flatter myself\r\nthat the digest of the views entertained by the able reporters at\r\nConstantinople is preferable to, and less likely to mislead the\r\nUnited States Government than the reports which many of my excellent\r\ncolleagues, carried away sometimes by personal motives, may transmit\r\nto their Governments.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                          MISSION TO TANGIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Mr. Hay went to England on leave, and visited also Stockholm\r\nand Copenhagen. At this latter capital he met the ‘fair girl’\r\nwho was to be his future wife, as Leila had predicted. Whilst\r\nin Stockholm, he was presented to King Oscar by our Minister,\r\nMr. Cartwright, and in the course of conversation with His Majesty\r\nabout Morocco, pointed out the advisability of abolishing the old\r\nConvention between Morocco and Sweden, and Morocco and Denmark,\r\nwhich stipulated that $25,000 (£5,000) should be paid annually\r\nto the Sultan, in order that vessels under the flags of these two\r\nnations should pass the Straits unmolested by Moorish cruisers; these\r\ncruisers having virtually ceased to exist, though the Convention\r\nremained in force.\r\n\r\nA rupture of relations between France and Morocco was at this time\r\nimminent, and Mr. Hay’s father, then Political Agent at Tangier,\r\nhad been sent, with the knowledge of the French Government, to the\r\ncity of Marákesh on a mission to endeavour to induce the Sultan\r\nto accept the French demands. On hearing of this expedition Mr. Hay\r\nwrote to Lord Aberdeen, who was then Secretary for Foreign Affairs,\r\nto offer his services temporarily in Morocco. This offer was accepted.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Hay, while at Constantinople, had gained the kindly opinion\r\nof Sir Stratford and Lady Canning may be gathered from the following\r\nletter written to him after his departure from Constantinople, when\r\nLady Canning learnt that he had been sent to Tangier. The note was\r\naccompanied by the gift of a beautiful cushion in Turkish embroidery.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must not leave Constantinople, my dear Mr. Hay, without some\r\nlittle memento from me to remind you in future days of our life\r\nspent together on the Bosphorus in which, though it may have had\r\nsome cloudy moments, I hope the bright ones have preponderated and\r\nwill alone be remembered by you. We shall miss you sadly; for your\r\nlabours have not been thrown away on Sir Stratford, and you have\r\nhelped to keep us all in good humour with our neighbours, and for\r\nall this I thank you much. Let us hear of you often, and believe\r\nthat we shall feel interest in all that concerns you.\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                        E. C. CANNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hay arrived at Tangier shortly after the bombardment of that town\r\nby the Prince de Joinville. Notwithstanding the promises made by the\r\nFrench Government that hostilities should not be commenced until his\r\nfather returned from the Court, where he had actually succeeded in\r\nobtaining consent to the chief demands of the French, the Prince\r\nhad bombarded Tangier. This unexpected outbreak of hostilities\r\nplaced in jeopardy the life of the elder Mr. Hay, who was still in\r\nthe interior and who had to pass, on his return from Marákesh to\r\nTangier, through districts inhabited by wild tribes.\r\n\r\nSome of the difficulties with which his father had been confronted\r\nin dealing with the Sultan are touched on in the following letter\r\nwritten on the return journey from his mission to Marákesh, dated\r\nCamp on the Wad Nefis, July 26, 1844:—\r\n\r\n\r\n’Tis a sad thing that all folks in Europe, my masters in Downing\r\nStreet may not be excepted, have hardly any just conception of the\r\ndifficulties of my position. It would take a volume—not small—to\r\nrelate the bother and the tricks and bad faith with which I have had\r\nto contend—and as to _going fast_, as Mr. Bulwer has everlastingly\r\nurged, who among mortal men can make Moors go fast, nay, nor hardly\r\nmove at all—in the straight path of honour and sound policy? . . .\r\n\r\nAlas! I know not what to think. I had hoped the French would have\r\nwaited until my report reached Tangier or myself arrived there and\r\ntold them all. So they are now preparing to cast fire and the sword\r\non this unhappy country of ignorant barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe Moors are mere children, vain children; obstinate, through\r\na shocking bigotry and ignorance scarcely credible. They have,\r\nI believe, had at least two collisions with the French on their\r\nfrontier; but all their acts of folly were, I am certain, without\r\nauthority. Alas, again, for the poor Sultan; he cannot manage his\r\nown people! If the war do burst forth here, when shall it end? There\r\nwill be an internal revolution forthwith, I am almost sure! And\r\ndrivellers in pomposity and self-sufficiency would ever publish that\r\nall was well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Hay did not long survive the effects of the journey,\r\nwith all its worry and vexation; but succumbed shortly after his\r\nreturn, to low fever and other complaints. During his illness, which\r\nlasted several months, Mr. John Hay was directed by Lord Aberdeen to\r\ntake charge of political affairs in Morocco, whilst Mr. H. Murray,\r\nthe Consul, conducted the consular duties.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was one of considerable importance. In addition to the\r\ninternal difficulties of Morocco, questions with foreign Powers\r\nembarrassed the Sultan’s Government. Denmark and Sweden had sent\r\nsquadrons in this year to Moorish waters, demanding the abrogation\r\nof the treaty referred to in Mr. Hay’s audience of King Oscar.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government had also a question pending with Morocco\r\nregarding the neutral ground and frontier of Ceuta; and, for the\r\nsettlement of this question, Sir Henry Bulwer, then H.B.M.’s\r\nMinister at Madrid, had been appointed special Plenipotentiary.\r\n\r\nIn the following letter to his late chief at Constantinople Mr. Hay\r\ngives an account of the state of affairs which he found on his\r\narrival at Tangier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _Sept. 12_, 1844.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR STRATFORD,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday Y.E.’s kind letter of 27th ult.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will no doubt have learnt, both from H.M.’s\r\nGovernment and the newspapers, accounts of passing events in this\r\ncountry, so I only relate the more recent that I have witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday the French squadron arrived, consisting\r\nof two line-of-battle ships and five steamers, having on board the\r\nPrince de Joinville, Mons. de Nion, the French Chargé d’Affaires,\r\nand the Duc de Glücksberg (Decazes), an adjunct Plenipotentiary sent\r\nfor the purpose of meeting the Moorish Plenipotentiary, Sid Buselham\r\nBen Ali, to arrange the conditions for peace. I received, the same\r\nmorning, a letter from Mr. Bulwer acquainting me with the nature of\r\nthe French demands, which proved to be identic with those already\r\ngranted to my father by the Sultan of Morocco during his late mission.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish Plenipotentiary, Sid Buselham, has received orders from\r\nthe Sultan to be guided by our counsels in replying to the various\r\ndemands of the French. I accordingly went to see the Sid and made\r\nknown to him the nature of the French demands, telling him they were\r\njust and such as could be granted without lowering the dignity of the\r\nSultan. I pointed out the proper answers to be made, and urged him\r\nto settle the matter the very day that the demands were presented;\r\nand thus it happened that three hours did not elapse from the time\r\nthey were made, until the French flag was hoisted and flying at\r\nthe Residence of their Chargé d’Affaires and was saluted by\r\nthe batteries.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the demands was as follows:—\r\n\r\n‘That Abd-el-Kader be considered as a common enemy and, if taken by\r\neither party, be confined in a State prison at some distant port. The\r\nfrontier to be marked out as in the time of the Turks. The withdrawal\r\nof the French troops from Ujda, except 3,000 men. A new treaty to\r\nbe made embracing the above conditions, and, when ratified, Ujda\r\nand the Island of Mogador are to be given up by the French and all\r\nprisoners exchanged and set free.\r\n\r\nThe question that may now be asked is—What has been the object\r\nof the French in all this? For their demands remain the same and\r\nthe concessions are the same as _before the war_: and although they\r\nsay the Sultan is faithless, they never gave time to test whether he\r\nwould be so or not, after having pledged himself to a British agent\r\nto act with good faith—but this, it strikes me, is the sore point.\r\n\r\nFrench supremacy is aimed at, throughout Eastern and Western Barbary,\r\nand an arrangement effected through the good offices of a British\r\nagent militates against that supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe foolish language of a British officer high in rank, on the other\r\nside of the water, declaring that England would never allow a gun\r\nto be fired at a Moorish port, roused the worst feelings towards\r\nus throughout the French squadron, participated in by the Prince;\r\nso, five hours before my father’s arrival from the Moorish Court\r\n(although hourly expected, and feeling that to bombard Tangier after\r\nhearing vivâ voce that the Sultan had granted their demands, would be\r\n_un peu trop fort_), having bombarded Tangier in the presence of two\r\nBritish ships of war and, I may say, of our garrison at Gibraltar,\r\noff they go to Mogador—the _mouth_, as the Moors call it, of\r\nBritish commerce with Central Africa, where we have a considerable\r\ntrade. They destroy the forts, and the destruction of the town\r\nis completed by the wild tribes, who burn, pillage, and murder,\r\ncommitting barbarities on a par with the wanton and uncalled-for\r\nproceedings of the French. After striking this blow at British trade,\r\nthe French embark and return here to make peace!!\r\n\r\nWell it is, that peace is made; for the country is in a state of\r\nrevolution; the Sultan totters on his throne, and in a few weeks\r\nsuch a state of anarchy would have ensued that no Europeans could\r\nhave remained in the country. There would have been no Government\r\nto treat with, and of the five millions of people, only robbers and\r\npirates would have come to the front.\r\n\r\nHow would England have liked this? How would other countries? How\r\nwould France?—pledged as she is to us not to take possession of\r\nany part of Morocco. What would she gain but to have roused a spirit\r\nof revenge amongst these wild inhabitants of a country capable of\r\nmaintaining ten Abd-el-Kaders, as soon as they learn how to war\r\nwith disciplined armies? An army of 20,000 men, well disciplined,\r\nmight march from one end of the Empire to the other, but to _hold_\r\nthe country 200,000 would not suffice.\r\n\r\nThe French interest, therefore, was not to have weakened the\r\nSultan’s power, but to have given him time to put in execution his\r\npromises and to have helped him in so doing, if required; but the\r\nshaft was shot at ‘Albion la perfide’—Albion, whose agent here,\r\never since the conquest of Algiers, has been instructed to hold,\r\nand has held, but one language, that of urging the Sultan not to\r\ngive ground of offence to his powerful neighbour, and above all not\r\nto support or mix himself up with Abd-el-Kader.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish affair is also concluded. My father brought back very\r\nfull concessions, and on Mr. Bulwer’s arrival at Gibraltar, with\r\nfull powers from Spain, all matters were settled at once by the\r\nMoors, and I had the satisfaction of having used my humble efforts\r\nin effecting this.\r\n\r\nThe Danish and Swedish affairs are in a fair way of being settled\r\namicably, and, although I must not blow my own trumpet, yet I am\r\nsure your Excellency will be pleased to learn that I have gained\r\nsome credit at home for the part I have taken in these affairs which,\r\nin consequence of my father’s serious illness, have been entirely\r\nunder my guidance, as being the sole medium of communication both\r\nverbally and in writing. I can assure your Excellency that I daily\r\nfeel the benefit reaped from the excellent school of diplomacy in\r\nwhich I passed my probation in the East; and if I have been of use\r\nto Her Majesty’s Government, the lessons I there learnt have been\r\nmy guide; if I have failed, it has been my own fault.\r\n\r\nThere is one more remark which I wish to add—that I look upon\r\nMorocco as a field upon which there will often be like cause for\r\nanxiety to Europe, and especially to Great Britain; and how can\r\nit be otherwise when we consider the conflicting characters of the\r\npeople on the frontier? Such being the case, it becomes more urgent\r\nthan ever that some understanding be come to with France by England,\r\nfor preserving the integrity of this Empire, and that their agents\r\nhere should be persons that act up to the peaceful spirit of their\r\ninstructions—otherwise a bone of dissension will ever be found in\r\nWest Barbary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to his father’s illness and subsequent death, the settlement\r\nof the complicated questions alluded to in this letter devolved\r\non Mr. Hay. In this task he acquitted himself with credit, as is\r\nproved by the satisfaction of his official chief at Madrid, and\r\nthe recognition of his services by the foreign Powers for whom he\r\nacted. Mr. Bulwer wrote to congratulate him on his success:—‘Your\r\nconduct and explanations are equally good, and I am _gratified_\r\nwith you beyond measure. There is nothing to change in your views\r\nor intuitions.’\r\n\r\nAgain in a later letter, Mr. Bulwer repeats the expression of his\r\nsatisfaction:—‘I have a great regard for you, and a high opinion\r\nof you, and, whenever it is in my power, will do you a service. Be\r\nsure of success; I am for you. All of us have had to contend with\r\ndifficulties.’\r\n\r\nMr. Hay further received the thanks of the different Governments\r\nconcerned, and the Kings of Denmark and Sweden sent him jewelled\r\nstars, as Commander of the Orders of the Danebrog, and of the Polar\r\nStar respectively. These, according to Foreign Office regulations,\r\nhe declined, as also the Spanish Order of Charles XII. Subsequently\r\nhe received, from the two former sovereigns, magnificent gifts of\r\nplate, which H.B.M.’s Government authorised him to accept.\r\n\r\nSome notes relating to this time, made by Mr. Hay in after years,\r\nmay prove of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the time of Sultan Mulai Abderahman it was not infrequent to hear\r\nthat some Basha, or Sheikh, who may have been supposed to have taken\r\npart in an insurrection or given other serious cause for displeasure\r\nto the Sultan, was summoned to the Court, and placed in confinement.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Mul Meshwa’ or chief Usher of the Court acted on such\r\noccasions as executioner, and bearing a cup of coffee, would visit\r\nthe victim and say, ‘Our Lord and Master sends you this,’ adding\r\nperemptorily, should the unfortunate man hesitate, ‘Drink: it is\r\nour Lord’s order. You are in the hands of God. What is written\r\nis written.’\r\n\r\nDuring the time that Abd-el-Kader carried on hostilities against the\r\nFrench in Algeria, Sultan Mulai Abderahman had given strict orders\r\nto his Ministers and Governors not to hold any communication with\r\nthis active and daring chief, as H.M. feared the French might find\r\nsome pretext for a quarrel with Morocco.\r\n\r\nSid Mohammed Ben Dris, a very clever man, was at that time chief Uzir,\r\nand was suspected of being in communication with Abd-el-Kader, and\r\neven of having suggested to him that (as he thought it most probable\r\nAbd-el-Kader would succeed in turning the French out of Algeria)\r\nhe should enter Morocco, upset the Sultan, and usurp the throne.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that, had Abd-el-Kader listened to these\r\nsuggestions, he might have succeeded in such an enterprise.\r\n\r\nA courier, who had been dispatched secretly by the Uzir to\r\nAbd-el-Kader, was arrested by the Governor of ‘Hiazna’: his\r\nletters seized and sent direct to the Sultan. Amongst them, the\r\nSultan found a letter from Ben Dris to Abd-el-Kader with treasonable\r\npropositions. Ben Dris was summoned to the presence of the Sultan,\r\nwho exhibited to him his letters asking, ‘Whose handwriting is\r\nthis?’ Ben Dris threw himself at the feet of the Sultan, crying out,\r\n‘Amán (mercy)! It is mine.’ ‘You are a vile traitor,’ said\r\nH.M. ‘Approach; put out that tongue with which you solemnly swore,\r\nonly the other day, you had never written, and would never write,\r\nto Abd-el-Kader.’\r\n\r\nThe Uzir put out his tongue, of which the Sultan took hold and,\r\nwith one wrench, tore[5] it from its socket, leaving the tongue\r\nparalysed and useless. ‘Go,’ said the Sultan; ‘your tongue\r\ncan no longer lie.’\r\n\r\nThe Uzir withdrew, his tongue swelled in a frightful manner, and\r\nhe died shortly afterwards in great agonies; but few persons at the\r\ntime knew the cause of his disgrace and death.\r\n\r\nFrench journals, and Frenchmen in general, accused the British\r\nGovernment and their Representative in Morocco of being in\r\ncommunication with Abd-el-Kader, and even of sending emissaries and\r\nmoney to assist that chief in carrying on hostilities against the\r\nFrench. But the accusations were without the slightest foundation,\r\nand though on one occasion Abd-el-Kader addressed me a letter\r\nasking for British intervention on his behalf, no reply was sent\r\nnor was any notice taken of his communication, and certainly not\r\none farthing was ever given by our Government to this gallant and\r\npatriotic chief. On the other hand, advice was unceasingly tendered\r\nto the Moorish Government by my father, and subsequently by myself,\r\nthat they should hold no communication with Abd-el-Kader or his\r\nfollowers, and should oppose his making the Rif country a basis for\r\nhostile operations against the French, when driven out of Algeria.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hay’s appointment at Tangier was as yet only a temporary\r\none. His chief at Constantinople, who evidently awaited his return,\r\nwrites in December, 1844:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you have won such golden opinions in Spain\r\nand in Downing Street, and for your sake I shall be glad to learn\r\nthat promotion was the result. But as the last letters from the\r\nForeign Office speak of you as first attaché to this Embassy on\r\nAlison’s apotheosis, I presume that you are to return, at least\r\nfor the present, and that being the case, I shall be glad to have\r\nyour services as soon as you can conveniently return to us. Napier\r\nis going home to be married. . . . Add to this that I have lots of\r\nbusiness in hand, and very important business too. As Pisani is in\r\nthe Chancery as of yore, I will avail myself of your help with less\r\nsacrifice of your eyes, and hazard to your health.\r\n\r\nI hope you will be able to read these hieroglyphics. Believe me very\r\nsincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                                 S. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reference to ‘less sacrifice to your eyes,’ it may be\r\ninferred, was a jesting allusion to an occurrence which had taken\r\nplace at Stambul, when Mr. Hay was Acting Private Secretary. The\r\nstory is told by Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole, in his _Life of Sir\r\nS. Canning_, how the fiery Ambassador and his not less hot-headed\r\nyoung attaché, both worn out with over-work, lost their tempers\r\nand their self-control[6].\r\n\r\nIn 1845, Mr. Hay succeeded his father as Political Agent and\r\nConsul-General in Morocco. As will be gathered from the following\r\nletter addressed to him by Lord Ponsonby, congratulating him on his\r\nappointment, Mr. Hay considered that in diverging from the direct\r\nline of a diplomatic career by becoming Agent and Consul-General,\r\nhe endangered his hopes of future advancement. But he decided on\r\nincurring this risk, in order to assist his widowed mother, who had\r\nbeen left with slender means, by undertaking the education of his\r\nyounger brothers. For many years he devoted half his salary to this\r\nobject, and, at a later period, to starting them in life or assisting\r\nany member of his family who was in need of aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have been wishing,’ wrote Lord Ponsonby in April, 1845, ‘ever\r\nsince I heard of your appointment, to write to you and say how very\r\nmuch I rejoiced at it, but I fancied it might be more prudent to\r\nhold my tongue; your letter of the 11th (received this night) has set\r\nme free, and I will declare my conviction that however advantageous\r\nyour nomination to the important post may be to yourself, the English\r\nGovernment will find it more so for their own objects. Your intimate\r\nknowledge of the country where you are to serve, and I will add,\r\nyour talents, your zeal, your courage and honesty and manner, such\r\nas I know them to be, will enable you to overcome difficulties which\r\nmight be held insuperable; and I suspect that the time will come\r\nwhen you will have to encounter them. Aberdeen is a kind man, and\r\nI have no doubt of his considering your father’s services as they\r\ndeserve to be considered, but I am very sure he would not have shown\r\nhis estimation of them in the way he has done, unless he had cause\r\nto know and to appreciate the capacity of _the father’s son_. Have\r\nno fear that “the door of ambition is closed against you.” _I_\r\nthink it is opened wide to you now; there will be plenty of room\r\nfor the display of your judgment and activity in the management\r\nof questions of great importance, and as I feel confident you will\r\nsucceed, I entertain no doubt of your mounting to what are called\r\nhigher posts, though I _do_ doubt if you will find any of them\r\ndemanding more skill and vigour in the occupier than you will be\r\ncalled upon to display where you now are.\r\n\r\n‘Your most kind remembrance of the time we passed together gives\r\nme very great pleasure; you are a man to make the most profit of\r\nexperience, and in that time I allude to, many affairs well worth\r\nnoting were in fermentation. I am too wise (excuse this vanity)\r\nto attribute to myself anything more than honesty and good fortune\r\nas the cause of the success that attended the Embassy, and it is\r\nclaiming a great deal too much I fear. I will accept, gratefully,\r\nthe kind things you say of me personally, and I am happy to know\r\nthat my manner to you (for there were no deeds) showed the feeling\r\nof friendship for you which sprung up in me from my observation of\r\nyour good qualities.\r\n\r\n‘Lady Ponsonby is well, and at this moment I hope amusing herself\r\nat a ball at Lady Palmerston’s. I will give your message to her\r\nwhen she comes home, and I am sure she will be most happy to receive\r\nit. She has shared in my rejoicings for your advancement.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  POLITICAL AGENT AT TANGIER AND FIRST MISSION TO MARÁKESH. 1845-46.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1845, Mr. Hay writes as follows to the\r\nHon. A. Gordon:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been daily expecting a summons ‘_to the Court exalted of\r\nthe Lord_’ (_par excellence_), but His Sherifian Majesty has made a\r\nmove from the city of Meknes, fearing, I suppose, to be _stalemated_\r\nby the knight Bugeaud and his ten thousand pawns.\r\n\r\nBy latest accounts from the interior the Sultan has arrived at\r\nthe united town of Rabat and Salli, the latter famous, as you may\r\nremember, in days of yore for its dreaded rovers.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow I expect a courier from the Sultan which will decide,\r\nI hope, the time and place for my visit to His Majesty, and, when\r\n_en route_, I hope to be able to better amuse you by some accounts\r\nof this ‘barbarous’ people.\r\n\r\nYou ask whether I think the Moors will submit to be ‘_peaceably\r\ninvaded_’ by the French in their ‘chasse’ of Abd-el-Kader? My\r\nanswer is in the negative, and I fear that such invasion will produce\r\na most complicated state of affairs throughout this Empire, which\r\nmight hereafter create a question of grave importance.\r\n\r\nThe French start from a wrong principle in their mania for destroying\r\nAbd-el-Kader; for if this French hydra were killed to-morrow, few\r\nmonths would elapse before another arose. It is to the hostile and\r\nfanatical feeling of the inhabitants that they must attribute all\r\ntheir troubles, and until they find a better cure for this feeling\r\nthan a system of violence and retaliation, battle and murder will\r\nnever cease in that territory as long as an armed Arab exists.\r\n\r\nWhen Algiers was first taken, my late father, who was an old\r\nsoldier, and knew the character of the Arab, remarked to the French\r\nChargé d’Affaires, who was boasting of the importance of their\r\nnewly-acquired colony, that ‘it would prove a very dear conquest,’\r\nand that he felt positive that ‘before twenty years elapsed,\r\na hundred thousand men would be required to hold the country, and\r\nthat each year would bring fresh demands for troops, not to protect\r\ntheir colonists, but to destroy the Arabs.’\r\n\r\nAnother evil for the French Government is that the military chiefs,\r\nsent to fight in Africa, know that if there be no Abd-el-Kader there\r\nwill be _no Duc d’Isly, no ‘gloire,’ no crosses_. Were either\r\nLouis Philippe, or Guizot, Governor of Algiers, I could foresee\r\nsomething like future tranquillity; but at present I look forward\r\nto a series of events, upon which I could write chapters, that will\r\nrender necessary either the conquest of Morocco by the French, or\r\nthe limitation, for another score of years, of their possessions to\r\nwithin a day’s journey of the coast.\r\n\r\nI must not be more explicit on this subject, or you would think me\r\nperhaps to be trespassing on the limits of what a servant of the\r\npublic is not justified in writing thus privately. . . .\r\n\r\nHere at once, in a three hours’ sail from Gibraltar, you are\r\ntransported, as if by enchantment, a thousand or two thousand years\r\nback, and you find yourself among the same people and the same\r\nstyle of living as you read of in the Scriptures. The Bible and the\r\n‘Arabian Nights’ are your best handbooks, and would best prepare\r\nyou for the scene. Lane’s most excellent work, on the ‘Customs\r\nand Manners of the Egyptians,’ is the most exact work I ever read\r\nof Mohammedan customs, and is very applicable to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hay started on his mission to Sultan Mulai Abderahman on March 3,\r\n1846. The following extracts are taken from letters addressed to his\r\nmother during the journey, and forwarded by her to the Hon. A. Gordon\r\nat Mr. Hay’s request.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am off for the exalted Court of His Sherifian Majesty Sultan\r\nMulai Abderahman, and alas! it is Tuesday, an unlucky day for ‘the\r\nfaithful’: for ‘Telatsa felatsa,’ say the Moors—on the third\r\nday (Tuesday) all fails; but good omens have attended the start,\r\nand, as I am taught by my favourite trooper, Kaid Abd-el-Kerim,\r\nnow snoring at my tent door, good omens such as I have experienced\r\nthis morning will counterbalance the unlucky day: ‘God forbid,’\r\nsaid he, ‘that its name should be repeated.’\r\n\r\nYes, as I put my foot in the stirrup, a holy dervish, one who would be\r\nprofanely called in Europe a madman, rushed up and threw his patchwork\r\nand party-coloured mantle over me, and, lifting up his hand towards\r\nheaven, cried out, ‘God’s blessing and the Sultan’s favour\r\nbe with you!’ I threw his Holiness a small coin, for no doubt\r\nI had deprived him of much virtue,—at least I should suppose so\r\nby the otherwise unaccountable creeping and itching I experienced;\r\nbut perhaps my fancy may have misled me.\r\n\r\nKaid ‘Bu Jebel’ (‘the Father of the Mountain,’ grandfather,\r\nI suppose, of the Mouse!), with his doughty followers, compose my\r\nescort—some thirty in all. I found them drawn up in zig-zag line\r\nin the little Sok (market-place), headed, though not commanded,\r\nby young Sid Abd-el-Malek, the son of my old friend Kaid Ben Abu,\r\ngovernor of Rif, who, at my particular request, is to accompany us.\r\n\r\nIn the outer market-place all the corps of foreign Representatives,\r\na host of chevaliers, but very _mal à cheval_, joined our party, and\r\na scene commenced, which continued till they left us, of snorting,\r\nrearing, kicking, and exclamations. Apologies, mille pardonizing,\r\n‘et mille et mille’ were offered, when the heels of one of their\r\nchargers passed within an inch of my knee-pan.\r\n\r\nPowder-play was commenced by the Kaid, and some of my colleagues\r\nbecame suddenly pedestrians. I think I can match any one of them\r\non horseback, although the pen may yield. God be praised! we parted\r\nwithout injury.\r\n\r\nAn honest countryman from the village of Suanni, on passing by,\r\noffered me his bowl of milk to drink. It was not to be refused, and\r\nas I lifted the weighty earthen vessel to my mouth, my horse made a\r\nslight plunge, and a copious libation gushed over my gilded armour[7]\r\nand accoutrements.\r\n\r\n‘Oh! what good fortune,’ shouted my escort. ‘Peace and\r\nplenty!’ Omen the second.\r\n\r\nOur baggage had started some time before us, and had halted at\r\n‘Ain Dalia,’ or ‘the fountain of the vine;’ the encampment,\r\nconsisting of some thirteen tents, enlivened the scene and the wild\r\ncountry around.\r\n\r\nA camp is a pretty sight, and these people, lately enfranchised,\r\nas it were, from their nomad life, well understand the arrangements\r\nand economy expedient on such occasions. Our nags were soon picketed\r\nround the tents, and the camp attendants, drawn up in line, called\r\ndown, as I approached, God’s blessing on their work, with a prayer\r\nfor a safe journey and return.\r\n\r\nA quarrel or two, with much screaming and uttering of the\r\nmost guttural sounds, followed this momentary calm. The Moors\r\nare children, and children will quarrel. Kaddor swore at the\r\nHadj’s great-great-grandmother, and the Hadj burnt all Kaddor’s\r\nancestors. Their friends intervened, and there was much mediation,\r\nbut peace could not be effected. My turn then came, and I said,\r\n‘God’s curse on the devil, who causes men’s hearts to be\r\nblackened by passion. Love each other, as God loveth you.’ So\r\nthe Hadj gave Kaddor a hearty buss, and Kaddor, with pouting lips,\r\nkissed the Hadj’s grizzly beard, and each cursed the devil.\r\n\r\nAt coffee time I invited the Kaids and the Taleb to sip with me,\r\nand wondrous tales ensued on their part, and in return I talked of\r\nStambul, its magnificence and fame.\r\n\r\nKaid Abd-el-Kerim informed me he commanded as ‘Kaid Erha,’\r\nor colonel, a body of cavalry at the battle of Isly in 1844, when\r\nMaréchal Bugeaud invaded Morocco with a force of twelve thousand\r\nmen and attacked the Sultan’s army.\r\n\r\nKaid Abd-el-Kerim described the strong position that Sid Mohammed,\r\nthe eldest son of Sultan Mulai Abderahman, had taken up with his\r\nforces on the brow of a hill, and how earthworks had been thrown up,\r\non which field-pieces were placed, under the command of a Spanish\r\nrenegade, who had been a sergeant of artillery in Spain. ‘But,’\r\nsaid the Kaid, ‘I do not consider the conflict with the French\r\ncan be called a battle.’\r\n\r\n‘How is that?’ I inquired, ‘for the Moorish forces were routed,\r\nthe Sultan’s camp and the field-pieces taken possession of.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said the Kaid. ‘Still I maintain it could not be\r\ncalled a battle, for we never had an opportunity of a fair fight,\r\nso as to be able to judge whether the Mussulmen or the French were\r\nthe braver warriors.’\r\n\r\nI then asked the Kaid to describe what took place, as also his\r\nreasons for not considering it a fair fight.\r\n\r\nThe Kaid replied: ‘When the French force first came in sight, at\r\na distance of about an hour’s walk (3½ miles), we observed that\r\nneither cavalry, infantry, nor artillery were spread out—as ought\r\nto be done—in line, before a battle. They had formed together a\r\ncompact mass like a “berod” (swarm of bees), and thus advanced\r\ntowards us without a halt, banners flying, and music playing. It\r\nwas a “fraja” (a very fine sight).\r\n\r\n‘Sid Mohammed ordered our cavalry to advance on the plain below\r\nthe encampment, and the infantry, chiefly composed of tribes\r\nof mountaineers, to take up their position on our flanks on the\r\nadjoining slopes.\r\n\r\n‘On came the French, on, on, without halting, or firing a gun,\r\nnotwithstanding that our artillery played upon them, and the tribes\r\nkept up a running fire from the heights on each flank. On came the\r\nFrench, without a pause that would give us an opportunity of a fair\r\nfight to test the prowess of the contending forces.’\r\n\r\n‘Explain,’ I interposed, ‘what you consider would have been\r\na battle.’\r\n\r\n‘Why,’ resumed the Kaid, ‘the French force ought to have halted\r\nwhen they got within half a mile; then we should have ordered a body\r\nof cavalry to advance and charge; the French might have done likewise;\r\nthe troopers would have met, and a hand-to-hand conflict would have\r\nensued. Those who got worsted would have retreated; other bodies on\r\neither side would have charged, and then likewise the infantry would\r\nhave advanced and joined in the affray. Finally, when either force\r\nretreated, the artillery would have covered their retreat, the battle\r\nwould have been brought to a conclusion and we should have known\r\nwho were the best and bravest warriors: but no—on came the French\r\nwithout a halt, and when our cavalry charged, the French infantry\r\nfired and mowed them down, even killing with their bayonets some of\r\nour troopers who had charged right up to the mass of French soldiers.\r\n\r\n‘On they came; our cavalry, after repeated charges, having no\r\nopportunity of fair fight, retreated, and so did the tribes. The\r\nrenegade fired his field-pieces as the French advanced upon our camp,\r\nand he, as also many of the artillerymen, were killed standing at\r\ntheir guns.\r\n\r\n‘What was to be done? It was quite a surprise. Sid Mohammed\r\nfled with all the cavalry, abandoning tents, ammunition, and many\r\nthousand animals.\r\n\r\n‘It was not a fair battle, and therefore I do not consider it\r\na defeat.’\r\n\r\nThe Taleb then gave us the following dialogue between the ‘fellah’\r\n(farmer) Ben Taieb Zarhoni and the wise F’ki Sid Mohammed Ben Nasr.\r\n\r\n_Ben Nasr._ ‘God has permitted the cursed Nazarenes to take\r\npossession of Algiers, as a punishment for the sins of the Mussulmans\r\nof that territory who had neglected to follow the precepts of our\r\nProphet—may God’s blessing be upon him! Ere long we Moors shall\r\nlikewise be punished for our sins and wickedness by the anger of God,\r\nwho will permit the Christians to take possession of the country of\r\nour forefathers.’\r\n\r\n_Zarhoni._ ‘I do not comprehend why an all-just God should punish,\r\nwithout discrimination, in this manner; for, in so doing, he punishes\r\nthe innocent as well as the guilty. Why should the man who has\r\nobeyed God’s precepts from his youth upwards, become subject to\r\nthe law of the accursed Christian because some of his brethren are\r\nsinful? How comes it that the Deity, in His wisdom, has not found\r\nmore just ways of inflicting punishment on the guilty?’\r\n\r\n_Ben Nasr._ ‘After the Deluge and the destruction of mankind,\r\nNoah’s mind was troubled with the same fallacies, and he prayed\r\nto God to enlighten him and teach him why the innocent were drowned\r\nas well as the sinful. He was thereupon thrown into a trance, and\r\nGod sent a great number of fleas which crawled up his leg; upon one\r\nbiting him, Noah awoke and rubbed his hand over the bitten part,\r\nkilling not only the offending flea, but many others.\r\n\r\n‘An Angel then appeared and said, “O man! Why killest thou fleas\r\nwhich have not injured thee?”\r\n\r\n‘Noah answered and said, “O Lord! These fleas are insignificant\r\nand noxious creatures.”\r\n\r\n‘To which the Angel replied, “As thou hast destroyed these\r\ninsects and not distinguished between the guilty and the harmless,\r\non account of the offence of one flea, thus also had the Almighty\r\nordained the Deluge for the destruction of mankind—who were,\r\nin His sight, but noxious creatures upon earth.”\r\n\r\n‘Noah bowed his head to the ground, and was dumb.’\r\n\r\n_Zarhoni._ ‘If I had been Noah, I should have replied to the\r\nAngel—“An almighty, an all-seeing God could distinguish the\r\nguilty from the innocent: but a poor ignorant man, awaking from a\r\ndream on being bitten by a flea, could not be expected to select\r\nwhich was the offending, and which the harmless flea.”’\r\n\r\n_Ben Nasr._ ‘It appears Noah was not so ready with a reply as\r\nyou are.’\r\n\r\nNext we had the history of the son of Tama, who would not say\r\n‘Enshallah’ (God willing).\r\n\r\n‘“Say Enshallah! when you propose to make a journey or to\r\nundertake anything: then fortune will attend you,” said the learned\r\nF’ki Bitiwi to his young friend Selam Amu.\r\n\r\n‘Know you not what the other day befell Abd-el-Kerim the son of\r\nTama the widow of the Sheikh of Amar? Hear then.\r\n\r\n‘Abd-el-Kerim, last market day, told his mother he was going to\r\nthe Sok of Had-el-Gharbía to buy a cow.\r\n\r\n‘The widow Tama, a devout good woman, reprimanded her son for not\r\nadding “Enshallah.” To this Abd-el-Kerim replied, in a taunting\r\nand blasphemous manner, that he needed not God’s assistance,\r\neither to go to market, or to buy a cow; for, said the rash young\r\nman, “Have I not here in the hood of my jelab more than sufficient\r\nmoney for the purpose? Have I not legs to carry me to the Sok? Are\r\nthere not always cows to be sold?”\r\n\r\n‘His mother again rebuked him, saying, “Without God’s will\r\nand His assistance, no man can succeed in life.”\r\n\r\n‘Abd-el-Kerim laughed at her and, shaking the money in his hood,\r\nset off to the market which was only about an hour’s journey from\r\ntheir village.\r\n\r\n‘On reaching the river Gharifa he found it unusually swollen and\r\nwas obliged to wade more than waist deep.\r\n\r\n‘When he reached the middle of the stream, the current was running\r\nvery strong and there came on a heavy shower of rain. Abd-el-Kerim\r\nforgot the money in the hood of his jelab and pulled it over his\r\nhead to prevent his getting wet, and the coins fell into the river\r\nand were lost in the mud.\r\n\r\n‘In vain did Abd-el-Kerim dive and endeavour to recover his\r\nmoney. The river was rising, the current became more rapid every\r\nmoment and he was obliged to retrace his steps and return in a\r\nvery wretched state to his village. Wet to the skin, without his\r\nmoney or his cow, bitterly repenting that he had not followed his\r\nmother’s advice, he vowed he would endeavour to be a better Moslem\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n‘On entering the village, he met his cousin Husain, who, having\r\nseen him set out in the morning for the market, inquired what brought\r\nhim back so early.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, said Abd-el-Kerim, it has pleased God that I should not listen\r\nto the advice of my mother, who desired me to say “Enshallah.” I\r\nintended to have bought a cow, but God ordained I should reach the\r\nriver just as it pleased God it should begin to rain. And then it\r\nwas His will that I should forget the money in the hood of my jelab:\r\nso I pulled the hood over my head and by God’s will it was ordained\r\nthat my money should thus be lost in the river. Now, if it please God,\r\nI vow with God’s assistance, never to say or do anything without\r\nasking the aid and blessing of the Almighty—Enshallah!’\r\n\r\nAnother story was that of ‘the lion and the lark.’\r\n\r\n\r\nA lion was prowling, on a hot summer’s day, in the plains of Sahel,\r\nand was about to tread on the nest of a lark, which was brooding\r\nover its unfledged larklings, when the bird thus addressed the\r\nroyal beast: ‘O greatest and most powerful Sultan of the forest,\r\nhave pity on a poor bird and her helpless young!’\r\n\r\nThe lion, looking with the greatest contempt on the little lark,\r\nreplied, ‘Is it for thy wretched offspring, or for thee—despicable\r\nbird—that I should swerve one step from my course?’ And at\r\nthe same moment he placed his paw upon the nest, and crushed the\r\nyoung larks.\r\n\r\nThe mother flew up towards the heavens, wailing piteously, and\r\ntrilled out, ‘O cruel tyrant! God created me and my little ones\r\nwhom thou hast now destroyed: from His throne do I seek justice and\r\nretribution. With Him all creatures are equal: thy strength, O lion,\r\nin His sight, is not more regarded than my helplessness.\r\n\r\n‘O God! I place my confidence in Thee! Thou art our Defender. Thou\r\nart the Judge of all creatures.’\r\n\r\n‘A curse,’ said the lion, ‘upon thy babbling tongue!’\r\n\r\nThe lark, soaring higher and higher, continued her song of lamentation\r\nand woe; when suddenly she heard a voice from heaven, and Gabriel,\r\nthe messenger of God, thus addressed her, ‘Thy prayer, O lark,\r\nis heard, and justice shall be done unto thee. Seek the aid of the\r\nwinged tribes, God ordains that they shall succour thee.’\r\n\r\nThe lark had hardly recovered from her astonishment at the heavenly\r\nvoice, when a falcon and a host of flies and gnats surrounded\r\nher. The falcon addressing her said, ‘Thou seekest justice and\r\nrevenge. They shall be thine, for I am sent by Allah. The powerful\r\none shall be humbled and shall be made to learn God’s strength\r\nand might; even through his humblest creatures.\r\n\r\n‘Hark ye, O gnats! Seek the lion in his den in the thicket; torment\r\nhim with myriads of stings until he flies into the open. I shall\r\nthen pounce on his back and tear his flesh with my talons. Then—O\r\nflies! do ye enter into the wounds in his body and fill them with\r\nmaggots and corruption. Thus shall the strong be humbled. Thus shall\r\nthose who despise God’s creatures, and who rule with wanton tyranny\r\nover the weak, be made to know that there is no power nor strength\r\nbut in God Almighty, the Most High.’\r\n\r\nThe directions of the falcon were carried out, and the lion, tormented\r\nby myriads of gnats, fled from his lair unto the plain. There the\r\nfalcon pounced on his back and tore his flesh. Innumerable swarms\r\nof flies filled his body with maggots and corruption.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the tyrant of the forest, the terror of man and beast,\r\ndied in a loathsome and miserable manner.\r\n\r\nThus was the lark avenged.\r\n\r\n_March 4._ Our tents were struck at daybreak. More prisoners at the\r\nmuleteer’s tent, and again I had to play mediator. The accusation\r\nwas that sufficient barley had not been provided for the soldiers’\r\nhorses. On examining the case, I found that more than enough had\r\nbeen brought; but that a Kaid, who had followed us from the town\r\nby way of compliment, was now returning and wanted to carry with\r\nhim a rich harvest from these poor people. This I put a stop to and\r\nreleased the prisoners.\r\n\r\nCrossing the line of hills called Akba el Hamra, we passed Dar Aklau,\r\nor house of Aklau—a famous robber—and reached a wide plain\r\ntraversed by the rivers of Kholj and Hashef, in which is found much\r\n‘shebbel[8],’ a fish like a salmon, though the flesh is white\r\nand a most dainty dish when roasted or fried. The fisheries are a\r\nmonopoly of the Government. Here we were met by the Kaid Sheikh of\r\nGharbía and about seventy cavalry who, after welcoming us in the\r\nname of the Sultan, wheeled round and headed our party.\r\n\r\nOur place of encampment is again a well-chosen site. A ‘mona’\r\nof sheep, fowls, shebbel, eggs, butter, bread, milk and oranges was\r\nnow brought, and a horrid cutting of throats ensued. I wish we did\r\nnot know that mutton belonged to a sheep or the wing of a fowl to\r\na chicken. A camp scene sadly reminds me that man is a bloodthirsty\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n_March 5._ Rain! Rain in torrents!\r\n\r\nAbout midday we had half an hour’s fine weather, and I sallied\r\nout in search of antiquities, and found numbers of large square\r\nhewn stones covering the green turf. Here and there were remains\r\nof a well-built wall—but of no height or form to enable me, in my\r\nignorance, to say what these ruins had been. Every appearance around\r\nindicated the remains of a town of importance, probably Roman. The\r\nMoors tell me that in digging they find many ruins underground. In\r\none place, however, called Uhara, there were the ruined remains of\r\nwhat would appear to have been a castle or barrack. This the Arabs\r\ndeclared to have been the palace of the Sultan of Portugal’s\r\ndaughter. It is possible that this building is Portuguese, for\r\nthey—the Portuguese—possessed all this line of country, and would\r\nnaturally select the same advantageous position for a castle as their\r\npredecessors the Romans. The material of this building was thin flat\r\nstones, not hewn, but apparently collected from the surface of the\r\nsoil and built with a hard cement—not mortar—as far as I could\r\njudge. The remnant of an arched well was near the building. We also\r\ncame across what appeared to have been an amphitheatre, formed in\r\npart by the natural rising of the ground and in part by the hand of\r\nman. Not far from this site, some years ago, I stumbled by chance\r\non a much more perfect amphitheatre[9], in which were still the\r\nsteps or seats for the spectators and the dens for the wild beasts\r\nand gladiators.\r\n\r\nOn returning to camp I found that the Sheikh of Ibdaua had\r\narrived with his cavalry to present his salams; but had come\r\nempty-handed—‘not even a bowl of milk’—as I was informed by\r\nKaid Serbul, who has been sent by the Basha to provide ‘mona.’\r\nSo this Kaid-caterer has not allowed the Bedouin to approach my\r\n‘Exalted Presence.’ I must, however, make friends with this\r\ngentleman, and show him by and by, if he prove a tame Moslem, that\r\nthe Englishman is not so hard upon him as his own countrymen. A good\r\nname is what I wish to leave amongst these poor people. Some day it\r\nmay prove of importance.\r\n\r\n_March 7._ Starting our baggage at an early hour, so as to give time\r\nfor the animals and baggage to be taken in boats across the river,\r\nand the tents to be pitched, we followed in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nEl Araish was soon in sight, and its fine river El Kus (the Lixus of\r\nthe ancients). The Sultan’s fleet, consisting of four dismantled\r\nand rotten brigs, lay in this river. The captains of these vessels\r\nhoisted their flags as I passed. A twelve-oared boat, with the\r\ncaptain of the port and crew in full dress, awaited me; and two or\r\nthree boats for the horses. One of these boats, by way of compliment,\r\nwas destined to convey my horse all alone! At the port-gate was the\r\nGovernor of the town, with a guard of honour drawn up to receive\r\nme, and in the Custom House the administrator and other authorities\r\nwelcomed us with the usual salams and compliments.\r\n\r\nThe cat is out of the bag! Every night since we have started I\r\nhave heard loud disputing and high words, in which fowls, eggs,\r\nmutton, &c., prevailed. It appears that from the plentiful mona I\r\nreceive, a large surplus of live-stock remains, though my servants\r\nand followers eat to their hearts’ content and are looking twice\r\nas sleek as when they left Tangier. These sheep and fowls had been\r\nappropriated by them without my knowledge, and sold as they thought\r\nbest, and one of the ‘Faithful’ complained to me because my\r\nArab secretary, Sid Ben Yahia, insisted upon having his share of\r\nthe spoil. I have put a stop to this shameless proceeding and have\r\nlet them know that, as the food is given to me by the Sultan’s\r\norders to be eaten, it shall be eaten and not an atom sold. So what\r\nmy friends can’t eat, David Sicsu and the Arab secretary shall;\r\nand what they cannot, my servants shall; and what they cannot eat,\r\nthe muleteers shall devour; and what the muleteers can’t eat, the\r\npoor shall; and what the poor can’t eat, they shall keep till they\r\ncan. I have made one or two Moors discontented by this arrangement,\r\nbut have pleased the majority: this is my aim, and to be just to all.\r\n\r\n_March 8._ Rain again in the morning, but we made a start, and it\r\nturned out a most delightful day. Our path was over undulating hills\r\nof a red sandy soil, covered with rich grass, and the ‘klakh[10],’\r\nan annual fennel-like plant, growing nine and ten feet high; the\r\n‘silphion’ of the Greeks, producing gum ammoniac, the ‘fasogh’\r\nof the Arabs. Here and there we passed patches of fine wheat and\r\nbarley, the latter already in the ear. It is distressing to see\r\nthis wide extent of country almost uninhabited, and its rich soil\r\nonly cultivated where the wandering Arab happens to pitch his tent;\r\nyet capable, I should judge, of competing with any corn producing\r\ncountry in Europe. There was little or no variety of scenery on the\r\nroad, and we did not meet half a dozen persons, or see _en passant_\r\nmore than two Arab ‘duars,’ till we reached the spot of our\r\nencampment, near a limpid stream, called ‘Gla.’\r\n\r\n_March 9._ On approaching an Arab duar, we witnessed a curious\r\nspectacle. The Arabs were flitting, and conveying their mosque on\r\ntwo mules’ backs. This place of prayer is a conical hut, about\r\nnine feet high and five in diameter. The priest alone enters at the\r\ntime of prayer, the congregation going through their devotions in\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\nOur encampment we found near a lake or marsh called ‘el Kra.’\r\nSt. Leger and myself waded in up to our middles after coot and duck,\r\nbut only got a ducking and one coot.\r\n\r\nLater, we Nazarenes sallied out to visit the Arab tents, accompanied\r\nby Moors with sticks to keep off the dogs, which seem to have a great\r\ndislike to the Christian, and bark their curses in as guttural sounds\r\nas their masters. The women and children peeped at us when distant,\r\nbut scuttled into their tents as we approached, though two old Arab\r\nhags, dressed in the dirtiest of woollen rags, held together with\r\nlarge silver brooches (of the same form as the Scotch brooch made\r\nfor the plaid, and used much after the same fashion for confining\r\ntheir dress at the shoulder), held their ground and scrutinised\r\nus with witch-like eyes. One fine girl, however, took courage and\r\nshowed herself: her features were very good, and oh, such eyes!\r\n\r\n_March 10._ Off at 7 o’clock. Delightful weather. Came in sight\r\nof the great lake of Ras-ed-Daura, which extends some twenty-five\r\nmiles to the southward, though only three or four miles wide in the\r\nbroadest part. This lake is of fresh water, and runs parallel with the\r\nsea-shore, but at some four or five miles’ distance, and hidden from\r\nit by a line of hills. It swarms with duck, flamingoes, black storks,\r\nNumidian cranes, swans, egrets, plovers, and curlew; coots in some\r\nplaces blacken the water. All these birds were very wild, so that I\r\nonly succeeded in killing a few curlew. A great number of leeches are\r\nfished from this lake: upwards of ten thousand annually. It is famous\r\nalso for a large kind of eel, which the Arabs fish for in canoes,\r\nmade of sedge, called ‘maada.’ I examined one which an Arab was\r\npunting with a long pole, in search of coots’ and ducks’ eggs,\r\nof which he had a plentiful supply. This boat was about seven feet\r\nlong and two broad, and made of bundles of sedge tied together, and\r\ncoming to a point for the prow. The Arabs say they can bear two men,\r\nand cannot be sunk entirely, or even upset. As we passed several\r\nArab duars near the lake, troops of men were washing their clothes\r\nat the margin; this they did with their feet, beating time to and\r\naccompanying their labour by a grunting noise. These wild fellows\r\nwere almost naked, and finer limbs I never saw.\r\n\r\nAs we passed the Arab ‘duars,’ troops of women and children\r\nassailed me with bowls of milk and presents of eggs, calling down a\r\nblessing upon the Christian going on a friendly mission, with presents\r\nto their lord the Sultan. I spoiled my dinner with all this milk,\r\nbut could not refuse the peace-offering.\r\n\r\nIn describing the ‘maada’ or sedge canoe, I should have mentioned\r\nthat the word means ferry or means of traversing. This sedge is called\r\nby the Arabs ‘skaff,’ whence perhaps the Arabic word for a ship,\r\n‘shkaff,’ as having been first made out of that material, and\r\nan English word for a boat, ‘skiff’—not touching upon many\r\nsimilar terms in other languages.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we met a party of cavalry escorting a litter,\r\ncontaining the sick son of the Kaid of the tribe of Beni Hassén,\r\nHadj Abderahman Ben el Amri. The litter, which was borne by two\r\nmules, halted, and Dr. Simpson visited the patient. He had been\r\nill for a year, and complained of nausea and want of sleep. He was\r\ngoing to Tangier with a letter from the Sultan to Sid Buselham to\r\nget European medical assistance. It is whispered that the young man\r\nhas been poisoned by his wives—often the fate of wealthy Moors who\r\nmarry many women and show more favour to one wife than another. My\r\nKaid tells me he has three wives, and yet can live in peace; but he\r\nowns that he thinks it a bad practice and unjust to the ladies. He\r\ntells me he once overheard two of his wives conversing on this\r\nsubject; one of them was complaining that man should have assumed\r\nthis right, whilst women, whatever might be their position in life,\r\ncould never have more than one husband—and that one, in most cases,\r\nwithout her choice or option; adding, moreover, that she thought she\r\ncould govern or manage four men much better than any man could four\r\nwomen. ‘Yes,’ exclaimed the other, ‘but God has happened to\r\ngive man greater strength than to us women, and they club together\r\nagainst us and manage matters as they please. So the Prophet was\r\na man, and issued laws that pleased him best as a man. Then our\r\nSultans are all men, and our Bashas and our Kadis! What justice can\r\nwe expect? Men will support one another, and we must put up with\r\nthe third of a husband!’\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I received a message from the Arabs of a village near\r\nour camp, to say that they proposed to serenade us in honour of\r\nthe Sultan, and asking permission to perform. We consented, and\r\naccordingly three of the villagers appeared; one with a Moorish drum\r\ncalled ‘tebél,’ each of the others having a ‘ghaita’ or pipe,\r\nwhich is shaped like a flageolet, but when played produces a sound\r\nlike a bagpipe. The musicians commenced by playing an air called\r\n‘haidús’: it was a wild and lively tune, and played in good\r\ntime. Several of the Arabs and our camp-followers began to dance,\r\nsinging words which I could not comprehend.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine moonlight night, and the Arabs, men, women, and\r\nchildren, assembled round the musicians and dancers. Another air was\r\nnow called for, and the ‘Hamádsha’ was played. This was very\r\nquick and wild, but, barbarous as it seemed, there was something\r\nmost warlike and exciting in it; so much so that I could feel\r\nmy blood curdle as when I have heard a pibroch in the land o’\r\ncakes. The Arabs commenced a dance which consisted in taking hold\r\nof each other’s arms in a semicircle, and jumping, throwing about\r\nthe head, and making a grunting noise. The dancers, men and boys,\r\nwere wrapped in the haik, and their heads were bare. In the midst\r\nof them was the leader of the dance, a gaunt old Arab, who, with\r\nfrantic gestures and contortions of the legs and arms, urged on the\r\nmaddening dance until the sweat rolled down in streams from their\r\nswarthy faces. Sometimes he seized a stick, and after twirling it in\r\nthe most accomplished style of the Moorish gun dance, presented it\r\nat our heads, and, taking fixed aim, advanced with a shuffling pace,\r\ncrying out, ‘There are the enemies! There are the enemies!’ His\r\neyes at the time rolled with the most savage expression, every muscle\r\nin his body seemed to be strained to keep his aim steady. Suddenly,\r\nwhen the stick was within a few inches of my nose, he made a motion as\r\nif he had fired his gun, and leaping round, commenced the dance again.\r\n\r\nThe women, I am told, often join in these dances, but—as in our\r\ncountry-dances—form a separate line from the men, advancing towards\r\neach other with all the motion of courtship or love; which indeed\r\nis the origin of the movements in all dances. Several Arab women had\r\nflocked around me, and I observed two or three fine-featured girls;\r\none especially had a gazelle-like expression such as Arab eyes alone\r\ncan give. I asked them to dance; I begged them; but they said they\r\nwere ashamed before strangers, and my nearest companion told me\r\nher husband was of the party, and would be jealous if she danced\r\nbefore the strange Moors in the camp. She acknowledged, however,\r\nthat she could hardly refrain from joining in the dance. The music\r\nand dancing were kept up until a very late hour, and I was so\r\ninterested and struck by the wild scene that I could not leave till\r\nthe conclusion. It appeared to excite most fiercely the Arabs and\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n_March 13._ The approach to Rabát is very picturesque. The town\r\nis built on an eminence near the river side, flanked on one side by\r\nthe red-brown turreted walls of the old castle, and on the other by\r\nthe grand ruins of the ancient Mosque of Hassan, whilst above the\r\ntomb-like houses of a glaring white, arose the tall minarets of the\r\nMoslem’s house of prayer.\r\n\r\nThe face of affairs has changed! Disregard, neglect, and ignorance\r\nhave taken the place of kindness, honour, and goodwill. At the river,\r\nnot a boat on the part of the Government, not a messenger to receive\r\nme. The Consular Agent, Mr. J. Serruya, a Hebrew of Gibraltar, a\r\ngood young man though not a Solomon, came to meet us in a boat he had\r\nhired from a Portuguese vessel. I asked him the reason why the local\r\nGovernment had made no preparation, as is usual, for the reception\r\nof a Consul-General going on a mission to the Sultan. Serruya told me\r\nthat he had been three times to the Governor this morning to announce\r\nmy approach; that the Governor had promised to afford every facility\r\nfor passing the river, and to pay me the usual honours.\r\n\r\nHadj Abdallah Tif is the name of the Governor, and he has lately been\r\nplaced here by the Sultan to succeed Governor Zebdi, who had been\r\nelected a few months ago by the Rabát people, when they revolted\r\nagainst their former Governor E’Suizi.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan temporarily confirmed Zebdi in the post and put Suizi\r\nin irons. Then H.S.M. came to Rabát, ‘ate up’ the town, as the\r\nexpression goes, and before his departure seized all the chiefs of\r\nthe late insurrection and their Governor-elect, and sent them in\r\nirons to prison at Fas, nominating, though against his will, this\r\nsaid Abdallah Tif as Governor. He is reported to be very wealthy and,\r\nas he had lived a retired life and not mixed himself up in Government\r\naffairs, had been beyond the clutches of the Sultan. It is said that\r\nHis Sherifian Majesty now awaits the first opportunity to receive\r\nsufficient complaint against Abdallah to seize his property. Alas,\r\npoor Morocco! poor Moors! poor Sultan! How fast you are rushing\r\nto ruin; for as sure as there is a God in Heaven, such a system,\r\nsuch iniquity, cannot thrive.\r\n\r\nCrossing in our agent’s boat I sent my saddle-horses over in\r\na barge.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen artillerymen, in no order, had been sent to meet me,\r\nbut not one of the authorities, though it is always customary for\r\nthe Governor of the town to receive the Consul at the Custom-house\r\non such occasions. I therefore told my interpreter to acquaint these\r\nartillerymen that I must decline their attendance, and should pitch\r\nmy tents outside the town.\r\n\r\nThe news flew like wildfire, and I received a message to say that\r\nthe Governor had been waiting for me with the Moorish authorities\r\nat the Custom-house. This was not true; for I had disembarked at\r\nanother port-gate, having heard from my agent that the Governor did\r\nnot intend to give me a reception.\r\n\r\nAll this indeed to me, as John Hay, is of little importance—for I\r\nhate the miserable parade—but if a Spanish or Neapolitan Agent,\r\nor a French Interpreter be received with these forms (as all have\r\never been), it will not do to let myself, as British Representative,\r\nbe slighted. For then indeed, in this country of forms, it would be\r\nadieu to the British name and adieu to our influence, unless great\r\nguns were our Ambassadors. I don’t ask for more than others, but,\r\nby Jupiter! as British Agent, no Moor or man shall slight me!\r\n\r\nOn getting the message of the Governor, I told the bearer that\r\nI regretted having come to the wrong landing-place, but that\r\nthe mistake had been committed from no boat having been sent or\r\ncommunication made to me by the Governor, when I was on the other\r\nside of the river. I agreed, however, in order to mend matters,\r\nto take no notice of the past and ride to the Custom-house. Some\r\nother soldiers and artillery had now joined the first half-dozen,\r\nand in we marched through the town, an immense crowd following.\r\n\r\nAt a narrow street I was halted and told to dismount, as the Governor\r\nwas ready to receive me. I asked if it were the Custom-house and port,\r\nand receiving a reply in the negative, said, ‘Tell the Kaid, with my\r\ncompliments, that I cannot have the honour of making the acquaintance\r\nof his Excellency—except at the port, as is customary.’ No answer\r\nwas given, but out bolts the Governor—ferreted from his hole, _but\r\nsupposed to be incognito_—and marches down to the Custom-house,\r\nwhilst whispers of reproach reach my ear from the Rabát people,\r\nthat the English Consul is right and their Governor a fool. I drew\r\nin my nag to let his Excellency pass and then followed, on horseback,\r\ntill I reached the Custom-house.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had taken up his position on a plain stone seat, with\r\na mat on it, and his soldiers were drawn up round him. No chair or\r\nstool was placed or offered to me; so, saluting his Excellency in\r\nthe most polite style, I accepted the seat (which was not offered\r\nme!) next his _ungracious_ Excellency.\r\n\r\nAfter the first phrases of Moorish compliment, I told Mr. Abdallah\r\nTif that it was with much regret I had witnessed the want of attention\r\nand regard paid to myself, as the British Representative; mentioning,\r\nat the same time, the honours that had been paid to me on the road\r\nand the receptions I had met with—the established practice, from\r\nthe most ancient times, for the reception of a Consul-General bearing\r\nletters of credence to the Sultan. As regarded myself personally,\r\nI told the Governor, it was of no importance, nor consequence; that I\r\ncould shake hands and break the bread of friendship with the poorest\r\nMoslem; but that as British Agent I expected to receive the attention\r\nand honour due to me as the Representative of the ancient ally and\r\nbest friend of Morocco. The Governor begged pardon and pleaded his\r\nrecent nomination and his ignorance of former practice.\r\n\r\nHe then announced that he had prepared a house for me. This house I\r\nknew to be in ruins, and a most wretched hole. I therefore replied\r\nthat, with his Excellency’s permission, I should pitch my tents\r\noutside the town, that I had every comfort with me, and should be\r\nmore at my ease in my own tent than in a house. This, he said, he\r\ndare not permit, as he would be responsible if I were insulted. I\r\nthen said, ‘I cannot accept from your Excellency the house in\r\nwhich you propose to lodge me. When Monsieur Roche, the French\r\nInterpreter, came here—accredited by his Consul and not by his\r\nSovereign—you lodged him in the house of Mulai Hamed, a palace\r\nof your princes. As English Consul I ask not for such hospitality,\r\nbut I decline accepting less than what has been granted to others,\r\nwhether Spanish, Dutch, French, or of any other nation. I demand\r\nnothing, but will accept nothing, except my due.’\r\n\r\nThe Governor finally agreed that I should go to the British Agent’s\r\nhouse; the soldiers and tents to a spot fixed upon within the walls\r\n(where, Kaid E’Susi told me, the fleas were so large that they had\r\nears!—meaning thereby that they were not mere insects, but animals),\r\nand he said he would let me know in an hour’s time whether I could\r\nhave Mulai Hamed’s house. On taking leave I told the Governor\r\nthat I regretted much to have had such cause for complaining of my\r\ntreatment; that I came not to create disturbance, but to endeavour to\r\nbind the Mussulmans and the English by stronger bonds of alliance,\r\nfriendship and good-will; but that unless that feeling were mutual,\r\nit would prove of no avail.\r\n\r\nI am determined to act with every moderation and prudence, but will\r\nnot be imposed upon and made the butt of low intrigue. It may yet\r\nbe all right. The Sultan’s letter shall be the mirror by which my\r\nfuture conduct shall be guided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n           VISIT TO SALLI AND DEPARTURE FOR MARÁKESH. 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hay’s firmness produced an effect on his surly hosts. On March\r\n18 a letter arrived from the Sultan, which completely changed their\r\nattitude towards him. His Diary thus continues:—\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 18._ Young Ben Abu has just announced the arrival of a courier\r\nfrom the Court. A cavalry soldier was the bearer of my letter, and\r\nhad accomplished the three days’ journey in twenty-four hours,\r\nhaving been ordered by the Sultan to travel until his horse dropped\r\nand then to continue on foot.\r\n\r\nThe letter from the Court is most satisfactory. The _amende honorable_\r\nis made; the authorities here are reprimanded. Already have I received\r\nmessages from the Governor, crying ‘peccavi!’ The palace of the\r\nSultan here is being prepared for me, and a most plentiful ‘mona’\r\nhas been brought.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan’s orders are that tenfold honours are to be paid to\r\nthe British Envoy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Ben Dris receives my answer, I am to proceed to the Court\r\nescorted by the Governor of each successive district until I reach\r\nthe Sultan.\r\n\r\nI have told the authorities here that I have forgotten all; and\r\nlike good friends or lovers, a little quarrel is going to make us\r\nbetter friends than ever. With Moors, and indeed most Orientals,\r\nyou must be kind, but very firm, or the end would be great guns.\r\n\r\n_March 20._ Our house is charming; a jewel of Moorish architecture. It\r\nis quite new, and the workmanship is almost as good as that which\r\nis seen in the Alhambra. The walls are highly ornamented in gypsum,\r\nand very tastefully painted. The pavement is mosaic, and a fountain\r\nstands in the midst, from which a jet of clear water plays; the\r\nceiling is carved and decorated, and intricate and mystical figures\r\nadorn the walls. The huge folding doors and small windows are all in\r\nthe same style; in fact, the whole is perfection. On the walls are\r\nwritten many verses of the Koran, and among other expressions which\r\nI could decipher in the flowery writing, were ‘God is the true\r\nwealth,’ and ‘Health is alone with the Everlasting;’ or, as we\r\nshould say, ‘Lay up your riches in heaven.’ Adjoining our rooms\r\nare all sorts of intricate passages with small apartments, fountains,\r\nbaths, &c., and, quite separate, are quarters for the cook and other\r\nservants. Then there is a pretty garden, run to weeds, with a charming\r\nalcove of tastefully-turned woodwork, from which may be seen, on the\r\nother side of the narrow street, the ornamented mausoleum of a saint,\r\nshaded by a lofty palm-tree. Upon this house of the dead sit a couple\r\nof storks, pluming themselves, billing and cackling the live-long day;\r\nthey are wild, but all their race in this country are fearless of man,\r\nand on the house they choose for their nest, ‘no evil befalleth.’\r\n\r\n‘Meteor’ has saluted; Salli and Rabát have replied. I walked\r\nto the castle to witness the firing of the Moors; an immense crowd\r\nfollowed, and although I was alone, except for one black soldier,\r\nnot a whisper or a curse was heard. Smiles and kind words were the\r\norder of the day, and a murmur ran through the crowd that the English\r\nare the Moslem’s best friends and are honoured by the Sultan.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Kaid Ben Abu (‘the Father of the Mountain’ is ill)\r\nand a troop of cavalry, we rode towards Shella, passing through the\r\nold part of the town of Rabát, of which the walls are still in good\r\npreservation, and appear to have been formed of red tápia[11]. The\r\nGovernor informed me that tradition says they were built without\r\nany foundation, and that thirty thousand Christian prisoners,\r\nwhom he said were from ‘Irak’ (I don’t know how this is to\r\nbe explained, except that they were Persians), worked at the walls,\r\nand that many thousands of the bodies of those that died, or happened\r\nto be punished with death, are embedded in the tápia.\r\n\r\nWe passed the gate called Bab-el-Haddad or the Smithy Gate. The\r\nancient town of Shella lies within a few yards of the old walls of\r\nRabát, and is built on one side of a conical hill.\r\n\r\nThe walls have a very ancient appearance, and the architecture\r\nlooks Saracenic.\r\n\r\nNeither Christians nor Jews are allowed to enter Shella; though\r\nMr. Urquhart, who was here the other day, penetrated into the sacred\r\ntown, and his foolhardy curiosity very near cost him his life; for\r\na Moor with a gun happened to be there and fired at him, as I am\r\ninformed, but the gun missed fire. Urquhart was stoned by those who\r\nhad seen him enter, and was obliged to shut himself up in Rabát,\r\nand ultimately take his departure. The town is not inhabited and is\r\nin ruins. I could perceive the remains of a mosque or chapel. Ben\r\nYáhia, my Arabic secretary, tells me there are many inscriptions\r\nbut no dates, that one of these mentions the Sultan Assuad[12]\r\nas having built a gate. ‘Sultan Assuad’ means the black Sultan.\r\n\r\nI had much desire to see the interior of the town, as one has for all\r\nthings forbidden, but make it a point of duty never unnecessarily\r\nto go contrary to the prejudices of the people, however gross they\r\nmay be. I believe at this moment, if I were to insist upon it,\r\nthe Governor would let me go anywhere and do anything.\r\n\r\nWe rode to the river side near the town, passing near some\r\nsaltpans. The valley had several fine gardens, abounding in orange\r\nand pomegranate trees; the former were covered with their golden\r\nfruit. Oranges are sometimes sold on the trees at the rate of about\r\na shilling a thousand—_and such oranges!_\r\n\r\n_March 23._ Went over in a boat to Salli, as invited by Hadj Kassem,\r\nthe contractor for supply of bullocks to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nHadj Kassem met us on the shore and, surrounded by half a dozen\r\nof our own troopers and the same number of the Rabát soldiery,\r\nwe entered Salli, the hot-bed of fanaticism. Here a host of boys\r\nbegan to muster round the party, but Hadj Kassem’s house was at\r\nhand, and we took refuge there before the mob molested us. The Hadj\r\nwas very civil, and took us all over his house, which was furnished\r\nin good Moorish style, with carpets of all kinds, looking-glasses,\r\nand clocks, which latter generally indulge in indicating any hour\r\nthey please and never seem to be unanimous as to time after falling\r\ninto the hands of the ‘Faithful.’ I caught a glimpse of one or\r\ntwo of the Hadj’s ladies: they appeared well-favoured. There was\r\na charming little girl of three or four years old, who was admitted\r\nto our society; she sat in all the glory of full dress, on a cushion,\r\nlooking on with the gravity of a ‘Kadi.’ The Hadj feasted us with\r\nMoorish tea of all kinds, and we were threatened with ‘siksu’\r\nand other delicacies, from which, indeed, we had a most narrow escape.\r\n\r\nWhilst talking to the Hadj, a great hubbub and shouting were heard\r\nin the street, emanating from a mob of boys waiting to attack the\r\nChristians as soon as they should appear. Hadj Kassem proposed a\r\nretreat by the garden; and this was agreed upon. So out we sallied,\r\nwith half our soldiers in the front and half in the rear; backed by\r\none of our attendants, a young Sheríf, a very daring and active\r\nyouth. We had not gone a hundred yards before we were assailed at\r\nthe corner of one of the cross streets by a host of men and boys, who\r\npelted us with brickbats and stones of all sizes. Don José received a\r\nblow on the shoulder. The Sheríf and some of our soldiers charged the\r\nmob, one of whom was knocked down by a stone hurled by the Sheríf.\r\n\r\nOn we went at a rapid pace, and after us came a shower of\r\nstones. Dr. Simpson received a blow on the head, and a Portuguese\r\nskipper, who happened to have followed our party, ditto. Again and\r\nagain was the mob driven back by the Sheríf and our soldiers; but,\r\nurged on by many a grey-headed fanatic, they rallied and pursued\r\nus. At the town gate we found some rascals had got to the top of\r\nthe walls, intending to hurl down rocks upon our devoted heads. We\r\ndislodged the enemy, however, with brickbats, from their stronghold\r\nand then rushed into the open, making for the Hadj’s garden. A\r\nmadman, a dancing fanatic, had joined the mob and was yet urging\r\non the pursuit of us, whistling, jumping and twirling, in the most\r\nsavage style. We got safe into the garden, refreshed ourselves with\r\noranges, and wended our way towards the river.\r\n\r\nThe mob had again collected in force to oppose us, and a battle\r\nof stones (or, as we should say in ‘Auld Reekie,’ a _bicker_),\r\ntook place. The ‘father of the red cap’ distinguished himself\r\nby cracking the pate of one of the enemy—though only to ‘kill\r\nhim a little,’ as an Irishman would say. We reached the boat,\r\nand I sent back one of my soldiers to the Governor of Salli to say\r\nthat I was extremely surprised to find he had not sent any guard to\r\nprevent this uproar, and that, unless some satisfaction was given me,\r\nI should report him to the Sultan. I received a reply, brought by the\r\nSheikh of the Jews, a Moorish Kaid, and some others, apologising for\r\nwhat had taken place; the Governor of Salli declaring that he was\r\nvery unwell and that he had been totally ignorant of my intention\r\nto visit Salli that day (this I rather doubt, as the Governor of\r\nRabát tells me he had written to inform him of our intention),\r\nthat he had put twenty of the offenders in prison, and would not\r\nlet them out until he had my permission.\r\n\r\nI did not receive the Sheikh or the Moorish officer, nor did I accept\r\nthis apology as sufficient; for the story of the prisoners might or\r\nmight not be true, and public atonement is what I must require for\r\nsuch a gross outrage. I therefore told my interpreter to tell the\r\nmessenger that, if the Governor of Salli wished to hear further from\r\nme, he must come himself to my house in Rabát; or that, if he were\r\nill, he must send the Lieutenant-Governor and some of the prisoners,\r\nand then I should see what was best to be done. The messengers left\r\nus, very crest-fallen.\r\n\r\nIn Salli we saw nothing of interest: narrow streets and high town\r\nwalls were all that we had seen.\r\n\r\n_March 24._ The Governor of Salli, his Khalífa and a Kaid,\r\nthe Governor of Rabát and Hadj Kassem, came to apologise for\r\nyesterday’s outrage, bringing with them ten prisoners. The Governor\r\nof Salli looked indeed very ill, as he had declared himself to be. He\r\nmade many apologies for the misconduct of the people of Salli and\r\nfor not having come to me himself, or sent some guards. He told me\r\nhe had taken twenty prisoners, that he had brought ten with him,\r\nto be punished as I desired, and then to be taken back to prison to\r\nremain there till I pardoned them. After giving him a lecture for\r\nnot keeping his people in better order, and pointing out the serious\r\nconsequences that might have attended any misfortune happening to\r\none of our party, I agreed to forget the past and requested him to\r\nfree the prisoners. The Governor of Salli then begged I would visit\r\nhis town another day, if I remained here for any time, adding that\r\nhe would come himself, with his guard, to meet me and would engage\r\nthat not even a word should be uttered against us.\r\n\r\nNo doubt yesterday will be long remembered by the people of Salli,\r\nwho are the worst of fanatics in Morocco. I am told the crews of\r\nEuropean vessels, taking in ballast on the shore, are often attacked,\r\nwith knives and swords, by these demi-savages. I trust what has now\r\npassed will show them that Christians can command respect and are\r\nnot to be insulted with impunity.\r\n\r\nI care little for all this, in fact I hate palaver; but look to\r\nincrease our influence—which perhaps has been somewhat on the wane\r\nsince French hostilities of last year—and trust I shall succeed by\r\npursuing a very firm, but friendly and just course towards all. Young\r\nBen Abu declares that what has occurred will cause Christians to be\r\nbetter respected by the people, and will make the authorities more\r\non the alert and on their good behaviour towards Englishmen.\r\n\r\n_March 25._ The brother of the Governor of Salli came this morning to\r\nmake professions of good-will. I sent Dr. Simpson with him to Salli,\r\nto visit his brother who is ill. Simpson returned well pleased with\r\nhis reception; not a word, not a look, of insult from the crowd as\r\nhe passed; all was silence and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 28 Mr. Hay left Rabát for Marákesh. In his diary he records\r\nthe events of the journey, the cordial receptions he met with from\r\nthe governors of the various provinces through which he passed,\r\nand the savage parade which they made in his honour.\r\n\r\nThe account is too long to be given here in full detail; but a few\r\nof the more striking incidents which occurred during his march are\r\nfound below.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 29 he writes:—An Arab, with a small dagger between his\r\nteeth and making low bows, presented himself in the middle of the\r\nroad, saying, ‘I put myself under the hem of your garment.’\r\nI thought the man was mad, and was preparing to meet some act of\r\nfanaticism, when Kaid Abd Selam explained the mystery by telling me\r\nthat this man had killed another in feud, and had been condemned to\r\ndeath, or, if the relatives of the deceased would accept it, to pay\r\nblood-money. This they had agreed to do, and the individual, being\r\nvery poor, was travelling to collect the sum fixed upon (generally\r\nabout twenty or thirty pounds for a man) before a certain time. I\r\ngave the poor wretch a trifle.\r\n\r\nWe have now entered the district of Shawía, famous for its ladies\r\nand horses. The Sultan’s harem is principally supplied from this\r\npart of the Empire. I have caught a glimpse of two or three very\r\nfine-looking damsels. Their features are very delicate, eyes as\r\nblack as jet, with eyelashes that hang on the cheek when the eyes\r\nare closed. Their figures also are graceful, but the rags they wear\r\nwould completely spoil their appearance, were it not that they barely\r\nconceal their well-turned limbs. The country was better cultivated\r\nthan any we had yet seen, the barley and wheat already far advanced in\r\nthe ear and looking splendid. On the uncultivated ground a rich grass,\r\nvying in luxuriance with a variety of wild flowers, carpeted our path.\r\n\r\nI sigh to think of the word ‘scarcity’ being ever used in\r\nthis ‘blessed land,’ when such an excellent tract of country\r\nis allowed to remain a neglected waste. But this is the result of\r\na system of government which destroys all security in property or\r\nlife. To cut the throat of the goose that lays the golden eggs is\r\nthe blind system of the Sultans of Morocco.\r\n\r\nOn passing a ‘duar’ several Arabs came to meet us, one of them\r\nhaving a sheathed sword in his hand. This he laid across the crupper\r\nof the saddle of the principal person of our party. A marriage has\r\ntaken place to-day, and these people have the custom of collecting\r\n‘mona’ for the bridegroom in this manner.\r\n\r\nOn April 3 he writes:—There have been two Arab thieves about our\r\ntents during the night: one was caught, the other escaped. The rascal\r\nwas taken before the Khalífa of the Governor of Dukála and has been\r\nmost severely bastinadoed. My informant reports the following scene.\r\n\r\n_Kaid._ ‘Who are you?’\r\n\r\n_Culprit._ ‘Mohammed Ben El Amrani.’\r\n\r\n_Kaid._ ‘Down with Mohammed and lick him.’ (Six soldiers\r\nadvanced, four held his hands and feet, whilst two striped him\r\nwith cords.) After some three dozen, the Kaid says, ‘Who was\r\nyour companion?’\r\n\r\n_Culprit._ ‘Abdallah.’\r\n\r\n_Kaid._ ‘Down with him and see if that was his name.’ (Soldiers\r\nbeat the culprit, who sings out, ‘Selam Hamed Sodik.’)\r\n\r\n_Kaid._ ‘Very well. So it was Sodik. Now what were you doing about\r\nthe tents?’\r\n\r\n_Culprit._ ‘Nothing.’\r\n\r\n_Kaid._ ‘Down with him.’ Culprit is licked, and sings out,\r\n‘I came to pick up anything that was abandoned.’ (More stripes.)\r\n\r\n_Culprit._ ‘I came to rob.’ (The soldiers stop.)\r\n\r\n_Kaid._ ‘So you came to rob! Beat him again.’\r\n\r\n_Culprit._ ‘I will never commit a theft again.’\r\n\r\n_Kaid._ ‘No: that you shall not.’ (After some more stripes,\r\nthe poor wretch is led off prisoner.)\r\n\r\nThe approach to Marákesh is thus described:—\r\n\r\n_April 7._ Struck our tents an hour before sunrise and continued\r\nour journey to the southward, over a vast plain extending to the\r\neast and west farther than the eye could see. About eight a.m. we\r\nreached the foot of the hills called Jebíla, where there are many\r\nwells and a kubba-topped sanctuary. A few tents were pitched in the\r\nneighbourhood. The place is called Suánnia.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a hasty breakfast we ascended the Jebíla (meaning in\r\nArabic, small mountains); they are almost barren. Here and there a\r\nshrub of the ‘sidder[13]’ and a sweet-smelling acacia is to be\r\nseen. At half-past ten, on descending the Jebíla, we came in sight\r\nof the Moorish capital, in which stood most prominent the lofty\r\ntower of the mosque called Kutubía. In the foreground lay a forest\r\nof palms, and in the background the snow-capped gigantic range of\r\nthe Atlas. Owing to the intense heat of the day a waving atmosphere\r\nveiled in great measure the grandeur of the scenery. The soldiers\r\npointed out to me the mountain which my father had ascended as far\r\nas the snow on his first mission to the Sultan, when he visited the\r\nhigh-perched village of Mesfíwa. At noon we entered the palm forest;\r\nthese palm-trees are valuable property and belong to the Sultan and\r\nthe townspeople. There are no enclosures, but each proprietor knows\r\nthe trees that belong to him. The trees had begun to put forth their\r\nflower, which consists of a white stalk, with a mass of small flowers\r\nin a sheath, looking in the distance like a white leaf.\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve we reached the river Tensift, a fine clear\r\nstream, over which there is a bridge of twenty-five arches, built,\r\nI believe, by a Spaniard some years ago. Here we pitched our tents,\r\nas we are not to enter Marákesh until the morning.\r\n\r\n_April 8._ On crossing the river this morning a body of cavalry of\r\nthe district of Erhamna met us, with their Kaid and twenty banners,\r\nin the midst of a fierce powder-play. After another hundred yards\r\nwe were met by the Bokhári guard with their Kaid and twenty-five\r\nbanners, who were succeeded by the troops of Mulai Dris, the native\r\nsoldiers of the city, with twenty-five banners of all colours, white\r\npredominating; lastly, by the immediate followers or body-guard of the\r\nSultan with the green Sherifian flag and other banners. Lab-el-barod,\r\nwhich a Frenchman might translate into ‘La belle parade,’ never\r\nceased along the whole road, some three miles, to Marákesh. The\r\ndust was insufferable; the troops kept charging, reining in and\r\nfiring their guns within a few feet of us. The road was narrow,\r\nas a wood of palm-trees flanked us on the right and left, and the\r\nrush of cavalry was terrific. Every moment you would have supposed\r\nthey must have trampled down our party before they could check their\r\nhorses. Several messengers, the immediate attendants of the Sultan\r\nand Uzir, came to welcome me on the part of His Majesty, repeating\r\nthe word ‘Mahababek,’ you are welcome. I cannot tell what may\r\nhave been the number of cavalry that met us; but as I am told there\r\nare a hundred to each banner, there ought to have been from seven\r\nto eight thousand men. It is said that the Sultan ordered every\r\nhorseman in the city of Marákesh and the camp to meet us. By the\r\nwayside I observed a number of people begging, with large straw hats\r\non their heads. The straw hat in the neighbourhood of Marákesh is\r\na sign that the wearer is a leper: there are numbers of these poor\r\nwretches; a separate town is given them—called Hara—and they are\r\nnot allowed to enter the city of Marákesh or communicate with the\r\ninhabitants except on a Thursday, on which day they say this horrid\r\ndisease is not catching, as a great Moorish saint pronounced that\r\non that day leprosy should not be contagious.\r\n\r\nAfter riding some half-mile along the town wall of this great capital,\r\nwe entered the gate called ‘Bab Hamár.’ At the entrance were\r\nthe tents of the troops (infantry).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n          RESIDENCE AT MARÁKESH AND RETURN TO TANGIER. 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 9._ Twenty-five guards were sent by the Sultan last night to\r\nbe distributed around the garden and walls of the palace, so we are\r\nwell taken care of. The chief of the guard wanted to lock my door\r\non the outside: I must indeed be very precious to be considered\r\nworthy of such care; and, like a strange bird of value, am well\r\nfed and closely caged. I hear also that one hundred cavalry patrol\r\nthe streets near our dwelling every night. To-day we are as state\r\nprisoners and must take our rest _malgré nous_, I am not to see the\r\nSultan or his ministers, I understand, according to the usual form,\r\ntill I have had at least three days’ rest: this is tiresome, for\r\nI should best be pleased by an immediate audience and the prompt\r\nconclusion of all I have to say or settle.\r\n\r\nThe garden that surrounds our house, and in which our horses are\r\npicketed, is a wilderness; full of orange, olive, walnut, palm,\r\nplum and pear-trees, with vines, pomegranates and rose-trees in\r\nfull flower. A harvest of beautiful rose blossoms is gathered every\r\nmorning for making attar of roses. From our terrace on the house top\r\nlittle is to be seen but low ruins with gardens, and here and there a\r\ntall mosque, whilst within a few hundred yards of our palace towers\r\nthe Kutubía with its gilded ball on the top. This ancient mosque\r\nis still in good preservation, and is used as a place of worship,\r\nso there is no hope of our seeing the interior. The tower does not\r\nappear so high as that of Hassan at Rabát, nor indeed so symmetrical\r\nor ornamented, nevertheless it is a beautiful remnant of Moorish\r\narchitecture, and proudly rears its lofty head above the miserable\r\ndwellings of the modern Moor.\r\n\r\n_April 10._ The Uzir has sent for my interpreter this morning. I\r\nprimed David, and told him to mention my wishes to come to business\r\nand have an audience without delay.\r\n\r\nA curious incident took place during David’s visit to the Uzir. I\r\nsent with him my soldier Abd-el-Kerim and a servant, Hadj Abd Selam,\r\nwho is a Sheríf and the grandson of the patron saint of Tangier,\r\nSid Mohammed-el-Hadj. The Uzir, on hearing who the latter was, went\r\nforward and kissed the hem of his garment, asking for his blessing;\r\nyet this holy man serves me in the double capacity of housemaid\r\nand valet.\r\n\r\nWhilst writing this, the Sheríf and my servant Kaddor have come to\r\ntell me they have just seen the Sultan returning from the mosque. When\r\nHis Majesty approached they prostrated themselves on the ground. The\r\nSultan reined in his horse and sent an usher to ask who they were\r\nand from whence they came. They replied, ‘We are servants of the\r\nRoman’ (meaning me). His Majesty sent them a civil message and\r\nrode on. We are living indeed in a country where there is a strange\r\nmixture of patriarchal and tyrannical government.\r\n\r\n_April 11._ Rode out at three o’clock, accompanied by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the Kaid of the town-guards, and a dozen of\r\nfoot-soldiers, also some of my own escort. I requested to be shown\r\nround the outside of the town. After riding through dilapidated\r\nstreets, in which there were no signs of present or past opulence\r\neither in the buildings or in anything else (Ben Yáhia calls this\r\ntown the ‘Mother of Villages,’ meaning that it is composed of\r\npoor buildings), we sallied out of one of the gates of the town and\r\ncommenced the circuit.\r\n\r\nOn our left were several picturesque tombs: here the great saint,\r\nSid Bel-Abbas, is interred, also many of the Sultans; amongst others,\r\nMulai Yazid, whose mother was an Irishwoman.\r\n\r\nIt is said that formerly the Moors erected busts or effigies over\r\nthe tombs of the Sultans in this city, typical of their good or bad\r\nqualities. Thus the liberal Sultan was depicted with a hand extended;\r\nthe sordid one with his hand closed; the warrior with a sword. Mulai\r\nYazid, being both a warrior and liberal, was represented with one\r\nhand open and a sword in the other.\r\n\r\nMulai Soliman, in a fit of fanaticism, destroyed all these effigies as\r\nbeing impious and against the interpretation of the law of the Prophet\r\nMohammed, and ordered inscriptions to be written in their places.\r\n\r\nAs we passed near this spot a negro saint, or holy maniac, brandished\r\na club at us. But the Lieutenant-Governor, beckoning him to his\r\nside, kissed his garment, and the saint, patting his Excellency\r\non the back, satisfied his diseased brain by pointing his stick,\r\nas a gun, at our cursed Nazareneships. The Lieutenant-Governor was\r\nnot communicative and seemed to dislike the evening’s jaunt; so,\r\nI suppose, he accompanied me _malgré lui_. He rode the whole way\r\nmuttering his prayers, and every now and then, holding his hand in\r\nthe manner that is called ‘fatha’ towards some distant saint’s\r\ntomb, he appeared to pray; but perhaps called down imprecations on\r\nour doomed heads. God bless the old fool! If I had an hour’s talk\r\nwith him, I would leave him some doubts as to which of us is the\r\nmost fit for Jehannum.\r\n\r\nWe rode for an hour-and-a-half round the walls, and yet, as I am told,\r\nhad not got half way. As sunset was nigh, I proposed to finish our\r\nride round the town another day.\r\n\r\nWe entered a gate near the Kutubía mosque, and passing by a very\r\nhandsome archway, now blocked up, but formerly, I am told, leading to\r\na Governor’s house, we rode past ruins and through gardens in the\r\nmidst of them. This town was once very extensive. It is said to have\r\nhad formerly four hundred thousand inhabitants. I don’t give it now\r\na hundred thousand. The ancient mosques, which are numerous and very\r\nhandsome, show what it must have been; and the inside of the Kutubía,\r\nof which we had a glance in passing, is quite a maze of columns. An\r\nold soldier of the Second Guards, in writing of this capital,\r\ndescribed its numerous but narrow streets in ancient times thus:\r\n‘When the traveller entered the city gates he did not see sunshine\r\nagain until he left the town.’ In speaking of the value of the land,\r\nwhich is now worthless and sold at the lowest price for gardens,\r\nhe said, ‘Ground was formerly purchased by covering the surface to\r\nbe bought with coins laid close to one another.’ He spoke also of\r\nthe denseness of the population, the wealth of the inhabitants, and\r\nfacility of making money in those times, and records a tradition that\r\na vendor of sugar-plums made five hundred ducats in one day by hawking\r\nhis goods at Bab-el-Khemés—or Thursday-gate—which is now closed.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned that we passed, outside the town, the Hara,\r\nor village of lepers; it is close to the walls of the city.\r\n\r\nTwo lepers were standing near the roadside begging. I gave them a\r\nfew pieces of money. These wretched people live almost entirely upon\r\nalms. The Sultan gives them annually about seven thousand ducats,\r\nor about a thousand pounds sterling. I hear that their children prove\r\nsometimes quite free of the malady, but the curse is in their blood\r\nand they must remain in the Hara and intermarry with lepers. People\r\nof bad character, or those condemned for crime, often, I am told,\r\nescape to the Hara, and find concealment there by assuming the\r\ncovering of the lepers and living with them, until perhaps they\r\nbecome lepers or their crimes are forgotten.\r\n\r\n_April 12._ Received a letter from the Sultan, at half-past six\r\nthis morning, to say that H.S.M. had appointed eight a.m. for the\r\naudience. I tumbled out of bed and gave my directions to prepare\r\nthe presents and to have each box borne by a mule and the smaller\r\ncases on the heads of men—altogether eleven packages. Whilst I was\r\nyet dressing, the Kaid Madáni—General of the Sultan’s household\r\ntroops—came to say that we were to mount and leave our dwelling at\r\nhalf-past seven. We were punctual to our time: I, leading the van,\r\nwith the Kaid Madáni; St. Leger, Escazena and the Doctor immediately\r\nbehind us. Having traversed various narrow streets and lanes,\r\nand passed under some half-dozen horse-shoe archways, we entered\r\na large square in front of the Sultan’s palace, in ‘Ghásats\r\nE’Nil.’ The entrance to this palace, where the Sultan’s ladies\r\nare living, is through a gate called ‘Bab Khadár,’ or ‘the\r\nGreen Gate.’ We left this gate and the forbidden fruit it led to,\r\non our left. Before we had reached the opposite side of the square,\r\nmessengers were running backwards and forwards, from the Uzir and Mul\r\nMeshwa (the Lord High Chamberlain) to the Kaid Madáni, telling us\r\nto halt, or to advance. After several halts, we came to the gate of\r\nKubbats E’Suiera, or the ‘Picture Cupola.’ Here we dismounted,\r\nand leaving our animals and the presents at the door, entered again\r\ninto another large yard or square, about a quarter of a mile in length\r\nand rather less in breadth. The sides were lined with soldiers, who\r\npresented arms to us in the Moorish fashion—i.e. shouldering them.\r\n\r\nIn front of the gateway of the palace, or rather kiosk, were placed\r\nthree brass field-pieces (about eight pounders) and three dismounted\r\niron guns (twenty-four pounders). Two soldiers, shouldering each\r\na long pike, stood near the cannon facing the kiosk. Here we were\r\nagain halted for a couple of minutes, when the Mul Meshwa beckoned us\r\nforward and, advancing at a very slow, respectful pace, we approached\r\nthe Sherifian gate. The entrance to the kiosk was not what I should\r\nhave expected, for it was on a small scale and poorly ornamented. In\r\nthe hall sat several of the Sherifian secretaries and clerks. Here\r\nagain we were made to pause before we were brought to the foot of\r\na narrow winding staircase, which we ascended, preceded by the Mul\r\nMeshwa. On reaching the landing, where there was a gallery commanding\r\na fine view of a vast garden on the one side and of the court through\r\nwhich we had passed on the other, I saw two figures standing in a\r\ndoorway to our right. These persons were the Grand Uzir, Ben Dris,\r\nand the Minister, Sid Alarbi Mokta. The Mul Meshwa now stepped forward\r\nto the open doorway and made a low bow; I followed, and discovered\r\nthe Sultan seated on an ordinary chair, near an open window. I then\r\nalso made a low bow, and His Majesty said in a loud voice and with\r\na kind manner, ‘Zid’ (approach)—the Mul Meshwa adding in a\r\nlow voice, ‘our Lord says approach.’\r\n\r\nThe Mul Meshwa had now taken off his shoes, and, holding in my\r\nright hand the Queen’s letter of credence, I advanced a few paces\r\nand made another low bow. The Sultan repeated the word ‘Zid,’\r\nso again bowing I approached within about five steps of where\r\nH.S.M. was seated and, placing myself immediately in front of him,\r\nas the Mul Meshwa intimated, repeated my respectful obeisance. The\r\nMul Meshwa retired and I stood alone with the Sultan, who, looking\r\nvery gracious and smiling, said, ‘You are welcome! The bonds of\r\npeace and friendship which have existed from ancient time between\r\nour ancestors and the ancestors of your sovereign still continue and\r\nshall endure. We hold your Queen and nation as the most friendly,\r\nabove all sovereigns and nations, to our Royal person.\r\n\r\n‘We knew your father; he was well inclined to us, proved a faithful\r\nservant of the two Governments, and we held him in favour as one of\r\nthe chosen of the Empire. We have now become acquainted with you,\r\nand the friendship and good-will which we held towards your father\r\nshall be inherited by you. What is your first name?’\r\n\r\nBowing, I replied, and the Sultan resumed: ‘You are the bearer of\r\na letter from your Queen.’ Then, calling Ben Dris, said to him,\r\n‘Take the letter for me from the Consul; I shall read it and the\r\nanswer shall be given, if it please God, at another time.’\r\n\r\nSid Ben Dris advanced barefoot, and, making a low bow, took the\r\nletter and retired to his post.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan, having paused in his speech, I made a suitable reply.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan then made a sign to the Mul Meshwa to advance and said to\r\nhim, ‘Show the Consul my gardens, and take him wherever he wishes,\r\nso as to afford him amusement and pleasure.’\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this subject I must record the appearance and dress of\r\nSultan Mulai Abderahman. He appeared a middle-sized man of some sixty\r\nyears of age with a dark complexion, of a shade lighter than that\r\nof a mulatto, short black beard, arched eyebrows, large black eyes\r\nwith a slight squint in one eye (but not so as to give an unpleasant\r\nexpression), nose long and aquiline. He had a healthy appearance,\r\nand a very kind and benign expression of face. He was dressed in a\r\nwhite ‘haik’ which hid his under garments; over the ‘haik’\r\nhe wore a white ‘sulham,’ or burnous; on his head a high red\r\ncap and a white turban, and yellow slippers on his bare feet. There\r\nwas no emblem of royalty near his person, nor any attendant except\r\nthose outside the room.\r\n\r\nIt has been the custom for the Sultan to give his first audience to\r\nEuropeans in my position, on horseback, with the Imperial umbrella\r\nover his head and in an open court. My reception is considered a very\r\nfavourable one, and it is thought that H.S.M. has shown me especial\r\ncondescension. In fact, I am told that I have been ‘the most\r\nfavoured of Envoys that have ever come to the Sherifian presence.’\r\n\r\nWe returned by the same staircase and entrance: our horses had been\r\nbrought near to the doorway; we mounted, and accompanied by the Mul\r\nMeshwa, visited the several gardens of the Sultan. There were few\r\nflowers but roses; these were in abundance and most sweet. Trellises\r\nof vines, groves of orange-trees, woods of pomegranate, olive, peach,\r\npear, citron, lemon, palm, apple, plum, fig and other trees covered\r\nthese vast cultivated wildernesses. Straight tápia walls enclosed\r\nthese gardens and thousands of vines, from which the infant grapes\r\nwere peeping, were trained against them on canes.\r\n\r\n_April 13._ At twelve o’clock I had a conference with the Uzir Ben\r\nDris at his private dwelling, a pretty Moorish house standing in the\r\nmiddle of a large garden, which is cultivated with far better taste,\r\nand shows a greater variety of flowers, than any of the Sultan’s\r\ngardens. His Excellency received me at the door and led me to a\r\npicturesque court with marble columns, mosaic pavements, and a\r\nbubbling fountain in the centre, with a view of orange-trees and\r\nroses to delight the eye on every side. A chair had been provided\r\nfor me, and the Uzir sat on a low mattress, handsomely covered,\r\nand furnished with piles of luxurious cushions. Two little slaves\r\nwere the only attendants present during our long conference. When a\r\nstep was heard in the garden his Excellency seemed to be under some\r\nanxiety lest there should be any eavesdroppers. Coffee was brought\r\nin by one of the slaves, and was served in handsome china cups,\r\nplaced on a bright brass tray inlaid with mosaic. His Excellency\r\nsipped from each cup that I partook of before handing it to me, to\r\nshow that it was free from poison, for this Uzir has sometimes given\r\na deadly feast to his guests, who, whilst partaking of ministerial\r\nhospitality, laid the seeds of some dread disease in the intestines\r\nwhich wore away their life in a few months or perhaps years.\r\n\r\nOur conference lasted three hours. The Uzir told me he was merely\r\nacting as the ‘ear of the Sultan,’ and that he was desired to\r\nreport every word to His Majesty, who alone would decide upon every\r\nmatter. In reply I said that, nevertheless, I should consider myself\r\nindebted to him if I could report favourably to our Government upon\r\nthe Sultan’s replies, which was sufficient to let him understand\r\nwhat my sentiments would be vice versâ.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I rode out; starting from the same gate by which we\r\nhad entered on a previous evening, and continuing our circuit round\r\nthe town, it was an hour and a half before we reached the gate we\r\nstarted from on the first day, so Marákesh must be a good twelve\r\nmiles in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the distant Atlas mountains was very grand.\r\n\r\n_April 14._ This morning, before I rose, a very beautiful bay horse\r\narrived as a present from the Sultan, brought by the head groom of\r\nH.S.M.’s stables. He was covered with a handsome horsecloth, and\r\nis one of the finest animals I have seen in the country: standing\r\na good fifteen hands and a half.\r\n\r\nAfter our breakfast, came Hadj Gabári, the jester of the Uzir,\r\nwith a note from his Excellency, of which this is a translation;—\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise to the one God!\r\n\r\nTo the mediator of the two nations, Mr. J. H. D. Hay. May God\r\nexalt you!\r\n\r\nThe bearer is sent to amuse you. Let the painter that is with you\r\nsee him and the various forms he can assume: he is a jester. Peace!\r\n\r\n                                            Finished 17th Rabea, 1262.\r\n\r\n\r\nHadj Gabári was a funny fellow, made all sorts of grimaces and a\r\nnumber of _bon mots_; had been in the East and spoke of Mehemet Ali;\r\ntold us that, when in Egypt, he had been called upon to serve in the\r\narmy, but got freed upon being told to march to see whether he would\r\nmake a good soldier. He then showed us how he had walked, which was\r\nmuch like the gait of one of Astley’s clowns. Hadj Gabári meant\r\nthis joke, I suspect, as a cut at the discipline of the Sultan’s\r\ntroops. Escazena made a very good caricature of the jester, with\r\none eye shut. I dispatched it to the Uzir, with a note to thank his\r\nExcellency for the amusement he had afforded, adding that I sent\r\nhim back two jesters, with only three eyes between them.\r\n\r\nI have been pointed out certain marks on my horse (turns of the hair)\r\nunderneath his neck, which the Moors assure me are the best guarantee\r\nthat the owner of the animal will never have any wish in life that he\r\nwill not obtain. My horse has also been turning up one of his hoofs\r\nor resting his foot, as all horses do, and I am told that this is\r\nhis ‘fatha’ or mode of prayer, and that he is praying God for\r\nhis own and his master’s welfare.\r\n\r\n_April 15._ Had another long interview with the Uzir. His Excellency\r\nhas promised verbally, in the name of the Sultan, to give a favourable\r\nanswer to each affair. We shall see how the letters run, for I have\r\nrequired that all be written—‘Quod scriptum est manet.’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan, it seems, is vastly pleased with the Queen’s gifts,\r\nespecially the long gun barrels.\r\n\r\nThe Uzir asked many questions about India and our late victories\r\nthere; about the war in China, our possessions there, &c., &c. I\r\nafforded him all the information he desired, and gave him some more\r\ndistinct ideas than he had before of our power and wealth, compared\r\nwith those of other nations, and let him understand (what few Moors\r\ndo) that we can be powerful without being tyrannical or oppressive;\r\nthat the weak and the strong nation are equally respected by us, if\r\nthey keep to their treaty engagements and show no ill-will towards\r\nus. I finished by saying that the peace of the world was the greatest\r\nblessing to mankind when founded upon such principles, and that\r\nthose nations with whom we had been at war in former times were now\r\nour good friends, whilst our old friends remained our best friends.\r\n\r\n_April 16._ Another horse was brought me this morning as a present\r\nfrom the Sultan. He is not so handsome as the last, but a fine animal.\r\n\r\nIt has always been customary, on the occasion of a visit of a\r\nConsul-General to the Sultan, for His Majesty to give two horses:\r\nto give less would be ominous of the Consul or his nation being out\r\nof favour.\r\n\r\n_April 17._ Saw from the roof of our dwelling the Sultan go to the\r\ngreat mosque, the Kutubía, at twelve o’clock. The new troops lined\r\nthe road. A large body of unmounted irregular troops marched before\r\nHis Majesty, who was immediately preceded by two lance-bearers. The\r\nSultan was dressed in white, as on the day of my reception, and\r\nmounted on a white horse. A man on foot held a large red silk\r\numbrella, with a gilt ball on the top and a long pole for a stick,\r\nover the ‘Exalted Presence.’\r\n\r\nSome thirty attendants, all dressed in white except for their red\r\ncaps, surrounded the person of the Sultan, from whom, with white\r\nhandkerchiefs, they kept off the flies. The regular troops presented\r\narms, and the drums beat as His Majesty passed, whilst the female\r\nspectators screamed the ‘zagharit,’ or shout of joy.\r\n\r\n_April 18._ Up before daylight. At seven o’clock the Sultan sent\r\nfor me, and mounted on the Sherifian gift, I rode with a train\r\nof soldiers to the Ghásats E’Nil, or the Garden of the Nile,\r\nwhere it was arranged the audience should take place. The Mul Meshwa\r\nmet me at the palace gate with his attendants, and I was conducted\r\ninto a court some two hundred yards square, at the end of which,\r\nnear the doorway of the palace, sat the ‘Exalted Presence’\r\non a raised platform in the open air. His Majesty was seated at\r\nfirst on a divan, but whilst I approached with measured steps, the\r\ndivan was exchanged for a chair. Ben Dris was standing near. After\r\nvarious bows I came within some few paces of H.S.M. and then halted,\r\nwhen the Sultan said, ‘We have been glad to become acquainted with\r\nyou; we had very friendly feelings towards your father, and have now\r\nthe same towards you. Our minister has reported to us all you have\r\nrepresented, and we see that you are a prudent person and desirous\r\nof serving faithfully the interests of the two countries.’\r\n\r\nI thanked His Majesty for such flattering sentiments, and expressed\r\nalso my grateful acknowledgements for the readiness with which he had\r\ngiven ear and consented to the settlement of the various affairs that\r\nhad been brought under his notice by the Uzir; but at the same time\r\nI urgently begged that he would keep in mind those affairs relating\r\nto commerce, upon which depended most important interests, as also\r\nthe welfare of a large class of His Majesty’s subjects and those\r\nof my gracious Sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan replied that he should bear them in mind, but that he\r\nrequired time to consider the matter.\r\n\r\nI then took leave, and H.S.M. commanded that I should be taken into\r\nthe interior of the court and garden where his harem resided—a\r\nspecial favour which, the Sultan added, had been granted to my\r\nfather, and therefore ‘the son should have the same privilege.’\r\nAccompanied by two eunuchs, for I was now to be admitted within\r\nthe prison cage of many a wild and lovely woman, we passed under a\r\nlofty archway, in which were two small carriages like bath-chairs,\r\nand entered the garden; like the rest in Marákesh, full of oranges,\r\nroses, and fruit-trees, adorned with fountains and wide walks. As\r\nwe passed along the avenues I saw the spectre of a female vanish at\r\nour approach, and, as far as I dared indulge my curiosity, she was\r\nas pale and pretty as the negresses that accompanied her were sooty\r\nand hideous. The fair Sultana’s dress was white, and I confess I\r\nhardly observed how it was made, as I strained my vision to see her\r\nface rather than her form. At the windows, or small loop-holes of the\r\npalace, I could hear _en passant_ whispers, and saw visions of tips of\r\nfingers, both white and black, and brilliant eyes darting fiery looks.\r\n\r\nI came back by the way I had entered. The Sultan had retired. Ben\r\nDris was still there, and we settled all remaining matters.\r\n\r\nOn April 18 Mr. Hay left Marákesh. On the 19th he writes:—While\r\nresting to-day, one of my Bokhári guards gave me a history of\r\nthe origin of their becoming the body-guard of the Moorish Sultan,\r\nwhich legend I introduce as follows.\r\n\r\nMulai Ismael, who reigned some two hundred years ago, was one of the\r\nmost powerful but vainglorious of the Moorish potentates who have\r\nbeen shadowed by the Sherifian umbrella. Desirous of extending his\r\ndominions, and in consequence of the black Kings of Sudan, Timbuktu,\r\n&c., not having sent him the customary annual present for some years,\r\nhe determined to march into the desert and subdue the petty princes of\r\nthe interior, who reigned over districts contiguous to his dominions.\r\n\r\nHaving prepared an army of ten thousand men he marched towards\r\nTimbuktu.\r\n\r\nThe Bokhári Kaid here described the sufferings and loss the army\r\nwas said to have experienced on traversing the desert.\r\n\r\nOn approaching Timbuktu Mulai Ismael learnt to his dismay that the\r\nSultan of Sudan had surrounded him with a force tenfold his own,\r\nand that in a few hours he might expect to be overwhelmed; upon which\r\nH.M. wept, and sent for his Uzir, who, being a cunning and wise man,\r\nsaid, ‘Weep not, O mighty One! Grant that I go as Ambassador to\r\nthe Sultan of Sudan. Give me full powers to act as I think best,\r\nand I will guarantee that your Majesty shall retire hence with all\r\nhonour and without losing a man.’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan then issued his Royal firman to the Uzir to act as he\r\ndeemed right for the good of Islam; so the wily Uzir, taking presents\r\nwith him and a flag of peace, set out for the camp of the Sultan\r\nof Sudan, by whom he was received with much pomp and magnificence,\r\nand to whom he thus declared the object of his mission:—\r\n\r\n‘Sultan of Sultans, King of the black race, my master the Sultan\r\nof Fas and Marákesh, &c., &c., sends you greeting and gifts. He has\r\ncome to these distant parts with all his followers, having heard of\r\nyour fame and power; and is desirous of allying himself to you by\r\ndemanding the hand in marriage of your Majesty’s daughter, whose\r\nbeauty the Moorish poets and songsters daily extol. Therefore, O\r\nMighty Prince, our Lord and Master doth homage to your most sable and\r\nqueenly daughter, and hath brought the chiefs of his kingdom and his\r\ntroops to show her and you that he is worthy of such a Royal prize.’\r\n\r\nThe black Sultan, who had been wroth with Mulai Ismael for his\r\napparently hostile and daring intrusion into his kingdom, now smiled\r\nwith joy at the flattering proposition made through the Uzir in\r\nthe name of the descendant of the Prophet, the ‘Prince of the\r\nFaithful.’\r\n\r\nThe demand was acceded to. The sable daughter of the Sultan of Sudan\r\nwas betrothed to Mulai Ismael. Rich presents in gold and silver,\r\nand ten thousand black warriors, as a dowry, were presented to the\r\nSultan of Morocco to wait upon the dark bride. These troops and\r\ntheir descendants have ever since formed the most faithful guards\r\nof his Majesty the Sultan of Morocco.\r\n\r\nThis same Sultan, Mulai Ismael, after a revolt of his troops, it is\r\nsaid, formed a body of some twenty thousand Jews as regular cavalry,\r\nthinking that though they had not the courage of Mussulmans, he\r\nwould find them more faithful subjects.\r\n\r\nShortly after they had been trained in the art of war, His Majesty\r\nordered his Jewish troops to march against some rebels near the\r\ntown of Fas. The Jews, who were tired of soldiers’ fare and the\r\nhardships of the life, bethought them how best to be freed from\r\nsuch misery. A learned Rabbi and General of the troops, after some\r\nreflection, undertook to obtain this freedom; so the very day they\r\nwere to march from Fas, he waited on the Sultan and said, that\r\nthough he and his brethren were all ready and eager for battle and\r\nto fight in H.M.’s cause, they begged their Lord the Sultan would\r\nsend a few of his guards with the army to prevent the Moorish boys\r\ninsulting them; ‘for our Lord the Sultan knows,’ said the wily\r\nRabbi, ‘that a Jew cannot strike a Moslem.’\r\n\r\nMulai Ismael disbanded _instanter_ the Israelitish army.\r\n\r\n_April 20._ Pursuing our course for some seven or eight miles\r\nover an arid plain famous for fattening sheep, though the blades\r\nof parched grass in an acre might, I think, have been counted,\r\nwe reached, about seven o’clock, a fountain called Ain-Umast\r\n(Ain means eye or spring), near which were the remains of a large\r\nMoorish town. From this fountain we ascended into a hilly country\r\ncovered with the argan tree[14], from the fruit of which the argan\r\noil is extracted; the leaves of this tree are of a fine deep green,\r\nthe fruit is rather larger than an olive and pointed at one end. The\r\ntrees run from thirty to forty feet high, and their lower branches\r\nextend frequently to about the same length.\r\n\r\nThe trees were laden with fruit. Like the palms near Marákesh, every\r\ntree has its owner, though there appears to be a forest many miles\r\nin extent. The fruit is ripe in autumn, and the harvest is collected\r\nby threshing the trees. The fruit is then carried to magazines, and\r\ncamels and cattle fed upon it. They eat stone and all, but afterwards\r\nvoid the stone whole, which is again collected and taken to the mill,\r\nwhere it is crushed and the oil extracted. This is preferred by the\r\nMoors to olive oil for cookery.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the hilly ground has brought us into the\r\ndistrict of Shedma and into the northern part of Sus, one of the\r\ngreat divisions of Morocco. The Sus people, like the Shloh and the\r\nRifians, are aborigines: they are a fine race, small limbed, but tall\r\nand active. Here the place of the tent is taken by mud castles or\r\nwalled enclosures, within which they build their huts or small stone\r\nhouses. As we travelled on, though the sun was high in the heavens,\r\nthe air got cooler, and I fancied I could sniff the breeze from the\r\nsea. The country improved as we advanced: corn-fields amidst the argan\r\ntrees. Here and there orchards of fig, grape, and other fruit-trees,\r\nolive in abundance.\r\n\r\n_April 21._ We were off at daybreak, and rode for two hours through\r\na forest of argan and wild olives. We then entered a barren waste,\r\ncovered with steep sandhills, which drift like snow with the wind,\r\nso as to render it impossible, after a gale, to find a vestige or\r\ntrack of former passengers. These hills are from forty to eighty\r\nfeet high, almost perpendicular in the ascent and descent, and extend\r\nsome three or four miles from the coast.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque town of Mogador, or Suiera, presented itself as we\r\nreached the summit of these hills; it lies in a flat sandy plain\r\nand the sea washes its walls on the southern and western sides. In\r\nwinter the sea floods the plain, leaving Mogador as it were an island,\r\nexcept for a causeway over an aqueduct, raised some feet from the\r\nground. On our approach to the town, the batteries saluted me with\r\neleven guns, which was responded to by Her Majesty’s steamer\r\nMeteor. The Governor and all the authorities came out to meet us,\r\nwith two hundred cavalry and three or four hundred infantry; all\r\nthe accustomed honours and parade were gone through.\r\n\r\nMogador is the European name given to the town of Suiera from a\r\nsaint’s tomb on an island, about half-a-mile from shore, called\r\nSid Mogdul. The island is fortified, and forms a shelter for\r\nshipping from the west and north winds. Mogador was built in the\r\nlast century, 1760 I think, by Sultan Mohammed Ben Abdallah. An\r\nimmense sum of money was laid out, as the Sultan built all the\r\nmerchants’ houses, as well as the walls of the town and many fine\r\nGovernment buildings. It was called by him Suiera, or the picture,\r\nfrom its regularity and handsome appearance when compared with the\r\ngenerality of other Moorish towns. The houses are fine buildings,\r\nsome of them three stories high; the streets broad and straight. The\r\ntwo main streets run through the town at right angles, so that you\r\ncan see out of each gate of the town at the same time. There are\r\nmany solid, neat archways dividing the different quarters of the town.\r\n\r\nThe walls, batteries, mosques, and public stores are solid and\r\nhandsome, but partaking rather of the European than Moorish style\r\nof architecture, therefore much less interesting to a European eye.\r\n\r\nSultan Mohammed built the town as an emporium for trade with\r\nthe interior, which it afterwards became; and several firms of\r\nBritish merchants of some wealth had been established here till the\r\nbombardment of the place by the French, when they escaped. Owing\r\nto the debts due by these persons to the Moorish Government and the\r\nloss of property they experienced by the plunder of the town by the\r\nwild tribes, they have not returned either to claim their property\r\nor to liquidate their debts. At the earnest request of the Governor,\r\nI passed the night at this place.\r\n\r\nEmbarking on board the Meteor on April 22, Mr. Hay reached Tangier\r\non the 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter, written on this expedition to his friend the\r\nHon. A. Gordon, Mr. Hay gives some interesting notes on the habits\r\nof the Moors. He says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friend N. was right when he said the Moors do not smoke. The\r\nMoors are perhaps the most fanatical of the Mohammedan sect, and\r\nmuch stricter in observance of the laws of their prophet than their\r\nbrethren in the East. Smoking is looked upon as a sin; for smoking\r\nis supposed by them to produce intoxication—or at least a slight\r\naberration of the senses—and can therefore be placed in the same\r\ncategory as wine, which was forbidden by Mohammed solely on that\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nA Mohammedan sage was once asked what was the greatest sin a\r\nman could commit. He replied—‘To get drunk,’ and told the\r\nfollowing parable: ‘A certain man of good repute drank large\r\npotations of the juice of the grape until he became intoxicated and\r\nlost his senses. When in that state, _he lied, he stole, he committed\r\nadultery and murder_; none of which sins would he have been capable of\r\ncommitting had he not sinned against the Koran by drinking wine.’\r\nThe Moor, however, when he does drink wine, drinks to get drunk, and\r\nwhen he smokes he uses a herb called ‘kif,’ a species of hemp,\r\nwhich produces much the same effect on the senses as opium.\r\n\r\nHere and there you find a Tangerine with a cigar in his mouth; but\r\nthen you may be sure he is a worthless fellow and has learnt the\r\nvice from the ‘Nazarenes.’ Tobacco is much used in the form of\r\nsnuff, and the snuff of the town of Tetuan is deservedly famed for\r\nits pungent flavour.\r\n\r\n‘Ahel tanbakko lil Jinnats yasbakko’ is a Moorish doggerel couplet\r\nmeaning, ‘Snuff-takers enter heaven first.’ This may be said to\r\nreconcile many a snuff-taker to his box of vice, whereas those who\r\ndo not so indulge take the proverb in another sense as inferring\r\nthat the snuff-takers have a short life.\r\n\r\nThe Moor takes his snuff as we Highlanders do; not in a pinch, but\r\nby laying it along the hollow of the back of his thumb. Very small\r\ncocoa-nut shells, having a narrow ivory mouth-piece, form the usual\r\nstyle of box, to which is attached by a small chain an ivory pin to\r\nstir up the snuff, which is jerked through the orifice. But I am\r\ngrowing tiresome, and though snuff may keep the attention awake,\r\nit will not do so, I fear, when taken in this manner and in so\r\nplentiful a dose.\r\n\r\nYou ask about the Jews in this country; much may be said, and I\r\nwill endeavour in subsequent letters to tell you all I know. They\r\nare a sadly degraded race, full of bigotry and superstition, but\r\nretaining their activity, cunning, and love for each other, together\r\nwith an extraordinary firmness in their belief—for which, indeed,\r\nthese persecuted people have been always famed in every clime.\r\n\r\nThe Jew of Morocco, next to the Negro in the West Indies and America,\r\nis the most persecuted and degraded of God’s creatures. In Tangier\r\nand the seaport towns, through the Christian Representatives, the\r\nJews have ever received a certain indirect countenance and support,\r\nbut in the interior their fate is a very hard one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Jews in Morocco was one that greatly interested\r\nMr. Hay. In subsequent notes and letters, as the following extracts\r\nshow, he redeemed his promise to Mr. Gordon. Thus he writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Jews, I have knowledge of there being a population\r\nof about four or five thousand in the Atlas mountains beyond the\r\ncity of Marákesh, and they are said to have lived there ever since\r\nthe time of Solomon.\r\n\r\nThese Jews are armed, but are not independent; each Jewish family\r\nhaving its Moorish master, or protector. In the feuds of the Moors\r\nin the mountainous regions they take part and, by their active\r\nand warlike life, acquire a far more independent spirit than their\r\nbrethren of the seaport towns and of the capitals. There is some\r\ntradition about their Rabbis possessing a document containing the\r\nsignet of Joab, who was sent to collect tribute from them in the\r\ntime of the son of David.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 there still existed an ancient inscription in Hebrew graven\r\non a stone in the Dra country, which was said to be as follows:\r\nעד כאן הגיץ יואב בן צרויה לקבל המס which\r\nis interpreted thus, ‘So far as this place came Joab Ben (son of)\r\nSerruia to receive the tribute.’\r\n\r\nJoab, chief of the army of King David, is called in the recognised\r\ntranslation of the Bible ‘the son of Zeruiah.’\r\n\r\nA drunken Rabbi, named Judah Azalia, called on me the other day;\r\nhe has been travelling for three years in the southern districts of\r\nMorocco, and he visited also many of the towns and villages bordering\r\non the Great Desert beyond Dra, which province you will find marked\r\nin the map. Judah was half intoxicated, as usual, when he visited me,\r\nand he left Tangier before I could entrap him in a sober moment. Judah\r\nhad travelled much in the East, had read a number of curious old\r\nbooks, and was full of traditions he had picked up in the interior\r\nof this country; but all he told me was in such a jumbled state that\r\nI could not retain it, but requested the learned and drunken Rabbi\r\nto commit to paper the subject-matter of our conversation.\r\n\r\nI send you a translation of the Hebrew original.\r\n\r\nFrom the _preface_ you will expect much; but, alas! there is only\r\nthe phantom of a skeleton, whose doubtful apparition leaves us big\r\nwith fancies and uncertainty. The man knows nothing of geography or\r\nhistory, except the Bible.\r\n\r\nYou will be struck with the tradition of the Jews of the interior\r\nrespecting the tribe of Naphtali, the tombs, &c. I regret he\r\nhas curtailed greatly his verbal statements; for, amongst other\r\ncurious matter, he told me of a burial-ground of the Jews in the\r\ninterior—some mile or mile and a half in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe story about the Israelite warriors is curious, but the staining\r\nof the hair before battle looks more like the Goths.\r\n\r\nJudah supposes that Wadan is much nearer the Red Sea than it really\r\nis; but if the Naphtali tribes fled from captivity, through Central\r\nAfrica, towards Dra and the South of Morocco, one of the first towns\r\nor villages at which they would have found means of subsistence,\r\nwould have been Wadden or Yaden.\r\n\r\nThe names of the places and towns are so different from those given\r\nin our maps, as indeed they always appear to be when mentioned by\r\nnatives of the interior, that I can hardly recognise them, and have\r\nno time just now to refer to my maps of Africa.\r\n\r\nJudah has promised to send me a further memorandum, but the fumes\r\nof ‘agua ardiente’ will, I fear, stifle all recollection of\r\nhis promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TRANSLATION FROM THE HEBREW.\r\n\r\nI am about to give a description respecting my brethren of Israel,\r\nwho, through captivity, are now dwelling in Western Barbary, and to\r\ntell—as far as my knowledge permits—of their state, their mode\r\nof living and genealogy; being in conformity with what has been\r\nrelated to me by wise old men and persons of integrity and good\r\nfaith, incapable of stating an untruth. I will further relate what\r\nI have personally witnessed during the travels of my youth, as also\r\nthe information I have obtained from ancient and exact tradition,\r\nboth in manuscript and in print.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that when Sennacherib (? Shalmaneser[15]), king\r\nof Assyria, conquered the people of Israel, these (the Israelites),\r\nwere led into captivity to Lahleh (? Halah) and Habor. Thence all the\r\nIsraelite tribe of Naphtali, or the greater portion thereof, sought\r\nrefuge in Vaden, a town situated on the limits of Guinea (meaning\r\nCentral Africa), which town had at that time direct communication with\r\nLahleh and Habor. From Vaden they (the Israelites) were scattered to\r\nDaha[16], Tafilelt, and Vakka[17] which are situated on the confines\r\nof the Province of Daha towards Ofran, according to the writings of\r\nthe pious Rabbi, Jakob Benisargan, who places Vakka upon the borders\r\nof the river of Daha. Thus were the Israelites spread throughout\r\nthe interior of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn Vaden there is a large burial ground of Jews, whose sepulchres are\r\ncovered with slabs of stone bearing very intelligible epitaphs. In\r\nVaden there is a synagogue where fragments of the Pentateuch and of\r\nthe Prophets, written on parchment, are to be found.\r\n\r\nIn Ofran is to be seen a carved stone with a Hebrew inscription\r\nwhich has existed since the destruction of the first temple. In\r\nthe burial ground there are several tombstones bearing epitaphs,\r\nof which the genealogy is written in the Hebrew character but in\r\nthe Arabic tongue: some of these are dated three hundred years ago,\r\nothers go as far back as twelve hundred years.\r\n\r\nFrom Ofran you journey to Eleg[18], where there exists a large\r\ncongregation of Jews; exactly as is related by the famous and\r\nillustrious Rabbi, Izak Barseset. In Ofran there stands a building\r\nwhich it is supposed was erected by one of the ancient kings\r\nof Western Barbary. It is constructed with large hewn square\r\nstones. There are also ruins of buildings which are supposed to\r\nbe Roman.\r\n\r\nThen comes the town of Telin, and later that of Thala, where\r\nthere exists even at the present time an immense stone, and at its\r\nfoot is a pool of water. The old people of the place tell you of a\r\ntradition that upon this stone the Israelite warriors prepared a dye\r\nof ‘henna[19]’, with which they dyed their hair before going to\r\nbattle. They relate that the number of the said warriors amounted to\r\nfour hundred thousand cavalry. It is said that on one occasion the\r\nenemies of these warriors treacherously came to offer peace upon any\r\nconditions that might be imposed. The peace having been concluded\r\non the sacred day of Kipur[20], all the Israelites were unarmed,\r\nbut the enemy had hidden their own arms in the sand.\r\n\r\nThe Israelites, glad to profit by so advantageous a peace—and not\r\nsuspecting any treachery—approached the hostile army, perceiving\r\nalso that they had no arms, when suddenly a preconcerted signal\r\nwas given, and the latter, rushing upon the Israelites, cut them\r\nto pieces. One slave alone survived this most fatal misfortune,\r\nand he buried the bodies of the slain. On account of their number\r\nhe put ten bodies into each grave, but for the last grave there\r\nwere only nine bodies, so the slave—overwhelmed with grief and\r\nsorrow—threw himself into the grave to complete the ten. Even to\r\nthe present time this spot is called ‘The sepulchre of the ten.’\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from Eleg, there is a celebrated fountain called\r\nRas-el-Ain (the source of the spring), so called because there is\r\na spring of water at forty fathoms below the surface. The fountain\r\ncan be followed three days’ journey irrigating the olive, fig,\r\npomegranate, almond, and palm trees, and the land is also thereby\r\nwatered for the cultivation of grain and vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe following towns or villages are to be noted as having Hebrews\r\namong the population: Zaachian, Lasakia, Takulebat, Torribat,\r\nBardlaiimi, and Taheret[21]. This last-mentioned town is noted for\r\nbeing the birthplace of many learned Jews and Rabbis in very ancient\r\ntimes. The most celebrated and illustrious Rabbi, Judah El Hayugni,\r\nwas born at Taheret. He it was who founded the grammar of our sacred\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nBeyond Taheret is the town of Lasats, which has a large Jewish\r\npopulation. In it there are gardens and fruit trees, which are\r\ncultivated with great success.\r\n\r\nThe best limes in Barbary are grown here, and are used in the\r\nreligious ceremonies of the Jews throughout Morocco.\r\n\r\n\r\nMulai Hashem, a native of Tafilelt, tells me that the Jews are very\r\nnumerous in his country. He says there are two races of Jews among\r\nthem, one race has been in Tafilelt since eight years previous to\r\nthe Hegira of Mohammed, the other having been brought in by a chief\r\nnamed Mulai Ali, the son of Mulai Hassan.\r\n\r\nMulai Ali, says my informant, had purchased these Jews from\r\nsome distant country of the East—where he found them in great\r\ndistress—and he gave fifty pieces of money for each: what money\r\nhe does not know.\r\n\r\nMulai Hashem says that these two races are thus distinguished. The\r\nolder race have the whole head shaved. The colony brought by Mulai\r\nAli leave a small segment of a circle unshaved on the top of the\r\nforehead. These latter also wear a black cap, somewhat pointed at\r\nthe top, where it is made to curl down on one side of the face.\r\n\r\nThe Jewesses are not dressed like those that live in Tangier, but\r\nin the costume of the Moorish woman, and wear rich dresses with\r\njewels. They are however to be distinguished from the Moorish woman\r\nby the arrangement of their hair, which the latter draw backwards\r\nfrom either side of the forehead over the temples to the back of the\r\nhead; whereas the Jewesses (unmarried) twist their hair in circles\r\non the top of the head. The married Jewesses are not allowed by the\r\nlaw to show their hair. This law, by the way, is not from the Bible,\r\nbut is an invention of the Rabbis.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, said Mulai Hashem, are well treated in Tafilelt, whilst\r\nthey behave well and according to the rules laid down for them;\r\nwhich, by the specimen of one that he gave, appear sufficiently\r\nhumiliating—viz. that should a Jew pass or be passed by a Sheríf,\r\nhe, the Jew, must take off his shoes; or, if mounted, must dismount,\r\nunless specially absolved by the Sheríf.\r\n\r\nHe tells me that they exercise all the crafts which are practised\r\nin the country, except tilling the soil. It appears that the Jews\r\nthemselves seldom, if ever, accompany the ‘kafilas’ (caravans),\r\nbut, he says, they have commercial dealings with the Sudan country.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the Tafilelt Jews are much at their ease,\r\nif one may judge from the joking adage—according to Mulai Hashem\r\ncommon in Tafilelt—that ‘forty Mohammedans work for one Jew.’\r\nMulai Hashem said that the Filali Jews, or Jews of Tafilelt, speak the\r\nShloh tongue as well as the Arabic, and whenever they wish to say what\r\nthey would not have known to Moors or others they speak in Hebrew.\r\n\r\nA learned Jew of this country tells me that all Arabs and Moors\r\nwhose names are composed with Ben are of an Israelitish origin.\r\n\r\nMulai Hashem tells me that the following oath is administered in his\r\ncountry to the Jews, and that they will rather give back anything\r\nthey may have come by unjustly than take so grave an oath:—\r\n\r\n‘By God, there is no other God but He, the Eternal and Just—who\r\nuttered His word upon the mighty hill—and by the truth of the\r\nexistence of the two palm-trees which meet together over the river\r\n_Sebts_, and by the Book of Moses—peace be upon him—and by the\r\nTen Commandments delivered unto Moses, and by all that is contained\r\nin his Book, the _Gadi_, God forbid that I should add or diminish\r\nin this affair, else may God destroy my memory, and may the name of\r\nmy family be never mentioned in the world.’\r\n\r\n_Sebts_ is the Arabic for Sabbath, and is here applied to the fabled\r\nriver called by the Jews Sabbatyon.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what is meant by _Gadi_.\r\n\r\nA Jewish Rabbi, named Benshiten, tells me that two and a half tribes\r\nof Israel are the portion which make up the number of Jews that\r\nare found in Europe and Africa—and the remaining nine and a half\r\nare found to exist on the East of a river which is named Sabbatyon,\r\nand is said to be to the East of Mecca. This river, said he, has the\r\npeculiarity of the stones in its bed fighting with each other all\r\nthe week excepting the Sabbath, on which day Hebrews cannot travel;\r\nso that the nine and a half tribes cannot communicate with their\r\nseparated brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hay, it may be added, was the first to break through some of the\r\ndespotic rules imposed by the Moors on the Jews. On his arrival at\r\nTangier in 1844 the Hebrew interpreters attached to the different\r\nConsulates were obliged to remove—as did their brethren—their\r\nslippers on passing a mosque or other sanctuary. When he paid\r\nhis visit of ceremony to the Basha, on succeeding his father as\r\nConsul-General and Political Agent, Mr. Hay went, according to the\r\ncustom of those days, in full uniform. He was accompanied by his\r\nstaff, of which one member—the Interpreter, Mr. David Sicsu—was a\r\nJew, a shrewd and able man, who had been attached for some years to\r\nthe British Consulate. On their way to the Basha’s residence they\r\npassed the great mosque. Mr. Hay noticed that Sicsu stopped and took\r\noff his shoes; so turning, he called out to him in a loud voice, that\r\nall might hear, ‘What are you doing? Put on your shoes. Remember\r\nyou are an English employé and, as such, have all the privileges of\r\nBritish subjects. If ever you do that again, I shall dismiss you.’\r\n\r\nAlso, on his first visit to the Sultan’s Court, in 1846, Mr. Hay\r\ninsisted on his Jewish interpreters being allowed to ride about the\r\ncapital on mule-back, and to enjoy the same rights and privileges\r\nas granted to other members of his staff.\r\n\r\nIt is only within the last thirty years that Jews in Morocco—not\r\nforeign employés or protected subjects—have been allowed to assume\r\nthe European dress, or to wear yellow slippers or red caps when in\r\nnative costume. Formerly they were compelled to confine themselves\r\nto black slippers and caps and the Jewish gaberdine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n        DIFFICULTIES OF MR. HAY’S POSITION AT TANGIER. 1846-54.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith characteristic energy and perseverance Mr. Hay endeavoured to\r\nincrease the influence and develope the trade of Great Britain in\r\nMorocco, then greatly on the decline. But at every turn he met with\r\nmany obstacles. Not the least of these was the warlike attitude of\r\nFrance towards Morocco as compared with the peaceful policy of Great\r\nBritain. To the ignorant, barbarian Moors quiet strength appeared\r\nto be weakness, while they were in a corresponding degree impressed\r\nby the restless activity of the French, who, in consequence of the\r\nmachinations of Abd-el-Kader, were then on uneasy terms with the\r\nSultan, and left no means untried to consolidate their influence and\r\nto acquire sole predominance over him. In pursuance of these objects\r\nthe French Representatives, with whom Mr. Hay individually was on\r\nexcellent terms, were unceasing in their efforts to promote French\r\ninterests and gained over to their cause all the most powerful men\r\nconnected with the Moorish Court,—not a difficult matter with a\r\ncorrupt and venal Government.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan dared not depend on the countenance of any nation but\r\nthe French—fearing that the latter power, if he sought other\r\nprotection, might, on the pretext of sending a force in pursuit of\r\nAbd-el-Kader or rebel Algerian tribes, invade Maroquin territory. But\r\nthe natives generally were strongly in favour of Great Britain and\r\nhostile to France.\r\n\r\nLegitimate commerce, then principally in British hands, was ever on\r\nthe decrease, while contraband traffic was largely increasing.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay urged that, to counterbalance French military influence,\r\na more authoritative tone must be adopted by Great Britain in her\r\ndealings with the Sultan, and that certain commercial concessions\r\nand reforms should be demanded. He also advised that more frequent\r\nvisits should be paid by British men-of-war to Moorish ports, from\r\nwhich some vessel of the French navy was seldom absent, while British\r\nships were rarely seen. A year later he pointed out that his rank,\r\nas Consul-General and Agent only, militated against his efforts\r\nto increase British influence, since both the French and Spanish\r\nGovernments had Ministers accredited to the Moorish Court, and the\r\nMoors, who neither had newspapers of their own nor read those of\r\nother countries, who had no postal system, and no native society in\r\nwhich Europeans could mingle, estimated the comparative importance\r\nof different nations by the status of their respective employés.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay’s efforts were not unrecognised by the Foreign\r\nOffice. Encouraging letters reached him from the Chief Clerk\r\nsignifying Lord Palmerston’s satisfaction, and at the close of\r\n1847 he was promoted to the rank of Chargé d’Affaires.\r\n\r\nIt was also owing to Mr. Hay’s persistent representations that\r\nduties on imported goods were, in September, 1848, reduced ten\r\nper cent. The reduction gave fresh impetus to British trade and\r\nprevented its diversion into Franco-Algerian channels which seemed\r\nat one time imminent.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the feelings of the people of Morocco were growing\r\nstill more in favour of Great Britain and antagonistic to the policy\r\nof the Sultan. This potentate evinced great ill-will to Mr. Hay,\r\nand even threatened at various times to insist on his recall, should\r\nhe persist, as hitherto, in enforcing the claims of British subjects.\r\n\r\nThis ill-will on the part of the Sultan arose, no doubt, in great\r\nmeasure from his having been erroneously led to believe by evil\r\nadvisers in 1844 that Great Britain would employ armed force on\r\nbehalf of the Moors, and from his conviction that she had broken\r\nfaith in failing to do so.\r\n\r\nA better feeling towards Great Britain was brought about, however,\r\nby an act of kindly courtesy on the part of Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment. In July, 1849, a British vessel of war was sent to conduct\r\nH.S.M.’s two sons to Alexandria, whence they were to journey to\r\nMecca, the same vessel afterwards bringing them back. This act of\r\nkindness was received with great gratitude by the Sultan, and in\r\nacknowledgement he shortly after sent to the Queen a present of wild\r\nanimals, horses and specimens of Moorish manufactures. Several Moors\r\naccompanied the Sultan’s gift to the Queen and, on their return,\r\nin May, 1850, Mr. Hay wrote to Mr. Addington, then Chief Clerk at the\r\nForeign Office, telling him of their delight at their reception:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moors have returned, delighted with their visit to the land\r\nof the Nazarenes. Around my house, groups of respectable men\r\nmay be seen listening to the wondrous tales of Kaid Abd-el-Kerim\r\nor of my groom. The old chief hunter, Hadj Abdallah, sits in his\r\nvillage—amidst a motley crowd of Arabs and Rifians—telling them\r\nof the magnificence and wonders of London, and the kindness the poor\r\nMoors received, from the Queen down to the servants that assisted\r\nthem. He proclaims loudly to the astonished fanatics that power,\r\nwealth, honesty, and charity are to be found in the land of the\r\nInfidel and not in the land of the Moslem.\r\n\r\nThe Hadj tells me that at one time he had almost lost his reason in\r\nthinking over what he had seen. His stories have amused me as much\r\nas they do the Moors, and I have been almost inclined to publish\r\nthe ‘Travels of the Hadj,’ or get my brother to do so, as I am\r\nrather lazy about writing when it is not a duty.\r\n\r\nAll the Moors talk much of the Queen and Prince Albert, who they\r\ndeclare sent for them more than once. So England and the English\r\nare in the mouth of every Moor since the return of the travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn direct contrast to this exchange of courtesies, the French had\r\ncontinued their dictatorial policy and the feeling in Morocco ran\r\nhigh against France.\r\n\r\nThus, in April, 1849, the French Chargé d’Affaires struck his\r\nflag in consequence of an altercation with the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nregarding a courier in French employ who had been imprisoned by that\r\nofficial. This courier was found carrying letters of a purely private\r\ncharacter from Abd-el-Kader to his former lieutenant, then a State\r\nprisoner at Fas. The Moorish Government refused to release the courier\r\nwho eventually died in prison. After much negotiation and pacific\r\ncounsel on the part of the Neapolitan Consul, who was in charge of\r\nFrench interests, and of Mr. Hay—who, as he wrote to a relative,\r\ncould not have worked harder to bring about a peaceful issue,\r\nhad he been himself a Frenchman—the Moors gave way and offered\r\nevery reparation. But French pride was roused. Fresh complications\r\nensued, and finally all the French subjects at Tangier and the\r\nPorts embarked on board vessels of war. In the meantime the Sultan\r\nhad begun to collect troops on the Algerian frontier and war seemed\r\nimminent. Mr. Hay hurried off to El Araish by sea and interviewed the\r\nMoorish Minister for Foreign Affairs who, by an anomalous—though\r\nessentially Moorish—arrangement, resided there. He succeeded in\r\npersuading him to check all warlike preparations; but it was not\r\ntill the close of September that matters were brought to a peaceful\r\ntermination and the French flag hoisted and saluted.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing events Mr. Hay relates the following\r\nstory, which he had from an authentic source.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen relations between France and Morocco were in a critical\r\ncondition and a declaration of war seemed imminent, the Sultan sent\r\nfor Abd-el-Hadi, the Kadi of his Capital, said to be the wisest man\r\nin Morocco, and asked him what he was to reply to the demands of\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\n‘Refuse the infidel,’ said Abd-el-Hadi. ‘Order the destruction\r\nof all your ports; blow up the fortifications; let every man arm\r\nand become, as were his ancestors, a wandering Arab, and then tell\r\nthe French to do their worst!’\r\n\r\nWhen Abd-el-Hadi had retired, the Sultan turned to his Uzir and said,\r\n‘The Kadi ought to have added—Abdicate, encourage anarchy and\r\nrevolution, and destroy at once the Empire.’\r\n\r\nIt may be surmised, however, that Abd-el-Hadi was a wiser man than he\r\nappears. Desirous of humouring his lord and master by recommending\r\nwar, he yet put his advice in a light which would show the Sultan\r\nthe folly of resisting the French.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only was the residence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at El\r\nAraish most inconvenient at all times to the Representatives—all\r\nof whom lived at Tangier—but it necessitated, as has been seen,\r\nfrequent hurried journeys on their part to that port.\r\n\r\nOn one such occasion, Mr. Hay had proceeded to El Araish by land\r\nto interview Sid Buselham, and had succeeded in getting from him a\r\nreply, which he desired to forward at once to head-quarters by one of\r\nthe rare steamers to England due to leave Tangier next morning. In\r\nexpectation of this he had, on his way to El Araish, arranged that\r\nfour relays of horses were to await his return at different points\r\nof the road between that town and Tangier, a distance of sixty\r\nmiles—and, as soon as he had obtained the Minister’s signature,\r\nhe mounted and dashed off homewards.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of El Araish, anxious for the British Agent’s safety\r\nin those troubled times, had given orders that a mounted escort\r\nshould also await him with every fresh horse and follow him on the\r\nroad. These, however, were unable to keep pace with him. On arrival\r\nat the little town of Azaila, situated about halfway between Tangier\r\nand El Araish, he found no horse prepared for him. Riding at once to\r\nthe British Consular Agent’s house, Mr. Hay demanded his horse. The\r\nAgent, a Jew, explained that it was locked up in the stable of the\r\nBasha, who was away, and that the groom was not to be found. ‘Take\r\nme to the stable,’ said Mr. Hay, and, calling to four men of the\r\nlittle crowd of idlers that had gathered, he ordered them to lift\r\na large log of wood which lay near and direct it as a ram against\r\nthe door. ‘Now, all together,’ said Mr. Hay. Down came the door\r\nwith a crash, and quickly putting his saddle on the fresh horse,\r\nand throwing money to the Agent to repay the damage to the door,\r\nhe mounted and rode on.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the river Mishra-el-Hashef, some miles to the west of\r\nTangier, he found his own sturdy pony awaiting him, and riding this,\r\nhis favourite mount, he galloped to the river bank where the ferry,\r\nrowed by two men, awaited him. Shouting to them to stand clear,\r\nhe jumped his pony into the boat, and out again on reaching the\r\nfurther side. He arrived at Tangier having ridden the whole distance\r\nin five hours.\r\n\r\nThe escorts appointed to accompany him returned to their quarters,\r\nhaving failed to keep Mr. Hay in sight. ‘It was useless,’ said\r\nthey. ‘We galloped along behind him but he ran away from us, and\r\nas soon as he had gone a little way ahead he spread large wings and\r\nflew away with his horse!’\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Hay wore a loose Inverness cape, to protect him from sun and\r\nweather, the fluttering of this may have suggested the idea of wings.\r\n\r\nAn account of a curious and unpleasant adventure which befell\r\nMr. Hay, and which points to the unsettled and fanatical state of\r\nthe inhabitants of Tangier at that time is given in the following\r\nletter to his wife’s sister, Mme. Marcussen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _July 29_, 1849.\r\n\r\nI have also had an affair—and as it may probably be stuffed into\r\nsome newspaper which might report my death, as was done once before,\r\nI will tell you about it in a few words.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I was accompanying A., perched on her donkey, and\r\nthe two children to Madame F.’s. On passing through the little\r\nmarket-place I had remained rather behind to take care of R., who was\r\nholding my hand, when I was assailed with abuse without the slightest\r\ncause by a wild-looking Hadj from the interior—and, on my calling\r\non the bystanders to arrest him, the fanatic made at me and struck\r\nme a blow in the face and on the shoulder, hitting also by chance\r\npoor little R. I had nothing in my hand but my little gold-headed\r\ncane. Of this, however, I made good use; for I immediately struck the\r\nbare head of the Moslem who instantly fell to the ground, stunned,\r\nwith a gash of several inches from which issued torrents of blood,\r\nwhilst the wretch looked livid and appeared to be quivering in the\r\nconvulsions of death. Several of the Hadj’s brethren were near me,\r\nbut they all seemed so alarmed at the fate of the wounded man that\r\nthey did not venture within reach of my little stick. You may imagine\r\nmy astonishment at the effect of such a blow from so small a weapon,\r\nand you may imagine also, though I was justified in defending myself,\r\nmy horror at the appearance of the wounded man.\r\n\r\nThe man was sent to prison and his head examined. The skull was not\r\nhurt, but there was a large gash of the skin and plenty of blood\r\nfrom a severed vein. This was soon put to rights, and as the wretch\r\nhad received a good lesson for attacking a Christian, and all his\r\nbrethren came to me to intercede for him, as he was about to embark on\r\nboard a vessel for Alexandria, I let him out of prison and prevented\r\nBasha giving him the bastinado as he had intended. ‘Voilà tout.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be added in connection with the incident here recounted\r\nby Mr. Hay that, surrounded though he was by a crowd of angry\r\nfanatics—very different in those remote days from the generality\r\nof the native population as known to the tourist in these later and\r\nmore civilised times—he stood his ground, alone and undaunted, and\r\nthe moment after he had felled his assailant, his only remark was,\r\nwhile pointing to the fallen man with his stick, ‘Erfed e’jifa’\r\n(Take away the corpse).\r\n\r\nNo fear of consequences held back the wild pilgrims who hated\r\nthe Christian with the blind, unreasoning hatred of ignorance and\r\nfanaticism; his individuality alone kept them in check, where another\r\nman might have been torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe Basha, after seeing the wounded man, sent to inquire what manner\r\nof sword Mr. Hay had employed which produced such a peculiar and\r\ndangerous wound—and was much astonished when shown a light but\r\nstrong cane with a silver gilt head, formerly the property of Sir\r\nWalter Scott, by whom it had been given to Mr. Hay’s father.\r\n\r\nThe attitude Mr. Hay had adopted in dealing with the barbarous\r\nMoorish Government, his firm, upright, and frank policy, began to\r\nbear fruit, and in 1850 he writes to his cousin, Mr. R. W. Hay,\r\nthen Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI am glad to find that the straightforward course I have always\r\npursued with this Government—though often not very flattering to\r\ntheir vanity and fanaticism—begins to be understood and appreciated,\r\nrather than the cajolery they are accustomed to meet with from others.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to Sir Stratford Canning in February, 1851,\r\nhe says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this country there is nought of interest passing. Our Sultan is\r\na fanatic, and is guided by a set of ignorant and venal ministers,\r\nwho are doing all they can to ruin the commerce of the country by a\r\nsystem of monopolies. It is no use talking or writing to those who,\r\nit appears, won’t or can’t understand.\r\n\r\nTheir disputes with the French, about frontier, &c., have ceased for\r\nthe moment, but there are difficulties we must expect to the end of\r\nthe chapter—or rather, until Algiers becomes Morocco or Morocco\r\npart of Algiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulties he anticipated were not long in abeyance. In the\r\nfollowing December, in a letter to Mme. Marcussen, he tells her:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French bombarded Salli on the 25th ult., without giving any\r\nnotice to us here or to the Sultan or his Government. Not much\r\nharm is done to the town: some thirteen persons killed in all,\r\nand the French have five killed and thirty wounded. One of their\r\nsteam frigates was compelled to retire from the combat. After the\r\nbombardment they came here, and all the petty affairs they had to\r\nsettle were settled at once—as they would have been before the\r\nbombardment if they would only have been inclined to arrange matters\r\namicably. They saluted the town and peace was concluded. A reference\r\nwas then made to the Sultan. His Majesty accepts the peace, but asks\r\nfor explanations about bombardment; so B.[22] has taken umbrage and\r\nembarks with all the French subjects, or most of them, leaving the\r\nFrench flag flying and the Sardinian Consul-General in charge. It\r\nhas been mere bullying; the strong trampling on the weak.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these difficulties Mr. Hay continued to press upon\r\nthe Moorish Government the necessity of a more liberal policy in\r\nmatters of trade; but French schemes of political aggrandisement\r\nand the natural apathy of the Sultan, combined with fear of France,\r\nfor the time rendered his best endeavours fruitless. In 1853 Mr. Hay\r\nseemed as far from his object as ever. Writing in that year to\r\nMme. Marcussen, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been very busy, and have been compelled to suspend all\r\nrelations with the Moorish Court—though I do not strike my flag. I\r\nhave given them ten days in which to give way, and have no doubt\r\nthey will. My demands have reference to our rights in trade in this\r\ncountry, which we are anxious to place on a better footing, not only\r\nfor Great Britain but for Morocco itself and all countries.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish Government have announced that they send an Envoy to\r\nEngland; and his object, it is reported, is to complain of the\r\ninsistance and _audacity_ which I have shown in this negotiation. I\r\nam delighted at this manœuvre because it will only tend finally to\r\nshow these people I am acting up to my instructions and the views\r\nof Government. So much for Moorish politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch representations on the part of the Moorish Government to the\r\nBritish Foreign Office were not likely to bear much weight, as may\r\nbe gathered from the following farewell letter addressed to Mr. Hay\r\nby Mr. Addington, then retiring from his post as Chief Clerk at the\r\nForeign Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _May 18_, 1854.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have been much gratified by the receipt of your letter, written\r\non hearing of my retirement from the Foreign Office. . . .\r\n\r\nNo act of mine, while I was in office, is remembered by me with\r\nmore satisfaction and confidence than the part I had in forwarding\r\nyour appointment to the post which you now enjoy so creditably to\r\nyourself and so beneficially to the public.\r\n\r\nSome thought so _young_ an appointment hazardous. I felt satisfied\r\nit would succeed, and I therefore pushed it on so far as it depended\r\non me. And it _has_ succeeded, and will yet succeed.\r\n\r\nGo on, without swerving, in the same track; vigorous but temperate;\r\nstraightforward; never condescending to indulge in paltry and\r\nun-English intrigue or tortuosity; but not despising the ‘reculer\r\npour mieux sauter’ principle whenever you find turning the bull’s\r\nflank more likely to succeed than taking him by the horns; and always\r\nremembering that, ‘suaviter in modo, fortiter in re,’ is the\r\nreal adage for subduing the world and any individual in it.\r\n\r\nI wish you every success, and am ever yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                     H. CH. ADDINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                           LIFE AT TANGIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hay had married, in 1845, a daughter of Mr. Carstensen, a former\r\nDanish Consul-General to Morocco. Except when the exigencies of a\r\nclimate which proved very trying in summer for children of northern\r\nrace compelled him to send them home, he, with his wife and young\r\nfamily, resided either at the old Government House in Tangier or in\r\na villa called by him ‘The Wilderness,’ outside the walls, which\r\nhad belonged to his father-in-law. This existence was only varied\r\nby missions to the Court or occasional visits to England. Beyond\r\nthe very small European society, composed chiefly of the various\r\nRepresentatives and their families, residence in Tangier offered no\r\noccupation for the leisure hours of a young and active man. Thrown\r\ntherefore on the resources of sport, he mingled constantly with the\r\nwilder natives of the hills as well as with the less uncivilised\r\nfarmers and agricultural peasantry of the plains. His interest in\r\nthese folk grew, and he gained their respect and even affection.\r\n\r\nJustice amongst these people, when regarded from a purely personal\r\npoint of view, as Mr. Hay found, often took rather a romantic than\r\na strictly logical form. But his hope was to gain the hearts of the\r\nnatives, and he knew that such an aim was best attained by bending\r\nin some cases to such national prejudices and customs as those which\r\nare illustrated in the following letter to his mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ‘The Wilderness,’ Tangier, _June 22_, 1852.\r\n\r\nThe other night A. and I were woke by my servant Azdot informing me\r\nhe had just seized a robber who had come into the garden to steal\r\nour horses, but that the fellow, though stabbed in the breast\r\nby the son of Hadj Abdallah, whom he had attacked with a sword,\r\nhad managed to slip out of his jelab (outer cloak) and get away,\r\nleaving as trophies the jelab and a sword they had wrested from him.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after I had dismissed Azdot, I heard a couple\r\nof shots close by the house. My people had found the companion of\r\nthe robber, who attacked them and then attempted to make off and\r\nwas fired upon, but managed to get away—though tracks of blood\r\nwere found in the gap of the hedge through which he had escaped.\r\n\r\nThis morning I sent off a body of my hunters into the country, about\r\ntwelve miles from here, to where I suspected the robbers lived:\r\nthe men were identified and brought before me. They confessed their\r\ncrime, but declared that they had only come to rob the fruit.\r\n\r\nWhilst telling the man the punishment I was about to inflict on him,\r\nhe escaped; so we raised a hue and cry, and judge and attendants\r\nall made after him. His object, however, was only to get hold of my\r\nhorse, whose protection he claimed, according to Moorish custom. He\r\nwas again brought before me and I was compelled to let him off the\r\nbastinado[23], condemning him to prison only. R. was standing near\r\nme at the time and, to his surprise, the robber sprang towards him,\r\nand seizing him by the hand said to me, ‘I call on you in God’s\r\nname and for the love of this boy, under the hem of whose garment\r\nI seek refuge, to have pity on me.’\r\n\r\nAfter this appeal there was no use in talking of punishing the man,\r\nand the upshot of all was that I caused the rascal to pay a doubloon\r\nto my men and two of the Kaid’s soldiers for arresting him. The\r\nman and his brother are the Robin Hoods of this neighbourhood, and,\r\ngrateful for my pardon, declare that they are ready to defend me\r\nand mine whenever I call on them: or if any of my cows, camels,\r\nor horses are robbed to cause them to be restored.\r\n\r\nOur Governor has given an order to my people to kill any man coming\r\ninto my garden at night. This order is published: so we are safer\r\nfrom thieves than you are in England. I have generally some dozen\r\nfine fellows, armed to the teeth, who guard my garden all night,\r\nand who seek for no other compensation than to be my friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promise made by the robber was faithfully kept, and Mr. Hay reaped\r\nthe reward of his leniency in after years, as, by this clan at least,\r\nhis property was always respected.\r\n\r\nAn indefatigable sportsman, Mr. Hay delighted in expeditions into\r\nremote districts of the country in pursuit of game. It was thus in\r\npart that he acquired his intimate knowledge of the character of\r\nthe people. Brought into personal contact with the wild tribesmen,\r\nin circumstances which strongly appealed to their natural chivalry,\r\nhe gained an influence among them which he was often able to turn\r\nto useful account. A good illustration of his power of dealing with\r\nthe native races is afforded by his suppression of piracy among the\r\nRifians. The story is told in his own words.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1856, vessels becalmed on the Rif coast between the\r\nAlgerian frontier and the Spanish fortress Peñon, which is situated\r\nabout sixty miles to the eastward of the Moorish port of Tetuan,\r\nwere frequently captured by Rifian ‘karebs,’ large galleys manned\r\nby thirty or forty men, armed with long guns, pistols, and daggers.\r\n\r\nWhen a vessel becalmed, drawn by the current, approached the Rif\r\ncoast, especially in the vicinity of the village of Benibugaffer, near\r\nCape ‘Tres Forcas,’ about fifteen miles to the westward of the\r\nSpanish fortress of Melilla, the natives launched their ‘karebs,’\r\nhidden in nooks on the rocky coast, or buried under sand, and set\r\nout in pursuit, firing volleys as they neared the vessel. The crew,\r\nif they had not escaped in the ship’s boats when the piratical\r\ncraft hove in sight, were made prisoners, but were not in general\r\nill-treated unless they attempted to offer resistance.\r\n\r\nOn landing, they were compelled to labour in the fields, receiving a\r\ndaily allowance of very coarse food. The captured vessel was rifled\r\nof cargo and rigging, and then burnt, so as to leave no vestige.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851 a British vessel was taken by the ‘karebs’\r\nof Benibugaffer.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of instructions from H.M.’s Government, a strong\r\nrepresentation was made by me to the Sultan of Morocco, then Mulai\r\nAbderahman, demanding that the pirates should be chastised, that\r\ncompensation should be given to the owner of the vessel, and that\r\nenergetic steps should be taken by His Sherifian Majesty to put a\r\nstop to these piratical acts of his lawless subjects of the Rif.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan, on the receipt of this demand, dispatched officers\r\nfrom his Court to the Rif country with a Sherifian edict to the\r\nchieftains, directing that the sums demanded for the destruction\r\nof British property should be paid, and threatening, if further\r\npiracies were committed, to send a force into the Rif to chastise\r\nhis rebellious subjects.\r\n\r\nNo attention was paid to this edict, for though the Rifians\r\nacknowledge the Sultan of Morocco as ‘Kaliph[24] Allah,’\r\nH.M. being a direct descendant from the Prophet, and though they allow\r\na governor of Rif extraction to be appointed by him to reside amongst\r\nthem, they do not admit of his interference in the administration\r\nof government or in any kind of legislation, unless it happens he\r\nis voluntarily appealed to in cases of dispute.\r\n\r\nThe Rifians, however, pay annually a small tribute, which is generally\r\ncomposed of mules and honey, the latter article being much cultivated\r\non the extensive tracts of heather in the Rif mountains. This tribute\r\nis collected by the Governor and transmitted to the Sultan.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthened correspondence with the Moorish Court, negotiations\r\nwere closed by the Sultan declaring he had no power of control\r\nover the mountainous districts in the Rif, and therefore declining\r\nto be held responsible for the depredations committed on vessels\r\napproaching that coast. The British Government then dispatched a\r\nsquadron to Gibraltar under Admiral Sir Charles Napier, with orders\r\nto embark a regiment at that garrison, and to proceed to the Rif\r\ncoast to chastise the lawless inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at the Spanish fort of Melilla, which is about fifty\r\nmiles to the westward of the Algerian frontier, Sir Charles called\r\non the Spanish Governor and requested him to invite the chiefs of\r\nthe neighbouring villages to come to Melilla to meet him.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival, the Admiral demanded compensation for the losses\r\nsustained by the owner of the British vessels which had been\r\ncaptured. The Rifians cunningly evaded discussion by replying that\r\nthey could not accede to demands which did not emanate from the\r\nSultan, whose orders they declared they would be prepared to obey.\r\n\r\nSir Charles accepted these vague assurances[25]; and with this\r\nunsatisfactory result returned with the squadron to Gibraltar, and\r\naddressed to me a communication, making known the language held to\r\nhim by the Rifians, and requesting that I would dispatch an express\r\ncourier to the Moorish Court to call upon the Sultan to give the\r\nrequisite orders to the Rifians who, he declared, were prepared\r\nto obey, though he admitted he was ignorant of the names of the\r\nchieftains with whom he had the parley.\r\n\r\nIn my reply to the Admiral I expressed my belief that the Rifians\r\nhad cunningly given these vague assurances to induce him to depart\r\nwith his ships from their coast, and that I apprehended the Sultan\r\nwould express his surprise that we should have been led to suppose\r\nthat the piratical and rebellious inhabitants of the Rif coast would\r\npay compensation or give other satisfaction, in pursuance of any\r\norders which H.S.M. might issue.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, as I had expected, the Sultan replied to my note;\r\nholding out, however, a hope, which had been expressed in past years,\r\nthat he would seek at a more favourable moment to make the Rif\r\npopulation, who had been from time immemorial in a semi-independent\r\nstate, more subservient to his control.\r\n\r\nSome months after the squadron had returned to England, a British\r\nvessel, becalmed off the village of Benibugaffer, was taken by a\r\nRifian piratical craft, and the English crew were made captives.\r\n\r\nTidings having reached Gibraltar of the capture of the British ship,\r\na gunboat was sent to Melilla to endeavour to obtain, through the\r\nintervention of the Spanish authorities and an offer of a ransom,\r\nthe release of the British sailors, but this step was not attended\r\nwith success. Having heard that the Englishmen who had been captured\r\nhad been presented by the pirates to a Rif Marábet (or holy man)\r\nnamed Alhádari, who resided on the coast, and as I had in past\r\nyears been in friendly communication with this person regarding\r\nsome Rifians who had proceeded in a British vessel to the East on\r\na pilgrimage to Mecca, and had been provided by me with letters of\r\nrecommendation to British Consular officers, I wrote him a friendly\r\nletter, expressing the indignation I felt at the outrages which had\r\nbeen committed by his piratical brethren on British vessels; that\r\nI had been informed the authorities at Gibraltar had endeavoured,\r\nwhen they heard British sailors were in the hands of the pirates, to\r\npay a ransom for their freedom, but had failed, as exorbitant demands\r\nhad been put forward; and that since I had learnt my countrymen were\r\nin his hands, I felt satisfied they would be well treated, and that\r\nhe would facilitate at once their release and return to Gibraltar;\r\nthat I entertained too high an opinion of him to suppose he would\r\nnot consent to their release except on the payment of a ransom,\r\nand therefore I would make no offer to purchase the liberty of my\r\ncountrymen, but renewed those assurances of friendship and goodwill,\r\nof which I said I had already given proof in the past treatment of\r\nhis brethren.\r\n\r\nAlhádari replied that the sailors were under his care, had been\r\nwell treated, and would be embarked in the first vessel which might\r\nbe sent to receive them.\r\n\r\nThis engagement was faithfully executed, and at my suggestion the\r\nauthorities at Gibraltar sent a suitable present to the worthy\r\nMarábet. I wrote also to thank Alhádari, and to beg that he would\r\nuse his influence to put a stop to the disgraceful outrages committed\r\nin past years by his brethren on the lives and property of British\r\nsubjects, and to say that I should probably take an opportunity of\r\nseeking to have a parley with the chiefs, in the hope of coming to an\r\nunderstanding with them to bring about a cessation of these outrages;\r\nadding, that if my friendly intervention did not put a stop to the\r\npiracy of his brethren, the British Government would be compelled,\r\nin concert with the Sultan, to resort to hostile measures on a large\r\nscale, and send forces by sea and land to chastise these rebellious\r\nsubjects of His Sherifian Majesty.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1856 H.M. frigate Miranda, Captain Hall, arrived\r\nat Tangier with directions to convey me to the coast of Rif, and I\r\nembarked on April 21, taking with me a Rifian friend, Hadj Abdallah\r\nLamarti, who was Sheikh of a village near Tangier called Suanni,\r\nwhose inhabitants are Rifians, or of Rif extraction.\r\n\r\nHadj Abdallah had left the Rif in consequence of a blood feud. He\r\nwas the chief of the boar-hunters at Tangier, and was looked up to\r\nwith respect, not only by the rural population in the neighbourhood\r\nof that town, who are chiefly of Rif extraction, but also by the\r\nlocal authorities, who frequently employed him in the settlement of\r\ndisputes with the refractory tribes in the mountainous districts of\r\nthe Tangier province.\r\n\r\nWe steamed along the rocky coast of Rif and touched at the Spanish\r\ngarrisons of Peñon and Alhucema. The former is a curious little rock,\r\nseparated from the mainland by a very narrow channel. A colonel and\r\na few soldiers garrisoned the fortress, which is apparently of no\r\npossible use, though the authorities at that time might have aided\r\nin checking piracy by stopping the passage of the Rif galleys. The\r\nrock is so small that there was not a walk fifty yards long on any\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Alhucema, so called from the wild lavender that\r\ngrows there, we also landed. The Spanish authorities were civil, but\r\nheld out no hopes of being able to take steps to put a stop to piracy.\r\n\r\nThis island is also an insignificant possession, about half a\r\nmile distant from the mainland. The inhabitants had occasional\r\ncommunication with the Rifians, hoisting a flag of truce whenever a\r\nboat was dispatched to the shore; but Spaniards were not at that time\r\nallowed to make excursions on the mainland, nor were they permitted\r\nto obtain provisions except a few fowls, eggs, and honey.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Melilla, the Governor, Colonel Buceta[26], received\r\nus courteously. I made known to him that the British Government had\r\ndirected me to proceed to the coast of Rif, to endeavour to come to\r\nan understanding with the chiefs with the view of putting a stop\r\nto piracy on that coast, the Sultan of Morocco having declared he\r\nhad no power of control over his lawless subjects, who had shown\r\nan utter disregard of the peremptory orders which had been issued\r\nto restore British property captured by their piratical galleys;\r\nthat in order to carry out this object I was anxious to have an\r\ninterview with some of the chiefs, not only of the villages on the\r\ncoast where the owners of the piratical galleys dwelt, but more\r\nespecially with the chiefs of the neighbouring inland villages, as\r\nthe latter derived no immediate benefit from the plunder of shipping.\r\n\r\nColonel Buceta endeavoured to dissuade me from this purpose, reminding\r\nme that Sir Charles Napier had failed in obtaining any beneficial\r\nresult from his parley with the Rifians who had an interview with\r\nhim in Melilla.\r\n\r\nPerceiving from the Governor’s language that he entertained those\r\nfeelings of jealousy which prevail with Spaniards regarding the\r\nintervention of any foreign Government in the affairs of Morocco,\r\nI let him understand that, should no beneficial result be obtained\r\nby my visit in putting a stop to the outrages committed on merchant\r\nvessels approaching the Rif coast, it would become a serious matter\r\nfor the consideration of our Government whether steps should not be\r\ntaken to inflict a chastisement on the Rifians by landing a force, and\r\nin conjunction with the Sultan’s troops which might be dispatched,\r\nat our instigation, for that purpose, to destroy the hamlets and boats\r\non the coast. The question might also arise, perhaps, of erecting a\r\nfortress in some sheltered spot where a gunboat could be placed to\r\nguard the coast against pirates, which I observed the authorities\r\nat Spanish fortresses had hitherto been unable to effect.\r\n\r\nThis language sufficed to decide Colonel Buceta to accede to my\r\nwishes; but he informed me that, in consequence of late acts of\r\naggression on the part of the natives, all communication with the\r\ngarrison had been cut off, and that no Rifians were allowed to\r\nenter; it was therefore out of the question that he could admit any\r\nchieftains into Spanish territory. Neither did he think the latter\r\nwould be disposed to venture into the gates of the fortress.\r\n\r\nI then proposed to be allowed to dispatch my Rifian friend Hadj\r\nAbdallah Lamarti with an invitation to some of the neighbouring\r\nchiefs, both on the seaboard and inland, to meet me on the neutral\r\nground.\r\n\r\nColonel Buceta assented, but he repeated that he could not admit\r\nany Rifians into the garrison, nor send an escort to accompany me,\r\nshould I pass the gates to go into the Rif country, adding that he\r\nthought I should be incurring a serious risk of being carried off a\r\nprisoner by the Rifians, if in the parley I should happen to express\r\nmyself in language such as I had used to him regarding the outrages\r\ncommitted by these lawless people.\r\n\r\nHis predecessor, he informed me, in consequence of the frequent\r\nhostilities which had taken place between the natives and the\r\ngarrison, had proposed to have a meeting with some chieftains within\r\nthe garrison. This they declined, fearing, as they alleged, some\r\nact of treachery; but it was finally agreed that they should meet\r\nthe Governor on the neutral ground; that he could bring an escort of\r\ntwenty-five armed men, and that the chiefs would also be accompanied\r\nby an equal number of followers; that the Governor and one chief,\r\nboth unarmed, were to advance to a central spot that was selected\r\nabout 150 yards distant from where their followers assembled, and\r\nthat the Spanish Governor could also bring with him an interpreter.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was carried out, and a Rifian chief, a man of\r\ngigantic stature and herculean frame, advanced to meet the Spanish\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nThe parley commenced in a friendly manner; propositions were made\r\nby each party regarding the conditions upon which peaceful relations\r\nwere to be re-established; but without bringing about any result.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Governor, finding the demands put forward by the\r\nchieftain to be of an unacceptable character, expressed himself\r\nstrongly on the subject. A warm dispute ensued, and on the Governor\r\nusing some offensive expression, the Rifian seized in his brawny\r\narms the Governor, who was a little man, and chucking him over his\r\nshoulders like a sack of grain, called out to the Spanish detachment\r\nof soldiers to blaze away, and at the same time to his own men to\r\nfire if the Spanish soldiers fired or attempted to advance, whilst\r\nthe chieftain ran off with the Governor, who was like a shield on\r\nhis back, to his followers.\r\n\r\nThe officer in command of the Spanish detachment, fearing that the\r\nGovernor might be killed, did not venture to let his men fire or\r\nadvance, and the Governor was carried off prisoner to a village about\r\nthree miles off on the hills, and notice was then sent to the fortress\r\nthat he would not be released until a ransom of 3000 dollars was sent.\r\n\r\nThe Rifians kept the Governor prisoner until a reference was made to\r\nMadrid, and orders were sent for the ransom to be paid. ‘Now,’\r\nsaid Colonel Buceta, ‘your fate if you trust yourself to these\r\ntreacherous people will probably be the same, and I shall be quite\r\nunable to obtain your release.’\r\n\r\nI thanked the Governor for the advice, but declared that I must\r\nfulfil my mission and was prepared to run all risks, having been\r\naccustomed for many years to deal with Rifians at Tangier.\r\n\r\nBuceta then consented that I should be allowed to pass the gates of\r\nthe garrison and invite the chiefs of the neighbouring Rif villages\r\nto a parley on the neutral ground.\r\n\r\nColonel Buceta, a distinguished officer well known for his great\r\ncourage and decision, was I believe, on the whole, pleased that I\r\nheld to my purpose, though he warned me again and again that I was\r\nincurring a great risk, and that in no manner could he intervene, if\r\nI and the English officer who might accompany me were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nMy messenger returned and informed me that the neighbouring chiefs,\r\nboth of the inland and of the piratical villages of Benibugaffer,\r\nwould meet me on the neutral ground as had been proposed to them.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Capt. Hall, who commanded H.M.’s frigate Miranda,\r\nmy friend Hadj Abdallah, and a ‘kavass,’ we proceeded to the\r\nrendezvous.\r\n\r\nFive or six chiefs awaited our advent, attended by some hundred\r\nfollowers, stalwart fellows, many of them more than six feet high.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs wore brown hooded dresses, not unlike the costume of\r\na Franciscan friar; but part of the shirt-sleeves and front were\r\nembroidered with coloured silks. Handsome leather-belts girded their\r\nloins. A few of the elders wore white woollen ‘haiks,’ like unto\r\nthe Roman toga or mantle without seam, such as our Saviour is said\r\nto have worn.\r\n\r\nSome of the wild fellows had doffed their outer garments, carrying\r\nthem on their shoulders as they are wont to do when going to\r\nbattle. Their inner costume was a white cotton tunic, coming down\r\nto the knees, with long wide sleeves fastened behind the back by a\r\ncord. Around their loins each wore a leathern girdle embroidered in\r\ncoloured silk, from which on the one side hung a dagger and a small\r\npouch for bullets; while on the other was suspended a larger leathern\r\npouch or bag prettily embroidered and having a deep fringe of leather,\r\nin which powder is carried; containing also a pocket to carry the\r\npalmetto fibre, curiously enough called ‘lif,’ used instead\r\nof wads over powder and ball. Their heads were closely shaved,\r\nexcept that on the right side hung a long lock of braided hair,\r\ncarefully combed and oiled. Several of them were fair men with brown\r\nor red beards, descendants perhaps of those Goths who crossed over\r\ninto Africa.\r\n\r\nThe wild fellows reclined in groups on a bank, immediately behind\r\nwhere the chiefs were standing to receive us. After mutual greetings\r\nI addressed them in Arabic, which though not the common language,\r\nfor Berber is spoken in the Rif, yet is understood by the better\r\nclasses, who learn to read the Koran and to write in the ‘jama’\r\nor mosque school. The Berber is not a written language.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, men! I come amongst you as a friend; an old friend of the\r\nMussulmans. I have been warned that Rifians are not to be trusted,\r\nand that I and those who accompany me are in danger of treachery; but\r\nI take no heed of such warnings, for Rifians are renowned for bravery,\r\nand brave men never act in a dastardly manner. My best friends at\r\nTangier are Rifians, or those whose sires came from the Rif, such\r\nas my friend here, Hadj Abdallah Lamarti. They are my hunters, and\r\nI pass days and nights with them out hunting, and am treated by them\r\nand look upon them as my brethren; so here I have come to meet you,\r\nwith the Captain of the frigate, unarmed, as you see, and without\r\neven an escort of my countrymen from the ship-of-war lying there,\r\nor from the Spanish garrison, for I felt sure I should never require\r\nprotection in the Rif against any man.’\r\n\r\n‘You are welcome,’ exclaimed the chiefs. ‘The English have\r\nalways been our friends,’ and a murmur of approval ran through\r\nthe groups of armed men seated on the bank.\r\n\r\n‘Yes!’ I continued, ‘the English have always been the friends\r\nof the Sultan, the ‘Kaliph Allah,’ and of his people.\r\n\r\n‘You are all Mussulmans, and as followers of the Prophet every year\r\na number of your brethren, who have the means, go to the shrine of the\r\nProphet at Mecca, as required by your religion. How do they go? In\r\nEnglish vessels from Tangier, as you know, and they are therefore,\r\nwhen on board, under the English flag and protection. They are\r\nwell treated and their lives and property are safe. They return\r\nto Tangier in the same manner, and many of them have come to me to\r\nexpress their gratitude for the recommendations I have given them\r\nto English officers in the East, and the kindness they have received\r\nat their hands.\r\n\r\n‘These facts, I think, are known to you; but let us now consider\r\nwhat is the conduct of certain Rifians,—not all, I am happy to add,\r\nbut those who dwell on the coast and possess ‘karebs,’ for the\r\nalleged purpose of trade with Tangier and Tetuan, and for fishing.\r\n\r\n‘The inhabitants of these coast villages, especially of the\r\nneighbouring village of Benibugaffer, when they espy a peaceful\r\nmerchant vessel becalmed off their coast, launch a ‘kareb’ with\r\nforty or fifty armed men, and set out in pursuit. The crews of these\r\nmerchant vessels are unarmed, and generally consist of not more than\r\neight or nine men. When they observe a ‘kareb’ approaching with\r\na hostile appearance, they escape in their little boats to the open\r\nsea, trusting to Providence to be picked up by some passing vessel\r\nbefore bad weather sets in, which might cause their small craft to\r\nfounder. The merchant vessel is then towed to the beach, where she\r\nis stranded, pillaged of cargo and rigging, and burnt.\r\n\r\n‘I now appeal to all true Mussulmans whether such iniquitous\r\nacts are not against the laws of God and of the Prophet. These\r\npirates are not waging war against enemies or infidels, they are\r\nmere sea robbers, who set aside the laws of the Prophet to pillage\r\nthe peaceful ships of their friends the English, to whom they are\r\nindebted for conveying their brethren in safety to worship at the\r\nHoly ‘Kaaba’ of their Prophet.\r\n\r\n‘To these English whom they rob, and also murder if they attempt\r\nto resist, they are indebted for much of the clothing they wear,\r\nfor the iron and steel of which their arms are made, and for other\r\ncommodities. I now appeal to those Rifians who dwell in inland\r\nvillages, and who take no part in and have no profit from these\r\nlawless acts, and I ask whether they will continue to tolerate such\r\ninfractions of Allah’s laws? Can these men of Benibugaffer who have\r\nbeen guilty of frequent acts of piracy, can they be Mussulmans? No,\r\nthey must be “kaffers” (rebels against God).’ As I said this,\r\nI heard from the mound behind me, where the Benibugaffer people were\r\nseated, the sound of the cocking of guns, and a murmur, ‘He calls\r\nus kaffers.’ Looking round, I perceived guns levelled at my back.\r\n\r\nOne of the elder Chiefs rose and cried out, ‘Let the English Chief\r\nspeak! What he says is true! Those who rob and murder on the seas\r\ninnocent people are not Mussulmans, for they do not obey the law\r\nof God.’\r\n\r\nI continued: ‘Hear what your wise Chief says. I fancied I heard a\r\nsound like the click of a gun being cocked. Some foolish boys must\r\nbe sitting amongst the assembly, for no brave Rifians, Benibugaffers\r\nincluded, would ever commit a cowardly murder on an unarmed man who\r\nhas come amongst you trusting to the honour and friendship between\r\nthe Rifians and English from ancient times.\r\n\r\n‘You have, I think, heard that the English Government has\r\nfrequently complained to the Sultan Mulai Abderahman, the Kaliph\r\nAllah and Emir El Mumenin (Prince of Believers), of the commission\r\nof these outrages, and has put forward a demand for reparation and\r\ncompensation for damages.\r\n\r\n‘The Sultan, who is the friend of the powerful Queen of England,\r\nmy Sovereign, under whose sway there are fifty million of Mussulmans\r\nwhom she governs with justice and kindness, issued his Sherifian\r\ncommands to you Rifians to cease from these outrages; but you paid\r\nno attention to the orders of the Kaliph of the Prophet.\r\n\r\n‘The Queen then sent a squadron to chastise the pirates and\r\nobtain redress; but the Admiral took pity on the villages, where\r\ninnocent women and children dwelt, and did not fire a gun or burn\r\na ‘kareb,’ as he might have done. He had a parley with the\r\nBenibugaffer people and other inhabitants of villages where boats\r\nare kept.\r\n\r\n‘They made false promises and pretended they would cease to commit\r\noutrages, but, as was to be expected, they have broken faith, and\r\nsince that parley have been guilty of further acts of piracy. So now\r\nI have come to see you and hear whether the Rifians in the inland\r\nvillages will continue to suffer these outrages to be committed by\r\nthose who dwell on the coast, which may expose all the honest and\r\ninnocent inhabitants of the Rif to the horrors of war.\r\n\r\n‘I have begged that no steps should be taken by my countrymen,\r\nlest the innocent should suffer, until I make this final attempt\r\nto come to an understanding with you; but I have to warn you, as a\r\ntrue friend, if another outrage be committed, my great and powerful\r\nSovereign, in conjunction with the Sultan, will send large forces\r\nby sea and by land to carry fire and sword into your villages, and\r\nbring the whole population under subjection. H.S.M. may then think\r\nfit to compel the Rif tribes dwelling on the coast to migrate to\r\nthe interior of his realms, or, at any rate, they will no longer be\r\nallowed to possess a single boat for trade, or even for fishing.\r\n\r\n‘I now ask—Will you inland inhabitants tolerate the continuance\r\nof piracy on the part of your brethren on the coast?—Will you brave\r\ninhabitants of the coast continue to set Allah’s laws at defiance,\r\nand thus expose your lives and property, and those of your inland\r\nbrethren, to destruction?’\r\n\r\nThe old Chief again spoke, and others stood up and joined him, saying:\r\n‘He is right. We shall not allow these robberies to be committed on\r\nour friends the English; such outrages must cease, and if continued,\r\nwe shall be prepared to chastise the guilty.’\r\n\r\nThe Benibugaffer Chiefs said, ‘We approve.’\r\n\r\n‘I know,’ I continued, ‘you Rifians do not sign treaties or\r\nlike documents; but the words of brave men are more worthy of trust\r\nthan treaties, which are too often broken. Give me your hands.’\r\nI held out mine. As the pledge of good faith I shook the hands of\r\nthe chiefs, including the Benibugaffer.\r\n\r\n‘Remember,’ I said, ‘it is not English vessels, but all vessels\r\nwithout exception must be respected on approaching your shores.’\r\n\r\n‘We agree,’ they cried.\r\n\r\nUpon which I exclaimed, ‘I have faith in your words. May God’s\r\nmercy and blessing be on you all and grant you prosperity and\r\nhappiness! The Rifians and English shall remain true friends for\r\never. I bid you farewell.’\r\n\r\n‘Stay,’ said the chief of a neighbouring village, ‘come with us\r\nand be our guest. We shall kill an ox to feast you and our brethren\r\nhere, and bid you welcome. You are a hunter; we shall show you sport,\r\nand become better acquainted with each other. Upon our heads shall\r\nbe your life and those of your friends.’\r\n\r\nPointing to the frigate, I said: ‘That vessel has to return\r\nimmediately, and I have to report what has been done, in order to\r\nstop all preparations for seeking through other means to obtain\r\nthe satisfaction you have so readily offered. I should have been\r\ndelighted to have gone with you and should have felt as safe as if\r\namongst my own countrymen. You are a brave race, incapable of doing\r\na wrong to a true friend. I shall never forget the manner in which\r\nyou have received me.\r\n\r\n‘I bid you all farewell. I believe in your promises, even those\r\nmade by the Benibugaffer. Send messengers at once to the villages\r\non the coast and let them know the promises you have made, which\r\nthey also must be required to carry out strictly.’\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and their followers tried all they could to persuade\r\nme to accompany them but finally consented that I should depart,\r\non promising that I would some day revisit them.\r\n\r\nColonel Buceta was surprised to learn the result of my visit,\r\nbut said the Rifians would never keep faith, and that we should\r\nsoon hear of fresh acts of piracy. ‘In such case,’ I replied,\r\n‘we shall have to land a force and burn every hamlet and boat on\r\nthe coast; but I have every hope the Rifians will keep faith.’\r\n\r\nThey have kept faith, and since that parley near Melilla no vessels,\r\neither British or of other nationality, have been captured or molested\r\nby the Rifians[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was amongst these wild and lawless Rifians that Mr. Hay found the\r\nmost thorough sportsmen, and also men capable of great attachment\r\nand devotion. Always much interested in the history of this race,\r\nin their customs and mode of life, he wrote an interesting account\r\nof the tribes which inhabit the north of Morocco and of his personal\r\nintercourse with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rif province extends along the Mediterranean coast to the eastward\r\nfrom a site called Borj Ustrak, in the province of Tetuan, for about\r\na hundred and fifty miles to the stream marked in maps as ‘Fum\r\nAjrud’ (mouth of Ajrud), the northern boundary between Morocco\r\nand Algiers.\r\n\r\nThe Rif country to the southward, inland from the Mediterranean coast,\r\nextends about thirty-five miles and on the westward is bordered by\r\nthe Tetuan province and the mountains of Khamás and Ghamára.\r\n\r\nThe population of Rif amounts, as far as can be calculated, to about\r\n150,000 souls. The Rifians are a Berber race, and have never been\r\nconquered by the various nations—Phœnicians, Romans, Goths, and\r\nArabs—who have invaded Mauritania: they have always maintained\r\ntheir independence; but on the conquest of Morocco by the Arabs,\r\nthe Rifians accepted the Mohammedan faith, and acknowledged the\r\nSovereigns of Morocco as the Kaliphs of the Prophet.\r\n\r\nThe country is mountainous, the soil in most parts poor, and though\r\nthe Rif is rich in iron, copper, and other minerals, there are no\r\nroads or means of conveyance to the seaboard. There are large forests\r\nof ‘el aris[28],’ which the Rifians convey in their ‘karebs’\r\n(sailing boats) to Tetuan and Tangier. They have no saws, so when a\r\ntree is felled it is cut away with a hatchet until a beam or plank\r\nis shaped, generally about ten feet long by a foot wide. This timber\r\nhas a strong aromatic odour, and when not exposed to damp is more\r\ndurable than oak. It was used for the woodwork of the Alhambra at\r\nGranada and other Moorish palaces in Spain, and though many of the\r\nArabesque ornaments in plaster or stucco have fallen into decay and\r\nwalls have crumbled, this woodwork remains sound.\r\n\r\nThe Rifians are an industrious race; but their barren hills do not\r\nproduce sufficient grain to provide food for the population. Large\r\nnumbers migrate every year to different parts of Morocco, especially\r\nto the northern provinces, and are employed to cultivate orchards and\r\ngardens round Tangier and Tetuan. The majority of the inhabitants of\r\nthe town and neighbouring districts of Tangier are of Rif extraction.\r\n\r\nIn the Rif the natives do not submit to any authority except upon\r\nreligious or legal questions, such as marriage, inheritance, and\r\ntitle deeds. The ‘f’ki,’ or chief priest in a village mosque,\r\ndraws up, with the aid of ‘tolba’ or public notaries, all legal\r\ndocuments regarding marriage or property. In other matters the Rifian\r\ndoes not submit to legislation; his gun, pistol, and dagger are his\r\njudge and jury—yet crimes such as robbery, theft, or outrages on\r\nwomen are rarely known, but murder from feud is rife throughout the\r\ncountry to a frightful extent. No man’s life is secure, even though\r\nhe be a distant relative, such as the great-grandson, of some one\r\nwho may have taken a life thirty years before in a blood feud. The\r\nwidow of a murdered man will teach her son, as soon as he can carry\r\na gun or pistol, how to use those arms, and daily remind him that\r\nhis father must be avenged lest the son be looked upon as despicable.\r\n\r\nThe men always go armed even in their own villages. Cursing, swearing,\r\nor abusive language, so common amongst the Moors, are rarely heard\r\nin Rif; for the man who ventures to use an opprobrious epithet knows\r\nthat he incurs the risk of being stabbed or shot. A Rifian never\r\nforgives or forgets an insult.\r\n\r\nThey are distinguished for their courage. During the war between\r\nSpain and Morocco in 1859, they did not obey the appeal of the Sultan\r\nfor assistance; but the inhabitants of the district of Zarhon near\r\nFas, who are of Rif extraction, sent a contingent of 1,500 men to\r\nTetuan. They arrived a few days before the battle of ‘Agraz’—the\r\nlast which took place between the Moors and Spaniards before the\r\npeace of 1860—and fought so determinedly that two-thirds of their\r\nnumber fell during that battle.\r\n\r\nPolygamy is extremely rare in Rif. Few men venture to take a second\r\nwife lest offence be given thereby to the father or brother of either\r\nof the women they have married. Even in Tangier, where there is a\r\npopulation of over 9,000 Mohammedans, chiefly Rifians by descent,\r\nI never heard of more than four or five Moors who had two wives. When\r\nan exception occurs, it has generally been at the request of the wife,\r\nwho, having had no child, begs her husband to marry some cousin or\r\nfriend, selected perhaps by herself.\r\n\r\nImmoral conduct on the part of married women or maidens is unknown;\r\nfor, should they be suspected of leading an irregular life by father,\r\nhusband, or other male relative, such disgrace is wiped out by death.\r\n\r\nRifian women do not cover their faces. If a man sees a young woman\r\nfetching water from a well or walking alone, he will avoid meeting\r\nher, and even turn back rather than run the risk of being seen by\r\nsome relative of the female and be suspected of having communicated\r\nwith her by word or gesture. He will shun the woman who may be alone,\r\nas a modest girl in Europe might try to avoid a man whom she should\r\nhappen to meet when walking in some lonely spot.\r\n\r\nSome years ago an old Rifian, one of my boar-hunters, who dwelt at\r\na village near Tangier, presented himself before me looking very\r\nmiserable and haggard. ‘I take refuge under the hem of your\r\ngarment,’ he exclaimed, ‘and deliver into your hands these\r\ntitle-deeds of my hut and garden, also a document regarding a mare;\r\nthese are all my possessions. I am about to deliver myself up to\r\nthe Basha of Tangier, Kaid Abbas Emkashéd, and to ask that I be\r\nsent to prison.’\r\n\r\nOn inquiring of the old hunter why he thought of taking such an\r\nextraordinary step, and also what he expected me to do with his\r\npapers and property, he replied, whilst trembling from head to\r\nfoot, with tears running down his rugged cheeks and his teeth\r\nchattering as he spoke, ‘My youngest daughter, whom I loved so\r\ndearly’—here he gasped for breath—‘is no more. I have buried\r\nher. She was put to death with my consent.’ Poor Hadj Kassim then\r\ncovered his face and sobbed violently, paused to recover himself,\r\nand continued, ‘The authorities have heard that my daughter,\r\nwho was very beautiful, has disappeared, and have given orders that\r\nsome innocent persons who are suspected should be arrested, as it\r\nis supposed she has been carried off or murdered. I cannot remain a\r\npassive spectator whilst innocent men suffer, feeling that the whole\r\nblame of the disappearance of my child rests on me alone. My daughter\r\nwas of a joyous character, and, like a silly girl, thought only of\r\namusement. Both her mother and I had repeatedly punished her for going\r\nto weddings or other festivities without our permission. She had been\r\nwarned that misconduct on her part, as a Rifian maiden, would never\r\nbe forgiven; but she took no heed. Some neighbours reported that she\r\nhad been seen going to Tangier to dance in the “mesriahs.” Her\r\nshameless conduct became a source of great scandal in the village,\r\nand as it was supposed that I countenanced her misconduct, I was\r\nshunned by my friends. They no longer returned my salams, and when\r\nI joined the elders, who are wont to assemble of an afternoon on\r\nour village green, they turned their backs on me.\r\n\r\n‘Life had become a burden, and my son, who was also taunted by\r\nyoung men for having a sister of bad repute, came to me yesterday,\r\nwhen he heard that she had again gone off to the town, and declared\r\nthat as Rifians we could not allow a daughter and sister who did\r\nnot obey her parents, and brought disgrace on her family, to live.\r\n\r\n‘Though I loved dearly my foolish child,’ continued the old\r\nhunter, ‘I gave way to the passionate language of my son, and\r\nconsented that, should we discover she danced at the “mesriah,”\r\nshe should die.\r\n\r\n‘We went to Tangier and concealed ourselves near the entrance of a\r\n“mesriah” we were told she frequented. We saw her enter, followed\r\nby some young Moors. A little before sunset she came out, enveloped\r\nin her “haik,” and walked hurriedly towards our village. She\r\ndid not see us, and we followed her until we reached a path in the\r\nbrushwood not far from our village, and then we stopped her. My son\r\naccused her of leading a disgraceful life, and then struck her heavily\r\nwith a bill-hook on the head. She fell, never to speak again. We\r\nburied her in a secluded spot. My son killed her, but I am really her\r\nmurderer—I alone am responsible for her death; but my wretched child\r\ncould not have lived to be a curse and a disgrace.’ Then the poor\r\nHadj trembled in his acute misery, and shook as if he had the palsy.\r\n\r\n‘I shall,’ he continued, ‘present myself to the Basha. I\r\nshall not say I am the murderer, as the Basha is a Rifian, and will\r\nunderstand all when I declare I wish no man to be arrested on account\r\nof the disappearance of my child, and that I alone am responsible\r\nfor whatever may have happened to her.\r\n\r\n‘Now,’ he added, ‘you know, according to Moorish law, no man\r\ncan be punished for murder unless he acknowledges his crime, and that\r\nafter twelve months’ imprisonment, should no witnesses appear, the\r\naccused can claim to be liberated from prison. If I live, therefore, I\r\nshall be released; but I care no longer for life, except it be to work\r\nand provide for my wife and remaining daughter. As to the title-deeds\r\nof my property, I implore you to keep them until I am released, for,\r\nas you know, it is the practice of the authorities to take possession\r\nof the property of a prisoner who is a criminal such as I am. You have\r\noften lent me small sums of money—for I have been your hunter—and\r\nyou have not asked to be repaid. Should there be any attempt on the\r\npart of the authorities to take possession of my house, garden, or\r\nmare, or should my family be called upon to give up the title-deeds,\r\nI have directed them to say the “Bashador” is in possession of\r\nall our property as a guarantee for repayment of money advanced by\r\nhim. This will check extortion. The Basha is of my tribe, and will\r\nbe just and merciful to a poor Rifian in misfortune. He knows that\r\ndeath is better than dishonour and disgrace. Oh! my unhappy child!’\r\nhe exclaimed; ‘your life has been taken, and I long for the day\r\nwhen Allah may take mine!’ and again the old man wept piteously.\r\n\r\nI took charge of his papers; he presented himself that day before\r\nthe Basha, and after having a few questions put to him, was lodged\r\nin prison. As he left the presence of the Basha, the latter called\r\nto the guard who led him away, and said, ‘No fetters are to be\r\nplaced on this man; his family may visit him.’\r\n\r\nHadj Kassim remained a year in prison, and on his release presented\r\nhimself to me to recover his papers, informing me that no steps had\r\nbeen taken to seize his property, but, on the contrary, the Basha\r\nhad shown him kindness in prison, sending him occasionally a little\r\npresent in money; and that when he was brought before him, on being\r\nlet out of prison, the Basha said, ‘We are Rifians. The most High\r\nand Merciful God forgives the sins of men. I also forgive thee.’\r\n\r\nThe wretched man never hunted again or associated with his\r\nfellow-villagers, whose esteem and regard he had regained. His spirit\r\nwas broken; he wandered about, pale and emaciated—speechless\r\neven—amongst his friends. A few months after his release from\r\nprison I learnt that he had died.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interest which Mr. Hay took in the natives was not entirely\r\nconfined to the Rifians. The needs and sufferings of his poorer\r\nneighbours—whether Christian, Hebrew, or Moslem—always met with\r\nhis sympathy, and, so far as lay in his power, he sought to assist\r\nthem in times of distress. In December, 1857, after a severe famine,\r\nhe writes to his wife, then in England:—\r\n\r\n\r\nMy farm has yielded wheat plentifully: I have enough for the house,\r\nfor seed, and some hundred almuds over, which I shall give in your\r\nname to the poor Christians, Jews, and Moors this winter—equally\r\ndivided—as there is, I fear, great misery. The poor peasants\r\nhad no seed to sow this year, so there is a lack of wheat. I have\r\nasked the Sultan to lend seed gratis to the poorer farmers, and, to\r\npractise what I preach, I shall lay out £100 for the same object. If\r\nsomething is not done we shall have fever and famine again this\r\nyear. At present the general health is excellent and there are no\r\nfevers, but I fear the winter, and poor folk flocking into the town,\r\nwill bring typhus again.\r\n\r\nOnly think of a rascally Jew trying to sell me some $10,000 worth\r\nof stolen jewels for $2,000. From the stupidity of the Governor’s\r\nsoldiers, the accomplices in the robbery made off with the jewels\r\nbefore they were seized, though I had given notice. The only person\r\nseized was the Jew who tried to bribe me into committing the roguery.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, since my return, there have been two other\r\nattempts made to impose upon me gifts to large amounts to secure\r\nmy good-will. Of course I have declined to receive them, but I am\r\nalmost ashamed to think that people should have such a poor opinion\r\nof my character as to venture upon making me such offers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn proof that his kindness was not unrecognised by the natives,\r\nthe following anecdote is told by Mrs. Chapman, Sir John’s only\r\nsurviving sister:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three years after the famine in Morocco, one of the tribes from\r\nthe interior sent a deputation of chiefs who asked to speak to John.\r\n\r\nDuring the great scarcity, he had sent for corn from Spain, and\r\ndispatched camels laden with grain to the different tribes who were\r\nsuffering from starvation, to relieve their distress and supply them\r\nwith seed to sow their land.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs, fine hill-men, were received by my brother and unfolded\r\nthe purpose of their mission. They said, ‘We have heard a report\r\nthat you are about to dig a well in one of your gardens. We come to\r\nentreat you to allow us to do this thing for you, as a slight proof\r\nof our gratitude for your generosity. You heard that we and our\r\nfamilies were starving; you did not know us, but you believe in the\r\none God and Father of us all, and you would not let your brothers\r\nwant; you sent your gold across the sea and caused a ship to come,\r\nladen with grain, and sent camels with sacks of corn for our food\r\nand to sow our land. God will reward you!—but let _us_ do this\r\nlittle thing. We will come with our families and encamp around your\r\ngarden, we will dig your well and tend your fruit and flowers and\r\ntake nothing. We will bring our cattle and our sheep for food, and\r\nyou shall be at no cost on our account. This will partly satisfy our\r\ndesire to show our gratitude, and you, when you drink of the water\r\nof this well, will remember your poor brethren whom you saved from\r\ndeath, for love of the one God.’\r\n\r\nJohn consented, and gave them leave to do as they wished.\r\n\r\nWhen the report spread that these wild people were coming within a\r\nmile of Tangier, the alarmed townsfolk sent a messenger to beg my\r\nbrother to dissuade the tribe from coming, declaring that they were\r\nmuch to be feared, and that their proximity would endanger the peace\r\nof the town. My brother told the messenger he would be responsible\r\nfor the orderly conduct of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThey came and dug the well, the garden and grounds were left in\r\nperfect order, and the strangers quitted the neighbourhood in peace,\r\ngoing quietly back to their hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the gratitude of which these wild people are\r\ncapable may be inserted here, though the actual occurrence took\r\nplace a few years later, and after another and similar bad season\r\nwith failure of crops in the Rif.\r\n\r\nIn the stress of famine the starving mountaineers crowded, with their\r\nfamilies, to Tangier in search of work and food. Strenuous efforts\r\nwere made by the people of Tangier and the foreign Representatives\r\nto assist these unhappy folk. In reply to an appeal from Sir John,\r\na large subscription was raised in Gibraltar, and expended in flour,\r\nwhich was sent for distribution to the care of the British Legation\r\nat Tangier.\r\n\r\nSome of these unfortunate Rifians found work near Tangier; others,\r\ntheir immediate wants relieved, as tidings came from Rif that rain\r\nhad fallen and prospects were better, returned to their homes in\r\nsmall detachments; but many remained. Cholera and smallpox broke out\r\namongst these, and numbers died, leaving orphan children, too young,\r\nin many instances, to be able to give any account of themselves or\r\ntheir families. These were adopted by charitable townsfolk, and are\r\nnow many of them prosperous, well-to-do individuals. But when the\r\ncholera and famine were ended, several hundred Rifians, with their\r\nfamilies, remained. These poor people were finally dismissed in a body\r\nto their own country, provided with the means of purchasing seed-corn,\r\nand with clothing and food for their journey. When leaving Tangier\r\nthey assembled at daybreak outside the gates of the town. There,\r\nraising their hands to heaven, they called down a blessing from God\r\non the town and people, and more especially on the Christians who\r\nhad shown them such charity and kindness.\r\n\r\nNot long after they gave good proof of their gratitude. A ship was\r\nwrecked on the coast inhabited by some of these very Rifians. The\r\ncrew were succoured and sheltered by them, and a contingent personally\r\nconducted them in safety to Tangier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                   SECOND MISSION TO MARÁKESH. 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade in Morocco had not always laboured under the disadvantages\r\nwhich existed in 1855. So far back as 1725 Sultan Mulai Abdallah\r\nencouraged commerce by imposing a system of moderate duties, free\r\nof all monopolies and contracts—and with regard to the garrison\r\nof Gibraltar and the British fleet, frequently granted supplies free\r\nof all duties.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 Great Britain entered into a commercial Treaty with\r\nMorocco—renewed in 1845—but without any express stipulations as to\r\nduties; the Treaty merely confirming to Great Britain all privileges\r\ngranted to Spain in a Treaty made between that country and Morocco\r\nin 1799. Contrary, however, to the spirit of this Treaty a system had\r\ngradually arisen of monopolies, confiscation of products, high duties,\r\nand a constant alteration of tariffs, and the prohibition of articles\r\nof export without any cogent reason for such prohibition being\r\ngiven. A serious decline in commerce since 1801 had therefore ensued.\r\n\r\nIn pressing on the Sultan the necessity for a new Convention,\r\nMr. Hay pointed out that the proposals he had to make were as\r\nmuch for the benefit of the Moorish Government as for that of his\r\nown. The Sultan reigned over a country equal to any in resources,\r\nand inhabited by a hardy and intelligent race. There was therefore\r\nno reason, urged Mr. Hay, why, under wise direction, it should not\r\nequal any other in prosperity. Yet, so far from being prosperous,\r\nscarcity of coin and great poverty prevailed throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe population of Morocco, a country as large as France, contained\r\na bare 7,000,000 of inhabitants as against 36,000,000 in France and\r\n28,000,000 in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe sale of monopolies might have, in the first instance, increased\r\nthe revenues of H.S.M.; but any such increase could only be temporary,\r\nand the benefits derived from the system fell to the limited number\r\nof unscrupulous persons who obtained these concessions. The continual\r\nalterations of the tariff were most injurious to foreign traders,\r\nwho in consequence could place no dependence on the security of a\r\nroyal mandate fixing any particular tariff. Again, the high duties\r\noffered a premium on smuggling. Even if contraband trade could\r\nbe checked by careful precautions at all the ports, it would soon\r\nprevail along the unguarded coasts. Once firmly established, such\r\na trade would be extremely difficult to check.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay argued that the export of grain and agricultural produce would\r\npowerfully promote increased production. He alluded, in proof of his\r\nargument, to various foreign countries where a large, free export\r\nof grain had greatly extended agricultural operations. Especially\r\nhe instanced Algeria, which before the French occupation had only\r\nproduced grain and oil sufficient for home consumption; but since\r\nthen had, in addition, exported largely to France.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay combated the superstitious objections of the Moors to\r\nselling food stuffs to the Nazarenes by reminding the Sultan that\r\nhis subjects were clothed in materials manufactured by Christians,\r\nhis soldiers armed and their horses shod with weapons and shoes\r\nmade of European iron, and declared that persons who argued in such\r\na sense were ‘rebels against God,’ since He had not denied the\r\nChristian and the Jew any privileges granted by Him to the Moslem.\r\n\r\nFinally Mr. Hay suggested that it would be desirable that the\r\nadvantages of such a Convention should be shared by other Powers in\r\ncommon with Great Britain, and ventured to warn the Sultan that a\r\nTreaty of Commerce made in time of peace by a friendly Power would\r\nbe preferable to the risk of having to make such a Treaty at a more\r\ncritical moment, when the opportunity might arise for one of the\r\nPowers to enforce its demands; for assuredly the present Convention\r\nwould not be renewed under its old conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was to press upon the Moorish Government the advisability of a\r\nCommercial Convention on the lines above indicated, that, in 1855,\r\nby the direction of the British Government, Mr. Hay left Tangier for\r\nMarákesh. The mission set out in March, 1855. On his way Mr. Hay\r\neverywhere met with a courteous reception. Azamor, however, a town\r\ncontiguous to Rabát, proved an exception. There he experienced very\r\ndifferent treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nKaid Ben Tahir, he writes, Governor of Azamor—a great\r\nfanatic—hated the sight of Europeans, but in pursuance of express\r\norders received from the Sultan, came out with the chief officials\r\nof Azamor and some troops to meet me some distance from the town\r\nand conducted me to our camp.\r\n\r\nThe following day, according to etiquette, I called on the Kaid\r\nat his residence. As I entered the porch, the ‘m’haznía’\r\n(military guards), about forty in number—instead of being drawn\r\nup standing in line to receive me—were squatting on the ground,\r\nforming a double rank, reaching close to the kiosk in which the\r\nGovernor was seated, thus leaving only a narrow passage for me to\r\npass through. Some even had their legs sprawled out in my way. These\r\nI trod upon heavily, or kicked aside, much to their dismay.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, who was seated, counting the beads of a rosary, on a\r\nsmall divan, remained seated as I approached, without attempting to\r\nrise or salute me; neither had he any chair or other resting-place to\r\noffer me, and merely held out his hand saying ‘You are welcome.’\r\nTaking his hand with a firm grip I lifted him gently from his divan\r\nand said, ‘I am glad to see you.’ When I got his astonished\r\nExcellency well on his legs, I wheeled him round suddenly and dropped\r\non the middle of the divan where he had been seated, leaving him\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nKaid Ben Tahir looked bewildered, gazed first at me and then at his\r\nguards, and I think was still meditating whether to bolt or to call\r\nhis scowling attendants to seize and bastinado me, when I addressed\r\nhim—‘How thoughtful and attentive of you to have prepared this\r\ncomfortable divan for me to sit upon without providing for yourself\r\na chair or even a stool where you could sit to entertain me.’\r\n\r\nHe murmured, ‘The divan is my seat.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah!’ I said, ‘So you intended to remain seated whilst the\r\nRepresentative of the greatest Sovereign in the world, accredited\r\nto your Lord the Sultan as Envoy, came to call on you! How do you\r\nlike the position in which you desired to place me? I shall report\r\nyour conduct to the Sultan, as also the behaviour of your guards,\r\nfor I consider your and their conduct a marked insult.’\r\n\r\nKaid Ben Tahir faltered out, ‘I have erred through ignorance. You\r\nare the first European Representative whom I have received and I\r\nnever offer a seat to Moorish officials who call upon me—I ask\r\nyour pardon.’\r\n\r\nMoving a little aside on the divan, I said, ‘Come, there is room\r\nfor us both to sit down and I hope we shall be able to understand\r\neach other.’\r\n\r\nThe Governor sat down and we made friends, so I told him I should\r\nnot report the occurrence to his Lord and Master the Sultan.\r\n\r\nAs I left, he rose and accompanied me to the threshold, the guards\r\nwere all standing at attention, looking aghast at the Nazarene\r\nwho had treated their tyrannical master with such ignominy; but\r\nthe chief Kaid (or captain of the guard) whispered, as I passed,\r\n‘Andek el hak’ (you are right), ‘respect is due to the Envoy\r\nsent to our Lord the Sultan.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther on the way to Marákesh Mr. Hay traversed the province of\r\nShawía, where a curious incident of a more pleasing character took\r\nplace, which he describes as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrders had been given by the Sultan that the Governor of each\r\nprovince through which we passed should meet the Mission with a body\r\nof cavalry, and escort us until we were met by the Governor of the\r\nadjoining province.\r\n\r\nI found these ceremonial meetings very tedious, so frequently left my\r\nTangier escort and, taking a man on foot to carry my gun, wandered\r\nfrom the beaten track towards the next encampment, in pursuit of\r\ngame. As I was clad on such occasions in shooting attire, an ample\r\ncloth cloak was borne by one of the troopers of my escort, and\r\nthis I donned when a Basha or other officer came in sight. ‘Buena\r\ncapa, todo tapa’ (‘a good cloak covers all’)—the Spaniards\r\nsay—and as the Moorish officials present themselves with their\r\nfollowers on these occasions, _en grande tenue_, it was not seemly\r\nthat the British Representative should have the appearance of a\r\nsecond-class gamekeeper.\r\n\r\nOne morning, whilst thus shooting in a field of corn, the man who\r\nwas leading my horse came running to say he could see within half\r\na mile the Governor of Shawía, with a body of cavalry, approaching.\r\n\r\nMounting my nag, I directed him to call the trooper who carried my\r\ncloak—but he could not be found.\r\n\r\nAs the Governor approached, riding with his Khalífa\r\n(Lieutenant-Governor) and two sons in front of the Arab cavalry,\r\nwho formed two lines, I observed the chief was beautifully dressed,\r\nas were also his followers, and their horses richly caparisoned.\r\n\r\nThey advanced till within fifty yards of where I had taken my stand,\r\nfor, as my Queen’s Representative, I always required that these\r\nGovernors should, according to Moorish etiquette on encountering a\r\nsuperior, advance first towards me, and when within a few yards I\r\nwould move forward to meet them.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had halted, waiting for me to approach, so I directed\r\nmy attendant to say that I was very desirous to have the pleasure\r\nof making his acquaintance, therefore would the Governor come forward.\r\n\r\nThis staggered the great man, who, for the first time during his\r\nGovernorship, had been sent to meet a European Envoy, and I overheard\r\nthe following dialogue:—\r\n\r\n_My Attendant._ ‘The Envoy says that he will have much pleasure\r\nin making your Excellency’s acquaintance, if you will have the\r\ngoodness to approach.’\r\n\r\n_Governor Reshid._ ‘Is that shabbily-clad Nazarene, whom I see\r\nmounted on a “kida” (pack horse), the Envoy, and does he expect\r\nme to go to him?’\r\n\r\n_Attendant._ ‘Yes, my Lord.’\r\n\r\n‘Mashallah!’ exclaimed the Governor, and spurring his horse rather\r\nangrily, which made it bound forward, curvetting, he approached and\r\nheld out his hand.\r\n\r\nI then advanced also, and we shook hands. The Governor, looking\r\nrather amazed at my appearance, bid me welcome in flowery language,\r\nand, placing me between himself and his Khalífa, we commenced the\r\nmarch towards the camp, which he informed me was distant about a\r\ntwo hours’ ride.\r\n\r\nKaid Reshid was dressed in a caftan of pale unicoloured cloth,\r\nembroidered in silk, over which hung gracefully a transparent white\r\n‘haik’; a fez and huge turban covered his head. The red saddle\r\non which he rode, and the horse’s breastplate, were beautifully\r\nembroidered in gold on red velvet. The bridle and trappings were of\r\nred silk, also embroidered with gold. His massive iron stirrups were\r\nengraved in gold arabesques. By his side walked a slave carrying a\r\nlong Moorish gun.\r\n\r\nThe Kaid was a handsome man, with Caucasian features, complexion\r\nolive, but not darker than that of the inhabitants of Southern\r\nEurope. He kept eyeing me and my horse from head to foot. After\r\na pause he addressed me in polite language, though evidently much\r\namused at my shabby appearance and English saddle, and said, ‘I\r\nam sure our Lord the Sultan will present you with a better horse to\r\nreplace the “kida” you are now riding.’\r\n\r\nAs the Moors are generally big men, horses below 15 hands are not used\r\nby the cavalry; and Bashas, Kaids, and other officers ride horses\r\nstanding about 16 hands. My mount was a small Barb of about 14.2,\r\nwell bred and very fast. Ponies of this size are called ‘kidas,’\r\nand are never used as saddle-horses, but merely as pack animals.\r\n\r\n‘I thank you much, Kaid Reshid,’ I replied, ‘for your good\r\nwishes that I may enjoy the favour of the Sultan. Allow me to tell\r\nyou that, from the moment I had the pleasure of riding alongside of\r\nyour magnificent charger, I have been wrapt in admiration both of\r\nyour own appearance and of the trappings of your high-bred steed,\r\nreminding me of the paintings and sculptures I have seen of the\r\nancient people of the East and of the early Christians.’\r\n\r\nWith a haughty, angry expression, Kaid Reshid replied, ‘Are you\r\nmocking me, saying I am like a Nazarene? What resemblance can there\r\nbe between us Mussulmans and the Románi[29]?’\r\n\r\n‘I said not that your appearance resembled that of the modern, but\r\nof the ancient Christian. The graceful, flowing robes you now wear,\r\nare like those depicted in pictures of the early Christians. Your\r\n“haik”—a garment without seam—is such as it is described\r\nour Saviour, “Sidna Aisa” (our Lord Jesus), whom you call the\r\n“Spirit of God,” wore on earth. Your saddle and stirrups are\r\nprecisely of the form of those which Christians used in early times,\r\nand even two centuries ago, before the invention of fire-arms,\r\nwhen the lance was their chief weapon on horseback. Your bridle\r\nand the trappings about the neck of your horse are precisely those\r\nI have seen depicted in ancient Greek sculptures. Know you not,\r\nBasha, by the respective dates of the Christian and Mohammedan\r\nera, that the former are the more ancient people who believe in\r\nGod Almighty? The Christian as well as the Mohammedan religion,\r\nand I may add, art and science came from the East. It is no shame,\r\ntherefore, that your costume should be like unto that of the early\r\nChristians. As to my present garb, I gather from your expression\r\nthat you find it very uncouth as compared with that of the Moslem;\r\nand my saddle and bridle no doubt appear to you scrimp and mean;\r\nbut Europeans, when they progressed in warfare and manufactures,\r\ncast aside the flowing robes, which encumbered their movements, and\r\nadopted this tight-fitting clothing, by which they obtain greater\r\nfreedom for the use of their limbs. They found the saddle, such as the\r\nMoslem now uses, too heavy, and that the breastplate, large stirrups,\r\n&c., needlessly overweighted the horse and hindered his speed. I\r\nam not surprised you regard with contempt my “kida,” and that\r\nyou express a hope the Sultan may give me a better mount. Now, in\r\norder that I may give you proof of the truth of what I have said, I\r\nchallenge the best horseman you have amongst your chiefs to race with\r\nme to yonder rock in our path (about a quarter of a mile distant),\r\ngo round it, and return to you. I see the Khalífa and your sons\r\nare mounted on magnificent steeds—I challenge them.’\r\n\r\nOne of the Basha’s sons spurred his horse angrily, so that it reared\r\nand curvetted, and said, ‘Oh! my father, the Envoy is making fun\r\nof us.’\r\n\r\n‘No,’ I replied, ‘that is not my intention. Let us have the\r\nrace, and I swear that if this “kida” does not win, I dismount\r\nand make it a present to the winner.’\r\n\r\n‘The Envoy is in earnest,’ said Kaid Reshid, and, turning to his\r\nsons and the Khalífa, added, ‘You are to gallop to that rock,\r\ngo round it, and return. Whoever reaches me first wins. I remain\r\nhere with the troops in line.’\r\n\r\nOur four horses were placed in a row, and at a signal from the Basha\r\nwe all started. My three opponents dashed off at full speed, ramming\r\nin their long spurs till the blood streamed, whilst I held in hand\r\nmy swift little nag, riding about six yards behind one of the sons,\r\nwho, turning round as we galloped, and holding out his hand, said,\r\n‘Shall I help you along?’ I laughed and replied, ‘Thanks,\r\nI am coming.’\r\n\r\nAs we approached the rock I closed on them and my nag, having a good\r\nmouth, turned sharply round it and we were all four abreast, their\r\nhorses being much blown as they had been ridden at full speed. I\r\nhad no spurs, but merely pressing my little Barb and giving him\r\nhis head drew well in front, leaving the three horses twenty yards\r\nbehind and had time to reach the Basha, wheel round by his side and\r\nsee them finish, spurring furiously.\r\n\r\n‘The Envoy has won,’ said the Basha, with a dejected countenance.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said one of his sons, who was second in the race. ‘He\r\nhas deceived us. That animal he rides is no doubt a Saharáwi (a\r\nhorse from the Sahara desert), who has been bought for his weight\r\nin gold, or sent him by the Sultan as a “Shrab Reb[30].”’\r\n\r\n‘You are mistaken, my friends,’ I replied. ‘This “kida” is\r\nnot a Saharáwi horse; he was bought by me in the market at Tangier\r\nfor $22 (£4 8_s._), when he was two years old. He was then like\r\na sack of bones, but, as you see, has capital points. My saddle\r\nand bridle are light compared with yours and do not encumber his\r\nmovements. He is too in good training, being the horse I usually\r\nhunt.’\r\n\r\nAlong the line of troopers there was much excitement and talking,\r\nbut many of them looked very troubled and dejected.\r\n\r\n‘Can you use your gun on horseback?’ inquired the Basha. ‘Can\r\nyou shoot a bird or animal?’\r\n\r\nI replied that I did not often shoot from the saddle at a bird on\r\nthe wing; but that I could do so, as my nag stood fire capitally.\r\n\r\nThe Basha then requested me to shoot from my horse any game that might\r\nbe started. The cavalry formed a long line—we were riding over a\r\nstony plain, clad with grass and other herbage. The day was very hot;\r\ngame therefore lay close, and every now and then partridges or other\r\nbirds rose, but were too far for me to shoot. At length, fortunately,\r\na ‘hobar,’ or great bustard, rose about twenty-five yards off. I\r\nput my horse at a gallop, and before the huge bird could get into\r\nfull swing to soar away, I was beneath it and brought it down.\r\n\r\nA shout of admiration was raised by all the troopers, and their\r\nshrill cries of joy were repeated, as I also had the good fortune\r\nto knock over a partridge which happened to rise immediately after\r\nI had reined in my horse.\r\n\r\nThe Basha came up, holding out his hand and shook mine warmly,\r\nsaying, ‘You have won our hearts. All you have said about dress,\r\nhorse, &c., you have proved to be true. God forbid that we should\r\never have to fight against warriors like yourself.’\r\n\r\nI replied that neither as a horseman nor as a marksman could I\r\ncompare myself with many of my countrymen, and that I felt persuaded\r\nif only the Moors would adopt the saddles and firearms of Europeans,\r\nthey would not only be able to do all that we could, but that, as\r\na grand race of men, blessed by God with muscular power and great\r\nintelligence, they might surpass us, as their forefathers had done\r\nin Spain a few centuries ago, when they taught the world literature,\r\nscience, and warfare.\r\n\r\nThe Basha and I became great friends. He invited me to his tent,\r\nwhere he had prepared a feast. Many of the chiefs crowded round me\r\nwhen I dismounted and asked to shake hands with me. They examined\r\nmy horse, saddle, and bridle with interest.\r\n\r\nThe Basha and I had a long conversation, and I told him of the\r\nwonders of Christendom. Before we parted next day, when we were\r\nabout to meet the Governor of Dukála, I put on my fine cloak, and\r\ntold Kaid Reshid that it was the garment I had intended to have worn\r\nthe day we met, and thus to have hidden beneath its folds myself and\r\nmy ‘kida,’ but that the trooper who should have attended me had\r\nfailed to accompany me.\r\n\r\n‘It is better as it happened,’ said the good-natured Basha,\r\n‘we have learnt much and part good friends. You have taught me\r\nand my followers a lesson we shall never forget.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 18 Mr. Hay reached Marákesh, and writes to his wife ‘I\r\ndo not despair of doing some good, but shall have up-hill work.’\r\n\r\nDays passed, still the promised interview with the Sultan had not\r\nbeen suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we are still, and have not yet seen the Sultan, but expect the\r\naudience to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have had some disagreeable business, even been compelled to return\r\nthe Minister’s letters. They have conceded some of the points I\r\nhad demanded regarding etiquette, though little is gained towards\r\nthe negotiations; but without proper respect in form we could never\r\nget any result in deeds.\r\n\r\nWe are all well, but rather tired of waiting here. Our weather is\r\nbeautiful and not too hot. We have been amusing ourselves with sights\r\nof dwarfs, snake charmers, and a stone that talked (ventriloquism)\r\nand told me I had two little girls in Tangier, &c.!\r\n\r\nIf I have the audience to-morrow I shall try and push on the\r\nnegotiation and hope in three weeks to set off again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was while he was thus waiting at the Moorish Court that Mr. Hay\r\nwitnessed a curious performance of the ‘Hamadsha,’ a sect\r\nwhich in some respects resembles that of the Aisawa—or snake\r\ncharmers—described in _Western Barbary_. The origin of this sect\r\nis remote and obscure, and probably its rites date from pagan times.\r\n\r\nThe Hamadsha, like the Aisawa, have a curious dance of their own; but\r\nthe votaries of the former sect, unlike the Aisawa, cut themselves\r\nwith knives and hatchets, run swords into various parts of their\r\npersons, and generally mutilate themselves when under the excitement\r\nof their fanatical rites. A large iron ball is carried in their\r\nprocessions, and this is constantly thrown in the air and caught on\r\nthe heads of the Hamadsha as it falls. The dances of this sect are\r\naccompanied by ‘ghaiatta’ (pipes) and curious drums in the form\r\nof large earthenware cylinders with skin stretched over one end,\r\nthat give out when struck a peculiarly pleasant, deep note. These\r\ndrums are borne on one shoulder and beaten in that position by the\r\nbearer. Like the Aisawa, they dance in a circle, linked closely\r\ntogether by placing each an arm over the next man’s neck. Their\r\nSheikh and fugleman stands with the musicians in the centre of the\r\ncircle and directs their movements, as they jump in the air, rocking\r\ntheir bodies forward with a peculiar sidelong stamp of their feet.\r\n\r\nNo doubt these Hamadsha are more or less under the influence of\r\n‘majun’ (a preparation of hemp), but there is also little doubt\r\nthat the votaries of the sect are carried away by excitement when\r\nthey hear the sound of the drums, or see their fellows jumping,\r\nand Mr. Hay related the following anecdote of what occurred at one\r\nof these performances when a passing body of Hamadsha entered the\r\nprecincts of the house where the Mission was quartered.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay and his friends assembled in an upper gallery to watch\r\nthe curious rites of the sect in the courtyard below, where were\r\ngathered the native attendants and the escort with their Kaid,\r\na grave, elderly man, always scrupulously attired in rich clothing\r\nand of an obese habit, being much addicted to ‘siksu.’\r\n\r\nThe Hamadsha, in a closely woven circle, gyrated and rocked to the\r\nsound of their sonorous drums, much to the delight of the natives,\r\nbut somewhat to the perturbation of the Kaid, who, it appeared,\r\nwas himself a member of the sect. The respectable old gentleman,\r\nreclining on his cushioned divan, presently sat up straight and\r\ngravely nodded his head in time to the beat of the drums. The music\r\nquickened. The Kaid’s agitation increased; unconsciously his body\r\nswayed in time to the movements of the Hamadsha.\r\n\r\nQuicker and yet quicker moved the measure of the drums. The Kaid\r\ndashed aside his turban, exposing his bare skull. A few more moments\r\npassed and the strain became too great: the fat commander leapt to\r\nhis feet, and, casting his garments from him, naked to the waist,\r\nhe joined the circling, rocking fanatics.\r\n\r\nAt one side of the courtyard, near a fountain which spouted from the\r\nwall, were placed several monster earthen jars, intended for keeping\r\ndrinking water clear and sweet. After jumping with his fellows for\r\na short time, the Kaid cast his eye on these and, springing aside\r\nhe seized one of them, and pitched it into the air, catching it\r\nas it fell on his shaven crown where it was dashed to pieces. He\r\nwould have proceeded to do the same with the remaining jars, had not\r\nMr. Hay called out and protested against further destruction. The\r\nKaid therefore returned to his exercise of jumping till he was\r\nexhausted; when he retreated to another fountain, which spouted in\r\na marble basin in the middle of the court, and sat on the top of it,\r\nin the midst of the spray, until cooled after his exertions.\r\n\r\nDelay after delay occurred, and a man less experienced than Mr. Hay\r\nin the dilatory tactics of the Moslem might have been baffled\r\nby the ‘feather-bed resistance’ that encountered him at every\r\nturn. Again and again he writes to his wife in the same strain, ‘I\r\ndo not despair of doing some good, but there are some sad rascals\r\nhere.’ ‘I am riding them with a tight hand and spurs. What a\r\nfaithless set they are.’ And after an even more discouraging day\r\nthan usual, he comes to the conclusion that ‘In Morocco a man can\r\nbe certain of nothing.’\r\n\r\nOf the ignorance, combined with cunning, of the generality of Moorish\r\nofficials, Mr. Hay frequently related the following story.\r\n\r\nOn this Mission to the Court of Morocco, he took with him a large map\r\nof Great Britain, her possessions and colonies, also maps of France,\r\nGermany, &c., as a present to the Uzir, with the idea of impressing\r\nthat functionary with the extent and importance of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nHaving presented them to the Uzir, he proceeded to explain the\r\ndifferent maps, and proved, as he thought, to that dignitary, the\r\nfact that our Sultana reigned over the largest territories and was\r\ntherefore the greatest Sovereign in the world.\r\n\r\n‘Sebarkallah,’ said the Uzir, ‘God is great. And you say all\r\nthese countries belong to Great Britain?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ replied Mr. Hay, ‘Our Queen rules over them all.’\r\n\r\nThe Uzir stroked his beard, considered for a while and\r\nresumed, ‘These are very beautiful maps. Where was that one\r\nmade?’—pointing, as he spoke, to the map of Great Britain and\r\nher foreign possessions.\r\n\r\n‘In London,’ was the reply, ‘and it has received the approval\r\nof the British Government.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah,’ said the Uzir, ‘if _we_ made a map of Morocco, we might\r\nalso make out, on paper, that we possessed immense territories!’\r\n\r\nAt last, however, Mr. Hay’s resolution triumphed over all obstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Thank God,’ he writes to his wife from the camp at El Kántara\r\non April 18, just a month after his arrival, ‘we have started from\r\nMarákesh. The Sultan has requested us to remain here the first night;\r\nbut to-morrow we move on a good day’s journey, and please God we\r\nshall reach Tangier on the sixteenth day. I am altogether pleased with\r\nthe result of my mission. I have, _entre nous_, obtained one thousand\r\noxen annually for our troops, in addition to the two thousand which\r\nare now exported, and also the abolition of the monopoly of sale\r\nof oxen. The negotiation of the Treaty is to be commenced in a few\r\nmonths; in the meantime some reforms are to be brought forward. The\r\nbasis of the Treaty, which is abolition of monopolies and reduction\r\nof duties, is acknowledged; but time is to be given for these slow\r\nfolk to make alterations in the fiscal system.\r\n\r\n‘Apologies have been made for past folly and discourtesy. Everything\r\ndone to please. A number of small affairs have been arranged. The\r\nSultan gave me an audience yesterday to take leave and was most\r\nkind.’\r\n\r\n\r\nYet early in the following year H.S.M. repudiated his engagements.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Only think,’ Mr. Hay writes in January, 1856, ‘of this\r\nGovernment, after all its solemn engagements to me at the Moorish\r\nCourt, pretending now to ignore all that has passed and been\r\n_promised_. I have been compelled to enter a protest against them;\r\nwhich has been done in the presence of all my colleagues. Forty\r\ndays are given to the Sultan to act up to his engagement, and\r\nthen, _nous verrons_ if these barbarians think they can _lie_ with\r\nimpunity. After my experience of the past and of various affairs,\r\nI expect that, as naughty people say of the ladies, though always\r\ndenying and refusing to accede, they will give way even when so\r\ndoing. “_Vederemos_.”’\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months later he is still engaged in negotiating the Treaty with\r\nSid Mohammed Khatíb, the special Commissioner appointed to draw\r\nup the Treaty. He writes on July 11, 1856, to his wife who had left\r\nfor England:—\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother letter from Khatíb making fair promises, but treaties are\r\n_in statû quo_. Next week, or about the end of the month, I think we\r\nmust be at Tetuan to sign, or else tell the Sultan he is a liar. The\r\ncholera is about over. I shall do my best to get home in August,\r\nfor Tangier is a dreary hole to be alone in.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut his hopes were premature. On August 10, he writes again:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI give up all hope of coming home this year, for I have fresh\r\ntrouble. After all my labour in settling the Treaty with Khatíb,\r\nthe Sultan refuses to ratify what his own Plenipotentiary agreed\r\nto! And he puts forward fresh propositions.\r\n\r\nI go to Tetuan in one of Her Majesty’s steamers as soon as the\r\nwind changes, to see Khatíb, and perhaps shall touch at other ports\r\nin Morocco.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days later, the goal was still distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Tangier, _August 21_, 1856.\r\n\r\nSince I last wrote I have been to Tetuan in H.M.S. Vesuvius; not,\r\nalas! to sign the Treaty, but solely to discuss the fresh and stupid\r\npropositions put forward by this Government. It is not impossible\r\nthat I may have to make a trip to Mogador and the other ports; if so,\r\nof course I shall go by sea.\r\n\r\nKhatíb expects the Sultan will give way after the present\r\nreference. I am less sanguine and am heartily tired of Moorish\r\ntrickery.\r\n\r\nKhatíb was excessively civil, and had prepared me a nice house,\r\nwith a garden, in the Moorish quarter. The house was furnished\r\nsplendidly in the Moorish style. The walls covered with velvet\r\nhangings embroidered in gold; Persian carpets covered the floor. There\r\nwas also a magnificent brass bedstead with damask and gold hangings.\r\n\r\nI took our cook with us, but Khatíb provided some excellent Moorish\r\ndishes, and all kinds of delicacies and sweets. During my stay he\r\ninsisted on coming to my dwelling for the conference instead of my\r\ngoing to him. I only stayed a couple of days.\r\n\r\nI am now so busy that time passes most rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSid Mohammed Khatíb resided at Tetuan, and was one of the Moors who\r\nare descendants of those expelled from Spain. He owned Boabdil’s\r\nsword, until it was taken from his house in Tetuan during the\r\noccupation of that town by the Spaniards. He also possessed the\r\ntitle-deeds of his ancestors’ property in Granada and the ancient\r\nkey of their house in that city.\r\n\r\nAfter the Spanish war, Khatíb was appointed Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, to reside at Tangier, and during the years he held office\r\nMr. Hay found him always upright and honest, and ready in every way\r\nto promote any reform or improvement in the system of Government\r\nin Morocco; but after some years, he obtained permission from the\r\nSultan to retire, because, as he told Mr. Hay, he found the work too\r\nhopeless, fighting against the constant intrigues and ignorance of\r\nthe Sultan’s Ministers, and that he was too old for such a task.\r\n\r\nIn October, a couple of months later, Mr. Hay writes:—‘Final\r\norders have been sent by the Sultan to conclude the new stipulations;\r\nthings are being smoothed and I do not go to the Court again.’\r\n\r\nSo his efforts had at last been crowned with success, and though\r\nSultan Mulai Abderahman, adhering to the retrograde policy of his\r\nforefathers, had thrown constant obstacles in the path of reform\r\nadvocated by Mr. Hay, the latter had certainly won the esteem of this\r\npotentate. Of this esteem the Sultan gave the strongest proof by\r\nrequesting him to take charge of the conduct of Foreign Affairs on\r\nbehalf of the Moorish Government, and with the view of inducing him\r\nto do so, engaged that he would abide by Mr. Hay’s decision in all\r\nquestions with Foreign Governments. But as Mr. Hay knew that such an\r\noffice would raise the greatest jealousy and objection on the part\r\nof several Foreign Governments, he declined—even before reporting\r\nto Her Majesty’s Government the offer that had been made to him.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Treaty ratified by the Sultan in December 1856, Her\r\nBritannic Majesty acquired the right to appoint one or more Consuls\r\nin His Sherifian Majesty’s dominions. They were to be inviolable\r\nin house or person, and to have the right to establish a place of\r\nworship under the protection of the British flag.\r\n\r\nBritish subjects were to enjoy the right to pass through or reside\r\nin any part of the Sultan’s dominions. They were to have the\r\nright of hiring houses and to claim the assistance of the Moorish\r\nauthorities in so doing. They were to be exempt from all taxes or\r\nimpositions whatever; from all military service by land or sea, from\r\nforced loans and from all forced contributions. Their dwellings were\r\nto be respected, no arbitrary searches or examination of books and\r\npapers were to be permitted, except with the consent of the Consul\r\nor Consul-General.\r\n\r\nAll criminal causes and all civil differences between British\r\nsubjects were to be decided by the Consul without any interference\r\non the part of the Moorish authorities. In cases between a Moor and\r\na British subject, the matter was to be referred to the authorities\r\nof the country to which the defendant belonged; if a Moor, the trial\r\nwas to take place before the Kadi, the British Consul being present;\r\nif a British subject, before the Consul, the Governor or Kadi being\r\npresent. The Consul-General and the Moorish Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs were constituted judges in the last resort—as a Court\r\nof Appeal.\r\n\r\nProvision was also made in case of war between the two Powers for\r\nthe security and protection of the interests of their subjects.\r\n\r\nThe commercial advantages gained were, amongst others, the abolition\r\nof monopolies—hitherto a crying evil—on most articles of trade,\r\nand the right to export, under fixed and more reasonable duties,\r\nmost of the products of the Empire. The Sultan, however, reserved\r\nthe right to grant or withdraw permission to export grain.\r\n\r\nBy an article in the new Treaty, the Sultan was also bound to repress\r\nand punish piracy, and to aid Her Majesty’s Government in their\r\nefforts to do the same.\r\n\r\nThis convention was hailed with much satisfaction by British\r\nmerchants, and was eventually adopted by all other nations. Mr. Hay\r\nreceived, in July 1857, a deputation from the Gibraltar Chamber of\r\nCommerce, who expressed their gratitude for his ‘unwearied efforts\r\non behalf of trade, and for the prompt and courteous manner in which\r\nhe invariably treated any representations made by that body.’\r\n\r\nThe Queen was pleased to make Mr. Hay a C.B. on the conclusion of\r\nhis labours in connexion with this Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                             BENABU. 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December 1857, Mr. Hay writes to his sister-in-law:—\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Benabu has been arrested at Fas by the Sultan and imprisoned. All\r\nhis property has been confiscated except the house in which he\r\nlived. The property and jewels of his wives have not yet been touched.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of everybody the Sultan has appointed, in Benabu’s\r\nplace as Basha, the youngest son of the former governor of Tangier,\r\nAlarbi el Saidi. He was a bookbinder and very poor, but no sooner\r\ndid he get the Sultan’s letter, than he assumed the reins of power\r\nwell, and with the dignity of a grandee. We are already good friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of Benabu, whose sudden downfall is here alluded to,\r\ndeserves, we think, to be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Basha of Tangier, Kaid Mohammed Ben Abdelmalek, better known\r\nas ‘Benabu’ (_Anglice_, the son of his father), was Governor of\r\nthat province in the year 1857. He had previously held the post of\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Sultan’s Cavalry, was distinguished for\r\nbravery when His Sherifian Majesty, whom, it is believed, ‘Allah\r\nprotects,’ marched annually against rebellious tribes ‘to eat\r\nthem up,’ an expression very significative of a Moorish monarch’s\r\nplan of campaign.\r\n\r\nBenabu had also been for many years Governor-General of the\r\nRif Provinces. He was a Rifian by extraction, as are most of the\r\ninhabitants of Tangier. One of his ancestors, in the time of Charles\r\nII, when the English were in possession of Tangier, commanded an army\r\nsent to invade that place. In a sanguinary conflict which took place\r\nbetween the Moors and the English, when the latter stormed the heights\r\nwhere the Moorish forces had encamped above the river of Bubána,\r\nabout two miles from Tangier, Benabu’s ancestor was killed.\r\n\r\nThe site is called to this day the ‘Mujáhidin,’ or ‘Warriors\r\nof the Faith.’ It is considered holy ground, as those who fell in\r\nthat battle against ‘Infidels,’ were buried on the spot. Kubbas,\r\nor cupola-formed mausoleums, were erected, in which the bodies of\r\nthe Moorish chieftains were laid. A regiment of our Foot-guards took\r\npart in the action, and it is said that the member of the Guards’\r\nband who plays the cymbals used to wear an Oriental costume, in\r\ncommemoration of this battle.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bulwer was sent to Tangier on a Mission by the British and\r\nSpanish Governments, to settle the differences between Spain and\r\nMorocco, in 1845, I gave him a long rapier which I had found at low\r\nwater in the ruins of the fine old mole which the English blew up,\r\nfrom a dog-in-the-manger policy, when they gave up the place. The\r\nhilt had on one side a C. on the other a rose. Though it had lain for\r\nnearly three centuries in salt water, I managed to restore the weapon,\r\nwhich proved to be of beautiful steel, and before I introduced the\r\nlance for pig sticking, I had at full gallop killed boar with this\r\nrapier on the plains of ‘Awara.’\r\n\r\nOne night I had donned my dressing-gown and was about to go to bed. It\r\nwas late; lights had been extinguished and the servants had retired,\r\nwhen the porter at the gate of the Legation, a Moorish soldier,\r\nlantern in hand, appeared. He was trembling with excitement and\r\ncould hardly articulate as he addressed me. ‘The Basha is here,\r\nalone in the porch. He came on foot and is without an attendant. He\r\nwishes to see you at once. He has commanded that “I shut my tongue\r\nwithin my teeth.”’\r\n\r\nI received the Basha, who was an old friend, in my dressing-gown. He\r\nwas about six feet three in height, and of a Herculean frame. His\r\nfeatures were very marked; a prominent Roman nose and massive jaw,\r\nwith eyes like a lion; shaggy locks hung beneath his turban over\r\neach ear. The general expression of his countenance was that of\r\na stern tyrant, but in conversation with those he liked, his face\r\nbeamed with good humour, and he had a pleasant, kind manner.\r\n\r\nBenabu was very intelligent, and not a fanatic, as Moorish grandees\r\ngenerally are. After friendly salutations, and bidding him welcome,\r\nI inquired the cause of his visit at such an unusual hour.\r\n\r\nThe Basha, having looked around repeatedly, to satisfy himself that\r\nthere were no eavesdroppers, said, ‘I come to you as the only\r\nfriend I can trust, to beg a great favour. This evening an officer\r\narrived with a letter from the Sultan, summoning me to the Sherifian\r\nCourt. I leave to-morrow at daybreak. You know,’ he continued,\r\n‘what this means—either it is to extend my government to the\r\ndistrict of Anjera, which I have applied for, or it is to place me\r\nunder arrest, and then, by long imprisonment, or even the bastinado,\r\nto extort, under the pretext of arrears of taxes or other dues, the\r\nlittle wealth I have accumulated during my long and arduous services,\r\nboth in campaigns and as Governor of the Rif. I am an old soldier, and\r\nit is my firm intention, even if I were put into the wooden jelab[31]\r\nor other torture, not to give one ‘fels’ either to the Sultan,\r\nthe Uzir, or other rapacious satellites of the Court, who, no doubt,\r\nexpect to fleece me as they do other Bashas and Sheikhs, even if it\r\nis the Sultan’s will that I am to receive some mark of his goodwill.\r\n\r\n‘The favour I have to beg of you,’ continued Benabu, ‘is that\r\nyou allow me to leave in your possession some bags of gold I have\r\nbrought with me.’\r\n\r\nI looked at the Basha; he had nothing in his hands, but, beneath the\r\nample folds of his ‘sulham,’ I observed that his huge chest and\r\nbody were distended to an extraordinary size.\r\n\r\n‘I am very sorry,’ I replied, ‘to hear of the sudden summons\r\nto the Court, which, I fear, bodes no good. I shall be happy, as an\r\nold friend, to do anything to help you; but,’ I added, ‘it will\r\nbe a delicate matter for me, as British Representative, to receive\r\nin deposit a large sum of money, which might hereafter be claimed\r\nas arrears of taxes due to the Treasury, and the British Government\r\nmight disapprove of my having placed myself in a false position.’\r\n\r\nBenabu replied that he had paid up all arrears of taxes; that the\r\nmoney he wished to leave with me was not only savings effected\r\nduring a long career of forty years, but money inherited from his\r\nfather. He added, ‘I have also other money, which I secretly placed\r\nsome time ago, for safety and profit, in the hands of a wealthy Jew,\r\nwho is under foreign protection.’\r\n\r\nBenabu reminded me, that when war broke out between Spain and Morocco\r\nI had allowed the Moorish Minister for Foreign Affairs—Sid Mohammed\r\nKhatíb—to deposit about £10,000 in my hands, and he pleaded so\r\nearnestly that I gave way.\r\n\r\nTaking the key of a cellar where I kept a stock of wine, and which my\r\nbutler never visited unless I accompanied him, I led the Basha to it.\r\n\r\n‘Can no one hear or observe us?’ asked the Basha, as we descended\r\ninto the cellar. I replied that the servants were all in bed, and\r\nthat the porter at the gate could not intrude, as I had locked the\r\nfront door of the Legation.\r\n\r\nBag after bag was extracted from Benabu’s portly person, and\r\ndeposited in an empty bin, which I selected for that purpose.\r\n\r\nI observed to the Basha that the bags were not sealed, being merely\r\ntied with string, and offered to fetch sealing-wax, requesting him\r\nto mark on each bag its contents.\r\n\r\nHe declined, saying he really did not know the amount of money each\r\nbag contained; and had neither time nor inclination to count the\r\ncoin, but added, ‘it is all good, and safer in your hands than\r\nin a bank.’ By laying some laths on the top of the pile, and then\r\nbottles of wine, the treasure was well concealed.\r\n\r\nOn returning to my study, I took up a sheet of paper and pen, and told\r\nthe Basha I was about to prepare a receipt, stating that a number of\r\nbags without seal, contents unknown, had been deposited by him in my\r\ncellar, and that I was not responsible for losses occasioned by fire,\r\nrobbery, &c. ‘Do you think,’ said the Basha, ‘I am “hamak”\r\n[mad] to take such a receipt? Don’t you understand that, going as\r\nI am to the Court, I may be searched? If I leave such a document\r\nwith my wife—no woman can hold her tongue—the secret would be\r\nbetrayed. My sons are spendthrifts, and not to be depended on.’ I\r\nsuggested that he should take my receipt and hide it in his house,\r\nor bury it in his garden until his return from the Court.\r\n\r\nHe declined, saying, ‘Walls have ears, trees have eyes, so not\r\nonly must I decline to take a receipt, but I beg that you will keep\r\nno record of having received these bags from me.’ I remonstrated,\r\nsaying, ‘I may die; my heirs will find the money in the cellar and\r\nwill rightfully appropriate it, even if you or your heirs were to\r\nclaim the money, for there will be no proof that you are the rightful\r\nowner. You also,’ I added, ‘are in the hands of “Allah,”\r\nand may die.’ Benabu replied, ‘We are all in the hands of\r\n“Allah.” What is written[32] by the Almighty is written. I have\r\nentire confidence in you, and if you die, as you say might happen,\r\nand your son and daughters, whom I know and love as my own, got\r\npossession of the money—it could not fall into better hands.’\r\n\r\nHe then took leave, and wishing him ‘God speed,’ I let him\r\nout by the garden-door. Summoning the porter, I told him the Basha\r\nwas leaving for the Court in the morning, and had come to announce\r\nhis departure; I warned him not to let any one hear of the visit,\r\nas it might give offence to other Representatives, upon whom he had\r\nnot time to call to take leave. ‘Remember,’ I said, ‘you are\r\na soldier of the Basha, and if you betray his visit he may some day\r\nmark his displeasure.’\r\n\r\nBenabu departed for the Court the following morning, leaving his\r\nelder son, who had been his Khalífa, or Lieutenant-Governor, in\r\ncharge of the government of the province.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Benabu at the Court, he was summoned by the Uzir,\r\nwho informed him that the Sultan was dissatisfied with the accounts\r\nrendered by him of receipts of taxes and dues during his government\r\nboth of the Tangier and Rif provinces; that a house had been allotted\r\nto him, where he was to reside, and consider himself under arrest\r\nuntil more regular accounts were presented. Benabu replied that the\r\nUzir knew the Rifians never paid tithes upon land or agriculture; that\r\nhe had transmitted regularly to the Court the presents of mules and\r\nother gifts which the Rif population had delivered to him, as their\r\ncustomary annual tribute to the Sultan, as ‘Prince of Believers\r\nand Allah’s kaliph;’ that as to the Tangier province, he had\r\npresented annually an account of receipts of taxes, and other dues;\r\nthat the receipts had greatly diminished on account of irregular\r\nprotection being extended by Foreign Ministers and Consuls to rich\r\nfarmers, and to the peasantry in general, and that all protected\r\npersons were held by the Foreign Representatives to be exempted from\r\nthe payment of taxes or other contributions to the Government.\r\n\r\nGuarded by the Uzir’s kavasses, Benabu was taken to the small\r\nhouse that had been prepared for his confinement. He was allowed\r\nto retain one of his followers; the bodyguard he had brought from\r\nTangier was dismissed, and ordered to return.\r\n\r\nMonths passed, Benabu remained under arrest; his son, the Khalífa\r\nat Tangier, died. This misfortune, and the harsh treatment he\r\nhad received as an old and loyal servant of the Sultan, preyed on\r\nhis mind. Prostrated by an ague, followed by typhus fever, Benabu\r\npetitioned the Sultan to be allowed to send for his younger son\r\nFatmeh. This was granted, and Fatmeh arrived a few days before his\r\nfather’s death.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Fatmeh to Tangier, I waited some days expecting\r\nhim to call and claim the money left in my possession; but he did\r\nnot appear, so I sent for him.\r\n\r\nAfter expressions of condolence about the death of his father,\r\nI inquired whether he had found him still sensible on his arrival\r\nat the Court, and whether his father had given him any message for\r\nme. He said he had found his father in a dying state, but perfectly\r\nsensible, and that he was able to give him full directions about his\r\nproperty: that he had spoken of me and had used the words—‘God’s\r\nblessing be on his head, he has been a true friend to me and to the\r\nMohammedans!’ ‘Did he not mention,’ I asked, ‘that he had\r\nseen me the night before he left Tangier and had placed money in\r\nmy hands? Did he not mention also that he had left property in the\r\nhands of a Jewish friend?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘a large sum with ———, which I have\r\nhad the greatest difficulty in recovering, though my mother had a\r\nreceipt. Two thousand dollars were paid by my family to recover the\r\nmoney left in the Jew’s hands.’\r\n\r\n‘Did your father not tell you,’ I repeated, ‘that I had also\r\nreceived a deposit in money for which, as requested, I did not give a\r\nreceipt?’ On Fatmeh replying in the negative, I told him to return\r\nto his mother and ask her whether her late husband had ever mentioned\r\nhis intention of secretly depositing money in my hands; adding,\r\n‘Come back, unattended, to the Legation at midnight, and without\r\nknocking enter at the garden door, which you will find open.’\r\n\r\nAt midnight Fatmeh returned. I awaited him. He informed me that his\r\nmother had never heard or supposed that any money had been deposited\r\nwith me. We then descended into the cellar and, pointing to the bin\r\nwhere the bags lay, I told him to remove the bottles and laths.\r\n\r\n‘These bags,’ I said, ‘contain coin left me by your father,\r\nwho refused to accept a receipt. They now belong to his heirs. I\r\nknow not the amount, but wish you to open each bag before you leave,\r\nand to bring me to-morrow some proof that you have delivered the\r\nmoney to your mother.’\r\n\r\nFatmeh took down a bag, and opening it, exclaimed in a very excited\r\nmanner, ‘Gold!’ Each bag was opened with the same exclamation, his\r\nexcitement increasing. Having finished the examination of the bags, I\r\ntold him to put them as his father had done, in the ample folds of his\r\ndress, above the girdle. ‘All?’ he said. I replied ‘all.’ He\r\nhesitated, and then turning to me, observed: ‘Shall I not leave you\r\nhalf?’ ‘You are “hamák,”’ (mad) I replied. ‘Don’t you\r\nunderstand, that if I had wanted this money I might have kept all?’\r\n\r\nSo he interned bag after bag in the ample folds of his dress until\r\nthey could hold no more, for he was a smaller man than his father.\r\n\r\nThree bags remained, which he said he could not possibly carry in\r\nhis dress, and begged that I would keep them. I replied angrily,\r\nand fetching a basket, put the remaining bags into it, and, bidding\r\nhim ‘Good-night,’ I passed him through the garden gate.\r\n\r\nNext day I received, through a mutual Mohammedan friend in the\r\nconfidence of the family, a message from Benabu’s widow, to say\r\nher son[33] had delivered to her all that he had received from me.\r\n\r\nA week passed, and Fatmeh again asked me for an interview. He informed\r\nme he had come with a message from his mother and sister to reiterate\r\ntheir thanks, and to beg that I would not refuse to accept, as a\r\ntoken of their gratitude, a Spanish ‘three-decker,’ of which\r\nFatmeh gave the following history.\r\n\r\n‘In the last great naval war between Spain and England, my\r\ngreat-grandfather was Basha of Tangier. He was on the most intimate\r\nterms of friendship with the Spanish Representative, and was a strong\r\npartisan of Spain and unfriendly towards the English. Having granted\r\nto the Spanish Representative some special privilege unauthorised by\r\nthe Sultan, his intrigues and proceedings came to the knowledge of\r\nHis Sherifian Majesty. An officer and an executioner were dispatched\r\nforthwith to Tangier: my ancestor was decapitated, and his head\r\nwas placed by special order of the Sultan over the gateway of the\r\nresidence of the Spanish Representative.\r\n\r\n‘Amongst other gifts which had been presented to my ancestor by\r\nthe Spanish Government was the model of a Spanish three-decker, in\r\na glass case, about four feet long. It was much prized by my late\r\nfather, and my mother and our family beg you to accept it.’\r\n\r\nI accepted the gift of the line-of-battle ship. It was a curious\r\nold model, very complete, with figures of sailors in the rigging,\r\nand Spanish flag flying.\r\n\r\nThis model may have been of the ‘Santissima Trinidad,’ one\r\nof the largest three-deckers sunk by the English at the battle\r\nof Trafalgar. Her masts were washed ashore on the Moorish coast\r\nnot far from Cape Spartel, were taken possession of by the Moorish\r\nauthorities and floated down to the mouth of the river Wad el Halk,\r\nwhich enters the bay near the site called ‘old Tangier[34],’\r\nan arsenal built by the Romans wherein to lay up their galleys. The\r\nmasts were floated as far as the village of Sharf, and placed across\r\nthe high banks of the river; parapets of masonry were built on each\r\nside to form a bridge for horse and foot-passengers.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was still in use twenty years ago, and I have often crossed\r\nit; but one of the masts having given way, it was taken down by order\r\nof the Sultan, and a Portuguese architect was employed to erect a\r\nstone bridge in its place. The Portuguese had nearly completed the\r\nwork, when a freshet from the hills levelled it to the water’s\r\nedge, hardly leaving a vestige of the fabric. The Moors declared the\r\nbridge was accursed by Allah, as the Sultan had employed an Infidel\r\n‘Nazarene’ instead of a Mohammedan architect. A Moor was then\r\ndispatched from Fas by the Sultan to rebuild the bridge, which he\r\nexecuted in a satisfactory manner on three arches and sluices.\r\n\r\nAn aged Tangerine, some twenty years ago, told me that he and\r\nmany other Moors witnessed from the heights of the hills near\r\nCape Spartel[35] the great battle, and that their hearts were with\r\nthe English. He said the firing was terrific, with an occasional\r\nexplosion. Wreckage and many bodies were cast upon the African shore.\r\n\r\nBenabu was the best Governor I have known during the forty years I\r\nwas at Tangier. Under his iron but just rule, murder, robbery, and\r\neven theft became unknown after the first year of his government. He\r\nmade terrible examples of all criminals.\r\n\r\nCattle-lifting was, and still is, a common practice throughout\r\nMorocco. On his first appointment as Basha he sent the public crier,\r\non a market-day when the mountaineers and peasantry flock in to make\r\ntheir purchases, to proclaim that the severest punishment would be\r\ninflicted on robbers or other criminals.\r\n\r\nHe kept his word, for the next market-day two cattle-lifters, caught\r\nred-handed, were brought before him. After hearing the evidence,\r\nthey were severely bastinadoed. Benabu had caused an iron brand to\r\nbe prepared with the letter س (‘sin’), the first of the word\r\n‘sarak’ meaning robber. On the forehead, just above and between\r\nthe eyebrows, these robbers were marked with the hot brand.\r\n\r\nTheir property was seized and confiscated, and after issuing a fresh\r\nproclamation that any criminal who had been branded, would, on a\r\nsecond conviction of crime, have his hand or foot or both amputated,\r\naccording to circumstances, Benabu liberated the robbers, and reported\r\nhis proceedings to the Sultan, making known to H.S.M. that he had\r\nfound on his appointment murders, robberies, and crime of all kinds\r\nprevailed, and that there was no security for life or property outside\r\nthe walls of Tangier, and he requested the Sultan’s authority to\r\ncut off the hand or foot of any person branded with the ‘Sin,’\r\nwho was again convicted of a murder or robbery with violence.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan approved of his conduct, and complied with the request.\r\n\r\nSix months after the branding of the two robbers, one of them was\r\ncaught, having robbed some cattle and wounded the herd in charge.\r\n\r\nThe delinquent, stripped to the waist, was mounted on the back\r\nof a donkey. The animal was led through the principal streets and\r\nmarket-place; two soldiers followed with the bastinado, which is a\r\nrope of twisted leather about four feet long. The lash was applied\r\nevery twenty paces to the back of the prisoner, who was compelled\r\nto proclaim his crimes in a loud voice. He was then taken off the\r\ndonkey in the middle of the market-place, where a fire was lit,\r\nand on it an earthen pot stood filled with boiling pitch.\r\n\r\nA butcher, the first the soldiers could lay hands on, was seized,\r\nand ordered to sever a right hand and left foot.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate butcher remonstrated in vain. The condemned man was\r\nlaid on the ground, his hands were untied; the right hand was taken\r\noff at the joint, and the stump plunged into the pot of pitch to\r\nstop hemorrhage and prevent gangrene.\r\n\r\nThe left foot was amputated in the same manner. Charitable\r\nbystanders carried off the victim to a small house in the town\r\ncalled ‘Morstan[36],’ where paupers seek shelter at night. There\r\nhe was provided with food and water for some months. He recovered,\r\nand could be seen crawling about the streets or sitting at the gate\r\nof the town, begging[37].\r\n\r\nMurder, robbery, and cattle-lifting ceased throughout the Tangier\r\nprovince. Life and property were safe. Thus this cruel and barbarous\r\nmutilation of one ruffian saved hundreds of innocent men from murder,\r\nand women and helpless Jews from outrage.\r\n\r\nOn a shooting excursion to a district about eight miles from Tangier,\r\nI found in a sheltered spot about forty beehives[38]. There was no\r\nvillage within a mile of the hives, and there was no hut even for a\r\nguard. Passing a cowherd attending some oxen, not far from the hives,\r\nI inquired to whom they belonged. He said they were the property of\r\nthe village of Zinats. I asked whether there was no guard to watch\r\nthe property, which could easily be carried off at night. Pointing\r\ntowards Tangier, he exclaimed, ‘Benabu.’\r\n\r\nThere was a very beautiful young Mohammedan widow at Tangier, who led\r\na dissolute life. Fatmeh, the Basha’s son, was a constant visitor\r\nat her house. Benabu had repeatedly warned his son to discontinue\r\nhis visits. He summoned also the widow; and after censuring her\r\nmisconduct, he told her that if she again admitted his son into her\r\nhouse he would mar her beauty, which was the cause of his son’s\r\ndisgraceful conduct.\r\n\r\nSome weeks afterwards, Benabu was informed that Fatmeh had again\r\nvisited the house of the widow. He was arrested and imprisoned,\r\nand the widow was brought before the Basha.\r\n\r\n‘You have not,’ said the Basha, ‘kept your promise to me,\r\nor taken heed of my warning. Your beauty has brought disgrace upon\r\nmy son and myself.’\r\n\r\nTurning to the guards who attended in the ‘Meshwa,’ or Hall of\r\nJudgment, he said, ‘Bring a barber.’\r\n\r\nThe barber was brought.\r\n\r\n‘Cut off,’ said Benabu, ‘below the cartilage, the tip of this\r\nwoman’s nose.’\r\n\r\nThe barber, trembling, begged that the operation might not be\r\nperformed by him. ‘It shall be as you wish,’ replied the Basha;\r\n‘but then your nose will be taken off for disobedience.’ The\r\nbarber obeyed, and the tip of the nose of the pretty widow was cut\r\noff. ‘Go,’ said the Basha to her; ‘you will now be able to\r\nlead a better life. May Allah forgive you, as I do, your past sins!’\r\n\r\nWhen Benabu, as a young man, was Kaid in command of a body of cavalry,\r\nhe received orders from the Sultan to escort with his troopers a\r\nforeign Envoy to the Court at Marákesh. During the journey to the\r\ncapital, the camp had been pitched in the neighbourhood of a large\r\nvillage, where a ‘Marábet’ or holy man dwelt, who was looked\r\nup to with great veneration by the villagers.\r\n\r\nThis fanatic, having observed the Envoy seated in his tent with a\r\nlight, and the door of the tent open, fetched his long gun, squatted\r\ndown at about fifty yards, and took a pot shot at the ‘Nazarene\r\nInfidel.’ He missed the Envoy, but the ball, passing through the\r\ntent, killed a horse of one of the escort on the other side.\r\n\r\nBenabu, hearing a shot, rushed out of his tent, and seeing a strange\r\nman making off, had him arrested and brought before the tent of\r\nthe Envoy.\r\n\r\n‘This assassin,’ Benabu said, ‘who calls himself a Marábet,\r\nhas attempted to take your life, and thus placed in jeopardy my head;\r\nfor had he killed you, the Sultan would have beheaded me.’\r\n\r\nBenabu then drew his sword, and, ordering the guards to bare the\r\nMarábet’s neck and shoulders, turned to the Envoy and said:\r\n‘My lord the Sultan, whose life may Allah prolong, has alone the\r\npower of life and death; but I am ordered to protect your life at\r\nall hazards through this country as the Representative of a great\r\nfriendly Power; and therefore, to deter others, I am determined\r\nto make an example of this villain who has attempted to take your\r\nlife.’ Then, raising his sword, he added, ‘Give the signal,\r\nand the head of this assassin shall fall at your feet.’\r\n\r\nThe Envoy requested Benabu to sheathe his sword, saying that he\r\nbelieved the man to be mad. Benabu, who, no doubt, felt persuaded\r\nthat the Envoy would never give the signal for the execution of the\r\nman, put his sword in the scabbard; the man was then bastinadoed\r\nand sent off early next morning to the Governor of the district,\r\nwith a request that he should be confined in a dungeon until the\r\nSultan’s decision was learnt.\r\n\r\nBenabu demanded also that a good horse, with new saddle and bridle,\r\nshould be sent by the Governor at once for the soldier of the escort\r\nwhose horse had been shot; this was done.\r\n\r\nThe name of Benabu went forth far and wide, and the Sultan, on\r\nthe arrival of the Mission, promoted Benabu to the rank of Kaid\r\n‘Erha.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                 MR. HAY’S POSITION AT TANGIER. 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nAffairs were in a critical state in 1858, and Mr. Hay, who had\r\napplied for leave of absence, which was granted only to be immediately\r\ncancelled, writes to his wife on May 12:—\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly fancy what a shell has burst on me, scattering all my plans,\r\nespecially as last week I received my four months leave in full\r\nform! The fact is that affairs in Europe are in such a state that\r\nGovernment wishes every man, I suppose, to be at his post, ready to\r\ndo his best in the moment of danger. Morocco is ticklish ground, and\r\nit is here we might be exposed to a movement on the part of France,\r\nwhich might prove a severe check to us in our naval preponderance\r\nin the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a similar strain he writes again on his birthday:—\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I am, again, all alone on the 1st of June. I miss you and the\r\nchildren more than ever; but I know there are yearning hearts and\r\nthoughts for me on this day, and that I am not forgotten.\r\n\r\nBy way of _amusing_ me, I have just received from Government a\r\ndispatch telling me to report upon a bundle of false allegations made\r\nagainst me by two discontented merchants of Mogador. I am put out,\r\nand yet pleased, at having an opportunity to let Lord Malmesbury know\r\nwhat I have done, in contradiction of what these folk accuse me of\r\nnot having done. I hear also of a virulent article, or letter, which\r\nhas appeared in the _Daily News_ against me. The Gibraltar merchants\r\nare very angry at the attack upon me, and I daresay they will defend\r\nme without my saying a word—at least, I flatter myself they will.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was not mistaken in his hope that his conduct would find defenders\r\nat Gibraltar. Three weeks later he writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I have told you I received a very handsome letter from the\r\nGibraltar merchants, quoting a resolution, dated June 1, in which,\r\namongst other compliments, they resolved, ‘That this Committee\r\ndesires to express its strong disapproval of the tone in which\r\nthe letter in the _Daily News_ of April 24 is couched—casting\r\nreflections upon Her Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires, Mr. Drummond\r\nHay—and its dissent from the opinions expressed by the writer with\r\nreference to the late Treaty with Morocco. . . . That this Committee\r\ndesires at once to place on record its most grateful appreciation of\r\nMr. Hay’s eminent public services in the protection and support\r\nof British subjects in Morocco, and for his prompt and courteous\r\nattention to the demands and complaints of British subjects.’\r\n\r\nSo you see the abuse of two men calls forth the praise of many others,\r\nand I am the gainer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had the further satisfaction of knowing that the British\r\nGovernment approved of his opinions with regard to Morocco\r\naffairs. ‘Government,’ he says, ‘are carrying out all my\r\nplans. My only fear is, if they attempt to do too much, the whole\r\ncrumbling fabric of Moorish Government will tumble about our\r\nears. Lord Malmesbury is now beginning to approve of all I do.’\r\n\r\nAt this time a mark of the Sultan’s appreciation of Mr. Hay was\r\nshown by a curious gift.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sultan has just sent me a present of a most beautiful\r\nleopard. Fat, sleek, and tame as a cat. He is chained up in the\r\nstable. I shall give him to the Queen, or to the Zoo gardens, which\r\nwill be the same thing. I wish you and the children were here to\r\nsee the beautiful creature.\r\n\r\nI am in high favour, they tell me, with the Sultan, so I get a\r\nleopard. It is like the gift of the white elephant to the unruly\r\nchiefs in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this leopard he tells the following story.\r\n\r\n\r\nSultan Mulai Abderahman, who was very fond of having wild animals\r\nkept loose in the garden or courtyard of his palace, had a beautiful\r\ntame leopard named ‘Maimon’ (the ‘trusty,’) nearly as large\r\nas a Bengal tiger. It was very good-tempered and a great favourite\r\nof His Majesty.\r\n\r\nA young negro slave who swept the entrance of the palace happened\r\none day to find the leopard lying on a heap of dust, so he hit\r\nthe beast with his broom to make it move. This was resented by the\r\nleopard striking the lad on the head with his paw, so that he fell\r\ndead. H.M. on learning what had happened, ordered that the leopard\r\nshould be confined in a cage and sent as a gift to me at Tangier\r\nand that a Jew should be dispatched to take charge of the animal.\r\n\r\nI received a letter from the Uzir, making known the gift His Sherifian\r\nMajesty had been pleased to send me and stating that the animal was\r\ndocile, but dangerous if struck. No mention, however, was made of\r\nthe death of the slave.\r\n\r\nFinding the leopard very good-natured, I dismissed the Jew keeper\r\nand took charge of it myself. In the daytime the leopard was allowed\r\nto run loose in the little garden of the Legation, for my family\r\nwere absent in England; but I had it fastened, when visitors came\r\nto see it, by a long chain to a palm tree in the garden. I fed\r\nthe leopard myself, and he gambolled about like a cat, purring and\r\nrubbing himself against my legs when I caressed him. If I happened\r\non such occasions not to take sufficient notice, he would strike me\r\nheavily with a soft paw.\r\n\r\nOne day the leopard, finding that the door leading from the\r\ndining-room into the garden was open, entered, and passing along a\r\nlobby discovered the laundry, and an old Irishwoman ironing there. On\r\nseeing the beast glaring at her over the table where she was engaged,\r\nshe boldly advanced with a hot iron in hand, with the courage of\r\nher race, exclaiming, ‘Get out ye dhirty baste.’ The leopard,\r\nmuch offended, withdrew with a dignified gait and passed on to a\r\ncourtyard near the kitchen, where a Moorish woman, squatted on a\r\nmat, was sifting flour. With friendly intentions and hoping to be\r\ncaressed, the leopard put his head into the old dame’s bosom,\r\nbut she, thinking this was the preliminary step to being devoured,\r\nswooned dead away.\r\n\r\nA man-servant, passing, saw the leopard and woman in this compromising\r\nposition; but, being afraid to interfere, rushed, pale with alarm,\r\nto the room where I was writing, to announce that the leopard had\r\nkilled ‘Titam,’ and was about to eat her.\r\n\r\nRunning to the rescue, I found ‘Maimon’ covered with flour,\r\npurring and rubbing himself in a loving manner against the reclining\r\nform of poor Titam, who was still in a swoon, but otherwise\r\nuninjured. I told ‘Maimon’ his conduct was most unbecoming, not\r\nto say improper, so he left poor Titam, and bestowed his attentions\r\non me, covering me with flour.\r\n\r\nAt dusk I was in the habit of accompanying the leopard across the\r\nstreet to his cell in the stable-yard. One evening when leading him,\r\nhe lay down in the street and refused to move. In vain I coaxed\r\nthe beast. The road was thus blocked; for those who wished to pass,\r\nviewing a huge leopard crouching loose in the street, hurriedly turned\r\nback. I sent for a piece of meat, and walking with this bribe into\r\nthe stable, the leopard deigned at length to follow me.\r\n\r\nWhen my family was expected, thinking there was a risk that he\r\nmight attack them as strangers, I sent the leopard as a gift to the\r\nZoological Gardens. Eight months afterwards, when I was in London on\r\nleave of absence, I visited the Gardens, and there I saw ‘Maimon’\r\nlying in a cage. I requested the keeper to allow me to pass the\r\nbar in front of the cage to pat the leopard. He replied it was not\r\npermitted; but, on telling him I was the donor, he allowed me to\r\ncross the barrier, warning me, however, that though the animal was\r\ndocile, it showed sometimes a surly temper. I approached the cage\r\nwhere the leopard was lying listless in a corner; ‘Ya Maimon,\r\nya habibi, busni.’ ‘Oh, beloved Maimon,’ I cried in Arabic,\r\n‘come and embrace me.’ The animal sprang up and came to the side\r\nof the cage, and no doubt would have embraced me if the bars had not\r\nstopped him. I put in my hand and stroked his back, whilst he rubbed\r\nagainst the bars of the cage, making a low purring noise. Then I\r\nscratched his head, when to my horror he suddenly took my hand in\r\nhis mouth; but the friendly beast only mumbled, without hurting it,\r\nand then let my hand go. A crowd had collected outside to witness the\r\nexhibition, so I thought it was time to leave, though I might have\r\ngone round with my hat to beg alms for the prisoner. As I left the\r\ncage, the leopard watched me with eager eyes, and when some way off I\r\nturned to look again, the beast was standing up with his paws on an\r\nupper bar, his bright eyes fixed anxiously upon me. During my long\r\nlife loving eyes have often watched my departure, but none brighter\r\nor more anxious than those of my four-footed friend. So we parted,\r\nnever to meet again, for the leopard was dead when I revisited the\r\nZoological Gardens, after a two years’ absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs another instance of this Sultan’s fondness for wild animals\r\nMr. Hay told the following story.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Horse at the Moorish Court related to me, that\r\nSultan Mulai Abderahman happened one day to pass through the Court\r\nof the palace, mounted on a magnificent white charger, when a lion\r\nwhich H.M. was accustomed to stop and caress, sprang up the side of\r\nhis horse and placed its paws on the knee of the Sultan. H.M. reined\r\nin his steed, which snorted and reared. The Sultan showed no alarm\r\nand did not, said the Master of the Horse, change a muscle of his\r\ncountenance, but turning to the Kaid-el-Meshwa, or Chief Officer of\r\nthe Court, and putting his hand on the head of the lion to stroke it,\r\ninquired ‘How many pounds of meat are given to the lion daily?’\r\nThe officer stated the quantity.\r\n\r\n‘Let the lion have ten more pounds,’ said His Majesty. The\r\nlion’s petition being granted, it quietly dropped off H.M.’s\r\nhorse and lay down quite pacified.\r\n\r\n‘These animals,’ observed the Master of the Horse, ‘understand\r\nwhat is spoken, though they have not the power of speech to tell\r\nwhat they want.’\r\n\r\n‘Mashallah!’ I gravely replied.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany interesting and distinguished persons visited Tangier during\r\nMr. Hay’s long residence there. Amongst these may be mentioned,\r\nin 1858, three Royal guests—the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred\r\nand the late Duc d’Orléans. In favour of the Prince of Wales\r\nan extraordinary exception was made, and he was admitted to the\r\nBasha’s house and there received by the ladies.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, Duc d’Orléans, was accompanied by his tutor. After\r\nintroducing H.R.H. to the sights of Tangier, Mr. Hay arranged\r\na boar hunt for him on the Hill. The sport was good; but the\r\nobject of the hunt was unsuccessful, as the Prince never fired a\r\nshot—principally through the mistaken zeal of one of his suite,\r\nwho, on seeing a pig coming in the direction of the Royal guest,\r\nstepped forward and removing his hat exclaimed ‘Mon Prince, voilà\r\nle sanglier!’—with the natural result that the pig turned and\r\nbroke back!\r\n\r\nRiding down the rough mountain path afterwards, with Mr. Hay leading\r\nthe way, the Prince, who was mounted on Mr. Hay’s best pony, soon\r\noutstripped with his guide the rest of the party, Mr. Hay’s horses\r\nbeing always selected as good walkers. Commenting on the roughness\r\nof the track, the Prince was somewhat astonished to hear Mr. Hay\r\nsay that he frequently, when out late, cantered down the hills,\r\nand H.R.H. inquired eagerly whether the pony he was riding could\r\nbe trusted to go fast down the broken road, and if so would Mr. Hay\r\ngallop down _now_ with him?\r\n\r\nMr. Hay, after a little demur (aware that the sure-footed little Barb,\r\nwho had often performed the feat, could be trusted), consented:\r\nand leading the way, he and the young Prince tore madly down the\r\nsteep rough path, to the great enjoyment of the latter—though\r\nrather to the bewilderment of his worthy tutor, who did not catch\r\nsight of his pupil again till they met in the town an hour later.\r\n\r\nAfterwards in a letter to Mr. Hay—the Duc d’Orléans, alluding to\r\nan accident which had lately happened to him while hunting, wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\nJe ne montais pas alors le fameux petit cheval gris, sur lequel\r\nje suis revenu de la chasse avec vous si bon train sans que jamais\r\nil bronchât!\r\n\r\nLes souvenirs de Tanger, de cette chasse que vous m’avez fait\r\nfaire avec les chasseurs à demi-sauvages de la montagne, resteront\r\ntoujours le meilleur souvenir de mon voyage, et je n’oublierai pas\r\ntout le soin, tout l’empressement que vous avez mis à me faire\r\nconnaître un pays si nouveau, si curieux pour moi.\r\n\r\nC’est à vous que je dois d’avoir pu profiter comme je l’ai\r\nfait du peu de jours que j’y ai passés, et toutes les fois que\r\nje veux faire un rêve agréable, je me figure prêt à repartir\r\npour le Maroc. . . .\r\n\r\nLes événements actuels de l’Europe seraient bien de nature\r\nà m’y pousser si les voyages ne m’étaient impossibles\r\nà un pareil moment, car, lorsqu’on voit à quoi les nations\r\ncivilisées se laissent entraîner, on est bien tenté d’aller\r\noublier l’Europe chez des sauvages, au milieu desquels on sent du\r\nmoins la supériorité de notre civilisation sans en voir les maux.\r\n\r\nJe vous demande pardon, Monsieur, de vous avoir écrit une lettre\r\naussi longue, mais, du moment que je pouvais écrire, je ne voulais\r\npas me refuser le plaisir de vous dire toute ma reconnaissance pour\r\nle charmant accueil que vous m’avez fait. En attendant que je\r\npuisse le faire de vive voix, croyez-moi toujours, je vous prie,\r\n\r\n                        Votre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\n                                             LOUIS PHILIPPE D’ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                    THE WAR WITH SPAIN. 1859-1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1859, Mr. Hay returned from leave to find that Sultan\r\nMulai Abderahman had just died, and that troubles were brewing on\r\nthe French frontier. With Spain also difficulties had arisen and,\r\nfor months past, the Spanish Government had been preparing for\r\nan expedition against Morocco. The ostensible motive which was put\r\nforward for these hostilities was the chastisement of the Rif pirates\r\nand the redress of insults received at Ceuta. But public opinion in\r\nEngland inclined to believe that, under cover of reprisals for past\r\nwrongs, schemes of European aggrandisement upon the coast opposite\r\nGibraltar were to be carried out by simultaneous action on the part\r\nof France and Spain against Morocco.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, then at the head of Foreign Affairs, raised no\r\nobjection to the temporary occupation of Tangier by the Spaniards;\r\nand Spain, who had steadily refused all offers of English mediation,\r\nonly replied to repeated concessions on the part of the Moors with\r\nfresh and more exorbitant demands. At length, early in October, 1859,\r\nthe Spanish Chargé d’Affaires sent secretly to beg Mr. Hay to\r\npersuade the Moorish Government to give way yet once more, at the same\r\ntime solemnly assuring him that, if this demand were accepted, peace\r\nwould be made. Mr. Hay spent six hours with the Moorish Minister,\r\nupon whom he brought to bear every possible argument, and terrified\r\nhim by the prospect of the dire displeasure of the Sultan in case\r\nof a refusal. The Minister accepted the ultimatum and fell into a\r\nfainting fit!\r\n\r\nFour days later, on October 15, a third ultimatum was presented,\r\ninvolving the cession of further territory. Mr. Hay then withdrew from\r\nfurther mediation, and war was declared between Spain and Morocco.\r\n\r\nMany years after, Mr. (then Sir John) Hay was called on by the\r\nsubordinate official who had brought him the secret message from\r\nthe Spanish Chargé d’Affaires. Sir John recalled the incident,\r\nand then for the first time heard an explanation of what had appeared\r\nto be an act of bad faith.\r\n\r\nThe ex-official related that the third ultimatum was brought by a\r\nSpanish war-ship. On board the vessel was an official, who informed\r\nthe Chargé d’Affaires that _war was determined on_, whatever\r\nmight be the concessions made by the Moors; that the attempt to\r\narrange matters had been a grave mistake, and that now any extravagant\r\nconcession, however absurd, must be demanded as a pretext for war. The\r\nSpanish Chargé d’Affaires told his subordinate how distressed he\r\nwas at thus appearing to deceive his British colleague; but added\r\n‘We must obey orders and keep them secret.’\r\n\r\nWar having been declared, the European population and many of the\r\nJews fled from the coast towns to Europe, rather from fear of the\r\nwild tribes who flocked to the defence of their country, than on\r\naccount of the threatened invasion by Spain.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay stopped his wife and two little girls, who were on their\r\nway from England to join him, at Gibraltar—where they remained\r\nduring the six months that hostilities continued. But he, with the\r\nEnglish portion of his staff, stayed at Tangier. All other Foreign\r\nRepresentatives left.\r\n\r\nWriting at this time to his mother, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nAll is quiet here up to the present moment; thanks to my friends,\r\nthe hunters, having acted as the police of the town, and saved all\r\nChristians from molestation.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed the Sultan will be acknowledged everywhere, but my\r\nsupposition about the French frontier being invaded has turned out\r\ntoo true; all however may be arranged quietly.\r\n\r\nIt is rather from the Spaniards that we have to expect trouble and\r\nferment. They have been playing the fool at Ceuta, and now seek for\r\nsatisfaction, which would humiliate the new Sultan, and then perhaps\r\ncause him, if he concedes, to totter upon his throne before he has\r\neven taken a firm seat thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘My friends the hunters,’ alluded to in this letter, were, it\r\nmay be explained, villagers from outlying hamlets in the Tangier\r\ndistrict. They were strongly attached to Mr. Hay as a brother\r\nsportsman and friend, and are frequently mentioned in his stories and\r\nin his little book on Western Barbary. The bond lasted throughout\r\nhis life, though one generation of hunters passed away during his\r\nlong residence in Morocco.\r\n\r\nWriting again to his wife on November 13, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen and Reade[39] live with me, and are very useful and attentive;\r\nbut I am bored with this bachelor’s life and miss my wife and my\r\ndear children.\r\n\r\nAll well so far.\r\n\r\nGovernment has again approved of all I have done and am doing.\r\n\r\nWhen war begins you will probably see me; but be assured I shall\r\nnot be in Tangier when bombardment takes place. I shall either\r\nbe on board a ship or safe inland amongst my hunters on ‘Mount\r\nWashington[40].’ No imprudence shall I be guilty of, for your\r\nsake. As to the Moors, they are ready to do anything for me. I will\r\nnot trust the Spaniards, nor go amongst the ‘Kabail.’\r\n\r\nSultan’s brother (Mulai Abbas, in command of the troops) and I\r\nare good friends.\r\n\r\nTangier is deserted. Nothing but armed men: not a woman, not a child.\r\n\r\nDifficulty in getting anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made by the Spaniards to remove Mr. Hay from the\r\nscene of action. His conduct was the subject of violent attacks by\r\nthe Spanish Minister, Señor Castelar, and by the Madrid press. It\r\nwas also commented on in a letter in the _Times_ from the Special\r\nCorrespondent of that paper. These attacks were brought before the\r\nHouse of Commons, where Mr. Hay’s conduct was defended by Lord\r\nJohn Russell and Mr. Liddell.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘From Mr. Hay’s long residence in Morocco,’ said Lord John,\r\n‘and his kindness to all who hold any intercourse with him,\r\nhe has gained to a great degree the respect of the people of that\r\ncountry, not only of the Foreign Minister of the Emperor of Morocco,\r\nwho was formerly a merchant, but of the wild tribes of natives who\r\nso frequently made incursions into the Spanish settlements. Having\r\nthis influence, I believe that he, according to instructions from\r\nHer Majesty’s Government, endeavoured to prevent the breaking out\r\nof war between Spain and Morocco. He endeavoured to prevent this war,\r\ntill he was told by the Moorish Minister that, whatever advice might\r\nbe given, Morocco could make no further concessions. Mr. Drummond\r\nHay did exert himself to the utmost, and used the influence he had\r\nso justly acquired to prevent the outbreak of hostilities. Since\r\nthat time, it being the policy of Her Majesty’s Government to\r\nbe neutral in the war, his conduct has been in strict conformity\r\nwith his instructions. The hon. member has read a report from the\r\ncorrespondent of _The Times_ newspaper—a very respectable gentleman,\r\nI believe; but he is in the Spanish camp, and can hear nothing but\r\nwhat he is told by Spaniards. They have stated various matters which\r\nthe correspondent repeats, but he says that he knows nothing of them,\r\nand has no proof of them whatever. I have not heard from Mr. Drummond\r\nHay since he had an opportunity of seeing these statements in the\r\nnewspaper, but I have not a doubt they are, one and all, entirely\r\nfalse. I do not believe that Mr. Drummond Hay has felt it his duty\r\nto take any part in the war. The Spanish Minister did on one occasion\r\nstate to Mr. Buchanan that complaints had been made of the partiality\r\nof Mr. Drummond Hay; but he gave no instance of such partiality,\r\nnor any proof of it whatever. We are aware that the Spanish\r\nGovernment in this war has obtained the aid of British merchants,\r\nand that the Spanish army has been supplied with British stores and\r\nprovisions. Any complaints, therefore, of a violation of neutrality\r\nmight more justly be made by the Government of Morocco than by the\r\nGovernment of Spain. I believe that the conduct of Mr. Drummond Hay\r\nhas been entirely free from blame. I do not wish to say which party\r\nin this war is right; but I cannot sympathise with the enthusiasm\r\nof the hon. gentleman in regard to it. I do not think because one\r\nparty is Christian and the other Mohammedan, we ought to give the\r\nformer all our sympathy, without knowing the causes of the quarrel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole crisis Mr. Hay’s efforts to protect property\r\nwere unremitting, and an instance of his success is here given in\r\nhis own words.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the rupture of relations between Spain and Morocco took place,\r\nand Spanish subjects at Tangier were required by their Government\r\nto leave Morocco, the ‘Padre Superior’ of the Roman Catholic\r\nMission paid me a visit, and informed me he had received orders from\r\nthe Spanish Minister to embark, with all the members of his Mission,\r\nin a vessel sent to convey them to Spain. He added: ‘We are ordered\r\noff in such haste that we have no time to pack and convey to Spain\r\nthe sacred pictures, crucifixes, and other religious emblems adorning\r\nthe chapel.’\r\n\r\n(At that time the only chapel was that adjoining the Spanish\r\nLegation.)\r\n\r\n‘All the Foreign Representatives,’ he continued, ‘the Consular\r\nOfficers, as well as all foreign subjects, both Christians and Jews,\r\nhave begun to depart, and I hear that no one of them, with the\r\nexception of yourself and the gentlemen attached to the British\r\nConsulate, intends to remain in the country, fearing that the\r\nMohammedan population may, when the war commences, massacre the\r\nChristians and Jews and pillage their dwellings.’\r\n\r\nI replied that it was my intention to remain at my post, and that,\r\nas I had never acted unjustly or unkindly towards the Mohammedans,\r\nI had no grounds for supposing that they would seek to injure me;\r\nthough, in pursuance of instructions received from my Government,\r\nmy family would remain at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Padre Superior then said that the object of his visit was to ask\r\nme a great favour—that I would prevent, as far as lay in my power,\r\nthe chapel from being broken into and pillaged.\r\n\r\n‘After all,’ he said, ‘though we may entertain different views\r\nregarding the forms of the Christian religion, _somos hermanos_\r\n(we are brothers).’\r\n\r\nI told the Padre it would afford me sincere satisfaction to be of\r\nservice to him; that I should let the Moorish authorities—and\r\nalso my native friends in the town—know that the Roman Catholic\r\nChapel was a house of God, and that it would be taken under my\r\nspecial protection.\r\n\r\nThe Padre expressed his heartfelt thanks, and, shaking hands warmly,\r\nwe parted.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the war, large bodies of armed men belonging\r\nto the tribes of the provinces of Tangier and El Araish arrived at\r\nthe former town, to buy powder and provisions before proceeding to\r\nthe Ceuta district—the seat of war. Amongst them came a body of\r\nBeni Aros, composed of twelve hundred armed men. They are a fanatical\r\ntribe, many of them being Sherífs, and guardians of the sanctuary\r\nof Mulai Abd Selam. These wild fellows assembled in the little\r\nmarket-place adjoining the Spanish Legation, which was situated about\r\na hundred yards from the British Consulate, and in the same street.\r\n\r\nA Tangier Moor, having overheard some of the chiefs of these Beni\r\nAros, who were purchasing provisions, propose that the tribe should\r\nbreak into and pillage the Spanish Legation and burn the Chapel,\r\nran down to report to my kavasses what they had said. As soon as I\r\nreceived the information, I walked towards the little market-place,\r\naccompanied by one of these kavasses, just in time to meet the\r\ntribe, who had collected in the market-place, and were moving in\r\na body towards the Spanish Chapel with hostile intentions. I was\r\nnot acquainted with any of the Chiefs, but my kavass announced\r\nto them that I was the ‘Naib Ingliz,’ the friend of the Moors,\r\nwho—having confidence in their good-will—had remained in Tangier,\r\nwhen all other Christians had fled.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, friends and warriors of the faith!’ I exclaimed, ‘where\r\nare you going?’\r\n\r\nThey replied, with shouts,\r\n\r\n‘It is our intention to destroy the dwelling of the accursed\r\n“kaffer” (unbeliever), and the Spanish place where they worship\r\nthe devil, and to burn the pictures and idols it contains.’\r\n\r\nI said, ‘Are you not aware that this house of the Spanish\r\nBashador and all it contains, as also this place of worship since\r\nthe declaration of war, is no longer the property of the Spaniards,\r\nbut belongs to your Lord the Sultan? Moreover, the Spaniards do not\r\nworship the devil, but Allah—though their forms are different from\r\nyours and mine. That chapel is a house of God, and you would bring\r\na curse on yourselves by committing such a sacrilege, and would be\r\npunished by the Sultan for destroying his property. You are brave\r\nwarriors of your faith, going to the seat of war to defend your\r\ncountry. War not against brick and mortar, the property of your Lord\r\nand Master the Sultan, but lose no time and hasten off to Ceuta to\r\njoin your brethren in arms who await you.’\r\n\r\n‘The Englishman speaks the truth,’ the chief Sheikh cried\r\nout. ‘He is the friend of the Mussulmans. Come away.’\r\n\r\nMany of the wild fellows looked up as they passed and gave me a\r\nfriendly nod.\r\n\r\nNot a door, not even a pane of glass, was broken, and when peace\r\nwas restored and the Spanish Legation and other Missions returned,\r\neverything was found safe and uninjured as they had left it.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, my friend the Superior had died, and was succeeded by\r\nanother very worthy priest, who devoted day and night to attending\r\non the sick. All that he possessed he gave away in charity to\r\nthe poor, but he was more fanatical and intolerant towards the\r\n‘hereticos’—as he called all Christians of other than the\r\nRoman Catholic creed—than towards the Mohammedans and Jews.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Franciscan Mission, after peace had been\r\nconcluded, the Superior called and thanked me for having guarded\r\nthe chapel and their property, which, he said, was found just as it\r\nhad been left. I replied that it had afforded me much pleasure to\r\nbe of service to the Franciscan friars, always so distinguished for\r\ntheir charity and kindness to the poor Christians and Mohammedans;\r\nand, ‘after all,’ I said, ‘_Somos Cristianos y hermanos_’\r\n(‘we are Christians and brothers’).\r\n\r\nThe Padre looked very grave when I used this expression, and took his\r\nleave. The following day he called again, after dark, and requested\r\nto see me in private. He told me that he had been pondering over\r\nthe expression I had used, ‘_Somos Cristianos y hermanos_.’\r\n‘If that be indeed the case,’ he added, ‘I rejoice; but I am\r\nsurprised that, as a Christian, you never attend at the Chapel. If,\r\non the other hand, you are still a Protestant, then you are not a\r\nChristian or a brother, but a heretic, damned to all eternity.’\r\nHe continued, ‘Are you a Catholic?’\r\n\r\nI replied, ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you believe in God?’ ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n‘In the Trinity?’ ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\nThen followed questions regarding the Sacraments, and whether I\r\nacknowledged the Pope as God’s Vicar on earth.\r\n\r\nMy responses no longer met the good Padre’s views; for he burst\r\nout, ‘I eschew you as a Christian! You are an accursed heretic,\r\nand shall burn hereafter in the everlasting fire of hell,’ and he\r\nraved in his excitement.\r\n\r\nI interposed, ‘Judge not, lest ye be judged. Condemn not, lest\r\nye be condemned;’ adding, with a smile, ‘you have declared that\r\nyou believe I shall go to hell and suffer eternal punishment. Now,\r\nI declare my belief that you, for your good works and charity, will\r\ngo to heaven, and there I hope to meet you. You see I have the more\r\ncharity, since you have cursed me; but I say, God will bless you. I\r\nreturn good for evil, as taught by our Saviour. If you inquire,’\r\nI continued, ‘regarding the belief of the members of the Church\r\nof England, to which I belong, or of Protestants in general, as you\r\ncall us, you will find that we have the same moral laws as the Roman\r\nCatholics, and that the livery alone and the outward forms separate\r\nus from the Roman Catholic Church.’ So saying, I held out my hand\r\nto the good old fanatic, repeating, ‘You shall be blessed for your\r\ncharity and kindness to all men.’\r\n\r\nHe took my hand in silence, and I bade him adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout these troubled times Mr. Hay rode daily, unattended, on\r\nthe beach or in the country. One afternoon, when riding along the\r\nnarrow road leading outside the town walls to the sea, he encountered\r\nan armed tribe coming in to join the forces then bound for the Tetuan\r\ndistrict, the seat of war. As he passed quietly through them, one of\r\nthe men, cursing him for an infidel, spat at him. Mr. Hay at once\r\nretaliated by bringing his heavy hunting crop sharply down on the\r\nhead of the offender, abusing him roundly the while.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the long guns of those who witnessed the occurrence\r\nwere brought to their knees, and he heard the click of the clumsy\r\nflint-locks as they cocked their pieces.\r\n\r\nUndaunted, he cried, ‘Shame on you, that would call yourselves\r\nmen! Cowards, go and fight with women!’\r\n\r\nSome of the elders, who were rather in the rear, observing the pause\r\nand disturbance, hurried forward and checked the excited tribesmen,\r\nand Mr. Hay, turning to them, said, ‘It is most unseemly and\r\nunworthy of the warriors of your race that these young men should\r\nattack an unarmed and unoffending individual. Is it for these youths\r\nto insult and abuse me, an Englishman, and the friend of the Moors?’\r\n\r\nThe elders soundly rated the offenders, and offered to bastinado, then\r\nand there, the chief culprit, which Mr. Hay however declined. They\r\nthen frankly apologised, pleading that the men were under the\r\ninfluence of great excitement at the prospect of fighting the\r\nSpaniards, else they would never have behaved so ill to the\r\n‘Ingliz,’ their friend. The weapons were lowered, and Mr. Hay\r\nrode through the midst of the horde, who made way for him quietly.\r\n\r\nWhen peace was finally concluded, in 1860, it was in great measure\r\ndue to Mr. Hay’s intervention. All the variations between hope\r\nand fear are chronicled in his letters home.\r\n\r\nAt last, on March 29, he is able to write:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThank God! on the 25th preliminaries were signed. _Entre nous_,\r\nthough Spaniards continue to rave against me, it was I who got this\r\nGovernment to agree to peace after a hard-fought battle in the plain\r\nof Tetuan.\r\n\r\n\r\nAltogether this period had been for him a time of great anxiety. His\r\ntroubles were increased by a sharp attack of what is now known as\r\n‘Russian influenza,’ which prostrated him just when affairs\r\nwere in the most critical condition. He fought against the malady,\r\nhowever, in his anxiety to secure peace; but when his family returned\r\nto Tangier they found that the illness had left him with snow-white\r\nbeard and moustache, who before had not a gray hair.\r\n\r\nThe three letters that follow were written from Meknes during a\r\nmission undertaken by Mr. Hay to the Moorish Court with the object\r\nof inducing the Sultan to concede the demands of Spain, and to place\r\nthe peace just concluded between the two countries on a firm basis.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, great difficulties arose with regard to the\r\npayment of the indemnity claimed by Spain. The Sultan had asked\r\nthe British Government to guarantee a loan, to which request they\r\ncould not accede. During his sojourn at Meknes, Mr. Hay received\r\na proposal from Mr. Forde, a British merchant, to raise a loan in\r\nEngland at 10 per cent., provided the British Government would make\r\na convention with the Moorish Government by which the interests of\r\nthe shareholders in the proposed loan would be safeguarded by the\r\nBritish Government. This matter was not concluded when Mr. Hay left\r\nMeknes, as much depended on the attitude taken by Spain. He writes\r\nto his mother from Meknes on July 18, 1861:—\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we are! all well and not even fatigued by our journey. We have\r\nhad a triumphal march through the country, and had I been the Sultan\r\nhimself, more honour and respect could not have been shown me.\r\n\r\nNot an unkind word has been heard from high or low. The General\r\nOfficer sent by the Sultan to Tangier to escort us is the third\r\nmilitary dignitary in the Empire. All the governors and chiefs who\r\nmet us were under his authority, and the good fellow told me he was\r\nordered by the Sultan to attend upon me and to meet my wishes as\r\nif I were the Sultan himself. He and I have made great friends. He\r\nsaid, ‘When I received the Sultan’s order to take charge of the\r\nMission, I thought I should have to take care of pots of china, which\r\nwould crack or break at the first jolt, and that I might therefore\r\nbe ruined by some accident; but I find I have to deal with men who\r\nhave kind and stout hearts.’\r\n\r\nI will not tell you of the thousands of wild fellows—cavalry and\r\ninfantry—who have saluted us on the road, but will merely describe\r\nour reception this morning.\r\n\r\nWe left our last encampment, called Kasba Faráo, at 4 a.m., escorted\r\nby the Governor of Sherarda with about 1,200 cavalry.\r\n\r\nAt 5.30 we were met by the wild tribe of Zerhóna, shouting and\r\nfiring. I do not believe they meant to offend us in any way, but,\r\non the contrary, to welcome us in this boisterous manner; but our\r\nold Kaid declared that no man should shout or fire again till I had\r\npassed. The Zerhóna objected, as they said they wished to honour me\r\nface to face. I should mention that they are of Rif origin, and fight\r\nbetter than all the other tribes put together. A dispute took place,\r\nand then the order was given to the cavalry to surround our party. In\r\na moment we found ourselves surrounded by the 1,200 cavalry; the\r\nchiefs of Sherarda declaring that they would ride down the Zerhóna\r\nif the slightest insult were offered. All passed off quietly.\r\n\r\nAt 7 a.m. mounted officers arrived, sent from the capital by the\r\nSultan to welcome us. At 8 o’clock, about four miles from the town,\r\nthe Kaid-el-Meshwa, the first military officer of the court, met us,\r\nand we beheld a line of about 15,000 cavalry and 18,000 infantry[41],\r\nwith banners flying, ranged along the heights surrounding the\r\ntown. Along these lines we passed, and I was presented to all the\r\ngovernors, generals, and other dignitaries. A _feu de joie_ was\r\nfired repeatedly along the lines.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Meknes arrived in state to receive us, also a relation\r\nof the Sultan; and the late Ambassador to London, with another Moorish\r\nofficer, came out to welcome us, and to say that they were ordered\r\nby the Sultan to attend upon us during our sojourn at the court.\r\n\r\nAll the shops were shut; the whole population lined the wall.\r\n\r\nWe are lodged in a large and handsome house, with a fountain in the\r\ncentre of the court. The walls are in Arabesque filagree, the floors\r\nin glazed tiles. The house is lofty, and has a second story. The\r\nrooms are magnificently furnished with carpets, mirrors, clocks,\r\nbeds, and velvet and cloth tapestries.\r\n\r\nThe provisions are profuse, never have I eaten such bread; and,\r\nstrange to say, the butter is delicious.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Ambassador waits below to learn our wishes, the General\r\nOfficer to act as chief guard. _Too much_ has been done, and it\r\nalmost makes me feel sad, as I know how little we can do to help them,\r\nand what a bitter pill I have to offer as the remedy to be taken to\r\nsave the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _July 22_, 1861.\r\n\r\nThis morning we had a public audience of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief officers of the royal household, with a guard of\r\nhonour, was dispatched by the Sultan to this residence to conduct us\r\nto the palace. We proceeded on horseback, and threading the winding\r\nand narrow streets of this town, which had been well watered for\r\nthe occasion, we arrived at the beautiful and picturesque gate of\r\nthe castle built by Sultan Mulai Ismael about two centuries ago. On\r\nentering the gate we passed through lines of troops, placed on each\r\nside of the passage conducting to the great court, or ‘Meshwa,’ of\r\nthe palace. This court, a mere walled enclosure, is about 200 yards\r\nlong and 120 broad. Around it were arranged some 2,500 infantry,\r\namongst whom I observed about 500 men drilled in the European style.\r\n\r\nWe were conducted to the centre of the court and there dismounted. A\r\nchair, which I declined, was offered to me whilst awaiting the\r\nSultan’s arrival. Immediately in the rear of where we had been\r\nplaced stood the chief dignitaries and officers of the Sultan’s\r\ncourt. A few minutes after our arrival, the chief Uzir came out from\r\nthe gate of the palace and, after salutations had passed between\r\nus, placed himself in the centre of the line of officers standing\r\nin our rear. The Uzir was followed by the ‘Kaid-el-Meshwa,’\r\nor High Chamberlain, of the Sultan’s court. A few moments after,\r\nfrom the gate facing our party, the Sultan, mounted on a magnificent\r\nwhite horse, entered the court. His Majesty was preceded by five\r\nled horses splendidly caparisoned, then came two officers carrying\r\nvery long lances: these men were followed by a number of officers on\r\nfoot, ranged on each side of His Majesty. Amongst them I observed\r\nthe Chief Executioner—wearing a broad sword—and the bearer of\r\nthe Sultan’s gun.\r\n\r\nHis Sherifian Majesty was dressed all in white, and wore a\r\n‘burnous’ with large silken tufts on the hood—these tufts\r\nbeing the sole mark of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAs His Majesty entered the court, the Master of the Horse shouted in\r\na loud voice to the officers and troops, ‘Our lord says, May God\r\nassist you.’ All the line of officers in our rear, Uzir included,\r\nkneeling, bowed their heads to the ground, and the troops, bending\r\nlow, raised a shout of ‘May God prolong the life of our lord.’\r\nThis was repeated twice.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, having advanced to within thirty yards of where we stood,\r\nwaved to us with his hand to advance, which I and the other gentlemen\r\ndid, after making our bows, till I stood within a yard of His\r\nMajesty’s horse. The interpreter, Mr. David Sicsu, accompanied us;\r\nas on such occasions it is etiquette to speak through an interpreter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormal speeches were then exchanged and the Sultan withdrew. The\r\nletter continues:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horse is the throne of the Sultan of Morocco, who is the\r\ndescendant and representative of the prophet Mohammed and of those\r\nKaliphs who, rallying from the deserts of Arabia on their swift\r\nhorses, conquered such vast and fair portions of Africa, Asia,\r\nand Europe.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the Sultan having mounted a milk-white horse is meant to\r\nbe emblematic of peace and goodwill. When His Majesty is displeased\r\nhe rides a black horse, and according to the royal humour he is said\r\nto vary the shade of the steed he mounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _July 28_, 1861.\r\n\r\nWe have not made much progress in negotiation, for the war\r\nparty is strong here, and the Sultan feels very strongly his past\r\nhumiliations. I have had one or two battles with the chief Uzir, and\r\nhe now openly declares that he takes my view of the whole question,\r\nwhatever may be the decision of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nWe continue to be feasted, and are rather bored thereby, for they\r\nfix on the late hour of 10 p.m. to commence festivities, and there\r\nis a great monotony; illuminations, Moorish music, tea and cakes.\r\n\r\nThe houses are most beautiful, fountains bubble all around, and the\r\nscene is a fairy one.\r\n\r\nPrincely honours are paid me everywhere, the population being\r\ncompelled to stand up as I pass, in fact I am exceedingly bored by\r\nall these attentions and forms.\r\n\r\nWe have our prayers on Sunday; it is perhaps the first little\r\ngathering of Christians that ever prayed together at Meknes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 30._\r\n\r\nI have just returned from a long private interview with the Sultan. He\r\nhas not conceded Spanish terms, for he has not the money, and,\r\ntherefore, to say he would give what he has not, would only make\r\nmatters worse; but he agrees to send an Ambassador to Madrid to\r\ntreat. To persuade him to do this was one of the chief objects of\r\nmy mission.\r\n\r\nThus far we have succeeded.\r\n\r\nSultan is very kind, says much that is flattering, and laughs and\r\ntalks with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Tangier, _August 20_, 1861.\r\n\r\nWe have arrived here, all well.\r\n\r\nI succeeded in obtaining Sultan’s consent to all demands the British\r\nGovernment desired me to put forward; so, if Spain keeps good faith,\r\nall will be settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the object of bringing negotiations to a conclusion, Mr. Hay\r\nsubsequently paid a short visit to Rabát, where the Sultan was\r\nthen staying. After his return to Tangier he writes on October 23\r\nto his mother:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sultan is at Rabát, and my object was to have a chat with him. He\r\nreceived me very kindly, and privately, as I had requested. He\r\nagreed to all I suggested, and even told his Uzir that his duty\r\nwould be to listen to what I proposed, and then to act at once on\r\nmy recommendations.\r\n\r\nHis Sultanic Majesty was in good spirits, scolded me good-humouredly\r\nfor not writing to him, told me he looked upon me as his best\r\ncounsellor and friend, and he therefore expected I should write to\r\nhim, not only what was agreeable, but also what was disagreeable,\r\nas he said thus alone he could learn the truth.\r\n\r\nI was lodged sumptuously. I refused all presents, but accepted for\r\nCommander Nicolas a splendid sword mounted in gold which the Sultan\r\nsent him through me.\r\n\r\nI begin to feel almost nervous about the blind confidence placed in\r\nme by the Sultan. I happened to mention to the Uzir that one of the\r\ngovernors of a port was an ‘imbecile.’ Next morning I was informed\r\nthat the Sultan said my opinion sufficed, and he was dismissed from\r\noffice. A Jew had been robbed and put in prison by a governor. I\r\nmentioned it. Orders were given for restoration of the property,\r\nand the governor is sent for by the Sultan, which is equivalent to\r\nimprisonment. I must think twice before I speak to these folk.\r\n\r\nThere are sad delays in England about the loan, but I am working hard.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, in January, 1862, in virtue of a convention between Her\r\nMajesty the Queen and the Emperor of Morocco, the loan was issued in\r\nbonds amounting to £501,200. The terms of the payment were that half\r\nof the custom’s duties were to be hypothecated as security, Her\r\nMajesty undertaking to appoint Commissioners to receive the customs\r\nduties. The Consuls and consular agents at the various ports were\r\ndirected to act as these commissioners, and the moneys so collected\r\nwere delivered to the British Representative to be transferred by\r\nhim to the contractors in London.\r\n\r\nAt the time the loan was issued, the customs duties were assessed\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n  Imports paying 10 per cent    £91,676\r\n\r\n  Exports paying 25 per cent    231,228\r\n                               --------\r\n                       Total   £322,904\r\n\r\nIt was expected that this sum would be increased by a duty on\r\nexportation of wheat and barley, which would have added another\r\n£100,000, raising the total to be paid to the contractors to\r\n£211,452[42].\r\n\r\nThe other moiety of the customs duties was paid to the Spanish\r\nGovernment to cover the remainder of the war indemnity—they also\r\nappointing Commissioners.\r\n\r\nWhen the loan was finally paid off in 1883, the returns were—\r\n\r\n  Exports     £832,212\r\n\r\n  Imports      807,536\r\n            ----------\r\n    Total   £1,639,748\r\n\r\nas against £322,904, quoted in 1862. This increase was attributable,\r\nnot only to larger commerce, but also to the improved system\r\nintroduced at the customs which Mr. Hay persuaded the Sultan to\r\nadopt. Hitherto the officials, as was common in Morocco, were a\r\npermanent unpaid staff, who were supposed to pay themselves by\r\nsubtracting a percentage from the duties levied. Under the new\r\nsystem supervisors were appointed, who received a fixed salary, and\r\nthese officials were changed every three months. This reform worked\r\nwell. It at once materially increased the revenue derived from customs\r\nduties, and, after the loan and war indemnity were paid off in 1883,\r\nthe Custom House officers continued to be appointed and paid on the\r\nsame system.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay’s services were recognised by Her Majesty’s Government,\r\nand he writes to his wife’s sister in May, 1862:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI received a telegram a few days ago from the Minister,\r\ncongratulating me on my nomination to the K.C.B. I am pleased,\r\nas Government recognises so handsomely my labours; and, after all\r\nthe abuse of the Spanish Press, and even of the Spanish Government,\r\nit is a public acknowledgement that I have done some good in the\r\ncause of peace and goodwill. My ambition is now nigh satisfied,\r\nand I am quite content if this is the last handle I get to my name.\r\n\r\nI am rather troubled with inflamed or weak eyes. I have perhaps\r\nstrained them at night. I have given up reading almost entirely,\r\nand only write to earn my bread, or to retain the affections of\r\nthose I love.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis eye trouble had its origin, no doubt, in the attack of\r\ninfluenza from which he had suffered in 1859, accompanied as it was by\r\noverstrain and work. It was further aggravated by his hurried journey\r\nto Meknes in the great heat of summer. For many years he continued to\r\nsuffer, and, by the advice of eminent oculists in London and Paris,\r\ngave up all reading and writing. All his letters and dispatches\r\nwere written from his dictation. Though towards the latter part of\r\nhis life Sir John in great measure recovered the use of his eyes,\r\nhe was always unable to read much at night, and thus endured what\r\nto him was a great deprivation.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the _Gibraltar Chronicle_ of July 21,\r\n1883, concludes the history of the Moorish loan.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are informed that a letter has been lately addressed to the\r\nSecretary of the Stock Exchange by Messrs. Robinson and Fleming,\r\nthe contractors of the Moorish loan of 1862, notifying its\r\nfinal settlement last month. The text of the communication is as\r\nfollows:—‘It affords us great pleasure to hand you enclosed\r\nthe official announcement of the payment off at par, on June 26,\r\n1883, of the total amount of the undrawn Bonds of the Loan of His\r\nImperial Majesty the Emperor of Morocco. We take this opportunity of\r\nstating that His Majesty has been careful to observe the provisions\r\nof the contract upon which the loan was issued, and we further beg\r\nto observe that Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Morocco, Sir\r\nJ. H. Drummond Hay, K.C.B., has most kindly rendered, voluntarily and\r\ncontinually, his valuable services in all details connected with the\r\nloan.’ In further speaking of this loan it was observed that it\r\nis one of the only loans where no hitch of any kind had occurred,\r\nand where perfect good faith had been shown. That such has been\r\nthe case all credit should be given to the Sultan, but we may also\r\nobserve that the Moorish Government has been so carefully watched\r\nand kept up to the mark in its payments by our energetic Minister,\r\nthat they have had no opportunity of falling into arrears. The loan\r\nwas not a very big one, but the amount of detail work caused by the\r\nsmallest of loans to a country such as Morocco is much greater than\r\nis generally imagined. From the first, however, the superintendence\r\nof it was undertaken by Sir John Drummond Hay without any benefit\r\nor remuneration to himself, and it has been carried through with\r\nthe thoroughness which has marked throughout his long public career\r\nevery measure to which he has put his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                 SIR JOHN HAY’S HOME AT TANGIER. 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British Legation at Tangier was, until 1891, situated in the\r\ntown, within a few minutes walk of the shore. In 1862 it still\r\ncommanded a full view of the bay and of the surrounding country;\r\nfor houses before that time were built only one story high, with\r\nthe exception of the residences of the Foreign Representatives,\r\nthen all within the town walls.\r\n\r\nErected in 1791, when James Mario Matra was Consul, the old Legation\r\nwas designed and built by an English architect. The narrow street,\r\nleading to it from the beach, passed the principal mosque, which,\r\nin the reign of Charles II, when Tangier was a British possession,\r\nwas known as the English cathedral.\r\n\r\nA short distance beyond the mosque the street passed under an archway\r\nfrom which the Legation was entered by large double doors. Inside\r\nthese was the deep porch where the kavasses sat, and adjoining was a\r\nsmall room where one of them slept at night as guard and porter. The\r\nentrance led to a paved court surrounded by the dwelling-house and the\r\npublic offices. On entering the house a great stuffed hyena, grinning\r\nround the angle of the staircase, greeted the new comer—frequently\r\nto the dismay of a native, who took it to be a living beast.\r\n\r\nA balcony, or rather verandah, from which could be seen the bay\r\nand the opposite coast of Spain, ran the whole length of the house\r\non the upper floor, in front of the drawing-room windows, and\r\noverhung the little garden, a walled enclosure in which the trees\r\nand flowering shrubs had grown to such a size that flowers could no\r\nlonger be cultivated beneath their shade, and which was therefore\r\nonly used for various pets. Here was kept the tame leopard in 1858,\r\nand later several mouflons and gazelles; here, too, young wild boar\r\nand porcupines had their day.\r\n\r\nIn his little book, _In Spain_, Hans Christian Andersen, the Danish\r\npoet and writer of fairy tales, who was one of Sir John’s guests\r\nin November, 1862, wrote of the old Legation:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were here in an old flat-roofed building with a balcony hanging\r\nover the garden surrounded by high walls. Within all was so pleasantly\r\nand well arranged. The stairs and corridors were adorned with skins\r\nof wild animals, collections of Moorish pottery, spears, sabres,\r\nand other weapons, together with rich saddles and horse-trappings,\r\npresents which Sir John had received on his visits to the Emperor\r\nof Morocco.\r\n\r\nIn the usual sitting-room—which was adjacent to a not insignificant\r\nlibrary—there were, among many paintings and engravings, more than\r\none well-known place and portrait belonging to my Danish home. The\r\nsplendid silver vase, a gift from the Swedish King Oscar, stood in\r\none corner, and in another a magnificent porcelain vase, presented\r\nto Sir John by the Danish King Christian VIII. Every window-blind\r\nwas of Copenhagen manufacture, with painted views of the palaces\r\nof Fredensborg, Frederiksberg, and Rosenberg. I might have fancied\r\nmyself in a Danish room—in Denmark—and yet I was in another\r\nquarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn this house there was every English convenience, even to\r\na fireplace; and from the balcony we looked out upon the little\r\ngarden where oleander bloomed amidst the variegated bell-flowers I\r\nhad seen in the churchyard at Gibraltar. A large palm-tree raised\r\nits lofty head in the clear moonlit air, and imparted to the view\r\nits foreign appearance.\r\n\r\nThe sea, with its white-crested waves, was rolling near; and the\r\nlighthouse at Tarifa glimmered upon us from the coast of Europe as\r\nwe sat, a happy circle, in the handsomely-furnished, comfortable\r\nroom. Sir John told us about the country and the people; he told us\r\nalso about his journey to Morocco (Marákesh), and of his residence\r\nin Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room used by Sir John as an office during the last twenty years\r\nof his life was on the opposite side of the court to that occupied\r\nby the dwelling-house. Outside it was a little railed balcony whence\r\nhe was wont to interview the peasants and poor petitioners who came\r\nto see him. They would come to entreat his intercession in cases\r\nof cruelty or extortion on the part of the Moorish officials, and,\r\neven more frequently, his friendly arbitration was sought, sometimes\r\nby individuals, but not seldom by rival villages or even tribes who\r\ndesired an impartial judgment on their differences. His decision in\r\nsuch cases was accepted as just and final, for his keen sympathy with\r\nthe peasantry and his love for an open-air life were among the many\r\nties that bound him to the people he had learnt to love and who held\r\nhim in such high respect. The country-folk knew that in him they had\r\na kindly friend, always ready in bad times to lend them small sums\r\nof money, to be repaid when the harvest was gathered—and rarely\r\ndid they fail to refund such loans.\r\n\r\nResidence in the town in summer-time, though not so unhealthy\r\nthen as now, was very trying for delicate persons and young\r\nchildren. Consequently, for many years, Sir John sent his wife and\r\nlittle girls to England to spend there the summer months: his son\r\nbeing then a schoolboy at Eton. When the girls were older, and better\r\nable to withstand the climate, several summers were spent at a villa\r\nwhich had formerly belonged to Mr. Carstensen, Lady Hay’s father,\r\nby whom the surrounding grounds had been beautifully laid out. But\r\nin 1848, when Sir John bought the villa, the garden had fallen into a\r\nneglected state. It had never recovered from the ravages committed in\r\n1844, when the French bombardment destroyed the greenhouses and the\r\ntribes completed the work of destruction by despoiling and wrecking\r\nboth house and garden. Still, it was a lovely spot. The house was\r\noriginally a small Moorish building consisting of a vine-covered\r\ncourtyard surrounded on three sides by long, low rooms. To these\r\nMr. Carstensen added several bedrooms and a large studio. Near the\r\nvilla stood, and still stands, a tower, constructed, it is said,\r\nby Basha Hamed, the original owner of the garden, and one of the\r\nwarrior saints who fought against the English and is buried on the\r\nhill of the ‘Mujáhidin.’\r\n\r\nThis garden Sir John had named ‘The Wilderness,’ for such it\r\nwas when he bought it. But to the Moors it was known as ‘Senya\r\nel Hashti,’ or Spring of Hashti, from the water, which, rising in\r\nthe garden, is conducted through it by an ancient aqueduct. Charming\r\nthough this garden was, the irrigation necessary in the dry season\r\nfor the groves of orange and lemon trees rendered it unhealthy as a\r\nsummer residence. Sir John therefore decided on building himself a\r\nhouse on Jebel Kebír, known to-day to residents as the ‘Hill.’\r\nFor this purpose he bought a piece of ground from a former American\r\nConsul, to which however he later added largely. The site of the\r\nhouse was pitched upon by a lucky chance. Sir John was hunting on\r\nthe ‘Hill’ with the gun, and an old boar being brought to bay\r\nin a cave under an overhanging rock, he crawled into the thicket and\r\ndispatched the beast where it stood fighting the dogs, and afterwards\r\nclambered round to the top of the cliff which overhung the cave. Much\r\nstruck with the position and the view this spot commanded, extending\r\nfrom Trafalgar to Gibraltar and along the African coast to Jebel\r\nMusa, he determined, if possible, to establish his summer residence\r\nthere. There, in 1861, he built ‘Ravensrock,’ naming it from a\r\nrock standing above the house which is known to the country people\r\nas ‘Hajara el Ghaghab,’ or, ‘rock of ravens,’ because these\r\nbirds assemble there at certain seasons before flying to their\r\nroosting-place in the trees below the house.\r\n\r\nThe plan of spending the hot season only three miles from Tangier, but\r\nat a height of 500 feet above the sea, and with a northern exposure,\r\nanswered so well that for some years Sir John and his family only\r\nleft Tangier every second or third year to go home on leave or to\r\ntravel on the Continent. Here came many an invalid from Gibraltar to\r\nendeavour to shake off the obstinate Rock fever. Here also gathered\r\nthe friends who joined in hunting or shooting expeditions, which,\r\nin the hot season, were undertaken at a very early hour, so that\r\nthe sportsmen might rest throughout the heat of the day in some\r\nshady spot and resume their sport in the cool of the evening before\r\nriding home late at night. Sometimes, perhaps, they would sit out by\r\nnight in the grounds, or in the adjoining woods by the melon-patch\r\nof a villager, to watch for boar in hopes of shooting one, and thus\r\nsaving him from an ignominious death in a trap or noose set by the\r\npeasants to protect their crops from the greedy ravages of the pig.\r\n\r\nWhen, in winter, the family returned to reside in the Legation,\r\nRavensrock was left unguarded (until quite recently, when it became\r\nnecessary to leave a man in charge); and for many years, for the\r\nconvenience of visitors a French window was left on the latch to\r\nensure easy entry, and not a single article, valuable or otherwise,\r\nwas ever missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA review of Hans Christian Andersen’s book, _In Spain_, published\r\nin the _Spectator_ of February 26, 1864, says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the prettiest sketches of the book is the description of the\r\nauthor’s trip from Gibraltar to the African coast, whither he went\r\nby invitation from Sir John Drummond Hay.\r\n\r\nThe family of Sir John, consisting of his wife (a daughter of the\r\nlate Danish Consul-General in Morocco, Monsieur Carstensen) and\r\ntwo daughters, were living in an Oriental villa close to the sea,\r\nwhich existence seemed to the poet like one of the wonders of the\r\n_Thousand and One Nights’_ tales. The English comfort and luxury\r\nwithin the house; the tropical vegetation in the garden and terraces;\r\nthe howling of the jackals, with an occasional real lion within\r\na stone’s throw of all this European art and elegance, strongly\r\nimpressed the traveller from the North. ‘I lived as in a dream,’\r\nhe exclaims, ‘through golden days and nights never to be forgotten,\r\nadding a new and rich leaf to the wonderful legend of my life!’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poet, after his departure, wrote from Seville a letter to Lady\r\nHay of which the translation follows. It is very characteristic of\r\nthe gentle unaffected being who brought pleasure to so many homes\r\nand accepted his small share of the good things of life with such\r\nmodesty and gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I express all my thanks for the great hospitality and\r\nkindness you and your husband showed to me and Collin? The eight days\r\nin your home is still for us the flower of our whole journey. We were\r\nso happy! We felt that we were welcome, and all around us was so new,\r\nso strange. Yes, I am conscious that if I live to return to Denmark,\r\nI shall take with me a fresh and many-coloured poetical blossom\r\nwhich I shall owe to you.\r\n\r\nThe steamer brought us to Cadiz in the early morning. Still, in\r\nthe night I had a slight alarm, for in the Straits we grounded on\r\na sand-bank, but we soon were clear and the weather was favourable.\r\n\r\nCadiz was for me a most uninteresting town. It is clean, as if\r\nin its Sunday best, but has no characteristic features. Seville,\r\non the contrary, is full of life, like Rossini’s music. And what\r\ntreasures are to be seen here—the Alcasar, the cathedral with its\r\nglorious Murillos! But it is cold here like a chilly October day at\r\nhome. I am dressed in quite winter clothing, and in the streets the\r\nmen wear their cloaks thrown round them so as to cover their mouths.\r\n\r\nI dread the journey to Madrid. To travel twenty-one hours at this\r\ntime of the year will not be pleasant. Very happy should I be if I\r\ncould hear at the Danish Minister’s at Madrid how everything is\r\npassing in my African home. Yes! you and your husband must allow me\r\nto call your happy dwelling by that name. Give my thanks and greeting\r\nto your husband and bairns; also to Mr. Green. I regret that I did\r\nnot manage to take leave of him when I left.\r\n\r\nI hope we may meet again next summer in Denmark.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark I will plant the melon seeds I got from African soil,\r\nand I hope they will thrive, blossom, and bear fruit.\r\n\r\nGod give you and yours blessings and happiness.\r\n\r\n                                       Your grateful and devoted\r\n\r\n                                                       H. C. ANDERSEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the native peasantry resorted to the British\r\nLegation for sympathy, and assistance in time of need, from the\r\nman they looked on as a kindly friend. In Sir John the victims of\r\ninjustice, greed, and oppression found a ready advocate and powerful\r\ndefender. The favour which he was known to enjoy with the Sultan added\r\nweight to his remonstrances with petty tyrants, and with officials\r\nwho, even if not themselves guilty, readily connived at tyranny or\r\noppression. The authorities dreaded lest they should be reported at\r\nCourt for acts of misgovernment—reported, as they well knew, from a\r\ndesire for justice and not from personal motives—and this wholesome\r\nfear drove many a venal Moorish official along the straight path. Thus\r\nit was that Sir John obtained so great an influence in Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe following story illustrates the way in which an act of kindness\r\ndone by Sir John was remembered and bore fruit after many years. It\r\nwas told by a Moorish soldier who accompanied an intrepid English\r\ntraveller into the interior. This attendant had been recommended by\r\nSir John, and on his return to Tangier came at once to report himself\r\nand give some account of the journey. He related that having arrived\r\nat a certain stage of the journey they were detained. The tribesmen\r\nwho occupied the district through which it was necessary to pass,\r\nrefused to recognise the authority of the Sultan, whose troops they\r\nhad lately defeated. Declaring their belief that the Christian\r\ntraveller was a French engineer come to spy out their land, they\r\nsaid they would have none of him. The officer of the escort sent by\r\nthe Sultan dared not proceed, and there was thus every prospect that\r\nthis, the first, attempt on the part of a European to penetrate into\r\nthis part of Morocco, would have to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture there appeared on the scene the Sheikh of the tribe\r\noccupying the district adjacent to that of the rebels.\r\n\r\nIn the words of the narrator of the story:—‘This Sheikh rode up to\r\nthe tents and inquired of me whether the Christian was a Frenchman, or\r\nwhether there was any truth in the report, which had just reached him,\r\nthat the traveller was the son of the English “Bashador.” I told\r\nhim that he was not the son, but a friend, of the Bashador, who wished\r\nto pass through that part of the country, and to whom the Bashador\r\nhad given letters recommending him to the good offices of the Uzir,\r\nin consequence of which an escort had been sent by the Government\r\nto take him as far as possible in the direction he desired to go,\r\nand that now the officer of the escort dared proceed no further.\r\n\r\n‘“Where are you from?” queried the Sheikh.\r\n\r\n‘“From Tangier.”\r\n\r\n‘“Do you know the Bashador?”\r\n\r\n‘“For years I was his servant.”\r\n\r\n‘“Is the Bashador he that lived at Senya el Hashti?”\r\n\r\n‘“The same.”\r\n\r\n‘“Is he well? And his son and household, are they well?”\r\n\r\n‘“He is well, they are all well.”\r\n\r\n‘“Do you know the hunters of Suanni and their Sheikh Hadj Hamed\r\nand Hadj Ali and Alarbi and Abd-el-Kerim?”\r\n\r\n‘“I know them all. Abd-el-Kerim—God’s peace be with him—was\r\nmy father.”\r\n\r\n‘“And the Bashador, you say, is well and his son and his\r\nhousehold. Alhamdulillah! He it was who procured my release when I\r\nwas imprisoned at Tangier. I have worked in his garden, at Senya\r\nel Hashti: I have eaten and drank in his house. His friend is my\r\nfriend. On my head be it to carry out the Bashador’s wishes. This\r\nNazarene, you say, is a friend of the Bashador who wishes him to be\r\nhelped on his journey. It is well. I will see him safely through. On\r\nmy head be it. This tribe will assuredly not grant free passage to\r\nthe Christian, nor to the Sultan’s escort, but I will arrange that,\r\n‘enshallah,’ the Bashador’s wishes be carried out. Even now\r\nwill I dispatch a speedy messenger to my brother, telling him what\r\nis required. By sunset the escort my brother will send should be\r\nhere, and after resting till the prayer of the ‘Asha’ is called\r\n(about nine p.m.), we will start, ‘enshallah.’ See to it that the\r\nNazarene be then ready to go with us. Through the night will we ride\r\nand shortly after sunrise we shall, with God’s help, be out of the\r\ndistrict inhabited by this rebellious tribe. The country immediately\r\nbeyond is now infested by bands of robbers, and the Sultan’s\r\nauthorities have fled, but before sundown, ‘enshallah,’ I will\r\nhand you all over in safety to the Governor of the next district.”\r\n\r\n‘The Sheikh’s men arrived about sunset, some hundred men, mostly\r\nmounted and all well armed. Shortly after the hour of the ‘Asha’\r\nprayer we started, our party riding in the centre of this escort. As\r\nwe travelled we found other parties of the Sheikh’s men waiting\r\nfor us at intervals; these, as we met them, joining and continuing\r\nwith us until—as daylight showed—the escort amounted to some\r\nthree hundred armed men.\r\n\r\n‘In the morning, shortly after crossing a river which formed the\r\nboundary of the hostile tribe, we rested for one hour. Then the\r\nSheikh ordered most of his men to return home; he himself, with some\r\ntwenty-five followers, escorting us to the dwelling of the Governor\r\nof the next province, where we arrived before sundown.’\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Sir John occasionally made such bitter enemies\r\namongst the ill-disposed and the criminal classes that his life\r\nwas endangered. One of the most notable of these was a native of\r\nthe village of Zinats between Tangier and Tetuan, a man named Aisa\r\n(Anglicé Jesus).\r\n\r\nA brother of Aisa’s had been ill and applied for medical relief\r\nto a doctor, an Austrian Jew, resident at Tetuan. The doctor did all\r\nin his power to relieve the man, but without avail, and the patient\r\ndied. Aisa chose to consider that his brother had been poisoned,\r\nand, vowing vengeance against the doctor and all Jews, soon after\r\nmurdered an inoffensive Israelite pedlar, travelling between Tetuan\r\nand Tangier.\r\n\r\nSir John insisted that the authorities should seize and punish the\r\ncriminal; but this was extremely difficult to accomplish, as he\r\nhid amongst the rocky slopes of the hills near Zinats, and thence\r\ncontinued to threaten the Jews, who, in terror of their lives, dared\r\nnot travel from Tangier to Tetuan, except under safe convoy. He\r\nalso sent a written message to the effect that, in revenge for\r\nthese persistent efforts to have him arrested, he intended taking\r\nSir John’s life and—failing other opportunity—would force his\r\nway into the latter’s house and kill him there.\r\n\r\nTo these threats Sir John paid no attention. He rode about as usual,\r\nunattended and unarmed, and even shot partridge over the district of\r\nZinats, the murderer’s haunt, while still urging the authorities\r\nin his pursuit. The villagers in that part of the country seem to\r\nhave shared somewhat in Aisa’s view of the cause of his brother’s\r\ndeath. They sheltered, fed, and hid him. It was only when a fine was\r\nlevied on the district, when some of the Sheikhs were imprisoned\r\nas hostages, and when a whole village which was supposed to have\r\nsheltered the murderer had been burnt to the ground, that they\r\ndeserted the criminal. He was finally traced to a cave where he had\r\ntaken refuge. The soldiers tried to smoke him out of his lair; but\r\nhe fired on them and then, seeing escape to be hopeless, shot himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENYA EL HASHTI]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                      THIRD MISSION TO MARÁKESH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Sir John went to the Court at the city of Marákesh on a\r\nspecial mission from Her Majesty’s Government, with the object of\r\nobtaining certain concessions and privileges. In this mission he\r\nwas in great part successful, though many of the promises made to\r\nhim to introduce improvements and reforms never passed beyond words.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1864, saw Sir John again in attendance at the\r\nCourt, which was then at Rabát. From that city he writes to his\r\nmother on October 16:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI arrived here on the 28th ult., having passed a week on the road,\r\nand had good sport with small game.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan did not enter Rabát till the 13th inst., having been\r\ndetained en route in ‘eating up’ some rebel tribes, some of the\r\nlatter causing him several days of uneasy digestion.\r\n\r\nThe night before His Majesty’s entry into Rabát, the Uzir tells me,\r\nthe Sultan woke up about 11 o’clock and summoned him. It was to ask\r\nwhether the Uzir thought I would like to see His Majesty enter, and\r\nif so to bid him write off and invite me to witness the scene from a\r\ngood position, where a guard of honour would be stationed to protect\r\nus from the wild hordes, or, if I so pleased, to meet and have an\r\naudience of His Majesty in the midst of his troops before he entered.\r\n\r\nAs a true courtier, I chose the latter course, and, having put on\r\nour armour, we sallied out at 9 a.m. to meet the Sultan.\r\n\r\nAs usual on such festive occasions, it poured buckets. I was well\r\ncovered, but not so were the members of my mission, who looked in\r\ntheir uniforms and feathers like drowned cocks.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the outer walls of Rabát, which are about a mile from the\r\ntown, there is a beautiful plain of red sand, with small undulating\r\nhills here and there, and covered with palmettos, shrubs, and wild\r\nflowers. The vanguard of the army, which latter consisted of about\r\n30,000 men, was already in sight, and picturesque groups of the\r\nirregular cavalry had stationed themselves on these heights, as,\r\nI suppose, pickets acting as a sort of police to the wild hordes\r\nthat followed.\r\n\r\nThe rain ceased, and the sun broke out as the Royal cortège\r\nappeared. The disciplined troops, a body of about 6,000 infantry,\r\ndressed in scarlet jackets and blue trousers, marched in parallel\r\ncolumns, leaving a space of about a quarter of a mile between each\r\ncolumn. The disciplined cavalry, some 500 strong, riding in front\r\nand rear and on the flanks to keep order. Within the lines came the\r\ntribes, each forming a separate body and marching with some sort\r\nof regularity, banners flying and pipes squealing, as if they had\r\nbeen Highlanders.\r\n\r\nThen followed some mules and camels with field guns and ammunition,\r\nand, after these, bodies of the Sultan’s Bokhári, or Royal\r\nguard. Troops of forty or fifty of these every now and then wheeling\r\nback and charging towards the group that surrounded the Sultan,\r\nfired their guns in the air.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty was preceded by a body of running footmen; then came the\r\nChief Usher, followed by two men on foot bearing long lances—the\r\nlast and sole signs of ancient Moorish chivalry; then the Sultan\r\nhimself, mounted on a beautiful grey horse, a monster for a Barb,\r\nbeing not less than seventeen hands high. Behind His Majesty were\r\nthe umbrella-bearer and the sword-bearer, followed at a little\r\ndistance by the Ministers of State, mounted on mules, and by a\r\npalanquin covered with scarlet cloth borne between two mules. It\r\nwas all closed, so there may have been some houri within.\r\n\r\nAs the Sultan drew near, the troops of Rabát, with the Governor at\r\ntheir head, approached, forming a most brilliant line, in dresses\r\nof all the colours of the rainbow adorned with gold and silver. His\r\nMajesty wheeled his horse, broke through the lines of infantry,\r\nand rode towards the newcomers. Down went the Mussulmen with their\r\nheads in the dust, the Governor playing fugleman, and then raised\r\nthemselves, crying, ‘Long live our Lord and Master!’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan raised his hands towards heaven, and called a blessing\r\non his townspeople of Rabát.\r\n\r\nWe stood a little to the right of the Rabátin: His Majesty, instead\r\nof awaiting our approach, and to the astonishment of all fanatics,\r\nturned right back and rode towards us. We advanced until I was close\r\nto His Majesty, my suite a little behind, and the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs by my side. Down went his Excellency in the dust, and I took\r\noff my hat and made a bow. The Sultan, who is the _ne plus ultra_\r\nof stammerers, tried to make a gracious speech, but stuck at the word\r\n‘Mahabábek’ (welcome). I took pity and made him a short speech,\r\nwhich he received with a smile such as the Rabátin declare he never\r\nbestowed on _them_.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony being over, His Majesty again took up his position in\r\nthe procession, and the march was resumed.\r\n\r\nI should mention that several bands of the disciplined troops were\r\nplaying European marches; some, really well.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs then suggested that we should\r\nkeep away from the crowd; but His Majesty dispatched another of his\r\nMinisters to invite me to enter his cortège—and to give a wigging\r\nto our chaperon, the Foreign Minister, for not having asked me what\r\nI should prefer to do. The scene was so interesting, and indeed the\r\nmost picturesque and strange I had ever witnessed, that I gladly\r\naccepted the offer, and we rode in the cortège to the palace. As\r\nthe Sultan entered the palace doors, we could hear the ‘lu, lu,\r\nlu’ (the hallelujahs) of the women. I had a short interview with\r\nthe Uzir, and then took my leave.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans are much surprised at the Sultan’s gracious\r\nreception of me in the midst of his wild troops. I believe it was a\r\npolitical move as well as an act of courtesy, and that, in entering\r\nRabát with his hordes, where several of the Foreign Representatives\r\nare expected, he desired to set them an example of how to treat the\r\nNazarenes. It has had its effect, for we have not even overheard\r\nthe word ‘kaffer’ (infidel) muttered. Strict orders have been\r\ngiven, and due punishment threatened, I hear, for any offence towards\r\na Christian.\r\n\r\nThe Uzir has returned my visit of ceremony, and now my work begins. As\r\nI told the Uzir, I come to see them as a friendly doctor, to offer\r\nadvice for health and happiness, but that like most medicines, mine\r\nare bitter and unpalatable. We shall see what I shall be enabled\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nThis country is in such a rotten state that though the Sultan be\r\na clever and good man, anxious for reform, he has not the courage\r\nnor the _men_ about him to carry it into execution. To give you an\r\nidea of his intelligence, an English engineer, Fairlie yclept, who\r\nis in His Sultanic Majesty’s service, tells me he lately erected a\r\nsteam-engine in Marákesh. The Sultan watched him at work, and after\r\none lesson told Fairlie to have fires lit and direct everybody to go\r\naway. Fairlie could not imagine what was going to happen, for he saw\r\ncarpets and cushions and paniers of food pouring into the building\r\nwhere the engine-room was. The next morning he learnt that His Majesty\r\nhad invited all the royal ladies to a picnic, set the engine working,\r\nand had some fun with his harem, terrifying them by turning off steam,\r\n&c. Fairlie says the man is naturally an engineer—he is certainly\r\nas black as any stoker.\r\n\r\nWe expect the French and Spanish Ministers, frigates, &c., so Rabát\r\nwill, I fear be for a time a focus of intrigues.\r\n\r\nYou will say ‘jam satis’ of Morocco!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of ‘eating up’ mentioned in this letter has always\r\nbeen a favourite method with the Sultans of Morocco when desirous\r\nof quelling discontent or rebellion amongst the unruly tribes of\r\nthe interior. If these in any part of the Moorish dominions, driven\r\nfrantic by the cruelty and extortion of their rulers, show signs of\r\nrevolt, an army is sent, like a plague of locusts, who literally eat\r\nup the disaffected country. In the case of the larger districts, such\r\nas Sus, these military expeditions are often commanded by the Sultan\r\nin person. Crops are devoured or destroyed, heavy fines levied, and\r\nsometimes villages sacked and burnt. When all the provisions in the\r\ndistrict are consumed, the army moves off, leaving behind starvation\r\nand desolation, and a people often too broken-spirited to think again,\r\nfor many years to come, of revolt. Sometimes, however, amongst the\r\nmartial tribes in the interior, who enjoy the protection afforded\r\nthem by living in a mountainous district, the Sultan finds the task\r\nof quelling a rebellion a difficult one, and eventually retires with\r\nhis army, having only succeeded in fomenting the discontent of his\r\nsubjects against his rule.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the question of the exchange of Gibraltar for Ceuta was\r\nraised, and a letter to the _Times_ from Admiral Grey, a former\r\nSenior Naval Officer at Gibraltar, caused much discussion of the\r\nsubject by the press: the general feeling in England being against\r\nsuch an exchange.\r\n\r\nWriting to Sir Henry Layard in 1871, Sir John gives his opinion upon\r\nthe question at issue:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it is the interest, and ought to be the policy, of Great\r\nBritain to maintain friendly relations with Spain. I am even one of\r\nthose unwise men, who would like to see Gibraltar restored to Spain,\r\nand thus extract a thorn which festers in the heart of every proud\r\nSpaniard—a sentiment I do not blame.\r\n\r\nI am told by important military and even naval men, that Gibraltar\r\nwould be worthless in war time as a port of refuge. In the present\r\nstate of gunnery, nothing could live there, either on land or water,\r\nunless under a bomb-proof roof, so we should be compelled to have an\r\niron fleet to protect 6,000 men, cooped up. _Cui bono!!_ If we could\r\nfind a _quid pro quo_ suitable as a coaling station in time of peace\r\nin these waters, I say the sooner we make terms with Spain the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John always declared that, from a military point of view, he was\r\nno judge of the question; but as a diplomatist he strongly advocated\r\nthe exchange of Gibraltar for Ceuta. Our possession of the Rock being\r\nmost bitterly distasteful to our national ally Spain, he maintained\r\nthat by occupying Ceuta in its stead we should conciliate the Spanish\r\nnation. He was of opinion that so long as Gibraltar should remain in\r\nour hands, no friendly footing could be established between the two\r\ncountries. Spain, though unable alone to take the fortress from us,\r\nwould certainly ally herself with our enemies in case of a European\r\nwar in order to recover this stronghold.\r\n\r\nThe Moors, on the other hand, would welcome the presence of Great\r\nBritain on their coasts, not only as a safeguard to their national\r\nindependence, but as a guarantee against the encroachments of their\r\nhereditary enemies the Spaniards, whose desire to increase their\r\npossessions at the cost of Morocco is a constant terror to the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe objections which might be raised by other Foreign Powers to such\r\nan exchange could be met by Great Britain undertaking not to attempt\r\nto increase her territory in Morocco beyond what would be acquired\r\nfrom Spain, and further to maintain the integrity of Morocco as an\r\nindependent and strictly neutral State.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, once established in a stronghold on the shores of\r\nMorocco, and relieved from the jealousy and ill-feeling of Spain,\r\nwould be able to insist on the reforms so necessary in Morocco, and\r\ncould bring pressure to bear on the Moorish Government to open up\r\ntrade, and to permit the exploitation of the immense mineral wealth\r\nof the country. Coal, as is well known, is to be found on the Straits\r\nCoast, though foreign jealousy, as much as the retrogressive policy\r\nof the Moorish Government, has hitherto impeded the working of that\r\nand other minerals.\r\n\r\nAs a coal store for the Royal and mercantile marine, as a dockyard\r\nfor the refitting of vessels, as a free port for the storage of\r\nmerchandise, Ceuta would offer the same advantages as Gibraltar\r\nin time of peace. As a dépôt for trade with Barbary, it would\r\nobviously possess many advantages over the Rock. Nor was this last\r\nargument to be despised, when the immense resources of Morocco as\r\na grain-producing country are considered. Her granary is capable of\r\nsupplying Great Britain with wheat, which could be exported by sea\r\nmore quickly and cheaply than from elsewhere, and would in a measure\r\nrelieve the United Kingdom from the risk that, in time of European\r\nwar, some of the important grain marts of the world may be closed\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nIn case of war, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to\r\nvictual Gibraltar, as Spain would undoubtedly stop all supplies\r\nfrom entering the fortress from the mainland. No such contingency,\r\non the other hand, could threaten our hold on Ceuta, where plentiful\r\nsupplies would be available from the mainland both for the use of\r\nthe garrison and for provisioning the fleet. At Ceuta British ships\r\nwould find a harbour of refuge in a friendly and neutral country,\r\nwithout being exposed, as they might well be at Gibraltar, to the\r\nguns of the enemy on the Spanish coast, and could pass the Straits\r\nin safety without approaching within range of a Spanish fortress.\r\n\r\nThat there would be many and great difficulties in the way of such\r\nan exchange was foreseen by Sir John. Not the least of these is the\r\nimmense expenditure on the fortification of the Rock. This, however,\r\nhe thought might be met by Spain undertaking to make the necessary\r\nalterations and repairs at Ceuta, and, pending the completion of\r\nthese works, agreeing to allow Great Britain the use of Gibraltar\r\nfor her ships as heretofore in time of peace or war.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Ceuta, in its present state, does not offer the\r\nsame advantages as that of Gibraltar; but Sir John believed that\r\nit was capable of such improvements as would render it thoroughly\r\nefficient. Though great expense would be incurred by Great Britain,\r\nhe thought that the stability which such an exchange would give to\r\nthe maintenance of the peace of Europe was deserving of consideration.\r\n\r\nFinally, it may be remembered that Lord Nelson used to say our naval\r\nsuccess in the South of Europe would depend on the friendship of\r\nMorocco, or on our obtaining possession of Tangier. He foresaw that\r\nany great Power established on a sure footing on the North African\r\ncoast would practically command the passage of the Straits for\r\nseventy miles.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the reasons which weighed most strongly with Sir\r\nJohn. His long residence in Morocco, and his genuine interest in\r\nits prosperity, led him to advocate the exchange, not merely for the\r\nadvantage of Great Britain, but also for the benefit of the Moors. He\r\nsaw in the occupation of Ceuta a means of promoting the welfare of\r\nthe Sultan’s subjects, and a powerful instrument for pressing upon\r\nthe Government the reforms for which he so constantly pleaded. In\r\n1865 Sultan Sid Mohammed had introduced certain changes; but these\r\nattempts at improvement were too timid to produce any real result.\r\n\r\nThree years later (1868), Sir John visited the Sultan’s Court at\r\nFas, and he took every opportunity, afforded by frequent private\r\naudiences, of again urging upon his Majesty the necessity of sweeping\r\nchanges in the judicial, financial, and administrative system of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to Sir Henry Layard he speaks of the outspoken\r\nadvice which he was in the habit of offering to the Sultan, and\r\nattributes to his frankness the influence which he enjoyed at the\r\nMoorish Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Government is the most _miserable_ in the world, and with the\r\nexception of the Sultan himself, who is an honest man without energy,\r\nAji, and one or two others, they are a corrupt and venal set. As long,\r\nhowever, as I am accredited to such a Government, I have thought it\r\nmy duty to keep on the best terms with all. . . .\r\n\r\nNot only my Spanish colleagues, but I may say all in their turn,\r\nattribute the good favour in which I am held by the Sultan and his\r\nmyrmidons to my giving secret counsels in opposition to the demands\r\nof Representatives of other Foreign Governments, and thus currying\r\nfavour. They cannot and will not understand that I have managed\r\nto maintain a certain ascendency over the mind of the Sultan,\r\nin questions with other Foreign Powers, from the very fact of my\r\nnever having hesitated in speaking my mind and recommending the most\r\nunpalatable concessions. The late Sultan, as also the present, found\r\nthat when they had not accepted my disinterested advice, troubles\r\nensued and they paid dearly. I therefore still hold my ground at the\r\nCourt, though Morocco has found itself on more than one occasion,\r\nas in the last Spanish war, abandoned by England.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reception of the Mission on arrival at Fas was most cordial,\r\nand the usual great show of troops and powder-play was made. A very\r\nbeautiful house, splendidly furnished, with a small garden attached,\r\nwas assigned to the Minister and his suite; and the first repast\r\nwas placed on the table in the dining-room as Sir John entered the\r\nhouse. It consisted of an immense bowl of milk, and a huge dish\r\nof dates, which had been sent direct from the Sultan’s palace,\r\nwith a message to the effect that it was a token of welcome always\r\noffered to Moorish princes—and to them only—on their arrival in\r\na Royal city. A curious form of hospitality, evidently a survival\r\nfrom the custom which prevailed among the Arabs in olden time.\r\n\r\nThis was the first occasion on which ladies had joined any Mission\r\nto the Sultan’s Court; Mrs. Drummond Hay accompanied her husband,\r\nthen Sir John’s secretary, the elder Miss Hay being also of the\r\nparty. As Christian women had hitherto never entered Fas—except\r\nas captives, in the days of the Barbary pirates—the population was\r\nboth excited and amused by their apparition, as they walked through\r\nthe bazaars and streets of the town, or rode in the environs with\r\nthe gentlemen of the party. It was necessary for them always to be\r\naccompanied by an escort of native soldiers, to keep off the crowds\r\nthat thronged in the streets to gaze at the strangers; but no rudeness\r\nor unpleasantness of any kind was ever met with. When riding in the\r\npretty country about Fas, this mounted escort—consisting generally\r\nof six troopers—found that they could not keep pace with the\r\nEuropeans, and were replaced by half a dozen Berber horsemen. These\r\nsmall wiry mountaineers, riding active ponies, were prepared to dash\r\nalong at any pace over the roughest ground.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish Ministers, some of whom had visited European courts,\r\ninvited the presence of the ladies at all the banquets and receptions\r\noffered to the Mission; admitting them also to the harems, where\r\nthey were well received by the Fas ladies, wives of the principal\r\nMinisters. These ladies differ in some degree from their countrywomen\r\nin other towns. Amongst persons of high rank, a certain amount\r\nof social intercourse takes place, and men and women meet as in\r\nEurope. But these gatherings are conducted in strict secrecy, for\r\nfear of rousing scandal. The ladies of Fas, therefore, are more\r\nenlightened and pleasant than their sisters elsewhere. Many of them\r\nare well educated, according to Moorish lights, and materially assist\r\ntheir husbands or fathers in official or literary work.\r\n\r\nThe public audience of the Sultan took place, according to custom,\r\nthree days after the arrival of the Mission. The English ladies were\r\nespecially invited to be present. The ceremony was the same as that\r\ndescribed in Sir John’s letter to his mother in 1861—with the\r\nexception that the ladies were placed, in charge of several officers,\r\nunder an arch near where the ‘Bashador’ stood with his staff. From\r\nthis point they had a good view of the ceremony; but they were not a\r\nlittle amused at the veiled anxiety shown by their guardians—not\r\nthat they should see, but rather be seen of, the Sultan. H.S.M.,\r\non his part, made a graceful allusion to their presence at the end\r\nof his formal speech to Sir John, saying, ‘It has given us great\r\npleasure to observe that you have brought with you some members of\r\nyour family: this is a fresh proof of your confidence in us and in\r\nour people. They are very welcome.’\r\n\r\nIn speaking thus, the Sultan made the closest approach which Moorish\r\netiquette allowed towards referring to the ladies of the party. In\r\nMorocco, the females of a man’s household are never directly\r\nmentioned, but are spoken of collectively, as ‘the family,’\r\nor, more commonly, ‘the house’; and, in this form, are most\r\npunctiliously inquired after by Moors, when exchanging salutations\r\nwith their friends or acquaintances. Though, according to Western\r\nideas, this custom appears to imply contempt of the weaker sex,\r\nit originates rather from the fact that the Moors reject, as\r\nan impertinence, any direct reference to the women whom they so\r\ncarefully seclude.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the public audience, Sir John fell ill with\r\ndysentery—brought on, the doctor believed, by drinking the water\r\nof the Sebu river during the journey, and aggravated by the chill\r\nand damp of Fas, which, lying high, and plentifully watered by the\r\nriver that traverses the city, was cold and not a healthy residence\r\nin December. After more than a month’s stay, he was fortunately\r\nsufficiently recovered to undertake the return journey.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Fas, Sir John had several absolutely private\r\naudiences with the Sultan, at which he reiterated all his former\r\narguments and suggestions. He pointed out that countries smaller than\r\nMorocco—and with perhaps fewer resources—yet commanded greater\r\nrevenues, though their peoples were not over-taxed. In such countries\r\nthe security of property encouraged the natives in industrial\r\nenterprises. No dread of confiscation prevented the accumulation\r\nof wealth; and the justice and integrity of the administrative and\r\njudicial system made the inhabitants happy, prosperous, and contented.\r\n\r\nIn the Sultan’s dominions it was, as Sir John urged, the want\r\nof similar security which impoverished the people and emptied the\r\nexchequer. It was the tyranny and venality of officials that drove\r\nmany of his subjects to redress their own wrongs by robbery, raids,\r\nand rebellion, and impelled others to shelter themselves from\r\nexactions and mis-government by becoming partners with European\r\ntraders—who, by treaty stipulations, enjoyed immunity from\r\ntaxation—and, under their protection, to rob the Sultan’s treasury\r\nby evading the payment of exorbitant and irregularly enforced taxes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECEPTION BY SULTAN SID MOHAMMED]\r\n\r\nThe system of the payment of Custom House officers, inaugurated\r\nin 1860, was dwelt on by Sir John in support of his argument. He\r\nsuggested that adequate salaries should be paid to all Government\r\nofficials, who would thus be deprived of excuse for peculation, and,\r\nif they proved dishonest or extortionate, might be punished without\r\nmercy. He recommended a great reduction of the army, and, in order\r\nto check false returns, urged that proper lists of the troops still\r\nenrolled should be carefully drawn up. He proposed that authorised\r\ntax-gatherers should be appointed and the whole population equally\r\ntaxed without exemption of Sherífs or of Government officials; that\r\nthe payment of taxes should be strictly enforced; that tax-gatherers\r\nshould only hold office for a year, so that the incoming official\r\nmight act as a check on the proceedings of his predecessor; that the\r\nsupervisors of markets should be required to deposit a certain sum as\r\nsecurity before taking office, this sum to be forfeited if they were\r\nconvicted of malpractices. He also recommended the entire abolition\r\nof the system of presents, and urged that all officials, from the\r\nSultan downwards, should be strictly forbidden to accept gifts.\r\n\r\nIf these reforms were introduced, Sir John assured the Sultan,\r\npeace and prosperity would soon reign in Morocco, and his empire\r\nwould rise in the scale of nations.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the middle of December that Sir John left Fas on\r\nhis homeward journey. The last camp before reaching Tangier should\r\nhave been by the side of the river Mishra el Hashef. In summer this\r\nis a mere stream; in winter, when Sir John arrived at its bank,\r\nit was swollen into a deep and turbulent torrent. The previous week\r\nsome Moorish soldiers had attempted to cross, and several of them\r\nwere carried away and drowned in the flood; but the Arabs, who live\r\nnear the banks, declared that, by waiting, the party might risk a\r\ndetention of several days; though, on the other hand, the flood might\r\ndecrease in a few hours. At present they believed it could be swum\r\nin safety. Sir John, always impatient of delay, and anxious moreover\r\nto catch the mail from Tangier next morning, decided on starting,\r\nand plunged into the river on his horse. Two powerful Arab swimmers\r\naccompanied him, swimming in an upright position just down stream of\r\nthe rider. Horse and men were carried by the current some distance\r\ndown, to a difficult landing place on the muddy banks. Here they\r\nreached the opposite side in safety, though the water had washed\r\nover the saddle. Miss Hay followed in the same manner and, with her\r\nfather, galloped off towards Tangier. Four hours’ hard riding saw\r\nthem under their own roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                    JOÃO, THE PORTUGUESE GUNSMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the journey from Tangier to Fas, about three days’ march from\r\nthe former place, the Mission passed through the town of El Ksar,\r\nnear which is the famous battle-field where the Portuguese King,\r\nDon Sebastian, was killed in 1578. In connection with this battle\r\nSir John wrote the following story.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring one of my hunting expeditions as a young man, I was surprised\r\nto see that one of the Moorish hunters, a noted marksman, named\r\nAli Bufra, possessed a gun with a very long barrel of twisted iron,\r\nupon which was engraved, in European characters, the words ‘João\r\nRenauda, ano 1582.’\r\n\r\nAli was very proud of this weapon, maintaining that no gun barrel,\r\nancient or modern, could be compared to it. Curiosity has since\r\nprompted me to inquire into the history and origin of this gun,\r\nand from various sources I gathered the materials upon which I have\r\nbased the following tale.\r\n\r\nMulai Mohammed, Sultan of Fas, having been dethroned by his uncle,\r\nMulai Abdelmalek, fled to Lisbon, where he sought the assistance of\r\nDon Sebastian, King of Portugal, to recover his throne.\r\n\r\nKing Sebastian, then a youth of twenty-two, and renowned for his\r\nvalour, moved by feelings of compassion and generosity towards the\r\nunfortunate Sultan, and also by ambitious projects of conquest,\r\nacceded to the petition of Mulai Mohammed, in opposition to the\r\nadvice of his mother, Queen Catherine, who had been Regent during\r\nhis long minority.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, 1578, King Sebastian assembled an army of 15,000 men at\r\nLagos, and a fleet to convey the troops. This fleet sailed to the\r\nlittle port of Azaila, on the Atlantic coast, about twenty miles\r\nsouth of Tangier, and on July 29 the army landed and encamped on\r\nthe ‘Sahel,’ or plain, six miles from Azaila.\r\n\r\nMulai Mohammed accompanied the army, having left his son at Lisbon as\r\nhostage and guarantee of his good faith. He had led King Sebastian to\r\nexpect that a number of the Moorish tribes would join the Portuguese\r\narmy, but these expectations were not realised.\r\n\r\nMulai Abdelmalek, Sultan of Fas, had assembled near the town of El\r\nKsar an army of 40,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry, and thirty-five\r\ncannon, besides an auxiliary force of wild tribes from the mountains\r\nof Beni Gorfet, Beni M’suar, &c. The Sultan was in bad health,\r\nand, being unable to mount his horse, was carried on a litter. He\r\ngave the command of the army to his brother, Mulai Ahmed.\r\n\r\nOn August 4 the Portuguese and Moorish forces met on the plain of\r\nTamista. Mulai Ahmed, seeing the inferiority in numbers of the\r\nPortuguese forces, surrounded them, and began the attack on all\r\nsides. King Sebastian and his nobles behaved with great valour; and\r\nthe King, though wounded at the commencement of the battle, charged\r\namongst the hordes of Moorish cavalry, with the hope of rallying his\r\ntroops scattered by the onslaught of the Moors. The King was slain,\r\nas also the nobles who had joined in the charge. Sultan Abdelmalek\r\nviewed from his litter the battle, and, though stricken with fever and\r\nin a very weak state, mounted his horse, notwithstanding the efforts\r\nmade by his officers to dissuade him. The Sultan, who was then only\r\nthirty-five years of age, anxious to share the glory of victory,\r\ndeclared that he must perish either by the hand of the enemy or that\r\nof God. He died on the field of battle from over-exertion. His death\r\nwas kept secret until victory was assured and proclaimed, and Mulai\r\nAhmed did not hear of the death of his brother until after the defeat\r\nof the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nMulai Mohammed was drowned in the river ‘Mahazen’ during the\r\nflight of the Portuguese army, most of whom were slain or made\r\nprisoners. Don Sebastian was buried at El Ksar, whence, it is\r\nsaid, his body was exhumed at the request of the King of Spain and\r\ntransferred to Ceuta. Mulai Ahmed was proclaimed Sultan of Fas.\r\n\r\nJoão, a Portuguese gunsmith, was taken prisoner, together with\r\ntwo companions, during the battle. Mulai Ahmed, now Sultan, gave\r\norders that the Christian prisoners, numbering about a thousand,\r\nshould be put to death or sold as slaves. Amongst the latter João\r\nand two Portuguese soldiers fell to the lot of Sheikh Shashon,\r\nChief of the mountainous district of Beni M’suar, who dwelt in\r\nthe village of Tsemsalla, about fifteen miles from Tangier. In the\r\nbattle a brother of the Sheikh of Beni M’suar had been slain,\r\nso the Sheikh vowed his Christian prisoners should die, and thus\r\navenge the death of his brother—blood for blood.\r\n\r\nCords were bound round the necks of João and his fellow-captives,\r\nand, with their hands tied behind their backs, they were led\r\nbarefooted for two days over mountain passes until they reached Beni\r\nM’suar. On arrival at the village of Tsemsalla, a crowd collected of\r\nmen, women, and children, who hooted and spat on the ‘infidels’\r\nas they limped wearily on; the children crying out the old rhyme\r\nof ‘E’ Nesára fi E’ Snara: El Yahúd fi E’ Sfud[43].’\r\n(‘The Nazarenes to the hook: the Jews to the spit.’)\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh, to satisfy his feelings of revenge and those of his\r\nfollowers who had taken part in the great battle, decided to make\r\nthe prisoners butts for shooting at with matchlocks, and notice was\r\ngiven to the villagers that on the following day the shooting would\r\ntake place, so that every man who had lost a relative in the battle\r\nwith the cursed Nazarene could have ‘blood for blood.’\r\n\r\nJoão had a stout heart, but it quailed when he beheld the scowling\r\ncountenances of the multitude who thronged around them, and he thought\r\nof the morrow. Having lived some time at Tangier, at that period\r\nin the possession of the Portuguese, he had picked up a smattering\r\nof Arabic from the inhabitants, and he heard the announcement of\r\nthe cruel manner in which he was to meet his death, and felt that\r\nthere would not be an eye amongst the hundreds who witnessed it to\r\ncommiserate his cruel fate.\r\n\r\nIron fetters were fastened on João’s ankles, and locked with\r\na key which the Sheikh took. There was no prison in the village,\r\nso two of the prisoners were cast, fettered, into a ‘matmor,’\r\nor underground granary, closed by a large stone at the entrance,\r\nand a guard was placed near it; but João, whose appearance and\r\nmanners showed he was of a better class, was imprisoned in a stable\r\nadjoining the Sheikh’s dwelling.\r\n\r\nBefore the captives were led to their respective places of confinement\r\nthe women of the village were allowed to come and look upon the hated\r\nNazarenes; so, muffled in their white ‘haiks’—after the men\r\nhad withdrawn—they flocked around the wretched Portuguese. Many\r\nuttered curses, thinking of their husbands, fathers, or brothers\r\nwho had been slain in the great battle; but João heard expressions\r\nof pity proceeding from a group of women as they looked upon the\r\nhandsome young Nazarene condemned on the morrow to such a cruel death.\r\n\r\nAs night came on, João was put into the stable with a heavy chain\r\nfastened to his fetters and to an iron stake driven deep into the\r\nground. A bowl of water, with some coarse bread made of ‘dra’\r\n(millet) was placed within his reach. João, worn out with fatigue\r\nfrom his long march, soon fell into a deep sleep: he dreamed that he\r\nhad been placed by the Sheikh as a target, and that the gun which was\r\naimed at his heart missed fire again and again, when he saw the figure\r\nof a woman, looking like an angel in a white garment, standing behind\r\nthe Sheikh, and whenever the latter opened the pan of his flint-lock\r\nto put in fresh priming, she sprinkled water on the powder. Raising\r\nhis arms in his sleep, João shouted out, ‘I die happy, for eyes\r\nof pity are upon me!’ In doing this he woke with a start, and saw\r\nthe figure of a woman holding a green earthenware lamp. Bright eyes\r\ngleamed through the muffled ‘haik,’ and he fancied he recognised\r\none of the women from whom he had heard expressions of pity. ‘It\r\nmust be a dream,’ thought João, so he rubbed his eyes; but still\r\nthe figure stood before him, and, in a trembling, sweet voice, said,\r\n‘Nazarene! Do you believe in God and in the Day of Resurrection?’\r\n\r\nJoão answered, ‘I believe.’\r\n\r\n‘Trust then in Him,’ the figure continued; ‘He created Moslem\r\nand Christian. He is merciful to those who believe in and love Him. I\r\nseek to save you, Nazarene, from a cruel death. I shall never be\r\nhappy if “Baba” (my father) puts you to death to-morrow, as he\r\nsays he will, for you have eaten our bread. Baba takes counsel of no\r\nman, and is very hard-hearted, but he is always kind to me, for I am\r\nhis only child. He has never denied me a favour; but when I begged\r\nfor mercy towards you, he replied, “Nazarenes are ‘kaffers’\r\n(rebels against God); they do not believe in God and the last Day;\r\nthey are hateful in the sight of God and of all true believers, and\r\ntherefore are accursed. The prisoners must die.”’ So saying,\r\nthe gentle girl sobbed piteously; but after a pause continued,\r\n‘Nazarene, you have a good, kind face. I feel certain you _must_\r\nlove God and that He loves you. Upon my head will be your blood if\r\nI do not save you. It is past midnight and Baba is asleep; but as\r\nI lay on my couch I could not rest, thinking of the cruel death\r\nprepared for you to-morrow. Can you ride, Nazarene? Can you face\r\ndanger bravely?’ demanded she, her eyes flashing brightly from\r\nunder her ‘haik’ as she spoke.\r\n\r\nJoão rubbed his eyes again to make sure it was not a dream. ‘I\r\ncan ride,’ he replied; ‘I have no fear of death, and I feel\r\nhappy now that a woman’s pity has fallen on me.’\r\n\r\n‘See, Nazarene!’ she said, taking a key from her bosom, ‘this,\r\nwhich I drew from beneath the pillow of my sleeping father, will\r\nrelease you.’ So saying she bent and unlocked the fetters; then,\r\npointing to a saddle and bridle hanging in the stable, she continued,\r\n‘Put those on the gray mare; she is the fastest animal in the\r\nvillage. Here are my father’s spurs, and here is a “jelab”\r\nto hide your Christian garb: follow the road you came by until out\r\nof the village, then ride fast towards the setting stars. Why do\r\nyou hesitate? There is no time to be lost: the mare never fails,\r\nand will have the speed over all pursuers. Gird on also this sword\r\nwhich I have here concealed; it is my father’s trusty weapon.’\r\n\r\nJoão shook his head and replied, ‘I cannot do what may bring you\r\ninto trouble, even to save my life.’\r\n\r\nThe girl stamped her little foot, saying, ‘Do at once as I direct,\r\nor I shall hate you. Baba loves me dearly: he will not kill me. I\r\nshould never be happy again if you, our guest, were cruelly murdered\r\nto-morrow.’\r\n\r\nBut João repeated, ‘I must not and cannot accept your offer. I\r\ncan die happily and bravely now, since I feel there will be one\r\ngentle heart to pity me.’\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh’s daughter, trembling with emotion, exclaimed, ‘Are you\r\nmad, Nazarene, that you reject the only chance of saving your life?’\r\n\r\n‘Listen, sweet maiden,’ he replied, ‘never will I do that which\r\nmight expose you to the anger of your father; but I have a proposal\r\nto make, which, if carried out, may ensure my safety. You say that\r\nyou have influence over your father: tell him to convey me at once,\r\na prisoner, to the Sultan, to whom I can render great service. Not\r\nonly will His Majesty employ me, but your father, by taking me to\r\nthe Court, will rise into high favour. I am João, the well-known\r\nPortuguese gunsmith, who forges twisted barrels, a craft unknown in\r\nMorocco. Before the battle so fatal to us Portuguese, your Sultan,\r\nMulai Abdelmalek, dispatched a secret messenger to Tangier, and\r\noffered me a handsome sum of money and high wages if I would go to\r\nFas and enter his service. See,’ he continued, taking from the\r\nbreast-pocket of his coat a paper, ‘here is the Sultan’s own\r\nsignet with a recent date, which will vouch for the truth of what\r\nI tell you. In the early morn, before your father leaves his couch,\r\ngo to him and say you found in the place where I was confined this\r\npaper: let the Sheikh read it. The hope he may then entertain of\r\nwinning the Sultan’s favour should suffice to ensure my safety.’\r\n\r\n‘Thanks be to the Almighty!’ said the maiden. ‘He is merciful\r\nto those who trust in Him! I shall see my father before dawn and\r\nshow him the Sultan’s seal.’\r\n\r\n‘Stay one moment,’ said João, ‘and relock my fetters, lest\r\nyour visit to me be suspected.’\r\n\r\nAs she stooped to relock the fetters the folds of the ‘haik’\r\nfell from her head. She was young—about sixteen; her eyes were\r\ndark blue, long black hair curled on her shoulders, her features\r\nwere regular, her complexion olive: slim, but not tall, she wore\r\na blue cloth caftan, embroidered with red and green silk, reaching\r\nbelow her knees: around her waist was a broad silken sash: her feet\r\nwere bare. A coral necklace, silver bracelets and earrings were her\r\nonly ornaments. Smiling and blushing, she caught up her ‘haik’\r\nto hide her face.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, maiden,’ said João, ‘prithee let me know the name of\r\none who has sought to save my life.’\r\n\r\nAs she turned hurriedly to depart she said, ‘My name is Rahma’\r\n(mercy).\r\n\r\nRelocking the stable door, the girl returned to her room and lay on\r\nher couch, but could not sleep. On the first streak of dawn appearing\r\nshe went to her father, who was occupied with his morning prayers\r\nand prostrations. ‘God be praised!’ thought Rahma. ‘Baba is\r\nalways in a better humour after his prayers.’\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh, on seeing his daughter as he rose from his devotions,\r\ncried out, ‘Well, light of my eyes, what brings you so early? You\r\nlook pale this morning. Have you not slept well? Methought the\r\nreturn of your father safe from battle would have made my star shine\r\nbrighter. Sit down and tell me all. Who has displeased you? What\r\nis it?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Baba!’ she replied, ‘your safe return had made me most\r\nhappy, but now I feel miserable and very sad; for you have declared\r\nyou intend to shoot, this day, the Nazarene who has eaten bread\r\nunder our roof.’\r\n\r\n‘Daughter,’ said the Sheikh, frowning severely, ‘know you\r\nnot that your uncle was killed by the infidel Portuguese? These\r\nprisoners are their countrymen, and disbelievers in God, therefore\r\nthey must die. Whence comes this foolish pity? Know you not that\r\nyour mother—upon whose soul may God have mercy!—was a Sherífa? a\r\ndescendant of the Prophet, upon whose head be blessings!’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, Baba,’ replied Rahma, ‘but did not the Prophet, to whom\r\nwe pray, say, “He that believes in God and the Day of Resurrection\r\nshall have his reward, even though he be not a Moslem?” This\r\nprisoner, the Nazarene now in your stable, believes in God and the\r\nlast Day.’\r\n\r\n‘Who told you? What do you mean?’ cried the Sheikh, sternly,\r\nrising and placing his hand angrily on Rahma’s shoulder. The girl\r\nturned pale and sobbed out,—\r\n\r\n‘Have patience, Baba, and I will tell you all. Never have I deceived\r\nyou nor dissembled my most secret thoughts.’ She then related,\r\nwith a faltering voice, how she had visited the prisoner and what\r\nhad passed between her and João.\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh was very angry, though he felt amused at the innocent\r\nstory and courage of his beloved child. He had a very hard heart,\r\nbut often, through her intercession, the cruel Sheikh had been led\r\nto be kind and charitable in his deeds.\r\n\r\n‘See,’ she continued, ‘what I found in the prisoner’s room:\r\na paper with the Sultan’s signet.’ The Sheikh read it, and his\r\ncountenance changed. After a pause he said, ‘’Tis well, Rahma,\r\nthat this paper, bearing the signet of our Lord the Sultan, has\r\nbeen found. If this Nazarene prove to be João, the famous gunsmith,\r\nI forgive your rash and unmaidenly conduct: but be careful for the\r\nfuture, never to enter without me or an attendant any place where\r\na man, Christian or Moslem, may be.’\r\n\r\n‘Baba,’ answered Rahma, ‘I always obey you; but if you care\r\nfor my happiness do not shoot the Christian. Do him no harm, he has\r\neaten our bread and he believes in God. Until I am sure he is safe,\r\nI eat no bread nor even drink water.’\r\n\r\n‘Begone, silly child!’ said the Sheikh. ‘Set your mind at rest,\r\nfor I swear by Allah that João dies not this day.’\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh then read the edict again and again, muttering to himself,\r\n‘If this Nazarene be João the gunsmith, of whose fame we have\r\nall heard, my fortune is made should I present him to the Sultan;\r\nwhilst, were I to take the life of the cursed infidel, and it came\r\nto the ears of my Lord and Master that I had put to death the holder\r\nof his Sherifian edict, I risk the loss of my head. Before coming\r\nto a decision I shall verify, without delay, whether this infidel\r\nis what he pretends to be. If he be the gunmaker, I shall be off to\r\nthe Court the day after to-morrow: if not, he shall be shot.’\r\n\r\nPreparations had already been made in the early morning by the\r\nvillagers for placing the three Nazarenes as targets. An ox had been\r\nkilled and a great feast prepared: the mingled sounds of pipes and\r\ndrums were heard, and gun-dances, accompanied with frantic yells,\r\nwere being performed by the youths of the village. The elders, with\r\ntheir long guns, squatted in circles and discussed the events of the\r\nlate great battle; whilst, with revenge rankling in their hearts,\r\nthey awaited with impatience the order from the Sheikh to have the\r\nthree Nazarenes brought out to be shot.\r\n\r\nThe order was at length given by the Sheikh that the two prisoners\r\nconfined in the ‘matmor’ should be led to the spot where they\r\nwere to become the butts for the villagers to shoot; whilst two\r\nslaves, with drawn swords, brought along João from the stable,\r\nhis hands bound and his fetters clanging on the ground as he moved\r\nslowly towards the place of execution.\r\n\r\nJoão was resigned. ‘As I am to die,’ he thought, ‘I thank God\r\nI have a clear conscience, in that I have never wilfully wronged a\r\nfellow-creature.’ Then he remembered the kind pity shown him by\r\nthe daughter of the Sheikh, and said to himself, ‘As I am to die,\r\nthat sweet maiden at least will have pity and will mourn for me.’\r\nSo he walked erect through the throng of spectators with as firm a\r\nstep as the fetters would permit, and was conducted to the Sheikh,\r\nwho was seated on a hillock near the site chosen for the execution\r\nof the prisoners. Crowds of women and children thronged on each side\r\nof his path, and as he passed near some muffled figures of women,\r\nJoão heard the words, ‘Put your trust in God, He is merciful!’\r\nand his heart leapt with joy, for he recognised the sweet voice of\r\nthe Sheikh’s daughter.\r\n\r\nWhen the three prisoners were placed in front of the Sheikh, he thus\r\naddressed them: ‘Oh, Kaffers! Enemies of our Faith! prepare for\r\ndeath and the eternal punishment which awaits you hereafter. You,’\r\nhe said, turning to João, ‘boast that you are the famous Portuguese\r\ngunsmith. Does this Sherifian edict of our Lord and Master the Sultan\r\nbelong to you?’ holding it out, as he spoke, for João to see.\r\n\r\n‘I am João, the gunsmith,’ the latter replied.\r\n\r\n‘Prove it,’ said the Sheikh, ‘before twenty-four hours pass,\r\nby making a twisted gun-barrel; a forge and implements shall be\r\nprepared. If you fail, you will be placed as a target and perish\r\nunder the fire of the Faithful; and, as for the other prisoners’\r\n(turning towards them), ‘Kaffers!’ he exclaimed, ‘Blood for\r\nblood! You shall both die, and thus those whose brethren were slain\r\nby the accursed infidels shall have their revenge!’\r\n\r\nWith a loud voice João cried out, ‘I swear by the Holy Cross\r\nof Christ, if you injure a hair of the head of my countrymen, I\r\nshall not do what you have proposed in order to prove that I am the\r\ngunsmith. Neither durst thou, O Sheikh! put me or my countrymen to\r\ndeath unless prepared to incur the dire displeasure of the Sultan.’\r\nThen, turning round to the assembly of elders, he continued in a loud\r\nvoice: ‘I am João the gunsmith, the maker of twisted barrels,\r\nand as I have been offered by the Sultan a large sum to serve His\r\nMajesty, whosoever amongst you may have cause to be dissatisfied with\r\nthe Sheikh, and will give immediate notice at the Court that I am\r\na prisoner here and that the Sheikh has threatened to take my life,\r\nwill be sure to obtain high favour with His Majesty, who wishes to\r\nemploy me, as the Sheikh knows right well from the Sherifian edict now\r\nin his possession. We three Portuguese soldiers were taken prisoners\r\nin battle, and not in the commission of crime. The Sheikh calls us\r\nrebels against God, but we believe in the Almighty as you do. We\r\nhave the same law as you from God, “Thou shalt do no murder.”’\r\n\r\nSheikh Shashon shook with rage and fear: he knew he had enemies\r\namongst the tribe, as many had suffered from his tyranny and\r\nextortion: so he dreaded lest some one should hasten to the Court\r\nand report to the Sultan that the gunsmith João was his prisoner\r\nand sentenced to death. Turning therefore to the slaves who guarded\r\nthe prisoners, he said, ‘Take the infidels back to their place of\r\nconfinement. They shall die a more cruel death than that of being\r\nshot, since this accursed Nazarene has dared to threaten me in such\r\nan insolent manner.’\r\n\r\nMurmurs arose amongst the crowd that the prisoners should at once be\r\nslain, some crying out ‘Blood for blood,’ but the more prudent\r\nelders told the Sheikh that João ought to be taken at once to the\r\nSultan to make gun-barrels for the Faithful to fight with against\r\nthe Christians.\r\n\r\nAfter much uproar the prisoners were led off, and the Sheikh returned\r\nto his dwelling, having made up his mind, from fear of incurring\r\nthe Sultan’s displeasure, to prepare at once to proceed to the\r\nCourt. He sent for Rahma, and when she appeared, said, ‘Loved\r\ndaughter! I have met your wishes, and shall spare the lives of the\r\nChristians. To-morrow they will accompany me to Fas to be delivered\r\nover to the Sultan, who may, if such be his will, put them to death,\r\nshould the Nazarene who calls himself João the gunsmith prove to\r\nbe an impostor.’\r\n\r\nRahma embraced her father but said not a word. She rejoiced in her\r\nheart, for she was certain João was not an impostor, but she felt sad\r\nthat he was to leave, and that she could never hope to see again the\r\nhandsome young Christian whose life she had endeavoured to save, but\r\nwho, after all, might suffer death hereafter by order of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n‘Light of my eyes!’ said the Sheikh, ‘do not look so sad. Is\r\nit because I leave you? Please God, I shall soon return and prepare\r\nfor your wedding with my friend old Sheikh Amar.’\r\n\r\n‘Baba,’ she replied, ‘now indeed all gladness has left my heart,\r\nfor I can never marry and leave you.’\r\n\r\n‘Silly child! Go tell Embarek and the other slaves to prepare\r\nfor our departure to-morrow, and let two mules have packs put on\r\nthem to convey the prisoners. Two can ride together, with fetters,\r\nupon one mule, and João shall have his fetters taken off and ride\r\nthe other. Thus shall the Christian be treated kindly, as you have\r\ninterceded for him, but he must swear by Allah that he will not\r\nattempt to escape. Now tell your handmaids to direct the guards to\r\nbring João here, and put on your ‘haik’ and cover your face,\r\nmy daughter, so that you may remain in the room and hear what the\r\ninfidel says, and the orders I am about to give.’\r\n\r\nWhen João entered, the artful Sheikh put on a smiling countenance\r\nand said, ‘João, I have decided on taking you to the Court,\r\nas our Lord and Master, according to the Sherifian edict which I\r\nhave read, offered to take you into his service as a gunsmith. I\r\nwish you to forget all that has passed and that we may become good\r\nfriends.’—‘Take off his fetters,’ he said to the slaves,\r\n‘and go.’—Then turning to João, ‘No guard is necessary,’\r\nsaid he, ‘for you are now at liberty, João, if you will swear by\r\nAllah that you will not attempt to escape.’\r\n\r\nThe fetters were removed from João, who was about to give a haughty\r\nretort, when Rahma, who stood a little behind her father, lowered her\r\nveil and placed her finger on her lips with an imploring expression,\r\nso João replied, smiling, ‘I thank you, Sheikh, and accept your\r\nproffered friendship and will forget the past. I also swear by God,\r\nin Whom as you have rightly said I believe, that I shall not attempt\r\nto escape; but I have to beg that my fellow-prisoners also have\r\ntheir fetters removed and be treated kindly.’\r\n\r\nRahma, bending down to her father’s ear, whispered, ‘Have pity\r\non the poor Christians. God’s blessing will then be with you,\r\nOh my father!’ Whereupon the Sheikh, turning to João, replied,\r\n‘It shall be as you wish, and I will see these two prisoners at\r\nonce.’ So saying he clapped his hands, but neither Embarek nor any\r\nother attendant answered the summons, and the Sheikh, rising hastily,\r\nstepped into the courtyard calling loudly for Embarek.\r\n\r\nJoão then hurriedly poured forth, in a low voice, his heartfelt\r\nthanks to the gentle Rahma, and taking off a silver chain which he\r\nwore concealed round his neck and to which was attached a small cross,\r\nsaid, ‘Accept this in remembrance of one who owes his life to you,\r\nand whose fondest hope now will be to see you again in this world.’\r\n\r\n‘Never can that be,’ replied Rahma, placing as she spoke the\r\nchain and cross in her bosom; ‘we are not like the Christian women;\r\nwe are kept shut up and treated as prisoners, and are not allowed to\r\nhave a will of our own: my father has just informed me that on his\r\nreturn from Fas I am to be married to old Sheikh Amar of Zazor. I\r\nam miserable at the thought of leaving my father who loves me,\r\nto dwell under the roof of one I shall never love.’\r\n\r\n‘Rahma,’ said João, ‘could you love a Nazarene who believes\r\nin God, and loves you, sweet maiden, better than his own life?’\r\n\r\nThe girl, hiding her blushing face, faltered out, ‘I could, and\r\nindeed I do love you; but it is all in vain.’\r\n\r\n‘It shall not be in vain,’ said João, ‘for if I succeed\r\nin pleasing the Sultan by the manufacture of gun-barrels such as\r\nHis Majesty desires, and thus obtain his favour, I shall assume\r\nthe Moorish garb, and, throwing myself at the feet of the Sultan,\r\nimplore His Majesty to require the Sheikh, your father, to give you\r\nto me as my wife—if you will only love me.’\r\n\r\nThe clanking of fetters was heard; so Rahma, snatching from her\r\nfinger a little silver ring, gave it to João, saying, ‘May God’s\r\nblessing and mercy be with us both. Trust in Him, and we may hope to\r\nmeet again.’ She then drew back and veiled her face as her father\r\napproached, followed by Embarek and the two prisoners.\r\n\r\nAddressing the latter, Sheikh Shashon said, ‘At the intercession of\r\nJoão, whom I take to-morrow to the Court to enter the service of our\r\nLord and Master, as gunsmith, your lives are spared and your fetters\r\nshall be removed. You will be taken with João to the Sultan, and\r\nupon His Majesty’s decision your fate will depend. I swear, however,\r\nthat if you attempt to escape, no mercy shall be shown you.’\r\n\r\n‘Take them,’ he continued to the slave, ‘to your hut and lock\r\nthem in; but remove their fetters. Let them have food from my kitchen\r\nthat they may feel well and strong for the journey to-morrow. Put a\r\ncouch for João in the courtyard: he is my guest, free to come and\r\ngo as he pleases.’ Then turning towards Rahma, he said, smiling,\r\n‘All this I do to please you, my loved daughter.’\r\n\r\n‘May God bless her!’ cried João and his companions.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning the Sheikh mounted a fine mule, and\r\nthe prisoners the animals prepared for them; whilst, destined as a\r\npresent to the Sultan, the famous gray mare, adorned with a handsome\r\nheadstall, was led by a slave.\r\n\r\nRahma appeared on the threshold, muffled in her ‘haik’; but\r\nbefore João left she managed, when her father’s back was turned,\r\nto unveil her face, and drawing from her bosom, where she had hidden\r\nthem, the silver chain and cross, pressed them to her lips: which\r\ngesture João acknowledged by raising towards heaven the finger upon\r\nwhich he wore her ring.\r\n\r\nSheikh Shashon despatched a courier to the Court to announce their\r\nadvent, and fearing lest some enemy in the village might forestall\r\nhim, he wrote to the Uzir that he was bringing the gunsmith João\r\nand two other Nazarenes, prisoners, to deliver them to his Lord and\r\nMaster the Sultan, to be dealt with as His Majesty might please.\r\n\r\nWhen within a few hours’ journey of the capital a Kaid of the\r\nSultan’s body-guard, sent expressly by His Majesty, arrived with\r\nan order to the Sheikh to the effect that every care should be taken\r\nof João, and to inform the latter that a house and forge, where he\r\ncould work, had already been prepared for him, and that the two other\r\nprisoners were to be lodged for the present in the same dwelling. The\r\nKaid also informed the Sheikh that His Majesty commended his conduct\r\nin having brought João safely to the Court, and that the Sheikh\r\nwas therefore regarded favourably by his Lord and Master.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival João was taken before the Sultan, who informed\r\nhim that he would be provided with ‘mona’ (provisions), and a\r\ndwelling near the palace; that the implements of a smith and piles\r\nof old horse-shoes were also ready, and that for every gun-barrel\r\nJoão made, ten ducats would be paid him. The Sultan added, ‘If\r\nyou will become one of the Faithful, I have ordered that the garments\r\nof a Moslem be given you.’\r\n\r\nJoão thanked His Majesty and replied, ‘I accept with pleasure\r\nyour Majesty’s offer of Moorish garments to replace the tattered\r\nclothing I now wear.’\r\n\r\nWhilst thus accepting the Sultan’s offer, João vowed in his heart\r\nthat, though assuming the outward garb of a Mohammedan in the hope\r\nof obtaining Rahma hereafter as his wife, he would remain always\r\na true Catholic, and hope for the day when he would return to the\r\nland of his forefathers.\r\n\r\nJoão was very industrious, and with the assistance only of the two\r\nPortuguese, his fellow-prisoners—for he did not wish the Moors\r\nto discover the secret of his art—he was enabled to manufacture\r\na number of barrels, even before the Sheikh left the Court.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan[44], who was interested in every kind of mechanism, was\r\nwont to go to the forge to see João work; gave him the rank of Kaid,\r\nand marked in many ways his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh was presented with a horse, with handsome saddle and\r\nbridle, as a mark of His Majesty’s favour, and before leaving\r\nthe Court went to see João, and told him of his own good fortune,\r\nand expressed his satisfaction at seeing from his dress that João\r\nwas now a Moslem and an officer in high favour with the Sultan.\r\n\r\nJoão shook the Sheikh warmly by the hand, bidding him farewell,\r\nsaying, ‘You know that I am indebted for my life to the intercession\r\nof your daughter. I intend to marry and settle here. Will you grant\r\nme the hand of your daughter?’\r\n\r\n‘It cannot be,’ answered the Sheikh, ‘I have betrothed her to my\r\nfriend Sheikh Amar. The Sultan, now that you are in such high favour,\r\nwill bestow on you, if you petition His Majesty, some maiden with\r\na larger dowry than I can afford to give my daughter.’ He then\r\ndeparted, leaving João very depressed.\r\n\r\nA few days after the Sheikh had left, the Sultan visited the forge\r\nof João and found the young smith hard at work, but looking very\r\nwan and out of spirits. Observing this, the Sultan inquired of João\r\nwhether he was unwell, or had cause of complaint against any one\r\nat the Court, and whether the food sent daily from the palace was\r\nplentiful and such as he liked?\r\n\r\nJoão replied that he had no complaint to make against any one,\r\nbut that he had a sorrow at heart which he could not make known to\r\nthe Sultan, lest it might cause His Majesty’s displeasure.\r\n\r\n‘Speak,’ said the Sultan; ‘have no fear. Any one who may have\r\noffended you shall be punished. Whatever you ask shall be granted:\r\nwhat I promise shall be fulfilled. Speak out boldly.’\r\n\r\nJoão obeyed and told the Sultan the story of his capture,\r\ncondemnation to death, and release at the intercession of the\r\nSheikh’s daughter.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded his tale, His Majesty exclaimed, ‘Allah\r\nAkbar!’ (God is great!) ‘Had the Sheikh taken your life he would\r\nhave forfeited his own. This daughter of his, the maiden who is the\r\ncause of my having you safe here to manufacture guns for the Moslems,\r\nshall be rewarded. What do you desire?’\r\n\r\nThrowing himself at the Sultan’s feet João said, ‘She who saved\r\nmy life I had hoped might become my wife, but alas! I have learnt she\r\nis betrothed to a friend of the Sheikh, an old chief of a neighbouring\r\nvillage, named Sheikh Amar. This it is that makes me miserable.’\r\n\r\n‘Before ten days elapse,’ said the Sultan, ‘if this maiden\r\nbe not already married to Sheikh Amar, she shall be brought here by\r\nher father and become your wife, and I will give her a dowry.’\r\n\r\nThe young smith again fell at the feet of the Sultan and expressed\r\nhis gratitude.\r\n\r\nA Kaid was despatched with all speed to the Sheikh of Beni M’suar,\r\nwith the command that he and all his family should be brought at\r\nonce to the Court. This officer was directed however to ascertain,\r\nbefore he executed this order, whether the daughter of the Sheikh\r\nhad been lately married; for in such case the Royal command was not\r\nto be carried out.\r\n\r\nThe officer departed on his mission and found that the wedding had\r\nnot taken place, as old Sheikh Amar had died suddenly shortly after\r\nSheikh Shashon had left for Fas. Father and daughter were therefore\r\nbrought to the Court, and on their arrival were given a comfortable\r\ndwelling near the palace.\r\n\r\nRahma’s heart was filled with joy when she learnt that João was\r\nin high favour with the Sultan, for she remembered his last words\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\nThe smith hastened to salute the Sheikh. Rahma was not allowed to\r\nenter the room, but she could see her lover through the chinks of\r\nthe door, and heard João, after saluting her father, say, ‘Is\r\nyour daughter, who saved my life, well? Is she unmarried? If so,\r\nI must not conceal from you that I have petitioned the Sultan that\r\nshe be given me as wife. For this His Majesty has been pleased to\r\norder you to come to the Court.’\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh, who had been in great trepidation, fearing that the Sultan\r\nmight have heard of the intention he at one time had of putting João\r\nand the other Portuguese to death, and that His Majesty had summoned\r\nhim to the Court to punish him, was greatly relieved, and replied,—\r\n\r\n‘Oh my son! as your garb shows you are now one of the Faithful\r\nand in favour with our Lord and Master, His Majesty’s commands,\r\nwhatever they may be, shall be joyfully obeyed.’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan ordered the Uzir to signify to the Sheikh his Royal\r\ncommand that his daughter was forthwith to be wedded to João, and\r\nthat it was His Majesty’s intention to give her a handsome dowry.\r\n\r\nA great feast was prepared by the officers of the Court, at which\r\nthe Sheikh attended, whilst Rahma was taken to the harem of the\r\nHajib (Chief Chamberlain), where the ladies had also prepared a\r\nfeast. Beautiful dresses and jewelry were sent by the Sultan to\r\nRahma, and a marriage contract was drawn up by public notaries,\r\nsigned by the Kadi, with a note of the dowry, one thousand ducats,\r\ngiven her by the Sultan.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the wedding, the bride, ensconced in a wooden cage,\r\ncovered with silk and embroidery, was conveyed on the back of a mule\r\nto João’s house, accompanied by musicians with pipes and drums\r\nand a large troop of men firing guns. The cage was removed from the\r\nback of the mule by four female slaves and brought into the room,\r\nprepared with handsome carpets, where João awaited her. The slaves\r\nassisted her to leave the cage and retired.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone Rahma threw herself at the feet of her\r\nhusband, crying, ‘Oh beloved! God has answered our prayers. He\r\nis merciful, and now I shall be, as long as I live, your faithful,\r\nhappy wife. But, João, I beg you to repeat that you believe in God\r\nand the Day of Resurrection. I rejoice to see you in the garb of a\r\nMoslem, and hope you are now really one of the Faithful.’\r\n\r\n‘Rahma,’ he said, raising her in his arms, ‘to thee I owe\r\nmy life; for thee I shall be ready to lay it down; but I must not\r\ndeceive thee! I am not a Moslem, but a Christian, and, as such, I\r\nbelieve in God and the last Day. I assumed this garb in order that\r\nI might be supposed to be a Mohammedan, and thus be able to petition\r\nthe Sultan that you should be my wife.’\r\n\r\nRahma drew away from his arms, saying, ‘I cannot, I must not,\r\noffend God by marrying a Christian.’\r\n\r\nJoão replied, ‘Know you not that your prophet Mohammed married a\r\nChristian woman? Oh loved wife! I shall be a faithful husband, and\r\nwhen I tell you about my belief and religion, you will learn that\r\nwe have the same laws from God, except that we Christians cannot\r\nmarry more than one wife. Does such a law displease you, my Rahma?’\r\n\r\n‘Swear,’ she said, ‘that you will never divorce me, never\r\nmarry another woman.’\r\n\r\n‘I swear,’ he replied, ‘that nought but death shall part us.’\r\n\r\nRahma then threw herself into João’s arms, exclaiming, ‘I am\r\nfor ever your loving wife, and shall honour and obey you!’\r\n\r\nJoão and Rahma were very happy. Of an evening, when his work was\r\ndone, he taught her to read and write Portuguese, and found her\r\nquick and intelligent in learning. He explained to her the precepts\r\nof the Christian religion, and told her that he hoped the day might\r\ncome when he could find some excuse to leave the Moorish Court and\r\nescape with her to Portugal.\r\n\r\nWhen their first child, a girl, was born, Rahma expressed the wish\r\nthat her name should be ‘Miriam,’ or Mary, the name of the Mother\r\nof the Saviour of all men, and that she should be brought up in the\r\nChristian faith.\r\n\r\nJoão was very industrious, and continued in high favour with the\r\nSultan, manufacturing many gun-barrels, upon which, besides his own\r\nname in European characters, he engraved the Arabic word ‘Sidi’\r\n(my Lord), to denote that they were made for the Sultan, and such\r\nbarrels are occasionally to be found at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish gunsmiths having lost, since João’s arrival at Court,\r\nthe Royal custom, took counsel together how they should contrive to\r\ndiscover the Christian’s secret of forging the twisted barrels;\r\nfor João was careful to allow no Moor, except the Sultan, to enter\r\nhis forge when he was at work.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese was of very cleanly habits, and had his workshop\r\nwhitewashed every month, for which work Jews are usually employed\r\nthroughout Morocco. One of the smiths, disguised as a Jew, offered\r\nhimself to João to whitewash the forge. He was engaged, and returned\r\nfor the same purpose every month.\r\n\r\nThe sharp-eyed spy watched the operations, and finally learnt so\r\nmuch of the process as to enable him to imitate it, and he succeeded\r\nso well that he presented a twisted barrel to the Sultan, which His\r\nMajesty considered to be as good as any of João’s make.\r\n\r\nThe latter was summoned to the Court and asked how it came to\r\npass that twisted barrels could be made by native gunsmiths. The\r\nunfortunate João declared he had been betrayed by some spy watching\r\nhim when at work.\r\n\r\nOther Moorish smiths also acquired the art, and, as good barrels of\r\ntwisted iron were sold at low prices in Fas, the Sultan discontinued\r\nemploying João, and ceased sending him ‘mona’ from the palace.\r\n\r\nJoão, however, had laid by a considerable sum of money, and he\r\ndetermined to quit the capital with his wife and try to escape to\r\nTangier. He therefore petitioned the Sultan to be allowed to take\r\nhis wife to visit her father, the Sheikh at Beni M’suar.\r\n\r\nThis was granted, and João bought animals to carry away such\r\nproperty as he had not been able to dispose of at Fas, and set out\r\nwith Rahma and her child for the village of Tsemsalla in the Beni\r\nM’suar mountains.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining some time with his wife at the Sheikh’s house,\r\nwhere they received a warm welcome, João informed his father-in-law\r\nthat he must return to his work. Leaving early one morning with his\r\nwife and child, he proceeded to Tangier, a distance of about fifteen\r\nmiles. On arrival at the Portuguese outposts, he was challenged by a\r\nsentry. The soldier proved to be an old comrade who had heard that\r\nJoão had assumed the disguise of a Moslem, and, recognising him,\r\nallowed him to enter the town, where he was conducted before the\r\nPortuguese Governor, to relate his adventures and present his wife\r\nand child.\r\n\r\nThe Governor took great interest in João, who had always borne\r\nan excellent character. Rahma, by her husband’s desire, wore the\r\nEuropean dress, and as a Christian no longer veiled her face. The\r\nGovernor was much struck by her beauty and gentle manners, and on\r\nlearning from her, for she had acquired the Portuguese language,\r\nthat she was already converted to the Christian faith and desired to\r\nbe baptized by a priest, together with her little girl, he took her\r\nto his wife and daughters, by whom Rahma was made much of. They were\r\nlodged in the Governor’s house, and the baptism was carried out,\r\nwith great ceremony, at the Cathedral[45] of Tangier; the child was\r\nchristened Miriam.\r\n\r\nAfter a sojourn of some weeks, João and his family were given\r\na passage in a Government vessel bound to Lisbon, with letters\r\nof recommendation to the King and Queen, to whom their history\r\nwas related. The Royal family patronised João, and took especial\r\ninterest in pretty Rahma and her daughter as being converts from\r\nthe Mohammedan faith.\r\n\r\nBeing a clever mechanic, João obtained a lucrative employment, and\r\nlived in ease and comfort with his wife, who bore him a large family.\r\n\r\nRahma wrote to her father and described how happy she and her husband\r\nwere, and that they had escaped to the land of the Nazarenes, as\r\nthey had feared the jealous and revengeful feelings of the smiths\r\nat the capital; for João, since the betrayal of his secret, had no\r\nlonger been shown favour by the Sultan. However, for fear of causing\r\nsorrow to her father, she did not inform him of her conversion to\r\nthe Christian faith.\r\n\r\nJoão sent the old Sheikh a beautiful gun, with his own name and\r\nthat of Sheikh Shashon engraved on the barrel in letters of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                   FOURTH MISSION TO MARÁKESH. 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Sir John was made Minister Plenipotentiary. This mark of\r\nconfidence on the part of Her Majesty’s Government was the more\r\nacceptable as he had recently been attacked in the English press. The\r\nmost important of these attacks appeared in the _Spectator_,\r\nwhich however afterwards withdrew its charges unreservedly. Unjust\r\naccusations of this nature affected him only for the moment, when his\r\nquick and passionate spirit would fire up under misrepresentation,\r\nfor, as he writes: ‘I was lugged out of my little corner and set\r\non a pedestal to be pelted with dirt—now replaced by bouquets. I\r\nam getting callous to abuse. “Fais ce que dois, advienne que\r\npourra.”’\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated September 27, 1872, to Sir Joseph Hooker,\r\nhe says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have made me Minister Plenipotentiary, and I am to go to the\r\nMoorish Court to present my new credentials during the winter. The\r\nSultan is at Marákesh, or will be there when he has ‘eaten\r\nup’ a rebel tribe or two. I do not remain permanently; in fact,\r\nI should decline to do so, though I hope the day will come when we\r\nshall have the British Representative resident at the fountain-head,\r\nand thus alone can we hope that the turbid waters may begin to clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 1873, Sir John, four ladies, and seven gentlemen embarked\r\non board H.M.S. Lively for Mazagan, _en route_ for Marákesh. Mazagan,\r\nwhich was reached the following forenoon, has a picturesque appearance\r\nfrom the sea; but of itself is an uninteresting town. The country\r\nsurrounding it is flat and sandy, with only a few palm-trees and\r\nthe cupolas of scattered sanctuaries, or saint-houses, to relieve\r\nthe monotony of the scenery.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the landing-place was by a passage through a curious\r\nold Portuguese breakwater, repaired some years previously by the\r\nMoorish Government at Sir John’s instigation. On landing under\r\nthe customary salute, Sir John was welcomed by the Governor and\r\nauthorities, who conducted him to the dwelling prepared for the\r\nMission,—a house standing on what had been, during the occupation\r\nof Mazagan by the Portuguese in the seventeenth century, the site\r\nof a church. Its steeple, now used as a belvedere, is still standing.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan had sent a liberal supply of saddle and baggage animals,\r\nand a few extra tents of handsome Moorish make, lined and decorated\r\nwithin in different coloured cloths. With these were a body of a\r\ndozen ‘fraijia,’ tent-pitchers, attached to his army. These men\r\nproved most efficient and did their work smartly and thoroughly. They\r\nwere all, without exception, Bokhári.\r\n\r\nThe Mission left Mazagan early on the 28th. The escort consisted of\r\na Kaid Erha and seven officers, with some thirty troopers. ‘Kaid\r\nErha,’ it may be explained, means ‘the Commander of a Mill,’ as,\r\nduring campaigns in Morocco, a hand-mill for grinding corn is allotted\r\nto every thousand men. Hence the title of Kaid Erha given to every\r\nofficer in command of a thousand. Kaid el Mia, or Kaid of a hundred,\r\nis the next grade, corresponding to the centurion of the Romans.\r\n\r\nBesides this escort, Sir John had with him his own faithful body-guard\r\nof half a dozen men chosen from amongst the Suanni hunters, men upon\r\nwhom he could depend in any emergency.\r\n\r\nThere was no important departure on the journey to Marákesh from\r\nthe routine observed on entering the successive provinces. On each\r\noccasion the ‘Bashador’ was received by the Governor or Khalífa\r\nwith an escort varying in number, according to the strength and\r\nimportance of the province, from about twenty-five to a hundred men,\r\nwho invariably indulged in a prolonged display of ‘lab el barod,’\r\nwith the inevitable concomitants of dust, noise, and delay. Each\r\nevening too, on arrival in camp, supplies of food in the form of\r\n‘mona’ were brought and presented with the usual formalities. The\r\nSheikh offered the ‘mona’ in the name of the Sultan, and Sir\r\nJohn always made a little speech of thanks to the donors.\r\n\r\nThe route followed for the next two days lay in a south-west\r\ndirection, over an undulating country cultivated with wheat, barley,\r\nbeans, and maize; and men were ploughing with oxen, or sometimes even\r\nwith a camel and donkey yoked together. A little girl followed each\r\nplough dropping ‘dra,’ or millet-seed, into the furrows. Maize is\r\none of the chiefs exports, since the prohibition of its exportation\r\nwas removed at the instance of Sir John in 1871. The soil was a rich,\r\ndark, sandy loam, thickly studded with limestones: these had, in\r\nsome parts, been removed and piled up, forming rubble walls round\r\nthe crops. Fig-trees and a few palms, scattered here and there,\r\nscarcely relieved the flatness of the landscape.\r\n\r\nOn entering the hilly country of Erhamna on April 2, two horsemen of\r\nDukála, with a couple of falcons, joined the cavalcade. They told\r\nSir John that they had received orders from the Sultan to show him\r\nsome sport; but they expressed their fear that the birds would not\r\nstrike the game, as it was the moulting season and they were not in\r\ngood feather.\r\n\r\nA line of horsemen was formed, and, after riding half an hour, a\r\n‘kairwan’ or stone plover was started. The falcon was thrown up,\r\nand soon stooped but missed her quarry. The plover seemed so paralysed\r\nby the attack that it settled in the grass, and was only compelled\r\nwith difficulty by the horsemen to rise. In the second flight the\r\nfalcon struck the plover, whose throat was cut, and the hawk was\r\ngiven a few drops of blood. Another trial was made, but the hawks\r\nseemed dull, and only came back and lighted near their masters. The\r\nfalconers therefore were dismissed with a gift and many thanks. Thus\r\nthe hopes we had entertained of finding a great bustard and pursuing\r\nit with the falcons was not realised, as none were met with. But,\r\non the return of the sportsmen to the regular track, Miss A. Hay,\r\nwho had remained near Lady Hay’s litter, informed them that she had\r\nseen several of these gigantic birds, which had crossed their path.\r\n\r\nHunting with falcons is in Morocco a Royal sport, and no subject of\r\nthe Sultan, unless he be a member of the Royal family, can hunt with\r\nthem, without being especially granted the privilege. A few years\r\nbefore this, the Sultan sent Sir John a gift of two falcons—and\r\nwith them a falconer, capable of catching and training others,\r\nto instruct him in the sport. The novelty proved interesting for a\r\ntime; but in comparison with pig-sticking, coursing and shooting,\r\nit was found wanting, and the falcons soon ceased to be more than\r\nmere pets at the Legation.\r\n\r\nSir John, who was a great admirer of these birds, used to relate the\r\nfollowing legend and its curious verification in his own personal\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that no one of the name of Hay should kill or\r\ninjure a falcon. The tradition is founded on the following tale.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Loncarty in 980 the Danish army was certainly\r\nrouted by the Scots. Yet, at the commencement of this battle,\r\nthe Danes had been victorious and drove the Scots before them,\r\npell mell, towards a narrow pass. Here three stalwart Highlanders,\r\na father and his two sons, had taken their stand and rallied their\r\nfugitive countrymen. Then, placing themselves at their head, they\r\nled them in an onslaught on the Danes, whom they routed.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, the King of the Scots, Kenneth III, sent for the three\r\nmen, and, learning from them that they—who were farmers—had been\r\noccupied in ploughing when they saw the Scots in retreat, and then\r\njoined in the fray, he exclaimed, ‘Henceforward you shall be called\r\nGaradh!’ which in Gaelic signifies bulwark or fence. Later this name\r\nwas transformed to De la Haye by members of the family who emigrated\r\nto Normandy and, establishing themselves there, joined the Conqueror\r\nwhen he came to England. Subsequently it was modified into Hay.\r\n\r\nKing Kenneth ennobled Garadh, and offered him a grant of land of\r\nhis own selection. Garadh prayed the King to grant him whatever\r\nland his falcon might traverse, till it alighted, if thrown off at\r\nLoncarty. His prayer was granted. The falcon flew from Loncarty and\r\nalighted on the Carse of Gowry—as indeed might have been expected,\r\nsince Garadh was wont to hunt with falcons and frequently fed his\r\nbirds on that height. This large property was long held by the Hay\r\nfamily, but the greater part passed into other hands during the\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\nMy father, who told me this legend, added a caution against ever\r\ninjuring the bird which had brought good fortune to the family,\r\nand I bore it in mind, and never fired a shot at any falcon, until\r\none day I received a letter from a naturalist in England, requesting\r\nme to find some person who would aid him in making a collection of\r\nspecimens of birds of prey, as he knew that these birds migrated\r\nnorthwards in the month of March—when the wind blows from the\r\neast—passing from Morocco, across the Straits, to the Spanish\r\ncoast, and selecting generally for the point of their departure\r\nthe Marshan—a plateau within a quarter of a mile of Tangier. From\r\nhere I have seen hundreds of birds of prey, eagles, falcons, hawks,\r\nkestrels, kites and buzzards cross the Straits during the month of\r\nMarch, flying against the east wind.\r\n\r\nBeing desirous of meeting the wishes of my friend the naturalist,\r\nI selected a spot on the Marshan, where, in a dilapidated battery,\r\nwere three or four dismounted guns, presented by King George IV to\r\na former Sultan. Here, ensconced between two of the guns, I waited\r\nthe passage of the birds and shot several kites, buzzards, kestrels\r\nand other hawks; but at first, true to my rule, spared the falcons.\r\n\r\nIt was in the days of muzzle-loaders with copper caps, and I was\r\nnot using a gun of English make.\r\n\r\nAt last, seeing a fine falcon flying towards me, I said to myself,\r\n‘What folly to believe in such silly old-womanish nonsense as that\r\na Hay must not injure a falcon—I shall test the truth of the legend\r\nby firing at one.’\r\n\r\nThe bird came towards me, I fired: the gun burst at the breech, the\r\nright-hand nipple flew out, grazing my forehead near my right eye,\r\nand my wrist was burnt. I threw down the gun, exclaiming, ‘Thank\r\nGod I was not killed! Henceforward I am a believer.’\r\n\r\nThe falcon was only slightly wounded; some few feathers fell from\r\nthe poor bird, and it continued its flight. Had it been killed,\r\nI suppose I should not have lived to tell this story!\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the party crossed the Beheira u el Gintsor,\r\na district which, twenty years ago, was uninhabited and full of\r\ngazelles, great bustard, and other game. But the present Sultan had\r\npunished a rebellious tribe by removing them from a rich land and\r\nquartering them on this barren plateau. It is now full of cattle,\r\nand patches of cultivation were to be seen here and there.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs of the district brought some greyhounds, for the purpose\r\nof hunting hare; but the attempt at sport proved a failure. Amongst\r\nthese dogs were two of the native rough-coated breed, which much\r\nresemble the Scotch deer-hound, or sleugh-hound. Curiously enough,\r\nthe Arabic word for greyhound (in Morocco) is slogi or sloki—plural\r\nslak. These particular dogs were poor and stunted in appearance,\r\nbut sometimes handsome specimens are met with. They are supposed to\r\nbe endowed with great powers of endurance.\r\n\r\nNext day, on ascending the hill of Jebíla, the city of Marákesh\r\ncame into view, with its numerous minarets; amongst which towered\r\nthe great mosque of the Kutubía—dwarfing all others by comparison.\r\n\r\nThrough the pass at the foot of the hills, called Birra\r\nBurub—evidently an ancient Berber name—they entered a forest of\r\npalms and crossed the many-arched bridge over the Tensift river. The\r\ncamp was pitched on the banks of the river, which, in the swollen\r\ntorrent, was racing past—at least a hundred yards wide—carrying\r\nwith it, now and then, palm-trees washed away by the flood.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April the Mission entered Marákesh, passing through\r\nthe beautiful forest of palms. Soon after leaving camp, they were\r\nmet by a body of a hundred cavalry, accompanied by Kaid Bu Aiesh, the\r\nsecond Chamberlain. He brought a welcome from the Sultan—‘and a\r\nthousand times welcome.’ He added that the troop which accompanied\r\nhim was entirely composed of ‘Kaids,’ or officers, who were sent\r\nas a guard of honour to the British Representative on his entry.\r\n\r\nEntering the city by the Bab Hamár, they proceeded to the summer\r\npalace of the Maimunía, where Sir John was received by the Governor\r\nof the city and other officials, and conducted to a ‘kubba’\r\nor small pavilion at the end of a long avenue in the beautiful\r\ngarden, or rather orchard, attached to the dwelling. All kinds of\r\nfruit-trees abounded, intermingled with palms and cypresses, and\r\nintersected by broad avenues of large olive-trees. The fragrance of\r\nthe orange and lemon-trees in full flower filled the air. The only\r\nflowers were the large white jasmine and the scented single rose of\r\n‘Sigelmasi’—used in making attar of roses; but both these grew\r\nin profusion.\r\n\r\nThe ‘kubba,’ the Governor said, had been prepared as Sir\r\nJohn’s bedroom. It was richly carpeted and encircled by divans. A\r\nlarge and handsome brass bed stood in a recess, while an ugly deal\r\nwashstand, apparently made for the occasion, furnished with utensils\r\nof uncouth form and colour, contrasted unfavourably with the Moorish\r\nfittings. After the authorities had taken leave, the other apartments\r\nwere investigated and found to be ample and well furnished in the\r\nMoorish style. The doors and ceilings, which were decorated with\r\narabesque work, carved and coloured, had evidently been recently\r\nrepainted. Facing the entrance to the main dwelling was a beautiful\r\nfountain, set in the wall in a horseshoe arch of tiles and delicate\r\ngeometric tracery. In the centre of the courtyard, on to which the\r\nrooms opened, was a large marble basin in which bubbled another jet\r\nof water. The archways of the doors were beautifully decorated with\r\ncarved filagree work.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 7th, as pre-arranged, Hadj Mohammed Bu\r\nAiesh, the chief Usher, announced in person that the Sultan would\r\nbe prepared to receive Sir John and the members of the Mission\r\nat 9 o’clock. This official was attired in the rich dress of a\r\nMoorish courtier. Several coloured cloth caftans, or long tunics,\r\nrichly embroidered at the edges and seams with silk, were covered\r\nby another of white cotton with flowing sleeves, and over these\r\nwas draped the creamy woollen ‘haik,’ which marks the civilian,\r\nof which the soft folds hung to the ground. His turban of spotless\r\nwhite was rolled, fold upon fold, above his brow, forming a disk of\r\nmarvellous size round the red fez which peeped above it.\r\n\r\nShortly after this announcement, a procession was formed. A double\r\nline of the irregular soldiers in their picturesque and flowing dress\r\nof all the colours of the rainbow, led the way. They were followed\r\nby Sir John, the chief Usher riding on his left, and two officers\r\nof the Askar, or regulars, walking on either side of his horse. Then\r\ncame the gentlemen of the Mission, all in uniform. The gates of the\r\npalace precincts had been closed to prevent the mob crowding in,\r\nand were only opened to admit the _cortège_. In the great court,\r\nor square, were drawn up between three and four thousand Askar,\r\nwho presented arms when the ‘Bashador’ appeared.\r\n\r\nThe scene as usual was brilliant in its barbaric pomp of led\r\nhorses handsomely caparisoned, gaily dressed attendants, many-hued\r\nsoldiery, and solemn, white-robed officials. But in curious\r\ncontrast to the gaiety of his surroundings, stood prominent an old\r\n‘deruish[46],’ with whom no one interfered. He was dirty, ragged\r\nand decrepit, perhaps deranged, for he gazed around with a strange\r\nwild air. During the Sultan’s ceremonious interview with Sir John\r\nthe ‘deruish’ stood, with uplifted hands, loudly blessing the\r\n‘Prince of believers.’\r\n\r\nNext day some of the idlers of the party visited the town. Accompanied\r\nby an escort of fourteen men and an officer, they made their way\r\nto the ‘Mellah’ or Jewish quarter, a horribly dirty place. The\r\nHebrews of Marákesh are an ugly and apparently degraded race. To add\r\nto their unsightly appearance, the men wear blue kerchiefs with white\r\nspots, tied over their heads and under their chins. Two long oily\r\ncurls hang on either side of their faces. Their greasy cloaks, blue\r\nor black, are similar to those worn by the natives of Sus, and have\r\na curious lozenge-shaped pattern in red and yellow woven across the\r\nback. Tradition relates that these cloaks were first woven by Spanish\r\ncaptives in the sixteenth century, who worked the Spanish colours on\r\nthe back of the cloaks destined for their own use. The Jewish women,\r\nwith the exception of a very few young girls, were no better looking\r\nthan the men. But their out-door dress is graceful and pleasing,\r\nas they envelop themselves in a large veil of soft white cotton\r\nof native manufacture, bordered with a broad band of silk—also\r\nwhite—which is arranged to fall in front. Three centuries ago this\r\nveil, with white or coloured silk borders, was worn by the Moslem\r\nwomen of Marákesh, who now wrap themselves, when they go abroad,\r\nin the more clumsy and less becoming heavy woollen ‘haik.’\r\n\r\nThe large escort which, when the party started, had been looked on\r\nas an absurd precaution, proved to be really necessary. Though the\r\npeople showed no incivility, the pressure of the dense crowds that\r\nthronged after the strangers would have rendered progress without\r\nan escort well nigh impossible.\r\n\r\nA few days later the whole party dined at the house of the\r\nHajib—Sid Musa. They rode thither through the deserted streets\r\nin bright moonlight, which enabled them to avoid the holes and\r\npitfalls abounding in this decaying town. Well-dressed dependants\r\nwaited at Sid Musa’s door to take their horses, and, following\r\na man with a lantern, they soon found themselves in a small but\r\nbeautiful court, with a fountain playing in a marble basin in the\r\ncentre. Near this stood five tea-kettles on little charcoal stoves,\r\nand as many diminutive tables, each bearing a tray covered with a\r\nsilk kerchief—suggestive of tea. Sid Musa and a Sheríf called\r\nthe Bakáli, a favourite of the Sultan, welcomed them, and led the\r\nway into a room furnished with two gorgeous beds, chairs, sofas,\r\nand divans covered with brocade and satin. Handsome mirrors, draped\r\nwith embroidered silken scarves, hung round the walls, which were\r\ncovered with velvet arras embroidered in gold. These hangings,\r\nwhich cover the lower portion of the walls of every respectable\r\nMoorish dwelling, and vary in richness of material according to the\r\nwealth of the owner, appear to be a remnant of their ancient life\r\nas nomad Arabs. The hanging resembles the side of the tent still\r\nin use among the Moors. The design is invariably a succession of\r\nhorse-shoe arches in different coloured materials and more or less\r\nrichly embroidered. In mosques and holy places, and in them alone,\r\nmats, often very fine, are used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter the guests had been introduced to their hosts and the usual\r\ncompliments had passed, in the course of conversation Sir John\r\nexpressed to Sid Musa his desire to visit the Atlas Mountains. With\r\nthe view of preventing the objections which are often raised by the\r\nMoorish Government when Europeans wish to penetrate into the more\r\nremote regions of Morocco, he observed that he was born and bred a\r\nhighlander and that he longed to be once more among mountains. Sid\r\nMusa and the Bakáli, being both mountaineers, quite concurred in\r\nthis sentiment and promised to aid in promoting an expedition.\r\n\r\nDinner was long delayed, and Sid Musa became restless till the\r\nSheríf informed him that the guest’s servants had been consulted\r\nregarding the feast, and that they had advised the Moorish _chef_\r\n(a coal-black slave) to reverse the usual order of a native meal;\r\nas it had been intended that the sweet dishes should be served first\r\nand the viands afterwards.\r\n\r\nAt last the signal was given and the party entered another room,\r\nwhere a table had been laid in European style.\r\n\r\nThe menu was as follows:—\r\n\r\nRoast pigeons, stuffed chickens, stewed lamb, turkey with almonds,\r\nand highly flavoured siksu[47]; olives in oil; oranges cut in sections\r\nand spiced, served as a vegetable; salad of olives and mint; eggs\r\npoached with olives and oil; chicken fricassée, with a rich egg\r\nsauce; chickens with red butter—a piquante sauce; stewed mutton\r\nwith fried eggs; chickens stewed with almonds and sweetened.\r\n\r\nDry siksu; rice made up in a sort of porridge; bowls of new milk;\r\nalmond tart, flavoured with musk; pastry dipped in honey.\r\n\r\nDessert: oranges, almonds, raisins, nuts, and fourteen dishes of\r\nconfectionery, including ‘kab ghazal,’ or gazelle hoofs, little\r\ncakes of that form, from which they take their name, made of pastry\r\nthickly iced and filled with a concoction of almonds.\r\n\r\nA pleasant preparation of unripe figs, much resembling chutney,\r\nwas served with the stewed lamb.\r\n\r\nThe only beverage was water, slightly flavoured with musk and essence\r\nof citron flowers.\r\n\r\nOf this menu the turkey, the fricassées of chicken and the dry\r\nsiksu, were pronounced excellent, but some of the other dishes were\r\nhorrible concoctions.\r\n\r\nThe servants reported afterwards that as many dishes as had been\r\nserved remained outside untasted; but that the steward, observing\r\nhow little was eaten, promptly brought the banquet to a close and\r\nproduced coffee, well made, but curiously flavoured. After dinner the\r\nladies were invited to visit the harem, whither Sid Musa proceeded\r\nto conduct them. Through the horseshoe arch of the entrance showed\r\na large court planted with orange-trees, illuminated by the full\r\nmoon and by numerous lanterns held by black slave girls. Here,\r\npicturesquely grouped, the gorgeously apparelled ladies of the harem\r\nawaited them. A stream of dazzling light from a room on one side\r\nof the court played on the glittering jewels with which they were\r\nloaded, producing altogether quite a theatrical effect.\r\n\r\nThe courteous, gentle manners of these Moorish ladies and their\r\nsoft voices were very attractive. The coloured women were even\r\nmore remarkable on this score than the white, who were probably\r\nwives of inferior caste married to Sid Musa before he rose to his\r\npresent position of rank and importance, for the ‘Hajib’ was a\r\nmulatto—one of the Bokhári, previously alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these Bokhári, their rise and fall, the following\r\ntale was often related by Sir John:—\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In the days of Mulai Sliman one of the Bokhári had risen, through\r\nhis merits and by the favour of his lord, to be Master of the Horse,\r\na much coveted post at the Court, as it conferred great dignity and\r\nample emoluments on the holder. Accordingly, in the course of time,\r\nhe amassed great wealth and possessed much property and many wives\r\nand slaves.\r\n\r\n‘Unfortunately, in an evil hour, he one day gave cause of offence\r\nto his Royal Master, traduced possibly by others who were jealous\r\nof his influence and the favour hitherto shown him; or, perhaps,\r\nforgetful of his rôle as a courtier, he spoke his mind too freely at\r\nan inopportune moment. Whatever the cause, the angry Sultan roundly\r\nabused him, dismissed him from his post as Master of the Horse,\r\nand ordered him to be gone from his presence.\r\n\r\n‘Bending low, the Bokhári replied, “Your will, my Lord. May\r\nGod preserve the life of the Sultan,” and retired.\r\n\r\n‘The following Friday, as the Sultan rode back to the palace from\r\nthe chief mosque, whither he had gone in state to take part in the\r\npublic prayers at midday, he observed a tall Bokhári sweeping the\r\ncourtyard and steps leading to the palace. Struck by his appearance,\r\nthe Sultan ordered the man to approach, inquiring who he was; when,\r\nto his Majesty’s surprise, he discovered in the humble sweeper\r\nhis late Master of the Horse.\r\n\r\n‘“What do you here?” asked the Sultan.\r\n\r\n‘Prostrating himself in the dust, the Bokhári exclaimed, “I am my\r\nLord’s slave! Since the Sultan—whose life may God prolong!—has\r\ndismissed me from my post of honour about his person, I am only fit\r\nto undertake the duties of the lowest of my fellows.”\r\n\r\n‘Needless to add, the wily courtier recovered the favour of the\r\nSultan and was reinstated in his post.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon was devoted to returning the visits of the various\r\ndignitaries, and amongst others that of the Uzir Sid Dris Ben Yamáni,\r\na Minister without a portfolio, as Sid Musa had usurped his functions.\r\n\r\nAt the gateway of the Uzir’s house the visitors dismounted, and\r\nwere conducted by a black slave through a pretty garden, by paths\r\npaved with coloured tiles and shaded by vines on trellises. At the\r\nend of a long path a scene was presented which had evidently been\r\ncarefully prepared for the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn a small ‘kubba,’ seated on a chair, was the Uzir, apparently\r\ndeeply engrossed in reading a pile of letters and documents which\r\nlay open on another chair before him. A female slave stood in the\r\nbackground, with bent head and folded hands. Sir John approached,\r\nbut the Uzir continued his occupation, as if too deeply engrossed\r\nto hear or see any one. Not till the party were quite near him did\r\nhe start from his seat, as if taken unawares, to receive Sir John\r\nand bid him and all welcome; then directing the slave to remove the\r\ndocuments with care, he led the way to a prettily furnished room\r\nlooking on a small court.\r\n\r\nThe last visit was to the Governor of the city, who received Sir John\r\nat the door of his dwelling. He was a handsome young man, scarcely\r\npast boyhood, with a decided—but cruel—expression. His father, Ben\r\nDawud, the late Governor, who had died only a few weeks previously,\r\nwas detested by the populace, whom he cruelly oppressed. It was\r\ngenerally believed that Ben Dawud had been poisoned, by order of\r\nthe Sultan.\r\n\r\nThe young Basha took Sir John by the hand and led him across the\r\ncourtyard to a ‘kubba,’ furnished with tables and chairs, whence\r\nwas perceived—with dismay—preparations for a feast in an opposite\r\nroom. The young man, who seemed shy, was much relieved when Sir John\r\ninquired what sort of a garden he had, and immediately led the way\r\nto another very large square court. On two sides of it were rooms;\r\nthe exquisitely chiselled archway of a fountain occupied the third,\r\nand the fourth contained a beautiful little alcove, where the Kaid of\r\nour guard and the escort were seated enjoying tea. The floor of this\r\ncourt shone like ice, and was as white, smooth, and slippery. The\r\nboy-Governor explained that it was composed of a fine white clay\r\nfound near Marákesh.\r\n\r\nWhile in this garden, so called from the orange-trees, flowering\r\nshrubs, roses and jasmine which adorned it, Sir John asked whether\r\nthe painted ceilings and doors were the work of natives of the\r\ncity. The Governor replied that what they saw was ancient, and,\r\nat a hint from his secretary, he offered to show them some rooms he\r\nwas adding to the house, also the view from the flat roof. Up narrow\r\nand steep stairs they climbed to various unfinished chambers, the\r\nceilings of which did honour to the modern artists of Marákesh. Then,\r\nafter a scramble, they reached the terrace over these rooms, which,\r\nbeing higher than the surrounding buildings, afforded us a lovely\r\nview of the whole city and the country around, the effect greatly\r\nenhanced by the deep red glow in the west, left by the setting sun,\r\nthat seemed to set the graceful palms on fire as they stood out\r\nagainst the beautiful Atlas Mountains, whose snowy ranges glowed in\r\nvarying tints of rose and purple.\r\n\r\nOn descending the visitors were conducted to the banquet prepared\r\nfor them and, with the best grace they could assume, submitted to\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\nOn April 23 Sir John had a final private audience of the Sultan,\r\nto take leave. An account of this, his last interview with Sultan\r\nSid Mohammed, was written by Sir John as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sultan received me in a ‘kubba,’ where he was seated on a\r\ndivan. As I approached, His Majesty, motioning me to a gilt arm-chair,\r\nplaced close to the divan, requested me to be seated; he then\r\ndismissed the chamberlains and other attendants. Thus we were alone.\r\n\r\nAfter a friendly conversation and thanking the Sultan for the\r\nhospitality and attention received during my stay at the Court,\r\nI said, ‘With Your Majesty’s permission, I am about to put a\r\nstrange query.’\r\n\r\n‘Kol’—‘Say on,’ said the Sultan, ‘for I know, whatever\r\nyou say, yours will be the words of a true friend, as you have\r\never been.’\r\n\r\n‘Then,’ I continued, ‘I beg to know whether Your Majesty\r\nwould desire to listen to the language of flattery, to words that\r\nwill give you joy and pleasure, to expressions of satisfaction and\r\nadmiration of all I have seen and learnt during my long residence\r\nin Your Majesty’s dominions; or whether Your Majesty would elect\r\nthat I should speak out the truth and make known, without reserve,\r\nthat which may give Your Majesty pain, distress, and even, it may\r\nbe feared, offence?’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan, looking very grave, replied, ‘This is the first time\r\nin my life that I have been asked by any man whether I would choose\r\nto hear what might give me pain, or even offence, or to listen to\r\nthat which may please or flatter me. I select the former.’\r\n\r\nI bowed and said, ‘Before I proceed further, will you graciously\r\npromise not to take offence at the language I am about to hold, and\r\nthat I shall not lose Your Majesty’s good opinion and friendship\r\nthrough rashness of speech?’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan repeated, ‘Say on. You have been, are, and will ever\r\nremain a true friend.’\r\n\r\n‘I will premise,’ I then said, ‘by declaring that the\r\nadministration of the Government in Morocco is the worst in\r\nthe world.’ The Sultan looked startled and frowned. ‘The\r\npresent system and form of government were not introduced by Your\r\nMajesty—nor indeed by your sire or grandsire—and therefore Your\r\nMajesty is not responsible for the wretched impoverished state of this\r\nfine country and of the population over which Your Majesty reigns. The\r\nform of Government was inherited from your forefathers. After their\r\nwithdrawal from Spain—where, for centuries, they had led the van\r\nof the world in art, science, literature and agriculture—they\r\nset aside, on their return to the “Moghreb,” the just laws and\r\nadministration of Government which had made them the grand people they\r\nwere, and—I will add—might become again. Their descendants inherit\r\nthe same blood, bone, and brain; therefore it is to be inferred\r\nthat, under a just Government, with security of life and property,\r\nthe Moorish people might again rise and become, as their ancestors\r\nwere, one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world.\r\n\r\n‘At the present time the Government of Morocco is like a community\r\nof fishes. The giant fish feed upon those that are small, the\r\nsmaller upon the least, and these again feed on the worms. In like\r\nmanner—the Uzir and other dignitaries of the Court, who receive no\r\nsalaries, depend for their livelihood upon speculation, trickery,\r\ncorruption, and the money they extort from the Bashas of provinces\r\nand other Governors.\r\n\r\n‘The Bashas likewise are enriched through peculation from tithes\r\nand taxes and extortion from Sheikhs, wealthy farmers, and traders. A\r\nman that becomes rich is treated as a criminal. Neither his life,\r\nproperty, nor family are secure.\r\n\r\n‘Sheikhs and other subordinate officials subsist upon what they\r\ncan extort from the farmers and peasantry.\r\n\r\n‘Then again, even the gaolers, who are not paid, gain their\r\nlivelihood by extorting money from the prisoners, who, when they\r\nare paupers, are taught to make strong baskets, which are sold by\r\nthe gaolers chiefly for their own benefit.\r\n\r\n‘How can a country—how can a people—prosper under such a form\r\nof Government?\r\n\r\n‘The tribes are in a constant state of rebellion against their\r\nBashas. When the Sultan resides in his northern capital of Fas,\r\nthe southern tribes rebel; and when he marches South to the city\r\nof Marákesh, eating up the rebels and confiscating their property,\r\nthe northern tribes rebel. The armies of the Sultan, like locusts,\r\nare constantly on the move ravaging the country—to quell revolt.\r\n\r\n‘Agriculture is destroyed. The farmers and peasantry only grow\r\nsufficient grain for their own requirements, and rich lands are\r\nallowed to lie fallow because the farmers know the crops would\r\nbe plundered by the Bashas and Sheikhs. Thus it happens also with\r\nthe cattle and horses; breeding is checked, since the man who may\r\nbecome rich through his industry is treated as a criminal and all\r\nhis possessions are taken from him. As in the fable, the goose is\r\nkilled to get the golden eggs.\r\n\r\n‘With dominions as extensive as those of Spain or France, with a\r\nrich soil which can produce all that can be grown in Europe, Morocco\r\nis poor and weak—even compared with the lesser nations like Denmark\r\nor Holland, which kingdoms do not possess a third of the land Morocco\r\nhas; while, half the year, the ground in these Northern countries\r\nis covered with snow and ice. Yet they have revenues tenfold that\r\nof Morocco, highly disciplined armies, and formidable navies: they\r\nhave roads, bridges, railroads, with cities and towns containing\r\npalaces, handsome well-paved streets lit by gas, and other modern\r\nimprovements, such as are to be seen in the largest capitals of the\r\nworld. The just administration of the laws and security of life and\r\nproperty have produced this state of welfare, and the people are\r\ncontent and happy and do not rebel. The wealth of these countries\r\nis always on the increase. No Sovereign, Minister, Governor, or\r\nother high official can take from any man a stiver of money, or\r\nan inch of land. Every officer employed by the Sovereign is paid,\r\nand therefore does not depend for his livelihood, as in Morocco,\r\nupon peculation, extortion, bribery and corruption.’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan here remarked that his subjects were an ignorant and\r\nlawless people, quite unfit to be governed in the lenient manner\r\nI had described; that unless they were treated with the greatest\r\nseverity and were not allowed to enrich themselves, they would show\r\na more rebellious spirit than they do even at the present time. A\r\nlenient administration, he repeated, was not suited to the wild\r\nraces of Morocco.\r\n\r\nTo this I replied, ‘At Your Majesty’s request, I applied in\r\npast years to the British Government for permission to allow two\r\nhundred of Your Majesty’s subjects to be sent to Gibraltar,\r\nfor the purpose of being instructed in the drill and discipline\r\nof the British foot-soldier. The British Government acceded to\r\nYour Majesty’s request; a body of two hundred Moors was sent\r\nto Gibraltar and remained there between two and three years, the\r\nmen being occasionally changed as they acquired a knowledge of\r\ndrill. I wish to know whether Your Majesty selected these men from\r\na superior, educated class, who had the reputation of being orderly\r\nand intelligent, or whether they were chosen after inquiry into\r\ntheir intelligence, past character, and behaviour?’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan replied, ‘No; the men were selected at random from\r\nvarious tribes, so that there might be no ground for jealousy.’\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ I said, ‘two hundred Moors remained for nearly\r\nthree years at Gibraltar. They had good clothing given them,\r\nand a quarter of a dollar (a shilling) a day was allowed each man\r\nby Your Majesty. The British Government gave them tents to live\r\nin. During the time they were stationed in Her Majesty’s garrison\r\nthere were only two cases in the police court against them for\r\ndissolute conduct. Colonel Cameron, under whose superintendence\r\nthey were placed, said they learnt their drill as quickly and\r\nwell as Englishmen. They were sober, steady, and attentive to their\r\nduties. (“With 20,000 such men I could march to Madrid to-morrow,”\r\nsaid the Colonel.) This tends to show that Your Majesty’s subjects,\r\nliving under a just and humane Government, having, as these had,\r\nproper provision made for their livelihood, are not a lawless or even\r\ndisorderly people, and that they are capable of being transformed,\r\nunder a good Government, into the grand warriors which their ancestors\r\nwere in Spain.’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan smiled, and said, ‘“Hak”—True. Your arguments\r\nare certainly convincing. Point out the remedy. Select the man from\r\namongst my Wazára (viziers), or other officers of the Court, on whom\r\nyou think I could depend to introduce a new form of administration. I\r\nbelieve,’ he continued, ‘that if I were to tell my Wazára that,\r\nfor the future, I should allot them and other officers of the Court\r\nsalaries, and put a stop to bribery and peculation, they would be\r\nthe first to rebel against my authority and to oppose any change in\r\nthe administration.’\r\n\r\nI replied, ‘I know not the Uzir, or other persons in authority, whom\r\nI could suggest should be employed to aid in carrying out a reform in\r\nthe Government. Your Majesty—like the late Sultan Mahmud of Turkey\r\nand the great Khedive of Egypt, Mehemet Ali—will have yourself to\r\ntake the sword in one hand and the balance of Justice in the other.\r\n\r\n‘Make an example of any man who dares to oppose Your Majesty’s\r\nwill and determination to improve the state of your subjects. The\r\nlatter, when they learn Your Majesty’s desire for their welfare,\r\nwill rise in a body to support you in getting rid of the tyrants, who\r\nare now grinding them into dust and squeezing out their life-blood.\r\n\r\n‘In the cause of humanity and to save the lives of thousands of men,\r\nwomen and children, now impoverished and starved by a cruel system\r\nof extortion, Your Majesty will have to act with great severity\r\nand make a manifest example of some of the Uzirs and Bashas, thus\r\nstriking terror into the hearts of other dignitaries of your Court,\r\nwho may be inclined to oppose your reforms.\r\n\r\n‘Can I speak out,’ I then asked, ‘without risk of my words\r\nbeing publicly reported?’\r\n\r\n‘Speak,’ said the Sultan; ‘what passes now between us shall\r\nbe kept secret.’\r\n\r\n‘If,’ I then continued, ‘I were chief Uzir and elected by\r\nYour Majesty to carry out the proposed reforms, I should probably\r\ncause more heads to fall in a month than have been cut off during\r\nthe whole of Your Majesty’s reign, and still I should feel that I\r\nwas acting humanely by saving the lives and property of the innocent,\r\nand promoting the welfare and happiness of the millions over whom Your\r\nMajesty reigns. A cancerous disease can only be arrested by the knife,\r\nin the hands of a skilful and humane surgeon. But publish to the world\r\nthat I have held such language, and the so-called humanitarians of\r\nmy country would demand my recall as British Minister in Morocco.’\r\n\r\n‘Prepare for me,’ said the Sultan, ‘a secret memorandum on\r\nthe form of Government you would propose, the salaries to be paid\r\nto the Uzir and chief officers of my Court, to Bashas and other\r\nofficials in the provinces. I will take it into consideration and\r\ncommence gradually to introduce reforms in the administration of\r\nthe Government of the provinces; and then I shall, in due course,\r\nintroduce reform also at the Court by the payment of the Uzir, &c.,\r\nand punish severely peculation or corrupt practices.’\r\n\r\nI gave the Sultan a rough outline of the first steps that should be\r\ntaken by payment of Governors and other functionaries to collect taxes\r\nand tithes—to be paid direct into the Treasury, and not through the\r\nGovernors—recommending that receipts should be delivered to all\r\npersons who paid taxes, &c., and that these collectors should also\r\nbe empowered to take all fines, imposed by Governors or Sheikhs on\r\ncriminals, and pay them into the Treasury, which would tend to check\r\nthe rapacity and injustice of Governors in imposing heavy and unjust\r\nfines, which at the present time they appropriate to their own use.\r\n\r\nI reminded the Sultan that it was at my suggestion, when the\r\nConvention of Commerce of 1856 was concluded, that the salaries of the\r\nCustoms Officers were greatly increased and, at the same time, steps\r\ntaken to prevent the wholesale robbery of the receipts of Custom;\r\nand that he, the Sultan, had told me that, since my advice had been\r\nfollowed, the revenues derived from the Customs had greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan said, ‘Yes, I remember, and also that I have said that\r\nsince the conclusion of the Convention of 1856 with Great Britain,\r\nthough we pay half the revenues of Customs to Spain on account\r\nof the war debt, and a quarter, on account of a loan received,\r\nto Great Britain, yet the amount of revenue paid into the Treasury\r\nat the present time is greater than before the conclusion of that\r\nConvention, and the trade of Morocco with England and other countries\r\nhas trebled in value.’\r\n\r\n                              · · · · · ·\r\n\r\n‘The day after this conversation with the Sultan,’ writes Sir\r\nJohn, ‘I left Marákesh. The camp was to be pitched about twelve\r\nmiles from the city, and we started early in the morning. About an\r\nhour later, one of the escort, looking back, exclaimed, ‘I see a\r\nhorseman coming along the plain at full gallop. I should think he\r\nis a messenger from the Court.’ And thus it proved.\r\n\r\n‘I have been dispatched,’ said the breathless horseman, ‘by\r\nthe Uzir, Sid Mohammed Ben Nis (the Minister of Finance) and the\r\nSheríf Bakáli, who have been ordered by the Sultan to convey\r\nto Your Excellency a message from our Lord; and they wish to know\r\nwhether they are to continue their journey to the camp or whether\r\nyou might be disposed to await their arrival on the road?’\r\n\r\n‘See,’ I replied, ‘there is a fig-tree near the road, I will\r\nsit beneath it and await the Uzir and the Sheríf: go back and tell\r\nthem so.’\r\n\r\nSending on the rest of the party, I, with one of my daughters and\r\ntwo of the escort, awaited the functionaries, who arrived about a\r\nquarter of an hour after I was seated.\r\n\r\nBen Nis began the conversation as follows:—\r\n\r\n‘This morning I was sent for by the Sultan, who ordered me to convey\r\nto you the following message:—His Majesty said he had not slept all\r\nnight, but lay awake pondering over all you had said to him; that he\r\nfeels more convinced than ever that you are a true friend of himself\r\nand his people, and, I am desired to add, His Majesty thanks you.’\r\n\r\nI replied, ‘Convey to His Majesty the expression of my gratitude\r\nfor having deigned to dispatch such high functionaries with the very\r\nflattering message you have now delivered. It is a great consolation,\r\nfor I learn thereby that His Majesty is satisfied that what I have\r\nsaid was solely prompted by feelings of good-will and friendship.’\r\n\r\nBen Nis remarked, ‘The Sultan was in such a hurry to dispatch us\r\nthat he had not time to tell us the language you had held to His\r\nMajesty, and which had prevented him from sleeping, so I shall feel\r\nobliged if you will communicate it to me.’\r\n\r\n‘It would not,’ I replied, ‘be regular or proper that I\r\nshould make known to any one, without the Sultan’s consent,\r\nthe confidential communication I have had the honour of making to\r\nHis Majesty. Go back, and say such was my reply to your request,\r\nand you can then ask His Majesty, if you please, the purport of\r\nour conversation.’\r\n\r\nBen Nis looked sullen and angry, but the Sheríf smiled and said,\r\n‘The Bashador is right. It is for the Sultan to tell us, if\r\nhe will.’\r\n\r\nBen Nis then observed, ‘The reason why I am very anxious to know\r\nwhat passed yesterday is, that after your long private audience,\r\nthe Sultan gave orders that all the Wazára and chief officers of the\r\nCourt, as also the Bashas of provinces who happen to be at Marákesh,\r\nshould assemble in the Meshwa (Court of Audience).\r\n\r\n‘When we were all assembled, His Majesty appeared and addressed\r\nus thus:—\r\n\r\n‘“You are all a set of thieves and robbers, who live by\r\npeculation, bribery, corruption and plunder. Go away!”\r\n\r\n‘All present at the Meshwa therefore drew the conclusion that the\r\nlanguage you may have held had caused His Majesty to thus harangue\r\nus.’\r\n\r\nTo this I replied, ‘Go, as I said before, and ask His Majesty\r\nto tell you of the language I held to him. I cannot and shall not\r\ndo so.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return journey from Marákesh to Mogador afforded no new features\r\nof special interest. On May 2 the sea was reached. Miss Hay describes\r\nher father’s entry in her diary:—\r\n\r\n‘We were met by the Lieutenant-Governor of the province of Haha\r\nand a large body of horse, who after the usual salutations formed up\r\nin our rear. Again another body of mounted men appeared, led by the\r\nGovernor of Haha in person. As the latter advanced to greet Sir John,\r\na number of horsemen, who had been concealed on the road in front,\r\ndashed forward at a gallop and passed us, firing. This startling\r\nform of salute was intended to convey a compliment.\r\n\r\n‘Next came the Governor of the town with another troop of horse and\r\npersonally attended by a number of running footmen. Drawn up on one\r\nside of the road was a long irregular line of wild mountaineers on\r\nfoot, all armed with long guns and handsome daggers, their blue and\r\nwhite jelabs kilted short—so as not to impede their movements—by\r\nmeans of gay leather belts, and bedizened with many and gay leather\r\npouches and bags.\r\n\r\n‘Before these mountaineers stood a tall old man playing on a reed\r\nflute, a sweet and harmonious, though scarcely a warlike instrument,\r\nbut a great favourite with all the native mountain tribes. The\r\nvarious troops of horse having fallen in, the open plain presented a\r\nbeautiful and animated sight. Flying either past or to meet us, came\r\nevery moment the charging troopers in their brilliant flowing drapery,\r\nfiring when close to Sir John. In front of us moved the mountaineers,\r\nalso firing as they performed the different and curious gun-dances\r\nof their tribes; or, if natives of Sus, twirling and throwing their\r\nloaded guns and naked daggers high in the air to catch them as\r\nthey fell.\r\n\r\n‘The whole town had turned out to see the show, and when we came\r\nwithin sight of the walls, the batteries fired a salute, to which\r\nresponded the joyous “zagharit” of the women who thronged beneath\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\n‘During this ceremonious entry a curious incident occurred. One\r\nof the escort cried ‘Jackal!’ and, slinking along before us,\r\nwe saw one of these beasts hurrying away. In a moment, dignity and\r\netiquette were forgotten, and Sir John, followed by all the riders\r\nof our party and a number of the troopers, dashed in pursuit. They\r\nfollowed till the jackal reached a hollow among the sands, where the\r\nMoors pulled up, saying there was a quicksand at the bottom which\r\nwould bear a jackal but not a horseman.\r\n\r\n‘Beneath the walls, Sir John was received by the civil\r\nfunctionaries, mounted, as became men of peace, on sleek mules. The\r\ncrowd was now so dense that the escort had to force a passage through\r\nthe people to enable us to enter the town gates, which were shut\r\nimmediately after, to keep back the rabble for a time. The terraces\r\nand balconies of the houses were crowded, principally with Jewesses\r\nattired in all the splendour of their rich native dress. We rode to\r\nthe Consulate, where we stayed the night, and next day re-embarked\r\non board H.M.S. Lively.\r\n\r\n‘It was Sir John’s intention to call at some of the ports on\r\nhis return voyage, and Saffi—more correctly E’Sfi, or “the\r\npure”—was the first to be visited.\r\n\r\n‘Off this port we arrived early the following day in fine weather,\r\nthough a heavy sea was rolling on to the shore from the Atlantic. The\r\nlanding however was effected without difficulty, in spite of the rocks\r\nwhich beset the entrance to the little port. On these rocks men were\r\nstationed who directed the boat’s course, by shouts and signs,\r\nthrough the narrow passage, and warned them when to pause and when\r\nto take advantage of a lull between two high waves.\r\n\r\n‘Sir John met with a cordial reception from the authorities,\r\nand a banquet was offered to the Mission by the British Vice-Consul\r\nand residents; but just as the party had seated themselves at table\r\nto enjoy their kindly hospitality, a messenger arrived in haste to\r\nsay the sea was rising, and, if we wished to regain the ship, not a\r\nmoment must be lost. The result was a hurried flight to the beach,\r\nwhere two large surf-boats, manned by natives, were prepared. Into\r\nthese the party were stowed, each person having first been provided\r\nwith a life-belt by a kind resident, though had any accident occurred,\r\nthe life-belts could only have floated bruised and mangled bodies\r\nashore, so numerous and cruel were the rocks on all sides. The\r\nbar continued to rise, and the authorities and residents tried to\r\ndissuade Sir John from attempting to cross; but he, knowing what a\r\nlong detention might follow, and never inclined to brook the least\r\ndelay, decided on an immediate start. Extra scouts were stationed on\r\nthe rocks. The steersmen, both old men, with keen grave faces and\r\nflowing white beards, took their places in the boats. The rowers,\r\ntwelve to each boat, stood to their short sweeps, each with a foot on\r\nthe bench before him, the passengers crouching quietly at the bottom\r\nof the boats. The chief of the scouts from his post, on a pinnacle\r\nof rock which commanded the perilous and tortuous passage through\r\nthe bar, raised his arms to Heaven and prayed aloud for Divine aid\r\nand blessing, the crowd and rowers listening in devout silence and at\r\nthe close of the invocation joining heartily in the final “Amín.”\r\nThen at a signal we started. Each immense breaker threatened to swamp\r\nus, yet we rose and fell safely on the great waves while struggling\r\nnearer to the narrow dangerous passage through the rocks, yet holding\r\nback and waiting for the signal to pass, while from the shore rose\r\nthe cries of the crowd appealing to God and “Sidna Aisa” (Our\r\nLord Jesu) to help and protect us. At last the signal was given,\r\nand, like a flash, the first boat passed through and was safe in\r\nthe open before another great breaker thundered in. The second boat\r\nfollowed a few minutes later, and when clear of the bar the rowers\r\nof each boat, raising their hands to Heaven in a solemn “fatha,”\r\nthanked God and Sidna Aisa for help in the hour of need.\r\n\r\n‘As the sea was so high it was judged useless to attempt to cross\r\nthe bar at Rabát, and the Lively returned direct to Tangier.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                    ASCENT OF THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his return from the Mission to Marákesh, which has been\r\ndescribed in the previous chapter, Sir John, writing to Sir Henry\r\nLayard on May 24, 1873, gives an epitome of his labours at the Court,\r\nand refers to the expeditions undertaken to the Atlas Mountains\r\nduring his travels.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We returned,’ he says, ‘from our travels on the 8th inst. in\r\nbetter health than when we started. The weather was cool, and no\r\nrain fell to stop our march except on one day.\r\n\r\n‘I had no instructions from the Foreign Office except to deliver\r\nmy new credentials; but I took advantage, of course, of my visit to\r\nthe Court to place our relations on a better footing, and I flatter\r\nmyself I have succeeded, as I have settled, or put in the proper\r\ngroove for settlement, a host of pending claims and grievances.\r\n\r\n‘Tissot was at the Court at the same time as myself, and we\r\nmarched hand in hand in all questions affecting common interests,\r\nor, as Tissot described the position of the Moorish Government, like\r\nthat of a wild boar with a hound hanging on each ear. The Moors were\r\nastonished to find the French and British Representatives in perfect\r\nunion and showing no signs of petty jealousy about etiquette in forms;\r\nin fact, we took our precautions of warning Moorish and _our own_\r\nofficials that we insisted upon no attention being shown or form\r\nobserved to one or the other which differed.\r\n\r\n‘The Sultan and his Ministers were most courteous and\r\nhospitable. Nothing could be more pleasing than His Majesty’s\r\nmanner and language to myself in a private audience. He conversed\r\nwith great good sense, but he declared his policy to be _conservative_\r\nin the strictest sense of the word.\r\n\r\n‘In reply to the proposals made by Tissot and myself for various\r\nreforms and improvements, His Majesty said to me, “We and thou\r\nunderstand very well that all you suggest is very excellent, and might\r\nbe most beneficial in developing the resources of our dominions; but\r\nthe eminent men (Ulama, &c.) do not desire that we should introduce\r\nthe innovations of Europe into this land, nor conform ourselves\r\nwith Christian usages. We made certain promises on our accession to\r\nthe throne, and unless my councillors alter their views, we cannot,\r\nwithout endangering our position.” When I alluded to Turkey and\r\nEgypt, he intimated that those Governments had no doubt increased\r\nin power and wealth, but that their independence was shaken.\r\n\r\n‘Tissot received a telegram from his Government regarding some\r\nfrontier conflict near Taza, stating that a large force had been\r\nsent by the Governor of Algeria to enter Morocco and chastise the\r\npredatory tribes. Thiers stopped the march of the force, until Tissot\r\ncould be referred to. He has arranged all matters satisfactorily with\r\nthe Sultan, to whom he brought the “Grand Cordon of the Legion of\r\nHonour.” . . .\r\n\r\n‘Whilst the Sultan was digesting my memoranda on various affairs,\r\nwe made an expedition to the slopes of the Atlas. My son reached the\r\nsnow, but was obliged to beat a rapid retreat, as the mountaineers\r\nwere in revolt against the Sultan. The Shloh tribes of the Atlas,\r\nwho were submissive to the Sultan, were most kind and hospitable\r\nto us. They gave us all a hearty welcome, and I was delighted on\r\nfinding that I was known to all these wild fellows as being a friend\r\nto the Moors and “a just man.” The valleys of the Atlas are very\r\nbeautiful and fertile. The inhabitants live in two-storied houses,\r\nsomething like the Swiss, only very rude in form. They are a far\r\nsuperior race to their conquerors, the Arabs.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this letter shows, the hope which Sir John had entertained of\r\nreturning with the Mission through the Atlas mountains and thence\r\nto Mogador was not completely fulfilled, as a rising of the tribes\r\nin that district rendered the expedition unsafe. Sid Musa however\r\nsuggested that before leaving Marákesh, an expedition of a few days\r\nmight be organised to visit ‘Uríka,’ on the slope of the Atlas\r\nnearest to the city. This was arranged, and on the morning of April 17\r\nthe party left Marákesh by the beautiful Bab el Mahsen, or Government\r\ngate, the fine old arch of which, built of red stone engraved with\r\nArabic inscriptions, is said to have been brought by the Moors from\r\nSpain,—an improbable legend founded on the fact that Jeber was\r\nthe architect. The narrative is given from Miss Hay’s Diary.\r\n\r\n‘As we passed the Sultan’s palace, which, by the way, is said\r\nto contain a female population amounting to a thousand women (of\r\nall colours!), the standard-bearer lowered the banner as a mark of\r\nrespect. This salute was also accorded when passing the tombs of\r\n“saléhin,” or holy men.\r\n\r\n‘On this trip, as also on the subsequent return journey to Mogador,\r\nthe usual red banner that precedes an envoy was replaced by a green\r\none. This latter is the emblem of the Sultan’s spiritual authority,\r\nand there was a peculiar significance and compliment in its being sent\r\nto precede the Representative of Great Britain and of a Christian\r\nSovereign. The Sultan also sent his own stirrup-holder, a fine old\r\nBokhári, to attend Sir John, as he would his Royal Master, an office\r\nwhich the noble old man punctiliously fulfilled. He was always near\r\nSir John’s person, prepared to alight and hold his stirrup when\r\nrequired, as he was wont to do for the Sultan. The old man had many a\r\nquaint tale to relate, and Sir John would sometimes summon him to his\r\nside and encourage him to talk of his recollections and experiences.\r\n\r\n‘The valley of the Atlas, whither we were bound, was in sight due\r\nSouth. Our way at first lay across the plain and along the line of\r\ndeep and dangerous pits that mark the track of the aqueduct which\r\nsupplies Marákesh with water, said to come from the hills thirty\r\nmiles distant. These pits are about twenty feet in diameter and of\r\nequal depth, and one of our party had a narrow escape one day, during\r\na wild and general race across the plain, riding nearly directly\r\ninto one of these chasms concealed by long grass. Fortunately the\r\nclever little Barb swerved, and, jumping, cleared the pit to one side.\r\n\r\n‘Tradition states that formerly, in remote times, an aqueduct\r\nbrought water underground direct from the Atlas to the city. This\r\nbecame blocked and damaged, but could not be repaired or cleared\r\nowing to its great depth below the surface. Therefore one of the\r\nancient rulers, to collect the water it supplied, made great wells\r\nor reservoirs some fifteen miles from Marákesh, and closed all the\r\nfountains and springs in their vicinity. From these the present water\r\nsupply was brought to the city, and originally flowed in through\r\nfour hundred canals or aqueducts. These, Arabian historians relate,\r\nwere the work of 20,000 Christian captives.\r\n\r\n‘The greater extent of the plain was in grass, studded with thorny\r\n“sidder” bushes; but some crops of barley and beans looked\r\nflourishing, and here and there, where irrigation had been attempted\r\nby means of watercourses from the river “Ghemáts” vegetation\r\nwas luxuriant beneath olive and other fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n‘At about 4 p.m. the country assumed a more pleasing aspect as we\r\npassed the villages of the Shloh tribe of Mesfíwa. These Shloh,\r\nlike the natives of Sus and Rif, are all of Berber race. Neither\r\nPhœnicians, Goths, Romans nor Arabs ever succeeded in bringing them\r\ncompletely under subjection, for they retreated before the conquerors\r\nto the mountains, and in these highland fastnesses maintained their\r\nindependence. With the exception of a few tribes they owe no political\r\nallegiance to the Sultan, but acknowledge his spiritual suzerainty as\r\nthe recognised head of the Mohammedan religion in Morocco, in virtue\r\nof his direct descent from the Prophet. They altogether differ in\r\nappearance from the Arabs, and no affinity can be traced between the\r\nBerber and the Arabic languages, excepting in words connected with the\r\nMohammedan religion which were introduced when the Berbers adopted\r\nthe creed of Islam. In place of tents the Shloh live in houses, of\r\none or two stories, built of mud and stone without mortar, the earth\r\nof this district having the peculiar quality, when well beaten down,\r\nof being impermeable.\r\n\r\n‘Learned writers have disputed the origin of the Berbers, but\r\nthey seem to agree that they are not the aborigines of the country,\r\nbut displaced another and more ancient race of inhabitants. One of\r\nthe traditions of the Berbers is that their ancestors were driven\r\nout of Syria by the “Khalífa” of “Sidna Musa” (“our Lord\r\nMoses”), meaning Joshua, the lieutenant of Moses. Their country in\r\nthe South of Morocco is called generally “Sus,” and the manner\r\nof their expulsion is related in yet another legend quoted from a\r\ncommentary on the Koran.\r\n\r\n‘God said unto David, “Banish the Beraber out of this land,\r\nfor if they dwelt in hills of iron they would break them down.”\r\nWhereupon, says the story, King David placed the people on camels,\r\nin sacks called “gharaiar,” and sent them away. When they arrived\r\nat the Atlantic coast their leader called out, in the Berber tongue,\r\n“Sus”—which means let down, or empty out—so the exiles were\r\ncanted out of their sacks, and the country is thence called “Sus”\r\nto this day!\r\n\r\n‘Many of the Shloh proper names appear to have an affinity to the\r\nHebrew, if not actually of Hebraic origin, such as Ait Usi, Ait Atta,\r\nAit Emor, Ait Sisac, Ait Braim. The Hebrew equivalent of the first\r\nthree being Hait Busi, in our translation the Jebusites, Ha Hitti,\r\nthe Hittites. Ha Emori, the Amorites. Ait Sisac may be translated\r\n“Those of Isaac,” or The children of laughter. Ait Braim needs\r\nno translation.\r\n\r\n‘On our entry into Mesfíwa we were surprised to find signs of\r\nmuch more industry, and even of civilisation, than in the districts\r\ninhabited by the Arab population. Here irrigation was carefully\r\nattended to; the numerous plantations of olive and fruit-trees,\r\nas well as the fields of grain, were better cultivated; and the\r\ncondition of the bridle roads and rude bridges over the streams\r\nafforded further proof of a more intelligent and industrious people.\r\n\r\n‘Ascending the slopes we reached the camp pitched in an olive-grove\r\non a small island formed by the Ghemáts, here called the “Dad i\r\nSirr,” evidently its Berber name. We crossed with some difficulty\r\nthis mountain torrent, which foamed and swirled up to the horses’\r\ngirths. Flowing down a gorge of the Atlas running nearly North and\r\nSouth, this river then takes a north-westerly direction till it\r\njoins the Tensift, which again flows into the Atlantic near Saffi.\r\n\r\n‘On the side of a hill, about four hundred yards from the site of\r\nthe camp, lay the village Akhlij, crowned by a castle built of red\r\nstone and earth, and having five square bastions with loopholes for\r\nmusketry. In fact every house in these villages can be used as a\r\nlittle fort, the walls being pierced so that each householder can\r\ndefend himself against his neighbour, or all can combine and act\r\nagainst an invader of their stronghold. The population of Akhlij is\r\nsaid to be about 500 souls, including some forty Jews, each Jewish\r\nfamily, according to the custom of the Shloh, being under the special\r\nprotection of a Mohammedan chieftain.\r\n\r\n‘Above the spot where we were encamped rose the mountain of Zinat\r\nKar, the summit dotted with patches of snow, and, towering over\r\nall, the snowy heights of “Glaui” frowned upon the groves of\r\npalms, oranges and olives which spread below basking in the sultry\r\ntemperature of the plains.\r\n\r\n‘On our arrival in camp the Sheikh and elders of the village\r\npresented themselves, by order of the Sultan, to welcome the\r\n“Bashador.” The Sheikh, a tall man, was draped in a long, seamless\r\n“haik;” but some of his followers wore a black burnous similar\r\nto those in use among the Jews of Marákesh. The meeting took place\r\nunder the British flag—hoisted for the first time in these wild\r\nregions—before Sir John’s tent. In the evening the deputation\r\nreturned, bringing an abundant supply of provisions and forage,\r\nand, in addition, huge dishes of cooked food for the soldiers and\r\ncamp-followers. This “mona” was collected from the whole province\r\nunder the rule of Basha Grenog, comprising some fifteen “kabail,”\r\nor tribes, spread over a district about fifty miles in diameter. The\r\ntax therefore fell lightly on the inhabitants, not amounting to more\r\nperhaps than a half-penny a family, which sum would be deducted from\r\nthe payment of their annual taxes.\r\n\r\n‘This spot in the valley of Uríka, at the foot of the Atlas, is\r\nabout 500 feet above Marákesh and 2,000 feet above sea-level, and the\r\nfine air was most enjoyable. The night appeared cold, the temperature\r\nfalling below 60° Fahr. At midday it was 74° in the shade.\r\n\r\n‘There were contradictory statements as to the sport to be\r\nexpected. But, after much cross-questioning, the natives confessed\r\nthat there were no wild boar nearer than the snow; that the\r\n“audad[48],” or wild sheep, was to be found, but only on the\r\nhighest hills a couple of hours’ ride distant; and that lions and\r\nleopards were not to be seen within two days’ march, or about\r\nthirty miles further among the snowy ranges. On inquiry whether\r\nthere were any fish in the river, we were told that, later in the\r\nseason, a speckled fish about nine or ten inches long comes up from\r\nthe Tensift. This no doubt is the trout, which is found also in the\r\nmountain streams near Tetuan. On asking the Berber name for large\r\nriver fish, Sir John was surprised to hear that it is “selmen,”\r\nwhich would appear to be a cognate word to our “salmon.”’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe account of the ascent of the Atlas which follows is chiefly\r\ncompiled from notes written at the time by Mr. Drummond Hay, who\r\naccompanied the Mission, and who, with one companion, succeeded in\r\nscaling the heights and reaching the snow. An earlier ascent, but not\r\nto so high a point, was made in 1829 by Mr. E. W. A. Drummond Hay,\r\nSir John’s father. Other travellers have visited the Atlas, both\r\nbefore and since Sir John; but no Representative of a Foreign Power,\r\nit is believed, had ever yet done so, openly and with the good-will\r\nof the Sultan.\r\n\r\n‘_May 18._ After breakfast all the party, ladies included, mounted\r\ntheir horses. The son of the Sheikh, a fine handsome fellow, riding\r\na splendid black horse, led the way up the valley of Uríka, and\r\nwe rode along the banks of the torrent. On each side of the gorge\r\nrose conical hills clothed with “el aris[49],” the scented\r\n“arrar[49],” and the lentiscus or wild pistachio. The olive,\r\nwalnut, orange, apricot and vine were also abundant.\r\n\r\n‘We travelled along a path on the steep river bank, sometimes so\r\nnarrow that, if a horse had made a false step, the rider might have\r\nbeen precipitated into the torrent which foamed below. But as we\r\nadvanced the road improved, and showed signs of some knowledge of\r\nroad-making and of great care on the part of the inhabitants. Here\r\nand there it was mended with wood and stones; the large boulders\r\nwere cleared from the path and built up as walls on either side;\r\nand, where a torrent crossed the way, there was a rude bridge\r\nof one or more arches, composed of trees and branches cemented\r\nwith mud and stone. Below us flowed the river, now turbulent\r\nand shallow in its wide bed. By the banks grew numbers of trees\r\nwhich resembled silver poplars, the timber of which is used in the\r\nconstruction of their houses by the mountaineers. Their delicate\r\nfoliage contrasted pleasantly on the mountain side with the sombre\r\ngreen of the “arrar” and “aris,” which here do not seem to\r\nattain so great a height as they do in the Rif country. Mingled with\r\nthem grow the karob, or locust-tree, and the mountain ash. Numbers\r\nof wild flowers filled the hedges that hemmed in the fields or grew\r\nby the wayside; among them we recognised many English friends. There\r\nwere also several flowers new to us, particularly a lovely species\r\nof broom bearing a brilliant violet blossom with an orange centre,\r\nand another pretty, highly-scented, yellow flower all declared must\r\nbe a wild jasmine, so closely did it resemble the garden variety.\r\n\r\n‘Villages were to be seen on both sides of the gorge, and\r\none of them saluted us with a _feu de joie_ of musketry. After a\r\ngentle ascent of an hour and a half we arrived at a pretty grove of\r\nolives. Here the Sheikh insisted upon our dismounting, as he said the\r\nvillagers desired to welcome our party by giving us a feast. It was\r\nin vain the “Bashador” explained that we desired to push, as far\r\nas we could ride, up the mountains. After waiting an hour, as no food\r\nappeared, he gained his point and we were allowed to re-mount. But,\r\nto our great dismay, just at the moment of moving off, arrived\r\nsome forty villagers, every one of whom carried on his head a huge\r\nearthen platter, containing several dishes of meat and “siksu”;\r\neach dish holding sufficient to satisfy ten hungry hunters. Having\r\nexplained to these hospitable people that we had only just had our\r\nmorning repast and were most anxious to sharpen our appetites by a\r\nride up the mountain before consuming the feast, we were allowed to\r\ndepart in peace—though a solemn promise was first exacted that we\r\nwould return without fail in the evening to accept their prodigal\r\nhospitality. We then continued the gradual ascent, passing through\r\nvillages the houses of which recalled in some degree the _chalets_\r\nin Switzerland, though these were of very rude form. Many of them had\r\noverhanging eaves and open galleries on the second story, where the\r\ninmates could sit and enjoy the air and scenery, sheltered from sun\r\nor weather. Some of the houses were decorated with patterns on the\r\nwall below the roof, picked out in crossed lines such as are seen\r\nin old buildings in some parts of England and Germany. But in this\r\ninstance the lines were white on the dull background of red earth\r\nwith which these houses are built.\r\n\r\n‘The population—men, women, and children—turned out to gaze at\r\nus. But neither by word, look, or gesture was there any demonstration\r\nof fanatical or hostile feeling. The villagers seemed rather to\r\nconsider our advent to be the occasion for a holiday. A petition was\r\nsent to the “Bashador” by the boys of a school that their teacher\r\nshould be asked to grant them a holiday to behold the English. A few\r\nsilver coins to the pedagogue and the request of the “Bashador”\r\nset all the boys at liberty, and thus the rising generation of\r\nUríka will, it may be hoped, retain a friendly recollection of\r\nthe “Ingliz.”\r\n\r\n‘These mountaineers were fairer than their brethren of the plain,\r\nand some of the women comely. The latter, like their Rifian sisters,\r\ndo not hide their faces; and we are told that the state of morality\r\namongst them is of a very high standard. No female is in danger of\r\nbeing insulted, and it may be safely declared that there is a better\r\nstate of morality amongst the Berber women of Morocco than exists\r\nin England or in any other country in Europe. The women were draped,\r\nlike the men, in a long, seamless garment; but they wore it fastened\r\nby two silver brooches on the shoulders or over the breast, supporting\r\nthe folds which hung gracefully around their persons. These brooches\r\nare generally connected by long pendent silver chains. The younger\r\nwomen had long black hair, which appeared to be carefully dressed,\r\nand they showed the same love of adornment as their European sisters\r\nby decorating their tresses with poppies and other wild flowers.\r\n\r\n‘Lady Hay, who rode a mule, on learning that all must now dismount\r\nand proceed on foot if they wished to continue the ascent of the\r\nmountain, decided to remain at the village. A fine-looking Shloh,\r\nhearing of this decision, stepped forward and offered to take her\r\ninto his house. She accepted his hospitality, and was placed under\r\nthe ægis of the faithful chief of the camp, Hadj Hamed Lamarti. The\r\nrest of the party proceeded on foot.\r\n\r\n‘The dismounted horsemen of the Bokhári guard were soon blown\r\nand gave up; then the Sheikh’s son—who was rather too well fed\r\nand in bad condition—sat down, looking very grave, and tried to\r\ndissuade us from further ascent. But on we went, accompanied only\r\nby some half dozen stalwart Shloh, armed with long guns. Under the\r\nshade of a locust-tree Sir John and his daughters, having ascended\r\nsome way, came to a halt, as the air was sultry and the ascent very\r\nprecipitous. Colonel Lambton, Major de Winton, Major Hitchcock,\r\nCaptain Sawle, Mr. Hay, and Mr. Brooks plodded on, the mountaineers\r\nleading the way. The ascent was almost as steep as a vertical\r\nladder, and after climbing some 1,500 feet they began to feel much\r\nexhausted. At this point four of the party gave up, and two of the\r\nmountaineers, glad of an excuse to halt, remained to guard them.\r\n\r\n‘Captain Sawle and Mr. Hay continued their upward way, and, as\r\nMr. Hay relates, “We appeared to gain fresh wind and strength as\r\nwe ascended. On reaching the first snow we fired a shot to announce\r\nto the party our success, for in the morning there had been a great\r\ndiscussion whether the ascent to the snow could be accomplished in\r\none day.\r\n\r\n‘We reached the summit of the first high range called Zinat\r\nKar at 2 p.m., and at that moment I sprung a covey of partridges,\r\nand again signalled our arrival by a successful right and left,\r\nwhich was greeted with a yell of delight by the mountaineers who\r\naccompanied us. We could not tell what height we had reached, as\r\nmy aneroid was out of order and had stopped registering half-way;\r\nbut as far as we could judge by distance we must then have been\r\nabout 6,000 feet above the camp. To our astonishment we found here\r\nan extensive table-land with considerable cultivation, though snow\r\nwas still lying on the ground in many parts. This plateau extended\r\nto the foot of a snow-covered range which again rose abruptly beyond.\r\n\r\n‘Whilst we rested I discharged my gun at an eagle, and afterwards\r\nat a crow, which latter I killed—a curious bird with red beak and\r\nlegs. A few minutes after, when we were thinking of again continuing\r\nour route, we heard to our surprise a volley of musketry, and saw the\r\ndistant heights around us manned by armed men. Our Shloh companions\r\ninformed us that these people were the “Ahal Kubla,” or people of\r\nthe South, inhabiting the snowy range before us. This tribe does not\r\nsubmit to the Sultan’s authority, and a gun fired on a height is\r\na signal that an enemy is in sight, and consequently, we were told,\r\nin another hour we might find ourselves surrounded by these lawless\r\npeople, who were at present at feud with the Uríka, and the latter\r\ndo not venture therefore to trespass on their territory.\r\n\r\n‘The difficulty the Sultan would experience in subduing these\r\ntribes can be imagined, since the sole access to this district is\r\nby the steep ascent we had just made[50].\r\n\r\n‘Discretion being the better part of valour, we determined to beat\r\na rapid retreat, and descended the escalade as fast as our weary\r\nlimbs would carry us. At 4 o’clock we rejoined the rest of the\r\nparty under the olive-trees where we had first stopped. They had\r\njust concluded the feast and were starting for camp.\r\n\r\n‘While the climbing party were in sight Sir John and his daughters\r\nwatched them from under the shade of the locust-tree: then,\r\ndescending to the village, found Hadj Hamed waiting for them in\r\none of the little streets. He conducted them to Lady Hay, whom the\r\nvillagers had installed in the open gallery of one of their houses,\r\nlooking out on the mountains. It was very clean: there were only some\r\ndry maize husks piled in a corner and a number of beehives arranged\r\nin a row on the floor. The pillars which supported the front of the\r\ngallery were ornamented very rudely with quaint attempts at arabesque\r\ndecoration. Lady Hay said she had felt faint on arrival, and having\r\nasked for bread, they brought her a loaf and a piece of honeycomb.\r\n\r\n‘The owner of the house welcomed us warmly, and on Sir John saying\r\nthat he was much pleased with the mountaineers and considered them\r\nfar finer fellows than the Arabs, he was delighted, and tried to pay\r\nsome compliment to the English. Then he brought us in the skirt of his\r\ndress a number of freshly gathered oranges, which proved delicious.\r\n\r\n‘All the climbers now returned except Captain Sawle and Mr. Hay,\r\nand we prepared to leave our comfortable retreat; but, when Sir\r\nJohn turned to take leave of his kind host, the latter begged\r\nand implored him to wait a little longer—only a few minutes,\r\nhe pleaded. After some demur, his earnest request was acceded to;\r\nthe carpets were again spread, and all sat down. The hospitable\r\nvillager hurried away, but soon re-appeared, followed by another man,\r\neach bearing a bowl of smoking hot paste, resembling vermicelli,\r\nboiled in milk. In the centre of each dish was a little pool of\r\nmelted butter. We rather dreaded tasting the food, after our late\r\nexperience of Moorish cookery, but were agreeably surprised, when,\r\nhaving grouped ourselves round each bowl, using our own forks,\r\nwe tried the mess and found it excellent. The paste was delicate,\r\nwell boiled, and flavoured with some pungent spice, and the butter\r\nexquisitely fresh and sweet. This form of food appears to have been\r\na staple dish with the Berbers since ancient times. We did justice\r\nto this food, which was followed by a basket of hot cakes made of\r\nrye, resembling scones, accompanied by a bowl of melted butter, and\r\nthose who had the courage to dip their bread therein pronounced it\r\ngood also.\r\n\r\n‘Our host no longer made any objection when we again rose to\r\ndepart, only saying, when thanked for his hospitality, that not\r\nhaving expected us to remain at his village he had been unable to\r\nprepare better food at such short notice. He added that, should the\r\n“Bashador” desire at any future time to travel in the Atlas,\r\nhe could do so in perfect safety—especially if unaccompanied by an\r\nescort from the Moorish Government. “For,” he said, “your love\r\nof justice towards all and the kindness shown by you to our poorer\r\nbrethren, when in distress in the North (of Morocco), is known to us\r\nand we shall not forget. Come amongst us, you will ever be welcome;\r\nremain several months, hunt with us and be our guest, and no injury\r\nshall befall you or yours.”\r\n\r\n‘Touched and pleased by this kindly speech from a native Sheikh in\r\na district where few Christians had ever penetrated, Sir John and\r\nhis party rode back towards the olive-grove. As we passed through\r\nthe narrow lanes, the women and children collected in some of the\r\norchards, smiling and beckoning, and were delighted when the ladies\r\nlifted the thick white veils they wore and greeted them in return. The\r\nwomen were fair-skinned, and many of them good-looking. Here and\r\nthere we observed really pretty, graceful girls; one in particular,\r\nwhom Sir John noticed as she leant against a doorway, was quite\r\nhandsome. She was dressed in a curious “haik,” stained in\r\npatterns to represent a leopard skin, and hanging from her neck she\r\nwore a quaint, square-shaped silver ornament, with a blue stone in\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\n‘The women’s heads were covered, but they made no attempt to\r\nveil their faces. The men were generally draped in the “haik”;\r\nbut those who ran beside us, or climbed the heights, threw aside\r\nthis cumbrous garment and appeared in thin long shirts belted at the\r\nwaist. Wooden powder-flasks, covered with brightly coloured leather\r\nand studded with brass knobs, gay little shot or bullet bags, and an\r\nornamented curved dagger hung by their sides from a broad strap over\r\nthe shoulder. A long gun was invariably carried by each man. Some\r\nwere bare-headed, others had a cord tied tightly round their shaven\r\nskulls, but most of them wore a small white turban.\r\n\r\n‘On arrival at the olive-grove, at which we had promised to halt\r\non our return, we were soon seated round an enormous flat dish full\r\nof “siksu.” It would have been cold, but for the depth of the\r\ncontents; so that by digging down we reached some that was hot and\r\npalatable. Our followers assembled in twos and threes about each\r\ngreat platter and devoured the contents with the greatest avidity.\r\n\r\n‘Several of the boys, who gathered about us, we observed busily\r\nworking at a curious frame composed of a hollow cane, up which a\r\nnumber of coarse woollen threads were passed and secured at either\r\nend. Under these, the cane was encircled by a ring which held the\r\nthreads away from the rod and enabled the little workman to deftly\r\nweave in bright coloured worsted across the threads, his fingers\r\nbeing employed without any shuttle, and a small piece of wood, cut\r\nlike a comb, used to drive down each cross thread into its place,\r\nmaking various patterns as they went up the rod. On inquiring the\r\npurpose of this work we were told they were belts. Though we offered\r\nto buy any that were finished, none were forthcoming; but one of the\r\nlads brought his work to be examined, and was much startled when\r\nthe “Bashador” on returning him his frame offered him a small\r\ncoin, evidently fearing an attempt was being made to buy his work,\r\nframe and all. However he took the money readily, though shyly,\r\nwhen convinced it was only a present.\r\n\r\n‘We returned to Marákesh on the 20th; but, before leaving, received\r\na visit from some of the Jews who live amongst the mountain tribes\r\nand who wished to consult the doctor attached to the Mission. They\r\ncame up as we were all seated, grouped under the trees about the\r\ncamp. The elders kissed the heads of those of our party who were\r\ncovered; the younger, their shoulders. These Jews were dressed\r\nexactly like the Shloh amongst whom they live, with the exception\r\nthat they wore a black skull-cap. The Jewesses also were attired\r\nlike the Shloh or Arab women, but with a scarlet headdress. The\r\nmen were unarmed; but we were told that, further in the interior,\r\nthe Jews carry arms and join in tribal warfare; neither are they,\r\nthere, the oppressed people known to the lowlands of Morocco.’\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of the stories related to Sir John on the march by the Sultan’s\r\nstirrup-holder may be inserted here as exemplifying the manners and\r\ncustoms of the officials about the Moorish Court, and especially\r\nthose of the military class. The first may be called ‘A Story of\r\na Moorish Prince.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMulai Ahmed, second son of Sultan Mulai Abderahman Ben Hisham, was\r\nappointed by his father Viceroy of the districts of Beni Hassén,\r\nZair, Dukála, Shedma, &c. His residence was at Rabát.\r\n\r\nThis Prince was clever, and endowed with many good qualities, but\r\nhe was extravagant and reckless in his expenditure, and thus became\r\ndeeply indebted to the merchants and shopkeepers of Rabát; but no\r\nman ventured to press his pecuniary claims on the wayward youth. His\r\ndebtors, moreover, had only to ask some favour by which they might\r\nbe benefited in their trade, and it was immediately granted by the\r\nPrince; the favour thus conferred amply recouping them for their\r\nunpaid goods.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a visit of the Sultan to Rabát in 1848, Mulai\r\nAhmed was still Viceroy. Various complaints had been brought by the\r\ninhabitants to the Uzir, Ben Dris, against His Royal Highness for not\r\npaying his debts; but the Uzir endeavoured so to arrange matters as\r\nto avoid reporting the misconduct of the young Prince to his father.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, when the Sultan was going to mosque, an Arab from\r\nthe country called out, from a high wall—on which he had climbed\r\nto avoid being silenced by the troopers who formed the escort of the\r\nSultan—‘Oh Lord and Master, Mulai Abderahman, my refuge is in\r\nGod and in thee! I have been plundered and unjustly treated during\r\nthis your reign.’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan, restraining his horse, desired his attendants to learn\r\nwho this man was; and, after hearing their report, sent for the Uzir\r\nand directed him to inquire into the case and report thereon.\r\n\r\nOn the man presenting himself before the Uzir, the latter reprimanded\r\nhim for brawling in the streets for justice. ‘One would suppose,’\r\nsaid Ben Dris, ‘that there were no longer governors or kadis in\r\nMorocco! Whence are you? what have you to say?’\r\n\r\n‘I am an Arab from Shedma,’ the man replied. ‘I had a fine\r\nhorse, for which I had been offered by the chief of my tribe three\r\nhundred ducats, but I refused to sell; for, though a poor man, my\r\nhorse was everything to me; I would not have parted with him for all\r\nthe wealth that could be offered me. Some weeks ago I came to Rabát,\r\nand Mulai Ahmed—may God prolong his days!—in an evil hour saw my\r\nhorse, and ordered his soldiers to seize it, sending me a purse of\r\nthree hundred ducats, which however I refused to accept. For forty\r\nlong days have I been seeking justice, but can obtain hearing neither\r\nof Mulai Ahmed nor of any one else.’\r\n\r\nThe Uzir replied, ‘If your story be true, your horse shall be\r\nreturned to you; but, if false, you shall be made an example of for\r\ndaring to bring a complaint against the son of the Sultan.’\r\n\r\nThe Uzir then sent a messenger to inquire of Mulai Ahmed concerning\r\nthe matter, and by him the Prince sent reply that he knew nothing\r\nabout the horse. The Uzir was consequently about to order the Arab\r\nto be bastinadoed, when the latter begged Ben Dris to send him,\r\naccompanied by some of his—the Uzir’s—attendants, to the\r\nstables of Mulai Ahmed, where he felt sure he would find the horse;\r\nbegging that his whole tribe might, if necessary, be called upon to\r\ngive evidence respecting the identity of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe Uzir accordingly sent the Arab, with a guard, to the Prince’s\r\nstables to point out the horse, with directions that it should be\r\nbrought before him. He also sent to inform Mulai Ahmed that this\r\norder of his father the Sultan must be obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe attendants took the Arab to the stable, where he immediately\r\nrecognised his horse, but had no sooner done so than he was arrested,\r\nalong with the Uzir’s men, by some soldiers sent by Mulai Ahmed,\r\nand brought before the Prince, who had them _all_ bastinadoed and\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Uzir’s men, they reported to their master what\r\nhad taken place. The Uzir had them again bastinadoed for not having\r\ncarried out his orders, viz. to bring back the Arab and his horse\r\nin safety. Then, mounting his mule, he rode direct to the palace,\r\nwhere he recounted to the Sultan what had occurred.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty was highly incensed; his eyes flashed lightning,\r\nand his voice was as thunder. ‘Dare any son of mine disobey the\r\norders of his father? Are my people to be robbed and ill-used at\r\nhis caprice? Summon the chief kaid of our guard.’\r\n\r\nThe officer appeared. ‘Take,’ said the Sultan, ‘a saddled mule\r\nto the palace of Mulai Ahmed. Bind the Prince hand and foot. Conduct\r\nhim this day to Meknes, where he is to be imprisoned until further\r\norders. Let the Arab have his horse and an indemnity for the rough\r\ntreatment he has received. Let a proclamation be issued that all\r\npersons who have been unjustly used by Mulai Ahmed are to present\r\nthemselves to me; for there is no doubt,’ added the Sultan, ‘that\r\nis not the only case of injustice of which my son has been guilty.’\r\n\r\nThe orders of Sultan Mulai Abderahman were obeyed. The chief of the\r\nguard appeared before Mulai Ahmed with a mule saddled and bridled,\r\nand informed the Prince he was deposed from his position as Viceroy,\r\nand that he was to proceed at once with him to Meknes.\r\n\r\nAt first Mulai Ahmed refused to obey his father’s commands, but,\r\non being threatened by the officers with fetters and manacles if\r\nhe showed any resistance, consented to mount the mule and start at\r\nonce on his journey. The third day they arrived at Meknes, where\r\nMulai Ahmed was confined in prison, whence he was not liberated for\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother story related by the stirrup-holder was that of Kaid Maimon\r\nand the lion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this century, when Sultan Mulai Suliman reigned\r\nover Morocco, Kaid Maimon was Governor of Tangier, and, according\r\nto custom, had visited the Court at Fas to pay his respects to His\r\nSherifian Majesty. On his return journey to Tangier he was conveying,\r\nin pursuance of His Majesty’s commands, a large lion in a cage\r\ncarried by four mules, as a present from the Sultan to the King\r\nof Portugal.\r\n\r\nOne evening, after the tents had been pitched, and while Kaid Maimon\r\nwas reposing on a divan in his ‘kubba,’ he heard shouts of alarm\r\nand the snorting and tramping of horses and mules which had broken\r\nloose from their tethers and were fleeing from the camp.\r\n\r\nThe Kaid clapped his hands repeatedly, to summon his attendants,\r\nbut no one appeared. Being too much of a Moorish grandee to rise\r\nfrom the divan and see with his own eyes what had happened—such a\r\nproceeding would have been undignified—he remained seated, counting\r\nthe beads of his rosary and muttering curses on his attendants. After\r\na time he again shouted lustily for his slave ‘Faraji,’ with a\r\nmalediction on him and on all slaves.\r\n\r\nThe Kaid had barely finished these imprecations, when in walked his\r\nhuge prisoner, the lion, glaring fiercely at him.\r\n\r\nKaid Maimon was a man of undaunted courage: while realising it would\r\nbe folly for him to draw his sword and attack the lion, as he would\r\nmost probably be worsted in such a conflict, he was also aware that\r\neven should he succeed in dealing the beast a death-blow, his own life\r\nwould be forfeited; as the Sultan would, no doubt, order his head to\r\nbe cut off, for destroying the royal gift entrusted to his keeping for\r\nthe King of Portugal. The Kaid therefore, looking as placidly as he\r\ncould at the intruder, thus addressed his namesake—for the lion had\r\nalso been given the name of ‘Maimon,’ or ‘the trustworthy.’\r\n‘You are a brave fellow, Maimon, to leave your cage and take a\r\nwalk this fine evening. O judicious and well-behaved lion!’ he\r\nadded, ‘you do right to roll and enjoy yourself’—as the lion,\r\npleased with the voice of the Kaid, commenced rolling himself on the\r\ncarpet. ‘O bravest and most trustworthy!’ the Kaid continued—as\r\nthe lion, rising, rubbed himself cat-like against him, repeating\r\nthis very embarrassing performance several times, finally stretching\r\nhimself and lying down with his head on the Kaid’s knee.\r\n\r\nBrave man though he was, Kaid Maimon perspired with horror at having\r\nto nurse such a beast. He tried patting him on the head, but a lash\r\nof the creature’s tail warned him that the lion preferred to take\r\nhis repose without such caresses.\r\n\r\nNot a sound was to be heard in the camp, save now and then a snort\r\nor struggle near the Kaid’s tent, from some terror-stricken horse\r\nwhich, winding the lion, was endeavouring to break away from the\r\npickets which still held him—though most of the horses and mules\r\nhad broken away and fled, with their masters after them.\r\n\r\nKaid Maimon now began to consider what kind of severe punishment he\r\nwould inflict upon his cowardly attendants and his body-guard—if\r\nthe lion did not eat him! ‘Fine warriors,’ thought he; ‘two\r\nhundred men to run away from a tame lion!’\r\n\r\nAt this moment the lion, having rested, awoke from his nap, and,\r\nstretching himself, showed his long and terrible claws. ‘This\r\nbeast is not to be trifled with,’ reflected the Kaid; ‘yet if any\r\nrascal had shot it—either in self-defence or to save my life—I\r\nshould have made him a head shorter.’\r\n\r\nThe lion now got up and, stalking towards the door of the tent,\r\nlashed his tail; one switch of which caught the Kaid’s turban and\r\nknocked it off. Calmly replacing it, the Kaid muttered to himself,\r\n‘I hope this visit is now coming to an end. May it be the last of\r\nthe kind I shall have to receive in my life.’\r\n\r\nThe lion, looking out, espied the horse—still picketed near the\r\ntent—which immediately recommenced its frantic struggles and at\r\nlast, succeeding in breaking away, was just galloping off, when the\r\nlion, in two bounds, was on its back and brought his victim to the\r\nground—panting in the agonies of death, its whole side lacerated\r\nand its throat torn open.\r\n\r\nThe Kaid, who had moved to the door of his tent, beheld this scene,\r\nand thought it would be a favourable moment, whilst the lion was\r\nenjoying his repast, to recall his cowardly attendants and troopers;\r\nso going out at the back of the tent, unseen by the lion, he looked\r\naround and finally espied his followers about half a mile off,\r\nhuddled together, with the horses and mules they had recovered.\r\n\r\nThe Kaid, on coming up to them, vowed he would bastinado every\r\ncowardly rascal; but that the punishment would be deferred until the\r\nmorrow, as they must now return at once to secure the lion before\r\nnightfall, adding—‘The first man who again runs away I will\r\nbastinado until the breath be out of his body.’\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the lion was a Jew; since, in Morocco, Jews are always\r\nappointed keepers of wild beasts, the Moors believing that a lion will\r\nnot attack a woman, a child, or a Jew—as being beneath notice. The\r\nJew was ordered to attach two long chains to the neck of the lion,\r\nnow bloated with the flesh of the horse, then to stretch the chains in\r\nopposite directions and to attach them to long iron stakes which were\r\ndriven into the ground for the purpose. The trembling Jew, who knew\r\nhe would be cruelly bastinadoed should he fail to obey this order,\r\ndid as he was bid, and the lion, lying near the remains of the horse\r\nhe had been devouring, suffered the Jew to fasten the chains to the\r\nrings on his collar, which was still about his neck.\r\n\r\nWhen this had been done, a dozen powerful men were ordered by the\r\nKaid to fasten strong ropes to the chains, and by pulling contrary\r\nways to control and guide the lion to his cage, wherein a live sheep\r\nwas placed. By these means the lion was induced to enter his cage,\r\nthe door of which was then closed.\r\n\r\nKaid Maimon, who was well pleased at the recovery of the Sultan’s\r\npresent to the King of Portugal, forgave the conduct of attendants and\r\ntroopers, and, assembling the chiefs, related to them the incidents\r\nof the lion’s visit to his tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                        MISSION TO FAS IN 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1874 Sultan Sid Mohammed died, and was succeeded by his son Mulai\r\nHassan. Sir John, writing to Sir Henry Layard on October 29 of that\r\nyear, says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose the young Sultan intends to tread in the footsteps of his\r\nancestors and remain stagnant.\r\n\r\nMy belief is that these people, or rather this Government, will never\r\nmove ahead until the lever acts at headquarters continuously, by the\r\npresence and pressure of the Foreign Representatives. So long as we\r\npreach and pray at a distance, nothing will be done. On the other\r\nhand, if the Foreign Representatives were removed to the Court,\r\nthere would no doubt be a rupture of relations, or some tragedy,\r\nbefore twelve months elapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, shortly after the accession of Mulai Hassan, Sir John writes\r\nto the same correspondent:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall make a fresh effort to induce the young Sultan to introduce\r\nsome reforms and improvements, but I have but faint hope of success,\r\nas the Ministers and satellites of the Court are either rogues\r\nor fools.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience of Turkey and the Turks I confess I have little\r\nconfidence in the beneficial effect of any attempt to introduce\r\nEuropean grafts on the old Mohammedan stock. The tree which showed\r\nsigns of vigour has been cut down, and the fruit of the European\r\ngraft contains rather the evils than the virtues of both the West\r\nand the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this letter was written, Sir John was already on his way to\r\nFas. On March 3, 1875 he left Tangier, accompanied by several members\r\nof his family, some personal friends[51], and the officers appointed\r\nby the British Government to attend the Mission.\r\n\r\nThe reception at Fas was magnificent, some six thousand troops having\r\nbeen sent to do honour to the Representative of Great Britain;\r\nbut what was more pleasing to him and greatly enhanced the effect\r\nof the entry, was the presence of the citizens of Fas, who had come\r\nto meet him in their thousands, bringing with them their wives and\r\nchildren; to show, they said, their appreciation of his friendship\r\nand love of justice. The shrill ‘zagharit’ continually raised\r\nby the women as Sir John passed through the crowd, attended by his\r\nstaff and escort, completely drowned at times the sound of the brass\r\nband which the Sultan had sent to play before the procession. Soon\r\nafter the instalment of the Mission at Fas, the incident occurred\r\nwhich Sir John relates as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n‘When on my mission to the Court at Fas in 1875, the Uzir had\r\nselected the Kaid of an Arab regiment to command the guard of honour\r\nwhich had been appointed to attend on our Mission.\r\n\r\n‘Another Kaid, named Meno, being superior in rank to the Arab Kaid,\r\nfelt aggrieved that this post of confidence had not been offered\r\nto him; moreover, he had rendered important service to the Sultan,\r\nwhich he considered unrecognised, so he vowed vengeance on his rival.\r\n\r\n‘The men of his regiment, all Berbers, were much attached to\r\nKaid Meno, not only on account of his famed courage in battle,\r\nbut also because whenever a _razzia_ took place, Meno did not, like\r\nother chiefs, insist on having the lion’s share of the plunder,\r\nbut left all to his followers.\r\n\r\n‘On hearing of my arrival and the appointment of the Arab Kaid,\r\nMeno summoned a dozen stalwart men of his regiment and imparted to\r\nthem, secretly, a scheme to bring disgrace upon the Arab officer and\r\nwhich they were to carry into execution. This was to the effect that\r\nthey should rob a horse from the orchard where the cavalry mounts\r\nof my Tangier escort were picketed.\r\n\r\n‘In this orchard was a summer-house where the English Medical\r\nOfficer who accompanied the Mission had his quarters; as also the\r\nchief of our camp, a Moor from Tangier. The orchard was enclosed by\r\na high wall, and at the gate several of the Arab guard were posted\r\nday and night.\r\n\r\n‘“How are we to abstract a horse?” asked the Berbers. “Shall\r\nwe cut the throats of the guard at night, force open the gate,\r\nand carry off the horse?”\r\n\r\n‘“No such violence is required,” said Kaid Meno. “After\r\nmidnight, when all is quiet, take off your shoes, go in silence to\r\nthe path round the southern side of the wall, take pickaxes with\r\nyou, and choose the best spot for making a hole through the tapia\r\nwall. I know the ground,” continued the Kaid; “you will find a\r\ndrop of five feet from the path to the orchard. Take plenty of rope\r\nwith you. Steal up to a horse—you will find several picketed—and\r\nlead him to the aperture in the wall. Then cast the horse quickly\r\nand quietly, bind his fore and hind legs firmly to his barrel,\r\nhoist him over your heads, and push him through the hole.”\r\n\r\n‘“What then?” asked the men; “where can we hide the horse? We\r\ncannot take him out into the country, for the gates of the town will\r\nbe closed.”\r\n\r\n‘“That is all settled,” replied Kaid Meno. “I have arranged\r\nwith a Berber cattle-lifter, who came to ask a favour of me this\r\nmorning, that he is to wait to-night, with four of his companions,\r\nwhere the river passing under the walls enters the town.\r\n\r\n‘“When a whistle is heard, a rope will be cast into the stream,\r\nwith a float and white signal attached. This rope will be taken\r\nhold of by you and fastened to the horse, which, securely bound,\r\nwill be cast into the river. The men outside, on hearing a second\r\nwhistle, will haul the animal under the walls of the town through the\r\narchway. A little water will not choke the horse, which will become\r\ntheir property, and they will of course lose no time in making off\r\nto the mountains before dawn.”\r\n\r\n‘“To each of you,” he added, “I give four ducats; and if\r\nthe Sultan disgraces the Arab Kaid, I shall have an ox killed and\r\ngive a feast to our regiment.”\r\n\r\n‘Meno’s orders were carried out. Some of my camp-followers\r\nwho slept in the orchard heard a horse moving about at night, but\r\nsupposed the animal had got loose.\r\n\r\n‘In the morning the robbery was reported.—I visited the orchard\r\nand saw the aperture through which the animal had been passed. The\r\nwall was three feet thick, and the hole, five feet from the ground,\r\nlooked so small that it was a wonder how the poor beast had been\r\njammed through.\r\n\r\n‘Early notice of the robbery had been given to the Governor of\r\nFas. The Arab Kaid was immediately placed under arrest, and orders\r\nissued that the town gates should be kept closed and search made in\r\nevery garden and stable of a suspicious character. This was done,\r\nbut without result.\r\n\r\n‘The Sultan “thundered and lightened,” as the myrmidons of\r\nthe Court told me, on hearing of the daring outrage that had been\r\ncommitted within the grounds assigned by His Sherifian Majesty for\r\nthe quarters of the British Mission, and His Majesty vowed vengeance\r\non the perpetrators of the theft.\r\n\r\n‘Later in the day, an Arab camel-driver reported to the Basha that\r\nhe had seen, early in the morning, a grey horse mounted bareback by\r\na Berber, who was riding with speed towards the mountains.\r\n\r\n‘Cavalry were dispatched in pursuit, but the robber had escaped.\r\n\r\n‘Suspicion then fell on the Kaid and men of the Berber regiment,\r\nfor words had been let drop which marked their glee at the disgrace\r\nof the Arab Kaid.\r\n\r\n‘One of the Berber soldiers was therefore seized and cruelly\r\nbastinadoed until he offered to tell how the robbery of the horse had\r\nbeen planned and carried out. His story was found to be true. The\r\nunfortunate Kaid Meno was brought before the Uzir. Undaunted, he\r\ndenied the charge, in an insulting manner. The Uzir reported his\r\nlanguage to the Sultan, who ordered Meno to be disgraced and reduced\r\nto the ranks. His horses and all his property were confiscated. It\r\nwas not until after I had left the Court that I learnt that the\r\nhorse I had received as a gift from the Sultan, a bright dun or\r\n“snabi,” had been the property of Kaid Meno, the colonel of\r\nthe Berber regiment. In my reminiscences of boar hunting I tell how\r\ngallant a hunter Snabi proved himself. His poor master must have been\r\nattached to him, for Snabi was gentle with man and faithful as a dog.\r\n\r\n‘The unfortunate Kaid Meno was, after a year, sent prisoner to\r\nTetuan, where he remained incarcerated until 1886, when, through my\r\nintercession, he was released and the Sultan placed him once more\r\nin command of a Berber regiment.’\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of the Mission in Fas, the Sultan invited its members\r\nto be present at a grand ‘lab-el-barod’ in which he personally\r\nintended taking part; this function to be preceded by a picnic\r\nbreakfast provided for his guests in one of the royal gardens about\r\ntwo miles from the town; and in accordance with this invitation the\r\nmembers of the Mission and two of the ladies were present at the\r\n‘lab-el-barod’ conducted by the Sultan in person.\r\n\r\nThe morning had been spent by the party in one of the beautiful royal\r\ngardens in the environs of Fas, where the Sultan had ordered luncheon\r\nto be served. As this picnic and the subsequent ‘lab-el-barod’\r\nwere regarded in a semi-official light, the Mission was escorted by\r\nthe Arab Kaid and cavalry who, as described in the story of Kaid Meno,\r\nhad supplanted that Berber officer and his men.\r\n\r\nA message arrived, soon after luncheon, requesting Sir John and his\r\nparty to proceed to a palace situated about two miles from Fas. Here,\r\nin a large court—or rather square—the performance took place. The\r\nSultan, who appeared much pleased to see his English visitors,\r\nsaluted them, after every charge in which he joined, by rising in\r\nhis stirrups and raising his gun, held horizontally to the level of\r\nhis turban, as he passed the spot were they were grouped.\r\n\r\nWhen the ‘fraja’ (sight) was over, we rode back to Fas, through\r\na gay and wild scene. The whole plain was crowded with various\r\ntribes, grouped separately, and each dancing their own form of\r\ngun-dance. There was one tribe of Shloh, wearing white, with red\r\nleather belts and white turbans; another, in brown; and another, all\r\ndressed in blue. Troops of Sus jugglers and Aisawa snake-charmers\r\nmingled with these, whilst crowds of women took advantage of every\r\nmound or ruined wall whence they could watch their male relatives.\r\n\r\nWe were about half a mile on our way home, when one of our Arab escort\r\ncursed a Shloh. Immediately, from the crowd, a stone was thrown\r\nat the offender, and this was followed by another. The escort, who\r\nhad been riding in open order, at once closed up in expectation of\r\na row. The three Tangier guards present, pushed forward; the four\r\nEnglish gentlemen surrounded Lady Hay, who rode a mule near Sir\r\nJohn; and Hadj Alarbi, the chief of the Tangier beaters—a gallant\r\nlittle man—hurried his mule to Miss Hay’s side, uncovering,\r\nat the same time, Sir John’s breechloader, which he was carrying,\r\nas the gentlemen had been shooting in the Sultan’s garden in the\r\nmorning. Seeing him cock the gun, Miss Hay said, ‘Why are you\r\ndoing that? You know it is not loaded and you have no cartridges.’\r\n‘No,’ said the Hadj, ‘but it looks well!’\r\n\r\nThe escort and the rest of the party, having now drawn closely\r\ntogether, were preparing to press forward; when Sir John, who\r\nwas as usual riding in front, checked them, giving orders to\r\nproceed as slowly as possible; progress therefore became almost\r\nfunereal. The crowd thickened about the party, curses were showered\r\non the Arab cavalry by the constantly increasing numbers of Shloh,\r\njoined by all the idle folk and boys of the town, who united in the\r\nabuse. Presently a bullet struck the ground near the Arab Kaid, and\r\na soldier of the escort was injured by one of the stones flung from\r\nthe crowd, but these missiles were well aimed, as—though members\r\nof the escort were frequently struck—not one touched any of the\r\nEnglish party. Bullets now whizzed over our heads, or struck the\r\nsand in front of us, sending it flying up in our horses’ faces,\r\nbut no one was injured. It was not a pleasant half-hour, as the\r\nroad was full of holes, and the horses fidgetty from the noise and\r\ncrush. On reaching the gates of Fas, it was found that some of the\r\nmiscreants had closed them, but the townspeople behaved well, and,\r\nafter a short pause, re-opened the gates to admit us, closing them\r\nagain immediately to exclude the mob; but after we had entered the\r\ntown, boys and other scamps ran along the high wall, still taunting\r\nand insulting the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThat evening, a message was brought to Sir John from the Sultan,\r\nby his ‘Hajib,’ to express His Majesty’s regret that such an\r\napparent insult had been offered to the Mission. The Hajib stated\r\nthat the Sultan had sent for the chiefs of the tribes and asked\r\nfor an explanation of their extraordinary conduct. They assured His\r\nMajesty that no insult was offered to or intended for the Bashador,\r\nbut that some of the younger men of the tribes, excited by feasting\r\nand with gunpowder, had taunted and tried to annoy the escort, who\r\nhad retorted; the Shloh had hoped to make the cavalry fly, as they\r\nwere accustomed to do on meeting them in battle, and thus prove that\r\nthe Arabs were unworthy to be guards to the British Mission.\r\n\r\nThe Hajib then continued, ‘Sidna says he cannot rest unless he\r\nis assured that none of you are injured, and he suggests and begs\r\nthat you, your friends and family (meaning the ladies), will return\r\nto the same spot to-morrow to witness the “lab-el-barod,” but\r\nwithout the Arab escort, and attended only by your Tangier guard.’\r\n\r\nSir John agreed, and next day, accompanied by his younger daughter and\r\nsome of the gentlemen, rode to the palace outside the walls—attended\r\nonly by the six faithful Suanni men. As we left the city, each tribe\r\nsent a body of armed men to perform the gun-dance before us.\r\n\r\nWe witnessed again the ‘lab-el-barod.’ The Sultan was,\r\nat first, mounted on a coal-black horse—in token of his deep\r\ndispleasure—but changed soon to a chestnut, and, lastly, mounted\r\na milk-white steed. Afterwards we rode over the plain, mingling\r\nwith the tribes. They cheered wildly, calling down blessings on the\r\nBashador and on all the English—‘For they are brave and just,’\r\nthey cried.\r\n\r\nThe matters which Sir John especially pressed on the attention of the\r\nSultan’s advisers on the occasion of this visit were principally\r\nthose which, promised in 1873, had not been carried into execution,\r\nin consequence of the death of Sultan Sid Mohammed. Amongst the more\r\nurgent of these demands were the following:—\r\n\r\nThe placing of a light at Mazagan, to facilitate the entry of ships\r\ninto the harbour at night; the building of a pier at Tangier, and of\r\nbreakwaters in the harbours of Saffi and Dar-el-Baida; the erection\r\nof more houses and stores for merchants at the ports; permission to\r\nexport bones; permission to import sulphur, saltpetre, and lead at\r\na ten per cent. duty, and the abolition of the Government monopoly\r\non these articles; the extension of the term placed on removal of\r\nprohibition to export wheat and barley; inquiry into and punishment\r\nof outrages on Jews; immediate settlement of all British claims. Most\r\nparticularly he pressed the importance of allowing a cable to be laid\r\nbetween Tangier and Gibraltar. When he had previously obtained from\r\nthe Moorish Government permission for an English Company to lay such\r\na cable, one of his colleagues informed the Moorish Government that,\r\nin case the concession was granted, he should insist on telegraph\r\nwires being laid between Ceuta and Tangier overland, and hold the\r\nMoorish Government responsible for the safety of the wires. The\r\nMoorish Government, frightened by this menace, and aware that no\r\ninland wires would be safe in the then state of Morocco, availed\r\nthemselves of the excuse to withdraw from their promise to Sir\r\nJohn. On this subject he wrote to Sir Henry Layard:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I presented the proposition to my colleagues, I premised by\r\ntelling them frankly of past opposition, and I asked what would have\r\nbecome of the network of telegraph wires spread throughout Europe,\r\nAsia, Africa, and America, if the petty spirit which had prevailed\r\nhere had existed on the part of the Representatives of Foreign\r\nPowers throughout the world. I ridiculed the advantages which it was\r\nsupposed we should derive in case of war and if the cable became\r\nthe property of the British Government. ‘Imagine,’ I said,\r\n‘my informing my Government some day by telegraph that the Sultan\r\nwas about to send a force of 30,000 Moorish troops in the _Moorish_\r\nsquadron to act against Spain or France. Such a dream,’ I said,\r\n‘would soon pass away, as any gunboat could cut the cable in this\r\ndefenceless bay whenever it pleased the officer in command. . . .\r\n\r\n‘Once,’ I said, ‘the cable or cables introduced at Tangier,\r\nthe time would not be far distant when this Government and people\r\nwould follow the example of the rest of the world, and have telegraph\r\nwires throughout this Empire.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a series of letters written to his sister, Mrs. Norderling,\r\nSir John describes various incidents of the Mission. The first of\r\nthese letters, dated April 24, gives an account of the flattering\r\nreception the Mission had received:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThough we are the _pets of the Harem_ we long to get away, but\r\na message has just been brought that the Sultan will not let us\r\ngo till May 1. Never have I met such a welcome at the Court as on\r\nthis occasion. Royal honours paid us everywhere, not a word, not a\r\ngesture, not a look that could be called unfriendly. From the pompous\r\nBasha down to the humble labourer, all vie in being civil to the\r\nEnglishman who has been, as they say, the friend of the Moor, and\r\nwho loves ‘justice.’ Even the women don’t hide their faces,\r\nor run away from me, but smile brightly at my grey beard when I\r\npeer over the terrace wall, though they are more shy when my young\r\nfriends attempt to have a look at them, in their smart dresses,\r\nwalking on the terraces.\r\n\r\nI have had two private audiences of the Sultan[52] since the\r\npublic audience. He and I have become great friends. He is about\r\n6 feet 2 inches high, very handsome, of a slim and elegant figure,\r\nvery dignified in his manner, but gentle, with a sad expression of\r\ncountenance. I think he is about twenty-seven years of age. His colour\r\nabout the same shade as that of Hajot[53]. Features very regular. He\r\nhas taken the greatest interest in the telegraph apparatus sent\r\nto His Sherifian Majesty by the British Government. It has been\r\nplaced in the garden of his palace between two summer-houses. I\r\nstood with the Sultan at one end, and a sapper, sent by Government\r\nto work the instrument, and the Engineer officers at the other. The\r\nfirst message he received in Arabic letters was ‘May God prolong\r\nthe life of Mulai Hassan.’ Several messages were interchanged. I\r\nleft the room to communicate with the officers, and the Sultan took\r\npossession of the instrument, and, as the letters are in Arabic, he\r\nsent one himself. The sapper was delighted with his intelligence. He\r\nwanted to have wires put between the palace and my house to enable\r\nhim to talk to me, he said, but there is no time. He has agreed\r\nto allow of a cable[54] being laid between Tangier and Gibraltar,\r\nbut not inland as yet, for he declares that his wild subjects would\r\ndestroy the wires. I have got, however, the thin end of the wedge\r\ninserted for telegraphic communication. He agrees also to the Mole at\r\nTangier, and other improvements on the coast, and has removed some\r\nrestrictions on trade, so, after much negotiation, ‘un petit pas\r\nen avant’ is made. He told me that he cannot introduce many of the\r\nimprovements he desires, from the fear of raising an outcry against\r\nhimself by some of his ignorant subjects. He also tells me that his\r\nfather, before his death, had followed my advice, to give salaries to\r\nthe Governors of the Southern provinces, and thus check the system\r\nof corruption and robbery practised by these grandees in office to\r\nenrich themselves. I hear that the inhabitants of these provinces\r\nare happy and contented. His Majesty hopes to introduce the same\r\nsystem into the Northern provinces, and he sent the Governor-General\r\nof half his empire to listen to my advice.\r\n\r\nThis country is an Augean stable, and I cannot sweep it; but as the\r\nSultan is well disposed, we are doing our little best to aid him.\r\n\r\nHe invited us all to witness the feast of the Mulud—an unprecedented\r\nfavour, for even in Tangier the authorities think it prudent to\r\nrecommend Christians and Jews to keep aloof from the wild tribes\r\nwho assemble on such occasions.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs from the Arab provinces and the Berber mountains, with\r\ntheir followers, amounting to several thousand men, had come to the\r\nfeast to bring presents to His Majesty. The Sultan, with all his\r\ngrandees and regular and irregular troops, proceeded to a picturesque\r\nsite two miles beyond the town.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan sent us a guard of honour and orders to the commander to\r\nallow me and my friends to take up any position we liked. Each chief\r\nwith his retinue formed a line and advanced towards the Sultan,\r\nbowing low from their horses. His Majesty gave them his blessing,\r\nwhich was proclaimed by the Master of the Ceremonies, and then they\r\nwheeled round, cheering, and galloped off. Some thirty governors or\r\nchiefs were presented. The scene was beyond description. Imagine the\r\nbrilliant costumes of the Sultan’s troops; the flowing white dresses\r\nof the wild Berber; the massive walls and bastions of Fas in the\r\ndistance, with minarets and palm-trees o’ertopping them; undulating\r\nhills covered with castles and ‘kubba’-topped tombs, interspersed\r\nwith orange-groves, olive-trees, and luxuriant vegetation; a shining\r\nriver flowing at our feet, and the snowy range of the Atlas in the\r\ndistance, and you have a picture which was wonderful to behold.\r\n\r\nNo people can behave better than the ‘Fassien’ have this time,\r\nand even the swarms of Berbers we meet are civil to us. The Sultan\r\nsent a message to us (we were all in our ‘armour’) that he was\r\nvery glad we had come to the feast, as he wished to show all his\r\nsubjects that I was his honoured guest and friend.\r\n\r\nThis is a very chilly place. Last time I was here, in 1868, I had\r\ndysentery, and now I have a frightful cold. Water everywhere; air\r\nhot outside, but cold in the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Mission had returned to Tangier, he writes to the same\r\ncorrespondent in July 1875, on the reforms which he was endeavouring\r\nto introduce:—\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, we are sitting in Congress at the request of the Moorish\r\nGovernment about the various improvements. The Representatives\r\n(with the exception of the Don) support the Moorish Government. The\r\nsilly Spaniards like not that Morocco should improve and that our\r\nyoung Sultan should become popular. They always talk (_sub rosâ_)\r\nabout Morocco as destined for a Spanish colony, and they fear lest\r\nthe Moors should become too strong for them, or that, by improving\r\nthe country and commerce, Foreign Powers should put their veto on the\r\npetty system of menace and bullying to which the Dons have resorted\r\nsince the war of 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater on he writes to Mrs. Norderling about the Sahara scheme. A plan\r\nhad been proposed, and a company was to be formed, with the object\r\nof flooding the Sahara by means of a canal cut on the West African\r\nCoast, in the belief—it was said—of thus re-creating a great\r\ninland sea in place of a sandy desert. On this subject he writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sahara scheme appears to me to be a ‘chateau en Espagne.’\r\nI had a letter from Lord Derby requesting me to aid McKenzie & Co.,\r\nand to ask for the good offices of the Moorish Government. He might as\r\nwell have asked me to aid the Naval Expedition to the North Pole. The\r\nMoorish Minister did not know the whereabouts of Cape Bojador, and\r\nsaid the tribes south of Agadir would probably be more hostile to\r\nthe explorers if they heard that the Sultan encouraged them. Remember\r\nDavidson’s fate, and that of the two Spaniards who have just been\r\nransomed for $27,000 after seven years’ captivity at Wadnun.\r\n\r\nBargash put a fair query: ‘If this inundation can really be carried\r\ninto execution, does the British Government intend to obtain the\r\nconsent of the chiefs or inhabitants of the oases of the desert\r\nor neighbouring districts, and to offer them compensation? Or will\r\ntheir claims be got rid of by swamping them?’\r\n\r\nI have not, either in reply to Lord Derby or to McKenzie, who has\r\nwritten to me, opposed the scheme; but I have warned them that it\r\nwill be natural to expect a strong hostile feeling on the part of\r\nthe tribes who inhabit the oases and borders of the desert, and who\r\nhave had, from time immemorial, the privilege of escorting caravans\r\nand levying contributions on the traffic through the Sahara.\r\n\r\nI should doubt that there would be any depth in the Kus. In my\r\nignorance I should say that the sea had withdrawn from that region\r\nfrom the uplifting of the surface, and that even if there be parts\r\nmuch lower than the Atlantic, it would be a sea too dangerous to\r\nnavigate from the risk of sand-banks. I don’t think you and I will\r\nlive to hear that the cutting has been made. Money will be raised,\r\nand the engineers will fill their pockets—‘y nada mas.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n                              1876-1879.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John’s annual leave was generally taken in the autumn, for,\r\nas he writes from Tangier to Sir Joseph Hooker,—\r\n\r\n\r\nWe visit England every year, but prefer going in the shooting instead\r\nof _the_ season, as to us, barbarians, we find English society more\r\ncordial in their ‘castles’ than when engaged in circling in a\r\nwhirlpool of men and women in the ‘season.’ Our stay therefore\r\nis very short in town, and this will account for my not having given\r\nyou a hail in your paradise at Kew. We probably go home in July;\r\nif so, and you are in town, I shall call either on arrival or return.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of these yearly holidays he was entertained by many\r\nroyal and distinguished personages, with some of whom he had become\r\nacquainted as their host at Tangier; but no record of any special\r\ninterest is left of these visits in his letters. Thus in the year\r\nunder notice, he was present at the Brussels Conference on Africa,\r\nby invitation of the King of the Belgians, who as Duke of Brabant\r\nhad visited Tangier in 1862. In the following November he was the\r\nguest of the Prince of Wales at Sandringham, whence he writes,\r\n‘The children clustered round me, and I had to tell many stories\r\nof the Moors. Captain Nares arrived and dined. We passed the night\r\non the Arctic Ocean, and found it most interesting.’\r\n\r\nSir John always returned to the South before the cold set in in\r\nEngland. This was merely from dislike of a chilly climate, after\r\nyears of residence under a Southern sky, and not on the score of\r\nhealth, as may be judged from the following letter to his sister:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Ravensrock, _June 24_, 1876.\r\n\r\nThanks for your good wishes on my entering the shady side of\r\nsixty—_bright_ side I ought to say, for thanks to God I am as\r\nhearty and strong as I was twenty years ago, though I have no longer\r\nthe speed of youth. Yesterday we had all the foreign society to play\r\nat lawn-tennis, and I flatter myself, though only my third trial at\r\nthe game, on having been the best amongst the youngsters who joined\r\nthe fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern affairs boded ill for peace in 1876, and Sir John, always\r\ndeeply interested in matters connected with Turkey, writes in July:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cloud in the East looks very threatening. I hope we shall not\r\ndo more than insist on _fair play_. If the Christian races are able\r\nto hold their own, we ought not to interfere so long as they are\r\nnot placed under the sway of Russia or other Power antagonistic\r\nto us. If the Turks succeed in quashing the insurrection, I hope\r\nour influence will be exerted to prevent outrages being committed\r\nby the Mohammedans. I do not believe in the resurrection of the\r\n‘sick man,’ but I am convinced that Russia has done her best\r\nto hurry him to death’s door. When the Blue Books are published,\r\nwe shall have much to learn, especially if our Foreign Office has to\r\ndefend its present menacing attitude before the British Parliament\r\nand public. If England had looked on passively, we should probably\r\nhave been forced into war.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the crisis was averted.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Lord Derby’s policy in the East,’ he writes, ‘has astounded\r\nthe foreigners. They all _without exception_ appear pleased to\r\nsee the old Lion growl and bestir itself, and Russia “reculer”\r\n(“pour mieux sauter”). The policy of the latter was evidently the\r\nsystem of administering slow poison. I don’t think we can prevent\r\nparalysis of the patient, or his final demise, but we have done right\r\nwell in showing that we cannot allow a doctor, who prescribes poison,\r\nto play the part of chief adviser to the patient. Let him live awhile,\r\nand the course of events may prevent the balance tipping in favour\r\nof our opponents in the East.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Lord Derby Sir John entertained a high opinion. ‘I believe\r\nhim,’ he says in one of his letters at this time, ‘to be a\r\nfar better man and more thoroughly English than any of his Whig\r\npredecessors—except dear old Palmerston.’\r\n\r\nIn the following year Sir Henry Layard, Sir John’s former\r\nfellow-worker in Sir Stratford Canning’s time, was appointed\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople, and he thus writes to congratulate\r\nhim on the appointment:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _April 5_, 1877.\r\n\r\nI rejoiced to hear that you go to Stambul pro tem.; for I have no\r\ndoubt the appointment will be hereafter confirmed, and the right\r\nman will be in the right place.\r\n\r\nAs you say, it will be a very difficult post, especially as I fear\r\nin these days an ambassador cannot look alone, as in the days of\r\nPonsonby and Redcliffe, to the course he deems would best serve the\r\ninterests of his country—and I may add of Turkey—but he must\r\nseek to satisfy lynx-eyed humanitarians and others, even though he\r\nmay know that the real cause of humanity will not be benefited.\r\n\r\nIf vigilance, tact, and decision can gain the day, it will be yours.\r\n\r\nI am, however, very far from rejoicing at your removal from Madrid,\r\nand shall miss you much. Through you the evil machinations of the\r\nDon have been thwarted. Had you been at Madrid in 1859-60 we should\r\nnot have had war in Morocco.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same subject he writes to his sister:—\r\n\r\n\r\nLayard has gone to Stambul. He writes me that he has a hard task\r\nbefore him; he will have to work in the teeth of humanitarians\r\nwho have done much against the cause of _humanity_ already, though\r\ntheir motives are no doubt good. I have said from the first, Russia\r\nwon’t fight unless Turkey forces her. . . . Russia will get up\r\nanother massacre when she thinks the rumour suitable to her interests\r\nand views.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again later:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI think Layard’s dispatch of May 30 excellent.\r\n\r\nHe has a most difficult task, but is ceaseless in his efforts to\r\nprevent atrocities. I have no sympathy with the Turkish Government,\r\nwhich is _detestable_, but I have for the Turks.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I consider the conduct of the Russian\r\nGovernment—which has been sapping and mining for _years_ through\r\nagents, Bulgarian and foreign, to bring about rebellion, revolt, and\r\neven the very atrocities committed on Christians in Bulgaria which\r\nshe now comes forward as champion to avenge—as base, treacherous,\r\nand detestable; her sole aim being conquest. Never shall I have any\r\nsympathy for that treacherous and ambitious Power.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sir John, who still maintained his influence at\r\nthe Court, continued unremitting in his efforts to abolish abuses\r\nin Morocco.\r\n\r\nJust before going on leave in 1877 he writes from Tangier to his\r\nsister:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel sorry to leave this even for two months, but am glad to have\r\na rest, for as our young Sultan makes me superintend his foreign\r\naffairs, I have no rest. We think of leaving on the 28th. I have\r\nmy leave, but I have so much work to get through I could not well\r\nstart before then.\r\n\r\nI am striking at the _Hydra_, _Protection_, which is depriving\r\nthis Government of its lawful taxes and of all jurisdiction over\r\nMoors. Lord Derby is making it an international question, and has\r\nhitherto given me _carte blanche_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplomatic operations proceed slowly in Morocco, and this question of\r\nthe protection extended by foreigners to Moorish subjects, which Sir\r\nJohn had so much at heart, was no exception to the rule. To his great\r\nregret his efforts to combat the abuse were eventually baffled. But\r\nhe foresaw from the outset that the prospect of success was never\r\nvery great, and says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall fight the battle, and if abuses are maintained, and this\r\nGovernment is too weak and powerless to resist them, I shall fold\r\nmy arms and await events; I can do no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the same subject he returns in a letter to Sir Henry Layard:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moorish Government have very strong grounds for complaint and\r\nfor insisting on reform and the abolition of these abuses, which\r\nare extending in such a manner that soon all the wealthy merchants\r\nand farmers will be under foreign protection and refuse to pay\r\ntaxes. . . .\r\n\r\nIn my reply to Sid Mohammed Bargash, which I repeated both in French\r\nand Arabic, I said that, though I had been thirty-two years British\r\nRepresentative and was in charge of the interests of Austria, Denmark,\r\nand the Netherlands, and though British trade with Morocco was greater\r\nthan the trade of all the other nations put together, I did not give\r\nprotection to a single Moorish subject not actually in the service\r\nof Her Majesty’s Government, or in my personal service or that of\r\nmy subordinate officers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe settlement of this question was one of the objects which induced\r\nSir John to remain at Morocco after his period of service, by the\r\nnew regulations at the Foreign Office, had expired. He writes to\r\nhis sister in the spring of 1878:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I told you that I was informed by Lord Derby that my term\r\nof service—_five years_ in accordance with decree of Parliament\r\nabout Ministers—had expired, but that the Queen had been pleased\r\nto signify her desire that I should remain in Morocco, and hopes I\r\nshall be pleased. . . . I only agree to remain until I have settled\r\nthe question of irregular protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of protection, as defined by treaty, was limited in\r\nits operation. But, in practice, the system was extended beyond\r\nall reasonable limits, and was capable of gross abuses and\r\nirregularities. By the treaties of Great Britain and Spain with\r\nMorocco, Moorish subjects in the service of foreign diplomatists\r\nand consuls were exempted from taxation by the Sultan, and from the\r\njurisdiction of Moorish authorities. The same privileges of granting\r\nexemptions were claimed by other Foreign Powers, and extended to\r\npersons not in the employment of their Representatives. The results\r\nwere, that the Sultan was deprived of control over a large number of\r\nhis subjects; that many of the wealthiest traders, especially among\r\nthe Jews, were relieved from all contributions to taxation; and that\r\npersons who were guilty of crime escaped from justice by obtaining\r\na place on the privileged lists of Foreign Representatives. To such\r\nan extent was the abuse carried that, in Sir John’s opinion, the\r\nMoorish Government was, by its prevalence, reduced to a dangerous\r\nstate of weakness. Moreover he felt that if the Foreign Powers\r\nsurrendered the privilege of protection or submitted to its careful\r\nregulation, they would be enabled to bring the strongest pressure\r\non the Moorish Government to carry out much needed reforms in the\r\nadministration of the country. Unfortunately Sir John’s opinions\r\non this question were shared by only a portion of his colleagues,\r\nand he saw that nothing in the matter would be finally achieved at\r\nTangier. He hoped, however, that a more satisfactory conclusion\r\nmight be arrived at, if a Conference could be conducted in some\r\nother country.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have suggested,’ he writes to his sister in June, 1877,\r\n‘to Lord Salisbury that there should be no more palavering at\r\nTangier, where some of the Representatives have personal interests\r\nin maintaining abuses, but that a decision be come to by the\r\nseveral Governments, or by a Conference at some Court, a Moorish\r\nEnvoy attending. As the fate of Morocco will greatly depend on the\r\ndecision come to, and as its position on the Straits and its produce\r\nmust sooner or later bring this country to the front, I have urged\r\nthat my suggestion deserves attention.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John’s proposal was adopted, and a Conference was held at Madrid\r\non the subject of protection in Morocco. But the result was not what\r\nSir John had hoped, and he writes to his sister in June, 1880:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be no use in my remaining to continue the imbroglio which\r\nthe Madrid Conference has produced.\r\n\r\nThe French policy has been _je veux_, and the silly Italians, who\r\nreally have no trade or interest in Morocco except to maintain its\r\nindependence, backed the French.\r\n\r\nBritish and other foreign merchants claim now the same privileges as\r\nthe French, and they cannot be refused; so when each foreign resident\r\nin Morocco appoints a rich farmer in the interior as his factor, and\r\nthis man is placed beyond the pale of the Moorish authorities and\r\nsolely subject to the jurisdiction of a mercantile consul, living\r\noften at a distance of five days’ journey, you may imagine the\r\nrows that will take place, as these factors cannot be selected from\r\nangels, but from erring barbarians. However, as I said to a colleague,\r\n‘My appetite has improved since I find my propositions have not been\r\naccepted,’ for now my responsibility ceases, and when affairs take a\r\ndisastrous turn I shall say, ‘I told you so.’ It is sad, however,\r\nfor I had advised that when the Powers conceded the just demands of\r\nthe Sultan, it would be an opportunity for requiring that he should\r\nintroduce gradually reforms in the maladministration of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another letter he hints at a different grievance which he sought\r\nto abate, but in this also old traditions and what may be termed\r\n‘vested interests’ proved too strong for him and his allies:—\r\n\r\n\r\nLately we have had many meetings of Foreign Representatives,\r\nand I have had to waggle my tongue, and my throat has suffered\r\naccordingly. I have some trouble, being Doyen, and all the meetings\r\ntake place at my house. We are trying to get rid of abuses and of the\r\nsystem of Foreign Ministers and Consuls riding roughshod over this\r\nwretched Government and people and compelling them to pay trumped-up\r\nclaims. The German and Belgian are my coadjutors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commercial condition of Morocco showed signs, however, of\r\nimprovement, and the Sultan evidently intended to take steps for\r\ngiving security to the lives and property of his subjects. But these\r\nsigns of increasing prosperity were doomed to be only the heralds\r\nof terrible disasters, as was foreshadowed in the following letter\r\nto Sir Joseph Hooker dated February 23, 1878:—\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We continue,’ writes Sir John, ‘to progress like the cow’s\r\ntail, but one step has been made in the right direction. The Sultan\r\nis forming a body of regular troops, and our Government is aiding\r\nhim by drilling squads at Gibraltar, who will act as instructors\r\nto the “Askar” when they have been instructed and return to\r\nthe Court. With ten thousand regulars the Sultan ought to be able\r\nto bring under subjection the wild tribes who only acknowledge him\r\nas the Chief of Islam. There would then be better security for life\r\nand property. This I hope would lead to the development of commerce\r\nand resources of this country, but we travel at camel’s pace—I\r\nmay add, a _lame_ camel.\r\n\r\n‘There has been a great lack of rain throughout Morocco. The usual\r\nfall is between thirty and fifty inches; this winter since September\r\nonly three and a-half inches have fallen. The country is parched in\r\nthe South, all the crops have failed, and cattle are dying. In this\r\nprovince the crops still look green, and a little rain fell last\r\nnight, but water will be as dear as beer in England if we have not\r\na good downfall. We fear there will be famine in the land.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThese fears were realised, and Sir John writes to his sister that he\r\nhad suggested to the British Government that his visit to the Court in\r\nthe spring should be postponed, ‘as minds of Moorish Government will\r\nbe preoccupied and my preaching and praying would be of no avail.’\r\n\r\nIn June he writes again:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThis country is in a very sad state. Robert[55] says the people\r\nare dying of starvation round Mogador, and cattle and sheep by the\r\nthousands. I see no prospect of warding off the famine, and fear that\r\nmisery will prevail for many years in the Southern districts, as there\r\nwill be no cattle to till the land. Sultan is said to be distributing\r\ngrain. Wheat and other provisions are imported from England and other\r\nforeign countries. Bread here is dearer than in England, though the\r\ncrops in this district are good. Robert has appealed to the British\r\npublic through the _Times_ and Lord Mayor, but John Bull has doled\r\nout his sovereigns so liberally for Indians, Chinese, Bulgarians,\r\nand Turks, that I fear there will be very little for the Moor.\r\n\r\nWe have got up subscriptions here for the Mogador poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famine was followed in the autumn of 1878 by an outbreak of\r\ndisease, and in a letter, written in October on his return from leave,\r\nhe says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nGood health at Tangier; but cholera—or, if not cholera, some\r\ndire disease—is mowing down the population in the interior. At\r\nDar-el-Baida, a small town with about 6,000 population, the deaths\r\namounted to 103 a day! but the disease is moving South, not North. The\r\nrains and cool weather will I hope check the evil.\r\n\r\nGreat misery in the interior. There are reports that the starving\r\npeople eat their dead. This I think is an exaggeration, but they are\r\neating the arum[56] root, which when not properly prepared produces\r\nsymptoms like cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing of the port of Gibraltar against all articles of trade\r\nfrom Morocco had produced great distress amongst the poorer classes,\r\nand the arbitrary measures taken by the sanitary authorities at\r\nGibraltar and the Spanish ports served to add to the miseries\r\nof the population of Morocco. In addition to these calamities,\r\nduring Sir John’s absence the terrors of some of the European\r\nRepresentatives led to the introduction of futile and mischievous\r\nquarantine regulations at Tangier itself, which Sir John on his\r\nreturn at once combated.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘There is good health in Tangier,’ he writes in October, ‘but I\r\nexpect we shall have cholera before the spring. My colleagues during\r\nmy absence had run amuck and established a _cordon_ outside the town,\r\nstopping passengers and traffic, fumigating skins, clapping poor folk\r\ninto quarantine exposed to the night air, and other follies. As I\r\nsaid to them, “Why do you introduce _cordons_ in Morocco when you\r\ndon’t have them in other countries? It is only a source of bribery\r\nand corruption. The rich get through and the poor starve outside. It\r\nis a measure which only trammels traffic and promotes distress.”\r\n\r\n‘A Spaniard, guard of a _cordon_ at Tetuan, was killed, and there\r\nwas nearly a revolution amongst the Mohammedans at Tangier. Then\r\nan order came from the Sultan to remove _cordons_, and saying\r\nForeign Representatives were only empowered to deal in sanitary\r\nand quarantine regulations by _sea_ and not inland. My colleagues\r\n(except German—Belgian is absent) were furious and said it was all\r\nmy doing, and they have been baying at me ever since like a pack of\r\nwolves, as the _cordon_ is taken off. The malady in the interior,\r\nwhatever it is, cholera or typhus, is on the wane, but deaths from\r\nstarvation are numerous.\r\n\r\n‘Sultan is feeding some three thousand at Marákesh. Rain has fallen\r\nin the South, but cattle are dead or unfit to plough, and the poor\r\nhave no seed. The ways and means of the Government are coming to an\r\nend, and the little impulse lately given to trade and civilisation\r\nwill, I fear, be lost for years.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 15 he writes again on the subject:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctors at Tangier, Mazagan, and Mogador have now formally\r\ndeclared that the prevalent disease is not _cholera asiatica_,\r\nbut that it has a choleraic character. The famished, weak, and poor\r\ninvalids are carried off, but if a person in comfortable circumstances\r\nis attacked, a dose of castor oil, or even oil, cures them. This is\r\nnot _cholera asiatica_. There have been cases they say at Tangier,\r\nbut the mortality this year is _less_ than usual.\r\n\r\nGibraltar, however, continues its rigorous measures—thirty days\r\nquarantine—and will not admit even an egg under that. I see no hope\r\nfor improvement until after next harvest. The poor must starve. These\r\nquarantines increase the misery, for they check trade, and the poor\r\nengaged in labour connected with commerce are in a starving state. The\r\nGerman Minister and I are doing what we can to relieve about three\r\nhundred people here. Robert relieves some 2,700 daily at Mogador.\r\n\r\nIt is pouring; what a blessing! All the wells in the town are dry. I\r\nsend a mile to get water: two mules at work, and my water-supply\r\nmust cost me two shillings a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards aiding the starving poor in the Moorish coast towns £2,600\r\nwere raised in London, and at Tangier in December Sir John writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nLast month six of the Foreign Representatives had a meeting, and\r\nwe decided on raising a subscription to aid these wretched people\r\nto return to their distant homes. There are some four hundred. £60\r\nwas subscribed before the meeting broke up, and then we sent it on\r\nto the Moorish authorities and the well-to-do folk—Christians,\r\nJews, and Mohammedans, and I believe the collection will amount to\r\n£250. Clothes are to be supplied for the naked, provisions for the\r\nroad, and with money sufficient to exist on for a month, we send\r\nthem off to their distant homes.\r\n\r\nWe take this step to free Tangier from a crowd of wretched people\r\nwho have no homes, and who sleep in the streets under arches. You\r\ncan imagine the consequences in our little town, which had become\r\na model as far as scavenging is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough in the Northern provinces the famine had sensibly abated,\r\nin the South there was still much distress, and disease was rife\r\namong all classes. On March 5, 1879, Sir John writes to his sister\r\nwith reference to his son, then Consul at Mogador, who had already\r\nbeen dangerously ill:—\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain we have been alarmed by the accounts of R. The doctor who\r\nattended him reports that he had a brain fever, which finished\r\noff in typhus, brought on, as doctor said, by over-anxiety and\r\nwork in relieving the famished people. He was, thank God, on the\r\n23rd convalescent: fever had left him very weak, and he is ordered\r\nto proceed to Tangier as soon as his strength will permit him to\r\nmove. . . .\r\n\r\nThe Italian Vice-Consul at Mogador died of typhoid, the French Consul\r\nwas at death’s door. Poor Kaid Maclean is in a dangerous state at\r\nMarákesh. Several Europeans at the ports have died of typhoid.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is poisoned by the famished people and bodies buried\r\na few inches below the surface or even left exposed.\r\n\r\nWe have sent off the poor, with aid from here, and as I happen to\r\nbe President of the Board this month, I am attending to hygienic\r\nmeasures, and hope thereby to ward off the dread disease from\r\nthis town.\r\n\r\n\r\nA curious incident connected with this time of anxiety was recorded\r\nby Sir John. It is related here as printed in the _Journal of the\r\nSociety for Psychical Research_[57]:—\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1879 my son Robert Drummond Hay resided at Mogador with\r\nhis family, where he was at that time Consul. It was in the month\r\nof February. I had lately received good accounts of my son and his\r\nfamily; I was also in perfect health. About 1 a.m. (I forget the\r\nexact day in February), whilst sleeping soundly [at Tangier], I was\r\nwoke by hearing distinctly the voice of my daughter-in-law, who was\r\nwith her husband at Mogador, saying in a clear but distressed tone of\r\nvoice, ‘Oh, I wish papa only knew that Robert is ill.’ There was\r\na night-lamp in the room. I sat up and listened, looking around the\r\nroom, but there was no one except my wife, sleeping quietly in bed. I\r\nlistened for some seconds, expecting to hear footsteps outside, but\r\ncomplete stillness prevailed, so I lay down again, thanking God that\r\nthe voice which woke me was an hallucination. I had hardly closed my\r\neyes when I heard the same voice and words, upon which I woke Lady\r\nDrummond Hay and told her what had occurred, and I got up and went\r\ninto my study, adjoining the bedroom, and noted it in my diary. Next\r\nmorning I related what had happened to my daughter, saying that\r\nthough I did not believe in dreams I felt anxious for tidings from\r\nMogador. That port, as you will see in the map, is about 300 miles\r\nSouth of Tangier. A few days after this incident a letter arrived\r\nfrom my daughter-in-law, Mrs. R. Drummond Hay, telling us that my\r\nson was seriously ill with typhoid fever and mentioning the night\r\nduring which he had been delirious. Much struck by the coincidence\r\nthat it was the same night I had heard her voice, I wrote to tell\r\nher what had happened. She replied, the following post, that in her\r\ndistress at seeing her husband so dangerously ill, and from being\r\nalone in a distant land, she had made use of the precise words which\r\nhad startled me from sleep, and had repeated them. As it may be of\r\ninterest for you to receive a corroboration of what I have related,\r\nfrom the persons I have mentioned, who happen to be with me at this\r\ndate, they also sign, to affirm the accuracy of all I have related.\r\n\r\nWhen I resigned, in 1886, I destroyed, unfortunately, a number of\r\nmy diaries and amongst them that of 1879, or I should have been able\r\nto state the day, and might have sent you the leaf on which I noted\r\nthe incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                   THIRD MISSION TO FAS. 1879-1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1879 Sir John writes, ‘State of Morocco better,\r\nbut the Government is such a wretched one that I am always finding\r\nthe stone I had rolled up, back again at the bottom! A vigorous\r\ntyrant would be preferable to our good, well-meaning Sultan.’\r\n\r\nHe decided on undertaking his long-deferred visit to the Moorish\r\nCourt in the following spring, with a view of bringing his personal\r\ninfluence to bear on the Sultan and stimulating him to attempt some\r\nmeasure of reform. He was not, however, sanguine of success. In\r\nFebruary, 1880, he writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nRain has fallen in abundance, crops look well, and Moors are holding\r\nup their heads again, though the Government at Fas is as bad as bad\r\ncan be, the new Uzir having been selected because he is a relative of\r\nthe Sultan, and not for his fitness. I expect to have very uphill\r\nwork at the Court. A clever rascal is better than an ignorant,\r\ncorrupt dolt, which latter, I fear, is Uzir Mokhta.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again in March:—\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have faint hope of doing much good when I have to deal with an\r\nignorant fanatic, and shall endeavour to treat direct with the Sultan,\r\nwho is intelligent but stupidly avaricious. I say stupidly, for the\r\nsystem is pursued of killing the goose to get the golden eggs.’\r\n\r\n‘I am overwhelmed with work,’ he writes on March 27, on the eve\r\nof his departure, ‘as we are off on the 3rd. Sultan has sent us\r\nhandsome tents, led horses and mules, fifty escort and forty baggage\r\nanimals. We shall be at Fas, I suppose, on 13th or 14th. Some of our\r\nparty will return by the end of the month. I fear I shall be detained\r\ntill the middle of May. Moors, like all Orientals, try to wear out a\r\nnegotiation by dilatoriness, in the hope that one will accept half,\r\nmerely to get rid of the business one may take in hand.\r\n\r\n‘This is an Augean stable. I have long flourished my broom on\r\nthe threshold, but with little hope of clearing away the muck which\r\nhas accumulated in centuries. There is now a dawn of hope that the\r\ncivilised world will take better interest in the destiny of this\r\nfine country and people, who for centuries in Spain were in the van\r\nof science, literature, and art.\r\n\r\n‘_Entre nous_, I brought about the Conference at Madrid. I fear,\r\nhowever, so many interests will clash that we shall not be able to\r\nget rid of all the foreign vultures which prey upon Morocco, and\r\nthat no measures will be adopted for urging the Sultan to abolish\r\na system which is equivalent to preying on his own vitals.\r\n\r\n‘The French are very active about the railway to the Sudan. As the\r\nroad will pass near, or even I believe through, a part of Morocco,\r\nwe may expect to hear of troubles which it is to be apprehended will\r\nbring about a conflict. Of course Morocco will be crushed, though I do\r\nnot suppose either Great Britain, or other countries having interests\r\nin the Mediterranean, will ever allow the Straits to be held by France\r\nor any other Power. It is a disgrace, however, to the civilised world\r\nif this wretched Government is allowed to drag on. Sultan must be\r\nrequired to introduce reforms. I shall preach and try to rouse him;\r\nbut I shall have a nest of hornets about me both at Fas and Tangier.\r\n\r\n‘N.B.—No cups of coffee to be drunk that have not been tasted\r\nby my host first, or you will hear of a belly-ache!’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mission started on April 2, and on the 25th Sir John writes\r\nfrom Fas:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had a pleasant journey here, and our companions are agreeable,\r\nclever men.\r\n\r\nReception on entering Fas unusually demonstrative. The Sultan most\r\ngracious; but he is surrounded by venal and ignorant Ministers whose\r\nonly aim is to fill their own pockets, so my preachings and prayings\r\nwill, I fear, not result in any radical reforms.\r\n\r\nWhen my back is turned, Sultan will be deceived, and the progress\r\nin cow-tail fashion will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the petty obstacles which beset his path and the way in\r\nwhich he overcame them may be gathered from the following account\r\nwritten by Sir John of an interview with the Uzir Sid Mokhta.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving learnt that it was not the intention of the Uzir to return my\r\nvisit of ceremony on arrival, I sent a message to him to this effect:\r\n‘On what day and at what hour will it be convenient for the Uzir\r\nto return the visit of ceremony I propose to pay him?’\r\n\r\nHe replied that he could not return the visit of any person,\r\nMohammedan or Christian, as he was connected by marriage with the\r\nSultan. To this my reply was, through the interpreter, that I could\r\nnot admit such an excuse, for if he was connected in the female line\r\nby marriage with Sultan Hassan, an ancestor of my family descended\r\nin direct line from Queen Arabella of Scotland. Therefore, on the\r\nsame pretext of alliance with royalty, I could decline to call\r\nupon him! After an interchange of many messages, this question of\r\netiquette was referred to the Sultan, who declared that the Uzir\r\nwas to return my visit the day after I had called.\r\n\r\nThis Uzir had also declined to introduce the word ‘Sir’ in his\r\nletters to me, or to put the equivalent in Arabic, giving as an excuse\r\nthat it was contrary to the precepts of the Mohammedan religion to\r\naddress any Christian by a term which was, as he had been given to\r\nunderstand, equivalent to ‘Sid,’ meaning Lord or Master.\r\n\r\nTo this I replied that unless he prefixed the title, which my own\r\nSovereign had given me and which was made use of in Her Majesty’s\r\nletter of credence to the Sultan, it was out of the question to expect\r\nthat I should address him as ‘Sid’ or by any other title. The Uzir\r\noffered to address me verbally, or in writing, by the Spanish word\r\n‘Caballero.’ I replied that I was not a Spaniard, and therefore\r\ndeclined to be addressed by a Spanish title; but if from a religious\r\npoint of view he persisted in declining to use the English word\r\n‘Sir’ or a synonymous Arabic title in writing to me, I should,\r\nin addressing him a letter, give him, in addition to that of Uzir,\r\nthe same title or preface that he granted to my name.\r\n\r\nThis question was also referred to the Sultan, who decided that the\r\nUzir should address me as the ‘Minister of the Queen of Great\r\nBritain,’ without putting my name, and that I should in like\r\nmanner address the Uzir without putting his name. I told the Uzir,\r\nwhen we met, that such a discussion was most puerile, and would be\r\nso considered by statesmen and diplomatists, both in Mohammedan and\r\nChristian countries; that it was not worth the waste of time and\r\npaper, and I should let it drop, accepting the Sultan’s decision.\r\n\r\nWe then interchanged visits without further question; but a few\r\ndays after these visits of etiquette, having occasion to interview\r\nthe Uzir on business, I requested him to fix the hour and place of\r\nmeeting. He sent word to me that, as the weather was warm, he would\r\nreceive me in a ‘kubba’ in the garden of his palace, and named\r\nthe hour. I took a ride that morning, and arrived at the Uzir’s\r\nhouse ten minutes before the time fixed for the interview. The\r\nusher of the Uzir received me, and said that his master had not\r\nyet arrived from the Court. I looked at my watch and told the\r\nusher that I had arrived ten minutes before my time, and would\r\ntherefore sit down and await the Uzir. So he led me to a pavilion,\r\nat the end of a long narrow path, where I saw two chairs placed,\r\napparently for the Uzir and myself. The one, facing the entrance,\r\nwas a very gorgeous arm-chair covered with beautiful damask; the\r\nother, on the left of it, an ordinary rush-bottomed wooden chair,\r\nevidently intended as a seat for the British Envoy. I heard at a\r\ndistance the heavy shuffling steps of the unwieldy Uzir, waddling\r\ntowards the spot; so without letting it appear that I was aware of\r\nhis arrival, I took possession of the gorgeous chair, to the dismay\r\nof the usher; saying at the same time in a loud voice, so that the\r\nUzir might hear, ‘What have you done? You must be very ignorant in\r\nmatters of ceremonial forms to have placed such a shabby chair for\r\nyour master the Uzir by the side of this handsome chair, which you\r\nhave prepared for me. Take it away,’ pointing to the rush-bottomed\r\nchair, ‘and bring for your master a proper seat.’\r\n\r\nWith an hysterical laugh the Uzir, seeing the man hesitate, said,\r\n‘The Bashador is right: go and fetch another chair.’ I rose and\r\nsaluted the Uzir, saying, ‘We will converse standing until the\r\nother chair is brought.’\r\n\r\nI had an object in all this, for I knew that by pricking the wind-bag\r\nof vanity and fanaticism of the Uzir I should better prepare him\r\nto treat with me upon business and obtain satisfactory results;\r\nand thus it proved.\r\n\r\nIn a private conversation with the Sultan one day, I alluded in\r\ndelicate language to the stupidity and unfitness of Uzir Mokhta. His\r\nMajesty replied, smiling at my remark, that Alarbi Mokhta being the\r\nchief of a powerful tribe, the ‘Jarmai,’ he had placed him in an\r\ninfluential position, adding, ‘he is yet an unbroken “tsaur”\r\n(ox), who in due time will be tamed by the yoke and will improve.’\r\n\r\nThe palace built by Mokhta since his appointment as Uzir is worthy of\r\nhis ancestors the Moors of Spain, who erected the splendid monuments\r\nof architecture at Granada and Seville.\r\n\r\nThe arches, the designs in stucco, the wooden ceilings, all carved\r\nand painted in elaborate arabesque, are as beautiful as those of\r\nthe ancient palaces I have seen in Andalusia.\r\n\r\nThe Uzir is said to have spent on this building upwards of $100,000,\r\nmoney obtained by peculation, extortion, and other corrupt practices;\r\nfor, though the Sultan’s Ministers are not paid, the emoluments\r\nderived from his official position by the Uzir far exceed the salary\r\nof our Prime Minister at home.\r\n\r\nThough Mokhta did not, and never could, like me, yet, as a proof that\r\nmy action and language took the nonsense out of him, the morning\r\nI left the Court, when about to call on the Uzir to take leave,\r\nI met him, and having mentioned my intention, he begged me not to\r\ntake the trouble to call, saying that he would have the pleasure of\r\naccompanying me to the gates of the town (a mile distant). This he\r\ndid, and we parted apparently the best of friends.\r\n\r\nPoison is said to be frequently employed at the Court to get rid of\r\nobnoxious persons of rank. A cup of coffee is a dangerous beverage\r\nwhen offered by a Moorish host, with whom you may not happen to be\r\non friendly terms. The effect of the subtle poison which can thus\r\nbe administered is rarely immediate; but weeks or months after,\r\nthe victim’s hair commences to fall off, and he dies gradually in\r\na state of emaciation.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, after an angry discussion with Mokhta, coffee\r\nwas brought. I noticed that he took the cup intended for me,\r\nput it to his lips, making a noise as if sipping,—but which I\r\nthought sounded suspiciously like blowing into the liquid,—and\r\nthen offered it to me. Not fancying the bubbled coffee, I declined,\r\nsaying to the Uzir, ‘I could not drink before you; pray keep that\r\ncup yourself’—helping myself, while speaking, to the other,\r\nwhich I drank.\r\n\r\nThe Uzir put down the cup he had offered me, without drinking\r\nit. This, after all, he may have done from tiff, and not because\r\nthere was really any poison in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the Mission to Tangier, Sir John writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all returned hearty and happy; A. the colour of mahogany, and I\r\nof a saucepan. Our companions were charming. There was not a murmur\r\nor a difference of opinion, except perhaps on politics.\r\n\r\nSultan was perfectly charming in my private interviews, and His\r\nSherifian Majesty enjoyed my jokes, for, you know, as the bubbles\r\nrise in my empty head, I let them escape.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers were most attentive, and all the officers at the Court\r\nvied one with another in their attempts to pay us honour and to be\r\nhospitable. The Uzir is an ignorant fanatic. We parted good friends;\r\nbut I think I left him in a shaky position _vis-à-vis_ his master. I\r\nobserved to His Sherifian Majesty casually, ‘In other countries I\r\nhave found that Ministers are often wiser and better informed than\r\ntheir Sovereigns. In Morocco I find Your Majesty far superior to\r\nyour Uzir.’\r\n\r\nThe Sultan has agreed that a revision of the Commercial Treaty of 1856\r\nis to be entered on when his Minister for Foreign Affairs returns,\r\nand steps are then to be taken to improve commerce. Prohibition placed\r\non the exportation of grain removed. A port in the Wadnun district\r\nis to be opened to trade. Steps are to be taken to reform the system\r\nof government, and at the Sultan’s request I gave him a list of\r\nthe Governors who are notorious for their tyranny and extortions,\r\nimpressing on His Sherifian Majesty that he should endeavour to modify\r\nthe evils of the existing system by a judicious choice; but that\r\nthe most careful selection would not avail to secure competent and\r\nupright Governors so long as the uncertainty of their tenure tempted\r\nthem to secure it by corrupt influence for which extortion must find\r\nthe means: that this reform requires attention for the maintenance of\r\norder, administration of justice, and the collection of the revenue.\r\n\r\nI obtained also a royal order to Bargash, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, to attend to all appeals of Jews who cannot obtain justice\r\nfrom Governors in the interior. Then I obtained a settlement of some\r\nfifteen claims of British subjects.\r\n\r\nA mole is to be built at Tangier, and an order obtained for building,\r\nor rather repairing, the mole at Mogador, which, in consequence of\r\nthe state of Moorish finances, had not been executed.\r\n\r\nWorks are also to be undertaken for the better supply of water for\r\nTangier when the state of finances permits.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan is well-disposed, clever, and intelligent; but my work is\r\nonly a quarter done, for the difficulty with all Eastern Governments\r\nis to obtain the execution of royal edicts that have been received.\r\n\r\nI tried to induce Sultan not to give me a horse, &c.; but His Majesty\r\nwas irate, and said that if he did not give me a public mark of his\r\ngoodwill, his subjects would be displeased and a wrong inference would\r\nbe drawn. So I had to accept the ‘white elephant’ and trappings,\r\nsword and gun; all very beautiful. The three latter gifts I have\r\ntold Lord G. I accept on official grounds, and therefore wish to\r\npresent them to the Kensington Museum through the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who accompanied me received handsome swords of honour;\r\nA. and A., two beautiful dresses; the interpreters and Arab secretary,\r\nmules.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Sir John was promoted to the rank of Envoy Extraordinary,\r\nand among his friends there was apparently some expectation that\r\nhe might be chosen to succeed Sir Henry Layard at Constantinople;\r\nbut in reply to a letter to that effect he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nMy memory fails me and I quite forget if I have acknowledged several\r\npleasant letters from you, and amongst them one expressing a hope\r\nthat I might replace Layard. It is very good of you to say that I\r\nshould be a fit man for the post, but I cannot agree with you. Honest\r\nand conscientious I am; but I have neither the pen nor the tongue\r\nto conduct affairs upon which the fate of nations will depend.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letters from his former colleague at Tangier, Monsieur\r\nTissot, show that, whatever he might himself have thought of his\r\nfitness for the appointment, he would have been cordially welcomed\r\nby the French Ambassador.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Ambassade de France, Thérapia, _Juillet 11_, 1880.\r\n\r\nJe n’ai vu Sir Henry Layard qu’au moment même de son départ. Je\r\nne puis pas dire que je le regrette: il me serait difficile de\r\nsouhaiter un collègue plus agréable que Mr. Goschen et il est\r\nimpossible que l’union entre les deux Ambassades soit plus intime\r\net plus confiante qu’elle ne l’est. Mais Mr. Goschen ne restera\r\npas à Constantinople et je vous demande qui lui succédera?\r\n\r\nJe veux espérer que ce sera vous. Je vous ai toujours donné\r\nrendezvous ici, vous vous le rappelez. Faites en sorte de me tenir\r\nparole. Ce serait pour moi une joie bien vive, mon cher ami, que\r\nd’aller vous recevoir à bord de l’‘Antelope.’ Il n’est\r\npas de jour où je ne vous regrette, et j’espère, encore une fois,\r\nque nous recommencerons ici, côte à côte, nos travaux herculéens\r\ndu Maroc. L’‘étable’ est plus vaste et proportionnellement\r\nencore plus sale que celle de notre ami Mulai Hassen (que Dieu le\r\nrende victorieux).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second letter from M. Tissot, written from Pera, is dated nearly\r\na year later.\r\n\r\n\r\nMON CHER AMI,\r\n\r\nJe m’empresse de vous remercier de votre affectueuse lettre:\r\nvotre écriture ‘torrentielle’ trahit toujours la vigueur et\r\nl’activité enragée que je vous ai connue. Excellent signe! ما\r\nشاء الله[58]\r\n\r\nJ’ai reconnu votre amitié à la façon dont vous avez bien voulu\r\nme présenter à mon futur collègue: j’espère vivre avec lui\r\nen d’aussi bons termes politiques qu’avec vous, bien que ce ne\r\nsoit pas toujours facile sur le terrain de Constantinople. Je suis\r\nsûr, tout au moins, que nous nous querellerons aussi amicalement\r\nqu’avec Goschen qui a emporté de moi, m’assure-t-on, le souvenir\r\naffectueux qu’il m’a laissé. Nous n’avons pas toujours été\r\ndu même avis, mais notre intimité n’en a jamais souffert,—au\r\ncontraire, et notre estime réciproque s’est accrue de toute la\r\ndéférence qu’une paire de poings solides inspire à une autre\r\npaire de même trempe.\r\n\r\nComme je ne connais pas encore Dufferin, j’ai le droit de\r\nvous dire, mon cher ami, que c’est vous que je désirais ici\r\net que la nomination a même été une déception pour moi. Vos\r\ninstincts ‘rather pugnacious’ trouveraient ici matière à ample\r\nsatisfaction: Old Turkey (vous êtes libre à traduire ‘le vieux\r\ndindon’) est plus fanatique et plus réfractaire que jamais à\r\nl’influence européenne. De plus, il n’y a plus de Gouvernement\r\nturc: le Sultan, ou pour mieux dire le Khalifa, comme il se plaît\r\nà se désigner lui-même dans les notes qu’il nous adresse, a\r\ntout confisqué et prétend tout faire pour lui-même, sûr moyen\r\nde ne rien faire. La Porte n’est plus qu’un décor de théâtre\r\nqui s’ouvre sur le vide.\r\n\r\nGoschen a apporté ici plus d’illusions qu’il n’en remporte. Je\r\nl’avais prévenu dès son arrivée.\r\n\r\nNous venons cependant, après une année du plus dur labeur, de\r\nrésoudre les deux questions Monténégrine et Grecque. Je vais\r\nme reposer sur ce double succès. Je pars dans huit jours pour\r\nVichy _via Paris_ et je laisserai à mon Chargé d’Affaires le\r\nsoin et l’honneur de combattre à côté de Lord Dufferin dans la\r\nquestion arménienne, ‘confound it!’ Nous avons sué huit jours,\r\nGoschen et moi, à rédiger la fameuse note en faveur de réformes\r\narméniennes. La Porte s’en est émue comme d’une noisette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n                              1881-1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monotonous tale of Moorish apathy is continued, only diversified\r\nby occasional gleams of hope that he had succeeded in rousing the\r\nSultan to a sense of his position—a hope never fulfilled. Thus on\r\nJanuary 19, 1881, Sir John writes from Tangier:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThings are looking better in the interior. The Sultan has addressed\r\nenergetic letters to all the Governors, rebuking them for the state\r\nof misgovernment, and threatening his dire displeasure if murderers\r\nand malefactors are not arrested and punished.\r\n\r\n_Entre nous_, I have pulled this wire; but His Sultanic Majesty might\r\nalmost as well have addressed me a letter on the state of Ireland.\r\n\r\nNow I am at work for the revision of our Convention of Commerce, as\r\ninstructed by the Foreign Office. Merchants of course expect much,\r\nfar more than I can obtain. I am communicating with some who are very\r\nsanguine. I have pointed to the conduct of civilised Governments\r\nwho reject liberal measures, and ask how they can expect ignorant\r\nfolk like Moorish Ministers to introduce free trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on April 7:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI have worked up the Treaty, but cannot get the torpid Bargash to\r\nrespond. All must go to Sultan, and His Majesty will require two\r\nmonths to consider.\r\n\r\nThe debt of Morocco to British Loan Contractors expires next\r\nyear. $30,000,000 have passed through my hand as Commissioner. No pay:\r\nnothing has stuck. Alhamdulillah[59].\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning from a brief holiday spent in Europe he found the old\r\nstate of affairs unchanged:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _August 30_, 1881.\r\n\r\nWe are quiet in Morocco, but there are rumblings. If the French\r\nmake any rash movements towards Morocco territory we might have an\r\noutbreak of fanaticism, and then the direst consequences may ensue.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan is still marching towards Marákesh, ‘eating up’\r\nhis indigestible subjects, and thus preparing them to welcome the\r\nNazarene.\r\n\r\nBargash has not returned, so nothing has been done about\r\nConvention. These Moors understand the value of _vis inertiae_. I\r\nam sick of them, and some day may strike work, for counsels are all\r\nthrown away on such a corrupt torpid brute as the present Uzir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Ravensrock, _Oct. 9_, 1881.\r\n\r\nI think the French will leave Morocco alone. They must bide their\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe world does not form a favourable opinion of the result\r\nof the prospect they held out of introducing civilisation and\r\nprosperity. Instead we have murders, robbers, and the fanatical\r\nfeelings of a quiet inoffensive people roused. A gentleman who\r\nresides in Algeria describes the treatment of the Arab population\r\nin the interior there before the insurrection, as being as hard as\r\nthat of the poor people in this country.\r\n\r\nHundreds extort money and grind down the Mohammedans. I dare say we\r\nwere as bad in India _years ago_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John was at this time more than usually despondent of the future\r\nof Morocco, for another of his favourite projects for the improvement\r\nof trade had met with a complete check. Ever since the Commercial\r\nTreaty of 1856 he had continuously urged on the Moorish Government\r\nthe importance of allowing the exportation of grain. All his efforts\r\nwere, however, without result until 1881, when a half-hearted trial\r\nof the new system was made. Unfortunately in this year a prolonged\r\ndrought, with consequent failure of crops, resulted in a famine,\r\nand the superstitious Moors at the Court at once concluded that the\r\nDeity was angered at the innovation, and they therefore refused to\r\nrenew the permission to export grain in following years.\r\n\r\nThe results of the famine were, in other ways, most distressing. The\r\npeasantry, fired by the prospect of a larger market for their grain,\r\nhad greatly extended cultivation, and many square miles of land,\r\nbarren before, had been ploughed and sown, and, with the usual\r\nimprovidence of a poor and thoughtless race, they had raised money\r\nfrom usurers on their ungrown crops. Thus with the complete failure\r\nof these crops, nearly the whole population of the immense arable\r\nplains of Morocco were reduced, not only to beggary, but to absolute\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nOnce more Sir John proceeded to the Court, and endeavoured to rouse\r\nthe Moors to action.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We are off to-morrow,’ he writes on March 28,\r\n1882. ‘H.M.S. “Salamis,” takes us to Dar-el-Baida, then we go\r\nto Marákesh by land. Sultan sends escort, &c., &c. to meet us. The\r\nFrench have preceded us, Italian and Spanish Ministers follow. These\r\nMissions are like locusts eating up the country, and, alas! no rain\r\nfalls, and failure of crops and consequent famine are menaced. . . .\r\n\r\n‘A fierce stand has been made against modification of the scale\r\nof duties by this stupid people. But I have other fish to fry at\r\nthe Court. Sysiphus will continue to roll up his stone to the last.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John in this letter refers to the system of ‘mona’ levied on\r\nthe provinces through which the Missions pass. In times of scarcity\r\nthe tax falls very heavily on the unfortunate peasantry. The Kaids\r\norder much more than is required, and they and the dependants of the\r\nMission often divide the spoil. Sir John always did what he could\r\nto mitigate this evil, fixing the amount of provision required, and\r\nappointing one of his staff to watch the distribution. Any surplus\r\nwas sold by auction each day, and the proceeds given to the poor of\r\nthe district. The Spanish Minister adopted the same system on his\r\nvisit to the Court at this time.\r\n\r\nThe next letter shows him immersed in business at Marákesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Dar-Mulai-Ali, Marákesh, _April 21_, 1882.\r\n\r\nI am so bothered with work that I hate the sight of a pen and ink,\r\neven when writing to those I love.\r\n\r\nIt is getting very hot here. In the shade about 80° (Fahrenheit)\r\nat 2 p.m.; but in our rooms, in this thick-walled house, 71°. We\r\nare very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan is most gracious and flattering, but he wants to keep me\r\nuntil Dons and Italian Mission have come and gone. If so, we shall\r\nbe here for a month more. The French Minister went away pleased,\r\nand thanked me for aiding him in getting satisfactory answers.\r\n\r\nNothing is decided about the new Convention. I find the greatest\r\nopposition to any free trade suggestions; but I hammer away, though\r\nI tell them my preachings and warnings have the same effect as the\r\nefforts of a man who attempts to fill a bucket which has no bottom,\r\nor at least a hole in it.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan has assembled twenty-five thousand men to go to Sus to open\r\nports, as we advised. Crops and all vegetation have failed there and\r\nin other Southern provinces. We passed through stunted crops dried\r\nup; no rain. It is most sad; for the Sultan, following my advice,\r\nhad encouraged agriculture—and in the grand rich province of\r\nShawía, through which we passed, we did not see two acres of land\r\nuncultivated. Wheat is far dearer than in England; horses and cattle\r\nare dying; misery everywhere. I am trying to dissuade the Sultan\r\nfrom going to Sus, and urging him to await another year and better\r\nharvest. His troops will desert him and a revolution will follow if\r\nhe should be compelled to retreat. _Nous verrons_ the effect of my\r\nadvice. Everybody, high and low, is begging me to stop the expedition.\r\n\r\nI have settled some affairs and others are in progress. This is an\r\nAugean stable, and I am tired of sweeping, as filth accumulates ten\r\ntimes faster than I can sweep. I tell the Sultan as much.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Dar-Mulai-Ali, in which Sir John was lodged in 1882,\r\nhas attached to it the following story.\r\n\r\nMulai Ali, the late owner, and uncle of Sultan Mulai Hassan, had\r\nbeen a great favourite of the people of Marákesh. A student, kind\r\nand just, he passed his time with the learned men of the city and\r\nin the great mosque, the Kutubía; the grounds of the mosque and\r\nthe beautiful orchard belonging to Mulai Ali being separated only\r\nby a wall, some six feet high, having in it a door of communication.\r\n\r\nOne Friday, not many months before our arrival, the Sultan, his Court\r\nand the people of Marákesh were startled by hearing the ‘muddin’\r\ncry from the minaret of the Kutubía—after the usual chant at\r\nmidday of ‘God is great and Mohammed is his prophet,’—‘Long\r\nlife to our Sultan Mulai Ali.’ The ‘muddin’ was seized and\r\nbrought before the Sultan, and though put to the torture, all he\r\nwould admit was, that God had inspired him and not man—and he\r\nwas thrown into prison. Mulai Ali was also questioned by his royal\r\nnephew, but denied any knowledge of what had taken place—except\r\nthat he had heard the cry. A few days after the occurrence Mulai Ali\r\ndied suddenly—the Court said of apoplexy, but the people whispered\r\npoison, and the Sultan confiscated his property.\r\n\r\nThe house was really beautiful, with a great marble court and\r\nsplashing fountain in the centre. The garden stood right under the\r\nshadow of the Kutubía tower, and therefore it was considered a\r\nspecial compliment that a Christian Envoy should be allowed to live\r\nthere, though of course the door of communication between the mosque\r\nand Mulai Ali’s property was kept closed.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the public audience, Miss Hay rode with her father\r\nto the gate of the palace. There, as on former occasions, she was\r\nabout to dismount, for, as a rule, no mounted person but the Sultan\r\nis allowed within the palace court. But one of the chief ushers came\r\nforward, and said, ‘Sidna (our Lord) desires you will remain on\r\nhorseback.’ He then led her into the great court, which was lined\r\nwith foot-soldiers, and ordering some of the men to stand back, placed\r\nher in front of them; himself, with several subordinate officials,\r\nstanding as a guard before her.\r\n\r\nSir John, with the other members of the Mission, had taken up a\r\nposition in the centre of the court.\r\n\r\nThen from the soldiers the cry arose of ‘Long life to Sidna,’\r\nwhich was caught up and echoed and re-echoed throughout the whole\r\ntown of Marákesh. The large green gate, the private entrance to\r\nthe palace, opened, and the Sultan, riding a milk-white horse, with\r\nhis guard, umbrella-bearer and attendants, entered and rode up to\r\nthe Envoy. After the interview, he passed near where Miss Hay was\r\nstationed, turned his horse so as to face her, and caused it to curvet\r\nand rear slightly, while himself saluting her. She acknowledged the\r\nsalute, and the Sultan proceeded on his way to the palace.\r\n\r\nThis act of courtesy raised much comment among the Moors, as it was\r\nthe first time that the presence of a lady at a public audience had\r\nbeen acknowledged by any Sultan. Next day the Uzir’s wife, a clever\r\nand very pretty woman, congratulated Lady Hay and her daughter on\r\nhaving won such a high mark of favour from His Sherifian Majesty.\r\n\r\nOn the return journey, Sir John writes from the camp at Kasba Jedída,\r\nfour hours’ march from Rabát, on May 30:—\r\n\r\n\r\nAll wondrous well. Actually cold to-day, with a fresh wind blowing\r\nfrom the Atlantic: 74° in tent at 3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nYes, some sneaking, jealous person put in the papers an unfounded\r\nstory about my being stoned. The members of the French Mission did\r\nget into a row, and they had a lot of people arrested and flogged,\r\nand a poor woman came crying to me to aid her in begging for release\r\nof her husband. As to our party, all the Moors, high and low, wild\r\nand tame, vie with each other in showing us attention, civility, and\r\nhospitality. ‘Ingliz, you are just; you are kind; you are generous;\r\nwe look upon you as one of us.’ These are the expressions of every\r\none, including the Sultan.\r\n\r\nMy friend Diosdado[60] has gained golden opinions\r\neverywhere. ‘Kindness and charity; honour bright.’ He has won\r\nthe good-will of the Sultan and his Court, and reversed the bad\r\npolicy that existed. He and I were like brothers.\r\n\r\nI think I told you I was behind the curtain to arrange the question\r\nbetween France and Morocco. . . . the chief object of my Mission\r\nis accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the Commercial Convention is arranged, but nothing will\r\nbe done till the state of the country and prospects improve.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and two claims settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeñor Diosdado, mentioned in the foregoing letter, was the Spanish\r\nEnvoy, who was at Fas on a Mission to the Sultan at the same time as\r\nSir John. One of the members of this Spanish Mission was the Father\r\nSuperior of the Franciscan Brotherhood in Morocco, a very able man,\r\nmuch beloved and esteemed by persons of all nationalities and creeds\r\nthroughout Morocco, and whom Sir John had always regarded as a good\r\nand trusted friend.\r\n\r\nWhen, after Sir John’s death, his elder daughter returned to\r\nTangier in the spring of 1894, the Father Superior called on her,\r\nand expressed heartfelt sympathy with her and her family in their\r\nbereavement, and his regret for the loss to himself of an old and\r\nvalued friend. He added:—\r\n\r\n\r\nYour father always showed me great kindness and friendship, and never\r\nshall I forget how much I owe him for a few words of encouraging\r\nrecommendation at a critical moment.\r\n\r\nIt was during my visit to the Court of Morocco, where I had gone\r\nwith the Spanish Envoy. Your father had preceded us there, also\r\non a Mission to the Sultan, and one evening, immediately after our\r\narrival, I called on His Excellency with the Spanish Minister and\r\nsome of his suite. Sir John happened to be in conclave with one of\r\nthe Sultan’s most influential Ministers, but their conversation\r\nwas suspended during our visit, and we were severally introduced\r\nto this dignitary. When presenting me, your father said, ‘Let me\r\nintroduce my old friend Padre Lerchundi, and recommend him to you\r\nas a good man, a friend to the Moors and kindly to all. Believe me,\r\nyou may put entire trust and confidence in him.’\r\n\r\nThis recommendation, added the Superior, assisted me more than any\r\nrepresentations could have done from other quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropeans, who were ignorant of the nature of the people with whom\r\nSir John had to deal, were prone to attribute the lack of progress\r\nthroughout the country to his apathy. An English Company had been\r\nformed to carry out railway, telegraphic and other works in Morocco,\r\nand Sir John was asked to use his influence to secure concessions. He\r\npromised his aid and did his utmost; but, writing in 1883, after an\r\ninterview with one of the projectors, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring thirty-seven years, having unceasingly worked to obtain all\r\nthis for British subjects without success, I could hold out little\r\nhope that the Company would succeed so long as the present form of\r\nGovernment existed in Morocco and the Sultan’s venal Ministers\r\nremained in power.\r\n\r\nI said, however, that he should carry out his intention of visiting\r\nthe Court, and then he would be able to judge from all he heard and\r\nsaw whether there was any hope of success; for people in England\r\nseem to be foolishly impressed with the idea that I uphold this\r\nGovernment in its rejection of all improvements and reforms.\r\n\r\nThe state of this country becomes daily more hopeless, and I do\r\nnot see even a glimmering of hope for the future. Unjust claims are\r\ndaily pressed on them, and protected Jews concoct false documents\r\nand extract thousands of dollars from the Mohammedans. I have warned\r\nthe chief Jews that, if the Sultan dies and there is a revolution,\r\nthe Mohammedans will not forget their wrongs, and there will be a\r\ngeneral massacre.\r\n\r\nI am sick of Morocco and its affairs, and am thinking seriously of\r\ntaking off the galling collar; for I pull and pull, and the vehicle\r\nonly backs. . . .\r\n\r\nOne of the Company formed for regenerating Morocco has started for\r\nthe Court. I am glad; for the Company will learn, I expect, that it\r\nis not Drummond Hay who stops the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the forward policy of France was already producing serious\r\nresults in Morocco, which seemed in the near future likely to assume\r\nstill more formidable proportions. Writing from London on October 4,\r\nSir John expresses his fears of the effect of French machinations:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of France appears to be that of paralysing all government\r\nand authority of the Sultan by covert proceedings, and, when anarchy\r\ntakes place, then, perhaps, _la Grande Nation_ hopes to be asked by\r\nthe civilised world to step in and protest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following spring matters looked very serious, and, after his\r\nreturn from a week’s pigsticking at the ‘Lakes,’ he writes to\r\nhis sister on the subject, after a short allusion to his favourite\r\nsport:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Ravensrock, _May 20_, 1884.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed our camp life during the first week of May, though\r\nfor two days it blew an easterly hurricane, which spoilt our\r\nsport. Nevertheless fourteen of the enemy were slain. J.’s fine\r\nhorse badly wounded; also the horse of the Basha’s son.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps have seen in the papers contradictory reports\r\nabout the state of relations between France and Morocco,—telegrams\r\nasserting that relations are broken off and flag hauled down; then\r\ntelegrams declaring that the most friendly relations exist. The\r\nfact is Ordega has been blustering here and threatens to break off\r\nrelations, to march an army across the frontier, to send a fleet\r\nand encourage the Sheríf[61] to raise the standard of rebellion\r\nand march upon the capital, and that a French force would cross\r\nthe frontier and support him. All this to obtain the dismissal of\r\nJebar, the Khalífa of Wazan, who was unfriendly to the Sheríf, the\r\n_protégé_ of France. Some one of Jebar’s dependants had called\r\nthe Sheríf’s son an infidel for accepting French protection;\r\nupon which the latter seized the Moor and had him flogged and poured\r\nboiling water on him. Naturally, a few days afterwards he died. Then\r\nOrdega sent a Secretary of Legation to inquire about this, and\r\nthe Sheríf’s son brought his witnesses to prove that Jebar had\r\npoisoned his own dependant[62]!\r\n\r\nThe Sultan refused to dismiss Jebar without inquiry. Then followed\r\nmenace upon menace, and finally Ordega left for Paris. The French\r\nflag was hauled down, and all letters from Moorish authorities were\r\nreturned by the _Chargé d’Affaires_. The impression of course\r\nleft on the mind of the Sultan and of every one (except myself)\r\nwas that war was imminent. I telegraphed to my Government, and so\r\ndid my other colleagues. Lord G. telegraphed back that Ferry assured\r\nhim the Governments of Morocco and France were on the most friendly\r\nrelations, and that they had no desire to create disturbance. In\r\nthe meantime the Sultan appealed to the Austrian, British, German,\r\nItalian, and Spanish Governments against the proceedings of Ordega\r\nin affording protection to the Sheríf, his sons, and thousands\r\nof dependants, and complained that he was fomenting insurrection\r\nby sending emissaries to all parts of the Empire to call upon the\r\npopulation to rebel against His Sherifian Majesty’s authority. No\r\nreply has as yet been given to this appeal, and the conspiracy\r\ncontinues, backed by the French. I think it probable, however,\r\nthat Ordega has misled his Government and declared that he has not\r\ndone what he has done; for he took care not to write his threats,\r\nand when a letter was addressed to him containing a repetition of\r\nall he had menaced, he would not receive it.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Paris an article appeared in the _Gaulois_ of\r\nMay 8, signed by the Editor, making calumnious charges regarding\r\nthe corrupt practices of all the Representatives (myself included)\r\nexcept the German. Then on the 10th, in consequence of the demand of\r\na Spanish diplomat resident at Paris, the Editor retracted as regards\r\nDiosdado. I telegraphed to Lord G. that I required retraction and\r\nan apology to be inserted in the _Gaulois_: for the Editor openly\r\ndeclares that he has reported the language held by Ordega to Ferry\r\non May 7, and subsequently communicated to him.\r\n\r\nThe Italian and Portuguese Ministers both wrote to their Governments\r\nto demand satisfaction.\r\n\r\nS. takes it up personally, and threatens to call out Ordega if an\r\napology is not offered.\r\n\r\nOur days of Quixotism are passed; but my fingers tingle to box the\r\nfellow’s ears. I do not know how he can return here amidst the\r\nnest of hornets he has roused. . . .\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, just at this crisis, i.e. on the 14th, appeared an\r\narticle in the _Times_ which declares that England has no commanding\r\ninterest in the political condition of Morocco, leading the reader to\r\nbelieve that the action of France is beneficial to British interests.\r\n\r\nThis leader may have been inspired by those who desire to prepare and\r\nmould the minds of the British public for the prosecution of their\r\nundoubted future, if not immediate, design of becoming mistress\r\nof the Straits and of the Mediterranean from Spartel to Tripoli,\r\nand perhaps hereafter to Egypt.\r\n\r\nShould France annex or establish a protectorate over Morocco, the\r\nport of Tangier might be made a safe and well-fortified harbour\r\nfor torpedo vessels and the like craft, and other harbours could be\r\nformed likewise to the eastward between Tangier and Ceuta. France and\r\nSpain would probably be allied in case of war, and our shipping would\r\nonly pass by running the gauntlet. Gibraltar must fall or come to\r\nbe of little value as a harbour of refuge. Nelson said, ‘Tangier\r\nmust either remain in the hands of a neutral Power like Morocco,\r\nor England must hold it.’ Of what avail is it that we took our\r\nstand about the passage of the Dardanelles, and defended at such\r\ncost our free passage through the Suez Canal, if this end of the way\r\nto the East and to India can be stopped when it pleases France? Yet\r\nthe _Times_ says, ‘we have no political interest in Morocco.’\r\n\r\nThis article is based on a letter dated May 12, addressed to the\r\nEditor of the _Times_ by the Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society,\r\nwherein he dwells, and with strong grounds, upon the state of\r\nmisgovernment, slavery, and other abuses in this country; but\r\nMr. Allen is not always correct, especially when he speaks of my\r\nbeing ‘all-powerful,’ and yet intimates that I do not use my\r\ninfluence to good purpose.\r\n\r\nThe leader in the _Times_ says that (in the case of the man murdered\r\nat Wazan) ‘the action of France has on the whole tended to promote\r\nthe cause of civilisation, good government, and freedom in a country\r\nwhich has long been a stranger to these blessings.’\r\n\r\nNow I know not one single act of the French Government or its\r\nRepresentative in this country which has been beneficial to the cause\r\nof civilisation or introduced any reform or improvement in Morocco,\r\nand I defy any Frenchman to state them. The compulsory payment by\r\nthe Moorish Government of numerous claims of French citizens and\r\nprotected subjects has certainly been obtained, but that can hardly be\r\nregarded as beneficial to civilisation, unless the protection afforded\r\nto the Sheríf can be considered beneficent. If the proceedings of\r\nthe Sheríf are not put a stop to, and civil war ensues, a state of\r\nanarchy will be produced, and probably a massacre of the unfortunate\r\nJews in the interior.\r\n\r\nThis would benefit civilisation!\r\n\r\nThe form of Government in Morocco is the worst in the world. No\r\nofficials except the Customs Officers are paid. The consequence\r\nis that all live by peculation, extortion, and bribery; or, in the\r\nwords of a Moor describing the system, ‘We are like fishes—the\r\nbig live by eating up the small.’ The population is reduced to\r\nmisery by the avarice of the Governors, and the latter, who have to\r\nsend twice a year large sums of money to satisfy the rapacity of the\r\nMinisters, are constantly killing the geese (the farmers) to get the\r\ngolden eggs. No security for life or property, no encouragement to\r\nindustry—and it is only a matter of wonder that the whole country\r\nis not allowed to lie fallow.\r\n\r\nThe people are a fine race; but, since the days when they were\r\nejected from Spain and returned to Morocco to be subject to the rule\r\nof Sultans who are Pope-Kings, they have degenerated gradually and\r\nbecome a degraded people.\r\n\r\nI am described by Mr. Allen as being all-powerful. If so, the\r\ninference naturally is that I have neglected to do my duty in\r\nrequiring the Sultan and his Government to introduce reforms and\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nI have never ceased for nearly forty years to preach and pray, to\r\nurge and beg. My archives are full of notes addressed to Ministers\r\nof the Moorish Government, with suggestions and propositions for\r\nimproving commerce, introducing railways, roads, telegraphs, mining\r\noperations, removal of restrictions on commerce, &c., &c. All this,\r\nhowever, to little purpose, for the venal advisers of the Sultan\r\nhave no interest in reforms or improvements when they do not see a\r\ndirect means of filling their own pockets. Promises are frequently\r\nmade to me, but rarely fulfilled. I have lately received promises\r\nthat the prohibition on the exportation of barley and wheat, now\r\nlying rotting in granaries, will be removed, and yet they hesitate\r\nand delay; and so it is with everything.\r\n\r\nYet I may conscientiously declare that the few improvements which\r\nhave been effected in this country have been brought about through\r\nmy representations and acts.\r\n\r\nI have worked hard of late to obtain the revision of the Treaty\r\nof Commerce (of 1856), which has been agreed to by the Sultan; but\r\nstill the old story of promise, pause, postpone, and then leave the\r\nmatter alone.\r\n\r\nI have frequently pointed out to my masters at home that if we\r\nconsider it desirable that the independence and integrity of a neutral\r\nSovereign like the Sultan should be upheld, so that the passage of\r\nour shipping through the Straits should remain free in time of peace\r\nor war, it is _our_ duty, it is the duty of _all_ those Powers who\r\ndesire to maintain the _status quo_, to take a more active and decided\r\npart than they have done hitherto in requiring the Sultan and his\r\nMinisters to introduce reforms and improvements, and that the people\r\nof this country, who can be almost seen from the shores of Europe,\r\nshould not be allowed to remain in their present degraded state—a\r\ndisgrace to civilisation. But this is a totally different view of\r\nthe question from that of allowing France to become the mistress\r\nof the great gut of commerce, where all our shipping must pass when\r\nbound for the East or for India, and to say to us _Ne plus ultra_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain on June 13, 1884, Sir John returns to the subject of French\r\ndesigns and British apathy:—\r\n\r\n\r\nPapers will tell you much of passing events here, some correct,\r\nothers, especially French, full of mis-statements. Did you see the\r\n_Standard_ of June 3?\r\n\r\nIt contains an admirable article and a letter from ‘One who\r\nKnows.’\r\n\r\nJohn Bull ought to know what our insidious neighbours are about,\r\nthough singing to our Government ‘Lullaby, lullaby,’ whilst\r\npreparing the mine which will explode when it suits their purpose\r\nto make themselves masters of the Straits and Southern coast of the\r\nMediterranean from Spartel to Tripoli!\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the papers that Ordega returned in an ironclad\r\nand demanded that the fort should salute the French flag with\r\ntwenty-one guns before his landing, and that the acting Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and all the authorities should come down to the\r\npier to meet him. ‘To hear is to obey,’ with the heavy guns of\r\nthe ‘Redoutable’ pointed at this wretched town; and all asked\r\nfor was conceded.\r\n\r\nYesterday a squadron of eight ships (!) arrived here; they remain,\r\nI am told, at the disposition of Ordega.\r\n\r\nP.S.—Just as I closed my letter the French squadron left, and I\r\ngot a note to say some arrangement has been made about protection\r\nto the Sheríf, and that the question of frontier is deferred. It\r\nwill come on, however, before long.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the time the danger, as the following letter shows, was\r\naverted:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI said to a colleague the other day that man was prone to attribute\r\nto the machinations of the devil anything that was adverse, whereas\r\nthe poor devil is the victim of his traducers; thus, I said, it is\r\nwith me. Whatever goes wrong in Morocco is attributed to that _bête\r\nnoire_—Drummond Hay.\r\n\r\nI know not whether you have seen another clever letter of ‘One\r\nwho Knows’ in the _Standard_ of 30th ult.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the last paragraph, I have to say that a great\r\nchange has come over Ordega since the hurried departure of the French\r\nsquadron (ordered by telegraph). He has altered his tone with the\r\nMoorish Government and the local authorities, and has told the Sheríf\r\nhe cannot support the tribes who seek for his protection against\r\nthe authority of the Sultan. The question of rectifying the frontier\r\nhas also been abandoned, and the most solemn assurances are given to\r\nItaly, Spain, and England that France will not disturb the _status\r\nquo_, unless a state of anarchy takes place in Morocco compelling\r\nher to interfere. That is, however, the question. Insurrection has\r\nbeen prevented, and the Sultan has given orders for the chastisement\r\nof the disaffected tribes. This system of ‘eating up’ rebels,\r\nwhich you can remember in the time of the old Sultan, renders of\r\ncourse the Sovereign most unpopular with his unfortunate subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to the calumnious article in the _Gaulois_ to which\r\nhe had called Lord Granville’s attention, he writes from London\r\non October 18, 1884:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just received a courteous private letter from Lord Granville,\r\nsaying he had delayed replying to my letter as he has been in\r\ncommunication with Waddington; he asks to see me on Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the interview is given in a letter three days later:—\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Granville was very civil and kind.\r\n\r\nFerry shirked getting justice done by publishing a disclaimer. His\r\nLordship agreed that a question should be put in the House of\r\nLords. He only asked that Zouche should give him notice, and\r\npromised to reply in a manner that would be satisfactory to me. I\r\ngave him a full dose; outpouring all that was in my heart, both about\r\nabuse and my having been passed over in the course of my career by\r\njuniors—being told my ‘services were too useful in Morocco to\r\nbe dispensed with’—and now, I said, ‘the public press declares\r\nthat I am useless and stop the way,’ &c.\r\n\r\nLord Granville looked blandly at me, now and then making encouraging\r\nremarks, such as, ‘_Your character stands too high_ to be affected\r\nby the attacks of men like Monsieur Ordega, and that bankrupt\r\nfellow,’ meaning ———.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the subject was mentioned in the House of Lords, Her\r\nMajesty’s Government had given proof that they did not underrate\r\nSir John’s integrity and good service, thereby affording him\r\nsincere satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I think you will be glad to hear,’ he writes from Ravensrock\r\nin November, 1884, ‘that I have just received a note from Lord\r\nGranville announcing that Her Majesty has been pleased to confer upon\r\nme the G.C.M.G., “in recognition of my long and good service.”\r\nI confess I care little to add some letters of the alphabet after\r\nmy name, but I am pleased at the discomfiture of enemies who have\r\nbeen plotting against me. My French colleague will have an attack\r\nof the _English_ malady, “spleen.” He is now treating with these\r\nunfortunate Moors at the cannon’s mouth.\r\n\r\n‘An ironclad is in the bay to support his demands. He seeks for\r\nrevenge, on account of the humiliation suffered by his _protégé_\r\nand dupe the Sheríf, who is now treated almost as an outcast by\r\nthe Moors of Tangier, and is called the Sheríf “francés.”’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question to which Sir John referred in his interview with Lord\r\nGranville was asked by a personal friend in the House of Lords. It\r\nelicited replies which completely exonerated him from all the blame\r\nwhich had been cast upon him, and was made the occasion for the\r\nstrongest expressions of satisfaction with his long and arduous\r\nservices. The following passages are taken from the _Times_ of\r\nNovember 22, 1884:—\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Zouche asked Her Majesty’s Government whether any official\r\ndenial had been published by the French Government to an article\r\nwhich appeared in the _Gaulois_ newspaper in the spring of this year\r\nwherein the editor accused several of the Foreign Representatives at\r\nTangier of corrupt practices, and among them the British Minister,\r\nSir John Drummond Hay, stating that he (the editor) had obtained\r\nthis information from the French Minister at Tangier, M. Ordega,\r\nwho was at that time in Paris on leave of absence; and, as it would\r\nappear that, owing to the fact of no denial having been given to\r\nthose grave charges, other accusations were made by French journals\r\nwhich were referred to in English journals to the effect that Sir\r\nJ. D. Hay had obstructed British enterprise and commerce, and had\r\nencouraged the Sultan of Morocco in his policy of resistance to all\r\nreform and improvement, whether there were any grounds for such grave\r\ncharges having been put forward. Sir John Hay had been passed over by\r\nmany of his juniors, and had now been upwards of forty years in his\r\npresent post, and he and his friends thought it incumbent upon them\r\nto have some sort of public contradiction of these most unfounded\r\ncharges and some sort of public vindication of his character.\r\n\r\nEarl Granville.—My Lords, I think the noble lord has correctly\r\nstated the facts of the case. The editor of the _Gaulois_, it appears,\r\naccused Sir John Hay and his colleagues of most intolerable practices,\r\nand gave M. Ordega as his authority. Now, I am not sure that if I\r\nread such an article as this concerning myself I should not treat\r\nit with contempt and trust to whatever character I had. But it is a\r\ndifferent thing when men serving their country in distant countries\r\nare thus unjustly attacked, for, as in this case, the extract from\r\nthe French paper is copied not only into other foreign newspapers,\r\nbut into English newspapers. However, after what has occurred I\r\nthought it necessary, at the request of Sir J. D. Hay, to make an\r\napplication to M. Ferry, in courteous terms, that M. Ordega should be\r\ncalled upon either to substantiate, or retract, or to say that he had\r\nnot communicated the article to the _Gaulois_. M. Ferry, in the first\r\ninstance, said the _Gaulois_ was perfectly wrong, that no such report\r\nhad been circulated by Ordega himself, and that he thought that it\r\nwas hardly worth while to contradict a statement made in a newspaper\r\nwhich was well known to be so strongly opposed to the existing French\r\nGovernment. M. Ordega was, however, applied to, and he telegraphed\r\nto Paris entirely denying that he had communicated or inspired any\r\nsuch article in the _Gaulois_. M. Ferry took the view that a great\r\ndeal of time had elapsed, and that it was really better not to call\r\nattention to the matter now. I have been in correspondence with Sir\r\nJ. D. Hay, and the last letter I received from him, only a day or two\r\nago, was to the effect that he was perfectly satisfied and that he\r\nshould trouble his head no more in the matter. I am glad to be able\r\nto add that I believe there is no man in the diplomatic service more\r\nhonourable or more energetic in the discharge of his duties than Sir\r\nJ. D. Hay. The noble lord says that Sir J. D. Hay has been passed\r\nover for promotion; but I remember instances where persons employed\r\nin the diplomatic service have been, to use a homely phrase, kicked\r\nupstairs to get them out of a place where they were doing mischief\r\ninstead of good. I believe it to be exactly the contrary in the case\r\nof Sir John Drummond Hay. He is most fit for the post he has held, and\r\nfor that reason he has lost some chances of personal advancement. I\r\nreally can only repeat in the strongest way that Sir Drummond Hay\r\nwas quite justified in dismissing from his mind any imputation made\r\nagainst him, and I have great pleasure in adding that a short time ago\r\nthe Queen granted him the Grand Cross of St. Michael and St. George.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Salisbury.—As the youngest and most recent of\r\nthe foreign secretaries the noble earl has referred to, I have\r\nvery great pleasure in joining with him in expressing the high\r\nestimation which was always entertained for Sir Drummond Hay by his\r\nsuperiors. Not only was the charge against him ridiculous, as it would\r\nhave been against any representative of the Crown, but he is a man\r\nof singular integrity and patriotism, and a more able, progressive,\r\nand intelligent adviser does not exist in the diplomatic service. I\r\nalways thought it a weak point in our diplomatic arrangements that\r\na class of men like Sir Drummond Hay, of whom there are several\r\nin the service, who have special qualities for the particular post\r\nthey occupy, cannot be rewarded as they should be rewarded without\r\ndetriment to the public service, because by the rules of the service\r\ntheir rank cannot be increased where they are, and because they\r\ncannot be removed from the post they occupy without doing harm to\r\nthe public service. I think Sir Drummond Hay has been more than\r\nrepaid by the universal confidence with which he is looked up to and\r\nthe very high esteem in which he has always been held. I think it\r\nis unnecessary to vindicate any English statesman against foreign\r\nnewspapers, because their statements are, as a rule, absolutely\r\nphenomenal. I remember one statement in a foreign newspaper which\r\ninformed us that the noble duke for whose eloquence we are waiting\r\nto-night was about to go abroad to spend the winter in the South\r\nof France with his well-known greyhounds; and I remember another\r\nsuch statement which informed us that a well-known statesman, and\r\nEnglish Lord Chancellor, was about to receive some high honour from\r\nthe Crown for his services as President of the Berlin Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Malmesbury and Lord Napier of Magdala also bore their\r\ntestimony to the high integrity and character of Sir Drummond Hay,\r\nand,\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Derby said that he did not know any person in any branch\r\nof the public service more utterly incapable of such conduct as that\r\nimputed to him than Sir Drummond Hay. He had always known him as an\r\nactive and able public servant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAVENSROCK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                   LAST YEAR OF OFFICIAL LIFE. 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1885 Monsieur Ordega was recalled by the French Government\r\nand succeeded by Monsieur Féraud. Of the new French Minister Sir\r\nJohn writes on March 30:—\r\n\r\n\r\nFéraud has arrived, and is all that he has been described—very\r\nfriendly and desirous to please, liked by every one.\r\n\r\nI gave him a dinner, and we have had many chats. He disapproves\r\nentirely of Ordega’s proceedings, especially of his conduct towards\r\nme and of his contributing venomous articles to journals regarding\r\nme and my acts.\r\n\r\nHe is a first-rate Arabic scholar and even poet, a good artist,\r\na great archæologist, and is writing a work on Tripoli. In two\r\naffairs I have tested his assurances of good-will, and have good\r\ngrounds for being satisfied.\r\n\r\nI told him positively that there was no reason why there should not\r\nalways be a perfect ‘accord’ between us, except on one point,\r\nviz. if either of our Governments desired to take possession of\r\nMorocco. ‘Kick it out,’ I said, ‘into the Atlantic a hundred\r\nmiles, and then the sooner Morocco was colonised by a civilised\r\npeople the better.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent intercourse confirmed the favourable impression. In a\r\nlater letter Sir John writes again of M. Féraud:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I told you that Féraud complained the other day of inaccurate\r\nand malevolent reports, about his doings, in local papers, and said\r\nhe hoped I did not believe them. I told him I was the last man to put\r\nany faith in newspapers; that I had been the butt of their shafts,\r\nwhich, at first, had stung; but I had grown so accustomed to abuse\r\nthat now, when not held up as the author of evil, I feel it and\r\nwonder whether I have ceased to be of any importance in the eyes\r\nof my revilers. ‘You,’ I said, ‘will soon be accustomed to\r\nthis also, and find it pleasant.’ ‘Charmes,’ the contributor\r\nof _Débats_, who has been with Féraud to Fas, was in the room,\r\nand had been introduced to me. Last year he wrote virulent articles\r\nagainst me, inspired, I think, by Ordega. He was sitting on my right,\r\na little behind me, so I took an opportunity of letting go my shaft,\r\nand added, ‘Why, even leading papers in France chose last year\r\nto publish virulent and untruthful articles about me; but, far from\r\nmy having any rancorous feeling against the writers, I am grateful\r\nto them. They drew public attention to me and my conduct in such\r\na manner that it was taken up in our Senate, and my conduct and\r\ncharacter were vindicated by the Ministers of all parties, and a\r\nmark of Her Majesty’s approval conferred upon me. I am grateful\r\nto my revilers in England and France.’\r\n\r\nWhen leaving, I gave C. my hand, and my eye, I dare say,\r\ntwinkled. C. has lately written an article in the _Débats_ on the\r\npolicy of keeping the _status quo_ in Morocco and disapproving of\r\nall the late policy. Féraud evidently inspired it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June, 1885, he writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I am an _old_ man, having entered my seventieth year. How time\r\nglides by. Next year, if I live till then, we shall be quitting this\r\nfor good. . . .\r\n\r\nFéraud is still at the Court. He has made a good name by rejecting\r\nthe trumped-up and usurious claims of protected Jews. He denounced\r\nthem to the Sultan, and complained of public notaries who, in league\r\nwith claimants, had drawn up false documents.\r\n\r\nThough he told me and other colleagues he had no affair of importance\r\nat Fas, we know better. He aims at obtaining what France wants\r\nby cajolery and presents. He eschews menace and force. He is more\r\ndangerous and far more able than his predecessor. I shall, I think,\r\nget on well with him; I cannot blame him for playing the game which\r\nsuits his country. If England had been as contiguous to Morocco as\r\nis France, I think ere this we should have annexed this misgoverned\r\ncountry; but it would never do for us that France should hold the\r\nStraits—the gut of commerce, the passage to India and the East. It\r\nis far more likely to be injurious than if she held the Canal. As\r\na sentinel of the Straits, I fire my gun, as a warning, when I know\r\nof a move to obtain that object.\r\n\r\nAn article in _Débats_ says, with some reason, that England,\r\nin consequence of her failures in the East, is no longer looked\r\nup to by the Moorish Government as before, and Italy is the rising\r\nsun. There is some truth in this. . . .\r\n\r\nOh! I shall be so glad to be at rest next year, if I live. I am\r\nsick of this Government and its stupid, blind policy. As I said to\r\nTorras[63], ‘What is the use of a fair lady saying she loves you\r\nbetter than any one in the world, and yet, while refusing to allow\r\nyou to embrace her, she showers kisses on the man whom she declares\r\nshe detests?’ Moor shut up by the _sillygism_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis letters become at this time to an increasing degree full of\r\nexpressions showing that he was weary of the hopelessness of his\r\ntask. Thus he writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery day as the time draws nearer I sing, ‘Oh be joyful!’ I am\r\nsick of the bother, and the dirty work of British subjects that I have\r\nto attend to. I am tired also of writing and talking to this fossil\r\nGovernment, who cannot, or will not, understand their true interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same note is struck in a letter written from Ravensrock on July 3,\r\nand September 7, 1885:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are well. Air here delightful, only 78° up till now, in the\r\nshade. Cholera striding fast in a deadly march on the other continent.\r\n\r\nWeber[64] just left. This time next year I shall have gone also, and\r\ngo without a pang, except to leave this lovely spot and the kindly\r\npeasantry who always welcome me with bright faces and affectionate\r\nwords. Civilised men are getting too independent to be demonstrative\r\nof good-will and gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            _Sept. 7_.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan has sent orders for the settlement of various long-pending\r\naffairs, but nothing about the Convention of Commerce. Their\r\nlast _mot_ on this is, ‘How is it possible that the Sultan’s\r\ntreasury can be benefited by a reduction of duties on exports?’\r\nand, ‘If we export all that the English Minister suggests, in the\r\nrevised Tariff, the price of food will rise and the Moslem will be\r\nstarved!’ These Moors are a parcel of children; but we can hardly\r\nbe surprised at their holding these absurd views when a restrictive\r\npolicy is pursued in commerce by the greatest nation in the world.\r\n\r\nAs to the cable between this and Gibraltar, the Sultan’s advisers\r\ntell him that, once it is laid, ‘Every day some Representative\r\nwill telegraph for a ship of war!’ One does not know whether\r\nto laugh or to cry at such tomfoolery. I think, however, jealous\r\nfolk drop poison in the ear of the Sultan, and din in His Sherifian\r\nMajesty’s ears that England has fallen from her high estate, and\r\nthat she barks but can no longer bite. The French papers in Arabic\r\nfrom Algeria sing this loudly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of slavery in Morocco called forth now and again\r\narticles or letters which appeared in British journals, and in\r\nthis and the previous year the subject was much discussed in\r\nthe newspapers. At Sir John’s suggestion, all natives,—who as\r\n_employés_ of the officials attached to the Legation or Consulates\r\nenjoyed British protection,—were required to liberate their\r\nslaves. He believed, however, the form of slavery in that country\r\nto be lenient, and though always urging on the Moorish Government\r\nthe desirability of abolishing an institution so obnoxious to modern\r\nideas, he foresaw difficulties that might, and did, prove insuperable\r\nin his day. The following extracts from his letters on this topic,\r\nwritten at different times, will show the attitude which he adopted\r\ntowards the question:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no Slave Treaty with Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe British Government has at times called upon me for reports upon\r\nslavery. It is of the mildest description. There is no slave trade\r\nby sea; five or six hundred slaves are brought yearly by land, I\r\nbelieve. The men are bought for servants in the houses of wealthy\r\nMoors, and the women as handmaids or servants. They are very kindly\r\ntreated, and when their masters die are given their liberty and a\r\nportion of the estate.\r\n\r\nWith one exception, the only cases where I have been appealed to,\r\nto intervene in behalf of slaves, have been to beg that the masters\r\nshould _not_ give their slaves liberty! They preferred, they said,\r\na comfortable home! Of course it is desirable that slavery should be\r\nabolished even in Morocco; but it would be a hopeless task to urge\r\nupon the Moorish Government the abolition of a domestic institution,\r\nadmitted by the laws of the Prophet, unless England had an opportunity\r\nof rendering Morocco some great service, such as preventing her being\r\nattacked by a stronger Power. Hitherto we have given her no _aid_\r\nbut _much advice_ in the hour of need, and then deserted her.\r\n\r\nWhen England has done as much for Morocco as she has done for Turkey\r\nand Egypt, by preventing unjust aggressions, &c., &c., then she may\r\nhope to persuade the Sultan to abolish slavery. Do you remember the\r\nlong correspondence between our dear father and the Sultan on the\r\nsubject, which finished by His Sherifian Majesty quoting Scripture\r\nin favour of slavery? I also have had a fling on the subject. But\r\nslavery in Morocco exists in the mildest form. Slaves are not used for\r\nagricultural purposes—not transported, like pigs, in vessels—and\r\nare generally the spoilt children of the house.\r\n\r\nI am not going to tell all this to the world, and thus appear to be\r\ndefending slavery.\r\n\r\nHowever, I hammer away at the Moors on the subject, and in my last\r\nnote hinted that if they do not seek to satisfy public opinion by\r\nabolishing the objectionable institution, _they_ may be _finally\r\nabolished_—or something to that effect. . . .\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Slavery Commissioners came to me to say good-bye, thanked me\r\nfor courtesy to them, and volunteered to say, ‘You are much belied,\r\nSir John, but we have taken care to sift for truth and shall make\r\nit known.’\r\n\r\nThe story about the Jewess who was flogged last year by the Governor\r\nof Dar-el-Baida, in the presence of the native employed as British\r\nInterpreter, is most exaggerated. I dismissed the Interpreter as\r\nsoon as I heard he had been present at the flogging of a woman.\r\n\r\nEsther is a pretty girl of a dissolute character. The sons of the\r\nInterpreter had been wasting their father’s patrimony on her, and\r\nwhen the old father remonstrated with his sons, caught with Esther,\r\none of them fired a pistol at him, so the Interpreter rushed off to\r\nthe Governor to demand the arrest and punishment of the woman and of\r\nhis sons. The Governor arrested and flogged all three, in accordance\r\nwith the law of this country, but there was no brutal punishment of\r\nthe girl. What nonsense to talk about the Interpreter having left\r\nwithout giving compensation! Who was to give it, and who receive\r\nit? The Governor did his duty according to their tyrannical law. The\r\nInterpreter did not punish the woman or his sons; it was the Governor;\r\nand the Interpreter got dismissed by me from his employment, a very\r\nsevere mode of showing my disapproval of his being present at the\r\nflogging of a woman. Subsequently I got the Sultan to abolish the\r\nflogging of women by Governors for immorality, and to ordain that it\r\nshall be inflicted by a Kadi only. Now a Kadi cannot order a woman\r\nto be flogged for adultery unless six honourable men of _spotless_\r\ncharacter declare they witnessed her misdeed! So no woman will\r\nhenceforward be flogged in Morocco. This I obtained in black and\r\nwhite, and Esther got a warming with a beneficial result to all\r\nfemales of her class.\r\n\r\nFéraud is to join the German Minister and me in negotiation. He\r\nis one of the best Frenchmen I ever had to deal with. I expect the\r\nSultan will kick hard against the reduction of the Tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother subject with which Sir John was much occupied during the\r\nclosing years of his residence at Tangier was a scheme of prison\r\nreform and the restriction of the period of incarceration for\r\ndebt. Writing on this point in March, 1886, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to prisons, they are no doubt very bad; and so, Mrs. Fry tells\r\nus, were ours fifty years ago. I obtained an order from the Sultan\r\nfor cleaning them, and for bread for those who have no means to buy\r\nfood; but such orders, though given, if they entail any expense, are\r\nsoon disregarded. At Tangier I send a soldier of this Legation now\r\nand then to inspect the bread. The quality and quantity diminish,\r\nand the profits go into the pocket of the person in charge, so I\r\nhave a constant battle with the authorities.\r\n\r\nUnless the whole administration of the Government were reformed,\r\nit is a hopeless task trying to sweep this Augean stable.\r\n\r\nEnglish humanitarians are shocked to find no beds provided for\r\nprisoners. They do not bear in mind that the poorer classes can\r\nalways take up their bed and walk—their bed, i.e. a rug, or piece\r\nof mat. They say how horrid it is that the prisoners should have\r\nfetters. At Tetuan the fetters were removed; one hundred and fifty\r\nprisoners rushed to the door, knocked over the guards, and fled\r\ninto the mountains. This has often occurred when prisoners are free\r\nof fetters.\r\n\r\nI have taken steps to put a stop to the arrest and imprisonment of\r\ndebtors of British subjects without trial. Great cruelties have been\r\npractised upon debtors at the demand of the Foreign Representatives,\r\noften for claims that are either fraudulent or unjust. There is an\r\noutcry against me by British creditors because I do not back the\r\nGovernment in extorting money from wretched debtors, too often the\r\nvictims of usurious Christians and Jews. I have just sent in a report\r\nto the Government on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe Jews are certainly an oppressed race, but many of those who have\r\nobtained protection conduct themselves in such an arrogant manner, and\r\nare guilty of such infamous proceedings in forging false documents\r\nabout debts of Moors, or in putting forward preposterous claims\r\nbased upon the grossest usury, that the Mohammedans are exasperated,\r\nand some day, when a revolution takes place or the Sultan dies,\r\nthere will be a massacre and pillage of Jews in the interior.\r\n\r\nWhen the chief Jews of Fas requested Féraud, during his mission,\r\nto obtain for them a grant of ground to add to the Mellah[65],\r\nthey especially requested that protected Jews should not be allowed\r\nto inhabit the new quarter, as they said they expected some day an\r\nonslaught of the Mohammedans on these persons, and they wished to\r\nbe separated from them. Féraud told me this.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revision of the Commercial Treaty of 1856 might, perhaps, have\r\nbeen forced upon the Moorish Government by the united Representatives\r\nof the Foreign Powers. But, though on this point the various Ministers\r\njoined hands, the hope entertained by Sir John that a Convention might\r\nbe framed which would abolish the system of irregular protection was\r\nnot realised. Under the terms of the Convention of 1882, protection\r\nis still afforded to the numerous agents of European traders and\r\nagriculturists, who therefore are not immediately amenable to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Moorish authorities. On this point Sir\r\nJohn had been defeated by the action of his colleagues. But the\r\nwisdom of his proposals was abundantly justified by the course\r\nwhich was taken by the negotiations for a new Commercial Treaty\r\nin 1886. On the advantages of revising the Commercial Code of\r\n1856 all the Representatives of Foreign Powers were agreed, and\r\nmade common cause together. But their efforts resulted in failure,\r\nand this failure was principally due to their previous refusal to\r\nsurrender or restrict their privileges of protection. The Moorish\r\nGovernment showed a natural reluctance to encourage European trade\r\nby an improved treaty, fearing that a greater influx of European\r\nmerchants and agriculturists would only multiply the number of\r\nirregularly protected Moorish subjects as agents, and remove more\r\nnatives from the direct control of the Moorish authorities.\r\n\r\nThough Sir John might reasonably derive some satisfaction from this\r\npractical proof of the wisdom of his advice to his colleagues, his\r\nfailure to obtain a revision of the Commercial Treaty deepened his\r\nsense of the impossibility of reforming the Moorish Government. He\r\nwas weary of the hopeless struggle which he had carried on for more\r\nthan forty years. In spite of his personal regret at severing his\r\nconnection with Morocco, he longed to throw off the official harness\r\nunder which he had so often chafed. His letters in the summer of\r\n1886 are filled with expressions of his delight at his freedom:—\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 2, 1886. Eve of departure. The Jews have sent a deputation\r\nand address. Moors pour in with lamentations. Torras weeps in a\r\nletter. Even British subjects join in the wail, whilst I continue\r\nto sing, ‘O be joyful.’\r\n\r\nAlas! dinners and lunches are the _dis_order of the day; and speeches,\r\nwhich being pathetic about our departure, choke me and prevent a\r\nfitting response.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1886. Here I am, with my harness off, kicking my heels like\r\nan old horse turned out to grass. So glad to send dispatches and\r\nletters to my address to the _Chargé d’Affaires_.\r\n\r\nI had a very flattering letter from Lord Rosebery’s private\r\nsecretary, Villiers, to say that his Lordship, in ‘recognition\r\nof my long and distinguished services,’ will meet my wishes, &c.,\r\n&c. . . .\r\n\r\nWe have been _fêted_ successively by the diplomats here, and\r\nspeeches were made laudatory of me. In a circular, each vied in\r\nsaying flattering things, such as that I had been looked up to\r\nfor my experience and clear-headedness as the guide, &c. of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps.\r\n\r\nWe are on the look out for the s.s. Mogador. I think I told you the\r\nForwood Company have placed her at my disposal. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nDisgusted at the last proof of Moorish apathy and obstinacy, Sir\r\nJohn declined to pay a formal visit of farewell to the Moorish Court,\r\nand the Sultan’s Prime Minister addressed him a valedictory letter\r\non behalf of himself and his colleagues in office, a translation of\r\nwhich is subjoined as a curious specimen of Oriental phraseology:—\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise be to God!\r\n\r\nThe beloved and judicious Counsellor, who strives to promote good\r\nrelations between the two friendly Sovereigns, the Minister of the\r\nexalted Queen of Great Britain and Empress of India, in the dominions\r\nof Morocco.\r\n\r\nWe continue to make inquiries regarding you and regarding your\r\ncondition, and we trust that you may always be prosperous.\r\n\r\nWhich premised, we have received your letter in which you inform\r\nus that, your term of office having expired, you are about to quit\r\nthis country, and you express your regret that you are unable to\r\nhave an audience of His Majesty, exalted by God, in order to take\r\nleave of His Sherifian Majesty, and express your gratitude for the\r\nmarks of good-will, confidence, and friendship that His Majesty\r\nhas shown towards you, and you observe that you have served for\r\nforty years in these happy dominions, and that our Lord and Master,\r\nthe grandsire of our present Lord and Master (assisted by God),\r\nand our Master the sire of His Majesty (may God sanctify them\r\nboth), bestowed on you their confidence, friendship, and trust,\r\nand that our Lord and Master (may God assist him) has likewise\r\nheld you in the same regard, and that the friendship between the\r\ntwo Governments has remained in the same state as formerly, it has\r\nneither altered nor been disturbed; and that you will never grow weak\r\nin your devotion to the welfare of His Majesty and of his subjects,\r\nfor you are convinced of the friendship of His Majesty and of his\r\nsubjects towards you: you request us also to bid farewell in your\r\nname to the Uzirs and chief officers of the Sherifian Court, whom\r\nyou name, and you further state that, should God prolong your life,\r\nyou will return to this country after the lapse of a year, and will\r\nreside here for a time during the winter months, and that, should\r\nit meet with Her Majesty’s approval and your Government grant its\r\nconsent, you would then visit the Court in a private capacity with\r\nthe view of taking leave in person of His Majesty, exalted by God.\r\n\r\nI have laid your letter before our Lord the Sultan, and His\r\nMajesty has taken into consideration all you state in it, and\r\n(may God render him powerful) has commanded me to reply to it and\r\nto state that your departure from these blessed dominions causes\r\ngreat grief and sorrow, as it was sure to do, for you are one of\r\nthe wise and judicious persons of your illustrious Government, who\r\nhave from ancient times mediated between them and the Sherifian\r\nGovernment with friendship, sincerity, and consideration, as is\r\nknown to all, and about which there can be no dispute, and which\r\nat all times has been continuously renewed, proved, and confirmed\r\nby the strength and power of God. And the fact that your exalted\r\nQueen selected a sagacious person like yourself, of excellent social\r\nqualities, pleasant to have relations with, and seeking to do good,\r\nfor service in this country for so long a time, is a proof of her\r\nsincere friendship and of her desire to promote good feeling and to\r\nstrengthen the bonds of union between the two friendly Sovereigns,\r\nand is a sign whereby is known Her Majesty’s extreme judiciousness,\r\nwisdom, and judgment; for a person gives proof of his judgment\r\nand condition by one of these things, viz. his envoy, his letter,\r\nor his present. His Sherifian Majesty (may God render him powerful)\r\nhas commanded me to convey the expression of his sincere thanks and\r\nbest acknowledgments to your beloved Queen, and to yourself also, O\r\nfriend, and invoked on Her Majesty an increase of power, greatness,\r\ndignity, and grandeur; and on you, blessings on yourself, on your\r\nfamily, children, relatives, and posterity.\r\n\r\nI am to add that what you state regarding the confidence that was\r\nreposed in you by our Lord and Master, His Sherifian Majesty’s\r\nsire (may God sanctify him), is true and well known to every one,\r\nand His Sherifian Majesty (may God render him powerful) likewise\r\nreposes confidence in you and regards you as a sincere friend, and\r\nthat your remark that the friendship between the two Governments\r\nhas undergone no change during the term of your office is also true,\r\nfor the friendship between the two Governments is the result of your\r\nservices, verifying the opinion held of you by your illustrious\r\nGovernment, the soundness of their judgment and the accuracy of\r\ntheir discernment regarding yourself, and it (the friendship) has\r\nthrough your assistance increased in purity, constancy and growth,\r\nin love and affection, in word and deed. And as to what you say that\r\nyou will not grow weak in your devotion to His Sherifian Majesty\r\nand to his subjects, this is in accordance with the opinion formed\r\nof you, and is what is confidently expected of you, for such is the\r\ndisposition of persons of a friendly and affectionate character,\r\nwhether they be near or far.\r\n\r\nI have taken leave in your name of the Uzirs and officers of the\r\nSherifian Court whom you mentioned, and they all reciprocated your\r\naffection and gave expression to it, and praised you, and invoked\r\nblessings on you, and were not sparing in their expressions of\r\nsorrow and grief at your departure, and recited the lines of the\r\nancient poet:—\r\n\r\n‘Though severed in body we suffer no hurt; for our hearts are\r\nunited, welded by pure love.’\r\n\r\nWith regard to your statement that if God prolongs your life, and it\r\nis agreeable to His Sherifian Majesty, you will visit the Sherifian\r\nCourt (exalted by God), and that, should your Government approve,\r\nyou would come with the object you mention, our Lord (may God make\r\nhim glorious) has commanded me to reply that he prays your life may be\r\nprolonged by the power of God, and that you may continue in happiness\r\nand health, leading an agreeable life; and if your Government sanction\r\nyour coming with this object, you are welcome, and such sanction will\r\nbe agreeable to His Sherifian Majesty (may God assist him), for it\r\n(your Government) desires for you and for His Sherifian Majesty only\r\nwhat is good, and you seek only to promote the welfare of them both,\r\nand how indeed could your Government refuse to grant its sanction\r\nfor what is beneficial? Our friendship for you is everlasting, and\r\nits freshness will never fade day or night. May God be gracious on\r\nthe leave-taking, and not forbid the meeting.\r\n\r\nFinished the last day of Ramadan, 1303 (July 3, 1886).\r\n\r\n                                MOHAMMED MEFADAL BEN MOHAMMED GHARRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his retirement, Her Majesty was pleased to make Sir John a Privy\r\nCouncillor, and, though no longer holding a responsible post, he was\r\nconstantly appealed to on Morocco affairs by the British Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Foreign Office,’ he writes, in December, 1886, to his\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Brooks, ‘continue to send me dispatches about\r\nMorocco to be reported on, and, when I make suggestions as to\r\nactions, they are adopted. This is pleasing to me, and Government,\r\nthough they rather bother me with their consultations, flatter me\r\nby their continued confidence in my counsels.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Austria sent Sir John his portrait set in brilliants\r\non the lid of a golden casket or snuff-box, and by special permission\r\nof Her Majesty he was allowed to accept the order of the Grand Cross\r\nof the Danebrog from the King of Denmark—for whom as for Austria\r\nhe had so long acted as Agent in Morocco. The Danish order was the\r\nonly one he was permitted to accept of the many foreign decorations\r\nbestowed on him during his long career.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the end of Sir John’s life, it may be added, his name and\r\npersonal influence retained their ascendency over the natives,\r\nas will be seen from such passages as the three following extracts\r\nfrom some of his letters, written from Ravensrock in 1891 and 1892:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Basha, Hadj Mohammed Ben Abd-el-Sadek, called to make known to\r\nme an order he had received from the Sultan to tell me that His\r\nSherifian Majesty looked upon me as a true friend of himself and\r\nof the people of this country, and the Basha said he was directed,\r\nshould any serious question arise, to ask for my advice, as His\r\nSherifian Majesty felt persuaded that I would always be actuated\r\nby feelings of justice and friendship in giving counsels, as in the\r\ntime of his sire and grandsire.\r\n\r\nI informed the Basha that I had withdrawn from intervention in\r\nofficial affairs, and that some of the Foreign Representatives\r\nmight be disposed to resent such interference, even if my counsels\r\nhappened to be beneficial to them in bringing about settlements of\r\nvexatious questions.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards are making lime at the caves of Ashkar, and live\r\nthere. The caves are Government property, and the stone has been used\r\nfor making mill-stones for two thousand years. The poor villagers of\r\nMedióna and Jebíla complained to me, saying that they are afraid\r\nsome day that mountaineers who visit Ashkar to buy mill-stones may\r\nkill or rob these Spaniards, and then an indemnity will be demanded\r\nby the Spanish Government, and they (the villagers) will be thrown\r\ninto prison. (I told the villagers to complain to the Basha.) . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nOr again, in January, 1892:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‘Thunderer’ remains here, as the mountaineers belonging to\r\nthe Tangier province have revolted against the Basha, and troubles\r\nare expected. I think the Sultan will remove the Basha, who is unfit\r\nto govern. Happen what may, I and mine are quite safe, for the Moors\r\non mountains and plains look upon me as their friend; and so indeed\r\nhave I been. I remained during the Spanish war, when every Christian\r\nand Jew bolted, and no barbarian harmed me or mine. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, once more, the following written in February, 1892:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive, all will be settled with the tribes. The Fahs\r\nare coming in with presents of oxen, &c. Jebála follow. The new\r\nBasha, a good fellow, has written me a letter, received yesterday,\r\nto say he is coming up here to pay me a visit as soon as all the\r\ntribes have come in (and looks upon me as Baba[66]). The fact is,\r\nI was appealed to by the tribes, &c. whether they should accept him,\r\nas he is a relative of the late Basha. I said certainly—and told\r\nthem to come. Ships of war are leaving. All’s well that ends well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n                            OUT OF HARNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Sir John had severed his official connection with Morocco,\r\nhe retained his villa at Ravensrock. Thither, after an interval,\r\nhe returned to spend the winters. During the first year of absence\r\nafter his retirement, on learning of the serious illness of the\r\ncompanion of so many of his sporting days, Hadj Hamed, the chief of\r\nthe boar-hunters, he writes to his daughter, enclosing a letter to\r\nbe delivered by his little grandson to the dying man:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Wiesbaden, _March 31_, 1887.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 23rd has just reached A. I cannot tell you how\r\ngrieved I feel from the account you give of dear old Hadj Hamed, and I\r\nfear much I may never see his kind face again. As I thought it would\r\nplease and cheer him if I wrote a few lines to him as an old friend,\r\nI have written in my bad Arabic the enclosed note, which dear Jock\r\nwill perhaps deliver in person to him. It is merely to say I am so\r\nsorry to hear from you he is ill, that I pray God he will keep his\r\nhealth, and that we shall meet in October next and hunt together,\r\nand that I look upon him as a brother and a dear friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1887 he returned to winter at Tangier, and though a septuagenarian,\r\nwas as keen a sportsman as ever. Writing in October he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already bought a nag for myself, and, like myself, short\r\nand dumpy, but with legs that will not fail or stumble with twelve\r\nstone seven on his back, for if I fall I do not stot up as of old,\r\nbut make a hole in the ground and stick there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of that year found him riding hard after pig on his little\r\ncob, and untiring in pursuit of game. He writes to his son-in-law\r\nan account of one of these hunts in which he had a narrow escape\r\nfrom injury:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hunt has been a successful one, and barring three wounded horses,\r\none dog killed, a couple of spills, and ——— rather shaken,\r\nall’s well. Six or seven lances smashed—not by me, except one\r\ndumpy lance, of which anon.\r\n\r\nA. went off early on Monday the 12th to put the camp in order. I\r\nfollowed her with mother. We lunched in the Ghaba Sebaita. At 3\r\np.m. I left her, so as to be early in camp to see that all was\r\nright. On reaching the head of the lake, I met a hunter who told\r\nme he had seen a very large boar come out of the cork-wood and lie\r\ndown on the border of the lake. I sent a messenger for the hunters,\r\nwho were returning, and awaited them on my ‘kida,’ _sine_\r\nlance. When they arrived they also were lanceless; but the Sheríf\r\nhaving come up with his lance, and Mahmud with him with another,\r\nI induced the Sheríf to make Mahmud dismount and give his lance to\r\nJ. G. I took from a beater a short lance (five feet), and thus armed\r\nwe entered the lake. W., with a lance, was seen in the distance and\r\nbeckoned for; Colonel C., with his party, also arrived armed with\r\na lance. J. G. started the boar, and away we went in six inches of\r\nwater. As soon as J. G. approached, the boar turned and charged,\r\nsmashing his lance. Spying his horse coming up in the distance,\r\nas it was being led to the camp, he galloped off and got the fresh\r\nhorse and his own lance.\r\n\r\nColonel C. followed the boar with me, and as soon as he neared\r\nthe beast, it turned and charged; but received a severe wound,\r\nthe lance remaining in the boar. Then, as no sound lance remained,\r\nI presented myself. No sooner did the boar hear me in his wake than\r\nround he came, at a hundred miles an hour, upon my short lance,\r\nthe point of which, being badly tempered and very blunt, bent to an\r\nangle of ninety degrees. My gallant little horse leapt over the pig,\r\nas he passed under his barrel. Up came J. G. with his fresh lance\r\nand gave it hard, but still the boar went on, in deeper and deeper\r\nwater, making for Arára[67]. Some greyhounds of the Sheríf’s were\r\nslipped, and the gallant boar fought them all. The hunters came up,\r\nand the boar still moved towards Arára. I asked a Moor with a hatchet\r\nto knock the brave beast on the head, but he declined the task; and,\r\nas there was no second lance, the boar moved on towards Arára very\r\nslowly, fighting the dogs. Finding that neither prayers nor abuse\r\nwere attended to by the hunters, I jumped off my nag into the water,\r\nknee deep, and taking the hatchet advanced on the pig. He charged\r\nwhen I got within five yards of him, and I broke the hatchet on\r\nhis skull and retreated; the greyhounds laid hold behind, and the\r\nbrave beast was done for. I got rated by J. G., who saw it, and\r\nby A. afterwards; but mother is to be kept in the dark about this\r\n‘tomfoolery,’ as A. says. The fact is, there was no danger,\r\nfor the greyhounds came to the rescue when the boar charged.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, after a successful day’s pigsticking thirteen\r\nmiles from Tangier, he and his younger daughter, riding home in the\r\nevening, saw two Bonelli eagles and six great bustards. The latter\r\nallowed them to approach within forty yards. ‘This,’ he writes,\r\n‘was too much for my old sporting blood, so I invited J. G. to join\r\nme, and next day we went out to the site and viewed three ‘hobar’\r\n(great bustards), and were after them twice, but could not get near\r\nfor a shot. I shot a Bonelli eagle from my pony, who, even after a\r\nthirty miles’ ride yesterday, was very larky, but stood fire like\r\nan old war-horse.’\r\n\r\nNot only did Sir John retain to the end of his life all his love\r\nof sport, but, like most sportsmen, he dwelt with pleasure on his\r\nrecollections of past encounters. Many of his reminiscences he put\r\ntogether, now that he was comparatively an idle man, in the form\r\nof articles which were printed in _Murray’s Magazine_ for 1887,\r\nunder the title of ‘Scraps from my Note-Book.’ Some of these,\r\nsupplemented with additions subsequently made by himself or with\r\ndetails since gathered from his letters, are reproduced here,\r\nthough they for the most part belong to a much earlier date. Thus,\r\non the subject of boar-hunting, he wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moorish hunters are generally small farmers or peasants from\r\nthe villages around Tangier, who join the hunt solely from love of\r\nsport. Some of them act as beaters, wearing leathern aprons and\r\ngreaves—such as the ancient Greek peasantry wore—to protect\r\ntheir legs. Of these, some carry bill-hooks to cut their way through\r\nthe thicket, others long guns. They are accompanied by native dogs\r\n(suggestive of a cross between a collie and a jackal), with noses\r\nthat can wind a boar from afar, and do good service.\r\n\r\nAs the thickets where the animals lie are for the most part bordered\r\nby the sea on one side, and by lake or plain on the other, the boar,\r\nwhen driven, generally make straight for the guns; and we were\r\nwont to have capital sport, shooting on an average about fifteen\r\nboar in two days’ hunting. There are also jackals and porcupine;\r\nand, during a beat near Brij, a panther once took me by surprise,\r\njumping across the path where I was posted before I could fire. This\r\nanimal was shot afterwards on a neighbouring hill.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion on the promontory of Brij, which is surrounded by\r\nthe sea and the river ‘Taherdats’ except for a narrow slip\r\nof sand on the northern side, sometimes flooded at high tides,\r\nwe found thirty-six boar in one beat, and killed fourteen. It was\r\nan exciting sight to see the boar breaking from the bush across the\r\nneck of sand about 150 yards broad. The herd did not break together,\r\nbut came separately and continuously. A large tusker who led the van\r\nwas wounded as he sallied from the bush pursued by dogs, and forthwith\r\ncharged the man who had fired; and then beaters, who ran up to the\r\nrescue, were followed again by other boar, who, wounded in their turn,\r\npursued the beaters that were hurrying after the first boar; then\r\ncame dogs, pigs, beaters, more dogs and pigs. Volleys were fired, up,\r\ndown, and across the line, regardless of the rules of the hunt. Great\r\nwas the excitement; several beaters were knocked down by the boar,\r\nbut no one was ripped, though dogs and boar lay wounded on the sands\r\nall around. I shot five boar: one great tusker, being wounded, sat on\r\nhis haunches in the defiant posture of the Florentine boar, so I ran\r\nup, assassin-like, from behind and plunged my knife into his heart.\r\n\r\nIn one of the beats, a hunter named ‘Shebá,’ a veteran past\r\nseventy, had just shot a boar, when the dogs came in full cry\r\nafter another, and he had only time to pour in the powder carried\r\nloose in his leathern pouch, and to put the long iron ramrod down\r\nthe barrel, when another tusker came to the front. Shebá fired\r\nand sent the ramrod like a skewer through the body of the boar,\r\nwho charged and knocked him over. Shebá fell flat on his face,\r\nneither moving arm nor leg, whilst the boar stood over him, cutting\r\ninto ribbons his hooded woollen ‘jelab.’ He shouted for help,\r\nexclaiming ‘Fire! fire!’ I ran up within a few feet. ‘I fear\r\nto hit you,’ I said. ‘Fire!’ he cried; ‘I would rather be\r\nshot than be killed by a “halluf” (pig).’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a Photograph by Baron Whetnall.\r\n\r\n_The last Hunt in 1886; Sir John on “E’dhem.”_\r\n\r\nWalker & Boutall Ph. Sc.]\r\n\r\nI stooped low, and raising the muzzle of my gun, shot the boar\r\nthrough the heart. The huge carcass fell upon Shebá, who, when\r\nreleased from the weight, got up and shook me by the hand heartily,\r\nsaying, ‘Praise be to God the Merciful! Thanks to you I have escaped\r\ndeath.’ I withdrew the ramrod, which had passed right through the\r\nbody of the animal.\r\n\r\nI had not at that time introduced the lance or spear, but when a boar\r\nhappened to take to the open I had frequently pursued on horseback\r\nand killed with an ancient rapier I possessed.\r\n\r\nMounted on a little Barb, about fourteen hands three, I once pursued,\r\ngun in hand, a large sow across the plain of Awára. We came suddenly\r\non a ditch formed by an estuary from the sea, about sixteen feet\r\nbroad. No bank was visible until I saw the boar suddenly disappear,\r\nand before I could pull up, my nag tried to clear the ditch, but\r\nfailed, as the ground was soft on the brink, so in we plumped headlong\r\ninto thick mud and water, gun and all; but a pistol, loose in my\r\nholster, by good fortune was cast high and dry on the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nThe horse, sow, and I wallowed for some seconds in the mud together,\r\neach of us scrambling out about the same moment, for I had chosen\r\nan easier ascent of the bank to clamber up than the sow had done. I\r\nleft my gun swamped in the mud, and, seizing hold of the pistol,\r\nremounted. Away we went again. It was about a quarter of a mile to the\r\nbush, where the sow would be safe. I came up alongside and fired, but\r\nonly wounded her; she turned and made a jump to seize hold of my leg,\r\nbut missed, passing her fore leg up to the joint in my right stirrup,\r\nand there her leg and my foot were jammed. The hind legs of the sow\r\njust touched the ground. She tried to bite my knee; I struggled to\r\nrelease my foot and the sow her leg. I had no other weapon than the\r\nexploded pistol, and my fear was that the stirrup-leather would give\r\nway, and then, if I fell, the sow would have it all her own way. The\r\npain from my jammed instep was intense, but after a few seconds the\r\nsow freed her leg and then turned on my horse, who cleverly leapt\r\naside as she charged.\r\n\r\nThe sow then entered the thicket, badly wounded, and when the dogs\r\ncame up we found and killed her. The hunters, who had viewed the\r\nchase from the side of the hill, and had been hallooing joyously\r\non witnessing the pig, horse, and me tumble into the ditch, were\r\ngreatly amused in aiding me to remove the thick coating of grey mud\r\nwhich shrouded my person, my gun, and the body of my horse.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when a very large boar, slightly wounded, was\r\nmaking up the side of a rocky hill, bare of bush, a strange Moor,\r\nwith a long gun, who had joined the hunt, ran along the open to a\r\nnarrow path where the boar would have to pass, and squatted down\r\nto pot him. I was about forty yards off, and shouted as the boar\r\nmade towards him, ‘Look out! Stand aside of the path!’—but\r\nthe stranger remained steady, fired, and then jumped up and ran.\r\n\r\nThe infuriated beast pursued and knocked him headlong over, ripping\r\nhis legs and body as he struggled to get up. I ran up with another\r\nhunter, but boar and man were so mixed up I could not fire. The\r\nboar, burying its snout under the man’s clothes, ripped his\r\nbody severely, then seizing his woollen dress in its mouth like a\r\nbull-dog, knelt on his prostrate body. I dared not fire; so laying\r\nhold of the hilt of a sword my companion carried, and finding the\r\npoint too blunt to pierce the ironclad hide, I told the owner to take\r\nhold of the point, and putting the blade under the boar’s throat,\r\nwe sawed away until the beast fell dead, still holding the man’s\r\ndress in his jaws. The wounded Moor, who was built like a Samson,\r\nfainted away from loss of blood. We stanched his wounds, making a\r\ntourniquet with handkerchief and stick, laid him on the pad of a mule,\r\nand sent him into town to a room in my stable, where he was attended\r\nto by a surgeon for three weeks and recovered. On taking leave of me,\r\nhe observed it was his first and would be his last boar-hunt. This\r\nman, as I learnt afterwards, was a famous cattle-lifter. He told the\r\nhunters, that out of gratitude for my care of him, he would never\r\nrob my cows or the cattle of my friends.\r\n\r\nWe were wont to hunt for a couple of days every fortnight at Sharf\r\nel Akab and Awára, but finding that the mountaineers from the hills\r\nof Beni M’Suar and Jebel Habíb, who dwell about twelve miles\r\nfrom this hunting-ground, had been in the habit of coming down in\r\nlarge parties once a week to hunt and were destroying the game,\r\nwe determined, from a spirit of rivalry, to hunt more frequently.\r\n\r\nThere had been conflicts between my hunters and the mountaineers,\r\nand during a beat for boar, when a number of these wild fellows had\r\njoined our hunt, I heard bullets whizzing and cutting the branches\r\nnear to where I stood. One of these mountaineers was caught by my\r\nparty, and a vigorous bastinado was inflicted on the culprit, who\r\nhad been seen to take a deliberate shot at me.\r\n\r\nIn less than six months the boar at Sharf el Akab and Awára were\r\ndestroyed, except a huge ‘solitaire,’ who had made his lair on\r\nthe rocky hill of Bu Amar, then overgrown with impenetrable bush. He\r\nwas a very wary animal, who refused to bolt when bayed at by dogs,\r\nfrequently killing or wounding those that ventured to approach\r\nhis lair.\r\n\r\nAt that time a Spaniard had brought, much to the annoyance of the\r\npeasants, a herd of tame pigs to feed in the cork-wood, for, as the\r\npeasants reported, the ‘accursed animals’ not only fed on acorns\r\nand white truffles, which abound there, but ravaged also their grain\r\ncrops, whither the Spaniard had been seen to drive the herd at night\r\nto feed.\r\n\r\nComplaints were made by the farmers to the Moorish authorities\r\nregarding the havoc committed by the pigs, and I backed their\r\npetition to the Basha. So the herdsman was ordered by the Spanish\r\nLegation to remove the herd, which was accordingly done; but two\r\nof the Spaniard’s sows were missing, and he offered a handsome\r\nreward to any Moor who would bring them, dead or alive, declaring\r\nthat they had been led astray by a large wild boar, who had been\r\nseen by him to come boldly amongst the herd some weeks before, had\r\nattacked and ripped severely a tame boar, paying no attention to\r\nthe herdsman’s shouting, and had led off, as he declared, ‘Dos\r\ncerdas muy hermosas’ (two very beautiful sows), not unwilling,\r\nas he insinuated, to accompany their captor.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard declared he had occasionally seen at dusk his two sows\r\nwith the boar, feeding in the plains; but as soon as the latter\r\nwinded man, he made off at a gallop with his captives.\r\n\r\nA hunter reported this to me, mentioning that he had been offered\r\nfive dollars for each sow, dead or alive, and that he believed both\r\nsows had large litters of wee striped pigs, evidently the progeny\r\nof their captor.\r\n\r\nI communicated with the Spaniard, and these two sows and their litters\r\nwere sold to me for about £6. I made known to the Basha of Tangier\r\nhow the sport at Sharf el Akab had been spoilt by the too frequent\r\nhunting, both of my party and of the mountaineers; and related how I\r\nhad purchased the Spaniard’s two sows and their litters. I requested\r\nthat orders should be sent to the mountaineers who were under the\r\nBasha’s jurisdiction to keep to their own hunting-grounds, and not\r\nhunt at Sharf el Akab; and that the peasantry also of the villages\r\nround Tangier should be warned not to shoot boar in that district\r\nunless they joined our hunt, which had always been open to sportsmen,\r\n‘Moslem or Nazarene,’ of low or high degree.\r\n\r\nTo all this the Basha agreed, whilst I offered to give compensation\r\nto farmers whose crops might be injured by the ravages of my porcine\r\nacquisition. I also made known to the Foreign Representatives the\r\nsteps I had taken, and requested them to give directions to the\r\nsubjects of their respective Governments not to shoot or hunt the\r\nhybrids or any other boar in that district, as it was my intention\r\nnot to shoot boar in the preserved district, but to hunt with the\r\nspear, after a couple of years, when I expected not only the hybrids\r\nwould have increased in numbers, but that they would be joined by\r\nwild boar from the neighbouring hills.\r\n\r\nMy wishes were granted, and a document was signed to that effect\r\nby the Basha and Foreign Representatives, and in 1868 I introduced\r\nhunting on horseback with the lance—known in India as pigsticking.\r\n\r\nThe hybrids at first were not disposed to break from covert and give\r\na fair gallop in the open; but when the two ‘hermosas cerdas’ were\r\nslain, their progeny behaved better, and now give capital runs across\r\ncountry, and are more disposed to charge than the thoroughbred boar.\r\n\r\nThe mode of hunting with the lance is to drive a thicket where pig\r\nare reported to lie, with beaters, dogs, and stoppers, towards the\r\nmarsh, plain, or cork-wood, where the pig knows that he can make for\r\ncovert in an opposite thicket. The chief beater sounds a horn when\r\na boar is on foot, firing gun or pistol should he come to bay. The\r\nhorsemen are placed down-wind, concealed as much as possible, with\r\ndirections to keep silent, and not to start until the boar is well\r\naway in the open, so as to ride in the rear and check his turning\r\nback to the thicket. It is a difficult task to prevent those who are\r\nnovices or not sportsmen at heart from breaking through these rules,\r\nespecially ardent youths who may view the boar break, and hope to\r\ntake the lead by an early start.\r\n\r\nThe boar, when aware that he is pursued, puts on pace. It requires\r\na fast horse to come up for the first quarter of a mile; but when\r\nhard pressed, the boar gets blown, shortens stride, and begins to\r\ndodge amongst the low bush.\r\n\r\nOne of the best gallops I ever had was in pursuit of a huge boar, who\r\ntook across the lake from a thicket of Arára. My son, a first-rate\r\nrider, was with me; we did not carry spears, but had revolvers. After\r\na hard gallop we came up with the boar a few yards before entering the\r\ncork-wood. We fired several shots, but the animal sped on at racing\r\npace, charging us alternately. The wounds which the boar received\r\n(for blood poured down his flank) were not of a character to stop his\r\ncareer, so away we dashed through the wood, dodging the cork-trees,\r\nfiring occasionally a shot, until the boar ringed back to the thick\r\njungle of Arára from which he had been driven, and there it was out\r\nof the question to follow on horseback. Disheartened and greatly\r\ndisappointed, for the boar was one of the largest we had seen for\r\nmany years, we joined the hunters, and dismounted to give our nags\r\na rest, whilst our party lunched.\r\n\r\nWe had halted for an hour, and were again preparing to mount,\r\nwhen a shepherd, all tattered and torn, ran up to me breathless,\r\nsaying a ‘halluf,’ black as a ‘Jin’ and as big as a bull,\r\nhad passed through the flock of sheep he was tending, knocking\r\nseveral over; had charged his dog, and made for the sea, where, he\r\nsaid, after rolling several times, the boar stood erect amidst the\r\nwaves, throwing water over his body. ‘This lad is a “kedab”\r\n(a liar),’ exclaimed one of the hunters. ‘Who ever heard of a\r\nboar bathing in the sea at midday?’\r\n\r\n‘Make haste,’ exclaimed the lad; ‘it is about half an hour’s\r\nwalk, and if the boar is not still there, the tracks on the shore\r\nwill show whether I lie or not.’\r\n\r\nSo off the hunters started, guided by the shepherd. As we topped the\r\nsand-hills which line the coast, a black form, such as the shepherd\r\nhad described, big as a bull, was viewed amongst the waves. My son\r\nand I recognised the enormous beast that had given us the gallop,\r\nwho had evidently taken to the sea to cool his wounds. As our\r\nparty approached in line, to check any attempt of the boar to take\r\nback to Arára, he came out of the breakers with bristles up, and\r\n‘Volta feroce al inimico!’ (a word of command formerly used in\r\nthe Portuguese army), prepared to receive us.\r\n\r\nSome of the hunters were about to fire, which I prevented, saying I\r\nwould approach on horseback, as we might have the chance of another\r\ngallop. When I got within twenty yards, the beast charged. I fired my\r\nrevolver, missed, gave spurs to my nag, and was pursued by the boar\r\nuntil the dogs, which had been held back, were let loose; he then\r\ntook out to sea, breasting the rollers gallantly, making due West\r\nfor the first port in the United States, with the hounds in his wake.\r\n\r\nWhen the intention of the pig to emigrate became evident and he was\r\nalready some hundred yards out to sea, I cried ‘Fire!’ as his\r\nblack form topped a wave. Volley after volley followed, and the huge\r\ncarcass was washed back on shore. The boar was a hybrid, perfectly\r\nblack, with good tusks, and measuring about six feet two from snout\r\nto root of tail, and three feet two from shoulder to hoof. I have\r\npreserved the hide.\r\n\r\nThe largest boar I have ever seen measured six feet four from\r\nsnout to tail, three feet four at the shoulder, and weighed twenty\r\nstone—clean. An old beater of eighty, whose dog had been wounded to\r\nthe death, when he came up to the monster lying lifeless, got upon\r\nthe body, took off from his shaven pate the red gun-cover which he\r\nused as a turban, and throwing it on the ground, cried out, ‘Now\r\nI can die in peace. The death of this “haisha,” (whale), who\r\nhas baulked us for years, is what I have longed for. At last! It\r\nwas written he should die before me,’ and the veteran performed\r\na wild wriggling dance on the carcass of the animal.\r\n\r\nThis old hunter, named Ben Isa, was still alive, aged a hundred,\r\nwhen I left Tangier in July, 1886.\r\n\r\nDuring one of our beats, a large boar was started from the low\r\nbush near the beach below Awára, and two mounted Moors joined\r\nme in pursuit. The country was open, and the ground good for\r\ngalloping. The pig went away at racing pace, bounding like a deer\r\nover the low bushes. On getting near, I was astonished to see his\r\nears were cropped like those of a terrier. After a gallop of a\r\nmile we speared him. Hadj Abdallah, who was one of my companions,\r\nexclaimed, ‘Do you remember four years ago two “berakkel”\r\n(squeakers) being caught by the dogs, and you and I carried them\r\nin our arms and let them go near a thicket, where they would be\r\nsafe; but the little fellow you carried turned on you, when freed,\r\nand tried to bite your legs, and you bid me catch him and turn him\r\nloose again in the thicket? This I did, but he had shown such pluck\r\nI thought I would mark him, so I cropped his ears and then let him\r\ngo, saying “We may meet again.” And here he is, and has given us\r\nproof this day that he was as gallant a boar as he was a squeaker.’\r\n\r\nSome years ago we had a good day, killing nine boar.\r\n\r\nThe camp was pitched at Awára, near the farm huts of the chief hunter\r\nHadj Hamed. A large party, both of English and foreigners, went out\r\nto join in the sport. On the first two days several boar were killed,\r\nthough my favourite horse, ‘Snabi,’ was badly wounded. I chased\r\na tusker which took right across the burnt wood towards Awínats and\r\nbroke into the open on the side of the hill. There I overtook the\r\nbeast and transfixed him. He charged before I could extract the lance,\r\ncarrying it under my horse, and inflicted a deep gash between the off\r\nfore-leg and chest. I had to dismount and send the poor suffering\r\nbeast into town. He was very lame for a twelvemonth. I had thought\r\nof shooting ‘Snabi,’ but he was such a favourite with my family,\r\nthat a reprieve was granted. He was the best nag for pigsticking I\r\never rode. He was not fast, but thoroughly understood the sport, and\r\nwould take his rider, without guiding, alongside of the pig at the\r\nright moment for attack. He never swerved from a boar; no huntsman\r\nknew better where the pig would be likely to break, as soon as the\r\nshouts of the beaters and the horn were heard, and ‘Snabi’ would\r\nbe sure to view the animal before his rider, whenever it broke covert.\r\n\r\nWhen desirous of showing sport to any friend who had never seen\r\npigsticking I mounted him on ‘Snabi,’ and my advice was to\r\nlet the horse take his own direction after the pig, and have his\r\nown way when closing with the enemy. If his rider fell, or a hole\r\nbrought ‘Snabi’ on his head, the nag would get up and stand by,\r\nputting his head down, and looking with anxious eyes, as if to say,\r\n‘Get up quickly, the pig is making off.’—‘Snabi’ had\r\nbelonged to Kaid Meno, the Colonel of the Berber regiment of Askar,\r\nand had often been in action when his master was sent by the Sultan in\r\ncommand of a detachment to ‘eat up’ some rebellious tribe. There\r\nwere several scars on ‘Snabi’s’ dun coat—which, in the sun,\r\nshone like gold. One ball could be distinctly felt in his neck.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second day we hunted the Haffa, a wood on the\r\nsouth side of the camp. The lances were placed along the side of the\r\nAwínats woods, and numbers of boar were found. But, pig-headed,\r\nthey refused to cross the plain, and took away out of sight over\r\nthe rough and open slope of the hill leading towards the sea; had\r\nwe foreseen which, we should have had long and hard runs.\r\n\r\nOne enormous fellow, the monster of the forest—described by Hadj\r\nHamed as being as big as my grey horse!—of a glistening grey\r\ncolour, and with tusks sticking out, as he said, like the horns of\r\na young bull, carried away in pursuit beaters and dogs towards the\r\nlake. From the moment this beast was found, he charged dog or man\r\nthat he happened to sight. He took his time, leisurely moving off\r\nat a slow trot, followed at a respectful distance by the beaters,\r\nstill charging any one who ventured to approach him. A messenger\r\nwas dispatched for us by Hadj Hamed and we started off in pursuit,\r\nbut arrived too late, the monster had entered the thicket.\r\n\r\nHadj Alarbi, the head beater, told me that he did not sleep a wink\r\nthat night from disappointment that the monster boar had escaped;\r\nbut he added, ‘I never should have allowed you to pursue the giant,\r\nfor he would have knocked over both horse and rider from sheer weight\r\nwhen he charged. I should have asked some of those “Nazarenes”\r\n(indicating the foreigners) to go to the front.’\r\n\r\nOn the third day it was decided to give a rest to dogs and\r\nhorses. Many of the party, therefore, went out snipe-shooting; but\r\nabout 2 p.m., a boar having been viewed by the Italian Minister\r\nnear the camp, Hadj Hamed proposed that we should have a beat of\r\nthe Haffa wood. I had hardly placed the lances along the rough\r\nhill-side between the camp and the sea-shore, when a large boar was\r\nviewed making towards the Shebenía. Away we rattled. C. W. led on\r\nhis fast horse, and, riding pluckily, got both first spear and a\r\nsecond spear on a charge. J. M. got third, and the boar then took\r\nto a thick clump of juniper. We left him there and returned to our\r\nposts in time to chase and kill another boar.\r\n\r\nHaving selected half a dozen beaters with their dogs, we returned\r\nto the clump of juniper and myrtle where the wounded boar had\r\nretreated. This thicket, standing not far from the sea-shore, covered\r\na space of about two hundred yards square, with open ground on every\r\nside. The dogs bayed at the boar, and the riders stood around the\r\nthicket down-wind—awaiting his exit, in the hope that, when rested,\r\nhe would move; but three-quarters of an hour, big with expectation,\r\npassed, and though the boar frequently charged the dogs to the brink\r\nof the thicket, and occasional howls told us that mischief was done,\r\nhe never broke, but after each charge went back to the densest part\r\nof the copse. I directed the beaters to halloo with all their might\r\nand sound the horn, but in vain.\r\n\r\nAs it was getting late I dismounted, and spear in hand went into the\r\nbush; but finding that with ten feet of bamboo in my hand I should\r\nbe at the mercy of the boar if he charged, I retreated.\r\n\r\nIn the open towards the sea I found two Moors, with guns, who had\r\ncome up from camp, standing near a boar-path in the hope of getting\r\na shot; for when a wounded boar takes to covert where horses cannot\r\npenetrate, the regulation against using fire-arms is in abeyance.\r\n\r\nSunset was drawing nigh, and, fearing that the wounded animal might\r\ndie in the thicket before next day, I told the hunters to creep in\r\nand shoot the boar. The Moor who had a long native gun declined,\r\nsaying he could not venture; for, if the boar charged in the bush,\r\nthrough which he would have to creep on hands and knees, the animal\r\nwould probably be on him before he could fire. But he volunteered\r\nto crawl along the top of the bushes, if stiff enough to support\r\nhim (he was a little wiry fellow), and thus perhaps he might get a\r\nshot. The other young Moor had a smart-looking double-barrelled gun,\r\na muzzle-loader, so I challenged him to enter. He replied he was\r\nnot going to risk his life with such a savage brute still strong in\r\nlimb. ‘Hark!’ he cried, as a rush, followed by a piteous howl\r\nfrom a hound, was heard. ‘You are a coward,’ I retorted angrily,\r\n‘to remain passive whilst our dogs are being killed.’ ‘You say\r\nthat I am a coward,’ he replied, handing me the gun; ‘then show\r\nthat you are not!’\r\n\r\nI hesitated, for though I had shot many wounded boar at bay or on\r\nthe charge, it had always been with my own trusty gun; but feeling\r\nI had wronged the Moor by taunting him with cowardice, and that he\r\nwould have the best of it if I did not take up the glove, I inquired\r\nhow his gun was loaded. He replied, ‘with ball.’ The copper caps\r\nlooked bright and appeared to have been lately put on, so, kneeling\r\ndown and keeping the gun before me at full-cock, I crawled in. The\r\nbush was too thick to stand up, for if I had squeezed myself into\r\nan upright position, my legs would have been at the mercy of the\r\npig if he charged, which I knew the beast would, if he got a whiff\r\nof me or viewed my legs. Moreover I could not have lowered my gun\r\nsuddenly in the thick bush to take aim.\r\n\r\nOn I crawled for about twenty-five yards, peering anxiously through\r\nthe bush. A dog which had been charged came close, and saluted me\r\nwith his tail and a whimper of satisfaction; then went back to his\r\ncompanions, and no doubt informed them, in dog language, that a man\r\nhad come to the rescue, for they set up forthwith a chorus of tongue,\r\nwhich again induced the boar to move and engrossed his attention;\r\nso, crawling on, I got within ten yards and viewed him, ‘cassant\r\nles noisettes,’ as French sportsmen say. Blood streamed down his\r\nside and his bristles stood on an end.\r\n\r\nI squatted, took deliberate aim behind the right shoulder and pulled\r\nthe trigger, expecting to see the beast roll over; but a fizz, a\r\nfaint report, and the sound of a bullet falling amongst the bushes,\r\nsounded like my death-knell; for I knew that the boar would in a few\r\nseconds be on me. With faint hope, however, that the second barrel\r\nwould not also contain a damp charge, I held my gun firm. On came\r\nthe huge beast, and when within three yards with his head towards me,\r\nI aimed at his left shoulder; the explosion was faint, but the beast\r\ndropped on his head, then rose, charging on to the muzzle of my gun,\r\nwhich I continued to hold steadily in front, sent it flying over\r\nmy head, whilst I toppled backwards, and with the force of the blow\r\nmy legs were thrown straight up into the air, and in that position\r\nI had sufficient presence of mind to remain, and could see through\r\nmy legs the grim monster’s head and tusks.\r\n\r\nThat moment appeared a lifetime, a thousand thoughts of past life\r\nflashed through my brain, but the chief one was—My epitaph—‘A\r\nfool killed by a pig.’ My last shot had broken his leg at the\r\nshoulder, so that the movements of the boar were less active; but\r\non he came, whilst I kept my legs aloft. It is better, I thought,\r\nto have my nether limbs ripped than more vital regions. So when\r\nhis grizzly snout was on me, I brought down with force my right\r\nleg, armed with a heavy shooting boot, like a Nasmyth hammer on\r\nhis skull, which sent the boar, who had only one sound fore-leg,\r\non his knees; this was followed up by the left leg, and I pummelled\r\nhis head alternately with each foot as the boar tried to get in at\r\nme. The right leg I managed to raise rapidly, so that it was not\r\ncut; but with the left I was less successful, and it was ripped\r\nin three places, as I found afterwards, for at the time I felt no\r\npain. ‘If no one comes to the rescue,’ I cried out, ‘I shall\r\nbe killed by the “halluf.”’ I had hardly spoken, when suddenly\r\nthere appeared standing on my left the brave beater, Ahmed Ben Ali,\r\nwith his hatchet raised in the air about to strike the boar, saying,\r\n‘La bas,’ equivalent to ‘all right.’\r\n\r\nThe boar left me and went at him; the lithe fellow struck the beast\r\nwith his hatchet whilst he jumped aside. A shot within a few yards\r\nfollowed. It was from the hunter who had kept his promise, having\r\ncrawled in a wonderful manner along the tops of the bushes close to\r\nwhere we were, and putting his long gun down on the beast, killed it.\r\n\r\nI lay prostrate, my legs and breast bespattered with blood from\r\nthe boar’s wounds and my own. Ahmed suddenly laid hold of me and\r\nbegan to take off my nether garments. Angered at what appeared to\r\nme an inexplicable liberty, I used some strong expressions, not the\r\nblessings he deserved for saving my life. Upon which Ahmed said,\r\n‘No time is to be lost: you have blood in front of your clothes,\r\nand if the bowels are injured, the wound must be sewn up before the\r\nair penetrates. I have needle and silk ready’ (carried by hunters\r\nto sew the wounds of dogs). I apologised for my rough language,\r\nand thanked the brave fellow for saving my life; then readjusting\r\nmy unmentionables, I said, ‘The boar has not wounded my body,\r\nonly my legs, I think,’ for I still felt no pain, but the blood\r\nwas trickling down, and I could feel my left boot was full of it.\r\n\r\nTaking a handkerchief and a stick, I made a sort of tourniquet above\r\nthe knee, and then Ahmed dragged me out of the thicket. I felt faint,\r\nnight was approaching, there were fifteen miles to ride to Tangier;\r\nbut I decided it would be better to return to town than to go to camp\r\nand next day find my wounds so stiff that I should not be able to\r\nride. I requested Ahmed to go to camp and send me a flask of brandy\r\nby my groom, and tell the latter he was to accompany me to town. I\r\ntold the hunters, who assembled round me with anxious faces, that\r\nI was not seriously hurt, but unfit for riding, and begged them to\r\nremain for next day’s hunt, declining the offer of many friends\r\nto accompany me to town.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, weary journey of fifteen miles. My horse stumbled\r\nnow and then over rocks and mud, for it became pitch dark after the\r\nfirst hour, and I had constant proof of the malignity of matter, for\r\nevery branch or twig we passed seemed to take pleasure in knocking\r\nagainst my wounds, causing me much pain, and yet I felt joyous,\r\nand thankful to God I had not fared worse.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at the foot of the stairs of the Legation I gave a cheery\r\n‘view halloo,’ so that my family might know I had arrived in good\r\nspirits. I was carried upstairs and a surgeon was sent for, who sewed\r\nup the wounds. The worst of them was a stab from a tusk, making a deep\r\nhole without ripping the flesh, as in the other cuts. For three weeks\r\nI lay on my back, though, as the surgeon observed, my flesh was like\r\nthat of a healthy child, the wound having closed without inflammation.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunters returned from the camp, I sent for brave Ahmed Ben\r\nAli who had saved my life, and gave him a gun and a sword.\r\n\r\nDuring the number of years I have hunted in Morocco, I have killed\r\nwith gun or spear upwards of five hundred boar, and only once have\r\nI been wounded. But I have been knocked over frequently through\r\ncarelessness in approaching boar at bay down-wind, or in stalking\r\nat night. The latter sport, especially when stalking a _solitaire_,\r\nis very exciting: it requires skill, patience, and great caution.\r\n\r\nI wear, when stalking, shoes with rope-soles, enabling me to tread\r\nnoiselessly over rough ground. I have stalked boar on a dark night\r\nup-wind, when feeding in corn, until I have approached the animal\r\nhidden by the crop, and have put the barrel of my gun within a foot of\r\nhis body before firing. When I heard the boar occupied in tearing off\r\na pod of Indian corn or munching grain, I advanced. When he stopped\r\nfeeding to listen, as they will cunningly do for several minutes,\r\nI stood motionless also, until the munching recommenced.\r\n\r\nOne very dark night I managed to approach so noiselessly along\r\na narrow path through a copse which led to an orchard—where I\r\nhad heard from the windows of my villa at ‘Ravensrock’ a boar\r\neating apples—that I actually pushed my knee against the boar,\r\nwho had his snout in an opposite direction, before either of us\r\nbecame aware that we were at close quarters. My gun was not cocked,\r\nfor I did not expect to have to use it until I entered the orchard,\r\nwhere I supposed the boar to be still feeding. The leap I made\r\nin the air was not more frantic than that of the boar, who jumped\r\ninto the thicket. We were both terribly startled. The boar had no\r\ndoubt in the still night heard me close the door of the balcony,\r\ntwo hundred yards off from the orchard, and had hidden in the dark\r\npath to listen and await events.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, having observed during my rides on the hill\r\nthat boar came down at night to a rough field of barley, I took my\r\ngun a little before sunset and rode to the ground. I left my nag\r\nin charge of a Moor, about a quarter of a mile from the field, and\r\ndirected him to keep quiet, and not to come near the field until I\r\nfired a shot. The crop of barley I had observed was poor and short,\r\nso I felt sure I should see the body of any boar worth firing at.\r\n\r\nI seated myself on a rock about three feet from the ground. In my\r\nbelt was a long Spanish knife, with a handle made to insert in the\r\nmuzzle of a gun, like a bayonet. The moon had set, the sky was cloudy,\r\nand starlight very faint. I wrapped a piece of white paper as a sight\r\naround the gun, a few inches from the lock, so that I could see it,\r\neven though the night was very dark. Just as the nine p.m. Gibraltar\r\ngun boomed across the Straits, I heard a rustling in the bush and\r\na grunt, warning me the enemy was nigh.\r\n\r\nThe wind was favourable; the boar had entered the field on a different\r\nside from what I expected. I strained my eyes to view the beast,\r\nwhom I could hear chewing the ears of barley, but could not at first\r\ndistinguish him.\r\n\r\nAt length he approached within fifteen yards from the rock where\r\nI was seated, and I could just see his head above the barley,\r\ntherefore I concluded, supposing the stalk was short, it was a sow\r\nor only a two-year-old. I waited until the object advanced within a\r\nfew yards, and I could see a good patch of black body. I fired, and\r\nheard the noise of the fall; then the boar rose, went a few yards,\r\nand tumbled over, and I could distinctly hear what appeared to be\r\nits death-struggles. Then all was still; I got down from the rock,\r\nbut did not reload, thinking there was no risk, and walked to the\r\nspot where I heard the struggles.\r\n\r\nIn the short barley were several low palmetto bushes. Seeing\r\na dark object move, as I fancied, I aimed and fired. It was a\r\npalmetto bush—the leaves shaken by the wind had rustled. Within\r\na few yards of this bush a large form suddenly rose and came slowly\r\ntowards me. Both barrels were empty. I had barely time to insert the\r\nSpanish knife in the muzzle of the gun when I could see a grim head\r\nand tusks glistening in the starlight. It was not, as I had supposed,\r\na sow or a pig; it was a tusker.\r\n\r\nThe ground was favourable, for I stood uphill above the boar. I held\r\nthe gun so that the knife should enter at the shoulder and not strike\r\nthe head. As the boar pressed on to reach me, I joyfully felt the\r\nblade penetrate into its body up to the hilt, and expected he would\r\nfall dead; but no, limping on one sound leg he continued to advance;\r\nso I backed, nearly falling over a palmetto bush; then the boar\r\nmoved to one side to get round upon me, and I followed his movements,\r\ndreading every moment that the knife, if the boar retreated, would\r\nbe withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAgain he came on with a rush, and I moved rapidly backwards until\r\nmy back came against a rock in the field about four feet from the\r\nground. I scrambled up it, pressing the knife and gun against the\r\nboar’s body to assist me. He tried to follow, but, with his disabled\r\nleg, failed and then moved away, carrying the knife in his body,\r\nwhilst I retained the gun. I reloaded safely on the rock, thanking\r\nGod for my narrow escape.\r\n\r\nAs the Moor came up with my horse I shouted to him to keep at\r\na distance, saying the boar was alive and close by. I then got\r\noff the rock and advanced carefully, with both barrels loaded, to\r\nthe spot to which I fancied the animal had retreated. Up he got,\r\nand came at me with a rush, receiving the contents of both barrels\r\nin his head and body. I found the long Spanish knife had entered\r\nthe neck above the shoulder, and passed along the skin without\r\npenetrating the body. The steel was not good, and had been bent\r\nduring the struggle. The boar proved to be a fine three-year-old,\r\nwith tusks which could have cut me into shreds. During my tussle\r\nwith this beast I had a vivid recollection of having heard that\r\na Moorish hunter, a short time before my adventure, had fired at\r\na boar at night in a field of Indian corn, and had followed up the\r\ntracks of blood at dawn for some distance, when he came suddenly upon\r\nthe wounded animal, who charged before he could fire, knocked him\r\ndown and ripped his body severely. His family, finding next morning\r\nhe did not return, sent out in quest of him to the field of corn,\r\nand there he was found in a dying state, wounded in the stomach,\r\njust able to relate what had happened. Within a few yards of the\r\nwounded man lay the tusker quite dead.\r\n\r\nSome years ago an English official at Tangier, R———, a very\r\nabsent man, sallied out one night to sit for a large boar, which\r\nwas reported to pass every evening after dusk a path not far from my\r\nstable at Ravensrock. Near this path in the bush was a rock, on which\r\nmy friend squatted with a double-barrelled gun to await the boar.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night, but the path of white sand in front,\r\ncontrasting with the green bush around, could be clearly seen, as also\r\nany object moving along it. He heard the tread of a large animal,\r\nand as it approached within a few feet he fired, but his horror and\r\ndismay can be imagined when down fell a donkey with panniers and a\r\nman on the top! Explanations ensued, with warm expressions of regret\r\non the part of R———, which were accepted good-naturedly by the\r\nMoor, especially when the former put in his hands double the value\r\nof the donkey and the panniers. The ball had passed through the top\r\nof the skull of the donkey. Strange to say the animal recovered,\r\nand was made use of in R———’s garden.\r\n\r\nBoar during the fruit-harvest come down to the orchards near Tangier\r\nand commit great ravages. When sufficient fruit is not scattered\r\non the ground, they will rub against apple or pear trees until the\r\nfruit falls, or they will spring on the top of a trellis of vines,\r\ntearing it down to the ground to get at the grapes. The Moors put\r\nnooses of rope at the gaps in the hedge where boar enter, and fasten\r\nthe noose to a tree or to a bundle of branches. The animal is often\r\nfound strangled in the morning; but when the rope is fastened to\r\nloose branches it is less likely to snap, and the boar will carry\r\noff the bundle, until stopped by an entanglement of the rope with\r\nsome other object.\r\n\r\nBeing out one day with a party of hunters, I saw at a distance a thick\r\nbush moving slowly, as by magic, along the top of a dense copse of gum\r\ncistus. No horse or man could be seen. One of the hunters exclaimed,\r\n‘a boar has been caught in a noose! See the bush to which it is\r\nfastened moving along the top of the copse.’ We decided to take\r\nthe animal alive, so approaching the bush and long rope to which the\r\nnoose was attached, we laid hold of the rope and pulled it tight,\r\nuntil the boar was half-strangled. We then gagged the beast with a\r\nthick stick and string. He was dragged out of the thicket, put on\r\na pack animal and carried to a room in my stable, where the gag was\r\nremoved and food and water given.\r\n\r\nNext day I invited a party of riders to see the boar turned loose in\r\nthe open, two or three miles away from the bush. The horsemen took\r\nno weapons, and our motley pack of boar-dogs were held in leash by\r\nhunters, who were directed to let go when I should give the signal\r\nafter the pig had a fair start of one hundred and fifty yards.\r\n\r\nSome ladies joined us on horseback, but my wife, being nervous,\r\nrode a donkey, and had a Moor to lead it and to take care of my\r\nyoung son, who was in front. I placed them on a hillock about\r\ntwo hundred yards off, where I thought they would be safe and be\r\nable to view the boar. Telling the horsemen and Moors who held the\r\ndogs in leash not to start until I gave the signal, I had the boar\r\nconveyed to a high bank on a dry watercourse, and then removing the\r\ngag and untying the rope, we dropped him gently down, thus giving\r\ntime for the men on foot to hide and me to mount before the boar\r\ncould charge us. He was only a two-year-old, so his tusks were not\r\nvery formidable. The boar bolted up the gulley, and on reaching the\r\ntop of the bank looked around, North, South, East and West, but saw\r\nno cover. Viewing my horse about forty yards off he charged, and I\r\ngalloped away. The boar halted, looked around, and saw on the mound\r\nan object with brilliant ribbons dangling in the wind, and then to my\r\ngreat consternation made straight for my wife’s donkey. In vain I\r\nrode full tilt, cracking my hunting-whip, trying to turn the beast,\r\nand shouting to the hunters to let the dogs slip; but before they\r\ncame up, the boar got under the donkey, trying to rip it, whilst the\r\nMoor, holding my son aloft on his shoulders, was kicking at the boar.\r\n\r\nUp came the dogs, who drew off the boar’s attention, and away he\r\nwent; but being better inclined to fight than to gallop, the chase\r\nwas short, and he was pulled down by the dogs.\r\n\r\n‘Take this knife,’ I said to a long Yankee official; ‘as this\r\nis your first boar-hunt, you shall have the honour of giving the\r\ndeath-blow.’ Knife in hand, the New Yorker fearlessly advanced,\r\nand was inserting expertly the blade near the region of the heart,\r\nwhen up jumped the dying pig, knocked over his lank antagonist,\r\nand then fell never to rise again.\r\n\r\nBoar when caught young become very attached to man, and will follow\r\nlike a dog. They can be taught cleanly habits when kept in a house,\r\nbut have no respect for flowers, and cannot resist rooting up any\r\nobject which is not firmly fixed in the ground or pavement. I had\r\na large sow as a pet, which followed me out riding for long distances.\r\n\r\nWhen attacked by dogs on passing villages, the sow would turn\r\non them and fight gallantly, until I came to the rescue with my\r\nhunting-whip. She became at length very troublesome, and would be\r\noff on the loose into the town whenever the stable-door happened to\r\nbe left open. I had frequent complaints from bakers and greengrocers,\r\nand had heavy damages to pay for robberies of bread, so I gave orders\r\nthat the sow was to be shut up in a yard.\r\n\r\nOne day, when the door had been left open, as the sow rushed\r\nrapidly up the street towards a greengrocer’s shop in the little\r\nmarket-place, where she was accustomed to rob, it happened that a\r\nyoung mulatto woman, whose legs had been paralysed for some years,\r\nand who gained her livelihood by begging, was crawling on her elbows\r\nand knees along the streets, coming down towards the Legation. She\r\nhad never seen a pig in her life, so when she beheld a large black\r\nanimal rushing frantically, as she supposed, to devour her, thought\r\nit was a ‘Jin[68].’\r\n\r\nThe shock was so great, that up she scrambled and ran off; the\r\nparalysis of her legs had ceased. This miracle performed by the sow\r\nwas a source of wonder to all, especially to the Mohammedans, loth\r\nto believe that ‘Allah’ should make use of the unclean animal\r\nto heal the maimed. The next day the mulatto appeared at my gate,\r\nwalking upright, to petition that I should give her compensation\r\nfor the fright she had experienced, pleading also that the pig had\r\ndeprived her of the means of gaining her livelihood, for she was now\r\nwhole, and no one took pity and bestowed alms on her as before. I\r\ngave her only my blessing, for she was strong and young, and could\r\nwork. The sow was presented by me to a gentleman in England, who\r\nwished to introduce a cross of the wild animal.\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of the boar is greater than that of most animals. A\r\nMoorish Sheikh dwelling in the mountains about forty miles from\r\nTangier, brought as a gift to the Basha a full-grown boar, that had\r\nbeen caught when only two months old. The animal had become very tame;\r\nit was brought tied on the back of a pack mule.\r\n\r\nA few days after presentation the Basha’s sons carried the boar\r\nout into the country and let it loose, slipping greyhounds to give\r\nchase. The boar knocked over the hounds, charged and ripped two\r\nhorses, and got away. Next morning it was found feeding quietly in\r\nthe yard of its master’s house, forty miles off! I was glad to\r\nlearn that the owner, on hearing how his pet had been treated by\r\nthe Basha’s sons, kept the animal until it died.\r\n\r\nIn the present century lions have rarely been seen in the Northern\r\nprovince of Morocco.\r\n\r\nDuring a residence of many years I have only heard of two having\r\nbeen seen in the woods between Tangier and Cape Spartel. I cannot\r\naccount for these lions having wandered so far from the Atlas\r\nMountains—where they are still to be found—except, as the Moors\r\nof those regions relate, that when the winter has been unusually\r\ncold and snow has fallen heavily, the wild animals which dwell in the\r\nhigher parts of the Atlas descend to the valleys and plains. Should\r\na thaw suddenly set in, and rivers and brooks become swollen, the\r\nlions and other wild animals which seek to return to the mountains\r\nare prevented repassing the rapid streams, and stray away from\r\nthe district, seeking for forest or for an uninhabited country,\r\nand, moving along the chain of hills to the northward, reach the\r\ndistrict of Spartel—which is about seven miles square—bounded on\r\nthe western side by the Atlantic and on the northern by the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning I had a visit from several inhabitants of the\r\nvillage of ‘Jamah Makra,’ not far from the site of my present\r\nvilla ‘Ravensrock,’ which stands on a hill, three miles out of\r\nTangier, surrounded by woods. The men came to request that I should\r\nassemble my hunters and sally out in pursuit of a wild animal which,\r\nthey related, had lacerated with its claws the flank of a mare and\r\nbitten it in the neck. They informed me that they had been roused in\r\nthe middle of the night by the tramp of horses galloping through the\r\nlanes—snorting and neighing—and supposed that cavalry had been\r\nsent to surround the village. But to their surprise they found their\r\nown ponies (which are allowed to run loose on the hills when not\r\nrequired for agricultural purposes, and live in a half-wild state,\r\nnever allowing man to approach them, especially at night-time) had by\r\ninstinct sought safety in the village, trying to penetrate even into\r\nthe huts. Amongst the herd was the wounded mare, in a dying state.\r\n\r\nI assembled a party of hunters with their boar-dogs, and proceeding\r\nto the spot we found round the village tracks of a large animal;\r\nevidently of the feline race, as the footprints were round, with no\r\nmark of nails, but had pads, as in the print of a cat’s foot. The\r\nbeast appeared to have avoided as much as possible the open path,\r\nand to have walked near or amongst the ilex bushes, on which we found\r\nlong tawny hairs, showing it was a male lion. We also came across the\r\nhalf-eaten carcasses of a boar and of a porcupine. There were marks\r\ntoo as of a herd of boar making a stampede in a southerly direction,\r\nfleeing from the dread monarch of the woods.\r\n\r\nWe turned our dogs into the thicket—where, by the tracks, we knew\r\nthe lion had entered—and placed two guns at each run. But the\r\ndogs returned from the thicket and shrank behind their masters. They\r\nhad evidently come upon or winded the lion, and we could not induce\r\nthem to hunt. The beaters, after entering the thicket, firing guns,\r\nand beating drums, refused to advance further; so we had to abandon\r\nthe hunt.\r\n\r\nA woman whom we met informed us that, on going to a fountain in\r\nher orchard to draw water, she had met a ‘jin’ (evil spirit),\r\nevidently, from her description, a lion; that she became paralysed\r\nfrom fright and could not move; that the ‘jin’ had eyes like\r\nlamps, and after gazing at her had turned aside into the bush.\r\n\r\nThe Moors believe that lions will never attack a nude woman, such\r\nis the magnanimous beast’s delicate sense of shame. Lionesses,\r\nit is to be concluded, are less particular. The dame did not mention\r\nthat she had a knowledge of this, so we know not whether she dropped\r\nher vestments to save her life.\r\n\r\nThere was a good moon; so I determined to sit for the lion,\r\nsafely perched on a rock, where, though it would be possible for\r\na lion to climb, yet I should have had a great advantage in an\r\nencounter with gun and pistols. I passed the night in a state of\r\nexcitement—starting at every rustle made by rabbit, ichneumon,\r\nor even rats—without seeing anything of the king of beasts. But\r\nabout midnight I heard what sounded from a distance like the deep\r\nbellow of a bull.\r\n\r\nA few days later, hearing that the track of the lion had been seen\r\nat ‘Ain Diab,’ a wood near Cape Spartel, I collected the hunters\r\nand rode to the ground, about eight miles from Tangier. There we\r\ntracked the lion into a dense thicket. The dogs again refused to\r\nhunt, as on the previous occasion, winding no doubt the lion. This\r\nwas good proof that he was at home; so posting the guns, I directed\r\nthe beaters to drive the wood from the foot of the hill and that\r\nguns should occasionally be fired and drums beaten.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after I had taken up my post a Moor hurried up to\r\nwhere I was standing, in a great state of excitement, pale as death,\r\nsaying, ‘I have seen the man[69]!’ ‘What man?’ I asked. He\r\nrepeated, ‘I have seen the man! I had entered the thicket to look\r\nat an olive-tree from which I thought I could cut a good ramrod;\r\nthere is a rock rising about twenty feet above the olive-tree,\r\nand as I stooped to look whence I could best cut a branch, I saw a\r\ngreat shaggy head, with fierce eyes glaring at me from between two\r\nhuge paws. I had laid down my gun to cut the olive stick; I dared\r\nnot turn to take it up again, so left it there and crawled back\r\nthrough the bush to tell you what I have seen.’\r\n\r\nThe rock, which he then pointed out, was about two hundred yards from\r\nwhere we stood. I collected the sportsmen and selected three of them\r\n(my brother and two Moors upon whose courage I could depend), and we\r\ndetermined to beard the lion in his den. My left arm was in a sling,\r\nhaving been injured while playing cricket a few days previously. As\r\nwe advanced into the dense thicket I was prevented, by the pain\r\ncaused by the branches knocking against my arm, from following\r\nquickly my companions. Carried away by their desire to slay the lion,\r\nthey rushed on headlong, regardless of wait-a-bit thorns and other\r\nimpediments; so I was left in the lurch. Feeling uncertain about the\r\nexact direction they had taken, but hearing, as I thought, the sound\r\nof some one passing in front of me, I shouted, ‘Where are you? why\r\nare you returning?’ No reply. Yet it was evident the moving object\r\nhad approached me within a very few yards. Again I called, ‘Why\r\ndon’t you speak?’ Then I heard a rush, as I suddenly came to\r\nan open spot of sandy soil, upon which I could trace the footmarks\r\nof the lion who had just passed. The animal had evidently moved\r\naway from the rock when he heard or saw the three men approaching,\r\nand having no desire to attack man unprovoked, had doubled back,\r\npassing close to me. All this flashed through my brain; I halted,\r\nkept perfectly still, holding my breath, for I had not the courage,\r\nalone and with an injured arm, to follow the dread beast. Moreover,\r\nI could never have caught it up, at least I tried so to convince\r\nmyself, and thus to hush any feeling of shame at my cowardice.\r\n\r\nMy companions returned a few minutes afterwards, reporting that they\r\nhad reached the rock where the lion had been; but he had evidently\r\nleft on their approach, and they had tracked him through the bush to\r\nthe spot where I had stood when he passed. We followed the direction\r\nthe lion took for some time without success, and we supposed he must\r\nhave made off at a swinging trot.\r\n\r\nThe following day we heard that an ox had been killed on the hills\r\nof Anjera between Tangier and Tetuan, and that the lion had gone in\r\nthe direction of the snow-topped mountains of Beni Hassén.\r\n\r\nOn each visit of a lion to the Tangier district the track of a hyena\r\nhad been seen to follow that of the sultan of the forest.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when there were rumours of a lion having been\r\nheard of in the Tangier district, and we were out hunting boar in\r\nthe woods near Spartel, I heard several shots fired from the side\r\nof a hill where I had posted the guns, and a beater shouting to me,\r\nas I stood hidden behind a small rock in some low bush, ‘“Ya el\r\nAwar!”—Oh ye blind! The lion to you!’ An instant after I viewed,\r\nbounding over the bushes, a large shaggy animal. With its huge mouth\r\nopen and bristling mane, it looked very terrible; but I knew at\r\nonce it was not a lion; so I waited till the beast was within a few\r\nyards and sent a bullet through its heart. It turned out to be a very\r\nlarge Hyena rufus—striped, not spotted—larger than any specimen\r\nof that animal I have seen in the Zoological Gardens or any menagerie.\r\n\r\nThe stench of the animal was overpowering; the skin was in beautiful\r\ncondition, and proved very handsome when preserved.\r\n\r\nA grand lion was seen many years ago, standing in the early morning on\r\nthe sand-hills which line the beach close to the town of Tangier,\r\nand causing great alarm. But it turned out to be a tame lion\r\nwhich a ‘Shloh’ woman—who, as a Sherífa, was endowed with\r\na slight halo of sanctity—had brought captive from the Atlas\r\nMountains. She led it about with only a loose rope round its neck,\r\nas she begged from village to village, and had arrived outside the\r\ngates of Tangier the previous evening, after they were closed, and\r\nshe had laid down to sleep near the lion, which, during the night,\r\nhad strayed away. This lion was quite tame and harmless, and came\r\nback to her from the sand-hills when she called it.\r\n\r\nA Spanish gentleman told me that returning home late one dark night\r\nfrom a party in Tangier, carrying a small lantern to light his way,\r\nhe saw what he fancied was a donkey coming towards him in one of the\r\nvery narrow streets of the town where two stout persons on meeting\r\ncan hardly pass each other. He turned his lantern on the object,\r\nand, to his dismay, saw the glistening eyes and shaggy head of a\r\nlion which he had already seen led in daytime by the woman through\r\nthe streets. The beast was alone, without its keeper. The Don said\r\nhe had never made himself so small as when he stood against a closed\r\ndoor to allow his Majesty to pass; which he did quite pacifically.\r\n\r\n‘Oh ye blind! The lion to you!’\r\n\r\nThis accusation of blindness is perhaps the mildest form of abuse\r\nemployed by the beaters, in the excitement of the hunt, to the guns\r\nposted to await the boar. Sir John, as Master of the Hunt, shared\r\nin the very liberal abuse indulged in by the men who had laboriously\r\ndriven the boar from the thick coverts towards him and his friends,\r\nnative and foreign, who waited to shoot the pigs as they broke. Every\r\npossible term of abuse—and Arabic is rich in such—together with\r\nimprecations such as only Oriental imagination could devise, would be\r\nyelled at them as a warning not to miss. Strangers too would always\r\nbe indicated by any peculiarity in their appearance or dress. Neither\r\ndid the excited beaters, at such moments, put any check on their\r\nrough wit. But the railing of Moorish sportsmen at each other,\r\nhowever violent in the ardour of the chase, is never resented.\r\n\r\nAs a case in point, Sir John related the following story.\r\n\r\nA former Governor of Tangier, a thorough sportsman, was out hunting\r\non one occasion, when a man of low degree who was acting as beater,\r\nand, as is usually the case, had his own dogs with him, started a boar\r\nin the direction of the Basha, who was sitting near the animal’s\r\nexpected path ready to receive him. The beater called out, swearing\r\nlustily at the Basha, and using every opprobrious term he could think\r\nof; adding that if he missed his shot he should never be allowed to\r\nfire again!\r\n\r\nThe Basha fired and killed the boar.\r\n\r\nSome little time after, when the beat was finished, the huntsmen\r\nassembled as usual, and the Basha asked who it was that had started\r\nthe boar he had shot. The poor beater, feeling he had exercised\r\nthe licence of the chase rather too boldly, kept somewhat in the\r\nbackground, but, on this challenge, came forward and acknowledged\r\nthat it was he who had done so.\r\n\r\n‘And what did you shout out to me when the boar took in my\r\ndirection?’ asked the Basha. The beater, dismayed, was silent. But\r\non the question being repeated, acknowledged having called out,\r\n‘The boar to you—oh blind one!’\r\n\r\n‘Only that!’ exclaimed the Basha. ‘Surely I heard you abuse\r\nme. Tell me what you said.’\r\n\r\nIn reply to this the beater, in desperation, burst out with all\r\nthe abuse he had uttered. Whereupon the Basha, taking from his\r\nwallet four ‘metskal’ (then worth some three Spanish dollars),\r\npresented them to the beater, saying, ‘Take this. I know you were\r\nanxious on account of your dogs, and for the success of the sport. I\r\npardon your abuse of me.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement from his official position, Sir John lived\r\nlittle more than seven years, dividing his time between Morocco and\r\nEurope, returning, as has been said, for the winter to his beloved\r\n‘Ravensrock,’ enjoying his sport to the end, and at intervals\r\njotting down his ‘Scraps from my Note-book’ as a slight record\r\nof his life. ‘I feel,’ he says, referring to the appearance\r\nof some of his stories in _Murray’s Magazine_, ‘like a dwarf\r\namongst tall men. Never mind. If my relatives and friends are pleased\r\nand amused, I shall continue to unwind the skein of my life till I\r\nreach my infancy.’ Among the last of the notes made by Sir John\r\nin his ‘Note-book’ was the following, which may be appropriately\r\nintroduced at the close of this sketch of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Body and Soul._\r\n\r\n‘The death of the aged is always easy,’ said the F’ki Ben Yahia,\r\n‘compared with the death of the young.’\r\n\r\n‘This arises,’ continued the F’ki, ‘from the willingness\r\nwith which the immortal soul is glad to flee from an aged body,\r\ncorrupted by a long residence in this world, and from disgust at the\r\nsin and wickedness into which it has been plunged by the depravity\r\nof the body. Whereas, the young body and soul are loth to part;\r\nfor the soul rejoices in the innocent enjoyments of youth and the\r\nharmless pleasures of this world, and to separate them is, as it were,\r\nto separate the young damsel from her first pure love.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, merciful God!’ exclaimed the F’ki, ‘put away the\r\ncorruption of my body, and teach me to follow the purer inspiration\r\nof the soul which was breathed into me by Thee, O Almighty and\r\nIncomprehensible God!’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Berwickshire, at Wedderburn Castle, a place then rented by him, Sir\r\nJohn Hay Drummond Hay died on the evening of Monday, Nov. 27, 1893.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in the churchyard of Christ Church, Duns. A few days\r\nafter the funeral one of the family received a letter from a member\r\nof the British Legation at Tangier, in which he mentioned that on\r\ngoing to the Legation on the morning of Nov. 27, he was surprised\r\nto see the British flag at half-mast, and, calling to the kavass in\r\ncharge, reprimanded him for his carelessness, directing him to take\r\nthe flag down.\r\n\r\nThe kavass excused himself, saying that, while hauling down the flag\r\nthe previous evening, the halyard had broken, and he had consequently\r\nbeen unable to lower the flag further; but that he had sent for a\r\nman to swarm the mast and repair the halyard and thus release the\r\nflag. This however, the writer added, was not accomplished till\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that while the man was passing away who for forty\r\nyears had represented Great Britain in Morocco, the British flag\r\nremained at half-mast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n  Abbas Pasha, 26.\r\n\r\n  Abbotsford, 3.\r\n\r\n  Abd-el-Hadi, 136.\r\n\r\n  Abd-el-Kader, 69, 71, 72.\r\n\r\n  Abd-el-Kerim, 227.\r\n\r\n  Aberdalgie, 6.\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, Lord, 44, 66, 68.\r\n\r\n  Acre, 30.\r\n\r\n  Addington, H.

The instrument of torture is made of wood, and resembles the\r\nouter hooded garment of a Franciscan friar. It is placed upright,\r\nand the victim is squeezed into it in a standing position; points of\r\niron project in various parts preventing the inmate from reclining\r\nor resting any part of his body without great suffering. There he\r\nis left upon bread and water, to pass days and nights, until he\r\ndivulges where his wealth is hidden.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Mohammedans believe that dates of all deaths are\r\nwritten in a book by Allah.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Fatmeh is dead.

There are two wide gates adjoining each other\r\nthrough which the galleys were hauled up and placed in safety. The\r\ngateways are of beautiful solid brick masonry; the north wall is\r\nof stone; on the south-eastern side high ground rises from this\r\nenclosure. On the top of the hill there are the remains of a rude\r\n‘Campus Aestivus.’ About a mile up the river are the ruins of\r\na Roman bridge leading to Tangier, the Tingis of the Romans; the\r\nchief arch of this interesting monument fell in 1880. The date of\r\nthe arsenal and bridge is, I believe, the year 1 A.D.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: About twenty miles from Trafalgar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: House of succour.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Readers may be shocked that such barbarities are\r\npractised by the Moors; but they are a thousand years behind the\r\ncivilised world, and surprise can hardly be felt when we remember\r\nthat a sentence of mutilation was carried out in England little more\r\nthan 300 years ago. Camden’s _Annals_ for the year 1581 contain an\r\naccount of the mutilation of one Stubbs, for publishing an attack upon\r\nQueen Elizabeth’s proposed marriage with the Duke of Alençon. The\r\nhistorian was an eyewitness of the scene, which has been utilised\r\nby Sir Walter Scott in the _Fortunes of Nigel_, chap. xiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: A Moorish beehive is made from the bark of the\r\ncork-tree. In the summer months, when the sap rises, a vertical\r\nincision about four feet long is made through the cork to the inner\r\nbark, and the part to be removed, having been cut above and below,\r\nis hammered with a heavy mallet. The cork is separated from the\r\nstem of the tree, and being elastic, is taken off entire. Two\r\ncircular pieces of cork are inserted in the orifices at each end\r\nand fastened with wooden pegs. The bees close with wax the cracks\r\nwhich may appear. The hive is warm, and keeps out both wet and sun.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Mr. Reade was Consul, Mr. Green Private Secretary.

The Sultan evidently desired to impress Mr. Hay with the\r\nstrength of his army.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: The duties on the export of wheat and barley were\r\nnever added to those noted above, in spite of Sir John’s constant\r\nand unceasing endeavours.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: In allusion to the manner in which, in ancient times,\r\nJews and Christians in Morocco were put to death. The victims were\r\nsuspended by large iron hooks through the flesh of their backs;\r\none of these hooks was still to be seen on a gate of the city of\r\nMarákesh in 1846; or a spit was run through their bodies, and they\r\nremained transfixed till death put an end to their tortures.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: The late Sultan Sid Mohammed, the descendant of Sultan\r\nMulai Ahmed, was a good mathematician, and also very clever as a\r\nmechanist. He mended and cleaned his own watches. When I presented\r\nH.M. with a breech-loading gun, and at his request took it and the\r\nlock to pieces, I bungled in putting them together. H.M., taking\r\nthe gun from me, at once re-adjusted it.—J. H. D.

The tubers when collected\r\nare cut up in small pieces, which they wash in many waters and then\r\nsteam, as they do their ‘siksu,’ after which they pound them\r\ninto meal, of which they make cakes, mixed if possible with a little\r\n‘dra’ (millet) meal.
