Putnam’S Sons\r\n\r\nThe Knickerbocker Press, New York\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\nIn attempting to write a life of William the Conqueror, one is\r\nconfronted, at the outset, by a question of considerable urgency. The\r\nmere details of the King’s history, if full discussion were given to all\r\nmatters which have been the subjects of controversy, would far exceed\r\nthe possible limits of a volume to be included in the series to which\r\nthe present book belongs. On the other hand, a life of William the\r\nConqueror which ignored the changes in constitutional organisation and\r\nsocial life which followed the events of 1066 would obviously be a very\r\nimperfect thing. Accordingly, I have reserved the last three chapters of\r\nthe book for some examination of these questions; and I hope that the\r\nfootnotes to the text may serve as, in some sort, a guide to the more\r\ndifficult problems arising out of the Conqueror’s life and reign.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to enter here upon a description of the authorities on\r\nwhich the following book is based. For the most part they have been the\r\nsubjects of thorough discussion; and, with one exception, they are\r\nsufficiently accessible in modern editions. The writs and charters\r\nissued over England by William I. are only to be found scattered among a\r\ngreat number of independent publications; and the necessity of forming a\r\ncollection of these documents has materially delayed the appearance of\r\nthe present work.\r\n\r\nIt remains that I should here tender my thanks to all those who have\r\nrendered assistance to me during the writing of this book. In particular\r\nI would express my gratitude to my friend Mr. Roland Berkeley-Calcott,\r\nand to the general editor of this series, Mr. H. W. C. Davis. To Mr.\r\nDavis I am indebted for invaluable help and advice given to me both\r\nduring the preparation of the book and in the correction of the\r\nproof-sheets. To those modern writers whose works have re-created the\r\nhistory of the eleventh century in England and Normandy I hope that my\r\nreferences may be a sufficient acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n                                                            F.

Their raids, an ever-present danger\r\nto those who dwelt near the shores of the narrow seas, wrecked the\r\nincipient centralisation of the Carolingian Empire, and gave fresh\r\nimpetus to the forces which were already making for that organisation of\r\nsociety which we describe as feudalism; and yet in other lands the\r\nNorthmen were to preserve their own archaic law and social custom longer\r\nthan any other people of Germanic stock. The Northmen were to bring a\r\nnew racial element into the life of Western Europe, but whether that\r\nelement should adapt itself to the conditions of its new environment, or\r\nwhether it should develop new forms of political association for itself,\r\nwas a question determined by the pre-existing facts of history and\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nFor the geographical extent of Scandinavian enterprise is as remarkable\r\nas its political influence. At the close of the third quarter of the\r\ntenth century it seemed likely that the future destinies of northern\r\nEurope would be controlled by a great confederation of Scandinavian\r\npeoples. In the parent lands of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden three strong\r\nkingdoms had been created by Harold Fair Hair, Gorm the Old, and Eric of\r\nUpsala; the Orkneys and Shetlands formed a Norwegian earldom, and a\r\nnumber of vigorous Norse principalities had been planted along the east\r\ncoast of Ireland. In the extreme north Scandinavian adventurers were\r\nalready settling the inhospitable shores of Greenland, and lawless\r\nchieftains from Norway had created the strange republic of Iceland,\r\nwhose stormy life was to leave an imperishable memorial in the wonderful\r\nliterature of its sagas. Normandy was still the “pirates’ land” to the\r\necclesiastical writers of France, and the designation was correct in so\r\nfar that the duchy still maintained frequent relations with the\r\nScandinavian homeland and had as yet received no more than a superficial\r\ntincture of Latin Christianity. England, at the date we have chosen, was\r\nenjoying a brief respite between two spasms of the northern peril, but\r\nthe wealthiest portion of the land was Scandinavian in the blood of its\r\ninhabitants, and within twenty years of the close of the century the\r\nwhole country was to be united politically to the Scandinavian world.\r\n\r\nThe comparative failure of this great association of kindred peoples to\r\ncontrol the subsequent history of northern Europe was due in the main to\r\nthree causes. In the first place, over a great part of this vast area\r\nthe Scandinavian element was too weak in mere numbers permanently to\r\nwithstand the dead weight of the native population into which it had\r\nintruded itself. It was only in lands such as Iceland, where an\r\nautochthonous population did not exist, or where it was reduced to utter\r\nsubjugation at the outset, as in the Orkneys, that the Scandinavian\r\nelement permanently impressed its character upon the political life of\r\nthe community. And in connection with this there is certainly to be\r\nnoted a distinct decline in the energy of Scandinavian enterprise from\r\nabout the middle of the eleventh century onward. For fully a hundred\r\nyears after this time the Northern lands continued to send out sporadic\r\nbodies of men who raided more peaceful countries after the manner of the\r\nolder Vikings, but Scandinavia produced no hero of more than local\r\nimportance between Harold Hardrada and Gustavus Vasa. The old spirit was\r\nstill alive in the North, as the stories of the kings of Norway in the\r\n_Heimskringla_ show; but the exploits of Magnus Bareleg and Sigurd the\r\nJerusalem-farer are of far less significance in general history than the\r\nexploits of Swegen Forkbeard and Olaf Tryggvasson, and trade and\r\nexploration more and more diverted the energy which in older times would\r\nhave sought its vent in warlike adventure. And of equal importance with\r\neither of the causes which have just been described must be reckoned the\r\nattraction of Normandy within the political system of France. By this\r\nprocess Normandy was finally detached from its parent states; it\r\nparticipated ever more intimately in the national life of France, and\r\nthe greatest achievement of the Norman race was performed when, under\r\nthe leadership of William the Conqueror, it finally drew England from\r\nits Scandinavian connections, and united it to the richer world of\r\nwestern Europe. It was the loss of England which definitely compelled\r\nScandinavia to relapse into isolation and comparative political\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nBut the Norman Conquest of England was a many-sided event, and its\r\ninfluence on the political destiny of Scandinavia is not its most\r\nimportant aspect. The events of 1066 derive their peculiar interest from\r\nthe fact that they supply a final answer to the great problem which\r\nunderlies the whole history of England in the eleventh century—the\r\nproblem whether England should spend the most critical period of the\r\nMiddle Ages in political association with Scandinavia or with France.\r\nThe mere fact that the question at issue can be stated in this simple\r\nform is of itself a matter of much significance; for it implies that the\r\ncontinuance of the independent life of England had already in 1000\r\nbecome, if not an impossibility, at least a very remote contingency. To\r\nexplain why this was so will be the object of the following pages, for\r\nit was the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon polity which permitted the\r\nsuccess of William of Normandy, as it gave occasion of conquest to Cnut\r\nof Denmark before him, and the ill governance on which their triumph was\r\nfounded takes its main origin from events which happened a hundred years\r\nbefore the elder of them was born.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the third quarter of the ninth century, England was\r\nin a state of utter chaos under the terrible strain of the Danish wars.\r\nUp to the present it has not been possible to distinguish with any\r\ncertainty between the various branches of the great Scandinavian race\r\nwhich co-operated in the attack on England, nor is the question of great\r\nimportance for our immediate purpose. The same may be said of the\r\ndetails of the war, the essential results of which were that the midland\r\nkingdom of Mercia was overrun and divided in 874 into an English and a\r\nDanish portion; that England, north of the Humber, became a Danish\r\nkingdom in or about 875; and that Wessex, after having been brought to\r\nthe brink of ruin by that portion of the Northern host which had not\r\nfounded a permanent settlement in the north, was saved by its King\r\nAlfred in a victory which he won over the invaders at Edington in\r\nWiltshire, in 878. As a result of this battle, and of some further\r\nsuccesses which he gained at a later date, Alfred was enabled to add to\r\nhis dominions that half of the old kingdom of Mercia which the Danes had\r\nnot already appropriated[4]; a district which included London and the\r\nshires west of Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, and\r\nDerbyshire. For the first half of the tenth century, the main interest\r\nof English history centres round the relations between the rulers of\r\nWessex and its Mercian dependency, and the people of the Danelaw.\r\n\r\nAs the final result of twenty years of incessant warfare, the Danes had\r\nsucceeded in establishing three independent states on English soil.\r\nGuthrum, the leader with whom Alfred had fought at Edington, founded in\r\nEast Anglia and the eastern midlands a short-lived kingdom which had\r\nbeen reconquered by Edward the Elder before his death in or about 924.\r\nTo the north of Guthrum’s kingdom came the singular association of the\r\nFive Boroughs of Derby, Nottingham, Lincoln, Leicester, and Stamford,\r\nwhose territory most probably comprised the shires to which the first\r\nfour of them have given name, together with Rutland and north-east\r\nNorthamptonshire. Apart from its anomalous government, of which nothing\r\nis really known, this district is distinguished from Guthrum’s kingdom\r\nby the fact that the Danish invaders settled there in great numbers,\r\nfounded many new villages, and left their impress upon the\r\nadministrative and fiscal arrangements of the country. The Five Boroughs\r\nwere occupied by Edward the Elder and conquered by his son Edmund, but\r\ntheir association was remembered in common speech as late as the time of\r\nthe wars of Ethelred and Swegen, and the district, as surveyed in\r\n_Domesday Book_, is distinguished very sharply from the shires to its\r\nsouth and west.[5]\r\n\r\nBeyond the Humber the Northmen had founded the kingdom of York, which\r\nmaintained its independent existence down to Athelstan’s time and which\r\nwas only connected with the south of England by the slackest of\r\npolitical ties when William the Conqueror landed at Pevensey. In this\r\nkingdom, whose history is very imperfectly known, but of which abundant\r\nnumismatic memorials remain, the Norwegian element appears to have\r\npredominated over the Danish and its kings were closely connected with\r\nthe rulers of the Norse settlements in Ireland. But the peculiar\r\nimportance of this Northumbrian kingdom lies in the persistent\r\nparticularism which it continued to display long after it had been\r\nnominally merged in the kingdom of the English. Its inhabitants were\r\nbarbarous beyond the ordinary savagery of the Anglo-Saxons, and bitterly\r\nresented any attempt to make them conform to the low standard of order\r\nwhich obtained elsewhere in the land. Among so anarchical a people, it\r\nwould be useless to look for any definite political ideas, and the\r\nsituation was complicated by the union of Scandinavian Yorkshire with\r\nEnglish Bernicia in one earldom, so that it is difficult to say how far\r\nthe separatist spirit of Northumbria was due to the racial differences\r\nwhich distinguished it from the rest of the land, how far to surviving\r\nmemories of the old kingdom which had existed before the wars of the\r\nninth century, and how far to simple impatience of ordered rule by\r\nwhomsoever administered. But the existence of such a spirit is beyond\r\nall doubt; it manifested itself in 957 when Northumbria joined with\r\nMercia in rejecting King Edwy of Wessex; it is strikingly illustrated in\r\nthe northern legend which represents the sons of Ethelred the Unready as\r\noffering Northumbria to Olaf of Norway as the price of his assistance in\r\ntheir struggle with Cnut; it came to the front in 1065, when the\r\nnorthern men rebelled against their southern earl, Tostig Godwinsson; it\r\nculminated in the resistance which they offered to William of Normandy,\r\nand was finally suppressed in the harrying to which he subjected their\r\nprovince in the winter of 1069. For a century and a half the men of\r\nNorthumbria had persisted in sullen antagonism to the political\r\nsupremacy of Wessex.\r\n\r\nBut the fact remained that within fifty years of Alfred’s death the\r\nhouse of Wessex had succeeded in extending its sway, in name at least,\r\nover all the Scandinavian settlers within the limits of England. The\r\n“Rex Westsaxonum” had become the “Rex Anglorum,” and Edmund and Edgar\r\nruled over a kingdom which to all appearance was far more coherent than\r\nthe France of Louis d’Outremer and Hugh Capet. But the appearance was\r\nvery deceptive, and the failure of the kings of Wessex was so intimately\r\nconnected with the success of William the Conqueror that its causes\r\ndemand attention here.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the assimilation of the Scandinavian settlers into\r\nthe body of the English nation should not hide from us the fact that a\r\nnew and disturbing element had in effect been intruded into the native\r\npopulation. This amalgamation was very far from resulting in a\r\nhomogeneous compound. The creation of the “Danelaw” in its legal\r\nsense—that is, a district whose inhabitants obeyed a new law perfectly\r\ndistinct from that of any native kingdom—was an event of the greatest\r\nconsequence. It imposed a tangible obstacle to the unification of the\r\ncountry which was never overcome until the entire system of old English\r\nlaw had become obsolete. The very fact that the geographical area of the\r\nDanelaw did not correspond with that of any English kingdom or group of\r\nkingdoms makes its legal individuality all the more remarkable. The\r\ndifferences of customary practice which distinguished the east from the\r\nwest and south were a permanent witness to the success of the Danes in\r\nEngland and they applied to just those matters which concerned most\r\ndeeply the ordinary life of the common people. A man of Warwickshire\r\nwould realise the fact that his limbs were valued at a higher or lower\r\nrate than those of his neighbour of Leicestershire, when he would be\r\nprofoundly indifferent to the actions of the ruler of both counties in\r\nthe palace at Winchester.\r\n\r\nMore important for our purpose than these general legal peculiarities\r\nwere the manifold anomalies of the Old English land law. Were it not for\r\nthe existence of Domesday Book we should be in great part ignorant of\r\nthe main features of this system; as it is we need have no hesitation in\r\ncarrying back the tenurial customs which obtained in 1066 well beyond\r\nthe beginning of the century. So far as the evidence before us at\r\npresent goes, it suggests that for an indefinite period before the\r\nNorman Conquest the social structure of the English people had remained\r\nin a condition of unstable equilibrium; in a state intermediate between\r\nthe primitive organisation of Anglo-Saxon society and the feudalism,\r\nthough rudimentary, of contemporary France. However strong the tie of\r\nkindred may have been in drawing men together into agrarian communities\r\nin former days, by the eleventh century at latest its influence had been\r\nreplaced by seignorial pressure and the growth of a manorial economy. Of\r\nitself this was a natural and healthy process, but in England, from a\r\nvariety of causes it had been arrested at an early stage. The\r\nrelationship between lord and man was the basis of the English social\r\norder, but this relationship over a great part of the country was still\r\nessentially a personal matter; its stability had not universally\r\nacquired that tenurial guarantee which was the rule in the Frankish\r\nkingdom. The ordinary free man of inferior rank was expected to have\r\nover him a lord who would be responsible for his good behaviour, but the\r\nevidence which proves this proves also that in numberless cases the\r\nrelationship was dissoluble at the will of the inferior party. In the\r\nDomesday survey of the eastern counties, for example, no formula occurs\r\nwith more striking frequency than that which asserts that such and such\r\na free man “could depart with his land whither it pleased him”; a\r\nformula implying clearly enough that the man in question could withdraw\r\nhimself and his land from the control of his temporary lord, and seek,\r\napparently at any time, another patron according to the dictate of his\r\nown fancy. In such a system there is room for few only of the ideas\r\ncharacteristic of continental feudalism; it is clear that the man in no\r\neffective sense holds his land of his lord, nor is the former’s tenure\r\nconditional upon the rendering of service to the latter. The tie between\r\nlord and man was that of patronage rather than vassalage; and its\r\nessential instability meant that the whole of the English social order\r\nwas correspondingly weak and unstable. The Old English state had\r\naccepted the principle that a man must needs look for protection to\r\nsomeone stronger than himself, but it had not advanced to the further\r\nidea that, for the mere sake of social cohesion, the relationship thus\r\ncreated must be made certain, permanent, and, so far as might be,\r\nuniform throughout the whole land.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it is probable that this result was mainly due to the\r\npeculiar settlement which the Danish question had received in the early\r\ntenth century. Had the Danes conquered Wessex in Alfred’s time, so that\r\nthe whole of England had been parcelled out among four or five\r\nindependent Scandinavian states, the growth of seignorial control over\r\nfree men and their land might have been indefinitely postponed. Had\r\nAlfred’s successors been able to effect the incorporation of the Danelaw\r\nwith the kingdom of Wessex, the incipient manorialism of the south might\r\nhave been extended to the east and a rough uniformity of custom in this\r\nway secured, giving scope for the gradual development of feudalism\r\naccording to the continental model. But the actual course of history\r\ndecided that the native kingdom of Wessex should survive, assert its\r\nsuperiority over the Scandinavian portion of the land, and yet be unable\r\nto achieve the conformity of its alien subjects to its own social\r\norganisation. Such at least is the conclusion suggested to us by the\r\nevidence of Domesday Book. Broadly speaking, Wessex and its border\r\nshires had presented in 1066 social phenomena which Norman lawyers were\r\nable to co-ordinate with the prevailing conditions of their native land.\r\nIn Wessex each village would probably belong to a single lord, its land\r\nwould fall into the familiar divisions of demesne and “terra\r\nvillanorum,” its men would owe labour service to their master. But\r\nbeyond the Warwick Avon and the Watling Street, the Normans encountered\r\nagrarian conditions which were evidently unfamiliar to them, and to\r\nwhich they could not easily apply the descriptive formula which so\r\nadmirably suited the social arrangements of the south. They had no\r\nprevious knowledge of wide tracts of land whose inhabitants knew no lord\r\nof lower rank than king, earl, or bishop; of villages which furnished a\r\nmeagre subsistence to five, eight, or ten manorial lords; of estates\r\nwhose owner could claim service from men whose dwellings were scattered\r\nover half a county. In twenty years the Normans, by conscious\r\nalterations, had done more to unify the social custom of England than\r\nhad been accomplished by the gradual processes of internal development\r\nin the previous century; but it was the social division, underlying the\r\nobvious political decentralisation of the country, which had sent down\r\nthe Old English state with a crash before the first attack of the\r\nNormans themselves.\r\n\r\nBut social evils of this kind do their work beneath the surface of a\r\nnation’s history, and it is the complete decentralisation of the Old\r\nEnglish commonwealth which first occurs to our minds when we wish to\r\nexplain the double conquest which the land sustained in the eleventh\r\ncentury; a decentralisation expressed in the creation of the vast\r\nearldoms which controlled the politics of England in the last years of\r\nits independence. The growth of these earldoms is in many respects\r\nobscure; to a limited extent they represent old kingdoms which had lost\r\ntheir independence, but in the main they are fortuitous agglomerations\r\nof territory, continually changing their shape as the intrigues of their\r\nholders or the political sense of the king of Wessex might from time to\r\ntime determine. From the narrative of the Danish war presented by the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, it seems certain that each county south of\r\nThames possessed an earl of its own in the ninth century; but this\r\narrangement appears to have been modified by Edward the Elder, and it\r\nhas been estimated that from the accession of Edward to the close of the\r\ntenth century Wessex and English Mercia were divided into a group of\r\nearldoms whose number never exceeded eight, a change which inevitably\r\nmagnified the importance of the individual earl. In the meantime,\r\nNorthumbria and the territory of the Five Boroughs were being ruled by\r\nmen of Scandinavian blood, who claimed the title of earl but are very\r\nrarely found in attendance at the courts of the King of Wessex.[6] In\r\nthe wars of Ethelred II. and Edmund Ironside with Swegen and Cnut, the\r\nissue of each campaign is decided by the attitude of such men as\r\nAelfric, ealdorman of Hampshire, or Eadric of Mercia, to whom it\r\nbelonged of right to lead the forces of their respected earldoms, and\r\nwho seem to have carried their troops from one side to the other without\r\nbeing influenced in the smallest degree by any tie of allegiance which\r\nwould bind them permanently to either the English or the Danish king. To\r\nCnut himself is commonly attributed a reorganisation of the earldoms, in\r\nwhich their number was temporarily reduced to four, and in which for the\r\nfirst time Wessex as a whole was placed on an equality with the other\r\nprovincial governments. The simplicity of this arrangement was soon\r\ndistorted by the occasional dismemberment of the West Saxon and Mercian\r\nearldoms, and by the creation of subordinate governments within their\r\nlimits; but throughout the reign of Edward the Confessor it is the earls\r\nof Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia, and Northumbria who direct the policy of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe privileges and powers inherent in the dignity of an earl were very\r\nconsiderable. We have already referred to his military authority, but he\r\nalso seems to have enjoyed a judicial prerogative overriding the\r\ncompetence of the local assemblies of the hundred. His wergild was\r\nseemingly fixed at a higher rate than that of the ordinary noble, and\r\nthe fine paid to him for a breach of his peace was half the amount which\r\nwould be paid to the king, and double the amount paid to the thegn on\r\naccount of a similar offence.[7] More important from the standpoint of\r\npolitics was the fact that in every shire certain lands seem to have\r\nbeen appurtenant to the comital office,[8] and these lands formed a\r\nterritorial nucleus around which an unscrupulous man like Godwine could\r\ngather the vast estates of which _Domesday_ reveals him to have been in\r\npossession. In practice, too, it was the earls who seem to have gained\r\nmore than any other men of rank by the growth of that system of\r\npatronage which has been described in a preceding paragraph; the natural\r\ninfluence of their position attracted to them the unattached free men of\r\ntheir spheres of government, and they became possessed of a body of\r\npersonal retainers who might be expected to fight for them at any crisis\r\nin their fortunes and who would not be unduly scrupulous as to the\r\ncauses of a quarrel in which they might be called upon to take part.\r\nFortified by such advantages, the earls were able at an early date to\r\nmake their dignities hereditary under all normal circumstances, and the\r\nattempt of Ethelred to nominate an earl of his own choice to Mercia in\r\nthe person of Eadric Streona, and of Edward the Confessor to displace\r\nthe house of Godwine in Wessex in 1051, led to disaster in each case,\r\nthough the occasion of the respective disasters was somewhat different.\r\n\r\nJust as the power of the great earls limited the executive freedom of\r\nthe monarchy, so in general matters of policy the king’s will was\r\ncircumscribed by the opinion of the body of his counsellors, his\r\nWitanagemot. Now and then a strong king might perhaps enforce the\r\nconformity of his witan to his personal wishes; but the majority of the\r\nlater Anglo-Saxon kings were not strong, and when, on rare occasions, we\r\nobtain a glimpse into the deliberations of the king and the wise men, it\r\nis the latter who decide the course of action which shall be pursued.[9]\r\nThat this was a serious evil cannot possibly be disputed. The political\r\nsupremacy of the Witanagemot bears no analogy to constitutional\r\ngovernment in the modern sense of the term: the witan were not\r\nresponsible to the nation; they were not, in fact, responsible to\r\nanybody, for a king who tried to insist on their obedience to his will\r\nmight find himself, like Ethelred II., deserted by his leading nobles at\r\nsome critical moment. Also, if we estimate the merit of a course of\r\npolicy by its results, we shall not be disposed to rate the wisdom of\r\nthe wise men very highly. In 1066 England was found with an obsolete\r\narmy, a financial system out of all relation to the facts on which it\r\nwas nominally based, and a social order lacking the prerequisites of\r\nstability and consistency; that the country had recently received a\r\ncomprehensive restatement of its ancient laws was due not to its wise\r\nmen, but to its Danish conqueror Cnut. The composition of the\r\nWitanagemot—a haphazard collection of earls, bishops, royal officials,\r\nand wealthy thegns—afforded no security that its leading spirits would\r\nbe men of integrity and intelligence; if it gave influence to men like\r\nDunstan and Earl Leofric of Mercia, men who were honestly anxious to\r\nfurther the national welfare, it gave equal influence to unscrupulous\r\npoliticians like Eadric Streona and Godwine of Wessex. The results of\r\ntwenty-five years of government by the Witanagemot would supply a\r\njustification, if one were needed, for the single-minded autocracy of\r\nthe Anglo-Norman kings.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Witanagemot, like that of so many departments\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon constitution, is beset by frequent difficulties; but\r\nit seems certain that the period following the middle of the tenth\r\ncentury witnessed a great extension of its actual influence. In part, no\r\ndoubt, this is due to the increasing power of its individual members, on\r\nwhich we have already commented in the case of the earls, but we\r\ncertainly should not fail to take into account the personal character of\r\nthe kings of England during this time. The last members of the royal\r\nhouse of Wessex are a feeble folk. Their physical weakness is\r\nillustrated less by the rapidity with which king succeeded king in the\r\ntenth century—for Edmund and Edward the Martyr perished by violence—than\r\nby the ominous childlessness of members of the royal house. Of the seven\r\nkings whose accession falls within the tenth century, four died without\r\noffspring. The average fertility of the royal house is somewhat raised\r\nby the enormous family of Ethelred the Unready; but fifty years after\r\nhis death his male line was solely represented by an old man and a boy,\r\nneither of whom was destined to leave issue. Nor do the kings of this\r\nperiod appear in a much more favourable light when judged by their\r\npolitical achievements. Edward the Elder, Athelstan, and Edmund make a\r\ncreditable group of sovereigns enough, though their success in the work\r\nthey had in hand, the incorporation of Scandinavian England into the\r\nkingdom of Wessex, was, as we have seen, extremely limited. Edred, the\r\nnext king, crippled as he was by some hopeless disease, made a brave\r\nattempt to assert the supremacy of Wessex over the midlands and north,\r\nbut Edwy his successor was a mere child, and under him the southern\r\nkingdom once more becomes bounded by the Thames and Bristol Avon. The\r\nreign of Edgar was undoubtedly regarded by the men of the next\r\ngeneration as a season of good law and governance, and the king himself\r\nis portrayed as a model prince by the monastic historians of the twelfth\r\ncentury; but on the one hand the long misery of Ethelred’s time of\r\nitself made men look back regretfully to Edgar’s twenty years of\r\ncomparative quiet, and also there can be no doubt that the king’s\r\nassociation with St. Dunstan gave him a specious advantage in the eyes\r\nof posterity.[10] Nothing in Edgar’s recorded actions entitles him to be\r\nregarded as a ruler of exceptional ability. The short reign of Edward\r\nthe Martyr is fully occupied by the struggle between the monastic party\r\nand its opponents, in which the young king cannot be said to play an\r\nindependent part at all, and the twenty years during which Ethelred II.\r\nmisconducted the affairs of England form a period which for sheer\r\nwretchedness probably has no equal in the national history. Had Ethelred\r\nbeen a ruler of some political capacity, his title of “the Unready,” in\r\nso far as it implies an unwillingness on his part to submit to the\r\ndictation of the Witanagemot, would be a most honourable mark of\r\ndistinction; but the series of inopportune acts[11] and futile\r\nexpedients which mark the exercise of his royal initiative were the\r\nimmediate causes of a national overthrow comparable only to the Norman\r\nconquest itself. With Edmund Ironside we reach a man who has deservedly\r\nwon for himself a place in the accepted list of English heroes and we\r\nmay admit his claim to be reckoned a bright exception to the prevailing\r\ndecadence of the West Saxon house, while at the same time we realise\r\nthat the circumstances of his stormy career left him no opportunity of\r\nshowing how far he was capable of grappling with the social and\r\npolitical evils which were the undoing of his country. And then, after\r\ntwenty-five years of Danish rule, the mysterious and strangely\r\nunattractive figure of Edward the Confessor closes the regnal line of\r\nhis ancient dynasty. Of Edward we shall have to speak at more length in\r\nthe sequel, noting here only the fact that under his ineffective rule\r\nall the centrifugal tendencies which we have considered received an\r\nacceleration which flung the Old English state into fragments before the\r\nfirst impact of the Norman chivalry.\r\n\r\nIt follows from all this that, according to whatever standard of\r\npolitical value we make our judgment, the England of the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries will be found utterly lacking in all qualities which\r\nmake a state strong and keep it efficient. The racial differences which\r\nexisted within the kingdom were stereotyped in its laws. The principles\r\nwhich underlay its social structure were inconsistent and incoherent. It\r\npossessed no administrative system worthy of the name and the executive\r\naction of its king was fettered by the independence of his counsellors\r\nand rendered ineffective by the practical autonomy of the provincial\r\ngovernments into which the land was divided. The ancient stock of its\r\nkings had long ceased to produce rulers capable of rectifying the\r\nprevailing disorganisation and was shortly to perish through the\r\nphysical sterility of its members. Nor were these political evils\r\ncounterbalanced by excellence in other fields of human activity. Great\r\nmovements were afoot in the rest of Europe. The Normans were\r\nrevolutionising the art of war. The Spanish kingdoms were trying their\r\nyoung strength in the first battles of the great crusade which fills\r\ntheir medieval history; in Italy the great conception of the church\r\npurified, and independent of the feudal world, was slowly drawing\r\ntowards its realisation. England has nothing of the kind to show; her\r\nisolation from the current of continental life was almost complete, and\r\nthe great Danish struggle of the ninth century had proved to be the last\r\nwork undertaken by independent England for the cause of European\r\ncivilisation. In Alfred, the protagonist of that struggle, the royal\r\nhouse of Wessex had given birth to a national hero, but no one had\r\ncompleted the task which he left unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nOn turning from the history of England between 950 and 1050 to that of\r\nNormandy during the same period, one is conscious at once of passing\r\nfrom decadence to growth; and this although the growth of the Norman\r\nstate was accompanied by an infinity of disorder and oppression, and the\r\ndecadence of England was relieved by occasional manifestations of the\r\nolder and more heroic spirit of the race. Nothing is more wonderful in\r\nNorman history than the rapidity with which the pirates’ land became\r\ntransformed into a foremost member of the feudal world of France, and\r\nthe extraordinary rapidity of the process seems all the more remarkable\r\nfrom the sparseness of our information with regard to it. The story of\r\nthe making of Normandy, as told by the Norman historians, is so infected\r\nwith myth that its barest outlines can scarcely now be recovered. We\r\ncan, however, see that during the ninth century the north and west\r\ncoasts of France had been subjected to an incessant Scandinavian attack\r\nsimilar in character to the contemporary descents which the Northmen\r\nwere making upon England. It is also certain that the settlement of what\r\nis now Normandy did not begin until thirty or forty years after the\r\nconquest of the English Danelaw, and that for a considerable, if\r\nindefinite, term of years new swarms of Northmen were continually\r\nstreaming up the valleys which debouch on the Channel seaboard. Of\r\nRollo, the traditional founder of the Norman state, nothing is\r\ndefinitely known. The country from which he derives his origin is quite\r\nuncertain. Norwegian sagamen claimed him for one of their own race, the\r\nNormans considered him to be a Dane, and a plausible case has been made\r\nout for referring him to Sweden.[12] His followers were no doubt\r\nrecruited from the whole of the Scandinavian north, but it is probable\r\nthat the great mass of the original settlers of Normandy were of Danish\r\norigin, and therefore closely akin to the men who in the previous\r\ncentury had found a home in the valleys of the Yorkshire Ouse and Trent.\r\nAs in the case of Guthrum in East Anglia the conquests of Rollo were\r\ndefined by a treaty made between the invading chief and the native\r\npotentate of greatest consequence; and the agreement known in history as\r\nthe treaty of Claire sur Epte is the beginning of Norman history. Great\r\nobscurity overhangs the terms of this settlement, and we cannot define\r\nwith any approach to certainty the extent of territory ceded by it to\r\nthe Northmen.[13] On the east it is probable that the boundary line ran\r\nup the Epte, thence to the Bresle, and so down that stream to the port\r\nof Eu; but the extension of the original Normandy towards the west is\r\nvery uncertain, and with regard to its southern frontier there was still\r\nroom in the eleventh century for border disputes in which William the\r\nConqueror became engaged at an early date. The succeeding history,\r\nhowever, proves clearly enough that the Bessin, Cotentin, and Avranchin\r\nformed no parts of Normandy as delimited at Claire sur Epte, and it was\r\nin this last quarter, peopled by an influx of later immigrants, that the\r\nScandinavian element in the duchy presented the most obstinate\r\nresistance to Romance influences.\r\n\r\nThe prince with whom Rollo had concluded this memorable treaty was\r\nCharles III., king of the West Franks, and the reputed descendant of\r\nCharlemagne. The importance of the settlement of Claire sur Epte lay in\r\nthe future, and in its immediate significance it was little more than an\r\nepisode in a struggle which had been carried on for nearly half a\r\ncentury between the Carolingian sovereign and the powerful house of the\r\ncounts of Paris, of which the head at this time was Robert, the\r\ngrandfather of Hugh Capet. The conquests of Rollo had been made at the\r\nexpense of Count Robert, and Charles III. in his session of Normandy,\r\nlike Alfred in the treaty of Wedmore, was abandoning to an invading host\r\na district which had never been under his immediate rule. It was certain\r\nthat the counts of Paris would sooner or later attempt to recover the\r\nvalley of the lower Seine, and this fact produced an alliance between\r\nthe first two dukes of Normandy and their Carolingian overlords which\r\nlasted for twenty years. The exact nature of the legal tie which united\r\nthe earliest dukes of Normandy to the king of France is a disputed\r\nquestion, but we may well doubt whether Rollo had done more than commend\r\nhimself personally to Charles III., and it is not even certain that the\r\nViking leader had received baptism at the time when he performed the act\r\nof homage. As a final question which still awaits settlement, we may\r\nnote that the date of the treaty of Claire sur Epte is itself uncertain,\r\nbut that 921 seems the year to which with most probability it may be\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, the conclusion of this settlement must have been the last\r\nevent of importance in the reign of Charles III., for in 922 he was\r\noverthrown by his enemy Robert of Paris, and spent the remaining eight\r\nyears of his life in prison. Robert thereupon assumed the title of king,\r\nbut was killed in 923; and the crown passed to Rudolph of Burgundy, who\r\nheld it until 936. On his death the royal title was offered to Hugh,\r\nsurnamed the Great, count of Paris, but he preferred to restore the\r\nCarolingian line, rather than to draw upon himself the enemity of all\r\nhis fellow-nobles by accepting the precarious throne himself. Charles\r\nIII. had married Eadgifu, one of the many daughters of Edward the Elder\r\nof Wessex, and Louis the Carolingian heir was residing at Athelstan’s\r\ncourt when Hugh of Paris called on him to accept his inheritance. The\r\nrefusal of Hugh the Great to accept the crown did not materially improve\r\nthe relations existing between the Carolingian house and the Parisian\r\ncounty, and Louis “from beyond the sea” found it expedient to maintain\r\nthe alliance which his father had founded with the Norman lords of\r\nRouen. But, long before the accession of Louis d’Outremer, Rollo the old\r\npirate had died, and William Longsword, his son, felt himself less\r\nvitally dependent on the support of the king of the Franks. In the\r\nconfused politics of the period William was able to assert a freedom in\r\nmaking and breaking treaties and in levying external war no less\r\ncomplete than that which was enjoyed by the other princes of France. In\r\ngeneral he remained true to the Carolingian friendship; and at the close\r\nof his reign Normandy and the French monarchy were jointly opposed to\r\nthe Robertian house, leagued with the counties of Vermandois and\r\nFlanders. The latter county, in particular, was directly threatened by\r\nthe growth of a powerful state within striking distance of her southern\r\nborders; and in 943 William Longsword was murdered by Arnulf of\r\nFlanders, the grandson of Alfred of England.\r\n\r\nWe should naturally wish to know in what way the foundation of Normandy\r\nwas regarded by the contemporary rulers of England. It is generally\r\nassumed, and the assumption is reasonable enough, that Athelstan feared\r\nthe assistance which the Normans might give to the men of the Danelaw,\r\nand that he endeavoured to anticipate any movement on the part of the\r\nformer by forming a series of marriage alliances with powers capable of\r\nforcing Normandy to remain on the defensive. It is probable that\r\nAthelstan’s sister Eadhild married Hugh the Great,[14] the natural enemy\r\nof William Longsword, and we know that Athelstan lent his support to\r\nAlan Barbetorte, who at this time was struggling with indifferent\r\nsuccess to preserve Brittany from being overrun by Norman invaders. On\r\nthe other hand, it would be easy to exaggerate the solidarity of feeling\r\nwhich existed between the Northmen in Normandy and in England; nor do\r\nour authorities countenance the belief that the various continental\r\nmarriages of Athelstan’s sisters formed part of any consistent scheme of\r\npolicy. There is no evidence that direct political intercourse existed\r\nat any time between Athelstan and William Longsword; although we know\r\nthat the Englishmen who were appointed by the king to negotiate for the\r\nreception of Louis d’Outremer in France paid a visit to the court of\r\nRouen.\r\n\r\nThe murder of William Longsword was followed by the first of the two\r\nminorities which occur in Norman history, for Richard the illegitimate\r\nheir of the late duke was only a child of ten on his father’s death. The\r\nopportunity was too good to be missed, and Louis d’Outremer succeeded\r\nfor a brief period in making himself master of Normandy, not improbably\r\nasserting as a pretext for his intervention a claim to the guardianship\r\nof the young duke. Whatever its legal foundation Louis’s action outraged\r\nthe political individuality of the duchy, and when Richard came to years\r\nof discretion he abandoned the traditional Carolingian friendship and\r\nattached himself to the Robertian house. He commended himself to Hugh\r\nthe Great, and thus began a friendship between the lords of Paris and\r\ntheir Norman neighbours which continued for nearly a century and was not\r\nthe least among the causes which enabled the Robertian house in 987 to\r\ncrown its existing pre-eminence with the royal title. The reign of\r\nRichard I. lasted for more than fifty years, and the history of Normandy\r\nduring this period is extremely obscure, but there can be no question\r\nthat it witnessed the gradual consolidation of the duchy, and its no\r\nless gradual absorption into the political system of France.\r\n\r\nThe seventh year of the reign of Richard II. was marked by an event of\r\nthe first importance for the history of both England and Normandy—the\r\nmarriage of Ethelred II. and Emma the duke’s sister. England was at the\r\ntime in the very centre of the great Danish war which marks the close of\r\nthe tenth and the beginning of the eleventh century, and it is\r\ndistinctly possible that the match may have been prompted by a desire on\r\nEthelred’s part to close the Norman harbours to his enemies’ ships. But,\r\napart from all dubious attributions of political motive, the importance\r\nof the marriage lies in the fact that Normandy remains thenceforward a\r\npermanent factor in English politics. The marriage must have produced an\r\nimmediate immigration of Normans into England; so early as 1003 we find\r\na French reeve of Queen Emma in charge of the city of Exeter. The mere\r\nunion of the dynasties—the marriage of the representative of the ancient\r\nand decadent royal house of Wessex to the great-granddaughter of the\r\npirate chief Rollo—was alone a sufficiently striking event. But by\r\nchance it happened that the strain of Norman blood in the offspring of\r\nthe marriage came of itself to produce political results of the gravest\r\nconsequence. No one in 1002 could foresee that the new queen would bear\r\na son whose early life would be passed in exile in his mother’s land,\r\nand who would return thence to his father’s inheritance saturated with\r\nNorman ideas of the art of government; still less could anyone foresee\r\nthat in virtue of this marriage a Norman duke would one day claim the\r\nthrone of England by right of inheritance. But less striking results of\r\nthe new alliance would soon enough become apparent. The ubiquitous\r\nNorman trader would become a more frequent visitor to the English ports,\r\nand Normandy would at once become a friendly land to Englishmen crossing\r\nthe Channel for purposes of trade or pilgrimage. Nor should the marriage\r\nbe considered exclusively from the English standpoint. The reception of\r\na Norman princess as queen of England proved at least that the Norman\r\nduke was no longer a barbarian intruder among the higher nobility of\r\nFrance; he might not be a sovereign prince as yet, but he was certainly\r\na ruler of greater consequence beyond the borders of the French kingdom\r\nthan were any of his fellow-vassals of the French crown. It is true that\r\nthe alliance of 1002 marks no immediate change in the French relations\r\nof the duke of Normandy; his energies were still confined to the petty\r\nstruggles which he, like his father and grandfather, carried on with\r\nvarying success against this neighbour or that. But events were soon to\r\nprove how strong a state had really been created in Normandy by the\r\nobscure dukes of the tenth century, and the marriage of Ethelred and\r\nEmma pointed to the quarter in which the strength of Normandy would find\r\nits field at last.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that we can only describe the internal condition of\r\nNormandy, as it existed at the beginning of the eleventh century, in\r\nvery general terms. Normandy, like the rest of the French kingdom, was\r\npassing through a phase in which the legislative power of the sovereign\r\nwas in abeyance; and in default of written laws we can only rely upon\r\nthe incidental information afforded by legal documents or by the casual\r\nexpressions of later chroniclers.[15] But the main features of Norman\r\nfeudalism at this time are fairly certain, and sufficient to point a\r\ncontrast with the contemporary constitution of England in almost every\r\nparticular in which the details of the two systems are known to us.[15]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, vassalage had become localised in Normandy. The\r\nrelationship between lord and man would in most cases imply that the\r\nlatter held his land of the former. So far as we can tell, the course of\r\nNorman feudalism started from a point of departure different from that\r\nwith which the English system takes its origin. The history of the terms\r\nemployed to designate dependent tenure seems to make this clear. At an\r\nearly date a great man’s vassal will hold of him a _precarium_; he will\r\nbe a tenant at will, his tenure will be revocable at his lord’s\r\ninstance. To the _precarium_ succeeds the _beneficium_; a term which\r\nsufficiently expresses the fact that the tenant’s rights over his land\r\nare derivable from his lord, although it does not, like the older word,\r\nimply their temporary character. In the meantime, the hereditary\r\nprinciple in regard to dependent tenure is continually securing a wider\r\nextension, and the _feudum_, the fee, the term which ultimately\r\nsupplanted the _precarium_ and _beneficium_, denotes an estate which\r\nwill in the normal course of things descend to a tenant’s heir. Some\r\nsuch succession of ideas can distinctly be traced in the Frankish\r\nkingdom, and the Anglo-Saxon land books here and there contain words and\r\nphrases which suggest that the English land law would have followed a\r\nsimilar development, had it not been arrested by the general dislocation\r\nof society occasioned by the wars of the ninth century. The wide estates\r\nwith which the newly converted kings of Wessex, the Hwicce and the\r\nMiddle Angles, endowed the churches founded in their dominions afforded\r\nan excellent field for the growth of dependent tenure, which was not\r\nneglected by thegn and free man, anxious to participate in the wealth of\r\nthe saints by virtue of discharging military obligations which monks and\r\nclerks could not perform in person. But the Danish wars stripped the\r\neastern churches of their possessions and peopled the eastern counties\r\nwith settlers of approximately equal rank; and when in the century\r\nbefore the Norman Conquest the land loan reproduces many of the features\r\nof the continental _precarium_, it appears as an exotic institution\r\nrather than as a normal development of previous tenurial custom. It\r\nwould be very easy to exaggerate the distinction which exists between\r\nEngland and Normandy in this matter; the mass of our contemporary\r\ninformation about Old English land tenure relates to ecclesiastical\r\nestates; but with _Domesday Book_ before us we cannot doubt that the\r\ndistinction was very real and of deep importance in connection with the\r\nother divergent features of the Anglo-Saxon social organisation.\r\n\r\nEverything, then, seems to show that, for at least a hundred years\r\nbefore 1086, dependent tenure and the hereditary descent of fiefs had\r\nbeen recognised features of the land system of Normandy. We also know\r\nthat these principles had, long before the conquest of England, produced\r\ntheir corollaries in the rights of wardship, marriage, and relief, which\r\na lord would enjoy upon occasion with reference to his vassals.[16]\r\nWomen were capable of inheriting land and Norman custom allowed at least\r\nto the duke the privilege of choosing a husband for his female vassal.\r\nThe rights of assuming the guardianship of a minor’s land, and of\r\nreceiving a money payment upon the succession of a new heir, were\r\nobvious developments of the originally precarious character of the fief,\r\nand we shall see that King Henry of France exercised the former right\r\nover Normandy itself upon the death of Duke Robert in 1035. There does\r\nnot seem to be any direct evidence for the existence of the relief as a\r\nNorman custom before 1066, but its appearance in England immediately\r\nafter the Conquest is sufficient proof of its previous recognition by\r\nthe feudal law of Normandy. None of these customs, so far as we can\r\ntell, had found a place in the social system of independent England.\r\n\r\nPrivate jurisdiction was undoubtedly an essential feature of Norman\r\nfeudalism, though we may well doubt whether the principles on which it\r\nwas based had ever been defined by Norman lawyers. It is also clear that\r\nthe duke possessed upon occasion the power of overruling the judgment of\r\nhis barons, and that his exercise of this power was applauded by all who\r\nwere interested in the welfare of the humbler classes of society. The\r\nmilitary character of feudalism made it imperative that there should be\r\nsome power in the land capable of vindicating right by force, and the\r\nstronger dukes of Normandy were not slow in the assertion of their\r\njudicial supremacy. How far the ubiquitous manorial court of Norman\r\nEngland represents an imitation of continental practice, and how far it\r\nis referable to the “sake and soke” possessed by Anglo-Saxon thegns, is\r\na difficult question, and the explanation given by the legal writers of\r\nthe generation succeeding the Conquest must be reserved for a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, clear, that one custom which to modern ideas would be\r\nruinous to any social order distinguishes Norman life from that of\r\nEngland in the eleventh century. Private war was a recognised custom in\r\nNormandy. For obvious reasons this custom was fenced round with\r\nstringent regulations; the duke’s license was necessary before a\r\ncampaign could be opened and its conduct was subject to his general\r\nsupervision. But private war is separated by no certain barrier from\r\nanarchy, and under a weak duke or during a minority the barons of\r\nNormandy would take the law into their own hands. Herein lay the real\r\ncause of the disorders which prevailed during the minority of William\r\nthe Conqueror; and in the abeyance of state intervention the church\r\nendeavoured with considerable success to confine the practice within\r\nreasonable limits. The Truce of God, in the limitations which it\r\nenforced upon the operations of war, made life more tolerable for\r\npeasant and burgess, but it was at best an inefficient substitute for\r\nthe hand of a strong ruler. William the Conqueror made good peace in\r\nNormandy, as well as in England, and we may well doubt whether even\r\nprivate war, so long as its legal sanctions were respected, was not less\r\nharmful to the well-being of a community than were the savage outbreaks\r\nof internal strife which from time to time occurred under the helpless\r\ngovernment of Edward the Confessor.\r\n\r\nThe exact nature of the feudal tie which bound the duke of Normandy to\r\nthe king of France is a very difficult question.[17] It undoubtedly\r\ncomprised all those obligations which were implied in the performance of\r\nthe act of homage, but these would vary indefinitely in stringency\r\naccording to the status of the parties concerned. An oath of fealty and\r\nservice was certain to be kept only so long as the man to whom the oath\r\nwas sworn could compel its observance by the threat of confiscation.\r\nWhen made between two parties who were for effective purposes equal in\r\npower, there was no certainty that the oath would imply more than an\r\nassertion of dependence on the part of the man who swore. On the other\r\nhand, it would be an error to regard the homage which a duke of Normandy\r\npaid to his overlord merely as a ceremonial form. Even in the early\r\nfeudal times the sense of personal honour would generally serve to\r\nprevent a man from wantonly attacking his lord. William the Conqueror,\r\nwhenever possible, refrained from violating the fealty which he had\r\nsworn to King Henry; and if put on his defence for his conduct at\r\nVaraville, he would probably have pleaded that the necessity of\r\nself-preservation outweighed all other considerations. But in earlier\r\ntimes the maintenance of feudal relations between Normandy and France\r\nwas less dependent upon the personal loyalty of the reigning duke.\r\nOccasionally, the king of France will confirm the grants of land with\r\nwhich the duke of Normandy endowed some religious house; he may, as we\r\nhave seen, claim the right of wardship over a duchy during a minority.\r\nAlso, it should not be forgotten that in the case of the dukes between\r\nRichard I. and Robert I. the traditional alliance between Normandy and\r\nthe Capetian dynasty disguised the practical autonomy of the former. So\r\nlong as the knights of Normandy were at the disposal of the king of\r\nFrance for an attack upon Flanders or Blois, the king would not be\r\nconcerned to argue the question whether they were furnished to him in\r\nobedience to his claim to feudal service, or merely in pursuance of the\r\nterritorial interests of his vassal.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of his territory, the duke of the Normans enjoyed an\r\nalmost absolute sovereignty. The external limitation of his\r\nauthority—the suzerainty of the king of France—was at its strongest very\r\nineffectual, and within the duchy the barons were to an exceptional\r\ndegree subject to the ducal power. All the members of the Norman\r\nbaronage stood very much on a level in regard to the extent of their\r\nfiefs, and the political influence which any individual baron might from\r\ntime to time exercise depended mainly on his personal favour with the\r\nduke. Here and there among the mass of the Norman nobility we meet with\r\na family claiming a more ancient origin and a purer descent than that of\r\nthe ducal house, and disposed towards insurrection thereby; but such\r\ncases are highly exceptional, and the names which are of most\r\nsignificance in the history of William the Conqueror are those of men\r\nwho held official positions at his court, or were personally related to\r\nhis line. In Normandy there were no baronies of the first rank, and the\r\nnumber of counties was small; also most of them, by the policy of dukes\r\nRichard I. and II., had been granted on appanages to junior members of\r\nthe reigning family. One striking exception to the territorial\r\nsignificance of the Norman baronage existed in the great fief of\r\nBellême, which lay on the border between Normandy and Maine, and was\r\nregarded as dependent on the French crown.[18] The lords of Bellême in\r\nearly times are certainly found behaving as sovereign princes, but it\r\nfortunately happened that the male line of the family became extinct\r\nduring William’s reign, and a standing obstacle to the centralisation of\r\nthe duchy was removed when Mabel, the heiress of this formidable house,\r\ncarried its vast possessions to her husband, the duke’s loyal friend,\r\nRoger de Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical, like the lay, baronage of Normandy had no members\r\nfitted by their territorial influence to lead an opposition to the ducal\r\npower. The greater abbeys of Normandy, Fécamp, St. Wandrille, Jumièges,\r\nhad been founded or refounded by the dukes themselves, and the\r\nrestoration of the western bishoprics had mainly been the pious work of\r\nRichard I. The re-establishment of the Norman episcopate after the\r\ndisorder of the settlement could never have been effected had it not\r\nbeen for the countenance afforded to the movement by successive dukes,\r\nand the connection between church and state in Normandy was peculiarly\r\nintimate. The rights of patronage, elsewhere jealously guarded by the\r\nking of the French, in Normandy belonged to the duke, and his power of\r\nnominating the official leaders of the church enabled him to govern the\r\nwhole ecclesiastical policy of the land. Naturally, there occur from\r\ntime to time gross instances of nepotism, as when Odo, Duke William’s\r\nbrother, was thrust into the see of Bayeux at the age of ten; but in\r\ngeneral the dukes of Normandy were at pains to select worthy candidates\r\nfor bishoprics and abbeys, and in 1066 the spiritual quality of the\r\nNorman episcopate was extraordinarily high. Over the independent\r\necclesiastical jurisdiction which had arisen in the duchy under the\r\ninfluence of the great Cluniac movement the duke kept a steady control;\r\nwhen in England the Conqueror is found insisting that no ecclesiastical\r\nlaw shall be introduced into the country without his sanction, he was\r\nbut asserting a principle which had governed his conduct in regard to\r\nthose matters in Normandy.\r\n\r\nThis intimate connection of church and state had, even before the\r\naccession of William, produced a powerful indirect result upon the\r\necclesiastical culture of Normandy. In Normandy, as in England, the\r\nDanish wars of the previous century had been fatal to the monastic life\r\nof the districts affected, and with monasticism perished such elements\r\nof literary culture as the Carolingian age could show. It was nearly a\r\ncentury after the treaty of Claire-sur-Epte before monasticism revived\r\nin Normandy, and this revival was due almost entirely to the importation\r\nof foreign monks into the duchy under the patronage of Richard II. and\r\nhis successors. In connection with the newly founded monasteries there\r\narose schools, some of which in a surprisingly short time rivalled the\r\nolder institutions of Chartres and Tours, and participated to the full\r\nin the cosmopolitan culture which underlay the development of medieval\r\nscholasticism. Of these schools, the most famous was undoubtedly that of\r\nBec, the rise of which well illustrates the character of the revival of\r\nlearning in Normandy.[19] The abbey of Bec itself was only a recent\r\ninstitution, having been founded in 1034 by an unlettered knight, named\r\nHerlwin, who was desirous of living a monastic life in association with\r\na few chosen companions. Nothing in any way distinguished Bec from half\r\na dozen other abbeys founded during the same decade, and the house owes\r\nits unique distinction to the circumstance that in 1042 an able young\r\nItalian jurist and grammarian, Lanfranc of Pavia, undertook the\r\ndirection of its school. As a logical and speculative theologian\r\nLanfranc is said to display small original ability, but no one was\r\nbetter fitted than he by nature to superintend the early development of\r\nan institution to which we may conveniently, if inaccurately, apply the\r\ndesignation of a university. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the\r\nreputation of the individual teacher was a matter of much greater\r\nimportance than were the traditions of the school which he taught, and\r\nthe school of Bec, under Lanfranc’s guidance, rapidly became the\r\neducation centre of eastern Normandy. Its fame was vastly increased by\r\nthe fact that its leader became involved in a theological controversy in\r\nwhich the whole of the Catholic Church was interested. A famous\r\ntheologian, Berengar, a teacher in the school of Tours, had taken upon\r\nhimself the task of controverting the received opinion as to the nature\r\nof the Eucharist, and Lanfranc stepped forward as the leading\r\ncontroversialist on the conservative side. In the dialectical struggle\r\nwhich followed, the honours of debate fell to Lanfranc; Berengar’s\r\nopinions were condemned both by a provincial synod under Archbishop\r\nMaurilius, of Rouen, and also by a general council held at Rome in 1056,\r\nand Lanfranc, to the men of his time, appeared to be the foremost\r\ntheologian in Normandy. But wider duties than the charge of the school\r\nof Bec rapidly devolved upon him as the friend and intimate counsellor\r\nof the duke, and on his translation to the newly founded abbey of St.\r\nStephen’s, at Caen, his place was taken by a man of greater subtlety of\r\nmind if no less administrative capacity. The career of Anselm of Aosta,\r\nwho succeeded Lanfranc in the priorate of Bec, raises issues which lie\r\nbeyond the life and reign of William the Conqueror, but reference should\r\ncertainly be made to the educational work which Anselm performed in the\r\ndays before his name was famous as the champion of Hildebrandine ideas\r\nin the ecclesiastical polity of England. As a teacher, it is probable\r\nthat Anselm had no rival among the men of his time, and if his\r\neducational efforts were solely directed at the production of learned\r\nand zealous monks, this does not in the least detract from the greatness\r\nof the work to which the prime of his life was devoted. It is under\r\nAnselm, rather than under Lanfranc, that the influence of the school of\r\nBec reaches its height, and the gentle character and deep philosophical\r\ninsight of the monk from Aosta supply a pleasant contrast to the\r\npractical and at times unscrupulous activity of his predecessor at Bec\r\nand Canterbury.\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that we possess very little information as to the\r\ncauses which towards the close of the tenth century led to a revival of\r\nthe Scandinavian raids upon England. No consistent tradition upon this\r\nmatter was preserved in the north, and the first descent of the Vikings\r\nupon England in 981 provokes no especial comment from the native\r\nchroniclers who have recorded it. Now, as in the previous century, the\r\nDanes had the command of the sea, and the settlements of the\r\nninth-century Vikings in the east of England offered to their\r\ndescendants an excellent base of operations in the heart of the realm.\r\nFor the first ten or twelve years after 980 the Danish and Norse raiders\r\ncontented themselves with plunder and tribute, and the definite conquest\r\nof England was not achieved before 1013, when Swegen Forkbeard, king of\r\nDenmark, expelled Ethelred from his kingdom and enjoyed a few months’\r\nuncontested reign as the uncrowned king of the land. The English\r\nreaction under Edmund Ironside is a brief although brilliant episode in\r\nthe war, but the superior numbers of the enemy told in the end, and from\r\n1016 to 1042 England remained politically united to the Scandinavian\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe rule of Cnut, Swegen’s son, met with no opposition on the part of\r\nhis English subjects. But although Cnut ruled England with such\r\nstrictness and justice that on the eve of the Norman Conquest his reign\r\nwas still regarded as a model of good government, his rule was\r\nnevertheless that of a Scandinavian king.[20] All the surviving sons of\r\nEthelred met with death or banishment at his hands, and his marriage\r\nwith Ethelred’s widow was much more probably the result of passion than\r\nof policy. In the personnel of the local government of England his reign\r\nwitnessed a complete change. His earldoms were given either to the\r\ncompanions of his early warfare, such as Eric of Northumbria[21] and his\r\nson Hakon of Worcestershire, or to new men, such as Godwine of Wessex,\r\nwhom he had raised from insignificance and could depose at pleasure. So\r\nfar as we know only one native family of ancient rank received favour\r\nfrom the foreign king. The earldom of Mercia, which had been left vacant\r\nby the summary execution of Eadric Streona early in 1017, was given to\r\nLeofwine, a representative of a noble midland family and the father of\r\nthe more famous Leofric, the wisest of the counsellors of Edward the\r\nConfessor. Such Englishmen as received secular promotion at Cnut’s hand\r\nreceived it for the most part in Scandinavia, where the honour which\r\nthey enjoyed had apparently become a cause of discontent to the Danes\r\nbefore Cnut’s death. In general policy also Cnut’s attention was\r\ndirected towards the north rather than towards the Romance lands, with\r\nwhich Ethelred’s marriage had brought England into contact. It is very\r\nprobable that Cnut dreamed of an empire which should include England and\r\nthe whole of Scandinavia, and it is certain that in 1028 he conquered\r\nNorway and claimed the submission of the king of Sweden. In all this\r\nCnut was behaving as the heir of Harold Blue-tooth and Swegen Forkbeard,\r\nrather than as the successor of Edgar and Ethelred. His rule brought\r\npeace to England and Englishmen needed no more to induce them to submit\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nIn the machinery of the English government, it does not appear that\r\nCnut’s reign marks any changes of importance. He governed England, as he\r\ngoverned Norway, through viceroys; and if his earls bear more the\r\ncharacter of royal officials than did Ethelred’s ealdormen, this was due\r\nrather to Cnut’s superior power than to any fundamental change in the\r\ncharacter of their positions. Under Edward the Confessor the provincial\r\ngovernments became again as autonomous as ever. It was a matter of great\r\nimportance that Cnut ordered the compilation of a general code of the\r\nlaw current at this time, a work which may be held to earn for him the\r\ntitle of the greatest legislator of the eleventh century.[22] When the\r\nbattle of Hastings was fought, Cnut’s code was still the newest and most\r\nexplicit statement of Old English custom, and the additions which the\r\nConqueror made to it were few and for the most part of minor importance.\r\n\r\nCnut’s death was followed by the immediate disruption of his empire.\r\nNorway passed to Swegen, his eldest son; and on his death after a brief\r\nand troubled reign was rapidly conquered by Magnus, the son of Cnut’s\r\nNorwegian rival Olaf the Holy. Denmark was taken by Harthacnut, a son of\r\nCnut and Emma of Normandy, and Harold, the third surviving brother,\r\nsecured England and held it for five years. His short reign was marked\r\nby a dramatic event which is of importance as furnishing one of the\r\nostensible motives assigned by the Conqueror’s apologists for his\r\ninvasion of England. In 1036 the Etheling Alfred, son of Ethelred and\r\nEmma, left his secure exile in Normandy and came to England. His object,\r\nwe are told, was to visit his mother, the lady Emma, and to take council\r\nwith her how he might best endeavour to gain the kingdom for himself. He\r\ntherefore landed with but few companions, and before he had seen his\r\nmother he was met by Godwine, the Earl of Wessex, who received him\r\npeaceably and entertained him with lavish hospitality at Guildford.\r\nThereupon Godwine’s name vanishes from the story, but the same night the\r\netheling and his party were surrounded by King Harold’s men and taken\r\nprisoners; Alfred was so horribly blinded that he soon died from his\r\ninjuries, and his companions were mutilated, imprisoned, or sold as\r\nslaves according to the king’s fancy. The whole affair was clearly the\r\nresult of foul treachery and it is impossible to doubt that the surprise\r\nat Guildford was Godwine’s work.[23] The traitorous earl, indeed,\r\nskilfully evaded the penalty of his crime, but when William of Normandy\r\nwas about to cross the sea, he was careful to appear as the avenger of\r\nthe wrongs which his cousin had suffered thirty years before.\r\n\r\nAt some time between the death of Cnut in 1035 and the death of Harold\r\nI. in 1040, the latter’s brother Harthacnut, as king of Denmark, had\r\nmade a treaty with Magnus of Norway which served as the pretext for\r\ntwenty years of war between the two states, and as the foundation of the\r\nNorwegian claims on England which were asserted by Harold Hardrada in\r\nthe campaign which ended at Stamfordbridge. The secession of Norway\r\nunder Magnus from the Danish connection was not likely to pass\r\nuncontested, and the host of both nations prepared to try the matter in\r\na great battle at the Elf in the winter following Magnus’s succession.\r\nOn both sides, however, there was a strong party in favour of peace, and\r\na compromise was arranged by which the kings swore brotherhood and\r\npromised that in the event of either dying without a son to succeed him\r\nhis dominions should pass to the survivor or his heir.[24] The\r\nsuccession of Harthacnut to England in 1040 took place without protest\r\nfrom Magnus, but on the former’s childless death in 1042 the treaty\r\nshould have come into operation, and Magnus was careful to claim the\r\ncrown of England from Edward the Confessor. Edward denied the Norwegian\r\nking’s right, and he was so strongly supported by the leading men of the\r\nland that Magnus deemed it best to let him reign in peace, but the claim\r\nwas undoubtedly present to the mind of Magnus’s heir, Harold Hardrada,\r\nwhen he started on his memorable expedition in 1066,[25] and it accounts\r\nfor the alarm which noblemen of Scandinavian tendencies were able to\r\narouse in England during the earliest years of Edward’s rule.\r\n\r\nThe man who had played the leading part in the events which led to the\r\nacceptance of Edward as king of England, was undoubtedly Earl Godwine;\r\nand the chief interest of Edward’s reign lies in the varying fortunes of\r\nthe family of which Godwine was the founder. With notable skill the earl\r\nused the influence which he possessed as King Edward’s protector to\r\nfurther the territorial interests of his family, and within three years\r\nof Edward’s accession Godwine and his sons were in possession of a belt\r\nof earldoms which extended without a break along the south coast of\r\nEngland, from the Wash to the Bristol Channel. By 1050 the whole of\r\nEngland was divided between Godwine and his two eldest sons, Swegen and\r\nHarold, Leofric of Mercia, Siward of Northumbria, and Ralf of Mantes, a\r\nnephew of King Edward, who had received from his uncle the earldom of\r\nHereford, and was making of that distant shire an outpost of Norman\r\ninfluence already before the middle of the century.\r\n\r\nIn 1051 the power of the house of Godwine was suddenly overthrown for a\r\ntime by an unexpected revolution. The immediate cause of the catastrophe\r\nwas very trivial, but there can be little doubt that it was really due\r\nto the jealousy which the king felt at the inordinate power possessed by\r\nthe Earl of Wessex. Godwine in 1042 had played the part of a king-maker;\r\nbut, like other king-makers, he found that the sovereign whom he had\r\ncreated began to resent his influence. In the summer of 1051 Count\r\nEustace of Boulogne, who had married King Edward’s sister, paid a visit\r\nto his brother-in-law, and on his return prepared to cross the Channel\r\nfrom Dover to the capital of his own country. Arrived at Dover, Eustace\r\ndemanded from the citizens entertainment for himself and his suite; a\r\ndemand which was seemingly quite in accordance with the custom by which\r\nthe inhabitants of a town in the eleventh century were liable to find\r\nquarters for the retinue of a king, or for persons whom the king might\r\nsend down to them.[26] On the present occasion, however, the men of\r\nDover showed signs of disallowing the custom, and a fight ensued in the\r\nstreets of the town, in which each side lost some twenty men. Eustace\r\nimmediately returned to the king’s court, and demanded the punishment of\r\nthe citizens, which was granted to him, and its execution entrusted to\r\nGodwine, within whose earldom Dover lay. The earl flatly refused to\r\ncarry out the king’s orders, whether through a magnanimous objection to\r\nthe justice of the sentence or through fear of incurring local\r\nunpopularity by enforcing it. Thereupon, Edward for once asserted his\r\nroyal independence, and events proved that for the moment at least he\r\nhad reserves of strength upon which Godwine and his party cannot have\r\ncounted. The king summoned a meeting of the Witanagemot to be held at\r\nGloucester, at which, among other charges, Godwine was to be accused of\r\ncomplicity in the death of Alfred the Etheling, fifteen years before.\r\nGodwine refused to stand his trial, and proceeded to collect troops from\r\nall the family earldoms, a move which was discovered by a similar levy\r\nmade on the king’s behalf by the earls of Hereford, Mercia, and\r\nNorthumbria. Civil war was averted by the moderation of the chiefs of\r\nthe king’s party, who arranged a postponement of the charges against\r\nGodwine until the next Michaelmas, when a gemot was to be held in London\r\nfor their discussion. Godwine agreed to this; and, that he might not be\r\ntaken unawares, he moved from the west country to Southwark, where he\r\ntook up his abode supported by a great host drawn from his earldom. But\r\nthe delay was fatal to his cause: his troops lost heart and deserted,\r\nand before long the king was able to decree summary banishment for the\r\nearl and all the family. The earl fled to Flanders, Harold to the Ostmen\r\nof Dublin,[27] and for a year Edward remained the undisputed master of\r\nhis own realm.\r\n\r\nThe royalist party which had achieved this memorable success was in the\r\nmain recruited from two sources. The hostility of Mercia and Northumbria\r\nto the domination of a West Saxon earl brought over to the king’s side a\r\nvast number of supporters who were doubtless no more loyal in reality to\r\nthe king than were Godwine and his men, but who welcomed so fair an\r\nopportunity of striking a blow at the rule of the southern family. On\r\nthe other hand, it is clear that racial feeling entered into the\r\nquarrel, and that the Norman settlers whom Edward had invited to take\r\nland and lordship in England were the avowed enemies of Godwine and his\r\nparty. It is only natural to infer that Edward, in addition to the\r\npredilection which he must have felt for men of the race among which he\r\nhad found shelter in the days of his exile, should wish to find in them\r\nsome counterpoise to the power of the Earl of Wessex and his associates.\r\nIt is certain that there was a powerful Norman element at court, and in\r\nthe country, which contributed very materially to the king’s success in\r\n1051. The archbishopric of Canterbury and the sees of London and\r\nDorchester were held by Norman priests, and in Herefordshire, under the\r\njurisdiction of Earl Ralf, a flourishing Norman colony had been planted\r\non the Welsh border. Under this Norman influence the art of\r\ncastle-building was introduced into England, to the infinite disgust of\r\nthe country folk in the neighbourhood of the new fortresses, and the\r\nEarl of Hereford tried very unsuccessfully to induce the local militia,\r\nof which he was the official leader, to serve on horseback in their\r\ncampaigns against the Welsh. In another direction, the king’s\r\n“chancery,” which was gradually becoming an organised medium for the\r\ndischarge of the king’s legal business, was largely staffed by Norman\r\nclerks, and the service of the royal chapel was in part, at least,\r\nconducted by priests from across the Channel. In the sphere of commerce\r\nthe connection between England and Normandy, which can be traced already\r\nin the time of King Ethelred, was steadily becoming closer and more\r\npermanent; before 1066 at least five of the ports of Sussex were in\r\nNorman hands, and Norman merchants possessed a haven of their own in the\r\nestuary of the Thames. We can never hope to form an exact estimate of\r\nthe extent of Norman influence in the last days of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nstate, but there can be no doubt either of its general significance or\r\nof its importance in lessening the shock occasioned by the rapid\r\nNormanisation of England after 1066.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, the Normans in England were not strong enough\r\npermanently to assume the direction of the commonwealth, and in 1052\r\nGodwine and his sons made a triumphant return. The old earl had no\r\ndifficulty in recruiting a powerful force in Flanders, and Harold in\r\nDanish Ireland found numbers of adventurers only too eager to follow the\r\nfortunes of a leader who could promise excitement and booty. In the\r\nmiddle of 1052, Harold, acting no doubt in concert with his father, set\r\nsail from Ireland with nine ships, landed on the coast of Somerset at\r\nPorlock, and there proceeded to slay and harry in true Viking fashion,\r\npassing on round the Land’s End and so along the Channel. In the\r\nmeantime Godwine with his Flemish pirates had reached the Isle of Wight\r\nand plundered it until the inhabitants were driven to pay whatever\r\nransom the earl might demand. Off the Isle of Wight Harold joined forces\r\nwith his father, and the earls sailed on past Pevensey and Hastings and\r\nalong the Kentish shore, drawing many volunteers from the friendly ports\r\nat which they called, while their crews indulged in sporadic devastation\r\nelsewhere. Without serious opposition the exiles entered the Thames, and\r\nsailed up the river as far as London Bridge; Godwine disembarked at\r\nSouthwark and the feeling of the city declared itself unmistakably on\r\nhis side. The archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of Dorchester made\r\na hurried escape from the town and rode for their lives to the Essex\r\ncoast, where they crossed to Normandy. The king, powerless to protect\r\nhis friends in the moment of the reaction, had no option but to restore\r\nGodwine and his family to all their honours and offices, and he was\r\nforced to declare outlaw “all Frenchmen who had raised disorder and\r\nproclaimed bad law and had plotted evil against the land.” He was,\r\nhowever, even allowed to retain about his person such Normans as\r\nGodwine’s party chose to consider loyal to the king and his people; and\r\nindeed it does not appear that the triumph of the nationalists in 1052\r\nwas followed by any considerable exodus of foreign settlers from the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nGodwine had thus secured an unequivocal victory, but he and his friends\r\nproceeded to make a false move, the result of which was to throw the\r\nwhole influence of the church on to the side of the Norman invader in\r\n1066. The flight of the archbishop of Canterbury had left the\r\nmetropolitan see at the mercy of Godwine’s party, and it was immediately\r\ngiven to Stigand, bishop of Winchester, the leading ecclesiastical\r\npartisan of the earl of Wessex. The act was a gross violation of law and\r\ndecency, for the exiled archbishop had been deposed by no clerical\r\ntribunal, and Stigand did not improve his position by continuing to hold\r\nthe see of Winchester in plurality with that of Canterbury. The Curia\r\nrefused to recognise him as metropolitan, and in 1058 Stigand aggravated\r\nhis guilt by accepting the pallium, the badge of the archiepiscopal\r\nrank, from an antipope, thereby in effect giving defiance to that\r\nsection of the church which represented its highest ideals, and was\r\ndestined to exercise most influence in the coming years. Before long\r\nStigand’s political associates perceived the mistake that had been made,\r\nand for the next fifteen years the province of Canterbury was, in\r\nmatters of spiritual jurisdiction, left without a head. Between 1058 and\r\n1066 Stigand never consecrated a bishop, and at ecclesiastical\r\nceremonies of especial importance his place was taken by the primate of\r\nYork. To all strict churchmen the nominal head of the church in England\r\nwas a schismatic, disowned by his own suffragans and banned by the Holy\r\nSee; and it would be difficult to overestimate the importance of this\r\nfact in preparing the public opinion of Europe to support the enterprise\r\nof William of Normandy in 1066.\r\n\r\nGodwine survived his restoration for little more than a year, and on his\r\ndeath in 1053 his earldom of Wessex passed to Harold as his eldest\r\nsurviving son. For thirteen years it is probable that Harold was the\r\nreal head of the English government. Until the very close of this period\r\nthe internal history of England is almost barren of recorded events, and\r\nits significance lies in the steady aggrandisement of the family of\r\nwhich Harold was now the head. By the beginning of 1065 the wealthiest\r\nand most warlike parts of the country were divided into earldoms held by\r\nmembers of the house of Godwine. Wessex, Harold kept under his own rule,\r\nwith the addition of the shires of Gloucester and Hereford; Leofwine,\r\nhis youngest brother, governed a province comprising Essex, Hertford,\r\nMiddlesex, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex; Gyrth, a third brother, held East\r\nAnglia; to which was added the midland shire of Oxford.[28] Even\r\nNorthumbria had been secured by an earl of the family, for Tostig, the\r\nonly one of Godwine’s sons for whom King Edward seems to have felt\r\npersonal affection, had received the government of that lawless land\r\nupon the death of its native earl, Siward, in 1055. Less obvious, but\r\nequally suggestive of the general trend of Harold’s policy, is the\r\nenormous amount of land of which he held direct possession at the\r\nConfessor’s death. There was scarcely a shire in which a certain number\r\nof estates were not held by the earl of Wessex in 1066; and _Domesday\r\nBook_, in recording the fact of his ownership, will often also record\r\nthat it had been acquired by force or injustice. Harold, like his\r\nfather, was quite unscrupulous in the advancement of his interests, and\r\nhis greed for land and revenue is one of the few traits in his character\r\nof which we can be certain. Of his brothers, Gyrth and Leofwine are very\r\nimperfectly known to us, although in the Norman traditions of the\r\ntwelfth century the former is represented as the real hero of the\r\ncampaign of Hastings on the English side. But Tostig, the earl of\r\nNorthumbria, was a man of stronger character, and the circumstances of\r\nhis fall from power demand a brief account in this place.\r\n\r\nTostig’s appointment in 1055 had been an experiment and a rash one. From\r\nthe overthrow of the Northumbrian kingdom by Edred, down to the last\r\nyear of Harthacnut, a dynasty of native earls had presided over the\r\nnorth. The succession in the southern half of the earldom, between Tees\r\nand Humber, had been broken in the reign of Cnut, but the ancient family\r\ncontinued to rule in Bernicia until in 1041 Ealdwulf II., the last earl\r\nof the house, was murdered by Siward the Danish ruler of Yorkshire.\r\nSiward thereupon reunited the two halves of the Northumbrian earldom,\r\ngaining in local eyes some title to the government by his marriage with\r\nAelflaed, the niece of his victim Eadwulf; and for fourteen years his\r\nruthless severity kept his province in comparative quiet. In Tostig,\r\nSiward’s successor, the Northumbrians for the first time were expected\r\nto obey a south-country stranger, and hence there was no qualification\r\nto the hatred which Tostig caused by his imitation of his predecessor’s\r\nmethods of government. As a personal favourite of the king, Tostig was\r\nabsent from his province for long spaces of time, and it is not easy to\r\nunderstand why the Northumbrians submitted for ten years to the\r\nspasmodic tyranny of a stranger. But at last, in 1064, Tostig entrapped\r\nand murdered two leading thegns of the north, named Gamel the son of\r\nOrm, and Ulf; and at Christmas time in the same year Gospatric, the last\r\nmale descendant of the ancient earls of Bernicia, was slain at the\r\nking’s court in Tostig’s interest.[29] For nine months there was ominous\r\npeace in Northumbria, and then, very unexpectedly, in October, 1065, a\r\ngreat revolt burst out. Two hundred thegns marched to York, held a\r\nmeeting in which we may possibly recognise a Northumbrian _gemot_,\r\ndeposed Tostig, and offered the earldom to Morcar, brother of Edwin the\r\nreigning earl of Mercia, and grandson of Leofric. These events were\r\nfollowed by a general massacre of Tostig’s adherents in York, and then\r\nthe rebel army, with Morcar, the new earl, at its head, rolled\r\nsouthwards to force a confirmation of its revolutionary acts from the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the outbreak Tostig was absent in Hampshire, hunting\r\nwith King Edward. Events had now passed quite beyond his control; Morcar\r\nhad been joined by his brother Earl Edwin with the fyrd of Mercia, and a\r\ncontingent of Welshmen, and the combined force had reached Northampton,\r\ntheir line of advance being marked with wholesale ravages which can be\r\ntraced very clearly in the pages of the Northamptonshire _Domesday_.[30]\r\nAt Northampton the rebels were met by Harold bearing a message from the\r\nking to the effect that, if they were to disperse, their charges against\r\nTostig should be heard and decided in lawful manner. They returned a\r\nblank refusal to accept Tostig again as their earl, swept on down the\r\nCherwell Valley, and next appear in occupation of Oxford. In the\r\nmeantime Edward had called a council at Bretford near Salisbury, at\r\nwhich there was a long and angry debate, and Harold was roundly accused\r\nof stirring up the present rising for his own advantage. The earl\r\ncleared himself of the charge with an oath, and the discussion turned to\r\nthe measures to be adopted to restore order. Edward himself was for\r\nputting down the revolt by force; but his counsellors urged the\r\ndifficulty of conducting a campaign in winter, and the king was seized\r\nwith a sudden illness which left the immediate control of affairs in the\r\nhands of Harold. Accordingly Harold paid a second visit to the rebels’\r\ncamp, this time at Oxford, and formally granted their demands. Tostig\r\nwas outlawed, Morcar was recognised as earl of Northumbria, and\r\nWaltheof, the son of Siward, who might consider himself aggrieved by\r\nthis alienation of his father’s earldom, was portioned off with the\r\nmidland shires of Northampton, Huntington, Bedford, and Cambridge.\r\nTostig himself, to the king’s great regret, took ship for Flanders, and\r\nspent the winter at St. Omer.\r\n\r\nThe above course of events is clear, and attested by good contemporary\r\nauthority, but there is evidently much beneath the surface which is not\r\nexplained to us. The revolt must clearly have been planned and organised\r\nsome time before its actual outbreak, but who was really responsible for\r\nit? It would be natural enough to lay the blame on Edwin and Morcar, and\r\non any showing they can hardly be acquitted, but it is at least doubtful\r\nwhether the causes of the rising do not lie deeper. It is hard to avoid\r\nsuspicion that the men who accused Harold in the council at Bretford may\r\nhave had knowledge of the facts behind their accusation. It is quite\r\ncertain that Harold was forming plans for his own succession to the\r\nthrone upon Edward’s death—would those plans be furthered by the\r\nsubstitution of Morcar for Tostig as earl of Northumbria? From this\r\npoint we are in the region of conjecture, but our authorities give us\r\ncertain hints which are significant. It was certain that the last wishes\r\nof the king would be a most powerful factor in determining the choice of\r\nhis successor; Tostig was Edward’s favourite, Harold might well feel\r\nanxious about the manner in which the old king would use his influence\r\nwhen the end came. Then, too, there is evidence that Harold about this\r\ntime was trying to conciliate the great Mercian family; and the\r\nsuspicion is raised that Edwin’s acquiescence in Harold’s schemes in\r\n1066 was not unconnected with Morcar’s elevation in 1065. Lastly,\r\nHarold’s action in granting the demands of the rebels, the moment that\r\nEdward’s illness had given him a free hand, is itself suggestive of some\r\ncollusion with the authors of the rising. If Harold’s policy had been\r\nstrictly honourable his conduct should hardly have given rise to doubts\r\nlike these; and if on the evidence before us we may hesitate to condemn\r\nhim outright, we may at least acknowledge that his contemporary accusers\r\ndeserved a respectful hearing.\r\n\r\nMore important and less conjectural than the nature of Harold’s conduct\r\nis the picture given by these events of the conditions of England in\r\n1065. All the symptoms of political disorganisation on which we have\r\nalready commented—the independence of the great earls, the importance of\r\nthe executive, the fatuity of the royal counsellors, the personal\r\nweakness of the king—are illustrated by the narrative of Tostig’s\r\nexpulsion. For just another year the Old English state was to stand\r\ntrembling to its fall, and then the final test of political stability\r\nwould be applied and a conquering race would slowly rebuild the social\r\nfabric which it had overthrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of Edward the Confessor]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n              THE MINORITY OF DUKE WILLIAM AND ITS RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the famous stories which enliven the history of the early dukes of\r\nNormandy there stands out prominently the tale of the romantic\r\ncircumstances which led to the birth of Duke William II., the greatest\r\nof his line. The substantial truth of the legend has never been called\r\nin question, and we may still read in safety how Robert, the young count\r\nof the Hiesmois, the Son of Duke Richard I. and the fourth in descent\r\nfrom Rollo, was riding towards his capital of Falaise when he saw\r\nArlette, the daughter of a tanner in the town, washing linen in a\r\nstream, according to one account—dancing, according to another; how he\r\nfell in love at first sight, and carried her off straightway to his\r\ncastle; and how the connection thus begun lasted unbroken until Robert’s\r\ndeath seven or eight years later. The whole course of William’s early\r\nhistory was determined by the fact of his illegitimacy, and the main\r\npoints of the story as we have it must already have been known to the\r\ncitizens of Alençon when they cried out “Hides for the tanner” as the\r\nduke came up to their defences in the famous siege of 1049. In fact, the\r\ntale itself is thoroughly in keeping with the sexual irregularity which\r\nwas common to the whole house of Rollo, with the single exception of the\r\ngreat Conqueror himself, and we may admit that there is a certain\r\ndramatic fitness in this unconventional origin of the man who more than\r\nany other of his time could make very unpromising conditions the prelude\r\nto brilliant results.[31] The exact date of William’s birth is not\r\ncertain; it is very probable that it fell between October and December,\r\n1027, but in any case it cannot be placed later than 1028, a fact which\r\ndeserves notice, for even at the latter date Robert himself cannot\r\npossibly have been older than eighteen and may very well have been at\r\nleast a year younger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EASTERN NORMANDY\r\n  and the border Counties]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Robert I., by some caprice of historical nomenclature\r\nsurnamed the Devil, was a brilliant period of Norman history. Succeeding\r\nto the ducal throne on the sudden, perhaps suspiciously sudden, death of\r\nhis brother Richard III., in 1028, Robert, in the six years of his rule,\r\nwon for the duchy an unprecedented influence in the affairs of the\r\nFrench kingdom. The first duty of a Norman duke, that of keeping his\r\ngreater vassals in order, Robert seems to have performed very\r\neffectively; we may perhaps measure the strength of his hand by the\r\noutburst of anarchy which followed the news of his death. And his\r\nintervention in the general feudal politics of France, interesting\r\nenough in itself, gains in importance when viewed with reference to the\r\nhistory of his greater son. William the Conqueror inherited the\r\nrudiments of a policy from his father; throughout much of his reign he\r\nwas following lines of action which had been suggested between 1028 and\r\n1035.\r\n\r\nThis was so with reference to the greatest of all his achievements, the\r\nconquest of England. There seems no reason to doubt that Robert had gone\r\nthrough the form of marriage with Estrith, the sister of Cnut, and there\r\nis a strong probability that he planned an invasion of England on behalf\r\nof the banished sons of Ethelred. The marriage of Robert’s aunt, Emma,\r\nfirst to Ethelred and then to Cnut,[32] began, as we have seen, that\r\nunbroken connection between England and Normandy which culminated in the\r\nNorman Conquest. Norman enterprise was already in Robert’s reign\r\nextending beyond the borders of the French kingdom to Spain and Italy;\r\nthat it should also extend across the Channel would not be surprising,\r\nfor Normandy was connected with England by commercial as well as\r\ndynastic ties. And William of Jumièges, writing within fifty years of\r\nthe event, has given a circumstantial account of Robert’s warlike\r\npreparations. According to him the invasion of England was only\r\nprevented by a storm, which threw the duke and his cousin Edward, who\r\nwas accompanying him, on to the coast of Jersey. Robert does not seem to\r\nhave repeated the attempt, and before it was made again England had\r\nsuffered a more subtle invasion of Norman ideas under the influence of\r\nEdward the Confessor.\r\n\r\nNor was Norman intervention lacking at the time beyond the western\r\nborder of the duchy. Robert had inherited old claims to suzerainty over\r\nBrittany, and he tried to make them a reality. For some time past\r\nNormandy and Brittany had been drawing nearer to each other; Robert was\r\nhimself a Breton on his mother’s side, and if one aunt of his was queen\r\nof England, another was the dowager countess of Brittany. Breton\r\npolitics were never quite independent of one or other of the great\r\npowers of north France, Normandy, Anjou, or Blois, each of which could\r\nput forward indeterminate feudal claims over the peninsula. Anjou, under\r\nits restless, aggressive counts, was here as elsewhere a formidable\r\nrival to Normandy, and in face of its competition Robert could not allow\r\nhis claims on Brittany to lapse. Hence, when Count Alan repudiated his\r\nhomage, a Norman invasion followed, the result of which was a fresh\r\nrecognition of Robert’s overlordship, and the establishment of still\r\ncloser relations between the two states.[33] Alan is found acting as one\r\nof the guardians of William’s minority—in fact he died, probably from\r\npoison, while besieging the revolted Norman castle of Montgomery in his\r\nward’s interest—and his successor Conan was never really friendly\r\ntowards Normandy. Yet, notwithstanding his hostility, Norman influence\r\nsteadily gained the upper hand in Brittany during William’s life. It is\r\nsignificant that he drew more volunteers for his invasion of England\r\nfrom Brittany than from any other district not under his immediate rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUMIÈGES ABBEY—FAÇADE]\r\n\r\nThe relations of Robert with the French crown were still more important.\r\nThe ancient alliance between the dukes of Normandy and the Capetian\r\ndynasty which William inherited, and which was to be his chief safeguard\r\nduring the first fifteen years of his reign, had been greatly\r\nstrengthened by the action taken by Robert in the internal affairs of\r\nthe Isle de France. One of the few threads of consistent policy which\r\nrun through the complicated history of this period is the persistent\r\nmistrust of successive kings of France towards their formidable\r\nneighbours, the counts of Blois. The possessions of the latter lay\r\nastride the royal demesne in two great blocks, the county of Blois,\r\nwhich bordered it on the west, and the county of Troyes or Champagne,\r\nwhich lay along its eastern frontier. The whole territorial group far\r\nexceeded the royal possessions in extent and resources, and its\r\ngeographical position gave its lords the strategical advantage as well.\r\nAccordingly, the French kings were driven to seek countervailing support\r\namong their greater vassals, and at this time they found it in the duchy\r\nof Normandy. A similar alliance had been formed in the tenth century\r\nagainst the Carolingians; the traditional friendship was readily adapted\r\nto new conditions.\r\n\r\nIts value was clearly proved by the events which followed the death of\r\nKing Robert the Pious. Henry, his eldest surviving son, had been\r\nassociated with him in the kingship and designated as his successor, but\r\nConstance the queen dowager intrigued against the eldest brother in\r\nfavour of her younger son Robert. Odo II., the able and ambitious count\r\nof Blois, took the side of the latter and drove Henry out of the royal\r\ndemesne. He fled to Normandy and was well received by Robert; there\r\nexists a charter of the latter to the abbey of St. Wandrille which Henry\r\nattests as a witness in company with his fellow-exiles, Edward,\r\nafterwards king and confessor, and Edward’s unlucky brother the Etheling\r\nAlfred.[34] Well supported with Norman auxiliaries Henry returned and\r\nconquered the royal demesne piecemeal; and, in return for Robert’s help,\r\nwe are told that the king ceded to him the Vexin Français, the district\r\nbetween the Epte and the Oise.[35]\r\n\r\nThe internal condition of Normandy at this period might perhaps compare\r\nfavourably with that of any of the greater fiefs of north France. A\r\nsuccession of able dukes had, for the time being, reduced the Norman\r\nbaronage to something like order. Other countries also at this time\r\noffered a fairer field for the exercise of superfluous activity; the\r\nmore unquiet spirits went off to seek their fortune in Spain or Italy.\r\nBut in Normandy, as elsewhere, everything depended on the head of the\r\nstate. All the familiar features of feudal anarchy, from the illicit\r\nappropriation of justice and the right of levying taxes to simple\r\noppression and private war, were still ready to break out under a weak\r\nruler. And there existed an additional complication in the large extent\r\nof territory which was in the hands of members of the ducal house. The\r\nlax matrimonial relations of the early dukes had added a very dangerous\r\nelement to the Norman nobility in the representatives of illegitimate or\r\nsemi-legitimate lines of the reigning family. They are collectively\r\ndescribed by William of Jumièges as the “Ricardenses,” and he tells us\r\nwith truth that it was these oblique kinsmen of William who felt most\r\naggrieved at, and offered most opposition to, his accession. They were\r\nespecially formidable from the practice, which had been followed by the\r\nearly dukes, of assigning counties to younger brothers of the intended\r\nheir. Duke Robert himself had before his accession held the county of\r\nthe Hiesmois. Of the illegitimate sons of Richard I., Robert, archbishop\r\nof Rouen, the eldest, held in his lay capacity the county of Evreux; his\r\nnext brother, Malger, the county of Mortain; his youngest brother,\r\nWilliam, the county of Eu; while William, the youngest son of Richard\r\nII., possessed the county of Arques. It is noteworthy that each of these\r\nappanages was, at one period or another in the life of William, the\r\nscene of a real or suspected revolt against him.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general condition of the Norman state when Robert, in the\r\nwinter of 1034, meditating a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, held a council\r\nat Fécamp to decide who should be his successor in case of misadventure,\r\nand brought with him in that capacity his seven-year-old son\r\nWilliam.[36] Notwithstanding the discreet reticence of the later writers\r\nwho describe the scene, we can see that the proposal was intensely\r\ndistasteful to the Norman baronage. To any law-abiding section of the\r\nassembly it must have meant entrusting the welfare of the duchy to the\r\nmost doubtful of hazards, and it was a direct insult to the family pride\r\nof the older Norman nobility. Had there existed at this time any member\r\nof the ducal house who combined legitimacy of birth with reasonable\r\nproximity in the scale of succession, Duke Robert would undoubtedly have\r\nhad the greatest difficulty in carrying his point. But among his many\r\nkinsmen there was not one who did not labour under some serious\r\ndisqualification. Nicholas, the illegitimate son of Richard III., would\r\nhave been a possible claimant, but Duke Robert had taken the precaution\r\nof compelling him, child as he was, to become a monk, and he was now\r\nsafely bestowed in the ducal monastery of Fécamp.[37] Guy of Brionne,\r\nthe son of Robert’s sister, was legitimate indeed, but was younger than\r\nWilliam, and would be counted a member of a foreign house; Malger and\r\nWilliam, Robert’s two surviving brothers, were both illegitimate, and\r\nthe former was a churchman. Members of the older line, descending from\r\nRichard I., probably stood too far back from the line of succession to\r\nadmit of their appearance as serious competitors, and after all there\r\nwas a strong probability that the question would not become a matter of\r\nimmediate importance. Pilgrimages to Jerusalem were not infrequent\r\nevents at this time[38] and Robert’s age was considerably under thirty.\r\nHe had previously secured the assent of his overlord King Henry to his\r\nproposed heir, and the end of the deliberations at Fécamp was the\r\nrecognition of William by the Normans as their future duke.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Duke Robert’s pilgrimage turned out ill; he died on the\r\nhomeward journey, at Nicea, on the second of July, 1035, and the\r\ngovernment fell to William, or rather to the guardians whom his father\r\nhad provided for him before his departure. Of these the highest in rank\r\nwas Count Alan of Brittany, William’s cousin,[39] with whom were\r\nassociated Count Gilbert of Brionne, the ancestor of the mighty house of\r\nClare,[40] Osbern the seneschal of Normandy, and a certain Thorold or\r\nThurcytel de Neufmarché, the latter having personal charge of the young\r\nduke. It was an ominous circumstance that each of these men came to a\r\nviolent end within five years of William’s accession. The house of\r\nMontgomery alone accounted for two of them: Osbern the seneschal was cut\r\ndown in William’s bedroom by William, son of Roger de Montgomery; Count\r\nAlan met his death, as we have seen, during the siege of Montgomery\r\nCastle itself. The assassins of Thurcytel de Neufmarché are not recorded\r\nby name, and a certain amount of confusion hangs over the end of Count\r\nGilbert of Brionne; but William of Jumièges, a good authority, states\r\nthat he fell a victim to murderers hired by Ralf de Wacy, the son of\r\nArchbishop Robert of Rouen. It is at least certain that shortly after\r\nthis last event Ralf de Wacy was chosen by William himself, acting, as\r\nis said, upon the advice of his chief men, as his guardian and the\r\ncommander of the Norman army.\r\n\r\nMore important than this list of crimes is the general question of the\r\nrelations which existed at this critical period between William and the\r\nking of France. We have seen that Duke Robert had secured the king’s\r\nconsent to his nomination of William as the heir of Normandy; and we\r\nhave good reason for believing that William after his accession was, in\r\nthe feudal sense of the phrase, under the guardianship of his overlord.\r\nWeak as the French monarchy seems to be at this time it had not, thus\r\nearly in the eleventh century, finally become compelled to recognise the\r\nheritable character of its greater fiefs. Its chances of interfering\r\nwith credit would vary with each occasion. If a tenant in chief were to\r\ndie leaving a legitimate son of full age, the king in normal cases would\r\nnot try to change the order of inheritance; but a dispute between two\r\nheirs, or the succession of a minor, would give him a fair field for the\r\nexercise of his legal rights. Now William of Normandy was both\r\nillegitimate and a minor and his inheritance was the greatest fief of\r\nnorth France; by taking up the office of guardian towards him the king\r\nwould at once increase the prestige of the monarchy, and also strengthen\r\nthe ancient friendship which existed between Paris and Rouen. Nor are we\r\nleft without direct evidence on this point. William of Malmesbury, in\r\ndescribing the arrangements made at Fécamp, tells us that Count Gilbert\r\nof Brionne, the only one of William’s guardians whom he mentions by\r\nname, was placed under the surveillance of king Henry[41]; and Henry of\r\nHuntingdon incidentally remarks that in 1035 William was residing with\r\nthe king of France and that the revenues of Normandy were temporarily\r\nannexed to the royal exchequer. In view of the statements of these\r\nindependent writers, combined with the antecedent probability of the\r\ncase, we may consider it probable that William, on his father’s death,\r\nbecame the feudal ward of his suzerain,[42] and that very shortly after\r\nhis own accession he spent some time in attendance at the royal court.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that we know very little as to the events of the\r\nnext ten years of William’s life. They were critical years, for in them\r\nWilliam was growing up towards manhood and receiving the while a severe\r\ninitiation into the art of government. The political conditions of the\r\neleventh century did not make for quiet minorities; they left too much\r\nto the strength and discretion of the individual ruler. Private war, for\r\ninstance, might be a tolerable evil when duly regulated and sanctioned\r\nby a strong duke; under the rule of a child the custom merely supplied a\r\nformal excuse for the prevailing anarchy. Later writers give various\r\nincidental illustrations of the state of Normandy at this period. We\r\nread, for instance, how Roger de Toeny, a man of most noble lineage, on\r\nreturning to Normandy from a crusade against the Moors in Spain, started\r\nravaging the land of his neighbours in sheer disgust at the accession of\r\na bastard to the duchy, and was killed in the war which he had\r\nprovoked.[43] But such stories only concern the history of William the\r\nConqueror in so far as they indicate the nature of the evils the\r\nsuppression of which was to be his first employment in the coming years.\r\nTo turn the fighting energy inherent in feudal life from its thousand\r\nunauthorised channels, and to direct it towards a single aim controlled\r\nand determined by himself, was to be the work which led to his greatest\r\nachievements. In the incessant tumults of the first ten years of his\r\nreign we see the aimless stirring of that national force which it is\r\nWilliam’s truest glory to have mastered and directed to his own ends.\r\n\r\nWe get one glimpse of William at this time in a charter[44] which must\r\nhave been granted before 1037, as it is signed by Archbishop Robert of\r\nRouen, who died in that year. The document is of interest as it shows us\r\nthe young duke surrounded by his court, perhaps at one of the great\r\nchurch festivals of the year. Among the witnesses we find Counts Waleran\r\nof Meulan, Enguerrand of Ponthieu, and Gilbert of Brionne; the\r\narchbishop of Dol, as well as his brother metropolitan of Rouen; Osbern\r\nthe seneschal, and four abbots, including the head of the house of\r\nFécamp, in whose favour the charter in question was granted. The\r\npresence of the count of Ponthieu and the archbishop of Dol is important\r\nas showing that even at this stormy time the connection between Normandy\r\nand its neighbours to east and west had not been wholly severed; and it\r\nis interesting to see two of William’s unlucky guardians actually, in\r\nattendance on their lord. It may also be noted that at least one other\r\ncharter[45] has survived, probably a little later in date, but granted\r\nat any rate in or before 1042, in which among a number of rather obscure\r\nnames we find the signature of “Haduiardus Rex,” which strange\r\ndesignation undoubtedly describes Edward of England, then nearing the\r\nend of his long exile at the court of Normandy.\r\n\r\nTo this difficult period of William’s reign must apparently be assigned\r\na somewhat mysterious episode which is recorded by William of Jumièges\r\nalone among our authorities. One of the strongest border fortresses of\r\nNormandy was the castle of Tillières, which commanded the valley of the\r\nArve and was a standing menace to the county of Dreux. The latter was at\r\nthis time in the hands of the crown, but in the tenth century it had\r\nbeen granted to Richard the Fearless, duke of Normandy. He had ceded it\r\nto Count Odo of Blois as the marriage portion of his daughter Mahaut,\r\nbut on her speedy death without issue Odo had refused to return it to\r\nhis father-in-law; and in the border warfare which followed, the duke\r\nfounded the castle of Tillières as a check upon his acquisitive\r\nneighbour.[46] On Odo’s death in 1018 the county of Dreux passed to his\r\noverlord the king of France, but Tillières continued to threaten this\r\nlatest addition to the royal demesne. We know very little as to what\r\nwent on in the valley of the Arve during the twenty years that followed\r\nOdo’s death, but by the beginning of William’s reign it seems certain\r\nthat the Norman claims on Dreux itself had been allowed to lapse, and\r\nthe present dispute centres round Tillières alone. At some unspecified\r\nperiod in William’s minority we find King Henry declaring that, if\r\nWilliam wished to retain his friendship, Tillières must be dismantled or\r\nsurrendered. The young duke himself and some of his barons thought the\r\ncontinued support of the king of France more valuable than a border\r\nfortress and were willing to surrender the castle; but its commander,\r\none Gilbert Crispin, continued to hold out against the king. Tillières\r\nwas thereupon besieged by a mixed force of Frenchmen and Normans, and\r\nWilliam, possibly appearing in person, ordered Gilbert Crispin to\r\ncapitulate. He obeyed with reluctance and the castle was at once burned\r\ndown, the king swearing not to rebuild it within four years, but within\r\nthe stipulated period it seems that the treaty was broken on the French\r\nside. The king at first retired, but not long afterwards he recrossed\r\nthe border, passed across the Hiesmois, burned Argentan, and then\r\nreturning rebuilt the castle of Tillières in defiance of his oath, while\r\nat the same time it would appear that the viscount of the Hiesmois, one\r\nThurstan surnamed “Goz,” was in revolt against William and had\r\ngarrisoned Falaise itself with French troops. Falaise was at once\r\ninvested, William again appearing on the scene to support Ralf de Wacy,\r\nthe commander of his army, and it seemed probable that the castle would\r\nbe taken by storm; but Thurstan Goz was allowed to come to terms with\r\nthe duke and was banished from Normandy, his son Richard continuing in\r\nWilliam’s service as viscount of Avranches. The family is of great\r\ninterest in English history, for Hugh the son of the latter Richard was\r\nto become the first earl “palatine” of Chester. And so it may be well to\r\nnote in passing that the rebel Thurstan is described by William of\r\nJumièges as the son of Ansfrid “The Dane,” a designation which is of\r\ninterest both as proving the Scandinavian origin of the great house of\r\nwhich he was the progenitor, and also as suggesting that a connection,\r\nof which we have few certain traces, may have been maintained between\r\nNormandy and its parent lands for upwards of a century after the treaty\r\nof Claire-sur-Epte.\r\n\r\nThe above is the simplest account that we can give of these\r\ntransactions, which are not very important in themselves, but have been\r\nconsidered to mark the rupture of the old friendship between the\r\nCapetian dynasty and the house of Rollo.[47] But the whole subject is\r\nobscure. The king’s action, in particular, is not readily explicable on\r\nany theory, for there is good reason to believe that at this time he was\r\nactually William’s feudal guardian and certainly a few years later he\r\nappears as fully discharging the duties of that office on the field of\r\nVal-es-dunes; so that it is not easy to see why on the present occasion\r\nhe should inflict gratuitous injury on his ward by sacking his towns and\r\nburning his castles. The affair of Tillières would be quite intelligible\r\nif it stood by itself: it was only natural that the king should take\r\nadvantage of his position to secure the destruction or surrender of a\r\nfortress which threatened his own frontier, and the fact that William\r\nhimself appears as ordering the surrender would alone suggest that he\r\nwas acting under the influence of his overlord. But the raid on Argentan\r\nis a more difficult matter. We do not know, for instance, whether there\r\nwas any connection between the revolt of Thurstan Goz and the king’s\r\ninvasion of the Hiesmois; the mere fact that the rebel commander of\r\nFalaise took French knights into his pay, by no means proves that he was\r\nacting in concert with the French king. The story as we have it suggests\r\nthat there may have been two parties in Normandy at this time, one\r\ndisposed to render obedience to the king of France as overlord, the\r\nother maintaining the independence of the Norman baronage; a state of\r\naffairs which might readily lead to the armed intervention of the king\r\nof France, half in his own interest, half in that of his ward. But\r\nconsidering the fact that we owe our knowledge of these events to one\r\nchronicler only, and that he wrote when the rivalry between Normandy and\r\nFrance had become permanent and keen, we may not improbably suspect that\r\nhe antedated the beginning of strife between these two great powers, and\r\nread the events of William’s minority in the light of his later history.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of western Normandy which took place in the year 1047 marks\r\nthe close of this obscure and difficult period in William’s life; it is\r\nin the crisis of this year that something of the personality of the\r\nfuture Conqueror is revealed to us for the first time. With the battle\r\nof Val-es-dunes William attained his true majority and became at last\r\nthe conscious master of his duchy, soon to win the leading place among\r\nthe greater vassals of the French crown. For ten years more, indeed, he\r\nwas to be confronted, at first by members of his own family, whose\r\nill-will became at times something more than passive disaffection, and\r\nafterwards by his overlord made jealous by his increasing power, but the\r\nfinal issue was never again in serious doubt after his barons had once\r\ntried conclusions with him in pitched battle and had lost the game.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUMIÈGES ABBEY—INTERIOR]\r\n\r\nFor all this, the revolt of 1047 came near putting a summary close to\r\nWilliam’s career and life. Normandy at this time was far from being a\r\nhomogeneous state; apart from the general tendency of feudalism towards\r\nthe isolation of individual barons, the greater divisions of the duchy\r\nhad as yet little real cohesion; and a line of cleavage which is\r\nall-important in this revolt is marked by the river Dive, which\r\nseparates Rouen and its territory, where the ducal power might be\r\nexpected to be at its strongest, from the lands of the Bessin and\r\nCotentin, which were always predisposed to local independence. These\r\ndistricts, as we have seen, formed no part of the territory ceded to\r\nRollo by the treaty of Claire-sur-Epte, and it is quite possible that\r\nthe course of events in the present year may have been affected by the\r\ndistinction between the Gallicised Northmen of the Rouennais and Evrècin\r\nand the more primitive folk of the lands west of Dive. At any rate it\r\nwas from the latter quarter that the main strength of the rising was\r\ndrawn. The Bessin and Cotentin revolted under their respective\r\nviscounts, Randolf de Brichessart and Neel de Saint Sauveur, the latter\r\nbeing the most prominent leader in the whole affair; and with them were\r\nassociated one Hamo, nicknamed “Dentatus,” the lord of Thorigny and\r\nCreuilly, and Grimbald the seigneur of Plessis. The nominal head of the\r\nrevolt was William’s cousin Guy, son of Reginald, count of the\r\nBurgundian Palatinate by Adeliz, daughter of Duke Richard II. of\r\nNormandy, a young man, who up to this time had been the constant\r\ncompanion of William, and had received from him Brionne and Vernon, two\r\nof the most important castles of eastern Normandy. Guy was one of the\r\nfew legitimate members of the ducal family, and he and his confederates\r\nfound a justification for their rising in the stain which rested upon\r\nWilliam’s birth. We are told that their ultimate object was to divide\r\nthe duchy among themselves, and we may suppose that Guy would have taken\r\nRouen and the surrounding country with the title of duke, leaving the\r\nwestern lords in practical independence. The latter took an oath to\r\nsupport his claims and to depose William, and they put their castles\r\ninto a state of defence.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolt broke out William was in the heart of the enemies’\r\ncountry at Valognes, a town which seems to have been his favourite\r\nhunting seat in the west of Normandy. The opportunity was too good to be\r\nmissed, and a plot was laid for his capture which came within an ace of\r\nsuccess, and according to later tradition was only discovered, on the\r\npoint of its execution, by Gallet, William’s fool. The duke had gone to\r\nbed when Gallet burst into his room and called on him to escape for his\r\nlife. Clad in such garments as came to hand William sprang on horseback,\r\nand rode away through the dead of night eastwards towards his native and\r\nloyal town of Falaise. He took the coast road, crossing the estuary of\r\nthe Vire at low water, and by day-break he had covered the forty miles\r\nwhich separate Valognes from Rye. It so chanced that Hubert the lord of\r\nRye was standing between his castle mound and the neighbouring church as\r\nthe duke came riding by, and recognising his lord he asked the reason of\r\nhis haste. Upon learning of his danger Hubert called three of his sons\r\nand bade them escort the duke to Falaise; but even in the capital of his\r\nnative province William made no delay, and hastened across the borders\r\nof his duchy to ask help of his overlord and guardian, King Henry of\r\nFrance.[48] The king and the duke met at Poissy, and a French army\r\nprepared to enter Normandy under the leadership of the king in person,\r\nwhile on his part William summoned the men of Rouen, Auge, Lisieux,\r\nEvreux, and the Hiesmois, men, that is, from all Normandy east of the\r\nDive and from the territory belonging to Falaise, west of that river.\r\nThe Normans assembled in the latter district and concentrated on the\r\nMeance near Argences; the French army drew together on the Laison\r\nbetween Argences and Mezidon. King Henry heard mass and arranged his\r\ntroops at Valmeray, then crossed the Olne on to the plain of\r\nVal-es-dunes and drew up his men on the bank of the river. In that\r\nposition he was joined by William, who had crossed at the ford of\r\nBerangier, and the combined force prepared for battle, the Frenchmen\r\nforming the left wing and the Normans the right.[49]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the revolt had spread apace. The rebels had seized the\r\nduke’s demesne and, it would seem, were prepared to invade the loyal\r\ncountry across the Dive, for they had reached Val-es-dunes before the\r\nking and the duke had arrived there. Like their opponents, they drew up\r\ntheir army in two divisions, the men of the Cotentin forming the right\r\nwing and those of the Bessin the left. The battle seems to have begun by\r\na charge of the Cotentin men on the French, but of the struggle which\r\nfollowed we have only a confused and indefinite account; it appears to\r\nhave been a simple cavalry encounter, calling for no special tactical\r\nskill in the leaders of either side. Even in most of the Norman accounts\r\nof the battle William plays a part distinctly secondary to that of his\r\noverlord, although the latter had the ill luck to be unhorsed twice\r\nduring the day, once by a knight of the Cotentin and once by the rebel\r\nleader Hamo “Dentatus.” Before long the fight was going decisively in\r\nfavour of the loyal party. The rebel leaders seem to have mistrusted\r\neach other’s good faith. In particular Ralf of Brichessart began to fear\r\ntreachery; he suspected that Neel de Saint Sauveur might have left the\r\nfield, while one of his own most distinguished vassals had been cut down\r\nbefore his eyes, by the duke’s own hand as later Norman tradition said.\r\nAccordingly, long before the fight was over he left the field, but the\r\nwestern men were still held together by Neel, who made a determined\r\nstand on the high ground by the church of St. Lawrence. At last he too\r\ngave way, the flight became general, and it was at this point that the\r\nrebel force suffered its heaviest losses, for the broken army tried to\r\nmake its way into the friendly land of the Bessin, and the river Olne\r\nlay immediately to the west of the plateau of Val-es-dunes. Large\r\nnumbers of the rebels perished in the river and the rest escaped between\r\nAlegmagne and Farlenay, while Guy himself, who had been wounded in the\r\nbattle, fled eastward to his castle of Brionne.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of this fortress must have been for William the most\r\nformidable part of the whole campaign. Even in the middle of the\r\neleventh century the art of fortification was much more fully developed\r\nthan the art of attack, and at Brionne the site of the castle materially\r\naided the work of defence. The castle itself stood on an island in the\r\nriver Risle, which at that point was unfordable, and it was\r\ndistinguished from the wooden fortifications common at the time by the\r\nfact that it contained a stone “hall,” which was evidently considered\r\nthe crowning feature of its defences.[50] Immediately, it would seem,\r\nafter the battle of Val-es-dunes King Henry retired to France, while\r\nWilliam hastened to the siege of Brionne. A direct attack on the castle\r\nbeing impossible, William built counterworks on either bank of the Risle\r\nand set to work to starve the garrison into surrender. By all accounts\r\nthe process took a long time,[51] but at last the failure of supplies\r\ndrove Guy to send and ask for terms with William. These were\r\nsufficiently lenient; Guy was required to surrender Brionne and Vernon,\r\nbut was allowed to live at William’s court if he pleased. No very\r\ndrastic measures were taken with regard to the rebels of lower rank, but\r\nWilliam, realising with true instinct where his real danger had lain,\r\ndismantled the castles which had been fortified against him; and with\r\nthe disappearance of the castles the fear[52] of civil war vanished from\r\nNormandy for a while. The capital punishment of rebellious vassals was\r\nnot in accordance with the feudal custom of the time.[53] The legal\r\ndoctrine of sovereignty, which made the levying of war against the head\r\nof the state the most heinous of all crimes, was the creation of the\r\nrevived study of Roman law in the next century; and a mere revolt, if\r\nunaggravated by any special act of treason, could still be atoned for by\r\nthe imprisonment of the leaders and the confiscation of their lands. To\r\nthis we must add that William as yet was no king, the head of no feudal\r\nhierarchy; the distance that separated him from a viscount of Coutances\r\nwas far less than the distance that came to separate a duke of Somerset\r\nfrom Edward IV. The one man who was treated with severity on the present\r\noccasion was Grimbald of Plessis, on whom was laid the especial guilt of\r\nthe attempt on William’s life at Valognes. He was sent into perpetual\r\nimprisonment at Rouen, where he shortly died, directing that he should\r\nbe buried in his fetters as a traitor to his lord.[54] Guy of Burgundy\r\nseems to have become completely discredited by his conduct in the war,\r\nlife in Normandy became unbearable to him, and of his own free will he\r\nretired to Burgundy, and vanishes from Norman history.\r\n\r\nThe war was over, and William’s future in Normandy was secured, but the\r\nrevolt had indirect results which extended far beyond the immediate\r\nsequence of events. It was William’s duty and interest to return the\r\nservice which King Henry had just done to him, and it was this which\r\nfirst brought him into hostile relations with the rising power on the\r\nlower Loire, the county of Anjou. The history of Anjou is in great part\r\nthe record of a continuous process of territorial expansion, which, even\r\nby the beginning of the eleventh century had raised the petty lordship\r\nof Angers to the position of a feudal power of the first rank. Angers\r\nitself, situated as it was in the centre of the original Anjou, was an\r\nexcellent capital for a line of aggressive feudal princes, who were\r\nenabled to strike at will at Brittany, Maine, Touraine, or Saintonge,\r\nand made the most of their strategical advantage. With Normandy the\r\ncounts of Anjou had not as yet come into conflict; the county of Maine\r\nhad up to the present separated the two states, and the collision might\r\nhave been indefinitely postponed had not the events of 1047 compelled\r\nWilliam of Normandy to bear his part in a quarrel which shortly\r\nafterwards broke out between the king of France and Count Geoffrey II.\r\nof Anjou.\r\n\r\nThe first five years of William’s minority had coincided, in the history\r\nof Anjou, with the close of the long reign of Count Fulk Nerra, who for\r\nmore than fifty years had been extending the borders of his county with\r\nunceasing energy and an entire absence of moral scruple, and has justly\r\nbeen described as the founder of the Angevin state. His son and\r\nsuccessor Geoffrey, commonly known in history, as to his contemporaries,\r\nunder the significant nickname of Martel, continued his father’s work of\r\nterritorial aggrandisement. He had three distinct objects in view: to\r\nround off his hereditary possessions by getting possession of Touraine,\r\nand to extend his territory to the north and south of the Loire at the\r\nexpense of the counts of Maine and Poitou respectively. His methods, as\r\ndescribed by Norman historians, were elementary; his favourite plan was\r\nto seize the person of his enemy and allow him to ransom himself by the\r\ncession of the desired territory. This simple device proved effective\r\nwith the counts of Poitou and Blois; from the former, even before the\r\ndeath of Fulk Nerra, Geoffrey had extorted the cession of Saintonge, and\r\nfrom the latter, after a great victory at Montlouis in 1044, he gained\r\nfull possession of the county of Touraine. The conquest of Touraine was\r\nundertaken with the full consent of the king of France; the counts of\r\nBlois, as we have seen, were ill neighbours to the royal demesne, and\r\nKing Henry and his successors were always ready to ally themselves with\r\nany power capable of making a diversion in their favour. On the other\r\nhand their policy was not, and could not be, consistent in this respect;\r\nthe rudimentary balance of power, which was all that they could hope to\r\nattain at this time, was always liable to be overthrown by the very\r\nmeans which they took to preserve it; a count of Anjou in possession of\r\nSaintonge and Touraine could be a more dangerous rival to the monarchy\r\nthan the weakened count of Blois. Accordingly, less than four years\r\nafter the battle of Montlouis, we find King Henry in arms against\r\nGeoffrey Martel, and William of Normandy attracted by gratitude and\r\nfeudal duty into the conflict.[55]\r\n\r\nWhen William, archdeacon of Lisieux, the Conqueror’s first biographer,\r\nwas living, an exile as he styles himself, in Poitou shortly after this\r\ntime, the prowess of the young duke in this campaign was a matter of\r\ncurrent conversation.[56] The Frenchmen, we are told, were brought to\r\nrealise unwillingly that the army led by William from Normandy was\r\ngreater by far than the whole force supplied by all the other potentates\r\nwho took part in the war. We are also told that King Henry had the\r\ngreatest regard for his protégé, took his advice on all military\r\nmatters, and remonstrated with him affectionately on his too great\r\ndaring in the field. William seems in his early days to have possessed a\r\nfull share of that delight in battle which is perhaps the main motive\r\nunderlying the later romances of chivalry, and his reputation rose\r\nrapidly and extended far. Geoffrey Martel himself said that there could\r\nnowhere be found so good a knight as the duke of Normandy. The princes\r\nof Gascony and Auvergne and even the kings of Spain sent him presents of\r\nhorses and tried to win his favour.[57] Also it must have been about\r\nthis time that William made overtures to Baldwin, count of Flanders, for\r\nthe hand of his daughter, while in 1051 we know that he made a journey,\r\nfraught with memorable consequences, to the court of Edward the\r\nConfessor. In fact, with the subjugation of his barons and his first\r\nAngevin war William sprang at a bound into fame; the political stage of\r\nFrance lacked an actor of the first order, and William in the flush of\r\nhis early manhood was an effective contrast to the subtle and dangerous\r\ncount of Anjou.\r\n\r\nAt some undetermined point in the war an opportunity presented itself\r\nfor Geoffrey Martel to gain a foothold in Norman territory. On the\r\nborder between Normandy and Maine stand the towns of Domfront and\r\nAlençon, each commanding a river valley and a corresponding passage from\r\nthe south into Normandy. Domfront formed part of the great border fief\r\nof Bellême, and at this time it was included in the county of Maine,\r\nover which, as we shall see later, Geoffrey Martel was exercising rights\r\nof suzerainty. Alençon was wholly Norman, but its inhabitants found\r\nWilliam’s strict justice unbearable, and being thus predisposed for\r\nrevolt they admitted a strong Angevin garrison sent by Geoffrey Martel.\r\nWilliam decided to retaliate by capturing Domfront, leaving Alençon to\r\nbe retaken afterwards.[58] The plan was reasonable, but it nearly led to\r\nWilliam’s destruction, for a traitor in the Norman army gave information\r\nas to his movements to the men of Domfront, and it was only through his\r\npersonal prowess that William escaped an ambush skilfully laid to\r\nintercept him as he was reconnoitring near the city. The siege which\r\nfollowed was no light matter. It was winter, Geoffrey had thrown a body\r\nof picked men into the castle, and, unlike Brionne, Domfront was a hill\r\nfortress, accessible at the time only by two steep and narrow paths. It\r\nwould thus be difficult to carry the place by sudden assault; so\r\nWilliam, as formerly at Brionne and later at Arques, established\r\ncounterworks and waited for the result of a blockade, harassing the\r\ngarrison meanwhile by incessant attacks on their walls. The\r\ncounterworks, we are told, consisted of four “castles,” presumably\r\narranged so as to cover the base of the hill on which Domfront stands,\r\nand William contented himself for the present with securing his own\r\nsupplies and preventing any message being carried from the garrison to\r\nthe count of Anjou, in the meantime making use of the opportunities for\r\nsport which the neighbouring country offered. At last the men of Domfort\r\ncontrived to get a messenger through the Norman lines and Geoffrey\r\nadvanced to the relief of his allies with a large army. What followed\r\nmay be told in the words of William of Poitiers:\r\n\r\n  “When William knew this he hastened against him [Geoffrey], entrusting\r\n  the maintenance of the siege to approved knights, and sent forward as\r\n  scouts Roger de Montgomery and William fitz Osbern, both young men and\r\n  eager, who learned the insolent intention of the enemy from his own\r\n  words. For Geoffrey made known by them that he would beat up William’s\r\n  guards before Domfront at dawn the next day, and signified also what\r\n  manner of horse he would ride in the battle and what should be the\r\n  fashion of his shield and clothing. But they replied that he need\r\n  trouble himself no further with the journey which he designed, for he\r\n  whom he sought would come to him with speed, and then in their turn\r\n  they described the horse of their lord, his clothing and arms. These\r\n  tidings increased not a little the zeal of the Normans, but the duke\r\n  himself, the most eager of all, incited them yet further. Perchance\r\n  this excellent youth wished to destroy a tyrant, for the senate of\r\n  Rome and Athens held such an act to be the fairest of all noble deeds.\r\n  But Geoffrey, smitten with sudden terror, before he had so much as\r\n  seen the opposing host sought safety in flight with his whole army,\r\n  and lo! the path lay open whereby the Norman duke might spoil the\r\n  wealth of his enemy and blot out his rival’s name with everlasting\r\n  ignominy.”[59]\r\n\r\nIt is painful to pass from this rhapsody to what is perhaps the grimmest\r\nscene in William’s life. The retreat of Geoffrey, to whatever cause it\r\nis to be assigned, exposed Alençon to William’s vengeance. Leaving a\r\nsufficient force before Domfront to maintain the siege, in a single\r\nnight’s march he crossed the water-parting of the Varenne and the\r\nSarthe, and approached Alençon as dawn was breaking. Facing him was the\r\nfortified bridge over the Sarthe, behind it lay the town, and above the\r\ntown stood the castle, all fully defended. On the bridge certain of the\r\ncitizens had hung out skins, and as William drew near they beat them,\r\nshouting “Hides for the tanner.”[60] With a mighty oath the young duke\r\nswore that he would prune those men as it were with a pollarding knife,\r\nand within a few hours he had executed his threat. The bridge was\r\nstormed and the town taken, William unroofing the houses which lay\r\noutside the wall and using the timber as fuel to burn the gates, but the\r\ncastle still held out. Thirty-two of the citizens were then brought\r\nbefore the duke; their hands and feet were struck off and flung\r\nstraightway over the wall of the castle among its defenders.[61] With\r\nthe hasty submission of the castle which followed William was free to\r\ngive his whole attention to the reduction of Domfront, and on his return\r\nhe found the garrison already demoralised by the news of what had\r\nhappened at Alençon, and by the ineffective departure of Geoffrey\r\nMartel. They made an honourable surrender and Domfront became a Norman\r\npossession,[62] the first point gained in the struggle which was not to\r\nend until a count of Anjou united the thrones of Normandy, Maine, and\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denier of Geoffrey Martel]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The boundary of the Danelaw in its full extent is proved by certain\r\n  twelfth-century lists of shires which divide England into\r\n  “Westsexenelage,” “Mirchenelage,” and “Danelage.” With regard to\r\n  earlier times, the territory of the Five Boroughs is delimited by the\r\n  fiscal peculiarities described below (Chapter XII.), and the kingdom\r\n  of Northumbria substantially corresponds with Yorkshire as surveyed in\r\n  _Domesday Book_, but it is very uncertain how far Guthrum’s kingdom\r\n  extended westward after his final peace with Alfred.

It was by no means an unimportant time; it\r\nincluded one external event of great importance, William’s visit to\r\nEngland in 1051, but its real significance lay in the gradual\r\nconsolidation of his power in Normandy and its results. On the one hand\r\nit was in these years that William finally suppressed the irreconcilable\r\nmembers of his own family; on the other hand the gradual dissolution of\r\nthe traditional alliance between Normandy and the Capetian house runs\r\nparallel to this process and is essentially caused by it. From the very\r\ntime when William attained his majority these two powers begin steadily\r\nto drift apart; the breach widens as William’s power increases, and the\r\nsupport given by the king of France in these years to Norman rebels such\r\nas William Busac and William of Arques is naturally followed by his\r\ninvasions of Normandy in 1054 and 1058. As compensation for this\r\nWilliam’s marriage with Matilda of Flanders falls within the same\r\nperiod, and events ruled that the alliance thus formed was to neutralise\r\nthe enmity of the Capetian house at the critical moment of the invasion\r\nof England. There is indeed a sense in which we may say that it was\r\nWilliam’s success in these six years which made the invasion of England\r\npossible; whether consciously or not, William was making indispensable\r\npreparation for his supreme endeavour when he was taking the castles of\r\nhis unquiet kinsmen and banishing them from Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe first of them to go was William surnamed “the Warling,” count of\r\nMortain and grandson of Duke Richard the Fearless. His fall was sudden\r\nand dramatic. As we have only one narrative of these events it may be\r\ngiven here at length:\r\n\r\n  “At that time William named the Warling, of Richard the Great’s line,\r\n  was count of Mortain. One day a certain knight of his household,\r\n  called Robert Bigot, came to him and said, ‘My Lord, I am very poor\r\n  and in this country I cannot obtain relief; I will therefore go to\r\n  Auplia, where I may live more honourably.’ ‘Who,’ said William, ‘has\r\n  advised you thus?’ ‘The poverty which I suffer,’ replied Robert. Then\r\n  said William, ‘Within eight days, in Normandy itself, you shall be\r\n  able in safety to seize with your own hands whatever you may require.’\r\n  Robert therefore, submitting to his lord’s counsel, bided his time,\r\n  and shortly afterwards, through Richard of Avranches his kinsman,\r\n  gained the acquaintance of the duke. One day they were talking in\r\n  private when Robert among other matters repeated the above speech of\r\n  Count William. The duke thereupon summoned the count and asked him\r\n  what he meant by talk of this kind, but he could not deny the matter,\r\n  nor did he dare to tell his real meaning. Then said the duke in his\r\n  wrath: ‘You have planned to confound Normandy with seditious war, and\r\n  wickedly have you plotted to rebel against me and disinherit me,\r\n  therefore it is that you have promised booty to your needy knight.\r\n  But, God granting it, the unbroken peace which we desire shall remain\r\n  to us. Do you therefore depart from Normandy, nor ever return hither\r\n  so long as I live.’ William thus exiled sought Apulia wretchedly,\r\n  accompanied by only one squire, and the duke at once promoted Robert\r\n  his brother and gave him the county of Mortain. Thus harshly did he\r\n  abuse the haughty kindred of his father and honourably exalt the\r\n  humble kindred of his mother.”[63]\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story lies in its last sentence. The haughty kindred of\r\nthe duke’s father were beginning to show themselves dangerous, and\r\nWilliam threw down the challenge to them once for all when he\r\ndisinherited the grandson of Richard the Great in favour of the grandson\r\nof the tanner of Falaise. But, apart from the personal questions\r\ninvolved, the tale is eminently illustrative of William’s conception of\r\nhis duty as a ruler. By policy as well as prepossession he was driven to\r\nbe the stern maintainer of order; the men who would stir up civil war in\r\nNormandy wished also to disinherit its duke, and from this followed\r\nnaturally that community of interest between the ruler and his meaner\r\nsubjects as against the greater baronage which was typical of the early\r\nMiddle Ages in Normandy and England alike. It is inadvisable to\r\nscrutinise too narrowly the means taken by William to secure his\r\nposition; if on the present occasion he exiled his cousin on the mere\r\ninformation of a single knight, he had already been taught the wisdom of\r\nstriking at the root of a rebellion before it had time to grow to a\r\nhead. We must not expect too much forbearance from the head of a feudal\r\nstate in his dealings with a suspected noble when the banishment of the\r\nlatter would place a dangerous fief at the former’s disposal. Lastly, we\r\nmay notice the way in which Apulia is evidently regarded as a land of\r\npromise at this time by all who seek better fortune than Normandy can\r\ngive them. In the eleventh century, as in the fifteenth, Italy was\r\nexercising its perennial attraction for the men of the ruder north, and\r\nunder the leadership of the sons of Tancred of Hauteville a new Normandy\r\nwas rising on the wreck of the Byzantine Empire in the West by the\r\nshores of the Ionian Sea.\r\n\r\nProbably about this time, and possibly not without some connection with\r\nthe disaffection of William the Warling, there occurred another abortive\r\nrevolt, of which the scene was laid, as usual, in one of the\r\nsemi-independent counties held by members of the ducal house. In the\r\nnorth-east corner of Normandy the town of Eu with its surrounding\r\nterritory had been given by Duke Richard II. to his illegitimate brother\r\nWilliam. The latter had three sons, of whom Robert, the eldest,\r\nsucceeded him in the county, Hugh, the youngest, subsequently becoming\r\nbishop of Lisieux. The remaining brother, William, surnamed Busac, is a\r\nmysterious person whose appearance in history is almost confined to the\r\nsingle narrative which we possess of his revolt. The latter is not free\r\nfrom difficulty; William was not his father’s eldest son, and yet at the\r\nperiod in question he appears in possession of the castle of Eu, and,\r\nwhich is much more remarkable, he is represented as laying claim to the\r\nduchy of Normandy itself. At present this is inexplicable, but it is\r\ncertain that the duke besieged and took Eu and drove William Busac into\r\nexile. The place of refuge which he chose is very suggestive. He went to\r\nFrance and attached himself to King Henry, who married him to the\r\nheiress of the county of Soissons, where his descendants were ruling at\r\nthe close of the century.[64] It is plain that the king’s opportunist\r\npolicy has definitely turned against William of Normandy, when we find a\r\nNorman rebel received with open arms and given an important territorial\r\nposition on the border of the royal demesne.[65]\r\n\r\nThe third and last of this series of revolts can be definitely assigned\r\nto the year 1053. It arose like the revolt of William Busac in the land\r\neast of Seine, and its leader was again one of the “_Ricardenses_,” a\r\nmember of a collateral branch of the ducal house. William count of\r\nArques was an illegitimate son of Duke Richard II., and therefore\r\nbrother by the half blood to Duke Robert I., and uncle to William of\r\nNormandy. With the object of conciliating an important member of his\r\nfamily the latter had enfeoffed his uncle in the county of Arques, the\r\ndistrict between Eu and the Pays de Caux. Before long, however,\r\nrelations between the duke and the count became strained; William of\r\nArques was said to have failed in his feudal duty at the siege of\r\nDomfront, and when a little later he proceeded to fortify the capital of\r\nhis county with a castle, it was known that his designs were not\r\nconsonant with loyalty towards the interests of his lord and nephew. In\r\nthe hope of anticipating further trouble the duke insisted on his legal\r\nright of garrisoning the castle with his own troops, but the precaution\r\nproved to be quite futile, for the count soon won over the garrison,\r\ndefied his nephew, and spread destruction over as wide an area as he\r\ncould reach from his base of operations. At this time, as at the similar\r\ncrisis of 1047, William seems to have been at Valognes; he was certainly\r\nsomewhere in the Cotentin when the news of what was happening at Arques\r\nwas brought to him.[66] Without a moment’s delay he rode off towards the\r\nscene of the revolt, crossing the Dive estuary at the ford of St.\r\nClement and so past Bayeux, Caen, and Pont Audemer to the Seine at\r\nCaudebec, and then to Baons-le-Comte and Arques, his companions dropping\r\noff one by one in the course of his headlong ride until only six were\r\nleft. Near to Arques, however, he fell in with a party of three hundred\r\nhorsemen from Rouen, who had set out with the object of preventing the\r\nmen of Arques from carrying supplies into the castle. William had not\r\nyet outgrown the impetuosity which called forth King Henry’s admonitions\r\nin the campaign of 1048: he insisted on delivering an instant attack,\r\nbelieving that the rebels would shrink from meeting him in person, and\r\ndashed on to the castle regardless of the remonstrances of the Rouen\r\nmen, who counselled discretion. Charging up the castle mound he drove\r\nthe count and his men within the fortress as he had anticipated, and we\r\nare given to understand that but for their hastily shutting the gates\r\nagainst him the revolt would have been ended then and there.\r\n\r\nThe surprise assault having failed, nothing was left but a blockade, and\r\naccordingly William established a counterwork at the base of the castle\r\nand entrusted it to Walter Giffard, lord of the neighbouring estate of\r\nLongueville, while he himself went off, “being called by other\r\nbusiness,” as his panegyrist tells us. As a matter of fact it is\r\nprobable that he withdrew from a sense of feudal propriety,[67] for no\r\nless a person than King Henry of France was advancing to the relief of\r\nthe garrison. On all grounds it was desirable for William to refrain\r\nfrom setting a bad example to his barons by actually appearing in arms\r\nagainst his own overlord, and so the operations against the king were\r\nleft to the direction of others. At the outset they were fortunate.\r\nThere were still a few barons in the county of Arques who had not joined\r\nthe rebels, and one of them, Richard of Hugleville, possessed a castle,\r\na few miles from Arques itself, at St. Aubin, which lay on the line of\r\nmarch of the French king. Possibly it was this fact which suggested to\r\nthe besiegers the idea of intercepting the king before he reached\r\nArques; at any rate, they formed a plan of the kind, which proved\r\nsuccessful and curiously anticipates one of the most famous episodes in\r\nthe greater battle of Hastings. The king, who had been marching\r\ncarelessly with a convoy of provisions intended for the garrison within\r\nArques, halted near to St. Aubin. In the meantime the Normans before\r\nArques had sent out a detachment which they divided into two parts, the\r\ngreater part secreting itself not far from St. Aubin, while the rest\r\nmade a feint attack on the royal army. After a short conflict the latter\r\ndivision turned in pretended flight, drew out a number of the king’s\r\narmy in pursuit, and enticed them past the place where the trap was\r\nlaid, whereupon the hidden Normans sallied out, fell on the Frenchmen,\r\nand annihilated them, slaying Enguerrand, count of Ponthieu, and many\r\nother men of note. Notwithstanding this check, the king hurried on to\r\nArques, and succeeded in throwing provisions into the castle, and then,\r\neager to avenge the disaster at St. Aubin, he made a savage attack on\r\nthe counterwork at the foot of the hill. But its defences were strong\r\nand its defenders resolute: so the king, to avoid further loss, beat a\r\nhasty retreat to St. Denis, and with his withdrawal Duke William\r\nreappeared upon the scene.[68] Then the blockade was resumed in earnest,\r\nand we are told that its severity convinced the count of Arques of his\r\nfolly in claiming the duchy against his lord. Repeated messages to King\r\nHenry begging for relief found him unwilling to risk any further loss of\r\nprestige, and at last hunger did its work. The garrison surrendered,\r\nasking that life and limb might be guaranteed to them, but making no\r\nfurther stipulation, and William of Poitiers gleefully describes the\r\nignominious manner of their exit from the castle.[69] Here, as after\r\nVal-es-dunes, it was not the duke’s policy, if it lay in his power, to\r\nproceed to extremities against the beaten rebels, and William was\r\nnotably lenient to his uncle, who was deprived of his county and his\r\ntoo-powerful castle, but was granted at the same time a large estate in\r\nNormandy. However, like Guy of Burgundy, he declined to live in the\r\ncountry over which he had hoped to rule and he went into voluntary exile\r\nat the court of Eustace of Boulogne.\r\n\r\nOne outlying portion of the duchy remained in revolt after the fall of\r\nArques. On the south-western border of Normandy the fortress of Moulins\r\nhad been betrayed to the king by Wimund, its commander, and had received\r\na royal garrison under Guy-Geoffrey, brother of the duke of Aquitaine.\r\nThe importance of this event lay in the fact that Moulins in unfriendly\r\nhands threatened to cut off communications between the Hiesmois and the\r\nhalf-independent county of Bellême. Fortunately for the integrity of the\r\nduchy, the fate of Moulins was determined by the surrender of Arques;\r\nthe garrison gave up their cause as hopeless, and retired without\r\nattempting to stand a siege.[70]\r\n\r\nAt some indefinite point in the short interval of peace which followed\r\nthe revolt of William of Arques, William of Normandy was married to\r\nMatilda, daughter of Baldwin count of Flanders, in the minster at Eu. On\r\nWilliam’s part the consummation of the marriage was an act of simple\r\nlawlessness noteworthy in so faithful a son of Holy Church, for in 1049\r\nthe General Council of Rheims had solemnly forbidden Count Baldwin to\r\ngive his daughter to William of Normandy, and had simultaneously\r\ninhibited William from receiving her.[71] A mystery which has not been\r\nwholly solved hangs over the motives which underlay this prohibition;\r\nfor genealogical research has hitherto failed to discover any tie of\r\naffinity which might furnish an impediment, reasonable or otherwise, to\r\nthe proposed marriage, while at the middle of the eleventh century the\r\nprovisions of the canon law on the subject of the prohibited degrees\r\nwere much less rigid and fantastic than they subsequently became. Yet\r\nthe decree is duly entered among the canons of the Council of Rheims,\r\nand it served to keep William and his chosen bride apart for four years.\r\nEarly in 1053, however, Pope Leo IX. had been taken prisoner by the\r\nNormans in Italy at the battle of Aversa, and the coincidence of his\r\ncaptivity with William’s defiance of the papal censure has not escaped\r\nthe notice of historians.[72] By all churchmen of the stricter sort a\r\nmarriage celebrated under such conditions was certain to be regarded as\r\na scandal. Normandy was laid under an interdict, and in the duchy itself\r\nthe opposition was headed by two men of very different character.\r\nMalger, the archbishop of Rouen at the time, was a brother of the fallen\r\ncount of Arques, and the excommunication which he pronounced against his\r\nerring nephews was probably occasioned as much by the political\r\ngrievances of his family as by righteous indignation at the despite done\r\nto the Council of Rheims. William speedily came to an understanding with\r\nthe Pope by means of which he was enabled to remove Malger from his\r\narchbishopric, but the marriage was also condemned by the man who both\r\nbefore and after that event held above all others the place of the\r\nduke’s familiar friend. The career of Lanfranc of Pavia, at this moment\r\nprior of Bec, will be more fittingly considered elsewhere, but his\r\nopposition to William’s marriage was especially significant because of\r\nhis great legal knowledge and the disinterestedness of his motives, and\r\nthe uncompromising attitude of his most intimate counsellor cut the duke\r\nto the quick. In the outburst of his anger William savagely ordered that\r\nthe lands of the monastery of Bec should be harried, and that Lanfranc\r\nhimself should instantly depart from Normandy. A chance meeting between\r\nthe duke and the prior led to a reconciliation, and Lanfranc was\r\nthereupon employed to negotiate with the papal court for a recognition\r\nof the validity of the marriage. Nevertheless five years passed before\r\nPope Nicholas II. in 1059 granted the necessary dispensation,\r\naccompanied by an injunction that William and his wife should each build\r\nand endow a monastery by way of penance for their disobedience; and the\r\nreasons for this long delay are almost as difficult to understand as are\r\nthe grounds for the original prohibition in 1049. But it is probable\r\nthat William, having once taken the law into his own hands and gained\r\npossession of his bride, was well content that the progress of his suit\r\nat Rome should drag its slow length along, trusting that time and the\r\nchances of diplomatic expediency might soften the rigours of the canon\r\nlaw, and bring the papal curia to acquiescence in the accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nThe county of Flanders, with which Normandy at this time became\r\nintimately connected, held a unique position among the feudal states of\r\nthe north. Part only of the wide territory ruled by Baldwin IV. owed\r\nfeudal service to the king of France, for the eastern portion of the\r\ncounty was an imperial fief, and the fact of his divided allegiance\r\nenabled the count of Flanders to play the part of an international\r\npower. By contemporary writers Count Baldwin is occasionally graced with\r\nthe higher title of Marquis,[73] and the designation well befitted the\r\nman who ruled the wealthiest portion of the borderland between the\r\nFrench kingdom and the German empire. The constant jealousy of his two\r\noverlords secured him in practical independence, and in material\r\nresources it is probable that no prince between the English Channel and\r\nthe Alps could compete with the lord of Bruges and Ghent; for the great\r\ncities of Flanders were already developing the wealth and commercial\r\ninfluence which in the next generation were to give them the lead in the\r\nmovement for communal independence. For some thirty years we find\r\nBaldwin cultivating the friendship of England, as became a ruler whose\r\nsubjects were already finding their markets in English ports; and as the\r\npolitical situation unfolded itself, the part he chose to take in the\r\nstrife of parties across the Channel became a matter of increasing\r\nconcern for English statesmen. “Baldwin’s land,” as the English\r\nchronicler terms it, was the customary resort of political exiles from\r\nEngland, and in 1066 it was the attitude of the count of Flanders which,\r\nas we shall see, really turned the scale in favour of William of\r\nNormandy. At the early date with which we are dealing no one could have\r\nforeseen that this would be so, but the value of a Flemish alliance was\r\nalready recognised in England by the aggressive house with which William\r\nwas at last to come into deadly conflict. In 1051, Tosig, son of Earl\r\nGodwine of Wessex, wedded Judith, Count Baldwin’s sister,[74] and this\r\nfact inevitably gave a political complexion to William’s marriage to\r\nMatilda, two years later. Godwine, as leader of the English\r\nnationalists, and William as ultimate supporter of the Normans in\r\nEngland, were each interested to secure the alliance of a power which\r\nmight intervene with decisive effect on either side and could not be\r\nexpected to preserve strict neutrality in the event of war. William was\r\ntoo shrewd a statesman to ignore these facts; yet after all he probably\r\nregarded his marriage rather as the gratification of a personal desire\r\nthan as a diplomatic victory.\r\n\r\nLong before the political results of William’s marriage had matured\r\nthemselves, the relations between the duke of Normandy and the king of\r\nFrance had entered upon a new phase. The event of the war of 1053 had\r\nshewn that it was eminently in the interests of the French monarchy that\r\nthe growth of the Norman power should be checked before it could proceed\r\nto actual encroachment on the royal demesne; and also that if this were\r\nto be accomplished it would no longer suffice for King Henry to content\r\nhimself with giving support to casual Norman factions in arms against\r\ntheir lawful ruler. This plan had led to ignominious failure, and it was\r\nclear that in future it would be necessary for King Henry to appear as a\r\nprincipal in the war and test whether the Norman duke was strong enough\r\nto withstand the direct attack of his suzerain. These considerations\r\nproduced a phenomenon rarely seen at this date, for the king proceeded\r\nto collect an army in which, through the rhetoric in which our one\r\ncontemporary writer veils its composition, we must recognise nothing\r\nless than the entire feudal levy of all France. So rarely does French\r\nfeudalism combine to place its military resources at the disposal of its\r\nsovereign that the fact on this occasion is good evidence of the current\r\nopinion as to the strength of Normandy under its masterful duke. In the\r\nwar which followed, the territorial principles which found their fullest\r\nexpression in the policy of the dukes of Normandy gained a signal\r\nvictory over incoherent feudalism represented by the king of France at\r\nthe head of the gathered forces of his heterogeneous vassals. Not until\r\nsuccessive kings had reduced the royal demesne to such unity as had\r\nalready been reached by Normandy in the eleventh century, could the\r\nFrench crown attempt successful aggressive war.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their feudal duty, certain of the king’s associates in\r\nthe forthcoming campaign had their individual reasons for joining in an\r\nattack on Normandy. The ducal house of Aquitaine would naturally be\r\nattracted into the quarrel by the failure of Guy-Geoffrey to hold\r\nMoulins in the late war; Guy of Ponthieu had to avenge his brother’s\r\ndeath at St. Aubin. Little as the several feudal princes of France may\r\nhave loved their suzerain, their jealousy would readily be roused by the\r\nexceptional power of one of their own number, and the king seems to have\r\nfound little difficulty in collecting forces from every corner of his\r\nrealm. From the Midi the counts of Poitou and Auvergne and the\r\nhalf-autonomous dukes of Aquitaine and Gascony sent contingents; north\r\nof the Loire, every state from Brittany to the duchy of Burgundy was\r\nrepresented in the royal army with one singular exception. Whatever the\r\nreason of his absence, Geoffrey Martel, William’s most formidable rival,\r\ndoes not appear in the list of the king’s associates as given by William\r\nof Poitiers.[75] This may be due to a mere oversight on the latter’s\r\npart, or more probably it may be that Geoffrey was too independent to\r\ntake part in an expedition which, although directed against his personal\r\nenemy, was commanded by his feudal lord. But with or without his aid the\r\narmy which obeyed the king’s summons was to all seeming overwhelmingly\r\nsuperior to any force which the duke of Normandy could put into the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nWith so great an army at his disposal, the king could well afford to\r\ndivide his forces and make a simultaneous invasion of Normandy at two\r\ndifferent points. The lower course of the Seine supplied a natural line\r\nof demarcation between the spheres of operation of the two invading\r\narmies, and accordingly the royal host mustered in two divisions, one\r\nassembling in the Beauvoisis to ravage the Pays de Caux, the other\r\nassembling at Mantes, and directed at the territory of Evreux, Rouen,\r\nand Lisieux. The first division was drawn from those lands between the\r\nRhine and the Seine, which owed allegiance to the French crown, and was\r\nplaced under the command of Odo the king’s brother and Reginald of\r\nClermont. The army which gathered at Mantes comprised the Aquitanian\r\ncontingent, together with troops drawn from the loyal provinces north of\r\nLoire and west of Seine, and was led by the king in person. The general\r\nplan of campaign is thus intelligible enough, but its ultimate purpose\r\nis not so clear, perhaps because the king himself had formed no plans\r\nother than those which related to the actual conduct of the war. On his\r\npart William formed a scheme of defence corresponding to his enemies’\r\nplan of attack. He took the field in person with the men of the Bessin,\r\nCotentin, Avranchin, Auge, and Hiesmois, the districts, that is, which\r\nwere threatened by the king and his southern army, entrusting the\r\ndefence of the Pays de Caux to leaders chosen on account of their local\r\ninfluence, Count Robert of Eu, Hugh of Gournai, Hugh de Montfort, Walter\r\nGiffard, and Gilbert Crispin, the last a great landowner in the Vexin.\r\nWilliam’s object was to play a purely defensive game, a decision which\r\nwas wise as it threw upon the king and his brother the task of\r\nprovisioning and keeping together their unwieldly armies in hostile\r\nterritory. The invading force moved across the country, laying it waste\r\nafter the ordinary fashion of feudal warfare, William hanging on the\r\nflank and rear of the king’s army, cutting off stragglers and foraging\r\nparties and anticipating the inevitable devastation of the land by\r\nremoving all provisions from the king’s line of advance. The king had\r\npenetrated as far as the county of Brionne when disaster fell on the\r\nallied army across the Seine. Thinking that William was retiring in\r\nfront of the king’s march the leaders of the eastern host ignored the\r\nlocal force opposed to themselves in the belief, we are told, that all\r\nthe knights of Normandy were accompanying the duke. But the count of Eu\r\nand his fellow-officers were deliberately reserving their blow until the\r\nwhole of their army had drawn together, and the French met little\r\nopposition until they had come to the town of Mortemer, which they\r\noccupied and used as their headquarters while they ravaged the\r\nneighbourhood in detail at their leisure. Spending the day in plunder\r\nthey kept bad watch at night, and this fact induced the Norman leaders\r\nto try the effect of a surprise. Finding out the disposition of the\r\nFrench force through spies, they moved up to Mortemer by night and\r\nsurrounded it before daybreak, posting guards so as to command all the\r\nexits from the town; and the first intimation which the invaders\r\nreceived of their danger was the firing of the place over their heads by\r\nthe Normans. Then followed a scene of wild confusion. In the dim light\r\nof the wintry dawn the panic-struck Frenchmen instinctively made for the\r\nroads which led out of the town, only to be driven in again by the\r\nNormans stationed at these points. Some of course escaped; Odo the\r\nking’s brother and Reginald of Clermont got clear early in the day, but\r\nfor some hours the mass of the French army was steadily being compressed\r\ninto the middle of the burning town. The Frenchmen must have made a\r\nbrave defence, but they had no chance and perished wholesale, with the\r\nexception of such men of high rank as were worth reserving for their\r\nransoms. Among these last was Count Guy of Ponthieu, whose brother\r\nWaleran perished in the struggle, and who was himself kept for two years\r\nas a prisoner at Bayeux before he bought his liberty by acknowledging\r\nhimself to be William’s “man.” The victory was unqualified, and William\r\nknew how to turn it to fullest account.\r\n\r\nHe received the news on the night following the battle, and instantly\r\nformed a plan, which, even when described by his contemporary\r\nbiographer, reads like a romance. As soon as he knew the result of the\r\nconflict he summoned one of his men and instructed him to go to the\r\nFrench camp and bring to the king himself the news of his defeat. The\r\nman fulfilled his directions, went off, climbed a high tree close to the\r\nking’s tent, and with a mighty voice proclaimed the event of the battle.\r\nThe king, awakened by these tidings of disaster from the air, was struck\r\nwith terror, and, without waiting for the dawn, broke up his camp, and\r\nmade with what haste he might for the Norman border. William, seeing\r\nthat his main purpose was in a fair way of achievement, refrained from\r\nharassing the king’s disorderly retreat; the French were anxious to end\r\nso unlucky a campaign, and peace was soon made. According to the treaty\r\nthe prisoners taken at Mortemer were to be released on payment of their\r\nransoms, while the king promised to confirm William in the possession of\r\nwhatever conquests he had made, or should thereafter make, from the\r\nterritory of Geoffrey of Anjou.[76] Herein, no doubt King Henry in part\r\nwas constrained by necessity, but in view of his defeat it was not\r\ninappropriate that he should make peace for himself at the expense of\r\nthe one great vassal who had neglected to obey the summons to his\r\narmy.[77] And it should be noted that William, though he has the French\r\nking at so great a disadvantage, nevertheless regards the latter’s\r\nconsent to his territorial acquisitions as an object worth stipulation;\r\nKing Henry, to whatever straits he might be reduced, was still his\r\noverlord, and could alone give legal sanction to the conquests made by\r\nhis vassals within the borders of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be a mistake to regard this treaty as marking a\r\nreturn to the state of affairs which prevailed in 1048, when the king\r\nand the duke of Normandy were united against the count of Anjou in the\r\nwar which ended with the capture of Alençon. The peace of 1054 was\r\nlittle more than a suspension of hostilities, each party mistrusting the\r\nother. The first care of the duke, now that his hands were free, was to\r\nstrengthen his position against his overlord, and one of the border\r\nfortresses erected at this time was accidentally to become a name of\r\nnote in the municipal history of England. Over against Tillières, the\r\nborder post which King Henry had taken from Normandy in the stormy times\r\nof William’s minority, the duke now founded the castle of Breteuil, and\r\nentrusted it to William fitz Osbern, his companion in the war of\r\nDomfront.[78] Under the protection of the castle, by a process which was\r\nextremely common in French history, a group of merchants came to found a\r\ntrading community or _bourg_. The burgesses of Breteuil, however,\r\nreceived special privileges from William fitz Osbern and when he, their\r\nlord, became earl of Hereford these privileges were extended to not a\r\nfew of the rising towns along the Welsh border. The “laws of Breteuil,”\r\nwhich are mentioned by name in Domesday Book, and were regarded as a\r\nmodel municipal constitution for two centuries after the conquest of\r\nEngland, thus take their origin from the rights of the burgesses who\r\nclustered round William’s border fortress on the Iton.[79]\r\n\r\nAnother castle built at this time was definitely intended to mark the\r\nreopening of hostilities against the count of Anjou. At Ambrières, near\r\nthe confluence of the Mayenne and the Varenne, William selected a\r\nposition of great natural strength for the site of a castle which should\r\ncommand one of the chief lines of entry from Normandy into the county of\r\nMaine. The significance of this will be seen in the next chapter, and\r\nfor the present we need only remark that in 1051, on the death of Count\r\nHugh IV., Geoffrey Martel, by a brilliant _coup d’état_ had secured his\r\nrecognition by the Manceaux as their immediate lord, and was therefore\r\nat the present moment the direct ruler of the whole county. On the other\r\nhand, the widow of the late count had sought refuge at William’s court,\r\nand her son Herbert, the last male of the old line of the counts of\r\nMaine, had commended himself and his territory to the Norman duke. For\r\nthree years, therefore, William had possessed a good legal pretext for\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Maine; and but for the unquiet\r\nstate of Normandy during this time, followed by the recent French\r\ninvasion, it is probable that he would long ago have challenged his\r\nrival’s possession of the territory which lay between them. That the\r\nfoundation of the castle of Ambrières was regarded as something more\r\nthan a mere casual acquisition on William’s part, is shewn by the action\r\nof Geoffrey of Mayenne, one of the chief barons of the county of Maine,\r\non hearing the news of its intended fortification. With the\r\npunctiliousness which distinguishes all William’s dealings with Geoffrey\r\nMartel, William had sent word to the count of Anjou that within forty\r\ndays he would enter the county of Maine and take possession of\r\nAmbrières. Geoffrey of Mayenne, whose fief lay along the river Mayenne\r\nbetween Ambrières and Anjou, thereupon went to his lord and explained to\r\nhim that if Ambrières once became a Norman fortress his own lands would\r\nnever be safe from invasion. He received a reassuring answer;\r\nnevertheless, on the appointed day, William invaded Maine and set to\r\nwork on the castle according to his declaration; and, although rumour\r\nhad it that Geoffrey Martel would shortly meet him, the days passed\r\nwithout any sign of his appearance. In the meantime, however, the Norman\r\nsupplies began to run short, so that William thought it the safest plan\r\nto dismiss the force which he had in the field, and to content himself\r\nwith garrisoning and provisioning Ambrières, leaving orders that his men\r\nshould hold themselves in readiness to reassemble immediately on\r\nreceiving notice from him. Geoffrey Martel, who had probably been\r\ncounting on some action of the kind, at once seized his opportunity,\r\nand, as soon as he heard that the Norman army had broken up, he marched\r\non Ambrières, having as ally his stepson William, duke of Aquitaine, and\r\nÉon, count of Penthievre, the uncle of the reigning duke of Brittany.\r\nWith William still in the neighbourhood and likely to return at any\r\nmoment, it was no time for a leisurely investment, so Geoffrey made\r\ngreat play with his siege engines, and came near to taking the place by\r\nstorm. His attack failed, however, and William, drawing his army\r\ntogether again, as had been arranged, compelled the count to beat a\r\nhasty retreat. Shortly afterwards Geoffrey of Mayenne was taken\r\nprisoner; and William, with a view to further enterprises in Maine,\r\nseeing the advantage of placing a powerful feudatory of that county in a\r\nposition of technical dependence upon himself, kept him in Normandy\r\nuntil he consented to do homage to his captor.[80] It is also probable\r\nthat on this occasion William still further strengthened his position\r\nwith regard to Maine by founding on the Sarthon the castle of\r\nRoche-Mabille, which castle was entrusted to Roger of Montgomery, and\r\nderives its name from Mabel, the heiress of the county of Bellême, and\r\nthe wife of the castellan.\r\n\r\nThree years of quiet followed these events, about which, as is customary\r\nwith regard to such seasons, our authorities have little to relate to\r\nus. In 1058 came the third and last invasion of Normandy by King Henry\r\nof France, with whom was associated once more Count Geoffrey of Anjou.\r\nNo definite provocation seems to have been given by William for the\r\nattack, but in the interests of the French crown it was needful now as\r\nit had been in 1053 to strike a blow at this over-mighty vassal, and the\r\nking was anxious to take his revenge for the ignominious defeat he had\r\nsustained in the former year. Less formidable in appearance than the\r\nhuge army which had obeyed the king’s summons in the former year, the\r\ninvading force of 1058 was so far successful that it penetrated into the\r\nvery heart of the duchy, while, on the other hand, the disaster which\r\nclosed the war was something much more dramatic in its circumstances and\r\ncrushing in its results than the daybreak surprise of Mortemer. This\r\nexpedition is also distinguished from its forerunner by the fact that\r\nthe king does not seem to have aimed at the conquest or partition of\r\nNormandy: the invasion of 1058 was little more than a plunder raid on a\r\nlarge scale, intended to teach the independent Normans that in spite of\r\nhis previous failures their suzerain was still a person to be feared.\r\nThe king’s plan was to enter Normandy through the Hiesmois; to cross the\r\nBessin as far as the estuary of the Dive and to return after ravaging\r\nAuge and the district of Lisieux. Now, as five years previously, William\r\nchose to stand on the defensive; he put his castles into a state of\r\nsiege and retired to watch the king’s proceedings from Falaise. It was\r\nevidently no part of the king’s purpose to attempt the detailed\r\nreduction of all the scattered fortresses belonging to, or held on\r\nbehalf of, the duke[81]; and this being the case it was best for William\r\nto bide his time, knowing that if he could possess his soul in patience\r\nwhile the king laid waste his land, the trouble would eventually pass\r\naway of its own accord. And so King Henry worked his will on the unlucky\r\nlands of the Hiesmois and the Bessin as far as the river Seule, at which\r\npoint he turned, crossed the Olne at Caen, and prepared to return to\r\nFrance by way of Varaville and Lisieux. William in the meantime was\r\nfollowing in the track of the invading army. The small body of men by\r\nwhich he must have been accompanied proves that he had no thought of\r\ncoming to any general engagement at the time, but suddenly the\r\npossibilities of the situation seem to have occurred to him, and he\r\nhastily summoned the peasantry of the neighbourhood to come in to him\r\narmed as they were. With the makeshift force thus provided he pressed on\r\ndown the valley of the Bavent after the king, who seems to have been\r\nquite unaware of his proximity, and came out at Varaville at the very\r\nmoment when the French army was fully occupied with the passage of the\r\nDive. The king had crossed the river with his vanguard[82]; his\r\nrearguard and baggage train had yet to follow. Seizing the opportunity,\r\nwhich he had probably anticipated, William flung himself upon the\r\nportion of the royal army which was still on his side of the river and\r\nat once threw it into confusion. The Frenchmen who had already passed\r\nthe ford and were climbing up the high ground of Bastebourg to the right\r\nof the river, seeing the plight of their comrades, turned and sought to\r\nrecross; but the causeway across the river mouth was old and unsafe and\r\nthe tide was beginning to turn. Soon the passage of the river became\r\nimpossible, the battle became a mere slaughter, and the Norman poet of\r\nthe next century describes for us the old king standing on the hill\r\nabove the Dive and quivering with impotent passion as he watched his\r\ntroops being cut to pieces by the rustic soldiery of his former ward.\r\nThe struggle cannot have taken long; the rush of the incoming tide made\r\nswimming fatal, and the destruction of the rearguard was complete. With\r\nbut half an army left to him it was hopeless for the king to attempt to\r\navenge the annihilation of the other half; he had no course but to\r\nretrace his steps and make the best terms he could with his victorious\r\nvassal. These terms were very simple—William merely demanded the\r\nsurrender of Tillières, the long-disputed key of the Arve valley.[83]\r\nWith its recovery, the tale of the border fortresses of Normandy was\r\ncomplete; the duchy had amply vindicated its right to independence, and\r\nwas now prepared for aggression.\r\n\r\nThus by the end of 1058 King Henry had been definitely baffled in all\r\nhis successive schemes for the reduction of Normandy. With our knowledge\r\nof the event, our sympathies are naturally and not unfairly on the side\r\nof Duke William, but they should not blind us to the courage and\r\npersistency with which the king continued to face the problems of his\r\ndifficult situation. In every way, of course, the weakest of the early\r\nCapetians suffers by comparison with the greatest of all the dukes of\r\nNormandy. The almost ludicrous disproportion between the king’s legal\r\nposition and his territorial power, his halting, inconsistent policy,\r\nand the ease with which his best-laid plans were turned to his\r\ndiscomfiture by a vassal who studiously refrained from meeting him in\r\nbattle, all make us inclined to agree with William’s panegyrical\r\nbiographer as he contemptuously dismisses his overlord from the field of\r\nVaraville. And yet the wonder is that the king should have maintained\r\nthe struggle for so long with the wretched resources at his disposal.\r\nWith a demesne far less in area than Normandy alone, surrounded by the\r\npossessions of aggressive feudatories and itself studded with the\r\ncastles of a restive nobility, the monarchy depended for existence on\r\nthe mutual jealousy of the great lords of France and on such vague,\r\nthough not of necessity unreal, respect as they were prepared to show to\r\nthe successor of Charlemagne. The Norman wars of Henry I. illustrated\r\nonce for all the impotence of the monarchy under such conditions, and\r\nthe kings who followed him bowed to the limitations imposed by their\r\nposition. Philip I. and Louis VI. were each in general content that the\r\nmonarchy should act merely as a single unit among the territorial powers\r\ninto which the feudal world of France was divided, satisfied if they\r\ncould reduce their own demesne to reasonable obedience and maintain a\r\ncertain measure of diplomatic influence outside. Accordingly from this\r\npoint a change begins to come over the relations between Normandy and\r\nFrance; neither side aims at the subjugation of the other, but each\r\nwatches for such advantages as chance or the shifting feudal\r\ncombinations of the time may present. Within a decade from the battle of\r\nVaraville the duke of Normandy had become master of Maine and England,\r\nbut in these great events the French crown plays no part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denier of Henry I. of France]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  William of Jumièges, vii., 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  William of Jumièges, vii., 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  The visit of William to England in 1051 will be considered below,\r\n  Chapter IV., in its bearing upon the general question of the English\r\n  succession.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  William of Poitiers, 92.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  This is definitely asserted by William of Malmesbury.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  See on this episode, Round, _Feudal England_, 382–385.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Page 95.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  William of Jumièges, vii., 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  _Labbè Concilia_, xi., 1412.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  For example, Freeman, _N.

It is probable\r\n  that Norman chroniclers have attached more importance to the battle\r\n  than it really possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                THE CONQUEST OF MAINE AND THE BRETON WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a curious synchronism both King Henry of France and Count Geoffrey\r\nMartel died in the course of the year 1060; and, with the disappearance\r\nof his two chief enemies of the older generation, the way was clear for\r\nWilliam to attempt a more independent course of action than he had\r\nhitherto essayed. Up to this year his policy had in great measure been\r\ngoverned by the movements of his overlord and the count of Anjou, both\r\nof them men who were playing their part in the political affairs of\r\nFrance at the time when he himself was born. From this date he becomes\r\nthe definite master of his own fortunes, and the circumstances in which\r\nthe king and the count left their respective territories removed any\r\ncheck to his enterprise and aggression which might otherwise have come\r\nfrom those quarters. The king was succeeded by his son Philip, at this\r\ntime a child of scarcely seven years old, and the government of France\r\nduring his minority was in the hands of Baldwin of Flanders, William’s\r\nfather-in-law. In Anjou a war of succession broke out which reduced that\r\nstate to impotence for ten years. Geoffrey Martel had left no sons, but\r\nhad designated as his successor another Geoffrey, nicknamed “_le\r\nBarbu_,” the elder son of his sister Hermengarde by Geoffrey count of\r\nthe Gatinais.[84] The younger son, however, Fulk “_le Rechin_,” had\r\ndetermined to secure the Angevin inheritance for himself, and by the\r\ntime that he had accomplished his purpose most of the territorial\r\nacquisitions of Geoffrey Martel had been torn from Anjou by the\r\nneighbouring powers. Saintonge and the Gatinais fell respectively into\r\nthe possession of the duke of Aquitaine and the king of France; and,\r\nmore important than all, the Angevin acquisition of Maine, the greatest\r\nwork of Geoffrey Martel, was reversed when in 1063 William of Normandy\r\nentered Le Mans and made arrangements for the permanent annexation of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe counts of Maine had never enjoyed such absolute sovereignty over\r\ntheir territory as was possessed by the greater feudatories of the\r\nFrench crown.[85] In addition to the usual vague claims which both\r\nNormandy and Anjou were always ready to assert over their weaker\r\nneighbours, and which nobody would take seriously when there was no\r\nimmediate prospect of their enforcement, the suzerainty of the king of\r\nFrance was much more of a reality over Maine than over Flanders or\r\nAquitaine. In particular the patronage of the great see of Le Mans\r\nrested with the king for the first half of the eleventh century; and\r\nthis was an important point, for the bishops of the period are prominent\r\nin the general history of the county. For the most part they are good\r\nexamples of the feudal type of prelate, represented in Norman history by\r\nOdo of Bayeux and Geoffrey of Coutances; and several of them were drawn\r\nfrom a house fertile in feudal politicians, that of the counts of\r\nBellême, whose great fief lay on the border between Maine and Normandy.\r\nThis connection of the episcopate of Le Mans with a great Norman family\r\nmight be taken as itself implying some extension of Norman influence\r\nover Maine were it not that the house of Bellême, half independent and\r\naltogether unruly, was quite as likely to work against its overlord as\r\nin his favour. In fact, it was largely through the Bellême bishops of Le\r\nMans that Angevin power came to be established in Maine for a while; the\r\nbishops were steadily opposed to the line of native counts, and looked\r\nto Anjou for a counterpoise. In particular, Bishop Gervase (1036–1058)\r\nbrought it about that King Henry made a grant of all the royal rights\r\nover the see to Count Geoffrey Martel for the term of his life, the\r\nbishop taking this step in pursuance of an intrigue against the guardian\r\nof the reigning count, who was at the time a minor. Having served his\r\nturn Gervase quickly fell into disfavour with Geoffrey and endured a\r\nseven years’ imprisonment at his hands; but it was through his false\r\nstep that Geoffrey first secured a definite legal position in Mancel\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe counts of Maine themselves are rather shadowy people, but it is\r\nnecessary to get a clear idea of their mutual relationships. Count\r\nHerbert, surnamed “_Eveille Chien_,” the persistent enemy of Fulk Nerra\r\nof Anjou and the last of his line to play a part of his own in French\r\naffairs, had died in 1035, leaving a son, Hugh IV., and a daughter,\r\nBiota, married to Walter of Mantes, count of the Vexin Français. Hugh,\r\nbeing under age, was placed under the governance of his father’s uncle,\r\nHerbert “Bacco,” the regent with whom Bishop Gervase was at enmity. When\r\nthe above-mentioned grant of the patronage of the bishopric of Le Mans\r\nto Geoffrey Martel had given the latter a decent pretext for\r\ninterference in the quarrel, the expulsion of Herbert Bacco quickly\r\nfollowed; and while the bishop was in captivity Geoffrey ruled the\r\ncountry in the name of the young count. Upon his death, in 1051,\r\nGeoffrey himself, in despite of the claims of Hugh’s own children, was\r\naccepted by the Manceaux as count of Maine—for it should be noted in\r\npassing that the Mancel baronage was always attached to Anjou rather\r\nthan to Normandy. The date at which these events happened is also worthy\r\nof remark, for it shows that during that rather obscure war in the\r\nMayenne valley which was described in the last chapter William of\r\nNormandy was really fighting against Geoffrey Martel in his position as\r\ncount of Maine. A legal foundation for Norman interference lay in the\r\nfact, which we have already noticed, that Bertha of Blois, the widow of\r\nHugh III., had escaped into Normandy, and that by her advice her son\r\nHerbert, the heir of Maine, had placed himself and his inheritance under\r\nthe protection of his host. William, seeing his advantage, was\r\ndetermined to secure his own position in the matter. He made an\r\narrangement with his guest by which the latter’s sister Margaret was\r\nbetrothed to his own son Robert, who here makes his first appearance in\r\nhistory, with the stipulation that if Hugh were to die without children\r\nhis claims over Maine should pass to his sister and her husband. We do\r\nnot know the exact date at which this compact was made, but it is by no\r\nmeans improbable that some agreement of the kind underlay that clause in\r\nthe treaty concluded with King Henry after Mortemer by which William was\r\nto be secured in all the conquests which he might make from Geoffrey of\r\nAnjou.\r\n\r\nOn the latter’s death in 1060 Norman influence rapidly gained the upper\r\nhand in Maine.[86] The war of succession in Anjou prevented either of\r\nthe claimants from succeeding to the position of Geoffrey Martel in\r\nMaine; and if Count Herbert ruled there at all during the two years\r\nwhich elapsed between 1060 and his own death, in 1062, it must have been\r\nunder Norman suzerainty. With his death the male line of the counts of\r\nMaine became extinct, and there instantly arose the question whether the\r\ncounty should pass to Walter, count of Mantes, in right of his wife\r\nBiota, the aunt of the dead Herbert, or to William of Normandy in trust\r\nfor Margaret, Herbert’s sister, and her destined husband, Robert,\r\nWilliam’s son. In the struggle which followed, two parties are clearly\r\nto be distinguished: one—and judging from events the least\r\ninfluential—in favour of the Norman succession, the other, composed of\r\nthe nationalists of Maine, supporting the claims of Biota and Walter.\r\nThe latter was in every way an excellent leader for the party which\r\ndesired the independence of the county. As count of the Vexin Français,\r\nWalter had been steadily opposed to the Norman suzerainty over that\r\ndistrict, which resulted from the grant made by Henry I. to Robert of\r\nNormandy in 1032. His policy had been to withdraw his county from the\r\nNorman group of vassal states, and to reunite it to the royal demesne;\r\nhe acknowledged the direct superiority of the king of France over the\r\nVexin, and he must have co-operated in the great invasion of Normandy in\r\n1053; for it was at his capital that the western division of the royal\r\nhost assembled before its march down the Seine valley. Even across the\r\nChannel the interests of his house clashed with those of William. Walter\r\nwas himself the nephew of Edward the Confessor, and his brother Ralph\r\nwho died in 1057 had been earl of Hereford. The royal descent of the\r\nVexin house interfered seriously with any claim which William might put\r\nforward to the inheritance of Edward the Confessor on the ground of\r\nconsanguinity. It is only by placing together a number of scattered\r\nhints that we discover the extent of the opposition to William which is\r\nrepresented by Walter of Mantes and his house, but there can be no doubt\r\nof its reality and importance.\r\n\r\nIn Maine itself the leaders of the anti-Norman party seem to have been\r\nWilliam’s own “man” Geoffrey of Mayenne and the Viscount Herbert, lord\r\nof Sainte-Suzanne. There is no doubt that the mass of the baronage and\r\npeasantry of the county were on their side, and this fact led William to\r\nform a plan of operations which singularly anticipates the greater\r\ncampaign of the autumn of 1066. William’s ultimate objective was the\r\ncity of Le Mans, the capital of Maine and its strongest fortress, the\r\npossession of which would be an evident sanction of his claims over the\r\ncounty. But there were weighty reasons why he should not proceed to a\r\ndirect attack on the city. Claiming the county, as he did, in virtue of\r\nlegal right, it was not good policy for him to take steps which, even if\r\nsuccessful, would give his acquisition the unequivocal appearance of a\r\nconquest; nor from a military point of view was it advisable for him to\r\nadvance into the heart of the county with the castles of its hostile\r\nbaronage unreduced behind him. He accordingly proceeded to the reduction\r\nof the county in detail, knowing that the surrender of the capital would\r\nbe inevitable when the whole country around was in his hands. The\r\ninitial difficulties of the task were great, and the speed with which\r\nWilliam wore down the resistance of a land bristling with fortified\r\nposts proves by how much his generalship was in advance of the\r\nleisurely, aimless strategy of his times. We know few particulars of the\r\nwar, but it is clear that William described a great circle round the\r\ndoomed city of Le Mans, taking castles, garrisoning them where necessary\r\nwith his own troops, and drawing a belt of ravaged land closer and\r\ncloser round the central stronghold of the county. By these deliberate\r\nmeasures the defenders of Le Mans were demoralised to such an extent\r\nthat William’s appearance before their walls led to an immediate\r\nsurrender. From the historical point of view, however, the chief\r\ninterest of these operations lies in the curiously close parallel which\r\nthey present to the events which followed the battle of Hastings. In\r\nEngland, as in Maine, it was William’s policy to gain possession of the\r\nchief town of the country by intimidation rather than by assault, and\r\nwith the differences which followed from the special conditions of\r\nEnglish warfare his methods were similar in both cases. London submitted\r\npeaceably when William had placed a zone of devastation between the city\r\nand the only quarters from which help could come to her; Le Mans could\r\nnot hope to resist when the subject territory had been wasted by\r\nWilliam’s army, and its castles surrendered into his hands. Nor can we\r\ndoubt that the success of this plan in the valleys of the Sarthe and\r\nMayenne was a chief reason why it was adopted in the valley of the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nAt Le Mans, as afterwards at London, William, when submission had become\r\nnecessary, was received with every appearance of joy by the citizens;\r\nhere, as in his later conquest, he distrusted the temper of his new\r\nsubjects, and made it his first concern to secure their fidelity by the\r\nerection of a strong fortress in their midst—the castle which William\r\nplanted on the verge of the precincts of the cathedral of Le Mans is the\r\nMancel equivalent of the Tower of London. And, as afterwards in England,\r\nevents showed that the obedience of the whole country would not of\r\nnecessity follow from the submission of its chief town; it cost William\r\na separate expedition before the castle of Mayenne surrendered. But the\r\nparallel between the Norman acquisition of Maine and of England should\r\nnot be pressed too far; it lies rather in the circumstances of the\r\nrespective conquests than in their ultimate results. William was\r\nfighting less definitely for his own hand in Maine than afterwards in\r\nEngland; nominally, at least, he was bound to respect the rights of the\r\nyoung Countess Margaret, and her projected marriage with Robert of\r\nNormandy proves that Maine was to be treated as an appanage rather than\r\nplaced under William’s immediate rule. And to this must be added that\r\nthe conquest of Maine was far less permanent and thorough than the\r\nconquest of England. The Angevin tendencies of the Mancel baronage told\r\nafter all in the long run. Before twelve years were past William was\r\ncompelled to compromise with the claims of the house of Anjou, and after\r\nhis death Maine rapidly gravitated towards the rival power on the Loire.\r\n\r\nWhile the body of the Norman army was thus employed in the reduction of\r\nMaine, William despatched a force to make a diversion by ravaging Mantes\r\nand Chaumont, the hereditary demesne of his rival,—an expedition in its\r\nway also anticipating the invasion which William was to lead thither in\r\nperson in 1087, and in which he was to meet his death. Most probably it\r\nwas this invasion, of which the details are entirely unknown, which\r\npersuaded Walter of Mantes to acquiesce in the _fait accompli_ in Maine;\r\nat least we are told that “of his own will he agreed to the surrender\r\n[of Le Mans], fearing that while defending what he had acquired by wrong\r\nhe might lose what belonged to him by inheritance.” Within a short time\r\nboth he and his wife came to a sudden and mysterious end, and there was\r\na suspicion afloat that William himself was not unconcerned in it. It\r\nwas one of the many slanders thrown upon William by Waltheof and his\r\nboon companions at the treasonable wedding feast at Exning in 1075 that\r\nthe duke had invited his rival and his wife to Falaise and that while\r\nthey were his guests he poisoned them both in one night. Medieval\r\ncredulity in a matter of this kind was unbounded; and a sinister\r\ninterpretation of Walter’s death was inevitably suggested by the fact of\r\nhis recent hostilities against his host.\r\n\r\nOne check to the success of William’s plans followed hard on the death\r\nof Walter and Biota. Margaret, the destined bride of Robert of Normandy,\r\ndied before the marriage could be consummated. In 1063 Robert himself\r\ncould not have been more than nine years old; while, although Margaret\r\nmust have reached the age of twelve, the whole course of the history\r\nsuggests that she was little more than a child, a fact which somewhat\r\ntends to discount the pious legend, in which our monastic informants\r\nrevel, that the girl shrank from the thought of marriage and had already\r\nbegun to practise the austerities of the religious profession. She left\r\ntwo sisters both older than herself, whose marriage alliances are\r\nimportant for the future history of Maine[87]; but their claims for the\r\npresent were ignored, and William himself adopted the title of count of\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about the time of these events (the exact date is unknown)\r\nWilliam was seized with a severe illness, which brought him to the point\r\nof death. So sore bestead was he that he was laid on the ground as one\r\nabout to die, and in his extreme need he gave the reliquary which\r\naccompanied him on his progresses to the church of St. Mary of\r\nCoutances. No chronicler has recorded this episode, of which we should\r\nknow nothing were it not that the said reliquary was subsequently\r\nredeemed by grants of land to the church which had received it in\r\npledge; yet the future history of France and England hung on the event\r\nof that day.[88]\r\n\r\nIt was probably within a year of the settlement of Maine that William\r\nengaged in the last war undertaken by him as a mere duke of the Normans,\r\nthe Breton campaign which is commonly assigned to the year 1064. As in\r\nthe earlier wars with Anjou, a border dispute seems to have been the\r\nimmediate occasion of hostilities, though now as then there were grounds\r\nof quarrel between the belligerents which lay deeper. Count Alan of\r\nRennes, William’s cousin and guardian, had been succeeded by his son\r\nConan, who like his father was continually struggling to secure for his\r\nline the suzerainty of the whole of Brittany as against the rival house\r\nof the counts of Nantes, a struggle which, under different conditions\r\nand with additional competitors at different times had now been going on\r\nfor more than a century. The county of Nantes at this particular time\r\nwas held by a younger branch of the same family, and there are some\r\nslight indications that the counts of Nantes, perhaps through enmity to\r\ntheir northern kinsmen, took up a more friendly attitude towards\r\nNormandy than that adopted by the counts of Rennes. However this may be,\r\nCount Conan appears in the following story as representing Breton\r\nindependence against Norman aggression; and when William founded the\r\ncastle of Saint James in the south-west angle of the Avranchin as a\r\ncheck on Breton marauders, Conan determined on an invasion of Normandy,\r\nand sent word to William of the exact day on which he would cross the\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nBy the majority of Frenchmen it would seem that Brittany was regarded as\r\na land inhabited by savages; in the eleventh century the peninsula stood\r\nout as distinct from the rest of France as it stands to-day. Its\r\ninhabitants had a high reputation for their courage and simplicity of\r\nlife, but they were still in the tribal stage of society, and their\r\nmanners and customs were regarded with abhorrence by the ecclesiastical\r\nwriters of the time. Like most tribal peoples they had no idea of\r\npermanent political unity; and the present war was largely influenced by\r\nthe fact that within the county of Rennes a Celtic chief named Rhiwallon\r\nwas holding the town of Dol against his immediate lord on behalf of the\r\nduke of Normandy.[89] Instead of invading Normandy as he had threatened,\r\nConan was driven to besiege Dol, and it was William’s first object in\r\nthe campaign to relieve his adherent there.\r\n\r\nWhat gives exceptional interest to the somewhat unimportant expedition\r\nwhich followed is the undoubted presence in William’s army of his future\r\nrival for the crown of England, Harold the earl of Wessex.[90] The\r\nreason for, and the incidents connected, with, his visit to Normandy\r\nwill have to be considered in a later chapter, but there cannot be any\r\nquestion as to its reality; and in a famous section, the Bayeux\r\ntapestry, our best record of this campaign, shows us Harold rescuing\r\nwith his own hand a number of Norman soldiers who were being swept away\r\nby the Coesnon as the army crossed the border stream of Brittany. On the\r\napproach of the Norman army Conan abandoned the siege of Dol and fell\r\nback on his capital of Rennes; but relations soon seem to have become\r\nstrained between Rhiwallon and his formidable ally, for we find\r\nRhiwallon remarking to William that it mattered little to the country\r\nfolk around Dol whether their substance were to be consumed by a Norman\r\nor a Breton army. Possibly it may have been the remonstrances of\r\nRhiwallon which induced William to retire beyond the Norman border, but\r\nwe are told that as he was in the act of leaving Brittany word was\r\nbrought to him that Geoffrey (_le Barbu_) count of Anjou had joined\r\nhimself to Conan with a large army and that both princes would advance\r\nto fight him on the morrow. It does not appear that William gave them\r\nthe opportunity, but the tapestry records what was probably a sequel to\r\nthis campaign in the section which represents William as besieging Conan\r\nhimself in the fortress of Dinan. From the picture which displays Conan\r\nsurrendering the keys of the castle on the point of his spear to the\r\nduke it is evident that the place was taken, but we know nothing of the\r\nsubsequent fortunes of the war nor of the terms according to which peace\r\nwas made. Within two years of these events, if we are right in assigning\r\nthem to 1064, Conan died suddenly,[91] and was succeeded by his\r\nbrother-in-law Hoel, count of Cornouaille, who united in his own person\r\nmost of the greater lordships into which Brittany had hitherto been\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SIEGE OF DINANT FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY]\r\n\r\nIt may be well at this point briefly to review the position held by\r\nWilliam at the close of 1064. With the exception of his father-in-law of\r\nFlanders, no single feudatory north of the Loire could for a moment be\r\nplaced in comparison with him. Anjou and the royal demesne itself were,\r\nfor different reasons, as we have seen, of little consequence at this\r\ntime. The influence of Champagne under its featureless rulers was always\r\nless than might have been expected from the extent and situation of the\r\ncounty; and just now the attention of Count Theobald III. was directed\r\ntowards the recovery of Touraine from the Angevin claimants rather than\r\ntowards any rivalry with the greater power of Normandy. Brittany indeed\r\nhad just shown itself hostile, but the racial division between _Bretagne\r\nBrettonante_ and the Gallicised east, which always prevented the duchy\r\nfrom attaining high rank among the powers of north France, rendered it\r\nquite incapable of competing with Normandy on anything like equal terms.\r\nWith the feudal lords to the east of the Seine and upper Loire William\r\nhad few direct relations, but they, like the princes of Aquitaine, had\r\nreceived a severe lesson as to the power of Normandy in the rout of the\r\nroyal army which followed the surprise of Mortemer. On the other hand,\r\nNormandy, threaded by a great river, with a long seaboard and good\r\nharbours, with a baronage reduced to order and a mercantile class hardly\r\nless prosperous than the men of the great cities of Flanders, would have\r\nbeen potentially formidable in the hands of a ruler of far less power\r\nthan the future conqueror of England. Never before had Normandy attained\r\nso high a relative position as that in which she appears in the seventh\r\ndecade of the eleventh century; and, kind as was fortune to the mighty\r\nenterprise which she was so soon to undertake, its success and even its\r\npossibility rested on the skilful policy which had guided her history in\r\nthe eventful years which had followed Val-es-dunes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denier of Conan II. of Brittany]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  See Halphen, _Comté d’Anjou_, p. 133.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  The history of Maine at this period has recently been discussed by\r\n  Flach, _Les origines de l’ancienne France_, vol. iii., p. 543–9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  The native Mancel authorities have little to say about the war of\r\n  1063, the course of which is described by William of Poitiers, 103 _et\r\n  seq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  See the table on page 506.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  Round. _Calendar of Documents Preserved in France_, No. 937.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  Rhiwallon was brother of Junquené, the archbishop of Dol, whose\r\n  presence at the Norman court during William’s minority has been noted\r\n  above.

If William had wished to remove\r\n  Conan the latter would certainly have died before William had sailed\r\n  for England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                 THE PROBLEM OF THE ENGLISH SUCCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Norman conquest of England was no new thing when the\r\nactual blow fell in the autumn of 1066. The fateful marriage of Ethelred\r\nand Emma, sixty years before, had made it impossible that the politics\r\nof the island and the duchy should ever again be independent of each\r\nother; it led directly to the English expedition of Robert of Normandy\r\nin 1034, and in Edward the Confessor it gave England a king who was half\r\na Norman in blood, and whose ideas of government were derived from the\r\npolitical conditions of his mother’s land. To whatever aspect of the\r\nhistory of this period we may turn, this Norman influence will sooner or\r\nlater become apparent; in religion and commerce, as in the narrower\r\nfield of politics, the Norman is working his way into the main current\r\nof English national life.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is somewhat apart from the question as to the date at\r\nwhich Duke William began to lay plans for carrying out the conquest of\r\nEngland in his own person. There are two unknown quantities in the\r\nproblem: the date at which it was generally recognised that Edward the\r\nConfessor would leave no direct heir to the English throne, and the\r\nking’s own subsequent intentions with respect to the succession. Had\r\nsuch an heir been forthcoming in 1066 we may be sure that his\r\ninheritance would have been undisturbed from the side of Normandy, for\r\nWilliam’s claim to succeed his childless cousin by right of\r\nconsanguinity was something more than a matter of form. Now Edward was\r\nmarried in 1045, being then in the very prime of life, and we must\r\ncertainly allow for the passage of a reasonable period of time before we\r\ncan feel certain that the politicians of England and Normandy were\r\ntreating the succession as an open question. In particular it is\r\ndifficult to be confident that in 1049, when the negotiations for the\r\nmarriage of William and Matilda of Flanders were in progress, the\r\nultimate childlessness of Edward the Confessor was known to be\r\ninevitable.[92]\r\n\r\nA similar uncertainty hangs over the plans which the Confessor formed in\r\nthe latter event for the future of his kingdom. His Norman blood, his\r\nearly residence in the duchy, and the marked predilection which he\r\nshowed for men of Norman race, very naturally lead to the impression\r\nthat, in the earlier part of his reign at least, his desire was to\r\nprovide for the transmission of his inheritance to his mother’s family.\r\nBut even this conclusion is not beyond question. Edward on his accession\r\nin 1042 occupied a most difficult position. After twenty-five years of\r\nDanish rule a very distinct party in the state wished to maintain the\r\nScandinavian connection. Edward’s recognition as king was mainly the\r\nwork of Earl Godwine and his party, and the earl expected and could\r\nenforce full payment for his services. Edward would have shown less than\r\nthe little intelligence with which he is to be credited if he had failed\r\nto see that some counterpoise to the power of his overmighty subject\r\nmight be found by giving wealth and influence to strangers from across\r\nthe Channel. Hence arose that stream of Norman immigration which\r\ndistinguishes the reign and the consequent formation of a royalist,\r\nnon-national party; for each individual settler must have understood\r\nthat all he might possess in the island depended on the king’s favour.\r\nSuch a policy was bound sooner or later to produce a reaction on the\r\npart of Godwine and his associates; and thus arose the famous crisis of\r\nthe autumn of 1051. Godwine, trying to reassert his influence in the\r\nstate, fails to carry with him the other earls of England in an attack\r\non the king’s favourites and is driven to flee the country. What Godwine\r\nresented was clearly the existence of a rival power at court, and the\r\napathy in his cause of such men as Leofric of Mercia and Siward of\r\nNorthumbria suggests that he was not recognised by them as in any real\r\nsense the champion of national as against foreign influences. With his\r\nflight the first period of the reign of Edward the Confessor ends, and\r\nin the interval before his restoration William of Normandy made his\r\nfirst appearance on the shores of England.\r\n\r\nOf this visit we know very little; the native chronicler of Worcester\r\nsimply tells us that “Earl William came from over sea with a great\r\ncompany of Frenchmen, and the king received him and as many of his\r\ncompanions as pleased him and let them go again.” The question at once\r\npresents itself, did Edward at this time make any promise of the English\r\ncrown to William? If he ever did make an explicit promise to this effect\r\nit can scarcely be placed at any other date, for this was the only\r\noccasion after Edward’s departure from Normandy in 1042 on which the\r\nking and the duke are known to have met in person. The fact that such a\r\npromise forms an essential part of the story of the Conquest as told by\r\nall Norman writers is an argument in its favour which would more than\r\ncounterbalance the natural silence of the English authorities, were they\r\nmuch better informed upon matters of high policy than is actually the\r\ncase. But, after all, the question is really of secondary importance,\r\nfor in the next year Godwine returned to power, and Edward for the rest\r\nof his reign seems to have made no serious attempt to disturb the\r\nascendency of the English party.\r\n\r\nThe death of Godwine in 1053 made little immediate difference to the\r\npolitical situation in general nor to the existing relations between\r\nNormandy and England. The succession of his son Harold to the earldom of\r\nWessex provokes no comment on the part of the contemporary chroniclers;\r\nthe semi-hereditary character of the great earldoms was by this time\r\nrecognised for all working purposes. Nevertheless, we can see that the\r\naccession of Harold to a provincial government of the first rank, and\r\nmost probably to the unofficial primacy in the state which had been held\r\nby Earl Godwine, takes place among the chief events in the sequence of\r\ncauses which ended in the great overthrow of 1066. On the other hand we\r\nshould not be led by the actual cause of the history into the assumption\r\nthat Harold’s designs upon the crown had already begun at this early\r\ndate. With all his personal weakness, King Edward’s own wishes were\r\nlikely to be the decisive factor in the choice of his successor, nor\r\nhave we any record that Harold opposed the candidate whom we know to\r\nhave received the king’s favour shortly after this time.\r\n\r\nThis candidate, whose appearance in the field with the king’s sanction\r\nwas likely to prove fatal to any aspirations to the throne in which\r\neither William or Harold might have begun to indulge, was Edward the\r\nEtheling, son of the famous Edward Ironside, and therefore nephew by the\r\nhalf-blood to the Confessor. He had been sent by Cnut into remote exile,\r\nand the summons which brought him back to England as its destined heir\r\nwas the work of King Edward himself. By a strange chance, immediately on\r\nhis arrival in 1057, and before he had even seen the king, the etheling\r\nfell ill and died,[93] and, although there was something about his end\r\nwhich was rather mysterious, there is nothing to suggest that it was\r\naccelerated in the interest of any other pretender to the crown. With\r\nhis death there really passed away the one promising chance of\r\nperpetuating the old English dynasty, for Edgar, the son of the dead\r\netheling, who was to live until 1126 at least, can only have been the\r\nmerest child in 1057.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR]\r\n\r\nIt would seem then that 1057 is the earliest possible year from which\r\nthe rivalry of William of Normandy and Harold Godwinson for the throne\r\nof England can be dated. The recall of Edward the Etheling suggests that\r\nit cannot be placed earlier, while the state of preparedness in which\r\nboth parties are found at the beginning of 1066 shows that their plans\r\nmust have been formed for some years at least before the Confessor’s\r\ndeath. And there is one mysterious episode which may very possibly have\r\nsome connection with the change in the succession question caused by the\r\ndeath of Edward the Etheling. In or about 1058 Earl Harold made a tour\r\non the continent, reaching as far as Rome, but also including Normandy\r\nand North France generally, and we are told that he made arrangements\r\nfor receiving help from certain French powers if he should need it at\r\nany time.[94] The passage in which we are told of these negotiations is\r\nvery obscure, but it is by no means improbable that Harold, when the\r\ndeath of the etheling had opened for him a possibility of succeeding to\r\nthe crown, may have tried to find allies who would hamper the movements\r\nof his most formidable rival when the critical time came. Also it is not\r\nwithout significance that 1058 is the year of Varaville, a date at which\r\nFrench jealousy of Norman power would be at its height. At any rate we\r\nmay at this point stop to consider the relative position occupied by the\r\nearl and the duke respectively with respect to their chances of\r\nsucceeding to the splendid inheritance of the oldest dynasty in Western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe first point which deserves discussion is the nature of the title to\r\nthe English crown. “Hereditary” and “elective,” the words which one\r\nnaturally contrasts in this connection, are terms of vague and\r\nfluctuating meaning in any case, while it has always been recognised\r\nthat neither can be employed in relation to the tenure of the crown at\r\nany period of English history without due qualification. To say simply\r\nthat the English monarchy was “elective” at the period with which we are\r\ndealing, is an insufficient statement unless we also consider the limits\r\nwithin which the choice lay on any given occasion, the process involved\r\nin the act of election, and the body which exercised the elective right.\r\nWith regard to the first of these matters there undoubtedly existed an\r\nancient and deep-seated feeling that a king should only be chosen from a\r\nkingly stock; in the eleventh century the sentiment still survived with\r\nwhich at an earlier period the nation had demanded that its rulers\r\nshould have sprung from the blood of the gods. This idea was far older\r\nthan any feeling of nationality, to which it might from time to time run\r\ncounter—it helps, for instance, to explain the ease with which the\r\nEnglish had accepted the royal Dane Cnut for their ruler—but with this\r\nhighly important reservation it is very improbable that the succession\r\nwas determined by anything which could be called general principles. The\r\ncrown would naturally pass to the most popular kinsman of the late\r\nruler, and the question of the exact relationship between the dead king\r\nand his heir would be a secondary matter.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Normandy was of sufficiently noble birth to satisfy the\r\npopular sentiment in the former respect, for Rollo himself was the scion\r\nof an ancient line of Norwegian chieftains. Harold on his mother’s side\r\ninherited royal blood, for Gytha, Earl Godwine’s wife, was descended\r\nfrom the family of the kings of Sweden; but whereas no writer near the\r\ntime remarks on this feature in Harold’s descent, the origin of the\r\n“jarls of Normandy” was still a living memory in the north. Far more\r\nimportant in every way, however, was the undoubted kinship between\r\nWilliam and King Edward, a fact which William made the very foundation\r\nof his claim and which was undoubtedly recognised by the men of the time\r\nas giving him an advantage which could not be gainsaid. At the present\r\nday, indeed, it is rather difficult to understand the influence\r\nexercised by the somewhat distant relationship which was all that united\r\nWilliam and Edward, especially in view of the fact that Edgar, son of\r\nEdward the Etheling, still continued the male line of the royal house of\r\nWessex. We can only explain it on the ground that in 1066 Edgar was\r\nunder the age at which he would be competent to rule independently, and\r\nthat the public opinion of the time would not accept a minor as king so\r\nlong as there existed another candidate connected with the royal house\r\nand capable of taking up the reins of government in his own hands. In\r\nfact, of the three candidates between whom the choice lay on the\r\nConfessor’s death William, after all, was the one who combined the\r\ngreatest variety of desirable qualifications. Edgar was nearest to the\r\nthrone by order of birth, but his youth placed him at a fatal\r\ndisadvantage; Harold was a man of mature years and of wide experience in\r\nthe government, but his warmest supporters could not pretend that he was\r\na kinsman of King Edward; William was already a ruler whose fame had\r\nspread far beyond the borders of his own duchy, and in the third\r\ngeneration he could claim a common ancestor with the dead king. Lastly,\r\nwe should remember that the fact which under modern conditions would\r\noutweigh all other considerations, the fact that William was a\r\nforeigner, was less important in the eleventh century than at any later\r\ntime. It was certainly a disadvantage, but one which was shared in a\r\nless degree by both William’s competitors: if he was a pure Norman,\r\nHarold was half a Dane, Edgar was half a German. The example of Cnut\r\nshowed that there was nothing to prevent a man of wholly foreign blood\r\nfrom receiving general acceptance as king of England; and if the racial\r\ndifferences which existed in the country prepared the way for his\r\nreception, something of the same work was done for William by those\r\nNormans who had flocked into England under King Edward’s protection.\r\n\r\nIn all those cases in which the late king had left no single, obvious,\r\nheir to the throne, the succession would naturally be settled by the\r\ngreat men of the land—by that informal, fluctuating body known as the\r\n“witan.” So far as we can tell, the witan would be guided in part by the\r\nprevailing popular opinion, but more effectually by the known wishes of\r\nthe dead sovereign with respect to his successor; we know, for instance,\r\nthat both these influences contributed to the election of Edward the\r\nConfessor himself.[95] It is, however, probable that, so far from the\r\nelective nature of the monarchy having been a main principle of English\r\ninstitutions from the earliest date, the idea was really an importation\r\nof the eleventh century. It has recently been suggested that the action\r\nof the witan in early times with regard to the choice of a new king was\r\nsomething which would be much better described as “recognition” than as\r\nelection in any modern sense, that there is no evidence to prove that\r\nthe witan behaved as a united body, and that it was the adhesion of\r\nindividual nobles to the most likely heir which really invested him with\r\nthe royal power.[96] According to this account, such traces of election\r\nin the wider sense as are discernible in the eleventh century may with\r\nprobability be set down to Danish influence, for the three Scandinavian\r\nnations had advanced much further than other Teutonic peoples in the\r\ndevelopment of their native institutional forms. But, even so, there is\r\nmuch in the history of the year 1066 to suggest that the older ideas\r\nstill prevailed: William claimed the throne by hereditary right and it\r\nwas the submission of Stigand, Edwin, Morcar, Edgar the Etheling, and\r\nthe citizens of London, not the vote of any set assembly, which gave\r\nsanction to his claim.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this anticipation we may now consider the most\r\nperplexing question in William’s life, the truth underlying the famous\r\nstory of Harold’s visit to Normandy and the oath which he there swore to\r\nWilliam. Unlike most questions relating to the eleventh century, the\r\ndifficulty in the present case arises from the wealth of our information\r\non the subject; with the exception of those purely English writers\r\nFlorence of Worcester and the authors of the Anglo-Saxon chronicle, the\r\nsignificance of whose silence will be seen shortly, every historical\r\nwriter of the fifty years succeeding the Conquest tells the story at\r\nlength, and no two writers tell the same story. And yet we cannot safely\r\nreject the tale as fabulous for two reasons: the silence of those who\r\nwrote with native sympathies proves that there was an element of truth\r\nin the Norman story which they did not feel themselves at liberty to\r\ndeny, while the rapid diffusion of the tale itself among writers widely\r\nseparated in point of place and circumstance would be unintelligible if\r\nit were the result of sheer invention. Nor is a story necessarily\r\nsuspicious because its details are romantic.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the tale is that Harold, happening, for reasons\r\ndiversely stated, to be sailing in the Channel, was driven by a storm on\r\nto the coast of Ponthieu, and that being thereby regarded as the lawful\r\nprey of the count he was thrown into prison at Beaurain, evidently to be\r\nheld to ransom. While Harold was in prison the Duke of Normandy became\r\napprised of the fact, and sending to Count Guy, who had become his\r\nfeudal dependant after the battle of Mortemer, William had Harold\r\nbrought with all honour into the duchy. For an indefinite time the earl\r\nstayed at the court of the duke, and even accompanied him on the Breton\r\nexpedition which was described in the last chapter; but before his\r\ndeparture he placed himself under some obligation to his host, the\r\nnature of which is the key to the whole matter, but with regard to which\r\nscarcely any two writers are in unison. There is no doubt that Harold\r\nbecame William’s man, and it would seem certain that he took an oath\r\nwhich bore some reference to the rivalry for the English throne in which\r\nboth were evidently engaged. Most writers make the essence of the oath\r\nto be a promise on the part of Harold to do all in his power to secure\r\nthe crown for William upon Edward’s death, and there is a powerful\r\ncurrent of tradition which asserts that Harold pledged himself to marry\r\none of William’s daughters. In other words, Harold undertook to\r\nrecognise William as king of England in due season, and to secure for\r\nhim the adhesion of such of the English nobility as were under his\r\ninfluence; his marriage with William’s daughter being doubtless intended\r\nto guarantee his good faith when the critical moment came. Such an\r\nagreement would still leave Harold obviously the first man in England;\r\nindeed the relationship which would have been created between William\r\nand Harold, if it had been carried into effect, would in some respects\r\nhave reproduced the relationship in which Edward the Confessor had stood\r\nwith regard to Earl Godwine in 1042. This fact makes it difficult to\r\nbelieve that Harold was necessarily acting under compulsion when he took\r\nthe oath; he had many rivals and enemies in England, and it was well\r\nworth his while to secure his position in the event of Edward’s death\r\nbefore his own plans were mature.[97]\r\n\r\nWilliam on his part had everything to gain by causing Harold to enter\r\ninto such an engagement. If the oath were kept William would have turned\r\na probable rival into an ally; if it were broken he would secure all the\r\nmoral advantage which would accrue to him from the perjury of his\r\nopponent. But there is no reason to believe that he insisted on Harold\r\ntaking the oath merely in order that he might break it, nor is there any\r\ngood authority for the famous story that William entrapped Harold into\r\ntaking a vow of unusual solemnity by concealing a reliquary beneath the\r\nchest on which the latter’s hand rested while he swore. It was\r\ninevitable that an incident of this kind should gather round it a\r\nmythical accretion: but the whole course of the history proves that some\r\nsuch episode really took place. William’s apologists could put it in the\r\nforefront of their narratives of the Conquest, and all subsequent\r\nwriters have dwelt upon it as a main cause of the invasion; yet,\r\nalthough scepticism is from time to time expressed upon this detail or\r\nthat, not one of the historians of the next century, some of whom were\r\npossessed of distinct critical powers, and had access to good sources of\r\ninformation, has given a hint that the whole story was a myth.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1066, King Edward died, and on Thursday, January 6th, Earl\r\nHarold was chosen as king by the Witan assembled at Westminster for the\r\nChristmas feast, and crowned that same day by Ealdred, archbishop of\r\nYork. We possess a circumstantial account of the last days of Edward,\r\nwritten only a few years after these events, which describes how the\r\nKing, within an hour of his death, had emphatically commended his wife\r\nand his kingdom to the care of Harold.[98] With little debate, as it\r\nwould seem, the last wishes of the last king of the line of Egbert were\r\ncarried into effect; Harold was chosen king forthwith, and on the same\r\nday the sanction of the church made the step irrevocable. England was\r\nnow committed to the rule of a king whose title to the crown depended\r\nsolely upon the validity of the elective principle, and whose success or\r\nfailure would depend upon the recognition which this principle would\r\nobtain among foreign powers, and upon the support which those who had\r\nchosen to accept him as their lord were prepared to extend to him,\r\nshould his claim be challenged. Under the circumstances the choice of\r\nHarold was perhaps inevitable. The dying wish of Edward could not with\r\ndecency be disregarded; the scene of the election lay in just that part\r\nof the country where the interest of the house of Godwine was at its\r\nstrongest; and if traditional custom were to be disregarded and the\r\nroyal line forsaken no stronger native candidate could have been found.\r\nOn the other hand, there could be no doubt that the event of that\r\nmemorable Epiphany was fraught with danger on every side. Even if it had\r\nnot thrown defiance to the most formidable prince in Europe, it founded\r\nan ominous precedent, it showed that the royal dignity was not beyond\r\nthe grasp of an aspiring subject, it exposed the crown to intrigues of a\r\nclass from which England, weak at the best as was its political\r\nstructure, had hitherto been exempt. The Norman Conquest was an awful\r\ncatastrophe; but at least it saved England from the perils of an\r\nelective monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HAROLD ENTHRONED\r\n  FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY]\r\n\r\nThe impression which the coronation of Harold made upon the politicians\r\nof Europe was unmistakable. From Rome to Trondheim every ruler to whom\r\nthe concerns of England were a matter of interest realised that a\r\nrevolutionary step had been taken. From the crude narrative of the Latin\r\nhistorian of the Norwegian kings, as from the conventional periods of\r\nthe papal chancery, we gather that the accession of Harold was regarded\r\nas an act of usurpation, although there is no unanimity as to the\r\npersonality of the rightful heir whom he had supplanted. Old claims,\r\nlong dormant, were revived; the kings of Norway and Denmark remembered\r\nthat England had once belonged to the Scandinavian world. Had Edgar the\r\nEtheling or William of Normandy been elected, murmurings from this\r\nquarter at least would no doubt have been heard, but they would have\r\nlost half their force: the former could have appealed to the prevailing\r\nsentiment in favour of hereditary right; the latter could in addition\r\nhave poured at once into England a military force sufficient to meet all\r\npossible invaders on equal terms. Harold had neither of these\r\nsafeguards, and his oath to William had given to the most powerful\r\nsection of his opponents an intelligible ground on which to base their\r\nquarrel. Seldom in any country has a new dynasty been inaugurated under\r\ncircumstances so full of foreboding.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, meant a corresponding increase of strength to\r\nWilliam. Vague as is our knowledge of the negotiations with the several\r\npowers whose good-will was desirable for his enterprise, we can see that\r\nhe brought them at least into a general attitude of friendly neutrality.\r\nWe are told that the Emperor Henry IV. promised the unqualified support\r\nof Germany if it should be needed,[99] and also that Swegen Estrithson\r\nof Denmark joined William’s side, though our informant adds that the\r\nDanish king proved himself in effect the friend of William’s enemies.\r\nThe French crown was, as we have seen, under the influence of Baldwin of\r\nFlanders, William’s father-in-law; and so long as a war of succession\r\ndistracted Anjou, William need fear no danger from that quarter. Maine\r\nwas a dependency of the Norman duchy. Nothing, in fact, in William’s\r\nhistory is more remarkable than the way in which, at the very moment of\r\nhis great attempt, the whole political situation was in his favour. No\r\ninvasion of England would have been possible before 1060, when King\r\nHenry of France and Geoffrey Martel were removed from William’s path,\r\nwhile the growth of King Philip to manhood and the formation of Flanders\r\ninto an aggressive anti-Norman state under Robert the Frisian would have\r\nincreased William’s difficulties a thousandfold if Edward the Confessor\r\nhad lived for five years longer. In great part William’s advantageous\r\nposition in 1066 was due to his own statesmanship; in no small degree it\r\nresulted from the discredit which the national cause of England suffered\r\nin the eyes of Europe from the election of Harold; but above all it must\r\nbe set down to William’s sheer good luck. William the Conqueror, like\r\nNapoleon, might have believed in his star without incurring the reproach\r\nof undue superstition.\r\n\r\nOf all William’s negotiations that which was most characteristic of the\r\ntemper in which he pursued his claim was an appeal to the head of the\r\nchurch to decide between his right and that of Harold:\r\n\r\n  “That no rashness might stain his righteous cause he sent to the Pope,\r\n  formerly Anselm, bishop of Lucca, asserting the justice of the war he\r\n  had undertaken with all the eloquence at his command. Harold neglected\r\n  to do this; either because he was too proud by nature, or because he\r\n  mistrusted his own cause, or because he feared that his messengers\r\n  would be hindered by William and his associates, who were watching all\r\n  the ports. The Pope weighed the arguments of both sides, and then sent\r\n  a banner to William as an earnest of his kingdom.”[100]\r\n\r\nThe nature of this transaction should not be misunderstood. By inviting\r\nthe papal arbitration William was in no sense mortgaging any of the\r\nroyal prerogatives in the island which he hoped to conquer. His action,\r\nthat is, does not in any way resemble the step which his descendent John\r\ntook a hundred and fifty years later, when he surrendered his kingdom to\r\nInnocent III. to be held thenceforward as a papal fief.[101] William was\r\nsimply submitting his cause to the court which was the highest\r\nrecognised authority in all matters relating to inheritance, and which\r\nwas doubly competent to try the present case, involving as it did all\r\nthe questions of _laesio fidei_ which arose out of Harold’s oath. Nor\r\nneed we doubt that the verdict given represented the justice of the case\r\nas it would be presented to the pope and his advisers; we know at least,\r\non the authority of Hildebrand himself, that it was not without an\r\nacrimonious discussion that judgment was given in favour of William. It\r\nwould seem, in fact, that it required all the personal influence that\r\nHildebrand could exercise to persuade the leaders of the church to\r\ncommit themselves to the support of claims which, if prosecuted, must\r\ninevitably lead to bloodshed. And in later years Hildebrand told William\r\nthat his action had been governed by his knowledge of the latter’s\r\ncharacter, and by the hope that when raised to a higher dignity he would\r\ncontinue to show himself a dutiful subject of the church.[102]\r\nHildebrand added that he had not been disappointed; and in fact the\r\nattraction of the great island of the west within the influence of the\r\nideas of the reformed papacy was worth the suppression of a few scruples\r\non the part of the Curia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HAROLD’S OATH\r\n  FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY]\r\n\r\nSeventy years afterwards the papal court was again called upon to\r\nadjudicate in a dispute relating to the succession to the English\r\nthrone, and this under circumstances which deserve notice here as\r\nillustrating the nature of William’s appeal. In 1136, immediately, it\r\nwould seem, after the coronation of Stephen, his rival, the Empress\r\nMatilda sent envoys to Pope Innocent II. to protest against the\r\nusurpation. Stephen, wiser in his generation than Harold, replied by\r\nsending his own representative, and the case was argued in detail before\r\na council specially convened for the purpose by the pope. Just as in the\r\nmore famous episode of 1066, the point on which the plaintiff’s\r\nadvocates grounded their case was the fact that the defendant had taken\r\nan oath to secure the succession of his rival; and it rested with the\r\npope to decide whether this oath were valid. It is with reference to\r\nthis last point that the parallel between the events of 1066 and 1136\r\nceases: in the latter case the pope by refusing to give judgment tacitly\r\nacquitted Stephen of the guilt of perjury; in 1066 Harold’s neglect to\r\nlay a statement of his case before the papal court produced its natural\r\nresult in the definite decision which was given against him.[103] In\r\neither case it will be seen that what is submitted to the Curia is a\r\nquestion of law, not of politics; the pope is not regarded as having any\r\nright to dispose of the English crown; he is merely asked to consider\r\nthe respective titles of two disputants.\r\n\r\nArmed thus with the sanction of the church there lay before William the\r\nserious task of raising an army sufficiently large to meet the military\r\nforce at his rival’s command on something like equal terms. Such an army\r\ncould not possibly be derived from Normandy alone, great as was the\r\nstrength of the duchy in comparison with its area. However favourable\r\nthe general outlook might be for William’s plans, he cannot have thought\r\nfor an instant of staking the whole resources of Normandy upon a single\r\nventure; a venture of which the possible results might be very brilliant\r\nbut of which the immediate risk was very great. Nor was it possible for\r\nWilliam by any stretch of feudal law to summon his vassals and their men\r\nto follow him across the Channel as a matter of right and duty; if he\r\nwere to obtain their support he was bound to place the expedition before\r\nthem as a voluntary enterprise. Thus stated there can have been little\r\ndoubt as to the response which would be made to his appeal. The Norman\r\nconquest of Naples and the Norman exploits in Spain had proclaimed to\r\nthe world the mighty exploits of which the race was capable, nor need we\r\nbelieve that the Normans themselves mistrusted their reputation. And\r\nalthough William’s contemporary biographer, anxious to display the\r\nmagnanimity of his hero, has represented the latter’s subjects as\r\nviewing the enterprise with dismay,[104] it is not really probable that\r\nthe Norman knighthood was seriously deterred from adventuring itself for\r\nunlimited gains in the rich and neighbouring island by the prospect of\r\nhaving to fight hard for them.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1066, but most probably after the termination of\r\nWilliam’s cause at Rome, a council of the Norman baronage met at\r\nLillebonne[105] to discuss the proposed invasion of England. It is plain\r\nthat what most exercised the minds of William and his barons was the\r\ndifficulty of building, equipping and manning a number of ships\r\nsufficient for the transport of the army within a reasonable time. In\r\nfact it seems probable that one special purpose of the council was to\r\nascertain the number of ships which each baron was prepared to\r\ncontribute towards the fleet—a matter which lay altogether outside the\r\ngeneral question of military service and could only be solved by\r\namicable agreement between the duke and his vassals taken individually.\r\nWilliam stipulated that the ships should be ready within the year; a\r\ndemand which to some at least appeared impossible of fulfilment; and,\r\nindeed, the creation of an entire fleet of transport vessels within six\r\nmonths is a wonderful illustration of the energy with which the Norman\r\nnobility adopted the cause of the duke. Transport vessels the ships\r\nwere, and nothing else, as is evident from the representation of them in\r\nthe Bayeux tapestry, and we are bound to conclude that it was well for\r\nWilliam that his passage of the Channel met with no serious opposition\r\non the part of Harold. As might be expected, the number of ships\r\nactually provided is very variously given by different writers.\r\nCuriously enough the most probable, because the lowest, estimate is made\r\nby a very late authority, the Norman poet Wace, who says that when he\r\nwas a boy his father told him that six hundred and ninety-six ships\r\nassembled at St. Valery. There have also come down to us several\r\nstatements of the contribution which the greater barons of Normandy made\r\nto the fleet, which are probably true in substance although the lists\r\ndiffer among themselves and the totals which they imply exceed the\r\nmodest figures presented by Wace.[106] It would appear that William’s\r\ntwo half-brothers headed the list; Robert of Mortain giving a hundred\r\nand twenty ships, Odo of Bayeux a hundred. The counts of Evreux and Eu,\r\nboth members of the ducal family, furnished eighty and sixty ships\r\nrespectively. William Fitz Osbern, Roger de Beaumont, Roger de\r\nMontgomery, and Hugh d’Avranches gave sixty ships each; Hugh de\r\nMontfort, fifty. Two men who do not appear in the subsequent history, a\r\ncertain Fulk the Lame and one Gerald, who, although styled the\r\nseneschal, is difficult to identify at William’s court, gave forty ships\r\neach. Thirty ships were given by Walter Giffard and by Vulgrin, bishop\r\nof Le Mans; and Nicholas, abbot of St. Ouen, and the son of Duke Richard\r\nIII. contributed twenty. An interesting figure in the list is Remi, the\r\nfuture bishop of Lincoln, who in 1066 was only almoner of Fécamp abbey,\r\nbut nevertheless provided a ship and manned it with twenty knights. The\r\nDuchess Matilda herself supplied the ship, named the _Mora_, which was\r\nto carry her husband. One fact stands out clearly enough on the surface\r\nof this list—the great bulk of the fleet was supplied by William’s\r\nkinsmen and by men whom we know to have enjoyed his immediate\r\nconfidence, and it is significant that we can recognise in this brief\r\naccount just those men who received the greatest spoils of the conquered\r\nland. Among these few names the future earldoms of Kent, Shrewsbury,\r\nHereford, Chester, Buckingham, Warwick, and Leicester are represented.\r\nDoubtless the rest of the Norman nobility in one way or another\r\ncontributed in proportion to its wealth, but we have just accounted for\r\nnearly eight hundred vessels, and it is clear that in the all-important\r\nmatter of the fleet William found his fullest support among his\r\nrelatives and personal friends.\r\n\r\nHow far this statement would hold good in relation to the army of the\r\nConquest is a question which we have no detailed means of answering.\r\nDoubtless the lords of Montfort, Longueville, Montgomery, and their\r\nfellows brought the full complement of their vassals to the duke’s\r\nmuster, but the essential fact in the composition of William’s army lies\r\nin the width of the area from which it was recruited. From every quarter\r\nof the French kingdom, and from not a few places beyond its borders,\r\nvolunteers crowded in to swell the Norman host. Brittany supplied the\r\nlargest number of such volunteers, and next to Brittany came Flanders,\r\nbut the fame of William’s expedition had spread beyond the Alps, and the\r\nNorman states in South Italy and Sicily sent their representatives.[107]\r\nAnd this composite character of the army which fought at Hastings had\r\ndeep and abiding results. A hundred years after the Conquest, Henry II.\r\nwill still be sending out writs addressed to his barons and lieges\r\n“French and English,” and the terminology here expresses a fact of real\r\nimportance. The line of racial distinction which was all-important in\r\nlater eleventh-century England was not between Englishmen and Normans,\r\nbut between Englishmen and Frenchmen. England fell, not before any\r\nprovince, however powerful, of the French kingdom, but, in effect,\r\nbefore the whole of French-speaking Europe, and, by her fall, she\r\nherself became part of that whole. For nearly a hundred years England\r\nhad been oscillating between the French and the Scandinavian world; the\r\nevents of 1066 carried her finally within the influence of Southern\r\nideas in religion, politics, and culture.\r\n\r\nThe French auxiliaries of William have often been described as\r\nadventurers, and adventurers in a sense no doubt they were. But the word\r\nshould not be pressed so as to imply that they belonged to a social rank\r\ninferior either to their Norman associates or to the English thegnhood\r\nwhom they were to displace,—there should be no talk of “grooms and\r\nscullions from beyond the sea”[108] in this connection. Socially there\r\nwas little to distinguish a knight or noble from Brittany or Picardy\r\nfrom Normans like Robert d’Oilly or Henry de Ferrers; nor, rude as their\r\nideas of comfort and refinement must seem to us, have we any warrant for\r\nsupposing that Wigod of Wallingford or Tochi the son of Outi had been in\r\nadvance of either in this respect. Like the Normans themselves the\r\nFrenchmen varied indefinitely in point of origin. Some of them were the\r\nyounger sons of great houses, some belonged to the lesser baronage, some\r\nto the greater; Count Eustace of Bologne might by courtesy be described\r\nas a reigning prince. Some of the most famous names in the succeeding\r\nhistory can be traced to this origin—Walter Tirel was lord of Poix in\r\nPonthieu, Gilbert of Ghent was the ancestor of the medieval earls of\r\nLincoln. But the best way of realising the prevalence of this non-Norman\r\nelement among the conquerors of England is to work through one of the\r\nschedules which the compilers of Domesday Book prefixed to the survey of\r\neach county, giving the names of its land-owners, and to note the\r\nproportion of “Frenchmen” to pure Normans. In Northamptonshire, for\r\nexample, among forty-three lay tenants there occur six Flemings, three\r\nBretons, and two Picards, and Northamptonshire in this respect is a\r\ntypical county.\r\n\r\nAt or about the time of the council of Lillebonne there is reason to\r\nbelieve that messages were passing between William and Harold concerning\r\nthe fulfilment of the fateful oath. It is fairly certain that William\r\ndemanded the surrender of the crown and Harold’s immediate marriage to\r\nhis daughter, agreeing in return to confirm him in his earldom of\r\nWessex, which last is probably what is meant when our rhetorical\r\ninformants tell us that William promised to grant half the kingdom to\r\nhis rival. Such negotiations were bound to fall through; Harold had gone\r\ntoo far to withdraw, even if he had been so minded, and William’s object\r\nin making these proposals could only have been to maintain in the eyes\r\nof the world the appearance of a lawful claimant deprived of his\r\ninheritance. Also we may be quite sure that the building of the fleet\r\nwas not interrupted during the progress of the negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of Harold’s reign began early. The weakness of his\r\nposition was revealed at the outset by the refusal of Northumbria to\r\naccept him as king, a refusal very possibly prompted by Earl Morcar, who\r\ncould not be expected to feel much loyalty towards the new dynasty. By\r\nmaking a special journey to York, Harold succeeded in silencing the\r\nopposition for the moment, and his marriage with Ealdgyth, the sister of\r\nEarls Edwin and Morcar, which may be dated with probability to about\r\nthis time,[109] was very possibly intended to conciliate the great\r\nmidland house. It would certainly serve as a definite assertion that\r\nHarold had no intention of fulfilling that part of his oath to William\r\nwhich pledged him to a marriage with the duke’s daughter, nor can we\r\ndoubt that Harold realised the expediency of providing an heir to his\r\ncrown with the least possible delay. At any rate he seems to have been\r\nenjoying a few weeks of tranquillity after his visit to York when he\r\nreceived an unmistakable intimation of the coming storm, which was none\r\nthe less ominous because its immediate results were insignificant.\r\n\r\nTostig, the dispossessed earl of Northumbria, had spent the winter of\r\n1065–6, as we have seen, with Baldwin of Flanders,[110] a fact which is\r\nsuggestive when we remember the relations between Baldwin and William of\r\nNormandy. It is evident that Tostig was spending the period of his\r\nbanishment in forming schemes for his restoration, and the fact that his\r\nbrother on becoming king dare not or would not recall him made him\r\ninevitably a willing tool of William’s policy. Accordingly, early in\r\n1066 Tostig moved from Flanders into Normandy, appeared at the duke’s\r\ncourt, and urged him on to an invasion of England. It is quite possible\r\nthat he was present at the assembly of Lillebonne; one writer goes so\r\nfar as to say that the arguments of Tostig contributed largely to\r\npersuade the Norman nobility to undertake the enterprise,[111] and\r\nWilliam may have derived some little advantage from the fact that he\r\ncould point to one man of high rank among the English nation as an\r\nadherent. But it would seem that Tostig was unwilling to await the\r\ndevelopment of his host’s plans, and in May he set off from the Cotentin\r\non an expedition of his own intended to ravage the English coasts. He\r\nlanded first in the Isle of Wight, where the inhabitants bought him off\r\nwith money and provisions, and then sailed, ravaging the coast of Sussex\r\nand Kent, until he came to Sandwich. At Sandwich he raised a small force\r\nof sailors, but at the same time the news of his expedition was brought\r\nto his brother in London, who at once set out for the Kentish coast.\r\nBefore he could reach Sandwich, however, Tostig had started northward\r\nagain and finally entered the Humber with sixty ships, harrying the\r\ncoast of Lindsey. Upon receiving the news Earls Edwin and Morcar, having\r\ncalled out the local fyrd, marched with it to the Humber and compelled\r\nTostig to take refuge in his ships. At this point Tostig was deserted by\r\nthe men of Sandwich whom he had impressed, and, his fleet being now\r\nreduced to twelve ships, he made his way to Scotland and spent the\r\nsummer, we are told, with King Malcolm.[112]\r\n\r\nTostig’s futile raid has an interest of its own in the glimpse which it\r\ngives us of the English defences just before the Norman invasion. The\r\nevidence of Domesday Book shows that an Anglo-Saxon king had some sort\r\nof naval force permanently at his disposal, and we know that Harold\r\nbuilt and manned a number of ships to keep the Channel against his\r\nNorman rival, but, from whatever cause, the English navy in this\r\ncritical year proved itself miserably ineffective.[113] A mere\r\nadventurer, with no foreign aid of any consequence and no local support\r\nin England, Tostig could still spread devastation with impunity along\r\nhalf the English coast. The story of Tostig’s expedition reads like a\r\nrevival of one of the Danish raids of the ninth century—the enemy sacks\r\na town, the fyrd are summoned and hurry to the spot to find that the\r\nraiders have just left to plunder the nearest unprotected locality.\r\nClearly the coast defences of England, for all the bitter experience of\r\nthe Danish wars, had made no real advance since the days of Alfred, and\r\nit is not unfair to remark that this fact reflects little credit upon\r\nthe statesmanship of Harold. He had himself been an exile and had made a\r\nbid for power by a piratical descent upon England very similar to the\r\npresent expedition of Tostig’s. If he really possessed the power, during\r\nthe last ten years of the Confessor’s reign, with which he is usually\r\ncredited, it should not have been impossible for him to create a naval\r\nforce strong enough to counteract such attempts for the future. The\r\nevents of 1066 are an excellent illustration of the influence of sea\r\npower in history; wind and weather permitting, an invader could land an\r\narmy in England at whatever time and place best suited him. As for\r\nTostig himself, his expedition had been ignominious enough, but before\r\nthe year was out he was to earn immortality by his association with the\r\nlast great Scandinavian invasion of England and by the part which he is\r\nmade to play in the magnificent saga of Stamfordbridge.\r\n\r\nThe summer visit of Tostig to Scotland must have been interrupted by\r\nanother voyage of greater distance and followed by most momentous\r\nconsequences. Very possibly he was dissatisfied with the amount of\r\nimmediate support which his claims had received from William of\r\nNormandy; at all events he now made application to a prince of higher\r\nrank, more restless spirit, and still more varied experience in the art\r\nof war. Although there are chronological difficulties in the story which\r\ncannot be discussed here, there can be little real doubt that Tostig in\r\nperson sailed to Norway, was received by Harold Hardrada, and incited\r\nthe most warlike king in Europe to an invasion of England. As a matter\r\nof fact it is probable that Harold Hardrada, like William of Normandy,\r\nwould have made his attempt even if Tostig had never come upon the\r\nscene; the passage of the English crown to a subject house, coming at a\r\ntime when there was a temporary lull in the chronic warfare between the\r\nthree Scandinavian powers, might remind the king of Norway that he could\r\nhimself, if he chose, put forward a decent pretext for an adventure\r\nwhich would be certain to bring him fame and might rival the exploits of\r\nSwegen and Cnut.[114] The extent of the preparations which Harold\r\nHardrada had evidently made for his enterprise would of itself suggest\r\nthat they were independent of the representations of the banished earl\r\nof Northumbria, while on the other hand Tostig plays too prominent a\r\npart in the Norwegian traditions of the expedition for us to reject his\r\nvoyage to Norway as mere myth, and his presence may have had some\r\ninfluence in determining the objective of the invaders when once they\r\nhad touched the shores of England.\r\n\r\nAfter making his appeal to Harold Hardrada, Tostig returned to Scotland\r\nand began to raise a force of volunteers there on his own account. Early\r\nin September the king of Norway set sail from the Sogne Fiord near\r\nBergen, due west to the subject earldom of the Orkneys and Shetlands,\r\nwhere he was joined by Paul and Erling, the two joint earls, and by a\r\nlarge reinforcement of the islanders.[115] From the Orkneys Harold\r\nsailed on without recorded incident as far as the Tyne, where he was\r\njoined, according to agreement, by Tostig with his Scottish auxiliaries,\r\nand then the combined force made for the Yorkshire coast and began\r\noffensive operations by a harrying of Cleveland. Passing southward the\r\ninvaders encountered an ineffectual resistance at Scarborough and along\r\nthe coast of Holderness, but were able to round Spurn Head without any\r\nopposition from the English fleet. The Humber and the inland waters of\r\nYorkshire lay open to Harold, and it would seem that as the Norwegian\r\nfleet sailed up the Ouse the English fleet retreated up the Wharfe, for\r\nHarold chose to disembark at Riccall, a village some five miles below\r\nthe confluence of these rivers. Riccall was chosen as the headquarters\r\nof the fleet, which could easily block at this point any attempt on the\r\npart of the English vessels to break out to the open sea while Harold\r\nand his army marched straight on York. At Fulford, two miles from the\r\ncity, the invaders met the fyrd of Yorkshire under Earls Edwin and\r\nMorcar, and the defeat of the local force led to the surrender of York\r\nfour days afterwards. The city was not put to the sack; hostages[116]\r\nwere exchanged between Harold and the men of York, and it was very\r\npossibly to await the delivery of further sureties from the rest of the\r\nshire that the king moved out of his new conquest to the otherwise\r\nundistinguished village of Stamfordbridge.\r\n\r\nOn the following day King Harold of England himself arrived at York.\r\nNews of what was happening in Yorkshire must have been brought to London\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity, for the battles of Fulford and\r\nStamfordbridge were fought, as men remarked at the time, within five\r\ndays of each other. Harold possessed the permanent nucleus of an army in\r\nthe famous body of “huscarles” who resided at his court, and with them\r\nhe dashed up the great road from London to York, taking along with him\r\nso much of the local militia of the counties through which he passed as\r\nhappened to fall in with his line of march. At Tadcaster, where the\r\nnorth road crosses the Wharfe, he found and inspected the English\r\n“fleet,” and on Monday, the 25th of September, one day after Harold\r\nHardrada had entered the capital of Northumbria, it opened its gates to\r\nHarold of England. At this time Harold can have done scarcely more than\r\npass through the city for the same day he covered the ten miles which\r\nseparate York from Stamfordbridge and fell unexpectedly upon the\r\nNorwegian army scattered in utter unpreparedness along either bank of\r\nthe Derwent. The Norwegians on the right, or York, bank of the Derwent\r\nwere driven into the river by the English attack, and then occurred a\r\nstrange incident of which the record, curiously enough, is only\r\npreserved in the chronicle of the distant monastery of Abingdon. It was\r\nessential for the English to get possession of the bridge which spanned\r\nthe unfordable river before the Norwegians on the left bank should have\r\ntime to form up in line of battle, and we are told:\r\n\r\n  “There was one of the Norwegians who withstood the Englishmen so that\r\n  they could not climb over the bridge and gain the victory. Then one of\r\n  the Englishmen shot with an arrow and that did nothing, and then came\r\n  another under the bridge and stabbed him underneath his coat of mail,\r\n  and then Harold king of the English came over the bridge and his army\r\n  with him.”[117]\r\n\r\nWe have no details of the struggle which must have raged along the\r\nrising ground on which the modern village of Stamfordbridge stands, nor\r\ndo we know with certainty how Harold Hardrada and Tostig fell, but it is\r\nclear that the result of that day’s fighting was an unequivocal victory\r\nfor the English; the men who had been left in charge of the Norwegian\r\nfleet at Riccall were willing to accept peace at Harold’s hands and were\r\nallowed to depart with their ships to Norway. Harold indeed in this\r\ngreat fight had proved himself a worthy inheritor of the crown of the\r\nWest Saxon kings, and it was a strange destiny which ruled that the last\r\nvictory in the struggle of three centuries between Englishman and\r\nNorthman should fall to no descendant of Egbert or Alfred, but to an\r\nEnglish king who was half a Northman himself by blood. But a stranger\r\ndestiny was it which ruled that one week should see the overthrow of the\r\nlast great invader from the north and the opening of a new era for\r\nEngland in the entry of the greater invader from beyond the Channel.\r\nHarold Hardrada fell at Stamfordbridge on Monday, William of Normandy\r\nlanded at Pevensey on Thursday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of Harold Hardrada]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  The scheme of policy which Green (_Conquest of England_, 522–524, ed.\r\n  1883) founded in relation to their marriage rests upon this\r\n  assumption.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Poem in _Worcester Chronicle_, 1057.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  _Vita Eadwardi Confessoris_ (R.

The building of the\r\nfleet was being pushed forward, and volunteers from kindred states were\r\ncontinually arriving to be incorporated in the Norman army; this much we\r\nmay infer from the fact that by August both fleet and army were ready\r\nfor the expedition, but we know scarcely anything as to William’s own\r\nmovements in the interval. On the fifteenth of June a council was held\r\nat Bonneville at which Lanfranc was appointed abbot of William’s new\r\nfoundation of St. Stephen’s Caen, and three days later Cicely, the\r\neldest daughter of William and Matilda, was formally dedicated to the\r\nreligious life at the consecration of her mother’s house, the sister\r\nmonastery of the Holy Trinity. The motives which prompted the duke and\r\nduchess to complete their religious undertakings were widely felt among\r\nthe Norman baronage. The conquerors of England appear in a somewhat\r\nunaccustomed light as we read the charters by which they gave or\r\nconfirmed land, each to his favoured monastery, “when Duke William was\r\nsetting out across the sea.” It was fully realised that the enterprise\r\nmight end in utter disaster; the prudent abbot of Marmoutier, for\r\ninstance, in case of accidents, secured from Robert, the heir of\r\nNormandy, at his father’s request, a confirmation of all the grants\r\nwhich the latter had made to the house during his reign.[118]\r\n\r\nThe temporal affairs of Normandy were also discreetly arranged at this\r\ntime. Matilda was appointed regent, and was supported by a council\r\npresided over by Roger de Beaumont, a man of age and experience, and a\r\npersonal friend of the duke. No doubt if William had perished in England\r\nRobert would have succeeded him, but, although he was now of sufficient\r\nage to make a voluntary confirmation of his father’s grants of land, he\r\nwas clearly not old enough to undertake the government of the duchy\r\nduring an interregnum. The fact that the expedition itself provided\r\nemployment for the great mass of the fighting men of Normandy would\r\npromise a quiet rule for Matilda and her advisers, nor indeed do we hear\r\nof any disturbances taking place in the duchy while William was across\r\nthe Channel.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of August the fleet was ready at last, and lay at the\r\nmouth of the Dive ready to set sail at any moment.[119] The army also\r\nwas ready for embarkation, and the only thing which was lacking to the\r\nexpedition was a south wind to carry the fleet to the Sussex coast. But\r\nfor six weeks at least that south wind refused to blow, and every week\r\nof delay increased William’s difficulties a hundredfold. Nothing could\r\nhave been more discouraging to an army of adventurers than week after\r\nweek of compulsory inaction; and the fact that William was able to keep\r\nperfect order, among a force part only of which owed direct allegiance\r\nto him as feudal lord, suggests that he possessed qualities of\r\nleadership which were not very common among the captains of his day. At\r\nmore than one crisis in his life William had already shown that he could\r\npossess his soul in patience until the moment arrived at which it was\r\npossible to strike, and he must have succeeded in imparting something of\r\nthis spirit to his troops in their vigil by the Dive. In the more\r\ndefinite work of commissariat we know that he proved himself a master;\r\nfor no shortage of provisions was felt at any time during the unexpected\r\ndelay, and few eleventh-century armies could have remained for a month\r\nin the same quarters without being driven to find their own means of\r\nsubsistence in plunder. William’s biographer was justified in remarking\r\non the fact that the unarmed folk of the neighbourhood could pass to and\r\nfro without trembling when they saw a body of soldiers;[120] and before\r\nthe task of provisioning the army by regular means had become an\r\nimpossibility, a west wind served to carry the fleet to a point which\r\noffered a shorter passage across into England than that which was\r\npresented by its original station on the Dive.\r\n\r\nWithin the county of Ponthieu, which had become a member of the Norman\r\ngroup of vassal states when Count Guy became William’s “man” after the\r\nbattle of Mortemer, the estuary of the Somme supplied an excellent\r\nnatural harbour beneath the town of Saint Valery. The passage from the\r\nmouth of the Dive seems to have been accomplished without incident, and\r\nWilliam and his forces took possession of their new quarters on the\r\ntwelfth day of September. For more than a fortnight the situation did\r\nnot seem to have improved in any way; the wind which was carrying Harold\r\nHardrada down the coast of Yorkshire kept William locked in the mouth of\r\nthe Somme. The weather was cold and squally and we have a contemporary\r\ndescription of the way in which William kept watching the weathercock on\r\nthe church tower and of his joy if for a moment the gale drove it to\r\npoint northward.[121] The strain of suspense was now beginning to tell\r\nupon the army:\r\n\r\n  “The common soldiers, as frequently happens, began to murmur in their\r\n  tents that the man must be mad to wish to conquer a foreign country,\r\n  that his father had proposed to do the same and had been baffled in\r\n  the same way, that it was the destiny of the family to try for things\r\n  beyond their reach and to find God for their enemy.”[122]\r\n\r\nIt was clearly necessary to do something to relieve the prevailing\r\ntension, and the expedient chosen was characteristic of the time; the\r\nrelics of the patron saint of the town were brought with great solemnity\r\nout of the church, and the casket which contained them was exhibited to\r\nreceive the prayers and offerings of the duke and his army. The result\r\nwas a convincing proof of the virtue of the bones of St. Valery; without\r\nfurther delay the south wind blew.[123]\r\n\r\nThe same day saw the embarkation of the Norman army, the work being\r\ncarried through as quickly as possible in evident fear that the wind\r\nmight slip round again to its former quarter. Night was falling before\r\nall was ready, and before the duke, after a final visit to the church of\r\nSt. Valery, had given his last orders on the Norman shore. It was\r\nimportant that the fleet should be prevented from scattering in the\r\ndarkness, so each vessel was ordered to carry a light, a lantern of\r\nspecial power adorning the masthead of the duke’s own ship. With the\r\nsame object it was directed that the fleet should anchor as soon as it\r\nwas clear of the estuary of the Somme, and await further orders. Through\r\nthe dead of night the fleet hung outside the harbour, and it was still\r\ndark when the expedition ventured out at last into the open waters of\r\nthe Channel. The great body of the ships, each of which carried a heavy\r\nload of horses in addition to its freight of men-at-arms, was inevitably\r\noutstripped by the unimpeded galley which bore William to his destiny;\r\nand when the dawn began to break, the duke found himself out of sight of\r\nthe rest of the fleet, and not yet within view of the English shore. In\r\nthese circumstances William cast anchor and breakfasted “as it had been\r\nin his own hall,” says one of his companions; and, under the influence\r\nof the wine with which the _Mora_ was well supplied, his spirits rose,\r\nthe prospects of his enterprise seemed golden in the morning light, and\r\nhe spoke words of encouragement to his companions. And at last the\r\nsailors reported that the rest of the fleet began to come in sight; the\r\nfour ships which first appeared together upon the horizon grew more and\r\nmore until the man on the look-out could be made by our imaginative\r\ninformant to remark that the masts of the fleet showed like a forest\r\nupon the sea.[124] Then the duke weighed anchor for the last time, and\r\nthe south wind still holding carried him and his fleet into Pevensey bay\r\nat nine in the morning; the day being St. Michael’s Eve—by an\r\nappropriate chance, for the archangel was highly honoured in the Norman\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWilliam’s landing was entirely undisputed; the good luck which, as we\r\nhave noticed, waited on his expedition in its diplomatic antecedents,\r\nattended its military details also. During the summer months, Harold,\r\nmaking what use he could of the antiquated military system of England,\r\nhad called out the fyrd, and lined the south coast with troops, which,\r\nhowever helpless they might be in a pitched battle with the Norman\r\nchivalry, might have brought considerable inconvenience to William, if\r\nthey had been in evidence at the moment of his landing. From May to\r\nSeptember the Sussex coast in general, Hastings and Pevensey in\r\nparticular, were guarded by the rural forces of the shire.[125] At last,\r\nabout the time when William was moving from the Dive to St. Valery, the\r\npatience and provisions of the fyrd gave out together; the rustics had\r\nbeen kept away from their homes for four times the customary period of\r\nservice without anything happening, and they refused to stay on guard\r\nany longer. They probably would not have made any difference to the\r\nultimate result in any case, nor need we blame Harold for being unable\r\nto keep them together; but the fact is another illustration of the\r\nhopeless inefficiency of the old English state. And then, one week\r\nbefore William’s landing, Harold had gathered the whole of such\r\nprofessional soldiers as England contained, and had spent them in the\r\nlife-and-death struggle at Stamfordbridge. Harold Hardrada had fallen,\r\nbut his overthrow had gone far to exhaust the military resources of\r\nEngland, and it was a shattered, if victorious, army which was resting\r\nwith Harold Godwinson, at York, when a fugitive from Sussex arrived to\r\ntell that William of Normandy had landed, and that the south lay at his\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nWilliam’s first movements in England were very deliberate. His immediate\r\ncare was to fortify his position at Pevensey and so protect his fleet\r\nagainst surprise. At Pevensey, as afterwards at Lincoln, a line of Roman\r\nwalling could be turned to account in the construction of a castle,[126]\r\nwhich was run up in the course of the day; and having thus, like his\r\nScandinavian ancestors, secured for himself a base of operations if\r\nevents turned out ill, William marched to Hastings, which was to be his\r\nbase of operations for the rest of the campaign.[127] At Hastings,\r\ntherefore, another castle was thrown up, the building, like nearly all\r\nthe castles built during the twenty years which followed the Conquest,\r\nconsisting merely of a mound, with wooden defences on the top and a\r\nditch and one or more outer works below. Hastings is a point of\r\ndeparture for many roads; a fact which no doubt very largely accounts\r\nfor William’s choice of the town as his headquarters; for it could\r\neasily be provisioned by supplies from the neighbouring country, and it\r\nlay very conveniently as a base for an attack on London.\r\n\r\nThe men of east Sussex were not long before they felt the pressure of\r\nthe invading army. Most of the villages in the neighbourhood of Hastings\r\nare recorded in Domesday to have been “waste” at some period between the\r\ndeath of King Edward and 1066, and the connection between these signs of\r\nravage and William’s camp at Hastings is sufficiently obvious. But it is\r\nnot probable that William attempted any systematic harrying of this\r\ndistrict such as that which three years afterwards he carried out with\r\ngrim success in the country beyond the Humber; the Sussex villages, as a\r\nrule, had quite recovered their former prosperity by the date of the\r\ngreat survey. The passage of foraging parties over the land demanding\r\nprovisions, which would be none too readily granted, and the other\r\nincidents of a medieval war of invasion, are enough to account for\r\ndepreciation of the kind recorded. Harold himself, as he drew towards\r\nHastings, left traces of his march in similar cases of temporary\r\ndevastation, and there is no reason to suppose that William undertook a\r\ndeliberate harrying of Sussex in order to provoke Harold to a general\r\nengagement.[128]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BUILDING OF HASTINGS CASTLE FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY]\r\n\r\nWilliam, indeed, as yet can hardly have known the result of\r\nStamfordbridge with any degree of certainty. Rumours of the great battle\r\nin the north would no doubt gradually filter down into Sussex during the\r\nweek following the event, but for some days after his arrival at\r\nHastings William cannot have ignored the possibility that it might be a\r\nNorwegian host which would ultimately appear upon the edge of the downs.\r\nDefinite news, however, at some unspecified date, was brought to William\r\nby a message from an unexpected quarter.[129] Robert, the son of Wymarc,\r\na Breton knight, who in some unknown way could claim kindred with both\r\nWilliam and Edward, had been “staller” or master of the horse to the\r\nlatter, and had stood together with Harold and Stigand by the king’s\r\ndeathbed. Whether he had actually been present at the battle of\r\nStamfordbridge is uncertain; but shortly after the fight he sent a\r\nmessenger to William to advise a speedy withdrawal to Normandy before\r\nsomething worse happened to him. The message ran that Harold had\r\ndestroyed the huge forces of the king of Norway, himself the bravest man\r\nin the world, and that now, inspired by victory, he was turning upon the\r\nduke with a great and enthusiastic army. Rather unwisely Robert went on\r\nto add that the Normans were no match for the English, either in numbers\r\nor bravery, and that William, who had always shown himself discreet\r\nhitherto, would do well to retire at once, or at all events to keep\r\nwithin his fortifications and avoid a battle in the open field. To this\r\nwell-meaning person William replied that his one desire was to come to\r\nblows with Harold, that although Robert’s advice might have been better\r\nexpressed yet he thanked him for it, and that if he had with him but ten\r\nthousand instead of sixty thousand men[130] he would never retire\r\nwithout wreaking vengeance on his enemy. It is not unlikely that\r\nRobert’s message was really inspired by Harold himself, and from one or\r\ntwo turns of expression in William’s reply we may perhaps gather that he\r\nsuspected as much; although it might be thought that Harold, who had\r\nseen something of his rival in past years, cannot have had much hope of\r\ngetting rid of him by mere intimidation. However this may be, it is\r\ninteresting to find Robert, a prominent member of a class which has\r\nsuffered much abuse because of an assumed lack of patriotism towards its\r\nadopted country, playing a part which so admirably saves his duty to his\r\nking and his kinsman alike.\r\n\r\nWe have two poetical accounts of the way in which the news of William’s\r\nlanding was brought to Harold at York. Wace, the Norman poet of the\r\ntwelfth century, tells how a Sussex “chevalier” heard the shouting of\r\nthe “peasants and villeins” as the fleet drew in to the shore, and how,\r\nattracted by the noise, he came out, hid behind a hill and lay there\r\nuntil the work of disembarkation was over and the castle at Pevensey\r\nthrown up; then riding off with lance and sword, night and day, to York,\r\nto tell the king the news of what he had seen.[131] Guy, bishop of\r\nAmiens, who wrote within a short time of the event, makes the news of\r\nthe Norman arrival be borne by a rustic from Hastings, not Pevensey; and\r\nthe details which are told to Harold relate to the devastation caused by\r\nthe invaders near Hastings, not to the landing itself.[132] Perhaps\r\nthese two stories are not quite incompatible with each other; but we\r\nneed not attempt to reconcile them here, in view of the undoubted fact\r\nthat Harold was informed of William’s landing within some three days of\r\nthe event.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis Harold acted with astonishing energy. Taking with him his\r\nfaithful huscarles, a body sadly thinned by the battle of a few days\r\nbefore, he hurried southwards by way of Tadcaster, Lincoln, Stamford,\r\nand Huntingdon, the same route which in the reverse direction he had\r\nfollowed in the previous week; now as then drawing into his force the\r\nfyrd of the shires through which he passed. Edwin and Morcar were\r\ndirected to raise the levies of their respective earldoms, and in their\r\nexpected absence the government of the north was entrusted to\r\nMarleswegen, the sheriff of Lincolnshire,[133] an Englishman who remains\r\nlittle more than a name in the narrative of the Conquest, but who, if\r\nHarold had triumphed at Hastings might probably have played an important\r\npart in the history of the following years. How far Harold really\r\nbelieved in the fidelity of the northern earls is uncertain; they had\r\nshown no overt signs of disaffection during the last months since he had\r\nmarried their sister. On the other hand, considering the long-standing\r\nrivalry between his house and theirs, and their probable share in the\r\nNorthumbrian difficulties at the beginning of his reign, Harold was\r\nperhaps not altogether surprised that Edwin and Morcar, in the words of\r\nFlorence of Worcester, “withdrew themselves and their men from the\r\nconflict.” With the best intentions they would have found it difficult\r\nto join him in time for the battle; it would not have been easy for them\r\nto raise the fyrd from all the shires between the Humber and the Tweed\r\non the one part and between the fens and the Severn on the other, and to\r\nbring the troops to London within the five days which Harold spent\r\nthere. For on October 11th,[134] a fortnight after the battle of\r\nStamfordbridge, Harold set out from London on his last march towards the\r\nSussex downs.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting, but not very profitable, speculation how far\r\nHarold was justified in staking his all upon the result of a single\r\nbattle with the invader. With our knowledge of what happened it is\r\nnatural to condemn him; he was condemned by the general opinion of the\r\nhistorians of the next generation, and very possibly their sentence is\r\nright. On the other hand we cannot but feel that we know very little of\r\nthe real facts of the case; even the essential question of the relative\r\nnumbers of the English and Norman armies cannot be answered with any\r\ndegree of accuracy. It may be argued with much plausibility that the\r\nwisest course for Harold would have been to let William work his will\r\nupon the unfortunate inhabitants of Sussex, trusting to time and the\r\nnational feeling likely to be aroused by the ravages of an invader to\r\nbring an overwhelming superiority in numbers over to his side. This, we\r\nmay be sure, would have been the course taken by William himself in such\r\na case, but Harold was probably by nature incapable of playing a waiting\r\ngame of this kind. His ability, so far as we can tell, lay in sudden\r\nassaults and surprises; the more deliberate processes of generalship\r\nwere foreign to his temperament. And then there remains the fact that\r\nthe loyalty of Mercia and Northumbria was at least doubtful; delay on\r\nHarold’s part might only mean that Edwin and Morcar with their forces\r\nwould have time to come over effectively to William’s side, while\r\nanother great victory so soon after Stamfordbridge would have placed\r\nHarold in a position from which, for the time being, he could defy all\r\nrivals. At any rate he took the step, and paid the penalty of failure.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever we may think of the general wisdom of Harold’s strategy,\r\nit is impossible to deny that he showed a general’s appreciation of the\r\ntactical possibilities of the ground on which he chose to put the fate\r\nof England to the test. After a forced march through the thick woods\r\nwhich at that time covered the Sussex downs, the king halted his army on\r\na barren ridge of ground seven miles north-east of the town of Hastings.\r\nIt is plain from all the narratives of the forthcoming encounter that\r\nthe ridge in question was quite unoccupied at the time of the battle;\r\nand when the English chroniclers wish to describe its site they can only\r\ntell us that Harold and William came together “by the hoar\r\napple-tree.”[135] The strength of the position was determined, not so\r\nmuch by the general elevation of the ground, which at no point reaches a\r\ngreater height than 300 feet above sea level, as by the fact that it was\r\nsurrounded by country very hilly and much broken by streams, and that\r\nits physical features lent natural support to the disposition of an army\r\nwhich relied for success on its capacity for stolid resistance. The\r\nposition was undoubtedly chosen by Harold with the object of forcing his\r\nenemy to an immediate battle; for William could not move either east or\r\nwest from Hastings without exposing his base to an English attack; and\r\nHarold, who knew that the main strength of a Norman army lay in its\r\ntroops of mailed horsemen, had been careful to offer battle on a site in\r\nwhich the cavalry arm would be placed by the ground at a natural\r\ndisadvantage.[136]\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the case it has come about that we possess very\r\nlittle information either as to the numbers of the English army or as to\r\nthe details of its formation on the day of battle. The Norman writers,\r\non whom we are compelled to rely, have naturally exaggerated the former,\r\nnor did any survivor from the English army describe the order of its\r\nbattle array to the chroniclers of Worcester or Peterborough. In recent\r\nstudies of the great battle there is manifested a strong unwillingness\r\nto allow to either the English or the Norman host more than a small\r\nproportion of the numbers which used to be assigned to it thirty years\r\nago.[137] It is very improbable that William led more than 6000 men into\r\naction on October 15, 1066, and there is good reason for doubting\r\nwhether the knightly portion of his army can have exceeded 5000. Small\r\nas this last number may appear, every man included in it was an\r\nefficient combatant; but the English force was largely composed of\r\nrustics impressed from the shires through which Harold had rushed on his\r\ngreat march from York to London after the battle of Stamfordbridge, and\r\neven so, it is far from certain that the native force was materially\r\nstronger than the army of invasion. With regard to its distribution, we\r\nknow that the English line of battle seemed convex to the Normans on\r\ntheir approach from the south-east,[138] and it is probable that it ran\r\nfor some 800 yards along the hill of battle, the flanks being thrown\r\nwell back so as to rest upon the steep bank which bounds the ridge\r\ntowards the north. It is certain that the English troops were drawn up\r\nin extremely close order, and it is a natural assumption that Harold\r\nwould place the kernel of his army, the huscarles who had survived\r\nStamfordbridge, in the front rank; stationing his inferior troops in the\r\nrear so as to support the huscarles in resisting the impact of the\r\nNorman cavalry.[139] On the highest point of the whole line, a spot now\r\nmarked by the high altar of the Abbey church of Battle, Harold planted\r\nhis standard; and it was round the standard that the fight was most\r\nstoutly contested, and that, after seven hours of struggle, the king at\r\nlast fell.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the generalship displayed by Harold’s rival on this\r\noccasion, it is important to beware of the associations aroused by\r\nmodern military terminology. At least if we speak of him as a strategist\r\nor tactician, we should be careful to remember that strategy and tactics\r\nthemselves had attained to but a rudimentary stage of development in\r\nNorthern Europe in the eleventh century. Recent studies of the battle of\r\nHastings, the one fight of the period in regard to which we possess a\r\nconsiderable amount of detailed information, have brought out the fact\r\nthat William’s host was far too stiff and unwieldy a body to perform the\r\ncomplicated evolutions by which it used to be assumed that the day was\r\nwon.[140] We should be committing a grave error if we were to suppose\r\nthat the Norman army possessed that mobility and capacity for concerted\r\naction among its several divisions which belonged to the forces led by\r\nTurenne or Marlborough. Feudal battles were determined more by the event\r\nof simple collisions of large masses of men than by their manœuvres\r\nwhen in the field: the skill of a great feudal captain lay chiefly in\r\nhis ability to choose his ground so as to give his side the preliminary\r\nadvantage in the shock of battle; apart from the example of his personal\r\nvalour he had but little influence upon the subsequent fortunes of the\r\nday. On the present occasion William was compelled to fight on the\r\nground of his opponent’s choice; and this initial disadvantage cost the\r\nNorman leader an indefinite number of his best troops, and, even after\r\nthe issue of the battle had been decided, protracted the English\r\nresistance until nightfall had put an end to the struggle. On the other\r\nhand, there was one fatal weakness in the English host which must have\r\nbeen recognised by the other side already before the fight had begun.\r\nThe fact that Harold, for all effective purposes, was totally unprovided\r\nwith either archers or cavalry exposed his army to a method of attack\r\nwhich he was quite unable to parry, and the arrangement of the Norman\r\nline of battle shows that William from the first relied for success on\r\nthis advantage. The battle of Hastings was won by the combination of\r\narchery and cavalry against infantry whose one chance of success lay in\r\nthe possibility that it might keep its formation unbroken until the\r\nstrength of the offensive had been exhausted.[141]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE DEATH OF HAROLD\r\n  (FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY)]]\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of the 14th of October the Norman army moved out of\r\nHastings and advanced across the seven miles of broken country which lay\r\nbetween the English army and the sea. The march must have been a\r\ntoilsome business, and the rapidity with which it was accomplished is\r\nremarkable.[142] At the point marked by the modern village of Telham,\r\nthe road from Hastings to Battle passes over a hill which rises to some\r\n350 feet above sea-level, and commands a view of the English position.\r\nOn the far side of this hill it is probable that William halted, waited\r\nfor his scattered troops to come together, and then drew them out in\r\norder of battle. In his first line he placed his light-armed infantry,\r\nwho probably formed a very inconsiderable portion of his army, and were\r\nunprovided with defensive harness. To these inferior troops succeeded\r\ninfantry of a higher class, protected by armour, but, like the\r\nlight-armed skirmishers in the front rank, armed only with bows and\r\narrows and slings. The function of the infantry in the coming encounter\r\nwas to harass the English with their missiles and tempt them to break\r\ntheir ranks. Lastly came the main body of the Norman army, the squadrons\r\nof cavalry, on whom it rested to attack the English line after it had\r\nbeen shaken by the missiles of the previous ranks.[143] The whole army\r\nwas further arranged in three great divisions, the native Normans\r\ncomposing the centre, the Bretons, under the command of Alan, son of\r\nCount Éon of Penthievre, forming the left wing, and the French\r\nvolunteers the right.[144] In the centre of the whole line of advance,\r\nthe Norman counterpart of the English standard, there was borne the\r\nconsecrated banner which William had received from the pope.[145]\r\n\r\nSo quickly had the march from Hastings been made that the actual\r\nfighting was opened at about nine in the morning[146] by an advance of\r\nthe Norman foot. Galled by a heavy fire from the archers, which could\r\nonly be answered very ineffectively by the spears and stones which were\r\nalmost the sole missile weapons of the English, numbers of the native\r\ntroops broke away from their line, in defiance of the strict orders\r\nissued by Harold to the effect that no man should leave his post. In the\r\nmeantime, the Norman cavalry had been steadily making its way to the\r\nfront in order to take immediate advantage of the disorder caused in the\r\nEnglish ranks by the fire of the archers. But the knights could only\r\nmove their horses slowly up the hill; the solidity of the English\r\nformation had not been seriously affected as yet, and the cavalry were\r\ncompelled to attack an unbroken line. The result was disaster. The\r\nBreton auxiliaries on the left fell back, the confusion spread rapidly,\r\nand the English, seizing their advantage, sallied forth and drove the\r\nentire Norman line before them in headlong flight down the hill.[147]\r\nFortunately William had not joined in this first attack in person, and\r\nwhen in their panic the Normans believed that their leader had fallen,\r\nthey were soon recalled to their senses by the sight of the duke with\r\nbared head, laying about him with his spear, and shouting words of\r\nreproof and encouragement.[148] Mounted as they were, the flying knights\r\ncould have but little difficulty in outstripping their pursuers, but, if\r\nwe may trust the Bayeux tapestry, a number of English and Normans\r\nperished together in the course of the flight, by falling into a deep\r\ndepression in the ground situated somewhere between the base of the hill\r\nand the duke’s post. According to the same authority, the bishop of\r\nBayeux did good service at this moment, restoring order among the\r\nbaggage-carriers and camp-followers, who were apparently becoming\r\ninfected with the panic which had seized their masters.[149] Between the\r\nduke and his brother, the flight was checked, and then the knights,\r\neager to avenge their disgrace, rallied, turned, and cut off their\r\npursuers from their comrades on the hill, making a wholesale slaughter\r\nof them.[150] Mainly through William’s self-possession the Norman rout\r\nhad ended after all in a distinct success gained for his side.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cavalry had re-formed, the attack on the English position\r\nwas resumed; this time under the immediate leadership of the duke. The\r\nstruggle at the foot of the hill had given its defenders time to close\r\ntheir ranks, and the English continued to present an impenetrable front\r\nto the Norman cavalry. All along the line a desperate struggle raged for\r\nsome hours, but of its details no tale can be told, although it is\r\nprobable that it was at this point in the battle that Gyrth and\r\nLeofwine, Harold’s brothers, fell, and there is good reason for\r\nbelieving that the former was struck down by the hand of the duke\r\nhimself. William, indeed, in all our authorities is represented as the\r\nlife and soul of the attack, “more often calling to his men to come on\r\nthan bidding them advance” says William of Poitiers; he had three horses\r\nkilled under him before the day was over, and he did all that might be\r\ndone by a feudal captain to keep his troops together and to inspire them\r\nby his example. But notwithstanding his exertions it is evident that the\r\nEnglish were more than holding their own,[151] and a second repulse\r\nsuffered thus late in the day by the Norman cavalry would almost\r\ncertainly have passed into a rout of the whole army. At this crisis it\r\noccurred to some cunning brain, whether that of the duke or another,\r\nthat it might be possible by feigning flight to tempt the English troops\r\nto break their formation, and then, by turning on suitable ground, to\r\nrepeat the success which had ended the real flight in the forenoon. The\r\nmovement was easily carried out; a body of Normans rode away, and a\r\ncrowd of Englishmen, regardless of everything except the relief from the\r\nimmediate strain of keeping their ranks, hurled themselves down the hill\r\nshouting curses and cries of victory. No discipline could have been kept\r\nunder the circumstances, and when the galloping knights suddenly spread\r\nout their line, wheeled around their horses, and surrounded the\r\ndisordered mob of their pursuers the latter were ridden down and cut to\r\npieces by scores.[152]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FOSSE DISASTER, BATTLE OF HASTINGS\r\n  FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY]\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible to estimate the actual extent of the loss\r\nwhich the English sustained in the episode of the feigned flight, but\r\nthere can be little doubt that its success marks the turning-point in\r\nthe fortune of the day. No incident in the great battle made a deeper\r\nimpression upon the historians who have described it for us, and the\r\ntale of the feigned flight is told in different narratives with great\r\nvariety of circumstance and detail. But from the writers who lived\r\nnearest to the time we may infer with tolerable certainty that the\r\nmanœuvre in question was a sudden expedient, devised and acted upon\r\nwithout previous organisation, and also that it was a simple, not a\r\ncombined movement. The whole business of decoying the English from the\r\nhill, turning upon, and then surrounding them, was the work of one and\r\nthe same body of knights. On the other hand, it is probably incorrect to\r\nspeak of the feigned flight in the singular, for our best authority\r\ndistinctly asserts that the same stratagem was used twice[153]; fighting\r\nwas going on along a front of at least half a mile in length, and\r\ndifferent sections of the Norman army may very well have carried out the\r\nmovement at different times, and in complete independence of each other.\r\nHowever this may be, the effect of the manœuvre was soon apparent.\r\nThe English line, though shrunken in numbers, closed its ranks and kept\r\nits formation, wedged together so tightly that the wounded could not\r\nfall behind to the rear, nor even the dead bodies drop to the ground.\r\nBut the superior endurance of the Norman troops was beginning to tell;\r\nthe English were rapidly losing heart,[154] and the consummation of\r\nWilliam’s victory only waited for the destruction of King Harold, and of\r\nthe warriors who fought with him round the standard.\r\n\r\nThe attack which finally beat down the resistance of the English line\r\nseems to have been delivered from some point to the south-east of the\r\nhill.[155] The battle had already continued for seven or eight hours,\r\nand twilight was beginning to fall,[156] but its approach could only\r\nremind the shaken remnant of the native host that the day was lost, and\r\nthe end of the great fight was now very near. It was in the last\r\nconfused struggle which raged round the standard in the fading light\r\nthat Harold met his death; and then his companions, tired out and\r\nhopeless of reinforcement, yielded the ground they had defended for so\r\nlong, and broke away to the north-west along the neck of land which\r\nconnects the hill of battle with the higher ridges of the downs beyond\r\nit. The victors followed in hot pursuit; but a strange chance gave to\r\nHarold, in the very hour of his death, a signal revenge over the men at\r\nwhose hands he had just fallen. A little to the west of the original\r\nposition of the English army one of the head-waters of the Asten had cut\r\na deep ravine, of which the eastern face was so steep as to be a\r\nveritable trap for any incautious horsemen who might attempt to ride\r\ndown it. In the gathering darkness knight after knight, galloping after\r\nthe English fugitives in secure ignorance of the ground, crashed down\r\ninto this gully; and the name Malfosse, borne throughout the Middle Ages\r\nby the ravine in question, bears witness to the extent of the disaster\r\nwhich the victorious army suffered at this point.[157] Harold, after he\r\nhad lost life and kingdom, was still justified of the ground which he\r\nhad chosen as the place of battle.\r\n\r\nLate in the night William returned to the battlefield and pitched his\r\ntent there. There could be no doubt that he had gained an unequivocal\r\nvictory; his rival was dead, the native army annihilated; he could well\r\nafford to give his troops the rest they needed. The early part of the\r\nfollowing day was spent in the burial of the Norman dead; the work being\r\ncarried out under the duke’s immediate care. The English folk of the\r\nneighbourhood soon came in numbers to the battlefield and begged for the\r\nbodies of their fallen kinsfolk, which they were allowed to carry away\r\nfor burial; but the unclaimed corpses were left strewn about the hill.\r\nBefore long the bodies of Harold, Gyrth and Leofwine were found lying\r\nclose together; but Harold’s corpse had been horribly mangled, and,\r\naccording to the later romantic story, it was only identified by means\r\nof certain marks upon the body which were known and recognised by the\r\ndead man’s mistress, Edith the Swan-necked. Towards the close of the\r\nmorrow of the battle, William returned to his castle at Hastings,\r\nbearing Harold’s body with him for burial upon the shore in\r\nunconsecrated ground as befitted an excommunicate, and an urgent message\r\nfrom Gytha, Godwine’s widow, offering for her son’s body its weight in\r\ngold, did nothing to shake his purpose.[158] With characteristic irony\r\nWilliam remarked that it was but fitting that Harold in death should be\r\nappointed guardian of the shore and sea, which he had tried to defend in\r\nlife; and the dead king’s body, wrapped in a purple robe, was laid out\r\nof sight somewhere among the rocks along the shore of Hastings bay.\r\nLater tradition indeed asserted that Harold before long was translated\r\nfrom this unhallowed grave to a tomb in the minster of the Holy Cross at\r\nWaltham, which he had founded three years before[159]; but the authority\r\non which this story depends is none of the best, and, for all that we\r\nreally know to the contrary, the last native king of England is still\r\nthe guardian of the Sussex shore.\r\n\r\nHarold, above all kings in English history with the possible exceptions\r\nof Richard III. and Charles I., was happy in the circumstances of his\r\ndeath. He gained thereby an immediate release from the performance of an\r\nimpossible task, and he was enabled to redeem the personal ambitions\r\nwhich governed his past life by associating them in the moment of his\r\nfall with the cause of the national independence of England. It has been\r\npossible for historians to regret the outcome of the battle of Hastings\r\nonly because it overthrew Harold before he could prove the hopelessness\r\nof the position in which he had placed himself. What chance had he, a\r\nman of uncertain ancestry and questionable antecedents, of completing\r\nthe work which had overcome every king before him: the work of\r\nreconciling the antagonism of north to south, of making the royal word\r\nsupreme in the royal council, of making the provincial nobility of\r\nEngland and its dependents the subjects of the king and of the king\r\nonly? It may well be that such a task would have proved beyond the power\r\nof any native king, though descended from the immemorial line of Cerdic;\r\nhow could it be completed by an ambitious earl, invested indeed with the\r\nroyal authority, but crippled in its exercise by the bitter rivalry of\r\nmen who had formerly been his fellow-subjects; whose birth was more\r\nnoble, whose wealth was scarcely less, who, in opposition to his rule,\r\ncould rely upon endless reserves of local patriotism, the one source of\r\npolitical strength which the land contained? To genius, indeed, all\r\nthings are possible, but to ascribe genius to this commonplace,\r\nmiddle-aged earl would be to do sheer violence to the meaning of words.\r\nHarold will always hold a noble place in the record of English history;\r\nbut he owes that place solely to the events of his last month of life,\r\nwhen the terrible necessity of straining every faculty he possessed in\r\nthe support of his trembling throne roused in him a quickness of\r\nperception and a rapidity of action which his uneventful career as earl\r\nof Wessex could never have called into being. Harold was undoubtedly the\r\nbest captain that England had seen since the death of Edmund Ironside,\r\njust fifty years before the battle of Hastings; but the work which\r\nHarold had undertaken would have called for quite other powers than\r\nthose which he revealed so unexpectedly on the eve of his death. William\r\nthe Conqueror, endowed as he was by nature with the faculties of a great\r\nruler to an extent perhaps without parallel in English history; superior\r\nby the fact that he came in by conquest to all the local jealousies\r\nwhich distracted Anglo-Saxon politics; and with unique opportunities of\r\nrecasting the social and tenurial features of English life; could only\r\ncreate a strong and uniform government in England after three years of\r\nalmost incessant war, the reduction of a third of England to a\r\nwilderness, and the remodelling in principle of the whole fabric of the\r\nEnglish administration, civil and military. When it is remembered that\r\nthe resistance to William was made essentially on grounds not of\r\nnational feeling, but of local particularism, and that these forces\r\nwould undoubtedly have conspired against Harold as they afterwards\r\nconspired against his rival, we can only conclude that fate was kind\r\nwhich slew Harold in the heat of battle in a noble cause, instead of\r\ncondemning him to witness the disintegration of his kingdom, in virtual\r\nimpotence, varied only by spasmodic outbreaks of barren civil war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of Harold II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                         FROM HASTINGS TO YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nCatastrophic as the battle of Hastings seems to us now, in view of the\r\nlater history, its decisive character was not recognised at once by the\r\nnational party. The very incoherence of the Anglo-Saxon polity brought a\r\nspecious advantage to the national cause, in that the defeat of one part\r\nof the nation by an invader left the rest of the country comparatively\r\nunaffected by the fact. The wars of Edmund Ironside and Cnut, fifty\r\nyears before, show us groups of shires one after the other making\r\nisolated attempts to check the progress of the enemy, and few men could\r\nalready have realised that the advent of William of Normandy meant the\r\nintroduction of new processes of warfare which would render hopeless the\r\ncasual methods of Anglo-Saxon generalship. Neither side, in fact,\r\nunderstood the other. William, on his part expecting that the total\r\noverthrow of the English king with his army would imply the immediate\r\nsubmission of the whole land, took up his quarters at Hastings on the\r\nday after the battle to receive the homage of all those Englishmen who\r\nmight come in person to accept him as their lord. The passage of five\r\ndays without a single surrender taught him that the fruits of victory\r\nwould not fall into his hands without further shaking, and meanwhile the\r\nEnglish nobility began to form plans for a continued resistance to his\r\npretensions in the name of another national king.\r\n\r\nWho that king should be was the first question which demanded\r\nsettlement. There was no hope of preserving the English crown in the\r\nhouse of Godwine: the events of the past three weeks had been fatal to\r\nall the surviving sons of the old earl, with the exception of Wulfnoth\r\nthe youngest, and he was most likely a prisoner or hostage in\r\nNormandy.[160] Harold’s one legitimate son was most probably as yet\r\nunborn; he had at least three illegitimate sons of sufficient age, but\r\ntheir candidature, if any one had suggested it, would certainly have\r\nbeen inacceptable to the churchmen on whom it rested to give ultimate\r\nsanction to any choice which might be made. Two alternatives remained:\r\neither a return might be made to the old West Saxon line in the person\r\nof Edgar the Etheling, or a new dynasty might be started again by the\r\nelection of Edwin or Morcar. The one advantage which the former\r\npossessed, now as earlier in the year, was the fact that his election\r\nwould not outrage the local particularism of any part of the country; it\r\nmight not be impossible for Wessex, Mercia, and Northumbria to unite\r\nround him in a common cause. Nor was it unnatural that in this hour of\r\ncrushing disaster men’s minds should involuntarily turn to the last male\r\nheir of their ancient kings. Apart from these considerations, there was\r\nsomething to be said in favour of the choice of one of the northern\r\nearls. It must have been clear that Mercia and Northumbria would have to\r\nbear the brunt of any resistance which might subsequently be made to the\r\ninvader, whose troops were already occupying the eastern shires of the\r\nearldom of Wessex, and who would be certain before long to strike a blow\r\nat London itself. But the success of Harold’s reign had not been such as\r\nto invite a repetition of the experiment of his election. Edgar the\r\nEtheling was chosen king, and the two brother earls withdrew to\r\nNorthumbria, imagining in their own minds, says William of Malmesbury,\r\nthat William would never come thither.[161]\r\n\r\nThis motive gives an interest to their withdrawal which is lost if we\r\nregard it as a mere act of treachery to the national cause. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that what Edwin and Morcar intended was a partition of the\r\nkingdom between themselves and William, and it is at least questionable\r\nwhether such a plan had not a better prospect of success than an attempt\r\nto recover the whole land for a king who had no personal qualities of\r\nleadership, and who could never hope to attach to himself any of that\r\nlocal sentiment in which lay the only real strength of the national\r\nparty. The idea of a divided kingdom was by no means chimerical. Old men\r\nstill living could remember the partition made by the treaty of Alney\r\nbetween Edmund Ironside and Cnut, and it was not a sign of utter folly\r\nfor any man to suppose, within a week of the battle of Hastings, that\r\nWilliam, having settled his score with Harold, might content himself\r\nwith his rival’s patrimonial earldom of Wessex, leaving the north of\r\nEngland to its existing rulers. No one at this date could be expected to\r\nunderstand the extent to which William’s political ideas differed from\r\nthose of Cnut; nor need we suppose that Edwin and Morcar were mistaken\r\nas to the reality, though they may have overestimated the military\r\nvalue, of the feeling for local independence in their two great\r\nearldoms. In the case of Northumbria, indeed, even after William’s\r\npresence had been felt in every part of the land, so acute an observer\r\nas Archbishop Lanfranc insisted on the subordination of the see of York\r\nto that of Canterbury on the ground that an independent archbishop of\r\nYork might canonically consecrate an independent king of the\r\nNorthumbrians.[162] What was lacking to the plan was not local\r\nseparatism, but the skill and consistency of purpose which alone could\r\nturn it to account. Neither the ignominious failure of Edwin and Morcar,\r\non the one hand, nor the grandiose phrases of chancery clerks about the\r\n“Empire of Britain,” on the other, should blind us to the fact that\r\nEngland was united only in name until the strong rule of its Norman\r\nlords had made the king’s word as truly law in Yorkshire as in\r\nMiddlesex.\r\n\r\nWhile the English leaders were disposing of their crown William was\r\npursuing his deliberate course towards London by a route roughly\r\nparallel with the coast of Kent and Sussex. His delay at Hastings had\r\nnot been time wasted; it allowed his troops to recover from the strain\r\nand excitement of the great battle, and it gave him the opportunity of\r\nreceiving badly needed reinforcements from Normandy. On the 20th of\r\nOctober, six days after the battle, the second stage of the conquest\r\nbegan; William, with the main body of his army, moved out of Hastings,\r\nleaving a garrison in the newly built castle, and marched across the\r\nborder of Kent to Romney. The men of the latter place had cut off a body\r\nof Norman soldiers who had landed there by mistake before the battle of\r\nHastings; and the most famous sentence written by the Conqueror’s first\r\nbiographer relates how William at Romney “took what vengeance he would\r\nfor the death of his men.”[163] Having thus suggested by example the\r\nimpolicy of resistance, a march of fifteen miles between the Kentish\r\ndowns and the sea brought William to the greatest port and strongest\r\nfortress in south England, the harbour and castle of Dover. The\r\nfoundation of the castle had probably been the work of Harold while earl\r\nof Wessex, and, standing on the very edge of the famous cliffs\r\noverhanging the sea, the fortress occupied a site which to Englishmen\r\nseemed impregnable, and which was regarded as very formidable by the\r\nNorman witnesses of this campaign.[164] The castle was packed with\r\nfugitives from the surrounding country, but its garrison did not wait\r\nfor a formal demand for its surrender. Very probably impressed by what\r\nhad happened on the previous day at Romney, they met William half way\r\nwith the keys of the castle, and the surrender was duly completed when\r\nthe army arrived at Dover. It was William’s interest and intention to\r\ntreat a town which had submitted so readily as lightly as possible, but\r\nthe soldiers, possibly suspecting that the booty of the rich seaport was\r\nto be withheld from them, got out of hand for once, and the town was set\r\non fire. William attempted to make good the damage to the citizens, but\r\nfound it impossible to punish the offenders as he wished, and ended by\r\nexpelling a number of Englishmen from their houses, and placing members\r\nof his army in their stead.[165] Eight days were spent at Dover, during\r\nwhich the fortifications of the castle were brought up to an improved\r\nstandard, and then William set out again “thoroughly to crush those whom\r\nhe had conquered.” But before his departure he appointed the castle as a\r\nhospital for the invalided soldiers; for dysentery, which was set down\r\nat the time to over-indulgence in fresh meat and strange water, had\r\nplayed havoc with the army.[166]\r\n\r\nWith the surrender of Dover William’s communications with Normandy were\r\nfirmly secured, and he now struck out directly towards his destined\r\ncapital, along the Roman road which then, as at every period of English\r\nhistory, formed the main line of communication between London and the\r\nKentish ports. Canterbury was the first place of importance on the way,\r\nand its citizens followed the prudent example of the men of Dover.\r\nBefore William had gone far from Dover, the Canterbury men sent\r\nmessengers who swore fealty to him, and gave hostages, and—an act which\r\nwas a more unequivocal recognition of his title to the crown—brought him\r\nthe customary payment due yearly from the city to the king. From this\r\npoint, indeed, William had little reason to complain of the paucity of\r\nsurrenders; the Kentishmen, we are told, crowded into his camp and did\r\nhomage “like flies settling on a wound.”[167] But the even course of his\r\nsuccess was suddenly interrupted. On the last day of October, he took up\r\nhis quarters at a place vaguely described by William of Poitiers as the\r\n“Broken Tower,” and was there seized by a violent illness, which kept\r\nhim for an entire month incapable of moving from the neighbourhood of\r\nCanterbury. But, if we can trust the chronology of our authorities, it\r\nwas during this enforced delay that William received the submission of\r\nthe capital of Wessex. Winchester at this time had fallen somewhat from\r\nits high estate under the West Saxon kings; along with certain other\r\ntowns it had been given by Edward the Confessor to his wife Eadgyth as\r\npart of her marriage settlement, and it was now little more than the\r\nresidence of the dowager queen. On this account, we are told that\r\nWilliam thought it would be unbecoming in him to march and take the town\r\nby force and arms, so he contented himself with a polite request for\r\nfealty and “tribute.” Eadgyth complacently enough agreed, took counsel\r\nwith the leading citizens, and added her gifts to those which were\r\nbrought to William on behalf of the city.[168] This ready submission was\r\na fact of considerable importance. Winchester lay off the track of an\r\ninvader whose objective was London, and apart from his illness William\r\ncould scarcely have afforded to part with a detachment of his small army\r\nsufficiently large to make certain the capture of the town. Yet the old\r\ncapital was a most ancient and honourable city, containing the hall of\r\nthe Saxon kings, in which probably were deposited the royal treasure and\r\nregalia; and its surrender with the ostentatious approval of King\r\nEdward’s widow was a useful recognition of William’s claim to be the\r\ntrue heir of the Saxon dynasty. In his dealings with Winchester the\r\nConqueror’s example was followed by William Rufus, Henry I., and\r\nStephen, though the paramount necessity for them of seizing the royal\r\nhoard at the critical moment of their disputed successions made them\r\neach visit the royal city in person.[169]\r\n\r\nOn his recovery, at or near the beginning of December, William resumed\r\nhis advance on London. Doubtless Rochester made a peaceful surrender,\r\nbut we have no information as to this, nor as to any further details of\r\nthe long march until it brought the Conqueror within striking distance\r\nof London. London, it is plain, was prepared for resistance; and the\r\nnarrow passage of the bridge, the only means of crossing the river at\r\nthis point, made the city virtually impregnable from the south. William\r\nwas not the man to waste valuable troops in a series of hopeless\r\nassaults when a less expensive method might prevail, and on the present\r\noccasion he merely sent out a body of five hundred knights to\r\nreconnoitre. A detachment of the English was tempted thereby to make a\r\nsally, but was driven back across the bridge with heavy loss, Southwark\r\nwas burned to the ground,[170] and William proceeded to repeat the plan\r\nwhich had proved so successful in Maine three years before. Abandoning\r\nall attempt to take the city by storm, he struck off on a great loop to\r\nthe west, and his passage can be traced clearly enough in Domesday Book\r\nby the devastation from which a great part of Surrey and Berkshire had\r\nnot fully recovered twenty years afterwards. The Thames was crossed at\r\nlast at Wallingford, and it was there that William received the\r\nsubmission of the first Englishman of high rank who realised that the\r\nnational cause was doomed. Stigand, the schismatic archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, did homage and swore fealty, explicitly renouncing his\r\nallegiance to Edgar the Etheling, in whose ill-starred election he had\r\nplayed a leading part.[171] The weakness of Stigand’s canonical\r\nposition, which was certain to be called in question if William should\r\never be firmly seated on the throne, made it advisable for him to make a\r\nbid for favour by an exceptionally early submission, and it was no less\r\nWilliam’s policy graciously to accept the homage of the man who was at\r\nleast the nominal head of the church in England. Probably neither party\r\nwas under any misapprehension as to the other’s motives; but in being\r\nsuffered to enjoy his pluralities and appropriated church lands for\r\nthree years longer Stigand was not unrewarded for his abandonment of the\r\nnational cause at the critical moment.\r\n\r\nThe exact time and place at which the remaining English leaders gave in\r\ntheir allegiance are rather uncertain. There is some reason, in the\r\ndistribution of the lands which Domesday implies to have undergone\r\ndeliberate ravage about this time, to suppose that, even when William\r\nwas on the London side of the Thames, he did not march directly on the\r\ncity, but continued to hold a north-easterly course, not turning\r\nsouthwards until he had spread destruction across mid-Buckinghamshire\r\nand south-west Bedfordshire. The next distinct episode in the process of\r\nconquest occurred at a place called by the _Worcester Chronicle_\r\n“Beorcham,” where allegiance was sworn to William on a scale which\r\nproved that now at last his deliberate policy had done its intended\r\nwork, and that the party of his rival had fallen to pieces without\r\ndaring to contest the verdict given at Hastings in the open field. Edgar\r\nthe king-elect, and Archbishop Ealdred of York, with the bishops of\r\nWorcester and Hereford, and a number of the more important citizens of\r\nLondon “with many others met him [William], gave hostages, made their\r\nsubmission, and swore fealty to him.” And William of Poitiers tells us\r\nthat when the army had just come in sight of London the bishop and other\r\nmagnates came out, surrendered the city, and begged William to assume\r\nthe crown, saying that they were accustomed to obey a king, and that\r\nthey wished to have a king for their lord. One is naturally tempted to\r\ncombine these two episodes, but this can only be done by abandoning the\r\nold identification of “Beorcham” with Great Berkhampstead, thirty miles\r\nfrom London, and by assuming the surrender to have taken place when the\r\narmy appeared on the edge of the Hertfordshire Chilterns overlooking the\r\nThames Valley, fifteen miles away, from the high ground of Little\r\nBerkhampstead near Hertford.[172]\r\n\r\nWhatever the exact place at which the offer of the crown was made to\r\nWilliam, it was straightway submitted by him to the consideration of the\r\nchiefs of his army. Two questions were laid before them: whether it was\r\nwise for William to allow himself to be crowned with his kingdom still\r\nin a state of distraction, and—this last rather a matter of personal\r\nfeeling than of policy—whether he should not wait until his wife could\r\nbe crowned along with him. Apart from these considerations, the\r\nassumption of the English crown was a step which concerned William’s own\r\nNormans scarcely less intimately than his future English subjects. The\r\ntransformation of the duke of the Normans into the king of the English\r\nwas a process which possessed a vital interest for all those Normans who\r\nwere to become members of the English state, and William could not well\r\ndo less than consult them on the eve of such a unique event. As to the\r\nultimate assumption of the crown by William, no two opinions were\r\npossible: Hamon, viscount of Thouars, an Aquitanian volunteer of\r\ndistinction, in voicing the sentiments of the army, began by remarking\r\nthat this was the one object of the enterprise; but he went on to\r\nadvocate a speedy coronation on the ground that were William once\r\ncrowned king resistance to him would be less likely undertaken and more\r\neasily put down. With quite unintentional irony he added that the wisest\r\nand most noble men of England would surely never have chosen William for\r\ntheir king, unless they had seen in him a suitable ruler and one under\r\nwhom their own possessions and honours would probably be increased. To\r\nguard against any wavering on the part of these “prudentissimi et optimi\r\nviri,” William immediately sent on a detachment to take possession of\r\nLondon and to build a castle in the city, while he himself, during the\r\nfew days which had to pass before the Christmas feast for which he had\r\nfixed his coronation, devoted himself to sport in the wooded country of\r\nsouth Hertfordshire.[173]\r\n\r\nOf the deliberations within London which led to this unconditional\r\nsurrender on the part of the national leaders, we know little with any\r\ncertainty, but it is not improbable that at some stage in his great\r\nmarch William had entered into negotiations with some of the chief men\r\nin the etheling’s party. Our most strictly contemporary account of these\r\nevents[174] makes the final submission the result of a series of\r\nmessages exchanged between the duke and a certain “Esegar” the Staller,\r\non whom as sheriff of London and Middlesex fell the burden of providing\r\nfor the defence of the city. We are given to understand that William\r\nsent privately to “Esegar” asking that he should be recognised as king\r\nand promising to be guided in all things by the latter’s advice. On\r\nreceiving the message Esegar decided, rather unwisely, as the event\r\nproved, to try and deceive William; so he called an assembly of the\r\neldest citizens and, laying the duke’s proposal before them, suggested\r\nthat he should pretend to agree with it and thus gain time by making a\r\nfalse submission. We are not told the exact words of the reply which was\r\nactually sent, but we are informed that William saw through the plan and\r\ncontrived to impress the messenger with his own greatness and the\r\ncertain futility of all resistance to him to such an extent that the\r\nmessenger on his return, by simply relating his experiences, induced the\r\nmen of London to abandon the etheling’s cause straightway. The tale\r\nreads rather like an improved version of some simpler negotiations, but\r\nthat is no reason for its complete rejection, and we may not\r\nunreasonably believe that, in addition to intimidating the city by his\r\nravages in the open country, William tried to accelerate matters by\r\ntampering with some at least of those who were holding his future\r\ncapital against him.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas day William was crowned King of England in Westminster\r\nAbbey by Archbishop Ealdred of York, a clear intimation that Stigand’s\r\nopportunist submission would not avail to restore to him all the\r\nprerogatives of the primacy. The ceremony was conducted with due regard,\r\nas it would seem, to all the observances which had usually attended the\r\nhallowing of the Anglo-Saxon kings, only on the present occasion it was\r\nnecessary to ask the assembled people in French as well as in English\r\nwhether they would accept William as their king. The archbishop of York\r\nput the question in English, Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, that in\r\nFrench, and the men of both races who were present in the Abbey gave a\r\nvociferous assent. Unfortunately the uproar within the church was\r\nmisunderstood by the guard of Norman horsemen who were stationed\r\noutside, and they, imagining that the new subjects of their duke were\r\ntrying to cut him down before the altar, sought to relieve his immediate\r\ndanger by setting fire to the wooden buildings around,[175] and so\r\ncreating a diversion. In this they were quite successful; amid\r\nindescribable confusion the congregation rushed headlong out of the\r\nchurch, some to save their own property, and some to take advantage of\r\nso exceptional an opportunity of unimpeded plunder. The duke and the\r\nofficiating clergy were left almost alone; and in the deserted abbey\r\nWilliam, quivering with excitement,[176] became by the ritual of unction\r\nand coronation the full and lawful successor of Alfred and Athelstan.\r\nBut before the crown was placed upon his head the Conqueror swore in\r\nancient words, which must have sounded ironical amid the noise and\r\ntumult, that he would protect God’s churches and their rulers, would\r\ngovern all the people subjected to him with justice, would decree and\r\nkeep right law, and would quite forbid all violence and unjust\r\njudgments.[177] And so the seal of the Church was set upon the work\r\nwhich had been in fact begun on that morning, three months before, when\r\nWilliam and his army disembarked on the shore of Pevensey.\r\n\r\nThe disorder which had attended the coronation was actually the result\r\nof a misapprehension on the part of William’s own followers, but he\r\nevidently felt that the possibility of a sudden rising on the part of\r\nthe rich and independent city was a danger which should not be ignored.\r\nAccordingly, to avoid all personal risk, while at the same time keeping\r\nin close touch with his capital, William moved from London to Barking,\r\nand stayed there while that most famous of all Norman fortresses, the\r\noriginal “Tower of London,” was being built. Most probably it was during\r\nthis stay at Barking that William received the homage of such leading\r\nEnglishmen as had not been present at the submission on the\r\nHertfordshire downs. In particular Edwin and Morcar would seem to have\r\nrecognised the inevitable at this time[178]; the coronation of William\r\nas king of all England by the metropolitan of York may have taught them\r\nthat a division of the kingdom no longer lay within the range of\r\npractical politics. At any rate William did not think that it would be\r\nwell for him to let them out of his sight for a season, and within a few\r\ndays of the New Year they are found accompanying him as hostages into\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\nOur sole knowledge of the general state of the country at this most\r\ncritical time comes from certain scattered writs which can be proved to\r\nhave been issued during the few weeks immediately following the\r\ncoronation. The information which they give is but scanty; they were of\r\ncourse not intended to convey any historical information at all, but\r\nthey nevertheless help us to answer the important question how much of\r\nEngland had really submitted for the time to William’s rule by the end\r\nof 1066, and they do this in two ways. On the one hand, they were\r\nwitnessed by some of the more important men, English as well as Normans,\r\nwho were present in William’s court; on the other hand, we may safely\r\nacquit William of the folly of sending his writs into counties in which\r\nthere was no probability that they would be obeyed. Foremost among the\r\ndocuments comes a writ referring to land on the border of Wiltshire and\r\nGloucestershire, which shows us King William, like King Edward before\r\nhim, sending his orders to the native authorities of the shire—in the\r\npresent case the bishops of Ramsbury and Worcester, and two thegns named\r\nEadric and Brihtric, with whom, however, Count Eustace of Boulogne is\r\nsignificantly associated.[179] From the other side of the country comes\r\na more famous document in which William, “at the request of Abbot\r\nBrand,” grants to the said abbot and his monks of Peterborough the free\r\nand full possession of a number of lands in Lincolnshire and\r\nNottinghamshire. Leofric, abbot of Peterborough, had been mortally\r\nwounded at the battle of Hastings, and on his death the monks had chosen\r\ntheir provost Brand as his successor. He, not discerning the signs of\r\nthe times, had gone and received confirmation from Edgar the Etheling,\r\nof whose inchoate reign this is the only recorded event; and it required\r\nthe mediation of “many good men” and the payment of ten marks of gold to\r\nappease the wrath of William at such an insult to his claim. The present\r\ncharter is the sign of William’s forgiveness, but for us its special\r\ninterest lies in the fact that it shows us the king’s word already\r\ncurrent by the Trent and Humber, while the appearance among its\r\nwitnesses of “Marleswegen the sheriff” shows that the man to whom Harold\r\nhad entrusted the command of the north did not see fit to continue\r\nresistance to the new king of England.[180]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JOHN’S CHAPEL, IN THE TOWER OF LONDON]\r\n\r\nMuch more evidence, if we can trust it, pointing in the same direction,\r\ncan be derived from a number of writs in English, which were apparently\r\ngranted at this time in favour of Westminster Abbey.[181] Nothing could\r\nbe more natural than that William at this time should show especial\r\nfavour to the great religious house within whose precincts he had so\r\nrecently been crowned, and although the language of these documents is\r\nvery corrupt, and the monks of Westminster Abbey were practised and\r\nsuccessful manufacturers of forged charters, there is not sufficient\r\nreason for us to condemn the present writs as spurious. And if genuine,\r\nand correctly dated, they add to the proof that William’s rule was\r\naccepted in many shires which had never yet seen a Norman army. The king\r\ngreets Leofwine, bishop of Lichfield and Earl Edwin and all the thegns\r\nof Staffordshire in one writ; Ealdred, archbishop, and Wulfstan, bishop,\r\nand Earl William and all the thegns of Gloucestershire and\r\nWorcestershire in another; and if his rule was accepted in these three\r\nwestern shires, and also in the eastern counties represented by the\r\nPeterborough document, the submission of the midlands and in fact of the\r\nwhole earldom of Mercia would seem to follow as a matter of course. It\r\nis also worth noting that no document relating to Northumbria, the one\r\npart of the country which offered a really protracted resistance to the\r\nNorman Conquest, can be referred to this early period in William’s\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARTER OF WILLIAM I. TO THE LONDONERS\r\n  (IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE CORPORATION)]\r\n\r\nAll this, therefore, should warn us against underrating the immediate\r\npolitical importance of the battle of Hastings. It did much more than\r\nmerely put William into possession of the lands under the immediate rule\r\nof the house of Godwine; the overthrow of the national cause which it\r\nimplied brought about so general a submission to the Conqueror that,\r\nwith the possible exception of the Northumbrian risings, all subsequent\r\nresistance to him may with sufficient accuracy be described as\r\nrebellion. William, it would seem, at the time of his coronation, was\r\nthe accepted king of all England south of the Humber, and the evidence\r\nwhich suggests this conclusion suggests also that at the outset of his\r\nreign he wished to interfere as little as possible with the native\r\nsystem of administration. Even in the counties which had felt his\r\ndevastating march, English sheriffs continued to be responsible for the\r\ngovernment of their wasted shires. Edmund, the sheriff of Hertfordshire,\r\nand “Sawold,” the sheriff of Oxfordshire, may be found in other writs of\r\nthe Westminster series on which we have just commented. The Norman\r\nConquest was to be followed by an almost complete change in the\r\npersonnel of the English administration, but that change was first felt\r\nin the higher departments of government; the sheriffs of Oxfordshire and\r\nGloucestershire were not displaced, but Earl William Fitz Osbern, Count\r\nEustace of Boulogne, and Bishop Odo of Bayeux begin to be held\r\nresponsible for the execution of the king’s will in the shires where\r\nthey had influence.\r\n\r\nTo the close of 1066 or the beginning of 1067 must also be assigned a\r\ncharter of exceptional form and some especial constitutional interest in\r\nwhich King William grants Hayling Island, between Portsmouth and\r\nChichester, to the monastery of Jumièges. In this document William is\r\nmade to describe himself as lord of Normandy and “basileus” of England\r\nby hereditary right, and to say that, “having undertaken the government\r\nof England, he has conquered all his enemies.” One of these enemies,\r\nnamely Earl Waltheof, attests the charter in question, and is flanked in\r\nthe list of witnesses by Bishop Wulfwig of Dorchester, who died in 1067,\r\nand by one Ingelric, a Lotharingian priest who is known to have enjoyed\r\nWilliam’s favour in the earliest years of his reign.[182] But it is the\r\nphrase “hereditario jure” which deserves particular attention. Rarely\r\nused in formal documents in later years, when the chancery formulas had\r\nbecome stereotyped, the words have, nevertheless, a prospective as well\r\nas a reflexive significance. They contain not only an enunciation of the\r\nclaims in virtue of which King William had “undertaken the government of\r\nEngland,” but also a statement of the title by which that government\r\nwould be handed down to his descendants. For, whatever may have been the\r\ntitle to the crown in the old English state, from the Norman Conquest\r\nonwards it has clearly become “hereditary” in the only sense in which\r\nany constitutional meaning can be attached to the word. Not a little of\r\nthe evidence which has been adduced in favour of an “elective” tenure of\r\nthe crown in Anglo-Norman and Angevin times is really the creation of an\r\narbitrary construction of the terms employed. “Hereditary right” is not\r\na synonym for primogeniture; the former words imply no more than that in\r\nany case of succession the determining factors would be the kinship of\r\nthe proposed heir to the late ruler and the known intentions of the\r\nlatter with respect to his inheritance. Disputed successions there were\r\nin plenty in the hundred and fifty years which followed the Conquest,\r\nbut the essence of the dispute in each case was the question which of\r\ntwo claimants could put forward the best title which did not run counter\r\nto hereditary principles. The strictest law of inheritance is liable to\r\nbe affected by extraneous complications when the crown is the stake at\r\nissue, and the disqualification which in 1100 attached to Robert of\r\nNormandy as an incapable absentee, in 1135 to Matilda the empress as a\r\nwoman and the wife of an unpopular foreigner, in 1199 to Arthur as an\r\nalien and a minor, should not be allowed to mask the fact that in none\r\nof these cases did the success of a rival claimant contravene the\r\nvalidity of hereditary ideas. It was inevitable that, where the very\r\nrules of inheritance themselves were vague and fluctuating, the\r\napplication made of them in any given instance should be guided by\r\nexpediency rather than by a rigid adherence to the strict forms of law;\r\nyet nevertheless we may be sure that William Rufus and Henry I., like\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, would claim to hold the throne of England not\r\notherwise than “hereditario jure.”\r\n\r\nAt Barking the submission of the leading Englishmen went on apace.\r\nBesides Edwin and Morcar, Copsige, a Northumbrian thegn, and three other\r\nEnglishmen called Thurkill, Siward, and Ealdred, were considered by\r\nNorman writers men of sufficient importance to deserve mention by name,\r\nand in addition to these shadowy figures we are told that many other\r\n“nobles” also came in at this time.[183] No apparent notice was taken by\r\nWilliam of the tardiness of their submissions; all were received to\r\nfavour, and among them must very probably be included the victim of the\r\none great tragedy which stands out above all the disaster of the\r\nConquest, Waltheof, the son of Siward. Waltheof was confirmed in his\r\nmidland earldom of Northampton, and received a special mark of grace in\r\nbeing allowed to marry the Conqueror’s niece Judith, daughter of\r\nEnguerrand, the count of Ponthieu who had perished in the ambuscade at\r\nSt. Aubin in 1054, by Adeliz, the daughter of Robert of Normandy and\r\nArlette. Nor was this an isolated measure of conciliation, for one of\r\nWilliam’s own daughters was promised to Earl Edwin, and in general it\r\nwould seem that at this time any Englishman might look for favour if he\r\nliked to do homage and propitiate the new king with a money gift. The\r\nlatter was essential, and from an incidental notice in the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_, and a chance expression in the Domesday of Essex, it has\r\nbeen inferred that a formal “redemption” of their lands on the part of\r\nthe English took place at this time.[184] The direct evidence for so\r\nfar-reaching an event is certainly slight, but it would fall in well\r\nwith the general theory of the Conquest if all Englishmen by the mere\r\nfact of their nationality were held to have forfeited their lands.\r\nWilliam, it must always be remembered, claimed the throne of England by\r\nhereditary right. He had been defrauded of his inheritance by the\r\nusurpation of Harold, in whose reign, falsely so called according to the\r\nNorman theory, all Englishmen had acquiesced, and might therefore justly\r\nincur that confiscation which was the penalty, familiar alike to both\r\nraces, for treason. Stern and even grotesque as this theory may seem to\r\nus, it was something more than a legal fiction, and we should be driven\r\nto assume for ourselves some idea of the kind even if we did not possess\r\nthese casual expressions of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ and the Domesday\r\nscribe. On the one hand, all Englishmen had rejected William’s claim,\r\nand so many as could be hurried down to Hastings in time had resisted\r\nhim in the open field; on the other hand, the number of Englishmen who\r\nwere still holding land of the king twenty years after the Conquest was\r\ninfinitesimal in comparison with the number who had suffered\r\ndisplacement. It would be natural to connect these two facts, but\r\nnothing is more probable in itself than that, before repeated rebellions\r\non the part of the English had sharpened the edge of the Norman theory,\r\nthe conquered race was given an opportunity of compounding for its\r\noriginal sin by making a deprecatory payment to the new lord of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is to this period that we must undoubtedly assign the\r\ninitial stages of the process which, before twenty years were over, was\r\nto substitute an alien baronage for the native thegnhood of England. It\r\nwas clearly necessary that William should give some earnest at least of\r\nthe spoils of war to his leading followers, and the amount of land\r\nalready at his disposal must have been very considerable. The entire\r\npossessions of the house of Godwine were in his hands, and the one form\r\nof statecraft which that family had pursued with consistency and success\r\nhad been the acquisition of landed property, nor do the dubious methods\r\nby which much of that property had been originally acquired seem to have\r\ninvalidated King William’s tenure of it. The battle of Hastings,\r\nmoreover, had been very fatal to the land-owning class of the southern\r\nshires, and no exception could be taken to William’s right to dispose of\r\nthe lands of men who had actually fallen whilst in arms against him.\r\nEven in this simple way, the king had become possessed of no small\r\nterritory out of which he could reward his followers, and the\r\ncomplicated nature of the Anglo-Saxon land-law assisted him still\r\nfurther in this respect. If, for instance, a thegn of Surrey had\r\n“commended” himself and his land to Harold as earl of Wessex, King\r\nWilliam would naturally inherit all the rights and profits which were\r\ninvolved in the act of commendation: he could make a grant of them to a\r\nNorman baron, and thus, without direct injury being done to any man, the\r\nNorman would become possessed of an interest in the land in question,\r\nwhich, under the influence of the feudal ideas which accompanied the\r\nConquest, would rapidly harden into direct ownership. In fact, there\r\nexists a considerable quantity of evidence which would suggest that a\r\nportion at least of the old English land-owning class was not displaced\r\nso much as submerged; that the Norman nobility was superimposed upon it\r\nas it were, and that the processes of thought which underlay feudal law\r\ninvested the newcomers with rights and duties which made them in the\r\neyes of the state the only recognised owners of the lands they held. We\r\npossess no detailed account of the great “confiscation” earlier than the\r\nDomesday Survey of twenty years after the battle of Hastings, and apart\r\nfrom the changes which must have occurred in the course of nature in\r\nthat time, the great survey is not the sort of authority to which we\r\nshould look for an accurate register of the fluctuating and inconsistent\r\nprinciples of a law of ownership which was derived from, and had to be\r\napplied to, conditions which were unique in Western Europe. But _a\r\npriori_ it is not probable that all the thousands of cases in which an\r\nEnglish land-owner has disappeared, and is represented by a Norman\r\nsuccessor, should be explained by exactly the same principle in every\r\ninstance. In one case the vanished thegn may have set out with Harold to\r\nthe place of battle, and his holding have been given outright by the new\r\nking to some clamorous follower; in another, a dependent of the English\r\nearl of Mercia may have become peaceably enough a dependent of the\r\nNorman earl of Shrewsbury, and have sunk into the undifferentiated\r\npeasant class before the time arrived for Domesday to take cognisance of\r\nhim; a third Englishman may have made his way to the court at Barking\r\nand bought his land of the Conqueror for his own life only, leaving his\r\nsons to seek their fortunes in Scotland or at Constantinople. The\r\npractical completeness of the actual transfer from the one race to the\r\nother should not lead us to exaggerate the simplicity of the measures by\r\nwhich it was brought about.[185]\r\n\r\nOne word should perhaps be said here about the character of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon thegnhood, on which the Conqueror’s hand fell so heavily. It\r\nwas far from being a homogeneous class. At one end of the scale were\r\ngreat men like Esegar the Staller or Tochi the son of Outi, whose wide\r\nestates formed the bulk of the important Domesday fiefs of Geoffrey de\r\nMandeville and Geoffrey Alselin. But, on the other hand, a very large\r\nproportion of the total number of men styled “thegns” can have been\r\nscarcely superior to the great mass of the peasantry whom the Norman\r\nlawyers styled collectively “villeins.” When we find in a\r\nNottinghamshire village five thegns, each in his “hall,” owning between\r\nthem land worth only ten shillings a year,[186] we see that we must\r\nbeware of the romantic associations aroused by the word “thegn.” These\r\nmen can have been distinguished from the peasantry around them by little\r\nexcept a higher personal status expressed in a proportionately higher\r\n_wergild_, and their depression into the peasant class would be rendered\r\nfatally easy by the fact that the law of status was the first part of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon social system to become antiquated. When the old rules\r\nabout _wer_ and _wite_ had been replaced by the new criminal\r\njurisprudence elaborated by the Norman conquerors, the one claim of\r\nthese mean thegns to superior social consideration vanished. And lastly,\r\nit should be noted that where the Domesday Survey does reveal members of\r\nthe thegnly class continuing to hold land directly of the king in 1086,\r\nit shows us at the same time that the class is very far from being\r\nregarded as on an equality with the Norman baronage. The king’s thegns\r\nare placed after the tenants in chief by military service, even after\r\nthe king’s servants or “sergeants” of Norman birth; they are only\r\nentered as it were on sufferance, under a heading to themselves, at the\r\nvery end of the descriptions of the several shires in which they are to\r\nbe found.[187] They belonged in fact to an order of society older than\r\nthe Norman military feudalism which supplanted them, and by the date of\r\nthe Domesday Survey they were rapidly becoming extinct as a class in the\r\nshires south of the Humber, but no financial record like Domesday Book\r\ncould be expected to tell us what became of them. Mere violent\r\ndispossession would no doubt be a great part of the story if told, but\r\nmuch of the change would have to be set down to the silent processes of\r\neconomic and social reorganisation.\r\n\r\nThere remains one other legal document, more famous than any of these\r\nwhich we have considered, which was most probably granted at or about\r\nthis time. The city of London had to be rewarded for its genuine, if\r\nbelated, submission, and the form of reward which would be likely to\r\nprove most acceptable to the citizens would be a written security that\r\ntheir ancient customs and existing property should be respected by the\r\nnew sovereign. And so “William the king greets William the bishop and\r\nGeoffrey the port-reeve and all the burghers, French and English, within\r\nLondon,” and tells them that they are to enjoy all the customs which\r\nthey possessed in King Edward’s time, that each man’s property shall\r\ndescend to his children, and that the king himself will not suffer any\r\nman to do them wrong.[188] Yet, satisfactory as this document may have\r\nbeen as a pledge of reconciliation between the king and his capital, it\r\nnevertheless bears witness in its formula of address to a significant\r\nchange. Geoffrey the port-reeve is a Norman; he is very probably the\r\nsame man as Geoffrey de Mandeville, the grandfather of the turbulent\r\nearl of Essex of Stephen’s day,[189] and his appearance thus early in\r\nthe place of Esegar the Staffer suggests that the latter had gained\r\nlittle by his duplicity in the recent negotiations. It was of the first\r\nimportance for William to be able to feel that London at least was in\r\nsafe hands; he could not well entrust his capital and its new fortress\r\nto a man who had so recently held the city against him.\r\n\r\nWilliam’s rule in England was by this time so far accepted that he could\r\nafford to recross the Channel and show himself to his old subjects\r\ninvested with his new dignities. The regency of Matilda and her advisers\r\nhad, as far as we know, passed in perfect order, but it was only fitting\r\nthat William should take the earliest opportunity of proving to the men\r\nof the duchy the perfect success of the enterprise, the burden of which\r\nthey had borne with such notable alacrity. It was partly no doubt as an\r\nostensible mark of confidence in English loyalty that, before crossing\r\nthe Channel, William dismissed so many of his mercenary troops as wished\r\nto return home[190]; but their dismissal coincides in point of time with\r\na general foundation of castles at important strategic points all over\r\nthe south of England. The Norman castle was even more repugnant than the\r\nNorman man-at-arms to the Anglo-Saxon mind, and when the native\r\nchronicler gives us his estimate of William’s character and reign he\r\nbreaks out into a poetic declamation as he describes the castles which\r\nthe king ordered to be built and the oppression thereby caused to poor\r\nmen.[191] But deeper than any memory of individual wrong must have\r\nrankled the thought that it was these new castles which had really\r\nrendered hopeless for ever the national cause of England; that local\r\ndiscontent might seethe and murmur in every shire without causing the\r\nsmallest alarm to the alien lords ensconced in their stockaded mounds.\r\nThe Shropshire-born Orderic, writing in his Norman monastery, gives us\r\nthe true military reason for the final overthrow of his native country\r\nwhen he tells us that the English possessed very few of those\r\nfortifications which the Normans called castles, and that for this\r\nreason, however brave and warlike they might be, they could not keep up\r\na determined resistance to their enemies. William himself had learned in\r\nNormandy how slow and difficult a task it was to reduce a district\r\nguarded by even the elementary fortifications of the eleventh century;\r\nhe might be confident that the task would be impossible for scattered\r\nbodies of rustic Englishmen, in revolt and without trained leadership.\r\n\r\nBut for the present there seems to have been no thought of revolt; the\r\ncastles were built with a view to future emergencies. No very elaborate\r\narrangements were made for the government of England in William’s\r\nabsence. It was entrusted jointly to William Fitz Osbern, the duke’s\r\noldest friend, and Odo of Bayeux, his half-brother, who were to be\r\nassisted by such distinguished leaders of the army of invasion as Hugh\r\nde Grentmaisnil, Hugh de Montfort, and William de Warenne. The bishop of\r\nBayeux was made primarily responsible for the custody of Kent, with its\r\nall-important ports, and the formidable castle of Dover. Hugh de\r\nGrentmaisnil appears in command of Hampshire with his headquarters at\r\nWinchester; his brother-in-law, Humphrey de Tilleul, had received the\r\ncharge of Hastings castle when it was built and continued to hold it\r\nstill; William Fitz Osbern, who had previously been created earl of\r\nHereford, seems to have been entrusted with the government of all\r\nEngland between the Thames and the earldom of Bernicia, with a possible\r\npriority over his colleagues.[192] On his part, William took care to\r\nremove from the country as many as possible of the men round whom a\r\nnational opposition might gather itself. Edgar the Etheling, earls\r\nEdwin, Morcar, and Waltheof, with Archbishop Stigand, and a prominent\r\nKentish thegn called Ethelnoth, were requested to accompany their new\r\nking on his progress through his continental dominions.[193] We cannot\r\nbut suspect that William must have felt the humour as well as the policy\r\nof attaching to his train three men each of whom had hoped to be king of\r\nthe English himself; but it would have been impossible for the native\r\nleaders to refuse to grace the protracted triumphs of their conqueror,\r\nand early in the year the company set sail, with dramatic fitness, from\r\nPevensey.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts which we possess of this visit, it appears as little\r\nmore than a series of ecclesiastical pageants. William was wisely\r\nprodigal of the spoils of England to the churches of his duchy. The\r\nabbey church of Jumièges, whose building had been the work of Robert,\r\nthe Confessor’s favourite, was visited and dedicated on the 1st of July,\r\nbut before this the king had kept a magnificent Easter feast at\r\nFécamp[194] where, thirty-two years before, Duke Robert of Normandy had\r\nprevailed upon the Norman baronage to acknowledge his seven-year-old\r\nillegitimate son as his destined successor. The festival at Fécamp was\r\nattended by a number of nobles from beyond the Norman border, who seem\r\nto have regarded Edwin and Morcar and their fellows as interesting\r\nbarbarians, whose long hair gave unwonted picturesqueness to a formal\r\nceremony. At St.-Pierre-sur-Dive, where William had spent four weary\r\nweeks in the previous autumn, waiting for a south wind, another great\r\nassembly was held on the 1st of May, to witness the consecration of the\r\nnew church of Notre Dame. Two months later came the hallowing of\r\nJumièges; and the death of Archbishop Maurilius of Rouen, early in\r\nAugust, seems to have given occasion for another of these great councils\r\nto meet and confirm the canonical election of his successor. The monks\r\nof Rouen cathedral had chosen no less a person than Lanfranc of Caen as\r\ntheir head, but he, possibly not without a previous consultation with\r\nhis friend and lord King William, declined the office, and when on a\r\nsecond election John, bishop of Avranches, was chosen, Lanfranc went to\r\nRome and obtained the pallium for him.[195] Whether Lanfranc’s journey\r\npossessed any significance in view of impending changes in the English\r\nChurch, is unfortunately uncertain for lack of evidence; but his refusal\r\nof the metropolitan see of Normandy suggests that already he was\r\nprivately reserved for greater things. In any case, he is the man to\r\nwhom we should naturally expect William to entrust such messages as he\r\nmight think prudent to send to the Pope concerning his recent\r\nachievements and future policy in England.\r\n\r\nFrom his triumphal progress in Normandy, William was recalled by bad\r\nnews from beyond the Channel. Neither of his lieutenants seems to have\r\npossessed a trace of the more statesmanlike qualities of his chief.\r\nWilliam Fitz Osbern, good soldier and faithful friend to William as we\r\nmay acknowledge him to have been, did not in the least degree understand\r\nthe difficult task of reconciling a conquered people to a change of\r\nmasters, and Bishop Odo has left a sinister memory on English soil.\r\nWilliam’s departure for Normandy was signalised by a general outbreak of\r\nthe characteristic vices of an army of occupation, in regard to which\r\nthe regents themselves, according to the Norman account, were not a\r\nlittle to blame. Under the stimulus of direct oppression, and in the\r\ntemporary absence of the dreaded Conqueror, the passive discontent of\r\nthe English broke out into open revolt in three widely separated parts\r\nof the kingdom.\r\n\r\nOf the three risings, that in the north was perhaps the least\r\nimmediately formidable, but the most suggestive of future difficulties\r\nfor the Norman rulers. Copsige, the Northumbrian thegn who had submitted\r\nat Barking, had been invested with the government of his native\r\nprovince, but the men of that district continued to acknowledge an\r\nEnglish ruler in Oswulf, the son of Eadwulf, who had been subordinate\r\nearl of Bernicia under Morcar. Copsige in the first instance was able to\r\ndispossess his rival, but the latter bided his time, collected around\r\nhim a gang of outlaws, and surprised Copsige as he was feasting one day\r\nat Newburn-on-Tyne. The earl escaped for a moment, and took sanctuary in\r\nthe village church; but his refuge was betrayed, the church was\r\nimmediately set on fire, and he himself was cut down as he tried to\r\nbreak away from the burning building.[196] The whole affair was not so\r\nmuch a deliberate revolt against the Norman rule as the settlement of a\r\nprivate feud after the customary Northumbrian fashion, and it may quite\r\npossibly have taken place before William had sailed for Normandy. Oswulf\r\nwas able to maintain himself through the following summer, but then met\r\nhis end in an obscure struggle with a highway robber, and the province\r\nwas left without an earl until the end of the year, when Gospatric, the\r\nson of Maldred, a noble who possessed an hereditary claim to the title,\r\ncame to court and bought the earldom outright from William.[197] In the\r\nmeantime, however, the Northumbrians were well content with a spell of\r\nuncontested anarchy, and they made no attempt to assist the insurgents\r\nelsewhere in the country.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the western rising was a certain Edric, nicknamed the\r\n“Wild,” whom the Normans believed to be the nephew of Edric Streona, the\r\nfamous traitor of Ethelred’s time. This man had submitted to the\r\nConqueror, but apparently refused to accompany him into Normandy, and\r\nthe Norman garrison of Hereford castle began to ravage his lands. In\r\nthis way he was driven into open revolt, and he thereupon invited\r\nBleddyn and Rhiwallon, the kings of Gwynedd and Powys, to join him in a\r\nplundering expedition over Herefordshire, which devastated that country\r\nas far as the river Lugg, but cannot have done much to weaken the Norman\r\nmilitary possession of the shire.[198] Having secured much booty, Edric\r\nwithdrew into the hills with his Welsh allies, and next appears in\r\nhistory two years later, when he returned to play a part in the general\r\ntumult which disquieted England in 1069.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable of the three revolts which marked the period of\r\nWilliam’s absence had for its object the recovery of Dover castle from\r\nits Norman garrison.[199] It is the one rising of the three which has an\r\nintelligible military motive, and it contains certain features which\r\nsuggest that it was planned by some one possessed of greater political\r\nability than can be credited to the ordinary English thegn. Count\r\nEustace of Boulogne, the man of highest rank among the French\r\nauxiliaries of the Conqueror, had already received an extensive grant of\r\nland in England as the reward for his services in the campaign of\r\nHastings, but he had somehow fallen into disfavour with the king and had\r\nleft the country. The rebel leaders knowing this, and judging the count\r\nto be a competent leader, chose for once to forget racial differences in\r\na possible chance of emancipation, and invited him to cross the Channel\r\nand take possession of Dover castle. Eustace, like Stephen of Blois, a\r\nmore famous count of Boulogne, found it an advantage to control the\r\nshortest passage from France to England; he embarked a large force of\r\nknights on board a number of vessels which were at his command, and made\r\na night crossing in the hope of finding the garrison within the castle\r\noff their guard. At the moment of his landing Odo of Bayeux and Hugh de\r\nMontfort happened to have drawn off the main body of their troops across\r\nthe Thames; a fact which suggests that the rebels had observed unusual\r\nsecrecy in planning their movements. The count was therefore able to\r\noccupy the town, and to lay siege to the castle without hindrance, but\r\nfailed to take the garrison by surprise, as he had hoped, and met a\r\nspirited resistance. The assault lasted for some hours, but the garrison\r\nmore than held their own, and at last Eustace gave his troops the signal\r\nto retire to their ships, although it was known that a delay of two days\r\nwould have brought large reinforcements to the side of the insurgents.\r\nIt must also have been known that the same time would have brought Odo\r\nof Bayeux with his trained troops within dangerous proximity to Dover;\r\nand the impossibility in the eleventh century of successfully conducting\r\na siege against time is some excuse for Eustace’s rather ignominious\r\nwithdrawal. The first sign of retreat, however, was turned to the\r\nadvantage of the garrison, who immediately made a sally and threw the\r\nbesiegers into a state of confusion which was heightened by a false\r\nrumour that the bishop of Bayeux was at hand. A large part of the\r\nBoulogne force was destroyed in a desperate attempt to reach the ships,\r\na number of men apparently trying to climb down the face of the cliffs\r\non which Dover castle stands. Count Eustace himself, who knew the\r\nneighbourhood, became separated from his men and escaped on horseback to\r\nan unrecorded port, where he was fortunate enough to find a ship ready\r\nto put out to sea. The English, thus deprived of their leader, dispersed\r\nthemselves over the country, and so avoided the immediate consequences\r\nof their rout, since the Norman force in Dover was not strong enough to\r\nhunt down the broken rebels along all their scattered lines of\r\nretreat.[200]\r\n\r\nWith his kingdom outwardly restored to order, but simmering with\r\nsuppressed revolt, William set sail from Dieppe on the 6th of December,\r\nand landed at Winchelsea on the following day. Queen Matilda was still\r\nleft in charge of Normandy, but her eldest son, Robert, was now\r\nassociated with her in the government, and Roger de Beaumont, who had\r\nbeen the leading member of her council during her regency in 1066, on\r\nthis occasion accompanied his lord to England.[201] The king kept his\r\nChristmas feast at Westminster; a ceremony in which the men of both\r\nraces joined on an equal footing, and for the moment there may have\r\nseemed a possibility that the recent disorders had really been the last\r\nexpiring efforts of English nationalism. Yet the prospect for the new\r\nyear was in reality very threatening. The political situation in England\r\nat this time is well described by Ordericus Vitalis, who tells us that\r\nevery district of which William had taken military possession lay at his\r\ncommand, but that in the extreme north and west men were only prepared\r\nto render such obedience as pleased themselves, wishing to be as\r\nindependent of King William as they had formerly been independent of\r\nKing Edward and his predecessors.[202] This attitude, which supplies a\r\npartial explanation of the overthrow of England in 1066, and a partial\r\njustification of the harrying of Northumbria in 1069, supplies also a\r\nclue to the purpose underlying William’s ceaseless activity during the\r\nnext two years. At Exeter, Stafford, and York, William was, in effect,\r\nteaching his new subjects that he would be content with nothing less\r\nthan the unqualified submission of the whole land; that England was no\r\nlonger to be a collection of semi-independent earldoms, but a coherent\r\nstate, under the direct rule of a king identified with Wessex no more\r\nthan with Northumbria or East Anglia. The union of England, thus brought\r\nat last into being, was no doubt achieved almost unconsciously under the\r\ndictation of the practical expediency of the moment, but this does not\r\ndetract from the greatness of the work itself, nor from the strength and\r\nwisdom of the Conqueror whose memorial it is.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, danger from a distant quarter was threatening the Norman\r\npossession of England. Events which were matters of very recent history\r\nhad proved that English politics were still an object of interest to the\r\nrulers of Norway and Denmark; and the present was an opportunity which\r\ncould not fail to attract any Scandinavian prince who would emulate the\r\nglory of the great kings of the last generation. The death of Harold\r\nHardrada, which had thrown the Norwegian claims on England into abeyance\r\nfor a time, had left Swegn Estrithson, king of Denmark, unquestionably\r\nthe most considerable personage in the Scandinavian world; and to him\r\naccordingly the English leaders, or such at least of them as were at\r\nliberty, had appealed for help during the preceding months.[203] As a\r\nDane himself and the nephew of Cnut, Swegn Estrithson could command the\r\nparticular sympathy of the men of Northumbria and would not be\r\nunacceptable to the men of the southern Danelaw; no native claimant\r\npossessed similar advantages in respect to anything like so large a part\r\nof England. Swegn indeed, whose prevailing quality was a caution which\r\ncontrasts strangely with the character of his Danish ancestors and of\r\nhis great Norwegian rival, had delayed taking action up to the present,\r\nbut it was the fear that a northern fleet might suddenly appear in the\r\nHumber which had really been the immediate cause of William’s return\r\nfrom Normandy.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, with the imminent probability of invasion hanging over\r\nthe north and east of his kingdom, William was called away from his\r\nhead-quarters at London by the necessity of suppressing a dangerous\r\nrising in the extreme west. It is probable that William’s rule had not\r\nyet been commonly recognised beyond the eastern border of Devonshire,\r\nalthough on the evidence of writs we know that Somerset was already\r\nshowing him ostensible obedience. But the main interest of the following\r\nepisode lies in the strangely independent attitude adopted by the city\r\nof Exeter. In the eleventh century the capital of Devon could\r\nundoubtedly claim to rank with York, Norwich, and Winchester among the\r\nhalf-dozen most powerful cities in England. With its strong\r\nfortifications which made it in a sense the key of the Damnonian\r\npeninsula, commanding also important trade routes between England,\r\nIreland, and Brittany, Exeter in English hands would be a standing\r\nmenace to the Norman rule scarcely less formidable than an independent\r\nYork. The temper of the citizens was violently anti-Norman, and they\r\nproceeded to take energetic measures towards making good their defence,\r\ngoing so far as to impress into their service such foreign merchants\r\nwithin the city as were able to bear arms. We are also told that they\r\ntried to induce other cities to join them in resisting the foreign king,\r\nand it is not impossible that they may have drawn reinforcements from\r\nthe opposite shore of Brittany. It was of the first importance for\r\nWilliam to crush a revolt of this magnitude before it had time to\r\nspread, but before taking action, and probably in order to test the\r\ntruth of the reports which had come to him as to what was going on in\r\nDevonshire, he sent to demand that the chief men of Exeter should take\r\nthe oath of allegiance to him. They in reply proposed a curious\r\ncompromise, saying that they were willing to pay the customary dues of\r\ntheir city to the king, but that they would not swear allegiance to him\r\nnor admit him within their walls. This was almost equivalent to defiance\r\nand elicited from William the remark that it was not his custom to have\r\nsubjects on such terms. Negotiations in fact ceased; Devonshire became a\r\nhostile country, and William marched from London, making the experiment,\r\ndoubly bold at such a crisis, of calling out the native fyrd to assist\r\nin the reduction of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe men of Exeter, on hearing the news of William’s approach, began to\r\nfear that they had gone too far; and, as the king drew near, the chief\r\nmen of the city came out to meet him, bringing hostages and making a\r\ncomplete capitulation. William halted four miles from the city, but the\r\nenvoys on their return found that their fellow-citizens, unwilling\r\napparently to trust to the king’s mercy, were making preparations for a\r\ncontinued resistance, and they threw in their lot with their townsmen.\r\nWilliam was filled with fury on hearing the news. His position was\r\nindeed sufficiently difficult. It was the depth of winter; part of his\r\narmy was composed of Englishmen whose loyalty might not survive an\r\nunexpected check to his arms, and Swegn of Denmark might land in the\r\neast at any moment. Before investing the city William tried a piece of\r\nintimidation, and when the army had moved up to the walls, one of the\r\nhostages was deliberately blinded in front of the gate. But it would\r\nseem that the determination of the citizens was only strengthened by the\r\nghastly sight, and for eighteen days William was detained before the\r\ngates of Exeter, despite his constant endeavours either to carry the\r\nwalls by assault or to undermine them.\r\n\r\nAt last, after many of his men had fallen in the attack, it would seem\r\nthat the Conqueror for once in his life was driven to offer terms to the\r\ndefenders of a revolted city. The details of the closing scene of the\r\nsiege are not very clear; but it is probable that the more important\r\ncitizens were now, as earlier in the struggle, in favour of submission,\r\nand that they persuaded their fellows to take advantage of King\r\nWilliam’s offer of peace. They had indeed a particular reason for trying\r\nto secure the royal favour, for the chief burden of taxation in any town\r\nfell naturally upon its wealthier inhabitants, and on the present\r\noccasion William seems to have given a promise that the customary\r\npayments due to the king from the town should not be increased. The\r\npoorer folk of Exeter secured a free pardon and a pledge of security for\r\nlife and property, but the conduct of their leaders undoubtedly implies\r\na certain lack of disinterested zeal for the national cause; and the\r\nnative chronicler significantly remarks that the citizens gave up the\r\ntown “because the thegns had betrayed them.” The other side of the\r\npicture is shown by Ordericus Vitalis, who describes how “a procession\r\nof the most beautiful maidens, the elders of the city, and the clergy\r\ncarrying their sacred books and holy vessels” went out to meet the king,\r\nand made submission to him. It has been conjectured with great\r\nprobability that the real object of the procession was to obtain from\r\nthe king an oath to observe the terms of the capitulation sworn on the\r\nsaid “sacred books and holy vessels,” and in any case the witness of\r\nDomesday Book shows that Exeter suffered no fiscal penalty for its\r\ndaring resistance. To keep the men of Exeter in hand for the future a\r\ncastle was built and entrusted to Baldwin de Meules, the son of Count\r\nGilbert of Brionne, but this was no mark of particular disfavour, for it\r\nwas universally a matter of policy for William to guard against civic\r\nrevolts by the foundation of precautionary fortresses.[204]\r\n\r\nOne immediate consequence of the fall of Exeter was the flight and final\r\nexile of one of the two greatest ladies in England at this time. Gytha,\r\nthe niece of Cnut, and the widow of Earl Godwine, through whom Harold\r\nhad inherited a strain of royal blood, had taken refuge in Exeter, and\r\nnow, before William had entered the city, made her escape by water with\r\na number of other women, who probably feared the outrages which were\r\nlikely to occur upon the entry of the northern army. They must have\r\nrounded the Land’s End, and sailed up the Bristol Channel, for they next\r\nappear as taking up their quarters on a dismal island known as the Flat\r\nHolme, off the coast of Glamorgan. Here they stayed for a long while,\r\nbut at last in despair the fugitives left their cheerless refuge and\r\nsailed without molestation to Flanders, where they landed, and were\r\nhospitably entertained at St. Omer. Nothing more is recorded of the\r\ncountess; but her daughter Gunhild entered the monastic life and died in\r\npeace in Flanders in 1087, some two months before the great enemy of her\r\nhouse expired at Rouen.\r\n\r\nIt is likely enough that Gytha chose the Flat Holme as her place of\r\nrefuge with the hope of joining in a movement which at this time was\r\ngathering head among the English exiles in Ireland. It is at least\r\ncertain that, before the summer was over, three of Harold’s illegitimate\r\nsons, who had spent the previous year with the king of Dublin, suddenly\r\nentered the Devon seas with fifty-four ships. They harassed the south\r\ncoast of the Bristol Channel, and even made bold to enter the Avon and\r\nattack Bristol itself, but were driven off without much difficulty by\r\nthe citizens of the wealthy port, and sailing back disembarked at some\r\nunknown point on the coast of Somerset. Here they were caught and\r\nsoundly beaten by the Somersetshire natives under the leadership of\r\nEdnoth, an Englishman who had been master of the horse to Edward the\r\nConfessor, but who was clearly ready to do loyal service to the new\r\nking. Ednoth was killed in the battle, but the raiders were compelled to\r\ntake to their ships, and after a brief spell of desultory ravage along\r\nthe coast they sailed back to Ireland, having done nothing to weaken the\r\nNorman grip upon the south-west of England, but gaining sufficient\r\nplunder to induce them to repeat their expedition in the course of the\r\nfollowing year.[205]\r\n\r\nIt was well for William that even at the cost of some loss of prestige\r\nhe had gained possession of Exeter in the first months of 1068, for the\r\nremainder of the year saw a general outburst of revolt against the\r\nNorman rule. Before returning to the east of England, William made an\r\narmed demonstration in Cornwall; and it was very possibly at this time\r\nthat he established his half-brother, Count Robert of Mortain, in a\r\nterritorial position in that Celtic land which shows that the Conqueror\r\nwas quite willing upon occasions to create compact fiefs according to\r\nthe continental model. Count Robert was never invested with any formal\r\nearldom of Cornwall, but in the western peninsula he occupied a position\r\nof greater territorial strength, if of lower official rank, than that\r\nheld by his brother, Bishop Odo, in his distant shire of Kent. The\r\nrevolt of Exeter had no doubt taught William that it would be advisable\r\nto take any future rising in Devonshire in the rear by turning Cornwall\r\ninto a single Norman estate, and his own presence with an army in the\r\nwest at this time would go far to simplify the preliminary work of\r\nconfiscation.\r\n\r\nHis Cornish progress over, King William marched eastwards, disbanded the\r\nfyrd, and kept his Easter feast (March 23d) at Winchester. For a few\r\nweeks the land was at peace, and during this breathing space the Duchess\r\nMatilda came across into England, and was crowned at Westminster on\r\nWhitsunday (May 11th), by Ealdred, archbishop of York. The event was a\r\nclear expression of William’s desire to reign as an English king, for\r\nMatilda stayed in England, and her fourth son, Henry, who was born early\r\nin the next year, possessed in English eyes the precedence, which by\r\nAnglo-Saxon custom belonged to the son of a crowned king and his lady,\r\nborn in the land. Robert, the destined heir of Normandy, seems to have\r\nremained in charge of the duchy, and Richard, the Conqueror’s second\r\nson, probably accompanied his mother across the Channel. By a fortunate\r\nchance, we happen to know with exactitude the names of those who were\r\npresent at the Whitsuntide festival,[206] and the list is significant.\r\nAmong the members of the clerical estate the Norman hierarchy supplied\r\nthe bishops of Bayeux, Lisieux, and Coutances, but the arch-bishops of\r\nCanterbury and York and the bishops of Exeter, Ramsbury, Wells, and\r\nLondon were all of English appointment, although the last four of them\r\nwere of foreign birth, and the eight abbots who were present were also\r\nmen of King Edward’s day. The laymen who attended the ceremony formed a\r\nmore heterogeneous group; Edwin, Morcar, and Waltheof seem strangely out\r\nof place side by side with the counts of Mortain and Eu; with William\r\nFitz Osbern, Roger de Montgomery and Richard, the son of Count Gilbert\r\nof Brionne. The company which came together in Westminster Abbey on that\r\nWhitsunday supplies a striking picture of the old order which was\r\nchanging but had not yet given place to the new, and it is a notable\r\nthing that the ancestress of all Plantagenet, Tudor, and Stuart kings\r\nshould have been crowned in the sight of men who had held the highest\r\nplace in the realm in the last days of independent England.\r\n\r\nThis solemn inauguration of the new dynasty can have been passed but a\r\nfew weeks before William had to resume the dreary task of suppressing\r\nhis irreconcilable subjects. After a year and a half of acquiescence in\r\nthe Norman rule, Earls Edwin and Morcar suddenly made a spasmodic\r\nattempt to raise the country against the foreigners. Their position at\r\nWilliam’s court must have been ignominious at the best, and although, as\r\nwe have seen, the king had promised one of his daughters in marriage to\r\nEdwin, he had withheld her up to the present in deference to the\r\njealousy which his Normans felt for the favoured Englishman. Under the\r\nsmart of their personal grievances, Edwin and his brother broke away\r\nfrom the court, and headed a revolt which, although general in\r\ncharacter, seems to have received most support in Morcar’s earldom of\r\nNorthumbria. The rising is also marked by a revival of the alliance\r\nbetween the house of Leofric and the Welsh princes which had been an\r\noccasional cause of disquiet during the Confessor’s reign; for Bleddyn,\r\nthe king of North Wales, came to the assistance of Edwin and\r\nMorcar,[207] as in the previous year he had joined the Herefordshire\r\nraid of Edric the Wild. The rising was the occasion for a general\r\nsecession of the leading Englishmen from William’s court, for Edgar the\r\nEtheling and his mother and sisters, together with Marleswegen and many\r\nprominent Northumbrians, headed by Gospatric, their newly appointed\r\nearl, probably fearing that they might be held implicated in the guilt\r\nof Edwin and Morcar, made a speedy departure for the north country.[208]\r\n\r\nThe focus of disturbance was evidently the city of York. It is not\r\nprobable that William had hitherto made any systematic attempt to\r\nestablish Norman rule beyond the Humber, but we get a glimpse of the\r\nvenerable Archbishop Aldred making strenuous efforts to restrain the\r\nviolence of the men of his city. His protestations were useless, and\r\nwhile the Northumbrians were enthusiastically preparing for war after\r\nthe manner of their ancestors, William was taking steps which brought\r\nthe revolt to an end within a few weeks without the striking of a single\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with these events that Orderic makes the\r\nobservations which have already been quoted about the part played by the\r\nNorman castle in thwarting the bravest efforts of insurgent Englishmen.\r\nSome of the greatest fortresses of medieval England derive their origin\r\nfrom the defensive posts founded by William during the war of 1068. “In\r\nconsequence of these commotions,” said Orderic, “the King carefully\r\nsurveyed the most inaccessible points in the country, and, selecting\r\nsuitable places, fortified them against the raids of the enemy.”[209]\r\nBut besides these “inaccessible points” we have seen that William made\r\nit a matter of regular policy to plant a castle in all the greater\r\nboroughs and along all the more important lines of road in the country,\r\nand, the present campaign affords an excellent example of his practice\r\nin this matter. The first fortress recorded as having been built at this\r\ntime was the humble earthwork which developed in the next two centuries\r\ninto the magnificent castle of Warwick. Henry de Beaumont, son of the\r\nRoger de Beaumont who had been Queen Matilda’s adviser in 1066, was\r\nplaced in command of it, and the Conqueror marched northward; but,\r\npossibly before he had left the Avon valley, Edwin and Morcar, now as\r\never unable to follow a consistent course of action, suddenly abandoned\r\ntheir own cause and made an ignominious submission. The surrender of the\r\nrebel leaders did not affect the king’s movements; he continued his\r\nadvance, probably harrying the plain of Leicester as he passed across\r\nit, and at Nottingham, on a precipitous cliff overhanging the town, he\r\nplaced another castle, commanding the Trent valley at the point where\r\nthe river is crossed by one of the great roads from London to the north\r\nof England. The march was resumed without delay, and at some point on\r\nthe road north of Nottingham the army was met by the citizens of York,\r\nbringing the keys of their city, and offering to give hostages for their\r\nfuture good behaviour. The defection of Edwin and Morcar had deprived\r\nthe rising of its nominal leaders, and the military occupation of\r\nNottingham had threatened to isolate the revolted area; but it is\r\nalso probable that William’s rapid movements had surprised the\r\ndefenders of the northern capital before their preparations were\r\ncompleted. At York itself a certain Archil, who was regarded by the\r\nNormans as the most powerful man in Northumbria, came in to William and\r\ngave his son as a hostage, and on the line of the city walls, at the\r\njunction of the rivers Ouse and Foss, there arose the third castle of\r\nthis campaign, now represented only by the mound on which rests the\r\nfamous medieval keep known as “Clifford’s Tower.” The fortress was\r\ngarrisoned with picked men, but its castellan, Robert Fitz Richard, is\r\nonly known to us through the circumstances of his death in the next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOther matters than the fortifications of York demanded King William’s\r\nattention at this time. Danger was threatening from the side of\r\nScotland, for the rebels had sought the help of King Malcolm Canmore,\r\nand a great army was gathering beyond the Tweed. The northern frontier\r\nof England was as yet unprotected by the castles of Berwick and\r\nCarlisle, and on the west the possessions of the king of Scots extended\r\nas far south as Morecambe Bay. Also the best English authority asserts\r\nthat Edgar the Etheling and his friends had already taken refuge with\r\nKing Malcolm on their flight from William’s court, and the marriage of\r\nthe etheling’s sister to the Scottish king was very shortly to make the\r\nnorthern kingdom a _point d’appui_ for all unquiet nationalists in\r\nEngland. There was clearly good reason for William to define his\r\nposition with regard to the king of Scots, and this the more as it would\r\ngive him an opportunity of claiming fealty as well as submission at a\r\nmoment when he was all-powerful in the north. An ambassador was found in\r\nthe person of Bishop Ethelwine of Durham, who had revolted with the rest\r\nof Northumbria, but had made his peace with the Conqueror, and conducted\r\nthe present business to a successful issue. King Malcolm sent\r\nrepresentatives to York in company with the bishop of Durham, and\r\naccording to the Norman account they swore fealty to William in the name\r\nof their master. It was no part of the Conqueror’s plan to engage in an\r\nunnecessary war in Scotland, and, all the purposes of his northern\r\njourney being for the present accomplished, he turned south again by way\r\nof Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge, at each of which places the\r\ninevitable castle was raised and garrisoned.[210]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denier of Baldwin of Lille]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                   THE DANISH INVASION AND ITS SEQUEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1068 had closed under a specious appearance of peace, and the\r\nonly result of the revolts of Exeter and York had been a proof of the\r\nfutility of isolated resistance to a king who could strike with equal\r\ndecision at the west or north. The following year opened with two\r\nnorth-country risings which formed an unconcerted prelude to fifteen\r\nmonths of incessant strife, in which the strength of the Norman hold on\r\nEngland was finally tested and proved. The flight of Gospatric in the\r\nprevious summer had vacated the Bernician earldom, and at the beginning\r\nof 1069 the Conqueror tried the experiment of appointing a Norman baron\r\nto the command of the border province. His choice fell on one Robert de\r\nComines, who immediately set out for the north at the head of a force of\r\nfive hundred knights. The news of his appointment preceded him, and the\r\nmen of Northumbria, who had enjoyed virtual independence for two years,\r\nwere not minded to submit quietly to the rule of a foreign earl. A\r\nleague was accordingly formed, the members of which bound themselves\r\neither to kill the stranger or to perish in the attempt. Bishop\r\nEthelwine of Durham had evidently heard rumours of the plot, for as the\r\nearl approached Durham he was met by the bishop, who warned him of the\r\nimpending danger. Robert took no heed, and his troops behaved badly as\r\nthey entered Durham, killing certain of the bishop’s humbler tenants,\r\nbut meeting no armed opposition. The earl was entertained in a house\r\nbelonging to the bishop, and his men were quartered all over the town,\r\nin open defiance of the bishop’s warning. But during the night a large\r\nbody of Northumbrians moved up to the city, and as dawn broke they burst\r\nthrough the gates and began a deliberate massacre of the Frenchmen. The\r\nsurprise was complete, but the earl and his immediate companions were\r\naroused in time to enable them to make a fight for their lives. They\r\ncould expect no quarter, and their defence was so desperate that the\r\nrebels were unable to break into the house, and at last set it on fire,\r\nthe earl and his men perishing in the flames. Of the five hundred\r\nNormans in Durham, only one survivor made his escape.[211]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  YORKSHIRE\r\n  1066–1087]\r\n\r\nThis episode was quickly followed by the death of Robert Fitz Richard,\r\nthe governor of York, who perished with a number of his men in an\r\nobscure struggle, which nevertheless left the castle untaken in Norman\r\nhands. Encouraged by these events, Edgar the Etheling, Marleswegen,\r\nArchil, and Gospatric reappeared upon the scene, and made a determined\r\nattack upon the fortress, so that William Malet, who would appear to\r\nhave become castellan on Robert Fitz Richard’s death, sent an urgent\r\nmessage to the king, saying that he must surrender at once unless he\r\nreceived reinforcements. Upon receiving this appeal, the Conqueror flew\r\nin person to York, scattered the rebels with heavy loss, and planted a\r\nsecond castle within a few hundred yards of the first, but on the\r\nopposite bank of the Ouse. This fortress, of which the mound, known as\r\nthe Baile Hill, still rests against the city wall, was committed to the\r\ncharge of no less a person than Earl William Fitz Osbern, and the king\r\nafter eight days returned to Winchester to keep his Easter feast there.\r\nHis departure was followed by a renewal of the English attack, now\r\ndirected against both the castles, but William Fitz Osbern and his men\r\ngave a good account of themselves against the insurgents.[212]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, apparent by this time that a spirit of revolt was\r\ngenerally abroad, and Queen Matilda was sent back into Normandy to\r\nassume command of the duchy once more. No very coherent narrative of the\r\nmilitary events of this year can be extracted from the confused tale of\r\nOrdericus Vitalis or the jejune annals of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_,\r\nbut the outline of the history is fairly plain. We seem to recognise\r\nthree distinct areas of revolt: Devon and Somerset, Shropshire and\r\nStaffordshire, and, most dangerous of all, Yorkshire and the north. We\r\nhave no reason to suppose that the English leaders had any thought of\r\nuniting in common resistance to the Norman rule; their plans extended to\r\nnothing more than the destruction of single fortresses, the execution of\r\nisolated revenge for local injuries. On the other hand the dispersion of\r\nthe centres of revolt incidentally produced some of the effects of\r\ncombination; the Normans were compelled to divide their forces, and the\r\nrapidity with which King William dashed about the country from point to\r\npoint proved that he at least thought the situation sufficiently\r\nprecarious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE BAILE HILL, YORK\r\n  THE SITE OF WILLIAM I.’S SECOND CASTLE]\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer the three sons of Harold repeated their piratical\r\nexcursion of the previous year. They landed on the 24th of June in the\r\nmouth of the Taw with sixty-six ships and raided over a large part of\r\nDevonshire, but were beaten off at last by Brian of Penthievre, and\r\nvanish therewith from English history.[213] The local forces were\r\ncapable of dealing with an unsupported raid of this kind, but the case\r\nwas otherwise with the powerful armament which at this time was being\r\nprepared in the fiords of Denmark. Swegn Esthrithson at last was about\r\nto take action, and the news excited once more the unstable patriotism\r\nof the men of Northumbria. The Danish army was recruited from a wide\r\narea to the south of the Baltic; there were numerous adventurers from\r\nPoland, Frisia, and Saxony, and we read of a contingent of heathen\r\nsavages from Lithuania. The fleet was reported to consist of two hundred\r\nand forty vessels; a number capable, if each ship was fully laden, of\r\ncarrying a force considerably larger than any army William could put\r\ninto the field without calling out the native militia. The expedition\r\nwas under the command of Harold and Cnut, the sons of King Swegn, and\r\nAsbiorn, his brother, and included many Danes of high rank, among whom\r\nChristian, bishop of Aarhus, is mentioned by name.[214]\r\n\r\nThe fleet set sail towards the end of August, and must have hugged the\r\nshores of Frisia and Holland, for it first touched the English coast at\r\nDover. The royal forces were strong enough to prevent a landing both\r\nhere and at Sandwich, where the Danes repeated the attempt, but the\r\nmouth of the Orwell was unguarded, and a body of the invaders\r\ndisembarked at Ipswich with the intention of plundering the\r\nneighbourhood. We are, however, told that the “country people,” by which\r\nphrase the English peasantry of the district are probably meant, came\r\nout and, after killing thirty of the raiders, drove the rest to seek\r\nrefuge in their ships. A similar descent on Norwich was repulsed by Ralf\r\nde Wader, earl of East Anglia and governor of Norwich castle, and the\r\nDanes passed on towards the Humber. In the meantime, news of these\r\nevents was brought to King William, who, we are told, was hunting at the\r\ntime in the forest of Dean away on the Welsh border; and he, seeing\r\nwhere the key to the situation really lay, instantly sent a messenger to\r\nYork to warn the garrison and to direct that they should summon him in\r\nperson if they were hard pressed by the enemy. He received the\r\nreassuring answer that they would require no assistance from him for a\r\nyear to come, and he accordingly continued to leave the defence of the\r\nnorth in the hands of his subordinates, while the Danes were sailing\r\nalong the coast of Lindsey.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question how far the men of the English Danelaw may\r\nhave been led by a remembrance of their Scandinavian origin to make\r\ncommon cause with the army of the king of Denmark at this time. At the\r\nbeginning of the century Swegn Forkbeard had been welcomed on this\r\naccount by the men of the shires along the lower Trent, and had fixed\r\nhis headquarters at Gainsborough in this district. So long as the\r\nAnglo-Saxon legal system retained a semblance of vitality a very\r\ndefinite barrier of customary law separated the Danelaw from the\r\ncounties of the eastern midlands, and the details of its local\r\norganisation still preserved not a few peculiar features, plainly\r\nreferable to a northern origin. On the other hand, in the names of the\r\npre-Conquest owners of land in this district as recorded in Domesday\r\nBook the English element distinctly preponderates, while the\r\nparticularism of Northumbria itself was perhaps rather political than\r\nracial. It is probable that the men of Lincolnshire would have preferred\r\na Danish to either a Norman or an English king, but they play no\r\ndistinctive part in the incidents of this campaign, which centres round\r\nthe city of York and its approaches by land and water.\r\n\r\nWhile the Danish fleet still hung in the Humber, it was joined by the\r\nEnglish exiles from Scotland, Edgar the Etheling, Gospatric, and\r\nMarleswegen, with whom Waltheof, the earl of Huntingdon, and others of\r\nlesser fame now associated themselves. Edgar, who had been raiding in\r\nLincolnshire independently of his Danish friends, had narrowly escaped\r\ncapture by the garrison of Lincoln castle; but he reached the Humber in\r\nsafety though with only two companions, and the combined force, like\r\nthat of Harold Hardrada three years before, passed on up the Ouse and\r\ndisembarked for a direct attack on York. Volunteers assembled from all\r\nthe neighbouring country, and in numbers at least it was a formidable\r\narmy which on the 21st of September appeared before the northern\r\ncapital, the English forming the van, the Danish host the rear. The\r\nNormans in York made no attempt to hold the city wall, and concentrated\r\ntheir defence on the two fortresses by the Ouse, setting fire to the\r\nadjoining buildings, so that their timber might not be used to fill up\r\nthe castle ditches. The flames spread, the city was gutted, and, what\r\nwas worse to the medieval mind, the church of St. Peter was involved in\r\nthe ruin. The struggle which followed was soon over; on the very day of\r\nthe Danish arrival, while the city was still burning, the garrison of\r\nthe castles made a sally, were outnumbered by the enemy within the city\r\nwalls and destroyed, after which the capture of the actual\r\nfortifications was an easy matter. The castles themselves were only\r\nwooden structures planted on mounds of earth; their defenders had been\r\nhopelessly weakened by the failure of the sally, and later tradition\r\nrecounted in verse how Waltheof, Siward’s son, stood by the gate and\r\nsmote down the Normans one by one to the number of a hundred with his\r\naxe as they tried to break away.[215] The castles once taken, the\r\nEnglish hatred of these signs of bondage broke out with fury; the wooden\r\nbuildings were instantly broken up and hurled to the ground, and the\r\nluckless William Malet, with his wife and children, a prisoner, was one\r\nof the few Normans in York who survived the day.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of September, before the Danish army had sighted the walls\r\nof York, Archbishop Ealdred, one of the few Englishmen of high rank who\r\naccepted the Norman Conquest as irreversible, died, being worn out by\r\nextreme age, and grief at the ruin which he foresaw was about to fall on\r\nthe men of his province. The fall of York was the most serious check\r\nwhich had hitherto crossed King William’s plans in Normandy or England;\r\nit might easily lead to the formation of a Danish principality beyond\r\nthe Humber; it was certain to give encouragement to rebellious movements\r\nin the south. In his rage at the news the king caused the fugitives who\r\nhad told the tale to be horribly mutilated as a warning to his captains\r\nagainst possible treachery[216] and then set out for the north. As he\r\ndrew towards the Northumbrian border, the Danes abandoned their new\r\nconquest, and made for their ships, crossing the Humber in them, and\r\nestablished themselves among the marshes of the Isle of Axholme. This\r\nmovement diverted the king’s march; he struck straight for Lindsey with\r\na force of cavalry and crushed sundry isolated bodies of the enemy which\r\nwere dispersed among the fens. The Danes, finding their position\r\nuntenable, took to their ships again and crossed over to the Yorkshire\r\nbank, whither William had no means of following them. He therefore left\r\npart of his troops under the counts of Mortain and Eu, to protect\r\nLindsey, while he himself turned westwards to suppress a local rising\r\nwhich had broken out at Stafford.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing as to the persons who were responsible for this last\r\nrevolt, nor have we any clue as to their objects, but it is quite\r\npossible that they were acting in concert with the men who at this time\r\nwere laying siege to the new castle of Shrewsbury. William in this year\r\nwas contending with men of Celtic as well as of Scandinavian race; for\r\nBleddyn, king of Gwynedd, for the third time within three years, had\r\ntaken arms against the Normans on the Welsh border. To the men of North\r\nWales, Edric the Wild brought a contingent from Herefordshire, and the\r\ncitizens of Chester, which, it would seem, had not as yet been occupied\r\nby the Normans, joined in the attack. The allies were successful in\r\nburning the town of Shrewsbury and getting away before a Norman force\r\narrived in relief of the castle, but the Staffordshire insurgents were\r\nless fortunate. We are merely told that King William “wiped out great\r\nnumbers of the rebels with an easy victory at Stafford,” but the\r\nDomesday survey of the country, in the large proportion of land which it\r\nreturns as “waste,” suggests that Staffordshire at this time received at\r\nWilliam’s hand some measure of the doom which was to fall upon Yorkshire\r\nbefore the year had closed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the revolt of the south-west had run its course. Here as\r\nelsewhere the plans of the revolted English do not seem to have extended\r\nbeyond the capture of individual castles; notably the royal fortress\r\nwhich had been built in Exeter after the the siege of the previous year,\r\nand the private stronghold of Count Robert of Mortain at Montacute in\r\nSomerset. The command against the besiegers of Montacute was assumed by\r\nBishop Geoffrey of Coutances, who speedily scattered the insurgents with\r\nan army drawn from London, Winchester, and Salisbury, the chief towns on\r\nthe main road from the east to Devon and Somerset. The situation at\r\nExeter was complicated by the attitude of the citizens themselves, who\r\nmust have been anxious not to forfeit the privileges which they had\r\nobtained from King William by the treaty which had so recently concluded\r\ntheir own revolt. Accordingly, when the new castle was beset by a host\r\nof Devonians and Cornishmen, the townspeople took the Norman side; and\r\nthe garrison on making a sally threw the rebels into a state of\r\nconfusion which was completed by the arrival of Brian of Penthievre, who\r\nwas advancing to the relief of the castle men.\r\n\r\nNow that no further danger was to be apprehended, from the lands between\r\nTrent and Severn King William’s hands were free to deal with the\r\nNorthumbrian difficulty. His lieutenants in Lindsey had contrived to\r\nsurprise a number of the Danes as they were participating in the village\r\nfeasts with which the men of that district were anticipating the\r\ncustomary orgies of midwinter and to which they had apparently invited\r\ntheir Danish friends. This, however, was a trivial matter; there was a\r\nprobability that the Danes would return to take possession of York, and\r\nwhen the Conqueror next appears after the battle of Stafford, he is\r\nfound at Nottingham on his way to the northern capital. For fifty miles\r\nnorth of Nottingham he followed the route by which he had advanced on to\r\nYork in the previous year, but he received a sudden check at the point\r\nwhere the road in question crosses the Aire near to the modern town of\r\nPontefract. The bridge was broken, and the river, swollen most probably\r\nby the winter’s rains, could neither be forded nor crossed in boats,\r\nwhile the enemy lined the opposite bank in force. On this last account\r\nit was impossible to rebuild the bridge, and for three weeks the army\r\nwas kept inactive by this unexpected obstacle. At last a knight called\r\nLisois de Monasteriis, after examining the river in search of a ford for\r\nmiles above and below the camp by the broken bridge, discovered a\r\npracticable crossing somewhere among the hills to the west of Leeds, and\r\nforced a passage with sixty horsemen in despite of the efforts of the\r\nenemy on the left bank. Having demonstrated the possibility of a\r\ncrossing at this point Lisois returned to Pontefract; and under his\r\nguidance the whole army passed the Aire, and then wheeled round towards\r\nYork through the difficult country which borders the great plain of the\r\nOuse. As the army drew near to York, news came that the Danes had\r\nevacuated the city, so the king divided his force, sending one\r\ndetachment to occupy and repair the ruined castles, and another to the\r\nHumber to keep the Danes in check. But he himself had other work to do,\r\nand did not enter York at this time.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the Norman passage of the Aire, hazardous as it had\r\nbeen, had really demoralised the Northumbrian insurgents and their\r\nDanish allies. The latter, as we have seen, fell back on the Humber at\r\nonce without striking a blow; the mass of the native English under arms\r\nwould seem to have retired simultaneously among the hills of western\r\nYorkshire, for the Conqueror now turned to their pursuit and to the\r\ndefinite reduction of the inhospitable land. With grim determination he\r\nworked his way along the wooded valleys which intersect the great\r\nmountain chain of northern England, and deliberately harried that region\r\nso that no human being might find the means of subsistence there.\r\nResistance isolated and ineffectual he must have met; but now for once\r\nsubmission brought no favour, and those who perished in the nameless\r\nstruggles in which despairing men flung themselves hopelessly upon the\r\nline of his inexorable march, underwent a shorter agony than remained\r\nfor those who survived to see their homes, with all their substance,\r\nsmouldering in the track of the destroying army. But the spirit was soon\r\nbeaten out of the ruined men, and without fearing surprise or ambush\r\nWilliam could divide his army still further and quicken the dismal\r\nprocess of destruction. Soon his soldiers were scattered in camps over\r\nan area of a hundred miles, and the north and east of Yorkshire\r\nunderwent the fate which the Conqueror in person had inflicted on the\r\nWest Riding. Before Christmas it is probable that the whole land from\r\nthe North Sea to Morecambe Bay had become with the rarest exceptions a\r\ndeserted wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe harrying of Yorkshire is one of the few events of the kind in regard\r\nto which the customary rhetoric of the medieval chronicler is only\r\nsubstantiated by documentary evidence. From the narratives of Ordericus\r\nVitalis and Simeon of Durham alone, we should gain a fair impression of\r\nthe ghastly reality of the great devastation, but a few columns of the\r\nDomesday survey of Yorkshire, where the attempt is made to estimate the\r\nresult of the havoc for the purposes of the royal treasury, are\r\ninfinitely the more suggestive. On page after page, with deadly\r\niteration, manor after manor is reported “waste,” and even in the places\r\nwhere agricultural life had been re-instituted, and the burned villages\r\nrebuilt, the men who inhabited them formed but pitiful little groups in\r\nthe midst of the surrounding ruin. As to the fate of the individuals who\r\nhad fled before King William’s army, in the fatal December, no certain\r\ntale can be told. Many sold themselves into slavery in return for food,\r\nmany tried to make their way southward into the more prosperous midland\r\nshires; the local history of Evesham Abbey relates how crowds of\r\nfugitives from the districts visited by the Conqueror in this campaign\r\nthronged the streets of the little town, and how each day five of six of\r\nthem, worn out by hunger and weariness, died, and received burial by the\r\nprior of the monastery. Many no doubt tried to keep themselves alive in\r\nthe neighbourhood of their old homes until the rigour of the winter had\r\npassed away; but fifty years later it was well remembered in the north\r\nhow the bodies of those who were now overtaken by famine lay rotting by\r\nthe roadsides. Even so late as Stephen’s time, a southern writer,\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury, tells us how the fertile lands of the north still\r\nbore abundant traces of what had passed during the winter of 1069.\r\n\r\nThe festival of Christmas caused a short break in the grim progress of\r\nKing William. His work was not by any means completed in the north; the\r\nDanes were still in the Humber; Chester remained in virtual\r\nindependence. And so the regalia and royal plate were brought from the\r\ntreasury at Winchester, and the Christmas feast was held at York with so\r\nmuch of the traditional splendour as the place and occasion permitted.\r\nThe ceremony over, the campaign was resumed, and in the New Year the\r\nConqueror set out to hunt down a body of Englishmen who seem to have\r\nentrenched themselves among the marshes which then lay between the\r\nCleveland hills and the estuary of the Tees.[217] The rebels, however,\r\ndecamped by night on hearing of the king’s advance, and William spent\r\nfifteen days by the Tees, during which time Earl Waltheof made his\r\nsubmission in person and Gospatric sent envoys who swore fealty on his\r\nbehalf. Gospatric was therefore restored to his earldom, and William\r\nreturned to York, keeping to the difficult country of the East Riding in\r\npreference to the Roman road which led southward from the Tees near\r\nDarlington down the plain of the Ouse.[218] It is probable that William\r\nchose this route with the object of hunting down any scattered bands of\r\noutlawed Englishmen which might have hung together thus far in this\r\ninaccessible region; but his force suffered severely through the cold,\r\nmany of the horses died, and on one occasion he himself lost his way and\r\nbecame separated from his army with only six companions for an entire\r\nnight. York, however, was reached in safety at last, and the reduction\r\nof Northumbria was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt was now possible to enter upon the final stage of the campaign, and,\r\nafter making the arrangements necessary for the safety of York, William\r\nset out on the last and most formidable of the many marches of this\r\nmemorable winter, towards the one important town in England which had\r\nnever submitted to his rule. Chester still held out in English hands,\r\nand apart from its strategical importance the citizens of the great port\r\nhad definitely attracted King William’s attention by the part which they\r\nhad played in the recent siege of Shrewsbury. His hold on the north\r\nwould never be secure until he had reduced the town where Irish Vikings\r\nand Welsh mountaineers might at any time collect their forces for an\r\nattack upon the settled midlands. On the other hand, the geographical\r\ndifficulties in the way of a direct march from York to Chester were\r\nenormous. From the edge of the plain of York to the Mersey Valley, the\r\naltitude of the ground never descends to a point below 500 feet above\r\nsea level; and, since the Roman highway from York to Manchester had\r\nfallen into ruin, no roads crossed this wild country except such tracks\r\nas served for communication between village and village. But a more\r\nserious cause of danger lay in the fact that the army itself now began\r\nto show ominous symptoms which might easily develop into actual mutiny.\r\nThe strain of the protracted campaign was telling upon the men; and the\r\nmercenary portion of the army, represented by the soldiers from Anjou,\r\nBrittany, and Maine, began to clamour for their discharge, complaining\r\nthat these incessant marches were more intolerable than even the irksome\r\nduty of castle guard. The Conqueror in reply merely declared that he had\r\nno use for the cowards who wished to desert him,[219] and, trusting\r\nhimself to the loyalty of his own subjects in the army, he plunged\r\nstraightway into the hills which separate the modern counties of\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire. Part at least of the route now followed at the\r\nclose of January must have lain through districts which had been swept\r\nbare of all provisions in the great harrying of December; and the army\r\nwas at times reduced to feed on the horses which had perished in the\r\nswamps, that continually intercepted the line of advance. The storms of\r\nrain and hail which fell at this time were considered worthy of mention\r\nin the earliest account of the march which we possess, and we can see\r\nthat nothing but the example of King William’s own courage and endurance\r\nheld the army together and brought it down in safety into the Cheshire\r\nplain. Chester would appear to have surrendered without daring to stand\r\na siege, and with its submission, guaranteed as usual by the foundation\r\nof a castle,[220] the Conqueror’s work was done at last in the north.\r\nFrom Chester he moved to Stafford, where another castle was raised and\r\ngarrisoned, and then marched directly across England to Salisbury, at\r\nwhich place the army was disbanded, with the exception of the men who\r\nhad protested against the present expedition and were now kept under\r\narms for forty days longer as a mark of the king’s disfavour.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, by a skilful piece of diplomacy, William had been\r\ninsuring himself against active hostility on the part of the Danish\r\nfleet. Earl Asbiorn and his associates had taken but little gain as yet\r\nfrom their English adventure; and the earl proved very amenable when a\r\nsecret embassy came to him from the king, promising him a large sum of\r\nmoney and the right of provisioning his men at the expense of the\r\ndwellers along the coast for the remainder of the winter, on the sole\r\ncondition that he should keep the peace towards the royal troops\r\nthenceforward until his departure. The earl, thus made secure of some\r\npersonal profit, agreed to the terms, and until the spring was far\r\nadvanced, the Danish ships still hung in the English waters.\r\n\r\nThe harrying of Northumbria, the most salient event of these twelve\r\nmonths of ceaseless activity, was a measure which it would be impossible\r\nto justify and impertinent to excuse. It was the logical result of the\r\nopposition of an irreconcilable people to an inflexible conqueror. After\r\nthe battle of Hastings had shattered the specious unity of the old\r\nEnglish state, each of its component parts might still have secured\r\npeace by full submission, or honour by consistent and coherent\r\nresistance; the men of Northumbria took the one course which was certain\r\nto invite disaster, nor, terrible as was the resultant suffering, can we\r\nsay that vengeance was undeserved. War in the eleventh century was at\r\nbest a cruel business, but we cannot fairly accuse the Conqueror of\r\ndeliberately aggravating its horrors without the impulse of what he must\r\nhave regarded as necessity. He had to deal with a people whom he could\r\nnot trust, who had sworn submission and had broken their oaths, and the\r\nmeans at his disposal were few. He could not deport the population of\r\nNorthumbria as Cromwell was to deport the native Irish under not\r\ndissimilar circumstances; his Normans were too few as yet to garrison\r\neffectively all the wild land between the Humber and the Scottish\r\nborder. The one course which remained to the Conqueror was for him to\r\nplace the rebels beyond the possibility of revolting again, and he\r\nfollowed this course with terrible success. And it was on this\r\naccount—that Northumbria was wasted, not in the heat of wars, but\r\ndeliberately, at the bidding of political necessity—that the act seemed\r\nmost dreadful to the chroniclers who have described it. Men were only\r\ntoo well accustomed to the sight of ruined villages, of starving women\r\nand children; but these things seemed less terrible as the work of\r\nScotch and Danish freebooters than as the conscious intention of the\r\ncrowned king of the land. Nor must we forget that we do not know how far\r\nKing William was really sinning against the current military practice of\r\nhis time. The monastic chroniclers, whose opinion of the case commends\r\nitself to us in virtue of its humanity, were men brought by the fact of\r\ntheir vocation to a clearer sense of the value of the individual life\r\nthan that possessed by the lay world around them. We know what Ordericus\r\nVitalis thought of the great harrying, perhaps even what William of\r\nPoitiers, the Conqueror’s own chaplain, thought of it, but we do not\r\nknow how it appeared to William Fitz Osbern or Roger de Montgomery.\r\n\r\nAccording to his approved custom, the Conqueror kept the Easter\r\nfollowing these events at Westminster, and the feast was attended by\r\nthree papal legates of high rank whose presence marks the beginning of\r\nthe ecclesiastical reformation which we shall have to consider in its\r\nplace as the counterpart of the legal and administrative changes\r\nproduced by the Norman Conquest. In the meantime, however, the broken\r\nnational party was gathering its forces for a last stand, and the focal\r\npoint of the English resistance shifts to the extreme east of the land.\r\n\r\nAt each stage in the Norman Conquest there is always one particular\r\ndistrict round which the main interest centres for the time, the\r\noperations of war elsewhere being of subsidiary importance. It was the\r\nmen of Kent and Sussex who bore the brunt of the first shock of the\r\ninvasion; it was the men of the north who held the field in 1069, and\r\nnow, in the last period of English resistance, our attention is\r\nconcentrated on the rectangular tract of land which lies between\r\nWelland, Ermine Street, Ouse, and Wash. Even at the present day, after\r\neight centuries of drainage, it is not difficult to reconstruct the\r\ngeographical features which in 1070 made the Fenland the most\r\ninaccessible part of England south of the Humber. Except for a narrow\r\ntract north of Huntingdon and St. Ives, no part of this district rises\r\nto one hundred feet above sea-level, and in great part it was still\r\ncovered with the swamps and meres of stagnant water which gave to the\r\neastern half of this region the name of the Isle of Ely. In so far as\r\ncultivation had already extended into this inhospitable quarter, it may\r\nfairly be set down to the credit of the five great abbeys of\r\nPeterborough, Thorney, Crowland, Ramsey, and Ely, which dominated the\r\nfens and round which the events of the campaign of 1070 arrange\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAbbot Brand of Peterborough, whose recognition of Edgar the Etheling as\r\nking had so deeply moved the Conqueror’s wrath at the time of his\r\ncoronation, had died on November 27, 1069.[221] At this moment King\r\nWilliam was in the thick of his Northumbrian difficulties, and it does\r\nnot appear that any appointment to Peterborough was made until the\r\nquieter times of the following spring. In or before May, however, the\r\nabbey was given to a man whose selection for the post proves that the\r\nking had received warning of the coming disquiet in the east. Thorold of\r\nFécamp, abbot of Malmesbury, had probably made himself useful in north\r\nWiltshire while William was engaged beyond the Humber, for the\r\nreputation for militant severity which he had created in the south was\r\nthe reason for his translation to a post of danger in the Fenland. “By\r\nGod’s splendour,” said King William, “if he is more of a knight than an\r\nabbot I will find him a man who will meet all his attacks, where he can\r\nprove his valour and his knighthood and practise the art of war.”[222]\r\nThe man in question was no other than the famous Hereward, and Thorold\r\nwas not long before he saw traces of his handiwork.\r\n\r\nThe amount of authentic fact which we know about Hereward is in very\r\nsmall proportion to the great mass of legend which has gathered round\r\nhis name. His parentage is quite unknown, but there are several\r\nincidental entries in Domesday which connect him with the western edge\r\nof the Fenland and which all occur in the Lincolnshire portion of the\r\nsurvey. From these entries we learn that Hereward had been a tenant of\r\ntwo of the great Fenland abbeys, namely Crowland and Peterborough, and\r\nwe also gather that the former house had found him an unsatisfactory\r\nperson with whom to have dealings. The jurors of Aveland Wapentake in\r\nLincolnshire told the Domesday commissioners that Abbot Ulfketil of\r\nCrowland had let the abbey’s estate in the vill of Rippingale to\r\nHereward on terms to be arranged mutually year by year, but they add\r\nthat the abbot took possession of the land again before Hereward fled\r\nfrom the country because he did not keep to his agreement.[223] On the\r\nother hand, Hereward was seemingly still in the possession of the lands\r\nwhich he held of Peterborough abbey at the moment when his name first\r\nappears in the national history.\r\n\r\nAt some time in the course of May, but before Abbot Thorold had taken\r\npossession of his abbey, the Danish fleet, of which we have heard\r\nnothing since the previous year, sailed up the Ouse to Ely. Thus far its\r\nleaders would seem to have kept the agreement which they had made with\r\nKing William after his capture of York, and the fact that they now\r\nappear as taking the offensive once more is probably explained by a\r\nstatement in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ that King Swegn of Denmark had\r\ncome in person to the Humber.[224] The men of the Fenland were clearly\r\nexpecting a Danish reconquest of England, and on the appearance of Earl\r\nAsbiorn at Ely they joined him in great numbers. Among them, and\r\nprobably at their head, was Hereward, and the first fruit of the\r\nalliance was a successful raid on the wealthy and unprotected monastery\r\nof Peterborough. The monks received just sufficient warning of\r\napproaching danger to enable them to send an urgent message to Abbot\r\nThorold, asking for help, and also to hide some of the more precious\r\ntreasures of their house, and then at mid-day Hereward and his gang were\r\non them. They came by boat, for even at this date there were canals\r\nwhich connected the Ouse at Ely with the Nene at Peterborough, and began\r\nto clamour for admission to the abbey.[225] But the monks had closed\r\ntheir doors and defended them stoutly, so that Hereward was driven to\r\nburn the houses which clustered round the abbey gate in order to force\r\nan entrance. Incidentally the whole of Peterborough was burned down,\r\nwith the exception of the church and a single house, but the outlaws had\r\ngot inside the monastery. The monks begged them to do no harm, but,\r\nwithout heeding, they burst into the church, seized all the movable\r\narticles of value on which they could lay their hands, and tried to tear\r\ndown the great rood cross. To the clamours of the monks around them they\r\nshouted that they did it all for the good of the church, and as Hereward\r\nwas a tenant of the abbey the monks believed him. Indeed, Hereward\r\nhimself in after years declared that he had been guided in this matter\r\nby the best intentions, for he believed that the Danes would beat King\r\nWilliam and he thought that it would be better that the treasures of the\r\nchurch should remain in the hands of his friends for a little while,\r\nthan that they should fall for ever into the possession of the\r\nFrenchmen.\r\n\r\nSo the monks were scattered and the wealth of the Golden Borough was\r\ncarried off to Ely and handed over to the Danes, who do not seem to have\r\nshared Hereward’s sentiments with regard to its ultimate destination.\r\nAmong the captives who were carried off from Peterborough was Ethelwold,\r\nthe prior, who, in hope of better days, devoted himself secretly to the\r\nrecovery of the relics contained in the jewelled shrines which formed\r\nthe most valuable part of the plunder that had just been taken. With\r\nthis object in view, he deliberately set himself to win the favour of\r\nthe despoilers of his home, and succeeded so well, that the Danes\r\ncommitted their treasure to his custody, and promised him a bishopric in\r\nDenmark if he chose to return with them. Being a discreet man, he\r\npretended to comply with their wishes, and in the meantime possessed\r\nhimself of the tools which were necessary for the abstraction of the\r\nrelics. And on a certain day, while the Danes were holding a great\r\nfeast, to celebrate the winning of so great a treasure at so small a\r\ncost, Ethelwold took his tools and set to work, beginning his operations\r\non the reliquary which he knew to contain the arm of St. Oswald. To\r\nprevent interruption he placed two servants on guard, one in the house\r\nwhere the Danes were feasting, and the other midway between the latter\r\nplace and the scene of his own labours. The task progressed without\r\ngreater difficulty than was to be expected, although one of the chests\r\nwas so tightly clamped with iron that Ethelwold would have abandoned it\r\nhad he not trusted in God and St. Oswald. At last the relics were all\r\nsecured and hidden temporarily in the straw of the prior’s bed, he being\r\ncareful to replace the gold and silver fittings of the shrines as they\r\nwere before. But at the critical moment the Danes broke up to go to\r\nvespers and Ethelwold was in imminent danger of being taken, in which\r\nevent it is probable that his pious zeal would have been rewarded with\r\nthe crown of martyrdom. But, without leaving his room, the prior, who\r\nwas covered with sweat and very red from his labour in the heat of a\r\nJune afternoon, washed his face in cold water and went out to his\r\ncaptors as if nothing had happened, and they, who we are told reverenced\r\nhim as a father, flocked round him but asked no inconvenient questions.\r\nAnd on the following day he sent his two servants to Hereward—because\r\nhis comrades were infesting all the water-ways—under the pretence that\r\nthey wished to fetch something from Peterborough, but in reality they\r\nwent to the nearer monastery of Ramsey and gave the relics into the\r\ncharge of the abbot of that place.\r\n\r\nAt this point the adventures of Prior Ethelwold touch the current of the\r\ngeneral history. King William, in order, presumably, to divide the\r\ninsurgent Englishmen from their Danish allies, made a treaty with Swegn\r\nof Denmark, by which his subjects were to be allowed to sail for their\r\nfatherland without hindrance and in possession of all the spoil they had\r\ngained in the course of the past months. They took advantage of the\r\noffer, but gained little by it in the event, for a great storm arose\r\nwhich scattered their ships, and the last we hear of the treasures of\r\nPeterborough is their destruction, in a nameless Danish town, in a great\r\nfire which arose through the drunkenness of their guardians. In the\r\nmeantime, Ethelwold, his troubles over, collected his fellow-monks and\r\ncame back to Peterborough, where they found Abbot Thorold, and restored\r\nthe services which had been suspended during the recent disturbances.\r\nOne unexpected difficulty indeed manifested itself: the Ramsey people\r\nrefused to give up the relics which had been entrusted to their care in\r\nthe moment of peril. But the abbot of Ramsey was soon brought into a\r\nbetter mind; the sacristan of the monastery received a supernatural\r\nintimation that his house was acting unjustly, and Thorold of\r\nPeterborough threatened to burn Ramsey abbey to the ground unless the\r\nrelics were given back. And so the heroic efforts of Ethelwold were not\r\nfrustrated of their purpose.\r\n\r\nSo quickly had events moved that only one week had elapsed between the\r\ncoming of Hereward to Peterborough and the departure of the Danish\r\nfleet. But an entire year had yet to pass before the Isle of Ely was\r\nfinally cleared of its rebel garrison. It does not seem that the\r\nwithdrawal of the Danes made any difference to the occupation of Ely by\r\nthe English, and during the winter of 1070 the Isle became a gathering\r\npoint for the last adherents of the broken national party. Very few of\r\nthem were left now. Edgar, their nominal head, was living in peace with\r\nKing Malcolm of Scotland; Waltheof, the last representative of the\r\nDanish earls of Northumbria, was at this moment in enjoyment of an\r\nearldom in the midlands which there is every reason to believe included\r\nthe Isle of Ely itself. On the other hand, Edwin and Morcar now finally\r\ntook their departure from William’s court, and raised the last of their\r\nfutile protests against the Norman rule.\r\n\r\nHitherto inseparable, on this occasion the brother earls took different\r\ncourses, and the result was disastrous to both of them. Morcar joined\r\nthe outlaws in Ely; Edwin struck out for the Scotch kingdom, and from\r\nour meagre information about his last months it would seem that he had\r\nin view some great scheme of reviving once more the old friendship\r\nbetween his house and the Welsh princes and of supporting the\r\ncombination with Scotch aid. But fate overtook him before he had time to\r\ngive another exhibition of his political worthlessness, and the\r\ncircumstances of his end were tragic and mysterious. Three brothers, who\r\nwere on terms of intimacy with him and were attending him in his\r\nwanderings, betrayed him to the Normans, and in attempting to escape,\r\nhis retreat was blocked by a river swollen at the moment by a high tide.\r\nOn its bank the last earl of Mercia turned at bay, and with twenty\r\nhorsemen at his side made a desperate defence until the whole band was\r\ncut down; Edwin himself, it would appear, falling by the hands of the\r\nthree traitors of his household. His head was cut off and the same three\r\nbrothers brought it to King William in the expectancy of a great reward.\r\nBut the Conqueror on the spot outlawed them for their treason to their\r\nlord, and shed tears of grief over Edwin’s head; for the handsome,\r\nfickle young earl, with all his faults, had really won the love of the\r\ngrim sovereign from whom he had thrice revolted.[226]\r\n\r\nEdwin fell through treachery, but he met his death in the sight of the\r\nsun; another fate remained for his brother and for those of his\r\nassociates whose end is known to us. The cause of the defenders of Ely\r\nwas hopeless from the outset. Their revolt was a hindrance to the\r\norderly conduct of the Anglo-Norman government, but a band of outlaws in\r\nthe fenland could do little to affect the course of events elsewhere;\r\nEly commanded no great road or river, and its Isle was too small an area\r\nto support an independent existence apart from the rest of the land. Its\r\nreduction was only a question of time, complicated by the geographical\r\ndifficulties of the district. It was necessary that all the waterways\r\nleading from the fens to the open sea should be blocked, and this\r\nimplied the concentration of a considerable number of ships and\r\nmen-at-arms along the Great and Little Ouse. The siege of a quarter of\r\nCambridgeshire demanded a greater expenditure of men and money than that\r\nof a single town or castle; but Hereward and his friends in due time\r\nwere driven back on Ely itself, from which their raiding parties would\r\nmake occasional descents upon the neighbouring villages. The Conqueror\r\nfixed his headquarters at Cambridge, some fifteen miles from Ely, and\r\nhis main attack was directed at the point where the Ouse is crossed by\r\nan ancient causeway near the village of Aldreth. But even from the\r\nlatter place there remained some six miles of fen to be crossed before\r\nEly itself could be reached, and we are told on good authority that\r\nWilliam caused a bridge, two miles long, to be built on the western side\r\nof the Isle.[227]\r\n\r\nThe legendary accounts of the exploits of Hereward tell many tales of\r\nthe struggle which raged before the Norman army had pierced the natural\r\ndefences of Ely, but we cannot be sure of the exact means by which the\r\nplace was finally reduced. One stream of tradition assigned the fall of\r\nthe Isle to the treachery of the abbot and monks of Ely, and, although\r\nthe authority for such a statement is not first-rate, it has commonly\r\nbeen accepted as representing the truth of the matter.[228] It is at\r\nleast certain that the position in which the monks of Ely found\r\nthemselves was undesirable at the best. The conduct of Hereward and his\r\nmen at Peterborough proves them to have been no respecters of holy\r\nplaces, and if the abbey bought immediate safety by conniving at the\r\ndeeds of the outlaws in its neighbourhood, it ran the risk of the\r\nultimate confiscation of its lands when King William had restored order.\r\nSmall blame should rest upon the abbot if he broke through the dilemma\r\nin which he was placed by assisting the Conqueror in the reduction of\r\nthe Isle. But whatever the immediate cause of the fall of Ely, a large\r\nnumber of its defenders fell into William’s hands and many of them\r\nreceived from him such measure as twenty years before he had dealt to\r\nthe men of Alençon. Some were blinded or otherwise mutilated and allowed\r\nto go free, others were thrown into prison. Earl Morcar himself was sent\r\ninto Normandy a prisoner and committed to the charge of Roger de\r\nBeaumont[229]; the other captives of note were scattered over the\r\ncountry in different fortresses. But Hereward, who in all our\r\nauthorities stands out as the leader of the resistance, escaped through\r\nthe marshes and a small part of his band got clear of the Isle in his\r\ncompany.[230]\r\n\r\nWhatever the recent behaviour of the monks of Ely may have been, the\r\nabbey was constrained to buy the king’s peace at a heavy price. Seven\r\nhundred marks of silver were originally demanded by the Conqueror, but\r\nthe money was found to be of light weight, and three hundred marks more\r\nwere exacted before the abbot and monks were reckoned quit by the king’s\r\nofficer. Moreover, the very precincts of the abbey were invaded to find\r\nthe site for a castle to command the southern fenland: King William\r\nhimself having chosen the ground during a flying visit which he had paid\r\nto Ely one day while the monks were seated at dinner. The building of\r\nthe castle, by a Norman interpretation of the Anglo-Saxon duty of\r\n_burhbot_, was laid upon the men of the three adjacent counties of\r\nCambridge, Huntingdon, and Bedford, and it was garrisoned when built by\r\na body of picked knights. Another castle at Aldreth commanded the\r\neastern approaches to the Isle.[231] On the other hand, it would be some\r\ncompensation for these disturbances that within four years from the fall\r\nof Ely, and in the lifetime of Abbot Thurstan, King William decreed a\r\nformal restitution to the abbey of all the lands of which it had\r\nunjustly been despoiled in recent years.[232] Now that no further danger\r\nwas to be apprehended from the nationalist proclivities of the monks of\r\nEly, there was no reason why the abbey should not be suffered to enjoy\r\nits ancient possessions in peace; but the record of the plea which\r\nfollowed the Conqueror’s writ directing restitution proves that many of\r\nthe greater people of the land, including the archbishop Stigand and\r\nCount Eustace of Boulogne, had been committing wholesale depredations on\r\nthe estates of St. Ethelthryth.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent fate of Hereward is a matter of utter uncertainty; with\r\nhis flight across the marshes of Ely he vanishes into the night which\r\nhas engulfed the entire class to which he belonged, the smaller native\r\nland-owners of King Edward’s day. Two lines of tradition were current in\r\nlater years about the manner of his end. According to the more dramatic\r\nnarrative, Hereward became reconciled to the Conqueror, accompanied him\r\nin the Mancel campaign of 1074, married a noble and wealthy\r\nEnglishwoman, and fell at last, before overwhelming odds, at the hands\r\nof a number of Normans, whose feud he would seem to have provoked in the\r\nwild days of his outlawry.[233] In the other story, Hereward still\r\nreceives King William’s favour and marries the same English lady as in\r\nthe former legend, but he dies at last in peace after many years in the\r\nquiet possession of his father’s lands.[234] The choice which we may\r\nmake between these divergent traditions will largely be guided by\r\ninference from more truly historical sources of information. It is very\r\nprobable that Hereward made his peace with King William—both traditions\r\nagree upon this point; and that casual expression in the narrative of\r\nthe sack of Peterborough, that Hereward “in after time often told the\r\nmonks that he had done all for the best,” proves at least that there had\r\nbeen a period after the troubles of 1071 in which Hereward had been on\r\nterms of peaceful intercourse with his monkish neighbours. So too the\r\ncoincidence of both lines of tradition with regard to his marriage is in\r\nfavour of its probability, but the negative evidence of Domesday Book\r\ncompels us to put a period to his life before the winter of 1085. In no\r\npart of England did a more numerous body of native thegns hold land at\r\nthe latter date than in Hereward’s own county of Lincoln, but Hereward’s\r\nname is not written among them, and the lands which he had held of\r\nPeterborough abbey had been let to a stranger. But if the Hereward\r\nlegend is not consistent with itself, there is a more significant\r\ndiscrepancy between the part which its subject plays in recorded history\r\nand his position as a hero of romance. It is at least certain that the\r\nman must have been something more than the vulgar freebooter who appears\r\nin the story of the ruin of Peterborough. To him we may safely credit\r\nthe long defence of the Isle of Ely, and we may feel confident that that\r\ndefence was accompanied by deeds of gallantry round which minstrel and\r\ngleeman might weave their fabric of legend and marvel. Hereward, after\r\nall, in literature, if not in fact, is the English hero of the Norman\r\nConquest. A native annalist might express his bitter regret for the\r\ntragedy of King Harold, the common folk of England might turn Earl\r\nWaltheof into an uncanonised saint, but Hereward was removed by no great\r\nchasm of rank from the humble people who made his deeds their story. And\r\nit is not a small thing that the tale of the resistance to the Norman\r\nConqueror, inglorious as much of it had been, should end with the name\r\nof a man in whom the succeeding generations might see a true champion of\r\nthe independence of the beaten race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of Swegn Estuthson]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Round, _Calendar of Documents preserved in France_, No. 1713.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  William of Poitiers, 122.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  W.

These\r\n  indications imply that Norwich (_Venta Icenorum_) was Fitz Osbern’s\r\n  headquarters, although the name Guenta alone would naturally refer to\r\n  Winchester (_Venta Belgarum_). The joint regency of Odo and William is\r\n  asserted by Florence of Worcester, 1067, and the phrase in William of\r\n  Poitiers, that Fitz Osbern “toto regno Aquilionem versus præesset,”\r\n  suggests that the Thames was the boundary between his province and\r\n  that of Odo. The priority of Fitz Osbern in the regency is suggested\r\n  by the fact that in a writ relating to land in Somerset, he joins his\r\n  name with that of the king in addressing the magnates of the shire.\r\n  Somersetshire certainly formed no part of his direct sphere of\r\n  administration at the time.

They had given no known cause\r\n  of offence since their original submission, but it is probable that\r\n  they would have been kept in close restraint if they had been in the\r\n  king’s power when the northern revolt broke out and that they fled to\r\n  avoid this.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  Ordericus Vitalis, ii., 184.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  Ordericus Vitalis, ii., 185.\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  Simeon of Durham, 1069.\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  Ordericus Vitalis, ii., 188.

On the other hand he is\r\n  doubtless in great part following the contemporary William of\r\n  Poitiers, and his tale is quite consistent with itself if due\r\n  allowance is made for its geographical confusion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  The exact scene of Waltheof’s exploit is uncertain. Orderic implies\r\n  that the entire Norman garrison in York perished in the unsuccessful\r\n  sally. Florence of Worcester states that the castles were taken by\r\n  storm. The latter is certainly the more probable, and agrees better\r\n  with the tradition, preserved by William of Malmesbury, of the\r\n  slaughter at the gate. The gate in question, on this reading of the\r\n  story, will belong to one of the castles; it cannot well be taken to\r\n  be one of the gates of the town.\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  The mutilation is only recorded by a late authority, the Winchester\r\n  _Annals_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  Ordericus’ narrative at this point is not very clear, but this is\r\n  probably his meaning.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  By Ordericus William is made to return to York through Hexham\r\n  (“Hangustaldam revertabatur a Tesca”). This being impossible it is\r\n  generally assumed that Helmsley (Hamilac in D. B.) should be read for\r\n  Hexham, in which case William would probably cross the Cleveland hills\r\n  by way of Bilsdale.\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  “Desertores, vero, velut inertes, pavidosque et invalidos, si\r\n  discedant, parvi pendit.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  Chester castle was planted within arrow shot of the landing stage on\r\n  the right bank of the Dee, and also commanded the bridge which carried\r\n  the road from the Cheshire plain to the North Wales coast.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  _Peterborough Chronicle_, 1069.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  William of Malmesbury, _Gesta Pontificum_, § 420.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  Domesday Book, i., 346.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  _Peterborough Chronicle_, 1070.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  The passages which follow are founded on the narrative of Hugh\r\n  “Candidus,” a monk of Peterborough, who in the reign of Henry II.\r\n  wrote an account of the possessions of the abbey, and inserts a long\r\n  passage descriptive of the events of 1070. The beginning of his\r\n  narrative agrees closely with the contemporary account in the\r\n  _Peterborough Chronicle_, but his tale of the doings of the Danes in\r\n  Ely after the sack of Peterborough is independent, and bears every\r\n  mark of truth.

The process which had turned the duke of the Normans into the\r\nking of the English had meant the withdrawal of Normandy from the feudal\r\npolitics of France for four years, and in that interval certain changes\r\nof considerable importance had taken place within the limits of the\r\nFrench kingdom. The Angevin succession war was now over; Fulk le Rechin\r\nhad his brother safely bestowed in prison and could begin to prove\r\nhimself the true heir of Geoffrey Martel by renewing the latter’s\r\nschemes of territorial aggrandisement. King Philip of France had reached\r\nan age at which he was competent to rule in person, and it was\r\ninevitable that the enmity between Normandy and France should become\r\ndeeper and more persistent now that William had attained to a rank which\r\nplaced him on an equality with his suzerain, and could employ the\r\nresources of his new kingdom for the furtherance of any designs which he\r\nmight form upon the integrity of the royal demesne. More important than\r\nall, Count Baldwin of Flanders had died in 1067, and events were in\r\nprogress which for twenty years placed the wealthy county in steady\r\nopposition to the interests of the Anglo-Norman state.\r\n\r\nBetween 1067 and 1070 Flanders was under the rule of Count Baldwin VI.,\r\nthe eldest son of Baldwin of Lille, who had greatly increased his\r\nborders by a marriage with Richildis, the heiress of the neighbouring\r\nimperial fief of Hainault. The counts of Flanders made it a matter of\r\npolicy to transmit their inheritance undivided to the chosen heir, and\r\nRobert, the younger son of the old Count Baldwin, before his father’s\r\ndeath had secured himself against his ultimate disinherison by marrying\r\nGertrude, widow of Florent I., count of Holland, and assuming the\r\nguardianship of her son Theodoric. On the death of Baldwin VI., the\r\nancestral domain of Flanders descended to his eldest son, Arnulf, who\r\nwas placed under the wardship of his uncle Robert, while Hainault passed\r\nto Baldwin, the second son, under the regency of his mother Richildis.\r\nThe two regents were on bad terms from the start, but Robert at the time\r\nwas hard pressed to maintain his position in Holland, and Richildis soon\r\ngot possession of Arnulf, the heir of Flanders, and ruled there in his\r\nname. But her overbearing conduct rapidly made her unpopular in the\r\ncounty, and Robert was soon invited to invade Flanders and reign there\r\nin his own right. He accepted the invitation, and Richildis thereupon\r\nhired King Philip of France to support her with an army, and offered her\r\nhand and her dominions to William Fitz Osbern, Earl of Hereford. The\r\nearl, like a good knight-errant, accepted the adventure and hastened to\r\nthe succour of the lady with the full assent of his lord King William,\r\nbut fell into an ambush laid by his enemy Robert, at Bavinkhove, near\r\nCassel, and perished there together with Arnulf his ward. Richildis\r\nmaintained the struggle for a short time longer with the aid of troops\r\nsupplied by the prince-bishop of Liège; but on their defeat near Mons,\r\nfollowed a little later by the surrender of Terouenne, the\r\necclesiastical capital of Flanders, she retired into the monastery of\r\nMaxines, and Robert, who is generally described in history as the\r\n“Frisian” from the name of his earlier principality on the shores of the\r\nZuyder Zee, had the permanent possession of Flanders thenceforward.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of William Fitz Osbern meant the dissolution of the\r\nalliance between Normandy and Flanders, which had been founded by the\r\nConqueror’s marriage in 1053. It was true that French as well as Norman\r\ntroops had been involved in the disaster at Bavinkhove, but William\r\ndeliberately refused to make peace with Robert by recognising his right\r\nto Flanders, and threw him into the arms of the king of France by\r\nmaintaining the claims of Baldwin, the brother of the dead Arnulf. The\r\nclose friendship which this policy produced between France and Flanders\r\nfor a time may suggest that William for once subordinated questions of\r\nstate to personal feeling, but his own relations with a former king of\r\nFrance may have taught him that the alliances which a French monarch\r\nfounded with one feudatory on a common hostility towards another were\r\nnot likely to be very strong or permanent. It was not long after these\r\nevents that King Philip threw away his Flemish connections by the\r\nunprovoked capture of Corbie, preferring, perhaps wisely, a definite\r\nterritorial gain to a hazardous diplomatic understanding; and when\r\nRobert the Frisian, in 1085, at last tried to take the offensive against\r\nWilliam, he found support, not in the French monarchy, but in the\r\ndistant powers of Norway and Denmark.[235]\r\n\r\nMore dangerous than the open hostility of Flanders were the symptoms of\r\ndisaffection which at this time were beginning to show themselves in the\r\nNorman dependency of Maine. Fortunately for William, the county had kept\r\nquiet during his occupation with the affairs of England, and the revolt\r\nwhich we have now to consider occurred at a time when he could give his\r\nfull attention to the work of its reduction. The nationalist party in\r\nMaine had only been suppressed, not crushed, by the conquest of 1063,\r\nand after some five years of Norman rule their hopes began to revive,\r\nfomented probably by external suggestion on the part of Count Fulk of\r\nAnjou. There were in the field two possible claimants, both connected by\r\nmarriage with the line of native counts: Azo, marquis of Liguria,\r\nhusband of Gersendis, the eldest sister of the Herbert whose death in\r\n1063 had led to the Norman occupation, and John de la Flèche, who had\r\nmarried Paula, the youngest of Herbert’s three sisters. The seigneur of\r\nLa Flèche was an Angevin lord, but he took the Norman side in the war\r\nwhich followed, and the nationalists made their application to the\r\nmarquis of Liguria, who appeared in Maine with Gersendis his wife and\r\nHugh their son, the latter being received as the heir of the\r\ncounty.[236] Azo had brought with him great store of treasure from his\r\nItalian lordship, with which he secured a recognition of his son’s\r\nclaims from great part of the Mancel baronage, but upon the failure of\r\nhis supplies his supporters began to fall away, and he soon retired in\r\ndisgust beyond the Alps, leaving behind his wife and son to maintain the\r\nfamily cause under the guardianship of Geoffrey of Mayenne.\r\n\r\nThus far the Mancel revolt had run the normal course of its kind, but a\r\nmore interesting development followed.[237] Shortly after the departure\r\nof Azo the citizens of Le Mans, rejecting the leadership of their\r\nbaronial confederates, broke away on a line of their own which gives\r\nthem the distinction of anticipating by some twenty years the movement\r\nof municipal independence which in the next generation was to\r\nrevolutionise the status of the great cities of Flanders and northern\r\nFrance. The men of Le Mans formed themselves into a “commune”[238]; that\r\nis, a civic republic administered by elective officers and occupying a\r\nrecognised legal position in the feudal hierarchy to which it belonged.\r\nHad this association persisted, the citizens in their collective\r\ncapacity might have held their city of the duke of Normandy or the count\r\nof Anjou, but they would have enjoyed complete independence in their\r\nlocal government and no principle of feudal law would have prevented\r\nthem from appearing, still collectively, as the lord of vassals of their\r\nown. We do not know whether they may have been prompted to take this\r\nstep by news of Italian precedents in the same direction, but the\r\nformation of a commune raised the revolt at a bound to the dignity of a\r\nrevolution. The citizens, as was usual in such cases, united themselves\r\nin an oath to maintain their constitution and they compelled Geoffrey of\r\nMayenne and the other barons of the neighbourhood to associate\r\nthemselves in the same. Herein lay the seeds of future trouble, for\r\nGeoffrey of Mayenne, a typical feudal noble, had no liking for municipal\r\nautonomy, and it was largely his oppression as the representative of Azo\r\nand his heir which had stung the citizens into this assertion of their\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nAt the outset all went well with the young republic. We hear rumours of\r\nvarious violations of accepted custom, of the death penalty inflicted\r\nfor small offences, and of a certain disregard for the holy seasons of\r\nthe church; but the citizens were able to enter without immediate mishap\r\nupon the work of reducing the castles which commanded the country\r\naround. The commune of Le Mans did not live long enough to face the\r\nproblem of welding a powerful rural feudality into a coherent city\r\nstate, and its overthrow, when it came, came suddenly and disgracefully.\r\nSome twenty miles from Le Mans, the castle of Sillé was being held by\r\nHugh its lord against the commune, and the men of the capital called out\r\na general levy of their supporters within the county to undertake the\r\nsiege of the fortress. A considerable body of men obeyed the summons,\r\nand the communal army set out for Sillé with Arnold, bishop of Le Mans,\r\nmarching at its head. Hard by the castle the army from Le Mans was\r\njoined by Geoffrey of Mayenne with his tenants; but Geoffrey felt the\r\nincongruity of joining with a host of rebellious burghers in an attack\r\non the castle of a fellow-noble, and he secretly entered into\r\ncommunications with Hugh of Sillé. Whether the rout of the civic host\r\nwhich occurred on the following day was the result of Geoffrey’s treason\r\ncannot now be decided, but a sudden sally on the part of the garrison\r\nthrew the besiegers into confusion, and, although they recovered\r\nthemselves sufficiently to maintain the fight, they were finally\r\nscattered by a report that Le Mans itself had fallen into the enemy’s\r\nhand. Great numbers of them perished in the panic which followed, more\r\nby the precipitancy of their flight than by the efforts of the men of\r\nSillé, and Bishop Arnold was among the prisoners.\r\n\r\nWithin the capital all was confusion. The cause of the commune had been\r\nhopelessly discredited, and there was treachery within the city as well\r\nas in the camp by Sillé. The castle of Le Mans was occupied in the\r\nnationalist interest by Gersendis of Liguria, who, immediately upon the\r\nretreat of her elderly husband to Italy, had become the mistress of\r\nGeoffrey of Mayenne. But Geoffrey, after his conduct at Sillé, did not\r\nventure to return to the capital, and Gersendis, unable to endure her\r\nlover’s absence, began to plot the surrender of the castle to him. Her\r\nobject was soon gained, and a fierce struggle raged for many days\r\nbetween the citizens and Geoffrey of Mayenne, now in the possession of\r\ntheir fortress. Betrayed and desperate, the men of Le Mans appealed for\r\nhelp to Fulk of Anjou, and pressed on the siege with such fury that\r\nGeoffrey was driven to make his escape by night. On Fulk’s arrival the\r\ncastle surrendered to him, and was dismantled, with the exception of\r\nsuch of its fortifications as could be turned to the general defence of\r\nthe city against the greater enemy who was already on the way.\r\n\r\nQuickly as events seem to have moved, there had yet been time for news\r\nof the revolt to be brought to King William in England, and the\r\nmessenger of evil had been no less a person than Arnold bishop of Le\r\nMans himself. Long before William’s army had been set in motion Arnold\r\nhad returned to Le Mans to play, as we have seen, a somewhat ignominious\r\npart in the catastrophe at Sillé. Meanwhile William had gathered a\r\nforce, which is especially interesting from the fact that in it for the\r\nfirst time Englishmen were combined with Normans in the service of the\r\nlord of both races beyond the sea. Englishmen in the next generation\r\nbelieved that it was their compatriots who did the best service in this\r\ncampaign, and William of Malmesbury thought that though the English had\r\nbeen conquered with ease in their own land yet that they always appeared\r\ninvincible in foreign parts.[239] On the present occasion, however,\r\nthere was little call for feats of arms. William entered Maine by the\r\nSarthe Valley and besieged Fresnay, whose lord, Hubert, was soon driven\r\nby the harrying of his lands to surrender Fresnay itself and the lesser\r\ncastle of Beaumont lower down the river. Sillé was the next point of\r\nattack, but Hugh of Sillé made his submission before the investment of\r\nhis castle had begun, and William moved on southward towards Le Mans.\r\nAfter the strife and confusion of the past months men were everywhere\r\ndisposed to welcome the King as the restorer of peace, castles were\r\nreadily surrendered to him, and the way lay open to the distracted\r\ncapital. Here too, after a brief delay, he was received without\r\nopposition, but the men of Le Mans, before they surrendered the keys of\r\nthe city, obtained from the king a sworn promise that he would pardon\r\nthem for their revolt, and would respect their ancient customs and the\r\nindependence of their local rights of jurisdiction.[240] The commune of\r\nLe Mans ceased to exist, but in its last moments it had shown itself\r\nstrong enough to win an act of indemnity from its formidable conqueror,\r\nand to guard itself against the possible consequences of a feudal\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nThe war now entered upon another phase. Count Fulk was little minded to\r\nforego the position he had won in Le Mans as the protector of its\r\ncommune, and, but for the unwonted strength of the Anglo-Norman army, it\r\nis likely enough that he would have made some effort to oppose William’s\r\nmarch to the city. As it was, however, he contented himself with turning\r\nupon John de la Flèche, William’s leading Angevin adherent, who\r\nimmediately appealed to his ally for help. William at once despatched a\r\nforce to his assistance under William de Moulins and Robert de Vieux\r\nPont, a move which had the effect of widening the area of hostilities\r\nstill further. Fulk proceeded to the siege of La Flèche, and called to\r\nhis assistance Count Hoel of Brittany.[241] The combined Breton and\r\nAngevin host would be far superior to any force which William’s\r\nlieutenants had in the field in that quarter; and at the head of a large\r\narmy, now as formerly composed of English as well as Norman troops, he\r\nhastened to La Flèche in person and everything betokened a pitched\r\nbattle of the first class. But, at the supreme moment, an unnamed\r\ncardinal of the Roman Church, together with some pious monks, intervened\r\nin favour of peace, and within the circle of the Norman leaders Counts\r\nWilliam of Evreux and Roger of Montgomery were of the same mind. Various\r\nconferences were held to discuss the conditions of a possible\r\nsettlement, and at last, at Blanchelande, just outside the walls of La\r\nFlèche, a treaty was concluded.[242] Now, as ten years earlier, Robert\r\nof Normandy was selected as count of Maine, and to him Fulk of Anjou\r\nreleased the direct suzerainty which he claimed over the barons of the\r\ncounty, together with all the fiefs which were Robert’s marriage portion\r\nwith Margaret, his affianced bride in 1061. Robert, in return,\r\nrecognised Fulk as the overlord of Maine, and did homage to him in that\r\ncapacity. William promised indemnity to those Mancel barons who had\r\ntaken the Angevin side in the late war, and Fulk was formally reconciled\r\nto John de la Flèche, and the other Angevin nobles who had leagued\r\nthemselves with the king of England.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was in effect a compromise. All the immediate advantage, it\r\nis true, lay on the Norman side: the heir of Normandy was now the lawful\r\ncount of Maine, and Robert’s countship meant the effective rule of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, who even appropriated his son’s title and in\r\nsolemn documents would at times add to his Norman and English dignities\r\nthe style of “Prince of the men of Maine.” Yet, on the other hand, the\r\nformal recognition of the Angevin overlordship was no small thing. It\r\ngave to succeeding counts of Anjou a vantage ground which they did not\r\nneglect. The line which separated suzerainty from immediate rule, clear\r\nenough in law, would rapidly become indistinct when a strong prince like\r\nFulk the Rechin was the overlord, and a feckless creature like Robert\r\nCurthose the tenant in possession. More than sixty years were to pass\r\nbefore a count of Anjou became the immediate lord of Maine, but the\r\nseeds of such a development were laid by the treaty of Blanchelande.\r\n\r\nIn the period which follows the suppression of the fenland rising of\r\n1070, the bulk of our historical information relates to the affairs of\r\nthe Conqueror’s continental dominions. But in English history proper the\r\ntime was one of crucial importance. Its character was not such as to\r\ninvite the attention of a medieval chronicler, eager to fill his pages\r\nwith a succession of battlepieces: with the exception of the revolt of\r\nthe earls in 1075, England was outwardly at peace from the flight of\r\nHereward to the Conqueror’s death; but it is to this time that we must\r\nassign the systematic introduction of Norman methods of government, and\r\nthe gradual reconciliation of the English people to the fact that they\r\nhad thrown their last try for independence, and that for good or ill\r\nthey must make the best of the permanent rule of their alien masters. A\r\nprocess of this kind, in itself largely subconscious, lay beyond the\r\nunderstanding of the best monastic annalist or chronicler, and we shall\r\nnever know exactly in what light the great change presented itself to\r\nthe peasantry of a single English village; but there are certain\r\nmatters, more on the surface of the history, with regard to which we\r\npossess definite information, and which themselves are of some\r\nconsiderable importance.\r\n\r\nProminent among these last stands the question of the relations between\r\nthe Conqueror and his unquiet neighbour, or, as William would probably\r\nhave described him, his unruly vassal, Malcolm Canmore, king of Scots.\r\nThe Scotch question had merely been shelved for a little time by the\r\nsubmission of 1068, and up to the Conqueror’s death there remained\r\nseveral matters in dispute between the kings, each of which might serve\r\nas a decent pretext for war if such were needed. In particular the\r\nEnglish frontier on the north-west emphatically called for rectification\r\nfrom King William’s standpoint. Ever since the commendation of Cumbria\r\nto Malcolm I., in or about 954, the south-western border of Scotland had\r\ncut the English frontier at a re-entrant angle at a particularly\r\ndangerous point. From the hills which rise to 2000 feet along the\r\nboundary between Cumberland and Durham, the valley of the Tees affords a\r\ngradual descent to the fertile country which lies between the moors of\r\nthe North Riding of Yorkshire and the hills of Cleveland. So long as\r\nLothian remained part of the Bernician earldom, the strategical\r\nsignificance of Teesdale was to a great extent masked; no king of Scots\r\ncould ravage the plain of north Yorkshire without facing the possibility\r\nthat his country might be harried and his own retreat cut off by a\r\ncounter raid from Bamburgh or Dunbar. But the cession of Lothian to\r\nMalcolm II. after the battle of Carham in 1018 materially altered the\r\nmilitary situation, and but for the dissensions within the Scotch\r\nkingdom which followed Malcolm’s death, it is probable that Yorkshire\r\nduring the Confessor’s reign would have received sharp proof of the\r\ndanger which impended from the north-west.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was succeeded by Duncan, the son of his sister by Crinan, lay\r\nabbot of Dunkeld; and on Duncan’s displacement by Macbeth, leader of the\r\nPicts beyond the Forth, the position of the new king was too unstable to\r\nallow him to interfere effectively on the side of Northumbria. Relying\r\nas he did on Highland support, Macbeth seems to have left Cumberland in\r\nvirtual independence, and it has recently been proved that during some\r\npart of the first fifteen years of his reign Cumberland was largely\r\nsettled by English thegns who seem to have regarded themselves as\r\nsubject to Earl Siward of Northumbria.[243] On his part, Siward\r\nsupported the party of Malcolm, Duncan’s son; but when, three years\r\nafter Siward’s death, Malcolm had become king of Scots, the tide began\r\nto turn, and Cumberland became once more a menace to the peace of\r\nnorthern England.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the son of Duncan to the throne of Scotland brought\r\ninto importance the marriage relationship which existed between his line\r\nand the family which for a century had held hereditary possession of the\r\nBernician earldom. The complicated relationships which united the local\r\nearls of Bernicia will best be illustrated in tabular form,[244] but the\r\noutline of the Northumbrian succession is fairly clear. Siward, although\r\na Dane by birth, was connected by marriage with the great Bernician\r\nhouse, but on his death in 1055 the ancient family was dispossessed of\r\nthe earldom in favour first of Tostig and then of Morcar. Their\r\nearldoms, however, were mere incidents in the general rivalry between\r\nthe houses of Godwine and Leofric, and the attachment of the\r\nNorthumbrians to their local dynasty is shown by the fact that, at the\r\ncrisis of 1065, Morcar is found appointing Oswulf, son of Earl Eadwulf\r\nII., subordinate earl of Bernicia beyond the Tyne. Upon Oswulf’s murder\r\nhis cousin Gospatric, as we have seen, bought a recognition of the\r\nfamily claims from the Conqueror; and it is not improbable that the\r\nlatter, when making Gospatric his lieutenant in Northumbria, may have\r\nhad in mind some idea of securing peace from the side of Scotland and\r\nconciliating the local sentiment of the north through an earl who\r\ninherited the blood of the ancient lords of Bamburgh and was near of kin\r\nto the king of Scots. The plan in the first instance failed through the\r\ndefection of Gospatric in the summer of 1068, but the rapidity with\r\nwhich his restoration followed the submission which he tendered by proxy\r\nto William on the bank of the Tees at the close of 1069 is itself\r\nsignificant. In the interval created by Gospatric’s deposition there had\r\noccurred the disastrous experiment of the appointment of Robert de\r\nComines. It was as important now as two years previously to prevent the\r\nmen of Northumberland and Durham from making common cause with Malcolm\r\nof Scotland against the Norman government; and now as formerly Gospatric\r\nwas the one man who could, if he chose, perform this work. But before\r\nanother year had passed the precarious tranquillity of the north was\r\nagain broken, and the Scotch danger reasserted itself in the acutest of\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nWe might gather from the table above referred to, alone, that Malcolm,\r\nby his English connections, would be the natural protector of any\r\ndispossessed natives who might choose to seek refuge at his court, and\r\nwe have seen that Edgar the Etheling had twice been driven to escape\r\nbeyond the Tweed. We possess no information as to the motives which\r\ninduced Malcolm in the course of 1070 to break peace with King William.\r\nIn his barbarian mind Malcolm may have conceived of himself as avenging\r\nthe wrongs of his English friends by harrying the land from which they\r\nhad been driven, or, more probably, the withdrawal of the Conqueror from\r\nthe north may have seemed to him to open a safe opportunity for an\r\nextended plunder raid. Possibly he regarded his cousin Gospatric as\r\nhaving betrayed the cause of his people by doing homage to the Norman\r\nConqueror, but whatever the immediate cause, he suddenly fell upon\r\nNorthumbria by way of Cumberland and Teesdale, harried Cleveland and\r\nHolderness, and then turned back again upon the modern shire of\r\nDurham.[245] And it was while he was in the act of burning the town of\r\nWearmouth that Edgar the Etheling, with his mother and sisters,\r\naccompanied by Marleswegn, Harold’s former lieutenant in the north, and\r\nother battered relics of the national party, landed from their ships in\r\nthe harbour.[246] So long as the Danes under Earl Asbiorn had kept to\r\nthe Humber, it would seem that the etheling had been content to drift\r\nabout aimlessly with them, but their departure for Ely had driven him to\r\nseek refuge for a third time within two years at the Scottish court.\r\nMalcolm went down to the fugitives and assured them of a welcome in\r\nScotland, whither they sailed off without delay, while he betook himself\r\nwith renewed energy to his work of devastation.\r\n\r\nFor in the meantime Gospatric had been doing what he would consider to\r\nbe his duty as the lawful earl of Bernicia: while Malcolm was harrying\r\nDurham, Gospatric was harrying Cumberland. The action taken by King\r\nMalcolm had for the time being destroyed all possibility of a coalition\r\nbetween Scot and Bernician, and, on the present occasion, Gospatric’s\r\nfidelity was unimpeachable, if his generalship was bad. He was\r\nsuccessful in carrying off much booty to his fortress of Bamburgh, but\r\nhe did nothing to check the Scot king’s depredations, and the news of\r\nwhat had been happening in Cumberland excited Malcolm to a state of\r\nfury, in which he committed the most appalling atrocities on the country\r\nfolk of the region through which his northward march lay. Red-handed as\r\nhe was, Malcolm on his return to Scotland found the English exiles in\r\nthe enjoyment of his peace, and forthwith insisted that Margaret, the\r\netheling’s sister, should be given to him in marriage. Some project of\r\nthe kind had undoubtedly been mooted during the etheling’s earlier\r\nvisits to Scotland, but Margaret felt a desire to enter the religious\r\nlife; and nothing but the fact that the very existence of the fugitives\r\nlay at Malcolm’s mercy induced the etheling to give his consent to the\r\nunion. The exact date of the ceremony is uncertain, but it may not\r\nunreasonably be placed in the course of 1071, and with the alliance of\r\nthe royal houses of Scotland and Wessex the northern kingdom begins to\r\nemerge from its barbaric isolation, and to fill a permanent place in the\r\npolitical scheme of English statesmen.\r\n\r\nTo William the marriage was no matter of congratulation. It meant that\r\nthe Scottish court would become definitely interested in the restoration\r\nof the old English dynasty; so long as such an event were possible, it\r\nwas likely to make Scotland both a refuge and a recruiting ground for\r\nany political exile who might choose to attempt his return by force and\r\narms. To minimise these evils, and to avenge the harrying of 1070, the\r\nConqueror in the summer of 1072 set out for Scotland in person. The\r\nexpedition was planned on a great scale; the fyrd was called out, and\r\nthe naval force which was at William’s command co-operated with the\r\nnative host. Malcolm seems to have felt himself unequal to meeting a\r\nforce of this size in the open field; he allowed William to pass through\r\nLothian and to cross the Forth without any serious obstruction, and the\r\ntwo kings met at Abernethy on the Tay. There Malcolm renewed his homage\r\nto William, made peace, and gave hostages for its observance, among them\r\nDonald, his son by his first wife, Ingibiorg. The expedition could not\r\nhave been intended to accomplish more than this, and William at once\r\nturned southwards, retracing his steps along the great east coast\r\nroad.[247]\r\n\r\nNothing appears to have been done at this time to improve the defences\r\nof the northern border. Carlisle remained in Scotch hands, and the site\r\nof the future Newcastle on the Tyne is only mentioned in the record of\r\nthis march through the fact of the river being flooded at the moment\r\nwhen the army sought to cross it, thereby causing an inconvenient delay.\r\nThe importance of the Teesdale gap had been sufficiently proved by the\r\nevents of 1070, but no attempt was made to guard the course of the river\r\nin any special manner. On the other hand we should do well not to ignore\r\nthe possibility that the first creation of the earldom of Richmond\r\nimmediately to the south of the Tees may not have been unconnected with\r\nthe advisability of keeping a permanent military force in this quarter.\r\nThe earldom in question had been conferred upon Brian of Penthievre in\r\nor before 1068, and had passed from him to his brother Alan by the date\r\nof the events with which we are dealing.[248] So far as we know King\r\nWilliam never created an earldom save for purposes of border defence,\r\nand the geographical facts which we have just noted make it distinctly\r\nimprobable that Richmond was an exception to this rule.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo important changes in the government of Northumbria would seem to\r\nhave been carried out at this time. The first was the installation of\r\nWalcher of Lorraine as bishop of Durham, and his establishment in a\r\ncastle especially built for him, so that he might be secure against any\r\nspasmodic rising on the part of the men of his great diocese. The second\r\nevent was the deposition of Earl Gospatric. He was held guilty, we are\r\ntold, of complicity in the murder of Robert de Comines, and the Danish\r\nstorm of York in 1069, although his offences in both these matters had\r\nbeen committed previous to his reconciliation with William in 1070.\r\nWhatever may have been the true cause of his downfall, it was followed\r\nimmediately by the restoration of the house of Siward to its former\r\nposition in the north, for the earldom of Northumbria was now given to\r\nWaltheof of Huntingdon, Siward’s son, and remained in his hands until\r\nthe catastrophe which overtook him three years later. Gospatric in the\r\nmeantime betook himself to his cousin’s court and received from him a\r\nlarge estate in Lothian, centring round the town of Dunbar, until he\r\nmight be restored to King William’s favour. With this act his political\r\nimportance ceases; Domesday proves that the whole or part of his\r\nYorkshire estates had been restored to him by the time of the taking of\r\nthe Survey, but he never recovered his former rank and influence.\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured with much probability that one of the conditions\r\nof the peace of Abernethy was the expulsion of Edgar the Etheling from\r\nScotland.[249] Shortly after this time he appears as beginning a series\r\nof journeys, which before long brought him once more into England as the\r\nhonoured guest of King William. His first visit was paid to Flanders,\r\nwhere he would be sure of a kindly reception from Robert the Frisian, by\r\nthis time William’s mortal enemy. After a stay of uncertain length in\r\nFlanders he returned to Scotland, where he landed early in July 1074,\r\nand was hospitably entertained by his sister and her husband. Before\r\nlong, however, he received an invitation from King Philip of France,\r\noffering to put him in possession of the castle of Montreuil, which he\r\nmight use as a base from which to attack his enemies.[250] The offer\r\nshows considerable strategical sense in the young king of France.\r\nMontreuil was the first piece of territory which the Capetian house had\r\ngained on the Channel coast, but it was separated by the possessions of\r\nthe house of Vermandois from the body of the royal demesne, and it lay\r\nbetween the counties of Ponthieu and Boulogne. Once established in\r\nMontreuil Edgar could have received constant support from Robert the\r\nFrisian; and if the counts of Ponthieu or Boulogne wished to revolt from\r\nthe Norman connection Edgar’s territory would have made it possible to\r\nform a compact and powerful league against the most vulnerable part of\r\nthe Norman frontier.\r\n\r\nEdgar complied with King Philip’s request, and set out by sea to take\r\npossession of his castle; the good-will of his Scottish protectors being\r\nexpressed in a multitude of costly gifts. Unfortunately for the success\r\nof his enterprise he was speedily driven on to the English coast by a\r\nstorm and some of his men were taken prisoner, but he succeeded in\r\nreaching Scotland again, although in very miserable condition. Curiously\r\nenough this slight check to his plans seems to have caused him to\r\nabandon outright the idea of occupying Montreuil, and we are told that\r\nhis brother-in-law advised him to make terms with King William. The\r\nConqueror was at the time in Normandy, but he gave a ready hearing to\r\nthe overtures from Edgar and directed that an escort should be sent to\r\naccompany him through England and across the Channel. Of the meeting\r\nbetween the king and the etheling in Normandy we possess no details, but\r\nthe English writers were struck with the honours which the Conqueror\r\nshowed to his former rival,[251] and Domesday reveals the latter in\r\npeaceable possession of upwards of a thousand acres of land in the\r\nnorth-east of Hertfordshire. For the rest of William’s reign Edgar\r\nremained a political cipher.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the central event of William’s rule in England, the\r\nrevolt of the earls in 1075. The rising in question is sufficiently\r\ncharacterised by the name which is generally assigned to it; it was a\r\nmovement headed by two of the seven earls who held office in England,\r\nincited by the motives proper to men of their rank, and finding little\r\nsupport outside the body of their personal dependants. It had no popular\r\nor provincial feeling behind it; it cannot even be described as a purely\r\nNorman revolt, for the mass of the English baronage held true to King\r\nWilliam, and its most striking result was the execution of the last\r\nEnglish earl, for complicity in the designs of his Norman confederates.\r\n\r\nOn the death of William Fitz Osbern in 1071 his earldom of Hereford had\r\npassed to his son, a stupid and vicious young man, in every way a\r\ndegenerate successor to the tried and faithful friend of the Conqueror.\r\nFrom the moment of his succession to his earldom Roger seems to have\r\nkept himself in sullen isolation in his palatinate across the Severn;\r\nhis name has not yet been found among the visitors to William’s court\r\nwho witnessed the charters which the king granted during these years,\r\nand we should know nothing about the man or his character if it were not\r\nfor the preservation of three letters addressed to him by his father’s\r\nold friend Archbishop Lanfranc. At the time when these letters were\r\nwritten, William was in Normandy, and Lanfranc had been left in a sort\r\nof unofficial regency, in which position he had clearly been rendered\r\nuneasy by rumours of Roger’s growing disaffection. Lanfranc, in his\r\ncorrespondence, was tactfully indefinite on the latter point, but he was\r\nvery outspoken in regard to Roger’s personal acts of oppression and\r\ninjustice. By the example of William Fitz Osbern, “whom,” says Lanfranc,\r\n“I loved more than anyone else in the world,” the archbishop pleaded\r\nwith his friend’s son to amend his conduct, and promised to see him and\r\ngive him counsel on whatever occasion he might choose. But Roger\r\nremained obdurate, and in the last letter of the three which we possess\r\nLanfranc declares Roger excommunicate until he has compensated those\r\nwhom he has injured, and has made his peace with the king for his\r\narbitrary acts in his earldom.\r\n\r\nThe position of Waltheof at this time has already been described. His\r\nBernician earldom was less important on this occasion than were the\r\ngroup of shires in the eastern midlands over which he also possessed\r\ncomital rights. The four counties of Northampton, Bedford, Huntingdon,\r\nand Cambridge, together with Waltheof’s extensive estates in\r\nLeicestershire and Warwickshire, went far towards connecting the\r\npalatinate of Hereford with the distant earldom of East Anglia, the most\r\ndangerous quarter of the present rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe earl of East Anglia, Ralf of Wader, might, like Waltheof, claim to\r\nbe considered an Englishman; for, although his mother was a Breton and\r\nhis father also bore the Norman name of Ralf, the latter was an\r\nEnglishman of Norfolk birth, and had been earl of East Anglia under\r\nEdward the Confessor and during the earliest years of the Conqueror.\r\nRalf the younger, despite his succession to his father’s earldom, is\r\nidentified with his mother’s land of Brittany, where he held the estates\r\nof Wader and Montfort, rather than with England.[252] Like Roger of\r\nHereford, and judging from the same evidence, Earl Ralf would seem to\r\nhave been a consistent absentee from William’s court, and his one\r\nappearance in the history of the latter’s reign, previous to his own\r\nrevolt in 1075, took place in 1069, when he beat off the Danes from the\r\nestuary of the Yare.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the present outbreak was the Conqueror’s\r\nobjection to a marriage which had been projected between Earl Ralf and\r\nEmma, daughter of William Fitz Osbern and sister of Roger of Hereford.\r\nThe reasons for the Conqueror’s action are intelligible enough; nothing\r\ncould be further from his interest than the creation of a series of\r\nmarriage ties among the greater vassals of his crown, especially when\r\nthe parties to be connected in this way held the wide military and\r\nterritorial powers which at this early date were inherent in the dignity\r\nof an earl. There is no reason to suppose that Earl Ralf’s loyalty had\r\nbeen suspected at any earlier time or that there was anything deeper\r\nthan the royal prohibition of his marriage which now drove him into\r\nrevolt. Without the king’s consent, the marriage was celebrated and the\r\nwedding feast held at Exning in Cambridgeshire, a vill within Waltheof’s\r\nearldom. Earls Roger and Ralf had already made preparations for their\r\nrising, their friends had been acquainted with their intention, and\r\ntheir castles were prepared to stand a siege; and at Exning a determined\r\nattempt was made to seduce Waltheof from his temporary fidelity to King\r\nWilliam. His accession to their cause might very possibly bring with it\r\nsome measure of English support, he had a great popular reputation as a\r\nwarrior, and the plans and motives of the conspirators were unfolded to\r\nhim at the wedding feast with startling frankness. The occasion was\r\nhardly such as to produce sobriety of counsel, and in the one extended\r\nnarrative which we possess of the original plot, the terms of the offer\r\nnow made to Waltheof were involved in a long harangue, in which the\r\ndeposition of the Conqueror was declared to be a matter pleasing to God\r\nand man, and every event in William’s life which could be turned to his\r\ndiscredit was brought forward, heightened according to the taste of the\r\nconspirators or the literary skill of our informant. More important than\r\nthe grotesque crimes attributed to the Conqueror are the plans formed by\r\nthe earls for the event of his expulsion. Their object, we are told, was\r\nto restore England to the condition in which it had existed in the days\r\nof Edward the Confessor. With this object, one of the three chief\r\nplotters was to be king, the other two earls; Waltheof in particular was\r\nto receive a third part of England. William was declared to be fully\r\noccupied beyond the sea, his Normans in England were assumed to be\r\ndiscontented with the reward they had received for their services, and\r\nit was suggested that the native English might be willing to rise once\r\nmore if a chance of revenge were offered them. Waltheof was assured that\r\nthe chances of a successful rising could never be higher than at the\r\nmoment in question.[253]\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Ordericus Vitalis, which we have hitherto been\r\nfollowing, makes Waltheof indignantly refuse to be a party to any scheme\r\nof the kind. By the examples of Ahitophel and Judas Iscariot he\r\ndemonstrated the sinister fate that was the portion of a traitor, and\r\ndeclared that he would never violate the confidence that King William\r\nhad placed in him. On his refusal to join the plot, he was compelled to\r\ntake a terrible oath not to betray the scheme and the rising was\r\naccomplished without his assistance; but after its suppression the tale\r\nmakes Waltheof accused of treason by Judith his wife before the king,\r\nand describes his behaviour in prison and the manner of his end with\r\ngreat wealth of detail and a not improbable approximation to the facts\r\nof the case. It seems fairly certain that Waltheof took no effective\r\npart in the military operations which followed the bridal of Exning, and\r\nwe may consider the difficult question connected with his trial and\r\nexecution apart from the details of the war.\r\n\r\nThe plan of campaign followed by both sides was extremely simple.\r\nNeither the earldom of East Anglia or of Hereford acting by itself could\r\nobtain any permanent success against the loyal portions of the country;\r\nthe object of the rebel leaders was to join their forces, and the object\r\nof King William’s lieutenants was to prevent the combination. The line\r\nof the Severn was guarded against Earl Roger of Hereford by the local\r\nmagnates of Worcestershire, Wulfstan the bishop, and Urse d’Abetot the\r\nsheriff of the shire, Agelwig, abbot of Evesham, and Walter de Lacy, at\r\nthe head of a force composed of the local fyrd in conjunction with the\r\nknightly tenants from their own estates.[254]\r\n\r\nThe Herefordshire revolt had soon run its course; Earl Roger never got\r\nacross the Severn and within a short time had been taken prisoner, but\r\nthe earl of East Anglia was a person of greater ability. Before engaging\r\nin the rebellion the earls had sought for external help; application had\r\nbeen made to the King of Denmark for a fleet, and reinforcements had\r\nbeen drawn from Brittany, recruited in great part, no doubt, from the\r\nBreton estates of Ralf de Wader. From the latter’s head-quarters at\r\nNorwich a highroad of Roman origin stretched invitingly across the\r\nNorfolk plain towards the royal castle of Cambridge, and Earl Ralf moved\r\nwestward in the hope of effecting a junction with Roger of Hereford; but\r\nat an unknown place in the neighbourhood of this line, designated by\r\nOrdericus Vitalis as “Fagadun,” the rebel army was broken and scattered,\r\nand from a letter which Lanfranc wrote to the king immediately after\r\nthis event, the archbishop was evidently in expectation of a speedy\r\nsuppression of the whole rising. That this hope was frustrated was due\r\nto the heroism of Earl Ralf’s bride, who undertook the defence of\r\nNorwich castle in person, while her lord went off to Denmark, and held\r\nout for three months against all that the Norman commanders could do. At\r\nlast she was compelled to surrender upon conditions. The Breton tenants\r\nof Earl Ralf in England were required to abandon their lands and to\r\nwithdraw to Brittany within forty days; the mercenaries of the same race\r\nwere allowed a month to get away from the country. Emma herself, to whom\r\nbelonged all the honours of the war, went to Brittany, where she met her\r\nhusband, and Norwich castle was once more occupied in the king’s name.\r\n\r\nEarl Ralf’s journey to Denmark had not been fruitless, for a fleet of\r\ntwo hundred Danish ships appeared in the Humber shortly after the fall\r\nof Norwich, under the command of Cnut, son of King Swegn Estrithson, and\r\na certain earl called Hakon.[255] Their coming reopened an endless\r\npossibility of further trouble; the Conqueror, through Archbishop\r\nLanfranc, enjoined Bishop Walcher of Durham to look well to the defences\r\nof his castle.[256] But the first object of the ordinary Danish\r\ncommander of those times was always plunder, and Cnut after successfully\r\nevading the royal troops contented himself with the sack of York\r\ncathedral, and quickly sailed away to Flanders. In the very year of this\r\nexpedition (1075), Swegn Estrithson died, and Harold, his eldest son,\r\nwho succeeded him, kept peace towards England throughout his reign. In\r\nthe autumn of 1075 William had returned to England, and at Christmas he\r\nproceeded to deal with the persons and property of the revolted earls.\r\nWaltheof and Roger were in his power; Ralf was safe beyond the sea, but\r\nhis English lands remained for confiscation, and such of his Breton\r\nassociates as were in the king’s hands were punished according to the\r\nfashion of the times. Earl Roger was sent to prison, but his captivity\r\nat first was not over severe, and had it not been for his contumelious\r\nconduct towards the king he might have obtained his release in due\r\ncourse. Unfortunately for himself, he mortally offended William by\r\nthrowing into the fire a rich present of silks and furs which the king\r\nsent to him one Easter, and perpetual captivity was the return for the\r\ninsult. The relative leniency of the Conqueror’s treatment of Roger\r\ncontrasts very strikingly with his attitude to the third earl implicated\r\nin the revolt, and no incident in King William’s career has won more\r\nreprobation from medieval and modern historians than the sentence which\r\nhe allowed to be passed on Earl Waltheof.\r\n\r\nWe have already sketched in outline the narrative of Waltheof’s action\r\nas given by Ordericus Vitalis, and it will be well now to consider\r\nbriefly the independent story told by the native English\r\nchronicles.[257] On all accounts it is certain that Waltheof had been\r\nimplicated in the treason proposed at Exning, and it is no less clear,\r\nthough the fact is suppressed by Orderic, that he had speedily repented\r\nand under the advice of Lanfranc had revealed the whole scheme to King\r\nWilliam in Normandy.[258] The part played by Lanfranc is explicable, not\r\nonly by the species of regency he held in the kingdom at the time, but\r\nalso by his position as metropolitan of the English church, and his\r\nreputation as a famous doctor of the canon law. No man was better\r\nqualified to give a sound opinion as to the circumstances under which an\r\nindiscreet oath might be broken without the guilt of perjury; and the\r\npenances which he imposed on Waltheof for his intended breach of the\r\nengagement which he had taken at Exning seem to have been accepted by\r\nall parties as a satisfactory solution of the matter. On his part,\r\nWilliam bided his time; he appears to have accepted the gifts which\r\nWaltheof offered as the price of his peace, and he contented himself\r\nwith keeping the earl under his own supervision until his return to\r\nEngland. Not till then was Waltheof placed under actual arrest, and it\r\nhas been conjectured that the reason for this action was the fear that\r\nhe might make his escape to the Danes in the Humber.[259] At the\r\nmidwinter council of 1075 he was brought to trial, whether or not upon\r\ninformation laid against him by his wife, the countess Judith, and\r\nalthough no definite sentence was passed against him at this time he was\r\nsent into closer imprisonment at Winchester.\r\n\r\nFor the first five months of 1076 Waltheof’s cause remained undecided.\r\nIt is clear that there was considerable uncertainty in high quarters as\r\nto what should be done with him. Lanfranc interceded on his behalf,\r\napparently going so far as to declare him innocent of all complicity in\r\nthe revolt. We are told nothing of the Conqueror’s own sentiments in the\r\nmatter, but the strange delay in the promulgation of definite sentence\r\nsuggests that throughout these months he had been halting between two\r\nopinions. At last the sterner view prevailed, and under the influence of\r\nWaltheof’s Norman rivals at the royal court, according to Ordericus\r\nVitalis, the king gave orders for the execution of the last English\r\nearl.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 31st of May, Waltheof was taken from his\r\nprison in Winchester to die on the hill of St. Giles outside the city.\r\nAccustomed hitherto to the active life of his northern ancestors, the\r\nmonotony of his imprisonment would seem to have destroyed his courage,\r\nand the fatal morning found him in bitter agony of soul. The\r\nexecutioners, who feared a rescue, and were anxious to get through with\r\nthe work, had little patience with his prayers and weeping, and bade him\r\nrise that they might carry out their orders. Waltheof begged that he\r\nmight be allowed to say a _pater noster_ for himself and them, and they\r\ngranted his request, but at the clause “_et ne nos inducas in\r\ntentationem_” his voice failed him, and he burst into a storm of tears.\r\nBefore he could recover his strength, his head had been struck from him\r\nat a single blow, but the monks of Crowland abbey, where his body lay in\r\nafter years, told their Norman visitor Ordericus Vitalis that the\r\nsevered head was heard duly to finish the prayer with “_sed libera nos a\r\nmalo, Amen_.”\r\n\r\nThe case of Earl Waltheof involves two separate questions which it is\r\nwell to keep distinct in estimating the justice of King William’s\r\nconduct in the matter. The first is how far Waltheof had really\r\nimplicated himself in the designs of the earls of East Anglia and\r\nHereford; the second is what, on the assumption of his serious guilt,\r\nwould have been the lawful punishment for it. It does not seem likely\r\nthat the first question will ever be finally answered, for by a singular\r\nchance none of our authorities are quite disinterested when they relate\r\nthe circumstances of Waltheof’s fall. The Anglo-Saxon chronicler and\r\nFlorence of Worcester, compatriots of the dead earl, lie under some\r\nantecedent suspicion of minimising the extent to which he had\r\ncompromised himself; and Ordericus Vitalis, to whom we should naturally\r\nturn for a statement of the Norman side of the case, based his account\r\nof Waltheof upon information received from the monks of Crowland at a\r\ntime when the earl was, in popular sentiment, rapidly becoming\r\ntransformed into a national martyr. Orderic’s narrative, written under\r\nsuch influences, has just as much historical value as any professed\r\npiece of martyrology; that is, it probably presents the authentic\r\ntradition of the details of its hero’s death, but it is not concerned to\r\npay a scrupulous regard to facts which might be inconvenient for his\r\nreputation. And so King William for once has no apologist; but sixty\r\nyears after the event it was recognised by an impartial writer like\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury[260] that the Norman story about Waltheof was very\r\ndifferent from that which the English put forward. With such\r\nuntrustworthy authorities as our only guides, we should scarcely attempt\r\nto settle a matter which in the days of King Stephen was already a\r\nburning question, but our hesitancy should make us pause before we\r\naccuse King William of judicial murder.\r\n\r\nTo the second of the problems arising out of the case—the sentence which\r\nfollowed Waltheof’s condemnation—it is possible to find a more\r\nsatisfactory answer. Nothing is more probable than that the Conqueror,\r\nin sending Roger of Hereford into prison and beheading Waltheof, was\r\nsimply applying to criminals of high rank the great principle that men\r\nof Norman or of English race should be judged respectively according to\r\nNorman or English law.[261] Earl Roger as a Norman, according to a\r\npractice on which we have already had occasion to remark, was condemned\r\nto imprisonment, but English law regarded treason as a capital offence,\r\nand Waltheof suffered the strict legal penalty of his crime. Indeed,\r\nWaltheof himself, in Orderic’s version of his reply to the conspirators\r\nat Exning, is made to declare that the English law condemned a traitor\r\nto lose his head, and it is probable that he was better informed on this\r\npoint than have been some of the later historians who have undertaken\r\nhis defence. During the next century, members of the Norman baronage\r\nestablished in England who had raised an unsuccessful revolt uniformly\r\nreceived sentence according to the rule which applied to men of their\r\nrace; and the execution of a traitor against the king will scarcely\r\noccur between 1100 and 1200, and but rarely in the course of the\r\nthirteenth century. But Waltheof had no privilege of the kind, and,\r\nstern as was his sentence, he might not complain that formal justice had\r\nbeen denied him.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of 1075 produced a sequel in a small continental war. Earl\r\nRalf, as we have seen, had fled to his estates in Brittany, and his\r\nappearance coincided in point of time with the outbreak of a general\r\nrevolt among the Breton baronage. Count Hoel, who possessed in his own\r\nright five-sixths of Brittany, was the first of his line to exercise\r\neffective rule over the whole peninsula, and the fact was little to the\r\nliking of his greater subjects. The malcontents found a leader in\r\nGeoffrey “Grenonat,” count of Rennes, an illegitimate son of Alan III.;\r\nand the dispossessed earl of East Anglia brought the resources of his\r\nbarony of Wader to their side. Ralf and Geoffrey seized the castle of\r\nDol; and the rising assumed such serious proportions that Hoel sent to\r\nEngland, and requested King William’s assistance. William, ever desirous\r\nof asserting Norman influence in Brittany, took the present opportunity,\r\nand in 1076 he crossed the Channel with a force which to the chroniclers\r\nof Worcester and Peterborough represented an English fyrd, and laid\r\nsiege to Dol. The result was a serious loss of prestige, for the\r\ngarrison had answered Hoel’s application to William by making a\r\ncounter-appeal to Philip of France, and held out valiantly in the\r\nexpectation of relief. Philip took the field with a large army, advanced\r\nto Dol, and took a measure of revenge for his father’s discomfitures at\r\nMortemer and Varaville, by compelling William to beat a hasty retreat\r\nwith the loss of his baggage and stores. William engaged no further in\r\nthe war which dragged on for three years longer, but ended in 1079 with\r\nthe final success of Hoel.[262]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, certain important changes had taken place in the\r\nadministrative geography of England. The earldoms of Hereford and East\r\nAnglia, vacant through the treason of Earls Roger and Ralf, were allowed\r\nto fall into abeyance. Waltheof’s earldom of Northampton likewise became\r\nextinct, although his widow, the countess Judith, was possessed in 1086\r\nof large estates scattered over the shires which had lain within her\r\nhusband’s government. There was no particular reason why\r\nNorthamptonshire should possess an earl, but it was still abundantly\r\nnecessary that William should be represented by a permanent lieutenant\r\non the Scotch border. An earl for Bernicia was now found in the person\r\nof Walcher of Lorraine, whose appointment anticipated by more than sixty\r\nyears the beginning of the long series of bishops of Durham, whose\r\nsecular powers within their diocese produced the “county palatine” which\r\nlasted until 1836.[263] The experiment made in Walcher’s appointment was\r\ndestined to end in tragic failure, but for four years Northumbrian\r\naffairs relapse into unwonted obscurity, and the Conqueror was never\r\nagain called upon to lead an army into the north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denier of Robert le Frison]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:\r\n\r\n  See Varenbergh, _Relations Diplomatiques entre le comté de Flandre et\r\n  l’Angleterre_.

It must be owned that no unity of\r\npurpose or achievement can be traced underlying this final stage; the\r\nhistory of these last years is little more than a series of disconnected\r\nepisodes, of which the details themselves are very imperfectly known to\r\nus. It has, in fact, been customary for historians to regard this period\r\nas marking somewhat of a decline in the character and fortunes of the\r\nConqueror; a decline which the men of the next generation were inclined\r\nto attribute to supernatural vengeance pursuing the king for his\r\nexecution of Earl Waltheof in 1076. “Such was his resolution,” says\r\nOrderic, “that he still maintained a brave fight against his enemies,\r\nbut success did not crown his enterprises now as formerly, nor were his\r\nbattles often crowned with victory.”[264] This idea of retributive fate,\r\ncharacteristic of the medieval mind, has received from historians\r\nvarious adaptations and exemplifications, but perhaps a more reasonable\r\nexplanation of the tameness of the last years of the Conqueror would be\r\nthat the achievements of the decade between 1060 and 1070 inevitably\r\nmake the succeeding history something of an anticlimax. The Conqueror’s\r\nlast wars are indeed inconsiderable enough when compared with the\r\ncampaigns of Le Mans and Hastings, but the most unique undertaking of\r\nhis life falls within two years of its close; and with the Domesday\r\nSurvey before us we need no further proof that the far-sightedness of\r\nthe king’s policy and the strength of his executive power were still\r\nunimpaired at the very close of his career.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of the difficulties which beset the King in these latter\r\nyears was the undutiful eagerness of Robert of Normandy to anticipate\r\nhis inheritance. It was natural enough that Robert should wish to enjoy\r\nthe reality of power; for a dozen years at least he had been the\r\nrecognised heir of Normandy, and the peace of Blanchelande had recently\r\nassigned him the county of Maine. But so early as 1074 the earls of\r\nHereford and Norfolk, in planning their revolt, are understood to have\r\nreckoned the disagreement between the King and his eldest son among the\r\nchances in their favour,[265] and it is certain that Robert had been\r\nbitterly discontented with his position for some time before he broke\r\nout into open revolt. The chronology of his movements is far from clear;\r\nbut at some time or other he made a wild attempt to seize the castle of\r\nRouen, and when this failed he found an immediate refuge and base of\r\noperations in the land of Hugh de Châteauneuf, a powerful lord on the\r\nborder between Normandy and the royal demesne, who allowed him to occupy\r\nhis castles of Raimalast, Sorel, and Châteauneuf. King William, on his\r\npart, confiscated the lands of the rebels; he also took into his pay\r\nCount Rotrou of Mortagne, the overlord of Hugh of Châteauneuf for\r\nRaimalast; and Robert was soon driven to seek a more distant exile in\r\nforeign parts. He first visited Flanders, but Robert the Frisian,\r\nnotwithstanding his enmity towards his formidable brother-in-law, did\r\nnot think it worth while to spend his resources upon his irresponsible\r\nnephew, for the latter is represented as wandering vaguely over\r\nTouraine, Germany, Aquitaine, and Gascony in great destitution. To such\r\nstraits was he reduced, that his mother provoked the one dispute which\r\nvaried the domestic peace of the Conqueror’s married life by sending\r\nsupplies to her son in exile. The king, on discovering this, became\r\nconvulsed with rage, poured reproaches on his queen for her support of a\r\nrebel, and ordered one of her messengers, who happened to be within his\r\npower, to be seized and blinded. The latter, however, a Breton named\r\nSamson, received a timely hint of his danger from persons in the\r\nconfidence of the queen, and took refuge in the monastery of St. Evroul,\r\n“for the safety alike of his soul and body,” says Ordericus Vitalis, who\r\nfor some forty years was his fellow-inmate in the abbey.\r\n\r\nAt last King Philip took pity upon the fugitive Robert and allowed him\r\nto establish himself in the castle of Gerberoi in the Beauvaisis. The\r\nking’s patronage of Robert ranks, as a matter of policy, with his gift\r\nof Montreuil to Edgar the Etheling in 1074; Philip was always ready to\r\ntake an inexpensive opportunity of harassing his over-mighty vassal.\r\nAround Robert, in this cave of Adullam, there gathered a force of\r\nadventurers from Normandy and the French kingdom, including many men who\r\nhad hitherto been good subjects to King William, but now thought it\r\nexpedient to follow the rising fortunes of his heir. William retaliated\r\nby garrisoning the Norman castles which lay nearest to Gerberoi, so as\r\nto prevent the rebels from harrying the border; and in some way he must\r\nhave brought the king of France over to his side; for when, in the last\r\ndays of 1078, he laid formal siege to his son’s castle, we know on good\r\nauthority that King Philip was present in his camp.[266] The siege\r\nlasted for three weeks, and in one of the frequent encounters between\r\nthe loyalists and the rebels there occurred the famous passage of arms\r\nbetween the Conqueror and his son. William was wounded in the hand by\r\nRobert, his horse was killed under him, and had not a Berkshire thegn,\r\nTokig, son of Wigod of Wallingford, gallantly brought another mount to\r\nthe king,[267] it is probable that his life would have come to an\r\nignominious close beneath the walls of Gerberoi. It was very possibly\r\nthe scandal caused by this episode which led certain prominent members\r\nof the Norman baronage to offer their mediation between the king and his\r\nheir. The siege seems to have been broken up by mutual consent; William\r\nretired to Rouen, Robert made his way once more into Flanders, and a\r\nreconciliation was effected by the efforts of Roger de Montgomery, Roger\r\nde Beaumont, Hugh de Grentemaisnil, and other personal friends of the\r\nking. Robert was restored to favour, his confederates were pardoned, and\r\nhe once more received a formal confirmation of his title to the duchy of\r\nNormandy. For a short time, as charters show, he continued to fill his\r\nrightful place at his father’s court, but his vagabond instincts soon\r\nbecame too strong for him and he left the duchy again, not to return to\r\nit during his father’s lifetime.\r\n\r\nOne is naturally inclined to make some comparison between these events\r\nand the rebellion which a hundred years later convulsed the dominions of\r\nHenry II. Fundamentally, the cause of each disturbance was the same—the\r\nanxiety of the reigning king to secure the succession, met by equal\r\nanxiety on the part of the destined heir to enjoy the fruits of\r\nlordship. And in each case the character of the respective heirs was\r\nmuch the same. Robert Curthose and Henry Fitz Henry, both men of\r\nchivalry, rather than of politics, showed themselves incapable of\r\nappreciating the motives which made their fathers wish to maintain the\r\nintegrity of the family possessions; the fact that they themselves were\r\ndebarred from rewarding their private friends and punishing their\r\nenemies, seemed to them a sufficient reason for imperilling the results\r\nof the statesmanship which had created the very inheritance which they\r\nhoped to enjoy. Robert of Normandy, a gross anticipation of the\r\nchivalrous knight of later times, represents a type of character which\r\nhad hitherto been unknown among the sons of Rollo, a type for which\r\nthere was no use in the rough days when the feudal states of modern\r\nEurope were in the making, and which could not attain any refined\r\ndevelopment before the Crusades had lifted the art and the ideals of war\r\non to a higher plane. William the Conqueror, by no means devoid of\r\nchivalrous instincts, never allowed them to obscure his sense of what\r\nthe policy of the moment demanded; Henry II. was much less affected by\r\nthe new spirit; both rulers alike were essentially out of sympathy with\r\nsons to whom great place meant exceptional opportunities for the\r\nexcitement and glory of military adventure, rather than the stern\r\nresponsibilities of government.\r\n\r\nWe know little that is definite about the course of events which\r\nfollowed upon the reconciliation of King William and his heir. The\r\nnext two years indeed form a practical blank in the personal history\r\nof the Conqueror, and it does not seem probable that he ever visited\r\nEngland during this interval. In his absence the king of Scots took\r\nthe opportunity of spreading destruction once again across the border,\r\nand in the summer of 1079 he harried the country as far as the Tyne,\r\nwithout hindrance, so far as our evidence goes, from the clerical earl\r\nof Northumbria. The success of this raid was a sufficient proof of the\r\nweakness of the Northern frontier of England, and in the next\r\nyear[268] Robert of Normandy was entrusted with the command of a\r\ncounter-expedition into Scotland, with orders to receive the\r\nsubmission of the king of Scots, or, in case he proved obdurate, to\r\ntreat his land as an enemies’ country. The Norman army penetrated\r\nScotland as far as Falkirk, and, according to one account, received\r\nhostages as a guarantee of King Malcolm’s obedience. Another and more\r\nstrictly contemporary narrative, however, states that this part of the\r\nexpedition was fruitless; but, in any case, Robert on his return\r\nfounded the great fortress of Newcastle-on-Tyne as a barrier against\r\nfuture incursions from the side of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                              PITCHER, PHOTO. GLOUCESTER\r\n\r\n                        TOMB OF ROBERT COURTHOSE\r\n\r\nSome information as to William’s own movements in Normandy during 1080\r\nmay be gathered from charters and other legal documents. On the 7th of\r\nJanuary he was at Caen,[269] and on the 13th he appears at Boscherville\r\non the Seine[270]; at Easter he held a great court probably at\r\nRouen.[271] At Whitsuntide he presided over a council at\r\nLillebonne,[272] where a set of canons was promulgated which strikingly\r\nillustrates his opinion as to the relations which should exist between\r\nchurch and state.\r\n\r\nWhitsunday in 1080 fell on the 31st of May, and serious disturbances had\r\nbeen taking place in England earlier in the month. Bishop Walcher of\r\nDurham had proved an unpopular as well as an inefficient earl of\r\nNorthumbria. Himself a foreigner and a churchman, he must from the\r\noutset have been out of touch with the wild Englishmen placed under his\r\nrule, and the situation was aggravated by the fact that the bishop’s\r\npriestly office compelled him to transact the work of government in\r\ngreat part by deputy. He entrusted the administration of his earldom to\r\na kinsman of his own called Gilbert,[273] and in all matters of business\r\nhe relied on the counsel of an ill-assorted pair of favourites, one of\r\nthem a noble Northumbrian thegn called Ligulf, who found his way to his\r\nfavour by the devotion which he professed to Saint Cuthbert, the other\r\nbeing his own chaplain, Leobwine, a foreigner. Jealousy soon broke out\r\nbetween the thegn and the chaplain, and at last the latter, being\r\nworsted by his rival in a quarrel in the bishop’s presence, took the\r\nabove mentioned Gilbert into his confidence and prevailed on him to\r\ndestroy the Englishman secretly. On hearing the news the bishop was\r\nstruck with dismay, and, in his anxiety to prove his innocence, summoned\r\na general meeting of the men of his earldom to assemble at Gateshead.\r\nThe assembly came together, but the Bernicians were in a dangerous\r\nhumour; the bishop dared not risk a deliberation in the open air, and\r\ntook refuge in the neighbouring church. Instantly the gathering got out\r\nof hand, the church was surrounded and set on fire, and the bishop and\r\nhis companions were cut to pieces by the mob.\r\n\r\nFor such an act as this there could be no mercy. The punishment of the\r\nmurderers was left to Walcher’s fellow-prelate Odo of Bayeux, and the\r\nvengeance which he took was heavy. It must have been impossible to\r\ndetermine with accuracy the names of those who had actually joined in\r\nthe crime, but it is evident that men from all parts of Bernicia had\r\ntaken part in the meeting at Gateshead, and the whole earldom was held\r\nimplicated in the murder. Accordingly the whole district was ravaged,\r\nand the bishop of Bayeux administered death and mutilation on a scale\r\nunusual even in the eleventh century.[274] To the thankless dignity of\r\nthe Northumbrian earldom, the Conqueror appointed Aubrey de Coucy, a\r\npowerful Norman baron; but he soon abandoned the task of governing his\r\ndistressful province and retired to his continental estates. To him\r\nthere succeeded Robert de Mowbray, who was destined to be the last earl\r\nof Bernicia, but who proved more successful than any of his predecessors\r\nin the work of preserving order and watching the movements of the king\r\nof Scots; and for the next ten years Northumbria under his stern rule\r\nceases to trouble the central administration.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the following year in the history of the Conqueror\r\nlies in the singular expedition which he made at this time beyond the\r\nlimits of his immediate rule into the extreme parts of Wales. The\r\nvarious but scanty accounts of this event which we possess are somewhat\r\nconflicting. The Peterborough chronicler says that the king “in this\r\nyear led an army into Wales and there freed many hundred men.” The\r\n_Annales Cambriæ_ tell us that “William, king of the English, came to\r\nSt. David’s that he might pray there.” Very possibly the Conqueror did\r\nin reality pay his devotions at the shrine of the apostle of Wales, but\r\nsecular motives were not lacking for an armed demonstration in that\r\nrestless land. So long as the Normans in England itself were only a\r\nruling minority, holding down a disaffected population, the conquest of\r\nWales was an impossibility; and yet on all grounds it was expedient for\r\nthe king to show the Welshmen what reserves of power lay behind his\r\nmarcher earls of Shrewsbury and Chester. The expedition has a further\r\ninterest as one of the earliest occasions on which it is recorded that\r\nthe feudal host of England was called to take the field; the local\r\nhistorian of Abingdon abbey remarked that nearly all the knights\r\nbelonging to that church were ordered to set out for Wales, although the\r\nabbot remained at home.[275] It does not appear that any of the native\r\nprinces of South Wales suffered displacement at this time; the one\r\npermanent result of the expedition would seem to have been the\r\nfoundation of Cardiff castle[276] as an outpost in the enemies’ land.\r\nThe strategical frontier of England in this quarter consisted of the\r\nline of fortresses which guarded the lower course of the Wye, and the\r\nsettlement of the Welsh question, like the settlement of the Scotch\r\nquestion, was a legacy which the Conqueror left to his successors.\r\n\r\nAfter these events, but not before the end of the year, King William\r\nwithdrew into Normandy, and probably spent the greater part of 1082 in\r\nhis duchy. But his return to England was marked by one of the most\r\ndramatic incidents in his whole career, the famous scene of the arrest\r\nof Odo, bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent. Up to the very moment of the\r\nbishop’s fall, the relations between the brothers appear to have been\r\noutwardly friendly, and in an English charter of the present year, the\r\nbishop appears at court in full enjoyment of his lay and spiritual\r\ntitles.[277] The cause of the final rupture is uncertain. Ordericus\r\nVitalis[278] assigned it to the unprecedented ambition of Bishop Odo,\r\nwho, not content with his position in England and Normandy, was supposed\r\nto be laying his plans to secure his election to the papal chair at the\r\nnext vacancy. According to this tale, the bishop had bought himself a\r\npalace in Rome, bribed the senators to join his side, and engaged a\r\nlarge number of Norman knights, including no less a person than the earl\r\nof Chester, to follow him into Italy when the time for action came.\r\nWhatever Odo’s plans may have been, William received news of them in\r\nNormandy, and he hurried across the Channel, intercepting Odo in the\r\nIsle of Wight. Without being actually arrested, Odo was placed under\r\nrestraint, and a special sitting of the Commune Concilium was convened\r\nto try his case. The subsequent proceedings were conducted in the Isle\r\nof Wight, very possibly in the royal castle of Carisbrooke, and King\r\nWilliam himself seems to have undertaken his brother’s impeachment. The\r\narticles laid against Odo fell into two parts, a specific charge of\r\nseducing the king’s knights from their lawful duty, and a general\r\naccusation of oppression and wrong-doing to the church and to the native\r\npopulation of the land. The task of giving judgment on these points\r\nbelonged by customary law to the barons in council, but they failed to\r\ngive sentence through fear of the formidable defendant before them, and\r\nthe Conqueror himself was compelled to issue orders for Odo’s arrest.\r\nHere another difficulty presented itself, for no one dared lay hands on\r\na bishop; and upon William seizing his brother with his own hands, Odo\r\ncried out, “I am a bishop and the Lord’s minister; a bishop may not be\r\ncondemned without the judgment of the Pope.” To this claim of episcopal\r\nprivilege William replied that he arrested not the bishop of Bayeux, but\r\nthe earl of Kent, and Odo was sent off straightway in custody to the\r\nTower of Rouen. At a later date it was suggested that the distinction\r\nbetween the bishop’s lay and spiritual functions was suggested to the\r\nking by Lanfranc,[279] whose opinion as an expert in the canon law was\r\nincontrovertible; and apart from the dramatic interest of the scene the\r\ntrial of Odo has special importance as one of the few recorded cases in\r\nwhich a question of clerical immunity was raised before the promulgation\r\nof the Constitutions of Clarendon.\r\n\r\nThe one extended narrative which we possess of these events was composed\r\nsome forty years after the date in question, and the scheme which is\r\nattributed to Bishop Odo may well seem too visionary a project to have\r\nbeen undertaken by that very hard-headed person, yet on the whole we\r\nshall probably do well to pay respect to Orderic’s version of the\r\nincident. For, although the militant lord of Bayeux might seem to us an\r\nincongruous successor for the saintly Hildebrand, it must as yet have\r\nbeen uncertain how far the church as a whole had really identified\r\nitself with the ideals which found their greatest exponent in Gregory\r\nVII., and the situation in Italy itself was such as to invite the\r\nintervention of a prelate capable of wielding the secular arm. The\r\nstruggle between pope and emperor was at its height, and within three\r\nyears from the date of Odo’s arrest Hildebrand himself was to die in\r\nexile from his city, while Norman influence was all-powerful in south\r\nItaly. The tradition represented in Orderic’s narrative shows an\r\nappreciation of the general situation, and if we regard the motive\r\nassigned for Odo’s preparations as merely the monastery gossip of the\r\nnext generation, yet the bishop’s imprisonment is a certain fact, and\r\nthe unusual bitterness of King William towards his half-brother would\r\nsuggest that something more than political disloyalty gave point to the\r\nlatter’s schemes. Nevertheless the captivity in which Bishop Odo\r\nexpiated his ambition cannot have been enforced with very great\r\nseverity, for in the five years which intervened between his disgrace\r\nand William’s death he appears at least occasionally in attendance at\r\nhis brother’s court.\r\n\r\nThe circle of the Conqueror’s immediate companions was rapidly breaking\r\nup now. On November 3rd, 1083, Queen Matilda died, and was buried in the\r\nconvent of the Holy Trinity at Caen, which she had founded in return for\r\nher lord’s safety amid the perils of his invasion of England. Archbishop\r\nLanfranc and Earl Roger of Montgomery almost alone represented the\r\nfriends of King William’s early manhood at the councils of his last four\r\nyears. Through all the hazards of her married life Matilda of Flanders\r\nhad played her part well; if William the Conqueror alone among all the\r\nmen of his house kept his sexual purity unstained to the last, something\r\nat least of this may be set down to his love for the bride whom he had\r\nwon, thirty years before, in defiance of all ecclesiastical censure. Nor\r\nshould Matilda’s excellence be conceived of as lying wholly in the\r\ndomestic sphere; William could leave his duchy in her hands when he set\r\nout to win a kingdom for himself and her, and William was no\r\ncontemptible judge of practical ability in others. We shall hardly find\r\nin all English medieval history another queen consort who takes a place\r\nat once more prominent and more honourable.\r\n\r\nIn the year following Queen Matilda’s death, the Conqueror’s attention\r\nwas for the last time concentrated on the affairs of Maine, and in a\r\nmanner which illustrates the uncertain tenure by which the Normans still\r\nheld their southern dependency. Twenty years of Norman rule had failed\r\nto reconcile the Manceaux to the alien government. The rising of 1073\r\nhad proved the strength and extent of the disaffection, and from the\r\nevents of the present year it is plain that the Norman element in Maine\r\nwas no more than a garrison in hostile territory, although the\r\ndisturbance which called William into the field in 1084 was merely the\r\nrevolt of a great Mancel baron fighting for his own hand, which should\r\nnot be dignified with the name of a national movement. In the centre of\r\nthe county the castle of Sainte-Suzanne stands on a high rock\r\noverlooking the river Arne, one of the lesser tributaries of the Sarthe.\r\nThis fortress, together with the castles of Beaumont and Fresnay on the\r\ngreater river, belonged to Hubert the viscount of Maine, who had been a\r\nprominent leader of the Mancel nationalists in the war of 1063, and had\r\nsubsequently married a niece of Duke Robert of Burgundy. Formidable\r\nalike from his position in Maine and his connection with the Capetian\r\nhouse, Hubert proved himself an unruly subject of the Norman _princeps\r\nCenomannorum_ and after sundry acts of disaffection he broke into open\r\nrevolt, abandoned his castles of Fresnay and Beaumont, and concentrated\r\nhis forces on the height of Sainte-Suzanne. Like Robert of Normandy at\r\nGerberoi, five years before, Hubert made his castle a rendezvous for all\r\nthe restless adventurers of the French kingdom, who soon became\r\nintolerable to the Norman garrisons in Le Mans and its neighbourhood.\r\nThe latter, it would seem, were not strong enough to divide their forces\r\nfor an attack on Sainte-Suzanne, and sent an appeal for help to King\r\nWilliam, who thereupon gathered an army in Normandy, and made ready for\r\nhis last invasion of Maine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR\r\n\r\n  (AS CONCEIVED BY A FRENCH PAINTER OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY)\r\n\r\n  THE ORIGINAL OF THIS PICTURE, NOW LOST, WAS PAINTED BY AN ARTIST WHEN\r\n    THE TOMB OF THE CONQUEROR WAS OPENED IN 1522.

ETIENNE’S CHURCH AT CAEN;\r\n    THE PRESENT ILLUSTRATION IS FROM A PHOTOGRAPH OF THAT COPY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN NORMANDY]\r\n\r\nBut for once in his life the Conqueror found himself confronted by an\r\nirreducible fortress. “He did not venture to lay siege to the castle of\r\nSainte-Suzanne,” says Orderic,\r\n\r\n  “it being rendered impregnable by its position on rocks and the dense\r\n  thickets of vineyards which surrounded it, nor could he confine the\r\n  enemy within the fortress as he wished, since the latter was strong\r\n  enough to control supplies and was in command of the communications.\r\n  The king therefore built a fortification in the valley of Bonjen, and\r\n  placed therein a strong body of troops to repress the raids of the\r\n  enemy, being himself compelled to return into Normandy on weighty\r\n  affairs.”[280]\r\n\r\nAs William had no prospect of reducing the castle, either by storm or\r\nblockade, he was well advised to save his personal prestige by retreat,\r\nbut the garrison of his counterwork under his lieutenant Alan Earl of\r\nRichmond proved themselves unequal to the task assigned them. For three\r\nyears, according to Orderic, the operations in the Arne valley dragged\r\non, and the fame of Hubert’s successful resistance attracted an\r\nincreasing stream of volunteers from remote parts of France. At last,\r\nwhen many knights of fame had been killed or taken prisoner, the\r\ndisheartened Normans at Bonjen resolved to bring about a reconciliation\r\nbetween the king and the viscount. William was in England at the time,\r\nand on receiving details of the Norman losses before Sainte-Suzanne he\r\nshowed himself willing to come to terms with Hubert, who thereupon\r\ncrossed the Channel under a safe conduct and was restored to favour at\r\nthe royal court.[281]\r\n\r\nWith this failure closes the record of the Conquerors achievements in\r\nMaine. The events of the next ten years proved that the triumph of\r\nHubert of Sainte-Suzanne was more than the accidental success of a\r\nrebellious noble; a national force lay behind him and his crew of\r\nadventurers, which came to the front when Helie de la Flèche struggled\r\nfor the county of Maine with William Rufus. In the process which during\r\nthe next half-century was consolidating the feudal world of France,\r\nMaine could not persist in isolated independence, but its final\r\nabsorption into Anjou was less repugnant to local patriotism and the\r\nfacts of geography than its annexation by the lords of Rouen. Those who\r\nhave a taste for historical parallels may fairly draw one between\r\nWilliam’s wars in Maine and his descendant Edward I.’s attack on the\r\nautonomy of Scotland, with reference to the manner in which an initial\r\nsuccess was reversed after the death of the great soldier who had won\r\nit, by the irreconcilable determination of the conquered people. But\r\nthere lies a problem which cannot be wholly answered in the question why\r\nKing William’s work, so permanent in the case of England, was so soon\r\nundone in the case of the kindred land of Maine.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Conqueror’s placability toward Hubert of\r\nSainte-Suzanne was not unconnected with a more formidable danger\r\nthreatening England from the north and east. Once more the Scandinavian\r\nperil hung over the land. Harold of Denmark, the eldest son of Swegn\r\nEstrithson, had died in 1080, and his brother and successor Cnut married\r\nthe daughter of William’s inveterate enemy, Count Robert of Flanders. In\r\nthis way a family alliance between the two strongest naval powers of the\r\nnorth was called into being; and in 1085 the king and the count planned\r\na joint invasion of England. Cnut attempted to draw King Olaf of Norway\r\ninto the expedition, and received from him a contingent of sixty ships,\r\nbut Olaf would not join in person, giving as his reason that the kings\r\nof Norway had always been less successful than the kings of Denmark in\r\nenterprises against England, and that his kingdom had not yet recovered\r\nfrom the disaster of 1066.[282] But now, as in the former year, England\r\nhad no fleet available for serious naval operations; and King William’s\r\nsubjects must have thought that his defensive measures were as ruinous\r\nto the districts affected as the passage of an invading army itself. The\r\nking was in Normandy when he became apprised of the danger, and he\r\nhastened across the Channel, with a great force of French and Breton\r\nmercenaries, “so that people wondered how the land could feed all that\r\narmy,” remarks the Peterborough chronicler. The king arranged for the\r\nbilleting of the host among his barons, and then proceeded deliberately\r\nto lay waste the parts of the country exposed to attack; a precaution\r\nwhich would have kept the enemy from advancing far from the coast, but\r\nwhich must have cruelly afflicted the poorer folk of the eastern\r\nshires.[283] Meanwhile a great armament from Flanders and Denmark had\r\nbeen gathered in the Lijm fiord, and all was ready for the voyage when\r\non July 10, 1086, Cnut was murdered in the church of Odensee.[284] His\r\ndeath meant the abandonment of the expedition, but is probable that his\r\nabortive schemes contributed to one of the most notable events of\r\nWilliam’s reign—the oath of Salisbury of 1086.\r\n\r\nThe king had kept the feast of 1086 at Winchester and had knighted his\r\nyoungest son, Henry, in the Whitsuntide council at Westminster. Not long\r\nafterwards he turned westward again, and by the first of August had come\r\nto Salisbury, where he held an assembly of very exceptional character.\r\n“There his Witan came to him,” says the Anglo-Saxon chronicler, “and all\r\nthe landholding men in England, no matter whose men they might be, and\r\nswore him fealty that they would be true to him against all men.”[285]\r\nThe native chronicler in his cell at Peterborough was evidently\r\nimpressed by the scale of all the Conqueror’s measures in these last\r\nyears, and his statement that all the land-holding men in England came\r\nto the Salisbury meeting must not be construed too literally, but he has\r\nseen clearly enough what was the real purpose of the famous oath. It was\r\nno slight matter that King William was strong enough to exact from each\r\nmesne tenant in his kingdom an absolute oath of allegiance to himself in\r\nperson, without explicit reference to the tie of homage which bound\r\nindividual tenants to their immediate lords. But, significant as is this\r\nclear enunciation of the principle that the king’s claim to fealty\r\noverrides the lord’s claim to service, it should not be taken to imply\r\nany revolutionary change in the current doctrines of feudal law. It is\r\nhighly probable that this general oath was demanded with the single\r\npurpose of providing against the defection of disloyal knights and\r\nbarons to Cnut of Denmark in the imminent event of his landing. News\r\ntravelled slowly in the eleventh century, and King William at Salisbury\r\non August 1st could not well have heard of the murder at Odensee on July\r\n10th. But apart from this, any feudal monarch could have maintained in\r\ntheory that the facts of subinfeudation should not invalidate his\r\nsovereign rights; the question was merely as to the possibility of\r\nenforcing the latter. The exceptional power enjoyed by William and his\r\nsuccessors in this respect was due to the intimate relations established\r\nbetween the king and his feudatories by the circumstances of the\r\nConquest; the Oath of Salisbury was a striking incident and little more.\r\n\r\nIt was probably not long after the famous scene at Salisbury that the\r\nConqueror crossed the Channel for the last time. No chronicler has\r\nrecorded the name of the port which witnessed King William’s last\r\nembarkation, but we know that he called at the Isle of Wight on his way\r\nto Normandy, and we may suppose that he had set sail from some Hampshire\r\nor Sussex haven. His subjects probably rejoiced at his departure, for\r\nEngland had fallen on evil times in these last years. The summer of 1086\r\nhad been disastrous for a population never living far from the margin of\r\nsubsistence. “This year was very grievous,” laments the native\r\nchronicler, “and ruinous and sorrowful in England through the murrain;\r\ncorn and fruit could not be gathered and one cannot well think how\r\nwretched was the weather, there was such dreadful thunder and lightning,\r\nwhich killed many men, and always kept growing worse and worse. God\r\nAlmighty amend it when it please him.” But the bad harvest brought its\r\ninevitable train of famine and pestilence, and 1087 was worse than 1086\r\nhad been. It was the agony of this year that called forth the famous\r\npicture of the Conqueror’s fiscal exactions, how the miserly king leased\r\nhis lands at the highest rent that could be wrung out of the poor men by\r\nright or wrong; how his servants exacted unlawful tolls. Medieval\r\nfinance was not elastic enough to adapt itself to the alternation of\r\ngood and bad seasons; and in a time of distress men were crushed to the\r\nearth by rents and taxes, which, as Domesday Book shows, they could\r\nafford to bear well enough in years of normal plenty. The monk of\r\nPeterborough took no account of this, and yet he clearly felt that he\r\nhad reached the climax of disaster as he recorded the death of William\r\nthe Conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Vexin Française, which, by a singular chance, was to\r\ncost the Conqueror his life, originated in the days of Duke Robert of\r\nNormandy and Henry I. of France. We have seen that King Henry, in return\r\nfor help given by Robert to him in the difficult time of his accession,\r\nceded the Vexin Française to the Norman Duke. Drogo, the reigning count,\r\nremained true to the Norman connection, and accompanied Duke Robert to\r\nthe Holy Land, where he died; but his son Walter wished to detach the\r\nVexin from association with Normandy and to replace himself under the\r\ndirect sovereignty of the king of France. He proved his hostility to\r\nWilliam of Normandy in the campaign of Mortemer, and by the claims which\r\nhe raised to the county of Maine in 1063, but he died without issue, and\r\nhis possessions passed to his first cousin, Ralf III., count of Valois.\r\nThe house of Valois was not unfriendly to Normandy, and from 1063 to\r\n1077 its powerful possessions were a standing menace to the royal\r\ndemesne. But in the latter year the family estates were broken up by a\r\ndramatic event. Simon de Crepy, the son of Count Ralf, who had\r\nsuccessfully maintained his position against Philip I., felt\r\nnevertheless a desire to enter the religious life, and on his wedding\r\nnight he suddenly announced his determination, persuaded his young bride\r\nto follow his example, and retired from the world. Philip I. thereupon\r\nreunited the Vexin to the royal demesne without opposition from William\r\nof Normandy, who was at the time much occupied with the affairs of\r\nMaine.[286] For ten years William acquiesced in the state of affairs,\r\nand his present action took the form of a reprisal for certain raids\r\nwhich the Frenchmen in Mantes had lately been making across the Norman\r\nborder. It would clearly have been useless to expect King Philip to\r\nintervene, and William accordingly raised the whole Vexin question once\r\nmore, and demanded possession of Pontoise, Chaumont, and Mantes, three\r\ntowns which command the whole province.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem that Philip made any attempt to defend his threatened\r\nfrontier, and he is reported to have treated William’s threats with\r\ncontempt. Thereupon, the Conqueror, stung by some insult which passed at\r\nthe time, suddenly threw himself with a Norman force across the Epte,\r\nand harried the country until he came to Mantes itself. The garrison had\r\nleft their posts on the previous day, in order to inspect the\r\ndevastation which the Normans had wrought in the neighbourhood, and were\r\nsurprised by King William’s arrival. Garrison and invaders rushed in\r\ntogether headlong through the gates of the city, but the Normans had the\r\nvictory, and Mantes was ruthlessly burned. And then King William, while\r\nriding among the smouldering ruins of his last conquest, in some way not\r\nquite clearly known, was thrown violently upon the pommel of his saddle,\r\nand his injury lay beyond the resources of the rough surgery of the\r\neleventh century.\r\n\r\nStricken thus with a mortal blow, King William left the wasted Vexin for\r\nhis capital of Rouen, and for six weeks of a burning summer his great\r\nstrength struggled with the pain of his incurable hurt. At first he lay\r\nwithin the city of Rouen itself, but as the days passed he became less\r\nable to bear the noise of the busy port, and he bade his attendants\r\ncarry him to the priory of Saint-Gervase, which stands on a hill to the\r\nwest of the town. The progress of his sickness left his senses\r\nunimpaired to the last, and in the quiet priory the Conqueror told the\r\nstory of his life to his sons William and Henry, his friend and\r\nphysician Gilbert Maminot, bishop of Lisieux, Guntard, abbot of\r\nJumièges, and a few others who had come to witness the end of their\r\nlord. Two independent narratives of King William’s _apologia_ have\r\nsurvived to our day, and, although monastic tradition may have framed\r\nthe tale somewhat to purposes of edification, yet we can see that it was\r\nin no ignoble spirit that the Conqueror, under the shadow of imminent\r\ndeath, reviewed the course of his history. He called to mind with\r\nsatisfaction his constant devotion and service to Holy Church, his\r\npatronage of learned men, and the religious houses founded under his\r\nrule. If he had been a man of war from his youth up he cast the blame in\r\npart upon the disloyal kinsmen, the jealous overlord, the aggressive\r\nrivals who had beset him from his childhood, but for the conquest of\r\nEngland, in this his supreme moment, he attempted no justification. In\r\nhis pain and weariness, the fame he had shed upon the Norman race paled\r\nbefore the remembrance of the slaughter at Hastings, and the harried\r\nvillages of Yorkshire. No prevision, indeed, of the mighty outcome of\r\nhis work could have answered the Conqueror’s anxiety for the welfare of\r\nhis soul, and under the spur of ambition he had taken a path which led\r\nto results beyond his own intention and understanding. We need not\r\nbelieve that the bishop of Lisieux or the abbot of Jumièges have\r\ntampered with William’s words, when we read his repentance for the\r\nevents which have given him his place in history.\r\n\r\nIt remained for the Conqueror to dispose of his inheritance, and here\r\nfor once political expediency had to yield to popular sentiment. We\r\ncannot but believe that the Conqueror, had it been in his power, would\r\nhave made some effort to preserve the political union of England and\r\nNormandy. But fate had struck him down without warning, and ruled that\r\nhis work should be undone for a while. With grim forebodings of evil\r\nWilliam acknowledged that the right of the first-born, and the homage\r\ndone by the Norman barons to Robert more than twenty years before, made\r\nit impossible to disinherit the graceless exile, but England at least\r\nshould pass into stronger hands. William Rufus was destined to a brief\r\nand stormy tenure of his island realm, but its bestowal now was the\r\nreward of constant faithfulness and good service to his mighty father.\r\nTo the English-born Henry, who was to be left landless, the Conqueror\r\nbequeathed five thousand pounds of silver from his treasury, and, in\r\nanswer to his complaint that wealth to him would be useless without\r\nland, prophesied the future reunion of the Anglo-Norman states under his\r\nrule. And then, while Henry busied himself to secure and weigh his\r\ntreasure, the Conqueror gave to William the regalia of the English\r\nmonarchy, and sealed a letter recommending him to Archbishop Lanfranc as\r\nthe future king, and kissing him gave him his blessing, and directed him\r\nto hasten to England before men there knew that their lord was dead.\r\n\r\nIn his few remaining hours King William was inspired by the priests and\r\nnobles who stood around his bed to make reparation to certain victims of\r\nhis policy, who still survived in Norman prisons. Among those who were\r\nnow released at his command were Wulfnoth, Earl Godwine’s son, and Wulf\r\nthe son of King Harold; the prisoners of Ely, Earl Morcar and Siward\r\nBarn; Earl Roger of Hereford, and a certain Englishman named Algar. Like\r\nghosts from another world these men came out into the light for a little\r\ntime before they vanished finally into the dungeons of William Rufus;\r\nbut there was one state prisoner whose pardon, extorted reluctantly from\r\nthe Conqueror, was not reversed by his successor. It was only the\r\nspecial intercession of Count Robert of Mortain which procured the\r\nrelease of his brother, Bishop Odo. The bishop had outdone the Conqueror\r\nin oppression and cruelty to the people of England, and regret for his\r\nown sins of ambition and wrong had not disposed the king for leniency\r\ntowards his brother’s guilt in this regard. At length in sheer weariness\r\nhe yielded against his will, foretelling that the release of Odo would\r\nbring ruin and death upon many.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with Bishop Odo’s liberation that Orderic relates\r\nthe last recorded act of William’s life. A certain knight named Baudri\r\nde Guitry, who had done good service in the war of Sainte-Suzanne, had\r\nsubsequently offended the king by leaving Normandy without his license\r\nto fight against the Moors in Spain. His lands had been confiscated in\r\nconsequence, but were now restored to him, William remarking that he\r\nthought no braver knight existed anywhere, only he was extravagant and\r\ninconstant, and loved to wander in foreign countries. Baudri was a\r\nneighbour and friend to the monks of St. Evroul, hence no doubt the\r\ninterest which his restoration possessed for Ordericus Vitalis.\r\n\r\nIn the final stage of King William’s sickness, the extremity of his pain\r\nabated somewhat, and he slept peacefully through the night of Wednesday\r\nthe 8th of September. As dawn was breaking he woke, and at the same\r\nmoment the great bell of Rouen cathedral rang out from the valley below\r\nSaint-Gervase’s priory. The king asked what it meant; those who were\r\nwatching by him replied, “My lord, the bell is tolling for primes at St.\r\nMary’s church.” Then the Conqueror, raising his hands, exclaimed: “To\r\nMary, the holy mother of God, I commend myself, that by her blessed\r\nintercession I may be reconciled to her beloved Son, our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist.” The next instant he was dead.\r\n\r\nFor close upon six weeks the king had lain helpless in his chamber in\r\nthe priory, but death had come upon him suddenly at last, and the\r\ncompany which had surrounded him instantly scattered in dismay. Each man\r\nknew that for many miles around Rouen there would be little security for\r\nlife or property that day, and the dead king was left at the mercy of\r\nhis own servants, while his friends rode hard to reach their homes\r\nbefore the great news had spread from the city to the open country. By\r\nthe time that the clergy of Rouen had roused themselves to take order\r\nhow their lord might be worthily buried, his body had been stripped, his\r\nchamber dismantled, and his attendants were dispersed, securing the\r\nplunder which they had taken. The archbishop of Rouen directed that the\r\nking should be carried to the church of his own foundation at Caen, but\r\nno man of rank had been left in the city, and it was only an upland\r\nknight, named Herlwin, who accompanied the Conqueror on his last\r\nprogress over his duchy. By river and road the body was brought to Caen,\r\nand a procession of clergy and townsfolk was advancing to meet it, when\r\nsuddenly a burst of flame was seen arising from the town. The citizens,\r\nwho knew well what this meant among their narrow streets and wooden\r\nhouses, rushed back to crush the fire, while the monks of Saint\r\nStephen’s received the king’s body and brought it with such honour as\r\nthey might to their house outside the walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ENGLAND\r\n  In 1087]\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, the Conqueror was buried in the presence of nearly\r\nall the prelates of the Norman church. The bishop of Evreux, who had\r\nwatched by the king’s death-bed, preached, praising him for the renown\r\nwhich his victories had brought upon his race, and for the strictness of\r\nhis justice in the lands over which he ruled. But a strange scene then\r\ninterrupted the course of the ceremony. A certain Ascelin, the son of\r\nArthur, came forward and loudly declared that the place in which the\r\ngrave had been prepared had been the court-yard of his father’s house,\r\nunjustly seized by the dead man for the foundation of his abbey. Ascelin\r\nclamoured for restitution, and the bishops and other magnates drew him\r\napart, and, when satisfied that his claim was just, paid him sixty\r\nshillings for the ground where the grave was. And then, with broken\r\nrites, the Conqueror was laid between the choir and the altar of Saint\r\nStephen’s church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denier of Philip I. of France]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  Ordericus Vitalis, ii., 290.\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  Ordericus Vitalis, ii., 259.\r\n\r\nFootnote 266:\r\n\r\n  Charter of King Philip to St. Quentin, Gallia Christ; X.

But the subject has a unity of its own, quite apart\r\nfrom its bearing upon the course of war or diplomacy, and no aspect of\r\nthe Conqueror’s work is known to us in greater detail. It may be added\r\nthat no aspect of the Conqueror’s work is more illustrative of the\r\ngeneral character of his government, nor of greater significance for the\r\nfuture history. For four centuries and a half the development of the\r\nchurch in England followed the lines which he had indicated.[287]\r\n\r\nBut the church in Normandy was William’s first concern, and some\r\nappreciation of his work here is necessary to an understanding of the\r\ntendencies which governed his ecclesiastical policy in England. Broadly\r\nstated, William’s relations with the church in Normandy and England\r\nalike were governed by two main ideas. He was beyond all doubt sincerely\r\nanxious for the reform of the church, as he would have understood the\r\nphrase—the extension and stricter observance of the monastic life, the\r\nimprovement of the learning and morals of the secular clergy, the\r\ndevelopment of a specific ecclesiastical law. But he was no less\r\ndetermined that, at all hazards, the church in his dominions should be\r\nsubordinate to the state, and his enforcement of this principle\r\nultimately threw him into opposition to the very party in the church\r\nwhich was most sympathetic to his plans of ecclesiastical reform.\r\nBetween Hildebrand claiming in definite words that the head of the\r\nchurch was the lord of the world, and William asserting in unmistakable\r\nacts that the king of England was over all persons in all causes, as\r\nwell ecclesiastical as temporal, through his dominions supreme, there\r\nwere certain to be differences of opinion. But the two great men kept\r\nthe peace for a surprising length of time, and it was not until ten\r\nyears before William’s death that serious discord arose between him and\r\nthe Curia in regard to the question of church government.\r\n\r\nIn this matter, indeed, William was but maintaining prerogatives which\r\nhe had inherited from his predecessors, and which were simultaneously\r\nbeing vindicated by the other princes of his time. We have already\r\nremarked on the intimate connection of church and state which prevailed\r\nin Normandy at the beginning of the eleventh century, in relation to its\r\nbearing upon the general absolutism enjoyed by the duke. But the fact\r\nhas a wider significance as governing the whole character of\r\necclesiastical life in the duchy. The rights of patronage which the duke\r\npossessed, his intervention in the process of ecclesiastical\r\nlegislation, his power of deposing prelates who had fallen under his\r\ndispleasure, not only forbade the autonomy of the church, they made its\r\nspiritual welfare as well as its professional efficiency essentially\r\ndependent upon the personal character of its secular head. Under these\r\nconditions, there was scanty room for the growth of ultramontane ideas\r\namong the Norman clergy; and such influence as the papacy exercised in\r\nNormandy before 1066 at least was due much more to traditional reverence\r\nfor the Holy See, and to occasional respect for the character of its\r\nindividual occupants, than to any recognition of the legal sovereignty\r\nof the Pope in spiritual matters. William himself in the matter of his\r\nmarriage had defied the papacy, and the denunciations of the Curia found\r\nbut a faint response among the prelates of the Norman church.\r\n\r\nFrom the ultramontane point of view this dependence of the church upon\r\nthe state was a gross evil, but it was at least an evil which produced\r\nits own compensation in Normandy. The chaos which had attended the\r\nsettlement of the Northmen in the tenth century had involved the whole\r\necclesiastical organisation of the land in utter ruin, and its\r\nrestoration was entirely due to the initiative taken by the secular\r\npower. The successive dukes of Normandy, from Richard I. onward, showed\r\nastonishing zeal in the work of ecclesiastical reform.[288] Their zeal,\r\nhowever, must have spent itself in vain if their success had been\r\ndependent upon the co-operation of the Norman clergy; the decay of the\r\nchurch in Normandy had gone too far to permit of its being reformed from\r\nwithin. The reforming energy which makes the eleventh century a\r\nbrilliant period in French ecclesiastical history was concentrated at\r\nthis time in the great abbeys of Flanders and Burgundy, whose inmates,\r\nhowever, were fully competent, and for the most part willing, to\r\nundertake the restoration of ecclesiastical order in Normandy. From this\r\nquarter, and in particular from the abbey of Cluny, monks were imported\r\ninto the duchy by Dukes Richard I. and II., and under their guidance the\r\nreform of the Norman church was undertaken according to the highest\r\nmonastic ideal of the time. Very gradually, but with ever increasing\r\nstrength, the influence of the foreign reformers gained more and more\r\ncontrol over every rank in the Norman hierarchy. The higher clergy, who\r\nat first resisted the movement, became transformed into its champions as\r\nthe result of the judicious appointments made by successive dukes. Even\r\nthe upland clergy, whose invincible ignorance had aroused the anger of\r\nthe earliest reformers, were attracted within the scope of the reform,\r\npartly by means of the affiliation of village churches to monasteries,\r\nbut above all through the educational work performed by the schools\r\nwhich were among the first fruits of the monastic revival.\r\n\r\nIf the foundation of new monasteries may be taken as evidence, the\r\nprocess of expansion and reform went on unchecked throughout the stormy\r\nminority of William the Conqueror. A period of feudal anarchy was not\r\nnecessarily inimical to the ultimate interests of the church. Amid the\r\ndisorder and oppression of secular life the church might still display\r\nthe example of a society founded on law and discipline, it might in\r\nnumberless individual cases protect the weak from gratuitous injury, and\r\nit certainly might hope to emerge from the chaos with wider influence\r\nand augmented revenues. The average baron was very willing to atone for\r\nhis misdeeds by the foundation of a new religious house, or by\r\nbenefactions to an old one, and the immortal church had time on its\r\nside. In Normandy, at least, the disorder of William’s minority\r\ncoincided with the foundation of new monasteries in almost every diocese\r\nin the Norman church; and the promulgation of the Truce of God in 1042\r\ngave a wide extension to the competence of ecclesiastical jurisdiction\r\nin relation to secular affairs.\r\n\r\nWith William’s victory at Val-es-dunes, the crisis was over, and for the\r\nnext forty years the Norman church sailed in smooth waters. Autocratic\r\nas was William by temperament, nothing contributed more greatly to his\r\nsuccess than his singular wisdom in the choice of his ministers in\r\nchurch and state, and his power of attaching them to his service by ties\r\nof personal friendship to himself. The relations between William and\r\nLanfranc form perhaps the greatest case in point, but there were other\r\nand less famous members of the Norman hierarchy who stood on terms of\r\npersonal intimacy with their master. And William was cosmopolitan in his\r\nsympathies. Men of learning and piety from every part of Christendom\r\nwere entrusted by him with responsible positions in the Norman church;\r\nin 1066 nearly all the greater abbeys of Normandy were ruled by foreign\r\nmonks. Cosmopolitanism was the chief note of medieval culture, and under\r\nthese influences a real revival of learning may be traced in Normandy.\r\nIt is well for William’s memory that this was so; but for the work of\r\nWilliam of Poitiers and William of Jumièges, two typical representatives\r\nof the new learning, posterity would have remained in blank ignorance of\r\nthe Conqueror’s rule in Normandy. But it is a matter of still greater\r\nimportance that in this way Normandy was gradually becoming prepared to\r\nbe the educator of England, as well as her conqueror. The surviving\r\nrelics of the literary activity at this time of Normandy—mass books,\r\ntheological treatises, and books of miracles, which it produced—have but\r\nlittle interest for the general student of history, but the important\r\npoint is that they are symptoms of an intellectual life manifesting\r\nitself with vigour in the only directions which were possible to it in\r\nthe early eleventh century. Not until it had been transplanted to the\r\nconquered soil of England did this intellectual life produce its\r\ngreatest result, the philosophical history of William of Malmesbury, the\r\nlogical narrative of Eadmer, to name only two of its manifestations; but\r\nin matters of culture, as well as in matters of policy and war, the\r\nNorman race was unconsciously equipping itself in these years for its\r\nlater achievement across the Channel.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the English church stood in sore need of some\r\nsuch external influence. The curious blight which seemed to have settled\r\non the secular government of England affected its religious organisation\r\nalso. The English church had never really recovered from the Danish wars\r\nof Alfred’s time. It had been galvanised into fresh activity by the\r\nefforts of Dunstan and his fellow-reformers of the tenth century, but\r\nthe energy they had infused scarcely outlasted their own lives, and in\r\n1066 the church in England compares very unfavourably with the churches\r\nof the continent in all respects. It had become provincial where they\r\nwere catholic; its culture was a feeble echo of the culture of the\r\neighth century, they were striking out new methods of inquiry into the\r\nmysteries of the faith; it was becoming more and more closely\r\nassimilated to the state, they were struggling to emancipate themselves\r\nfrom secular control. There was ample scope in England for the work of a\r\ngreat ecclesiastical reformer, but the increasing secularisation of the\r\nleaders of the church rendered it unlikely that he would come from\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDUCED FACSIMILE OF THE CHARTER OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR\r\nTO HYDE ABBEY]\r\n\r\nEven in 1066 the English church still retained distinct features of the\r\ntribal organisation which it had inherited from the century of the\r\nconversion. Its dioceses in general represented Heptarchic kingdoms, and\r\nthe uncertainty of their boundaries is here and there definitely\r\ntraceable to the uncertain limits of the primitive tribes of which, they\r\nwere the ecclesiastical equivalents. The residences of half the English\r\nbishops of the eleventh century were still fixed, like those of their\r\nseventh-century predecessors, in remote villages; “places of retirement\r\nrather than centres of activity,” as they have well been called. The\r\nnumber of dioceses was very small in proportion to the population and\r\narea of the land, and it tended to decrease; Edward the Confessor had\r\nrecently united the sees of Cornwall and Devon, under the single bishop\r\nof Exeter. Within his diocese each bishop enjoyed an independence of\r\narchiepiscopal supervision, the like of which was unknown to his\r\ncontinental fellows; the canonical authority of the archbishops was in\r\nabeyance, and in 1070 it was still an open question whether the sees of\r\nDorchester, Lichfield, and Worcester, which represented nearly a third\r\nof England, belonged to the province of Canterbury or of York. The\r\nsmaller territorial units of ecclesiastical government, the archdeaconry\r\nand rural deanery, are hardly to be traced in England before the\r\nConquest, and the chapters in the several dioceses varied indefinitely\r\nin point of organisation.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessarily an abuse that the right of making appointments to\r\nthe higher ecclesiastical offices belonged in England to the king and\r\nthe Witanagemot; it was another matter that the leaders of the church\r\nwere becoming more and more absorbed in secular business. A\r\nrepresentative bishop of King Edward’s day would be a vigorous\r\npolitician and man of affairs. Ealdred, archbishop of York, was sent by\r\nthe king into Germany to negotiate for the return of Edgar the Etheling;\r\nLyfing of Worcester earned the title of the “eloquent” through the part\r\nhe played in the debates of the Witanagemot; Leofgar of Hereford, a\r\nmilitant person who caused grave scandal by continuing to wear his\r\nmoustaches after his ordination, conducted campaigns against the Welsh.\r\nIn Normandy, this type of prelate was rapidly becoming extinct; Odo of\r\nBayeux and Geoffrey of Coutances stand out glaringly among their\r\ncolleagues in 1066; but in England the circumstances of the time\r\ndemanded the increasing participation of the higher clergy in state\r\naffairs. The rivalry of the great earls at Edward’s court produced, as\r\nit were, a barbarous anticipation of party government, and during the\r\nlong ascendancy of the house of Godwine, ecclesiastical dignities were\r\nnaturally bestowed on men who could make themselves politically useful\r\nto their patron. Curiously enough, the one force which operated to check\r\nthe secularisation of the English episcopate was the personal character\r\nof King Edward. His foreign tendencies found full play here, and the\r\nalien clerks of his chapel whom he appointed to bishoprics came to form\r\na distinct group, to which may be traced the beginnings of\r\necclesiastical reform in England. For a short time the highest office in\r\nthe English church was held, in the person of the unlucky Robert of\r\nJumièges, by a Norman monk in close touch with the Cluniac school of\r\necclesiastical reformers, who seems to have tried, during his brief\r\nperiod of rule, to raise the standard of learning among the clergy of\r\nhis diocese. Robert fell before he could do much in this direction, but\r\nthe foreign influences which were beginning to play upon the English\r\nchurch did not cease with his expulsion. Here and there, during Edward’s\r\nlater years, native prelates were to be found who recognised that much\r\nwas amiss with the church, and followed foreign models in their attempts\r\nat reform; Ealdred of York tried to impose the strict rule of Chrodegang\r\nof Metz upon his canons of York, Ripon, Beverley, and Southwell, the\r\nfour greatest churches of Northern England. But individual bishops could\r\nnot go far enough in the work of reform, and their efforts seem to have\r\nmet with little sympathy from the majority of their colleagues.\r\n\r\nTo a foreign observer, nothing in the English church would seem more\r\nanomalous than the character of its ecclesiastical jurisdiction. There\r\nexisted, indeed, in the law books of successive kings, a vast mass of\r\necclesiastical law; it was in the administration of this law that\r\nEngland parted company with continental usage. In England the bishop\r\nwith the earl presided over the assembly of thegns, freemen, and priests\r\nwhich constituted the shire court, and the local courts of shire and\r\nhundred had a wide competence over matters which, on the continent,\r\nwould have been referred to a specifically ecclesiastical tribunal. The\r\nbishop seems to have possessed an exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\nprofessional misdoings of his clergy, and the degradation of a criminous\r\nclerk, the necessary preliminary to his punishment by the lay authority,\r\nwas pronounced by clerical judges, but all other matters of\r\necclesiastical interest fell within the province of the local\r\nassemblies. Ecclesiastical and secular laws were promulgated by the same\r\nauthority and administered by the same courts, nor does the church as a\r\nwhole seem to have possessed any organ by means of which collective\r\nopinion might be given upon matters of general importance. No great\r\ncouncils of the church, such as those of which Bede tells us, can be\r\ntraced in the Confessor’s reign, nor, indeed, for nearly two centuries\r\nbefore his accession. The church council had been absorbed by the\r\nWitanagemot.\r\n\r\nTo all the greater movements which were agitating the religious life of\r\nthe continent in the eleventh century—the Cluniac revival, the\r\nhierarchical claims of the papacy—the English church as a whole remained\r\nserenely oblivious. Its relations with the papacy were naturally very\r\nintermittent, and when a native prelate visited the Holy See, he might\r\nexpect to hear strong words about plurality and simony from the Pope.\r\nWith Stigand the papacy could hold no intercourse, but, despite all the\r\nfulminations of successive Popes, Stigand continued for eighteen years\r\nto draw the revenues of his sees of Canterbury and Winchester, and other\r\nprelates rivalled him in his offences of plurality, whatever scruples\r\nthey might feel about his canonical position as archbishop. Ealdred of\r\nYork had once administered three bishoprics and an abbey at the same\r\ntime. The ecclesiastical misdemeanours of a party among the higher\r\nclergy would have been a minor evil, had it not coincided with the\r\ngeneral abeyance of learning and efficiency among their subordinates. We\r\nknow very little about the parish priest of the Confessor’s day, but\r\nwhat is known does not dispose us to regard him as an instrument of much\r\nvalue for the civilisation of his neighbours. In the great majority of\r\ncases, he seems to have been a rustic, married like his parishioners,\r\njoining with them in the agricultural work of the village, and differing\r\nfrom them only in the fact of his ordination, and in possessing such a\r\nknowledge of the rudiments of Latin as would enable him to recite the\r\nservices of the church. The energy with which the bishops who followed\r\nthe Conquest laboured for the elevation of the lower clergy is\r\nsufficiently significant of what their former condition must have been.\r\nThe measures which were taken to this end by the foreign reformers—the\r\ngeneral enforcement of celibacy, for example—may not commend themselves\r\nto modern opinion, but Lanfranc and his colleagues knew where the root\r\nof the matter lay. It was only by making the church distinct from the\r\nstate, by making the parish priest a being separated by the clearest\r\ndistinctions from his lay brother, that the church could begin to\r\nexercise its rightful influence upon the secular life of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GAMEL SON OF ORME’S SUNDIAL\r\n  FROM A SHORT ACCOUNT OF SAINT GREGORY’S MINSTER, KIRKDALE, BY REV. F.\r\n    W. POWELL, VICAR. THE TRANSLATION IS AS FOLLOWS:]\r\n\r\n“ORM GAMAL’S SON BOUGHT S. GREGORY’S MINSTER WHEN IT WAS ALL BROKEN DOWN\r\nAND FALLEN AND HE LET IT BE MADE ANEW FROM THE GROUND TO CHRIST AND S.\r\nGREGORY, IN EDWARD’S DAYS, THE KING, AND IN TOSTI’S DAYS, THE EARL.”\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL PANEL HAS ON THE DIAL—\r\n                “THIS IS DAY’S SUN MARKER\r\n                      AT EVERY TIME.”\r\nAND AT THE FOOT—\r\n                “AND HAWARTH ME WROUGHT AND BRAND, PRIESTS”\r\n\r\nPolitical circumstances delayed the beginnings of ecclesiastical reform\r\nfor more than three years after the battle of Hastings had placed the\r\ndestinies of the English church in Norman hands. While the Conqueror was\r\nfighting at Stafford and York, he could not be presiding over synods at\r\nWinchester and London. No steps, therefore, were taken in this question\r\nbefore 1070, when the fall of Chester destroyed the last chance of a\r\nsuccessful English rising, and made it no longer expedient for William\r\nto be complaisant to Stigand and the nationalist party in the English\r\nepiscopate. But in 1070 the work was begun in earnest under the\r\nimmediate sanction of the Pope, expressed in the legation of two\r\ncardinal priests who visited England in that year. There could be little\r\ndoubt what their first step would be; and when Stigand was formally\r\narraigned for holding the sees of Winchester and Canterbury in\r\nplurality, usurping the pallium of his predecessor, Robert, and\r\nreceiving his own pallium from the schismatic Benedict X., he had no\r\ndefence to offer beyond declamation against the good faith of the king.\r\nThree other bishops fell at or about the same time; Ethelmer, brother of\r\nStigand, and bishop of East Anglia, Ethelwine, bishop of Durham, and\r\nEthelric, bishop of Selsey. In regard to none of these last bishops are\r\nthe grounds on which their deposition was based at all certain; and in\r\nthe case of Ethelric, an aged man who was famed for his vast knowledge\r\nof Anglo-Saxon law, the Pope himself was uneasy about the point, and a\r\ncorrespondence went on for some time between him and Lanfranc on the\r\nsubject. But it is a noteworthy fact that these four prelates are the\r\nonly bishops deposed during the whole of the Conqueror’s reign. Nothing\r\nwas further from William’s purpose than any wholesale clearance of the\r\nnative episcopate. He was King Edward’s heir, and he wished, therefore,\r\nto retain King Edward’s bishops in office, so far as this was consistent\r\nwith the designs of his ally the Pope. On the other hand, William was no\r\nless determined to fill all vacancies when they occurred in the course\r\nof nature with continental priests. Herein he and the Pope were in\r\ncomplete harmony. It was only by this means that continental culture and\r\nideas of church government could be introduced into England, and William\r\ntrusted in his own strength to repress any inconvenient tendencies which\r\nmight arise from the ultramontane ideals of his nominees.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of Stigand meant the elevation of Lanfranc to the\r\narchbishopric of Canterbury. It is probable that the Pope would have\r\npreferred to attach him to the College of Cardinals, but William was\r\ndetermined to place his old friend at the head of the English church,\r\nand Alexander II. gave way. York, vacant through the death of Ealdred in\r\n1069, was given to Thomas, treasurer of Bayeux, _protégé_ of Odo, bishop\r\nof that see, and a man of vast and cosmopolitan learning. Almost\r\nimmediately after his appointment a fierce dispute broke out between him\r\nand Lanfranc. The dispute in question was twofold—partly referring to\r\nthe boundaries of the two provinces, but also raising the more important\r\nquestion whether the two English archbishops should possess co-ordinate\r\nrank or whether the archbishop of York should be compelled to take an\r\noath of obedience to the primate of Canterbury. In a council held at\r\nWinchester in 1072 both questions were settled in favour of Canterbury.\r\nThe dioceses of Lichfield, Worcester, and Dorchester were assigned to\r\nthe latter provinces, and Lanfranc—partly by arousing William’s fears as\r\nto the political inexpediency of an independent archbishop of York,\r\npartly by the skilful forgery of relevant documents—brought it about\r\nthat the northern archbishopric was formally declared subordinate to\r\nthat of Canterbury. In ecclesiastical, as well as secular matters,\r\nWilliam had small respect for the particularism of Northumbria.\r\n\r\nThe council which decided this matter was only one of a series of\r\nsimilar assemblies convened during the archiepiscopate of Lanfranc. The\r\nfirst of the series had already been held in 1070, when Wulfstan, the\r\nunlearned but saintly bishop of Worcester, was arraigned _pro defectu\r\nscientiæ_. He was saved from imminent deposition partly by his piety,\r\npartly by his frank and early acceptance of the Norman rule; and he\r\nretained his see until his death in 1094. In 1075 the third council of\r\nthe series proceeded to deal with one of the greatest anomalies\r\npresented by the English church, and raised the whole question of\r\nepiscopal residence. In accordance with its decrees, the see of\r\nLichfield was translated to Chester, that of Selsey to Chichester, and\r\nthat of Sherborne to Old Salisbury. Shortly afterwards, the seat of the\r\neast midland diocese of Dorchester was transferred to Lincoln; and in\r\n1078 Bishop Herbert of Elmham, after an abortive attempt to gain\r\npossession of Bury St. Edmund’s, removed his residence to Thetford, the\r\nsecond town in Norfolk. In all these changes the attempt was made to\r\nfollow the continental practice by which a bishop would normally reside\r\nin the chief town of his diocese. But new episcopal seats implied new\r\ncathedral churches, and the Conqueror’s reign witnessed a notable\r\naugmentation of church revenues,[289] expressed in grants of land, the\r\nextent of which can be ascertained from the evidence of Domesday Book.\r\nHere and there are traces of a reorganisation of church property, and of\r\nits appropriation to special purposes; all of which enabled the new\r\nbishops to support the strain incurred by their great building\r\nactivities. By 1087 new cathedrals had been begun in seven out of\r\nfifteen dioceses.\r\n\r\nThe church councils which supplied the means through which the king and\r\nprimate carried their ideas of ecclesiastical reform into effect were\r\nbodies of a somewhat anomalous constitution. In the Confessor’s day the\r\nWitanagemot had treated indifferently of sacred and secular law, but its\r\ncompetence in religious matters did not descend unbroken to its feudal\r\nrepresentative, the Commune Concilium. In the Conqueror’s reign the\r\nchurch council is becoming differentiated from the assembly of lay\r\nbarons, but the process is not yet complete. The session of the church\r\ncouncil would normally coincide in point of place and time with a\r\nmeeting of the Commune Concilium; no ecclesiastical decree was valid\r\nuntil it had received the king’s sanction, and the king and his lay\r\nbarons joined the assembly, although they took no active part in its\r\ndeliberations. There was, indeed, small necessity for their presence,\r\nand in two of the more important councils of William’s reign, at London\r\nin 1075 and at Gloucester in 1085 the spiritualty held a session of\r\ntheir own apart from the meeting of the Commune Concilium. In any case\r\nthe spiritual decrees were promulgated upon the authority of the\r\narchbishop and prelates, although the royal word was necessary for their\r\nreception as law.\r\n\r\nNo piece of ecclesiastical legislation passed during this time had wider\r\nconsequences than the famous decree which limited the competence of the\r\nshire and hundred courts in regard to matters pertaining to\r\nreligion.[290] This law has only come down to us in the form of a royal\r\nwrit addressed to the officers and men of the shire court, so that its\r\nexact date is uncertain. But intrinsically it is likely enough that the\r\nquestion of ecclesiastical jurisdiction would be one of the first\r\nmatters to which William and Lanfranc would turn their hands, and the\r\nprinciple implied in the writ had already been recognised by all the\r\nstates of the continent. According to this document no person of\r\necclesiastical status might be tried before the hundred court, nor might\r\nthis assembly any longer possess jurisdiction over cases involving\r\nquestions of spiritual law, even when laymen were the parties concerned.\r\nAll these matters were reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\nbishops and their archdeacons, and in this way room was prepared in\r\nEngland for the reception of the canon law of the church.[291] Important\r\nas it was for the subsequent fortunes of the church, this decree was\r\nperhaps of even greater importance for its influence upon the\r\ndevelopment of secular law. The canons of the church, in the shape which\r\nthey assumed at the hands of Gratian in the next generation, were to set\r\nbefore lay legislators the example of a codified body of law, aiming at\r\nlogical consistency and inherent reason; a body very different from the\r\ncollection of isolated enactments which the English church of the\r\neleventh century inherited from the Witanagemots of Alfred and Edgar. We\r\ncannot here trace the way in which the efforts of the great doctors of\r\nthe canon law were to react upon the work of their secular\r\ncontemporaries; but the fact of such influence is certain, and the next\r\ncentury witnessed its abundant manifestation.\r\n\r\nThe transference of ecclesiastical causes from the sphere of the folk\r\nlaw to that of the canons of the church meant that the Pope would in\r\ntime acquire, in fact, what no doubt he would already claim in\r\ntheory—the legal sovereignty of the church in England. That William\r\nrecognised this is certain, and he was determined that the fact should\r\nin no way invalidate the ecclesiastical prerogatives which he already\r\nenjoyed in Normandy, and which in regard to England he claimed as King\r\nEdward’s heir. Contemporary churchmen say this too, and the key to\r\nWilliam’s relations with the Pope is given in the three resolutions\r\nwhich Eadmer in the next generation ascribes to him. No Pope should be\r\nrecognised in England, no papal letters should be received, and no\r\ntenant-in-chief excommunicated without his consent. In short, William\r\nwas prepared to make concessions to the ecclesiastical ideas of his\r\nclerical friends only in so far as they might tend to the more efficient\r\ndischarge by the church of its spiritual function. This was, of course,\r\na compromise, and no very satisfactory one; it led immediately to\r\nstrained relations between William himself and Hildebrand, it was the\r\ndirect cause of the quarrel between William Rufus and Anselm, and it was\r\nindirectly responsible for the greater struggle which raged between\r\nHenry of Anjou and Becket. On one point, however, king and papacy were\r\nin perfect accord, and it was this fact which prevented their difference\r\nof opinion upon higher matters of ecclesiastical policy from becoming\r\nacute during the Conqueror’s lifetime. Both parties were agreed upon the\r\nimperative necessity of reforming the mass of the English clergy in\r\nmorals and learning, and here at least the Conqueror’s work was\r\npermanent and consonant with the strictest ecclesiastical ideas of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that to the men of the eleventh century,\r\necclesiastical reform implied the general enforcement of clerical\r\ncelibacy. The Winchester Council of 1072 had issued a decree against\r\nunchaste clerks, but the matter was not taken up in detail for four\r\nyears more, and the settlement which was then arrived at was much more\r\nlenient to the adherents of the old order than might have been expected.\r\nIt made a distinction between the two classes of the secular clergy. All\r\nclerks who were members of any religious establishment, whether a\r\ncathedral chapter, or college of secular canons, were to live celibate\r\nfor the future. The treatment applied to the upland clergy was summary.\r\nIt would have been a hopeless task to force the celibate life upon the\r\nwhole parochial clergy of England, but steps could be taken to secure\r\nthat the married priest would become an extinct species in the course of\r\nthe next generation. Accordingly, parish priests who were married at the\r\ntime might continue to live with their wives, but all subsequent\r\nclerical marriage was absolutely forbidden, and the bishops were\r\nenjoined to ordain no man who had not previously made definite\r\nprofession of celibacy. In all this Lanfranc was evidently anxious to\r\npass no decree which could not be carried into immediate execution, even\r\nif this policy involved inevitable delay before the English clergy in\r\nthis great respect were brought into line with their continental\r\nbrethren. The next century had well begun before the native clergy as a\r\nwhole had been reduced to acceptance of the celibate rule.\r\n\r\nThe monastic revival which followed the Conquest told in the same\r\ndirection. In the mere foundation of religious houses, the Conqueror’s\r\nreign cannot claim a high place. Such monasteries as derive their origin\r\nfrom this period were for the most part affiliated to some continental\r\nestablishment. The Conqueror’s own abbey of St. Martin of the Place of\r\nBattle was founded as a colony from Marmoutier, though it soon won\r\ncomplete autonomy from the jurisdiction of the parent house. It was a\r\nnoteworthy event when in 1076 William de Warenne founded at Lewes the\r\nfirst Cluniac priory in England, although it does not appear that any\r\nother house of this order had arisen in this country before 1087. In\r\nmonastic history the interest of the Conqueror’s reign centres round the\r\nold independent Benedictine monasteries of England, and their reform\r\nunder the administration of abbots imported from the continent. Here\r\nthere was much work to be done; not only in regard to the tightening of\r\nmonastic discipline, but also in the accommodation of these ancient\r\nhouses, with their wide lands and large dependent populations, to the\r\nnew conditions of society which were the result of the Conquest. Knight\r\nservice had to be provided for; the property of the monastery had to be\r\norganised to enable it to bear the secular burdens which the Conqueror’s\r\npolicy imposed; foreign abbots were at times glad to rely upon the legal\r\nknowledge which native monks could bring to bear upon the intricacies of\r\nthe prevailing system of land tenure. The Conqueror’s abbots were often\r\nmen of affairs, rather than saints; their work was here and there\r\nmisunderstood by the monks over whom they ruled, yet it cannot be\r\ndoubted that a stricter discipline, a more efficient discharge of\r\nmonastic offices, a higher conception of monastic life, were the results\r\nof their government.\r\n\r\nThe influence of their work was not confined within monastic walls. In\r\nthe more accurate differentiation of monastic duties which they\r\nintroduced, they were not unmindful of the claims of the monastery\r\nschool. Very gradually the schools of such houses as St. Albans and\r\nMalmesbury came to affect the mass of the native clergy. And the process\r\nwas quickened by the control which the monasteries possessed over a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the parish churches of the country. The grant\r\nof a village to an abbey meant that its church would be served by a\r\npriest appointed by the abbot, and in Norman times no baron would found\r\na religious house without granting to it a number of the churches\r\nsituate upon his fief. Already in 1066 the several monasteries of\r\nEngland possessed a large amount of patronage; and the Norman abbots of\r\nthe eleventh and twelfth centuries were not slow to employ the influence\r\nthey possessed in this way for the elevation of the native clergy.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is another side to this picture. In the little world of\r\nthe monastery, as in the wide world of the state, it was the character\r\nof the ruling man which determined whether the ascendancy of continental\r\nideas should make for good or evil. The autocracy of the abbot might\r\nupon occasion degenerate into sheer tyranny: there is the classical\r\ninstance of Thurstan of Glastonbury, who turned a body of men-at-arms\r\nupon his monks because they resisted his introduction of the Ambrosian\r\nmethod of chanting the services.[292] It was an easy matter for an abbot\r\nto use the lands of his church as a means of providing for his needy\r\nkinsmen in Normandy[293]; the pious founder in the next generation would\r\noften explicitly guard against the unnecessary creation of knights’ fees\r\non the monastic estates. An abbot, careless of his responsibilities,\r\nmight neglect to provide for the service of the village churches\r\naffiliated to his house; and it would be difficult to call him to\r\naccount for this. But, judging from the evidence which we possess, we\r\ncan only conclude that the church in England did actually escape most of\r\nthe evils which might have resulted from the superposition of a new\r\nspiritual aristocracy. The bad cases of which we have information are\r\nvery clearly exceptions, thrown into especial prominence on this very\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nAnd against the dangers we have just indicated we have to set the\r\nundoubted fact that with the Norman Conquest the English church passes\r\nat once from a period of stagnation to a period of exuberant activity.\r\nIn the conduct of the religious life, in learning and architecture, in\r\nall that followed from intimate association with the culture and\r\nspiritual ideals of the continent, the reign of the Conqueror and the\r\nprimacy of Lanfranc fittingly inaugurate the splendid history of the\r\nmedieval church of England. And it is only fair for us to attribute the\r\ncredit for this result in large measure to King William himself. Let it\r\nbe granted that the actual work of reform was done by the bishops and\r\nabbots of England under the guidance of Lanfranc; there will still\r\nremain the fact that the Conqueror chose as his spiritual associates men\r\nwho were both willing and able to carry the work of reform into effect.\r\nNothing would have been easier than for King William, coming in as he\r\ndid by conquest, to treat the English church as the lawful spoils of\r\nwar. Its degradation under the rule of feudal prelates of the type of\r\nGeoffrey of Coutances would have made for, rather than against, his\r\nsecular autocracy. Had he reduced the church to impotence he would have\r\nspared his successors many an evil day. But, confident that he himself\r\nwould always be supreme in church as well as state, he was content to\r\nentrust its guidance to the best and strongest men of whom he knew, and\r\nif he foresaw the dangers of the future he left their avoidance to those\r\nwho came after him.\r\n\r\nNo detailed account can be given here of the prelates whom the Conqueror\r\nappointed to ecclesiastical office in England. In point of origin they\r\nwere a very heterogeneous class of men. Some of them were monks from the\r\ngreat abbeys of Normandy; Gundulf of Rochester came from Caen, Remigius\r\nof Dorchester from Fécamp; others, such as Robert of Hereford, were of\r\nLotharingian extraction. Under the Conqueror, as under his successors,\r\nservice at the royal court was a ready road to ecclesiastical promotion;\r\nnor were the clerks of the king’s chapel the least worthy of the new\r\nprelates. Osmund of Salisbury, who attained to ultimate canonisation,\r\nhad been chancellor from 1072 to 1077. But a question immediately\r\npresents itself as to the relations which existed between these foreign\r\nlords of the church and the Englishmen, clerk and lay, over whom they\r\nruled. Learned and zealous they might be, and yet, at the same time,\r\nremain entirely out of touch with the native population of England. To\r\npresuppose this, however, would be a great injustice to the new\r\nprelates. The very diversity of their origin prevented them from sharing\r\nthe racial pride of the lay nobility, and their position as servants of\r\na universal church told in the same direction. They learned the English\r\nlanguage, and some at least among them preached to the country folk in\r\nthe vernacular. They preserved the cult of the native saints, though\r\nthey criticised with good reason the grounds on which certain kings and\r\nprelates had received canonisation, and in most dioceses they retained\r\nwithout modification the forms of ritual which had been developed by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon church. Among all the forces which made for the assimilation\r\nof Englishman to Norman in the century following the Conquest the work\r\nof King William’s bishops and abbots must certainly hold a high place.\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations which had existed between William and the Curia\r\nduring the pontificate of Alexander II. were not interrupted immediately\r\nby the accession of Hildebrand, in 1073, but there soon appeared ominous\r\nsymptoms of coming strife. It was no longer a matter of vital importance\r\nfor William to retain the favour of the papacy—he was now the undisputed\r\nmaster of England and Normandy alike. Hildebrand, a man of genius, in\r\nwhose passionate character an inherent hatred of compromise clashes with\r\na statesmanlike recognition of the demands of practical expediency,\r\ncould not be expected to refrain from advancing the ecclesiastical\r\nclaims to the furtherance of which his whole soul was devoted. The\r\nConqueror had indeed gone far in the work of reform, but neither in\r\nEngland nor in Normandy did he show any intention of conforming to the\r\nHildebrandine conception of the model relationship which should exist\r\nbetween church and state. Of his own will he appointed his bishops and\r\nabbots, and they in turn paid him homage for their temporal possessions;\r\nhe controlled at pleasure the intercourse between his prelates and the\r\nHoly See. Herein lay abundant materials for a quarrel; the wonder is\r\nthat it did not break out for six years after Hildebrand’s succession.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the outbreak was the abstention of the English\r\nand Norman bishops from attendance at the general synods of the church\r\nwhich Hildebrand convened at Rome during these years. Lanfranc was the\r\nchief offender in this respect, but before long Hildebrand came to\r\nrecognise that Lanfranc was only acting in obedience to his master’s\r\norders, and anger at the discovery drove the Pope to take the offensive\r\nagainst his former ally. Lanfranc was peremptorily summoned to Rome; the\r\narchbishop-elect of Rouen, William Bona Anima, was refused the papal\r\nconfirmation, and Archbishop Gebuin of Lyons was given an extraordinary\r\ncommission as primate of the provinces of Rouen, Sens, and Tours; a step\r\nwhich at once destroyed the ecclesiastical autonomy of Normandy.\r\nWilliam’s reply to this attack was characteristic of the man. He was not\r\nwithout personal friends at the papal court, and without yielding his\r\nground in the slightest in regard to the main matter in dispute he\r\ncontrived to pacify the angry Pope by protestations of his unaltered\r\ndevotion to the Holy See. Gregory bided his time; Archbishop Gebuin’s\r\nprimacy came to nothing. William of Rouen received the pallium, and\r\nshortly after these events the Pope is found writing an admonitory\r\nletter to Robert of Normandy, then in exile. The storm had in fact blown\r\nover, but a greater crisis was close at hand.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that Gregory considered that he had won a\r\ndiplomatic victory in the recent correspondence. He had not, it is true,\r\ncarried his main point, but he had drawn from the king of England a\r\nnotable expression of personal respect, and it is possible that this\r\nemboldened him shortly afterwards to make a direct demand upon William’s\r\nallegiance. In the course of 1080, to adopt the most probable date,\r\nGregory sent his legate Hubert to William with a demand that the latter\r\nshould take an oath of fealty to the Pope, and should provide for the\r\nmore punctual payment of the tribute of Peter’s Pence due from England.\r\nIn making the latter demand Hildebrand was only claiming his rights;\r\nfrom ancient time Peter’s Pence had been sent to Rome from England, and\r\nthe Conqueror admitted his obligation in the matter. But the claim of\r\nfealty stood on a different footing. William, indeed, cannot have been\r\nunprepared for it; it was inevitable that sooner or later the papacy\r\nwould endeavour to obtain a recognition, in the sphere of politics, of\r\nits support of the Norman claims on England in 1066. None the less, it\r\nwas entirely inadmissible from William’s standpoint. So far as our\r\nevidence goes, it is certain that William had made no promise of feudal\r\nallegiance in 1066[294]; for him, as indeed for Alexander II., the\r\npapacy had already reaped its reward in the ecclesiastical sphere, in\r\nthe power of initiating the reform of the English church, in the more\r\nintimate connection established between Rome and England. Alexander II.\r\nhad been willing to subordinate all questions of spiritual politics to\r\nthe more pressing needs of ecclesiastical reform, and Gregory had\r\nhitherto followed his predecessor’s lead; nor on the present occasion\r\ndid he do more than assert a claim of the recognition of which he can\r\nhave held but slender hopes. For William repudiated the Pope’s demand\r\noutright, asserting that none of his predecessors had ever sworn fealty\r\nto any former Pope, nor had he ever promised to do the like. We have no\r\ninformation as to the reception which William’s answer met at Rome; but,\r\nwhatever resentment he may have felt, Gregory was debarred by\r\ncircumstances from taking offensive action against the king of England.\r\nIn the very year of this correspondence, Gregory found himself\r\nconfronted by an anti-pope, nominated by the emperor; and from this time\r\nonward, the Pope’s difficulties on the continent increased, up to the\r\nhour of his death in exile five years later. Fortune continued true to\r\nWilliam, even in his ecclesiastical relations.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to trace in detail the history of William’s dealings\r\nwith the church during his last years. In England the work of reform,\r\nwell begun in the previous decade, continued without interruption under\r\nthe guidance of the new prelates. There is some evidence, indeed, that\r\ntowards the close of William’s reign the English clergy were in advance\r\nof their Norman brethren in strictness of life and regard for canonical\r\nrule; at least in 1080, at the Synod of Lillebonne,[295] the king found\r\nit necessary to assume for himself the jurisdiction over the grosser\r\noffences of the clergy, on the ground that the Norman bishops had been\r\nremiss in their prosecution. But in England the leaders of the church\r\nseem to have enjoyed the king’s confidence to the last, and their\r\nreforming zeal needed no royal intervention. The work of Dunstan and\r\nOswald, frustrated at the time by unkind circumstances, had at last,\r\nunder stranger conditions than any they might conceive, reached its\r\nfulfilment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  The ecclesiastical history of Normandy and England in the eleventh\r\n  century is treated by Böhmer, _Kirche und Staat in England, und in der\r\n  Normandie_, on which book this chapter is based.\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  See above, Introduction, ii., pp. 39, 40.\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  Especially in the Danelaw, V.

It demanded rather a strong will in the\r\nsovereign than professional knowledge in his ministers: the\r\nresponsibility was the king’s, and his duty to his subjects was plain\r\nand recognised by all men. No one doubted that the maintenance of order\r\nwas the king’s work, but the method of its performance was left to his\r\ndiscretion. It was not a light task, but it was a task which would be\r\ndone the better the simpler were the agencies employed, the more\r\nimmediately each act of government was felt to be the personal act of\r\nthe head of the state. The time was not ripe for the highly specialised\r\nadministration of Henry II.; it was bound to take more than twenty years\r\nbefore a trained body of administrators could be elaborated out of the\r\ntransplanted Norman baronage, before the king had learned to whom he\r\ncould safely entrust the permanent work of civil government. The\r\nConqueror’s administration was by the nature of the case empirical;\r\nneither Normandy nor England had anything to offer in the way of\r\ncentralised routine, but for all that it is from the simple expedients\r\nadopted by William that the medieval constitution of England takes its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nJust as in Normandy an indefinite body of “optimates” surrounded the\r\nduke, and expected to be consulted on occasions of special importance,\r\nso in England the king’s greater tenants, lay and ecclesiastical, formed\r\na potential council, the “Commune Concilium” of later writers. The\r\nconnection between the council in its English and Norman manifestations\r\nwas something closer than mere similarity of composition; many a man who\r\nwitnessed the coronation of Queen Matilda in the Easter Council of 1068\r\nmust have sat in the assembly at Lillebonne which discussed the invasion\r\nof England; and judging from the evidence of charters the barons who\r\naccompany the king when in Normandy will probably appear as lords of\r\nEnglish fiefs in the pages of Domesday Book. Roger de Montgomery, Henry\r\nde Ferrers, Walter Giffard, Henry de Beaumont—such men as these, who\r\nwere great on either side the Channel, appear in frequent attendance on\r\ntheir lord, whether at Rouen or at Winchester. Their attendance, indeed,\r\nwas a guarantee of good faith; the baron who, when summoned, neglected\r\nto obey, became thereby a suspected person at once: it was considered a\r\nsign of disaffection when Earl Roger of Hereford persistently absented\r\nhimself from William’s court.\r\n\r\nIn England we know that it was customary for the king to hold a great\r\ncouncil thrice in each year. “Moreover” says the Peterborough\r\nchronicler, “he was very worshipful: he wore his crown thrice in every\r\nyear when he was in England. At Easter he wore it at Winchester, at\r\nWhitsuntide at Westminster, at midwinter at Gloucester, and then there\r\nwere with him all the great men of all England—archbishops and bishops,\r\nabbots and earls, thegns and knights”; “in order,” adds William of\r\nMalmesbury, “that ambassadors from foreign countries might admire the\r\nsplendour of the assembly and the costliness of the feasts.” As it is\r\nonly at these great seasons that the Commune Concilium comes practically\r\ninto being; we may give a list of those known to be present at the\r\nEaster feast of 1069 and the Christmas feast of 1077, to which we may\r\nadd a list of those in attendance on the king when he held his Easter\r\nfeast of 1080 in Normandy.[296]\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that an assembly of this kind is eminently unfitted to\r\nbe the organ of systematic government. These great people, bishops,\r\nearls, and abbots, had their own work to do, work which for long periods\r\nkept them away from the king’s presence. The Commune Concilium is at\r\nmost what its name implies, an advisory body. As such it plays the part\r\ntaken in the Anglo-Saxon policy by the “Witan,” and the question arises\r\nwhether it can be considered a continuation of that assembly under\r\naltered conditions and with restricted powers or whether it proceeds\r\nfrom some quite different principle.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the Norman council is in no sense a popular assembly;\r\nwe certainly cannot say of it, as has been said of the “Witan,” that\r\n“every free man had in theory the right to attend.” On the other hand it\r\nis probable that the alleged popular composition of the Witan is\r\nillusory, while the nature of the body which attended Edward the\r\nConfessor might be described equally with the Conqueror’s councils as\r\nconsisting of “archbishops and suffragan bishops, abbots and earls,\r\nthegns and knights.” But it is probable that this similarity of\r\nconstitution is only superficial. If pressed for a definition of the\r\nCommune Concilium we might, perhaps, venture to say that it consisted\r\npotentially of all those men who held in chief of the crown by military\r\nservice, of those _tenentes in capite_ whose estates in Domesday are\r\nentered under separate rubrics. This definition would include the great\r\necclesiastical tenants, while it would exclude the undistinguished crowd\r\nof sergeants (_servientes_) and king’s thegns, and it would suggest one\r\nmost important respect in which the Commune Concilium differs from its\r\nOld English representative. All the members of the Norman council are\r\nunited to the king by the strongest of all ties, the bond of tenure.\r\nThat great change, in virtue of which every acre of land in England has\r\ncome to be held mediately or immediately of the king, influences\r\nconstitutional no less than social relations; the king’s council is a\r\nbody composed of men who are his own tenants. From this technical\r\ndistinction follows a difference of great importance; the king’s\r\ninfluence over his council becomes direct and inevitable to a degree\r\nimpossible before the Conquest. Under Edward the Confessor it is not\r\nimpossible for the Witan to be found going its own way with but scanty\r\nregard to the personal wishes of the king; under the Conqueror and his\r\nsons the king’s will is supreme. Most true is it that the three Norman\r\nkings were men of very different quality from the imbecile Edward; but\r\nnevertheless, the tenurial bond between the king and his barons made it\r\nimpossible for the latter when in council to follow an independent\r\npolitical course. The Norman kings were wise enough to entertain advice\r\nand too strong for that advice ever to pass into dictation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EARLDOMS\r\n  May 1068]\r\n\r\nDistinct then as is the Commune Concilium from the Witan, we\r\nnevertheless meet in the earliest years of William’s reign with certain\r\nassemblies which may fairly be considered as transitional forms between\r\nthe two. Up to the last revolt of Edwin and Morcar not a few Englishmen\r\ncontinued to hold high positions at William’s court; and among the\r\nwitnesses to the few charters of this date which have survived there\r\nstill exists a fair proportion of English names. Such men as Edwin and\r\nMorcar themselves must have represented the independent traditions of\r\nthe Old English Witan, and there are other names which are common to the\r\nlatest charters of King Edward and the earliest charters of King\r\nWilliam. As it is very rarely that we can obtain a glimpse of an\r\nassembly of this intermediate type we may subjoin a list of those in\r\nattendance on the king at or shortly after the Whitsuntide Council of\r\n1069, taken from a charter restoring to the church of Wells lands which\r\nHarold, “inflamed with cupidity,” is said to have appropriated unjustly:\r\n\r\n  King William; Queen Matilda; Stigand, archbishop; Ealdred, archbishop;\r\n  Odo, bishop of Bayeux; Hugh, bishop (of Lisieux); Herman, bishop (of\r\n  Thetford); Leofric, bishop of Exeter; Ethelmer, bishop of Elmham;\r\n  William, bishop of London; Ethelric, bishop of Selsey; Walter, bishop\r\n  of Hereford; Remi, bishop of Lincoln; Ethelnoth, abbot of\r\n  (Glastonbury); Leofweard, abbot of (Michelney); Wulfwold, abbot of\r\n  Chertsey; Wulfgeat, abbot; Earl William; Earl Waltheof; Earl Edwin;\r\n  Robert, the king’s brother; Roger, “princeps”; Walter Giffard; Hugh de\r\n  Montfort; William de Curcelles; Serlo de Burca; Roger de Arundel;\r\n  Richard, the king’s son; Walter the Fleming; Rambriht the Fleming;\r\n  Thurstan; Baldwin “de Wailen leige”; Athelheard; Hermenc; Tofig,\r\n  “minister”; Dinni; “Alfge atte Thorne”; William de Walville; Bundi,\r\n  the Staller; Robert, the Staller; Robert de Ely; Roger “pincerna”;\r\n  Wulfweard; Herding; Adsor; Brisi; Brihtric.[297]\r\n\r\nStarting with the greatest persons in church and state the list\r\ngradually shades off to a number of obscure names, the bearers of which\r\ncannot be identified outside this record. Some of these last may be\r\nlocal people connected with the estates to which the grant refers, but\r\nmost of even the English names can be recognised in the general history\r\nof the time. The peculiar value of the list is that it shows us\r\nEnglishmen and Normans associated, apparently on terms of equality, at\r\nthe Conqueror’s court. It is instructive to see the English earls of\r\nNorthampton and Mercia signing between Earl William Fitz Osbern and\r\nCount Robert of Mortain; the fact that men whose names are among the\r\ngreatest in Domesday Book are to be found witnessing the same document\r\nwith men who had signed Edward the Confessor’s charters helps us to\r\nbridge the gulf which separates Anglo-Saxon from Norman England. But\r\nthis phenomenon is confined to the years immediately succeeding the\r\nConquest; very suddenly, after the date of this document, the English\r\nelement at William’s court gives way and disappears, and with it\r\ndisappear the names which unite the Old English “Witan” to the Norman\r\n“Concilium.” This is a fact to which we have already had occasion to\r\nrefer, for the general change in William’s policy which occurs in 1070\r\naffects every aspect of his history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EARLDOMS\r\n  January 1075]\r\n\r\nThe functions of this court or council seem to have been as\r\nindeterminate as its composition. Largely, no doubt, they were\r\nceremonial; this aspect of the council was evidently in the mind of\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury when he wrote the passage quoted on page\r\n[missing]. At times it appears as a judicial body, Waltheof was\r\ncondemned in the Midwinter Council of 1075; while of its advisory powers\r\nwe have a supreme example in the “deep speech” at Gloucester, which led\r\nto the making of Domesday Book. If the title which is attached to the\r\noldest copy of William’s laws has any validity, they were promulgated in\r\naccordance with Old English customs by the king _cum principibus suis_;\r\none clause in particular is said to have been ordained “in civitate\r\nClaudia,” which may suggest that the law in question had been decreed in\r\none of the Midwinter Councils at Gloucester. But of one thing only we\r\ncan be sure, whatever functions the Council may have fulfilled, the\r\nking’s will was the motive force which under lay all its action.\r\n\r\nIn later times, the chief justiciar appears as the normal president of\r\nthe Council, but in William’s reign it is hard to find any single\r\nofficer bearing that title. No doubt, when William was in England he\r\nhimself presided over his council; when he was in Normandy, if the\r\ncouncil met at all, which is unlikely, his place would probably be\r\ntaken by the representative he had left behind him. It is, perhaps,\r\nimpossible to give a dated list of the vicegerents who appear in\r\nWilliam’s reign; our notices of them are very scanty. We have seen\r\nthat in 1067 William Fitz Osbern and Odo of Bayeux were left as\r\n“regents” of England when William made his first visit to Normandy\r\nafter the Conquest; there has survived an interesting writ of that\r\nyear in which “Willelm cyng and Willelm eorl” address jointly the\r\ncountry magnates of Somersetshire.[298] At the time of the revolt of\r\nthe three earls in 1075, it is clear that Lanfranc was the king’s\r\nvicegerent, an office which he probably filled again during William’s\r\nlast continental visit in 1086–7. For several reasons it is probable\r\nthat Odo of Bayeux was regent not long before his fall in 1082; it was\r\nas the king’s representative that he took drastic vengeance on the\r\nmurderers of Bishop Walcher of Durham in 1080, and a most suggestive\r\nstory in the Abingdon Chartulary shows us King William repudiating the\r\njudgment which his brother had given in a local lawsuit during his\r\nregency.[299] From the same chartulary we learn that at some time\r\nbetween 1071 and 1081 Queen Matilda herself was hearing pleas at\r\nWindsor “in place of the king who was then in Normandy,”[300] though\r\nthis, of course, need not imply that she was regent in any wider sense\r\nof the term. In general, the writs which the king sent from Normandy\r\ninto England will be addressed directly to the ordinary authorities of\r\nthe shire; and our knowledge of the succession of William’s\r\nrepresentatives is derived from incidental notices elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EARLDOMS\r\n  September 1087]\r\n\r\nSo far as we can see King William was always attended by a varying\r\nnumber of his barons; a continually changing cortège followed the king\r\nin his progress over the country. To this fluctuating body, just as to\r\nthe solemn council, our Latin authorities give the title of the King’s\r\nCourt, the “Curia Regis,” a phrase which at once connects the amorphous\r\ngroup of William’s courtiers with the specialised executive of Henry II.\r\nIn a sense, no doubt, William’s court was the only executive of its\r\ntime, but the employment of these modern terms leads straight towards\r\nanachronism; the judicial function of the Curia Regis was quite as\r\nimportant as its executive work, and the court was, after all, only a\r\nfraction of that larger council in which we have seen “judicial,”\r\n“executive,” and “legislative” powers to be combined. If we are to make\r\nfor ourselves a distinction between two bodies which are tacitly\r\nidentified by all early writers, we may say that the Curia Regis was\r\ncomposed of just those members of the Commune Concilium who happened to\r\nbe in attendance on the king at any given moment. But we must remember\r\nthat to the men of the eleventh century the king’s “court” and the\r\nking’s “council” were one and the same; any distinction between them\r\nwhich we may make exists for our own convenience and nothing more; the\r\ncourt was only a shrunken form of the council.\r\n\r\nEven those men who are most frequently to be found in attendance on the\r\nking do not seem to be characterised either by special legal knowledge\r\nor by definite official position. Great officers of the court, such as\r\nthe steward and the constable, do repeatedly appear; their positions\r\nhave not yet become annexed to any of the greater baronial houses, and\r\nit is probable that their official duties are a reality; but, although\r\nEudo Fitz Hubert (de Rye) the steward, for instance, seems to have been\r\na personal friend of all three Norman kings, and accordingly is a\r\nfrequent signatory of their writs, such members of the official class\r\nseem always to be accompanied by the unofficial barons present. Their\r\nattendance also is very intermittent; even the chancellor is much less\r\nin evidence in the Conqueror’s charters than in those of Henry I. or\r\nII., and under these circumstances we may fairly ask how this\r\nunprofessional body acted when required to behave as a court of law.\r\nEnglish evidence helps us little, but we get a useful hint as to\r\nprocedure in certain Norman charters and an analysis of one of them may\r\nbe quoted:\r\n\r\n  “At length both parties were summoned before the king’s court, in\r\n  which there sat many of the nobles of the land of whom Geoffrey,\r\n  bishop of Coutances, was delegated by the king’s authority as judge of\r\n  the dispute, with Ranulf the Vicomte, Neel, son of Neel, Robert de\r\n  Usepont, and many other capable judges who diligently and fully\r\n  examined the origin of the dispute, and delivered judgment that the\r\n  mill ought to belong to St. Michael and his monks forever. The most\r\n  victorious king William approved and confirmed this decision.”[301]\r\n\r\nGeoffrey, bishop of Coutances is one of the more frequent visitors at\r\nWilliam’s English courts, and we may suspect that this method was not\r\ninfrequently used in England when the intricacy of a matter in dispute\r\nsurpassed the legal competence of the court as a whole. It forms, in\r\nfact, the first stage in that segregation of a legal nucleus within the\r\nindifferentiated _Curia_ which created the executive organ of the days\r\nof the two great Henrys. The early part of this process takes place\r\nalmost wholly in the dark so far as England is concerned, and we must\r\nseriously doubt whether it had led to any very definite results when the\r\nConqueror died; for it is to Henry I., rather than to his father, that\r\nwe should assign the formation of an organised body of royal\r\nadministrators. In this, as in other institutional matters, the\r\nConqueror’s reign was a time of tentative expedients and simple\r\nsolutions; it is essentially a period of origins.\r\n\r\nThe king’s court is a very mobile body. The king is always travelling\r\nfrom place to place, and where he is at any moment there is his court\r\nheld also. It is possible to construct an itinerary of our kings from\r\nHenry II. onward, but this cannot be done in the case of William, for it\r\nis exceptional for his charters to contain any dating clause. William is\r\nindeed to be seen issuing writs in very different parts of his kingdom:\r\nat Winchester, the ancient capital of Wessex, and York, the ancient\r\ncapital of Northumbria; at hunting seats such as Brill and Woodstock; at\r\nDownton in Wiltshire, Droitwich, and Burton-on-Trent; but the list of\r\nplaces which we know to have been visited by William and his court in\r\ntime of peace is very small compared with the materials which we possess\r\nfor an itinerary of Henry I., or even of William Rufus. To this\r\ndeficiency of information is largely to be attributed the fact that,\r\ncompared with Henry I., William is rarely[302] to be found in the\r\nnorthern parts of his kingdom; it is probable that fuller knowledge of\r\nthe details of his progresses would reveal a number of unrecorded visits\r\nto the shires beyond Watling Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM’S WRIT TO COVENTRY]\r\n\r\nA natural means of transition from the king’s court to the local\r\ndivisions of the country, the shires and hundreds, is afforded by the\r\nrecognised means of communication between the two, those writs of which\r\nmention has already been made. In form a writ is simply a letter\r\naddressed to the persons who are responsible for the fulfilment of its\r\ndirections, and it is usually witnessed, as we have seen, by a greater\r\nor less number of the persons present with the king at the time of its\r\nissue. Such a letter might be written either in Latin or in Old English,\r\nthe former of course being more usual under the Norman kings, and it was\r\nusually authenticated with the king’s great seal. This simple device\r\nseems to have been the legal means by which the great transfer of land\r\nwhich followed the Conquest was brought about; the king would send down\r\none of these writs to the sheriff of a county directing him to put a\r\ncertain baron in possession of certain specified lands, and the sheriff\r\nwould need no further warrant. We may give the following as an example\r\nof a writ in its Latin form:\r\n\r\n  “William king of the English salutes Baldwin sheriff of Devonshire and\r\n  all his barons and servants in that shire.\r\n\r\n  Know ye that I have granted to my monks of Battle [de Bello] the\r\n  church of St. Olaf in Exeter with the lands of Shireford and with all\r\n  other lands and possessions belonging to the said church. Wherefore, I\r\n  will and command that they hold it freely and in peace and quit from\r\n  every duty of earthly service and from all pleas and claims and\r\n  [attendance at] shire and hundred courts and from every geld and\r\n  ‘scot’ and aid and gift and danegeld and army service, with sake and\r\n  soke and infangenethef; [quit moreover from] all works on castles and\r\n  bridges, as befits my demesne alms. Witnessed by Thomas, Archbishop of\r\n  York, and William, the son of Osbert at Winchester.”[303]\r\n\r\nAny comment on the privileges conveyed by the document would be outside\r\nour present purpose, which is merely to illustrate the way in which King\r\nWilliam sent his instructions into the different parts of his kingdom.\r\nBut the formula of address deserves notice because it suggests that the\r\nwrit was really directed to the shire court where the sheriff and the\r\n“barons and king’s servants” of the shire periodically met. There it\r\nwould be read in the presence of the assembled men of the county, and\r\nthe sheriff would forthwith proceed to carry its directions into effect.\r\nThe sheriff in the king’s eyes is clearly the executive officer of the\r\nshire and his importance is not to be measured by the modern\r\nassociations aroused by his title. The Latin word which we translate as\r\n“sheriff” is _vicecomes_ and this word also represents the French\r\n_vicomte_, a fact which should by no means be ignored, for the sheriffs\r\nof the half-century succeeding the Conquest resemble their French\r\ncontemporaries much more closely than either their English successors of\r\nthe twelfth century or the shire reeves of the Anglo-Saxon period. For\r\none thing, they are in a sense true _vicecomites_: the sheriff was the\r\nchief officer in each county in which there was no earl, and the\r\nearldoms created by William were few, and with the exception of Kent\r\nwere situated in remote parts of the land. Then also it is certain that\r\nsome at least of the more important sheriffdoms were hereditary in much\r\nthe same sense as that in which the great earldoms before the Conquest\r\nwere hereditary—the cases of Devon, Wiltshire and Essex are examples—to\r\nwhich we must add that the early Norman sheriffs are often very great\r\nmen. Baldwin the sheriff of Devon was the son of William’s own guardian,\r\nCount Gilbert of Brionne, and two of his sons followed him in the\r\noffice. Edward the sheriff of Wiltshire was the ancestor of the medieval\r\nearls of Salisbury. Urse de Abetot, alternately despoiler and tenant of\r\nthe church of Worcester was the chief lay landowner in Worcestershire,\r\nHugh Fitz Baldric, sheriff of Yorkshire, was among the greater tenants\r\nin chief in that county. In local, as in general constitutional history,\r\nit is most important not to read the ideas of Henry II.’s time into the\r\ninstitutions which prevailed under the Conqueror. Had William in 1070\r\ntried to carry out a general deposition of his sheriffs, such as Henry\r\nII. actually achieved in 1170, the attempt, we may be sure, would have\r\nled to a revolt, and the mass of the baronage would have sided with the\r\nofficial members of their class. But indeed, so long as the Normans were\r\nstill intruders in a conquered country, it was only politic on William’s\r\npart to govern through men of strong territorial position, men who had\r\nthe power to enforce the king’s commands in their own localities. In the\r\nchoice of his local administrators, as in certain other aspects of his\r\npolicy, William was preparing difficulties for his successors, but his\r\njustification lay in the essential needs of his own time. The great\r\ntransfer of land from Englishmen to Normans, to take one instance, could\r\nnever have been accomplished if the local government of the country had\r\nbeen in weak hands.\r\n\r\nIn the period immediately following the Conquest, the four years between\r\n1066 and 1070, which in so many respects are distinct from the rest of\r\nWilliam’s reign, perhaps the majority of the sheriffdoms continued to be\r\nheld by Englishmen. Within this period writs are addressed to Edmund,\r\nsheriff of Herefordshire, Sawold of Oxfordshire, Swegen of Essex, and\r\nTofig of Somerset, and even after 1070 such Englishmen as Ethelwine,\r\nsheriff of Staffordshire,[304] continue the series. In fact, the\r\ndevelopment of the provincial administration in this respect seems to\r\nhave followed a very similar course to that which we have noted in the\r\ncase of the king’s court; there is a period in which men of both races\r\nare mingled in the government of the shires, as well as in attendance on\r\nthe king’s person. But by the end of the reign the change in both\r\nrespects had become almost complete, and the introduction of Norman\r\nsheriffs began early; for before 1069 Urse de Abetot had already entered\r\nupon his aggressive course as sheriff of Worcestershire, and it is very\r\nprobable that even by the time of William’s coronation the Norman\r\nGeoffrey had succeeded Ansgar the Staller in his sheriffdom of London\r\nand Middlesex.[305]\r\n\r\nFrom the sheriffs we may pass naturally to their superiors in rank, the\r\nearls. Taught by experience, William regarded the vast, half-independent\r\nearldoms of the later Anglo-Saxon period with profound mistrust, and as\r\nthe occasion presented itself he allowed them to lapse. All the earldoms\r\nheld by members of the house of Godwine became extinct with the battle\r\nof Hastings, but the great provincial governments of Mercia and\r\nNorthumbria probably lasted until the final revolt of Earls Edwin and\r\nMorcar in the spring of 1069. After their suppression there remained\r\nthree minor earldoms of Anglo-Saxon origin, East Anglia, Northampton,\r\nand Bernicia, the holders of which, as we have seen, were mainly\r\nresponsible for the rebellion of 1075. Upon William’s triumph in the\r\nlatter year the East Anglian earldom was suppressed, that of Northampton\r\nceases to exist for the remainder of the Conqueror’s reign, and we have\r\nalready noticed the reasons which led to the continuance of the earldom\r\nof Bernicia. Similar motives led to the creation of the four earldoms\r\nwhich alone can be proved to have come into being before 1087, and which\r\ndeserve to be considered in detail here. They are:\r\n\r\n  1. Hereford, granted to William Fitz Osbern before January, 1067.\r\n\r\n  2. Shrewsbury, granted to Roger de Montgomery circ. 1070.\r\n\r\n  3. Chester, granted to Hugh d’Avranches, before January, 1071.\r\n\r\n  4. Kent, granted to Odo, bishop of Bayeux, possibly before January,\r\n  1067.\r\n\r\nThe exact extent of the earldom of Hereford is doubtful, for there\r\nexists a certain amount of evidence which makes it probable that William\r\nFitz Osbern possessed the rights of an earl over Gloucestershire and\r\nWorcestershire in addition to the county from which he took his title.\r\nWe have already discussed the general significance of the early writ\r\nwhich the king addressed to Earl William and the magnates of\r\nGloucestershire and Worcestershire, and the evidence of this document is\r\nsupported by the fact that the earl appears as dealing in a very\r\narbitrary fashion with land and property in both shires.[306] It is\r\nprobable on other grounds that Gloucestershire lay within the Fitz\r\nOsbern earldom, for William’s possessions extended far south of the\r\nHerefordshire border to the lands between Wye and Usk in the modern\r\ncounty of Monmouth, and the addition of Gloucestershire to Herefordshire\r\nis required to complete the line of earldoms which lay along the Welsh\r\nborder. On the other hand it seems probable that Worcestershire never\r\nbelonged to Roger, William Fitz Osbern’s son, for in 1075 it was the\r\nmain object of the royal captains in the west to prevent him from\r\ncrossing the Severn to the assistance of his friends in the midlands. In\r\nany case the early date at which the earldom of Hereford was created\r\ndeserves notice, for it shows that within four months of the battle of\r\nHastings William was strong enough to place a foreign earl in command of\r\na remote and turbulent border shire. Short as was his tenure of his\r\nearldom William Fitz Osbern was able to leave his mark there; fifty\r\nyears after his death there still remained in force an ordinance which\r\nhe had decreed to the effect that no knight should be condemned to pay\r\nmore than seven shillings for any offence.[307] Lastly, it should be\r\nnoted that in a document of 1067[308] William Fitz Osbern is styled\r\n“consul palatinus,” a title which should not be construed “palatine\r\nearl,” but which rather means that William, though raised to comital\r\nrank, still retained the position of “dapifer” or steward of the court,\r\nwhich he inherited from his father, the unlucky Osbern of the\r\nConqueror’s minority, and in virtue of which the earl of Hereford\r\ncontinued to be the titular head of the royal household.\r\n\r\nTo the north of William Fitz Osbern, Roger de Montgomery, the other\r\nfriend of William’s early days, was established in an earldom threaded\r\nby the Severn as Herefordshire is threaded by the Wye, and stretching\r\nalong the former river to the town and castle to which the house of\r\nMontgomery left its name. From the standpoint of frontier strategy\r\nRoger’s position was even more important than that held by his neighbour\r\nof Hereford; for Shrewsbury, the point where roads from London, Stafford\r\nand the east, and Chester and the north met before crossing the Severn,\r\ncontinued throughout the Middle Ages to be the key to mid-Wales.\r\nUnfortunately, the date at which Roger received the Shropshire earldom\r\ncannot be fixed with certainty, for, while he appears at court in the\r\nenjoyment of comital rank as early as 1069, the one account which we\r\npossess of the operations at Shrewsbury in the latter year virtually\r\nimplies that the town was then in the king’s hand. Probably the\r\ndiscrepancy is to be explained by the fact that before he received his\r\ngrant of Shropshire Roger had been given the castle of Arundel and the\r\ntown of Chichester in the distant shire of Sussex.[309] It is highly\r\nprobable, in fact, that Roger possessed the rights of an earl over the\r\nlatter county,[310] and such a grant would fall in well with the general\r\npolicy of the Conqueror, for Sussex was only less important than Kent as\r\na point of arrival from the continent, and in the eleventh century\r\nArundel was a port. Most probably Roger was appointed earl of Shrewsbury\r\nafter the events of 1069 had shown that a coalition of Welsh and English\r\nwas the most pressing danger of the moment, but he continued in\r\npossession of Arundel and Chichester.[311] Once established at\r\nShrewsbury, Roger and his followers speedily proceeded to take the\r\noffensive against the Welsh, and in 1072 Hugh de Montgomery, the earl’s\r\neldest son, extended his raids as far south as Cardigan. In addition to\r\nbeing the earl of two English shires, Roger de Montgomery held great\r\npossessions in Normandy and France; in right of his wife he was count of\r\nBellême, and by a more distant succession he became Seigneur of Alençon,\r\nwhile a series of marriage alliances placed him at the head of a\r\npowerful group of kinsmen. But it is probable that the place which he\r\nholds in history is due less to his wide lands and great power than to\r\nthe accident that one of his knights became the father of the greatest\r\nhistorian whom Normandy had so far produced. The earl of Shrewsbury was\r\na great baron and a loyal knight, but when we regard him as representing\r\nthe best aspect of the Norman conquerors of England we are, consciously\r\nor otherwise, guided by the place which he fills in the narrative of the\r\nchronicler born within his earldom, Ordericus Vitalis.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which the earldom of Chester was created present\r\na certain amount of difficulty. Chester itself was the last great town\r\nof England which called for separate reduction at William’s hands, and\r\nit did not fall until the beginning of 1070. Then we are told that\r\nWilliam gave the earldom of Cheshire to Gherbod, one of his Flemish[312]\r\nfollowers, but an original charter[313] of the time shows us Hugh Lupus\r\nof Avranches already addressed as earl of Chester in or before February,\r\n1071. Now Gherbod (who never appears in any English document) was killed\r\nin Flanders in the latter month, so that we can only suppose that, if he\r\never received the earldom, he never took practical possession of it, and\r\nresigned it almost immediately. The historical earldom of Chester is\r\nthat which remained in the family of Hugh of Avranches for two centuries\r\nand formed the “county palatine” which survived until 1536. It was a\r\nfrontier earldom in a double sense: Chester controlled the passage of\r\nthe Dee into North Wales and also the coast road to Rhuddlan and\r\nAnglesey, while so long as all England north of Morecambe Bay was Scotch\r\nterritory, it was politic to entrust much power to the man who commanded\r\nthe west coast route from the midlands to the north. Judging from the\r\nevidence of Domesday Book, the whole of Cheshire formed one compact fief\r\nin the hands of its earl; it is the only county in England possessed\r\noutright by one tenant-in-chief. Of Earl Hugh, we can draw the outlines\r\nof no very pleasing picture. He was devoted to every kind of sensual\r\nindulgence, and so fat that no horse could carry him; he is charged like\r\nmost of his contemporaries with disrespect to the rights of church\r\nproperty. On the other hand, he was, so far as we can see, unswervingly\r\nfaithful to the king, and he abundantly fulfilled his natural duty of\r\nkeeping the Welsh away from the English border; nor is it probable that\r\nWilliam would have entrusted to a lethargic fool one of the most\r\nresponsible positions in his kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe case of Kent stands apart from that of its three sister earldoms.\r\nThe latter were created as the readiest means of securing a part of the\r\ncountry remote from the centre of authority. The importance of Kent lay\r\nin its position between London and the Channel ports. Through the county\r\nran the great Dover road, the main artery of communication between all\r\nnorthern England and the continent, the obvious line along which an\r\ninvader would strike at London. The rising of 1067 proved the reality of\r\nsuch danger and it was reasonable that the county should be placed in\r\ncharge of the man who by relationship was the natural vicegerent of the\r\nking when the latter was across the Channel. Territorially, Kent was\r\nmuch less completely in the hands of its earl than was the case with\r\neither of the three western earldoms, but the possessions of Odo of\r\nBayeux in the rest of England placed him in the first rank of\r\nlandowners. The date at which the earldom was created is not quite\r\ncertain; like William Fitz Osbern, Odo may have received his earldom at\r\nthe time of his joint regency with the former in 1067. He is addressed\r\nas bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent in a charter which is not later\r\nthan 1077, and his rank as an earl is strikingly brought out in the\r\ncircumstances of his dramatic arrest in 1082.\r\n\r\nJudged by later events, the creation of these four great earldoms may\r\nseem to have been a mistake on the part of the Conqueror. Hereford,\r\nKent, and Shropshire in turn served as the base of operations for a\r\nformidable revolt within fifty years of the Conquest. Their formation\r\nalso contrasts with the general principles which governed the\r\ndistribution of land among the Norman baronage, principles which aimed\r\nin the main at reproducing the discrete character of the greater old\r\nEnglish estates. Before the Conquest no such compact block of territory\r\nas the earldom of Cheshire had ever been given in direct possession to\r\nany subject. But here, as in the case of the powerful sheriffdoms of\r\nWilliam’s time, his justification lay in his immediate necessities. His\r\nreason for the creation of the western earldoms was the same as that\r\nwhich prompted his successors to entrust almost unlimited power to the\r\ngreat lords on the march of Wales. It was absolutely necessary to secure\r\ncentral England against all danger from Welsh invasion, and the king\r\nhimself had neither the time nor the means to conquer Wales outright. He\r\nfound a temporary solution by placing on the debatable border three\r\nearls, strong enough in land and men to keep the Welsh at bay and\r\nimpelled by self-interest to carry out his wishes. And also we should\r\nremember that it was only wise to guard against a repetition of that\r\ncombination of independent Welsh and irreconcilable English which had\r\nbeen planned in 1068; the three western earldoms were all created before\r\nthe capture of Ely in 1071 ended the series of national risings against\r\nthe Conqueror. Lastly, it will not escape notice that at the outset all\r\nfour earldoms were given to men whom William knew well and had every\r\nreason to trust. Odo of Kent was his half-brother; Roger de Montgomery\r\nand William Fitz Osbern were young men already at his side in his early\r\nwarfare before Domfront; Hugh of Chester belonged to a family which had\r\nheld household positions in his Norman court. William might well have\r\nfelt that he could not entrust his delegated power to safer hands than\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nFour or five shires only were placed under the control of separate\r\nearls, and in them as elsewhere in England the old English system of\r\nlocal government continued with but little change. The shire and hundred\r\ncourts continued to meet to transact the judicial and administrative\r\nbusiness of their respective districts though the manorial courts which\r\nsprang up in great numbers as a result of the Conquest were continually\r\nwithdrawing more and more of this work. We know very little of the\r\nordinary procedure of the local courts; it is only when they take part\r\nin some especially important affair such as the Domesday Inquest that\r\nthe details of their action are recorded. An excellent illustration of\r\nthe way in which the machinery of the shire court was applied to the\r\nsettlement of legal disputes is afforded by the following record, taken\r\nfrom the history of the church of Rochester:\r\n\r\n  “In the time of William the Great, king of the English, father of\r\n  William, also king of that nation, there arose a dispute between\r\n  Gundulf, bishop of Rochester, and Picot, sheriff of Cambridge, about\r\n  certain land, situated in Freckenham, but belonging to Isleham, which\r\n  one of the king’s sergeants, called Olchete, had presumed to occupy in\r\n  virtue of the sheriff’s grant. For the sheriff said that the land in\r\n  question was the king’s, but the bishop declared that it belonged to\r\n  the church of St. Andrew. And so they came before the king who ordered\r\n  that all the men of that shire should be brought together, that by\r\n  their verdict [_judicio_], it might be determined to whom the land\r\n  should rightly belong. Now they, when assembled, through fear of the\r\n  sheriff, declared the land to belong to the king, rather than to\r\n  Blessed Andrew, but the bishop of Bayeux, who was presiding over the\r\n  plea, did not believe them, and directed that if they were sure that\r\n  their verdict was true, they should choose twelve out of their number\r\n  to confirm with an oath what all had said. But when the twelve had\r\n  withdrawn to consider the matter, they were struck with terror by a\r\n  message from the sheriff and so, on returning, they swore that to be\r\n  true which had been declared before. Now, these men were Edward of\r\n  Chippenham, Heruld and Leofwine ‘saca’ of Exning, Eadric of Isleham,\r\n  Wulfwine of Landwade, Ordmer of Bellingham, and six others of the\r\n  better men of the county. After all this, the land remained in the\r\n  king’s hand. But in that same year a certain monk, called Grim came to\r\n  the bishop like a messenger from God, for when he heard what the\r\n  Cambridge men had sworn, he was amazed, and in his wrath called them\r\n  all liars. For this monk had formerly been the reeve of Freckenham,\r\n  and had received services and customary payments from the land in\r\n  question as from the other lands belonging there, while he had had\r\n  under him in that manor one of the very men who had made the sworn\r\n  confirmation. When the bishop of Rochester had heard this, he went to\r\n  the bishop of Bayeux and told him the monk’s story in order. Then the\r\n  bishop of Bayeux summoned the monk before himself and heard the same\r\n  tale from him, after which he summoned one of those who had sworn, who\r\n  instantly fell down before his feet and acknowledged himself to be a\r\n  liar. Then again he summoned the man who had sworn first of all, and\r\n  on being questioned he likewise confessed his perjury. Lastly, he\r\n  ordered the sheriff to send the remaining jurors to London to appear\r\n  before him together with twelve others of the better men of the county\r\n  to confirm the oath of the former twelve. To the same place also, he\r\n  summoned many of the greater barons of England, and when all were\r\n  assembled in London, judgment was given both by French and English\r\n  that all the jurors were perjured since the man after whom all had\r\n  sworn had owned himself to be a liar. After a condemnation of this\r\n  kind the bishop of Rochester kept the land, as was just, but since the\r\n  second twelve jurors wished to assert that they did not agree with\r\n  those who had first sworn, the bishop of Bayeux said that they should\r\n  prove this by the ordeal of iron. They promised to do so, but failed,\r\n  and by the judgment of the other men of their county they paid three\r\n  hundred pounds to the king.”[314]\r\n\r\nIn this extract we get a vivid picture of the way in which the two\r\nsystems of government, Norman and English, worked in conjunction. In the\r\nabove transactions the matter in dispute is referred for settlement to\r\nthe ancient shire court of Cambridgeshire, and determined by the oaths\r\nof English jurors, but the procedure is a Norman innovation, and it is\r\nthe Conqueror’s brother who presides over the plea. The terror inspired\r\nby the sheriff is an eloquent commentary on the vague complaints of the\r\nchroniclers concerning the oppression of the king’s officers, and we may\r\nwelcome this casual glimpse into the relations between the English folk\r\nof the county and the formidable president of their court. But the\r\nremaining details of the story may well be left to explain themselves.\r\n\r\nBut a suit of this kind must not be taken as typical of the ordinary\r\nwork of the shire court; it was not every day that it had to discuss the\r\naffairs of a king and a bishop. It was the exceptional rank of the\r\nparties concerned in this instance which enabled them to traverse the\r\noriginal judgment of the shire court and to employ a procedure quite\r\nalien to the methods of the Old English local moots. So far as we can\r\nsee, the practice of settling disputes by the verdict of a small body of\r\nsworn jurors was entirely a Norman innovation, and we may be sure that\r\nit would not have been employed in this case if the veracity of the men\r\nof the shire had not been called in question. Within ten years of the\r\ndate of our story the king’s fiscal rights all over England were to be\r\nascertained by the inquisition of sworn juries in the Domesday Inquest,\r\nbut the employment of this method in ordinary judicial cases continued\r\nto be highly exceptional down to the beginning of the Angevin period,\r\nand our instance may perhaps claim to be the first recorded example of\r\nits use. The duty of the shire court in all pleas of the kind, to which\r\nit would have been confined in all probability in the above case if the\r\nking had not been attracted within the dispute, was simply to declare\r\nthe customary law which related to the matter in hand. In principle, a\r\njudgment of this kind is entirely different from the verdict on oath\r\ngiven by men selected for their local knowledge as were the jurors in\r\nour story: if carried out honestly the result would be the same in\r\neither case—the land would be assigned to the proper person; but whereas\r\nthis would only follow incidentally if inevitably from the unsworn\r\njudgment of the court as a whole, the sworn verdict would consist of an\r\nactual award. The latter principle produced the Angevin juries of\r\npresentment; the former principle continued to underlie the action of\r\nthe shire and hundred courts so long as they exercised judicial\r\nfunctions. The interest of the Isleham case above lies in its\r\ntransitional character: it shows us the sworn jury used as a secondary\r\nresort after the accustomed practice of the shire court had failed to\r\ngive satisfaction; already in 1077 it is available for the amendment of\r\nwrongs arising “_pro defectu recti_,” on the part of the domesmen of the\r\nlocal assemblies.\r\n\r\nBut just as the introduction of the jury was bringing a new procedure\r\ninto competition with the antiquated methods of the local courts, so a\r\nquite different set of causes was cutting at the root of their\r\ninfluence. Centuries before the Conquest considerable powers of\r\njurisdiction had been placed in private, generally ecclesiastical,\r\nhands, but the gradual extension of the sphere of private justice, until\r\nit became an integral part of the whole manorial organisation, was due\r\nto the feudal principles which triumphed in 1066. Private jurisdiction,\r\nas it existed in the Conqueror’s day, represents the blending of at\r\nleast three distinct principles. In the first place, the king can confer\r\njurisdictional rights on whomsoever he pleases; from this point of view\r\na private court will represent a portion of royal power in the hands of\r\na subject. But in the second place, the king himself is only the first\r\nof a number of men who possess these rights in virtue of their rank; it\r\nis probable that the political theory of the eleventh century would\r\nallow that a great man was naturally possessed of such powers of justice\r\nas were appropriate to his personal status, though it would be unable to\r\ngive a rational explanation of the fact. And then even in the\r\nConqueror’s time there can be traced the idea, the prevalence of which\r\nwas destined to cover England with manorial courts, that the tenurial\r\nrelation between a lord and his tenant gave the former jurisdictional\r\npowers over the latter; that, independently of a royal grant, or of his\r\npersonal rank, a lord was entitled to hold a court for his “men”; that\r\nthe economic relation between landlord and tenant produced a\r\ncorresponding tie in the sphere of jurisdiction. It is the first two of\r\nthese principles which produced the “sake and soke” of Anglo-Saxon law,\r\nit is the last which explains the extension of manorial justice in the\r\ncentury following the Conquest.[315] It is worth while making this\r\nclassification, for it reveals one of the main lines of divergence\r\nbetween English and French law in the Middle Ages. That which in England\r\nwas the least persistent of our three principles, the element of\r\npersonal rank, became in France the basis of the famous classification\r\nof jurisdictional powers into “haut, moyen, et bas justice,” which\r\nendured until the Revolution, and the main reason for this difference\r\nlies in the circumstances of the Norman Conquest. By that event,\r\nwhatever the explanation of private justice which may have passed\r\ncurrent among those who troubled themselves about such matters, all such\r\npowers proceeded directly or indirectly from the king; directly when the\r\nConqueror made an explicit grant of “sake and soke” to a baron,\r\nindirectly if the latter claimed his court as proceeding from his tenure\r\nof his land, for the land itself was held of the king who had granted it\r\nto him. Here then, in the Sphere of local justice, we see the union of\r\nNorman and English ideas; the judicial power which results from the\r\nfacts of tenure is added to the judicial power which is exercised in\r\nvirtue of the king’s grant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF GREAT CANFIELD CASTLE, ESSEX]\r\n\r\nIt should not be thought that the Norman barons, in their seats across\r\nthe Channel, had exercised jurisdictional powers in advance of those\r\npossessed by the English nobles and thegns whom they were destined to\r\ndisplace. The fact that the grants of private justice which the\r\nConqueror made to his followers in England were set forth in the same\r\nconventional phrases as Edward the Confessor would have employed in like\r\ncase, may be set down to William’s desire to preserve the forms of Old\r\nEnglish law; but there is no doubt that the Norman barons were quite\r\ncontent to accept the Anglo-Saxon formulas as a satisfactory expression\r\nof the jurisdictional powers which they were to enjoy. In fact, the\r\nlatter were ample enough. Thus, when the Conqueror confirmed his\r\n“customs” to the abbot of Ely, these included “sake and soke, toll and\r\nteam and infangenethef, hamsocne and grithbrice, fihtwite and fyrdwite\r\nwithin boroughs and without, and the penalties for all other crimes\r\nwhich are emendable on his land and over his men, as he held them on the\r\nday when King Edward was alive and dead.”[316] Terms like these cover\r\nnearly the whole field of “civil and criminal justice.” Sake and soke\r\nmay be construed as the right to hold a court; toll explains itself;\r\n“team” implies that persons might be “vouched to warranty” in the court,\r\na process which is too technical to be explained here, but the grant of\r\nwhich made a court capable of entertaining suits arising out of the\r\ntransfer of land; “infangenethef” is the right of trying and executing\r\nthieves taken on one’s land; “hamsocne” (or rather “hamfare”) is the\r\nbreach of a man’s house; “grithbrice” is the violation of the grantees’\r\nspecial peace; “fihtwite” is the fine for a general breach of the peace;\r\n“fyrdwite” is the fine for failure to appear in the national militia,\r\nthe fyrd. Privileges like these, within the area to which they are\r\napplicable, empower the grantees’ court to take cognisance of all crimes\r\nand misdemeanours which might be expected to occur in the ordinary\r\ncourse of events; the Isle of Ely and some dozens of external manors\r\nwere practically withdrawn altogether from the national system of\r\njustice. We have no reason to suppose that the average baron in Normandy\r\nwas endowed with anything like these powers, nor need we suppose that\r\ngrants of such wide application were very frequently made to the\r\nconquerors of England; but when, two years after the date of Domesday\r\nBook, we find Roger de Busli—a great baron certainly, but not belonging\r\nabsolutely to the first rank—granting to his monks of Blyth “sac and\r\nsoke, tol and team and infangenethef, iron and ditch and gallows with\r\nall other privileges [_libertates_] which I formerly held of the\r\nking,”[317] we can see that the feudalisation of justice had gone far by\r\nthe time of King William’s death.\r\n\r\nWe may then fairly inquire what was the relation which these new\r\nmanorial courts bore to the old national courts which they were destined\r\nto supplant. With reference to the hundred and shire assemblies, the\r\nanswer is fairly simple: the two systems of jurisdiction were\r\nconcurrent. The hundred court, we must remember, was in no sense\r\ninferior to the shire court, and in the same way the manorial court was\r\nin no sense inferior to either of these bodies; it rested with the\r\nindividual litigant before which of them he should bring his plea, with\r\nthis most important exception—that the lord of the party impleaded could\r\nif he wished “claim his court,” and so appropriate the profits of the\r\ntrial. Here was a most powerful force steadily drawing business away\r\nfrom the shires and hundreds, and attracting it within the purview of\r\nthe manor. But then the wishes of the peasantry told in the same\r\ndirection: the manorial court was close at hand; it was composed of\r\nneighbours who knew each others’ concerns, and were constantly\r\nassociated in the common agricultural work of the vill; it gratified the\r\ntendencies towards local isolation, which were pre-eminently strong in\r\nthe early Middle Ages. The manorial court supplied justice at home, and\r\nwe should remember how many hindrances beset recourse to the hundreds\r\nand shires. In all Staffordshire there were only five hundreds; in all\r\nLeicestershire only four wapentakes; the prosecution of a suit in any of\r\nthese courts must have meant grievous weariness and loss, the\r\nestablishment of a manorial court must have meant an immediate\r\nalleviation of the law’s delay. He would have been an exceptionally\r\nfar-sighted villein who in 1086 could foresee that the convenient local\r\ncourt would eventually be the agent by which his descendants would be\r\nthrown into dependence on the will of the lord, with no other protection\r\nthan the traditional and unwritten “custom of the manor”; that the\r\nestablishment of the lord’s justice would ultimately exclude all\r\nreference to the more independent if more antiquated justice of the men\r\nof the hundred of the shire, on the part of the lesser folk of his vill.\r\n\r\nOne question connected with the rise of manorial courts deserves\r\nattention here—did they displace any court proper to the vill as a\r\nwhole, independently of its manorial aspect? It is clear that every now\r\nand again the men of the vill must have met, if only to regulate the\r\ndetails of its open-field husbandry. But whether such a meeting had any\r\nformal constitution or judicial functions—whether, that is, it was a\r\n“township-moot,” in the accepted sense of the words[318]—is excessively\r\ndoubtful. The fact that we hear nothing definitely about it in the\r\ndocuments of the Anglo-Saxon period is not quite conclusive against its\r\nexistence; it is more to the point that the hundred moot seems to be the\r\nlowest stage reached by the descending series of national courts. It is\r\nprobable, therefore, that the ordinary township never possessed any\r\ncourt other than that which belonged to it in its manorial aspect.\r\n\r\nWe have seen enough to know that the jurisdictional and economic aspects\r\nof feudalism were intimately connected: the manorial court was the\r\nnormal complement of the average manor. No less closely associated in\r\npractice were the military and tenurial elements of the feudal system,\r\nand upon a superficial view of this system it is these latter elements\r\nwhich rise into greatest prominence. Nor is this altogether unjust, for,\r\nalthough it is not probable that any change induced by the Norman\r\nConquest so profoundly affected English social life as did the universal\r\nestablishment of private jurisdiction, yet the introduction of military\r\ntenures, and the creation of a feudal army rooted in the soil of\r\nEngland, are phenomena of the first importance, and the form which they\r\nassumed in the course of the next century was due in essence to the\r\npersonal action of the Conqueror himself, and to the political\r\nnecessities of his position.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which England had been conquered had demonstrated\r\nclearly enough the inefficiency of the Anglo-Saxon military system, and\r\nthe changes introduced in this matter by King William were\r\nrevolutionary, both in details and in principle. The military force at\r\nthe disposal of Edward the Confessor had consisted of two parts: first,\r\nthe fyrd or native militia, based on the primitive liability of every\r\nfree man to serve for the defence of his county, and secondly a body of\r\nhousecarles, professional men-at-arms, who served for pay and were\r\ntherefore under better discipline and available for longer periods of\r\nservice than the rustic soldiery of the shires. There is no good\r\nevidence to prove that the Anglo-Saxon thegn was burdened with any\r\nmilitary obligation other than that which rested on him as a free man,\r\nbut there are certain passages which suggest that, in the latter days of\r\nthe old English state, the king in practice would only call out one man\r\nfrom each five hides of land, and that he would hold his more powerful\r\nsubjects responsible for the due appearance of their dependants. If this\r\nwere an attempt to create a small but efficient host out of the great\r\nbody of the fyrd, it came too late to save the situation and, so far as\r\nour evidence goes, it was the professional housecarles who bore the\r\nbrunt of the great battles of 1066. By derivation at least the\r\nhousecarle must have been a man who dwelt in his lord’s house as a\r\npersonal retainer; and, although we know that men of this class had\r\nreceived grants of land from the last native kings, there is no reason\r\nto believe that their holdings were conditional on their services, or\r\nindeed that they were other than personal marks of favour, quite\r\nunconnected with the military duty of the recipient.\r\n\r\nThe essential features of the Norman system were entirely different to\r\nthis. Each tenant in chief of the crown, as the condition on which he\r\nheld his lands, was required to maintain, equip, and hold ready for\r\nimmediate service a definite number of knights, and the extent of his\r\nliability in this matter was not, save in the roughest sense,\r\nproportional to his territorial position, but was determined solely by\r\nthe will of the king. Transactions of this kind most probably took place\r\nat the moment when each tenant in chief was put into possession of his\r\nfief, and their observance on the part of the grantee was guaranteed by\r\nthe penalty of total forfeiture in the event of his appearance at the\r\nking’s muster with less than his full complement of knights. His\r\nmilitary liability once ascertained, a tenant would commonly proceed to\r\nenfeof some of his knights on portions of his estate, keeping the\r\nremainder in attendance on his person. As time went on the number of\r\nlandless knights continually became less and less, and by the end of the\r\nConqueror’s reign, the greater part of every fief was divided into\r\nknight’s fees, whose holders were bound by the circumstances of their\r\ntenure to serve with their lord in the discharge of the military service\r\nwhich he owed the crown. No definite quantity of land, measured either\r\nby assessment or value, constituted the knight’s fee; but, judging from\r\nthe evidence of a later period, it seems certain that each tenant in\r\nchief was burdened with the service of a round number of knights,\r\ntwenty, thirty, or the like, and it is quite possible that these round\r\nfigures were influenced by the Norman _constabularia_ of ten knights, a\r\nmilitary unit which we know to have prevailed across the Channel before\r\nthe conquest of England.[319]\r\n\r\nBut the work of subinfeudation once started, no limit in theory or\r\npractice was ever set to it in England, and in the earliest period of\r\nNorman rule we find knights, who held of a tenant-in-chief, subletting\r\npart of their land to other knights and the latter continuing the\r\nprocess at their own pleasure. In Leicestershire, for example, the vill\r\nof Lubbenham was held of the king by the archbishop of York, and had\r\nbeen let by him to a certain Walchelin, who had enfeoffed with it a man\r\nof his own called Robert, who had granted three carucates of land in the\r\nmanor to an unnamed knight as his tenant. But this is an exceptional\r\ncase, for it is unusual for Domesday to reveal more than two lords in\r\nascending order between the peasant and the king. A process of the same\r\nkind had not been unknown in England in the time of King Edward;\r\nchurches had been leasing land to their thegns; and thegns, whom a\r\nNorman lawyer would consider to hold of the king, had been capable of\r\nsubletting their estates to their dependants. But the legal principles\r\nwhich underlay dependant land tenure had never been worked out in\r\nEngland, as they had been elaborated in Normandy before the Conquest,\r\nand in two important respects at least there was a marked difference\r\nbetween the old and the new system. On the one hand it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether Anglo-Saxon law had developed the idea that all land,\r\nnot in the king’s immediate possession, was held directly or indirectly\r\nof the crown; and in the second place the old English system of land\r\ntenure was far slacker and less coherent than its Norman rival. Domesday\r\nBook contains frequent references to men who could leave one lord and\r\nseek another at will, and this want of stability in what was perhaps the\r\nmost important division of private law meant a corresponding weakness in\r\nthe whole of the Anglo-Saxon body politic. Here as elsewhere the Norman\r\nwork made for cohesion, permanence, and theoretical consistency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOGRAPH SIGNATURES TO WINDSOR AGREEMENT]\r\n\r\nIt was also an innovation upon accepted practice that the Conqueror\r\nextended to ecclesiastical estates the military responsibilities which\r\nhe imposed upon lay fiefs. Long before the Confessor’s time, the\r\nchurches had been subletting land to their thegns on condition that the\r\nlatter should do the military service which the said churches owed to\r\nthe king; but the duty in question merely represented the amount of fyrd\r\nservice due from the lands of each religious house, and was in no sense\r\nthe result of any bargain between the king and the latter. On the other\r\nhand, the number of knights maintained by an ecclesiastical tenant of\r\nKing William depended in the last resort upon the terms which that\r\ntenant, whether bishop or monastery, had made with the new sovereign.\r\nThe Conqueror could not venture to dispossess a native religious house\r\nas he could dispossess a native thegn or earl; but he could insist that\r\nsuch a body should make its contribution towards the new army which he\r\nwas planting on the soil of England, and he could determine the minimum\r\namount of the contribution in each case. So far as our evidence goes,\r\nthe knight service demanded from a monastery was fixed in a much more\r\narbitrary manner than that imposed on a lay tenant; a baron’s military\r\nliabilities would greatly correspond in the main, though very roughly,\r\nwith the extent of his fief, but no principle of the kind can have been\r\napplied to the burden laid upon the church lands. The abbeys of\r\nPeterborough and Abingdon were bound to supply sixty and thirty knights\r\nrespectively, but St. Albans escaped with a _servitum debitum_ of six,\r\nand St. Benet of Hulme was only debited with three. It is more than\r\nprobable that political conditions went far towards producing these\r\nviolent discrepancies; a monastery, like Peterborough, which had\r\ndisplayed strong nationalist tendencies, might fairly enough be\r\npenalised by the imposition of a heavy burden of service towards the\r\nmaintenance of the foreign rule. On the other hand, the process in\r\nquestion was regarded in a very different light by the Norman abbots who\r\nwere gradually introduced in the course of the reign, and by the English\r\nmonks placed under their government. To the former the creation of\r\nknights’ fees meant a golden opportunity of providing for their\r\nnecessitous kinsmen beyond the Channel; to the latter the withdrawal of\r\nland from the immediate purposes of the church forboded an ultimate\r\nshrinkage in the daily supply of beef and beer. The local chronicler of\r\nAbingdon abbey tells us sorrowfully how Abbot Ethelhelm sent over into\r\nNormandy for his kinsmen, and invested them with the possessions of the\r\nmonastery to such an extent that in one year he granted seventy manors\r\nto them, which were still lacking to the church a hundred years later.\r\n\r\nReference should perhaps be made here to the difficult question of the\r\nactual numbers of the territorial army which rose at King William’s\r\nbidding upon the conquered land. In a matter of this kind the statements\r\nof professed chroniclers must be wholly ignored; they represent mere\r\nguesswork, and show a total insensibility to the military and\r\ngeographical possibilities of the case. Several attempts, based upon the\r\nsafer evidence of records, have recently been made to estimate the total\r\nnumber of knights whom the king had the right to summon to his banners\r\nat any given moment, and it is probable that the results of such\r\ninquiries represent a sufficiently close approximation to the truth of\r\nthe matter. On the whole, then, we may say that the total knight service\r\nof England was fixed at something near five thousand knights, of whom\r\n784 have been assigned to religious tenants-in-chief, 3534 have been set\r\ndown as the contribution of lay barons, the remainder representing the\r\nallowance properly to be made for the deficiencies in our sources of\r\ninformation.[320] The question is important, not only for the influence\r\nwhich tenure by knight service exercised on the later English land-law,\r\nbut also for its bearing upon the cognate problem of the numbers engaged\r\nin the battle of Hastings, which has already received discussion here.\r\n\r\nFrom knight service we may pass naturally enough to the kindred duty of\r\ncastle-guard. The castles which had arisen in England by the time of the\r\nConqueror’s death belong to one or other of two great classes. On the\r\none hand, there was the royal fortress, regarded as an element in the\r\nsystem of national defence, whether against foreign invasion or native\r\nrevolt; to the second class belong the castles which were merely the\r\nprivate residence of their lord. In castles of the former class, which\r\nwere mostly situated in boroughs and along the greater roadways, the\r\ngovernor was merely the king’s lieutenant; Henry de Beaumont and William\r\nPeverel were placed in command of the castles of Warwick and Nottingham\r\nrespectively, in order that they might hold those towns on the king’s\r\nbehalf. This being the case, it was only natural that garrison duty as\r\nwell as service in the field should be demanded from the knights whom\r\nthe barons of the neighbourhood were required to supply; the knights of\r\nthe abbot of Abingdon were required to go on guard at Windsor Castle. Of\r\nthe seventy castles which we may reasonably assume to have existed in\r\n1087, twenty-four belong to this class, and twenty of the latter are\r\nsituated in some borough or other, and this close connection of borough\r\nand royal castle is something more than a fortuitous circumstance. In\r\nAnglo-Saxon times, it is well ascertained that each normal borough had\r\nbeen the military centre of the district in which it lay, and had in\r\nfact been the natural base of operations in the work of local defence.\r\nThe Normans brought with them new ideas on the subject of defensive\r\nstrategy, but the geographical and economic conditions which gave to the\r\nboroughs their military importance in early times were not annulled by\r\nthe Norman Conquest; and it would still have been desirable to safeguard\r\nthe growing centres of trade from external attacks, even if it had not\r\nbeen expedient in Norman eyes to set a curb upon the national spirit\r\namong the dwellers in the English towns. No general rule can be laid\r\ndown as to the custody of these royal castles; it was not infrequent for\r\nthem to be held on the king’s behalf by the sheriff of the shire in\r\nwhich they might be situated, but the Conqueror would entrust his\r\nfortress to any noble of sufficient military skill and loyalty, and, as\r\nin the cases of Warwick and Nottingham, a tenure which was originally\r\nmere guardianship might pass in the course of time into direct\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe larger class of private castles is less important from the\r\ninstitutional standpoint. In Normandy the duke had the right to garrison\r\nthe castles of his nobility with troops of his own, but the Conqueror\r\ndoes not seem to have extended this principle to England. It is very\r\nprobable that he would insist on his own consent being given to any\r\nprojected fortification on the part of his feudatories, but so long as\r\nhis rule was threatened by English revolt, rather than by Norman\r\ndisloyalty, he would not be greatly concerned to limit the\r\ncastle-building tendencies of his followers. On the Welsh border, for\r\nexample, where the creation of a strong line of castles was an essential\r\npart of the business of frontier defence, the work of fortification must\r\nlargely have been left to the discretion of the earls of Shrewsbury and\r\nChester, and to the enterprise of the first generation of marcher lords.\r\nEast of a line drawn north and south through Gloucester, lie nearly half\r\nof the total number of castles which we can infer to have been built\r\nduring the Conqueror’s reign, but only fourteen of them were in private\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nUnderneath all these violent changes in the higher departments of the\r\nmilitary art, the old native institution of the fyrd lived on. Two years\r\nafter Hastings, at the dangerous crisis occasioned by the revolt of\r\nExeter, we find the Conqueror calling out the local militia, and at\r\nintervals during his reign the national force continues to be summoned,\r\nnot only by the king but by his lieutenants, such as Geoffrey of\r\nCoutances at the time of the relief of Montacute. It is not necessary to\r\nassume that William had prescience of a day when an English levy might\r\nbe a useful counterbalance to a feudal host in rebellion; he inherited\r\nthe military as well as the financial and judiciary powers of his\r\nkinsman King Edward, and obedience would naturally be paid to his\r\nsummons by everybody who did not wish to be treated as a rebel on the\r\nspot. It does not seem that the Conqueror materially altered the\r\nconstitution or equipment of the fyrd; in fact he had no need to do\r\nthis, for its organisation and armament, obsolete as they were in\r\ncomparison with those of the feudal army, still enabled it to fight with\r\nrevolted Englishmen or Scotch raiders on more or less of an equality.\r\nFor the serious business of a campaign the Conqueror would rely on the\r\nsmall but efficient force of knights at his command, and it is to be\r\nnoted that no barrier of racial prejudice prevented the absorption of\r\nEnglishmen of sufficient standing into the knightly class. The number of\r\nEnglishmen who are entered in Domesday Book, on a level with the Norman\r\ntenants of a great baron, is considerable, and it is by no means\r\nimprobable that, below the surface of our records, a process had been\r\ngoing on which had robbed the heterogeneous militia of King Edward’s day\r\nof its wealthier and more efficient elements. Many a thegn who would\r\nformerly have joined the muster of his shire with an equipment little,\r\nif at all, superior to that of the peasantry of his neighbourhood, will\r\nhave received his land as the undertenant of some baron, and have\r\nlearned to adopt the military methods of his Norman fellows. We cannot\r\ndefine with accuracy the stages by which this process did its work, but\r\nwhen the time came for Henry II. to reorganise the local militia, it was\r\nwith a force of yeomen and burgesses that he had to deal.\r\n\r\nWe have now given a brief examination to the main departments of\r\nadministration, military and political, as they existed under the\r\nConqueror. Two general conclusions may perhaps be suggested as a result\r\nof our survey. The first is that, throughout the field of government,\r\nrevolutionary changes in all essential matters have been taking place\r\nunder a specious continuity of external forms. The second is, that the\r\nConqueror’s work is in no respect final; the shock of his conquest had\r\nwrecked the obsolescent organisation of the old English state, but the\r\ndevelopment of the new order on which his rule was founded was a task\r\nreserved for his descendants. The _Curia Regis_, which attended King\r\nWilliam as he passed over his dominions, was a body the like of which\r\nhad not been seen in King Edward’s day, but it was a body very unlike\r\nthe group of trained administrators who transacted the business of\r\ngovernment under the presidency of Henry II. The feudal host in England\r\nowed its being to the Conqueror, but no sooner was it firmly seated on\r\nthe land than the introduction of scutage under Henry I. meant that the\r\nking would henceforth only allow the Conqueror’s host to survive in so\r\nfar as it might subserve the purposes of the royal exchequer. King\r\nWilliam’s destructive work had been carried out with unexampled\r\nthoroughness, order, and rapidity, but it was inevitable that the\r\nprocess of reconstruction which he began should far outrun the narrow\r\nlimits of any single life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of William I.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 296:\r\n\r\n  _Easter_, 1069: King William; Matilda, the Queen; Richard, the King’s\r\n  son; Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury; Ealdred, archbishop of York;\r\n  William, bishop of London; Ethelric, bishop of Selsey; Herman, bishop\r\n  of Thetford; Giso, bishop of Wells; Leofric, bishop of Exeter; Odo,\r\n  bishop of Bayeux; Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances; Baldwin, bishop of\r\n  Evreux; Arnold, bishop of Le Mans; Count Robert (of Mortain), Earl\r\n  William Fitz Osbern, Count Robert of Eu, Earl Ralf (of Norfolk?),\r\n  Brian of Penthievre, Fulk de Alnou, Henry de Ferrers; Hugh de\r\n  Montfort, Richard the son of Count Gilbert, Roger d’ Ivri, Hamon the\r\n  Steward, Robert, Hamon’s brother.—Tardif, _Archives de l’Empire_, 179.\r\n\r\n  _Christmas_, 1077: King William; Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury;\r\n  Thomas, archbishop of York; Odo, bishop of Bayeux; Hugh, bishop of\r\n  London; Walkelin, bishop of Winchester; Remi, bishop of Lincoln;\r\n  Maurice, the chancellor; Vitalis, abbot of Westminster; Scotland,\r\n  abbot of Ch.

It is probable that if due\r\nregard be paid to the conditions of its execution Domesday Book may\r\nclaim to rank as the greatest record of medieval Europe; certainly it\r\ndeserves such preference among the legal documents of England. For,\r\nwhile we admire the systematic treatment which the great survey accords\r\nto county after county, we must also remember that no sovereign before\r\nWilliam could have had the power to draw such wealth of information from\r\nall England between the Channel and the Tees; and that the thousands of\r\ndry figures which are deliberately accumulated in the pages of Domesday\r\nrepresent the result of the greatest catastrophe which has ever affected\r\nthe national history. Domesday Book, indeed, has no peer, because it was\r\nthe product of unique circumstances. Other conquerors have been as\r\npowerful as William, and as exigent of their royal rights; no other\r\nconqueror has so consistently regarded himself as the strict successor\r\nof the native kings who were before him; above all, no other conqueror\r\nhas been at pains to devise a record of the order of things which he\r\nhimself destroyed, nor even, like William, of so much of it as was\r\nrelevant to the more efficient conduct of his own administration.\r\nDomesday Book is the perfect expression of the Norman genius for the\r\ndetails of government.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that William had no intention of enlightening\r\nposterity as to the social and economic condition of his kingdom. His\r\naim was severely practical. How it struck a contemporary may be gathered\r\nfrom that well-known passage in which the Peterborough chronicler opens\r\nthe long series of commentaries on Domesday by recording his impressions\r\nof the actual survey:\r\n\r\n  “After this the king held a great council and very deep speech with\r\n  his wise men about this land, how it was peopled and by what men. Then\r\n  he sent his men into every shire all over England and caused it to be\r\n  ascertained how many hundred hides were in the shire and what land the\r\n  king had, and what stock on the land, and what dues he ought to have\r\n  each year from the shire. Also he caused it to be written, how much\r\n  land his archbishops, bishops, abbots, and earls had, and (though I\r\n  may be somewhat tedious in my account) what or how much each\r\n  land-holder in England had in land or in stock and how much money it\r\n  might be worth. So minutely did he cause it to be investigated that\r\n  there was not one hide or yard of land, nor even (it is shameful to\r\n  write of it though he thought it not shameful to do it) an ox nor a\r\n  cow or swine that was not set down in his writ. And all the writings\r\n  were brought to him afterwards.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PORTION OF A PAGE OF DOMESDAY BOOK\r\n  (THE BEGINNING OF THE BERKSHIRE SECTION)]\r\n\r\nOpinion at Peterborough was clearly adverse to the survey, and Florence\r\nof Worcester tells us that the proceedings of the king’s commissioners\r\ncaused riots in various parts of England. The exact scope of the\r\ninformation demanded by the commissioners cannot be better expressed\r\nthan in the words of a writer belonging to the neighbouring abbey of\r\nEly, who took an independent copy of the returns made to those officers\r\nconcerning the lands of his monastery, and describes the nature of the\r\ninquiry thus:\r\n\r\n  “This is the description of the inquiry concerning the lands, which\r\n  the king’s barons made, according to the oath of the sheriff of the\r\n  shire and of all the barons and their Frenchmen and of the whole\r\n  hundred-court—the priests, reeves and six villeins from every vill. In\r\n  the first place [they required] the name of the manor; who held it in\r\n  the time of King Edward, and who holds it now, how many hides [_hidæ_]\r\n  are there, how many ploughs in demesne and how many belonging to the\r\n  men, how many villeins, cottars, slaves, freemen and sokemen; how much\r\n  woodland, meadow and pasture, how many mills and fisheries; how much\r\n  has been added to or taken from the estate, how much the whole used to\r\n  be worth, and how much it is worth now; and how much each freeman or\r\n  sokeman had or has there. All this thrice over; with reference to the\r\n  time of King Edward, and to the time when King William gave the land\r\n  and to the present time; and if more can be got out of it than is\r\n  being drawn now.”[321]\r\n\r\nNow, although the fact may not appear on a first reading of these\r\npassages, all these details were entirely subsidiary to one main\r\nobject—the exact record of the local distribution of the king’s “geld”\r\nor Danegeld, the one great direct tax levied on the whole of England.\r\nDomesday is essentially a financial document; it is a noteworthy example\r\nof that insistence on their fiscal rights which was eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the Anglo-Norman kings, and was the chief reason why\r\nthey were able to build up the strongest government in Western Europe.\r\nEvery fact recorded in Domesday bears some reference, direct or\r\nindirect, to the payment of the Danegeld, for the king’s commissioners\r\nknew their business, and the actual scribes who arranged the results of\r\nthe survey were remorseless in rejecting all details which did not fit\r\ninto the general scheme of their undertaking. It should not escape\r\nobservation that this fact prepares many subtle pitfalls for those who\r\nwould draw a picture of English society based on the materials supplied\r\nby Domesday; but more of this will be said later, for there are certain\r\nquestions of history and terminology which demand attention at the\r\noutset.\r\n\r\nThe most important of those points is the meaning of those “hides,”\r\nwhich are mentioned in both of the above extracts. This, indeed, is the\r\nessential clue to the interpretation of Domesday, and it is\r\nunfortunately very elusive, for the term can be traced back to a very\r\nearly period of Anglo-Saxon history and more than one meaning came to be\r\nattached to it in the course of its long history. When we first meet the\r\n“hide,” the word seems to denote the amount of land which was sufficient\r\nfor the support of a normal household; it is the average holding of the\r\nordinary free man of Anglo-Saxon law. This much is reasonably certain,\r\nbut difficulties crowd in upon us when we attempt to estimate the\r\ncapacity of the hide in terms of acreage. Much discussion has arisen\r\nabout this point, but we may say that at present there are two main\r\ntheories on the subject, one assigning to the hide one hundred and\r\ntwenty acres of arable land, the other some much smaller quantity, such\r\nas forty-eight or thirty acres, in either case with sufficient\r\nappurtenances in wood, water, and pasture for the maintenance of the\r\nplough and its oxen. Just now the prevailing view seems to be that the\r\nareal capacity of the hide may have varied from county to county—that,\r\nfor instance, while we know that in the eleventh century the hide stood\r\nat one hundred and twenty acres in Cambridgeshire and Essex, it may not\r\nimprobably have contained forty-eight acres in Wiltshire. Important, or\r\nrather vital, as is the question for students of Anglo-Saxon history, it\r\ndoes not concern us to quite the same extent, and we must pass on to a\r\nchange which came over men’s conception of this tenement and intimately\r\naffects the study of Domesday.\r\n\r\nOur normal free householder, the man who held a “hide” in the seventh\r\ncentury, was burdened with many duties towards the tribal state to which\r\nhe belonged. He had to serve in the local army, the fyrd, to keep the\r\nroads and bridges in his neighbourhood in repair, to help to maintain\r\nthe strong places of his district as a refuge in time of invasion, and\r\nto contribute towards the support of the local king or ealdorman. Out of\r\nthese elements, and especially the last, was developed a rudimentary\r\nmilitary and financial system which is recorded in certain ancient\r\ndocuments which have come down to us from the Anglo-Saxon period, and\r\ndeserve our attention as the direct ancestors of Domesday Book. They may\r\nbe described as a series of attempts to express, in terms of hides, the\r\ncapacity of the several districts of England with which they deal, for\r\npurposes of tribute or defence. The eldest of these documents, which is\r\nnow generally known as the Tribal Hidage,[322] is a record of which the\r\ndate cannot be fixed within a century and a half, while very much of its\r\ntext is quite unintelligible, but in form it is clear enough. It\r\nconsists of a string of names with numbers of hides attached; thus, the\r\ndwellers in the Peak are assigned 1200 hides, the dwellers in Elmet 600,\r\nthe Kentishmen 15,000, and the Hwiccas 7000. Now, it is obvious that all\r\nthese are round numbers, as in fact are all the figures occurring in the\r\ndocument; and this is a point of considerable importance, for it implies\r\nthat the distribution of hides recorded in this early list was a matter\r\nof rough estimate, rather than of computation, since we cannot suppose\r\nthat there were just 1200 free householders in the Peak of Derbyshire,\r\nnor exactly 15,000 in Kent. These figures are intended to represent\r\napproximately the respective strength of such districts, and are\r\nexpressed in even thousands or hundreds because numbers of this kind\r\nwill be easy to handle, a practice which we can see to be inevitable,\r\nfor a barbarian king of the time of Beda would be a very unlikely person\r\nto institute statistical inquiries as to the exact number of hides under\r\nhis “supremacy.” But the point that concerns us is, as we shall see\r\nlater, that the distribution of hides in Domesday, for all its\r\nappearance of statistical precision, is in reality just as much a matter\r\nof estimate and compromise as was the rough reckoning which is recorded\r\nin the Tribal Hidage.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply equally to the next document in the series of fiscal\r\nrecords which leads up to Domesday. Probably in the reign of Edward the\r\nElder, when Wessex was recovering from the strain of the great Danish\r\ninvasion, some scribe drew up a list of strong places or “burhs,” mostly\r\nin that country, with the number of hides assigned to the maintenance of\r\neach, and here again we find round figures resembling those which we\r\nhave noticed in the Tribal Hidage.[323] In this way 700 hides are said\r\nto belong to Shaftesbury, 600 to Langport, 100 to Lyng. Apparently the\r\nwise men of Wessex have decreed that an even number of hides, roughly\r\nproportional to the area to be defended, should be assigned to the\r\nupkeep of each of those “burhs,” and have left the men of each district\r\nto settle the incidence of burden among themselves. It will be seen that\r\nthe system on which this document (which is conveniently called the\r\n“Burghal Hidage”) is based is much more artificial than that represented\r\nin the Tribal Hidage—in the latter we are dealing with “folks” or\r\n“tribes,” if the word be not expressed too strictly; here we have\r\nconventional districts, the extent of which is evidently determined by\r\nexternal authority. This being so, it becomes possible to make certain\r\nsuggestive comparisons between the Burghal Hidage and Domesday Book.\r\nThus the former assigns 2400 hides to Oxford and Wallingford,\r\nrespectively, and 1200 to Worcester; and if we count up the number of\r\nhides which are entered in the Domesday surveys of Oxfordshire,\r\nBerkshire and Worcestershire, we shall find that in all three cases the\r\ntotal will come very near to the number of hides assigned to the towns\r\nwhich represent these shires in the Burghal Hidage; the correspondence\r\nbeing much too close to be the result of chance. Hence, if the\r\ndistribution of hides in the Burghal Hidage is artificial, we should be\r\nprepared for the conclusion that the similar distribution in Domesday is\r\nartificial also.\r\n\r\nA century passed, and England was again being invaded by the Danes. In\r\nthe vain hope of buying off the importunate enemy the famous Danegeld\r\nwas levied, originally as an emergency tax, but one which was destined\r\nto be raised, at first sporadically, and then at regular intervals until\r\nthe end of the twelfth century. This new impost must, one would suppose,\r\nhave called for a re-statement of the old Hidages, but no such record\r\nhas come down to us. On the other hand we possess a list of counties\r\nwith their respective Hidages annexed, which is generally known as the\r\n“County Hidage,” and assigned to the first half of the eleventh century.\r\nThis document[324] forms a link between the Burghal Hidage and Domesday;\r\nfor, while it agrees with the older record in the figures which it gives\r\nfor Worcestershire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire, its estimate\r\napproximates very closely to the Domesday assessment of Staffordshire,\r\nGloucestershire, and Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nAnd so we come to the Norman Conquest. At the very beginning of his\r\nreign, William, undeterred by the legend of his saintly predecessor, who\r\nhad seen the devil sitting on the money bags, and had therefore\r\nabolished the Danegeld, laid on the people a geld exceeding stiff. At\r\nintervals during his reign a “geld” was imposed: in particular, in 1083,\r\nhe raised a tax of seventy-two pence on the hide, the normal rate being\r\nonly two shillings. It is not improbable that the grievance caused by\r\nthis heavy tax may have been one chief reason why Domesday Book was\r\ncompiled. We have seen enough to know that the system of assessment\r\nwhich underlies Domesday was, in principle at least, very ancient. It\r\nmust have become very inequitable, for mighty changes had passed over\r\nEngland even in the century preceding the Conquest. We know that William\r\nhad tried to rectify matters by drastic reductions of hidage in the case\r\nof individual counties, and it is by no means improbable that the\r\nDomesday Inquest was intended to be the preliminary to a sweeping\r\nrevision of the whole national system of assessment. William died before\r\nhe could undertake this, and so far as we know it was never attempted\r\nafterwards, for it has been pointed out that in 1194 the ransom of\r\nRichard I. was raised in certain counties according to the Domesday\r\nassessment.[325] This rigidity of the artificial old system makes its\r\ndetails especially worthy of study, for it is strange to see a fiscal\r\narrangement which can be traced back to the time of Alfred still capable\r\nof being utilised in the days of Richard I. and Hubert Walter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PORTION OF A PAGE OF DOMESDAY BOOK\r\n  (THE BEGINNING OF THE BERKSHIRE SECTION)]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the main features of this system? Much of its vitality,\r\ncumbrous and unequal as it was, may doubtless be ascribed to the fact\r\nthat it was based on the ancient local divisions of the country, the\r\nshires, wapentakes or hundreds, and vills. Put into other words, the\r\ndistribution of the hides which we find in Domesday is the result of an\r\nelaborate series of subdivisions. At some indefinitely distant date, it\r\nhas been decreed that each county shall be considered to contain a\r\ncertain definite number of hides, that Bedfordshire, for example, shall\r\nbe considered to contain—that is, shall be assessed at—1200 hides. The\r\nmen of Bedfordshire, then, in their shire court, proceeded to distribute\r\nthese 1200 hides among the twelve “hundreds” into which the county was\r\ndivided, paying no detailed attention to the area or population of each\r\nhundred, nor even, so far as can be seen, obeying any rule which would\r\nmake a hundred answer for exactly one hundred hides, but following their\r\nown rough ideas as to how much of their total assessment of their county\r\neach hundred should be called upon to bear. The assessment of the\r\nhundreds being thus determined, the next step was to divide out the\r\nnumber of hides cast upon each hundred among the various vills of which\r\nit was composed, the division continuing to be made without any\r\nreference to value or area. And then the artificiality of the whole\r\nsystem is borne in upon us by the most striking fact—the discovery of\r\nwhich revolutionised the study of Domesday Book—that in the south and\r\nwest of England the overwhelming majority of vills are assessed in some\r\nfraction or multiple of five hides.[326] The ubiquity of this “five-hide\r\nunit” is utterly irreconcilable with any theory which would make the\r\nDomesday hide consist of any definite amount of land; a vill might\r\ncontain six or twenty real, arable hides, scattered over its fields,\r\nbut, if it agreed with the scheme of distribution followed by the men of\r\nthe county in the shire and hundred courts, that vill would pay Danegeld\r\non five hides all the same. The Domesday system of assessment, then, was\r\nnot the product of local conditions but was arbitrarily imposed from\r\nabove. The hide was not only a measure of land, but also a fiscal term,\r\ndissociated from all necessary correspondence with fact.\r\n\r\nBut, before passing to further questions of terminology, it will be well\r\nto give some instances of the application of the “five-hide unit,” and,\r\nas Bedfordshire has been specially referred to above, we may take our\r\nexamples from that county. Accordingly, if with the aid of a map we\r\nfollow the course of the Ouse through Bedfordshire, we shall pass near\r\nto Odell, Risely, and Radwell, assessed at ten hides each; Thurghley and\r\nOakley at five; Pavenham, Stagsden, Cardington, Willington, Cople, and\r\nNorthill at ten; Blunham at fifteen; Tempsford at ten; Roxton at twenty;\r\nChawston at ten; Wyboston at twenty, and Eaton Socon at forty. Thus,\r\nwithin a narrow strip of one county we have found seventeen instances of\r\nthis method of assessment, and there is no need to multiply cases in\r\npoint. On almost every page of the survey in which we read of hides, we\r\nmay find them combined in conventional groups of five, ten, or the like.\r\n\r\nNot all England, however, was assessed in hides; three other systems of\r\nrating are to be found in the country. In Kent, the first county entered\r\nin Domesday Book, a peculiar system prevailed in which the place of the\r\nhide was taken by the “sulung,” consisting of four “yokes” (_iugera_),\r\nand most probably containing two hundred and forty acres, thus equalling\r\na double hide.[327] The existence of the sulung in Kent as a term of\r\nland measurement can be traced back to the time when that county was an\r\nindependent kingdom; the process by which the word came to denote a\r\nmerely fiscal unit was doubtless analogous to the similar development\r\nwhich we have noticed in the case of the “hide.” Taken in conjunction\r\nwith the singular local divisions of Kent, and with the well-known\r\npeculiarities of land tenure found there, this plan of reckoning by\r\n“sulungs” instead of hides falls into place as a proper survival of the\r\nindependent organisation of the county.\r\n\r\nAnother ancient kingdom also preserves an unusual form of assessment in\r\nDomesday. In East Anglia we get for once a statement in arithmetical\r\nterms as to the amount which each vill must contribute to the Danegeld.\r\nInstead of being told that there are, say, five hides in a vill, and\r\nbeing left to draw the conclusion that that vill must pay ten shillings\r\nor more according to the rate at which the Danegeld is being levied on\r\nthe hide, we are given the amount which each vill must pay when the\r\nhundred in which it is situated pays twenty shillings. This form of\r\nsliding scale is unknown outside Norfolk and Suffolk, and is even more\r\nobviously artificial than the assessment of other counties. Each hundred\r\nin East Anglia seems to have been divided into a varying number of\r\n“leets,”—and it has been suggested that each leet had to pay an equal\r\namount towards the Danegeld due from the hundred,[328] but the\r\nassessment of East Anglia in other respects presents some special\r\ndifficulties of its own, although they cannot be discussed here.\r\n\r\nOf much greater importance is the remaining fiscal unit to be found in\r\nDomesday. In Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire,\r\nLeicestershire, and Rutland all assessments are expressed in\r\n“carucates,” instead of hides, each carucate being composed of eight\r\nbovates, and each bovate containing, as is probable, fifteen (fiscal)\r\nacres. This distinction was remarked on in the twelfth century by Hugh\r\n“Candidus,” the historian of Peterborough, who says, “In Lincolnshire\r\nthere are no hides, as in other counties, but instead of hides there are\r\ncarucates of land, and they are worth the same as the hides.” It is\r\nevident that by derivation at least the Domesday _carucata terræ_ must\r\noriginally have meant a ploughland, that is, the amount of land capable\r\nof being tilled in one year by the great plough-team of eight oxen,\r\naccording to whatever system of agriculture may have then been current,\r\nand it is equally certain that the word “bovate” takes its derivation\r\nfrom the ox. But, just like the hide, the carucate, from denoting a\r\nmeasure of land, had come to mean an abstract fiscal quantity, subject\r\nto the same conditions of distribution as affected the former unit. This\r\nis proved by the fact that the carucates are found combined in the above\r\ncounties into artificial groups according to exactly the same principle\r\nas that which determined the distribution of hides in the south, with\r\none highly curious variation in detail. Whereas we have seen that in the\r\nsouth and west vills are nominally assessed at some multiple of five\r\nhides, in the north-eastern counties, with which we are now concerned,\r\nthe prevailing tendency is for the vills to be rated at some multiple or\r\nfraction of six carucates. Put in another way: the assessment of the\r\nsouth and west was decimal in character, that of the north and east was\r\nduodecimal; while we should expect a Berkshire vill to be rated at five,\r\nten, or fifteen hides, we must expect to find a Lincolnshire vill\r\nstanding at six, twelve, or eighteen carucates.[329] We have in this way\r\na “six-carucate unit,” to set beside and in distinction to the\r\n“five-hide unit,” which we have already considered.\r\n\r\nNow, these details become very significant when we consider the\r\ngeographical area within which these carucates are found combined after\r\nthis fashion. The district between the Welland and the Tees has a\r\nhistorical unity of its own. As was the case with East Anglia and Kent,\r\nfiscal peculiarities are accompanied in this quarter also by a\r\ndistinctive local organisation. The co-existence in this part of England\r\nof “Danish” place-names with local divisions such as the wapentake,\r\nwhich can be referred to northern influence, has always been considered\r\nas proving an extensive Scandinavian settlement to have taken place\r\nthere; and we can now reinforce this argument by pointing to the above\r\nfiscal peculiarities, which we know to be confined to this quarter and\r\nwhich are invaluable as enabling us to define with certainty the exact\r\nlimits of the territory which was actually settled by the Danes in the\r\ntenth century. In Denmark itself we find instances of the employment of\r\na duodecimal system of reckoning similar to that on which we have seen\r\nthe Domesday assessment of the above north-eastern counties to be based;\r\nand we may recognise in the latter the equivalent of the territory of\r\nthe “Five Boroughs” of Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, and\r\nStamford, together with the Danish kingdom of Deira (Yorkshire), across\r\nthe Humber.\r\n\r\nTedious as these details may well seem, the conclusions to which they\r\nlead us are by no means unimportant. In the first place, we see how such\r\nancient kingdoms as Kent, East Anglia and Deira, to which we may add the\r\nterritory of the Five Boroughs, preserved in their financial\r\narrangements many relics of their former independent organisation long\r\nafter they had lost all trace of political autonomy. And then in the\r\nsecond place we obtain a glimpse into the principles which governed the\r\npolicy of the Norman rulers of England towards native institutions.\r\nThese were not swept away wholesale; centralisation was only introduced\r\nwhere it was absolutely necessary, and so long as local arrangements\r\nsufficed to meet the financial needs of the crown, they were not\r\ninterfered with. Here, as elsewhere, it was not the policy of William or\r\nof his successors to disturb the ancient organisation of the country,\r\nfor it could well be adapted to the purposes of a king who was strong\r\nenough to make his government a reality over the whole land, and in this\r\nrespect the Conqueror and his sons need have no fear.\r\n\r\nIn the above account we have considered the Domesday system of\r\nassessment in its simplest possible form, but certain complications must\r\nnow receive notice. In the first place the plan on which the survey\r\nitself is drawn up places difficulties in our way, for it represents a\r\nkind of compromise between geographical and tenurial principles. Thus,\r\neach county is entered separately in Domesday, but within the shire all\r\nestates are classified according to the tenant-in-chief to whom they\r\nbelonged, and not according to the hundred or other local division in\r\nwhich they are situated. This is a fact to which we shall have again to\r\nrefer, but it will be evident that more than one tenant-in-chief might\r\nvery well hold land in the same vill, and this being the case, we can\r\nnever be sure, without reading through the entire survey of a county,\r\nthat we have obtained full particulars of any single vill contained in\r\nit. In other words, vill and manor were never of necessity identical,\r\nand in some parts of England, especially the north and east, such an\r\nequivalent was highly exceptional. In this way, therefore, in the\r\nall-important sphere of finance, the lowest point to which we can trace\r\nthe application of any consistent principle in the apportionment of the\r\n“geld” was not the manor, but the vill; and accordingly before we can\r\ndiscover the presence of those five-hide and six-carucate units, which\r\nhave just been described, we have often to combine a number of\r\nparticulars which, taken individually, do not suggest any system at all.\r\nTwo instances, one from Cambridgeshire and one from Derbyshire, will be\r\nin point here:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HASLINGFIELD (CAMBS.)[330]\r\n\r\n                                     Hides.

As to\r\nthe way in which the men of a vill apportioned their fiscal\r\nresponsibility, we are left almost entirely in the dark; the vill or\r\ntownship seems to have had no court of its own capable of deciding such\r\na matter. Largely, no doubt, it was a matter of tradition; a certain\r\nholding which had once answered for two hides would continue to do so,\r\nno matter into whose hands it might come, unless the assessment of the\r\nwhole vill were arbitrarily raised or lowered from without, when the\r\nassessment of this particular parcel of land would almost automatically\r\nbe affected in proportion. But these local matters do not come within\r\nthe scope of our slender stock of early fiscal authorities, and so we\r\nhear nothing about them.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to examine a normal entry from Domesday Book in\r\nthe light of the above conclusions. A Nottinghamshire manor will do very\r\nwell:\r\n\r\n  “M[anor]—In Hoveringham Swegn had two carucates of land and two\r\n  bovates assessed to the geld. There is land for four ploughs. There\r\n  Walter [de Aincurt] has in demesne two ploughs, and five sokemen on\r\n  three and a third bovates of this land, and nine villeins and three\r\n  bordars who have four ploughs. There is a priest and a church and two\r\n  mills rendering forty shillings, and forty acres of meadow. In King\r\n  Edward’s time it was worth £4; now it is worth the same and ten\r\n  shillings more.”\r\n\r\nWe ought first to see how each detail here fits into the general scheme\r\nof the survey. The statement as to the former owner of the manor was\r\nimportant; for, just as King William maintained that he was the lawful\r\nsuccessor of King Edward, so also he was determined that each of his men\r\nshould occupy in each manor which he might hold the exact legal position\r\nfilled by the Englishman or group of Englishmen, as the case might be,\r\nwhom he had dispossessed in that particular estate. In particular it was\r\nessential that he should take up his predecessor’s responsibility with\r\nreference to the “geld” due from his land, a point which is well brought\r\nout in the above entry, for Walter de Aincurt clearly is being debited\r\nwith the same number of carucates and bovates as were laid to the\r\naccount of “Swegn” before the Conquest. Probably fiscal in character\r\nalso is the statement which follows, to the effect that in Hoveringham\r\n“there is land for four ploughs.” For all its apparent simplicity, this\r\nformula, which is extremely common in the survey, presents upon\r\ninvestigation an extraordinary number of difficult complications. Taken\r\nsimply it would seem to denote the number of ploughs which could find\r\nemployment on the manor, and most probably it has such an agricultural\r\nsignificance in many counties, the argument in the mind of the\r\ncommissioners being: if this estate has land for more ploughs than are\r\nactually to be found there, it is undeveloped, and more “geld” may be\r\ngot out of it some day; if it is being cultivated to the full extent of\r\nits areal capacity or in excess of it (for this often happens) its\r\nassessment probably represents its agricultural condition well enough,\r\nand it may therefore stand. By making this inquiry about “ploughlands”\r\nthe commissioners are probably fulfilling the instruction which directed\r\nthem to find out whether the king was drawing the largest possible\r\namount from each manor, but great caution is needed before we decide\r\nthat they are obtaining this information in quite the same way from\r\nevery county surveyed. In one county, for example, the jurors may be\r\nstating the amount of land in their manor which has never been brought\r\nunder the plough at all; in another we may be given the total number of\r\nploughs, actual and potential, which could be employed in the estate; in\r\nyet a third the commissioners may have taken as an answer a statement of\r\nthe number of ploughs that had been going in the time of King Edward.\r\nThe commissioners are not in the least concerned with details about\r\nploughs and ploughlands merely as such; their interest is entirely\r\ncentred in a possible increase of the king’s dues from each manor\r\nsurveyed. But it is well to remember this fact, for it throws most\r\nserious difficulties in the way of any estimate of the agricultural\r\ncondition of England in the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nMore straightforward are the details which follow in our entry. It will\r\nbe seen that the scribes have marked a distinction between three\r\ndivisions of the land of the vill: first the lord’s demesne, then the\r\nland held of him by sokemen, then the holdings of the villeins and\r\nbordars. That such a distinction should be made was in accordance with\r\nthe instruction given to the commissioners by which they were directed\r\nto find out not only how many ploughs were in demesne and on the\r\nvilleins’ land respectively, but also how much each free man and sokeman\r\nin the manor possessed. These latter are so entered, not necessarily\r\nbecause they were more definitely responsible for their share of the\r\nmanorial Danegeld[332] than were the villeins and bordars for their own\r\nportion, but largely no doubt because they were less directly under\r\nmanorial control. We have seen that the sokemen and free men of Domesday\r\nmost probably represent social classes which have survived the Conquest,\r\nand are rapidly becoming modified to suit the stricter conditions of\r\nland tenure which the Conquest produced. But in Domesday the process is\r\nnot yet complete; the sokeman is still a somewhat independent member of\r\nthe manorial economy, and as such it is desirable to indicate exactly\r\nthe place which he fills in each estate. But that this part of the\r\ninquiry was not essential is proved by the fact that the holdings of the\r\nsokemen, whether in ploughs or land, are usually combined with those of\r\nthe villeins and bordars, even in the surveys of the eastern counties,\r\nwhere the free population was strongest.\r\n\r\nThe communistic system of agriculture is sufficiently well brought out\r\nin this entry; the four plough teams which the men of Hoveringham\r\npossessed, so far as we can see, were composed of oxen supplied by\r\nsokemen, villeins, and bordars alike, and the survey is not careful to\r\ntell us what proportion of the thirty-two oxen implied in these teams\r\nwas supplied by each of the above three classes. We should beware of the\r\nassumption that the sokemen of Domesday were invariably wealthier than\r\nthe villeins; we know little enough about the economic position of\r\neither class, but we know enough to see that many a sokeman of the\r\nConqueror’s time possessed much less land than was considered in the\r\nthirteenth century to be the normal holding of a villein. In the entry\r\nwe have chosen we can see that the average number of oxen possessed by\r\neach man in the vill is something under two; and we may suspect that the\r\nthree bordars owned no oxen, at all; but although the possession of\r\nplough oxen may here and there have been taken as a line of definition\r\nbetween rural classes, we cannot be sure that this is so everywhere,\r\ncertainly we cannot assume that it is the case here.[333]\r\n\r\nAfter its enumeration of the several classes of peasantry, with their\r\nagricultural equipment, the survey will commonly proceed to deal with\r\ncertain incidental sources of manorial revenue; in the present case the\r\nchurch, the mills, and the meadow. Even in the eleventh century the\r\nrelations between the lord of a manor and the church on his estate bear\r\na proprietary character; the lord in most cases possesses the right of\r\nadvowson and he can make gifts from the tithes of his manor to a\r\nreligious house for the good of his individual soul. The village church\r\nand the village mill were both in their several ways sources of profit\r\nto the lord, and in the case we have chosen it will be noted that nearly\r\nhalf the value assigned to the manor by the Domesday jurors is derived\r\nfrom the proceeds of the latter. “Mill soke,” the right of the lord to\r\ncompel his tenants to grind their corn at his mill, long continued to be\r\na profitable feature of the manorial organisation. The peculiar value of\r\nthe meadow lay in the necessity of providing keep for the plough-oxen\r\nover and above the food which they obtained by grazing the fallow\r\nportion of the village lands. The distribution of meadow land along the\r\nrivers and streams of a county determines to a great extent the relative\r\nvalue of the vills contained in it.[334]\r\n\r\nThe value which is assigned to a manor in Domesday Book seems to\r\nrepresent, as a general rule, a rough estimate of the rent which the\r\nestate would bring in to its lord if he let it on lease, stocked as it\r\nwas with men and cattle. In general it is probable that the jurors were\r\nrequired to make such an estimate with regard to three periods, namely,\r\n1066, 1086, and the time when King William gave the manor to its\r\nexisting owner. The last estimate, however, is frequently omitted from\r\nthe completed survey; but it is included often enough for us to be able\r\nto say that the disorder which attended the Conquest was commonly\r\naccompanied by a sharp depreciation in the value of agricultural land;\r\nand in many counties manorial values in general had failed to rise to\r\ntheir pre-Conquest level in the twenty years between 1066 and 1086. If\r\nthe whole of England be taken into account, it has been computed that\r\nthe average value of the hide or carucate will be very close to one\r\npound, and the Nottinghamshire manor we are considering is sufficiently\r\ntypical in this respect. But it must be remembered that the jurors on\r\nmaking their estimate of value would certainly have to take into\r\nconsideration sources of local revenue which were not agricultural in\r\ncharacter, and the tallage of the peasantry and the profits of the\r\nmanorial court will be included in one round figure, together with the\r\nvalue of the labour services of the villeins and the rent of mills and\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nOur attempt to understand the terms employed in a typical entry may\r\nserve to introduce us to a matter of universal importance, the\r\nindefiniteness of Domesday. We are not using this word as a term of\r\nreproach. The compilers of Domesday had to deal with a vast mass of most\r\nintractable material, and the marvel is that they should have given so\r\nsplendid an account of their task. But for all that, it is often a most\r\nformidable business to define even some of the commonest terms used in\r\nDomesday. It has been shown, for instance, that the word _manerium_,\r\nwhich we can only translate by “manor,” was used in the vaguest of\r\nsenses. It may denote one estate rated at one hundred hides, and another\r\nrated at eighty acres; most manors will contain a certain amount of land\r\n“in demesne,” but there are numerous instances in which the whole manor\r\nis being held of a lord by the peasantry; in the south of England the\r\narea of a manor will very frequently coincide with that of the vill from\r\nwhich it takes its name, but then again there may very well be as many\r\nas ten manors in one vill, while a single manor may equally well extend\r\nover half a dozen vills. In many cases the vague impression left by\r\nDomesday is due to the indefiniteness of its subject-matter—if we find\r\nit hard to distinguish a free man from a sokeman this is in great\r\nmeasure due to the fact that these classes in all probability did really\r\noverlap and intersect each other. Just so if we cannot be quite sure\r\nwhat the compilers of our record meant when they called one man a\r\n“bordar” and another man a “villein,” we must remember that it would not\r\nbe easy to give an exact definition of a “cottager” at the present day;\r\nand also that the villein class which covered more than half of the\r\nrural population of England cannot possibly have possessed uniform\r\nstatus, wealth, privileges, and duties over this vast area. But there\r\nexists another cause of confusion which is solely due to the\r\nidiosyncrasies of the Domesday scribes, and that is their inveterate\r\npropensity for using different words and phrases to mean the same thing.\r\nThus when they wish to note that a certain man could not “commend” his\r\nland to anybody, without the consent of his lord, we find them saying\r\n“he could not withdraw without his leave,” “he could not sell his land\r\nwithout his leave,” “he could not sell his land,” “he could not sell or\r\ngive his land without his leave”—all these phrases and many others\r\ndescribing exactly the same idea. This peculiarity runs through the\r\nwhole of the survey; it is shown in another way by the wonderful\r\neccentricities of the scribes in the matter of the spelling of proper\r\nnames. So far as place names go, this variety of spelling does little\r\nmore than place difficulties in the way of their identification; but\r\nwhen we find the same Englishman described in the same county as\r\nAnschil, Aschil, and Achi,[335] matters become more serious. For there\r\nis hardly a question on which we could wish for more exact evidence than\r\nthat of the number of Englishmen who continued to hold land after the\r\nConquest; and yet, owing to the habits of the Domesday scribes, we can\r\nnever quite avoid an uneasy suspicion that two Englishmen whose names\r\nfaintly resemble each other may, after all, turn out to be one and the\r\nsame person. We cannot really blame the scribes for relieving their\r\nmonotonous task by indulging in such pleasure as the variation of phrase\r\nand spelling may have brought them, but it is very necessary to face\r\nthis fact in dealing with any branch of Domesday study, and the neglect\r\nof this precaution has led many enquirers into serious error.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with all this is the question of the existence of\r\ndownright error in Domesday Book itself. To show how this might happen,\r\nit will be necessary to give a sketch of the manner in which the great\r\nsurvey was compiled. “The king,” says the Anglo-Saxon chronicler, “sent\r\nhis men into every shire all over England.” We cannot be quite sure\r\nwhether they went on circuit through the several hundreds of each shire\r\nor merely held one session in its county town[336]; in either case there\r\nappeared before them the entire hundred court, consisting, as we have\r\nseen, of the priest, the reeve, and six villeins from every vill. But\r\nout of this heterogeneous assembly there seems to have been chosen a\r\nsmall body of jurors who were responsible in a peculiar degree for the\r\nverdict given. We possess lists of the jurors for most of the hundreds\r\nof Cambridgeshire, from which it appears that eight were chosen in each\r\nhundred, and, a very important point, that half of them were Frenchmen\r\nand half were Englishmen. Thus the commissioners obtained for each\r\nhundred the sworn verdict of a body of men drawn from both races and\r\nrepresenting, so far as we can see, very different levels of society. We\r\ncannot assume that precisely the same questions were put to the jurors\r\nin every shire. The commissioners may well have been allowed some little\r\nfreedom of adapting the form of the inquiry to varying local conditions,\r\nand the terminology of their instructions may have differed to some\r\nextent according to the part of England in which they were to be carried\r\nout; but the similarity of the returns obtained from very distant\r\ncounties proves that the whole Domesday Inquest was framed according to\r\none general plan. It is more likely that the differences which\r\nundoubtedly exist at times between the surveys of different counties are\r\nreally due to the procedure of the scribes who shaped the local returns\r\ninto Domesday as we possess it.[337]\r\n\r\nIt will be evident that the completed returns from each county must have\r\nconsisted of a series of hundred-rolls arranged vill by vill according\r\nto the sequence followed by the commissioners in making the inquiry. The\r\nfirst task of the Domesday scribes was to substitute for the\r\ngeographical order of the original returns a tenurial order based on the\r\ndistribution of land among the tenants-in-chief in each shire. They must\r\nhave worked through the returns county by county, collecting all the\r\nentries which related to land held by the same tenant-in-chief in each\r\nshire, and arranging them under appropriate headings, and we know that\r\nthey paid no very consistent regard to local geography in the process.\r\nWhere a vill was divided between two or more tenants-in-chief the\r\ndivision must have been marked by the jurors of its hundred in making\r\ntheir report; but, whereas the unity of the vill as a whole was\r\nrespected in the original returns, it was disregarded by the Domesday\r\nscribes, for whom the feudal arrangements of the county were the first\r\nconsideration. The first step to be taken in drawing a picture of the\r\ncondition of any county surveyed in Domesday is the collection of their\r\nscattered entries and the reconstruction of the individual vills in\r\ntheir entirety. As any one who has attempted this exercise can testify,\r\nthe risk of error is very great, and we may be sure that it was no less\r\nfor the Domesday scribes themselves. We cannot often test the accuracy\r\nof Domesday by a comparison with other documents, but the few cases\r\nwhere this is possible are enough to destroy all belief in the literal\r\ninfallibility of the great record. The work was done under great\r\npressure and against time, and we should not cavil at its incidental\r\ninaccuracies.\r\n\r\nDomesday Book as we possess it consists of two volumes, the second,\r\nknown as Little Domesday, dealing with Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, the\r\nfirst containing the survey of the rest of England. The two volumes are\r\nvery different in plan and treatment. In Essex and East Anglia, the\r\nscribes have followed as nearly as possible the directions which we have\r\nquoted on page 458. They enumerate the live-stock on the several estates\r\nwith an abundance of detail which quite justifies the complaint of the\r\nPeterborough Chronicler that there was not an ox or a cow nor a swine\r\nthat was not set down in the king’s writ. It is from the survey of these\r\ncounties also that we draw the great body of our information about the\r\ndifferent sorts and conditions of men, their tenurial relations and\r\npersonal status. But this wealth of detail is accompanied by\r\nconsiderable faultiness of execution, and in the first volume of\r\nDomesday the plan is different. In compiling Great Domesday the scribes\r\nabandoned the idea of transcribing the original returns in full, and\r\ncontented themselves with giving a _précis_ of them; the details which\r\nhad been collected about sheep and horses are jettisoned and the whole\r\nsurvey is drawn within closer limits. The most reasonable explanation of\r\nthis change is that the so-called second volume of Domesday represents\r\nthe first attempt at a codification of the returns[338]; that the result\r\nwas found too detailed for practical purposes, and that the conciser\r\narrangement of the first volume was adopted in consequence. The volume\r\ncombining Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk contains 450 folios and even the\r\nConqueror might have been appalled at the outcome of his survey if all\r\nthe thirty counties of England were to be described on the same scale.\r\nWhatever the reason, the change is accompanied by a marked improvement\r\nin workmanship and practicability.\r\n\r\nThe “first” volume of Domesday contains 382 folios and its arrangement\r\ndeserves notice. In regular course the survey proceeds across England\r\nfrom Kent to Cornwall; the first 125 folios of the volume are in fact\r\nthe description of the earldom of Wessex. Next, starting again in the\r\neast, the counties between Middlesex and Herefordshire are described; to\r\nbe followed by the survey of the north midland shires from\r\nCambridgeshire to Warwick, still following due order from east to west.\r\nWarwick is followed by Shropshire, for Worcestershire belongs to\r\nDomesday’s second belt, and the rest of the survey progresses from west\r\nto east from Shropshire to Notts, Yorkshire and Leicestershire\r\ncompleting the tale. In general the boundaries of the counties are the\r\nsame as at the present day, but portions of Wales are included in\r\nGloucester, Hereford, and Berkshire; the lands “between Ribble and\r\nMersey” form a sort of appendage to Yorkshire, and Rutland in 1086 has\r\nnot yet the full status of a county. It is not quite easy to explain why\r\nDomesday stops short at the Tees and the Ribble. Cumberland and\r\nWestmoreland were indeed reckoned parts of the Scotch kingdom at this\r\ntime, but Northumberland and Durham were undoubtedly English. Possibly\r\nthey had been too much harried in recent years to be worth the labour of\r\nsurveying; possibly in that wild and lawless land an attempt to carry\r\nout the survey would have led to something more than local riots. At any\r\nrate Domesday’s omission is our loss, for it is in the extreme north\r\nthat the old English tenures lingered the longest; we could wish for a\r\ndescription of them in the Conqueror’s day and conceived on the same\r\nplan as the full accounts which we possess of the feudalised south.\r\n\r\nAll over England the scribes so far as was possible followed a\r\nconsistent plan in the arrangement of the returns for each county. The\r\ncase of Oxfordshire will do for a typical instance. Here, as in nearly\r\nevery shire to the north of the Thames, the county town is surveyed\r\nfirst; the interesting description which is given of Oxford filling a\r\ncolumn and a half. The rest of the folio is occupied by a list of all\r\nthose in the county who held land in chief of the crown, arranged and\r\nnumbered in the order in which their estates are entered in the body of\r\nthe survey. The scale of precedence adopted by the compilers of Domesday\r\ndeserves remark, for it is substantially the same as the order which we\r\nfind observed in the lists of witnesses to solemn charters of the time.\r\nFirst comes the king in the case of every county in which he held land.\r\nThen comes the body of ecclesiastical tenants holding of him within the\r\nshire, archbishops first, then bishops, then abbots, or rather abbeys,\r\nfor the tendency is to assign the lands belonging to a religious house\r\nto the foundation itself rather than to its head. Among laymen the earls\r\ncome first, foreign counts being placed on a level with their English\r\nrepresentatives, the same Latin word (_comes_) expressing both titles.\r\nThen come the various “barons” undistinguished by any mark of rank, who\r\nof course form the larger number of the tenants-in-chief in any shire,\r\nand lastly, in most counties, the holdings of a number of men of\r\ninferior rank are thrown together under one heading as “the lands of the\r\nking’s servants, sergeants, or thegns.” Returning to the case of\r\nOxfordshire we find the king, as ever, first on the list. He is followed\r\nby the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of Winchester,\r\nSalisbury, Exeter, Lincoln, Bayeux, and Lisieux, who in turn are\r\nsucceeded by the abbeys of Abingdon, Battle, Winchcombe, Préaux, the\r\nchurch of Saint Denis of Paris, and the canons of Saint Frideswide of\r\nOxford. Earl Hugh of Chester stands first among laymen of “comital”\r\nrank, being followed by the counts of Mortain and Evreux, Earl Aubrey of\r\nNorthumbria, and Count Eustace of Bologne. Then come the barons,\r\ntwenty-three in number in Oxfordshire, whose order in the survey seems\r\nto be determined by no more subtle cause than a shadowy idea on the part\r\nof the scribes of grouping them according to the initial letter of their\r\nextra names. The list becomes a little miscellaneous towards the close;\r\nthree great ladies appear: Christina, the sister of Edgar the Etheling;\r\nthe Countess Judith, Waltheof’s widow; and a lady who is vaguely\r\ndescribed as “Roger de Ivry’s wife,” bringing the total up to\r\nfifty-five. Then comes another baron, Hascuit Musard, an important\r\nGloucestershire land-owner, whose Oxfordshire holding would seem to have\r\nbeen overlooked by the scribes, for it is squeezed in along the foot of\r\ntwo folios of the survey. He is followed by Turkill of Arden, an\r\nEnglishman, who was powerful in Warwickshire but only held one manor in\r\nOxfordshire, the description of which is succeeded by “the land of\r\nRichard Engayne and other thegns.” Richard Engayne was the king’s\r\nhuntsman, and a Norman, as were many of his fellows, but about half the\r\nnames entered under this comprehensive heading are unmistakably English\r\nand characteristically enough they are entered in a group after the\r\nmembers of the conquering race. The fifty-ninth and last heading in this\r\nvaried list runs, “These underwritten lands belong to Earl William’s\r\nfee,” a formula which is explained by the fact that the manors surveyed\r\nunder it had belonged to Earl William Fitz Osbern, who as we know had\r\nbeen killed in Flanders in 1071, while his son and heir had been\r\ndisinherited in 1075. And so we see that, although the earl’s tenants\r\nhad lost their immediate lord in consequence of his forfeiture, they\r\nwere not recognised as holding in chief of the crown, but were kept\r\napart in a group by themselves in anticipation of the later feudal\r\npractice by which the tenants of a great fief or honour in the royal\r\nhands were conceived of as holding rather of their honour than of the\r\nking himself.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter we have mainly dealt with Domesday Book from its\r\nown standpoint as a fiscal register, but for the majority of the\r\nstudents its real value lies in the unique light which it throws upon\r\nlegal and social antiquities and upon the personal history of the men of\r\nthe Conquest. In these latter respects the different parts of the survey\r\nare by no means of equal value. The space assigned to each county in\r\nDomesday was determined solely by the caprice of the scribes; counties\r\nof approximately equal area are assigned very different limits of space\r\nin the record. Equally due to the action of the scribes is the amount of\r\nsocial and personal details, above the necessary minimum of fiscal\r\ninformation required, which is included in the description of each\r\ncounty. The surveys of Berkshire and Worcestershire, for instance, are\r\nmany-sided records which throw light upon every aspect of the history of\r\nthe times; while on the other hand for the counties of the Danelaw the\r\nfiscal skeleton of the record is left bare and arid; we get columns of\r\nstatistics and little beside. The interest of Domesday of course is\r\nvastly increased when we are able to supplement its details with\r\ninformation derived from some other contemporary record;\r\nBuckinghamshire, for example, in which county there was no religious\r\nhouse in 1086, is at a disadvantage compared with Berkshire, where the\r\nlocal history of Abingdon Abbey fills in the outline of the greater\r\nrecord, and gives life to some at least of the men of whom the names and\r\nnothing more are written in its pages. Apart from this adventitious\r\nsource of light, Domesday imparts some of its most precious information\r\nwhen recording a dispute between two tenants as to the possession of\r\nland, or noting new “customs,” tolls, and so forth, which have been\r\nintroduced since the Conquest, for then we may look for some statement\r\nof local custom or some reconstruction of the “status quo ante\r\nconquestum.” And this leads naturally to the last division of our\r\npresent subject—the legal theory which underlies Domesday Book.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly plain from all our narratives of the Conquest that King\r\nWilliam regarded himself, and was determined that he should be regarded,\r\nas the lawful successor of his cousin King Edward; he was the true heir\r\nby blood as well as by bequest. Unfortunately wicked men had usurped his\r\ninheritance so that he was driven to regain it by force and arms; the\r\nearl of Wessex had taken upon himself the title of king and the whole\r\nnation had acquiesced in his unlawful rule. But the verdict of battle\r\nhad been given in William’s favour; he had been accepted as king by the\r\ngreat men of the realm, and he had been duly crowned; it would be no\r\nmore than justice for him to disinherit every Englishman as such for his\r\ntacit or overt rebellion. Moreover even after he had been received as\r\nking his rebellious subjects in every part of the land had risen against\r\nhim; they had justly forfeited all claim to his royal grace; their lands\r\nby virtue of these repeated treasons became at his absolute disposal.\r\nSome such ideas as these underlie that “great confiscation” of which\r\nFreeman considered Domesday to be essentially the record, and two\r\nall-important conclusions followed from them. The first is that the time\r\nof King Edward, that phrase which meets us on every page of Domesday,\r\nwas the last season of good law in the land; should any man claim rights\r\nor privileges by prescription he must plead that they had been allowed\r\nand accepted under the last king of the old native line. Just as his\r\nsubjects cried for “the law of King Edward” as the system of government\r\nunder which they wished to live, so to the king himself these words\r\nexpressed the test of legality to be applied to whatever rights claimed\r\nan origin anterior to his own personal grant. Rarely does Domesday refer\r\nto any of the kings before Edward; the Conqueror’s reign has already\r\nbecome the limit of legal memory; never, except by inadvertence, does it\r\nrefer to the reign of Harold by name. And then in the second place he\r\nwho would prove the lawful possession of his land must rely in the last\r\nresort upon “the writ and seal” of King William. The whole tenor of\r\nDomesday seems to imply that all Englishmen as such were held to have\r\nbeen disinherited by the result of the Conquest. Save for the lands of\r\nGod and his Saints all England had become the king’s; the disposition he\r\nmight make of his vast inheritance depended solely upon his own will. If\r\nhe should please to allow to an Englishman the possession of his own or\r\nothers’ lands, this was a matter of pure favour, and Thurkill of Warwick\r\nand Colswegn of Lincoln could put forward no other title than that which\r\nsecured their fiefs to the Norman barons around them. But then comes in\r\nthat principle which is above all distinctive of the Norman Conquest—if\r\nWilliam stepped by lawful possession into the exact position of the\r\nnative kings who were before him, so each of his barons in each of his\r\nestates must be the exact legal successor, the “heir,” of the Englishman\r\nwhom he supplanted. The term used by Domesday to express the\r\nrelationship of the old and the new landlord is very suggestive: the\r\nEnglishman is the Norman’s _antecessor_, a word which we only translate\r\ninadequately by the colourless “predecessor.” We are probably right in\r\ncalling the Norman Conquest the one catastrophic change in our social\r\nhistory, but the change as yet was informal; it went on beneath the\r\nsurface of the law; the terminology of Domesday testifies to the attempt\r\nto bring the social conditions of 1086 under formulas which would be\r\nappropriate to the time of King Edward. When we are told that there were\r\nten manors in such a vill in the time of King Edward, or that there used\r\nto be twenty villeins in a certain manor but now there are only sixteen,\r\nwe may gravely doubt whether the terms “manor” and “villein” were known\r\nin England before the Conquest, and yet we may recognise that the\r\nemployment of these words in relation to the Confessor’s day is of\r\nitself very significant. King William as King Edward’s lawful heir\r\nwishes consistently to act as such so far as may be; his scribes in\r\ntheir terminology affect a continuity of social history, which does not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing could be more illustrative of these principles than a\r\nfew extracts taken from the Lincolnshire “Clamores”—the statement of the\r\nvarious disputed claims which had come to light in the course of the\r\nsurvey, and the record of their settlement by the Domesday jurors. The\r\nfollowing are taken at random in the order in which they are entered in\r\nDomesday:\r\n\r\n  “Candleshoe wapentake says that Ivo Taillebois ought to have that\r\n  which he claims in Ashby against Earl Hugh; namely one mill and one\r\n  bovat of land, although the soke belongs to Grainham.\r\n\r\n  “Concerning the two carucates of land which Robert Dispensator claims\r\n  against Gilbert de Gand in Screnby through Wiglac, his predecessor\r\n  [_antecessor_], the wapentake says that the latter only had one\r\n  carucate, and the soke of that belonged to Bardney. But Wiglac\r\n  forfeited that land to his lord Gilbert, and so Robert has nothing\r\n  there according to the witness of the Riding.\r\n\r\n  “In the same Screnby Chetelbern claims one carucate against Gilbert de\r\n  Gand through Godric [but the jurors], say that he only had half a\r\n  carucate, and the soke of that belonged to Bardney, and Chetelbern’s\r\n  claim is unjust according to the wapentake, because his predecessor\r\n  forfeited the land. The men of Candleshoe wapentake with the agreement\r\n  of the whole Riding say that Siwate and Alnod and Fenchel and Aschel\r\n  equally divided their father’s land among themselves in King Edward’s\r\n  time, and held it so that if there were need to serve with the king\r\n  and Siwate could go the other brothers assisted him. After him the\r\n  next one went and Siwate and the next assisted him and so on with\r\n  regard to all, but Siwate was the king’s man.”\r\n\r\nIn these passages the actual working of the Domesday Inquest is very\r\nclearly displayed. In the first place we see that all really turns on\r\nthose ancient local assemblies the wapentake and hundred courts. Not\r\nonly do they supply the requisite information through the representative\r\njurors to the commissioners, but it is by their verdict that the latter\r\nare guided in their pronouncements upon disputed claims. If Ivo\r\nTaillebois receives his seisin of that mill and oxgang of land in Ashby\r\nit will be because the wapentake court of Candleshoe has assigned it to\r\nhim rather than the earl of Chester. This simple procedure has a great\r\nfuture before it; if the king can compel the local courts to give a\r\nsworn verdict to his officers, so in specific cases he can of his grace\r\npermit private persons to use these bodies in the same way. The Domesday\r\nInquest is the noble ancestor of the Plantagenet “assizes,” and through\r\nthem, by direct descent, of the jury in its perfected form. But the\r\naction of the local courts becomes doubly significant when we remember\r\ntheir composition. The affairs of the greatest people in the land, of\r\nthe king himself, are being discussed by very humble men, men, as we\r\nhave seen, carefully chosen so as to represent Frenchmen and Englishmen\r\nalike. Nothing is a more wholesome corrective of exaggerated ideas as to\r\nthe severance and hostility of the two races than a due remembrance of\r\nthe part which both played in the Domesday Inquest.\r\n\r\nEqually important is the respect which is clearly being paid in the\r\nabove discussions to the strict forms of law, of English law in\r\nparticular. No very knotty problems arise in the course of our simple\r\nextract, but we can see that a Norman baron will often have to stand or\r\nfall in his claim according to the interpretation of some old English\r\nlegal doctrine. We know from other sources that the intricacies of the\r\nrules which in King Edward’s time determined the rights and status of\r\nfree men became a thing of wonder to the men of the twelfth century, and\r\nwe may suspect that the Domesday commissioners were frequently tempted\r\nto cut these obsolete knots. But so far as is practicable, they are\r\nmaintaining that the Norman must succeed to just the legal position of\r\nhis English “antecessor”; Robert the Dispensator cannot claim the land\r\nwhich has been forfeited by Wiglac to Gilbert de Gand.\r\n\r\nLastly, one is always tempted to forget that twenty years had passed\r\nbetween the death of King Edward and the making of the Domesday Survey.\r\nOur attention is naturally and rightly concentrated on the great change\r\nwhich substituted a Norman for an English land-holding class, so that we\r\nare apt to ignore the struggles which must have taken place among the\r\nconquerors themselves in the division of the spoil; struggles none the\r\nless real because, so far as we can see, they were carried on under the\r\nforms of law. Death and confiscation had left their mark upon the Norman\r\nbaronage; the personnel of Domesday Book would have been very different\r\nif the record had been drawn up a dozen years earlier. But, even apart\r\nfrom this, it was inevitable that friction should arise within the mass\r\nof Norman nobility as it settled into its position in the conquered\r\nland. The Domesday Inquest afforded a grand opportunity for the\r\nstatement and adjustment of conflicting claims, and examples may\r\ngenerally be found in every few pages of Domesday Book.\r\n\r\nThe last point in connection with the survey which calls for special\r\nnotice is the origin of the name by which it is universally known.\r\n“Domesday Book” is clearly no official title; it is a popular\r\nappellation, of which the meaning is not quite free from doubt.\r\nOfficially, the record was known as the “Book of Winchester,” from the\r\ncity in which it was kept; it was cited under that name when the abbot\r\nof Abingdon, in the reign of Henry I., proved by it the exemption of\r\ncertain of his estates from the hundred court of Pyrton, Oxfordshire.\r\nThe best explanation of its other, more famous name may be given in the\r\nwords of Richard Fitz Neal, writing under Henry II.:\r\n\r\n  “This book is called by the natives, ‘Domesdei,’ that is by a metaphor\r\n  the day of judgment, for as the sentence of that strict and terrible\r\n  last scrutiny may by no craft be evaded, so when a dispute arises\r\n  concerning those matters which are written in this book, it is\r\n  consulted, and its sentence may not be impugned nor refused with\r\n  safety.”[339]\r\n\r\nOn the whole this explanation probably comes near the truth. We may well\r\nbelieve that to the common folk of the time, this stringent, searching\r\ninquiry into their humble affairs may have seemed very suggestive of the\r\nlast great day of reckoning. Viewed in this light the name becomes\r\ninvested with an interest of its own; it is an abiding witness to the\r\nreluctant wonder aroused by the making of this, King William’s greatest\r\nwork and our supreme record.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of William I.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of William I.]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          Genealogical Tables\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 TABLE A\r\n\r\n_THE DUCAL HOUSE OF NORMANDY_\r\n\r\n                         ‘Rollo’\r\n                            │\r\n                        William I.\r\n                            │\r\n                        Richard I.\r\n                            │\r\n      ┌──────────────┬──────┼──────────┬────────┬───────────┬───┐\r\n      │              │      │          │        │           │   │\r\nRichard II. = Judith │    Malger   William  Mahaut = Odo II.│Hawise = Geoffrey I\r\n      │  of Brittany │   count of   count              of   │       of Brittany\r\n      │              │   Mortain    of Eu            Blois  │         ↓\r\n      │              │      │         │                     │     (Table B)\r\n      │              │      │         │         ┌───────────┘\r\n      │           Robert,   │         │       Emma = Ethelred II.\r\n      │          archbishop William   │      ┌─────┴──────┐\r\n      │           of Rouen  ‘the      │    Alfred the  Edward the\r\n      │              │      Warling’  │    Etheling    Confessor\r\n      │              │                │\r\n      │         Ralf de Wacy          └─────────────────────┐\r\n   ┌──┴─────┬───────────────┬──────────────┬──────────┐     │\r\n   │        │               │              │          │     │\r\nRichard  Robert I.          │            Malger    William  │\r\n III.       │     Adeliz = Reginald,   archbishop  count    │\r\nNicholas    │              count of    of Rouen   of Arques │\r\nabbot of    │             Burgundian                        │\r\nSt. Ouen    │             Palatinate                ┌───────┼──────────┐\r\n       ┌────┴──────┐        │                       │       │          │\r\n       │           │      Guy of                 Robert  William  Hugh, bishop\r\n   William II.

In carrying out this plan, the myths, with which\r\nthe history of all lands begins, will not be overlooked, though these\r\nwill be carefully distinguished from the actual history, so far as the\r\nlabors of the accepted historical authorities have resulted in definite\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the different volumes have been planned to cover\r\nconnecting and, as far as possible, consecutive epochs or periods, so\r\nthat the set when completed will present in a comprehensive narrative\r\nthe chief events in the great STORY OF THE NATIONS; but it is, of\r\ncourse, not always practicable to issue the several volumes in their\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\n            12^o Illustrated, cloth, each             $1.50\r\n            Half leather, each                         1.75\r\n\r\n                  _For list of volumes see next page_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE STORY OF THE NATIONS\r\n\r\n GREECE.

Where the references could be found,\r\nthey have been supplied.\r\n\r\n  87.27    on Waltheof’s case below, page [338.]          Supplied.\r\n  116.31   See note, page [112] above.                    Supplied.\r\n  136.31   See the table on page [506]                    Supplied.\r\n\r\nThe missing page references to De la Borderie’s _Histoire de Bretagne_\r\non pp. 138 (footnote 89), and 139 (footnote 90) could not be resolved.\r\nNor could the reference to a prior quotation of William of Malmesbury be\r\ndefinitely made (p. 414). These are noted in this text as [missing].\r\n\r\nThe list of illusatrations includes a reference at p. x.13 to the image\r\nof a coin on p. 406, but no image was included in the text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 260, on p. 339, had no reference in the text. One has been\r\nadded at the most likely point in the narrative, given the context.\r\n\r\nErrors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and\r\nare noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.\r\n\r\n  24.14    the orig[i]nal settlers of Normandy            Inserted.\r\n  26.26    the [enemity] of all his fellow-nobles         Obsolete.\r\n  40.15    the influence of the g[r]eat Cluniac movement  Inserted.\r\n  72.20    the s[ei/ie]ge of Montgomery Castle            Transposed.\r\n  76.13    to see two of Wil[l]iam’s unlucky guardians    Inserted.\r\n  79.17    inflict gratuit[i]ous injury                   Removed.\r\n  81.30    The B[a/e]ssin and Cotentin                    Replaced.\r\n  129.30   which was de[s]cribed in the last chapter      Inserted.\r\n  267.16   appointing a No[r]man baron                    Inserted.\r\n  327.18   in peaceable posses[s]ion                      Inserted.\r\n  338.1    the mo[ton/not] of his imprisonment            Transposed.\r\n  339.7    based his accou[n]t                            Inserted.\r\n  424.21   upon his ag[g]ressive course as sheriff        Inserted.\r\n  441.4    [“]infangenethef” is the right of trying       Inserted.\r\n  441.36   a great baron cert[ia/ai]nly                   Transposed.\r\n  455.1    on a level w[i]th the Norman                   Inserted.\r\n  458.6    for the details of government[.]               Added.\r\n  505.34   Clun[i/y], abbey of, 379                       Replaced.",
