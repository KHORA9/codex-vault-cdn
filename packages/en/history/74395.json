Belgium, as an entirely autonomous,\r\nindependent kingdom, has existed only since 1830. But the Belgium of\r\n1830 was, in a certain way, a creation of European diplomacy and the\r\nresult of centuries of struggle for personal and political freedom.\r\nBelgium, as a country, and the Belgians, as a people, existed long\r\nbefore. Since the time of Caesar (57 B.C.), history tells us of the\r\nBelgians, “the bravest of all the people of Gaul,” and, although the\r\nGermanic invasions of the fourth and fifth centuries have added a new\r\nethnical element to the old Belgian stock, it is from the time of the\r\nRoman conqueror that the history of the Belgian people really begins.\r\nAs for Belgium as a united political body, one must go back to the\r\nfifteenth century, when the dukes of Burgundy succeeded in unifying\r\nall the Belgian duchies and counties under one dynasty. Before that\r\ntime, Belgium had practically consisted of two very distinct parts,\r\nLotharingia in the east, Flanders in the west, separated by the river\r\nScheldt. Lotharingia was, politically speaking, a part of the mediaeval\r\nGerman empire; Flanders was in subjugation to the kingdom of France.\r\nEach succeeded--Lotharingia first, then Flanders--in evading the\r\npolitical domination of Germany and France, respectively, and drew\r\ncloser and closer together during the last centuries of the Middle\r\nAges. That work of union was achieved by the Burgundian dukes, who\r\ninherited from the local Lotharingian and Flemish dynasties, in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nBut in the Middle Ages not only did the increasing tendency of union\r\nbetween Lotharingia and Flanders exist, but there was also a strong\r\nfactor of national union, the common civilization, the common culture,\r\nof Lotharingia and Flanders. The inhabitants of the different duchies\r\nand counties were united by the same religion, the same artistic and\r\neconomic aims, the same political institutions, although there were,\r\nof course, some local differences of minor importance. Since early in\r\nthe Middle Ages the Belgian people had possessed a distinctive though\r\nmutually common civilization, and the local differences which existed\r\nand which were more or less well defined at the outset disappeared\r\ngradually as the different parts of the country drew closer together\r\npolitically.\r\n\r\nThe history of Belgium and the Belgian people does not begin to date\r\nmerely from 1830, not even from the fifteenth century. It dates in\r\nfact from the time when, during the fifth century, Gallo-Romans and\r\nGermanic invaders intermingled and laid the basis of that ethnical and\r\nlinguistic duality that has been for many centuries the characteristic\r\nof the Belgian populace and has impressed its mark on the whole course\r\nof Belgian history.\r\n\r\nThe real unity of the history of Belgium in ante-modern times has been\r\nbrought into notice by one of Belgium’s leading historians, Henri\r\nPirenne, professor in the University of Ghent, in his admirable work,\r\n_Histoire de Belgique_. Before the publication of this work, few\r\nscholars understood how to treat the history of Belgium during the\r\nMiddle Ages. Having in mind only the political aspect of that history,\r\nthey were lost in the particular history of the various duchies\r\nand counties; they saw scarcely any link between the facts of these\r\ndifferent historical sections, and they forgot entirely to take account\r\nof the unifying factor--the common culture and civilization.\r\n\r\nSince historians have had their attention called to that unifying\r\nfactor, the history of Belgium has been looked upon in a different\r\nmanner. It is in the light of that method that I shall try to explain\r\nthe course of the historical development of the country.\r\n\r\nThe national culture of Belgium is a synthesis, if I may so call\r\nit, where one finds the genius of two races--the Romance and the\r\nGermanic--mingled, yet modified by the imprint of the distinctively\r\nBelgian. It is in that very receptivity--the fact that it has absorbed\r\nand unified the best elements of Latin and Teutonic civilization--that\r\nthe originality of the Belgian national culture resides.\r\n\r\nThese distinctive marks of national culture, denoting the unity of a\r\npeople, and serving, both in the Middle Ages and today, to distinguish\r\nthe Belgian nation from the other nations of Europe, may be described\r\nas a common desire for independence and freedom, a jealous regard for\r\nthose popular rights which serve as a guaranty of the continuance of\r\nindependence and freedom, and a deeply religious spirit. In the course\r\nof their history the Belgians have always cast off the yoke of those\r\nprinces who, like Philip II, Joseph II, and William I of Holland,\r\nattacked their liberties and privileges, or who, like Joseph II and\r\nWilliam I of Holland, tried to impose their own religious beliefs on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThose characteristics of the Belgian nation, as well as its common\r\ncivilization, were born during the Middle Ages. For that reason I\r\nshall deal in a special manner with the different aspects of religious,\r\nartistic, literary, and economic life during that period. After the\r\ntreatment of the political unity of the Belgian provinces achieved in\r\nthe fifteenth century, more attention will be given to the political\r\naspect of events, without, however, entirely neglecting the different\r\nforms of popular life and social activity.\r\n\r\nThe history of Belgium may be divided into the following periods: (1)\r\nthe formative period, including the time of the Roman occupation, the\r\ninvasion of the Franks, and the reign of Charles the Great and his\r\nimmediate heirs (57 B.C. to 843 A.D.); (2) the period of feudalism;\r\n(3) the rise of the communes (eleventh to fourteenth century); (4) the\r\npolitical centralization of the dukes of Burgundy (fifteenth century);\r\n(5) the Spanish rule (sixteenth to seventeenth century); (6) the\r\nAustrian rule (eighteenth century); (7) the French régime (1792-1815);\r\n(8) the Dutch rule and the revolution of 1830; (9) the period of\r\nnational independence.\r\n\r\nDuring all these periods of history the names “Belgium” and “Belgians”\r\nhave not been uniformly those by which the country and its people have\r\nbeen designated. The name “Belgae,” of Celtic origin, was given in\r\nCaesar’s time to the confederation of Celtic tribes which occupied the\r\nterritory of Belgium, when for the first time the Roman legions came in\r\ncontact with them. The name Belgium, “Belgica,” disappeared with the\r\nRoman occupation and does not reappear until the sixteenth century.\r\nDuring the sixteenth century, and especially at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth, the name “Belgium” is to be found in books, but seems not\r\nto have been used as a common designation. As a distinctive name for\r\na race or people, the term “Belges” became generally used at the end\r\nof the eighteenth century, its adjectival form being then “belgique”\r\n(_les provinces belgiques_, “the Belgian provinces”). Between the\r\nend of the Roman occupation and the end of the eighteenth century\r\nthe Belgians were successively known as “Franks,” “Lotharingi,” and\r\n“Flemings.” Since the thirteenth century, the country itself has been\r\ncalled “Netherlands” (_partes advallenses_), when the name Lotharingia\r\ndisappeared as a political term. The term “Burgundian provinces” was\r\nsometimes used in the fifteenth century, while the name “Flanders,”\r\n“Fiandra,” “Flandes,” was mainly applied during the Spanish rule.\r\nDuring the Austrian rule the name “Austrian Netherlands” was the\r\nprevailing designation.[1] The term “Netherlands” was applied, not only\r\nto the actual territory of Belgium, but to the countries which today\r\ncorrespond to the territories included in the kingdoms of Belgium and\r\nHolland. From the time of the Roman occupation until 1588 Belgium and\r\nHolland have, indeed, a somewhat common history. Since 1588, when the\r\nprovinces of the north separated from the south as the United Provinces\r\nof the Netherlands, Belgium and Holland have existed as separate\r\nstates, and have no longer a common history.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to deal here with the history of the northern\r\nprovinces from the early Middle Ages down to 1588, for that is the\r\ntask of the historian of Holland, and although, politically speaking,\r\nthe provinces of Belgium and Holland both shared the same vicissitudes\r\nuntil 1588, yet, as has been pointed out by Professor Colenbrander,[2]\r\nfrom the point of view of artistic, literary, and economic life the\r\nnational culture of the two was quite distinct.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, included in this history is that of the principality\r\nof Liège. Liège was never a part of the Netherlands; until 1795 it\r\nwas an ecclesiastical state with a separate entity, ruled by bishops,\r\nprinces of the Holy Roman Empire. But Liège had a civilization,\r\nand especially institutions, common to those of the other Belgian\r\nprovinces, and, geographically and historically speaking, it was really\r\na part of Belgium.\r\n\r\nHaving thus indicated what is to be dealt with in this _Short History\r\nof Belgium_, it remains only to mention the bibliographical list\r\nappended at the close of the work, which includes the most important\r\nbooks on general Belgian history. A reference to these will facilitate\r\na deeper study of the subject and will enable the student to enter more\r\nin detail into the history of the country.[3]\r\n\r\n  LÉON VAN DER ESSEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editors have urged me to add in this edition a final chapter on\r\nthe history of Belgium during the Great War. These events, of course,\r\ndo not yet belong to history, but it seems possible to give at least a\r\nbrief sketch of what happened in Belgium during the invasion and the\r\nGerman occupation. The knowledge which we have acquired in the year\r\nthat has elapsed since the armistice has enabled us to establish the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF FORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in 57 B.C., the Roman Republic, then in control of most of the\r\nMediterranean countries, the south of Gaul included, determined to\r\nconquer also the rest of that country, Belgium was occupied by a people\r\nof Celtic origin, called the Belgians, “Belgae.” They were a part of\r\nthe larger group of the Gauls who possessed the country between the\r\nPyrennees, the Alps, the Rhine, and the sea. The Belgians occupied,\r\nnot only the actual territory of Belgium, but also a part of Northern\r\nFrance and of Rhenish Prussia. They formed a confederation of several\r\ntribes, among which the Nervians, dwelling in the provinces of Hainaut,\r\nBrabant, and Flanders, were the most important.\r\n\r\nThe Roman general, Julius Caesar, intrusted with the task of subduing\r\nthe north of Gaul, attacked the Belgians in 57 B.C. The Roman army\r\nwould have been routed by the Nervians in the first attack but for\r\nCaesar, who himself led the troops and saved the day. Notwithstanding a\r\nfierce guerrilla warfare that lasted four years, all the Belgian tribes\r\nwere successively subdued and some of them exterminated. Their heroic\r\nresistance made Caesar say of them: “Among all the Gauls, the bravest\r\nare the Belgians.”\r\n\r\nOnce subdued, Belgium accepted the Roman rule and remained loyal to the\r\nEmpire. Civilization was rapidly introduced; great military roads were\r\nconstructed through the Belgian forests and marshes, connecting the\r\ndifferent towns, and along their course villages were built and farms\r\ndeveloped. Tongres and Tournai became entirely Romanized cities, where\r\nsplendid monuments were built; remains of these are still to be found\r\ntoday. Farms were laid out and country houses were erected according\r\nto Roman pattern, with such changes as were imposed by the rigors of\r\nthe northern climate. The Belgians adopted Roman manners and customs\r\nand the Latin language: they became Gallo-Romans, and even the national\r\ngods were renamed with Roman names.\r\n\r\nIf Belgium shared the splendor and the civilization of the Roman\r\nEmpire, it shared also the disastrous days of its decline. There came\r\na time when the Empire, once so strong, but now growing weaker and\r\nweaker, was quite unable to resist the hordes of barbarians, which,\r\ncoming from the dark forests of Germany, threatened the rich provinces\r\nof Gaul, and Italy itself, with invasion. From the third century on,\r\nFranks and Alamans devastated Gaul and left the wealthy territories\r\ncovered with ruins. The emperors did not succeed in expelling the\r\nFranks from the country: those tribes of Teutonic race were allowed\r\nto remain in the northern parts of Belgium, Flanders and Campine,[4]\r\nand became soldiers of the Empire. They early became dissatisfied with\r\nthe territory allotted to them and resumed their march southward,\r\nconquering the whole of Belgium. The year 406 witnessed a terrible\r\ncatastrophe. The Teutons, driven out of their country by the invasion\r\nof the Huns, burst like a hurricane upon the unfortunate provinces of\r\nBelgium, burned and devastated everything on their march, destroyed\r\nTongres and Tournai, and finally, swarming over the Alps and the\r\nPyrennees, invaded both Italy and Spain. After their passage, Belgium\r\nwas left undefended by the Roman legions, recalled to defend Italy\r\nitself, and the Franks of Flanders and Campine occupied the abandoned\r\nterritory without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe conquest by the Franks is an important event in Belgian history.\r\nIndeed, it is from the fifth century that the bilingualism and the\r\nethnographical dualism of Belgium may be said to date. The Franks,\r\ncomposed of two tribes, the Salians and the Ripuarians, advanced from\r\nthe north and the east into Belgium and occupied the country in such a\r\nway that the actual provinces of Flanders, Antwerp, Limburg, the larger\r\npart of Brabant, and Liège fell into their power. Farther south they\r\ndid not enter Belgium: their march was stopped by a dense and extended\r\nforest which, in Southwestern and Central Belgium, constituted the\r\ncontinuation of the forests of the Ardennes. The forest in question\r\nwas called Sylva Carbonaria, “Coal Wood,” and covered the largest part\r\nof the actual province of Hainaut, the seat of the modern Belgian coal\r\nindustry. Behind the curtain of that forest the oldest inhabitants of\r\nthe country, the Gallo-Romans, remained free from oppression by the\r\ninvaders and retained their Latin culture and civilization. So Belgium\r\nwas separated by the Sylva Carbonaria into two quite distinct parts:\r\nthe northern part, occupied by the Franks, with their Teutonic culture\r\nand civilization; the southern part, occupied by the Gallo-Romans.\r\nA line was thus drawn dividing the Belgian people, and an ethnical\r\nand linguistic duality, destined to remain for centuries one of the\r\nmain characteristics of the country, was established. Indeed, the\r\nWalloons[5] of today are the descendants of the old Gallo-Romans from\r\nbehind the limits of the Sylva Carbonaria, and the Flemings of Northern\r\nBelgium are the descendants of the Franks. This line drawn in the fifth\r\ncentury has undergone little change in the course of ages and, although\r\nthe famous coal wood disappeared many centuries ago, the separation\r\nbetween Walloons and Flemings has remained more or less apparent down\r\nto the present. In this case the Sylva Carbonaria played a part like\r\nthat of the Alps in the case of the Romanches and the Italians of the\r\nTessino, and that of the hills of Wales and Cornwall in the case of the\r\nBritons of England.\r\n\r\nThe first king of the Franks known in history is Clodion, who conquered\r\nthe countries of Tournai and Cambrai and established the seat of his\r\nrealm in Tournai. It is in this town that his grave was discovered\r\nin 1653; the King was found buried, according to the customs of his\r\npeople, together with his arms and royal ornaments; he was identified\r\nby the presence of a ring on which his likeness and his name were\r\nengraved.\r\n\r\nIt was from Tournai that the famous descendant of Clodion, King\r\nClodovech, started his campaign of further conquest that gave\r\nhim possession of Northern France and, after the war against the\r\nBurgundians and the West-goths (506), the control of nearly the whole\r\nof their country. From this time on, the Frankish kings established\r\ntheir capital at Paris. Belgium is no longer associated with the\r\nrecollection of their glorious deeds.\r\n\r\nClodion and his successors, so far as we know by the general history\r\nof Europe, belonged to the so-called dynasty of the Merovingians. The\r\nkings of that dynasty, in the course of the seventh century, were\r\nweaklings, actually dominated by their powerful ministers, the mayors\r\nof the palace. One of these, Peppin, in 751, succeeded in becoming\r\nhimself a king and was the founder of a new royal dynasty, the\r\nCarolingians.\r\n\r\nThe new dynasty was, geographically speaking, essentially a Belgian\r\ndynasty, for it had many possessions in Eastern Belgium and all its\r\nmembers had occupied influential offices at the court of the Austrasian\r\nkings, who, in the sixth and seventh centuries, ruled over that part of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the Carolingians is Charles the Great, who\r\nre-established the old Roman Empire (800) and who, by successful\r\ncampaigns, succeeded in extending his domination over the territory\r\nlying between the river Elbe, the Bohemian mountains, and the Raab on\r\nthe east, the sea on the west, the North Sea, and the Garigliano River\r\nin Italy and the Ebro River in Spain on the south.\r\n\r\nThe favorite residence of the great Emperor was at Aix, and this\r\ncontributed largely to the development of Belgian trade and industry\r\nat the beginning of the ninth century. Politically abandoned by the\r\nFrankish kings when they moved to Paris, Belgium again became important\r\nin the time of Charles the Great as the most favorably located portion\r\nof the Frankish Empire.\r\n\r\nBelgium is, indeed, for trade purposes, the natural meeting-ground of\r\nthe West-European nations. Lying between England, France, Germany, and\r\nHolland, it has good water communications with each. Though not quite\r\nso near the English coast as a corner of France is, it has the great\r\nadvantage of exactly fronting the mouth of the Thames. With France it\r\nis connected by the upper courses of the Lys, the Scheldt, the Sambre,\r\nand the Meuse, the last named being navigable by deep-draught vessels\r\nfar into Lorraine. With Germany its connection is less direct, the\r\noutlet of the Rhine running of course through Holland.[6]\r\n\r\nThese geographical conditions played a large part in the development\r\nof Belgian trade in the time of Charles the Great. The presence of the\r\nimperial palace at Aix attracted a great deal of traffic: from every\r\npart of the empire merchants, soldiers, priests, in short all classes\r\nof people, came through Belgium in order to reach the residence of the\r\nEmperor, and their presence resulted in unparalleled prosperity in\r\nthat part of the Carolingian empire. Charles the Great was not only a\r\ngreat soldier and legislator, but also a man who knew the importance\r\nof the Christian religion in cultural matters. During his reign the\r\ndevelopment of religious life in the different parts of the empire grew\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nSomething ought to be said concerning the introduction of the Christian\r\nreligion into Belgium. The preaching of the gospel in Belgium goes\r\nback as far as the Roman occupation of the time of the Empire,\r\nbut the religious organization of the church in the country dates\r\nfrom the middle of the fourth century. At that time we find in the\r\ncity of Tongres the oldest historically known bishop of Belgium,\r\nSt. Servatius. The historical origin of the bishoprics of Arras,\r\nTournai, Boulogne, Cambrai--all of them at that time in Belgian\r\nterritory--remains a matter of conjecture. The baptism of King\r\nClodovech in 496 made the development of the Christian religion easier,\r\nalthough the conversion of the King to the Catholic faith did not at\r\nall mean the conversion of the whole people. Large parts of Belgium,\r\nespecially the eastern part, remained heathen until the eighth century,\r\nand the introduction of the Christian religion in these sections of\r\nthe country is mainly the work of missionaries. These missionaries\r\nworked on their own initiative, without any such prearranged plan\r\nas, for instance, existed for the introduction of Catholicism into\r\nEngland. It was mainly by Irish and Anglo-Saxon missionaries that the\r\ngospel was made known, and the most famous of those heralds of the\r\nCatholic religion was the Anglo-Saxon missionary Willibrord. The work\r\nof the missionaries was completed by the bishops, who visited large\r\nportions of their very extensive dioceses. Bishops Eligius, Amandus,\r\nLambert, and Hubert are closely connected with the religious history\r\nof Belgium in the seventh and eighth centuries. The boundaries of the\r\ndioceses corresponded exactly with the limits of the old administrative\r\ncircles of the Roman Empire, the provinces. In the eighth century,\r\nBelgium was divided into the dioceses of Noyon-Tournai, Térouanne\r\n(later Saint-Omer), Arras, Cambrai, Liège, and Utrecht. The dioceses of\r\nUtrecht and Liège were subject to the metropolitan church of Cologne,\r\nthe others to the metropolitan church of Rheims.\r\n\r\nThese dioceses had been established without taking into account\r\nthe racial differences existing between the inhabitants of the\r\necclesiastical territory. Including in the same diocese Gallo-Romans\r\nand Franks, the church, unconsciously of course, prepared the\r\ninhabitants of Belgium for the task of being intermediaries between the\r\nLatin and the Teutonic civilization. The seats of the bishoprics being\r\nmostly located in the Romance section of the country, the inhabitants\r\nof the Teutonic section were obliged to meet the Walloons: they had\r\nthe same religious center. As a result of this action of the church,\r\nthe national or racial differences were diminished and the linguistic\r\nfrontier no more operated as a barrier in any real sense between the\r\npeople it separated.\r\n\r\nIf the conversion to the Catholic faith was mainly the task of the\r\nmissionaries, the introduction of civilization was mainly the task\r\nof the monasteries. Here the Benedictine monks played a very large\r\npart, both as civilizers and as colonizers. Their monasteries were,\r\nfrom the sixth century on, centers of economic and intellectual life.\r\nWhile some of their monks attacked the thick forests of Southern and\r\nCentral Belgium with axes, others engaged in literary labors in the\r\nmonasteries’ libraries, transcribing the ancient Greek and Latin\r\nmanuscripts, composing hymns and Lives of Saints, and opening schools\r\nfor the education of the people. They planted in the very hearts of the\r\npeople the roots of that strong religious spirit, which has steadily\r\ndeveloped, and which has become one of the characteristics of the\r\nnational spirit of Belgium.\r\n\r\nEach monastery became a kind of model farm, where the population of\r\nthe neighborhood could learn the best agricultural methods. In the\r\nmonastery, too, they could find physicians who knew how to take care\r\nof the sick. The monastery, being protected by the respect that was\r\ninspired by the saint to whom it was dedicated, was also a place of\r\nsafety in time of danger. Consequently, dwellings became more and more\r\nnumerous around the monasteries, and villages developed under their\r\ninfluence and protection.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, surprising that in the course of time tales and\r\nlegends developed wherein the founders of those monasteries became the\r\nheroes of poetical and sometimes extraordinary adventures. In this\r\nmanner did the people of mediaeval times express their gratitude for\r\nall they owed to those early pioneers of culture and civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF FEUDALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles the Great died in 814. His son, Emperor Louis, was a weakling,\r\nand after his death the mighty empire of Charles was destroyed by\r\ninternal troubles and civil war (840). Lotharius, the eldest son of\r\nEmperor Louis, endeavored to seize the empire for himself. To prevent\r\nthis, both his brothers, Louis and Charles, leagued themselves against\r\nhim and defeated him in the terrible battle of Fontanet, which has been\r\ncharacterized by contemporaries as a “judgment of God.” The peace that\r\nwas later concluded between the three brothers led to the famous Treaty\r\nof Verdun (843), an event of the utmost importance in the history of\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nThe empire created by Charles the Great was divided into three parts:\r\nthe central part, including the largest portion of Belgium, Holland,\r\nItaly, and the eastern part of France, was allotted to Lotharius,\r\ntogether with the title of Emperor; the western part of the empire,\r\nembracing the largest part of France, and Flanders to the west of the\r\nScheldt, became the share of Charles; the eastern part, which included\r\nnearly the whole of Germany and certain parts of Austria-Hungary, was\r\ngiven to Louis. The Treaty of Verdun practically cut the territory of\r\nBelgium into two parts, separated by the Scheldt, and gave each of them\r\nto a different ruler. These two sections of Belgium remained separated\r\nduring the Middle Ages, and were not reunited until six centuries\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Emperor Lotharius (855) the northern part of\r\nhis central territory, located between the North Sea and the Jura\r\nMountains, was given to one of his sons, Lotharius II. That section\r\nwhich included the entire eastern part of Belgium to the Scheldt\r\nembraced peoples of very different race and origin: Frisians, Franks,\r\nAlamans, Walloons. As it was impossible to name the territory after\r\nits inhabitants--they were of too many different origins--it was named\r\nafter its sovereign: _regnum Lotharii_, “Lotharingia,” “the realm of\r\nLotharius.”\r\n\r\nIn 870 the Treaty of Meerssen, whereby Charles, King of France, and\r\nLouis, King of Germany, divided between them the realm of Lotharius\r\nII, ended the existence of that state. The second Treaty of Verdun in\r\n879 finally settled the status of Lotharingia: the boundary between\r\nFrance and Germany was declared to be the river Scheldt, and the whole\r\nof Lotharingia was incorporated in Germany. Of course, all the parts of\r\nthe former empire of Charles the Great were once again united by the\r\nEmperor Charles the Stout, but after all kinds of internal struggles,\r\nLotharingia was again--and this time for many centuries--annexed to\r\nGermany in 925.\r\n\r\nBelgium is thus divided into two tracts by the Scheldt: the western\r\npart, Flanders, belonging to France and politically influenced by\r\nthat country; the eastern part, Lotharingia, which was a dependency\r\nof Germany. As in the establishment of the bishoprics, so here, no\r\nattention was paid to the racial differences of the inhabitants. Both\r\nLotharingia and Flanders included peoples of different origin: Flanders\r\nhad inhabitants of Teutonic origin in the north and inhabitants of\r\nRomance origin in the south; Lotharingia included Flemings in the\r\neast, the center, and the north, and Walloons in the south.\r\n\r\nThus, at the beginning of the feudal system, there existed no political\r\nand no linguistic unity in Belgium. Moreover, although Flanders formed\r\na politically united body, Lotharingia was subdivided into several\r\nsmall principalities: the duchy of Brabant, including the actual\r\nprovinces of Brabant and Antwerp, the county of Limburg, the county\r\nof Namur, the duchy of Luxemburg, the county of Hainaut, and two\r\necclesiastical principalities, Cambrai and Liège.\r\n\r\nThe absence of political unity was a consequence of the new political\r\nconstitution of most of the countries of Western Europe in the tenth\r\ncentury--of feudalism, so called. In place of the former despotic and\r\ncentralized power of the King there was now to be found the locally\r\nasserted rule of dukes, counts, viscounts, etc. These public officers\r\nwho, in the ninth century, were still subordinate agents of the King,\r\nwithout any other power than that delegated to them by their master,\r\nhad succeeded, partly through the weakness of the heirs of Charles\r\nthe Great and partly on account of the invasions of the Normans in\r\nthe ninth century and the incursion of the Hungarians in the tenth,\r\nin grasping more firmly their delegated powers and in making their\r\nmilitary, political, and financial perquisites hereditary. Thanks to\r\nthe custom whereby the King granted them a domain, called _beneficium_,\r\nas a reward for their services or to insure their loyalty, they had\r\nsucceeded in getting a strong political foothold in their respective\r\nprovinces, and had continuously developed their possessions and\r\ntheir influence. In the tenth century the dukes and counts, formerly\r\nofficers of the King, had won for themselves an independent and\r\nhereditary position. The kingdom was now everywhere broken up into\r\nsmall principalities, practically autonomous, where the King no longer\r\nexercised his power and where the people were now dominated by local\r\ndynasties. The new political organization, called feudalism, existed,\r\nof course, in Belgium also, and contributed in a large measure to the\r\ncomplete absence of political and national unity throughout the country.\r\n\r\nEach county, each duchy, became a world apart, had its own politics\r\nand made war on the neighboring principality, or aided it in case of\r\nattack from others. So Flanders enjoyed friendly relations with Cambrai\r\nand Hainaut; Hainaut was on good terms with Namur and Luxemburg.\r\nSometimes they fought one another: Brabant and Limburg were enemies for\r\na long time. Later they became united under the same princes. The same\r\nphenomenon existed in the Northern Netherlands: Holland was friendly\r\ntoward Cleves, but fought against Gueldre on account of Utrecht,\r\nagainst Flanders on account of Zealand, against Utrecht on account of\r\nFriesland, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, Flanders or the western part of Belgium was a vassal\r\nof the French King; Lotharingia or the eastern part of Belgium was a\r\nvassal of the German Empire. The dependency of Lotharingia, however,\r\nwas less definite than was that of Flanders to France, for the numerous\r\nprincipalities into which the former was broken up introduced more\r\nautonomy for the local dynasties and rendered intervention on the part\r\nof the Emperor more difficult. Flanders, on the other hand, as a more\r\nhomogeneous territory, was more closely united with its feudal lord.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate fate of Flanders and Lotharingia depended, however, on\r\nthe degree of independence that their princes would be able to win.\r\nIn accordance with the general politics of all vassals, the counts of\r\nFlanders and the dukes of Lotharingia dreamed of but one thing, namely,\r\nof escape from the domination of their feudal lord. The result was\r\nthat, after some centuries, both parts of Belgium were brought more\r\nand more closely together, and from this resulted that much-needed\r\npolitical unity, the only hope of a real independent Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe political history of the country in feudal times (the tenth to the\r\ntwelfth century) must now be examined.\r\n\r\nAnnexed to the German Empire, Lotharingia became from 925 a sort of\r\nGerman province, especially during the reign of Emperor Otto I (962),\r\na man of powerful personality. Otto clearly realized that no layman at\r\nthe head of Lotharingia would be loyal enough to submit entirely to his\r\nown politics and he therefore appealed to the devotion and faithfulness\r\nof the bishops. These were to be the agents of the German influence\r\nand domination. In 953 Otto appointed his own brother, Bruno, as Duke\r\nof Lotharingia and obtained for him at the same time the archbishopric\r\nof Cologne. Having thus acquired control of both the political and\r\necclesiastical power, Bruno became the intermediary by whom not only\r\nthe duchy but also the Lotharingian church was to be more and more\r\nGermanized.\r\n\r\nHowever, the domination of the imperial German church did not succeed\r\nin breaking entirely the resistance of the local Lotharingian princes.\r\nThose princes had no affection for the Emperor, their overlord; they\r\ncould not forget their old national dynasty, the Carolingians, who\r\nbelonged to the country and were not foreigners, as were the German\r\nemperors. The people of Lotharingia supported those local dynasties\r\nwhich claimed descent from the old Carolingian national stock;\r\nthe castles of the local counts of Hainaut, Louvain, and Limburg\r\nbecame centers of political influence, whose object was to check the\r\ndomination of the feudal German lord. Since the tenth century the local\r\nhouses of Hainaut and Louvain, of Namur and Luxemburg, had attempted\r\nto organize their political power. In the last quarter of the eleventh\r\ncentury, the Germanization of Lotharingia broke down as a result of\r\nthe so-called “Struggle for the Investitures,” whereby the power of\r\nthe Emperor over the church in Germany was destroyed. The bishops of\r\nthe Empire, having to choose between loyalty to their feudal lord\r\nand obedience to the pope, were no longer political servants of the\r\nEmperor. The downfall of the imperial church meant the end of its\r\ninfluence in Lotharingia. The local princes threw off the feudal yoke\r\nand practically divided the whole of Lotharingia among themselves. And\r\nthus was witnessed the end of that large imperial province that for\r\nso long had covered the western frontier of Germany between the Rhine\r\nand the Scheldt. We hear no more of Lotharingia: another name appears\r\nin Belgian history, namely, Brabant. It was the Duke of Brabant, of\r\nthe local house of Louvain, who, from this time on, gradually extended\r\nhis political influence over the former Lotharingia, in that part of\r\nBelgium lying east of the Scheldt.\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor was now no more the lord of the Lotharingian\r\nprinces: he was henceforth regarded as an ally or as an enemy,\r\naccording to the circumstances. The Lotharingian principalities no\r\nlonger played a part in events occurring on the other side of the\r\nRhine; they no longer sent soldiers to the feudal imperial army; they\r\nfollowed the emperors no more in their expeditions against Italy;\r\nand, in the Lotharingian literature, there is to be found hardly a\r\nsuggestion of a recollection of the existence of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the twelfth century on, the national life of\r\nthe eastern part of Belgium displayed more and more cohesion and\r\nindividuality; little by little it broke down the geographical\r\nbarrier of the Scheldt that the Treaty of Verdun had erected between\r\nLotharingia and Flanders.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the western part of Belgium, the county of Flanders, had\r\ndeveloped also in its own way. Assigned by the Treaty of Verdun to the\r\nkingdom of France, Flanders did not seek a separation from a country\r\nto which it was geographically attached and on whose territory were to\r\nbe found the seats of its bishoprics and most of its monasteries. The\r\npolitical power of the house of Flanders dates from the time of Count\r\nBaldwin I, called Baldwin of the Iron Arm (879), an adventurous ruler,\r\nwho violently took the daughter of the King of France, his lord, and\r\nmade her his wife, notwithstanding the vehement protest of her royal\r\nfather. That marriage brought to the count the rich possessions of\r\nhis wife and furnished to his heirs an excellent pretext for meddling\r\nin the politics of France. The kings of France at the time of the\r\nfirst counts of Flanders were weaklings; moreover, the bishops of\r\nNoyon-Tournai, Arras, and Térouanne were not as loyal to their lord as\r\nthose of Lotharingia were to the Emperor. The political conditions were\r\nthus quite different in Flanders, and at a time when the iron policy\r\nof Otto I and his heirs subdued the Lotharingian princes, the counts\r\nof Flanders succeeded in developing their independence and political\r\ninfluence without much opposition. Baldwin II (910) enlarged his domain\r\nby conquering the wealthy regions of Walloon-Flanders[7] and Artois and\r\nformed an alliance with England by marrying an Anglo-Saxon princess.\r\nCount Arnulf (918) took the title of marquess and tried--though\r\nvainly--to overpower the Duke of Normandy, who checked his advance in\r\nthe south and with it the extension of Flemish conquest beyond the\r\nriver Canche. Effectively blocked in their efforts to extend their\r\npower in the south, the Flemish counts next turned their attention to\r\nthe north and the east. Successively the islands of Zeeland, the “Four\r\nMétiers,” and the county of Alost were subjugated, although already\r\nunder the feudal authority of the German Empire. The result was that\r\nthe Count of Flanders became at once a vassal of the King of France and\r\nof the German Emperor.\r\n\r\nBy the conquest of the county of Alost, Count Baldwin V was enabled\r\nto cross the Scheldt and to advance into Lotharingian territory. The\r\nmarriage of his son with a princess of Hainaut resulted in uniting both\r\nFlanders and Hainaut under the same dynasty. Here again the barrier\r\nerected by the Treaty of Verdun was broken down, and for the first time\r\npolitical ties were established on both sides of the Scheldt, between\r\nthe two parts of Belgium.\r\n\r\nCoincident with the first signs of a tendency to union between Eastern\r\nand Western Belgium, Flanders began to come into closer contact\r\nwith foreign countries and powers. As the daughter of Baldwin V was\r\nmarried to William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, many Flemish\r\ntroops took part in the conquest of England by the Normans (1066),\r\nand these remained in the British Isles for purposes of colonization.\r\nDiplomatic and commercial relations between Flanders and England\r\nwere the happy result. Under Count Robert (1070), Flanders came into\r\ncontact with Denmark and with the court of Rome; a pilgrimage to\r\nJerusalem undertaken by Robert brought him into touch with the Emperor\r\nof Constantinople, and the Count of Flanders happened to be the first\r\nprince of Europe to consider a crusade against the Turks.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century, however, the political expansion of Flanders\r\ncame to a standstill. To the weaklings of the former period in France\r\nthere had now succeeded kings of stronger character, whose policy led\r\nthem to subdue their restless vassals and to centralize their own\r\npower. They sought, therefore, to check the expansion of Flanders\r\nand to dominate the powerful county, attaching it more closely to\r\nthe French domain. The road to the south was thus no longer open\r\nfor eventual conquest; the road to the east also was barred by\r\nthe Lotharingian princes. The influence of the German Empire had\r\npractically disappeared in Lotharingia. Brabant and Hainaut now became\r\nthe centers of a strong political life. It is a curious phenomenon of\r\nhistory that, when Flanders was threatened by the growing strength of\r\nFrance, Lotharingia became practically independent of the influence of\r\nthe German Empire.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, as has been seen, no political unity in Belgium\r\nduring the feudal period: east and west each developed in its own way\r\nand political conditions in each section were very strongly influenced\r\nby their powerful neighbors. There did exist, however, a common\r\ntendency toward autonomy and freedom, Flanders trying to escape from\r\nthe influence of France and, to some extent, that of England;[8]\r\nLotharingia struggling against the hegemony of Germany. That tendency,\r\nit must be admitted, is not a purely characteristic Belgian movement.\r\nAt this period the feudalists were everywhere to be found fighting\r\nagainst the supremacy of the King and trying to win complete political\r\nindependence for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe one essentially Belgian factor in the diverging existence of the\r\neast and the west, and which exerted a strong influence in favor of\r\nunification, was the common social, economic, and religious life.\r\n\r\nA study of religious conditions in Belgium during the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries reveals, even more clearly than a study of political\r\nevents, the part played by both Germany and France in imposing their\r\nrespective practices, and the ability of Belgium to incorporate and to\r\nmodify the best elements of Teutonic and Latin civilization.\r\n\r\nAfter the Norman invasions of the ninth century, which left Belgium\r\ncovered with ruins and with many churches and monasteries burned, or\r\nabandoned by their terrified occupants, the ecclesiastical discipline\r\nsuffered severely. The old prescriptions of the Benedictine rule were\r\nno longer observed and most of the monasteries became dependents of\r\npowerful laymen.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century a revival of the discipline followed, thanks to\r\nthe efforts of St. Gerard of Brogne, founder of the little monastery\r\nof Brogne, near Namur (923). Gerard excited so much enthusiasm by the\r\nsanctity of his life and the rigor of his discipline that princes and\r\nbishops united in asking him to restore the practice of ascetic life\r\nboth in Lotharingia and in Flanders. The number of the monasteries\r\nto the north of the linguistic barrier, especially in Flanders, soon\r\nincreased, whereas before they were mainly to be found in Southern\r\nBelgium. Belgium became a country of monasteries in the eleventh\r\ncentury, and ever since that time the people have shown that deep\r\nreligious spirit that is one of the distinctive traits of the national\r\ncharacter. The monks exerted a very strong influence on the minds of\r\nthe rough feudalists, who thought mainly of war and robbery: one of\r\nthe most powerful dukes of Lotharingia, Godefrid the Bearded, desired\r\nto be buried in the dress of a monk. The robber-knights, pursuing an\r\nenemy or a convoy of merchants, thought only of plunder; once in sight\r\nof the walls of a monastery, however, they would cease their pursuit\r\nand turn back. Carrying through the country the relics of their saints,\r\nthe monks would often succeed in stopping private wars and murder. An\r\nexample of the religious spirit is the great “procession” of Tournai,\r\nthat attracted every year thousands of pilgrims and visitors, Flemish\r\nand Walloon together, and that acted as a unifying factor for both\r\nraces of Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe Reform of Cluny found the French and German influence in serious\r\nconflict. The reform in question, by which it was hoped to reintroduce\r\na very severe discipline in the monastic world, originated in French\r\nBurgundy (1004) and soon spread through the northern countries,\r\nespecially in Flanders and Lotharingia. The monks of Cluny resolutely\r\nresented any interference of the temporal power in religious affairs.\r\nAs a result they found themselves practically opposed to the system of\r\nthe imperial and feudal church of Germany, dominated by the Emperor.\r\nThe destruction of that system thus meant indirectly the destruction of\r\nGerman influence in Lotharingia. When the Struggle for the Investitures\r\nbroke out, the Lotharingian bishops hesitated at first, but after a\r\nwhile nearly all of them took sides with the papal cause against the\r\nEmperor. Both in matters of politics and religion Lotharingia tended\r\nmore and more to break away from Germany.\r\n\r\nHitherto only one monastic order had influenced religious life in\r\nBelgium, namely, the Benedictines. In the twelfth century other\r\norders were born--the Cistercians and the Norbertins or Premontrés.\r\nThe Cistercians, founded by St. Bernard in France, played the part,\r\nmainly, of clearers of wild land and of colonizers; they introduced\r\nnew economic and agricultural methods and exerted a deep influence\r\nin economic life. The Premontrés were canons, rather than monks, who\r\npassed their time in study and in administering the parishes. But they,\r\ntoo, did much for the colonization of the country, and they transformed\r\ninto fruit-bearing land the barren soil of the Antwerp Campine.\r\n\r\nThe number of parishes increased in the course of the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries. New chapels were founded in cases where the\r\nnearest parish church was too far removed, or where a number of people\r\nsufficient for the formation of a new parish were to be found dwelling\r\nclose together. Sometimes the establishment of a new parish was ordered\r\nat the instance of a wealthy landlord, and a chapel constructed on\r\nthe domain of his manor, in order to gratify his desire for better\r\nopportunities for attending church. Each chapel was ordinarily granted\r\nthe right to have its own parish priest, to whom was granted permission\r\nto baptize infants and bury the dead in the parish cemetery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL OF TOURNAI]\r\n\r\nAs for the economic organization, in ante-feudal times there existed an\r\nimportant difference between the country south and that lying north of\r\na line drawn through Boulogne, Saint-Omer, Douai, Mons, and Maestricht.\r\nNorth of this line we find the system of isolated farms; south of the\r\nline the system of villages. But during the tenth century the landlords\r\nextended their possessions in farm lands as well as in the villages,\r\nand the same economic organization, directed by the same principles,\r\nprevailed throughout the country. Each domain was divided into two\r\nparts: a central part, including the manor of the landlord and that\r\nportion of the land exploited by himself by means of unfree “serfs”\r\nor agricultural laborers; and another part, surrounding the central\r\ndomain, divided into small lots, given to free farmers.\r\n\r\nThe domain of the ecclesiastical landlords, bishops or abbots, was\r\nexceedingly well administered and the conditions of life of the people\r\ndepending upon these landlords were very favorable; the ecclesiastical\r\n“serfs” frequently asserted that they preferred their servitude to\r\nfreedom, as less burdensome than freedom itself. The ecclesiastical\r\n“serfs” were grouped in families, _familiae_, within whose limits\r\njustice was administered by the mayor of the community in the name of\r\nthe abbot.\r\n\r\nThe lay landlords, on the other hand, were bad administrators. Dealing\r\nonly with politics and war, they ignored agricultural problems; they\r\ndid not come into contact with their laborers, and they left with\r\ntheir officers, _ministeriales_, the care of ruling and judging their\r\nservants. They preferred attendance at “tournaments,” which might be\r\nregarded as a sort of military training and as a means of learning the\r\nprofession of bearer of arms. They undertook long and distant journeys\r\nin order to fight the knights of Vermandois, Champagne, and Picardy in\r\nFrance. And as a result both Walloons and Flemings came in contact with\r\ntheir French brethren in arms.\r\n\r\nThe upper landlords, the dukes and counts, gave much attention,\r\nhowever, to the colonization and the economic improvement of the\r\ncountry. Northern and Western Flanders and Northern Brabant were\r\ncovered with sandy soil and marshes, and thick woods were to be found\r\nin some parts as late as the end of the eleventh century. In the early\r\npart of that century, the counts of Flanders began to engage the\r\nunemployed for agricultural purposes. They turned the unproductive\r\nparts of the country into fertile meadows, suitable for pasturing\r\ncattle. Canals and dykes were constructed in order to increase the\r\nproductivity of the soil. In the course of the twelfth century a sturdy\r\npopulace of land laborers was attracted into Germany by the landlords\r\nof the countries of Bremen, Holstein, Thuringia, and Silesia. It was\r\nthe Flemings and the people of Brabant who colonized the right bank\r\nof the river Elbe and who turned the marshes of Eastern Germany into\r\nfertile soil. Many villages still remind us today of those Flemings,\r\nand are still known as _Flämingdörfer_.\r\n\r\nOn the Flemish seacoast the people were engaged in raising cattle,\r\nespecially sheep and cows; another large element was employed in\r\nherring and cod fishing in the North Sea. These people were mostly of\r\nFrisian or Saxon origin; they were not descendants of the Franks. They\r\nspoke another language; they had other customs and laws; they were\r\nsocially free men. When the French influence increased in Flanders,\r\nthey alone retained their Germanic characteristics, and it was among\r\nthem, in the fourteenth century, that were found the fiercest opponents\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nAs affecting the artistic life of Belgium in the tenth and eleventh\r\ncenturies, we find the same influences at work which have been\r\nmentioned as operative in political and religious spheres. The Romance\r\nand Germanic ideas were absorbed, mixed, and transformed by the Belgian\r\nartists of that time.\r\n\r\nLotharingia, the eastern part of Belgium, possessed, of course, no\r\ncathedrals comparable with those of Worms, Speyer, and Mainz. However,\r\nthe literary movement developed by the Lotharingian bishops was\r\naccompanied by an artistic revival. As most of the Lotharingian bishops\r\nwere of German descent, the direction of the work was intrusted to\r\nGerman architects. The oldest examples of romantic architecture in the\r\nregions of the Meuse reveal German influence. Not only the architects,\r\nbut also the sculptors, the painters, etc., were Germans, though\r\nsometimes recourse was had to Italian artists, who came over the Alps\r\nto seek their fortunes. The frescoes on the walls of St. James’s Church\r\nat Liège are the work of a painter called Giovanni.\r\n\r\nThe Lotharingian artists soon began to imitate the German methods and\r\nto use material native to the country. Supplies for walls and columns\r\nwere no longer brought from Germany, but from the valley of the Meuse.\r\nUntil the twelfth century, German traditions, however, prevailed in\r\narchitecture, and at no time prior to the beginning of that period can\r\nthere be said to have been any Lotharingian style.\r\n\r\nIf the valley of the Meuse was the artistic center of Eastern Belgium,\r\nin the western part of the country--in Flanders--it was the city of\r\nTournai which dominated artistic development. The cathedral of Tournai,\r\nthe only large Romance basilica of Belgium, rivals the cathedrals of\r\nthe Rhine in majesty and harmony of form. The plan reveals the work of\r\nan architect influenced by the German school. But in the architectural\r\ndetails are to be found motifs inspired by the large French cathedrals\r\nof Normandy. The double German and French influence resulted in the\r\nfounding of a local school of architecture at Tournai, which exhibited\r\ngreat activity throughout Flanders. Tournai, the religious capital of\r\nFlanders, became also the artistic capital. The stone of Tournai was\r\nfamous. Thanks to the Scheldt, material was easily transported, and in\r\nthe locality where it was used it was, of course, architects of Tournai\r\nwho drew the plans of the buildings. There existed also at Tournai a\r\nlocal school of sculptors, whose members were very active and who may\r\nbe regarded as true artists.\r\n\r\nThere remains only the literary life in both parts of Belgium during\r\nthe feudal period to be considered.\r\n\r\nDating from the ninth century, there were many to be found among the\r\necclesiastics and the upper classes who spoke both languages, Romance\r\nand Teutonic, equally well. In the monasteries Flemish and Walloon\r\nmonks lived together, and in the Abbey of St. Amand, in Southern\r\nBelgium, there has been found, written by the same hand, the oldest\r\npoem of French literature, the _Cantilène de Ste. Eulalie_, and also\r\none of the oldest products of Teutonic literature, the _Ludwigslied_.\r\nThe bishops and abbots knew both languages; the abbots of Lobbes, a\r\nWalloon monastery in the tenth century, spoke both Flemish and French.\r\nIn the diocese of Térouanne (later Saint-Omer) the bishops were\r\nobliged to know “barbarian,” i.e., the Teutonic language. During the\r\neleventh century, many preachers were able to address the people of the\r\nWalloon and Flemish sections, and abbots who knew both languages were\r\npreferred. The lay princes were obliged at least to understand Walloon\r\nand Flemish, for Flanders, Brabant, and Limburg included people of both\r\nraces. When the army of the crusaders started for the Holy Land, the\r\nLotharingian prince Godfrid of Bouillon was appointed as their leader,\r\nbecause, according to the chronicle of Otto von Freising, “brought up\r\non the frontier of the Romance and the Teutonic people, he knew both\r\nlanguages equally well.” During the twelfth century, the knowledge of\r\nFrench was regarded as a necessary element of perfect culture. On the\r\ncommon people, however, French civilization had no influence at all;\r\nthey knew and spoke only Flemish.\r\n\r\nThe French influence was especially strong from a linguistic point of\r\nview; the German influence was overwhelming in the literary domain,\r\nespecially in Lotharingia. The bishops were, generally speaking, the\r\nsole possessors of literary and scientific culture, and in Lotharingia\r\nmost of them were strongly Germanized. The center of literary life\r\nin Lotharingia was the school of Liège, founded by the Saxon bishop\r\nEverachar. It became a center of study, where not only Germans,\r\nbut also French, English, and Slav students were to be found. The\r\ncurriculum of the school, known as the school of St. Lambert, included\r\ngrammar, rhetoric, poetry, music, mathematics, and theology. This\r\ninstitution was the means by which many new ideas were circulated\r\nthrough France and Germany, as its teachers were in close touch with\r\nall the scientific tendencies of the time. In Western and Southern\r\nBelgium we find the influence of the school of Cambrai as paramount.\r\nAlthough a Romance region, Cambrai belonged to the German Empire, and\r\nwas therefore a center of German influence. The dominating _genre_\r\nin literature is history, and that is an especially Belgian _genre_;\r\nhistory has always been much cultivated in Belgium. The historical work\r\nof a monk, Sigebert of Gembloux, is recognized as the center of that\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe Struggle for the Investitures, which destroyed the power and the\r\ninfluence of the German imperial and feudal church from a political and\r\nreligious point of view, destroyed also its influence in literary life.\r\nThe schools of Liège were abandoned and, from the first quarter of the\r\ntwelfth century on, students turned their eyes toward Paris.\r\n\r\nIn Flanders, literary influence, as was the case with artistic\r\nmovements, was French rather than German. Tournai, the artistic\r\ncapital, was also the intellectual center, and Tournai was a Romance\r\nbishopric. The school of St. Mary had only French teachers and\r\ncontributed in spreading a knowledge of the French language among the\r\nFlemish clergy. Essentially theological and dialectical, however,\r\nthe teaching of St. Mary was less important than the teaching of St.\r\nLambert of Liège.\r\n\r\nThus, during the tenth and eleventh centuries, the civilization of\r\nBelgium was influenced by the culture of its powerful neighbors.\r\nNevertheless, the elements of German and French civilization were not\r\nsimply absorbed; they were transformed, adapted, and nationalized, and\r\nbecame a real part of the life of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE RISE AND INFLUENCE OF THE COMMUNES\r\n\r\n\r\nA new epoch opens with the twelfth century in the history of Belgium.\r\nThe era is frequently called the “Time of the Communes,” because the\r\ninternal political life of the country, from then on, was dominated by\r\nthe development of the free cities (communes) and of their municipal\r\ninstitutions. And it has been said that “in the part played by the\r\ncities since the twelfth century lies the best of the history of the\r\nNetherlands.”\r\n\r\nUntil the rise of the communes, only two classes of people, the\r\nnoblemen and the priests, were given any recognition. There remained,\r\nof course, the peasant farmers, but they had no political or\r\nsocial power. After the twelfth century, a new class sprang into\r\nexistence--the burgesses (_bourgeois, burgers_), the citizens of the\r\nfree cities--and the rise of that class exerted a tremendous influence\r\non the political and social development of the nation. To the tyranny\r\nof feudalism it opposed the spirit of personal and collective freedom,\r\nand the social construction of the nation was materially influenced by\r\nthe introduction of the new elements it represented.\r\n\r\nThe origin and development of the communes was mainly due to economic\r\nconditions: the Belgian cities of the Middle Ages were the daughters of\r\ntrade and industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BELFRY OF GHENT On the right the Town Hall]\r\n\r\nBeginning with the eleventh century many signs indicated a complete\r\nrevival of trade, which had been nearly annihilated by the\r\ninternecine struggles and the invasion of the Normans during the ninth\r\ncentury. At the end of the tenth century Flanders was already in touch\r\nwith the Arab merchants trading in the Baltic; coins of the counts of\r\nFlanders are to be found in Denmark, Prussia, and Russia. The merchants\r\nof that time were traveling merchants, going from one town to another,\r\nand never remaining permanently in any one spot. All along the rivers\r\nwharves were established for discharging goods and wares, as well as\r\nwinter quarters for the traders for the period during which the rivers\r\nwere frozen. These were to be found at Valenciennes, Cambrai, Ghent on\r\nthe Scheldt, Dinant, Huy, Liège, and Maestricht on the Meuse. Bruges\r\nbecame a central meeting-place for Flemish, Walloon, German, Frisian,\r\nand Anglo-Saxon merchants, and between the Scheldt and the Thames\r\ncommercial intercourse was frequent. Little by little there grew up a\r\nspecial class who depended for a living on sale and purchase. A man\r\nbecame a merchant just as another became a knight, a priest, or a\r\nfarmer. All those without land, the discontented “serfs” who succeeded\r\nin escaping from the domain to which they were attached, steadily\r\naugmented this early nucleus of the merchant class.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of England by William the Conqueror (1066) and the large\r\nnumbers of the Flemings who participated in it strengthened the\r\neconomic ties between that country and Flanders, between London and\r\nBruges. In Bruges[9] vessels from all parts of Europe were loaded with\r\ncargoes for London: wine from France and Germany, stone from Tournai,\r\ncloth of gold and groceries sent by the merchants of Lombardy, wool and\r\nlinen cloths manufactured in Flanders. The prosperity of the Flemish\r\ntrade attracted the representatives of European commerce; fairs and\r\nyearly markets were established at Thourout, Messines, Lille, Ypres,\r\nand Douai.\r\n\r\nAlong with trade came the development of industry. On the Belgian coast\r\nthe sheep-raising industry goes back as far as the early days of Roman\r\noccupation; woolen cloths were a special manufacture of the region. The\r\nmore extensive the “polders”--the meadows wrested from the sea--became,\r\nthe more the number of sheep raised on them increased, and consequently\r\nalso the number of people connected with the wool industry. As trade\r\ndeveloped the conditions of that industry, more and more people found\r\noccupation in the manufacture of woolen cloths. A special class of\r\ncraftsmen was born. They deserted the countryside and settled down in\r\nthe neighborhood of the merchants; trade and industry attracted each\r\nother. Flanders then became the seat of the cloth industry.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of industry was in process of development in Eastern\r\nBelgium, in the valley of the Upper Meuse. This was a mountainous\r\nregion, filled with copper and tin mines along the banks of the river\r\nbetween Huy and Dinant. Here was developed a metal industry, whose\r\nproducts were shipped out on the river Meuse. After the tenth century\r\nthe native mines were no longer sufficient for the needs of the\r\ncountry; the population of Huy and Dinant supplied its needs from the\r\nmines of Goslar in Germany. The products of the copper and tin industry\r\nwere exported to France and England.\r\n\r\nBrabant, the central part of Belgium, remained for a long time purely\r\nagricultural. In the middle of the twelfth century, however, a highroad\r\nwas constructed between Cologne and Bruges, passing through Maestricht,\r\nSaint-Trond, Léau, Louvain, Brussels, Alost, and Ghent. Trade now\r\nflowed, not only from south to north by the Scheldt and the Meuse, but\r\nalso from east to west along the new commercial road.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable development of trade and industry was mainly\r\nresponsible for the origin and growth of the communes. Of course, for\r\nmany centuries episcopal residences (_civitates_), castles and manors\r\n(_castra_), churches and monasteries had been centers of civilization\r\nand an attraction for the population of the neighborhood. And under\r\nthe protection of their walls were grouped many wealthy villages.\r\nThe latter, however, would probably never have developed into cities\r\nexcept for the presence of a colony of merchants and craftsmen. These\r\ncolonies established themselves in neighborhoods where they could\r\nfind favorable conditions for trading as well as protection for their\r\ncommerce. Naturally, therefore, they settled in the vicinity of\r\ncastles and convents (the castles affording military and the convents\r\nmoral protection), at the confluence of two or more rivers, along a\r\ncommercial highroad, in the curve of a gulf, or at the mouth of a\r\nstream. In this manner the cities of Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, Louvain,\r\nLiège, Malines, etc., were born, for it is an interesting point of\r\nBelgian history that nearly all the cities originated during the\r\nMiddle Ages, very few of them dating back to the Roman times. Those\r\ncolonies of merchants and craftsmen grouped together in professional\r\nand religious associations were called “guilds,” and introduced an\r\nentirely new spirit among the people of the growing town. The unfree\r\npopulation dependent upon the convent, the church, or the castle had\r\nno means of changing its conditions of life, bound as it was by the\r\nnumerous ties of feudal and other obligations. But the traders had\r\nto secure for themselves a certain degree of liberty, safety, and\r\nautonomy. The feudal régime or the rules of the manor were intolerable\r\nto them. The operation of the system was too tyrannous; it acted too\r\nmuch as a restraint on private liberty and would have rendered the free\r\ndevelopment of commercial and industrial enterprises impossible.\r\n\r\nThe guilds, therefore, formerly purely professional associations, soon\r\nbegan to meddle in politics and to become political organizations\r\nas well. Their members discussed in their guild-halls, built for\r\ntheir business meetings, the changes desired in the existing social,\r\neconomic, and political conditions of the community, and carried on\r\npropaganda in support of their demands.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the members of the guilds began to build walls around\r\nthe settlement, in order to protect the new city against attack from\r\nthe outside. Such a fortified town was called _burgus_, _bourg_,\r\n“borough,” and the inhabitants were called _burgenses, bourgeois_,\r\n“burgesses.”\r\n\r\nWhen the burgesses began to work for changes in the existing régime\r\nof the territory in which the town had developed, the princes and\r\nlandlords to which that territory belonged naturally showed opposition.\r\nIn some cases they resisted the demands of the guild, but the people\r\nwere frequently induced to rebel and, by a revolutionary method, to\r\nwrest from their overlords the rights they demanded. In most cases the\r\nprinces recognized the justice of the claims and granted the burgesses\r\na new law, better suited to the needs of commerce and industry. This\r\nnew law, the city law, different from the feudal law and the law of the\r\nmanor, was called _Keure_ in Flemish, _charte de commune_ in French.\r\nIt contained the political, social, and financial privileges granted\r\nby the landlord and the prince to the burgesses. When the city law was\r\ngranted, the commune came into existence. One of the most important\r\nprivileges of the commune was a special tribunal, called _échevinage,\r\nschepenhank_, composed of citizens and presided over by an officer\r\nappointed by the lord.\r\n\r\nThe commune possessed political and judicial autonomy and its\r\ninhabitants were personally free. A man from a neighboring country or\r\na foreigner who had dwelt in the city for one year and one day became\r\na burgess and enjoyed all the privileges of citizenship. Although\r\npolitically autonomous, the commune still owed certain obligations\r\nto its lord. These were mainly an oath of allegiance and the duty\r\nof assisting the lord with its army of citizens. This latter duty\r\nsometimes created curious situations. At the battle of the Golden Spurs\r\nin 1302, when King Philip IV of France was defeated by the Flemish\r\ncommunists, the inhabitants of Louvain fought on the side of the French\r\nKing against their Flemish brethren, because their lord, the Duke of\r\nBrabant, was a partisan of Philip.\r\n\r\nAlthough the commune owed certain duties to the lord, it had also, as\r\na politically autonomous body, some important rights: the right to\r\nhave a special seal to be appended to the official documents issued by\r\nthe commune; the right to build a city hall and a belfry, the belfry\r\nbeing a tower, usually erected in the market-place, where the bell that\r\ncalled the burgesses to arms was hung, and where the archives of the\r\ncity were carefully kept in iron safes. As the commune exercised the\r\nright of life and death over its members, it erected as symbols of that\r\nright the pillory and the gallows, generally at the gate or outside the\r\ncity wall.\r\n\r\nThe development of the communes was not quite the same in the various\r\nsections of Belgium. In the principality of Liège, the cities of\r\nDinant, Huy, and Saint-Trond obtained their privileges sooner than\r\nLiège itself. The charter of freedom for Huy dates from 1066. In the\r\necclesiastical principality of Cambrai the commune was established\r\nby violently revolutionary means in 1077. The merchants of Cambrai\r\nsuffered from the tyranny of the officers appointed by the bishops,\r\nand a conspiracy was organized. On a certain day when Bishop Gerard\r\nleft the town, the citizens ran to arms, under the leadership of\r\nthe prominent merchants, and proclaimed the commune. But the bishop\r\nreturned unexpectedly and his knights killed many of the people and\r\npillaged the houses of the leaders. The supremacy of the bishop was\r\nrestored for a long period.\r\n\r\nIn Flanders, the counts were sincere protectors of the communes;\r\nthey regarded them as a mighty resource of their treasury and early\r\nrecognized the claims of the _mercatores_. From the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury the main demands contained in the propaganda of the guilds\r\nwere accepted and special privileges were granted to the cities. From\r\nthe time of Count Charles the Good (1119-27), each city had its own\r\n_échevins_ (sheriffs), chosen from among the burgesses; the president\r\nalone, the _bailli_, was an officer of the lord, and responsible only\r\nto him. The house of the counts of Alsace (1128) owed its accession to\r\nthe communes and therefore protected the cities in a special manner.\r\nThey gave to all of them the same municipal charter, a copy of the\r\ncharter of Arras, and both the Flemish and the Walloon communes of\r\nFlanders enjoyed identically the same privileges.\r\n\r\nIn the duchy of Brabant, the communes developed more slowly, owing to\r\nthe fact that conditions for the development of trade and industry were\r\nnot so much advanced here. From the time when the commercial highroad\r\nbetween Cologne and Bruges was constructed the municipal movement was\r\nparticipated in more actively by the princes. Here, also, the princes\r\ncame to assume the same sympathetic attitude as in Flanders, but there\r\nwas no general organization granting the same type of constitution for\r\nall the cities. The privileges of each city were recognized and granted\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the communes exerted a powerful influence on the\r\ninternal politics of the feudal lords of Belgium. The latter were\r\nforced to take the communes more and more into account and to change\r\ntheir political attitude in accordance with the wishes of the\r\nburgesses. The knights, almost ruined by the decline of the value\r\nof the land, rendered military service only when paid for it. The\r\nfeudal troops were no longer sufficient in numbers. The princes were\r\nobliged to seek the aid of the cities, to beg for taxes in order to\r\npay the loans they were now obliged to contract for the allowances of\r\nthe mercenary troops which they were compelled to hire. The princes\r\nno longer governed alone; they had to respect and cultivate the\r\nfriendship of the cities. Their subjects began to take part in the\r\npolitical combinations of the feudalists. As a matter of fact, war\r\nwas no longer possible without the consent of the communes, and it\r\nresulted, therefore, that the burgesses, if in disagreement with their\r\nlord, instead of assisting him, appealed to foreign rulers and fought\r\nagainst their own prince. It may be said that, owing to these changes\r\nin political life, the communes had succeeded in breaking the régime of\r\nfeudalism. This may be cited as a supreme instance of their importance\r\nin Belgian history.\r\n\r\nNo less important was the influence they exerted--mainly during the\r\nthirteenth century--in the development of the economic, industrial,\r\nsocial, intellectual, and artistic life of the country. During that\r\nperiod trade and industry were essentially prominent in the life\r\nof the people. On account of their excellent location, the Belgian\r\nseaports became the meeting-places of vessels from the North Sea, the\r\nBaltic, the Mediterranean, the Orient. Ever since the existence of\r\nthe commercial highroad between Cologne and Bruges the trade of the\r\nformer had declined more and more. Given a shorter route by land, it\r\nis, generally speaking, that which is selected by merchants by which to\r\nforward their goods. Ghent became the center of commercial relations\r\nbetween Flanders and Germany, and many privileges were granted to\r\nGhent tradesmen. Antwerp also grew little by little into an important\r\ncommercial center, being connected with the Cologne-Bruges road by\r\nmeans of the Scheldt, that joins that road at Ghent.\r\n\r\nBruges, however, remained the commercial metropolis. It was in direct\r\ncontact with the sea. Located midway between the Sunt and the straits\r\nof Gibraltar, it stored goods arriving from the north and from the\r\nsouth. A new harbor was constructed at Damme and connected with Bruges\r\nby a canal, whose powerful moles have been immortalized by Dante in\r\nhis _Divina Commedia_.[10] The market-place at Bruges was crowded as\r\nmuch as was the Piazza San Marco in Venice. Toward the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century Bruges was enjoying trade relations with England,\r\nNormandy, Gascony, Spain, Provence, and the Hanseatic cities. In the\r\nfourteenth century the development of the harbor reached its climax by\r\nthe organization of a regular transport service between the Flemish\r\nport and Genoa and Venice.\r\n\r\nThe growth of Flemish commerce was increased by the liberal free\r\nexchange policy of the counts of Flanders, especially since the time of\r\nBaldwin IX (1202). There was no taking advantage of foreign trade, no\r\nheavy taxes, no stringent customs. Many privileges were granted to the\r\n“Osterlings,” the merchants from Germany. If a war broke out between\r\nFlanders and a Hanseatic city, the Osterlings were allowed a period of\r\nthree months in which to leave the country and to put their belongings\r\nin safety. The same privileges were granted to merchants from Poitou,\r\nGascony, and Spain.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, also, Bruges became a center of financial operations:\r\npawnbrokers from Cahors, Lombardy, Florence, and Sienna flocked to the\r\ncity in large numbers and soon monopolized all credit operations. The\r\nLombardic pawnbrokers, especially, invaded the whole country between\r\nthe Meuse and the sea, and it is an astonishing fact that in small\r\ncities like Léau (in the neighborhood of Louvain) branch offices of\r\nthe mighty banking houses of Paris were to be found. The important\r\npart played by the circulation of money is also proved by the many coin\r\nreforms of that time. The Belgian coins, owing to their excellence and\r\nhigh standard, were imitated in Germany by the Hanseatic cities.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the communes manufacture was even more important\r\nthan trade. The Belgian provinces became essentially an industrial\r\ncountry: from Douai to Saint-Trond there is not a city which was not\r\nconnected with the cloth industry. Belgian textures became unequaled\r\nin suppleness, delicacy, and beauty of color; they were to be found\r\neverywhere throughout Europe, and were exported even to the bazaars of\r\nthe Orient by vessels from Venice, Marseilles, and Barcelona. It is\r\nin the south of Flanders that the art of dyeing seems to have reached\r\nthe highest perfection. Ypres, Douai, with its famous _écarlate_, and\r\nArras are especially entitled to mention in this particular. The cloth\r\nindustry was soon introduced farther north, in Ghent and Bruges, and\r\nalso in Brabant. Brussels, Malines, and Louvain early rivaled the\r\nFlemish cities.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Walloon Flanders by France deprived the Flemish cloth\r\nindustry of one of its sources of raw material, and it became necessary\r\nto obtain it from England. Since that time Flanders and England have\r\nbeen naturally dependent on each other and in this fact is to be found\r\nthe reason for the close alliance between these countries, from a\r\npolitical point of view, especially in the fourteenth century. The\r\ncommercial relations between Flanders and England were monopolized by a\r\npowerful association of wool importers, the Hansa of London, composed\r\nof Flemish tradesmen. After a while the cloth industry developed\r\nto such an extent that the supply of English wool was no longer\r\nsufficient: wool from Spain and Navarre was also employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLLEGIATE CHURCH OF SAINT GUDULA, BRUSSELS]\r\n\r\nAside from the territory in which the cloth industry flourished,\r\nBelgium possessed also an agricultural region, far less developed,\r\nof which Hainaut was the center. Here the cities were merely large\r\nvillages: Mons, Binche, and Ath cannot be compared with the cities of\r\nFlanders and Brabant. Namur and Luxemburg also were merely agricultural\r\nregions with no more than 8,000 and 5,000 population, respectively;\r\nwhereas Ghent and Bruges had a populace of no less than 80,000, at\r\nleast at the climax of their development.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Meuse, cities like Saint-Trond and Huy, where the\r\ncloth industry flourished in smaller degree, were unable to rival those\r\nof Flanders. The city of Dinant, on the Meuse, which, as stated before,\r\nwas, from the end of the tenth century, engaged in the copper industry,\r\nmay be singled out. The products of Dinant, called _dinanderie_, were\r\nexported throughout Europe. The merchants of Dinant had a storehouse in\r\nLondon and were members of the Hanseatic Association.\r\n\r\nFinally, there remains the city of Liège in Eastern Belgium. This was\r\na city of priests, the residence of the bishop-prince. It was filled\r\nwith churches, convents, and chapels. The land was owned largely by\r\nreligious communities. But the priests were more numerous than the\r\nburgesses.[11] There was no thought here of industry until the end\r\nof the Middle Ages, when this part of the country became the seat of\r\ncollieries and ironworks.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of such commercial and industrial conditions\r\nas we have recited, the life of the country people and the control\r\nof the soil were entirely transformed. After the twelfth century\r\nthe old agricultural régime broke down and servitude became an\r\nexception; generally speaking, the peasant was thenceforward a free\r\nman, like the burgess. This important change came in connection with\r\nthe crisis introduced by the new economic conditions of the twelfth\r\ncentury. At this time the value of money decreased rapidly and both\r\nthe ecclesiastical and lay landlords found themselves threatened\r\nwith bankruptcy. The methods of the old economic organization had\r\nto be changed if ruin was to be averted. New methods, therefore,\r\nwere introduced by the Cistercian monks. The houses of this monastic\r\norder were very numerous at the beginning of the twelfth century;\r\nthey constituted a class of an entirely new type. Most of their\r\nestablishments were located among the marshes and heaths, which\r\nthey were obliged to convert into fertile soil. For that work the\r\nmonks alone were insufficient; they needed the help of so-called\r\nlay-brethren, who cultivated and fertilized the land. Round the\r\nmonasteries themselves they established large farms, which became\r\ncenters of new agricultural methods. The raising of cattle and the\r\nculture of corn were now their main business, and the crops were not\r\nmerely intended for the consumption of the convent but a large part was\r\nsent to market to be sold. The peasants employed for this work were no\r\nlonger “serfs,” but free workers coming from outside. Servitude did\r\nnot exist on the territory owned by the Cistercians. The monks soon\r\nbecame wealthy capitalists, but they utilized their means in clearing\r\nthe heaths of the Campine, the forests of Hainaut, and in creating the\r\n“polders” of the Flemish coast. At the end of the thirteenth century\r\nthe clearing of the land was finished and the farms and “polders” were\r\nrented out to free farmers. That system was likewise followed by the\r\nother monastic orders, and the class of free farmers soon grew more\r\nand more numerous. The example given by the Cistercians was followed\r\nby laymen. A large part of Brabant, Hainaut, Flanders, and Namur\r\nwas covered with heaths, woods, and marshes. The dukes and counts,\r\nseeing what had been accomplished, began to order this wild land to be\r\ncleared. Along with the clearing of the soil came the foundation of\r\nnew cities. The Belgian cities whose names contain the suffix _-sart_,\r\n_-rode_, or _-kerke_[12] date from this time. In order to get workers\r\nenough for clearing the land, the princes sought to attract them by\r\ngranting special privileges, such as complete personal freedom and\r\ncession of land subject to a very small payment. A new type of peasant\r\nwas born in Flanders--the peasant who was a freeman and who also owned\r\nhis land. The peasants of Hainaut, Namur, and Ardennes were, of course,\r\nless in touch with the modern spirit; the different commercial and\r\nindustrial conditions operated to keep them longer in servitude. Since\r\nthe thirteenth century most of the Belgian peasants have been free,\r\nwhereas in Germany servitude appeared even at the end of the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nAs to the literary life and the respective positions of the French and\r\nFlemish languages at this time, the next chapter, which deals with\r\nthe political conditions of Belgium in the period of the communes,\r\nwill show the increasing influence of France, both in Flanders and\r\nin Brabant. It will not be surprising, therefore, to find that France\r\nexercised an influence upon Belgium from a literary and artistic point\r\nof view also. Flanders, a fief of France, was the first to feel that\r\ninfluence, and to feel it in a greater degree than any other Belgian\r\nprincipality. As a spoken language, French made a strong advance in the\r\nthirteenth century, albeit the conquest was a peaceful one. The wealthy\r\ncommunes of French or Walloon Flanders, like Arras, became real centers\r\nof French literature and culture. The Cistercians spread the knowledge\r\nof French in the monasteries, their order being originally French.\r\nThe aristocracy also took part in the movement, following the example\r\nof the princes. The counts were all of Romance descent. The house of\r\nAlsace came from France; Baldwin VIII and Baldwin IX were Walloons; the\r\ncountesses Jeanne and Marguerite were educated in Paris; the counts of\r\nthe house of Dampierre came originally from Champagne. The language\r\nof the court as well as the language officially used was French. The\r\nwealthy burgesses sought to imitate the noblemen, and it was necessary\r\nfor the merchants to know French to enable them to visit the fairs of\r\nChampagne.\r\n\r\nHowever, we know that some of the commercial acts were written in\r\nFlemish. Flemish was overwhelmingly the popular tongue in Ghent and\r\nBruges, and public officers were obliged to know and speak it, as well\r\nas French and Latin. As before, the common people remained faithful\r\nto the Flemish language; it was the only one they spoke. Flemish was\r\nalso the principal language spoken in Brabant. Here the dukes strongly\r\nresisted French political hegemony, and Brabant remained the most\r\nindependent Belgian province. French was, of course, made use of by\r\nthe dukes in their private and domestic affairs, but Flemish prevailed\r\nin all their relations with their subjects; it was the language used\r\nby public officers. If the aristocracy was Gallicized, it was merely a\r\nmatter of custom and _bon ton_.\r\n\r\nAs to the Romance literary movement, its productions were to be found\r\nin those regions where trade and industry tended to the increase of\r\nwealth. Luxemburg did not produce anything and Liège very little; in\r\nthe latter city, moreover, the persons in the entourage of the bishop\r\nwere largely German or Flemish. Romance literature flourished in\r\nFlanders, Brabant, and Hainaut; it was written in Picard, the original\r\ndialect that the writers themselves preferred, in opposition, so to\r\nspeak, to French. The literature in question consisted partly of\r\ntranslations into the vernacular of Latin works written on science,\r\npartly of historical productions, and partly of poetry. The historical\r\n_genre_ was much cultivated, but was more and more limited to castles\r\nand convents. Although the burgesses of the communes, eager to know as\r\nmuch as possible, found interest and pleasure in the historical writers\r\n(and it may be pointed out that the valuable chronicle of Philip\r\nMousket was composed, about 1240, for the townspeople of Tournai),\r\nthe citizens of the communes preferred the new _genre_ introduced in\r\nliterature, the _poésie bourgeoise_, wherein animals played a large\r\npart as personages; the _épopée_ of _Rinehart the Fox_ is particularly\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nThe rich development of Romance literature in Flanders and Hainaut\r\nprevented to some extent the early birth of an original and independent\r\nFlemish literature. Flemish literature had modest origins: it\r\nconsisted at first merely of translations from the French, but it\r\nis highly interesting to note that it was through the intermediary\r\nof Flemish translations that French productions were introduced into\r\nGermany. The _Legend of Saint Servais_ and the _Enéide_, composed by\r\nthe Flemish knight, Hendrik Van Veldeke, following Latin sources,\r\nenjoyed an immense success and were promptly imitated in Germany.\r\nThe French version of _Rinehart the Fox_ was adapted in Flemish by a\r\ncertain William, who surpassed his model, localized the story to the\r\nneighborhood of Ghent and the country of Waes, and gave to his work a\r\nreal Flemish color.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Flemish burgesses, ordinarily inclined to be\r\njeering and satirical, nevertheless inspired the greatest poet of\r\nthirteenth-century Flemish literature, Jacob Van Maerlandt, called\r\n“the father of all the Flemish poets.” He founded in Flanders the\r\ndidactical _genre_, adapted to the practical and sensible character of\r\nthe nation. His object was to give to laymen access to the knowledge\r\nhitherto monopolized by the clergymen. His writings were in the field\r\nof natural history, politics and ethics, and sacred and profane\r\nhistory. He enjoyed great success and achieved the honor of seeing his\r\nworks translated into French. Maerlandt, although he seemed to despise\r\nthe French poets because he found their work too frivolous, was not a\r\npolitical writer. His greatness lay in the fact that he exercised a\r\ndecisive influence on Flemish culture. He brought the Flemish language\r\nto the rank of a really literary language and developed it into an\r\ninstrument capable of expressing the national genius. The soul of\r\nFlanders lives in Maerlandt’s poems.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains to be considered the artistic development during the\r\nearly period of the communes. French influence was prominent in the\r\nthirteenth century in the southern and western parts of the country.\r\nTournai, of course, remained the artistic center of Flanders, and it\r\nwas through Tournai that Gothic art was introduced into Belgium, just\r\nas Romantic art had earlier been introduced through Liège. The new\r\nchoir of the cathedral of Tournai (_ca._ 1250) is remarkably French in\r\nits plan and methods of construction. But, on the whole, the school of\r\nTournai does not merely copy the French style. It possesses its own\r\noriginality; its type is full of charm and elegance. Its influence,\r\nthanks to the use so frequently made of the stone of Tournai, is\r\noverwhelming in Flanders, especially in Ghent and Bruges and in Hainaut.\r\n\r\nBrabant, on the other hand, has a style of its own, owing to the fact\r\nthat it uses its own local materials, found in its numerous quarries.\r\nThere is a wide difference between the style of St. John’s Church at\r\nGhent and St. Gudula’s Church at Brussels, although their choirs are\r\nnearly contemporaneous. In the course of the fifteenth century the\r\nschool of Brabant became dominant.\r\n\r\nIn another region--that part of Flanders near the sea and known as\r\n“maritime Flanders”--stone from Tournai was not used because of\r\nthe difficulty of access, and here there is also to be found an\r\nindependence of style. There brick was made use of in place of stone,\r\nand, although the inspiration of the architecture came from Tournai,\r\nthe style of that school underwent some change, owing to the difference\r\nin the materials employed. The houses of Bruges reveal the ornaments in\r\nbrick peculiar to that style.\r\n\r\nAn entirely rich and original style, a sign of the power and the\r\nwealth of the communes, is to be found in the civic monuments,\r\nparticularly the town halls. Everyone is familiar with the hall of\r\nBruges and the magnificent hall of Ypres, a gem of beauty. With their\r\nwonderful belfries, their wide rooms, and the vast proportions of the\r\nedifices themselves, they symbolize in a wonderful manner the strength,\r\nthe pride, and the glory of the Belgian cities in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPLENDOR THAT WAS YPRES Now destroyed by the German\r\nbombardments (Cloth Hall, Hôtel de Ville, and Cathedral)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICS AND STRUGGLES OF THE TIME OF THE COMMUNES\r\n\r\n\r\nA consideration of the politics of the Belgian dukes and counts during\r\nthe course of the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries leads to a\r\ndivision of this epoch into two periods. During the twelfth century\r\na policy of maintaining a balance between their mighty neighbors,\r\nFrance, England, and the Empire, was pursued. At the beginning of\r\nthe thirteenth century France gained the hegemony in Europe, and the\r\nBelgian princes were forced to submit to the strong influence of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of the twelfth century the Struggle for the\r\nInvestitures had destroyed German influence in the eastern part of\r\nBelgium. The influence of the emperors was on the wane. One of the\r\nmost loyal of the partisans of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the Count\r\nof Hainaut, succeeded in remaining neutral during the war between\r\nGermany and France. The Count declared that “he was not obliged to put\r\nhis fortresses in the hands of the imperial troops and to grant them\r\npassage through his territory, as that would bring devastation to his\r\ncountry. His country being located between Germany and France, he ought\r\nto remain neutral during this war.”\r\n\r\nThe unsympathetic attitude of the Lotharingian princes toward Germany,\r\nhowever, was not dictated by anything like national hostility or racial\r\nprejudice, for the Flemish principalities, with their inhabitants of\r\nGermanic descent, were as unfriendly as the Walloon principalities.\r\nIt was indifference, rather, for the Lotharingian princes had no\r\ninterests in common with the Empire. They went their own way and had\r\nlittle regard for the Emperor. The social and economic development of\r\nthe country between the Scheldt and the Meuse likewise prevented the\r\npeople of that region from sympathizing with Germany. The culture of\r\nGermany, at this time a purely agricultural country, was far behind\r\nthe culture of the Belgian principalities. The Lotharingian princes\r\nturned their eyes toward Flanders, with which they enjoyed important\r\ncommercial relations. On the other hand, the counts of Flanders had\r\nsought, ever since the reign of Thierry of Alsace (1168), to interfere\r\nwith the countries across the Scheldt and to meddle in the politics of\r\nHolland, Brabant, Hainaut, Namur, Gueldre, and even Liège. Henceforth\r\nthe Belgian principalities, having common political and economic\r\ninterests, will be found to have an increasingly common history. Thanks\r\nto its relations with Flanders, Lotharingia now began to come into\r\ncontact with France and England.\r\n\r\nFlanders, at this time, was very powerful. In 1163 Count Philip of\r\nAlsace had occupied, in the name of his wife, the French counties of\r\nVermandois, Amiénois, and Valois, and had become the first vassal\r\nof the French crown. But at that moment the throne of France was\r\noccupied by a king of very strong personality, who himself directed the\r\ngovernment of France and who had decided to destroy the power of his\r\nrestless vassals. That king was Philip August. He directed his efforts\r\nespecially against Flanders. He is quoted as having once said: “France\r\nwill absorb Flanders or will be destroyed by it.”\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Count Philip of Alsace sought to win the support of\r\nthe German Emperor. Having failed on this side, he turned to England\r\nfor help against the threatening policy of his overlord. This was a\r\nhighly important event (1187), for from that time on it became the\r\nconstant policy of Flanders to keep England as an ally against France.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip of Alsace died suddenly during the siege of Saint Jean\r\nd’Acre by the Crusaders, June 1, 1191, Philip August regarded this as\r\na favorable opportunity to annex the county. He was prevented from\r\ndoing so, however, by the action of the Count of Hainaut, Baldwin V,\r\nbrother-in-law of the late Flemish count, who invaded Flanders and\r\nsucceeded in bringing about the political union of the two counties.\r\nThe county of Artois, however, refused to enter the union, and returned\r\nto Philip August. The latter hoped that, as Baldwin V (IX in Flanders)\r\nhad only two daughters as his heirs, it would be easy to dispose of a\r\nstrong political influence in the country after the death of Baldwin.\r\nAccordingly he brought about the marriage of Jeanne of Flanders, the\r\neldest daughter of Baldwin,[13] to one of his creatures, Ferrand of\r\nPortugal. Henceforth he considered that Flanders would be in his hands.\r\nSubsequent events, however, were to prove his mistake.\r\n\r\nWhen Count Ferrand arrived in Flanders he was met by the action of a\r\nstrong feudal party, secretly supported by the subsidies of Philip\r\nAugust. He tried to escape the threatening French influence and,\r\nfollowing the policy of his predecessors, appealed to England for\r\nhelp. Now began a fierce struggle between French and English gold for\r\ninfluence in the country. Moderately financed by England, the partisans\r\nof the latter became stronger every day. Finally Count Ferrand took a\r\ndecided stand, repudiated his allegiance to his overlord, and openly\r\naccepted the English alliance. Just at this time a vast coalition had\r\nbeen organized against the French king by John I of England, Emperor\r\nOtto of Brunswick, and Henry I, Duke of Brabant, with whom Ferrand of\r\nFlanders joined. On July 27, 1214, the battle of Bouvines was fought.\r\nThe allies were defeated by Philip August; Count Ferrand of Flanders\r\nfell into the hands of his feudal lord, and was imprisoned at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Bouvines established the political hegemony of France in\r\nEurope and the subjection of Flanders. The former policy of balance was\r\nno longer possible for the Belgian princes. In face of the overwhelming\r\npower of the French King, there remained nothing but submission. From\r\nthe date of the battle of Bouvines to the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury Flanders was subject to the political and intellectual\r\ndomination of its strong neighbor.\r\n\r\nThe other Belgian principalities likewise shared the ambition to win\r\nthe friendship of the French King. From now on the French monarchs\r\nfound no occasion for armed interference with the Belgian princes.\r\nDiplomacy met all needs, and agents from Paris, often shrewd Italians,\r\nbrought to the heads of the Belgian principalities the wishes--and\r\norders--of their master.\r\n\r\nOnly one Belgian prince, the Duke of Brabant, resisted the French\r\ninfluence. Since the former duchy of Lotharingia, at the beginning\r\nof the twelfth century, had been broken up into many parts, Brabant\r\nbecame the leading power in the central part of Belgium. The house of\r\nthe dukes of Brabant was indeed the only dynasty that could boast of\r\nits national origin; the other Belgian principalities all fell, during\r\nthe thirteenth century, into the hands of new and foreign families. The\r\ndynasty of Brabant was thus exceedingly popular; it won the affection\r\nof the noblemen and of the communes, and the person of the duke was the\r\nobject of real national affection. Moreover, the policy of the dukes\r\nwas positive and practical, and, above all, paid due regard to the\r\ninterests of their subjects. One of the main principles of this policy\r\nwas the conquest of the commercial highroad between the Rhine and the\r\nsea, upon which the economic prosperity of Brabant depended.\r\n\r\nAs the principality of Liège and the county of Limburg blocked the road\r\nto the east, controlling all traffic between the Rhine and Bruges,\r\nafter the reign of Henry I (1190) the dukes of Brabant turned their\r\neyes in this direction. The war with Liège in Henry’s time was not very\r\nsuccessful. During the thirteenth century, therefore, the dukes sought\r\nto overpower Liège by a resort to diplomacy. As the bishop-prince of\r\nLiège was engaged in a continuous struggle against the communes, the\r\ndukes of Brabant sometimes supported the bishop against the burgesses,\r\nsometimes helped the latter against their lord, according to the needs\r\nof the moment.\r\n\r\nEver since 1283, when the Countess Ermengard of Limburg died without\r\nheirs, the dukes had cast covetous eyes on Limburg. Many pretenders,\r\nincluding several princes from the left bank of the Rhine, had sprung\r\nup. Duke John I of Brabant decided to strike the final blow against\r\nthe coalition formed against him by the lords of Fauquemont, the Count\r\nof Luxemburg, Renaud of Gueldre, and the mighty Archbishop of Cologne.\r\nThe coming battle would decide to whom should belong the supremacy\r\nbetween the Rhine and the Meuse. By skilful diplomacy, Duke John\r\nsucceeded in preventing the Count of Flanders and the Bishop of Liège\r\nfrom allying themselves with his enemies. On June 5, 1288, the armies\r\nmet at Worringen, on the Rhine. The battle lasted a whole day with\r\nterrific onslaughts. The army of Brabant, composed of the knights of\r\nthe duchy, and the communal infantry from Louvain, Brussels, Antwerp,\r\nTirlemont, Jodoigne, and Nivelles, although inferior in numbers to\r\nthe foe, won a complete victory by the superiority of its tactics. It\r\nwas a rout for Duke John’s enemies. Twelve hundred of them fell on\r\nthe battlefield, and both the Archbishop of Cologne and the Count of\r\nGueldre were made prisoners, the Count of Luxemburg and his brothers\r\nbeing numbered among the slain. By sunset, the remainder of the enemy\r\nwas in full flight and the trumpets of Brabant gaily proclaimed the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Worringen had far-reaching consequences. It sealed\r\nthe political decline of the archbishops of Cologne, who thenceforth\r\ninterfered no more in Belgian affairs; Limburg was annexed by Brabant,\r\nand the latter extended its authority over the east of Lotharingia. The\r\ndukes now controlled the commercial road between Germany and the sea,\r\nand commanded the course of the Meuse, and since their sway encircled\r\nthe principality of Liège, no further danger was to be feared in this\r\nquarter. The German Emperor made no protest against the annexation of\r\nLimburg, although it was actually territory of the Empire. It was now\r\nperfectly clear that the influence of Germany in Eastern Belgium had\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\nThis fact encouraged the kings of France to seek to occupy in Belgian\r\naffairs the place formerly occupied by Germany. But although the dukes\r\nof Brabant maintained peaceful relations with France, they had no wish\r\nto become simply the instruments of French politics. They resisted\r\nevery attempt at domination. Henceforth Brabant, thanks to its spirit\r\nof independence, the strong and able diplomacy of its rulers, and the\r\ngrowing spirit of patriotism that characterized its people, became more\r\nand more the bulwark of Belgian liberty. It will be found hereafter as\r\nthe very center of resistance to every attempt at foreign domination,\r\nand, in the sixteenth century, it was the States of Brabant which led\r\nthe struggle against the tyranny of Spain.\r\n\r\nAt the time that the battle of Worringen strengthened the position of\r\nBrabant in Central and Eastern Belgium, a new king, Philip IV, called\r\nPhilip the Fair, ascended the throne of France. His policy was to\r\ncontinue and complete the plans of Philip August, the strengthening\r\nof the central power at the expense of the grand vassals, and the\r\nsubjection of Flanders to the crown.\r\n\r\nThe ruling count in Flanders at this time was Guy de Dampierre, whose\r\nfamily came originally from Champagne. Guy had become one of the most\r\npowerful princes of Belgium. Supported by the French King, he had\r\nsuccessfully brought to an end a struggle with the hostile dynasty of\r\nthe D’Avesnes in Hainaut, had annexed the county of Namur, and had won\r\nreal influence in Liège, Luxemburg, and Gueldre. Philip the Fair soon\r\nbegan to fear the growing might of his vassal and decided to crush it.\r\n\r\nThe internal struggles in Flanders offered him an opportune pretext.\r\nIn the beginning, it was only the wealthy, the merchants and owners\r\nof property, who exercised political power in the commune and who\r\ncontrolled the offices. Later on, the laboring classes, forming\r\nthemselves into corporations, became powerful and claimed the right\r\nto control the administration of the communal finances and a share in\r\nthe public offices. The wealthy--the patricians--resisted, endeavoring\r\nto maintain their preponderance. The result was a violent civil war\r\nbetween patricians and craftsmen, between rich and poor. Everywhere\r\nleaders appeared in support of the poor: at Liège, Henry of Dinant;\r\nat Louvain, Peter Coutereel; in Flanders, Yoens, Ackerman, Artevelde.\r\nGenerally speaking, after the fourteenth century the craftsmen\r\ntriumphed, but everywhere only after bloody revolts. Once victorious,\r\nthe laboring classes in many cities expelled the patricians from all\r\npublic offices and admitted them only when enlisted in some corporation\r\nof craftsmen. In this manner the democratic régime was established in\r\nplace of the former aristocracy.\r\n\r\nNowhere were those democratic struggles so violent as in Flanders.\r\nThere the three powerful communes of Ghent, Bruges, and Ypres\r\ntyrannized over the smaller cities and the country. In order to crush\r\nthe supremacy of the patricians, who were the masters in these three\r\ncities, Count Guy de Dampierre supported the claims of the craftsmen.\r\nIn their turn, the patricians appealed for help to the King of France,\r\nfeudal lord of their count. Thus two parties sprang into existence: the\r\nparty of the poor, who, faithful to the Count, adopted his banner with\r\nthe device of the Lion of Flanders, and took the name of _Clauwaerts_\r\n(“men of the [lion’s] claw”); and the party of the wealthy patricians,\r\nprotected by King Philip, who, owing to the presence of a fleur-de-lis\r\nin the royal French banner, were called _Leliaerts_ (“men of the lily”).\r\n\r\nOn the cry for help by the latter, King Philip invaded Flanders,\r\ndefeated the army of the Count, took his vassal prisoner, and treated\r\nthe country as a conquered land.\r\n\r\nBut the arrogance of the French and especially of the governor, Jacques\r\nde Chatillon, excited the anger of the craftsmen. Those of Bruges\r\nsecretly recalled the _Clauwaerts_ who had been expelled from the\r\ncity. Under the leadership of a weaver, Peter de Coninck, a revolt was\r\nplanned. On a summer day of 1302, in the early hours of the morning,\r\nthe conspirators entered Bruges, surprised the French and their\r\nsympathizers, and killed them. This event is spoken of as _Matines\r\nbrugeoises_, “The Matins of Bruges.”\r\n\r\nExasperated, King Philip decided to avenge the revolt and the offense\r\nagainst his authority. A mighty army again invaded the country.\r\nImmediately the sons of the Count, John of Namur and William of Gulick,\r\ntogether with Peter de Coninck, organized resistance. The struggle was\r\nno longer a merely economic one between patricians and their French\r\nprotectors on one side and the poor, as partisans of the Count, on the\r\nother. It was now a really national struggle, for defeat of the Flemish\r\ncommunes would mean the annexation of Flanders by France.\r\n\r\nUnder the walls of Courtrai, in the meadows of Groeninghe, the\r\nsoldier-citizens of Bruges, assisted by many contingents of craftsmen\r\nfrom other parts of the country, met the flower of the French\r\nknighthood. The apparently impossible happened. The communes, fighting\r\nfor the very existence of their country, defeated the army of the most\r\npowerful king in Christendom.\r\n\r\nThat victory is called the “battle of the Golden Spurs,” because nearly\r\nsix hundred golden spurs, belonging to the French knights, were found\r\non the battlefield and suspended, as a token of thanks to God, in the\r\nvault of the basilica of Courtrai.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the battle of the Golden Spurs cannot be\r\noverestimated. From a political point of view it presents the same\r\nimportance as the battle of Bouvines. It liberated Flanders from French\r\ninfluence and gave the first blow to the hegemony of France in Europe.\r\nIn Rome, Pope Boniface VIII, a fierce enemy of King Philip, arose in\r\nthe middle of the night in order to receive and rejoice over the news.\r\n\r\nBecause the victory saved the national independence of Flanders and\r\npractically prevented the political absorption of the other Belgian\r\nprincipalities by Philip the Fair, the Flemings, on July 11 of each\r\nyear, celebrate the anniversary of the battle of the Golden Spurs as a\r\ngreat event in Belgian history.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Courtrai gave impetus to real national feeling: all\r\nclasses, and not least the priests, contributed with all their power to\r\norganizing further resistance to the French armies. During the first\r\ntwenty years of the fourteenth century Flanders, by its own forces,\r\nwithout foreign assistance, resisted the onslaughts of three successive\r\nFrench kings. After the battle of Mons-en-Pevèle (1303), which brought\r\nneither victory nor defeat for either side, the Flemings arrived with a\r\nnew army, and Philip the Fair is quoted as having shouted in despair:\r\n“It rains Flemings!”\r\n\r\nFinally peace was concluded in 1305 at Athis-sur-Orge. As a result of\r\nthe intrigues of the French agents and the treachery of the Flemish\r\ndelegates the conditions were very unfavorable for Flanders. The\r\nnew count, Robert of Béthune, wanted peace; he did not care for the\r\ninterests of the cities and the victory of the democratic party. The\r\ncountry was obliged to yield and, in 1319, after a new war, caused\r\nby the intrigues of the French King, was forced to abandon Walloon\r\nFlanders, including the cities of Lille, Douai, and Béthune. As the\r\ncounty of Artois had already been ceded to France in the time of Philip\r\nAugust, Flanders possessed no more Walloon territory. It retained only\r\nthe old Germanic portions. It was a severe loss, but by that loss\r\nFlanders escaped forever absorption by the French monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Golden Spurs not only had far-reaching results from a\r\nnational point of view; it also confirmed the victory of the democratic\r\nelements over the patricians in Flanders. In those Flemish cities where\r\nthe latter were masters at the time of the battle they were overthrown\r\nby the craftsmen after the victory. Moreover, the craftsmen of Liège,\r\nin the same year, and under the influence of the defeat of the Flemish\r\npatricians at Courtrai, which taught them that they could win if they\r\nwere organized, inaugurated a revolt against the patricians of their\r\nown city. After many years of bloody struggle, they succeeded in\r\nwresting from the bishop-prince, Adolf de la Marck, the Peace of Fexhe,\r\nthat practically founded the liberties of Liège. In Brabant, some years\r\nafter the battle of Courtrai, in 1306, the craftsmen tried also to\r\nimitate their Flemish brethren but here they were severely defeated.\r\n\r\nThe movement, however, was now everywhere in full swing. The rights of\r\nthe princes were more and more curtailed by the successful revolts of\r\nthe craftsmen, and assurances were required that the privileges of the\r\ncommunes would be respected for all time. These demands resulted in\r\nthe appointment of committees, composed of members of the nobility and\r\nmembers of the cities, the latter preponderating in number, in order\r\nto guarantee the privileges granted the commune at its inception and\r\nthose won during the democratic struggles. We find such a committee in\r\nBrabant, where it was called the Council of Cortemberg (1312), and in\r\nthe principality of Liège, under the name of Tribunal of the XXII.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous privileges won by the people during the communal\r\nstruggles of the fourteenth century is that called the Joyeuse Entrée\r\nof Brabant (1354-56). According to the stipulations of that charter\r\nof liberty, the territory of the duchy was to remain undivided and\r\nundiminished; the seven important cities of Brabant were to keep\r\nin their common possession the documents containing the municipal\r\nliberties; no offensive war was to be waged, no treaty concluded, no\r\ninch of territory ceded, no coin made, without the consent of the\r\nsubjects. Commerce was to be free, and only legal taxes were to be\r\nimposed. The Duke undertook to care for the safety of the roads, to\r\nprotect his people from arrest in foreign countries, to keep peace\r\nbetween the Rhine and the Meuse, and to respect the treaties concluded\r\nwith Flanders and Liège. No native of Brabant might prosecute a\r\nfellow-countryman before a foreign court. The Duke himself was to be\r\nsubject to the laws of the duchy.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the political situation, as revealed by privileges like\r\nthese, with the tyranny of the princes in feudal times, brings into a\r\nstrong light all that was achieved, in point of view of freedom and\r\nliberty, by the communes of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe development of civic freedom and the spirit of democracy, such as\r\nwe have described, in Flanders, Brabant, and Liège, did not exist,\r\nhowever, in the same measure in all the principalities of Belgium. They\r\nwere the pride only of those regions where industrial and economic\r\nconditions had created the necessary basis for such developments. In\r\nthe more agricultural regions of the country they were less in evidence\r\nor were introduced much later, and they did not make so deep an\r\nimpression on the life of the people.\r\n\r\nLuxemburg, for example, was a very large province, but not thickly\r\npopulated. It was far removed from the large rivers, while the hills\r\nand forests made communication very difficult. In the rocky lines the\r\nmanors of the robber barons were built, and those watched the passing\r\nconvoys of merchantmen and attacked them frequently. The historian\r\nFroissart depicts very realistically the aspect of the country.\r\nSpeaking of the passing of the French troops through Luxemburg in 1388,\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n  Two thousand workmen were sent ahead through the forests of Chimay\r\n  and Neufchateau, in order to clear the way for the troops and to\r\n  construct a road for the passage of the 1,200 carts of the army. When\r\n  it had passed the picturesque convent of Orval, the army encountered\r\n  severe difficulties: it advanced only two miles a day toward\r\n  Bastogne, through the passes of the Ardennes, infested by savage\r\n  animals and inhabited only by some colliers. The passage became even\r\n  more difficult in October, when the rivers overflowed from the rain,\r\n  when the rocks were slippery and the roads impassable. The barons\r\n  of the Ardennes took advantage of it for attacking the convoys and\r\n  pillaging the train.\r\n\r\nIn such a country there could be no question of democratic movements,\r\nof freedom and the privileges of cities. During the fourteenth century\r\nLuxemburg was famous, not for its communes, but for its princes. A most\r\nsympathetic figure among them is Duke John, who married Elizabeth of\r\nBohemia and became king of that country. He was the perfect type of\r\nmediaeval chivalry. He went through Italy, Poland, France, and Germany\r\nas a knight errant, fighting for all good causes. Although he became\r\nblind he assisted at the battle of Crécy (1346) and was killed in the\r\nranks of the French army.\r\n\r\nThe county of Namur was far more receptive of the ideas of liberty and\r\ndemocracy than was Luxemburg. The Meuse and the Sambre flowed through\r\nits hills and fields; it possessed commercial roads and copper and\r\niron mines. Here then we find commerce and industry. The craftsmen of\r\nNamur won, little by little and but very slowly, a certain share in the\r\ngovernment of the cities, and after some serious troubles in 1351 the\r\ndeans of the craft-guilds were admitted to public office together with\r\nthe appointees of the Count and the patricians. In the circumstances\r\nwhich attended this struggle and in the acquisition of office by the\r\nguilds we have indications of the lines of cleavage between the classes\r\nand of current political tendencies.\r\n\r\nThere remains the county of Hainaut to be considered. From 1299\r\nHainaut and Holland, although situated far apart, were united under\r\none dynasty, the family of the D’Avesnes. Holland was mainly inhabited\r\nby burgesses and farmers; Hainaut was the last refuge of feudalism.\r\nThe hills of the Ardennes, extending into the country, permitted small\r\nopportunity for agriculture: the rocks were crowned by castles, and\r\nthe forests offered splendid hunting. There was no trade; the existing\r\nmines were abandoned. Of course there was the cloth industry at Mons,\r\nAth, Binche, and Chièvres. But the weavers did not possess the same\r\nspirit of freedom as their Flemish comrades. A timid attempt at revolt\r\nat Valenciennes was quickly repressed. Feudalism continued to prevail.\r\nThe knights of Hainaut spent their time in fighting, especially during\r\nthe reign of Count William (1337-45), who organized expeditions against\r\nthe Prussians and the Moors. At length the noblemen of Hainaut were\r\nnearly all exterminated on the various battlefields of Europe, and the\r\ncities began to add to their importance. Count Albert of Bavaria, in\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth century, favored manufactures, and granted\r\ncontrol over the affairs of the cities to the craftsmen.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was Flanders which played the largest part in the\r\nhistory of Belgium in the fourteenth century. The burgesses of\r\nFlanders had saved the country from French domination. But with the\r\nfoe once defeated, they began to fight each other, and the main events\r\nin Flemish history at this time are bloody internal struggles and\r\ncontinuous revolts against the national princes. Ghent and Bruges,\r\nthe two most powerful cities of the county, were continuously in\r\ndisagreement, and eventually took up arms against each other. Since the\r\nbattle of the Golden Spurs Bruges had retained its democratic spirit\r\nand Ghent remained, as in the time of Philip the Fair, the bulwark and\r\nthe refuge of the patricians. The craftsmen of Ghent did not succeed\r\nin overthrowing their enemies because they were themselves divided. The\r\ntyranny of the weavers was often opposed by the other guilds.\r\n\r\nIt was a question of foreign policy, however, which finally subjected\r\nFlanders to a severe trial. In France the dynasty of the Capetians was\r\nextinct, and a new family, the Valois, ascended the throne. Edward III,\r\nKing of England, claimed to have rights to the French crown and decided\r\nto inaugurate a war in order to enforce his demands. He sought allies\r\non the Continent and succeeded in obtaining the support of Emperor\r\nLouis of Bavaria (1337), to whom he paid a large sum of English gold.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be the attitude of Flanders in the forthcoming conflict?\r\nCount Louis of Flanders was a French sympathizer and took the side of\r\nKing Philip of Valois. The Flemish cities, however, did not desire a\r\nrupture with England; their economic interest depended entirely on\r\nfriendly relations with that country, owing to the fact that they\r\nneeded English wool for their cloth industry.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture appeared Jacques Van Artevelde, a man great in Belgian\r\nhistory. He was a member of one of the patrician families, wealthy,\r\nand much respected. In 1338 he became captain of the municipal army of\r\nFlanders and soon found himself even more powerful than the Count. When\r\nthe English delegates, sent by Edward III to win Flanders to his cause,\r\narrived in the country, they visited Artevelde as the real leader of\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nAlthough sympathetic to the English cause, Artevelde, partly fearing\r\nthe resentment of the French King and partly wishing to prevent his\r\ncountry from becoming the battlefield of the hostile armies, first\r\ntried the policy of neutrality. He confined himself to assuring England\r\nof his friendship, thinking that this would suffice to win for Flanders\r\nthe commercial advantages it needed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the conception of neutrality was premature at this\r\nmoment of Belgian history. The increasing pressure of Edward III on the\r\none hand and the persistent distrust of France on the other convinced\r\nArtevelde that he had to choose between the belligerents. That was a\r\ndelicate and dangerous task, for the Flemings faced a conflict between\r\ntheir commercial interest and their duty toward their feudal lord, the\r\nKing of France. Artevelde, “the wise man of Ghent,” acted cleverly.\r\nOn his suggestion, Edward III declared himself to be the true king of\r\nFrance, for he was the grandson of Philip the Fair through his mother,\r\nwhereas Philip of Valois was only the nephew of the former ruler. The\r\nFlemings, easily convinced by these claims, put their scruples aside,\r\nand accepted the idea of the Anglo-Flemish alliance. The French fleet\r\nwas destroyed by the English at L’Ecluse (1340), but Tournai was vainly\r\nbesieged by the Anglo-Flemish forces. Artevelde became more and more\r\nthe confidant of the English King, who called him “his fellow” and\r\nhighly appreciated his shrewd diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe power of the “wise man of Ghent” soon aroused the jealousy of\r\nmany, and was greatly endangered when the English King, annoyed by\r\nthe reluctance of the Flemings to conclude with him a complete treaty\r\nof alliance, suddenly abandoned his claims and left his allies in the\r\nlurch. A sudden outburst of hostility put an end to Artevelde’s career.\r\nHis enemies informed the people that he had favored England too much,\r\nthat he had given the treasure of Flanders to the English King, and\r\nthat he intended to offer the crown to the Prince of Wales. Only the\r\nlast charge was true. But the people, stirred up by demagogues who\r\nhad planned the fall of the “wise man,” believed what they were told.\r\nA furious mob attacked the house of Artevelde. While he was trying\r\nto persuade them that he was falsely accused, he was overpowered\r\nand ignominiously slain (1345). “The poor exalted him, the wicked\r\nkilled him,” that is the epitaph written by Froissart, his political\r\nadversary, in honor of the greatest Fleming of all times.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Artevelde was followed a short time after by the\r\ndeath of his enemy, the Count of Flanders himself. Louis of Nevers\r\nfell among the French knights on the battlefield of Crécy, where the\r\nEnglish King won a decisive victory. The new count, Louis of Male, was\r\nan enemy of democracy. He had to meet a serious revolt of the craftsmen\r\nof Ghent, under the leadership of Philip, the son of Artevelde. The son\r\nof the “wise man” had no particular military or political talents; his\r\nextraction alone had commended him to the restless people of Ghent. He\r\ntried to renew the alliance with England, but failed. A French army was\r\nsent to Flanders in order to assist the Count against his subjects.\r\nIn the battle of Roosebeke, near Courtrai (1382), the Flemings were\r\ndefeated and Philip Van Artevelde was killed. The whole of Flanders\r\nfell into the hands of the victors, except the commune of Ghent. That\r\nmighty city, thanks to the courage of Peter Vanden Bossche and his\r\ntroops, resisted the kingdom of France for two years.\r\n\r\nFinally, Louis of Male, the last of the family of the Dampierre, died\r\nin 1384. His death opens the rule of the Burgundian dukes in the\r\nhistory of Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe many years of internal struggle had seriously injured the\r\nprosperity of Flemish trade and industry. The finances of the communes\r\nwere ruined; poverty was on the increase; the income from licenses had\r\ndiminished; foreign merchants complained of the insecurity of their\r\ngoods. Edward III invited many Flemish to emigrate to England, which\r\nthey did, and the Flemish counts, by punishing the rebellious cities,\r\nhad themselves cut off many sources of production and wealth. From 1350\r\non, the German Hansa, whose members resided at Bruges, complained of\r\nthe heavy taxes, and of the complete lack of peace and safety. In 1380\r\nthe Count banished the merchants, charging them with having plotted\r\nagainst his authority and with having assisted the Flemish rebels. This\r\nwas a serious blow to the prosperity of the country. The Hansa left\r\nBruges for Antwerp. Here began the decline and fall of the once famous\r\nseaport.\r\n\r\nIf we look back at this stage of the political development of the\r\nBelgian principalities during the time of the communes we note a\r\ngrowing tendency to consolidation on the part of most of the duchies\r\nand counties. At the end of the fourteenth century, Flanders,\r\nBrabant, and Limburg were united under one dynasty; the same thing\r\noccurred in the case of Hainaut and Holland. Little by little the\r\nseparation resulting from the treaty of Verdun in the ninth century\r\nhad disappeared, and all parts of Belgium had gradually experienced\r\nthe imperceptible drawing together which time had effected. They were\r\nultimately to be united, as a political body, by the dukes of Burgundy.\r\nTo explain that result is the task of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE UNION OF THE BELGIAN PRINCIPALITIES UNDER THE DUKES OF BURGUNDY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when all the Belgian principalities had won their\r\ncomplete political autonomy and rejected the French, the English, and\r\nthe German influence, they were brought together under the scepter\r\nof one dynasty, and became united in a solid monarchic federation.\r\nAs such, they constitute, between Germany and France, that buffer\r\nstate represented on the map of Europe by the kingdoms of Belgium\r\nand Holland. The unconscious tendency of the preceding centuries was\r\nbrought to a head in the fifteenth century by the dukes of Burgundy.\r\nThey were aided in large part by the political circumstances of the\r\ntime. France was exhausted after the Hundred Years’ War and Germany had\r\nlost the prestige and the strength of its monarchic power. In favoring\r\nthe desire for a union of the Belgian principalities, the dukes saved\r\nBelgium from conquest or absorption by France. They continued and\r\ncompleted the work of the warriors of the battle of the Golden Spurs.\r\nThe Scheldt was no longer a political barrier between the east and the\r\nwest of the country. Belgium, as a united political body, was now for\r\nthe first time a reality.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of the Burgundian dukes may be considered from two\r\npoints of view. We may consider the territorial and geographical\r\nconsolidation and the political reform.\r\n\r\nAs for the territorial consolidation, there existed, at the end of\r\nthe fourteenth century, three ruling houses in Belgium, each of them\r\ndominating many provinces, and each hoping to bring the whole country\r\nunder its scepter. These houses were those of Luxemburg, Bavaria, and\r\nBurgundy. The house of Luxemburg had annexed to its hereditary duchy\r\nthe duchies of Brabant and Limburg; that of Bavaria ruled Hainaut,\r\nHolland, and Zeeland; that of Burgundy possessed the duchy of the same\r\nname with the counties of Flanders and Artois. It was the Duchess\r\nJeanne of Brabant who turned the scale in favor of Burgundy. Although\r\nshe had promised the duchy of Brabant to the house of Luxemburg, she\r\ngave it to her niece, wife of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy and\r\nCount of Flanders. So, in 1404, according to the testamentary devises\r\nof the late Jeanne of Brabant, Brabant and Limburg went to Antoine,\r\nyoungest son of Philip the Bold, while to John without Fear, the eldest\r\nson, were given Flanders and Artois. There were thus a Flemish and\r\na Brabantine branch of Burgundy. Antoine, Duke of Brabant, married\r\nElizabeth of Gorlitz, heiress of the duchy of Luxemburg, and annexed\r\nthat vast territory to his two other duchies (1409). His son John\r\nIV, by his marriage with Jacqueline of Bavaria, added to the duchies\r\ntransmitted by his father the counties of Hainaut, Holland, Zeeland,\r\nand the seigneurie of Friesland. John IV was an insignificant prince.\r\nHistory remembers him for having, in 1425, founded the University\r\nof Louvain. His brother, Philip de Saint-Pol, died without issue,\r\nand thereupon the states of Brabant offered the possessions of the\r\nBrabantine branch of Burgundy to the head of the Flemish branch, Philip\r\nthe Good, Count of Flanders (1430). As Philip the Good had purchased\r\nin 1429 the county of Namur, practically all the Belgian principalities\r\ncame under the same rule. At this moment the unity of Belgium was born.\r\nOnly the three ecclesiastical principalities of Cambrai, Liège, and\r\nUtrecht failed to become united with the other provinces, and in these\r\nthe Burgundian dukes exerted their influence by appointing members of\r\ntheir family as bishops or by supporting candidates in the episcopal\r\nelections who were devoted to their interests.\r\n\r\nPhilip the Good, whom the historian Juste Lipse called, in the\r\nseventeenth century, _conditor Belgii_ (“the founder of Belgium”),\r\nwas known in his own times as the Grand Duke of the West. The fame of\r\nhis power was carried to the Mediterranean, where his vessels fought\r\nthe Turkish pirates. He lacked only the title of king. He instituted\r\nnegotiations with the Emperor for restoring in his favor the former\r\nkingdom of Lotharingia. These negotiations did not succeed because he\r\nrefused to pay to Frederick III, the German Emperor, the sum the latter\r\ndemanded, and to give the oath of allegiance and vassalage for those\r\nparts of his possessions which were fiefs of the Empire. He boasted to\r\nan envoy of Louis XI, King of France, that “he wanted them to know he\r\ncould have been king, if he had only willed it.”\r\n\r\nHis work was nearly destroyed by the extravagant plans and the ambition\r\nof his son, Charles the Bold, who succeeded him in 1467. The reign of\r\nCharles was dominated by the struggle with the shrewd King of France,\r\nLouis XI. This king watched with anxiety the increasing power of one of\r\nhis vassals, and tried to circumvent his plans in all possible ways.\r\nThe schemes of Charles the Bold were fantastically extensive, and the\r\nhistorian Philip de Comines said of him: “He tried so many things that\r\nhe could not live long enough to carry them out, and they were indeed\r\nalmost impossible enterprises.”\r\n\r\nAs the house of Burgundy tried to dominate the principality of Liège,\r\nCharles followed that policy by imposing upon the citizens of Liège\r\nthe candidacy of Louis of Bourbon as bishop-prince. The people of the\r\nprincipality, stirred up by the French King, rose against the mighty\r\nduke. They paid a heavy price. In 1466 the town of Dinant was sacked by\r\nthe troups of Charles the Bold, and in 1468 Liège shared the same fate.\r\nUnspeakable atrocities were committed by the Burgundian army, and fire\r\nand sword nearly decimated the populace. These disasters placed the\r\nprincipality for at least ten years under the domination of Charles.\r\n\r\nThe states of the Burgundian dukes were composed of two sections,\r\nseparated from each other by independent principalities. In the south,\r\nthey possessed the duchy of Burgundy and the county of the same name,\r\nalso called Franche-Comté; in the north, Belgium and a large part of\r\nthe Dutch provinces were in their hands. From 1469 on, Charles tried\r\npatiently but relentlessly to bring together both parts of his state.\r\nHe took Lorraine by force and got in _engagère_ Alsace, Brisgau, and\r\nother minor principalities. In the north he succeeded, in 1472, in\r\nwinning, by the testament of the late Arnold of Gueldre, the duchy of\r\nthat name and the county of Zutphen.\r\n\r\nAdopting the plan which his father had devised, but enlarging\r\nit considerably, he began negotiations with the Emperor for the\r\nreconstitution of the former mediaeval kingdom of Burgundy, and for\r\nhis appointment as King of the Romans and successor to the Empire. He\r\nfailed where Philip the Good had failed.\r\n\r\nHe intended next to conquer the country of his enemy, Louis XI.\r\nAfter the conquest he planned to divide France between himself and\r\nhis brother-in-law, Edward of England. In order to avoid the danger,\r\nthe French King cleverly entangled his vassal in a war with the\r\nSwiss. Charles fought the battle of Nancy under very unfavorable\r\ncircumstances. His army was severely defeated and he himself killed.\r\nHis body was discovered in the ice of a frozen pool, pierced by three\r\ndeadly wounds and half devoured by wolves.\r\n\r\nHis young daughter Mary took on her shoulders the heavy burden entailed\r\nupon her as his successor.\r\n\r\nThe territorial federation of all the Belgian principalities by the\r\nBurgundian dukes involved as a consequence the political unification\r\nof these provinces. Having but one prince, they also had but one\r\ngovernment. It was necessary, of course, that the individual\r\ninstitutions of each principality should disappear, and the political\r\nlife of the country was subjected to the centralizing tendency of a\r\ncommon monarchy. Above the local institutions were established central\r\ninstitutions, common to all the territories: the council of the duke,\r\nan advisory body; the chancellor of Burgundy, a kind of prime minister;\r\nthe Grand Council, a governmental body, which Charles the Bold, more\r\nautocratic than his father, divided into two new colleges, with\r\ndistinct functions--the Council of State, a political college, and the\r\nParliament of Malines, a supreme court of justice (1473).\r\n\r\nSuch a centralization of the national institutions was quite necessary\r\nif the danger of being dominated by France was to be avoided. France\r\nwas rapidly becoming united under the leadership of its kings, who\r\npossessed a permanent army, the right to impose a perpetual _taille_,\r\nand the exercise of sovereign justice. In the face of this united and\r\npowerful monarchy, the Burgundian state could not remain separated. The\r\nBelgian provinces could no longer remain isolated from each other and\r\nlimit themselves to an individualistic and egotistic policy. It was\r\nseen that everything ought to be concentrated in the hands of a strong\r\nprince. That was the new idea that was introduced into the constitution\r\nof the Belgian principalities, an idea that had never appeared prior to\r\nthe fifteenth century. Throughout the Middle Ages the antiquated idea\r\nof the state as a collective person distinct from its members never\r\nclearly appears. The concept of sovereignty--absolute power subject to\r\nno control--was also lacking. The individual life dominated the life of\r\nthe community. Little by little the renascence of the study of Roman\r\nlaw introduced other concepts, namely, those of state and sovereignty.\r\nThe students of Roman law, the “legists,” stood for a government that\r\nwould be one, indivisible, strong, absolute, and active. They believed\r\nthat all that tended to limit the complete exercise of public authority\r\nshould be discarded: the state was held to be impersonal and almighty.\r\nThat new concept of the state was embodied in the politics of the\r\nBurgundian dukes during the fifteenth century. Centralization and the\r\nabsolute power of the prince took the place of the former personal\r\nand collective privileges. This idea triumphed, not only because the\r\nBurgundian dukes were strong, but also because it was in accordance\r\nwith the needs of the time and the wishes of the majority of the people.\r\n\r\nOf course, the dukes, when they tried to realize their political\r\ncentralization, met with some resistance on the part of the powerful\r\ncommunes. But Philip the Good cleverly avoided any open fight. He\r\nsimply tried to subject the cities to his control--to prevent them from\r\nbeing a state within the state. He took part in the appointment of the\r\nmagistrates, ordered their accounts to be examined by his officers,\r\nforbade advantage to be taken of the small cities and the peasantry,\r\nand made the judgments of their tribunals subject to review by his own\r\ncouncils of justice. Flanders endeavored to evade the results of that\r\npolicy. There were serious revolts in Bruges (1436-47) and in Ghent\r\n(1450-53), and the cities of Brabant, particularly Malines, seemed\r\nunwilling to adapt themselves to the new situation.\r\n\r\nAll this local resistance was ruthlessly broken by Charles the Bold\r\nwhen he became duke. The autonomy of the cities was completely\r\ndisregarded, the traditions were changed without consideration, the\r\nprivileges remained unrecognized. Charles kept the appointment of\r\nall the municipal charges in his own hands. The omnipotence of the\r\nsovereign was, according to him, the only warrant for order and\r\njustice, such as he himself desired for his possessions.\r\n\r\nPolitical centralization would, however, never have been achieved by\r\nthe dukes if they had not enjoyed the support of certain classes of the\r\npeople. They had, indeed, the help of the noblemen, who were despised\r\nand ignored by the communes, and were therefore ready to help all the\r\nenemies of the cities. Moreover, the dukes succeeded in destroying the\r\nfeudal character of the nobility, in softening it, and in converting it\r\ninto a body of courtiers. They attracted the noblemen by making them\r\nroyal allowances, by granting them gifts of land or money, offices\r\nat court, etc. A golden chain soon bound all the feudalists, once so\r\nindependent; and life at court soon robbed them of their former spirit\r\nof freedom. Before long, the favor of the prince constituted the only\r\nchance of success in political and social life. In order to keep the\r\nnobles loyal to his person, Philip the Good founded at Bruges, in 1480,\r\nthe famous and privileged order of the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nOnly the Burgundian and Picardian nobles, however, were to be found at\r\ncourt, occupying the public offices, and entirely submissive to their\r\nsovereign. The Belgian nobles could not forget that the rights of the\r\nprince, according to national tradition, were not without limits; they\r\ndesired a guaranty against the dangers of personal government. They\r\ndesired a government in which the duke would not be able to declare\r\nwar without the consent of the states, in which he would regulate his\r\nexpenses in accordance with the income of his domain, and in which he\r\nwould act only after having taken the advice of his council.\r\n\r\nThe dukes were also supported in their efforts toward centralization\r\nby the clergy. Philip the Good had abolished exemption from taxation\r\ntill that time enjoyed by the clergy, asserting that the common law\r\nwas opposed to such privileges. Following the example of the King of\r\nFrance, the Duke limited the temporal power of the clergy, narrowed\r\ntheir jurisdiction, and imposed upon the church his candidates for\r\nbishoprics and monasteries. On the other hand, the Duke extended the\r\npolitical power of the clergy, giving them the first place in the\r\nStates-General and in the councils. The States-General was a new\r\ninstitution, also introduced by the Burgundian dukes. Before the\r\nexistence of the States-General, the prince was compelled, whenever\r\na levy of taxes was desired, to deliberate separately with the\r\ndelegates of each Belgian province and to obtain their consent. Philip\r\nthe Good thought it more expedient to gather them all together in\r\nhis presence at the same time. That meeting was called the meeting\r\nof the States-General. As the States-General did not meet except\r\nat the express order of the sovereign, and for his own advantage,\r\nthis institution served as an instrument for weakening provincial\r\nindividualism and strengthening the central government.\r\n\r\nIn the States-General the clergy were granted the first place; they, as\r\nwell as the nobles, therefore became supporters of the policy of the\r\ndukes. By such methods, by persuasion, by distribution of money, and\r\neven by violence, the Burgundian dukes succeeded in transforming the\r\ninstitutions of the Belgian principalities into a monarchical rule.\r\n\r\nMost of the new institutions were modeled after those existing in\r\nFrance, but adapted to the local situation and needs of Belgium. No\r\nprincipality lost its own autonomy, its own constitution, or its\r\nprivileges. The Burgundian state was an agglomeration of states, a\r\njuxtaposition of territories. There was no universal power; the dukes\r\nwere not “princes of Belgium” or “princes of the Netherlands”; they\r\nruled every principality separately and were dukes of Brabant, counts\r\nof Flanders, dukes of Luxemburg, counts of Hainaut, Namur, etc. But\r\ntheir power was as vast as their wealth. When Philip the Good died in\r\n1467, he left a personal fortune whose annual income nearly equaled\r\nthat of the republic of Venice and was as much as four times that of\r\nthe republic of Florence, three times that of the King of Naples, twice\r\nthat of the Pope and of the Duke of Milan. No wonder that he was called\r\n“the Grand Duke of the West.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASTERPIECE OF MATHIEU DE LAYENS: TOWN HALL OF\r\nLOUVAIN (It escaped destruction during the conflagration of August 26,\r\n1914)]\r\n\r\nWhat about the Belgian civilization in the time of the Burgundian dukes?\r\n\r\nWe know that, toward the end of the fourteenth century, Flanders\r\nsuffered a decline after the bloody civil war: the German merchants\r\nleft Bruges, Ghent lost a part of its population, Ypres was half\r\ndestroyed, Ostend became a sandy waste. The “polders” were inundated;\r\nwolves and wild boars infested the country.\r\n\r\nFifty years later, during the reign of the Burgundian dukes, Belgium\r\nhad again become the richest country in Europe. That revival was, of\r\ncourse, not attributable to the dukes alone. It must be remembered\r\nthat the Belgians are an industrious people and that the geographical\r\nposition of the country is highly favorable. But the political union of\r\nall the provinces, peace, and a good administration contributed largely\r\nto the revival of the nation. The political work of the Burgundian\r\ndukes brought about the unification of coinage, the free relations\r\nbetween the different principalities, the order and safety necessary\r\nfor the development of trade and industry. From an economic point of\r\nview, the dukes endeavored to conserve and to enlarge the resources\r\nof the country. They took prohibitive measures against the English\r\ncloth industry in favor of the Flemish manufacture. Charles the Bold\r\nendeavored to dredge the sand out of the harbor of Bruges and to save\r\nthat city from disaster. In the fifteenth century Antwerp, supported\r\nby the dukes, became the largest market of the north. In Luxemburg the\r\ngold and silver mines began to be operated, employing the mine-workers\r\nof the region of Liège.\r\n\r\nAlthough the economic policy of the dukes may be described as still\r\nsomewhat incoherent, it may yet be said to have embraced excellent\r\nprinciples. A declaration is preserved to the effect that “one of the\r\nmain points of all good policy, upon which the public welfare is based,\r\nis to get and to keep good and lasting money, as well golden as silver\r\ncoin.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these principles and the various measures taken for the\r\nprotection of trade, a crisis in the cloth industry was soon apparent.\r\nThis was due to the transformation in the wool trade. Bruges was the\r\nbig wool market of the Continent, but, since the development of the\r\nEnglish cloth industry, the English producers had kept the raw material\r\nat home, thereby diminishing the stock of wool in Flanders. The price\r\nhad greatly increased, and Flemish manufacturers were obliged to use\r\nSpanish wool of inferior quality. This, of course, spelled the decline\r\nof the Belgian cloth industry. The decline of Louvain’s prosperity was\r\nsomewhat mitigated by the foundation there of the University in 1425.\r\nNothing, however, could save Ypres. Its craftsmen, threatened with\r\nstarvation, migrated to England; houses were abandoned and fell into\r\nruin; in 1456 a third of the population was begging for bread along the\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nOther parts of the country were less affected by the crisis in the\r\ncloth industry. Ghent had its grain staple; Brussels, where the dukes\r\nresided, imported articles of luxury; Malines had its Parliament;\r\nAntwerp took the place of Bruges as a seaport. Since 1442, English\r\nmerchants had settled in Antwerp, and this meant the end of Bruges and\r\nof the part played by Flanders in the economic life of Belgium. It was\r\nnow the turn of Brabant. At the same time, a new industry was being\r\nintroduced into Flanders and Brabant, the technical features of which\r\nwere much the same as those of the cloth industry. Wool was replaced\r\nby flax, and instead of cloth manufacture we hear next of the linen\r\nindustry. As manufacture on a large scale, mediaeval in its forms and\r\nrestrictive and exclusive in its spirit of corporation, could no longer\r\nsupport itself, the new linen industry soon came to be carried on in\r\nthe homes of the operatives, mainly in the country. Driven out of\r\nFlanders by circumstances, the cloth industry now sought to prolong its\r\nlife in a little town of the Ardennes--Verviers, near Liège (1480).\r\n\r\nThe conditions of trade likewise experienced decline and revival at the\r\nsame time. In this particular the outstanding feature is the decline of\r\nBruges. As is well known, credit operations on a large scale sometimes\r\nbring about big bankruptcies. Until the death of Charles the Bold\r\n(1477), Bruges remained the financial and banking center of Europe.\r\nIt was filled with Italian bankers, among them agents of the Medici,\r\nthe Portinari, and the Guidetti. A large number of foreign merchants\r\nresided at Bruges, grouped in colonies known as “nations.” Among them\r\nwere the “nations” of Florence, of Spain, and of the Osterlings. In\r\n1457 the shipping in the harbor was represented by three vessels\r\nfrom Venice, one from Portugal, two from Spain, six from Scotland,\r\nforty-two from Bretagne, twelve from Hamburg, four whale-boats, and\r\nthirty-six to forty fishing smacks. The vessels came mainly from Spain\r\nand Portugal. They brought merchandise hitherto unknown to the people\r\nof Belgium: oranges, lemons, rose-water, candy, jam, oriental tapestry,\r\netc. From the Portuguese warehouses in Africa came monkeys, lions,\r\nparrots.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the fifteenth century, however, for reasons already\r\nindicated, the merchants of the German Hansa left Bruges. As a result\r\nof the fall of the Flemish cloth industry and the prohibitive measures\r\ntaken against England in favor of Flanders, the shipping company of the\r\nEnglish Merchant Adventurers sent large numbers to settle at Antwerp\r\nin 1442-44. They were joined by the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese\r\nmerchants. The bankers soon followed. At the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury the glorious old Flemish city showed 4,000 to 5,000 empty\r\nhouses. From then on it became known as “Bruges la morte.” Its rival,\r\nAntwerp, had become the center of the cloth-weaving industry.\r\n\r\nThe inundations in Zeeland at the beginning of the fifteenth century\r\nhad considerably enlarged the western Scheldt and afforded a direct\r\nroute to the sea. Taking advantage of this circumstance, Antwerp,\r\nfrom the very beginning, showed a highly modern and liberal spirit.\r\nIt reduced the taxes on foreign merchants, whereas Bruges, in order\r\nto save the situation, maintained its restrictive and drastic\r\nlegislation and tried to uphold its economic privileges and its\r\nhighly protectionist measures. Moreover, Antwerp did not share the\r\nrevolutionary spirit of the Flemish communes. There were no bloody\r\nstruggles against the dukes, and there was the best of understanding\r\nwith the central power.\r\n\r\nThe new spirit of Antwerp is shown in its commercial organization.\r\nThere were two fairs yearly, held on the principle of commercial\r\nliberty. Those visiting the fairs were protected by a special\r\npassport. Whereas a monopoly existed in the professions of broker and\r\nmoney-changer in Bruges, at Antwerp they were open to all. The right of\r\ncitizenship was easily acquired. In 1460, Antwerp established the first\r\nexchange that existed in Europe. At the end of the fifteenth century\r\nthe city had become the great commercial center of the north. But, as\r\nearlier in the case of Bruges, the more important commerce was in the\r\nhands of foreigners. The people of Antwerp were but auxiliaries and\r\nintermediaries, brokers, forwarding agents, charterers of vessels, etc.\r\nThe same phenomenon is observable in the Antwerp of today.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the political and economic transformations which\r\nresulted in such crises in city life proved advantageous for the\r\npeasantry, for the people of the countryside. The decline of the\r\ntyranny of the big cities tended to bring to the peasant more and more\r\nof freedom. He was now free to engage in industry at home and to become\r\na paid workman in the service of the capitalist. The old restrictions\r\nof the feudal law and the law of the manor were gone.\r\n\r\nEven in the realm of charity the changing order was manifest. It was\r\nnow taken in hand by the state. Special ordinances against beggars\r\nwere issued in 1461 for Flanders and Brabant. Heretofore, the beggar\r\nhad been abandoned to the tender mercies of the church and of private\r\ncharity. Thenceforth he was taken in hand by the government. The\r\nstate refused to encourage beggars; it controlled them and forced\r\nthem to work. A special license for begging was granted to children\r\nunder twelve years and to persons over sixty years, and to mothers\r\nwith numerous children and without work. Those found begging without\r\na license were imprisoned. The institutions for charity, heretofore\r\nexclusively religious, were taken over by the local governments. Boards\r\nof trustees were appointed by the municipalities and the finances were\r\ncontrolled by the _échevins_.\r\n\r\nAs for literary and artistic conditions in the Burgundian period, it\r\nis to be noted that French influence gradually disappeared after the\r\nbattle of the Golden Spurs. French of course remained the language of\r\nthe court, of the nobility, of the wealthy citizens. French, together\r\nwith Latin, also remained as the language of diplomacy. But it made\r\nno more gains. At this time Flemish began to take its place in civic\r\nlife. As a result of the victory of democracy in most of the cities,\r\nFlemish became the language of the administration and was used for\r\nthe registration of real estate and for accounts. Through existing\r\nrelations with the merchants of the Hansa it became also the language\r\nof commercial affairs. Primary schools were established in all the\r\ncities, and instruction was given in the language of the people. The\r\nliterary works of Van Maerlandt, whose influence has already been\r\ndescribed, came freely into the possession of, and were read by, the\r\nhumblest craftsmen.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles the Bold tried to impose French as the only official\r\nlanguage, vigorous discontent was the result, and in 1477 the so-called\r\n“Grand Privilege” of Mary of Burgundy resulted in the re-establishment\r\nof Flemish. The knowledge of Flemish also spread through the Walloon\r\ncountry. Walloon merchants settled in Antwerp and Flemish merchants\r\nwent to Namur and Dinant.\r\n\r\nUnder these favorable conditions, Flemish literature developed rapidly;\r\nbut the development mainly affected Brabant. Brabant now took the place\r\nformerly occupied by Flanders. The Brabantine dialect, instead of\r\nthe Flemish one, soon became dominant in literature. One of the best\r\nwriters of this time was Jan Boendale (†1365), the famous author of the\r\n_Brabantsche Yeesten_ (“Deeds of Brabant”). Boendale was serious and\r\npractical, and had no sympathy for France, like Van Maerlandt. He was\r\nan enemy both of the democracy and of the nobility; the merchants and\r\nthe peasants were the classes with which he showed the most sympathy.\r\nAnother Flemish author of great fame was Jan Van Ruysbroeck (†1381),\r\nalso a native of Brabant. He was the herald of mysticism and of divine\r\nlove, and occupies the first rank among all the religious writers of\r\nthe Middle Ages. He wrote in a wonderful prose and surpassed everyone\r\nin inspiration of thought. The Flemish literature owes also much to\r\nanother mystic, Gerard de Groote (†1384), of Deventer, founder of the\r\n“Brethren of Common Life.” The members of that community issued a\r\nlarge number of religious tracts, all of them written in Flemish. They\r\nfounded excellent schools, where instruction was given by teachers\r\nfrom the University of Paris, and they were the first to introduce\r\nthe art of printing into the Netherlands. The most famous printer of\r\nthe Netherlands, Thierry Martens, of Alost, was one of their pupils.\r\nWherever they founded communities and schools they introduced the\r\nart of printing, e.g., in Alost, Bruges, Brussels, Deventer, Gouda,\r\nLouvain, and Utrecht.\r\n\r\nAs for French literature in Belgium during the Burgundian period, its\r\noutput was mainly devoted to the aristocracy, and consisted chiefly\r\nof historical material. The names of the historians Jean le Bel, Jean\r\nFroissart, Monstrelet, and Chastelain are well known. Froissart was a\r\ncosmopolitan writer, and most of the historians of this school showed\r\nonly a dynastic learning. There was no question of patriotism. They\r\npraised the Burgundian dukes because these dukes were their protectors\r\nand benefactors.\r\n\r\nArtistic life, on the other hand, was not divided into two separate\r\ncurrents, as was the literary life. In matters of art, Flemish and\r\nWalloon collaborated during the fifteenth century and together produced\r\na real Belgian art. The masters of this period were the Flemings Jan\r\nand Hubert Van Eyck and the Walloon Roger de la Pasture or Van der\r\nWeyden.\r\n\r\nSince the end of the thirteenth century Belgian art had become\r\ncompletely original. It was the wealth of city life that rendered that\r\nphenomenon possible. The wealth of the burgesses served to found many\r\nart industries. Sculpture, painting, and the goldsmith’s art were\r\nno longer exclusively religious; they became more and more secular.\r\nThe erection of large churches ceased. Painters were busy decorating\r\nguild halls and city halls, banners and tents, and painting for craft\r\nguilds and for dramatic societies. The oldest products of Belgian\r\nart are to be found in sculpture, especially monuments in stone or\r\nyellow copper. The cleverness of technique and the realism of outline\r\ncompel admiration. The artists copied with exactness what they noted\r\nin their surroundings. For the stiff meagerness of the Gothic style\r\nthey substituted a more rounded form, and produced a truer art as a\r\nresult. One of the most famous sculptors of this period was Claus\r\nSluter, native of Zeeland, creator of the celebrated sculptures of\r\nDijon. Those masterpieces, made when Ghiberti and Donatello flourished\r\nin Italy, enable the Netherlands to share with that country the first\r\nplace in art of this period.\r\n\r\nThe painters forsook more slowly than did the sculptors the traditions\r\nof the preceding period, but during the period of the Burgundian\r\ndukes they made rapid strides. The painters are to be found among the\r\nFlemings and the Walloons; they were not influenced by the foreign\r\nschools, and they dwelt in the cities of Flanders and Brabant, where\r\nthe presence of wealthy merchants and the residence of the court\r\nafforded them the opportunities for the exercise of their art. Hubert\r\nVan Eyck, of Limburg, came to Ghent about 1430; his brother Jan settled\r\nin Bruges in 1425; Roger Van der Weyden left Tournai and located in\r\nBrussels in 1435. Other famous names are those of Peter Christus, of\r\nBrabant; Simon Marmion, of Valenciennes; Juste Van Wassenhove, of\r\nGhent; Hugo Van der Goes, of Ghent; Thierry Bouts, of Haerlem; and\r\nthe anonymous “Master of Flémalle.” This is a period in which art and\r\ncraftsmanship meant quite different things; the personality of the\r\npainter was now in free course of development.\r\n\r\nMusic also now began to be recognized as the expression of the genius\r\nof both Belgian races, although musicians were chiefly found among\r\nthe Walloons, whereas the painters were mainly Flemings. The names\r\nof the musicians Jan Ockeghem (1494-96), a Fleming, and Josquin des\r\nPrés (1450), a Walloon, may be mentioned as having substituted the\r\nchoir with many voices for the choir with one voice, and as having\r\nintroduced counterpoint in musical composition. Architecture now came\r\nto be regarded as of less importance than sculpture. Its tendency was\r\nto a profusion of ornaments; the simplicity of lines and the severe\r\nmajesty of the Gothic style of the thirteenth century disappeared.\r\nThe prominence of sculptural decoration was especially noticeable\r\nin the city halls of Brussels and Louvain (1444-48), the latter the\r\nmasterpiece of Mathieu de Layens and one of the richest examples of\r\nsculpture in the fifteenth century. Louvain was fortunate also in\r\npossessing its no less famous university (1425). That seat of learning\r\nwas founded at the request of Duke John IV of Brabant by Pope Martin\r\nV. The faculty of theology was added to the three other faculties\r\n(arts, law, and medicine) by Pope Eugen IV in 1432. During the first\r\nquarter of the sixteenth century the University of Louvain played an\r\nunparalleled part in the intellectual life of Belgium.\r\n\r\nSuch was the splendid achievement of Belgian culture in the times of\r\nthe Burgundian dukes. The untimely death of Charles the Bold on the\r\nbattlefield of Nancy threatened ruin to the marvelous results of their\r\npolicy. The news of his death was scarcely made public when the strong\r\nBurgundian state he dreamed of collapsed. Lorraine, Alsace, and the\r\nneighboring countries regained their independence, Liège threw off the\r\nyoke, and the shrewd Louis XI, notwithstanding the treaties, annexed\r\nthe cities of the Somme and of Picardy to France, conquered Artois, and\r\ntook possession of the duchy of Burgundy and of the Franche-Comté.\r\n\r\nThis was a disastrous beginning for the young daughter of Charles the\r\nBold, Mary of Burgundy. It was necessary that she be married and so\r\nobtain a protector as promptly as possible. The States-General accepted\r\nthe candidacy of Maximilian of Hapsburg, son of the Emperor Frederick\r\nIII of Germany. That marriage laid the foundation for the European\r\nsupremacy of the house of Hapsburg, and gave to Belgium a dynasty which\r\nremained in power until the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nPrior to the marriage of Mary, the States-General had taken advantage\r\nof the disastrous situation in which the young princess found herself,\r\nand wrested from her the so-called “Grand Privilege” (February\r\n11, 1477), whereby the Parliament of Malines was abolished and a\r\n“Grand Council” was established, with limited power and including\r\nrepresentatives of all the Belgian provinces. At the same time,\r\neach principality succeeded in obtaining collective provincial\r\nprivileges. Thus most of the new institutions and rules introduced\r\nby the Burgundian dukes were abolished, and the former privileges of\r\nthe communes were again recognized. After the death of Princess Mary\r\n(1482), the reaction of the communes became even more violent. A son\r\nnamed Philip had been born to Mary and Maximilian; history knows him\r\nas Philip the Fair. The Belgians immediately recognized the infant\r\narchduke, but they continued the fight against his father Maximilian.\r\nAfter a bloody struggle in which both France (assisting Flanders) and\r\nGermany (assisting Maximilian) interfered, victory remained in the\r\nhands of the Hapsburgs (1492).\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the Flemish communes to autocracy and centralization\r\nwas henceforth shattered. Broken and impoverished, they no longer\r\nquestioned the authority of the prince. Philip the Fair and Charles V\r\ncontinued at peace and achieved the work of monarchic centralization\r\ninitiated by the Burgundian dukes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBELGIUM UNDER CHARLES V (1506-55) AND THE BEGINNINGS OF THE HOUSE OF\r\nHAPSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip the Fair was made duke and count of the different Belgian\r\nprincipalities in 1494. Meanwhile the international situation in Europe\r\nhad become dangerous for Spain and the Empire. Charles VIII of France\r\nhad conquered the countries of Milan and Naples. The Hapsburgs and the\r\nKing of Spain, threatened by the common danger, united against the\r\npolicy of France and strengthened the coalition by the marriage of Don\r\nJuan, heir to the Spanish throne, to the daughter of Maximilian of\r\nHapsburg, and the union of the latter’s son, Philip the Fair, with the\r\nSpanish infanta, Jeanne. As all the heirs to the Spanish throne died in\r\na short space of time, Jeanne inherited all the rights, and Philip the\r\nFair, sovereign of the Netherlands, became King of Spain.\r\n\r\nThis event proved of the utmost importance in the history of Belgium.\r\nAlthough regarded as a separate territory, the Netherlands--both\r\nBelgium and Holland--became a mere annex of the Spanish branch of the\r\nHapsburg monarchy. For more than two centuries Belgium was ruled from\r\nMadrid by sovereigns who were first of all kings of Spain.\r\n\r\nThis was not yet, however, the case in the time of Charles V, the great\r\nemperor of the sixteenth century. Archduke Charles, son of Philip the\r\nFair, known as Charles V at the time of his accession as Emperor in\r\n1519, assumed control of the Netherlands in 1515. The latter included\r\nBelgium and Holland, in addition to the county of Artois, and was\r\ncommonly spoken of as the Seventeen Provinces. The following year\r\n(1516) Charles also became King of Spain. His reign was occupied by\r\nprotracted wars with France, constituting a continuous strife with\r\nthe powerful sovereign for the hegemony of Europe. In the course of\r\nthis struggle the Netherlands were continually attacked by Francis\r\nI, the French King, and his allies, the Duke of Gueldre, and the La\r\nMarcks, Lords of Sedan and Bouillon. The advantage was always with\r\nCharles, however, and he was thus enabled to continue the territorial\r\nconcentration of all the provinces of the Netherlands which was begun\r\nby the dukes of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nPeacefully or by force, Charles successively annexed East Friesland,\r\nTournai and Tournaisis, the Overyssel, Groninge and Ommelanden, Gueldre\r\nand Zutphen to his domains. In the ecclesiastical principalities, which\r\nthe Burgundian dukes had never been able to annex but only to control,\r\nCharles succeeded in winning the temporal power in the bishopric of\r\nUtrecht; destroyed Térouanne, the seat of the bishopric of the same\r\nname; erected Cambrai and Cambrésis into a duchy in favor of the\r\nbishop; and purchased part of the principality of Liège, where he built\r\nstrong fortresses.\r\n\r\nAfter these achievements, Charles V could call himself the mightiest\r\nsovereign in Europe. But a very intricate question yet remained to\r\nbe settled, namely, what the political relation of the Netherlands\r\nshould be toward the Empire. The feudal tie between the Empire and the\r\nprovinces, called into existence while Lotharingia was yet a fief, had\r\nnever, theoretically at least, been broken; and at the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century Germany still affected to recognize the union\r\n(the feudal vassalage) of the provinces with the Empire, in order that\r\nthey might be the more easily compelled to share in the heavy financial\r\nburdens of the latter. The Netherlands, on the other hand, maintained\r\nthat the union no longer existed. The question was a difficult one\r\nfor Charles, he being at the same time German Emperor and sovereign\r\nof the Netherlands. It took him twenty-five years of negotiations.\r\nIn 1548, after his victory over the princes of the Protestant League\r\nat Schmalkalden, he settled the question by the celebrated Augsburg\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nBy this provisional arrangement the Empire was divided into “circles.”\r\nThe episcopal duchy of Cambrai, Liège, and the small principality of\r\nStavelot-Malmedy became a part of the so-called circle of Westphalia;\r\nthe Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands and the Franche-Comté\r\nconstituted a new circle, called the “circle of Bourgogne.” These\r\nstates were placed under the armed protection of the Empire, which\r\nundertook to defend them as members of the whole. They were recognized,\r\nhowever, as independent and free states, not subject to the laws of the\r\nEmpire. At the same time, fearing that, through the application of the\r\nvarying rules of succession existing in each Belgian principality, the\r\nunion might some day become imperiled, Charles V, by a special act,\r\nordained that the Netherlands or Seventeen Provinces should forever be\r\nconsidered an indivisible whole, in which the first-born son should be\r\nregarded as the heir to the throne. In case of deficiency of a male\r\nheir, however, the female heir was to be recognized in the succession.\r\nThis was really a constitutional law sanctioned by the States-General,\r\nofficially gathered in solemn meeting in Brussels in 1549. The early\r\nwork of the dukes of Burgundy was now completed and firmly established.\r\n\r\nAnother task of tremendous importance now engaged the attention\r\nof Charles. This was the fight against heresy. The new difficulty\r\npresented an entirely novel problem.\r\n\r\nWhen, by the revolt of Luther against the Roman Catholic church,\r\nProtestantism began rapidly to spread all over Europe, it quickly\r\nfound a follower in the Netherlands, whose location facilitated its\r\nexpansion. In virtue of their historical development, the Netherlands\r\nare an essentially Catholic state. Charles V and Philip II, as\r\nsovereigns of that state, considered themselves the defenders of\r\northodoxy, religious unity, and the union of church and state. In\r\nopposing what they considered to be a political as well as a religious\r\ncrime, they invoked the penal laws and criminal institutions as their\r\nweapons against what they regarded as a revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nThe famous _placarts_, or penal laws, enacted under Charles V to the\r\nnumber of a dozen between 1520 and 1530, were complementary to each\r\nother. They were all the work of the government and were approved by\r\nthe States-General, the prominent members of the military aristocracy,\r\nand the knights of the Golden Fleece. They were preventive and\r\nrepressive at the same time. From a repressive point of view, they\r\ndistinguished between the crime of heresy and the simple offense\r\nagainst the prescriptions of the _placarts_.\r\n\r\nThe crime of heresy could be committed only by a man who had been\r\nbaptized, who from the point of view of the Catholic faith was guilty\r\nof error, and who obstinately persisted in that error after having\r\nbeen warned and enlightened. Obstinacy in error was the main point. If\r\nthere was no obstinacy, but retraction of the error, there was no more\r\ncrime; there remained only a sin. On the other hand, a simple offense\r\nagainst the _placarts_ might be committed by anyone, be he a Catholic,\r\na Jew, or a heretic. Such offenses might be committed, for instance,\r\nby _acts_, such as the circulation of heretic books and pamphlets, by\r\nsheltering meetings of heretics, etc.\r\n\r\nThe crime of heresy was to be judged by an ecclesiastical judge,\r\nthe only one able to discuss those matters. The offense against the\r\n_placarts_ was to be dealt with by a secular judge, a layman. The\r\njurisdiction of the ecclesiastical judge was limited by strict rules.\r\nHe might not impose a penalty prescribed by the _placarts_, or any\r\npenalty involving the shedding of blood. If the heretic remained\r\nobstinate, he was to be expelled from the church and given over to\r\nthe lay judge, who alone might impose the penalty prescribed by the\r\n_placarts_.\r\n\r\nThe latter penalties were simple and drastic: death by fire, by\r\nsword, or by burial alive, and the confiscation of property. The\r\nsystem inaugurated by Charles was anti-judicial and cruel. It was\r\nanti-judicial, inasmuch as the penalties were applied both to heretics\r\nand to simple offenders against the _placarts_, and thus provided\r\nsimilar punishment for offenses whose intrinsic criminality was wholly\r\ndifferent. It must not, however, be forgotten that in the sixteenth\r\ncentury the object of every penal law was to instil terror first of\r\nall, and that those guilty of heresy were considered as seditious\r\npersons, disturbers of the state, and consequently to be punished by\r\nthe severe penalties applicable to acts of _lèse-majesté_.\r\n\r\nSpecial officers were appointed for enforcing the _placarts_. These\r\nwere the so-called “Apostolic Inquisitors” whom Charles V requested\r\nthe Pope to appoint in 1524. They were only ecclesiastical judges,\r\nreceiving their instructions directly from the Holy See. Their mission\r\nconsisted in discovering the heretics, in reconciling them with the\r\nchurch, and in imposing only a canon or ecclesiastical penalty. If\r\nthe heretic remained obstinate, they were obliged to turn him over to\r\nthe lay judge. For the first time, in 1546, they received detailed\r\ninstructions from the Emperor and after that were considered as agents\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\nAnother measure designed to prevent the spread of heresy was the\r\nestablishment of the new dioceses, but as this was undertaken by Philip\r\nII we shall deal with it in another chapter. It remains only to add\r\nthat throughout the reign of Charles V the system of the _placarts_ met\r\nwith no opposition. The Emperor was a Fleming, he was born at Ghent, he\r\nknew his people, and the people accepted from him what they would not\r\naccept from his son Philip some years later.\r\n\r\nOwing to these circumstances, Charles V was able to complete the\r\nwork of the Burgundian dukes in another direction, namely, the\r\nmonarchic centralization of the Belgian provinces. The numerous wars\r\nwaged by him involved expenses, and, under the rights theretofore\r\ngranted the country, he was obliged to obtain the consent of the\r\nStates-General, called together for the purpose, whenever he required\r\nthe financial assistance of his subjects. In granting the subsidies,\r\nthe States-General invariably seized on the occasion for exacting some\r\nprivilege or concession in return. In order to free himself of this\r\nrestraint, the Emperor sought to introduce two innovations, which, in\r\nFrance, had practically destroyed the power of the States-General,\r\nnamely, the permanent impost and the permanent army. To his sister,\r\nMary of Hungary, who in his name governed the Netherlands, he intrusted\r\nthe proposal of a clever scheme. All the provinces of the Netherlands\r\nwere to form a defensive union or confederation, in order to be ready\r\nto repel the attacks from foreign princes. Should a province be\r\nattacked, all the other provinces were immediately to join in assisting\r\nit from a military and financial point of view. Such common action\r\nwould involve the existence of a permanent army and the introduction of\r\na permanent tax.\r\n\r\nWhen the proposal was laid before them, the States-General immediately\r\ndiscovered the trap. Some of them even dared to remark that they\r\ndid not want to be treated _à la mode de France_. The scheme was\r\nunequivocally rejected. The Emperor was obliged to yield. He was far\r\ntoo diplomatic openly and brutally to oppose the privileges of his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nIn 1555 he abdicated and went to pass the rest of his life in the\r\nSpanish monastery of Saint Just. His son, Philip II of Spain, succeeded\r\nhim as sovereign of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPHILIP II AND THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS AGAINST SPANISH RULE\r\n(1555-96)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolt of the Netherlands against Spain is not merely an event of\r\nlocal Belgian history; it belongs to the political history of Europe.\r\nIt is an episode of those long and cruel wars of religion which,\r\nbeginning in Scotland after the constitution of the first Presbyterian\r\nCovenant, set aflame the whole of Western Europe. Of course, the\r\noccasion for the wars differed in each country, but the cause was the\r\nsame in every case and the question which was to be supreme in Europe,\r\nCatholicism or Protestantism, actuated them all. In this tremendous\r\nstruggle all questions were finally reduced to one, and as social\r\ninfluences aligned themselves on one side or the other, the tide turned\r\nin favor of or against the church. Catholics and Protestants supported\r\ntheir brethren in the faith on the other side of the frontiers. Each\r\nside sought a decisive victory; divided influence or co-ordinate\r\nrecognition was acceptable to neither. Timid persons and politicians\r\nseeking to remain neutral were carried away by the current or submerged\r\nby it. Neutrality was impossible; everyone was forced to take part in\r\nthe struggle.\r\n\r\nThe kings of France, lacking principles and decision, found their\r\nown forces divided and were unable to carry out a real international\r\npolicy. On the other hand, Elizabeth, Queen of England, resolutely\r\nranged herself on the side of international Protestantism, assisting\r\nand often directing its attacks. Against her, Philip II of Spain,\r\nconsidering himself as the absolute defender of Catholicism in Europe,\r\nset his nationality and his faith. Lacking decision in political\r\nmatters, he showed no indecision in matters of faith. Against him arose\r\nthe league of Protestants throughout Europe. They realized that, if\r\nhe was defeated and his country crushed, the church would be defeated\r\nthroughout the world. The Protestants therefore concentrated their\r\nattack on him in the Netherlands. The geographical position of the\r\nlatter made interference with England, France, and Germany especially\r\nfeasible; but they were at the same time the weakest spots in Philip’s\r\ndominions. Revolt blazed within their borders--such revolt as might\r\nresult in bringing his power to an end. This Philip realized full well,\r\nand determined to go to any limit in order to keep the Netherlands.\r\nNothing was left undone which would serve to suppress every attempt at\r\nrevolt. This object it was which dictated his unhappy policy in the\r\nNetherlands, a policy that resulted in the loss of the northern part,\r\nand ultimately in the founding of the separate state of the United\r\nProvinces (Holland).\r\n\r\nThe true meaning of the wars of religion in the Netherlands cannot be\r\nproperly understood without taking these considerations into account.\r\nIt will also be useful to consider the characters of those prominently\r\ninvolved in the tragedy, before narrating the details of the tragedy\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nPhilip II, King of Spain and sovereign of the Netherlands, was\r\nabove all a Spaniard. Educated in Spain, he found himself unable to\r\nunderstand the Belgians as his father had. He did not appreciate\r\ntheir pride, their deep love of liberty, and their respect for the\r\nprivileges granted them. An autocratic king, he was haughty as only a\r\nSpaniard can be. Deeply convinced of the superiority of Catholicism,\r\nand possessing principles absolutely rigid in character, he was\r\nincapable of compromise--in short, a real bigot. In political affairs\r\nhe endeavored to arrange every detail himself, and personally to read\r\npiles of dispatches by the light of a candle in his dark room in the\r\nEscurial. He labored day and night, constantly immersed in thought, and\r\nwas remarkably slow in reaching a decision. When, however, his mind\r\nwas finally made up, it was usually too late. Events had progressed\r\nin the meantime and when his orders reached the theater of war they\r\ncould not be carried out, since the situation had entirely changed.\r\nThat slowness of decision brought him many disasters. Nevertheless, he\r\nwas an excellent father to his children, and there are extant letters\r\nwritten by him to his daughters, in which it is difficult to recognize\r\nthe lonely thinker of the Escurial.\r\n\r\nHe paid a short visit to his subjects in the Netherlands at the\r\nbeginning of his reign (1557), but left no sympathetic impression\r\nbehind. His sister, Duchess Margareta of Parma, remained in the country\r\nto govern the people during his absence. He was absent to the end.\r\nHis Flemish subjects never saw him again. From Madrid he directed the\r\naffairs of the Belgians, and studied the dispatches which reached him\r\nevery week.\r\n\r\nMargareta, offspring of the amour of Emperor Charles V with the\r\ndaughter of a Flemish upholsterer from Audenaerde, had been educated\r\nfor a time in Brussels and had then gone to Italy, where she\r\nsuccessively married Alessandro de’ Medici and Ottavio Farnese,\r\nthe latter being Duke of Parma and Piacenza. Although of masculine\r\ncharacter, loving sport and exercises, Margareta possessed the feminine\r\ncharacteristics of vanity and shrewdness. She had acquired in Italy a\r\ndisposition to engage in _combinazione_, and succeeded in playing the\r\ngame often under very difficult circumstances. Philip of Spain left\r\nher as an assistant in her political councils a man of real diplomacy,\r\nCardinal de Granvelle.\r\n\r\nAntoine Perrenot de Granvelle, Burgundian in origin, was a loyal\r\nservant of his master. He was the man of the _raison d’état_. Philip\r\nII never had a more faithful minister. Granvelle desired only the\r\nwelfare of the King and of the state he represented, and was heroic\r\nenough to assume the responsibility for the drastic measures taken by\r\nhis sovereign. He was a man of real political genius, clear-sighted,\r\nabsolutely unselfish. The main object of his political plans was that\r\nSpain should rule the seas, and it was he who urged Philip II to send\r\nthe famous Armada against England.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip II began his reign in the Netherlands, the financial\r\nsituation of the government was distressing. Charles V had left heavy\r\ndebts created by his numerous wars. Public opinion was defiant,\r\ninfluenced as it was by ill will for the unsympathetic King and by the\r\nbaseless fear that the scheme of erecting new dioceses would be the\r\nprecursor of the terrible Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of erecting new dioceses had been conceived by the King\r\nin 1559, in order to counteract more strongly the propaganda of\r\nProtestantism. The existing mediaeval dioceses were too large to\r\nenable the bishops to carry out their mission as guardians of the\r\nfaith. It was necessary, therefore, that the old dioceses be broken\r\nup and divided into smaller ones, so that the bishops would have more\r\nopportunity for action in smaller areas. The Pope consented, and\r\npermitted the erection of thirteen new dioceses. From an ecclesiastical\r\npoint of view the country was now divided as follows: the archbishopric\r\nof Malines, with the suffragan dioceses, Antwerp, Bois-le-Duc, Ghent,\r\nYpres, Bruges, Ruremonde; the archbishopric of Cambrai, with the\r\nsuffragans, Arras, Tournai, Namur, Saint-Omer; the archbishopric\r\nof Utrecht, with the suffragans, Haerlem, Deventer, Leeuwarden,\r\nMiddelburg, Groninge. The scheme stirred up violent opposition among\r\nthe Belgian nobles, the abbots, some of the bishops, and even among the\r\ncommon people. The nobles feared the loss of their political influence\r\nthrough the admission of so many bishops into the States-General, where\r\nthey would occupy leading positions. Many of the abbots were resentful\r\nbecause their monasteries would be compelled to contribute to the new\r\nbishops a part of their income, in support of the new dioceses. Some\r\nof the bishops were angered over the division of their former dioceses\r\nand the reduction of their spiritual power. The people, influenced by\r\npolitical agents and Protestant propagandists, were led to believe\r\nthat each new bishop would simply be a representative of the Spanish\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\nThe movement of opposition would have been easily repressed by the\r\nBelgian nobles had they really been faithful to the King. But, on\r\nthe whole, they were not. They had the same feelings as the French\r\naristocracy at this time. They were horrified at the idea of the\r\nsupremacy of the sovereign power. Although not possessing any definite\r\naim, they tried to dominate the Prince and the state by means of the\r\npolitical power they themselves controlled. They were members of\r\nthe Council of State, governors of the different Belgian provinces,\r\ncaptains in the national army, the famous _bandes d’ordonnance_, and\r\nthey exercised a tremendous influence on all classes. The political\r\ndifficulties encountered by the government were for them but favorable\r\nopportunities of which to take advantage. The King himself afforded\r\nthem a chance. With characteristic disregard for the national\r\nprivileges, he established at Brussels a council called the _Consulta_,\r\nan institution of true Spanish type. Composed of a few individuals,\r\nit was dominated by the influence of Cardinal de Granvelle, and\r\nundertook to decide the most important questions of national policy.\r\nThe _Consulta_ stirred up an opposition of formidable character,\r\nguided by the most influential Belgian nobles, the Prince of Orange\r\nand the counts of Egmont and Horn. Cardinal de Granvelle became the\r\nvictim of the most violent attacks. Margareta of Parma first sought\r\nto defend him, but, little by little, influenced by the nobles, she\r\nfinally ranged herself on their side and herself requested the King to\r\nrecall the unsympathetic minister. Partly through weariness, partly\r\nthrough political miscalculation, Philip II yielded. Granvelle left the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nThis was a triumph for the opposition. Margareta, who had been moved\r\nby jealousy of Granvelle and who had hoped to add materially to her\r\npower after his departure, fell more and more under the control of the\r\nnobles, who flattered her and took advantage of her feminine vanity. A\r\nreign of anarchy and favoritism followed, the friends of the nobles\r\nbeing furnished with offices and perquisites. The political opponents\r\nof the King now tried to consolidate and to perpetuate their success.\r\nThey asked that all affairs be subject to the control of the Council\r\nof State, the real national body of which they themselves were the\r\nmasters; that he should convoke the States-General, and that he should\r\ntemper the _placarts_ against the heretics and abolish the power of\r\nthe Inquisitors. The granting of the first of these demands would have\r\nmade the nobles all-powerful in political affairs. From the second\r\nmeasure--the meeting of the States-General--they expected ratification\r\nof their conduct and popular support of the opposition they had\r\ninaugurated. In dealing with the question of the _placarts_, they\r\nplayed a sort of religious policy calculated to bring them the support\r\nof the Lutherans and the Calvinists.\r\n\r\nPhilip II rejected their demands. Astonished by this resistance,\r\nwhich they did not expect after the capitulation of the King on the\r\nquestion of Granvelle, some of the Belgian nobles, and especially the\r\nPrince of Orange, succeeded in embroiling the Protestant sectarians\r\nin the struggle. The Calvinists, more warlike than the Lutherans,\r\nwere more than ready to join the movement, owing to their hatred of\r\nthe Catholic King of Spain. But, once begun, the movement became an\r\nirresistible one. Stirred up by their preachers and assisted by the\r\nworst elements of the populace, the Calvinists invaded the churches,\r\nsmashed the statues of the saints, carried away the treasures, attacked\r\nthe convents, and killed monks and priests (1566). The Belgian nobles,\r\nsurprised by the revolt they had so imprudently initiated, were unable\r\nto stop it; rather they were submerged by the current. From this time\r\nonward the political anti-Spanish movement became a part of the general\r\nmovement of the wars of religion. Many Catholics foresaw what would\r\nhappen and deserted the cause, separating themselves from a revolt that\r\nwas being directed as much against the church as against Spanish rule.\r\n\r\nFrom the revolt of 1566 and the outrages of the sectarians resulted the\r\nlater policy of Philip II toward the Netherlands. Hitherto he had but\r\nfollowed the traditional policy of his father, Emperor Charles. He had\r\nshowed respect for political institutions; he had avoided any cause\r\nof rupture. He had tried, of course unwillingly and unskilfully, to\r\nsatisfy public opinion. His patience brought him nothing but a serious\r\ncheck. He had recalled, in 1561, the Spanish garrisons which had been\r\nquartered in Belgium during the war with France; he had sacrificed his\r\nloyal minister Granvelle and had capitulated to the nobles. But the\r\nmore he showed himself to be conciliatory the more audacious became the\r\nopposition. This was at first purely political and aimed only at the\r\nreconstruction of the Burgundian state as against the Spanish state;\r\nlater, it had dared to claim liberty of conscience, an unheard-of thing\r\nat this period; finally, it had favored the Calvinistic agitation and\r\nhad caused the desecration of convents and churches.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this outrage reached the King, he angrily exclaimed:\r\n“By the soul of my father, for these crimes they shall pay a heavy\r\nprice.” In the eyes of Philip II, official protector of Catholicism,\r\nboth the royal and the divine majesty had been insulted, and the claim\r\nfor autonomy had but aggravated the triumph of heresy. His rebellious\r\nsubjects were to be chastised. He would impose political absolutism\r\nupon them as well as the religious control that prevailed in Spain.\r\nThe iron rule he intended to introduce would preserve for the church\r\nand for himself those countries which were the cornerstones of his\r\nworld-power.\r\n\r\nFrom now on we may speak of the “Spanish rule.” The traditionally lax\r\npolicy of Emperor Charles was gone. The tyranny of Spain was destined\r\nto crush the Belgians. That task was intrusted to the Duke of Alva, who\r\ncame to Belgium as governor in 1567. Don Luis Alvarez de Toledo, Duke\r\nof Alva and Marquess of Soria, was a cold and implacable warrior. The\r\ngreatness of his king was for him the greatness of Spain. He hated the\r\nBelgians, who had dared to ask for liberty of conscience, as much as he\r\nhated the heretics. He accomplished his terrible mission unwaveringly\r\nand remorselessly; his method of government was terror. Accustomed to\r\nfight the Moslem Moors of Spain, he knew only two weapons with which\r\nto crush the heretics--the sword and the stake. He wrote in one of his\r\nletters: “It is infinitely better to keep, by means of war, for God and\r\nfor the King, an impoverished and even ruined country, than to keep it,\r\nwithout war, undamaged, for the devil and his partisans, the heretics.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the terrible warrior to whom Philip II intrusted a double\r\ntask: to chastise the rebels and heretics and to subject the nation\r\nto the rule of Madrid. Alva arrived in Belgium with a large number\r\nof the best Spanish troops. Contrary to all customs in the free\r\nNetherlands, they were billeted in the cities. A fortress was ordered\r\nbuilt at Antwerp. The counts of Egmont and Horn and the burgomaster\r\nof Antwerp were treacherously arrested and imprisoned. But the real\r\nleader of the opposition, the Prince of Orange, could not be taken.\r\nMore clear-sighted than his friends, he had fled to Holland before\r\nthe coming vengeance. In defiance of all national privileges, Alva\r\nestablished an extraordinary tribunal, which the people soon called the\r\n“Council of Blood”; that court of justice, established and conducted\r\nin a thoroughly revolutionary manner, condemned scores of people\r\nwho were more or less guilty of revolt against the King. About two\r\nthousand victims were sentenced to death and executed. Only political\r\ncrimes were taken into account, and the condemnation was followed by\r\nthe confiscation of property--a remarkably remunerative operation for\r\nthe Spanish treasure chest. Terror fell upon the Belgians. All who\r\nhad engaged in the slightest degree in the revolt of 1566 fled to\r\nforeign countries; Lutherans and Calvinists, panic-stricken, left the\r\nNetherlands in large numbers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Prince of Orange had sought for help among the German\r\nProtestant princes; he gathered an army and invaded Belgium. He had\r\nexpected a general revolt of the people against Alva at the first news\r\nof his campaign. But the soldiers of his army, merely hirelings, and\r\nmany of them fanatical Protestants, pillaged churches and convents on\r\ntheir way; they disgusted the naturally religious populace of Belgium,\r\nand the campaign of William the Silent proved a complete failure. The\r\nprince was compelled to seek refuge in France, where he hoped to get\r\nhelp from Coligny and the French Huguenots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTWERP The oldest part of the city, the Scheldt, and\r\nthe Town Hall]\r\n\r\nBy way of reply to this misadventure of William the Silent came\r\nthe execution of the counts of Egmont and Horn. The “Council of\r\nBlood” charged them with high treason and ordered them to be put to\r\ndeath, on the Place du Sablon, in the heart of Brussels. Their death\r\nstupefied the people and disheartened the nationalists. Both counts\r\nfell victims to the hatred of the terrible duke, for they were guilty\r\nonly of weakness and imprudence--they never really were traitors to\r\ntheir sovereign. The Belgians always regarded them as martyrs for\r\ntheir country. Alva now proceeded to introduce into the Netherlands\r\nthe features of the Spanish régime, while his condemnations continued.\r\nFor the first time since 1561 the new bishops were able to occupy\r\ntheir bishoprics, the Catholic faith was everywhere re-established,\r\nthe University of Louvain was visited in order to determine whether\r\nit was sufficiently orthodox, the Council of State was no more called\r\ntogether or given over to Spaniards. In order to secure supplies and\r\nmoney for his administration and to crush the country economically,\r\nAlva introduced unheard-of taxes, called the _centième, vingtième, et\r\ndixième denier_. This meant a permanent impost, which the Belgians\r\nhad always stoutly resisted. A revolt broke out all over the country.\r\nWhat the appeals of William the Silent did not effect, the attack upon\r\nthe people’s privileges and wealth did. The Prince of Orange cleverly\r\ntook advantage of it, and, needing the help of the heretics to fight\r\nthe enemy, gave the direction of the movement into the hands of the\r\nCalvinists. Meanwhile a storm of recrimination and complaints, among\r\nwhich the protests of the bishops and of the University of Louvain were\r\nnot the weakest, reached Philip II. The King understood that he had\r\ngone to work the wrong way, and that the policy of terrorism had not\r\nbrought him any real success. He changed his mind and recalled Alva.\r\nThe terrible duke left Belgium pursued by the maledictions of the whole\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Don Luis de Requesens, was a better man. The change in\r\nthe King’s attitude was immediately revealed by the measures taken\r\nby the new governor. Requesens abolished the “Council of Blood,”\r\nproclaimed a general amnesty, and opened negotiations at Breda with\r\nthe rebellious provinces. These negotiations failed, however, and\r\nthe struggle continued on both sides with alternating successes and\r\nreverses. Requesens died suddenly in 1575, at a moment when the\r\ngovernment was facing an appalling financial crisis. The Council of\r\nState immediately took over the regency, till the King should send a\r\nnew governor.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange, however, had decided that there should be no\r\npeace and that the revolutionary movement should be agitated as much\r\nas possible. He had completely gained the confidence of Holland and\r\nZeeland, where he was the real master, and he planned to extend his\r\ncontrol over the rest of the Seventeen Provinces. Deeply compromised\r\nas he was, any agreement with the King would mean disaster and the end\r\nof his plans, which aimed at the separation of the Belgian provinces\r\nfrom the Spanish monarchy. Owing to personal circumstances he had\r\nfirst endeavored to resist Philip II by legal means. During his\r\nexile and under the government of Alva he had gone farther and had\r\nplanned a general revolt, and now that the milder attitude of the King\r\nthreatened to win back some sympathy in Belgium, especially among the\r\nCatholics, he foresaw that only the most daring policy would save the\r\nrevolutionary movement. Agents were therefore sent to the southern\r\nprovinces to stir up the people against any attempt at conciliation.\r\nAs a result of their intrigues, the members of the Council of State\r\nwere arrested by a furious mob and imprisoned. By the time they were\r\nliberated they had fallen completely under the influence of the\r\nrevolutionary leaders. The States-General were called together by the\r\nfriendly members of the Council of State, and for nine years exercised\r\nthe chief power in Belgium. It was during their government, which\r\nproved on the whole to be Catholic and loyalist, that the Spanish\r\nsoldiers, deprived of their pay, arose and sacked the city of Antwerp,\r\nkilling nearly seven thousand people. This event is known as the\r\n“Spanish Fury.”\r\n\r\nThis, of course, gave the anti-Spanish party an excellent chance.\r\nUnder the pressure of William the Silent, the States-General met at\r\nGhent in 1575, and out of their deliberations was born the famous\r\n“Pacification of Ghent.” This act was the work of the Prince of Orange,\r\nand was intended to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to settle\r\ntheir religious differences, in order that they might be united in\r\nthe political struggle against Spain. This attempt at establishing\r\na “peace of religion” was unfortunately premature and provisional.\r\nThe hostilities between Catholics and Protestants were suspended and\r\nreligious tolerance was proclaimed; but in Holland and Zeeland, the\r\npolitical sphere of influence of the Prince of Orange, the Catholic\r\nworship was provisionally forbidden. The States-General would, it\r\nwas promised, later on reconsider the whole problem and settle the\r\nreligious differences definitely. This agreement was, of course,\r\nunfavorable to the Catholics, but union was temporarily restored.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Don Juan, the new Spanish governor, had been appointed by\r\nPhilip II and had arrived in Belgium. Don Juan was the son of Charles\r\nV, and the celebrated victor over the Turks in the naval battle of\r\nLepanto (1571). He had no sympathy for the Belgians and did not like\r\nthe task which was intrusted to him. He attempted, of course, though\r\nagainst his convictions, to negotiate with the rebels, but failed. As\r\nwe have seen, the Prince of Orange had determined that there should\r\nbe no peace until his plans had been carried out. By surprising and\r\noccupying the fortress of Namur, contrary to the conventions but in\r\norder to obtain a stronghold for his protection, Don Juan played, as a\r\nmatter of fact, into the hands of his enemies. Under the influence of\r\nWilliam the Silent the States-General declared the governor a traitor\r\nto the country, and called upon Archduke Mathias, brother of Emperor\r\nRodolphe, to be their new governor. Mathias became practically an\r\ninstrument in the hands of the Prince of Orange, who was appointed as\r\nhis lieutenant-general.\r\n\r\nNow followed a period of anarchy and misrule. Germany, England, and\r\nFrance sent into Belgium a host of sectarians and adventurers; these\r\naided the Calvinists in taking Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent. Ghent\r\nbecame the center of a Calvinistic republic, where the leaders ruled\r\nby terror and began a rigorous persecution of the Catholics. It was\r\nnow quite clear that the Protestants had gained the upper hand in the\r\nstruggle and that the national revolt had turned into a war against\r\nCatholicism. In the midst of these troubles, Don Juan of Austria died\r\nat Bouges, near Namur (1578).\r\n\r\nAt this very moment, events of great importance took place. The Prince\r\nof Orange, contrary to the provisions of the Pacification of Ghent,\r\nhad again endeavored to introduce a new “peace of religion,” which\r\nhad for its object the introduction of Protestantism into the Belgian\r\nprovinces other than Holland and Zeeland. The Protestant ministers\r\nrejected his proposal. What they wanted was not co-ordinate recognition\r\nof Catholicism and Protestantism, but the complete supremacy of their\r\nown religion. Seeing that his attempts brought about only discontent\r\nof both parties, Catholics and Protestants, William the Silent finally\r\ndeclared himself openly as a Calvinist (1578). His rupture with the\r\nCatholics was now complete.\r\n\r\nThis induced the southern provinces, where Catholicism was still in\r\ncontrol, to withdraw their support and to reconcile themselves with\r\nthe Spanish King. The sole motive of this decision was a religious\r\none. There could be no talk of hostility between the Walloons of the\r\nsouth and the Flemings of the north. This was not a question of racial\r\nor linguistic difference. The people of Artois, Hainaut, and French\r\nFlanders were disgusted at the excesses committed by the Calvinists\r\nof Ghent and the position taken by William the Silent in religious\r\nmatters. The Catholic spirit of Belgium, imposed on the country ever\r\nsince the Middle Ages, weighed more strongly in their minds than their\r\nnational hostility to the Spanish rule. Moreover, two other provinces\r\nwhich joined them--Namur and Luxemburg--had never taken part in the\r\nrevolt. As we have seen, the province of Brabant, more independent\r\nthan any other, and, since the fourteenth century, determined in its\r\nopposition to foreign interference, had taken the real leadership in\r\nthe struggle against Spain.\r\n\r\nThe movement in the south in favor of a reconciliation with Philip II\r\nwas an essentially popular movement. The nobles of Artois and Hainaut\r\nstill wavered in their sympathies.[14] The clever policy of the new\r\ngovernor, Alexander Farnese, who succeeded Don Juan of Austria after\r\nthe death of the latter (1578), overcame their last hesitation.[15]\r\n\r\nAlexander Farnese was the son of Margareta of Parma, who had formerly\r\ngoverned the Netherlands. He was of a sympathetic nature, loyal,\r\nhonest, but firm. He was one of the greatest warriors of his age, but\r\nat the same time, being an Italian prince, he distinguished himself as\r\na very shrewd diplomat. At last Philip II had found the right man to\r\ngovern the Netherlands. Alexander Farnese, highly approved by Cardinal\r\nde Granvelle--who at this time resided in Madrid--inaugurated a policy\r\nof mildness and conciliation that produced the happiest results. He\r\ninduced the nobles of the southern provinces, and especially the\r\nCount of Lalaing, to abandon their scruples and to return to the\r\nservice of the King. Both clever diplomacy and gifts and promises of\r\nlarge sums of money played a part in these achievements. From these\r\nnegotiations resulted the Treaty of Arras (1579), concluded between\r\nthe representatives of Artois, Hainaut, Luxemburg, Namur, and French\r\nFlanders and the new governor, as a consequence of which the southern\r\nprovinces returned to the allegiance of Philip II. A concession made\r\nby Farnese was that the foreign troops, which had for so many years\r\npillaged and ruined the country, should leave Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Arras resulted in the reconquest, without bloodshed, of\r\nthe southern part of Belgium; it provoked a rupture between Catholics\r\nand Protestants, the separation of the Walloons and the Flemings,\r\nand crushed the plans of the Prince of Orange. Henceforth it would\r\nbe no longer possible to unite the whole of Belgium against Spanish\r\nrule. William the Silent replied to the Treaty of Arras by the\r\nso-called Union of Utrecht (1579), whereby the northern provinces of\r\nthe Netherlands united themselves in the common struggle and decided\r\nto carry on the revolt to ultimate victory. Slowly, but surely, the\r\nsecession of Belgium from Holland was in progress.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange, infuriated by the blow inflicted on his policy,\r\nnow proclaimed the forfeiture by Philip II of the sovereignty of the\r\nNetherlands and offered the crown to the Duke of Anjou, brother of the\r\nFrench King Henry III (1584). He himself received the title of governor\r\nof Holland and Zeeland and remained the real leader of the union.\r\nPhilip II replied by declaring the Prince an outlaw and putting a price\r\non his head. Such an appeal to murder was common in the sixteenth\r\ncentury and was even supported by the teaching of many theorists;\r\ntoday it seems cruel and opposed to every principle of civilization.\r\nA man fanatical enough to fulfil the desire of the Spanish King was\r\nsoon found. Balthazar Gérard treacherously assassinated the Prince of\r\nOrange at Delft, in 1584. So died the leader of the revolt of the\r\nNetherlands against Spain. He did not succeed in uniting the whole of\r\nBelgium against Philip II, but he initiated the United Provinces of\r\nHolland. The Dutch are right, therefore, in calling him the “Father of\r\nthe Fatherland.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, supported by the Catholic provinces, Alexander Farnese had\r\nsuccessively reconquered all the Belgian cities and won an imperishable\r\nfame by the siege and conquest of Antwerp. Only Ostend resisted and\r\ncould not be taken. It seemed now to be the turn of the north, and\r\nalready the United Provinces were threatened with invasion, when the\r\nunwise policy of Philip II suddenly stopped the advance. The lonely\r\nautocrat of the Escurial had planned the invasion of England and the\r\nconquest of the throne of France, where Henry IV, a Protestant but the\r\nlegitimate heir, was at war with the Catholic League. To these plans\r\nhe sacrificed all the resources of Spain from 1587 to 1592 and forced\r\nFarnese to suspend his campaign in Flanders, to assist in the transport\r\nof troops for the invasion of England, and to aid with his army the\r\nLeague in France. Both enterprises failed utterly, the invasion of\r\nEngland by the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the conquest of the French\r\nthrone by the final rally of the country to the support of Henry IV.\r\n\r\nThe obstinacy of Philip II caused the loss of the northern part of the\r\nNetherlands, which Farnese would probably have conquered. Alexander\r\nFarnese died in 1592 and at his death the Spanish King lost the best\r\ngovernor he had ever had in Belgium. The last years of the sixteenth\r\ncentury were unhappy years for the country. The long and bloody\r\nstruggle had utterly ruined the land. The population had been reduced\r\nby at least 50 per cent; churches and civic buildings had been burned\r\nor severely damaged; trade and industry were in large part gone;\r\nAntwerp had lost its commerce, and thousands of people engaged in\r\ntrade had fled to England, Germany, or Holland. Artistic and literary\r\nactivity had come to a complete standstill; and the scientific center\r\nof Belgium, the University of Louvain, barely escaped complete ruin.\r\n\r\nBut Belgium remained Catholic and subject to the Spanish branch of the\r\nHapsburgs, while the United Provinces (of Holland), overwhelmingly\r\nProtestant, had in fact become an independent country. Henceforth\r\nBelgium and Holland went each its own way, and their history no longer\r\nrecords common interests, at least until the period of the United\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands (1814).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF THE ARCHDUKE ALBERT AND ISABELLA (1598-1633)\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, convinced after a long and painful experience that peace was\r\nto be restored to Belgium only by new means and other methods than\r\nthose heretofore employed, and that by waging war he would not be able\r\nto win back the northern provinces, Philip II tried another plan. He\r\nthought that by giving national sovereigns to the Catholic provinces\r\nhe might induce the Protestants of Holland to return to their former\r\nallegiance and thus restore the lost unity of the Netherlands. In 1598\r\nhe decided, shortly before his death, that the Netherlands should be\r\nerected into an independent state, whose crown he gave to his daughter\r\nIsabella, after she had married Archduke Albert of Austria. If she and\r\nher consort should have no children, the Belgian provinces were to\r\nreturn to Spain. This was an important decision, although nobody in\r\nEurope believed in the real independence of Belgium. The country was\r\npractically under Spanish influence. But autonomy, at least, existed.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the satisfaction felt by the Belgians was at first\r\nmingled with some disappointment. As Albert and Isabella were obliged,\r\nas sovereigns of “the Netherlands,” to continue the war against the\r\nnorthern provinces in order to unite them with those in the south\r\nalready under their power, the Belgians feared that they would be\r\ncharged with the heavy burden of war, and this time without the aid\r\nof the Spanish finances and of the Spanish army. But Philip II had\r\nforeseen the difficulty. He sent the famous general Spinola to their\r\nassistance, with an army of excellent Spanish troops.\r\n\r\nAt first Archduke Albert initiated negotiations with the United\r\nProvinces, but his proposals were received with contempt. He was\r\nforced to make war. A bloody battle was fought at Nieuport, where the\r\nArchduke courageously led his troops against the Dutch under Maurice\r\nof Nassau. Although not victorious, Albert decided to besiege Ostend,\r\nthe only Belgian city left in the hands of the rebels. The siege of\r\nOstend lasted three years, from 1601 to 1604. On both sides deeds of\r\nheroism were numerous. Three rings of fortifications had to be taken\r\nand every trench was stormed at the cost of many lives. At length\r\nOstend, continuously battered by artillery, could no longer resist the\r\nenergetic assaults of the soldiers of Spinola. It surrendered, but only\r\nits ruins were left in the hands of the victor.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Ostend, the Archduke, wishing to put an end to this\r\nwar of exhaustion, again opened negotiations with the United Provinces,\r\nand succeeded in concluding a truce for twelve years (1609-21). During\r\nthat time Albert and Isabella did their best to heal the wounds of\r\ntheir people. Their reign was one of peace and of reconstruction.\r\nThe sovereign power was even stronger than before the crisis of the\r\nsixteenth century. No revolt troubled the happy years of the Archduke’s\r\nrule. National institutions were not disturbed, the re-establishment\r\nof order was attempted by law rather than by force. In 1611 a meeting\r\nof magistrates and lawyers was called in order to codify the judicial\r\nprovisions and to inaugurate a reform of civil and criminal law. The\r\nfruit of that attempt was the _Édit perpétuel_, a judicial monument of\r\ngreat importance. At the same time the old customs, the unwritten law\r\nof the Belgian principalities and cities, were reduced to writing and\r\npublished in definite form by order of the sovereign.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the respect they manifested for the customs of the\r\ncountry, Albert and Isabella showed the utmost interest in the\r\nrestoration of every kind of social activity. Zealous for the welfare\r\nof Catholicism, they undertook to restore the religious life of the\r\ncountry. Three hundred churches and convents were rebuilt or founded.\r\nThe religious orders of the Jesuits, the Carmelites, etc., found in\r\nthe sovereigns hearty and generous protectors. The lost treasures\r\nof the churches had to be replaced, and the restoration of worship\r\nbrought about the revival of the goldsmith’s art and of painting. The\r\nFlemish school of painting again became as famous as in the time of\r\nthe Burgundian dukes. The head of this school was Peter Paul Rubens;\r\nand among his pupils he counted artists like Van Dyck, Teniers,\r\nand Jordaens. Public education was encouraged and many colleges\r\nand academies were opened for the teaching of Greek and Latin. The\r\nUniversity of Louvain was accorded special protection. In 1607 Drusius,\r\nabbot of the abbey of Parc, near Louvain, and Van Craesbeke, councilor\r\nof Brabant, were appointed to inspect the University. Another delegate,\r\nthe Nuncio Caraffa, was sent by the Pope. The system of “visitation,”\r\nas it was called, lasted, with interruptions, till 1617, when a\r\ncomplete scheme of regulations was enacted. The jurisdiction of the\r\nacademic authorities, the privileges of the University, the interests\r\nof teaching and of the various colleges, the rights and duties of\r\nprofessors, the granting of degrees, the discipline and conduct of the\r\nstudents--everything was carefully dealt with. The visitation of 1617\r\nestablished the authority of the University of Louvain and gave it a\r\nlegal status.\r\n\r\nThe excellent results of the new rules were immediately apparent.\r\nAt this time seven or eight thousand students, among them Dutchmen,\r\nFrisians, Flemings, Germans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, and Italians, were\r\nin attendance at the University. The faculty of law became especially\r\nnotable, and professors such as Peckius, Coursèle, Tulden, Perez, and\r\nGudelin were regarded as eminent authorities. In letters the humanists\r\nJustus Lipsius and Erycius Puteanus, Valerius Andreas and Nicholas\r\nVernuleus were famous. Albert and Isabella showed clearly their lively\r\ninterest in the institution by attending one of the lectures of Justus\r\nLipsius.\r\n\r\nAlthough artistic, literary, and scientific interests flourished\r\nduring the reign of Albert and Isabella, the trade and industry of\r\nBelgium enjoyed no such revival. Antwerp was closed and had no access\r\nto the sea, as the Dutch blocked the Scheldt, and all commerce with\r\nthe colonies of the New World was forbidden to the people of Belgium\r\nby Spain. Moreover, the peace and safety necessary to the development\r\nof trade were continually threatened by France in the south and by the\r\nUnited Provinces in the north.\r\n\r\nThe private life of Albert and Isabelle was modest and simple. Their\r\ncourt at Brussels was an example of morality and seriousness, although\r\nthey were not given over to bigotry. Isabella was a cheerful princess;\r\nshe liked to mingle sometimes with the people and to take part in\r\ntheir rejoicings and their sports. Both sovereigns were very popular.\r\n\r\nSorrow filled the souls of the Belgians when the Archduke died in\r\n1621, without issue. According to the testament of Philip II, Belgium\r\nwas held obliged to return to Spanish rule. Indeed, Spain immediately\r\ntook possession of the country and, although Isabella remained at\r\nBrussels, she was no longer a sovereign, but a simple regent in the\r\nname of the King. When she died in 1633, the universal mourning in town\r\nand country proved how well she had succeeded in winning the sympathy\r\nof the Belgians.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LAST YEARS OF THE SPANISH RULE (1633-1715)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last eighty years of the seventeenth century were an unhappy\r\nperiod for Belgium. France, under Richelieu and Louis XIV, continually\r\nattacked the declining Spanish monarchy, and sought to wrest from it\r\nthe Belgian provinces piece by piece. From 1622 to 1648 France was\r\nassisted in this policy of conquest by the United Provinces of Holland.\r\nEach treaty of this period marks a territorial diminution of Belgium\r\nand sometimes likewise a decisive blow at the elements of its material\r\nprosperity. The Treaty of Munster, concluded in 1648 between Spain\r\nand the United Provinces, remorselessly sacrificed the commercial\r\ninterests of Belgium. According to this treaty it was agreed that the\r\nDutch should have the right to control and to close the Scheldt, the\r\nvery source of Antwerp’s wealth. It was also agreed that henceforth the\r\nUnited Provinces should definitely retain their independence, won by\r\nWilliam the Silent and his sons, should even remain in possession of\r\nNorthern Brabant and Northern Flanders, and should divide with Belgium\r\nthe sovereignty over Maestricht.\r\n\r\nThe act which established the final separation between Belgium and\r\nHolland constituted also the first act of hostility of the latter. As a\r\nconsequence of the Treaty of Munster, Limburg was divided between both\r\ncountries in 1661. The Dutch obtained the larger part of the country of\r\nFauquemont and Daelhem and a portion of Rolduc.\r\n\r\nOther territorial losses were forced upon Belgium some years later.\r\nIn 1659, France acquired nearly all the country of Artois, by the\r\nTreaty of the Pyrennees; in 1668, French Flanders and Tournaisis, by\r\nthe Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; in 1678, Franche-Comté, Cambrai and\r\nCambrésis, and the rest of Artois, by the Treaty of Nimègue. On the\r\nwhole, the defeats suffered by the Spanish monarchy at the period\r\nof its decline cost Belgium, hopelessly attached to the dying body,\r\nthe north of Flanders, and the south of Flanders, of Hainaut, and of\r\nLuxemburg.\r\n\r\nEach treaty terminated a war; and from the numerous negotiations\r\nalready mentioned it is not difficult to realize how many wars Belgium\r\nwas forced to endure on her own soil. Dutch, French, English, Spanish,\r\nGermans, successively trampled over the rich fields of Flanders and the\r\nindustrious country of the Walloons. In fifty years, from 1642 to 1709,\r\nno less than ten famous battles were fought on Belgian soil. Belgium\r\nwas already at that time “the cockpit of Christendom,” a designation\r\nfound in an old English book, _Instructions for Forreine Travell_;\r\nwritten in 1642 by James Howell, a clerk in the diplomatic service.[17]\r\nHowell says:\r\n\r\n  ... For the Netherlands have been for many years, as one may say, the\r\n  very cockpit of Christendom, the school of arms and rendezvous of all\r\n  adventurous spirits and cadets; which makes most nations beholden to\r\n  them for soldiers. Therefore the history of the Belgic wars are very\r\n  worth the reading; for I know none fuller of stratagems, of reaches\r\n  of policy, ... nor a war which hath produced such deplorable effects,\r\n  directly or collaterally, all Christendom over, both by sea and land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURT-YARD OF THE PALACE OF THE BISHOP PRINCES IN LIÈGE]\r\n\r\nWhat all these wars meant for the poor inhabitants of the country may\r\nbe imagined when the devastation wrought by huge armies in Poland today\r\nis borne in mind. And it must be remembered that the armies of the\r\nbelligerent powers in the seventeenth century were, to a large extent,\r\ncomposed of mercenaries without any feeling of patriotism, without\r\ndiscipline, without morals, who saw in military occupation only an\r\nopportunity for excesses and outrages of all kinds, who revolted when\r\nnot regularly paid, and who pillaged the friendly country they were\r\nhired to defend as well as the enemy’s territory. Massacre, burning,\r\nlooting, awful tortures inflicted on the unhappy inhabitants in order\r\nto force them to reveal the spot where their money was kept--all\r\nthis was daily work for those rough hirelings. In the village of\r\nMeix-devant-Virton, in 1636, the whole populace was burned alive in the\r\nchurch where it had taken refuge, not by the enemy, but by the Spanish\r\ntroops intrusted with their defense.[18] Ruin, disease, and poverty\r\nwere the terrible lot of Belgium during this sinister century.\r\n\r\nWhat of the internal situation of the country? After the death of\r\nArchduke Albert (1621), the Spaniards increasingly dominated the\r\ndestinies of Belgium. A Spanish army, paid by Spain and under a Spanish\r\ncommander, permanently occupied many fortresses and important cities.\r\nThose members of the Belgian aristocracy who sought to obtain influence\r\nwith the intruders found themselves compelled to marry their daughters\r\nto Spaniards. The Spanish government put the native nobles entirely\r\naside, and all important matters were discussed in _Juntas_--special\r\ncommittees composed of Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThis unhappy state of things in 1622-33 provoked the so-called\r\n“conspiracy of the Belgian nobility against Spain.” This was the work\r\nof some prominent _seigneurs_ who failed to realize the historical\r\nconditions and the times in which they lived. They fondly believed\r\nthat, with the help of France and of the United Provinces, they could\r\nstart another Belgian revolt, like that of the sixteenth century, and\r\nthat they could obtain support from the army and the people. They\r\nfound themselves seriously mistaken. The Belgians, wearied of their\r\nmisfortunes, refused to follow them. They had no confidence in the\r\nmovement. The attempt failed and the conspirators were obliged to\r\nflee to foreign countries to avoid criminal prosecution. As for the\r\nStates-General, except in 1600 and 1632-34, they were never called\r\ntogether; only when there was talk of peace negotiations with the\r\nUnited Provinces were they allowed to meet.\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Hapsburg dynasty in Spain came to an end with the death\r\nof the last heir, Charles II, in 1700. The latter had provided in his\r\nwill that Philip of Bourbon, grandson of Louis XIV, of France, should\r\nbe his successor and consequently sovereign of the Netherlands. As a\r\nmatter of fact, it was Louis XIV who governed in the name of Philip.\r\nThe absolutist system which existed in France was suddenly introduced\r\nin Belgium, and organized by the Count of Bergeyck, with the help of\r\nFrench generals. This régime did not last long; in 1702 the War of the\r\nSpanish Succession broke out, in the course of which England and the\r\nUnited Provinces concluded an alliance against Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThree treaties terminated the struggle--that of Utrecht, that of\r\nRastadt, and that of Bade (1713-14). The contracting powers decided\r\nthat the Netherlands--that is to say, Belgium--should be transferred to\r\nthe Austrian branch of the Hapsburgs. They would serve as a barrier for\r\nthe protection of the United Provinces against any menace from France,\r\nand it was determined, therefore, that the Dutch should continue to\r\noccupy Belgian territory provisionally till all questions had been\r\nsettled. A final agreement was reached by the Treaty of Antwerp, better\r\nknown as the “Treaty of the Barriers” (1715), somewhat modified by\r\nthe Hague Convention of 1718. These several conventions placed the\r\nHapsburgs of Austria in full possession of Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBELGIUM UNDER THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA (1713-89)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the house of Austria came into possession of Belgium only ten\r\nprovinces out of the seventeen of the old Spanish Netherlands were\r\nleft: Brabant, Limburg, Luxemburg, Namur, Hainaut, the seigniory of\r\nTournai, the seigniory of Tournaisis, Flanders, the seigniory of\r\nMalines, a part of Gueldre. West Flanders, including Ypres and some\r\nadjoining districts, formed a separate department.\r\n\r\nThe Hapsburgs of Austria were not to be regarded as foreign conquerors\r\nof Belgium. From the outset they had claimed to be the natural heirs\r\nof the Hapsburgs of Spain, and that claim was admitted by France,\r\nEngland, and Holland, and by the States-General of the Belgian\r\nprovinces. There could be no question of Austrian “domination.” In\r\ntheir relation to Belgium the Hapsburgs assumed the title of natural\r\nprince, as did Charles V at the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\nMoreover, by the Treaty of the Barriers, Charles VI of Austria publicly\r\nproclaimed that his house assumed the rule over Belgium, subject to\r\nall the restrictions and guaranties to which the Hapsburgs of Spain\r\nhad been subject. According to the treaties, Belgium was ceded to the\r\nAustrian Hapsburgs on condition that the predominance of the Catholic\r\nchurch in the country as well as the rights of the states and cities\r\nbe recognized. The Catholic church and its position as the religion\r\nof the state were to be respected on account of the desire of France\r\nto erect a moral and religious barrier between herself and Protestant\r\nHolland; the popular rights were to be respected because the theory\r\nof the European balance of power required that the Emperor should be\r\npermitted only a limited sway. A strong, universal monarchy was no\r\nlonger possible in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the European balance of power had found expression\r\nthrough the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), whereby Europe ceased to be\r\nexclusively and officially Catholic, and Protestantism was granted\r\nrecognition in law. Since the arbitration of the Pope in international\r\nmatters was no longer possible, owing to the refusal of the Protestant\r\npowers to acknowledge his decisions, each country had to rely only upon\r\nitself. The weaker states had only one protection, therefore, namely,\r\nto unite against any power which might try to absorb them. Out of these\r\nprinciples grew the idea of the European balance of power, according to\r\nwhich no state was to be allowed to grow strong enough to menace the\r\npeace of the world.\r\n\r\nThe external constitution of Belgium under Austrian rule having been\r\nestablished, Charles VI proceeded to protect the rights of his family\r\nin respect to internal conditions. As Charles V had established the\r\nprinciple of the indivisibility of the Spanish Netherlands by the\r\nAugsburg transaction, already mentioned, the new Emperor established\r\nthe same principle for the “Austrian Netherlands” by a similar act,\r\nthe “Pragmatic Sanction” of 1725. Belgium was forever to be kept as an\r\nindivisible whole, the eldest son to be heir to the throne, and the\r\nright of succession of the female descendants in case of the failure of\r\na male heir was again admitted.\r\n\r\nWell-defined obligations to the United Provinces of Holland were\r\nimposed upon Belgium by the Treaty of the Barriers. The Belgian\r\nsovereign was required to permit the presence of Dutch garrisons on\r\nBelgian soil, as a protection for Holland against France, in the cities\r\nand fortresses of Namur, Tournai, Furnes, Warneton, Ypres, and Knocke.\r\nA heavy yearly subsidy was to be paid by Belgium for the maintenance\r\nof those garrisons. The sovereign was also required to recognize the\r\nclosing of the Scheldt, imposed by the Treaty of Munster (1648).\r\nHolland even claimed the right to prevent the Belgians from trading\r\nwith the Indies.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these claims, Charles VI had tried to restore Belgian\r\ntrade by the foundation of a shipping company, the “Compagnie\r\nd’Ostende,” created under an imperial charter, for commercial dealings\r\nwith America. But the opposition offered by Holland, supported by\r\nFrance and England, so influenced the weak Emperor as to induce him\r\nto suspend and finally to disband the company--the only hope for the\r\nrestoration of national trade.\r\n\r\nThe obligation to maintain foreign garrisons in Belgium was both\r\ndrastic and humiliating. Empress Maria Theresa, who succeeded Charles\r\nVI as the sovereign of the Austrian Netherlands in virtue of the\r\nprovision of the “Pragmatic Sanction,” tried to avoid the obligation of\r\nthe “Barrier” by withholding payment due to the foreign garrisons. The\r\nfinal blow to this unjust system was given by her son, Emperor Joseph\r\nII, who simply ordered the demolition of the fortresses still occupied\r\nby the Dutch on Belgian soil.\r\n\r\nJoseph II, who was greatly interested in the restoration of the\r\nprosperity of the country, even attempted to secure the complete\r\nopening of the Scheldt, still closed by the Dutch. After diplomatic\r\nnegotiations, begun in 1784, had failed, owing to the energetic\r\nopposition of the United Provinces, once more supported by France, the\r\nEmperor tried to settle the question in a practical but simple manner.\r\nHe ordered a vessel to leave Antwerp and follow the course of the river\r\ndown to the sea, and another vessel to start from Ostend and follow the\r\ncourse of the river up to Antwerp. The Dutch, he hoped, would not fire\r\nupon the vessels, and the Scheldt would be opened to shipping by this\r\nstratagem. But the Dutch did fire, and forced the Belgian vessels to\r\nwithdraw. Any further move on the part of the Emperor would mean war,\r\nand for this Joseph II was not prepared. The Scheldt remained closed.\r\n\r\nWhat was the policy of the Austrian Hapsburgs toward the institutions\r\nof the country? It was essentially Austrian, and tended toward\r\nabsolutism, influenced nevertheless by the teachings of the French\r\nphilosophical school. It aimed at the diminution of the liberty of the\r\nclergy and the recognition of the state as superior to the church; at\r\nstrengthening the sovereign power, overriding the national institutions\r\nand the ancient and well-established privileges; at conferring\r\npolitical initiative on the Austrian governor-general of Belgium;\r\nat depriving the Belgian nobility of any participation in political\r\naffairs; at recruiting public officers from among the jurists only;\r\nat avoiding any brutal attack upon the national institutions, but at\r\nundermining them in a secret manner. It cannot be denied, however, that\r\nthe Austrian government did its best to restore the material welfare\r\nof the country; and the manufacturing and agricultural interests were\r\nfostered by two Austrian ministers, both of Italian nationality,\r\nAntoniotto di Botta Adorno, under Maria Theresa, and Count Giovanni\r\nGiacomo di Belgiojoso, during the reign of Joseph II.\r\n\r\nThis Emperor had a sincere desire to promote the material welfare of\r\nthe Belgian people, and it is a historical fact that at the beginning\r\nof his reign he visited Belgium incognito, accompanied by one of\r\nhis ministers, in order to examine into everything himself and to\r\ntake such measures as he might find to be necessary. Unfortunately\r\nhe was somewhat of an idealist, imbued with the theories of the\r\nFrench philosophy of the eighteenth century and the teachings of\r\n“Febronianism.”\r\n\r\nFrance was at this time the center of an intellectual and moral\r\ncurrent, which exerted a powerful influence on the courts and the\r\nhigher classes of all Europe. The social, philosophical, economical,\r\nand governmental doctrines of the Encyclopaedists and the Physiocrats\r\nattacked the basis of the existing society. They proposed the creation\r\nof an entirely new social and political order, breaking with tradition,\r\nand conceived of as independent of any Christian idea. On the other\r\nhand, the doctrines of the superiority of the state over the church\r\nwere already promulgated, since Van Espen, a Belgian jurist of the\r\nseventeenth century, had supported them. They were codified in 1763\r\nby Febronius, the suffragan bishop of Treves, who developed them to\r\nthe extreme limit. He proposed breaking up the Catholic church into\r\nnational churches, under the supervision of the state. His book had an\r\nimmense success at the German courts, even those of the ecclesiastical\r\nprincipalities.\r\n\r\nJoseph II had been converted to the ideas of the French Encyclopaedists\r\nand Physiocrats as well as to the teachings of Febronianism. An\r\nabsolutist by conviction, an enemy of the liberties of the church,\r\ndespising all things of the past, and lacking in the adroitness which\r\ncharacterized Maria Theresa’s government, he sought to put in force\r\nwithout delay the new concept of human society that he had conceived.\r\nHe tried to force upon Belgium a whole series of reforms, by means of\r\nsovereign decrees, between the years 1781 and 1787. The fundamental\r\nideas at the basis of these reforms may be summarized as follows: the\r\nsecularization of political society; the incorporation of the Catholic\r\nchurch in Belgium as a part of the national Austrian church; and the\r\nrecognition of the sovereign power as absolute and unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe political secularization of Belgium was attempted by the Edicts\r\nof Tolerance, issued in 1781-82. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction was\r\nsuppressed; non-Catholics were put upon nearly the same level as\r\nCatholics, and public worship was permitted to them under certain\r\nrestrictions. Subject to a dispensation from the sovereign, they were\r\nadmitted to public offices and could become burgesses and members of\r\ncraft-guilds. In 1784 another edict fixed new rules for marriages, and\r\nprevented the ecclesiastical judge from dealing with the canonical\r\nimpediments declared by canon law.\r\n\r\nAs for the subordination of the church to the state, the religious\r\norders were no longer allowed to show obedience to their foreign\r\nsuperiors; the jurisdiction of the Nuncio of Cologne over Belgium\r\nwas abolished; the Belgian bishops were forbidden to correspond with\r\nRome on the matter of dispensations for marriages; a large number\r\nof convents were declared to be useless and were suppressed, their\r\nproperties being placed under the administration of the state;\r\nparishes were delimited by the government; all the confraternities\r\nof a religious nature were suppressed and replaced by a single one,\r\nwhich the Emperor-Philosopher called the “Brotherhood of Love for\r\nFellow-Creatures.” All the seminaries for the education of priests\r\nwere closed, and in 1786 a General Seminary was established at Louvain\r\nand in Luxemburg, at which theology was to be taught, subject to the\r\ncontrol of the state. A very drastic measure was the suppression of any\r\nsubsidy to the society of the Bollandists, the Belgian Jesuits who were\r\nresponsible for the criticism and the publication of the Lives of the\r\nSaints, and who were known all over Europe for their scientific methods\r\nand their superior culture.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 came the upheaval of the political institutions. The three\r\n“collateral councils”--the Council of State, the Privy Council, and\r\nthe Council of Finances--were abolished. The Secretary of State, the\r\nprovincial states, the provincial councils of justice, the seigniorial\r\nor manorial justice, the jurisdiction of the _échevinage_, the\r\necclesiastical tribunals, the special tribunal of the University of\r\nLouvain which had jurisdiction over offenses committed by students, and\r\nall other courts of justice except the military tribunals, were at one\r\nstroke suppressed. Joseph II, by a simple act of his sovereign will,\r\nwiped out the old institutions and introduced the Austrian autocracy.\r\n\r\nBut the Belgians, who had always fought against the enemies of their\r\ninstitutions and privileges, did not submit peacefully to this brutal\r\nattack upon their liberties. Of course, many of the reforms of the\r\nEmperor were not open to criticism, and his motives cannot be said\r\nto have been wholly wrong. His efforts, however, were too general\r\nin their nature, and were attended with too far-reaching results.\r\nAt first there was only passive resistance. The bishops had begun\r\nby protesting against the religious reforms. The general edicts of\r\n1787 called forth a storm of revolt among all classes of the people.\r\nDeclarations, petitions, manifestos poured in upon the Emperor’s court.\r\nThe edicts of 1787 were thereupon partly suspended. But the religious\r\nreforms were not abated. The establishment of the General Seminary\r\nand the order for the closing of the diocesan seminaries were not\r\nrescinded, and force was resorted to against the Archbishop of Malines,\r\nFrankenberg, and the University of Louvain in carrying them out. This\r\nshocked the Belgian people, who at heart were Catholic, and the harsh\r\nmeasures of the Austrian General D’Alton made the situation still more\r\ncritical. Two parties came into existence: that of the nationalists,\r\ncalled “Patriots,” and that of the Austrian sympathizers, called by\r\nthe people “Figs.” In 1788, owing to the resistance of the states of\r\nBrabant and Hainaut, the arrest of their members and the abolition of\r\nthe privileges of Brabant, among them the famous “Joyeuse Entrée,” were\r\nordered. General D’Alton became more and more dictatorial and cruel.\r\nThe result was a serious revolution, known in history as the Brabantine\r\nRevolution (1789).\r\n\r\nThe revolt was the consequence of two elements among the people,\r\nwhich though at heart directly opposed to each other were temporarily\r\nunited against the foreign tyranny. Each movement had its own leader,\r\nVan der Noot and Vonck, and both were lawyers of Brabant. Van der\r\nNoot proposed to deliver Belgium by the assistance of foreign powers,\r\nespecially Prussia--the enemy of Austria--and Holland. Vonck, on the\r\nother hand, placed his confidence in the Belgians alone, and told the\r\npeople that the great powers would betray them. Both were forced to\r\nflee the country in order to escape the anger of General D’Alton. Both\r\nestablished committees for revolutionary propaganda, Van der Noot in\r\nHolland, where he established connections in Prussia; Vonck in the\r\nterritory of the principality of Liège. Later both committees succeeded\r\nin agreeing upon a common plan of action. Like William the Silent in\r\nthe sixteenth century, Van der Noot issued a manifesto proclaiming\r\nthe deposition of Joseph II as sovereign of the Austrian Netherlands.\r\nA national army, recruited on foreign soil, invaded Belgium. The\r\nAustrians were defeated and compelled to evacuate the country, except\r\nLuxemburg, where they made a stand. The victors then proclaimed a\r\nrepublic, known in history under the official title of the “République\r\ndes États Belgiques unis” (Republic of the United States of Belgium).\r\nIn each province the body of the states--delegates of the clergy, the\r\nnobility, and the people--were given the exercise of sovereignty, and\r\nthe traditional institutions of the Burgundian times were restored.\r\nIn 1790 the provinces held a general meeting at Brussels, where the\r\nfederal pact between them and the central power was established by the\r\nso-called Act of Union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOWN HALL OF BRUSSELS AND THE GREAT SQUARE]\r\n\r\nAccording to this act, the provinces of the Catholic Netherlands\r\nconstituted themselves a confederation, under that name. The\r\nconfederation exercised sovereign power, and controlled the common\r\ndefense, the power of making war and peace, the recruiting and\r\nmaintaining of a national army, the making of alliances, the coinage\r\nof a common currency. The power residing in the confederation was\r\nexercised by a Congress composed of deputies from all the provinces,\r\nwho acted without referring back to the provincial states. Each\r\nprovince had a certain number of votes in the Congress: Brabant 20\r\nvotes, Flanders 22, etc. The confederated provinces made a declaration\r\nfavoring the Roman Catholic faith and the maintenance of relations with\r\nthe church as before the reforms of Joseph II. Each province retained\r\nits autonomy and sovereign rights, and all powers not delegated to\r\nthe Congress. In case of attack all provinces were to join in the\r\ndefense of the one attacked. This, we know, had been the dream of\r\nEmperor Charles V in the sixteenth century. The great ruler must have\r\nrejoiced in his grave! The Congress was presided over by a president,\r\nwho held office for a limited period, and three committees were created\r\nwithin the Congress: one for political, one for military, and one for\r\nfinancial affairs. The president was assisted by a prime minister and a\r\nsecretary of state.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact that there is a\r\nvery close resemblance between the constitution of the Belgian Republic\r\nand the first constitution of the American Republic, whose articles\r\nwere approved in 1777. The question whether the Belgian Patriots\r\nwere in any way inspired by the first American constitution remains\r\nunsettled, as it has not yet been studied in this light.\r\n\r\nAlas! the “République des États Belgiques unis” did not live long.\r\nInternal struggles between partisans of Vonck, who fell more and more\r\nunder the influence of the French revolutionary clubs and talked much\r\nabout national assemblies and popular sovereignty, and the partisans\r\nof the more conservative Van der Noot paved the way for the final\r\ncollapse. But the bitterest disappointment came from outside. The great\r\npowers--England, Holland, and Prussia--which had liberally encouraged\r\nthe Patriots in their revolt because of its tendency to weaken Austria\r\nand to prevent her policy of extension in the east of Europe toward\r\nConstantinople, betrayed the young republic. Their support of the\r\nBelgian claims had been inspired by the idea of the European balance\r\nof power, but they cared little for the independence of the country.\r\nThe conference held at Reichenbach, in which England, Prussia, Holland,\r\nand Austria participated merely resulted in a decision to restore\r\nAustrian rule in Belgium, with guaranties for the maintenance of the\r\nancient institutions and an amnesty for the past. The Treaty of the\r\nHague (1790) definitely settled the question. Thus died the Belgian\r\nrepublic after a year of existence, but it had not existed in vain. The\r\nTreaty of the Hague gave constitutional value to facts and principles\r\nwhich hitherto had depended only on the good will of the sovereign.\r\nEmperor Leopold II again occupied the “Austrian Netherlands”; but the\r\nnew Austrian rule was to have as short an existence as had the Belgian\r\nrepublic. The French Revolution was destined to drive the Austrians out\r\nof Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nBELGIUM UNDER FRENCH DOMINATION\r\n\r\n(1792-1814)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French revolutionary clubs had exerted a powerful influence\r\non Vonck. The effect of their teachings had also been felt in the\r\nindependent principality of Liège and had provoked a rising of the\r\npeople against the bishop-prince. But the revolt of Liège, which\r\noccurred at the same time as the revolt in Belgium against Joseph II\r\n(1789), was quickly suppressed.\r\n\r\nWhen France itself fell a victim to the revolutionary leaders, the\r\ngreat Revolution broke loose. The French soon found themselves\r\nconfronted by a European coalition and were forced into war. Since\r\nAustria was inimical to the Revolution, the French troops invaded the\r\nBelgian possessions of the Hapsburgs in 1792 under the leadership of\r\nGeneral Dumouriez. They found not a few sympathizers in the country.\r\nThe partisans of Van der Noot looked to the French to deliver them from\r\nthe Austrian yoke; the partisans of Vonck had always been agents of\r\nthe French revolutionary leaders, and desired the annexation of their\r\ncountry to France. After the victory of Jemappes (1792), the French\r\nentered Belgium, loudly proclaiming that they came as liberators of the\r\npeople and desired only the destruction of Austrian tyranny. Although\r\nthe excesses of their troops seemed to contradict this statement,\r\nthe people believed them. Then came the second and final defeat of\r\nthe Austrians at the battle of Fleurus (1794). Both Belgium and the\r\nprincipality of Liège were occupied by the victors.\r\n\r\nA period of terrible excesses followed. The French National Convention\r\nentirely abolished all the ancient institutions; a provisional\r\nadministration was established, and “clubs” with political aims were\r\nintroduced into all the cities. Taxes, requisitions, systematic\r\npillage, outrages on religious convictions rained upon the unhappy\r\ninhabitants. General elections were forced upon the Belgians and\r\nmanipulated by the “Sans-culottes” and political agents so as to give\r\nthe impression of a referendum, through which the people should express\r\ntheir desire to be annexed to France. This plan encountered general\r\nhostility throughout the country. Thereupon the National Convention,\r\nby a law voted and applied on October 1, 1795, simply annexed Belgium\r\nand the principality of Liège. As Austria was too weak to defend her\r\npossessions, it formally ceded the Austrian Netherlands to France and\r\nrecognized the annexation by the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797).\r\n\r\nThe French now treated the conquered territory with great harshness.\r\nThe followers of the Catholic religion were severely persecuted, the\r\nchurches were closed, the priests were sentenced to death or deported\r\nto French Guiana and to the islands of Ré and Oléron, the Catholic\r\nworship was suppressed and replaced by that of the “Goddess of Reason.”\r\nFor the first time in Belgian history military conscription was forced\r\nupon the inhabitants, and the youth of the country was compelled to\r\nshed its blood on foreign battlefields for a régime it abhorred.\r\n\r\nThis naturally stirred up bitter resentment; and, even as they had\r\nrisen against Joseph II, so a part at least of the Belgians rose\r\nagainst the French. This revolt is known as the War of the Peasants\r\n(1798-99), because it was mainly the people of the countryside in\r\nFlanders, Campine, and Luxemburg who fought in defense of their hearths\r\nand their religion. They fought heroically with old weapons, scythes,\r\npikes, and guns of old pattern, under the leadership of a few nobles\r\nand burgesses. There is a close resemblance between their struggle\r\nand that of the French peasants in the Vendée. But what could they\r\naccomplish against the well-equipped armies of the Republic? The\r\negotism of the educated classes, which gave them no support at all,\r\nand their lack of training and experience, soon brought their valiant\r\nresistance to an inglorious end. One after another their bands were\r\nexterminated, and those who did not fall on the battlefield died\r\nagainst a wall by the bullets of a firing squad.\r\n\r\nTheir gallantry did not save the country. Belgium remained fifteen\r\nyears longer under French domination. The Concordat concluded in 1801\r\nbetween Pope Pius VII and Napoleon Bonaparte brought the religious\r\npersecution to an end, and the Catholic worship was restored. When\r\nBonaparte had become Emperor Napoleon I, the glory which surrounded\r\nhis name made a profound impression on the Belgians, and the great\r\nEmperor became very popular among them. Antwerp attracted all his\r\nattention; and it is due to him that the Scheldt, after a century and\r\na half of being closed, was again opened to trade and was freed from\r\nthe tyrannous control of the Dutch. As military conscription still\r\nprevailed, the Belgians filled the ranks of the imperial army, and\r\ntheir blood was shed for the fame and the power of Napoleon all over\r\nEurope. The conqueror left on the country, however, the impress of his\r\nspirit of organization in the famous _Code Napoléon_, that monument\r\nof civil law that still forms the basis of Belgian jurisprudence. The\r\nspell of his name appeared from the fact that after the defeat of his\r\narmies at Leipzig in 1813 there was no revolt against him in Belgium as\r\nthere was in Holland.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Napoleon ended the French domination of the Belgians\r\n(1814). However, the diplomats who rearranged the map of Europe, while\r\nthe once mighty Emperor was sent to St. Helena, had determined that the\r\ncountry was not to be restored to its former political status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH RULE AND THE BELGIAN REVOLT OF 1830\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, the powers were called upon to decide the\r\npolitical status of Belgium. The Belgians were not consulted in the\r\nmatter, vitally important as it was, and their country was considered\r\nmerely as the spoil of the Allies. The main idea that actuated the\r\nCongress of Vienna (1814-15) in rearranging the map of Europe was\r\nto prevent a new menace from the side of France. This country was\r\nnot allowed to hold more territory than it possessed in 1789, before\r\nthe outbreak of the Revolution; at the same time the Allies who had\r\ndefeated Napoleon sought to erect a bulwark against any new extension\r\nof France in the North. They could have granted independence to\r\nBelgium, but as the country was weak it seemed that independence would\r\nmean reabsorption by France. The final settlement of this important\r\nquestion resulted, therefore, in the formation of the new Kingdom of\r\nthe Netherlands, whereby both Belgium and Holland, united under the\r\nsame sovereign, would, it was expected, present a sufficiently strong\r\nbarrier against France. The new kingdom was declared also to be neutral\r\nterritory. This is the first time that the conception of neutrality\r\nwas realized with regard to a buffer-state in Western Europe, located\r\nbetween England, France, and Germany. But the conception of neutrality,\r\nas applied to the Netherlands, is much older than the Congress of\r\nVienna; and it seems worth while to trace the different schemes\r\ndealing with Belgian neutrality before the years 1814-15.[19]\r\n\r\nThe idea of establishing the neutrality of the Netherlands goes back in\r\nhistory as far as the government of Maria of Hungary, at the time of\r\nEmperor Charles V. The former proposed the neutrality of the Belgian\r\nprovinces on February 8, 1536, in order that they might escape being\r\nmade the battlefield of Europe during the impending international\r\nconflicts. Charles V refused to consider the scheme, as he himself was\r\nplanning to raise the Netherlands into an independent kingdom, to be\r\ngoverned by the son of Francis I, King of France. This plan, of course,\r\nwas never carried out.\r\n\r\nIn 1634 France and Holland concluded a special treaty against Spain,\r\nby which the Netherlands should either become an independent kingdom\r\nor be divided between the contracting powers. Cardinal Richelieu, the\r\nFrench minister, preferred the idea of an independent Belgium, and went\r\nso far as to propose that this kingdom should be permanently neutral.\r\nIn that way the cornerstone of Spanish power in Europe would have\r\nbeen destroyed. Although neutral, Belgium would have had the right\r\nto conclude offensive alliances, but would not enjoy the benefit of\r\nhaving the integrity of its territory guaranteed. If that scheme had\r\nbeen carried out, the Belgians would have had to revolt against Spanish\r\nrule. But the Belgians, owing to the presence of strong Spanish armies\r\nwithin their borders, did not revolt. The plan of Richelieu failed.\r\nHis scheme was, however, taken over by Cardinal Mazarin, minister of\r\nLouis XIV. Mazarin had first suggested the annexation of Belgium by\r\nFrance, but he met with strong opposition on the part of Holland and\r\nEngland, both interested in keeping the French menace from extending\r\nright to their own doors. Changing his mind, Mazarin, in 1658, reverted\r\nto Richelieu’s plan concerning the creation of an independent and\r\nneutral Belgium. This proposal met with the strong opposition of the\r\nDutch “Staatspensionnaris” De Witt, who expressed the fear that such a\r\nstate would ruin Dutch trade--an independent Belgium would necessarily\r\nbe given a free Scheldt. He also made it clear that Holland could not\r\nforego her right to meddle in the affairs of the Catholic Netherlands,\r\nand that the idea of a common protectorate over them would be welcome.\r\nMazarin seems not to have been sincere when proposing his plan. It may\r\nbe inferred that his main object was to quiet the fear of Holland that\r\nthe French and the English would use Belgium as a base during their\r\noperations against Spain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Treaty of the Barriers (1715) threatened to impose upon\r\nBelgium the Dutch garrisons which were maintained for protection\r\nagainst France, the latter presented (February 17) a memoir to Holland,\r\nagain proposing the status of permanent neutrality for Belgium.\r\nThe egotism and ill-will of the Dutch defeated this proposal. They\r\nwould never have consented to the opening of the Scheldt, which was\r\na necessary condition for an independent Belgium. Their policy on\r\nthis point is made clear by the declaration of the States-General of\r\nthe United Provinces, when Emperor Joseph II, in 1756, endeavored to\r\nobtain the opening of the Scheldt and free shipping on the river.\r\nThe States-General declared that “the salvation or the loss of the\r\nRepublic and its inhabitants depended upon this point.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution of the Belgians against Austrian rule broke out\r\nin 1789, the Elector Frederick-William of Prussia tried in vain to\r\nobtain from the other powers, England and Holland, the recognition\r\nof the Belgian Republic. He proposed that they should recognize the\r\nindependence of Belgium and compel the Belgians “to establish a firm,\r\nstrong constitution, in conformity with the interests of the Allies...;\r\nto create, subject to the advice of the Allies, a respectable military\r\nstate that would inspire confidence; to avoid alliances with powers,\r\nenemies of the Allies, and also trade with them.”\r\n\r\nAs Prussia was ready to make war on Austria, her hereditary enemy,\r\nEmperor Leopold II declared that he would, in case of war, cede\r\nthe “Austrian Netherlands” to France. This England could not have\r\npermitted, and therefore that country withdrew support from Prussia,\r\ncausing the Elector Frederick-William to abandon his plan concerning\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nThe French conquest of Belgium entirely changed the policy of the\r\nEuropean powers with regard to the Belgian problem. England now\r\nsaw the French menace facing her own shores, and, according to her\r\ntraditional policy, began to take measures to avoid the danger. On\r\nNovember 13, 1813, Lord Castlereagh wrote to the English ambassador\r\nin Vienna: “I must particularly recommend you to pay attention to\r\nAntwerp.... Leaving Antwerp in the hands of France means, or almost\r\nmeans, imposing on us the necessity of a continuous state of war.” It\r\nwas now England that was specially interested in the future status\r\nof Belgium, and it is from that country that emanated the idea,\r\nforcibly expressed, of establishing a strong bulwark against France\r\nby the creation of the neutral kingdom of the Netherlands. The idea,\r\nsupported by Prussia, which, as we have seen, had advocated it some\r\nyears before, was, however, this time expressed by Lord Castlereagh;\r\nand the aggrandizement of Holland by its union with Belgium was\r\nstrongly supported by the Duke of Wellington. Accordingly, on July 31,\r\n1814, the Belgian provinces were formally handed over to the Prince\r\nof Orange, whom the Dutch had made their sovereign the year before.\r\nThe arrangement was confirmed by the Congress of Vienna, and made to\r\ninclude Liège and Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nThe union of Belgium and Holland was the work of diplomacy: the\r\nBelgians had not even been consulted. It was an essentially bad\r\ncombination. Had the “complete and intimate fusion,” of which the\r\ndiplomats spoke, been possible between both countries, the projectors\r\nwould have accomplished an admirable work, offering the surest\r\nguaranties for the maintenance of European peace and the durability of\r\ntheir own fabric. But unfortunately the conception was utopian.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the fact that the Allies disdained to consult the\r\nfeelings of the Belgian people, they appeared to have lost sight of\r\nthe moral history of the Netherlands, and to have forgotten those\r\ndeep-rooted hatreds, jealousies, and dissensions, both religious\r\nand political, that had divided the two peoples since the time\r\nof their separation in the sixteenth century. Count Charles Van\r\nHoogendorp, a prominent member of the Dutch chamber, in a pamphlet\r\nentitled _Séparation de la Hollande et de la Belgique_, October,\r\n1830 (Amsterdam), himself acknowledged the lack of sympathy between\r\nthese peoples: “The difference of national character had engendered\r\ngrievances, and these grievances had excited universal discontent, and\r\nnational animosity. The division between the two countries existed\r\n_de facto_. Instead of a fusion, all the means employed to amalgamate\r\nthe two people had only served to disunite them still further. This\r\ndiscontent was not the birth of a day; it dates from the first union of\r\nthe two states.”\r\n\r\nAfter peace had been restored in 1815, when Napoleon had suffered\r\ndefeat at Waterloo, difficulties began at once. In March, 1814, Holland\r\nhad adopted a constitution. Inspired by the old laws of the United\r\nProvinces, it was in the main strongly Protestant. Eleven Dutch, eleven\r\nBelgians, and two delegates representing Luxemburg were appointed to\r\ntransform this constitution into one that could be applied to the new\r\nkingdom of the Netherlands. The commission proposed the introduction\r\nof equality and toleration for all creeds throughout the kingdom, and\r\nthe creation of a two-chambered Parliament in which Holland and Belgium\r\nwere to have an equal number of representatives, although the Belgians\r\nhad 50 per cent more population. No national capital was specified,\r\nbut the King was to be invested both at Amsterdam and at some city in\r\nBelgium. On these principles a fundamental constitution was drafted\r\nand submitted contemporaneously to the Dutch States-General and to\r\nthe notables of the different Belgian provinces. The Dutch passed it\r\nunanimously; the Belgians rejected it by a vote of 1,603 to 527. This\r\nrejection was partly due to the unwillingness of the Belgian notables\r\nto legalize religious equality. The Dutch King, William I, decided to\r\nmeet the difficulty in a simple manner. He announced that all who had\r\nabstained from voting should be counted as voting for the act, and\r\nthat the 126 hostile votes still remaining as a majority against the\r\nact after counting in its favor those refraining from voting should\r\nnot count, as the principle of religious liberty had been imposed by\r\nthe Congress of Vienna and had to be observed. This method, which the\r\nBelgians called “Dutch arithmetic,” gave to the act 933 votes in its\r\nfavor as against 670 hostile votes, and it was declared passed.\r\n\r\nIt became more and more clear that William I was not “the right man in\r\nthe right place”: he was too Protestant, too Dutch, too autocratic for\r\nthe Belgians. The latter soon complained of new grievances, among which\r\nthe following were the most important: the imposition of the Dutch\r\nlanguage upon all functionaries, whether civil or military, without\r\ngranting time to learn it to those who could not speak it; the extreme\r\npartiality shown in the distribution of all offices and emoluments;\r\nand a financial system that bore heavily and unjustly on Belgium. The\r\nBelgians were made to contribute to the payment of debts incurred by\r\nHolland long prior to the union, and to pay for the defense of the\r\nDutch colonies, which yielded them no returns at all. The Haute Cour,\r\nor supreme court of justice, and all other great public institutions\r\nwere established in Holland. The religious grievances were also\r\nnumerous: the government was ill disposed toward the Catholics, and it\r\nwas supposed that it desired to “Protestantize” the people. Since 1815,\r\nthe Belgian bishops, under the leadership of Monsignor de Broglie,\r\nbishop of Ghent, had dissuaded their flocks from taking the oath to a\r\nconstitution that introduced liberty of worship. Moreover, in 1825,\r\nWilliam I, imitating the plan formerly developed by Joseph II, had\r\nestablished a Philosophic College at Louvain where all priests would\r\nreceive their education; and, claiming the monopoly for the state in\r\neducational matters, had suppressed the episcopal and other national\r\ncolleges and free schools. Sundry oppressive taxes, repugnant to the\r\nhabits and usages of the people, were imposed. The freedom of the press\r\nwas destroyed, and journalists were continually prosecuted before\r\nthe tribunals. The King even pressed into service ignominious French\r\npamphleteers, expelled from their own country, who daily insulted the\r\nBelgians.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the descendants of those who had fought the\r\ntyrannies of Spain, Austria, and France. Public opinion became excited,\r\nand in 1828 a union was concluded between the Catholics, partisans of\r\ntradition, and the Liberals, who had adopted the ideas of the French\r\nRevolution. Threatened in their common interests and privileges,\r\nCatholics and Liberals worked together to obtain redress of their\r\ngrievances and to defend their liberties.\r\n\r\nLike Joseph II, the Dutch King refused to hear their complaints, and\r\ncontinued to offend the Belgian people. In 1830 an event of great\r\nimportance fanned the revolt into flame.[20] In July the people of\r\nParis overthrew the French legitimist monarchy and the government of\r\nCharles X. Just as the Brabant Revolution of 1789 was inspired in the\r\nfirst instance by events in Paris and by the fall of the Bastile, so\r\nthe “July days” gave the final impulse to the Belgians in August. On\r\nthe evening of August 25, the Brussels Opera House gave a performance\r\nof Auber’s _La Muette de Portici_. When the hero of the piece sang the\r\nfamous air appealing for revolt and liberty, the effect on the emotions\r\nof his hearers was such as to cause them to rush into the streets and\r\nthen and there inaugurate a revolt against the Dutch. They sacked the\r\nhouse of Van Maenen, the unpopular minister of William I, and that of\r\nLibri, the editor of the official governmental newspaper, and attacked\r\nthe homes of many against whom hatred had long been growing. A guard\r\nof citizens was raised to maintain order and a Committee of Regency\r\nwas established in the Hôtel de Ville. The French tricolor, which\r\nhad first been hoisted--and this proves the interference of French\r\nclubs at the beginning of the Revolution--was replaced by the old\r\nBrabant tricolor (black, yellow, red), which is now the Belgian flag.\r\nThe other chief towns followed and confined their Dutch garrisons\r\nwithin the citadels and forts. Meanwhile a deputation was sent to the\r\nKing, to petition for the administrative separation of Belgium and\r\nHolland, retaining, however, their personal union. William I, unaware\r\nof the gravity of the situation, paid scarcely any attention to the\r\ndelegates. He sent a Dutch army nearly 10,000 strong, with many guns,\r\nunder Prince Frederick, his younger son, to attack Brussels, where\r\nthe revolutionists held the lower town. The troops fought their way\r\nto the very heart of the upper town, but were stopped at the Place\r\nRoyale by the stubborn resistance of the Belgian volunteers. These\r\nwere merely Brussels citizens, reinforced by 300 volunteers from\r\nLiège under Charles Rogier, 200 from Louvain, with Jenneval, author\r\nof the “Brabançonne,”[21] and others from various Walloon towns. For\r\nthree days there was terrible street fighting, and on the night of\r\nSeptember 26-27 Prince Frederick, with at least 1,500 killed and many\r\nwounded, admitted his defeat and left Brussels. Meanwhile a provisional\r\ngovernment had been established, composed of Baron d’Hoogvorst, the\r\ncommander of the volunteers; Charles Rogier, who afterward became the\r\nBelgian prime minister; Count Felix de Merode; Van de Weyer, afterward\r\nBelgian minister in London; Gendebien, the leader of the French party\r\namong the revolutionists, Joly, and De Potter. On October 4, 1830,\r\nthis provisional government declared Belgium an independent state,\r\nand announced its intention of preparing a constitution which was to\r\nbe approved and adopted by a national congress. A special commission\r\ndecided, on October 12, in favor of a constitutional monarchy. The\r\nfinal decree of the congress establishing this constitution as law was\r\nvoted on February 7, 1831.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the new Belgian constitution consisted of the charters and\r\nprivileges of the different Belgian provinces and cities, which dated\r\nfrom the Middle Ages, and especially the “Joyeuse Entrée” of Brabant,\r\nof which mention has already been made. Other liberties, required by\r\nthe spirit of modern times, were added: equality of all the Belgians\r\nbefore the law; freedom of worship, of the press, of association,\r\nof educational teaching, and the right to vote was accorded to all\r\nBelgians who paid a certain amount in taxes.\r\n\r\nSome time after the provisional government had declared Belgium an\r\nindependent state a conference of the powers was held, on November 4,\r\n1830, in London, to consider the new situation created by the Belgian\r\nrevolt: Van der Weyer was sent to represent the Belgian interests. On\r\nDecember 20, a motion made by the British delegate, Lord Palmerston,\r\nwas adopted, which declared Belgium an “independent power.” The victory\r\nof the revolutionists was thus confirmed. At the same time, the plan of\r\na small but active party among them, who had attempted the reannexation\r\nof the country to France, was defeated.\r\n\r\nAnother important question was now to be settled--the choice of\r\na monarch for the new kingdom. The Belgian congress excluded the\r\ncandidacy of the Prince of Orange, who was favored by England and\r\nPrussia, since the accession of this prince would mean practically\r\nreannexation by Holland. Under the influence of the French\r\nsympathizers, led by Gendebien, of the provisional government, and\r\nby its president, Surlet de Chokier, the Belgian congress decided to\r\noffer the crown to the Duke of Nemours, younger son of the French King,\r\nLouis-Philippe. This scheme could not be acceded to by England, since\r\nBelgium would then have been under the direct influence of France. The\r\nEnglish ministry, on February 4, unanimously resolved to declare war\r\non France if Louis-Philippe accepted the offer. So the French King was\r\ncompelled to decline it on behalf of his son. Finally, on June 4, 1831,\r\nthe Belgian congress elected Prince Leopold of Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha,\r\nwidower of the Princess Charlotte of England. Leopold had fought\r\ngallantly in the army of the Allies against Napoleon in 1813 and 1814,\r\nand had just refused the crown of Greece. He was solemnly inaugurated\r\nat Brussels on June 21 as King of the Belgians. He was considered\r\nan English prince, and for the moment France resented his election;\r\nbut Leopold quieted the jealousy of Louis-Philippe by marrying the\r\ndaughter of the French King, Louise of Orléans.\r\n\r\nAnother question to be settled was the delimitation of the boundaries\r\nof the new kingdom. On January 20 and 27, the Conference of London had\r\nissued two protocols, proposing that Belgium be made a perpetually\r\nneutral state; that Holland take all the territory that belonged to the\r\nDutch republic in 1790, and that the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg become\r\nan appanage of the house of Orange; that Belgium should be charged\r\nwith 16/31 of the national debt of the former United Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nThese protocols, favorable to Holland, were immediately accepted by\r\nthe Dutch King, but unequivocally rejected by the Belgians. The second\r\narticle of the London protocols robbed them of Dutch Flanders--the\r\nnorth of the ancient county--of the towns of Maestricht and Venloo and\r\nthe strip of Limburg surrounding them, and also of the Grand Duchy,\r\na part of the old Belgian province of Luxemburg. The loss of this\r\nterritory seemed the more unjust as the inhabitants of those regions\r\nhad participated in the Belgian revolt and did not desire annexation by\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations between the powers and the Belgians would never have\r\nreached a settlement but for King Leopold. The Belgian King persuaded\r\nthe Conference of London to supersede its protocols by a declaration\r\nin eighteen articles, leaving the matter in dispute to be directly\r\nnegotiated between Leopold and William of Holland, with the good\r\noffices of the great powers. The Dutch King refused to recognize the\r\neighteen articles and, on August 2, twelve days after the accession\r\nto the throne of Leopold, invaded Belgium. King Leopold displayed\r\nmilitary skill and courage, but the Belgians had no strong army and\r\ntheir ill-trained troops were badly defeated at Louvain and at Hasselt.\r\nImpending disaster was prevented by the sudden arrival of a French\r\narmy, sent by Louis-Philippe, to whom the Belgian King had appealed\r\nfor help. The French repulsed the Dutch. This intervention of France\r\nseriously alarmed the other powers, and especially England. Fearing\r\nthat French influence might regain a foothold in the new kingdom,\r\nthey precipitately drafted another protocol, called the Twenty-four\r\nArticles, in place of the former eighteen, and took from Belgium\r\nthe whole of the area in dispute, except the district of Arlon, in\r\nLuxemburg. Again the Belgians refused to be stripped; but the threat\r\nof invasion by a German army finally compelled them to accede. On\r\nNovember 15, 1831, Belgium, France, and England signed the Treaty of\r\nthe Twenty-four Articles, to which Russia, Prussia, and Austria soon\r\nafterward assented.\r\n\r\nThis time Holland was unwilling to yield, and the Dutch refused to\r\nevacuate the territory they occupied, especially the citadel of\r\nAntwerp. A French army, under Gérard, marched for the second time into\r\nBelgium, besieged the Antwerp stronghold, and forced the Dutch to\r\ncapitulate (1832). King William continued to refuse to subscribe to\r\nany agreement until 1838. Then, suddenly, he gave his adherence to the\r\nTwenty-four Articles. The Conference of London met again and, on April\r\n18, 1839, the final Treaty of London was signed. The Belgians were\r\ngiven a large reduction in what was agreed should be their contribution\r\nto the debt of the Netherlands, but were forced to surrender the\r\nterritories agreed upon by the treaty of 1831. They did it very\r\nreluctantly, but had no other choice.\r\n\r\nThis Treaty of London is the famous “scrap of paper” of which the\r\nGerman chancellor spoke so disdainfully on August 14, 1914. It\r\nsettled the external relations of Belgium in Europe. By that treaty,\r\nBelgium was declared to be an independent kingdom and was to remain\r\n“a perpetually neutral state,” under the guaranty of the five great\r\npowers. The neutrality of Belgium had been imposed upon the new kingdom\r\nat the instance chiefly of England, who desired above all to maintain\r\nit as a bulwark against France. As King Leopold I himself writes to\r\nQueen Victoria on February 15, 1852, “this neutrality was in the real\r\ninterest of this country, but our good congress here did _not_ wish it:\r\nit was _imposé_ upon them.”\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that so much has been said about the neutrality of\r\nBelgium since the beginning of the European war, it seems worth while\r\nto explain briefly what ought to be understood by the words “permanent\r\nneutrality,” used by the Conference of London.[22]\r\n\r\nArticle VII of the Treaty of London declares: “Belgium, within the\r\nlimits specified in Articles I, II, and IV, shall form an independent\r\nand _perpetually neutral_ state. It shall be bound to observe such\r\nneutrality toward all other states.” A distinction must be made between\r\nthe neutrality imposed by this article on Belgium and the occasional\r\nneutrality of a state, which during a war between other powers wishes\r\nto avoid the conflict and, in a perfectly voluntary manner, proclaims\r\nthat decision to the world. In the recent European war, the United\r\nStates of America observed such an “occasional” neutrality.\r\n\r\nPermanent neutrality is quite another thing. History shows that there\r\nare certain countries, certain geographical zones, which, by virtue of\r\ntheir situation, are in some way predestined to become periodically\r\nthe theater of struggles between nations. The subjection of such a\r\ncountry to the exclusive influence of one great power has always\r\nmarked a breakdown of the European balance of power. The idea of\r\nplacing these zones by means of a treaty in the position of countries\r\noutside the possible zone of international conflicts corresponds to\r\na general plan of establishing a régime of peace on the basis of\r\nreciprocal and voluntary restriction of action. From this point of\r\nview, neutralization is essentially a factor for peace. It follows that\r\nthe state which is perpetually neutral has not only its own individual\r\nmeaning and independent mission, but is an important “wheel” in the\r\ngeneral policy. This is the case with Belgium, as it was established by\r\nthe great powers after the revolt of 1830, and that is the true meaning\r\nof the statement that it was to be “perpetually neutral.”\r\n\r\nBetween the neutralized state and the creators of its neutrality there\r\nthus exist reciprocal obligations. The contracting powers between them\r\nundertake engagements whereby they guarantee to the neutralized state\r\nthe privileged condition of enjoying permanent peace; while on the\r\nother side, the neutralized state accepts the obligations which protect\r\nthe European balance of power. In that way, each of the contracting\r\npowers is bound not to attack the neutral state; not to invite it\r\nto abandon its peaceful attitude; to defend it against any power,\r\nco-contracting or not, which would compel it to abandon its neutrality.\r\nThe inviolability of the neutralized territory is agreed upon by this\r\nmeans, for violation would mean for such a state a breach of its own\r\nneutrality. On the other hand, the neutralized state must itself defend\r\nits neutrality, and adopt all the measures needed for such defense. For\r\nthis reason, international law holds that a neutralized state which\r\ncommits an act of defense is not to be considered as being in state of\r\nwar with the power which violates its neutrality.[23] Moreover, the\r\nneutral state must prevent troops or convoys of a belligerent power\r\nfrom passing through its territory.[24] Finally, such a state ought to\r\nremain a truly independent state, for if it places or allows itself to\r\nbe placed in a position of dependence upon another power it destroys\r\nthe European balance of power, the origin of its international status.\r\n\r\nSome authorities on international law[25] maintain that in case of\r\nviolation of the neutral territory by a belligerent, the contracting\r\npowers have not only the right, but the duty, to interfere _ex\r\nofficio_, and to protect the neutral state by military power, even\r\nwithout the consent of the latter. On this point, however, opinion is\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nDoes the neutral possess the right to conclude alliances with a foreign\r\npower? This question is a little more difficult to determine exactly,\r\nbut it may be settled in the following manner. Every alliance has\r\nin view the possibility of an armed conflict. It follows logically\r\nfrom this that the right of the neutral state to contract alliances\r\ncorresponds very closely to its right of making war. If it is\r\nnecessary to forbid such a state every alliance which would tend to\r\ndraw it into an armed conflict with third parties, it ought to be\r\ngranted without hesitation the right of concluding any understanding\r\nwhich should have for its sole object the protection of the nation\r\nagainst foreign aggression. And a defensive agreement tending to\r\nfacilitate for the neutral state the carrying out of the part it\r\nis compelled to play in the maintenance of the European balance of\r\npower--the very basis of its neutrality--is certainly permissible, and,\r\nunder certain circumstances, may even seem necessary; for example, when\r\nthe neutral state seems too weak to resist by its own force a possibly\r\npowerful invasion. But it is obvious that the neutral state may never\r\nconclude either an offensive or a defensive alliance which would impose\r\nupon it the obligation of possible co-operation in the defense of a\r\nforeign territory. That is the true meaning of the permanent neutrality\r\nimposed on Belgium by the Treaty of London, and it will become clearer\r\nwhen we look at the subsequent facts of history.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, on the eve of the Franco-German War, Bismarck, with the\r\nobject of alienating from France the sympathy of the neutral nations,\r\nand especially that of England, published a draft treaty, three or\r\nfour years old, and in the handwriting of Napoleon III’s ambassador,\r\nwhereby France was to annex Belgium. This publication aroused public\r\nopinion in England, and, giving expression to English feeling, Disraeli\r\ntold Parliament that “the treaties on which are based the independence\r\nand neutrality of Belgium” had been concluded _in the general interest\r\nof Europe_ and also with a very clear idea of their importance for\r\nEngland. He added: “It is a fundamental principle of the policy of\r\nthis country, that the country situated along the coasts of Dunkirk\r\nto the North Sea islands should be possessed by free and prosperous\r\nstates practising the arts of peace, in order that these countries\r\nshould not belong to a great military power.” In conformity with these\r\ndeclarations the English government proposed to France and to Prussia\r\nto observe the guaranty by way of co-operation between the English\r\nforces and the forces of one of the belligerents against the other in\r\ncase of the violation by the latter of the neutrality of Belgium. This\r\narrangement was accepted on both sides, and laid down in the formal\r\ntreaties dated August 9 and 11, 1870. Those special treaties were to be\r\nin force “during the war and for one year thereafter,” and the final\r\nparagraph expressly stated that, after this period, the regulations of\r\nthe Treaty of London (1839) should be regarded as in force.[26] This\r\ntreaty it was that was thought to protect Belgium when the country’s\r\nneutrality was violated by Germany on August 3, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENT BELGIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1832 King Leopold I married Louise-Marie, daughter of the French\r\nKing Louis-Philippe, who, through her womanly virtues, had made herself\r\ngreatly beloved. The first Queen of the Belgians died in 1850, leaving\r\nthree children: Leopold, Duke of Brabant, who afterward became King\r\nLeopold II; Philippe, Count of Flanders; and Charlotte, who married\r\nArchduke Maximilian of Austria. Under the patronage of Napoleon III,\r\nMaximilian was for some years Emperor of Mexico, and 2,000 Belgian\r\nvolunteers followed him into that country. Napoleon III abandoned him\r\nwhen political troubles broke out in Mexico, and, notwithstanding\r\nthe stubborn resistance he offered to the army of the Republicans,\r\nMaximilian fell into the hands of his enemies and was shot at Queretaro\r\nin 1867 by order of Juarez. As a result of this tragedy Empress\r\nCharlotte became insane.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the first King of the Belgians had developed the economic\r\nresources of Belgium. He was determined in his policy of maintaining\r\nthe permanent neutrality of the country, as imposed by the Treaty\r\nof London. He preserved very friendly relations with Queen Victoria\r\nof England, and the correspondence between the two sovereigns\r\nshows that the first King of the Belgians would have found in her\r\na mighty protector in the hour of trial. In a letter dated from\r\nBuckingham Palace in 1852, Queen Victoria, dealing with the fear\r\nof a _coup d’état_ on the part of “such an extraordinary man” as\r\nLouis-Napoleon--the future Napoleon III--asserted that any violation\r\nof Belgian neutrality would mean a _casus belli_ for her government.\r\n\r\nHow strongly the throne of Leopold I was established among his own\r\npeople was shown by the fact that during the Revolution of 1848, which\r\nnearly resulted in the overthrow of all the thrones of Europe, Belgium\r\nalone kept herself aloof from the European turmoil, and some French\r\nadventurers who had tried to cross the frontier and, with the help of\r\nsome unpatriotic Belgians, to proclaim a republic on Belgian soil,\r\nwere quickly disarmed in the skirmish at Risquons-Tout, near Mouscron,\r\nin West Flanders. King Leopold consistently regarded himself as a\r\nconstitutional king, and won thereby the confidence and the respect of\r\nthe nation. During his reign Belgium gave many proofs of her spirit of\r\nenterprise and economic vitality. In 1835 she constructed the first\r\nrailway that existed on the Continent, connecting Brussels and Malines.\r\nThe country likewise prepared itself for defense against foreign\r\ninvasion, and built the fortifications of Antwerp, making this city the\r\nultimate bulwark of national defense. In 1860, the octrois, a sort of\r\ncommunal customs levied upon entering Belgian towns, were abolished;\r\nand in 1863 the tolls of the Scheldt, paid to the Dutch by all vessels\r\ncoming from Antwerp, were discontinued.\r\n\r\nFrom a political point of view the old union of 1828 between Catholics\r\nand Liberals had disappeared. From 1847 the personnel of the\r\nministries was no longer composed of members of both parties, but of\r\nrepresentatives of one party only, to the exclusion of those of the\r\nother. The Liberals were in power from 1847 to 1855; the Catholics\r\nfollowed, and they in turn retired before a street riot in 1857; the\r\nLiberals again held power throughout the reign of Leopold I. The first\r\nKing of the Belgians died on December 10, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Brabant succeeded him under the name of Leopold II. Born\r\non April 9, 1835, in 1853 he married Marie-Henriette, archduchess of\r\nAustria, who died in 1902. The only son of this marriage, the Count of\r\nHainaut, died at the age of ten years, in 1869.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the young prince Leopold gave occasion to many rejoicings\r\namong the people, who were extremely happy to see the future of their\r\nnational dynasty assured. Leopold inherited from his father an acute\r\nknowledge of men and things, unusual tact, sound common sense, and\r\nrespect for his mission as a constitutional sovereign.\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 1853, when he was already Duke of Brabant (the title given\r\nto the Belgian crown prince) he was made a member of the Belgian\r\nSenate. On this occasion the King, his father, presenting him to the\r\nassembled senators, said of him: “I found in him much discretion and\r\ncommon sense, so I taught him all that is essential and useful for the\r\nconduct of political affairs.” On August 22, 1853, Leopold married\r\nHenriette, archduchess of Austria; this marriage united again the new\r\nBelgian dynasty with the heirs of Maria Theresa and Charles V.\r\n\r\nThen began for Leopold a very interesting and important period. By\r\ntouring the world and visiting foreign countries, he prepared himself\r\nfor the principal task of his royal life--to teach the Belgians how to\r\ntake up commercial and colonial expansion. For, if Leopold I especially\r\nconsolidated the young Belgian kingdom, from an interior as well as\r\nfrom an exterior point of view, King Leopold II was the pioneer of the\r\nexpansion which resulted in the commercial and industrial prosperity of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nFrom 1854 to 1855, Leopold visited successively Egypt, Palestine,\r\nGreece, Italy, and Switzerland; he met with a splendid reception at\r\nJerusalem. In 1860, he undertook a new journey in Turkey and Asia\r\nMinor. In 1862-63 he went through Spain, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, and\r\nEgypt. Finally, he spent the years 1864 and 1865 visiting India.\r\n\r\nIt is then not surprising to hear him, when, in 1855, he made his\r\nfirst speech in the Senate, saying: “We must show the Belgian flag all\r\nover the world. A young nationality must be daring and always love\r\nprogress.” He showed henceforth great interest in science and arts\r\nand public works and recommended many times the creation of Belgian\r\nnavigation lines.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 he began his great campaign for colonial expansion. He told\r\nthe Belgians they should create everywhere markets for their commerce\r\nand exchanges for their industry. In connection with this scheme, he\r\nenjoined them to make the port of Antwerp the best and greatest port\r\nof the Continent. All this was done and said before Leopold himself\r\nbecame a king. On December 17, 1865, he succeeded his father as king\r\nof the Belgians. During his reign he kept pleasant relations with all\r\nthe countries of Europe, and this friendship was sealed by the visits\r\nmany kings paid to Brussels. The Belgian capital greeted successively\r\nWilliam I of Prussia, William III and Queen Emma of the Netherlands,\r\nAlfonso XII of Spain, William II, the young German Emperor. Leopold\r\nhimself went, in 1872, to visit England and took part at a great dinner\r\nwhere the celebrated Disraeli welcomed him and spoke with much respect\r\nof the late King Leopold I, the wise man, “who was virtually a British\r\nprince.” Peace and international friendship thus favored the first\r\nyears of Leopold’s reign, when suddenly, in 1870, the Franco-German War\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned Great Britain’s interventions in order\r\nto preserve the neutrality of Belgium. But the Belgians themselves\r\ntook their part in the defense of that neutrality. On hearing of the\r\ndeclaration of war, the Belgian government ordered general mobilization\r\nof the army and sent troops to the frontiers, in order to prevent any\r\nattempt by the belligerents to use the territory. On September 1, 1870,\r\ngreat danger arose: the French, defeated at Sedan, seemed resolved to\r\ntry to escape capitulation by seeking a refuge and continuing the fight\r\non Belgian soil. But this event did not happen and the Belgian army\r\npreserved the frontiers of the country untouched.\r\n\r\nWhen peace returned, Leopold II interested himself in science and\r\ncreated, in 1874, the “Prix du Roi” for scientific research, hoping\r\nthereby, as he said himself, to stimulate the enterprises of the\r\nBelgian scientists and to have the world devote its attention to\r\nBelgian life and interests. In 1876 the King took advantage of the\r\nCongress for Eugenics held in Brussels for promoting interest in the\r\nsocial welfare of the poorer classes and for urging the construction of\r\ncheap houses for workmen.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 1876, a great event took place. The King presided\r\nat the Brussels Geographical Conference, where representatives of\r\nthe various European countries assembled. Out of this conference\r\ngrew the _Association internationale africaine_, which undertook the\r\nexploration of the Congo and the fight against the slave-drivers\r\nin Africa. As a consequence of all this, in February, 1888, the\r\nInternational Conference of Berlin took place, which created the\r\nIndependent Congo State, with the king of the Belgians as sovereign.\r\nThis state, by the will of the King, the consent of the powers, and the\r\nvote of the Belgian Parliament, became a Belgian colony in 1908.\r\n\r\nAnother great task of the King’s life, was the defense of the country.\r\nLeopold always proclaimed his faith in the treaties of 1839, but he\r\nnever neglected to advocate the reinforcement of the army and the\r\nconstruction of fortresses, in order to repel any possible invasion.\r\nIn 1885, when international peace seemed to be in danger, the King,\r\nafter a vigorous campaign, obtained a vote from Parliament, resolving\r\nto erect the fortresses of the Meuse--the forts at Liège and Namur,\r\nwhich, in 1914, stopped for some time the German advance. Things did\r\nnot always go smoothly, and the King became very unpopular with many\r\npeople, who, absolutely confident in the treaties of 1839, termed the\r\nKing’s enterprise as “militarism.” Leopold once taunted a member of the\r\nBelgian Parliament, who was opposed to the contemplated fortification,\r\nsaying: “Never go out without an umbrella, Sir!”\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the Belgians celebrated splendidly the seventy-fifth\r\nanniversary of Belgian independence. The King went all over the\r\ncountry, encouraging the feeling of patriotism which was then manifest\r\nand taking advantage of that spirit for urging the enlargement of\r\nthe works of the port of Antwerp and the construction of a circle of\r\nouter forts, which should defend the city. After a great fight, he\r\nobtained the vote from Parliament, although the proposed system of\r\nfortification was not entirely accepted by the politicians.\r\n\r\nHis last victory was the reinforcement of the Belgian army, the\r\nsuppression of the old Napoleonic system, called “le tirage au sort,”\r\nand the establishment of personal service. The bill of the new law was\r\nbrought to him to be signed on his deathbed. Before leaving this world,\r\nhe confirmed with his royal signature the law which he had finally\r\nobtained from his all-too-pacifist subjects. With a sigh of supreme\r\nsatisfaction, the great King died in December, 1909.\r\n\r\nDuring his life he had many enemies. A constitutional king, he\r\nsometimes went farther than the limits of his power, but he did it\r\nwith the greatness and the security of his country always in his mind.\r\nPoliticians more than once attacked him violently, but history will\r\navenge him, saying: “He made it possible for his country to defend\r\nitself in the hour of great trial.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT TRIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the nephew of King Leopold, Prince Albert, became king of the\r\nBelgians under the name of Albert I, he certainly never imagined that a\r\nday would come when the very existence of his country would be put at\r\nstake by the felony of one of the powers which were pledged to defend\r\nBelgian neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe first years of the new reign went on peacefully. Albert I devoted\r\nhis attention particularly to social and economic affairs, but he\r\ndid not forget the problems of Belgian’s defense. In 1912, thanks to\r\nthe efforts and the help of the Belgian Premier, Baron Charles de\r\nBrogueville, he obtained a new army bill, which considerably reinforced\r\nthe strength of the Belgian army. Two years had hardly elapsed when the\r\nGreat Trial came! On August 2, 1914, the German Minister to Brussels\r\nappeared at the Belgian Foreign Office, and presented on behalf of his\r\ngovernment a “very confidential” note, asking passage through Belgium\r\nfor the German troops on their way to France. Twelve hours were granted\r\nto the Belgian government for a reply.\r\n\r\nThe night of August 2, 1914, was a terrible night for the King and\r\nhis ministers. They had to decide upon the future, on the existence\r\nof their country. None wavered; they decided to remain loyal to their\r\npledge and to oppose to the German invaders “the force of arms.”\r\n\r\nThe Belgian army then hardly counted 115,000 men; they had no big guns,\r\nhardly any machine guns and, as a consequence of the army bill of 1912,\r\neverything was in full process of reorganization. Nevertheless, the\r\nBelgian government did not hesitate.\r\n\r\nOn August 2, at 7 o’clock in the morning, a man calmly brought to the\r\nGerman Minister at Brussels the answer to the German ultimatum: the\r\nreply was a categorical refusal to let the German army pass through\r\nBelgium. On August 4, the army of General von Emmich, some 80,000 men,\r\ntried to take the fortified position of Liège by surprise. But the\r\n30,000 Belgians of General Leman defended their hastily constructed\r\ntrenches so well that many German regiments beat a hasty retreat.\r\nPanic already prevailed in the German town of Aix-la-Chapelle, where\r\nthe news spread that the Belgians were invading German soil! However,\r\nin the midst of the confusion, a German column, under the command of\r\nLudendorff, who then won his first laurels of the war, succeeded in\r\nbreaking through the Belgian defenses. On the morning of August 7, the\r\ncity of Liège was occupied by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian troops succeeded in escaping capture and went to rejoin the\r\nBelgian field army, posted on the river Gette, covering both Brussels\r\nand Antwerp. If the city of Liège was in the enemy’s hands, the forts\r\ncontinued to resist, and it was only when the 30.5- and 42.0-centimeter\r\nguns arrived from Germany, that one after another they were shattered\r\nto bits. The fort of Loncin, where General Leman had continued to\r\nresist, exploded, and was taken on the sixteenth of August. It had\r\nstopped the advance of the First Army under von Kluck for a week.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that the army of von Kluck did not come in touch with\r\nthe Belgian field army near Louvain before August 10. The number of\r\nthe invading troops was so great and the danger of the Belgians being\r\ncut off from their Antwerp base so imminent, that King Albert decided\r\nto retire, after some combats at Haelen, Hauthem, and Aerschot, to the\r\nentrenched position of Antwerp. This happened on August 19. The flood\r\nof the invaders went over Louvain, Brussels, and then turned southward.\r\nThere, thanks to the delay procured by the resistance of Liège, stood,\r\non the Sambre, the Fifth French Army, and, on the canal from Mons to\r\nCondé, the British Expeditionary Force under Sir John French. Moreover,\r\nthe Belgian fortress of Namur, at the confluence of the Sambre and the\r\nMeuse, offered a strong _point d’appui_ for the Allied forces in the\r\nsouth of Belgium.\r\n\r\nEvents happened, however, very rapidly. Namur fell under the attack of\r\nthe Second German Army under von Bülow and the forts were destroyed by\r\nthe fire of the giant German guns. The Belgian garrison, under General\r\nMichel, partly succeeded in escaping to France on August 23. The same\r\nday, the French on the Sambre were forced back by von Bülow and von\r\nKluck maneuvering together, and the British at Mons were compelled to\r\nfall back and to begin their glorious retreat on Le Cateau.\r\n\r\nWhen the battles of the Sambre and Mons were raging, the Belgian field\r\narmy suddenly made a sortie from Antwerp, in order to menace the\r\nGermans in the rear. They had a great fight on a line between Vilvorde\r\nand Aerschot, but, having no large guns, did not succeed in breaking\r\nthrough the German observation army which covered the line from Liège\r\nto Brussels.\r\n\r\nThey made a second sortie on September 9. They succeeded in recapturing\r\nAerschot and were about to retake Louvain, when German reinforcements\r\nstopped their advance. This sortie retained in Belgium important German\r\nreinforcements, which were on their way to restore the German fortunes\r\non the Marne. The German General Staff frankly admits the importance of\r\nthis move on the part of the Belgian army.\r\n\r\nA third sortie did not succeed, for, exactly at this time (September\r\n27), the Germans began the siege of Antwerp. They wanted to put an end\r\nto these continuous threats on their rear and their communication lines\r\nwith Germany. Just as Liège and Namur fell under the fire of the 30.5-\r\nand 42.0-centimeter guns, Antwerp proved irremediably lost after two or\r\nthree days’ bombardment. The British marine fusiliers and men of the\r\nNaval Reserve, sent by Churchill with the hope of delaying the fall of\r\nthe fortress, could merely support the morale of the Belgian defenders\r\nby their presence, but that was all. On the evening of October 6\r\nthe Belgian field army, under the personal conduct of King Albert,\r\nsucceeded in leaving Antwerp without the Germans being aware of it. The\r\ncity continued to be defended by the garrison troops and the British.\r\nAfter a terrible bombardment of thirty-six hours the last defenders\r\nescaped in their turn, and on October 9 the civilian authorities\r\nsurrendered the town to General von Beseler. The Germans boasted of the\r\ngreat war spoils found in the town, but they were extremely angry to\r\nfind the city empty of troops.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian field army, meanwhile, accomplished a very dangerous but\r\nadmirably conducted retreat through Flanders, and stopped on the Yser,\r\non October 14-15. The soldiers were exhausted. They had barely taken\r\nup their position along the little river when a mighty German army,\r\ncomposed partly of some corps of von Beseler’s army, partly of fresh\r\ntroops--mostly university men, volunteers--just arrived from Germany,\r\nappeared, with the aim of breaking through in the direction of Dunkirk\r\nand Calais.\r\n\r\nDuring more than seven days, 48,000 Belgian infantrymen, “in the last\r\nstage of exhaustion”--so said Sir John French in his dispatch to the\r\nWar Office--supported by a force of not more than 6,000 French marine\r\nfusiliers defended the Yser positions against some 100,000 enemies,\r\nprovided with very heavy artillery and all the means of modern warfare.\r\nOn October 25, when at a certain point the Germans finally broke\r\nthrough, French reinforcements arrived and the Belgian General Staff\r\ndecided to flood the positions in front of the last Belgian line.\r\nThis put an end to the struggle. The troops of the Duke of Würtemberg\r\nsuffered an ignominious defeat. They never reached either Dunkirk or\r\nCalais.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were not more fortunate on the Ypres front: here the\r\nBritish of Sir John French, supported by some French troops, also held\r\ntheir line, and at the close of November, 1914, the struggle ended in\r\nthe south of Belgium and the long period of trench warfare began.\r\n\r\nExcept for that little slip of country including Dixmude, Nieuport, and\r\nYpres, Belgium was now under German occupation. Then began the “war of\r\nthe civilians.” Already during the invasion, in that fateful month of\r\nAugust, many civilians had been killed by the invading troops. Under\r\npretext that there were _francs tireurs_--which should be categorically\r\ndenied, there never being an organized “_franc-tireur_” war in\r\nBelgium--the invaders committed horrible atrocities in the region of\r\nLiège, at Aerschot, Louvain, Tamines, Andennes, Namur, Termonde, and in\r\nthe south of Luxemburg, burning a large number of houses, pillaging,\r\nand killing over 6,000 people, among them old men, women, and children.\r\nTerrorization seemed the immediate aim of this peculiar system of\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nWhen these troops had disappeared in the direction of Paris,\r\nGeneral von der Goltz was intrusted with the task of organizing the\r\nadministration of occupied Belgium. He arrived at Brussels on September\r\n1, 1914, with some 25 military and civilian officials. Belgium was\r\nnow divided into two parts: the “General Government,” including the\r\nwhole of the occupied territory, except both East and West Flanders,\r\nand the “Etappengebiet” or “army zone,” including these last two\r\nprovinces. The “General Government” was subject to the authority of\r\nthe Governor General, residing at Brussels; the “Etappengebiet” was\r\nresponsible to the army commanders. Along the coast was established\r\nthe “Marine-gebiet” or coast defense, under the command of Admiral von\r\nSchroeder, residing at Bruges. At the head of each province was put\r\na military governor, and in every district a _Kreischef_. Every town\r\nhad a local “Kommandantur.” Besides these military officials were the\r\ncivilian officials of the “Zivilverwaltung.”\r\n\r\nBetween these two elements, the military and the civilians, there did\r\nnot always exist great cordiality, and, when they did not agree, the\r\nmilitary always had the last word. Also, at Brussels, the authority of\r\nthe Governor General was sometimes handicapped by the intervention\r\nof the Quartermaster General, von Sauberzweig, representative of the\r\nGerman General Staff, and it seems beyond doubt that the excesses and\r\ncrimes committed by the German government at Brussels were frequently\r\nimposed by the military party. The murder of Edith Cavell and the\r\ndeportation of civilians to Germany and to the firing-line were\r\ncertainly acts of the military.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Belgian civilian population became now very\r\npeculiar. The Belgian government, which had left Antwerp together\r\nwith the King, had accepted the hospitality of the French government\r\nat Havre; the King and Queen were with the troops on the Yser. There\r\nremained in Belgium, as representatives of the national power, the\r\nburgomasters or mayors of the various towns, the parish priests, and\r\nthe bishops. They were to be the leaders of the oppressed population.\r\nCardinal Mercier took up the fight against the crimes, the excesses,\r\nand the illegalities of the occupying power, and the mayor of the\r\ncapital, Max, stirred the people by his patriotic and gallant attitude.\r\nThe Germans sent him to Germany for having been too outspoken in his\r\nfeelings; he remained there in confinement till the end of the war.\r\nThey did not dare to arrest Cardinal Mercier, but they tried by all\r\nmeans to silence him and to prevent his encouraging, in his pastorals\r\nand letters addressed to his flock, the sense of patriotism and the\r\nendurance of the people. The Cardinal never missed any occasion to tell\r\nthe Belgians what was their duty in the face of the invader, or to\r\nprotest against atrocities committed, or to try to prevent brutalities\r\nas, for instance, at the time of the awful deportations. The bishops\r\nof Liège and Namur also took up the same energetic attitude. In many\r\ntowns and villages the burgomasters did their duty as calmly as the\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nThanks to the attitude of their civilian and ecclesiastical leaders,\r\nthe Belgians found the necessary patience to endure the harshness, the\r\npersecutions, and the privations of the new régime. It may be said\r\nthat, generally speaking, they offered, on “the interior front,” as\r\ngood a resistance as the soldiers on the Yser front.\r\n\r\nTheir cities were occupied by German garrisons; their houses sometimes\r\nfilled with German officers or requisitioned in order to serve as\r\na German _Casino_ or _Soldatenheim_. Every month, at the local\r\n_Kommandantur_, the young men of age to bear arms, the former civic\r\nguards, etc., must present themselves. A very severe control was\r\nestablished in order to prevent the young men from escaping to Holland\r\nand rejoining the Belgian army. In order to prevent this, the Belgian\r\nfrontier to the north was provided with three lines of electrified wire\r\nand soldiers were constantly patrolling, ready to fire on those who\r\nshould succeed in cutting the wires and passing. These terrible threats\r\ndid not prevent thousands of young Belgians from facing the ordeal and\r\nfrom getting through these wires, on their way to the Belgian army on\r\nthe Yser. From Holland, they went to England, then reached France where\r\nthey were received in Belgian instruction camps and prepared for “doing\r\ntheir bit” in the Yser trenches.\r\n\r\nThe parents or relatives of these young Belgians were held responsible\r\nfor the escape of their sons and heavily fined or imprisoned. The\r\nGerman administration applied, indeed, the principle of collective\r\nresponsibility. For the fault of one individual, the whole community\r\nwas punished. So, for instance, cutting of a telephone wire, singing a\r\npatriotic song, distributing secret newspapers, all this was punished\r\nby heavy fines imposed on a whole town or village.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the German criminal or secret police, organized by Governor\r\nGeneral von Bissing, was at work, trying to get as many Belgians as\r\npossible into prison. The German military penal code was applied to\r\nBelgium for offenses termed as endangering the security of the German\r\narmy. These crimes were punished by military tribunals, where no\r\nBelgian barrister was admitted, and where people were condemned to\r\ndeath or to heavy penalties without appeal. In one year alone, 1915-16,\r\n103,092 Belgians were thus condemned by these military tribunals, and\r\n100 death penalties were pronounced, many of them being immediately\r\nexecuted. The best-known cases were those of Edith Cavell, Gabrielle\r\nPetit, Franck, Baekelmans, etc. This régime of terror did not curb the\r\ncourage of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Germans tried to create despair and dissension by spreading false\r\nnews, by announcing loudly and daily their victories, by creating\r\nGerman or Germanized papers, such as _Le Bruxellois_, by exciting the\r\nanimosity against the Allies, especially against England, by boasting\r\nthat the Belgians had been left in the lurch by their influential\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nTo counteract this poison propaganda, a secret press was created at\r\nBrussels and in many other towns. The “Libre Belgique,” organized by\r\nthe editor of the former Belgian paper _Le Patriote_, Mr. Jourdain,\r\nis the most celebrated of them. The Germans never succeeded in\r\ndiscovering the writers or the printers, but many people, suspected of\r\ntaking part in the enterprise, were fined or imprisoned or deported.\r\n\r\nThe most cunning device of the Germans was the so-called “activism.”\r\nThey knew that, before the war, a party of Flemings, called\r\n“Flamingants,” had asked for more influence of the Flemish tongue in\r\nBelgian public life and advocated the creation of a Flemish university.\r\nGovernor von Bissing tried then to sow dissension between Flemings and\r\nWalloons and to destroy the very basis of Belgian nationality itself.\r\nHe took over the program of the Flamingants and created, with the help\r\nof a few traitors, a Flemish university of Ghent. Great privileges\r\nwere attached to the matriculation at this Flemish-German university.\r\nThe scheme did not succeed. Von Bissing went farther: he introduced\r\nadministrative separation between Flanders and Wallony, and created an\r\nautonomous “Verwaltung” for Flanders at Brussels and for Wallony at\r\nNamur, with separated ministries. In this he was helped by a score of\r\ntraitors, who called themselves “activists,” and who were particularly\r\nattracted by bribes and high positions offered by the Germans. They\r\nformed a so-called “Council for Flanders,” whose members went even to\r\nvisit the German Chancellor at Berlin.\r\n\r\nA shudder of revolt passed through the country, and the great majority\r\nof the Flemings formally condemned the “activists.” The Belgian\r\nmagistrates decided to arrest the leader of the activists, Borms, who\r\ncalled himself the Flemish “Minister for War,” under the very nose of\r\nthe Germans. Borms was arrested at Brussels, but instantly liberated\r\nby his German protectors. This clearly showed the relations of the\r\n“activists” toward the enemy, but the courageous Belgian magistrates\r\nwere deported to Germany.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the Belgians was never broken, but material life was\r\nvery difficult. Owing to the requisitions of horses, cattle, fruits,\r\netc., there came a day when starvation was near. Then was founded,\r\nin October, 1914, the admirable Commission for Relief in Belgium,\r\nwith Herbert Hoover at its head, who undertook the great task of\r\nrevictualing Belgium during the occupation.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had not only requisitioned food; they also requisitioned\r\nthe very means of industrial life. According to a scheme\r\nconceived and worked out by the president of the “Allgemeine\r\nElektrizitätsgesellschaft,” Walther Rathenau, Belgium was to be\r\nstripped of all natural and manufactured products which could help the\r\nGerman army in continuing and winning the war. Coal, metals, chemical\r\nproducts, wood, wool, linen, cotton, copper, rubber, machines, machine\r\ntools, oil, transport material, horses, etc., were put under “saisie”\r\nby successive decrees of von Bissing and sent to Germany, with the help\r\nof German business men, who visited the Belgian factories and marked\r\nthe things to be requisitioned.\r\n\r\nA consequence of this was the closing of many factories and the\r\ncreation of an enormous number of forced strikers. These men, then,\r\nwere considered as idlers and, by order of the military, taken out of\r\ntheir houses and sent by whole trains, in cattle-trucks, to Germany.\r\nThere they had to work for the German army, even making munitions to\r\nkill their brethren. This was the origin of the awful deportations,\r\nwhich stirred the conscience of the civilized world. About 150,000\r\nBelgians, mostly workmen, but intellectuals, bourgeois, and even\r\nschoolboys not excepted, were either sent to Germany or to the\r\nfiring-line in France and Belgium, where they were compelled to dig\r\ntrenches, construct roads, etc. A large number of them refused flatly\r\nto work for the enemy. They were submitted in the camps to real\r\ntortures, beaten, martyrized, and scores of them died. Others were\r\nsent back, exhausted by their martyrdom, and died on arriving in their\r\nnative home.\r\n\r\nThe financial wealth of Belgium was also crippled by the heavy war\r\nlevies imposed on provinces, towns, and villages. In December, 1914,\r\nvon Bissing imposed on the Belgian provinces a collective war levy of\r\n40,000,000 francs monthly; in November, 1916, this levy had reached\r\n50,000,000 francs monthly. Von Falkenhausen, who succeeded von Bissing,\r\nraised it to 60,000,000 francs. It would be impossible to estimate\r\nexactly the total of the levies and fines imposed on Belgian towns and\r\nvillages during four years of war.\r\n\r\nFour years, indeed, this terrible thing went on. Then, suddenly, came\r\n“the day of revenge,” of which Cardinal Mercier had spoken in 1917\r\nin his letter to General von Huehne. The mighty German war machine\r\ncollapsed under the combined effort of the Allied forces. At the end of\r\nthe battle front, near the sea, was constituted the “group of armies of\r\nFlanders,” composed of French, British, Americans, and Belgians, under\r\nthe command of King Albert. In September, 1918, the great offensive\r\nbegan on the Flanders front. The German positions were taken by storm,\r\nand, after a short interruption, the drive went on again in October.\r\nSoon the Flanders coast was evacuated, and everywhere, in Belgian towns\r\nand villages, amidst cries of joy and tears, amidst Belgian flags kept\r\njealously hidden during four years, the sturdy troops of the Yser came\r\nhome again, as victors of the right over might.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November came the end: the armistice was signed and\r\nthe Germans compelled to evacuate the country which they once hoped to\r\ndominate forever. On a wonderful day in that same month, King Albert\r\nand his queen followed by his army and by British, French, and American\r\ntroops, entered Brussels and saw again rise before their eyes the tower\r\nof the historic Hôtel de Ville. The nightmare was over, Belgium was\r\nfree again. And in ages to come, the children will learn the history of\r\nthat period, during which Belgium covered itself with glory, because\r\n“it stood the test in the hour of the Great Trial.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best work to be consulted on the history of Belgium is that by\r\nH. Pirenne, professor in the University of Ghent, entitled _Histoire\r\nde Belgique_, Vols. I-IV, Brussels, 1900-1911. The work is not yet\r\ncomplete: the fourth volume carries us down to 1648. Those wishing to\r\nstudy more in detail the various problems of Belgian history will find\r\nthe enumeration of original sources and modern books in H. Pirenne,\r\n_Bibliographie de l’histoire de Belgiques_, 2d ed., Brussels, 1902.\r\nFor a list of books published since 1902 see the Belgian periodical\r\n_Archives belges_, where the important books and articles on Belgian\r\nhistory are reviewed and discussed.\r\n\r\nWorks written in English are the following: Demetrius C. Boulger, _A\r\nHistory of Belgium_, 2 vols., London, 1902-9; J. de C. MacDonnell,\r\n_Belgium, Her Kings, Kingdom and People_, London, 1914; R. C. K. Ensor,\r\n_Belgium_, New York and London [1915]. The work by Boulger is mainly\r\nbased on the old work of Théodore Juste, _Histoire de Belgique_ (new\r\nedition in 3 vols., Brussels, 1895), which is not up to date and cannot\r\nbe compared with Pirenne’s _Histoire_. The works by MacDonnell and\r\nEnsor deal especially with the contemporary history of Belgium, the\r\nformer treating Belgian politics from the Catholic point of view, the\r\nlatter being frequently ill informed and unjust toward the Catholic\r\nparty. Both have their merits in dealing with the history of Belgium\r\nin the nineteenth century. Modern Belgium has also been studied by H.\r\nCharriaut, _la Belgique moderne_, Paris, 1910. This book offers much\r\ninformation, but contains many mis-statements. For social problems, see\r\nB. Seebohm Rowntree, _Land and Labour: Lessons from Belgium_, London,\r\n1910. In French there exists an excellent survey of the most important\r\nperiods of Belgian history, written by G. Kurth, _la nationalité\r\nbelge_, Brussels, 1913.\r\n\r\nA very readable book, well written and well illustrated, based on\r\naccurate historical information, and dealing with the history of\r\nFlanders in the largest sense of the word, is the work of Edward\r\nNeville Vose, _The Spell of Flanders_, Boston, Page Co., 1915. The\r\nauthor, describing the visit he made to various Flemish towns, gives a\r\ngood account of the most striking facts of their history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbey of St. Armand, 32\r\n\r\nAbbots, of Lobbes, 33\r\n\r\nAckerman, 62\r\n\r\nAct of Union, 138\r\n\r\nActivists, 179\r\n\r\nAdorno, Antoniotto di Botta, 134\r\n\r\nAerschot, 172;

Kurth, _Notre nom national_.\r\n\r\n[2] H. Colenbrander, _De Belgische Omwenteling_.\r\n\r\n[3] I am much indebted for the drawing of the maps in the book to\r\nMr. Isidore Versluys, librarian of the Historical Seminary in the\r\nUniversity of Louvain.\r\n\r\n[4] A wide expanse of sandy soil extends from east to west almost\r\nuninterruptedly across Belgium; the eastern section of this, covering\r\nthe northeastern portions of the provinces of Antwerp and Limburg, is\r\ncalled the Campine. Cf. R. C. K. Ensor, _Belgium_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[5] The term “Walloon” comes from _Wala_, “foreigner,” the name that\r\nwas given by the Teutonic invaders to the Gallo-Romans dwelling behind\r\nthe Sylva Carbonaria. The name _Wala_ is to be connected with the\r\nterms “Welsh,” “Wales,” apparently of the same origin and given to the\r\nBritons and their country by the Anglo-Saxon invaders.\r\n\r\n[6] R. C. K. Ensor, _Belgium_, pp. 37-38.\r\n\r\n[7] By Walloon-Flanders is to be understood the southern part of the\r\ncounty, including the cities of Lille, Douai, and Béthune.\r\n\r\n[8] During the reign of Count Robert (1093), William the Conqueror,\r\nthen King of England, adopted a hostile attitude toward Flanders. As\r\na result Robert gave his daughter in marriage to the King of Denmark\r\nand, in agreement with him, planned an invasion of England. The hostile\r\nattitude of the English kings of the Norman dynasty turned the counts\r\nof Flanders to seek again the protection of France.\r\n\r\n[9] The outlet to the sea for the city of Bruges was by means of the\r\nriver Zwyn.\r\n\r\n[10] _Inferno_, XV, 4-6.\r\n\r\n[11] The priests and monks, as subject to the canon or ecclesiastical\r\nlaw, were not citizens. They were judged by their special tribunals,\r\nnot by the _échevinage_.\r\n\r\n[12] E.g., Rixensart, Baesrode, Middelkerke.\r\n\r\n[13] Count Baldwin became Emperor of Constantinople and was killed by\r\nthe Bulgarians after the battle of Adrianople (1205).\r\n\r\n[14] According to the unpublished correspondence of Alexander Farnese\r\nwhich I have studied in the state archives of Naples and Parma.
