It is an honor and privilege which makes them fortunate\r\nabove the millions of their fellow citizens at home. Commensurate with\r\ntheir privilege in being here, is the duty which is laid before them,\r\nand this duty will be performed by them as by Americans of the past,\r\neager, determined, and unyielding to the last.\r\n\r\nThe paper, written by the men in the service, should speak the thoughts\r\nof the new American Army and the American people from whom the Army has\r\nbeen drawn.

That department constitutes their \"leave zone\"\r\nfor the present. When their next leaves come around four months hence it\r\nis planned to give them a different leave zone, and to rotate such zones\r\nin future, in order to give all an equal chance to see as much of France\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nWhile the Y.M.C.A. has worked hard and perfected arrangements for\r\nsoldiers' accommodations and provided amusements at Aix-les-Baines, one\r\nof the famous watering-places in Savoy, no man is bound in any way to\r\navail himself of those accommodations and amusements if he does not so\r\ndesire. In other words, there are no strings attached to a man's leave\r\ntime, provided he does not violate the obvious rules of military\r\ndeportment. The widespread idea that there will be official or\r\nsemi-official chaperonage of men on leave by the Y.M.C.A. or other\r\norganizations is, therefore, incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Leaves Every Four Months.\r\n\r\nThe general order from Headquarters, A. E. F., on the subject of leaves\r\nis both complete and explicit. Leaves will be available for soldiers\r\nonly after four months' service in France, and will be granted to\r\nofficers and men in good standing. The plan is to give every soldier one\r\nleave of seven days every four months, excluding the time taken in\r\ntraveling to and from the place in France where he may spend his\r\nholiday. As far as practicable, special trains will be run for men on\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nA man may not save up his seven days leave with the idea of taking one\r\nof longer duration at a later date. He must take his leaves as they\r\ncome. Regular leave will not be granted within one month after return\r\nfrom sick or convalescent leave.\r\n\r\nIn principle, leaves will be granted by roster, based on length of time\r\nsince last leave or furlough; length of service in France; length of\r\nservice as a whole lot. Officers authorized to grant leaves are required\r\nto make the necessary adjustments of leave rosters so as to avoid\r\nabsence of too many non-coms, or specially qualified soldiers at any\r\ntime. Not more than ten per cent. of the soldiers of any command are to\r\nbe allowed away at the same time, nor, it is stipulated, is any\r\norganization to be crippled for lack of officers.\r\n\r\nLeave areas, as stated above, will be allotted to divisions, corps, or\r\nother units or territorial commands, and rotated as far as practicable.\r\nAllotments covering Paris, however, will be made separately from all\r\nother areas, so as to limit the number of American soldiers visiting\r\nParis on leave. For this reason the leave tickets will be of different\r\ncolor, those consigning a man to his unit's regular leave area being\r\nwhite, and those permitting a visit to Paris being pink, dividing the\r\nAmerican permissionaires into white ticket men and pink ticket men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Exceptional Cases.\r\n\r\nIn case a man has relatives in France, it is provided that he may, for\r\nthat reason or some other exceptional one, be granted leave for another\r\narea than that allotted to his unit with the stipulation that the number\r\nof men authorized to visit Paris shall not be increased in that way. For\r\nthe present, officers will not be restricted as to points to be visited\r\non leave, other than Paris. Any leaves which may be granted by\r\nHeadquarters to go to allied or neutral countries will be counted as\r\nbeginning on leaving France and terminating on arrival back in France.\r\nThe French Zone of the Armies, and the departments of Doubs, Jura, Ain,\r\nHaute-Savoie, Seine Inferieure and Pyrenees Orientales, and the\r\narrondissements of Basses-Pyrenees touching on the Spanish frontier may\r\nnot, however, be visited without the concurrence of the Chief French\r\nMilitary Mission.\r\n\r\nLeave papers will specify the date of departure and the number of days'\r\nleave authorized. The leave will begin to run at 12.01 a. m. (night)\r\nfollowing the man's arrival at the destination authorized in his leave\r\npapers, and will end at midnight after the passing of the number of\r\ndays' leave granted him. After that, the next leave train must be taken\r\nby that man back to his unit. Or if he is not near a railroad line over\r\nwhich leave trains pass, he must take the quickest available\r\ntransportation back to connect with a leave train. Each man on leave\r\nwill carry his ticket as well as the identity card prescribed in G. O.\r\n63, A. E. F.; and he will be required to wear his identification tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Travel Regulations.\r\n\r\nBefore going on leave, a man must register his address, in his own\r\nhandwriting. He must satisfy his company or detachment commander that he\r\nis neat and tidy in appearance. He must prove to that officer's\r\nsatisfaction that he has the required leave ticket, and so forth, and\r\nsufficient funds for the trip.\r\n\r\nAll travel on leave by men of units situated within the French Zone of\r\nthe Armies will, as far as possible, be on the special leave trains.\r\nTransportation on these trains will be furnished by the Government, and\r\nrations will be provided for both going and returning journeys.\r\nCommutation and rations while on leave will not be paid in any case.\r\nTravel on regular trains will be at the expense of the officer or\r\nsoldier so traveling, at one-fourth the regular rate. Commissioned\r\nofficers and army nurses will be entitled to first class, field clerks\r\nand non-commissioned officers to second class, and all others to third\r\nclass accommodations on regular trains.\r\n\r\nExcept on special leave trains, soldiers will be allowed to purchase\r\nsecond-class seats, but if a shortage of such seats should occur, they\r\nwill not displace regular passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Lodgings In Leave Zone\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at destination, all men will have their leave papers\r\nstamped with the date of arrival, and will have noted on them the date\r\nand hour of the train to be taken on expiration of their leave, by the\r\nAmerican Provost Marshal at the railroad station, or by the French\r\nrailroad officials. They will report to the Provost Marshal for\r\ninformation, for the looking over of leave papers, and for the selection\r\nof an assignment to lodgings and registry of address. If there is no\r\nProvost Marshal in the place to which they go, they will register their\r\naddresses and submit their leave papers for O. K.ing at the French\r\nBureau de la Place of a garrisoned town, or else at the Gendarmerie, or\r\npolice station. They will exhibit their leave papers to the French\r\nauthorities at any time upon request.\r\n\r\nLodgings will be paid for in advance. If they prove unsatisfactory, a\r\nman may apply to the Provost Marshal for a change. Men who are unable to\r\npay, or who commit any serious breach of discipline, will be promptly\r\nreturned to their units. Misconduct will be reported by American Provost\r\nMarshals direct to the man's regimental or other Commander for\r\ndisciplinary action--and for consideration at the next turn of leave.\r\n\r\nIn case of groups of men on leave traveling, the senior non-commissioned\r\nofficer will be responsible for the conduct of the men. No liquor and no\r\nfire-arms or explosives of any sort may be carried by any soldier going\r\nto or returning from leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                      OFF FOR THE TRENCHES.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a certain regiment of American doughboys departed from its billets\r\nin a little town back of the front and marched away to our trenches in\r\nLorraine, this poem was found tacked up on a billet door:--\r\n\r\n    By the rifle on my back,\r\n      By my old and well-worn pack,\r\n    By the bayonets we sharpened in the billets down below,\r\n      When we're holding to a sector,\r\n    By the howling, jumping hector,\r\n      Colonel, we'll be Gott-Strafed if the Blank-teenth lets it go.\r\n\r\n    And the Boches big and small,\r\n      Runty ones and Boches tall,\r\n    Won't keep your boys a-squatting in the ditches very long;\r\n      For we'll soon be busting through, sir,\r\n    God help Fritzie when we do, sir--\r\n      Let's get going, Colonel Blank, because we're feeling mighty strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                       TOOTH YANKING CAR\r\n                         IS TOURING FRANCE\r\n                              ----\r\n                    Red Cross Dentist's Office\r\n                              ----\r\n                      Lacks Nothing but the\r\n                          Lady Assistant\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest American atrocity--a dentist's office on wheels!\r\n\r\nGwan, you say? Gwan, yourself! We've seen it; most of the chauffeurs\r\nhave seen it; the Colonel and everybody else who gets about at all has\r\nseen it. That's what it is, a portable dentist's office--chair,\r\nwall-buzzer and all, with meat-axes, bung-starters, pinwheels,\r\nspittoons, gobs of cotton batting, tear gas, laughing gas, chloroform,\r\nether, _eau de vie_, gold, platinum and cement to match. Everything is\r\nthere but the lady assistant, and even she may be added in time.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to be funny about the thing, you might call this motorized\r\ndentist's parlor the crowning achievement of the Red Cross; for, strange\r\nto say, it is the Red Cross, commonly supposed to be on the job of\r\nalleviating human misery, that has put the movable torture chamber on\r\nthe road, to play one-tooth stands all along the countryside. But no one\r\nwants to be funny about a dentist's office that, instead of lying in\r\nwait for you, comes out on the road and chases you. It's too darn\r\nserious a matter; you might almost say that it flies in the teeth of all\r\nthe conventions, Hague and otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt looks part like an ambulance, but it isn't. An ambulance carries you\r\nsomewhere so that you can get some rest; a traveling tooth-yankery\r\ndoesn't give you a chance to rest. It's white, is the outside of the\r\ncar, just like a baby's hearse, and just about as cheerful to\r\ncontemplate. On its side it says, \"Dental Traveling Ambulance No.\r\n1\"--the No. 1 part gleefully promising, no doubt, that this isn't the\r\nend of them by any means, but that there may be more to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Useful As a Tank?\r\n\r\nSomebody had a nerve to invent it, all right, as if we didn't have\r\ntroubles enough as it is, dodging the regimental dentist, and ducking\r\nshells, and clapping on gas masks, and all the rest. It is designed,\r\naccording to one who professes to know about it, to kill the nerves of\r\nanything that gets in front of it; so we one and all move that it,\r\ninstead of the tanks, be sent \"over the top\" and tried on the Boches.\r\nThe minute they see a fully-lighted, white-painted car, with the\r\ndentist, arrayed with all his instruments of maltreatment, standing\r\nready for action by his electric chair, those Boches will just turn\r\naround and run, and run, and run, and won't stop running till they get\r\nsmack up against their own old barbed wire on the Eastern front. The\r\ncrowned heads of Europe tremble before the advance of the crowned teeth\r\nof America, as you might say if you were inclined to joke about it;\r\nwhich we aren't.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    For French Patients First\r\n\r\nOne of the Red Cross people, who was standing by ready for the command\r\n\"Clear guns for action!\" told THE STARS AND STRIPES that the peripatetic\r\npain producer wasn't to be used so much for the American troops'\r\ndiscomfort as to fix up the cavities and what-not of the civil\r\npopulation of France. That was encouraging news, for while we don't bear\r\nour allies any ill-will, we think they ought to have the honor of trying\r\nout the experiment first \"_Apres vous, mon chere Gaston,_\" as the saying\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\nAfter all the French people in need of dental treatment have been\r\ntreated, however, the Red Cross person went on to say that it might be\r\ntried out on the Americans--yanks for the Yanks, as you might say, if\r\nyou were inclined to be funny about it, as you ought not to be; but we\r\nprefer to think that the war will be over by that time. Anyhow, who ever\r\nheard of an American who would own up to having anything the matter with\r\nhis jaw.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, when you see the cussed thing on the road, jump into\r\nthe ditch and lie low. It's real, and it means business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     ANZAC MAKES SAFE GUESS.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nA company commander received an order from battalion headquarters to\r\nsend in a return giving the number of dead Huns in the front of his\r\nsector of trench. He sent in the number as 2,001.\r\n\r\nH. Q. rung up and asked him how he arrived at this unusual figure.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he replied. \"I'm certain about the one, because I counted him\r\nmyself. He's hanging on the wire just in front of me. I estimated the\r\n2000. I worked it out all by myself in my own head that it was healthier\r\nto estimate 'em than to walk about in No Man's Land and count\r\n'em!\"--_Aussie_, the Australian Soldiers' Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                       HUNS STARVE\r\n                         AND RIDICULE\r\n                           U.S. CAPTIVES\r\n                              ----\r\n                    A.E.F.

The deposition of M. L. Rollett, a repatriated Frenchman\r\nwho was quartered in the same town with the American prisoners, made\r\nbefore First Secretary Arthur Hugh Frazier of the United States Embassy\r\nin Paris, throws ample light on the methods of the Boche dealing with\r\nhis captives.\r\n\r\n\"How were the Americans treated?\" M. Rollett was asked.\r\n\r\n\"They were obliged to clean the streets, and the latrines of the Crown\r\nPrince [The heir to the German throne had his headquarters at that time\r\nin Charleville, the captured French town to which the Americans were\r\ntaken.] This was done in order to make them appear ridiculous. They were\r\nphotographed standing between six negroes from Martinique; and when the\r\nphotograph was taken the negroes were ordered to wear tall hats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the Americans have sufficient food?\" Secretary Frazier inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied M. Rollett. \"Their food was insufficient. They received a\r\nloaf of bread every five days, which was as hard as leather and almost\r\nuneatable. Occasionally they received a few dried vegetables.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Fed by French People.\r\n\r\n\"Could they subsist on this food?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but the inhabitants of Charleville formed a little committee to\r\nsupply the prisoners with food and with linen. The food had to be given\r\nto them clandestinely.\"\r\n\r\nM. Rollett, who left Charleville on December 19, 1917, to come into\r\nFrance by way of Switzerland, visited the Embassy to forward to the\r\nrelatives of the three American prisoners messages saying that they were\r\nstill alive. The addresses they gave him were: Mrs. James Mulhull, 177\r\nFifth street, Jersey City, N. J.; Mrs. R. L. Dougal, 822 East First\r\nstreet, Maryville, Miss.; and Mrs. O. M. Haines, Wood Ward, Oklahoma. On\r\nthe day the Americans were captured, he added, the American communique\r\n(published later on by the Germans) had reported five men killed and\r\nseven wounded.\r\n\r\n\"How did you bring these addresses away without being discovered?\" the\r\nEmbassy Secretary asked M. Rollett.\r\n\r\n\"They were written,\" he replied, \"on a piece of linen which a young girl\r\nwho speaks English had sewed under the lining of a cloak belonging to\r\none of my daughters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \"Black Misery\" In Germany.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, M. Rollett was asked if, from his journey from\r\nCharleville through Germany to Switzerland, he could form any idea as to\r\nconditions in Germany.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, \"because we traveled through Alsace-Lorraine at\r\nnight; but the German soldiers talked very freely about conditions in\r\nGermany, and they said that life in all parts of the Empire is black\r\nmisery. They all long for peace; and the soldiers are in dread of the\r\nBritish and French heavy artillery.\"\r\n\r\nM. Rollett's disposition was subscribed and sworn to before Secretary\r\nFrazier on January 9, 1918, and a copy of it is in the archives of the\r\nAmerican Embassy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                    MARINES ADVISE SWIGGING.\r\n                              ----\r\n                For Hikers They Say, It Is Better\r\n                          Than Sipping.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantico, Va.--The drinking of water at frequent intervals while on long\r\nhikes is not recommended by U.

On the contrary, the men\r\nwho drank their fill every two or three hours, and not between times,\r\nproved to be the best hikers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                      FREE SEEDS FOR\r\n                          SOLDIER FARMERS\r\n                              ----\r\n                    Congress Votes Us Packets\r\n                          but Overlooks\r\n                         Hoes and Spades\r\n                              ----\r\n                    PRIZES FOR BIG PUMPKINS\r\n                              ----\r\n              A.E.F.

So, if you\r\nhaven't received your little package of bean seed, pea seed, anise seed,\r\ntomato seed, lettuce seed, pansy seed, begonia seed, and what not, trot\r\nright up to the supply sergeant's diggings and ask him when it's coming\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Oui, Oui--Spuds and Beans!\r\n\r\nNo kidding; you know yourself you're grumbling now because all you get\r\nin the line of vegetables is spuds, and beans, and tomatoes and beans,\r\nand spuds, and spuds, and beans, and beans, and spuds and beans, and\r\nbeans, and beans, and beans, and beans, and beans and--what was that\r\nother vegetable you gave us last night, Mess-Sergeant?--oh, yes, beans;\r\nall of them canned, with now and then, on Christmas, St. Patrick's Day,\r\nYom Kippur and Hallowe'en, a few grains of canned corn. If you want\r\nfresh vegetables, therefore, it's up to you to grow them. Unfortunate\r\npeople who live in big cities are able to grow them in cute little\r\nwindow boxes, and thus cut down the high cost of living. Why shouldn't\r\nyou, with a steel helmet for a flower pot, be able to do the same?\r\n\r\nGo to the French thou sluggard doughboy. Consider their ways. Get wise.\r\n\r\nThey're hard up for food, as you know; and at that, to judge from the\r\nreports from back home, they're no blooming curiosities. But look at\r\nwhat they do about it. Instead of folding their hands, saying, \"C'est la\r\nguerre,\" they go out and dig, and then plant, and then hoe, and finally\r\nthey have fresh vegetables--and backaches--to show for it. You can't go\r\nanywhere along the roadsides or up the hillsides these days without\r\nstumbling over their neat and well-kept-up little garden patches. And,\r\nwith butter selling at what it is, and eggs selling for what they do,\r\nand everything else in the eats line skybooting in price, those little\r\ngarden patches come in mighty handy. It's worth trying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   No Favors for Lemon Squads\r\n\r\nAlthough no official announcement has been made as yet, it is safe to\r\nsurmise that some company commanders will offer prizes for the squads\r\nproducing the biggest pumpkins, the best summer squashes, and the most\r\nluscious watermelons. (Texas troops please heed.) Company commanders,\r\nyou know, have never been in the habit of awarding prizes for the squads\r\nproducing the most lemons, but, then, war changes every thing.\r\n\r\nSo keep your old campaign list for garden wear (if the Q.M. will let\r\nyou); make a pair of overalls out of the burlap the meat comes done up\r\nin; use your trench pick and shovel, plus your bayonet, to do the\r\nplowing, and scatter the tender seedlets. If a few acorns come along\r\nwith the rest of the plantables, plant them, too, for if we're going to\r\nbe over here a good long time the shade from these oaks will come in\r\nmighty handy when we're old men and have time to sit down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     ARMY MEN BUILD AN\r\n                       OVER-SEAS PITTSBURGH\r\n                              ----\r\n           Mammoth Warehouses and the World's Largest\r\n                Cold Storage Plant Spring Up in\r\n                          Three Months.\r\n                              ----\r\n            FORESTERS AND ENGINEERS DOING THE WORK.\r\n                              ----\r\n     \"Winter of Our Discontent\" Sees Big Job of Preparation\r\n                 Speeded \"Somewhere\" in France.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Infantryman, out there for heaven knows how many hours a day\r\njabbing at a straw-filled burlap bag and pretending it's old Rat-Face,\r\nthe Crown Prince--been doing that ever since you came over here, haven't\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Artilleryman, loading, unloading, standing clear, and all the\r\nrest of it until your back aches and your ear-drums wellnigh cave in--\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Machine-Gunner, going out every day and lugging about a ton of\r\nassorted hardware and cutlery around a vacant lot--\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Marine, land-logged, land-sick, trying out your web feet in\r\nwading through the muddy depths of Europe instead of wading ashore\r\nthrough the roaring surr-yip! hi-ho, and a bottla grape juice!--\r\n\r\nYou, all of you, own up now! Doesn't seem as though you weren't getting\r\nanywhere at times, now does it? Doesn't seem as though you had made any\r\nparticular progress, eh, what? Doesn't seem to have made the beef any\r\ntenderer, the supplies come up any quicker, the Q.M.'s clothing get\r\nissued any quicker? As far as you can see, things have been pretty much\r\nat a standstill, on account of the weather and what-not, for some time,\r\nhaven't they?\r\n\r\n\r\n                      With Speed and Drive.\r\n\r\nBut that, Mr. Infantryman, Cannoneer, Machine-Gunner or whoever and\r\nwhatever you are, is where you are, for one, dead wrong. The old U. S.\r\nis making all sorts of progress here in France--progress towards your\r\ncomfort, and upkeep, and safety, and toward that of the millions who are\r\ncoming along to play your game with you. Not in your particular section,\r\nperhaps, but, in a certain spot in inland France, the old U. S. has been\r\nengaged in big doings this winter, doing big things as only Americans\r\ncan do 'em and putting them through with the speed and drive that, as we\r\nlike to think, only the Yanks can put into an undertaking. And the work\r\nwhich the old U. S. has been doing at that particular place in France,\r\nhas excited the outspoken admiration and surprise of every officer of\r\nthe Allied armies who has watched it grow.\r\n\r\nIn three months this spot in France has been transformed from an\r\ninsignificant railroad station--such as White River Junction, New\r\nHampshire, or Princeton Junction, in New Jersey, say--surrounded by wild\r\nwoodland and rolling plains, into a regular young Pittsburgh of\r\nindustry. Fact! Not only a young Pittsburgh of industry, but a young St.\r\nLouis of railway tracks, a young Chicago of meat refrigerators, a young\r\nBoston of bean stowawayeries, a young New York water front of\r\nwarehouses. Just for example, the warehouses already put up at this\r\nplace will hold more stuff than the new Pennsylvania Railroad freight\r\nterminal in Chicago, which is some monster of its kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Cold Storage Plants.\r\n\r\nWait! That's only a sample. The foundations are already on the ground\r\nfor--now, get this; it's straight dope, no bull--for what will be the\r\nlargest refrigerating cold storage plant in the world. Its construction,\r\nby the time this article sees the light of print, will be well under\r\nway. It will have a manufacturing capacity of 500 tons of ice, and will\r\nbe capable of handling 2,000 tons of fresh beef daily, besides having\r\nstorage space for 5,000 tons of beef additional, to say nothing of other\r\nfresh food supplies whenever they may be awaiting shipment up forward to\r\nthe men in the Amexforce. Every detail of it is absodarnlutely the last\r\nword in uptodateness.\r\n\r\nAlong with a refrigerating plant of that magnitude, there have also been\r\ngoing up--going up all during the time you thought there was \"nothing\r\ndoing\" over here, too--a number of monster storage houses for ammunition\r\nand other inflammable supplies. These are built of real old\r\nhonest-to-goodness hollow fireproof brick, brought all the way from the\r\nUnited States. And if that were not enough to safeguard the bonbons for\r\nthe Boche contained in them, the storage depot has a waterworks system\r\nall its own; to construct it, a pipe line had to be laid half a\r\nmile--the distance of the plant from the nearest body of water. Hundreds\r\nof miles of auxiliary piping have already been laid, and the water\r\nsupply will be more than adequate for mechanical purposes and for\r\nprotection against fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Regulars Lend a Hand.\r\n\r\nThe warehouses themselves are one story buildings, 50 by 30 feet in\r\ndimension, constructed in rows of fours, with loading and unloading\r\ntracks between them and with big doors in their sides, making easy the\r\nquick handling of the supplies to be stowed therein. Goods for four\r\nbranches of the service are to be stored in them--machinery, ordinance\r\nsupplies, medical necessaries, and all the varied articles handled by\r\nthe Quartermaster's Corps. The construction of the buildings has been in\r\nthe hands of a regiment of railroad engineers and a forestry regiment,\r\nassisted by companies detailed from regular regiments.\r\n\r\nAs if that were not enough in the line of construction, over in a corner\r\nof the mammoth reservation is a gas plant, and buster, too. This plant\r\nis already in operation and other plants of like size are busy in\r\nrepairing machinery and in other work. Everywhere about the place there\r\nis incessant activity--regular \"Hurry up Yost\" speed-upativeness--in\r\nroad building, well driving (some deep ones have been plugged down,\r\ntoo), in track laying, in hundreds of other ways.\r\n\r\nSome plant, isn't it, to have been put up in the short time,\r\ncomparatively, that we have been over here in France? It even puts into\r\nthe shade the overnight growth of, say Hopewell, Va., the famous\r\nmunitions city that, unlike Rome, seemed almost to have been built in a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOf course it has taken a tremendous force of workers to do all this, and\r\nit is going to take more and more and more as time goes on, and as more\r\nand more and more troops from the States keep pouring into the French\r\nseaports. The size of the plant, with the provisions for making it\r\nlarger, prove, for one thing, that our Uncle Sam expects to send a lot\r\nmore troops--and, what is more, intends to keep them well supplied with\r\neverything they need as long as they are here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    No Delay About Moving In.\r\n\r\nOur Uncle Samuel, be it remembered, is a cautious old gent, and looks\r\nwell on both sides before getting into a scrap; but once he gets in--and\r\nthe canny old customer always picks the right side--he's in to stay\r\nuntil the whole job is cleaned up, and he's in right up to his\r\nshoulderblades. No more convincing proof of America's determination to\r\nsee the thing through could be had than a sight of Uncle Sam's big\r\nstorage depot and all-around tool shop. And, to clinch the argument even\r\nfurther, as fast as the shops on the big reservation have been put up,\r\nthe machinery has been shoved into them and the work in them started as\r\nsoon as the machinery was in place and oiled up.\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. Infantryman, Mr. Artilleryman, Mr. Machine-Gun-toter,\r\nMr. Aviator, Mr. Wireless-buzzer, this has not been \"the winter of our\r\ndiscontent\"--as footless and no-use-at-all as your own work may have\r\nseemed to you sometimes.

He has\r\ngone into it feet first. He knows the importance of the automobile game\r\nin modern warfare; he realizes that if Napoleon the Great had only had\r\none \"Henry\" at the battle of Waterloo, Marshal Blucher's famous advance\r\nthrough the mud would have been in vain. So he is determined, by aid of\r\nall the up-to-date motors, all the up-to-date mechanics and chauffeurs\r\nand technical experts he can muster, to prevent any of Marshal Blucher's\r\nPrussian successors from stealing a march on him.\r\n\r\nFifty thousand motor vehicles, roughly speaking, represent Uncle\r\nSamuel's immediate needs for his charges in France. Of these, some\r\n38,000 will be trucks, some 2,500 ambulances, some 3,000 \"plain darn\r\nautos,\" and some 6,500 motorcycles. To take care of this vast motor\r\nfleet, to run it, keep it in repair, and so forth, our Uncle will need\r\nabout 150,000 men--a young army in itself.\r\n\r\nWhen one stops to consider the factories, repair shops, rebuilding\r\nstations and what not that will be required, one can see that Uncle\r\nSam's garage is going to be no five-and-ten affair. It is going to be a\r\nreal infant industry all by its lonesome; and already it is a pretty\r\nhusky infant, with a loud honk-honk instead of a teething cry. In fact,\r\nin the few months since our collective arrival in France Uncle Sam has\r\nbuilt up such an organization to keep his cars on the roads as to\r\nstagger the imagination of the men of big business, both of our own\r\ncountry and of our allies who have come to look it over.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     These Are Real Experts\r\n\r\nThe A. E. F.--and this is news to many of its members--has, right here\r\nin France, a fully equipped automobile factory which is able not only to\r\nrebuild from the ground up any of a dozen or more makes of motors, but\r\nto turn out parts, tools, anything required from the vast stores of raw\r\nmaterials which has been shipped overseas for the purpose, with the\r\nspecial machinery which has been torn up in the States and replanted\r\nhere. The factory is going to employ thousands of expert mechanics, and\r\nis going to have a capacity for general repair work unequalled by any\r\nsimilar plant back home.\r\n\r\nPeople who dwell within the desolate region bounded by the Rhine on the\r\nwest and the Russian frontier on the east have been in the habit of\r\nconsidering our national Uncle as a superficial sort of an old geezer;\r\nbut the way he has taken hold of his automobile business proves that\r\nthey have another good think coming. He hasn't overlooked a thing. Hard\r\nby his big new factory there is an \"organization ground,\" a \"salvage\r\nground,\" a supply depot, and what is perhaps most important of all, the\r\nheadquarters of a highly trained technical staff.\r\n\r\nThis is a staff of experts; not self-styled experts, but the real\r\nthing--big men in the automobile business representing all the important\r\nmotor factories in the United States. Some of these experts inspect the\r\nbroken down machines and pieces of machines in the salvage grounds, and\r\nreport whether the wearing out process was due to a chauffeur's\r\nmishandling of the car, to the use of poor material in its construction,\r\nor to something wrong in its original designing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Working \"On the Ground\"\r\n\r\nIf it is the chauffeur or mechanic who was responsible, he, wherever he\r\nis, is hauled up on the carpet. If the fault is found to lie with the\r\nfactory in the States that turned out the machine, the representative of\r\nthat company on the board of experts reports the facts to the home\r\noffice himself, with recommendations for future betterment. In making\r\nout his recommendations for a car of a new design, peculiarly fitted to\r\ntraffic and combat conditions in France, his co-workers on the board\r\nlend him their assistance. In this way defects in cars are detected \"on\r\nthe ground\" and the responsibility placed at once, so that future errors\r\nof the same sort will be avoided.\r\n\r\nThis is, in brief, the journey that lies before an American made auto\r\nshipper, say \"F.O.B. Detroit.\" Knocked down, or unassembled, it is\r\npacked and put aboard a transport at \"an American port.\" It makes the\r\nsame voyage that we all made to \"a French port,\" gracefully thumbing its\r\nnose at any passing submarines. At the port it is assembled, painted,\r\nduly catalogued and numbered, and given a severe once-over and several\r\nfinishing touches by the experts of the technical staff and their\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      For Emergency Calls\r\n\r\nHaving passed this examination, it is loaded with supplies--for even a\r\ncar has to carry a pack while traveling--and headed towards the interior\r\nunder charge of a picked crew of mechanics, who try it out under actual\r\ntraffic conditions and adjust it. On the way it is held over at the\r\n\"organization grounds,\" where it is given its supplementary equipment of\r\ntools, water cask, and the necessary picks, shovels and tow cables to\r\nget it out of the mud. This done, it is turned over to a new crew of\r\nmen, and, as one of the component parts of a train of cars in charge of\r\na truck company, it is sent \"up front\" if the need is urgent, or, in\r\ncase there are cars aplenty in that interesting locality, it is run to a\r\nreserve station to await call.\r\n\r\nWhen the car, after days or months at the front, begins to show, by its\r\ncoughing or wheezing or other signs, that it is about due for a new\r\nlease of life, the journey is reversed. If the car is able to get back\r\nunder its own power, it goes back that way; if it is not, a hurry call\r\nis sent for the auto-doctoring-train, which is nothing more nor less\r\nthan a repair shop on wheels. There the blue-jeaned doctors of the train\r\ndo their best for the car, and if it doesn't come around in a day or so,\r\nit is towed back to be overhauled from A to Izzard.\r\n\r\nFor the supplying of this auto armada, Uncle Sam, who seems to have\r\noverlooked nothing, has dotted the main routes from the Atlantic coast\r\nof France up to the fighting lines with gasoline stations. At the ports\r\nof entry themselves he has erected immense storage tanks, each capable\r\nof holding 25,000 barrels of the precious juice. At a number of inland\r\nbases on the way up are other tanks with a capacity of 5,000 gallons\r\neach. Near the front are many smaller tanks, while at the front itself\r\nthe regular gas drums, small in size and readily transported, are\r\navailable for the cars that have run out.\r\n\r\nJust to make sure, Uncle Sam has brought over a flying squadron of some\r\nfive hundred tank cars, which again has caused the natives to sit up and\r\ntake notice. These cars are loaded from the tank ships at the ports of\r\nentry, and then sent inland to fill up the various depots. All in all,\r\nthis same Uncle Sam who, by the way, is now supplying his allies with\r\npractically all their gasoline and lubricants, is doing a pretty good\r\nand speedy job as a distributing agent.\r\n\r\nOne more sample of how this lean and canny old unk of ours uses his\r\nhead, and this story will be over. All the motor trucks are being\r\ndistributed about France in definite areas, according to their make; for\r\nexample, a certain area will be served by Packard trucks exclusively,\r\nwhile another will have G.M.C.'s, and G.M.C.'s only. This system does\r\naway with the need for repair men carrying many kinds of parts, and\r\nmakes it possible for one trouble-expert knowing all about one kind of\r\ncar, to serve a whole district. In that way harmony of operation and\r\nspeed in mending broken-down cars is secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     THE SUPREME SACRIFICE.\r\n                              ----\r\n        (Corset makers all over the United States are\r\n        forsaking that line of business in order to devote\r\n        their factories to the turning out of gas\r\n        masks for the Army.--News item from the States.)\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n    Heaven bless the women!

Stamped upon the face of\r\nthe envelope were the fatal words \"Examined by Base Censor.\" And the\r\nwords, because of the gloom they brought the young man, were properly\r\nframed within a deep black border.\r\n\r\nIt was this way: The young man in question had been carrying on, for\r\nsome time, a more or less hectic correspondence with a _mademoiselle\r\ntres charmante_ in a not far distant town. That in itself would be\r\nharmless enough if he had sent his letters through the regular military\r\nchannels--that is, submitted them to his own company officers to be\r\ncensored. But dreading the \"kidding\" he might receive at the hands of\r\nhis platoon commander--which he needn't have dreaded at all, for\r\nAmerican officers are gentlemen and gentlemen respect confidence--he had\r\nbeen using the French postal service for his intimate and clandestine\r\nlovemaking. That, as everyone knows or ought to know, is strictly\r\nforbidden but the young man being \"wise,\" thought he could put one over\r\non the army. Result: That much dreaded bogey-man, the Base Censor knew\r\njust how many crosses he had made at the bottom of his note to Mlle. X.\r\n\r\nBut he needn't have worried a bit, for the bogey-man isn't a likely\r\nrival of any one. In fact, he isn't a man at all, but a System--just as\r\nimpersonal as if he wrote his name, \"Base Censor, Inc.\" Also, he is\r\npretty well-nigh fool-proof and puncture-proof--which again removes him\r\nfrom consideration as \"a human.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Remembers No Secrets\r\n\r\nAll delusions to the contrary, the censorship, though it learns an awful\r\nlot, doesn't care a tinker's hoot about nine-tenths of the stuff it\r\nlearns. It isn't concerned with Private Jones's morals, with Corporal\r\nBrown's unpaid grocery bills, with Sergeant Smith's mother-in-law, with\r\nLieutenant Johnson's fraternity symbols. It is, however, actively\r\nconcerned in keeping out of correspondence all matters relating to the\r\nlocation and movement of troops, all items which pieced together might\r\nfurnish the common enemy with information which would be valuable to him\r\nin the conduct of his nefarious enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn addition to keeping such damaging information out of soldiers' and\r\nofficers' correspondence, the base censorship is lying in wait for\r\neverything and anything in the mail line which the senders hope to slip\r\nthrough uncensored. It regularly goes over a large proportion of the\r\nmail which has already been vised by company officers. It sifts through\r\nall mail for the army from neutral countries; and finally it censors all\r\nletters in foreign languages, written by men in the A. E. F.--letters\r\nwhich company officers are forbidden to O. K.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of this last-named function lies perhaps the greatest\r\ntask allotted to the base censorship. Our army is probably the most\r\n\"international\" in history, and it sends letters to the base written in\r\nforty-six different languages, excluding English. Out of 600 such\r\nletters--a typical day's grist--the chances are but half will be written\r\nin Italian, followed in the order of their numerousness, by those\r\ninscribed in Polish, French and Scandinavian. The censor's staff handles\r\nmail couched in twenty-five European languages, many tongues and\r\ndialects of the Balkan States and a scattering few in Yiddish, Chinese,\r\nJapanese, Hindu, Tahitian, Hawaiian, Persian and Greek, to say nothing\r\nof a number in Philippine dialects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A Few Are in German\r\n\r\nAn interesting by-product of the censors' work is the discovery of\r\nforeign language interpreters within the ranks of the army. One soldier,\r\nfor example, wrote in Turkish and wrote so well that the censor handling\r\nthe letters in that tangled tongue passed on his name to those higher\r\nup. As a result, the man was detailed to the interpreters' corps where\r\nhe is now serving his adopted country ably and well.\r\n\r\nSeldom, say the members of the censor's staff, is anything forbidden\r\nfound in the foreign language letters. The only striking feature about\r\nthem as a whole is the small number that are written in German. In fact\r\nthe Chinese letters as a rule outnumber those expressed in the language\r\nof the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nBesides all this thousands of letters are sent direct to the base\r\ncensors every day, in cases where soldiers are unwilling that their own\r\nimmediate superiors should become acquainted with the contents. To\r\nhumor, therefore, the enlisted man in a former National Guard unit whose\r\ncensoring officer he suspects of trying to cut him out with The Girl\r\nBack Home, the base censor takes the responsibility off the company\r\nofficer's shoulders; and the enlisted man feels oh! so much relieved.\r\n\r\nThose clever chaps who devise all sorts of codes to tell the home folks\r\njust where they are in France, meet short shrift at the censor's hands.\r\nFor example, one of them was anxious to describe a certain city in this\r\nfair land. \"You know grandmother's first name,\" he wrote naively,\r\nthinking it would get by. But the particular censor it came before,\r\nhaving a New England grandmother of his own, promptly sent the letter\r\nback with the added comment, \"Yes, and so do I! Can it!\"\r\n\r\nAnother man was so bold as to write: \"The name of the town where I am\r\nlocated is the same as that of the dance hall on Umptumpus avenue\r\nin ----\" well, a certain well-known American city. He was also caught up;\r\nfor the censor, being himself somewhat of a man of the world, shot the\r\nletter back with the tart comment: \"I've been there, too.\"\r\n\r\nThose two men, however, were more fortunate than the average in having\r\ntheir letters sent back to them for revision. The usual scheme is for\r\nthe censor to clip out completely the portion of the letter carrying the\r\ndamaging information. In case, therefore, a man has written something\r\ninnocuous--but interesting none the less to his correspondent--on the\r\nother side, he is simply \"out of luck.\" One can see it pays to be\r\ncareful.\r\n\r\nOn the whole--aside from the mania which seems to have possessed some\r\nmen to give away the location of their units in France--the censoring\r\nofficials declare that the army deserves a great deal of credit for\r\nliving up to both the letter and the spirit of the censor's code. They\r\ndo, however, find fault with the men who continually \"over-address\"\r\ntheir letters--that is, who persist in tacking on the number of their\r\ndivisions to the company and regimental designations. This, for military\r\nreasons, is forbidden, but many men seem as yet unaware of the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Many Thank-you Letters\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of January the base censor's office alone handled\r\nmore than 8,000 letters a day--two thousand a day increase over\r\nDecember, due, no doubt, to the thank-you letters which our dutiful\r\nsoldier-men felt compelled to write in return for those bounteous\r\nChristmas boxes. In the spring, though more transports will be coming\r\nover, more men will be writing letters, but still the work will go on.\r\nThe abuse of the letter-writing privilege by one man might mean the loss\r\nof many of his comrades, so the long and tough job of censoring must be\r\n\"seen through.\"\r\n\r\nSo, you smarty with the private code to transmit all sorts of dope to\r\nthe folks, have a care! No matter how the letters pile up, old Base\r\nCensor, Inc., is always on the job! Like the roulette wheel at Monte\r\nCarlo, he'll get you in the end, no matter how lucky and clever you\r\nthink yourself. Or, as Indiana's favorite poet might put it,\r\n\r\n    \"The censor-man 'ull git you ef you\r\n                                   don't\r\n                                    watch\r\n                                      out!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                            MIRABELLE\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nOne striking feature of the war is the number of women and girls engaged\r\nin various kinds of work back of the lines. The British Army has\r\nthousands of them doing clerical work or driving ambulances, while in\r\nthe A.E.F. their activities so far have been limited to canteen work\r\nwith the Red Cross or Y. M. C. A.\r\n\r\nMost of them are practical individuals doing a lot of good, but\r\noccasionally one slips over imbued with the idea that soldiers are sort\r\nof overgrown bacteriological specimens to be studied and handled only\r\nwith sterilized gloves.\r\n\r\nPossibly one of the latter inspired a certain A.E.F. private to lapse\r\ninto poetry after he had stowed her baggage away and heard her\r\ndissertation on what the camp needed.

French women and girls\r\nhad been made the victims.\r\n\r\n\"Among the refugees who passed along the roads making their way\r\nsouthward farther into France after we made our first big advance were\r\nscores of women and girls, each marked on her breast by a cross in red\r\npaint,\" said the officer. \"These were disclosed when the refugees passed\r\nin front of our medical officers who were inspecting them. All of them\r\nwere about to become mothers, and the French interpreter who was\r\nassisting the medicos explained that the cross indicated that German\r\nsoldiers were the fathers. The crosses had been painted on them, the\r\nwomen explained, to show that their children would belong to the German\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    This Iron Cross Red Hot.\r\n\r\n\"One of these unfortunates, apparently not more than seventeen years of\r\nage, had not only been painted but branded with a hot iron so that she\r\nwould be marked for life with the sign of the cross. She said that a\r\nGerman officer would be the father of her child. This officer, the girl\r\nsaid, had been quartered in her parents' home and she had been forced to\r\naccede to his desires.\r\n\r\n\"After her health became such that he had no further use for her, she\r\nsaid, he ordered her to act as his personal servant, doing the menial\r\nwork in his chamber. It was not long until she was unable to continue\r\nthis and then, angered at her weakness, he ordered soldiers to scour the\r\npaint from her breast and burn the cross into her flesh. When this was\r\ndone, she was forced to leave her home and taken to a maternity hospital\r\nwhich the army had established for other girls and women of the town in\r\nthe same condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   An Eye-Witness on \"Kultur.\"\r\n\r\n\"I myself saw the girl who had been branded and the others who had been\r\npainted like sheep and heard their stories, as I had been detailed to\r\nsupervise the return of the refugees. Thank God, America, by coming into\r\nthe war, will help to stamp out this beastly 'kultur' from the world and\r\nmake it a safe, clean place to live in for your womenfolk and mine--our\r\nmothers, our sweethearts, our wives, and our daughters. I have a\r\ndaughter just seventeen years old,\" concluded the American grimly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                   WHEN THE FRENCH BAND PLAYS.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n    There's a military band that plays, on Sunday afternoons,\r\n    In a certain nameless city's quaint old square.\r\n    It can rouse the blood to battle with its patriotic tunes,\r\n    And still render hymns as gentle as a prayer.\r\n    When it starts \"Ave Maria\" there is no one in the throng\r\n    But would doff his cap, his heart to heaven raise;\r\n    And who would shrink from combat when, with brasses sounding strong,\r\n    There is flung out on the breeze \"La Marseillaise\"?\r\n\r\n    When it starts to render \"Sambre et Meuse,\" the march that won the day\r\n    At the battle of the Marne, one sees again\r\n    The grey-green hosts of Hundom melt before the stern array\r\n    Of our gallant sister-ally's blue-clad men.\r\n    And when it plays our Anthem, with rendition bold and clear--\r\n    While the khaki lads stand steady--then we feel\r\n    That, though tongues and ways may vary, we've found brothers over here,\r\n    Tried in war, and in allegiance true as steel.\r\n\r\n    For it's olive-drab, horizon-blue, packed closely side by side,\r\n    Till their color sets ablaze the grey old square;\r\n    And it's olive-drab, horizon-blue, whatever may betide,\r\n    That will blaze the path to victory \"up there.\"\r\n    So, while standing thus together, let us pledge anew our troth\r\n    To the Cause--the world set free!--for which we fight.\r\n    As the evening twilight gilds the ranks of blue and khaki both,\r\n    And the bugles die away into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     WHEN PACKS ARE LIGHTEST\r\n                              ----\r\n                       BY CHAPLAIN MOODY.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the cow is the least complaining and discriminating of all\r\nanimals, yet it is worthy of note that the wise farmer who understands\r\nhis cows does everything to make them as happy as possible and studies\r\ntheir comfort and convenience as far as possible. This is not because he\r\nis a sentimentalist, but for the very opposite reason. He knows his cows\r\nwill give more milk and he will get more money therefrom if they are\r\ncontented in their bovine minds and not worried by the high cost of\r\nliving and other problems.\r\n\r\nThe expert poultry man will tell you that the frame of mind of his\r\nfeathered employes has a very direct bearing on the egg output, and so\r\nhe tries to study their happiness.\r\n\r\nRecently experiments have been carried on in some factories with\r\nphonographs, and it has been proven that if the fingers of the employes\r\nare stimulated by some music they enjoy, it is possible to get more work\r\nout of them. In some Cuban cigar factories it is the customary thing to\r\nemploy a man to read to the cigar makers some story which they like, as,\r\nunder these conditions, they work better and faster.\r\n\r\nAll this is not done out of sentiment, again, but because it contributes\r\nto efficiency. The cow, the hen, the factory girl and the cigar wrapper\r\ndo better work for being in a pleasant frame of mind.\r\n\r\nWhile we of the American Expeditionary Forces do not fall into any of\r\nthese classes, the same is nevertheless probably true of us. We can be\r\nbetter soldiers if we are cheerful than we can if we are not. It may be\r\ndifficult to see how you can sight a gun any better for smiling or\r\nbayonet a man more effectively when you are cheerful. But if we believe\r\nwhat we are told, this is so, and, hence, since we all want to be good\r\nsoldiers, it becomes a duty toward this end to be happy, just as it is a\r\nduty to wash your face or police your bunk, or to keep your rifle clean.\r\nIt is a _duty_ to be happy.\r\n\r\nThat is all very well and good to say, some one interrupts at this\r\npoint, but you cannot be happy when your feet are sore or you do not\r\nhave all you want to eat. Or, it would be easy to be happy if the mail\r\nwould come, or they would \"bust\" the Mess Sergeant, or take some other\r\ngreat step forward in the improvement of the army. But we all know\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nOur happiness is not dependent on conditions outside of us, but on\r\nour hearts within us, and some of the happiest men have been the victims\r\nof extraordinary misfortune and some of the unhappiest people have been\r\npossessors of great wealth who could have all they wanted. The most\r\njoyous book in the world was written by an old man in prison who had\r\ncome to the conclusion that when they let him out they would chop his\r\nhead off. Many a man has just grinned himself out of worse fixes than\r\nyou or I are ever apt to get into.\r\n\r\nThere are very few things we cannot laugh at. By laughing, we do not\r\nactually shorten the hike, but we make it seem shorter; we do not in\r\nreality lighten the pack, but we make it seem lighter, and it all comes\r\nto the same thing, for we would rather carry a heavy load and have it\r\nseem light than carry a light load and have it seem heavy. If we laugh\r\nat the cooties when they come, and hunt them with the same merriment\r\nthat the French hunt the wild boar, the joke will be on them after\r\nall, for they do not laugh back. And then they won't seem half so\r\nbad. Laughter is a good insecticide.\r\n\r\nWe American soldiers in France are in for a big thing. Just how big it\r\nis and how long it will last we do not know and no one can tell us. But\r\nwe are determined that America shall do her part and that we as\r\nindividuals shall do ours and be the best soldiers possible, and this is\r\nsome task when we remember how gallantly our Allies have fought. It will\r\nbe, in our own language, \"some job,\" and for this reason we must use\r\nevery means within our power to accomplish it. So we must not forget\r\nhappiness as an asset to efficient soldiering. We will all smile where\r\nthe coward would whimper, and laugh where the weakling would whine, and\r\nbuckle down to what Robert Louis Stevenson called \"The great task of\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Cartoon: VOLUNTEER VIC'S BIG IDEA           BY LEMEN IN THE\r\n                                                 ST.

Also he saw a thin streamer of smoke, no bigger than Rhode\r\nIsland, winding its way out of the house-barn door. He sniffed, then\r\nhollered \"Fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire?\" echoed some of his bunk mates, coming up the road. Fire? How\r\ncould there be fire in a country where not even sulphurous language\r\nserved to start the kitchen kindlings? How could there be fire in a\r\ncountry where only every other match will light at all, at all?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, up they hustled, to see a bit of blaze lapping the edge of\r\nthe house-barn door, and to hear, from within, the plaintive cry of\r\n\"Weee-ah-eeeeee-ah-eeeeeee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady, piggy darlint!\" came Private Doe's soothing accents, from the\r\nsecond story. \"Sure an' it's meeself will resthcue yeze from this\r\nburnin' ould shack! You below there! Climb on up an' lind a hand at\r\npullin' out the hay that's up here, or ilse the whole place will be\r\nburnted down intoirely!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Enter the Reserves.\r\n\r\nInto the barn rushed half of Private Doe's squad. The other half,\r\ncalling down the road, summoned a good two companies, which came up on\r\nthe double.\r\n\r\nAt this point entered, front and centre, M. le Maire of the commune,\r\nwho, being the owner of the pig in distress, had more than a casual\r\ninterest in the proceedings. \"The fire engine! The fire engine!\" he\r\nshouted, in accents both wild and French. But, since there had been no\r\nfire in the town in fifty years, nobody seemed to know just what he\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nFact! No fire in the town in fifty years! 'Way back in the days of\r\nNapoleon III. there had been a fire, a little blaze, in the town. Think\r\nof that, you insurance men who used to write policies for clothing\r\ndealers on New York's East Side!\r\n\r\nWhen he had sufficiently recovered his avoirdupois, M. le Maire dragged\r\nout of the Hotel de Ville, with the aid of the embattled infantrymen,\r\n_some_ fire apparatus, of early Bourbon vintage. One private who helped\r\nhandle it swears that he spotted the date \"1748\" on the leather hose\r\nwhich led from a water tank, about twelve by eight by four, toward the\r\ngeneral direction of the fire. The tank, in turn, had to be filled by a\r\nbucket brigade strung along from the scene of action to the village\r\nfountain, about a quarter of a mile away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Fire a Social Success.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame to spoil a good story, but Private Doe did not throw down\r\nthe pig into an army blanket held out to receive it. He clambered down a\r\nsmouldering flight of ladder stairs, with His Pigship under his arm,\r\nquite unharmed, save for a severe nervous shock. Aside from a few\r\nscorched kit bags, the loss of the top sergeant's cherished pipe, and a\r\nfew lungfuls of smoke acquired by Private Doe, the fire was not a\r\nsuccess--that is, from a historical standpoint. But as a social event,\r\nin bringing the Americans--and Private Doe, kissed by the lady mayoress\r\nfor his pains, in particular--closer to the hearts of the villagers, it\r\nwas decidedly there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                              JIM.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n    Honest, but Jim was the sourest man in all o' Comp'ny G;\r\n    You could sing and tell stories the whole night long, but never a\r\n        cuss gave he.\r\n    You could feed him turkey at Christmastime--and Tony the cook's no\r\n        slouch--\r\n    But Jim wouldn't join in \"Three cheers for the cook!\" Gosh, but he\r\n        had a grouch!\r\n\r\n    He wouldn't go up to the hill cafay when our daily hike was done,\r\n    And sip his beer, and chin with the lads, the crabby son-of-a-gun;\r\n    He'd growl if you asked him to hold the light, he'd snarl if you\r\n        asked for a butt,\r\n    Till at last the gang was 'most ready to put Jim down for a mutt.\r\n\r\n    About the first time that our mail came in, we all felt as high as\r\n        a king;\r\n    \"What luck?\" somebody hollers to Jim: he says, \"Not a dad-blamed\r\n        thing.\"\r\n    And then he goes off in his end o' the shack, and Tom Breed swears\r\n        'at he cried;\r\n    But when somebody went and repeated it, Jim swore, by gad, Tom lied.\r\n\r\n    We were gettin' our mail, irregular-like, for about a month or two;\r\n    But Jim?

But nowadays, we speak of\r\nhandling a sixteen-inch gun to carry twenty miles. Not only do we speak\r\nof it, but we--we of the A.E.F.--actually do the handling.\r\n\r\nThe \"big boys\" are here. They are busters. They have more machinery\r\nattached to them than the average small factory. Because of the fact\r\nthat they are mounted on cars and ride on rails they are known rather as\r\nthe \"railroad artillery\" than the heavy artillery. They have been\r\npracticing for a long time on a \"blasted heath\" somewhere in France,\r\nwhere there wasn't anything within twenty miles of them that would be\r\nhurt by their gentle attentions. And, when they do practice Jee-roosh!\r\nHold onto your ear-drums and open your mouth!\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Big Fellows Hard to Move.\r\n\r\nBut the actual practice at making perfectly good targets resemble\r\ngrease-spots on the oil-cloth doesn't take up but a bit of the time of\r\nthe men who constitute the crew. They have to know a lot about moving\r\nthe big fellow, raising him and lowering him, anchoring him so he won't\r\nright-step and left-step when he's supposed to be firing, cleaning him\r\nup for inspection and the like.\r\n\r\nAbout seventy per cent. of them learned a good deal about the firing end\r\nback in the Coast Artillery Corps in the States, but this business of\r\nriding a big gun on a railroad bed, and so forth, was new to a good many\r\nof them until recently. Now, they say, the minute the aero observer up\r\nabove gives them range and so forth, they are ready to go ahead and\r\nbatter the eternal daylights out of anything from the Kaiserschloss down\r\nto old Hindenburg himself.\r\n\r\nBesides the big guns that hurl a whole hardware shop-ful of steel at the\r\nenemy, there are long-barreled 155s, and deadly devices they are in\r\ntheir way, too. But it is about the big babies, the instruments which,\r\nmore than any other save the aeroplanes, typify for most of us the\r\nadvanced methods of modern warfare, that most of the attention is\r\ncentered. The 155s and the other smaller bores can be pulled up to\r\nwithin striking distance of the line by trucks and caterpillar tractors,\r\nbut the heftiest never leave the railroad flat cars on which they are\r\nbuilt. In other words, they are rolling stock destined to keep a rolling\r\nand a rolling and a rolling until they roll right on into Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Getting One Ready to Fire.\r\n\r\nIt takes several hours to get a big one ready for firing but once its\r\nmechanism is started, under the capable handling of a trained crew, it\r\nworks with the prettiness and precision of an engine. First the gun\r\nrolls forward on to an arrangement of curved tracks which are called\r\n\"epies,\" and whose tips point toward the objective. Then, to steady the\r\npiece, twelve large wooden feet are dropped by hydraulic jacks against\r\nthe rails, and the gun is ready to fire.\r\n\r\nIt fires, all right, sending a good ton of steel in the direction\r\nindicated by the aerial observer. When it recoils, the flat car and all\r\nslides back a good couple of yards on the rails. Then it is brought back\r\ninto position again, the barrel is cooled by jets of water, the wooden\r\nfeet are braced again, and the piece loaded. Even with all those\r\noperations, the big fellow can fire a good forty shots a minute.\r\n\r\nBut, though they can fire those forty per minute, each one takes a lot\r\nout of the big fellow's life. Unlike the guns of smaller calibre, they\r\ncannot be used over and over again. They are too powerful to be used in\r\nactual trench warfare, but let a fortress, or a mountain that has\r\nperversely got in the way of operations, loom up ahead, and down it\r\ngoes! Also the big shells have been found exceedingly useful in knocking\r\nin the roofs of German tunnels underground, even those that are quarried\r\nout ninety feet under the surface.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the big fellow has a short life, but--if he's directed\r\nright--it's a mighty gay one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                    A BULL IS DURHAM'S PRIDE.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nA Durham, N.

It will yield rights of the roadway\r\nonly to troops and ambulances, food, ammunition and guns, and the\r\npaymaster's car. It has a big job ahead to prove worthy of its namesake,\r\nbut, with the help of all of you, it will, in good old down east\r\nparlance, \"do its gol-derndest\" to deliver the goods. So--For-_ward_!\r\nMARCH!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                         FATHER ABRAHAM.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nJust one hundred and nine years ago this coming February 12, there was\r\nborn, in what was then the backwoods of Kentucky, the man whose career\r\nis most symbolic of the equality of opportunity afforded by our common\r\ncountry. By dint of hard work, laboring under the spell of poverty and\r\nof discouraging surroundings, Abraham Lincoln made himself fit to be\r\nnominated for and twice elected to the highest office within the gift of\r\nhis countrymen. Not only that; he so qualified himself that he brought\r\nhis country safely through the period which, next to the present one,\r\nproved to be the most crucial in its entire history.\r\n\r\nHe accomplished that tremendous task largely by the exercise of the most\r\ntrying--and, to those who do not possess it, the most exasperating--of\r\nall the virtues: Patience. Patience which, moreover, was coupled with a\r\nrare sense of homely humor. When pettifogging scandal-mongers sneaked up\r\nto him with tales that Grant, his most successful commander, was\r\ndrinking to excess, he merely smiled; said he wished he knew the brand\r\nof whisky Grant used, so he could try it on some of his other generals;\r\nkept Grant in command (for he had his own sources of information as to\r\nthe general's conduct), and held his peace, trusting to time to\r\nvindicate his judgment, as it did amply.\r\n\r\nThen, too, in his relations with the Copperheads, the pacifists of that\r\nday, who would have, as Horace Greeley put it, \"let the erring sisters\r\ndepart in peace,\" Lincoln practiced patience--patience mixed with a keen\r\nappreciation of the humorous side of their frantic meanderings. Through\r\nall the dark days of those long four years he kept his poise, kept his\r\nhead, kept his nation straight in the true course; and yet, wracked with\r\nanxiety, battered by critics, he found time to laugh, and to show\r\nothers the way to laugh.\r\n\r\nEvery American, at home or over here, would do well to take deep\r\nthought, on this coming anniversary, of what manner of man was \"the\r\nprairie lawyer, master of us all.\" In spite of reverses to his armies,\r\nin spite of such criticism as never before or since was leveled at the\r\nhead of a President, in spite of personal bereavement, in spite of the\r\ncaptiousness of his own chosen advisors, he saw his task through. To-day\r\na united nation, united because he made it possible to be so, stands\r\nagain in battle array to vindicate the principle which he held most\r\ndear: \"That government of the people, by the people, for the people\r\nshall not perish from the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is our privilege, and our glory, as members of America's vanguard of\r\nliberty, so to fight, so to strive, that we may rightly be called the\r\nfellow countrymen of Father Abraham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     SQUARING THE TRIANGLE.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decision of the American Army and Navy Y. M. C. A. in France not to\r\naccept as workers any more men who are eligible for military service\r\nwill meet with the hearty approval of every member of the A. E. F. The\r\nstand of the Association in this regard will do away with one of the\r\nmost frequently criticised features of its operation, and will awaken in\r\nthe army a new confidence in the Y. M. C. A., and a belief in its\r\nsincerity and fairness.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of a man of draft age, undeniably husky and fit for active\r\nservice, cosily situated behind a counter during working hours, and when\r\noff duty enjoying all the privileges, and often wearing much of the\r\ninsignia, of an officer when he had not been through the training and\r\nmade the sacrifices to entitle him to such treatment, has more than once\r\ngalled the feelings of the enlisted man, who, far less comfortably\r\nquartered, enjoying no privileges, knew that sooner or later he and his\r\nofficers would have to take the chances \"up there\" while the \"Y. M.\" man\r\nwould remain in comparative safety behind. Such a spectacle inevitably\r\nled to the belief, in the minds of many men, that certain young\r\ngentlemen with \"pull\" were donning the Association uniform simply to\r\nescape the perils which all good men and true, wearing the khaki of the\r\nA. E. F., will sooner or later be called upon to brave. Naturally, such\r\na belief lowered the standing of the Association in the eyes of the men\r\nactively engaged in preparation for the work of the fighting line.\r\n\r\nTHE STARS AND STRIPES feels sure that the Y. M. C. A. can recruit just\r\nas many \"red-blooded\" men, just as many \"good mixers,\" among those who\r\nare older than thirty-one as among those of military age. What is more,\r\nit undoubtedly will draw from the older men a class more experienced in\r\nthe handling of affairs, more accustomed to dealing with all sorts of\r\ntheir fellows. Viewed from any angle, the \"Y. M.\" has taken a great step\r\ntoward efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                      TALK AND RESOLUTIONS.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a recent speech to representatives of the British trades unions,\r\nPremier Lloyd George of England said something which every American,\r\nboth here and at home, would do well to bear in mind.\r\n\r\n\"If we are not prepared to fight, what sort of terms do you think we\r\nwill get from Hindenburg? If you sent a delegation and said: 'We want\r\nyou to clear out of Belgium', he would just mock you. He would say in\r\nhis heart: 'You cannot turn me out of Belgium with trade union\r\nresolutions.' No; but I will tell you the answer you can give him: 'We\r\ncan and will turn you out of Belgium with trade union guns and trade\r\nunionists behind them!'\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, mere boastful talk will not lick Germany. Guns, and the\r\nmen behind them are the only things that will do the job. There is only\r\none way for us of the A. E. F.--the men behind the guns--to bring about\r\nthe peace which the world craves, and that is by resolving to make every\r\nshot from those guns talk business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                    STREET OF THE PRETTY HEART.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might have been a street once, that shell-pocked thoroughfare, its\r\ncobbles piled awry, its curbing bitten out as though by the teeth of a\r\nstone-crunching giant. Scarcely one of the houses that lined it but had\r\ngaping shell-holes in walls, piles of clattered-down bricks before it,\r\nheaps of dust--all mute tokens of the devastation wrought by the enemy\r\nairmen during the raid of the night before. But, in the middle of that\r\npathetic and ruined apology for a street the children were playing away,\r\nas merrily as if nothing at all had happened, shouting to one another in\r\nglee. And the name of that street--as the battered and half obliterated\r\nsign on the corner of the caved-in house at the end testified--was \"Rue\r\ndu Joli Coeur\"--\"Street of the Pretty Heart!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Street of the Pretty Heart!\" It is symbolic of the way France has\r\nborne her struggle, her devastation--with the heart-free, care-free\r\nspirit of childhood. One may crush, but not conquer, a race whose\r\nchildren can find happiness amid such surroundings, can abandon\r\nthemselves to play under the very shadow of disaster. The \"Street of the\r\nPretty Heart\"--in that title is the secret of triumph of the spirit over\r\nthe powers of darkness, the secret of the triumph of the spirit of\r\nFrance over the malignant and evil genius of her arch enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                      SINGING ON THE HIKE.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not sing \"by order\" in this man's army, but that is no reason why\r\nwe should not sing--just because we are not ordered to do so. Singing\r\ncan clip more kilos off a hike, take more lead out of a pack, drive more\r\ndampness out of the clothing than anything else. Also, it is good for\r\nthe lungs. What is good for the lungs is good for the heart. And lungs\r\nand hearts in good condition are the best possible aids to the \"guts\"\r\nthat will win this war.\r\n\r\nWe do not need to sing \"highbrow stuff.\" We cannot imagine American\r\ntroops going into battle as our Italian allies are said to, singing the\r\nnational anthem, for the simple reason that we are not built that way,\r\nthat's all. But we can sing something--even \"All We Do Is Wait for Pay\r\nDay,\" or the famous ditty about the acrobatic grasshopper--and, if we\r\ndo, we are more than apt to find ourselves feeling a lot better for it.\r\nMorever, it will help the fellow back in the line who, because of his\r\ncold, a badly slung pack, a tight pair of shoes, or, perhaps, bad news\r\nfrom home, is finding the going just a bit hard. It is the job of all of\r\nus who feel fit to do all we can, to boost along the fellow who may not\r\nfeel quite so fit. It's team play that counts.\r\n\r\nSo start her off! Pitch it low enough so everybody can reach it, and\r\nkeep it going. It is an unbeatable tonic for an unbeatable army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                        SPIES AND ASSES.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nBeware of the man who, no matter what his uniform, no matter what his\r\nnationality, comes to you with tales of Germany's invincibility,\r\nprophecies that \"the war will end in a draw,\" and so forth. If he is\r\nsaying such things on his own account, he is a German propagandist, a\r\nspy, a paid liar, and should be reported and punished as such. If he is\r\nrepeating them second hand, he is nothing but an ass, a dupe of some\r\nreal propagandist, and he should be reported and punished just the same.\r\n\r\nGermany thinks we are a credulous lot of people. Old Bismarck himself\r\nonce cynically remarked that there was a special Providence that watched\r\nout for plumb fools and Americans. More recently, Von Papen, whom our\r\nGovernment asked to have withdrawn from his post as German military\r\nattache at Washington, referred to us affectionately as \"those idiotic\r\nYankees.\" Consequently, Germany now hopes to weaken our resolution by\r\nsending among us these tale-bearers, these prophets of disaster, on the\r\nchance that some of us will be fools enough to bite.\r\n\r\nThe only sure and safe way to fool Germany in return is to report any\r\nman mouthing such pro-German sentiments, and report him at once. Your\r\ncompany commander will then see to it that further enemy activity by\r\nthat man will be effectively stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                          \"GAS-ALERT!\"\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is said to be making progress in the gentle art of\r\nextracting explosives from chestnuts.

In fact, some of those\r\nstories have been relayed to us, and if they weren't so far from the\r\ntruth we might be inclined to get really mad. But knowing the authors of\r\nsome of them--for some of the hysterical stripe have really been over\r\nhere--our first inclination is to laugh.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, it's no laughing matter to be talked about behind our\r\nbacks in such a reckless and irresponsible way by reckless and\r\nirresponsible people, though no doubt some of them have the best\r\nintentions in the world and think that they, and they alone, can save\r\nus. (They have probably told you that, and asked you to contribute money\r\nto their worthy cause, haven't they?) What hurts most, however, is the\r\nthought that, though we know you are loyal to us and have the firmest of\r\nfaith in us, perhaps these dire tales may have caused you anxiety, may\r\neven have brought you to believe that perhaps, after all, we had become\r\na bit neglectful of our trust; and that, so believing, you might have\r\nbeen sorely, and entirely unduly, distressed in spirit.\r\n\r\nBe assured that these sensational stories are nothing but myths. Absolutely\r\nnothing else. And we have the facts to prove that they are. Listen:\r\n\r\nThe percentage of venereal disease in this army of yours is three-tenths\r\nof one per cent.--the smallest percentage on record for any army, or any\r\ncivil population, in the world's history. It is a sober army, and a\r\nwell-behaved one. The statistics in the possession of the Judge Advocate\r\nGeneral's department prove that there have been, in proportion, fewer\r\ncases of drunkenness, fewer breaches of military discipline among its\r\nmembers than has been the case with any army whose records have been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nNow, to take a specific instance. A certain self-constituted \"board of\r\nmorals\" is quoted in a dispatch from the United States to the effect\r\nthat 1,046 men of the \"north-eastern States\" were locked up in the\r\nguardhouse following their first pay day, for drunkenness.\r\n\r\nThat is the story; here are the facts:\r\n\r\nSince the troops referred to as coming from the \"north-eastern States\"\r\ncame to France, the total number of their men locked up in the\r\nguardhouse for all offenses--not for drunkenness alone, mind you--has\r\nbeen exactly 134 to date. In other words, the self-constituted champions\r\nof sobriety generously multiplied by eight the number of men imprisoned\r\nfor all offenses--including as it does those punished for infractions of\r\nrules, insubordination and the like--and passed the enlarged figures on\r\nto you as representing the number of men locked up for drunkenness\r\nalone! No wonder you were scared--as they probably intended you should\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nJust to refute them again, here is a quotation from the report of a\r\nProtestant chaplain on active service with these same maligned troops\r\nfrom the \"north-eastern States.\" Bear in mind, too, that this particular\r\nchaplain has been in the army but a short time, and therefore brings a\r\nfresh and impartial judgment to bear on the problems. This is what he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"In performing my priestly functions it has been my privilege to travel\r\nconsiderably among the troops, and it pleases me immensely to be able to\r\nstate that I find moral conditions most satisfactory. The military\r\nauthorities are vigilant in removing temptation. We have a clean army;\r\nand I am honestly convinced that the men in France are in less danger\r\nmorally than they would be in service in their own country.\"\r\n\r\n\"The men in France are in less danger morally than they would be in\r\nservice in their own country.\" That last clause is worth repetition.\r\nPonder on that, dear people at home.\r\n\r\nHere's something more. The Catholic chaplains attached to these same\r\nslandered troops declare that, out of thousands of men admitted to the\r\nconfessional, only three have confessed to sins of any magnitude. A\r\ncorrespondent of an internationally-known daily newspaper, whose\r\nbusiness it is to get facts and to report them accurately, adds this:\r\n\r\n\"I was in the only town of any size in the whole area occupied by the\r\ntroops referred to on the night when they were first paid off in France.\r\nThe majority of these men received from two to three months' pay,\r\ntotalling in many cases $100 or more. The streets were crowded with\r\nsoldiers buying up everything in sight, from candy and chocolate to\r\nclothing, but--it's the absolute truth--I did not see a single drunken\r\nsoldier; while the provost guard records show the smallest number of\r\narrests. Since then I have seen a good deal of the troops referred to as\r\n'North-Eastern,' as a result of which I can unhesitatingly state that if\r\nthe troops training in the United States conduct themselves as well,\r\nthey're doing nobly.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the commanding officer of this same body of men--and our\r\ncommanding officers are our severest critics and also our only really\r\ncompetent ones--volunteers this, by way of clinching the argument:\r\n\r\n\"I never knew any army garrison in the United States before the war to\r\nhave anything like so good a record.\"\r\n\r\nAs to conditions in general, both Allied and neutral military observers\r\nhave expressed themselves as astonished at the remarkably good behavior\r\nof this army of yours. The world does move. Armies no longer live by\r\nforage, loot, and pillage; but even at that, this pay-as-you-go,\r\nbehave-as-you-go American Army has been a revelation to our European\r\nAllies.\r\n\r\nTake it all in all, these American Expeditionary Forces constitute an\r\narmy which is in every way a worthy successor to the first army of\r\nliberty, whose commander was George Washington. It is proud of its\r\nheritage, proud of you people at home who are supporting it and who are\r\nbacking it with your labor, your money, your hopes, and your prayers,\r\nproud of the Government that sped it on its way overseas, proud of the\r\ncause for which it is fighting--the greatest cause which any army was\r\never called upon to champion. It would rather rot under the soil of\r\nFrance than to do anything which would cast discredit on the homes it\r\nleft, which would impugn in any way the good name of the great people\r\nfrom whom it was recruited.\r\n\r\nBear all this in mind, good people back in God's country, if you hear\r\nany more stories about us made up out of the same whole cloth. If by any\r\nchance any of you should hesitate to believe us, write to our\r\ncommanders, our chaplains, our doctors--anybody in authority. They will\r\nback us to the limit--and we, for our part, will guarantee to come home\r\nto you clean in body, exalted in mind and heart, and with the record\r\nbehind us of a man's size job manfully done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                       MENTIONED IN ORDERS\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n                          NEW HEADGEAR.\r\n\r\nThe \"Oversea Cap,\" the latest thing in military headgear, has been\r\nofficially adopted as part of the uniform for officers, soldiers and\r\nother uniformed members of the A.E.F. For the latter two classes, the\r\ncap will be of 20 ounce olive drab cloth, or perhaps a little heavier.\r\nThere will be no show of coloring on the cap, and the stiffening of the\r\nflap will be the same color as the cap itself. When the cap is issued to\r\na man, he will be expected to turn in his service hat to nearest\r\nQuartermaster depot.\r\n\r\nThe officers' Overseas cap will be the same model as that worn by the\r\nmen, but the material will be that of the officers' uniform. For\r\nofficers other than general officers, the stiffening at the edge of the\r\nflap will be the same color as the arm of the service to which the\r\nofficer belongs, and will project far enough above the edge of the flap\r\nto give the appearance of piping when the cap is worn with the flap up.\r\nGeneral officers will have caps with stiffening of the same color as the\r\ncap cloth itself, with a strip of gold braid an eighth of an inch to a\r\nquarter of an inch from the outside of the flap.\r\n\r\nExcept where the helmet is prescribed, officers actually commanding\r\ntroops will wear the Oversea cap. At other times the Oversea or the\r\nservice cap is optional.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TRENCH UNIFORMS.\r\n\r\nOfficers are also authorized to wear the so-called trench coat, with\r\nthe insignia of rank on the shoulder. This may also be worn on the\r\nraincoat. Officers serving in the Zone of Advance will be issued all\r\narticles of the enlisted man's uniform and equipment they need; and,\r\nwhen their duty in the trenches is over, they will return all such\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NEATNESS IN DRESS.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these new regulations concerning clothing, it is\r\nstrictly laid down that every effort must be made at all times by the\r\nofficers and men of the A.E.F. to present a neat and soldierly\r\nappearance. When men are not actually engaged on field service, it is\r\ndirected that uniforms will be pressed and brushed, and that belts,\r\nleggings, shoes, boots, and brasses will be cleaned and polished. Even\r\nwhen on active service, it is required that advantage be taken of every\r\nopportunity to clean uniforms and equipment.\r\n\r\n\"No soldier,\" says the order, \"will be permitted to leave his command on\r\npass unless he presents a neat and soldierly appearance, which will be\r\ndetermined at an inspection by an officer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AMBULANCE VENTILATION.\r\n\r\nFord ambulances in the service of the A.E.F. are to be bored with one\r\ninch auger holes at three-inch intervals in double rows through the\r\nwooden front just at the driver's back and immediately beneath the roof;\r\nin the tail-board, also, there will be fifteen holes. This is to secure\r\nproper ventilation, as deaths have been known to occur, in other Allied\r\nservices, within the enclosed bodies of the ambulances which are\r\nequipped with exhaust gas heaters. Ambulance drivers are cautioned to\r\ninvestigate the condition of their passengers at five-minute intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TYPHOID PROPHYLAXIS.\r\n\r\nAny men in the A.E.F. who have not as yet taken typhoid prophylaxis will\r\nbe required to do so in the near future; and, in all cases where it is\r\nshown that complete protective measures have not been taken, the surgeon\r\nwill administer triple vaccine prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      RED CROSS SEARCHERS.\r\n\r\nOne \"searcher\" of the American Red Cross may be attached to each\r\nstatistical section of the Adjutant-General's department throughout the\r\nA.E.F. and in each hospital sub-section, except in field hospitals.\r\nInformation as to casualties, etc., will be furnished freely to Red\r\nCross searchers subject to the necessary restrictions as to what may be\r\nforwarded, and at what times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MORE RATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe meat, coffee and sugar rations of troops engaged in work involving\r\nhard manual labor of eight hours or more a day will be increased 25 per\r\ncent. up to the end of March. This holds true in future from November to\r\nMarch, inclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RECKLESS DRIVING.\r\n\r\nReckless driving by chauffeurs is frowned upon severely in General\r\nOrders No. 11. In consequence of past accidents, it is now required that\r\nevery driver of an A.E.F. motor vehicle which sustains a collision with\r\nany French vehicle or person, or kills or injures a domestic animal,\r\nwill prepare a report on Form No. 124, Q.M.M.T.S., immediately after the\r\ncollision and before resuming his journey. It is impressed upon the\r\ndrivers that this must be done in every case, regardless of how trivial\r\nthe injury may appear to be. The driver, after making out his report,\r\nwill deliver it to his immediate commanding officer with the least\r\npossible delay. Court-martial proceedings must, in every case, be\r\ninstituted against any driver who fails to render such a report\r\nimmediately upon return to his station.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HARD LIQUORS.\r\n\r\nSoldiers are forbidden either to buy or accept as gifts from the French,\r\nany whisky, brandy, champagne, or, in fact, any spirituous liquors.\r\nCommanding officers are charged with the duty of seeing that all\r\ndrinking places where the alcoholic liquors thus named are sold are\r\ndesignated as \"off limits.\" They are also directed to use every endeavor\r\nto limit to the lowest possible number the places where intoxicants are\r\nsold, and to assist the French authorities in locating non-licensed\r\nresorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     RAILROADING AT THE\r\n                         FRONT IS NO PICNIC\r\n                              ----\r\n        Engineer of Big Lizzie Takes Reporter for a Ride\r\n                 and Explains a Few Professional\r\n                          Difficulties.\r\n                              ----\r\n               BOCHE TRIES TO BEAN HIM WITH BOMBS.\r\n                              ----\r\n         Problems of Garb, Breakfast and Tobacco Happily\r\n                      Solved by \"System D.\"\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"_Casey Jones--mounted up the cabin\r\n            Casey Jones--with his orders in his hand!_\"\r\n\r\nThe singer, to judge from the way he rolled his r's, ought to have come\r\nfrom somewhere out in the perrrarrrie country of North America; but to\r\njudge from his costume, he might have come from about anywhere. He wore\r\nthe red fez of the Algerian troops, the tunic of his Britannic Majesty's\r\nfighting forces, the horizon-blue slicker of the Armee de France, but\r\nhis underpinning, as well as his voice, was downright United States.\r\nOnly the khaki trousers and canvas leggins identified him, in part, at\r\nleast, as a member of an American Railroad Engineers' Regiment.\r\n\r\n\"Up to look us over, are you?\" he inquired, grinning genially at the\r\nSTARS AND STRIPES reporter who had made his way up right behind the\r\nfighting lines, to see the engineers at their work of running supply\r\ntrains for the French. \"Well, sonny, take a good look. We ain't much on\r\nclothes\"--indicating his motley garments--\"but believe me, bo, we're\r\nthere on work! Y'see, the Boche's birdies make things pretty hot for us\r\nat times, flyin' over our perfectly good right of way and tryin' to beat\r\nus where the stack shows up bright in the dark. So we have to lay over\r\nuntil they fly back, and then git out and hustle to keep things moving\r\nsom'ers near on schedule. At that, day before yest'day, we had every\r\nblooming train on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Workings of System D.\r\n\r\n\"These duds\"--indicating his international collection of garments--\"I\r\nknow they look funny, but what can a man do? Well, it all works out\r\nright enough by what the French call 'System D'--shift for yourself. We\r\nstart out under the U.S., and we draw some--just _some_--clothes from\r\nthem. Then they turn us over to the French gov'ment to run this here\r\nline up to the front, see? French gov'ment gives us more clothes--some.\r\nThen along come some Canucks--damn decent chaps, too, and more like\r\nAmericans than anything else they've got over here--and they want to\r\ntrade off with us for some stuff. That's where the coat come from. This\r\nred dicer\"--pointing to the fez--\"I copped off'n a nigger. Funny kind of\r\ncoon he was, too; couldn't talk English, only French; and we had to\r\nteach him how to shoot crap!\r\n\r\n\"But we got three complete Uncle Sam uniforms, in three different sizes,\r\nfor the use of the whole outfit. Y'see, three men from our comp'ny get\r\nleave in Paree every week, and they just nachhully got to look right\r\nwhen they go down there. So they match, and the odd man has the pick of\r\nthe three suits, so's he can take the one that fits him. Then the other\r\ntwo flip up, and the guy that don't call it has to take what's left.\r\nGen'rally he's outer luck.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this engine o' mine,\" continued the engineer, pointing to the\r\nbig Baldwin locomotive beside him. \"Is't she a pippin, though? These\r\nlittle French ones look like fleas up alongside an elephant aside of\r\nher. They're forty-five like her in the same lot, bought by the French\r\nfor $45,000 a throw, and turned out at the works in Philly in twenty\r\ndays. They're owned by the French now, but they've got the good old\r\n'U.S.A.' right up there on the water-tender. See it?\" He obliged with\r\nhis flashlight. \"Pull? They can handle 166,000 pounds without batting an\r\neye!\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Misses the Old Bell.\r\n\r\n\"Only trouble is,\" he explained, \"we haven't got any spare parts for\r\nher, not even spare valves, she was rushed over here in such a hurry.\r\nBut at that, she's got it over anything that ever sailed over this line\r\nbefore. Why, when we first got here some of the French lines were using\r\nold engines that had been made in Germany in 1856. 'Sfact! One of ours,\r\nlike Big Lizzie here, can do the work of three of the little fellers;\r\nand, while I'm not the one to say it, perhaps, our regiment has done the\r\nwork of an outfit two and a half times as big since it came here.\r\n\r\n\"Climb up alongside of me in the cab,\" the engineer invited, \"and we'll\r\ngive her a pull up the line to the next station.\" The reporter complied,\r\nand soon his ears were startled with the long blast of a real American\r\nwhistle. \"Sounds like the real thing, doesn't it?\" beamed his guide.\r\n\"Beats those little peanut whistles they've got on the little French\r\ndinkeys. Only thing the boys miss is pulling the old bell, but they\r\ncan't do it here. Bells in this country are only used for church and for\r\ngas alarms. And it bothers 'em a bit the different signals they've got\r\nto learn: One to start, two blasts to stop, and eight for a grade\r\ncrossing. Whew! How much chance would we have to blow eight for a\r\ncrossing in the States and let anything get out of the way?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Every Station Is a Block.\r\n\r\nUp grade Big Lizzie puffed, and pulled away with a right good will,\r\nscuttling around the many curves in the road as if she were on a dance\r\nfloor. Military railroads have to have plenty of curves, so the Boche\r\nairplanes cannot follow them too closely. At the next station the\r\nreporter had a chance to examine the office of the Illinois Central\r\nagent, all decorated with shells picked up on the famous battlefields at\r\nthe head of the line, and to see the bunk house and restaurant for the\r\nmen who lay over there. Every station on the line--there are seven--has\r\nan American station master, and all the yards have American yard-masters\r\nand American switchmen. There is, strictly speaking, no block system in\r\nFrance, but each station is supposed to be the boundary of a block, and\r\na train simply stays in one station until the one ahead is clear.\r\n\r\n\"Want some hot water?\" queried the engineer of an American who, carrying\r\na big tank, came up to the engine at one of the stations. \"All right: it\r\nisn't Saturday night yet, but over here you've got to wash while the\r\nwashing's good. Help yourself out of the engine!\" And the American\r\ndid--with thanks.\r\n\r\nThe engineer paused a moment to scan the sky. \"Pretty dark for the\r\nBoches to be out,\" he remarked. \"First night out we were chased by one\r\nof 'em in a machine, but we got in all right. That's why we run without\r\nlights now, and make the crew use flashlights instead of lanterns. Right\r\nover there\"--pointing to the side of the roadbed, in the snow--\"a\r\n'flyin' Dutchman' came down last week, after being chased by a French\r\nplane. His chassis was all riddled with bullets till it looked like\r\nCook's strainer, and his wings were bent till they looked like\r\ncorkscrews. When they came up to look at the machine, they found the\r\npilot's right body in it, burnt just like a strip o' bacon that's been\r\nleft on the stove too long. They found the carcass of the officer that\r\nwas with him about 500 yards away, in the woods somewhere. He must have\r\ngot a helluva toss when he went.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       In Luck on Tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"Like it?\" He repeated the reporter's question. \"Like it? Sure; who\r\nwouldn't? Only thing is, we're loaned to the French army, as I told you,\r\nand the French never have learnt how to cook a man's size breakfast.\r\nNow, how in the name of time can a railroad man do a day's work when he\r\nbegins it on nothin' but coffee and a hunk of sour bread? But we've been\r\nrunnin in luck lately, buyin eggs and things off the people along the\r\nline, and gettin' a little stuff from the U.S.Q.M. now and then, so we\r\nmake out pretty well. The only thing that got our goat was when they\r\noffered us the French tobacco ration--seein' as we were in their army,\r\nthey thought we were entitled to it. We took one whiff apiece--and then\r\nwe said 'Nix!' Since Christmas, though, we've come into luck,\" he added,\r\npulling a big hunk of long-cut out of his Canadian blouse. \"Have a chew?\r\n\r\n\"Danger? Hell! What'd we come over for, a Sunday school picnic? No, when\r\nyou come right down to it there isn't much. If we get the tip, we just\r\ncrawl into the dugouts along the road, and shuffle the pasteboards until\r\nwe get the signal that the party is over. I've had livelier times 'n\r\nthis out west, with washouts and wrecks and beatin' off a crowd of\r\ngreasers from the tracks when they went wild, many a time. No, sir, war\r\nhasn't got much new in the movie thrill line for a railroad man!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                        AH! THOSE FRENCH!\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle, tell me: What is the difference between you and a\r\nmajor-general?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais, oui, m'sieur_, there are many differences; which one does\r\n_m'sieur_ mean?\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mademoiselle, the general, he has stars upon his shoulders; but\r\nyou--you, mademoiselle, have the stars in your eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                       SHAVING IN FRANCE.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe order says, \"Shave every other day.\" Now you, personally, may need\r\nto shave every day; or you may need to shave as often as twice a day;\r\nor, again, you may be one of those lucky and youthful souls who really\r\ndon't need to shave oftener than once a week. But, as the order makes\r\nthe every-other-day shave obligatory, you, no matter what classification\r\nyou may fall under, decide to compromise on the every-other-day shave.\r\nIn that way, and in that way only, can discipline be maintained and a\r\npleasing variety of growths up and down the comp'ny front be secured.\r\n\r\nThe order being such as it is, you dispense with washing your face every\r\nday. You wash your face on your non-shaving day, and on your shaving day\r\nyou let the shave take the place of the wash. To be sure, if you are a\r\ngenerous latherer you have to wash your face all over, including the\r\nremote portions behind the ears, after you get through shaving; but,\r\nbeing anxious to save time and economize water--thus living up to\r\nanother order--you never count that in as a real wash. When writing\r\nhome, you say simply that you wash and shave on alternate days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A Use for Helmets.\r\n\r\nTo begin the shaving process, you secure a basin full or a tin helmet\r\nfull of water--such water as the countryside affords. Usually it is\r\ndirty; sometimes in the regions bordering on what has been in German\r\nhands since 1914, it minutely resembles the drink that Gunga Dhin\r\nbrought to his suffering Tommy friend. You remember:\r\n\r\n            \"It was crawly and it stunk.\"\r\n\r\nAt that, you can't blame it for being crawly and stinking if it had been\r\nanywhere near the Boche.\r\n\r\nIf you are in billets or barracks, and there is a stove therein both\r\nhandy and going, and if all the epicures and snappy dressers in the\r\nsquad are not trying to toast their bread or thaw out their shoes or dry\r\ntheir socks on top of it at the same time, you may be allowed to heat\r\nyour shaving water--if it can be called water--on said stove. If you are\r\nallowed to--which again is doubtful--you are generally saddled with the\r\njob of being squad stove-stoker for the rest of the day. This is a\r\nconfining occupation, and hard on the eyes.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you are in neither billets nor barracks, but in the open\r\nsomewhere or if there is no fire in the stove, or, if somebody else has\r\ngot first licks at it, and you don't fit with the cook of the mess\r\nsergeant so as to be able to borrow a cup of hot water out of the coffee\r\ntank--why, there is nothing left to do but shave in cold water. This is\r\nhard on the face, the temper and the commandment against cussing. Also,\r\nif you neglected to import your shaving soap from the States and had to\r\nbuy it over here, it may mean that you are out of luck on lather.\r\n\r\nAnyway, after quite a while of fussing around, you get started. You\r\nsmear your face with something approaching lather if you've got hot\r\nwater, with a sticky, milky substance that resembles, more than anything\r\nelse, a coating of lumpy office paste. This done, and rubbed in a bit\r\naround the corners, you begin to hoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Indoor vs. Outdoor Shaving.\r\n\r\nIn billet shaving, somebody is always trying to climb into the bunk\r\nabove over your slightly bent back while you shave--for it is impossible\r\nto get your little trench mirror directly in front of your face while\r\nyou are in an upright position. In outdoor shaving--usually performed in\r\nthe middle of a village square, near the town fountain--one is\r\ninvariably bumped from behind by one of the lowing kine or frolicsome\r\ncolts peculiar to the region; to say nothing of a stray auto truck or\r\nambulance which may have broken loose from its moorings. These gentle\r\ndigs, of course, produce far less gentle digs in one's countenance. In\r\nthis way, America's soldiers, long before they reach the front, are\r\ninured to the sight of blood.\r\n\r\nAfter you have scraped off a sufficient amount of beard to show a\r\nsufficient amount of skin to convince the Top, when he eyes you over,\r\nthat you have actually shaved, you shake the lather off your razor and\r\nbrush, dab what is left of the original water over the torn parts of\r\nyour face, seize the opportunity, while you have the mirror before you,\r\nof combing your hair with your fingernails, and button your shirt\r\ncollar. The performance concluded, you are good for forty-eight hours\r\nmore, having a perfect _alibi_ if anyone comments on your facial growth.\r\nYou are not, however, in any condition to attend a revival meeting or to\r\nbless the power-that-be who condemned you to having to shave in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                           CRUSADERS.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n    Richard Coeur de Lion was a soldier and a king;\r\n    He carried lots of hefty tools with which his foes to bing;\r\n    He cased himself in armor tough--neck, shoulder, waist, and knee:\r\n    But Richard, old Coeur de Lion, didn't have a thing on me.\r\n\r\n    For while old Coeur de Lion may have worn an iron casque,\r\n    He never had to tote around an English gas-proof mask;\r\n    He never galled himself with packs that weigh about a ton,\r\n    Nor--lucky Richard--did he have to clean a beastly gun.\r\n\r\n    'Tis true he wore a helmet to protect himself from boulders,\r\n    But then, he had good rest for it upon his spacious shoulders;\r\n    While my tin hat is balanced on the peak of my bare dome,\r\n    And after marching with it--gee!

While not\r\nexactly suited to town wear, and while the more conservative dressers\r\nstill refuse to be seen in them at afternoon-tea, they are speedily\r\nadjusted and thus enjoy great popularity among those who are in the\r\nhabit of \"just making\" reveille.\r\n\r\nSlickers are, at present writing, in great demand among the members of\r\nthe younger army set. Those who were farsighted enough to procure the\r\nheavy black variety when it was issued last fall are counting themselves\r\nmore fortunate than their friends who chose the lighter, but colder,\r\nblue or drab garment.\r\n\r\nThe tin brown derby is, after all, the most serviceable headgear for\r\nall-around wear in the war zone. It should be worn on all formal\r\noccasions, particularly when nearing the Boches' reception line. When in\r\ndoubt as to the propriety of wearing it, it is always well to remember\r\nthat it is better to err on the side of safety.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: I SEE IT]\r\n\r\nThe face muffler--either English or French design--is another _sine qua\r\nnon_ for all formal occasions, particularly at _soirees_ and _dansants_\r\nnear the first line. In fact, some of the more careless dressers who\r\nhave neglected to provide themselves with it have suffered severely, and\r\nbeen roundly snubbed. While it is at best an ugly piece of facegear and\r\nextremely difficult for the uninitiated to adjust correctly, its\r\nintricacies should be mastered at the earliest opportunity by those\r\nhaving business \"up front.\"\r\n\r\nThe knit sock, home made preferred, is indispensable for wear inside the\r\nregulation field shoe during all formal and informal promenades. It is a\r\nsign of _gaucherie_, however, to allow the top of either sock to\r\nprotrude above the puttee or legging. Care should be taken that the\r\nsocks fit the feet as snugly as possible, else ugly bunches will form at\r\nthe heels and toes, thus robbing the gentle art of walking of all the\r\npleasure which Henry Ford put into it.\r\n\r\nThe web belt, worn on most formal occasions, should always be well\r\nfilled when the wearer contemplates a business trip. Cautious dressers\r\ndo well to adjust the belt so that the pistol holster hangs within easy\r\nreach of the right hand.\r\n\r\nSpiral puttees have advanced so far in popular favour that they are now\r\nbeing issued for general wear by such a conservative (but ever reliable)\r\ngent's furnishing house as the U.S.Q.M.C.D. They are considered warmer\r\nthan the old-style canvas leggings, although, as they take longer to put\r\non, they are rather frowned upon by the more hasty dressers. They should\r\nbe tightly wrapped if the wearer possesses a shapely lower limb; but\r\ntight wrapping is apt to result in tired feet at the end of a promenade\r\nof any duration.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE INFANTRY\r\n    THE INFANTRY WITH\r\n    THE DIRT BEHIND\r\n    THEIR EARS]\r\n\r\nThe regulation field shoe has been designated the correct footwear for\r\nbusiness and informal occasions. Care should be taken to secure sizes\r\nwhich will admit of the entrance of the wearer's feet (one in each shoe)\r\nwhen encased in at least two pairs of socks. Although numerous\r\ncomplaints have been lodged against the hobnails which infest the soles\r\nof these shoes, it may be said in extenuation that they are\r\nindispensable for marching along slippery roads, and also extremely\r\nuseful when the wearer is engaged in kicking Germans in the face.\r\n\r\nThe Sam Browne belt is worn exclusively by officers serving with the\r\nAmerican Expeditionary Forces--that is, in the American Army. It is a\r\nnatty leather ornament, and much sought after. It is, in fact, the last\r\nword--_dernier cri_--in gentlemanly attire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          SHIRTS                     KHAKI                COLLARS\r\n\r\n      6, Rue Castiglione,\r\n    (Opp. Hotel Continental)      A.

Pewther, Q.M.C., by Kid Johnson, of the --th\r\nInfantry, following a two minute ceremony which ended in a knockout.\r\nWhich is to say, \"Charlie, the Fighting Fireman,\" is being hailed as the\r\nnew heavyweight champion of G.H.Q., A.E.F.\r\n\r\nKid Johnson had whipped everyone in sight at G.H.Q., and was being\r\ntouted as the champion of Amex forces. He was billed to fight both\r\nPewther and a French heavyweight aspirant the same evening. He had to\r\ndisappoint the Frenchman--_fini, monsieur, FEENISHED_.\r\n\r\nCharlie, ostensibly a modest and unassuming fireman in the offices of\r\nthe Intelligence Section, General Staff, is now recognized as one of the\r\nbest fighting units in the A.E.F. Report has it that he was one of the\r\nbest bets on the Border, where he served in the Body Snatchers--with a\r\nlong string of ring victories to his credit. He had been out of the\r\nboxing game for nearly three years, having married in the interim, but\r\nno one disputes the fact that he made a great comeback.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Right Hook Turns the Trick.\r\n\r\nThe scrap took place before a crowded house. The two heavy-weights were\r\nevenly matched in height and weight.\r\n\r\nJohnson started like all champions, confidently, and let loose a strip\r\nof rattling lefts. Charlie faced the fusillade and coolly replied with\r\nseveral vicious upper-cuts reminiscent of Border days. With frequent\r\njabs he rocked the champion's head, and the crowd roared.\r\n\r\nHe met Johnson's rushes with a persistent left. The champion was\r\nfighting mad and rushed in for a cleanup. As he did so, he uncovered.\r\nThe opening was small but sufficient. Charlie countered with his left,\r\nthen sent a swift right hook to the jaw. Johnson wilted. Three\r\nknockdowns followed. Then the champion took the count.\r\n\r\nFighting Charlie was on the job at Headquarters next morning as usual,\r\nshowing no marks of the encounter. The petites demoiselles, over whom\r\nCharlie exercises daily authority, were dumbfounded to learn that their\r\nboss was a bruiser. But it is significant that the fires in the\r\nIntelligence Section to-day are burning brighter than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    New Champion Is Modest.\r\n\r\nPewther was averse to talking about himself, but he confessed to\r\ntwenty-nine years and claimed Portland, Ore., as his home. A\r\nrepresentative of THE STARS AND STRIPES found him the afternoon after\r\nthe fight seated on a coal-box reading his favorite dime novel--in which\r\nhe finds a laugh in every line--and wearing the same sized hat.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have broken into the game again,\" he declared, \"but I felt\r\nthat I couldn't stand by and hear the Johnson coterie putting over their\r\nsweeping challenges. It was all right to challenge the crowd, but when\r\nall the soldiers of the A. E. F. were included I figured it was up to me\r\nto register a kerplunk for the Q.M. Johnson would have been champion yet\r\nif he hadn't tried to take in so much territory. I'm satisfied to be\r\nchampion, and let it go at that. But if there's anyone else who wants\r\nthe title he can have it--unless there's something substantial in it.\"\r\n\r\nWhich indicates there may be something doing, as report has it that the\r\ndoughboys don't intend to let the Q.M. man walk off with the\r\nchampionship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                    A PINCH HITTER IN KHAKI.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nLank used to be something of a baseball player. In fact he's still on\r\nthe rolls of a certain National League club and back in 1914 it was\r\nLank's mighty swatting that won the world's championship for his team.\r\n\r\nNext to General Pershing himself and a few other generals, Lank is about\r\nthe most popular soldier in France. When his regiment--once of the\r\nNational Guard--comes swinging down the pike the sidelines are jammed\r\nwith other soldiers who crane their necks to get a peek at him.\r\n\r\nLank always carries the colors. He's now color-sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"So that fella's Lank, the great ball player,\" you can hear one doughboy\r\nsay to another. \"Well, I'll be doggonned. Looks just like any other\r\nsoldier, don't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you expect to see?\" will ask a soldier who has worshipped Lank's\r\nbatting average for lo! these many years. \"Didja expect to see a fella\r\nwearin' a baseball uniform and carryin' a bat over his shoulder? Sure,\r\nthat's Lank. Hello, Lank, howja like soldiering?\"\r\n\r\nLank will look out of the corner of his eye and then, sure that no\r\nofficer is looking, reply out of the corner of his mouth:\r\n\r\n\"We're on to the Kaiser's curves, boys.

A\r\nmosquito's a night-rider only.\"\r\n\r\nThe line forms on the right of the cook-shack. The cooks build big fires\r\nout in the open and set out great kettles of water. When the water\r\nbegins to boil the parade begins, each man dumping in his flea-infested\r\nclothing--uniform, socks, underwear, wristlets and blankets. The cooks\r\nkeep the fires stoked up with wood and the garments boil for a solid\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThen the men form another line and collect their stuff. They wring out\r\nthe clothes the best they can and then sit down to \"pick 'em off.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're fast little devils most usually,\" said the Dallas man, \"but the\r\nsudden shock from warm water to cold air makes them stiff, and you can\r\ncatch 'em easy.\"\r\n\r\nThe A. E. F.'s living in sheep barns simply can't keep clear of the\r\nthings. They're in the rafters, in the hay, and in the planks. Weekly\r\nboiling of clothing only gives a short relief.\r\n\r\nReally they aren't fleas at all, but a form of sheep tick. But they\r\ndon't distinguish between sheep and American soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       \"BUTTON, BUTTON.\"\r\n\r\nThe Army gets some of its best ideas about equipment from the soldiers\r\nwho have to use it.\r\n\r\nHere's an idea, making for efficiency and convenience, which comes from\r\nan Omaha boy in the ranks. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Why don't they put bachelor buttons on our uniforms and overcoats? I've\r\ngot a 'housewife' in my kit, but I'm working from 6.15 in the morning\r\nuntil 5 o'clock at night, and what little leisure I get I'd like to\r\nspend in the Y.M.C.A. playing the phonograph or shooting pool.\r\n\r\n\"And anyway, if I've got to do my sewing in the barn I live in, I might\r\nas well not try at all. My fingers are so numb the minute I take off my\r\nmitts that I couldn't thread a needle.\"\r\n\r\nNot only that, said the Omaha soldier, but you usually find you haven't\r\nany thread in your \"housewife.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something in favor of bachelor buttons, especially\r\nsince the people who sew the buttons on new uniforms and coats always do\r\na poor job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                        YES, HOW DO THEY?\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate Pat: \"Mike, what th' hell kind of fish be them ye're eatin'?\"\r\n\r\nCorporal Mike: \"Hush, Pat; don't be disthplayin' yer ignorance--the ould\r\nFrinch la-ady might hear yeze!

Its activities in taking\r\ncare of the population of the Hun-devastated districts, in clothing and\r\nfeeding the ever-increasing hordes of refugees that pour in over the\r\nSwiss frontier, in supplying French and American military hospitals and\r\nin furnishing the American forces with auxiliary clothing are well\r\nknown. It is not known, however, that, somewhere in that nebulous region\r\nknown as somewhere in France, the Red Cross has gone in a bit for what\r\nhas generally been considered the Y. M. C. A.'s own particular\r\ngame--that of running the festive army canteen.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be found out at present writing, this canteen is the only\r\none operated by the Red Cross in France. It is run primarily for the\r\nbenefit of the young American aviators whose training station is hard\r\nby. And, because aviators, breathing rarer and higher ozone than most of\r\nthe rest of us, are in consequence always as hungry as kites and\r\ncormorants, this particular Red Cross canteen does a rushing business.\r\n\r\nIt is situated in a long barrack-like building of the familiar type,\r\nwhich is partitioned off into a social room and a combination officers'\r\ndining room and a storeroom kitchen. The kitchen--as always in anything\r\npertaining to the army--is the all-important part. This kitchen is\r\nnoteworthy for two things: It has a real stand-up-and-sit-up lunch\r\ncounter, and its products are cooked and served by the deft hands of\r\nAmerican women.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Girls Worked All Night.\r\n\r\nNo dinners are served at this canteen for the airmen. Those favors are\r\nreserved for the convalescents in the hospital nearby. But the airmen\r\nare dropping in all the time for sandwiches and hot coffee, particularly\r\nafter coming down, chilled and chattering, from a flight into the upper\r\nregions of the sky. If they don't drop in to get warmed up in that\r\nfashion, they know they are in for a scolding by the head of the\r\ncanteen, an Englishwoman possessed of all an American mother's motherly\r\ninstincts and all of the English army's ideals of discipline.\r\n\r\nThere was one night that the little Red Cross canteen was put to a\r\nsevere test. Eighteen hundred Americans arrived at the aviation camp\r\nafter a thirty-hour trip punctuated by no saving hot meal. The\r\nmanager-matron and her girl helpers, however, stayed up nearly all\r\nnight, minting hot coffee and sandwiches so that the hardships of\r\nsleeping on the cold bare ground of the hangars was somewhat mitigated\r\nfor the 1,800 unfortunates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A Repair Shop For Clothes.\r\n\r\nIn all the canteen disburses about 2,000 sandwiches a day, with mugs of\r\ncoffee to match. In addition to that, its workers, equipped with\r\nNorwegian fireless cookers, sally forth to the aviation fields in the\r\nmornings long before dawn so that the men who are going up may have\r\nsomething warm to eat and drink to fortify them against the cold. Not\r\ncontent with doing that for their charges the Red Cross people soon hope\r\nto have enough workers to take care of mending the aviators' clothes,\r\nfor aviators have to wear lots of clothes, and, when they land in trees,\r\nin barbed wire, on stone walls and so forth, their clothes suffer in\r\nconsequence. A doughboy, who wears one suit at a time, doesn't have a\r\nhard job keeping it in order; but an aviator with heaven knows how many\r\nlayers of clothes--oh, my!\r\n\r\nThe young women who constitute the Red Cross working staff at this\r\nparticular base, are, for the most part, prominent in society in the\r\nlarger American cities. Voluntarily they have given up lives of luxury\r\nto tackle the job, and a hard job it is. They live in small barracks of\r\ntheir own, as do the \"Tommywaacs\" (Women's Army Auxiliary Corps) of the\r\nBritish army; but they are \"roughing it\" gladly to help Uncle Sam win\r\nhis war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                          OUR SANCTUM\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's an office, all right, for it has a typewriter in it. No, not the\r\nfeminine person who usually decorates offices; simply the typewriting\r\nmachine. It has a calendar too, as all well-regulated offices should\r\nhave. The only things every well-regulated office has which it lacks are\r\nthe red-and-white signs \"Do It Now\" and the far more cheerful wall\r\nmotto, \"Out to Lunch.\"\r\n\r\nIt has lamps, to be sure, not electric lights, as is the custom among\r\noffices in the States. It has maps on the walls, but they differ a great\r\ndeal from the ones which used to hang above the Boss's desk back home,\r\nand at which we used to stare blankly while waiting for him to look up\r\nfrom his papers and say, \"Well, whazzamatternow?\" These maps have no red\r\ncircles marking zones of distribution, no blue lines marking salesmen's\r\nroutes and delimiting their territories, no stars marking agencies'\r\nlocations. True, they have lines on them, and a few stars on them, but\r\nthey stand for far different things....\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Furnishings are Simple.\r\n\r\nThe office has a few rickety chairs, and one less rickety than the\r\nothers which is reserved for the Big Works, as he is affectionately\r\ncalled, on the occasion of his few but none the less disquieting visits.\r\nIt has a rickety table or two, usually only one, for firewood is scarce\r\nin France. It has a stove, which, from its battered appearance, must\r\nhave been used as a street barricade during the Reign of Terror in the\r\ndays of the First Revolution. Said stove requires the concentrated\r\nefforts of one husky Yank, speaking three languages--French, United\r\nStates, and profane--all the live-long day to keep it going. Even then\r\nthe man sitting nearest the window is always out of luck.\r\n\r\nThe walls are unkempt in appearance, as if the plaster had shivered\r\ninvoluntarily for many a weary day before the coming of \"les Americains\"\r\nand their insistence upon the installation of the stove. The paper is\r\nseamed and smeared until it resembles a bird's-eye view of the\r\nbattlefield of the Marne. The ceiling is as smudged as the face of a\r\nnaughty little boy caught in the midst of a raid on the jam in the\r\npantry, due, no doubt, to the aforesaid stove and to the over-exuberant\r\nrising-and-shining of the kerosene lamps. Some people ascribe the state\r\nof the celling to the grade of tobacco which the Boss smokes; but the\r\nBoss always thunders back, \"Well, what the devil can a man do in a\r\ncountry where even cornsilk would be a blessing?\" And, as what the Boss\r\nsays goes, that ends it.\r\n\r\nThere is one rug on the floor, a dilapidated affair that might well be\r\nthe flayed hide of a flea-bitten mule. There is a mantlepiece,\r\nstretching across what used to be a fireplace in the days of the First\r\nNapoleon, but which is a fireplace no more. On top of the mantlepiece is\r\na lot of dry reading--wicked-looking little books full of fascinating\r\nfacts about how to kill people with a minimum of effort and ammunition.\r\nOn the floor, no matter how carefully the office occupants scrape their\r\nhobnails before entering, there is always a thin coating of mud.\r\n\r\nThe office telephone is on the wall, instead of on the Boss's desk, as\r\nit ought to be. One has to take down receiver and transmitter all in the\r\nsame piece in order to use it. And it has the same old Ford-crank\r\nattachment on the side that is common to phones in the rural free\r\ndelivery districts of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Why Hats Are Worn.\r\n\r\nInstead of being lined with bright young men in knobby business suits\r\nand white stiff collars, the office is lined with far brighter young men\r\nin much more businesslike khaki. They keep their hats on while they work\r\nfor they know not when they may have to dash out again into the cold and\r\nthe wind and the rain. They keep their coats on for the same reason;\r\nthere are no shirt-sleeves and cuff protectors in this office, for the\r\nsimple reason that there are no cuffs to be protected and that\r\nshirt-sleeves are \"not military.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no office clock for the laggard to watch. Instead, there are\r\nbugle calls, sounded from without. Or, again the hungry man puts the\r\nforearm bearing his wrist watch in front of his face, as if to ward off\r\na blow, when he wants to know the time. Save for the clanking of spurs\r\nand the thumping of rubber boots, it is a pretty quiet office,\r\nsingularly so, in fact, considering the work that is done in it.\r\n\r\nTake it all in all, it's a strange kind of an office, isn't is? Well, it\r\nought to be, considering it's in a strange land. It's an army newspaper\r\noffice, that's what it is--an American sanctum in the heart of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                    TACTICS GET GOAT ACROSS.\r\n                              ----\r\n                 Requirements Include Perfume, a\r\n                   Sack, a Kit Bag and Cheers.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the C.O. down to \"Fuzzy,\" who would have rather taken court martial,\r\nno one wanted to leave \"Jazz\" behind. So there was no end of indignation\r\nwhen the order came at a certain American port that no animals (unless\r\nuseful) could go to France with the squadron.\r\n\r\n\"Jazz,\" being only a tender-hearted billy goat, could not claim\r\nexemption from remaining in the U.S.A., for, as everybody agreed, he was\r\nno earthly use, just \"a poor, no-good goat.\" But \"Jazz\" did go aboard\r\nthe transport, later an English railway train, next another ship and\r\nfinally a French train until he arrived with the squadron at America's\r\nbiggest air post in France. There I saw him the other day appreciatively\r\nlicking devoted \"Fuzzy's\" hand.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to guess that \"Jazz\" is the mascot of \"X\" squadron,\r\naccepted by pilots and mechanics alike as talisman for good at some\r\ntraining camp back home. This office he has performed with exceptional\r\nskill from the day \"Fuzzy\" permitted him to \"butt in\" at the mechanics'\r\nmess.\r\n\r\n\"Fuzzy\" and some of his pals slipped the goat into a sack and laid him\r\ndown among the cold storage meat when the time came to help load the\r\nship, taking care that the sack of live goat did not get into the\r\nrefrigerator. When the ship was well out to sea, the sack was opened and\r\n\"Jazz\" crawled out blinking.\r\n\r\nEven then \"Fuzzy\" was cautious. For the first days, he did not permit\r\nthe animal to promenade indiscriminately, but subjected him to repeated\r\nscrubbings, following by perfume, toilet water and talcum powder. So\r\nwhen \"Jazz\" was really discovered, he smelt, but more like a barber shop\r\nthan a goat. The ship's officers appreciated the joke and so did\r\neveryone else and soon \"Jazz\" became a favorite on deck. Repeatedly\r\nshampooed and perfumed, wearing a life-preserver, he moved about like a\r\ngood sailor. But there was less joyful days ahead of him.\r\n\r\nHe did not exactly set foot on English soil as did his friends. He went\r\nashore at an unmentionable port in a kit bag. In this he lay with the\r\nother bags, surrounded by a screen of men. \"Jazz\" was uncomfortable and\r\nsaid so in his goat way, but before he had uttered a full syllable his\r\nfriends set up a cheer which drowned his voice.\r\n\r\nThis happened again and again. The first time, British transport\r\nofficers at the port politely disregarded the Americans' demonstrations,\r\nbut after the third time one of them exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Extraordinary, these Americans. Wonderful spirit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a little later when the men burst into an excessively loud hurrah to\r\nannihilate the voice of \"Jazz\" an elderly British colonel came over to\r\nthem and inquired of a young American officer nearby:\r\n\r\n\"Splendid lungs your chaps have! But, really, what are they cheering for\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" returned the American, who very well knew why, \"they're like that.\r\nAlways cheering about something. Shall I stop it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed! I think it's splendid.\"\r\n\r\nSo that adventure passed over nicely and \"Jazz\" went on in a \"goods van\"\r\nwith the kit bags to another British sea port. After that there wasn't\r\nany further trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                      WHERE LANGUAGE FAILS.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember along about examination time how you used to think Hades would\r\nbe a good place for the professor?\r\n\r\nTwo Williams College graduates have had the pleasure of meeting their\r\nold French teacher in the nearest earthly approach to the Inferno--the\r\ntrenches.\r\n\r\nOfficers now, the ex-students finally readied the battalion commander's\r\npost in a certain sector after a two-mile trudge from the rear through\r\nmud and ice water up to their hips.\r\n\r\nA French interpreter met them at the door of the post.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the major is in,\" he said, \"but he won't see you till you shake\r\nhands with _me_.\"\r\n\r\nBoth officers thought they were face to face with a nut. Then, as they\r\nrecognized their old teacher, two hands shot and grasped both of his.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be darned--you haven't changed a bit!\" was all the French\r\nthey could remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                    HIS IS NOT A HAPPY LOT\r\n                      SAYS ARMY POSTAL CLERK\r\n                              ----\r\n          Works Eighteen Hours a Day and Has To Be Both\r\n                a Directory of the A.

I guess\r\nthat's him, all right. Hey, feller, shove this in 88966543, will-ya?\r\nThanks!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the rear of a line of scrapping, frantic mail orderlies, each one\r\ntrying to corner all the packages marked \"Tobacco\" and \"Chocolate\" for\r\nhis particular outfit, the reporter, by standing on a box marked\r\n\"Fragile--This Side Up,\" was able to see the scene depicted above, and\r\nto hear, above the din, the Postal Clerk's momentous decisions.\r\n\r\nNothing like that had ever come into his ken before. He had seen Col.\r\nRoosevelt at work in his office, talking into two telephones, dictating\r\nto four stenographers, and writing a letter with each hand\r\nsimultaneously. He had watched the President of the United States\r\ndispose of four Senators, eight Representatives, three Governors of\r\nStates, seven Indian tribal chiefs and the German ambassador in exactly\r\nseven and a half minutes by the clock. But never, in all his experience,\r\nhad he witnessed such concentration, such rapidity of execution, as that\r\nwhich the lean, worn man at the big desk possessed. It was better than\r\nwatching a machine gun in action, with all stops out.\r\n\r\nWorming his way up to the desk, the reporter started on his set speech.\r\n\"Mr. Army Post Office Superintendent, will you consent to be interviewed\r\nfor----\" when he was summarily stopped by the wave of an ample hand and\r\nthe booming of the P.S.'s voice.\r\n\r\n\"Want me to talk, do you, eh? Want to know what I do with my spare time?\r\nAll right, son; just jump over that gang of pouch-robbers and come on\r\ninside. Here you----\" this to the still combatant orderlies, at the same\r\ntime throwing an armfull of mail and papers at them--\"here's all the\r\nstuff for your outfits to-day. Divvy up among yourselves, and then\r\nbreeze!--beat it!--allez!\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, you want to know what I do with my spare time? Well, I work\r\neighteen hours a day in the office, and the other six I spend worrying\r\nwhether or not I gipped some poor Buddy when I cashed his American money\r\norder in French paper currency. Like the saloons in Hoboken, we never\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Really Busy at Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"That's just about the way it was, no kidding, during the Christmas\r\nrush. In about a month enough tobacco, chocolate, chewing gum, knit\r\nsocks, mufflers, fruit cake, safety razors, lump sugar--to judge from\r\nthe contents lists on the outside of the bundles--came through this\r\noffice to stock the whole of France for the next year and a half. Now,\r\nthough\"--tossing a long, yellow envelope across the room into a numbered\r\npigeonhole--\"things have slackened up a bit. A week ago I had half an\r\nhour off to shave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the people back home cause you much bother by not addressing their\r\nletters correctly?\" asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n\"N--no,\" replied the P.S. meditatively, \"although I did get one the\r\nother day addressed to Private Ethan Allan of the 'American\r\nRevolutionary Force.' At first I was going to send it back to Vermont,\r\nafter changing the private to Colonel, and have the D.A.R. see that it\r\ngot somewhere near old Ethe's final resting place; but on second thought\r\nI guessed she--it's generally a she--meant the American Expeditionary\r\nForces. So I went down about three or four regimental rosters, and\r\nfinally I found the guy. Now he's probably wondering why he didn't get\r\nthat letter in a month, instead of a month and a half, and cussing me\r\nout for the delay.\r\n\r\n\"The most trouble comes, though, from these birds what don't stay put.\r\nThey come over here all right with one unit, and then they get\r\ntransferred to some other. Then the unit is moved around, and the folks\r\nback in the States, not knowing about it, continue to send stuff to the\r\nold address. But generally we get 'em located in time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A Rush After Pay Day.\r\n\r\n\"How about the mail from this side?\" the reporter queried. \"Do you think\r\nthat the franking privilege causes the men to write more letters than\r\nthey ordinarily would? Does sending their letters free pile things up\r\nfor you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" the mail magnate responded, \"because the lads are\r\nbeing kept so all-fired busy these days they don't honestly have time to\r\nwrite much. On the bundle proposition, though, we have an awful rush of\r\nstuff just after pay day, when it seems as if every man was bent on\r\nbuying up all the lace handkerchiefs in the country to send to his girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, take it all in all, it's a great life if you don't weaken,\" the\r\nP.S. concluded. \"I've been in the Government post office service for\r\nsixteen years, now, and I never had so much fun before. I do wish,\r\nthough, that the boys would get stouter envelopes for their letters,\r\nbecause the ones they get from the Y.M.--and ninety-eight per cent. of\r\nthe letters that go out from here are written on Y.M. stationery--are\r\ntoo flimsy to stand much manhandling, and when they get wet they're\r\npretty much out of luck.

The\r\napplication of this test, it is held, will keep the mule-skinners too\r\nfully occupied to be able to cuss or to care a cuss about cussing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   This Stuff is Out o' Date.\r\n\r\nBut, men of the Old Army, particularly those who have trained with\r\nmountain batteries, think of what is passing! Think of what the younger\r\nand more effete generation of mules is missing! No more beneath the\r\nstarry flag will be heard such he-language as this:--\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Maud, you ---- Hoosier ----! Get a wiggle on your ----\r\ngood-for-nothing carcass! GIDDAP, Bill!

Aw,\r\nwee; way to talk to'm is third person--get me?--third person. None o'\r\nthis crude 'you' and 'yeze' stuff--same as talking to the Skipper,\r\ny'know.\"\r\n\r\nJerry gets his mouth all fixed to say, \"Aw, hell,\" recovers himself, and\r\nthen begins: \"Will the off animile kindly step at least two paces to the\r\nfront?\" (The mule starts to comply.) \"I thank the off mule! Now, will\r\nthe near mule kindly follow suit?\" (It also starts to comply.) \"Now,\r\nwill both the near mule and the off mule be so good as to repeat the\r\nprocess, both pulling together, until requested to desist?

Formerly field wireless stations each day at\r\na certain hour picked from the air figures flashed from Paris by which\r\nthe clocks of the array were synchronized. This method did not insure\r\nabsolute accuracy.\r\n\r\nEach day at eleven o'clock a simultaneous signal is sent to every\r\nstation so that through the existing zone, and at the front as well,\r\nclocks and watches show the same time. This synchronization is desirable\r\nunder present conditions and it is an absolute necessity with troops at\r\nthe front when, for instance, orders may specify that some operation is\r\nto be carried out at one point at a certain time and another operation\r\nat another point at another time. The success of both operations may\r\ndepend upon whether they are launched on the second.\r\n\r\nMiles upon miles of telegraph wires strung on poles labeled \"U. S.

On some of the poles there are double cross-beams\r\nsupporting in many cases as many as ten wires. There is a complete\r\nsystem of operators and central exchanges as well as a considerable\r\nforce of linemen and repairmen, quite a number of whom worked for\r\ntelephone and telegraph companies in the United States before the war\r\nbegan.

Where they\r\ngathered in half a million at home yearly, they are accepting a major's\r\nthree thousand and service allowance, in order to see that Bill Jones\r\nfrom Kankakee or Sam Smith from Pleasantville has the proper treatment\r\nfor warts in his stomach or barnacles on his thinking apparatus.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ward in an A.E.F. Hospital, Showing Some of the First\r\n    to Pay a Visit to \"Blighty.\"]\r\n\r\nIn addition to separating themselves from large wads of coin and all the\r\ncomforts of home, they have brought over the staffs of their various\r\nhospitals, who know all their funny ways of operating, from how best to\r\ncut a man loose from his appendix to painless extraction of the\r\nbankroll. They have also brought along all their collections of patent\r\nknives and scissors, the only thing they left behind being the doctors'\r\nbills that would take a year's service as a doughboy to meet the first\r\ninstalment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A Fear to Forget.\r\n\r\nNearly everyone has an ingrowing objection to going to a hospital, or\r\nacknowledging he must take the count for an illness, because of fear as\r\nto what treatment he may draw.\r\n\r\nForget it!\r\n\r\nThe Amexforce hospitals are not built along those lines, nor are the\r\nnurses sweet young things of fifty odd summers who hand out tracts with\r\nthe morning's milk or make kittenish love to a lad who may be tied down\r\nto a bed or too weak to run away. And the doctors are not owlish-looking\r\ncreatures with whiskers that would make a goat die of envy and sick-room\r\nmanners that would scare a Mental Scientist into catalepsy. They are\r\nreal human beings who understand the troubles of mankind from nostalgia\r\n(professional name for homesickness) down to enlargement of the coco\r\n(unprofessional name for the swelled head) and are doing everything in\r\ntheir power to make a little easier the big game we are playing to a\r\nshowdown with the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nIt's human nature to hate to go to the doctor. But if the boys would\r\nonly realize that if they would take their smaller troubles to the\r\n\"docs\" they could easily prevent them from becoming more serious ones,\r\nit would save a lot of useless suffering. Of course, that doesn't apply\r\nto treatment for the wounded, but the Army Chief Surgeon is trying his\r\ndarndest to make that as perfect as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A Hospital of 20,000 Beds.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, adequate hospital facilities have been arranged for.\r\nOne hospital alone has a capacity for 20,000 beds. At an emergency call,\r\nthe hospitals can handle twenty per cent. of the whole Amexforce. To\r\nbegin with the trenches, the Medical Department has introduced a sort of\r\nfolding litter that can go around corners without having to make a man\r\nwho's hit get out and walk around the bends. When he gets to the\r\ndressing station or collecting hospital, motor ambulances are ready to\r\ntake him back to the evacuating hospital, where the women nurses take\r\ntheir chances with the men, eight to ten miles behind the line.\r\n\r\nOnce his case is looked into there, he continues under the charge of\r\nthat hospital chief until he gets well or is sent home. If he's moved to\r\nanother hospital his record and register go with him, so that the new\r\nhospital knows immediately he was invalided for a piece of shell in his\r\nleg, and no flurried or overworked surgeon tries to operate on him for\r\ninflammation of the intestines.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end, the best specialists in the whole of the Union\r\nare at the disposal of any one who's unfortunate enough to get hurt. If\r\nit's eyes, ears, throat, abdomen, shell shock, mental derangement, or no\r\nmatter what, one of the biggest men from home is on the job. They are\r\nnot correspondence school surgeons, either.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Some of the Experts.\r\n\r\nMaybe one of these is from your own home town and you know him by name\r\nor reputation: George E. Brewer, New York; George W. Crile, Cleveland;\r\nHenry Cushing, Boston, the brain specialist, who knows every cell in the\r\nthink tank and just how it works and operates; F. A. Washburn, Boston;\r\nSamuel Lloyd, New York; C. L. Gibson, New York; R. H. Harte,\r\nPhiladelphia; F. A. Besley, Chicago; Angus McLean, Detroit; Charles H.\r\nPeck, New York; John M. T. Finney, of Johns Hopkins, Baltimore; F. T.\r\nMurphy, St. Louis; M. Clinton, Buffalo; R. T. Miller, Pittsburgh; C. R.\r\nClark, Youngstown, O.; E. D. Clark, Indianapolis; B. R. Shurley,\r\nDetroit; Joseph E. Flynn, Yale Medical.\r\n\r\nIf that isn't enough, associated with each of these men are other\r\ndoctors whose ability is pretty well known all over the States. For\r\ninstance, Dr. Lloyd, of New York, has with him Dr. McKernon, also of the\r\nbig town, one of the best ear specialists in the country. If a shell\r\ngoes off too near you and the eardrum suffers, Dr. McKernon will be on\r\nthe job to find out if he can't make a new one.\r\n\r\nA man who has just come over from Baltimore said the Army had\r\npractically cleaned out Johns Hopkins University there, which produces\r\nmore good doctors to the square inch than France does fleas. So when it\r\ncomes to sorting out the cases, the men with the bad listeners won't be\r\nsent to the throat specialist, nor the chap with a wounded eye made a\r\ncandidate for the brainstorm man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Army's Big Eye Man.\r\n\r\nCases of eye wounds or troubles are handled by a doctor who probably\r\nknows more about the eye than any one man in America, Dr. George de\r\nSchweinitz, of Philadelphia, who has transplanted his whole sanitarium\r\nto France in order that no man of the Amexforce may be deprived of his\r\nsight where there is one chance in a million of saving it. With that in\r\nview, the chances of coming out of this mess with both eyes are\r\nexceptionally good. Statistics from both French and British armies show\r\nthat of all the wounded they have had, only one man in 1,200 is blinded.\r\nIf they had had the organization of the American medical force, the\r\nchance would probably have been reduced to one man in 2,500.\r\n\r\nNo one pretends to say that our hospitals make sickness or wounds a\r\npleasure, but be assured of one thing. If anything happens to you,\r\nyou'll be well looked after in them by the world's leading medical and\r\nsurgical authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                      A PLEA TO THE CENSOR.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" said a short, bow-legged corporal the other day, \"I wanta send\r\nthree pictures home to the folks, but I dunnoo how I can get it across.\r\nThese censorship rules say all you can send is pictures of yourself\r\nwithout background that might indicate the whereabouts of the studio or\r\nother strategic information.

You won't believe this unless you've seen it, but that 'bus\r\nis hitched up to a horse an' a camel, a regular camel like you see in a\r\ncircus--come from Morocco, they tell me, and looks as if he had gone as\r\nlong as it is camels can go without a drink, or chow, either.\r\n\r\n\"The last one's a prize. I took it in one of those villages up the line.\r\nIt's a young kid in a soldier's coat down to his knees walking down the\r\nmain street with a stick in his hand driving a sled, and what do you\r\nguess is hitched to the sled? By gosh, a big fat goose, and nothing\r\nelse. The kid's steerin' the goose with the stick, and the goose's\r\nlookin' around with that fool goose look, just like the picture you see\r\nof that Crown Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Say, what do you think those folks with their automobiles and subways\r\nand everything would make of that? It sure would open their eyes.\r\nTravel's a great thing for a man,\" said the corporal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HOW THEY LOOK IN THE TRENCHES.\r\n\r\n    This New Official Photograph Shows Some of Our Over-seas Troops\r\n    in their Ringside Costume.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     WHAT SAILOR INGRAM DID.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither Casablanca nor Horatius at the bridge surpassed in heroism young\r\nOsmond Kelly Ingram, who threw overboard the explosives on the American\r\ndestroyer Cassin in order that the German submarine's torpedo should not\r\ndetonate them and destroy his ship--and gave his life for his comrades\r\nand his country in doing so. Ingram sought danger instead of fleeing it.\r\nHe might have saved his life without discredit. But he did not think of\r\nhis life--or if he thought of it, he knew that he was deliberately\r\nsacrificing it. And he acted with instant resolution.\r\n\r\nTo his courage and his quickness is due the fact that Ingram's was the\r\nonly life lost in the German attack on the Cassin. That result he\r\nforesaw and welcomed. He knew how to take death as his portion without\r\nan instant's hesitation. He was of the breed of heroes, and his name\r\nwill be borne forever on the nation's roll of honor.--Boston\r\nTranscript.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                       THE ROAD WAS OPEN.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance's wonderful highways which saved her in this war are as crooked\r\nas a jig saw puzzle, but there are excellent maps which show every road\r\nin the country. Up near the fighting front, however, the new military\r\nroads are as broad and as good as some of the old highways which have\r\nsurvived since the days of the Romans and more than a map is needed if\r\nyou want to remain in France.\r\n\r\nA few days ago two American newspaper correspondents were travelling\r\nfrom one French city to another, the shortest course, according to the\r\nsame excellent maps, taking them close back of the French lines. All day\r\nthere had been a blinding snow, it was deep and loose on the ground, and\r\nthe car was going as fast as possible for safety.\r\n\r\nTemporary wooden signs at cross roads showed the direction of different\r\ncamps. The road plunged through a forest, occasionally they passed a\r\nsoldier plodding through the snow, then emerged along the base of a\r\nridge honeycombed with dug-outs and bombproofs on its sheltered side. It\r\nwas plain that they were close to the front. Soldiers peered from\r\ndoorways at the car skidding through the swirling snow; then the huts\r\nceased. For a mile the correspondents ran behind a flapping wall of\r\ncanvas camouflage, with barbwire entanglements on the other side of the\r\nroad. The map indicated they were on the right road.\r\n\r\nThen they came to a barbwire affair like a turnstile lying on its side\r\nin the middle of the road, and stopped. They could not see a hundred\r\nfeet through the fog and snow, but could hear the muffled boom of nearby\r\ncannon. The map showed only three kilometers ahead the main highway to\r\nthe city they were headed for. They did not know that the German\r\ntrenches were only two kilometers ahead and that the snow was the only\r\nreason the Boche had not seen them and favored them with a shot. Two\r\nFrench officers came along and in his best French one of the\r\ncorrespondents asked if they could get through on that road.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you speak German,\" was the answer with a laugh and in excellent\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                        THERE'S A REASON.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For Pete's sake, Ed, quit tryin' to pick your teeth with your fork!\r\nMind your manners, man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, go easy, Mike; how'n'ell am I goin' to buy a toothpick, with wood\r\nso expensive in France?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                    SEA SLANG PUZZLES POILU.\r\n                              ----\r\n                 Trips on an Idiom and His Pride\r\n                          Takes a Fall.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the idiomatic terms adopted by United States Marines everywhere,\r\nthe expression \"shove off\" is used more frequently than any other. In\r\nthe sea-soldier lingo, if a Marine goes home on furlough, leaves his\r\ncamp or garrison or goes anywhere, he \"shoves off.\"\r\n\r\nA story comes from France of a Marine who had been acting as orderly for\r\na lieutenant. The officer sent him on an errand, and when he returned\r\nthe lieutenant was nowhere about. A poilu, who happened to be loitering\r\nin the vicinity, was questioned by the Marine:\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen the lieutenant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, monsieur, oui,\" replied the poilu, proud of his newly acquired\r\nMarine Corps English, \"he have--what you call--pushed over.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                         HOW ABOUT THEM?\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nThings that make all the difference in the world:--\r\n\r\nA letter from ---- (fill in name to suit yourself.)\r\n\r\nA real soap-and-hot-water bath.\r\n\r\nA real shave.\r\n\r\nDry feet.\r\n\r\nAmerican tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"Good work!\" from the skipper.\r\n\r\nA home-town paper less than a month old.\r\n\r\n\"Seconds\" on coffee--when it's made right.\r\n\r\nPay-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                         YANKEE AVIATORS\r\n                           PLAY IN LUCK\r\n                              ----\r\n                     Dead Engine Sneezes and\r\n                     Picks Up after a 2,000\r\n                           Meter Drop.\r\n                              ----\r\n                    SKY FULL OF CREAM PUFFS.\r\n                              ----\r\n                 Observer Who Fails to Surround\r\n                      Something Hot Faints\r\n                         From the Cold.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nThose were American boys who dodged Boche air patrols, laughed at\r\nanti-aircraft guns and spattered bombs upon Rombach and Ludwigshafen far\r\nbehind the Boche lines.\r\n\r\nOne of them used to be a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Joseph Wilson,\r\nof Wheeling, W. Va., another is Bud Lehr, of Albion, Neb., who played\r\ncenter on a basketball team that won the State championship. The others\r\nare Charles Kinsolving and Charles Kerwood, of Philadelphia, and George\r\nKyle, of Portland, Ore. They are corporals in a French flying squadron\r\nsituated within an hour's flight of an American infantry training camp.\r\n\r\nSeated around the rough mess table in their popotte--a tiny building\r\nstuck away on a ledge of rock under a cliff--they told all about the\r\nbombing of the railroad stations and ammunition factories at Rombach and\r\nLudwigshafen.\r\n\r\n\"The old Boche almost got me that time,\" said Lehr, lifting the oil\r\ncloth table cover to knock wood. \"The engine of my boat died on me just\r\nover Rombach. I pulled everything in sight and kicked every lever I\r\ncouldn't see. Nothing doing; anti-aircraft shells bursting right on a\r\nlevel with me. We began to drop. I turned around to the observer and\r\npulled a sea-sick grin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A Sneeze Spelled Joy.\r\n\r\n\"'It's all off, kid,' he said. 'Looks like we're through.'\r\n\r\n\"We dropped from 5,000 meters to 3,000. Then the engine sneezed, coughed\r\nand took up again. My heart and the boat came up 2,000 meters in one\r\njump. The rest of the formation had gone on, dropped their bombs on\r\nRombach and were beating it for Ludwigshafen. By the time I got back to\r\nmy right altitude I could see the effects of their bombs. The railroad\r\nstation was burning like a haystack and smoke was coming from the\r\nmunitions plant. I circled the town and the observer released the bombs.\r\n\r\n\"Then I turned nose back towards Verdun and crossed the lines. A couple\r\nof miles behind the line the engine ran out of gas, so we came down in a\r\nfield.\"\r\n\r\nThey circled several times on the French side of the lines before\r\ncrossing in order to reach the necessary altitude. Kyle dropped eight\r\nbombs, most of them on the munition plant at Ludwigshafen.\r\n\r\n\"The sky was full of cream puffs,\" he said, \"but it didn't bother us\r\nvery much because most of the stuff was breaking above or below us. We\r\ntook our time, aimed for the objective, and dropped the bombs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Can't See Bomb's Results.\r\n\r\n\"You can't hear them explode or see the results unless you're flying\r\nquite a distance behind the squadron because we go so fast that by the\r\ntime the fire gets under way we are miles off. Except for Lehr's\r\nmachine, we maintained our formation and came out flying in the same\r\nposition. If there were any Boche patrols out in our neighborhood they\r\nknew better than to tackle us.\r\n\r\n\"When we came down I found my observer unconscious. I thought he had\r\nbeen hit, but he had only fainted from the cold.\r\n\r\n\"You big rummy,\" turning to the observer and swiping one of his\r\ncigarettes from the open box on the table--\"You big rummy, I told you\r\nyou had better surround something hot before starting--a bowl of oatmeal\r\nor coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Gimmie a light now.\"\r\n\r\nAll five are awaiting their transfer to the American flying corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     STARS IN A HERO'S ROLE.\r\n                              ----\r\n                  Movie Actor Plays Sapper in a\r\n                          Real Rescue.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the candidates for officers' commissions at the A. E. F.'s\r\ntraining schools is a former movie star who has served his\r\napprenticeship with the British Army. To see him now, few would\r\nrecognize him as one of the high steppers under the bright night lights\r\nof Broadway as he was a year ago. Seized by a sudden impulse, he\r\nenlisted in the British army without waiting for America to get into the\r\nwar and now in return for faithful service, has been given an\r\nopportunity by that government to fight under his own flag. Several\r\nother Americans who have also worn the British uniform, and who were\r\nsent to the school for the same purpose, tell this story of one of the\r\nformer screen star's experiences:\r\n\r\nIn the darkness--locomotives, auto lights in the fighting zone--a\r\nheavily loaded truck was struck by a train. The truck was overturned\r\ndown an embankment, imprisoning the two men on it, killing one almost\r\ninstantly and seriously injuring the other. Spurred by the latter's\r\ngroans and appeals for help an officer was directing a squad of men with\r\ncrowbars and sticks in an effort to lift the truck when the former actor\r\ncame up. The men were making no progress in budging the heavy wreck\r\nwhile there was a possibility, if they did, that it would crash down on\r\nthe still living man.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can get the man out, sir if I may try,\" the New Yorker said\r\nsaluting the officer.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" the officer asked surprised at the interruption.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a Yank, sir,\" he replied, using the popular designation for\r\nAmericans in the British army.\r\n\r\n\"What's your rank?\" continued the officer, determined that the man be\r\nrescued properly if at all.\r\n\r\n\"Master engineer, sir,\" the American answered.\r\n\r\nEvidently that was sufficient for the officer, for he at once assented\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n\"You may try. Lend him a hand men.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Yank\" took a shovel and started tunnelling under the truck. As he\r\nwormed himself into the little hole, the shovel was abandoned for a\r\nbayonet and he pushed the dirt back with his hands to others, who threw\r\nit aside. After an hour's work, he had the dead man out. Another hour,\r\nand he had burrowed molelike, to the side of the other man, who still\r\nwas conscious.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to take a chance? It'll be torture getting out,\" he said to\r\nthe truck driver.\r\n\r\n\"Anything to get from here to die outside,\" the man gasped.\r\n\r\nA rope was shoved in and the American tied it around the man's legs.\r\nSlowly, while he guided the battered body of the now unconscious man,\r\ncomrades pulled them both back through the narrow tunnel.\r\n\r\n\"I'll see that you're mentioned in regimental orders for your efforts,\"\r\nsaid the officer to the exhausted \"Yank,\" and he did.\r\n\r\nThe truck driver had an arm broken, a shoulder crushed and a fractured\r\nskull. He was rushed to a hospital on a chance that his life might be\r\nsaved after so much effort. The work was not in vain, for a few days ago\r\na letter was received from him, well again at his home in England,\r\nsaying to the former movie star:\r\n\r\n\"The latch string of this home in Leicester is always hanging out for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                       \"WELL, I'LL BE--!\"\r\n                              ----\r\n                        THEY'RE ALL HERE.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fat Casey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be--!\"\r\n\r\nAfter seven years Gabby and Fat Casey came face to face on a\r\nsnow-covered country hillside in France. Gabby played right tackle on\r\nthe football team out in Chicago in his sophomore year. Casey, a senior,\r\nwas center and a bother to the trainer because he would surround two\r\nbits' worth of chocolate caramels every day, adding to the dimension\r\nthat won him his nickname.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in France Gabby swung his right mitt and clasped Casey's. They\r\nhung on in a kind of reminiscent grip, searching one another's face for\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nCasey wore a smudge on his upper lip. Gabby's face was still un-hairy,\r\nbut a little lined by the last few years of bucking the business line\r\nfor a living. Casey has no cause for wrinkles, having a wealthy Dad.\r\nAnd, anyway, Fat's disposition proofed his map against the corrugations\r\nof money problems.\r\n\r\nWe find them shaking hands again.\r\n\r\nCasey is driving a touring car over from Divisional Headquarters to call\r\nfor the major of the Third Battalion. He stalls on the hill from dirty\r\ndistributor points and gets out to sand-paper them. That red-headed\r\nsentry, gazing skyward through field glasses on \"aeroplane watch\"\r\nagainst the Boches, can be none other than Gabby, the ex-right tackle.\r\n\r\nGabby is a little puzzled by Fat's moustache, but only for a second.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever became of Charley Rose,\" he asks, \"and Bill Lyman, and all the\r\nrest of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the love of Mike--meeting you in this forsaken spot after all this\r\ntime! Where are you stationed? Can't we stage a reunion? Can't we, Fat?\"\r\n\r\nWell, Fat is a sergeant-chauffeur, Q.M.C. Gabby is a doughboy in an\r\ninfantry regiment. They can't get together. They're at the War.\r\n\r\nFor the next ten minutes a whole battlefield of Boche fliers might have\r\nsneaked past the Chicago sentry and bombed the daylights out of Division\r\nHeadquarters without any hindrance from Gabby.\r\n\r\nCharley Rose, says Fat, is an infantry lieutenant. Maury Dunne's in the\r\nheavy artillery. Dan McCarthy, the hopeless but untiring \"sub\" of the\r\n1911 squad, is in France in the Q.M.C.\r\n\r\n\"Well, doggone!\" says Fat, in wonderment at the littleness of the world.\r\n\"Well, gee whiz!\" says Gabby, thinking the same thing.\r\n\r\nYou'll meet 'em all over here--your old rivals, your staunchest pals.\r\nYou may find yourself top sergeant over the very kids you stole apples\r\nor milk bottles with back in the \"good old days.\" Perhaps you'll be\r\nsaluting the fellow who cut you out of your girl back in high school\r\nwhen an exchange of class pins with pretty Frances Black meant that you\r\nwere engaged to her for that semester.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in France, they're all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                       SO THIS IS FRANCE?\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first shift is coming out from the tables. White-haired plump Madame\r\nscurries over to her place at the door to collect the dinner toll.\r\nSilver clinks into her country cash register, a cigar box with the lid\r\nknocked off.\r\n\r\nThe second shift edges toward the dining room where Suzanne and Angel\r\nand Joan are rushing about, clearing away the traces of the first\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\"How's the chewin'?\" asks the Albany rifleman.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty good, pretty good,\" says the engineer boy from Los Angeles.\r\n\"Good place to fill up on tan bread for a change.\"\r\n\r\nClose your eyes and shut out the khaki.

Or you're\r\nback in the locker room hearing the coach's final instructions for the\r\ncounty championship tussle with Lincoln High.\r\n\r\nThe second service is finishing. Four soldiers are rolling the old\r\ntin-throated piano into the middle of the floor. One of them used to be\r\na rag-time \"song-booster.\" Oh, baby, how he can torment those keys!\r\n\r\nThere they go, in a chorus of fifty roof-raising voices:\r\n\r\n        \"Twice as nice as Paradise,\r\n          And they called it Dixie Land!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ----\r\n                     SOMETHING MUST BE DONE.\r\n                              ----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American war zone recently was honored by a visit from several \"lady\r\njournalists\" who came out from Paris to see how \"our boys\" were faring.\r\n\r\nOne of these young women had been reared in luxurious surroundings in\r\nNew York. Since coming to Paris she seldom went about wearing anything\r\nbut slippers. These were all right because she always rode in a taxi.\r\n\r\nA certain American captain, who thinks nothing of using a nice ten-foot\r\nsnow bank for bathing purposes, was delegated to conduct the young women\r\nthrough the American war zone.\r\n\r\nFrom the start, the horror of the New York society writer knew no\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" she exclaimed, \"no pillows for our men! And you say, Captain,\r\nthey have no bathtubs, but have to bathe in the rivers and creeks? And I\r\nsee, there are no table cloths or napkins? Captain, leave it to me! I'm\r\ngoing to tell the people of America all about the terrible living\r\nconditions of our soldiers over here. Something must be done, and\r\nsomething will be done by an aroused public opinion back home!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain indulged an inward chuckle that racked his soul.
